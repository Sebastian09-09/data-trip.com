msg:Loved everything about this place. We came for a two night staycation and it was a fabulous get away from the city. The grounds are fantastic - there are peacocks, black swans, huge koi, a natural lake, two swimming pools (one outside particularly impressive), kids playground, indoor children’s room for little children, well equipped gym. 
The room was really spacious with large swivel tv, Marshall Blu tooth speaker, nespresso machine and Artelier Cologne shower gel/shampoo/body lotion/conditioner and soap. 
The breakfast room has lovely comfy sofas as well as tables. Breakfast was good and we spent a long time in the mornings just enjoying a long leisurely breakfast looking out at the garden. 
The attention to detail was superb, little extra goodies and just a general feeling that it was a cared—about place. 
Service was great, friendly and helpful but equally un-intrusive.  
This was such a nice experience as I’ve previously booked weekends away in China at big brand hotels and been really disappointed so I was apprehensive. Rose Garden Resort did not disappoint, we felt it was like being in a European boutique style hotel. It was so refreshing. 
We were here when it was wet and cold and we still enjoyed it - relaxing with books and at the indoor pool. We popped out into Hangzhou for dinner using DiDi which was easy enough.
Highly recommended, we will be back again!

The staff told us that the room was not quite ready for us at around 14:15 so we were invited to spend time at the outdoor pool while it was finished being cleaned. The outdoor pool is fantastic - quite a hub of activity especially late afternoon before dinner time. It has a number of sunbeds, parasols and shaded seating to cater to everyone's needs. We spent a few hours everyday here because the poolside is so tranquil and well arranged. The room itself is amazing, incredibly comfortable bed with a couple of comfy arm chairs and a sofa. The TV had lots of films to stream. The room also had a number of amenities like bottle opener, glasses, toiletries, USB charger sockets, fridge, iron, ironing board, etc. Equipped for every need. Finally, the breakfast was outstanding. It is well laid out in the English bar area, and could keep up with any international hotel chain's. Lots of Western and Chinese choices, as well as indoor and outdoor seating to enjoy it at. The staff have all been very respectful, polite, welcoming and attentive. 5* for everything. Will come again and recommend. Thank you.

The environment and facilities are great. The front desk ladies (Xiao Fan and Xiao Wang) are warm and friendly. Not only are there welcome snacks and fruits when you check in, but there are also bracelets from Lingyin Temple. There are also souvenirs when you check out~
A good experience. I will choose Greentown Rose Garden next time!

I will come again next time. The only bad thing was the breakfast experience. The breakfast was delicious. The bad reviews were given to two male waiters. One waiter with acne all over his face was always following us like a thief, fearing that if the steak was eaten up, he would have to fry more. I thought about finishing up and getting ready to go off work, with a reluctant look on his face. I watched him follow my friends and children, and occasionally peeked at them viciously. There were six of us in total. Could we only have two or three slices of steak?

msg:The hotel is very suitable for self-driving. There is free parking and many parking spaces on the ground. Check-in is fast and the license plate is automatically registered and so on. The hotel lobby is very beautiful and has a certain sense of age, but it is well maintained! ! It is not the kind of old, but a very retro American style. The restaurant is also very beautiful. One thing I like most is that you can dine outdoors. (There are mosquitoes in summer. The hotel has floral water, alcohol cotton pads, etc. placed outdoors for self-service. These are very considerate.) There are many types of breakfast, including Chinese food such as pasta, white porridge, sushi, Western food, etc. I like the avocado butter sandwich so much🥪 Delicious😋

Room: This time I stayed in the elegant room, which is large enough. The only drawback is that the room is not high enough. You may feel short when you first enter. There is only a small skylight (very considerately blacked out). In general, the room is suitable for sleeping, but don’t think about vacationing in the room.

The facilities in the room are very complete, including a Dyson hair dryer, a rotating large-screen TV, a coffee machine, a free minibar, and a cute little duck next to the bathtub; when you check in, you are also given the 18 pieces of Lingyin Temple, which is a bit of a surprise. Moreover! All the toiletries are small samples of Oulong, just like the Oriental Mandarin, which is great.

The surrounding environment is very quiet and peaceful, suitable for family travel. If you have the conditions, you should upgrade the room and live in a room with a large window, hehe

Service: Very efficient and professional, basically will not disturb you, just do your work!

In addition; there are so many trophies in the lobby hahahaha

The parent-child room is super large, with tents and dolls, picture books, and a very good viewing skylight and small stairs, which the children especially like.
The breakfast is very rich, and the afternoon tea is really a surprise.
When checking in, each child has a small backpack of Peppa Pig, which contains a small gift, food and drinks, and a blind box of toys. The room also comes with drinks, fruits and a bracelet, and there are souvenirs when checking out, which makes you feel happy.
Whether it is the hotel facilities and environment, room configuration or service attitude, they all exceed expectations. I am also very grateful to Xiao Wang and Xiao Fan, whose service attitude is super good and very, very satisfied!

msg:I haven't written a review for a long time. This time I really want to recommend it myself, not because the hotel asked me to write it. A group of seven people drove to Hangzhou for Mother's Day. We arrived at the hotel in the afternoon to check in. The room was upgraded on our own initiative. The room was equipped with snacks, drinks, and capsule coffee. We went swimming with my parents. The water temperature of the indoor swimming pool was 30 degrees, which was very suitable. The little brother helped take care of the elderly and introduced them throughout the whole process, and also served as a lifeguard. The outdoor swimming pool will definitely be a paradise for children when the weather is good. There is a small lawn in the back garden, which is not big, but it is well maintained. There are also peacocks, black swans, swings and children's playgrounds. Both Chinese and Western breakfasts are online to meet different tastes. Before leaving, souvenirs were also sent. For our requests and inquiries, the hotel has given as much satisfaction as possible and answered in detail. It is only 3-4 kilometers to Jiuxi and Linxi Bamboo Trail, which is very convenient. Parent-child family vacation, recommended.

In general, it is suitable for parent-child vacation. Except for the location, the transportation is not too convenient. It is far from the subway, and there is a bus at the door.

I was very tired at night and after draining the water in the bathtub, I found mud and hair. It was very disgusting. I don't know why the hygiene can be like this at this price. I called the front desk to ask about the room. After work, I asked him to call me again after ten o'clock in the morning... Without any other remedies or compensation measures, I had to carry my luggage, find a room and wash the bathtub by myself on the first day of my stay in a five-star hotel. . . The next day I specially left a message to wash the bathtub. I was very tired after playing for a day and found that there were still hair, dust and oily things reflecting the water after I finished the bathtub. I was really too lazy to bother with it. . . . The service is just like normal five-star hotel service. . (The air conditioner can’t adjust the temperature. No matter how I adjust the room temperature, it’s 25. Calling the front desk to tell me is completely useless) I won’t stay here next time😓

Chinese restaurant: The quality of the dishes is very good and suitable for all tastes. The ordering service staff George saves a lot of trouble when ordering from him.
The front desk staff, Xiaocheng, Xiaoyun, Xiaoma, and Xiuli have strong service awareness, are attentive, and are very caring towards children.

msg:Take your children out to play. The service of the old hotel is very high quality. The restaurant has Chinese and Western food. If you want to eat buffet, it is Western food, and if you want to eat a la carte, it is Chinese food. The water temperature of the swimming pool is 30 degrees, and there is an outdoor swimming pool if you go in summer. There are entertainment facilities outside the hotel, a small playground, and a small children's playground on the first floor of the hotel. There were peacocks outside, and the hotel warmly gave them peacock feed when we went to see them. The hotel will give welcome small desserts and fruits which is very warm.

The front desk staff and lobby manager were very enthusiastic every day, which was a plus.

The breakfast restaurant was very a**ospheric, with a small but refined menu, which was good, but the guy at the dessert restaurant needed to improve his service awareness. He was reluctant to order some homemade cookies (he gave me a few when I checked in and they were delicious, but there were no cookies for breakfast, so I asked him for a few). This was the first time I saw such an emotional waiter

msg:This is my first time staying at Greentown Rose Garden. The hotel is quite old, but the equipment in the room seems to be fashionable now. In particular, smart toilets solve the problems of many people with constipation. There is also a Dyson hair dryer in the room. Although the hotel is old, compared with many new hotels, the bedside table cannot be equipped with a series of sockets for mobile phones, iPads, etc., but the hotel is still very considerate and has a multi-purpose plug-in version in the bedside drawer, which is very good It also shows the hotel's intentions.
In addition, when it comes to the wardrobe in the room, there is also a lot of space. In addition to the entrance to the room, there is an entire wall for hanging clothes. The bathroom is also equipped with a wardrobe for hanging clothes. There is also a small dressing table for many exquisite items. Girls provide a small space.
The quiet Jiuxi Scenic Area deep inside the hotel is very safe, just like a small English manor. Even the decoration in an elevator is exquisite.
We stayed on the 3rd floor. The room had a sloping bed, like a tiger bed. It was very interesting. The scenery outside the window was beautiful and you could see the entire hotel garden. It was very suitable for a self-cultivation holiday.

msg:Environment: Among hotels with the same price in Hangzhou, this one is the most cost-effective and has the best environment. Very suitable for parent-child activities. There are also many foreign customers.
Unlike other hotels, except for the rooms, lobby, and gym, there are no other places for entertainment. The first floor of this hotel is a wellness center with indoor and outdoor swimming pools. In this season, the temperature of the indoor swimming pool is 30 degrees, which is very comfortable. There is also a gym, children's play room, and body care center on the second floor. There is a huge lawn outside with several green peacocks, black swans and koi carps. Along the path, there is a dense forest in the hotel. There is a lake deep in the forest, there are also black swans, and there is a small boat, which is like a fairyland.
Service: Front desk interns Xiao Cheng and Xiaojiao are very patient, meticulous and gentle in their service, and the customer experience is super good.
There is an English breakfast room on the first floor of the hotel, where you can eat until 10:30. The decoration style is very British and the breakfast is exquisite.
The Chinese restaurant is open from noon to 2 pm. The portions of the dishes are large and the taste is very good.
We stayed in a room with a skylight on the roof on the third floor. When we pushed out the window, we could overlook the hotel's swimming pool and green space, as well as the distant mountains.
The hotel is very clean and tidy. Welcome snacks are delivered every day, and there are free black tea and capsule coffee in the room and in the lobby. There are also resting areas in the stairwell. When we stayed during the festival, we were given free moon cakes and an exquisite coffee set gift bag.

msg:The hotel is like a small manor, with dozens of rooms in total. The rose fragrance in the lobby smells very good, like the red roses of Jo Malone. The outdoor swimming pool is very beautiful, facing the garden, and you can sit and dine by the pool in the morning. The elegant room originally booked was very dark, but later I saw that the starry sky room also had construction defects that made it even darker. The mountain view room would have been much brighter with a terrace, but there was a 500 yuan price difference and no free upgrade, so I ended up staying in the exquisite room. The room is relatively large, with a sofa where you can sit and drink tea, and a desk where you can work. The facilities are complete, and the decoration is old. There is mold in many places in the shower room. There are bathrobes and bathrobes. The material of the bathrobe is very comfortable, but there are stains. I don’t know whether it was not washed or not cleaned properly. There are welcome snacks and fruits, and drinks in the refrigerator are free. Breakfast has both Chinese and Western options, including all-you-can-eat steak. The garden is not big. There are a few peacocks. It takes ten minutes to walk around. The area behind it is not well maintained and it is not easy to walk. Next to it is the villa area, which is an inaccessible private residence. If you want to eat, you have to walk to the comprehensive Intime Depar**ent Store in Songcheng, which takes about 15 minutes. You can also order takeout. There are no subways but buses in the surrounding area. You basically rely on taxis to get around. It is quite far from the West Lake Scenic Area.

msg:The hotel is very unique, with a nostalgic and elegant decoration style. The rooms are widely spaced and relatively quiet. It is suitable for travelers who want to be less affected by their travels.
The 2.4-meter large bed is actually made up of two 1.2-meter small beds joined together. The gap between the two beds still makes people feel a little uncomfortable, but there is no problem if you sleep on a small bed each. The pillows and mattresses are moderately soft and hard, and generally provide a good sleeping environment.
The functional area of ​​the room is very complete, the bathroom partition is clear, and there is a large curtain in the bed and sofa office area that can be closed, so that the family can travel without affecting each other.
Finally, what I am very satisfied with is the breakfast, which is a combination of Chinese and Western to satisfy the needs of the taste buds. The restaurant is very unique, with a retro British style. Downton Abbey is still playing while dining (in muted mode, which has little impact on guests). Recommend the steak and mashed potatoes, very well done.
Suggestion: Because the decoration of the room has too many blind spots and is old, for example, the glass mirror in the bathroom has a lot of scale, the fabric sofa has many stains that cannot be washed away, and the bathtub is also old and yellowed. These all need to be fixed.
Despite its faults, it is, overall, a beautiful and elegant resort hotel.

Disadvantages: When changing clothes in the women's locker room at the swimming pool, a certain woman brought two 10-year-old boys into the bath, and she was fully dressed. I was naked, which was very embarrassing.

1: From check-in to check-out, almost every hotel employee is well-trained and works in their respective positions. This experience has not been encountered for a long time. I remember the last time I experienced the same service in an all-foreign hotel service. Check out Before leaving, Xiaojiao sent a snack as a souvenir, just in time to eat some snacks on the way back. (When the security guard at the gate said thank you every time he checked in on the first day, he didn’t respond, but the security guard on the night shift that day would not. I don’t know why. I hope the hotel can care about it)

2: Fragrance (into the lobby of the hotel, there is a burst of natural rose fragrance, not the smell of essence)
It is recommended to pay attention to such small details of fragrance in the room

3: Bed I value the bedding when staying in a hotel. The whole night experience is great, and I want to sleep very much. The bedding and mattress are comfortable, and the bed is big. My husband sleeps in a normal sleeping position, and I can still turn it sideways, hahaha

4: Toiletries I use Oulong cleaning products, but I personally think that the cleaning products can be sealed, which is more clean and hygienic. The body lotion on the sink has already been used. Later, the waiter replaced it with a new one.

5: Supporting facilities There is a spa swimming pool on the ba*****t floor, etc. My favorite is the back garden leading through the restaurant on the first floor. I feel like dreaming back to a European castle. I still remember the last time I had such a feeling in Europe. There are peacocks in the back garden. And the black swan (the water in the black swan's pool can be changed)

6: Make a suggestion for music. When you check in, you can note the usage method and Bluetooth name next to the speaker, which can facilitate the use of the speaker by the staying guests. In addition, soft classical music will be played when the door is opened and closed. It is also recommended that you press do not disturb when you check in, and the concert will stop
 
7: Breakfast The food for breakfast is very fresh. What moved me was that the desserts tasted very fresh. In fact, I have never had breakfast desserts so fresh in other five-star hotels. Here I want to praise you

8: Traffic Didi Taxi is convenient, ten minutes to Jiuxi

9: Pets The hotel does not allow pets

To sum up, I give five points and some small suggestions are for better hotel management. Generally, I don’t write reviews. I wish you a prosperous business.

The big bed is made up of two single beds, which is big enough, and with a single bed added, there is no pressure at all to accommodate two adults and two small ones; the small skylight that opens upwards is very interesting, and you can indeed see the sky at night; there is Indoor and outdoor swimming pools; the service of the hotel is also very good, and the service staff are more patient. There is a small flaw that needs to be mentioned. It is not easy to judge the opening and closing of the exhaust fan in the bathroom. It should be better to deal with it.

msg:I did a lot of strategies. I originally wanted to live next to the West Lake, but the better star-rated hotels next to the West Lake start at 1500. Later, I saw the recommended strategy from Xiaohongshu and chose the Rose Garden Resort Hotel with a beautiful environment.
The hotel is next to the Qiantang River, about 10 kilometers away from the West Lake, and it takes about 20-30 minutes to take a taxi. The nearby attractions include Songcheng Eternal Love (next to it), Faxi Temple (6km), Meijiawu (4km)
Rose Garden Hotel focuses on roses. There are many red roses planted in the whole manor, and the clusters are very beautiful. As soon as you enter the hotel, you can smell the aroma of rose essential oil, which is very comfortable (forgot to ask them before leaving what brand did you use)
The interior of the room is very large, it should be 40 square meters. The room is equipped with a capsule coffee machine, BASE audio system, and Dyson hair dryer. The washing and care equipment is Oulong, and the hand sanitizer and hand cream are Bulgari white tea. It is worthy of a star hotel. The environment and Hygiene is not to be picked
There is a gymnasium, indoor heated swimming pool and billiards downstairs in the hotel. You can experience it for free when you stay. There are very few people in the swimming pool. You can swim and occupy the entire swimming pool by yourself.
There is also breakfast on the second day. The breakfast is very delicious and there are many varieties. The staff are very considerate in introducing and reminding us. Five-star recommendation!
Here, I would like to thank the hotel staff Xiaojiao and Feihao. The service attitude is very good, and the questions and needs raised will be solved immediately. The Rose Garden Resort Hotel is really worth recommending! I will stay again next time I come to Hangzhou!

Secondly, there are quite a lot of five-star parent-child hotels, and there are not many parent-child hotels that handle details as well as the Rose Garden Hotel. There are children's toys, snacks, bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, etc., and the swimming pool is also equipped with sunscreen and toys. The most important thing is the service, which is definitely a five-star service. When we checked in, because the baby was sleeping, we checked in early and thoughtfully. The manager Ma Dan in the front office was very enthusiastic, and she was very attentive and serviced to all the check-in staff. We prefer the Rose Garden Hotel! In addition, the hotel's Chinese restaurant is quite authentic! It's worth coming again, a great experience, the elderly and children especially like it!

The waiters in the hotel are very enthusiastic.

The large roses in the garden 🌹 compete for beauty, wanting to compare with peacocks 🦚, black swans, children running among the flowers, full of interaction.
The breakfast buffet has many varieties, which can meet all kinds of needs. Sit by the window and drink a cup of coffee and enjoy the beautiful scenery outside the window. The moment is peaceful and peaceful.
Warm and considerate service, very comfortable to feel at home.

Some came to provide feed after seeing us go to the Peacock Garden, some helped to arrange birthday wishes for my family, and some helped coordinate the cold lunch box at 6 o'clock in the morning.

The room is large and comfortable, with all the equipment. We love the toys in the kids room and the balcony in the big room. The housekeeping ladies are also nice and friendly.

The Chinese restaurant is delicious! Advance booking is required.

The only point deduction is an older lifeguard, who can say that we will abide by the rules of the hotel, but he puts a disgusted expression on his face to a group of young and old, wondering if the swimming pool is outsourced. Very different from other waiters.

msg:A very exquisite hotel, very suitable for holiday accommodation.
1. The hotel has complete facilities, gym, two indoor and outdoor swimming pools, billiards, table tennis, yoga room. The key is to have a particularly large private garden. There are also slides and swings that children can play on. The only regret is that the use time of various facilities is too narrow, which is not suitable for people who get up early and return late;
2. The hotel service is also in place. Every time I go back to the hotel by car, the welcome guests will take the initiative to open the door, and they will take the initiative to carry the luggage if there is luggage. The service staff served with a smile and a gentle tone. The elder brother who manages the swimming pool is very talkative and enthusiastic. The snacks in the room will be changed every day, even if they are not eaten.
3 The decoration style of the hotel has a classical beauty. The shutter partition between the bathroom and the bedroom in the house is a highlight. The bed is also very comfortable, the sheets are relatively thin and do not rub the skin. There is a CD player in the room, which is great to listen to while taking a bath.
4. Eat. There are two restaurants, Chinese and Western. Chinese food for dinner, delicious. Two breakfasts of western food, self-service, delicious, fresh fruit, and ingredients feel good, not that kind of fooling around. But there are no other restaurants around.
4. Others. During the entire check-in process, there were not many guests, it was very quiet, and there was no feeling of crowding, eating, swimming, and no queuing for facilities. The key point is that there is a family of peacocks and two black swans in his garden. The peacock spreads its tail when it sees a guest. Going in from the Swan Pool, there is a hidden lake deep in the garden, with tables and chairs by the lake. The hotel still has a lot of surprises, something!
In short, all aspects are worthy of the title of five-star hotel. The photos were all taken in the hotel!

The back garden of the hotel is actually very big, and many people may walk to the peacock. There are actually black swans behind the swing, and there is a small lake in the back. Walking further is like entering a mountain, very quiet. I haven't reached the end after walking for a long time. I heard that I can go around.

Over the past twelve years, the hotel has been maintained in a very good state👍Some renovations have been done, and the overall effect is very good. We still lived in the steeple room on the third floor and took pictures in the same position, haha. It's just that the doll has grown up. The gardens are also well maintained and pictures were taken at the same lakeside location. The bathroom in the room is very practical, plus points for the washlet and toiletries. In addition, before leaving, they also gave thoughtful small gifts, such as small biscuits, apples and water, especially a convenient peeler, which was very considerate.
A little advice can make it better. Billiard entertainment does not require staffing management, so it can be opened all the time. In addition, some entertainment items such as darts and table football can be added to increase the sense of vacation. In addition, the bicycles provided are very good, but the maintenance of the bicycles needs attention. Some may have been used for a long time, and the brakes are not very good.
A resort hotel worth choosing again! The receptionist at the front desk is very friendly and caring, and the concierges are also very enthusiastic!

The welcome cookies and dried pistachios and mangoes delivered on the first day of check-in were delicious. I live in an odd-numbered room on the second floor. Municipal renovations are very noisy. Wearing earplugs doesn't work. The noise starts at 7 o'clock on Saturday morning. If you come to check in, please avoid odd-numbered rooms. The big bed in the room is made up of two small beds. There will be a seam in the middle. But very wide. The quilt cover is very large at 2.4 meters. The closet is also very large and the room will look more comfortable and tidy after putting all the luggage in. Hotel elevator space is relatively small. There are many retired aunts and uncles and foreign friends staying in this hotel on weekends, so the elevator will be crowded. While staying at the hotel, the bride tried on makeup. Although the male staff who just entered the store and helped us push the luggage cart said a lot of unpleasant words, it affected my mood. Later, during the stay in the store, it was a happy memory. It is recommended that the hotel train the staff who push luggage carts in the correct and effective language communication skills. The municipal road construction is underway next to Songcheng, the scenic spot where the hotel is located. If the navigation is not updated, you need to drive through the gas station, pass the red light, and then turn right. Or come in through the Rose Garden single-family villa area, but the gate of the villa is not allowed to enter after 9 pm. The night view of the hotel is beautiful and moving. It's very romantic and you can take a stroll after dinner. The hotel has rich breakfast meals, and the breakfast service time is very long until 11 o'clock. The breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western, with many choices, and the dishes are fresh, the fruits are sweet, and various homemade snacks are also a treat for the taste buds. The hotel has a beautiful back garden where you can take a stroll after breakfast. Look at the peacocks, the beautiful black swans, the cute little fish and the big koi. There is also a gym in the hotel but good for families. It is also a good place to decompress.

I want to ask: Is the average height of an adult 1.4 meters? ! This is very unreasonable, but the hotel said that there is no way for the hotel regulations.

I booked three rooms in total because there are old people and children with mobility issues at the front desk. My sister is very nice and helped me upgrade to a parent-child room for free. My parents' room is just opposite, which makes it convenient for us to take care of the elderly. I really appreciate the hotel's hard work. Next time I come to Hangzhou, I will still choose Rose Garden.

msg:The design of the hotel is in the style of a European-style manor, and the decoration details are also very European-style, which is very beautiful. Even in rainy weather, it is very good to shoot anywhere! The breakfast is amazing. I thought that there are few rooms and it is the off-season. There may be few types of breakfast, but in fact, the variety is complete, and the speed of adding dishes is also fast. The steak, homemade yogurt, and all kinds of dim sum are exquisite and delicious. The small Chinese wontons are also special. Great! Although the facilities are a bit outdated, I still give full marks. In terms of service, I can only give 3 points. Two things are not very pleasant. 1. I stayed with my aunt on a rainy day, so I didn’t leave the hotel on the first day, and took my baby to play around in the hotel. Because it was raining outside, the outdoor amu*****t facilities could not be played, so they could only be played indoors. The paradise is called Children’s Paradise. Our baby is just 2 years old and he likes to play these things. As a result, two 7-8-year-old boys have been occupying the facilities and grabbing toys. One of the children named Tudou occupies the slide and does not let our baby play. I also communicated with them that the children want to play together, but it didn't work. My baby was a little afraid of getting close to them, and was robbed of a few pieces while playing with building blocks... The two boys had no parents to accompany them, and I couldn't educate them. Later, I learned that the two little boys were the children of hotel employees, not residents, so I wondered if there was something wrong with the management of the hotel? ? ? 2. When I had breakfast the next day, I wanted to eat boiled noodles from Chinese food. The chef who cooked the noodles outside was always away. I searched for it several times before I found it, and the noodles disappeared after cooking. 3. When I was walking around the hotel with my baby, there was a door open in the area where there were parrots. The baby pulled me to go in and have a look. Suddenly, an employee came and said that this place cannot be entered, and closed the door. I It feels like we have entered into a forbidden area by mistake, but we can actually tell us well, or we can just close the door if we can’t go in, which makes us feel very embarrassed. To sum up, the decoration is first-class, the facilities are a bit old but still beautiful, and the management service needs to be improved

The coupons I bought with Xiyou were very good. When I joined the company, the young lady kindly upgraded the room type for me within the range, and informed me in advance of the noise that might be caused by municipal construction. This makes people feel great~☑️

Facilities: I don’t feel that this is a vintage hotel, the hardware is not bad, but the bose audio in the room is a bit up and down🙃🙃


Hygiene: Very clean. When you enter the lobby of the hotel, there are bursts of roses wanting to go. How can you not love it?


Environment: Superb, I didn't expect there to be such a resort-style hotel in Hangzhou. The sun is very good, the swimming pool is very blue, the outdoor palm trees, the big lawn and the pumpkin carriage satisfy many fantasies about beautiful stories.


Service: Caring, every staff member encountered is more enthusiastic.

The breakfast is very rich, it is really a hotel worth a second brush!

Because of the epidemic in Shanghai, as a Shanghai citizen, I must make a phone call to ask if the hotel in Hangzhou welcomes us before leaving, and be fully prepared. Isn't it a waste of time and a bad mood to be coaxed back? ! So I called the hotel about three days before departure. The time was about seven o'clock in the evening. A man at the front desk answered the call with a very bad attitude and a blunt tone. When I asked about which items I would check, I was very impatient to tell me that I only knew when I came. It seemed that I was unwilling to tell me who came from this epidemic area. When I asked to complain to the hotel manager, I was told that the manager was off work. After I became angry, his attitude was slightly changed. Converted, this is not what a candle is? The lobby that arrived after three o'clock on the day of check-in was so late, and the front desk still told the room that the room was being cleaned, and that the pillowcases were used up and waiting. Finally, the lobby manager was at the front desk and helped us run up and down several times and coordinated for more than half a time. We were finally able to check in after hours. After entering the room, it gave us a big surprise. The room was very nice, very European-style, very resort-style. The facilities in the hotel are also good. The children also like this outdoor swimming pool. Chinese restaurant The food is also very tasty, the amount is a little small. In general, except for the very unpleasant front desk call, the others are still good, so I still give three points for the service.

Because the renovation time is not long and the whole is relatively new, they helped us upgrade the room. The small skylight is very loving and there are not many people. In the morning, the family contracted the entire outdoor swimming pool and had a good time. I feel that the hotel name is not so foreign and it is a little delayed. In fact, the experience in all aspects is very good! Before leaving, I also gave two bags of fruit biscuits and water, which is very considerate ❤️

A very old-fashioned high-end hotel with a small area, but after the refurbishment, the supporting facilities are complete, the hardware is properly maintained, and the service details are touching. The back garden is very large, with all kinds of peacocks, black swans, mazes and play facilities for children. The breakfast is also very nice. The roses in the room are as delicate as fake flowers. The outdoor swimming pool has a Southeast Asian style. In short, I am very satisfied with everything. I have lived in Hangzhou for so many years and regret that I met her so late! It is also very convenient to play around. There are Songcheng, Yintai, Yunqi Bamboo Trail, Jiuxi Baita Park, Liuhe Pagoda, and Qiantang River. Although it is far from the city, it will not be boring.

The hotel breakfast is delicious and rich in variety, especially the marshmallows that children can play with. Although we are too young to play, other children have a great time.
When I went to the lawn, the most painful thing was being bitten by mosquitoes for more than a dozen bags. I was sad😫

Originally wanted to set the millennium, but the shot was slow and there was no room, and finally chose the rose garden not far from Jiuxi. First of all, the room is very clean, it can be said to be very clean. Although it has been open for a long time, it can be seen that the facilities are still up to date; the second service is in place, the response speed is very fast and the waiters are smiling, which makes people feel happy; The environment of the third hotel is still ok, the place is not big, there are few people, it is relatively quiet, the air is scented with osmanthus, it is quite suitable for vacation; breakfast dishes are not too many, but the taste is good and enough. The bad place, the first one might be that the location is not too good. If you don’t eat in a hotel, don’t think of anything delicious when ordering takeout. You have to call a car when you go out, but I only go to Jiuxi, which is actually quite suitable. Yes, the second one is the mildew smell on the negative floor. The gym, swimming pool, spa and children’s playground are on this floor. I hope it will be better if we can improve the ventilation. The children's facilities are a bit thin, and my daughter is two and a half years old. Overall it is a good holiday experience.

I found that it was more than ten minutes away by taxi from Jiuxi Yanshu, and Songcheng was diagonally opposite the hotel, and it was only ten minutes to walk past. minute. Just because the subway is being repaired recently, it may have some impact on the hotel's business. Such a good hotel is blocked by the construction site at the door.
   But even if the road is being built at the door, it can't stop the excellence of the hotel.
   As soon as we entered the lobby, we could smell the scent of rose essential oil, and the reception staff were also very kind, helping us open the door and carry our luggage.
    We stayed in the exquisite rose twin room, the room is very big, the bathroom is also very big, all kinds of appliances in the room are complete, there is also a coffee machine and a CD machine. The best thing is that the hair dryer is equipped with Dyson. I am used to Dyson and feel like going home.
   This hotel is especially suitable for parent-child vacations. It has a swimming pool, a large lawn, garden, and peacocks and swans in the front yard. Originally, our plan was to go to Songcheng, but when my daughter saw the swimming pool, we didn’t even want to go to Songcheng. Soaked in the hotel for two days. You can play billiards, table tennis, swimming, gymnasium, and spa.
    There are welcome fruits when staying in the hotel, and the waiter will come over at two o'clock every afternoon to deliver small snacks, roses, and a rose mask. It's so considerate.
   I want to commend the breakfast is very delicious. I traveled around with my family and stayed in many hotels. My daughter said that the breakfast at this hotel is very delicious and the chef must be very good. So we also had dinner at this hotel and there was a dish. It's really delicious, sea urchin tofu in stone pot, I recommend everyone to eat.
   There are two indoor and outdoor swimming pools in the hotel. They are open in turn, very clean, and suitable for parent-child vacations. The staff in the swimming pool are also very good and have always been very responsible, especially for children entering the water. They are very vigilant and reassuring. Service.
   What moved me was that when I checked out, the front desk gave me a small gift bag, two apples, two bottles of water, and a box of small snacks. Although it is not a valuable thing, I have stayed in so many hotels and I have never left. It's so sweet to give small gifts.
     We will come again next year for vacation, it is also convenient to come from Shanghai, a very cost-effective parent-child hotel

msg:This time I went to Hangzhou to travel with my parents and grandmother. Everyone liked this hotel. The smell of roses that came to my face when I entered this hotel is worthy of the Rose Garden Hotel hahaha. The waiter will also send small snacks and snacks to the room every day. A rose mask is super intimate. This hotel is a British manor style as a whole. It feels like you are in Downton Abbey every minute. The environment is not surrounded by mountains. The hotel has its own back garden, which is very suitable for family outings. The decoration style of the room is classic American. The pastoral style opens the small skylight and you can see the back garden and outdoor swimming pool below. The breakfast is also quite rich. In addition, the service of the hotel is also worth mentioning. When you check out, there are souvenirs and gifts. Next time I go to Hangzhou, I will choose the green city rose. Garden Hotel Oh yes last but not least The hotel’s own Chinese restaurant food is very delicious. We stayed for three days and ate two meals. The dishes that the family feels are not thunderous. The dishes are very online, which is a big plus for this hotel. It's perfect!

杭州是個懂人情的城市，杭州的人文更是為之感動，酒店的服務更是體現了這一點，換房間，送小禮品，遇到問題都是第一時間幫忙解決，進出都會笑迎相送，落在酒店的東西會及時打電話聯繫告知，還會付費郵寄到家，在其他酒店也遇到過類似情況，但是沒有一家酒店這樣做過，在此還是要説聲謝謝！
誰説杭州是美食荒漠，我要替它澄清酒店的早餐，中餐，西餐，下午茶都是美味佳餚，給出五星好評一點都不為過，下次還會打卡

Не понравился только один момент. В бассейне на улице надо плавать в спортивной шапочке для плаванья. Чем обусловлено это правило так и не объяснили. Но очень странно плавать не в спортивном бассейне в шапочке. Видимо, не хотят чистить бассейн от волос, поэтому просят надеть шапки. По этой причине, больше бы не вернулись в этот отель.

msg:酒店整體還是不錯的，小而精緻。作為體量衹有50間房的酒店，人流不是很擁擠，吃早飯也不排隊，非常好。酒店自帶一個草坪，適合小朋友們跑跑跳跳，除此之外還有個後花園，沿着步道走一圈還是挺愜意的，有水有樹的。缺點就是從客房去往草坪的路有鐵鏈攔着，人走沒問題，但是推着嬰兒車就比較尷尬了，得抬着。此外建議酒店的小童樂園可以面積增大一些，目前面積有點小。其餘還是都很滿意的。餐廳的出品也很好，早餐精緻，正餐菜量也比較足。特別感謝行李員小姜和小陳，行李比較多，都給安穩地從車上拉到房間。也感謝小嬌和小豪，退房時房間有遺落小朋友的玩具，主動打電話詢問並給快遞了回來，下次來杭州還會考慮入住這裏

早餐，真的對不起價格，紅糖發糕硬的，糯米餈的表面已經風乾了，強烈懷疑頭一天沒吃完的繼續。
12點退房，如果是節假日高峯期，真的可以理解，非高峯期也是一樣。現在還有12點退房的酒店太少了。
離九溪也不近，周圍花園活動範圍非常小。朝着馬路的那麪，噪音很大。
真心建議，杭州那麼多酒店，非必要就不要選他家了。什麼都挨不上。

1）位置：靠近梅家塢、雲棲竹徑、六和塔、宋城等許多景區
2）服務：非常棒！前台程飛宇、陳瑞麗兩個小姑娘非常熱情，特意幫我們安排了安靜的房間還升了級，詳細告知隨近核酸點並親自幫我們把行李拿到房間，房間內的各項設施作了一一詳細的介紹，真的是太感動了。這幾天房間都是陳銀阿姨和小張阿姨幫我們打掃，也是很認真，仔細、主動。
3）衞生：非常乾淨，每天都看見阿姨在不停的擦洗各個地方，問了前台這八年酒店沒有重新裝修過，但是保養的超好。
4）設施：很歐式，喜歡！最近幾天早餐每天衹有十多個人但是酒店仍然做的非常用心，品種也很多。水果非常新鮮。第一天還送了鮮花每天晚上都有送點心和蒸氣眼罩。感謝酒店讓我們度過了美好的四晚。

再説優點：環境衞生硬件沒得説，特別是那個洗護套裝，第一天沒覺得，第二天發現頭髮怎麼還是那麼蓬鬆光滑，比平時自己用的都好，沐浴露也很不錯；床墊床品都很舒服，寶寶睡的時間都比家裡長。早餐種類雖然不多但味道可以，每天也有在更換品種，還有寶寶餐枱。
總的來説適合商務或者情侶，不適合親子，公共設施上酒店還要繼續加強才好。
