msg:I really like the type of small boutique hotel. How can the pink walls and black tiles not look good? The public area of ​​the hotel is like a gallery, full of literary and artistic temperament. The location is excellent. You will face Dongqian Lake when you go out, and turn left to Hanling Old Street. The room is clean, the service is very good, and there are different teas and snacks every day. The bathroom has a little aftertaste, which is a bit of an old house converted into a hotel. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but they are all boutique. The beef noodles are delicious. The service aunt is really nice. She actually came out and sent the sea**** rice cake to my table, saying that it was just fried. Try it. This kind of warmth between people can only be found in such a small hotel. I am touched. In general, I like it very much.

msg:We checked in at the hotel in the afternoon. Because it was a weekday and not many people were there, we upgraded the room type. The set meal was very cost-effective, and there was afternoon tea and the cakes were of high quality. The courtyard room is not big, but it has tables and chairs. The room is very large and the facilities are very complete, but there are not many plugs, especially near the sofa. Fortunately, my husband has an extension cord and can charge it while lying down. The bar is fully equipped with a kettle, capsule coffee machine, and water purifier. The only bad thing is that the water purifier is moldy. The shower room has no door, so it is easy to get water outside. In general, the location is very good, the hairstyle is good, and the ancient town and the lake are right outside. This is very convenient. The shops in the ancient town close early. I had some snacks in the ancient town in the afternoon. I didn’t have enough food at dinner time and wanted to have a midnight snack. Most of them were closed when I went out at 8 or 9 o’clock.

There is no elevator in the hotel lobby on the underground parking lot, but the front desk guy will come to help with the luggage; I have to complain about the breakfast. There is no buffet breakfast, only a set of Chinese and Western breakfasts. It is probably because there are too few guests...

msg:There are more and more national brand niche luxury hotels in China. Dongqian Lake JUN Hotel is also one of the most popular hotels in East China.
Location: 🌟🌟🌟
Hanling Old Street is located on the south side of Dongqian Lake. Opposite the hotel is a picture of the lake and mountains. You can walk on Hanling Old Street when the twilight is sinking. However, it is noisy because it is located in the old street without the seclusion of luxury hotels.
Hardware: 🌟🌟
The hardware configuration promoted on the Internet is what attracted me to experience it. I haven't seen B&O's speakers, only Bose. Dyson hair dryer comes standard, Hermes toiletries, free-flow minibar~ The mattress is Simmons, two 1.5-meter beds are made up of a large bed, seriously bad reviews! ! !
Service: 🌟
The butler service is useless. Failure to enter the license plate information before arrival makes it impossible for the car to enter the hotel parking lot smoothly. You need to inform in advance to leave the garage, and the front desk can manually enter it before leaving the library. After living for three days, I was asked for license plate information at the front desk every day. The hotel customer information management was too poor. Bad review➕1
Meals: 🌟
There are very few types of breakfast. I asked the waiter for a cup of American latte. The first waiter said that there was a problem with the coffee machine and he had to wait. The second said that there are no coffee beans? ? ! The third waiter said only American style, no latte? ? ? ! Too top...
The price of 2000➕ one night is worthy of your opinions.
I love Dongqian Lake so much, I still want to live back to my favorite Park Hyatt next time~

很舒服漂亮的酒店，私密性很好，酒店吃的也還可以呢，乾淨衞生，一出門也方便全是美食街，酒店服務也非常好，我定的酒店最好的房型好舒服，陽台外面就是湖水哈哈哈下次想住二樓的房型體驗一下，酒店設計很有品，洗護用品都是大牌，還有bo音響，唯一不足就是空調不能調冷氣哈哈哈我們廣東人可怕熱，我發現外地很多酒店都冬天不能調冷氣睡覺哈哈哈

酒店偷偷給我升級了房間，每晚的夜床很貼心，泡澡每天有不一樣的浴球，晚上的小餅乾好好吃

酒店環境很獨特，就是有點繞，會有點迷路，房間面積不大，但是各方面設施都不錯。周邊配套完備，韓嶺老街和東錢湖都是一牆之隔，對於旅遊來説很方便。

酒店小而精緻，古色古香.
入住前一晚酒店前台小季主動聯繫了我，詢問了車牌訊息，做了錄入併發來了停車場入場示意圖，省去了找尋的麻煩.並且提供了酒店早餐的菜單的電子版，非常感謝.
可能非旺季週末，酒店前台小季給升級了庭院房.歡迎水果，迷你吧都是贈送.
訂的房型包含了一份單人下午茶，並且能送進房間.但2人入住，一份略顯尷尬.
房間的設施設備基本符合這個價位酒店的標準.

酒店規模不大，衹有二十幾間房，但卻給予每間房奢侈的空間，一應設施俱佳，包括雙人洗臉枱、膠囊咖啡機、智能馬桶，迷你吧隨時補充，還有寶格麗的布草香味優雅。酒店建築中式古典風，門前庭院極簡禪意，足不出户，典雅園林與現代設施也能讓人盡享舒適。
最後要大大誇贊餐廳的美味早餐，雖然兩天都是一樣的套餐，但雪菜黃魚麪實在太好吃了，勝過以往每一次所吃。還有油條、粥、煎蛋、醬黃瓜都很美味，大廚很牛！還有酒店的地下停車全免，也很棒！雖然酒店價格小貴，但的確物有所值，是入住東錢湖的最佳選擇！

msg:1、衞生：整體看不出問題，細節不能細看，樓梯扶手間隙垃圾都不清理。
2、晚上10點打前台電話都打不通了，感覺整個酒店就1個工作人員，空空盪盪的。
3、餐廳早餐也不豐盛，菜單上幾個菜就那麼多了，138一位。
4、設施：房間淋浴間房門關不上，有的插座不能用。
整體判斷，價格要打對摺才對得起顧客…也難怪酒店基本沒啥客人，也需要酒店人員盯着顧客給5星好評

東錢湖風景絕贊，逛累了回酒店還能泡個澡。
整體入住體驗滿意，部分問題也溝通愉快。下次再來東錢湖還會選擇這裏！
早餐:花色不多，味道很好，衞生乾淨。有特別需求也可以直接提，基本會滿足的。白粥超讚，醃製的黃瓜絕贊！

msg:位置非常好，就在韓嶺老街上，背靠小河，面臨老街，側對東錢湖。出遊十分方便。
在地下停車場內單有自己的停車區域，可以直接告知酒店後優先進入地下停車場。雖然停車場到一層沒有電梯，但是酒店服務人員一早等在下面，幫忙拿行李，服務很好。
假期期間還給我們進行了升級，酒店內環境優美，佈置典雅，十分安靜，有標準的入住水果和夜床服務。衞生很好，每一處都很乾凈。
酒店服務人員小寧安排周到，服務貼心，隨行家屬身體不舒服，需要去葯店買葯，小寧也在出行工具和葯店所在地等給予了實用建議。總體是不錯的入住體驗。

msg:體驗感比較差。辦入住的地方就是一張辦公桌，帶着父母一起來，我們都推着行李箱，揹着包，也沒有服務生引導父母先去大堂坐着，於是我們全都站着，辦入住的小姐姐全程坐着操作電腦給我們辦。然後讓人帶我們去房間，邊走邊給我們介紹酒店格局，也不會搭把手幫忙推下行李箱，後來在我的提醒下幫忙推了下行李箱，服務意識不強。房間的地不是很乾凈，房間門背上部都是灰都沒擦乾淨，洗漱用品是寶格麗的。再一個吐槽的是入住的時候被告知早飯8點以後才能吃，而且是配餐制的，給什麼吃什麼，這個對長者來説不是很友好，他們早飯吃的早。最搞笑的是第二次去吃早飯，我們老老實實等到8點，結果去那一看，已經開始了，而且這次是自助餐了，問了餐吧的服務人員理所當然地説昨天酒店就入住3個房間就不開自助餐了，今天入住率高了才能自助餐，早飯也能提早。反正我是從來沒碰到過這樣的，那入住的時候前台為啥不説清楚？早餐還收的168一位的，吃的東西品種不多，主要也就粥和醬菜，包子，麪條這種。最後退房的時候給的伴手禮是2瓶礦泉水和一本空白筆記本，2瓶礦泉水難道我還要揹回家？近2千的房價性價比不高，服務跟不上，還收了2000塊的壓金。還不如去住柏悦或者康得思，邊上花間堂也行，好歹房價便宜點。

管家小劉也很周到，來的路上就發了定位，chenk in 和離店都很絲滑，房間也是舒服的，地理位置有優勢，出門就能看湖也能兜兜逛逛，現在早餐是自助了，的確樣數不多，但感覺食材品質都不錯，自己習慣吃的幾樣都有也就滿足了，咖啡還會拉個花，老街的早餐感覺沒啥，還是酒店吃衞生又有保障；房間設備都還不錯，唯一建議是浴缸要安裝扶手，有長者泡澡進出很怕滑到，雙人間的泡澡球要給2隻比較好、以及第二天沒有補充還是麻煩管家給送房間的，再來房間mini bar可以考慮多放兩瓶礦泉水，這個季節要開空調晚上比較幹
有機會再來韓嶺還是會考慮住這裏的
