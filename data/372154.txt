msg:The room was very nice and the view from the balcony was stunning. But there were multiple issues. It took them 40 minutes to check-in, at which time there were 2 power outages. The phone in my room didn‚Äôt work, and there were issues with scanning the room service QR code. There was left over food in my fridge also. There is also the issue of false advertising regarding the infinity pool which is non-existent. To top it all off, at 01:00, the fire alarm went off in my room for no reason.

The staff are very nice, particularly Harry the lifeguard who went out of his way on multiple occasions to help me when I injured my finger. 

The issue regarding a lack of English speakers in SanYa is true.

msg:Pros: 

‚Ä¢Good location in the main town of Sanya so it's easy to get to shopping areas and restaurants.
‚Ä¢Close to one of the main beaches.
‚Ä¢Dinner buffet keeps food like sashimi in contained areas for cleanliness. 
‚Ä¢Coffee at the lobby bar is nice.
‚Ä¢ Nice gym

Cons:
‚Ä¢ The breakfast here is terrible. Unless you like congee, you get a very limited options of food overall and only about three western options - sausage, egg, and bacon (poor quality bacon at that)
‚Ä¢ ineffective staff at breakfast. We arrived for breakfast at 9:30am (a busy time) and were scanned through despite there being 0 tables available and very limited help from the staff just standing around.
‚Ä¢ Terrible coffee at the breakfast.
‚Ä¢ Want to relax and sit by the pool? Good luck with that as there are only 12 sunbeds next to the pool! A shockingly poor amount for a hotel with so many people.
‚Ä¢ Things like toilet paper wasn't replaced upon cleaning two times.
‚Ä¢ Swimming pool was freezing! 
‚Ä¢ Everything is in Chinese. I'm glad I was with my partner because there wasn't a single thing translated into English.

Overall, I do not recommend this hotel unless you are actively seeking somewhere that might be cheaper than the better options available in Sanya.

Full of fun toys for the the children too. The swimming pool is a great temperature! Pools towels are easy to get. Life guards are friendly!!! Swimming rings available. Bubble machine.

The blind between the bathroom and the bedroom offers minimal privacy. The breakfast offers a wide range of foods that are mostly Chinese with some western options. When asked they were able to make an omelette. Most western options are baked sweets, fried eggs, cheap bacon and sausage. In the top floor lounge the carpets are disgusting and need a cleaning. Cream carpet nearly black in high traffic areas. The breakfast area carpeting was also badly in need of cleaning. The view from our rooms was lovely. The pool was nice, cool and relaxing.  The kids playroom is a small room with  a slide and balls, good for a toddler but no idea how often it is cleaned.

The hotel and its interior is not new but very well maintained and clean. The price is a bit high but the location and sea view certainly justify the price level.

Obviously should have checked it more carefully before but the picture of the view from the hotel and from the corner room looked great. We asked for another room to avoid the view on the building in the lower floor but had to pay for an upgrade, without any commercial compensation despite the obvious difference between the room pictures and the reality. 

The beach is much nicer just a few km north and closer to the airport.

This part of Sanya was not crowded when I was there,  in fact until I visited other parts of the island,  I had no idea it was the busy season.

A very average experience, nothing extra when it came to hospitality, service or any sense of a luxury hotel. More like a local hotel than an international hotel.
Great views and quite good location. The hotel does not have any sun beds on the beach like e.g. Pullman.  Rooms are clean and have small balconies without any furniture. A quite small pool plus a pool for children. A whirlpool out of use. Some sun beds. No pool bar or pool restaurant. OK gym with good machines but only dumbbells as free weights. Lounge with great views but extremely slow and unstable service. Breakfast is good but be quick since many things are not enough and they don¬¥t top up. OK and somewhat cheaper hotel if you don¬¥t intend to spend too much time on the hotel anyway.

I called the front desk but no one answered. I called the switchboard but no one answered. There was no one on duty at all. It was hot and stuffy in Sanya in May. How could I sleep? There were also bugs on the bed. They seemed to be betel nut bugs. They were poisonous! I felt itchy right after I was bitten. I scratched it and it was gone. Who would have thought that the bag would get bigger and more itchy. Nothing worked, so I pinched the bag hard to squeeze out the venom! Do you know how painful it is? It still itched after pinching! Oh my god, my legs were scratched! Can I still stay in this hotel? It‚Äôs terribleüò±

Finally, the hotel did not have a robot, and you had to go downstairs to get the takeaway by yourself. This can be upgraded.

It was very close to the beach, just across a road. The swimming pool was also very clean. The person in charge of the swimming pool was very dedicated. The swimming ring for the child was not suitable, so when we asked for it, he took the initiative to give us several swimming rings. He kept observing the child for fear that he would choke on water or something else. The buffet breakfast was okay, not particularly outstanding. I stayed in several hotels in Sanya this time, and the Sheraton was very comfortable.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank Miss Liu Haiyun at the front desk for helping me upgrade my room.
The hotel is in a great location. The beach and the sea are right outside the door. There are also shopping malls with normal prices nearby. The only drawback of the location is that you have to go around the traffic lights to go to the beach.

Environment: The rooms are fully equipped with various facilities. Compared with the Crowne Plaza Resort Hotel and Wenchang Hilton where I have stayed before, the advantage of the hotel is that the corridor is not outdoor, which avoids the trouble of being caught in the rain when leaving the room. The hotel can also order various supplies, such as toilet water, scissors, etc., which is very popular. The only drawback was the TV. I didn‚Äôt know how to connect it via HDMI with my laptop. The HDMI port next to the table seemed to be a decoration with no use, so I gave up later. It is recommended to add a mop in the bathroom. The seal on the bathroom glass door is not tight enough and the water gradually flows out after taking a bath. You can prepare a mop so that I can handle it myself with my obsessive-compulsive disorder. The balcony is relatively small and not too decorated.

Facilities: The hotel's elevators are very powerful and very fast. The hotel has 29 floors above ground and the 2 underground floors are still very fast. The disadvantage is the underground garage. B1 is not allowed to park, the charging pile is not accessible to the outside, and the entrance and exit of the garage are too narrow. It may also be my first time to drive a B-class car. The model is too large, and I was very nervous when driving into the basement.

The breakfast was quite satisfactory, with almost no seafood. Next time I don‚Äôt want to bring breakfast, I‚Äôll try the KFC next door.

Someone just came over to give us the room card, so we asked him to forty We came over to change after a few minutes. After taking a shower, we went out. When we came back, we threw the quilt cover on the chair and the shaver we ordered was randomly thrown on the table. With no other choice, we contacted Ctrip customer service and asked the hotel staff to come and help. After taking it away, we went to the 28th floor to have some drinks.

Everything is nearby, it‚Äôs very interesting and beautiful! We liked!)
The hotel pool is small but clean, there is a children's pool, they provide swimming circles, and there are a lot of toys in the sandbox. There are two lifeguards on duty, this is, of course, a purely Chinese trait: a bunch of lifeguards for a shallow pool))
The playroom for children is good, with a large pool with balls, toys, in general, children will have a good time there.
Therefore, not the newest furniture did not bother us. There are actually significantly more advantages. In general, thanks to this hotel, we had a pleasant experience!

There are many restaurants and shops behind the hotel, making it convenient to travel. Opposite the Coconut Dream Corridor, there is constant dancing in the square every morning until nine o'clock in the evening, which is a bit noisy. I think the hotel should think of ways to soundproof the doors.

msg:Facilities: The decoration is relatively old-school, but the style is quite comfortable to live in. I live in a sea view room on a higher floor with a balcony. It feels really good to face the sea when I wake up. I don‚Äôt close the balcony door when I sleep at night. It is also very pleasant to listen to the sound of the waves and blow the sea breeze.

Hygiene: The room is very clean, with normal hotel hygiene standards. Although the room is facing the sea, it does not smell damp or moldy.

Environment: There is a swimming pool outside the lobby bar on the first floor of the hotel. Although there are many people in Sanya during the Chinese New Year, it may be because the hotel is directly outside the Coconut Dream Corridor, so there are few people in the swimming pool and it is very comfortable to play.
Just across the road from the hotel is the Coconut Dream Corridor. The Coconut Dream Corridor is actually a coastline with many coconut trees. The coastline is very long. There are many people on the beach opposite the hotel. If you want to take pictures or be quieter, it is recommended to go to the beach before 5 pm. Or walk a little further along the sidewalk with coconut trees in both directions, but it may be a bit sunny.
After taking the photo, you can take a look at the sunset. There is an island right at the sunset, which looks beautiful.

Service: I really need to focus on the service. Because of my personal injury, it was very inconvenient to move around, and there was a lot of time between flight and check-out, so I had to ask the hotel for help. Originally, I planned to add an hourly room, but Before and after the Spring Festival, the housing supply was tight and the room price was high. It was not cost-effective to extend the hourly room. Jerry Chen from the hotel was very considerate and helped me extend my check-out time. He also continued to pay attention to my injury and asked if I needed help. I have to say this service is great. It really warms my heart. I am very grateful to Jerry Chen for his help. I am very happy about my stay. I will stay here again next time I come to Sanya!

I am very satisfied with manager Jerry Chen's professional, patient, meticulous and thoughtful service. When I asked for his help several times, he served us with enthusiasm and fully considered the customer. Although he caused a lot of trouble himself, he was able to help me solve the problem with the optimal solution. I am very satisfied with him. Thank you again for the attentive butler-like service. At the same time, I am also very satisfied with the efficient service of the hotel restaurant manager, female greeter and staff. There are many people eating during the morning peak, but they can quickly prepare food so that everyone can eat delicious food quickly. AMY, the housekeeper on the floor where I live, is also great. The room is very clean, she takes the trouble to serve the guests, and even folds a towel for the child.
I was introduced to the hotel by my colleagues at work, and I wanted to give it a try. My experience in staying at the hotel for a few days was very good. I hope that next time I come to Sanya, I can stay at the Four Points by Sheraton and get the service of manager Jerry Chen.

msg:Let‚Äôs talk about the advantages first: First of all, I would like to express my special thanks to the staff at the concierge. On the day of check-out, I had to catch up with the marathon road control. I was a little anxious to catch the flight with my children. First, a young man helped me determine the route and book the car (I forgot to look (his name), I felt a lot more at ease. On the day of check-out, driver Hou Yichun came to the lobby early to wait for us. The young man Luo Maosheng took my checked box and baby stroller in one hand and walked us to Qingchunli Square a few hundred meters away to get on the bus. , Master Hou drove the car smoothly and paid special attention to the temperature inside the car. Seeing that I was carrying a baby, he sent me to the nearest door for check-in and enthusiastically helped me with my luggage. Thank you againüôèSecondly, I personally feel that the hotel chef is very good , I felt quite comfortable eating. The casserole porridge for breakfast was quite unique, and I didn‚Äôt get tired of it even after eating it for three days. I also had a barbecue at the 29th floor lounge, which was delicious and reasonably priced (6 oysters, 6 scallops, 2 saury, 6 skewers of mutton, 1 corn and 1 eggplant cost 187 yuan in total); Third, the sea view of the hotel is really great, the location is good, and it is convenient for eating and traveling.
Let's talk about the room. The facilities are a bit old, but overall it's clean. I can accept it. It's just a traditional hotel. Personally, I feel it has no merit. It's not a highlight, but it's not dirty. I can vaguely feel it. It should have been brilliant in the early days of opening~
Finally, let me talk about the areas that I personally feel the hotel needs to improve on. First, the smell of the hotel when I first entered is really hard to describe...it smells bad...like a toilet cleaner? Furthermore, when I made a reservation, I called to make a note about the baby playpen and single quilt, but... the room was not prepared at all when I checked in... Later, I called the room and slowly arranged it... and the young man at the front desk who checked in, It seems that I have been working hard, but my efficiency is not high. I wonder if it‚Äôs because the interns don‚Äôt make the decision. They habitually push outside and speak in a low voice...
How should I put it? No hotel can be perfect. When traveling, happiness is important. Discover more beautiful places~ If I had contacted the concierge staff first, I should have given 5 points, but because of the characteristics of the hotel, I had to contact them first. The front desk, so it is inappropriate to give a rating of 5~

Hygiene: Very clean. When I went out, I found that I had checked out of the hotel a while ago and all the sheets had been taken off and replaced. It was very clean and comfortable. It must be praised.

Environment: You can see Sanya Phoenix Island upstairs, and you can see the beach downstairs. The surrounding area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is also very prosperous and convenient. The supporting parking lot must be praised!

I will stay at the Four Points by Sheraton Sanya next time I have the opportunity.

Cleanliness: The room is very clean
Environment: Across the road from the beach, the lounge on the 29th floor has an unparalleled view of the sea (my friend came to pick me up and told me to go up, otherwise I would miss such a view). Of course, if you book a sea view room, you can see it without going to the 29th floor.
Service: Haiyun service is very good, because I made a reservation before arriving at the hotel. When I went to the front desk to check in, my reservation number had not yet been issued. Haiyun very attentively asked me to go to the sofa in the lobby to rest for a few minutes and then check in after the reservation number came out. In addition, you can upgrade your room for free. Haiyun helped arrange a high floor on the 25th floor, which is very comfortable. Since my flight was after 11 o'clock in the evening, I asked if I could delay my check-out. Haiyun looked at the room status and very considerately helped me delay my check-out until 3 o'clock. When I come back from a scenic spot and I‚Äôm sweating, I can still wash up before checking outüëç

Xiao Duan at the front desk and Xiao Hu at the service center praised each other for helping solve some minor problems, and the service was particularly good.
In addition, as a hotel that has been open for about ten years now, the sanitary conditions are really excellent.

In general, all aspects are truly worthy of the Marriott Hotel Group's background, and it is worth coming back!

You can go to the old town to eat local food by walking downstairs. After all, it costs a lot of money to go out to eat and take a taxi back and forth when staying in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay.

msg:This time when I went to Sanya, I didn‚Äôt stay in a place like Haitang Bay or Yalong Bay. I chose a hotel in the city. This hotel is slightly older than the ones in the first two bays, but the room is quite big. I would like to thank Freya Xiaohai at the front desk for her help and upgraded the room and gave me a small gift. I am very happy. The luxurious sea view is very spacious. Unfortunately, it rained every day in Sanya during the past few days, and the weather was not good. The hotel is a bit far away from the most popular CDF duty-free shop on the island, about 40 to 50 kilometers away. You can call the hotel front desk to make a reservation one day in advance, and you can also receive threshold-free vouchers. There are two shuttle buses every morning and afternoon. The boarding point is the bus station across the road from the hotel. There are several buses at the same station that can take you directly to the first market. It is very convenient to eat seafood, buy fruits and drink Ajuqing tonic. , colorful steamed buns are also sold there.
The hotel elevator is a bit slow, the swimming pool is outdoors, and the indoor fitness center is in the ba*****t. It is small, a bit stuffy, and has a slight smell. The breakfast options are not too many but enough. The butter croissant is delicious and fragrant.
As for the room, the bed is big, and the air conditioning and shower are very powerful. Auntie cleans up in an orderly and clean manner every day.
There is a shopping mall at the first left turn on the left side of the hotel, where you can find Pizza Hut, KFC, Luckin Coffee, Miniso and large supermarkets. But after a quick look, I found that Hainan specialties (Chunguang, Nanguo, Changmao) in supermarkets are not as cheap as roadside private stores.
By the way, a final reminder, try to buy one with free cancellation. We found out 2 days in advance that there is a blind box sea view room, which is cheaper than the normal discount price we booked! It is recommended that you do some comparisons before departure and choose the most cost-effective one!

However, there are many ingenuities in the room which are not bad, but it is still recommended to decorate immediately. The hotel service is very average. I confirmed it with the customer service on Ctrip in advance and hope to try my best to arrange the room type. I requested a room on a higher floor in the hotel, and the hotel customer service agreed that they had made a note for me. When I arrived at the hotel, the front desk said that they had not seen such a note, and that only rooms on lower floors could arrange for my immediate check-in. High floors required I had to wait for an hour to finish cleaning before I could check in, but it was already 4:30 in the afternoon. Which hotel has ordered this and the room hasn't been cleaned yet? I also asked for birthday decorations in the room, but the customer service ignored me at all. Of course, they were not decorated when I checked in. The sanitary environment in the hotel room is very good, and there are many small details that are nice, but the outdoor swimming pool of the hotel is dirty and messy. , all kinds of debris, hair and floating objects in the swimming pool look very eye-catching; I am most satisfied with the hotel environment. The sea view in the deluxe sea view room is very good, and you can watch the sunset in the evening.

It was much more comfortable than the hotel we stayed in a few days ago. When we went out, we could see the sea and step on the beach across the street. The building is an outdoor swimming pool, but the water temperature is a bit low. The 1-year-old baby felt a little cold and was reluctant to play in the water, so he played in the sand digging area next to it for a while. There is a large round bathtub indoors, which is suitable for bathing the baby, üëç There is a simple children's playground on the first floor. I feel that it would be better if more children can play. Let's talk about food: we ate out two days ago. After we moved in, there was a family seafood set in the package. In fact, it was the same as the food. The expectations were a bit different. I personally felt that it did not reflect the local characteristics or the characteristics of the seafood. There was also a ten-inch burger in the set meal. The portion was very large. We, three adults and one child, could not finish it.

This is not the first time I have stayed here because the location is great and the environment is comfortable.
But, what is surprising is the service.
When I checked in before, the hotel breakfast I had was not very good, so that was it.
But this time I checked in because I arrived at the store after 2pm and I was very hungry.
Ask the front desk where else you can eat in the hotel.
The front desk replied: Only the 29th floor is available.
I went to the 29th floor and was told that I could order food. However, it will take 1 hour at the fastest!
I'm surprised that today, it actually takes another hour?

It feels like they don't need to sleep every day. Do you drag the stool for entertainment? It is recommended to use shock-absorbing stickers on the legs of stools and sofas to prevent the harsh sound of dragging from affecting the downstairs residents. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, and it is a bit tired to eat for three days. If the noise from upstairs can be improved, I will choose here again in the future.

Breakfast can be eaten until 10:30, and there are many types. After eating, go directly to the beach to dig sand. Compared with other star hotel chains, the hardware facilities are a bit outdated.

I don't remember how many times I have stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton, so I don't need to say much about the overall satisfaction. But I still want to write a review, in order to thank every new employee of the hotel who has worked so hard, just like the beauty manager Freya Liu I met this time, although she is so busy, she is like an old friend. So specific that I remember that you like to put two chairs on the balcony to watch the sea view, and I will recommend you the most distinctive restaurant with a view that will not step on thunder.

I traveled all over the world in search of the most beautiful scenery, and finally found that the most beautiful is a smiling face and a greeting. It's about... both the journey and life.

By the way, there is no lobby, check-in is on the second floor, and there is a small counter.
The beach is separated by a road, which is close.

msg:I know this is an old hotel that has been open for many years, so I already had expectations that it would be very old before I checked in, but I still chose this place. On the one hand, it was already very late to leave the airport, and the first night was the transition to Sanya Bay not far away. It is also convenient to go to the scenic spots of Nanshan on the west line the next day; on the other hand, this hotel may have the most invincible sea view in Sanya. . When I arrived at the hotel, I found out that it had been renovated, and the facilities were completely acceptable. And the sea view really lives up to its reputation. Compared with the sea view rooms of those high-end hotels in Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay, the advantage of hotels along Sanya Bay is that they are very close to the sea, and Four Points by Sheraton is the highest among them. If you live in a room above the twentieth floor and open the balcony door, you will almost have a sea in your eyes, the shocking power is indescribable. Downstairs is the Haiyue Square, a holy place for square dancing. However, there are fewer people on the beach in Sanya in May. It is very comfortable to go for a walk on the beach at night. The parking lot is underground, with a lot of parking spaces and a reasonable design, which is very suitable for self-driving travel.

The small desk lamp for work is very convenient to deal with work at night, and it will not be too bright üîÜ to respond to falling asleep. The bathroom is separated from the room by a glass wall, so that when you take a bath in the bathtub, you can raise the curtain to directly enjoy the sea view outside the balcony. It's very nice, but it's embarrassing to find the ventilation switch in the bathroom for a while...
Hygiene: The bathroom is clean and tidy, and there is no peculiar smell. Although the bedding is close to the beach, there is no damp and musty smell. Just after staying for a while, there happened to be a staff member who inspected termites. It seemed that the inspection was carried out uniformly, so I felt more at ease about the safety of the stay.
Environment: I am rushing to open the window to see the sea. The room has a 180¬∞ sea view. You can directly see several small Phoenix egg buildings on Phoenix Island. Under the balcony is the Lover's Bridge, the bay is full of yachts, some are galloping through the waves, some are swaying, and you can also see the technical school who painted ‚ù§Ô∏è, and you can have a panoramic view of the beautiful scenery of the sea and the sky
Service: The check-in time is 3 o'clock. When we arrived at 1 o'clock, the cleaning of the hotel had not been completed. We were upgraded to a room, but we saw that there was a better location (for example, No. 16-19 on each floor). After requesting to change rooms, The floor was changed to No. 18 on the 25th floor. The view is wider and the viewing position is better. I am very satisfied!
Entering the hotel lobby is on the 2nd floor. When you get on the elevator, there is a little brother in green clothes who will help you push your luggage, and also when you leave. There is also luggage storage, which makes it very convenient for you to stay for only one night (there is another itinerary the next day).

msg:Check in on March 2, to make up for the feeling of watching the sunset in Sanya Bay and yearning to live here 10 years ago.
Arrived a little after 1:00 p.m., the road at the bottom of the parking lot was quite a test for wide cars, checked into the first room at 3:00, and checked into the second room at 4:00, it was quite torturous for the children to wake up while waiting to check in. There are two rooms on the left and right of the elevator entrance on the 20th floor. Because the roadside will sing and dance until 9:30 in the evening and the sound of cars passing by, the sound of the elevator can't be heard at all, and it doesn't affect the rest. It's a pity that the only swimming pool is not heated. Children The only place to play is a hut with ocean balls and slides. If you go to the beach, walk a few steps and wait for the traffic lights to cross the road. The wide view can make up for this. The concierge brother was attentive and accompanied me to the ba*****t to pick up my luggage. Breakfast starts at 6:30, and meals are allowed to catch a flight at 6:20.

However, the attitude of the check-in person in the lobby is very bad and impatient. This is the first time I have encountered such a bad experience, because the last time I stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton Sanya Bay, this time I did not consider other direct bookings , As a result, the service attitude made me too disappointed, and I probably won't order again in the future.

Facilities: old, exactly the same as the first time, nothing has changed in 5 years!
Hygiene: Very poor, and it is also an important reason why I gave a bad review this time! On the night of check-in on the 24th, I smelled a strong urine smell next to the pillow as soon as I went to bed at night. I called the service staff to confirm that the mattress smelled like urine!
Service: When checking in, a fat man who should be the lobby manager has a very good attitude and is very patient. The attitude of the staff at check-in is also very good! Here comes the key point. I called the housekeeping depar**ent at ten o'clock that night to report that there was a smell of urine on the bed. It took fifteen minutes to come. During this period, I called once to remind me because the child wanted to sleep and kept making noises! After checking it, the waiter said to contact someone to solve it, and left! After waiting for 20 minutes and no one came, I called again to urge the housekeeping depar**ent to just say patiently and ignore me this time! Didn't change room until eleven o'clock in the evening! I don't get it. Does it take that long to change rooms? And you have come to confirm that the bed is indeed smelly! No one apologized or explained until I left the store! Disappointed, I will never stay at a Marriott hotel again!

This is the first time You need to queue up for breakfast, the carpet is dirty, the trash cans are similar to those on the roadside on the street, the cleaning supplies are not as good as the roadside guest houses, and the mini bar is ridiculous.

A suggestion: There are too few chairs in the room, only one. It is recommended to add more chairs. There are two chairs on the balcony before, so that it is convenient to enjoy the sea view. Also, the restaurant is too small, maybe due to the surge in the number of people coming to Sanya, some of them cannot handle it. There is a queue in the morning.

Finally, thanks to Xiao Ai, who learned that our flight was late and helped us extend the time for free, thank you very much. I was very happy during my trip to Sanya, and I will stay in this invincible sea view room in the futureüëçüèª

msg:This is the second time I have stayed in this hotel this year. I booked a twin room with twin beds. Both rooms are large, but the sound insulation is not good, and the noise of children often comes from next door.
There are not many people in December. Chris**as used to be the peak season, but now no one goes there. It‚Äôs very leisurely to walk on the beach, but it‚Äôs a bit cold to go into the sea.
The Starry Sky Bar on the 29th floor of the hotel is worth a visit. Go there at 5:00 pm to have a glass of beer and watch the sunset...

Since I booked an evening flight, I wanted to find a nearby hotel with a relatively high cost performance to stay for one night first. The Four Points by Sheraton I chose this time was surprisingly good. I booked a sea view room. The view couldn't be better. I like it very much. The overall corridor of the hotel feels a bit old, but the room is still very good, and the bedding is very comfortable. When you go out and cross the road, you will see Haiyue Square, and then the sea. I really like it

They have a kind of love for work exuded from the bottom of their bones. They regard the hotel as their home and their work as their own business. They never get tired or slack off.

msg:I booked Sanya Bay for a business trip. The Sanya Bay Hotel is relatively old. The 180-degree sea view room was upgraded for free due to the low season, which is not bad.
The following is a complaint:
1. The hot water in the bathtub and the hot water in the shower are released randomly. It should not be possible to put hot water on both sides at the same time. On the first day, I left the shower for several minutes without hot water, so I almost took a cold shower. The drain valve under the bathtub was broken the next day, and the front desk said I couldn't operate it, so I finally found a repairman to fix it.
2. Ask the front desk how long it will take to get the laundry when you make an appoin**ent. If you don‚Äôt say life or death, you must go back to the guest room and use the landline in the room to call. Okay, go back to the room and use the landline to make calls, but the landline is also broken. I went to Ctrip and called the front desk again. At this moment, the front desk can tell me how long it will take to get the laundry, and it will take almost 24 hours before I can pick it up.
3. The room is dark. This is a common problem of Sheraton. It may be so dark if I didn't book an executive room. I don't deserve it.

In short, it is not recommended to live in Sanya Bay when traveling, and it is not recommended to live in Sheraton in Sanya Bay.

After receiving us, they helped us introduce the situation in Sanya and the delicious food near the hotel. Really dedicated.
When the front desk checked in, they said that we could not stay in the hotel from Suzhou, and we were all blinded. The area where our home is located is normalized, and there is no epidemic at all. Later, it was the pick-up staff who assisted the front desk to help us check in, and he was a false alarm and almost went to the quarantine hotel.
After checking in the room, I feel that the house is really old and musty, but the sea view is really good. We have stayed in many hotels in Sanya. This Sheraton is really in a good location, sitting on the sofa on the 26th floor Looking towards the sea, I thought that I lived on the sea, it was really close to the sea, maybe it was because it was too close to the sea, and the musty smell was caused by the humidity.
The cleaning lady we met during our stay was also very nice, warm and welcoming.
There is no self-service breakfast, it is delivered to the room, which is said to be affected by the epidemic.
In general, this hotel is in an excellent location, with everything to eat downstairs, supermarkets, restaurants, pharmacies, very convenient, the first time you come to Sanya and want to see the sea view, you can choose boldly, the scenery is first-class, you must choose the one facing the sea A row of rooms, the city view should be a lot less.
Across the road is the Yemeng Corridor, which is very convenient for children to play in the sand and catch the sea.
The service is also five-star standard.
The downside is that the room is a bit outdated, it would be great if the facilities were updated a bit!

After arriving, manager Chen Jin at the front desk is very helpful~
After understanding the needs, he helped us upgrade the room type and gave us a breakfast, a super happy trip üòÑ
The room type this time is still a room with a frontal view of the sea~
Everyone must book a sea view room~ You can see the sea from the bed~
Looking at the surrounding hotels, only Four Points has a room with a frontal view of the sea ~ there is no obstruction ~
Buffet ~ swimming pool ~ Thai SPA service attitude is quite good ~ worth a try ~
There is a nucleic acid testing point in the hospital in the southern war zone next to it, which is very convenient~
There is also a 5% discount coupon for going to the duty-free shop~
Next time I go, I will choose Four Points by Sheraton~
Check out the photo I took on the balcony, it's gorgeous!

msg:In the last two days of Sanya, I chose Four Points by Sheraton in the urban area. The main consideration was the convenience of eating and shopping. At first, I wanted to choose Kangnian, but there were too many people and I didn‚Äôt want to join in the fun.
Hotel advantages:
1. The location of the hotel is good, it is very convenient to eat and shop, and it is also convenient to do nucleic acid, hahaha
2. Next to Sanya Bay, the sea view and night view are very nice. You can see several high-rise buildings on Phoenix Island. Going downstairs and crossing the Makou is the Yemeng Corridor and the beach. The sunset is really beautiful, but there are too many people and the beach is not very clean. , but that can't blame the hotel
3. Jerry Chen at the front desk has a good service attitude. Hearing about the flight at night, he took the initiative to help me apply for check-out until 3 pm, and gave me 4 Starbucks discount coupons
4. The cleaning aunt is very kind,
shortcoming:
1. The hotel area is small, the room area is also small, the facilities are aging, and there is no novelty, especially the black floor tiles in the room, which refreshed my cognition. The doors of the wardrobe and the safe are too worn out.
2. There is a musty smell in the room. I read the reviews before I stayed, and the result was not a good idea. I applied for a room change later. Thanks to the service brother for his help
3. There are almost no children's amu*****t facilities, the swimming pool is pitifully small, the little brother at the front desk said that they are the main business...
4. The room cooling effect is not good
Can't remember the others

In short, you can choose this place for business trips. If you are traveling with your family or with children, forget it. I feel that there is nothing good except the location.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. Opposite is Haiyue Square, and it is just around the corner to Jiefang Road. The price of a taxi from the first seafood market is only more than 10 yuan. It is convenient to have a car to go to major attractions. There are also many restaurants around. The disadvantage is that the facilities are a bit old and the room is a bit musty. However, this is a small problem. The biggest problem is that this hotel does not have any sense of service, and it is lacking in all aspects. Ms. Liu at the front desk received us with a black face and no smile. , which is far from the expectation of an international chain of high-end hotels. Moreover, she only authorized our car to enter and exit for free for one day. It rained heavily the next morning, and we had to go to the front desk to extend the authorization of vehicle entry and exit in the rain. She also received the check-out at the end. When I came up, she asked me if I remembered the room number. It's really strange. Can't you know if you scan the card at the front desk? Why interrogate guests? Another oddity is the restaurant, yes, the breakfast. Seats on the first day were grabbed, chaotic, noisy, and guests were forced to line up at the restaurant entrance because there were no seats available. Every day, the restaurant welcomes guests and asks coldly, how many people are in your room? ! No two plus one, you just need to charge more. The interrogation looks like you are on top of yourself. Is it interesting to look down on the guests? There are both Chinese and Western breakfasts, but the varieties are relatively simple and the quality is not high, especially the drinks, which are really low-quality and speechless.

1. Transportation: It is located in Haiyue Square, which is the city center. 20 minutes to the airport, 15 minutes to the train station. It is a 5-minute walk to the Food Street of Foreign Trade Road, and a 3-minute walk to the Womei Supermarket next to it. It is not too convenient.
2. Hygiene: The room is simple and clean, and the most important thing is to respond quickly to anything.
3. Catering: The hotel's breakfast is delicious, and the taste is very suitable for people from all walks of life. I ate a bowl of Hainan noodle soup, which was very refreshing. I drank two glasses of beer on the 29th floor in the evening. The price is very moderate, suitable for playing games on it. ,Kill time.
4. Service: I am also a member of Marriott. This time I have upgraded to a sea view room, which is 180 degrees. I am very satisfied. When I left, because the plane was at night, the staff at the front desk was very considerate and helped me get a late check-out. I must thank Freya‚ù§.
5. I came back to read the online reviews after I was very satisfied with my stay. Fortunately, I only watched it after I lived, otherwise I really didn't have the courage to choose. It can only be said that seeing it once is better than hearing it, you can only know if it is good or not if you have lived there yourself. I will definitely choose this hotel in the futureüëçüëçüëç, I will come back!

msg:One day in advance, I saw a lot of bad reviews of the hotel, and I didn't know where to book. I booked this hotel when I saw it by the sea. When I got to the place, I found out that it was really nice. The sea is just across the road! ! ! There is an underground parking lot when you enter the hotel (you have to tell the front desk that it should be free, I only found out after walking and paying for it), the room type I booked is for the view of the sea, and the front desk is very considerate to help me arrange it on the 22nd floor to overlook the large scenery , the room is also very clean, there are free üßä drinks, and the buffet in the morning is very good. The breakfast in many holiday hotels with similar prices is not as good as this. If you want to talk about the angle of the sea, just look at what I took, there is no need to go to those hotels around 2-3K, this is really great! I come to Hainan every year and will definitely come to stay next year

msg:Check into tomorrow's hospital today! Junk hotel can't give a negative score. The hotel is old and broken. I want to check out when I open the door of the room with a damp smell. Now I think the most regretful decision is that I didn't check out decisively. I woke up in the morning and found that my body was bitten more than ten times. A bag, and the two children who stayed together were also bitten by different degrees of bag. At first I thought it was a mosquito bite and didn't care too much. The bag bitten at night was painful, itchy, and similar to blisters. The next day, the bag burst and watery secretions flowed out. It felt wrong. I seriously suspected that there was a problem with the hotel bedding. I contacted the hotel and said that it is recommended to seek medical trea**ent. It takes 72 hours for nucleic acid to see a doctor in Sanya Hospital (nucleic acid results will take 6-12 hours to get results and then I have to catch a plane to leave Hainan the next day). I can only endure the pain and itching and go back to my city. Get medical attention. Doctors diagnose mite bites, mite dermatitis. We stayed in other hotels in Hainan and stayed in this hotel for one night. All three of us were bitten by mites. We all came to Hainan for many days and finally came to Sanya, and there were no problems such as being unsuitable for the weather, soil and water or physical fitness. Can the hotel still say that there is no problem with the hygiene of the bedding? All kinds of shirk responsibility, do not recognize health problems and refuse to bear medical expenses. The solution given by the hotel is to upgrade my room and send fruit and red wine to my next stay. It's outrageous, I dare to live again? ? ? Check into tomorrow's hospital today? ? ? Excuse me if you think about it. I will really thank you... The whole trip from Haikou to Wanning to Sanya, there is no hotel that smells damp like Four Points by Sheraton. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed inüëéüèª. With this attitude, I will never stay in any Marriott-branded hotel chain from now on.
üßπHygiene: Dirty, the room smells of dampness, the bed was bitten by mites all night. The breakfast utensils were visibly old and not cleaned.

The hotel is just across the road from the beach and it is very convenient to travel. Just staying in the first room, I faced the air-conditioning vent and blew on my face and head for one night, but I got up and turned off the air-conditioning in the middle of the night and woke us up again. With the assistance of Ctrip's butler, I changed the room the next day (like them and add chicken drumsticks). During the stay, I often encountered small problems. The hotel and Ctrip's butler have been helping to solve the problem. Thank you very much.

msg:Because of the epidemic in Shanghai, I have lived in Sanya for almost 3 months, of which I have lived in Four Points Sheraton for 2 months, and I have already lived here as my home. I really want to praise and take care of me. My little brothers and sisters, wherever you go, everyone is smiling. The service that the regular guests really get is better than any top luxury hotel I have stayed in before (the 6 Marriott hotels in front of me)
Originally, I changed a hotel for almost a few days. The hotel lobby manager, Chen Jin Jerry, was very, very nice. The trea**ent I enjoyed was no worse than that of other Marriott hotels. He patiently and promptly helped me solve any requests I made. It improved my stay experience, I have been here to renew my stay, and other hotels rushed to get to know me. Every time I renew my stay, it was very, very good.
The eldest sisters in the housekeeping depar**ent also took good care of me, especially Wang Qixue. She took care of me 80% of the time, and she was the one I had the most contact with. She smiled every day and made me feel good every day. In addition, although Miss Amy was in short contact, she immediately helped me to solve my urgent needs. I really needed a little aroma in the room, and gave me the only aromatherapy air purifier in the hotel, as well as a humidifier.
The most touching thing for me is the breakfast. The service staff and chefs in the restaurant almost all know me, and they really take special care of me. When I want to eat lettuce, they will cook it for me, and they chat with me almost every day. , The little brother who cuts the fruit surprises me every day. Not only the combination is rich, but the plate is very beautiful. It's super super, and I look forward to having breakfast every day.
It takes 5 minutes to walk downstairs to the beach. The most beautiful place to watch the sunset is here. Because of "working from home", every time I get tired and look at the sea outside the window, I feel full of relief. This location, the suite is really good, the gym is also great, the scenery is beautiful, the price is still cheap, the first choice for permanent residents, the king of cost performance! ! !

msg:Listen to my advice, don't come to this hotel. On May 29th, I didn't book the hotel in advance because I was temporarily going to work near Jinjiling Road in Sanya. Plus, I have a Marriott Gold Membership Card and it's nearby on Ctrip. Booked this hotel, it was the first time I stayed at this so-called Marriott hotel
First, the intersection of the hotel gate, I drove around 3 times to find it, because it is really huge, if I hadn't asked the uncle of the security next to me, I guess I still couldn't find it, just this intersection leading to the hotel gate would be completely Not like a 5 star hotel
Second, the entrance to the parking lot is very narrow. I just adjusted the direction for a long time before entering. When I got off the underground garage, I had to be very focused so as not to touch the wall next to it.
Third, the service of the receptionist at the front desk of the hotel is very good. I have to say that the check-in counter is smaller than the depar**ent store counter in the 1990s.
Fourth, the external sanitation environment of the entire hotel is extremely poor, the glass curtain wall is full of watermarks and dust, and the supporting facilities in the hotel are not cleaned by anyone, which looks very run-down. In addition, don't believe those popular Internet celebrities who say that the spiral staircase is not at all. Not open, not even the crystal lights of the spiral staircase
Fifth, and the point that annoys me the most, because I am a Marriott Gold member, the front desk upgraded me to a so-called supreme sea view room. When I arrived at the room, the first thing I felt was that the room facilities were very old, although your hotel has opened a lot. It's been years, but it's not like you can't even clean a table and chair, right?
Next is the feeling that the whole room is very dark, and the most important thing is that the whole room is very damp, and the bed feels damp to the touch, which is very uncomfortable. Also, there is a strong musty smell in the room. Later, I contacted the front desk to let us change from the 23rd floor to the 19th floor, but it was still very humid. Because I was in a hurry to go out to do errands, I had no energy to toss any more. When I came back at night to prepare for a rest, I found that there was a hair on the pillow. This is the most disturbing. I couldn't bear it, and then contacted the front desk at 9 o'clock to change the whole set of linen. After staying in the room for more than an hour, I suddenly felt itchy all over my body. At that time, I took a rest because it was too late and didn't care. When I woke up the next day, I hurriedly checked out and returned to Haikou.
Overall, this store really doesn't deserve to be called a Marriott hotel or a five-star hotel. It's really rubbish, not even an express hotel.
Originally, I didn't want to comment, so I didn't take too many pictures of the shortcomings I mentioned above. As a result, when I was taking a shower at home tonight, I suddenly found a lot of red dots on my shoulders and back, which were extremely itchy, see the picture, There are a lot of backs but can't take pictures.
I just want to say refund now! Get your money back! Get your money back! What makes me even more strange is that the consumption in your store is not entered into the Marriott system? So what kind of Marriott do you have?

The staff needs to be trained, and the cleaning can't be called.
The quality of the spa staff on the ba*****t floor needs to be improved, so I have to recommend the items I don't want to do, because what she recommends is 100 expensive.

What kind of insects are on the 18th floor of such a big hotel? flea?

Compared with the Sheraton in a certain place, which has selected Do Not Disturb, the room service still calls the room and asks if it needs to be cleaned. . . . Four Points by Sheraton Sanya is very caring and rests well.
The disadvantage is that the air conditioner is old and the room is hot in the afternoon.

The hotel is located in Sanya Bay, with convenient transportation nearby. Don't look at the musty smell in the bad reviews. In fact, it's just a little old. Sanya Bay has been developed more than 20 years ago. The sanitation of the hotel is still very clean, and it faces the sea. Comfortable and dry. Just a little more mosquitoes hahahaha.

Next to it is the seafood street of Youyi Road. There are also Womei Supermarket and Sanya Third Farmers Market. The hotel rooms are spacious and well-equipped, the central air-conditioning is comfortable and quiet, and the showers have sufficient hot water. The sound insulation of the room is very good, but the sea view room side may be affected by the music of various old dances on the beach before 9:30 pm, so try to choose a high floor. There is an outdoor swimming pool outside the hotel on the first floor, and you can enjoy it with your baby. The only downside of the hotel is that the breakfast area is very small. The first time I encountered breakfast, I had to wait in line for a seat, and it was always queuing up from 8:30 to 10:30 every day, and the breakfast was very simple. Here I would like to thank Miss Winnie Wen at the front desk for her warm service. She fully understands the actual situation of passengers, so as to provide careful and warm service. Such a hotel staff must praise it.

msg:Check-in on January 25th and check-out on the 29th. I am a friend from Hangzhou. Booked a deluxe twin room, and was upgraded to a supreme twin room for free on the day of check-in due to the number of days booked. I am very grateful to the front desk of the hotel for this. I stayed on the 18th floor. The view is still ok, and the hygiene and daily cleaning are very satisfactory. There are not many people who use the gym on the negative first floor, and a maximum of 3 people are working out every day. On the negative first floor, there is also a horse to kill a chicken. The two people spend 366 for the service, which is good and medium. There are still quite a lot of meals around the hotel, and the Northeast Restaurant can just order more home-style dishes. I personally feel that eating seafood in Sanya is very pitiful. Don't believe in routines, it is best not to eat it. The beach in Sanya Bay is average. Although the temperature is about 28 degrees in the afternoon of January, it is still very hot. However, for the price/performance ratio of this hotel, I like it, and I will consider Four Points by Sheraton if I have the opportunity.

It is really a sea view room, which is very beautiful. The location of the hotel is very good. It is 50 meters away from Haiyue Square. Cassie at the front desk also added my WeChat, gave me two cups of Starbucks on the first floor of the hotel, and asked her a lot of questions. She is a super cute girl! The only downside is that the room's sound insulation is not very good, but this is a common problem in old hotels and can be tolerated. Anyway, it was worth it!

üßπSanitation: The room is very clean, there is no peculiar smell, and the waiter cleans it very carefully.
üîîService: The service is in place, the children need Band-Aids, and they are delivered within 2 minutes of a phone call, especially just in time for the family's birthday, cakes and greeting cards were delivered in the evening, and I liked them so carefully. The lady at the front desk, Freya, was very enthusiastic and even gave small gifts to the children.
The only downside is that there are too few places in the room that can be plugged in, but it will not affect the choice to stay here next time.

On the first day, I did not get a room upgrade with the Marriott Platinum Card. I found that the Ctrip booking was more cost-effective in the next few days, and the sea view room was facing Sanya Bay.
The friends in the hotel are very kind, and Fanny, my colleague in the front office, is very helpful and provided help during check-in.

Compared with most buildings along the way, you can see the "brilliance" of the past. üòÇ
I read the previous evaluation and said that it is free to upgrade, so I mentioned it to the gentle girl at the front desk (WeChat does not compete for steamed buns), and really agreed to help us upgrade the ocean view room, and set up a picnic mat with the kids on the balcony. Things to see the night view, the room also has a bathtub that children like, and then the hotel can go out and cross the road to play in the sand, ride a bicycle or take a walk. It is also very convenient to go to the city center to eat snacks. The overall experience is really good.
The swimming pool downstairs felt cold water. It was useless for us. After staying for two days, we didn't see anyone using it. However, it was the beach when we went out. The children stepping on the water were already super happy.
At the door is Haiyue Square. Sooner or later, many uncles and aunts with northeast accents practice square dancing and kicking shuttlecock here. They are very life-like, and they think about their life after retirement, haha. Really, trance in Sanya City, Heilongjiang Province, haha.
I think the distance from the hotel and the convenience of life are comprehensive and cost-effective. Living with children is safer than those living in the residential area. I will consider it next time I fly over.

Although it is a bit far away from the duty-free shop, the hotel has a free shuttle bus, so there is no need to worry about how to get there. The sea view of the sea view room is also beautiful! All in all, it is very cost-effective. I would also like to thank Xiao Duan for helping with some chores!

The sea view room is facing the sea and is one of the best hotels to watch the sunset. The hotel breakfast is very good, with many varieties and great taste, worthy of praise. For the deluxe sea-view room reserved, Freya at the front desk helped me upgrade to a supreme sea-view room. She also enthusiastically helped me introduce it and presented free Starbucks. Thank you very much for her warm and thoughtful service. Worthy of being a hotel owned by Marriott, I pay attention to many details in the room. For example, the bedside table is near the bed with soft glue. Generally, the old hotels don't have USB. They added a rechargeable USB socket, which is really hard. The scheduled free shuttle bus to Cdf duty-free shop is very comfortable. The surrounding transportation and dining are very very convenient. Will definitely choose here next time I come to Sanya.

Service and attitude should learn from Haitang No. 9 Hotel. The front desk is enthusiastic and actively introduces package discounts and surrounding areas. The service is intimate and at home, and the check-in experience is great

Not to mention the old hotel facilities, some waiters are also very indifferent, especially a security guard at the gate, every time you go back to the hotel, you have to interrogate the room number.
The location of the hotel is very good, and the sea view room is worthy of the name, but the beach in this section is crowded and not very clean. Anyway, if you want to live in Sanya Bay, hotels of the same grade do not recommend this.

I am a fan of Wanhao Road, and I will continue to live in the Wanhao depar**ent in Sanya in the future. The hotel is located in Sanya Bay, only a hundred steps away from the beach. You can see the sea from the room. The scenery is beautiful like a painting. Even if you lie on the bed, you can enjoy the beauty of the sea. If you want to step on the water to pick up shells at close range, I highly recommend this Four Points by Sheraton
