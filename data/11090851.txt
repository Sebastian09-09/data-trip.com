From the front desk guy who just arrived to greet us, the aunt who served us the meal, and the manager who patiently explained to us, all of them were smiling and kind and considerate throughout the whole process.

The whole building is full of historical a**osphere, it is very photogenic, and the room is clean and tidy, all very good!!! It was my first time staying in a hotel and I felt that the price and popularity were far less than its own value! I hope friends who come to travel can come and experience it!

It is earlier than Peace Hotel and is the first foreign-related hotel in the Republic of China. The care of Yihe is reflected in the details. The repair, revitalization and maintenance of cultural relics are very professional. The professional and cultural literacy of the employees is very high, which is what I admire very much. Here I would like to praise the two managers, Ms. Wu Chenghua and Mr. Zhu Xiwu, for their high professional literacy. Their meticulous service details interpret the brand value and culture of Yihe for me.

The hotel itself has a strong sense of history, the century-old building is still timeless, the room is beautiful and clean, very photogenic, but I recommend the housekeeper service here. The housekeeper sister who received us was full of smiles and energy every day. During the stay, we would provide services beyond our expectations if we needed them.
I traveled with my parents, and because I chose to stay here, I had a very good experience. It was a rare experience of both physical and mental value for money.

msg:I think this is the best castle-style hotel in China. It is also the oldest hotel in Nanjing. The environment is better than Mahler Villa, not as noisy as Mahler Villa, suitable for business and family travel. The store is very nice, upgraded the room by two levels, and gave me a penthouse suite. I feel that I can't stand such a large environment by myself. If there are few people or traveling alone, the standard room with a big bed I booked is enough. Those who have fantasies about castle weddings around Nanjing can also consider it. The fairy tale feeling is slightly inferior to Mahler Villa, but the environment is private, that is, it is better to book a place than Mahler Villa.

msg:This time I stayed at the Yangtze Hotel and had a particularly good experience. I would like to commend an employee of your Yangtze Hotel in real name. She is Ms. Wu Chenghua, Sister Wu~

From the moment she checked in, her reception was warm and thoughtful, making people feel like spring breeze. While accompanying me to explain the Yangtze Hotel, she talked eloquently about every detail of the hotel. From her words, I could feel that she really regarded the hotel where she worked as her home, and I could see that she loved this job very much.

During the conversation, I mentioned that the soup dumplings I ate the day before didn’t taste that good and asked her if there were any delicious soup dumplings nearby. After a brief introduction to me, she said, "I happen to be passing by that soup dumpling shop tomorrow, and I'll bring you a box by the way." I said at that time, "No, no, no, I'm just asking. I'll check it out online later." look".

Unexpectedly, the next morning, she sent me a WeChat message saying that she had brought me a box and put it in the kitchen. When I came down to have breakfast, she asked the staff to heat it up for me.

I was really embarrassed and regretful, and also very moved. I ate this soup dumpling with great shame. It was delicious and made my heart very, very warm. I can feel the warm hospitality and thoughtfulness of this elder sister, so I would like to express my gratitude and praise. I can really see her enthusiasm for work and her seriousness in treating every guest. I hope Yihe’s hotels will get better and better! !

有一些情況，不算缺點，但是入住前還是要了解一下：1.酒店比較小，沒有專用的停車場，駕駛技術不過關的如果遇到當天有婚禮，車比較多，可能停都停不進來。
2.酒店有一個帶噴泉的院子，花園綠化比較小。
3.酒店樓梯比較多，客房都在2-3樓，行李多的話上樓比較辛苦
4.酒店比較大一部分是餐館，公共區域都是公用的，所以住客比較容易和食客撞在一起。不過房間隔音非常好，樓下辦婚禮，又唱又跳，房間裏完全沒有聲音，不受幹擾。

msg:3年前曾訂了這家店來南京因為疫情未成行，一直心心念念，本次在南京的最後一夜住到這，將它作為本次南京行的結束。曾經風華絕代，被譽為"口岸第一賓館”的揚子飯店，如今有點蕭條，酒店的位置在城門外靠近長江的地方，周邊過江隧道正在建設中，整個大工地，出入不太方便，從夫子廟打的到這大概30元左右。飯店裡客服很少，一路進來不知道大堂在哪裡，遇上了打掃衞生的服務員很禮貌地引入進門第一間房，就是大堂，辦理了入住，管家很熱情，免費升級了陽台房。整個飯店僅7間客房，當天衹有我和另外一個客人，感覺我是包了整幢的古堡。原以為內設應該是比較舊，盤旋而上略顯狹窄的樓梯，厚實的實木地板，低調的優雅處處顯露出昔日的風華，作為沉浸式的慢旅行，大愛！早餐中西合璧，也是很豐富，兩個人都吃不完。走時不小心忘記了東西，直接給我郵寄回家，非常感謝！如果下次有機會來南京，一定多住幾天。

整個酒店維護很好也很乾凈，外面兩個碧根果樹但是每天有人打掃，每個地方都時候拍照。
工作人員很熱情，總共7個房間，就是小而美的類型，早餐的量也很大。房間細節很到位，床也很舒服，感覺在家也沒睡這麼熟，強烈推薦！

msg:在南京的最後一天選擇了這間百年歷史的酒店，吳管家特別負責人也親切！南京頤和揚子飯店，承載了民國時期旳許多歷史故事。揚子飯店曾為中國近代簡史增添了濃墨重彩的一筆，無數歷史大事件發生在揚子飯店的某一個房間角落。宋慶齡、張學良等歷史人物曾經下榻於此（管家式服務，現共七間套房）。整體磚木混合結構，外觀是法式古堡的西洋式，牆磚卻使用了——明代舊城磚，據説取自浦口的，明代朱元璋點將台。其建築風格明顯受到文藝復興時期法國城堡式府邸建築的影響，外觀宏偉樸實，內部則豪華。一條頤和路 半部民國史，南京是一座繞不開民國情懷的城…下次去其他城市我還優先選擇楊子旗下的酒店。

        環境很安靜，衹有7間房。房間內法式百葉窗、木質地板、實木傢俱、歐式白瓷浴缸、絲麻民國風睡袍等民國風家居。還有一間迷你吧，裏面有飲料、水果和糕點。
       Check in的前台是一處展廳，牆上的歷史照片和桌上的郵票信件值得一看。3樓的小客廳聯通着外邊的走廊，下午陽光灑進來很適合拍照。
        酒店內有可以租的旗袍，樣式較多還有很精緻的刺綉工藝，建議體型較瘦的女生來的時候帶一些夾子或者自帶服裝。
        揚子飯店有兩個餐廳，一個西餐廳一箇中餐廳。中餐廳提供金陵船菜席，一桌子全是長江裏的美食。而Le Vermeil楓丹，有着南京最全的酒單。主廚是來自世界排名第四的MAURO COLAGRECO先生團隊，將傳統食材通過法式烹飪技藝，絕!
        早餐需要前一天晚上同管家預約時間，管家會提前把餐具擺好，早餐很豐盛，我們兩個人都沒吃完。
        揚子飯店為每間都配一名私人管家，24小時隨叫隨到。這裏的管家都非常負責、細心周到！印象最深的是吳管家耐心地教我印火漆郵戳，還會幫忙寄出去自己寫的明信片！很新奇的體驗，再次表達感謝！
        1k多的房價能和這些歷史名人時空交錯的住在同一空間裏，享受私人管家服務，預約制古堡早餐……性價比非常高了
