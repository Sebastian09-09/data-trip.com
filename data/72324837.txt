msg:Good location across from the metro, but hard to access from the street due to construction. Hotel service was great, they upgraded us to a bigger room and gave us free drink vouchers. However, the bar staff seemed inexperienced. We ordered an old fashioned and they realized halfway through making it that they didn't have the right ingredients to finish the drink... so they just gave me bourbon on the rocks and didn't offer to make another drink because it was "free" due to the voucher. Other than that, everything else about the hotel was top notch.

msg:We spent 10 days trip to China and Sofitel Hangzhou is one of my favorite hotels of the trip. Hardly I founded one who can speak English then I met a skinny and tall chef of the hotel who spoke English very well. He is so friendly. However, all the staff members and very friendly, attentive and welcoming too. Room is big and bed is really fitted for four of us; me, my wife and two kids. 
If we are in Hangzhou, we will choose this hotel again. 
Thanks to chef for the information about our trip to some popular places nearby.

msg:Had a family trip at Sofitel. Maybe I had too much expectation on this Sofitel hotel like other Sofitel. Maybe there was less people working during Chinese new year. Nevertheless I was kind of big disappointed in this Sofitel this time because of some negative things. the receptionist was not able to speak English well when arrived. The swimming pool was looking like nobody takes care of it. It was very dirty in the shower room. I almost feel like I did not want to take a shower there. We went out to go to Xihu. The location was not as close to Xuhui as I thought. And there was not much restaurant nearby too. 
The room was big and clean but the air conditioning was not working properly. We called reception or housekeeper to come over and check it out. They said they would check but neither did come over or fix it. Maybe we had bad luck this time. But considering the fact that Sofitel is 5 star hotel in Hangzhou city, such condition and service should not be acceptable. Hope it would improve it for ting being.

msg:Pros
- Front of hotel/lobby staff, young females and males helping with luggage etc. were very professional, prompt and provided great service - thank you!
- We liked it the first night so stayed another 
- The checkin and out was fast and efficient 
- Chuck at Carrousel restaurant provided exemplary service, he anticipated our needs, was informative, helpful and very professional
- The buffet dinner is delicious, especially the seafood and dessert
- The room is great, good attention to detail, my fav TWG tea, delicious fruit, spacious and very clean
- Good gym and pool area
- Very prompt service 

Could be better
- The bed is on the firm side, with a pillow top. Unlike Kempinski, they don’t have rooms with soft and hard beds.
- The AC is always at 24, but the bed gets hot so it was annoying waking up sweaty - perhaps a lighter filled blanket would be appropriate 
- The curtains had a gap at the top right hand corner which we couldn’t reach, so light would fill the room very early 

FYI
- 23 minutes to Westlake, close to airport, convenience stores around and malls not far
- As usual they have generous discounts on food like their buffets for in-house guests

The breakfast foods were a little undercooked and the rooms were dirty around the edges.  For a business hotel to not have a decent workstation in the room is unacceptable.  However, the staff was friendly and helpful and there are a lot of things in the hotel to like.  I did a video review of this hotel which you can watch here.  https://youtu.be/dQDDPMazmjc

msg:This hotel is exceptional! I’ve lived in China for two years now and this was hands down the best hotel I’ve stayed at. The staff were incredibly helpful and made such an effort to make me feel comfortable and at home. The warm smile on their face when they saw me was amazing and something I’ve not experienced in most hotels I’ve travelled to. 
The hotel itself has the feel and ambiance of premium quality. The decor is exceptional making it clear this is a French inspired hotel through and through, as the style and elegance is basically on another level to other hotels. I wouldn’t have expected any different from Sofitel, but this was still exceptional even by their high standards. The breakfast was exceptional, with a wide variety of selections available. The gym was fantastic and as someone into my fitness I appreciated this deeply. A first class hotel that I’d recommend to anyone traveling in Hangzhou.

msg:It was my first time staying in this hotel. The hotel was very good overall. The occupancy rate was very high during the May Day holiday, but it did not affect the order. Although the hotel is not in the city center, there is a subway line 7 nearby, which is very convenient for travel. There are also some snacks and convenience stores and coffee shops around the hotel. The only drawback is that I was not able to stay in this hotel for a few more days. The breakfast variety was also very rich, and the housekeeper's return visit was also very timely. I was very satisfied and comfortable! A welcome coupon was also given, which can be exchanged for drinks at the Lohas Bar for free. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Hangzhou!

The breakfast is rich, and the buffet in the evening is more recommended.

There were a lot of people when I checked in, but the hotel staff were very professional and orderly, and guided us to check in. Tea was also provided, and toys and candies were given to the children, and the children were very happy. The children were happy and the adults were happy.

The breakfast was also very good, but there were a lot of people, but it was understandable during the holidays. The swimming pool was also good, very large and suitable for parent-child outings. In addition to staying in the hotel, I also went to the West Lake, which was really very crowded. Overall, this stay was very good. There was a butler to take care of me throughout my stay. The service was very warm and considerate. I will stay again next time.

msg:It was close to 5 o'clock in the afternoon. The children were tired and fell asleep because it took an hour to drive. In order to let the children sleep well, I decided to stay at the Sofitel. In one sentence: If you can't eat well or sleep well, don't stay here with your children!

Service: 1. Booked a family room. After checking in, I found that it was a double bed room with a shared bed in the aisle. The two beds were far apart and I couldn't take care of the children. I was told that this is what family rooms are like in hotels, so Sofitel doesn't have families at all. The house was put together to sell the family house!
2. After I asked to change rooms, the housekeeper said that I could cancel the order for free! After staying in a hotel for so many years, this is the first time I have been asked to cancel my order! What's more, we had two children and one of them was still asleep, and it was past 5pm! 👎
3. I changed to a twin room (I have never encountered an upgrade before, but it doesn’t matter). The bed is about 80cm high. It requires sharing the bed and adding a bed surround. The person who led the room change did not know what it was. The people in the housekeeping depar**ent told me that Sofitel hotels never have bed surrounds. Then I said that the two beds should be put together. The two adults would sleep on the left and right around the child, but there was a big gap in the middle. I asked for one. Mattress, he said that I knew about this thing, but he didn’t have it😑. Sure enough, the next morning my son woke up and when he turned to the other side, he fell and hit the bedside table. Fortunately, nothing happened. If it were me If my daughter falls, then I will...!
4. It was almost 6 o'clock, and we were all tired, so we asked them to bring the toys from the family room in the previous room. After 8 o'clock, we came back from the hotel buffet and they still didn't bring them. We called and lost our temper. I asked the manager on duty what this was. A hotel with a certain grade was told that they had not applied for a star rating yet, so why did Ctrip give it a five-star rating? ? Later, people from the housekeeping depar**ent came, and I asked the young man who brought the things over if you hadn't been notified before to bring the things over? He said he had not received the notification. The toy we brought included a rocking horse that lacked important safety parts. My two-year-old daughter rocked it and fell down in front of the housekeeping staff! Let them take it away (normal service should be to send back the replacement parts, but they never come back...)
5. When checking into a hotel, because my son has allergies, I always ask for an air purifier. When I changed rooms, the air purifier was not moved. When I remembered, I was already going to bed and didn’t call to ask for it, so the children were sleeping at night. I woke up many times due to discomfort, so the staff was completely untrained and didn't know how to change rooms. We had no luggage, so we didn't know what would happen if some of our luggage was left there.
6. For the buffet at their hotel, I called the room in advance to inquire about it. I was told that it was Hainan food themed. I went thinking that children could eat it. I also asked about the price and was told that children under 6 years old are free. My son is exactly 5 years old. When we arrived at the restaurant on the 2nd floor, we all paid. I was told that it was a Japanese food theme... I was immediately offended. Japanese style has a lot of raw food, which children cannot eat. I was also told that children under 5 years old were free, although my son was not charged extra. Money, but are you sure you are working in the same hotel?
7. There are no children's tableware at the buffet! Unable to understand! Due to various unbelievable reasons, we asked for children's cutlery for breakfast the next day, and the waiter said they had it. In the end, we sent it back and forth several times, but we couldn't get a complete set. In the end, my son was asked to use a knife to eat noodles, and my daughter used a fork to drink. Yogurt, the people next to me were speechless and laughed! (My two-year-old daughter can’t really hold an adult spoon, but my son is okay.) There was a serious shortage of breakfast waiters. Several tables nearby lost their temper. The plates on our table were stacked several times from beginning to end. No one accepts it!
8. As soon as he entered the breakfast restaurant, my son saw there was only one donut, but I have two children! Are you still asking? The aunt in charge said hey, no more donuts. It was only 9:05, and there was still 1 hour and 35 minutes before the end of breakfast. A waiter heard this and said he would still serve. I didn’t understand. The foreman noticed that the donuts were almost gone. Is it long overdue? ? Around 9:40, my son wanted to eat pineapple flavored bread. I went to get it, and when I picked it up, I found that the color was wrong. It was the aunt again. I said, "Auntie, it says pineapple flavor, but the color is wrong." The aunt said, "Hey, hehe." Wrong... OK... I went to get the donuts. I said to aunt, why are the donuts different? There is no icing on them. Children don't like eating them. Auntie, hey, this is freshly baked, that's it... Sure enough, I took it back to my daughter. Not even a bite to eat…
9. We knew it as soon as it dawned in the morning. Why? Because the curtains can’t cover both sides! ! I can’t fall asleep after 6 o’clock! ! !
In this hotel, you make a request, and then they say no. They say they understand your needs, but there is nothing they can do about it. This is the first time I have heard so many words in so many years.
I guess this hotel is owned by enemies of Sofitel! ?
So if you are bringing children, be sure not to stay there. Don’t be deceived by the so-called family rooms. Those who stay in family rooms have good reviews. Your children should be independent... In short, I don’t understand this Sofitel very well!

Hygiene: The box containing the bath salts was moldy, and I found a layer of dust after using the shoehorn.

Environment: The surrounding area is basically under construction or under construction. There are many holes in the surrounding roads, so be careful when driving.

Facilities: There is no coffee machine in the Sofitel room, only instant coffee powder. Crown has a coffee machine...

msg:It was my first time to come to Hangzhou. After several comparisons online, I chose this well-reviewed Sofitel Crown Hotel. The reason for choosing it is that it opened in 21 years and is relatively new overall.
Check-in experience: It is still very good. The service attitude is very good. The concierge and guest relations staff at check-in are very friendly~
I especially like their beds and pillows, which are very soft and comfortable to sleep on. The decoration style gives people a warm feeling.
The air conditioner is very quiet when turned on, the temperature is gentle, and the bed is comfortable, so I slept very well.

He always answers all questions and responds in a very timely manner. The environment of the hotel is very good, it is very close to large supermarkets, and it is very convenient to have a subway station next to it. It only takes 20 minutes by taxi to West Lake.

Moreover, the breakfast on the second floor of the hotel is also very delicious. I highly recommend everyone to stay in this hotel.

When you check in, the service at the front desk is fast and convenient. At the same time, you must praise the butler's thoughtful greetings. The one-to-one attentive butler service is really worthy of praise! All in all, during the Chinese New Year, this was really my most satisfying stay since I stayed in so many hotels. I don’t usually like reviews, but Sofitel Hangzhou Yingguan is really worth it! If I have the chance to come to Hangzhou next time, this will be the first hotel I choose! The hotel has a total of 35 floors, and the transportation here is very convenient. Parking is free. The hotel is very close to the subway station. It is next to a pub and McDonald's. I think it has a great location. For me, this is one of the best hotels in Hangzhou! This stay left me with very beautiful memories, and I couldn’t do without the butler’s attentive and meticulous service with a smile, thoughtful greetings and efficient service! This is a very satisfying stay. I look forward to returning to Sofitel Hangzhou Yingguan next time!

msg:The check-in experience was very bad!!!
1.2.11 The first night of check-in, the next door room 1810 was arranged as a wedding room, and I was woken up at 6 o'clock the next day
2. The baby bed could not be added after 2 days of communication. Finally, it was added with the help of Ctrip. After adding it, Manager Zhang, who claimed to be the front office manager, insisted that the hotel did not have extra baby beds to provide me. Ctrip could add it, but your front office manager could not add a baby bed. It was a slap in the face
3. The room phone was called at 22:55 in the evening, asking me to cancel the Ctrip order and give me a lower price than Ctrip. If you are crazy, you harass guests to cancel the order in the middle of the night
4. The room temperature is 27 degrees. The hotel explained that the outdoor temperature is low and there is no air conditioning. You are right to have no air conditioning
5. Breakfast queue, obviously there is no reception capacity to receive so many guests, the food is not replenished in time, the waiter does not collect the food, and it takes more than an hour to eat breakfast and queue
Summary: The hotel's reception capacity needs to be improved. It does not solve problems when encountering them, and prevaricates with various reasons. The attitude is poor, and finally small problems evolve into big problems

Business is super good, in stark contrast to last year.
When the guest relations depar**ent called to confirm the check-in time the day before check-in, they mentioned that the room was basically full.
When we arrived at the front desk, we also mentioned this and gave them coffee coupons and some small gifts for the lobby bar. Obviously, it was a long wait 😂
I made a quick decision and sent my luggage to go out for fun.
When I came back, the room was ready and there were welcome fruits.
However, because of the large number of people, the breakfast experience this year was not as good as last year. The arrangement of this table is indeed substandard. Fortunately, it was much better the next day.

Swimming pool: overall clean, constant temperature and comfortable, few people
Service: The luggage was sent upstairs, politely, and I saw children giving clay figurines.
Highlights: It is recommended to stay here for leisure vacations and non-scenic tourist attractions. The same price is two levels higher than that of urban hotels. To give people a high-end feeling, it would be better to have a children's paradise. Will stay again if there is an event

The Kohler washlet seems to be more advanced than my old-fashioned Toto one. It automatically opens the toilet seat when someone approaches, and the facilities are quite advanced.
Toiletries: This is really good. I use Lanvin brand shampoo and shower gel, etc., which is really rare in the current cost-down background!
Room: The layout is reasonable, the semi-open cloakroom is well designed, there is space for suitcases, and the wardrobe is opposite.
Breakfast: The breakfast that I may need to complain about during this stay is that there are too many people when the rooms are full during the Spring Festival. The variety of breakfast is not bad, but there are just too many people.
Parking lot: B1B2 are both parking lots, with both three-dimensional garages and ordinary parking spaces. Parking is very convenient.
Swimming pool and other fitness facilities: The heated swimming pool is quite good, and the hotel is fully air-conditioned. Staying in winter will not affect the swimming experience. The gym has its own exercise room and spinning room, where you can watch others swimming and cycling at the same time.
Generally speaking, this luxury hotel at this price is very cost-effective and is recommended to stay.

msg:I chose to spend the three-day holiday at the Sofitel Hangzhou at the end of the year. It was very pleasant to visit Xiang Lake and West Lake. When I checked in, I met Xiao Han from the guest relations depar**ent who called me the day before and showed us to the room. What a pleasant surprise! The newly opened hotel is comfortable to stay in. The rooms are large, the layout is trendy, and the facilities are complete. It has all the elements that a five-star hotel should have.
      The breakfast restaurant is on the second floor. Due to events and consecutive holidays, there are a lot of people diners and it is a bit noisy, but the order, dishes and service can keep up. The happy hour in the executive lounge was also crowded. It was a big regret that the hot dishes were not replenished in time for two consecutive days. Fortunately, Ms. Wu Yuehan gave us sincere and attentive service for two days, which made us feel warm. I would like to express my special thanks to her. The coffee in the executive lounge is much better than the coffee in the restaurant on the second floor. I was very happy to be able to delay check-out until 16:00 on the third day. I wanted to have a cup of coffee in the executive lounge and was told that the lounge service had been used the day before. However, it was no longer available for use on that day (this was the first time I encountered the executive lounge of so many hotels). Later, although I had a hard time drinking a cup of coffee as I wished, my interest was greatly reduced, leaving a period of time for this supposedly perfect journey. Bad memories.
      Of course, in terms of cost performance, when traveling to Hangzhou, staying at the Sofitel Hangzhou Yingguan Hotel is still the first choice.

msg:Worst star hotel experience in a long time
It started before we even entered the hotel. When the car stopped, the doorman stopped and didn't realize to open the door. After I packed my things and opened the door, I came over and pretended to open the door.
The breakfast was a complete disaster. Although the taste was acceptable, the other services were a mess. No one came to sit down at a table with a pile of finished plates that had not been collected. And just after 9 o'clock, there was nothing left in the entire buffet. The bread and fruit areas were empty and you could only look at them. I saw a few slices of watermelon and a pear that had been picked over by others. After eating, I looked at them deliberately at about 9:40, but no one replenished any food.
The software and hardware in the room are terrible. You can see the dust clearly in the picture. Although the toilet has a smart toilet that has good reviews, the drainage is a mess and there is always a smell.
The sleeping experience is also very, very unsatisfactory. The sound insulation is very poor. The sound of people passing by and talking in the corridor at night is very obvious, even as if it is in the ears. The construction site outside is very noisy during the day, and it wakes people up at 9 o'clock in the morning on Saturdays.
Overall, it is very, very, very not recommended😡😡😡

Location: Although it is located in Xiaoshan District, it only takes 20 minutes to drive to West Lake. There are various snack stalls downstairs. It is good to go downstairs for some late-night barbecue or something in the evening.

Facilities: I won’t comment if I didn’t use the gym or swimming pool. I won’t go into details about everything that should be included in a new hotel room.

Service: From check-in to check-out, GRO director Xuanxuan and front desk staff pay great attention to the check-in experience, and respond very quickly to requests in the room. I bought some fruits and asked the all-day restaurant for help because I didn’t have a knife. The staff was very enthusiastic. After cutting them, they even helped put them on a plate. Thank you very much🌝
I didn’t leave any photos. I will choose this hotel when I come to Hangzhou in the future. There is no parking fee, but the parking lot is indeed a bit convoluted. It’s hard to find it every time I drive out.

msg:My wife had a great stay. I chose this Sofitel for a business trip in Hangzhou. The service exceeded my expectations. The decoration of the hotel is French, and the lobby is spacious and bright. As soon as I entered the door, the staff were very energetic. The whole check-in process was very fast and The lady at the front desk always had a smile on her face. When I checked in, the housekeeper followed me and took me to the room to introduce me to the hotel's facilities. I was very satisfied with the free parking and the 24-hour gym, which provided me with a lot of convenience. Finally, I would like to thank my butler again for his warm and thoughtful service, which is really good!

msg:Dear bosses, when you come to Hangzhou for a business trip, you should choose Sofitel Hangzhou Yingguan Hotel. I didn’t plan to review it at first, and I don’t usually like to comment. But this time I stayed at Sofitel Hangzhou Yingguan Hotel. I was really surprised. I have stayed in so many hotels so far. Marriott InterContinental Hotel, I have never enjoyed such good service. I received a call from the hotel before check-in. I didn’t answer it because it was inconvenient. I thought it was to confirm the order but I was busy and forgot about it. I didn’t expect that it was a guest who called when I checked in. The lady I contacted personally picked me up, checked me in, and sent me back to my room. Along the way, she introduced me to the hotel's facilities and business locations, as well as the routes to nearby subway stations. The most important thing is that on the first day after I checked in, the lady I had a relationship with as a guest mentioned that she wouldn't go anywhere because I suddenly caught a cold. The next day, she took the initiative to give me the medicine and hot water I bought without thinking about it. I didn't bother others and went to get it myself. The service was really good. Moreover, the young lady seemed to have a cold herself. She also washed the fruit I bought for me. I gave her a bag and she gave it to me. Mine was a fruit plate that was washed and arranged. I really have to praise the guest relations lady who served me during this stay. I am very, very grateful! The room was not tight and they arranged a fruit plate and welcome card for me, and also prepared a birthday cake and greeting cards for me in advance. I am really happy. This service is so good, how can I not be favored by everyone! The floor of the room is quite high. You can see the gate of Hangzhou and there are many buildings nearby. When I came to Xiaoshan before, it was still flat. The hotel is quite new. The bedding is very comfortable and I have a good rest. The room is a bit stuffy when I open the window. It's ok if it's ventilated. There are also bath products and the fragrance in the lobby smells good. It's quite comfortable to stay here. It's worthy of being a Sofitel. The whole hotel has a romantic style. There's already a Chris**as tree in the lobby and it's quite early. , I wanted to extend my stay for one more night, but there were no double rooms available and they were fully booked. It seems I have to leave the regret until next time to make up for it!

She also said that she could find a warm baby somewhere. She gave it to me and asked me to go to the lobby to find her. I also had friends who had to leave the store early temporarily. When it came to refunds and refunds, Yiyi helped us solve it in time. She was very professional and considerate. Thank you very much for her concern and help. I was very touched. !

I met a very nice lady, which improved the living experience of the hotel. The public area is not too luxurious, but the room is relatively comfortable overall. Surprisingly, the child thinks this new Chinese style is quite good, and his house can be decorated in this style in the future. Can't stand him.
The young lady gave us a drink card. There were coffee, wine and juice to choose from. It was very pleasant to have a drink after swimming. The breakfast is very nice, and the Sofitel is the best among hotels of this type. Recommend~

msg:I didn’t come during my first stay, but this is my second time I placed an order to check in. I felt quite grand as soon as I entered the hotel lobby. There are also some sign-in desks for teams in the lobby. The breakfast in the restaurant on the second floor is very good, especially the grilled croissant. It's delicious and crispy. The spiral staircase down from the second floor is very well designed, suitable for taking photos and checking in. It also fits well with the carousel restaurant. The entire hotel is a combination of French and Hangzhou. The guest room corridors are also designed with Hangzhou in mind, including willow trees and poetry. , I forgot to take pictures, and the butler from the guest relations depar**ent of the hotel has been providing exclusive service to me during my stay. It is very considerate. I will come back next time when I have the opportunity. I give you a thumbs up.

Service: The service is nothing to say, the hotel butler, the front desk are all great, and the service in the executive lounge is very good.
Dining: The happy hour in the lounge is very, very good. When there are many people for breakfast, because it is an executive room, there is also a good location. The toppings of the breakfast noodles are average, and the shredded radish pancakes are delicious.
The hotel has changed my previous impression of Accor, it is warm and thoughtful, and it is better than previous Accor hotels. Room service calls are answered in seconds.
There are a few small problems, but it does not affect the hotel is the top of Hangzhou.
The first point is that the flushing water of the toilet will automatically flush out and flush to the legs. After calling and responding, it will be repaired, but in fact it has not been repaired.
The second point is that the frosted glass control key in the room is broken.
The third point is that the room was cleaned the next day and some things were not added.
The fourth point is that the swimming pool is outsourced, and the swimming pool toilets are very smelly. There is no assembled water in the swimming pool. The children didn't bring a change of clothes and thought about going back to the room wrapped in a towel, thinking about registering the room number. But the swimming pool reception is not allowed, and the guests must be sent down, which is a bit unreasonable. The explanation is that there is no way to outsource it.

The subway station entrance can lead directly to the West Lake, which is really convenient. There are 2 floors of underground parking in total, and there are charging piles on the first floor, which is very convenient and full of convenience. The room arranged by Yuna was very satisfactory, and the service was really attentive and considerate, which made my trip a lot more enjoyable. If I have the chance, I will stay at Sofitel Hangzhou Yingguan again~ See Miss Yuna again~

msg:I was upgraded to a room. The price-performance ratio of the room is very good. The decoration style is nice and the bedding is also very good. Generally speaking, there is nothing wrong with the hotel. It is a five-star configuration. The problem lies in personnel management. Originally, there was something wrong with the price and it could be ignored, but I still made suggestions in the hope that the hotel could improve. The staff is cooperative and up to date, making this a hotel that will definitely bring repeat customers.

1️⃣I bought two 2-night packages. The concierge told me that it was a 4-night stay. However, after 2 nights, the room card expired. I returned to the room very tired carrying heavy things and had to make another trip to check in.
2️⃣The staff took the elevator together and said hello quietly when they came in (it is recommended to either not say hello at all or say hello like a hello). After eating, they kept burping next to them. Once they said hello, they followed through. After leaving the elevator, they still looked after themselves. If you go out first, other hotels will give way.
3️⃣Parking and registration. After registration, I hope I can figure out how many nights I will stay. Please register effectively after registering once. I ran for two more days and was really speechless. The first three days were fine. On the last day, when I checked out and left the machine, the card suddenly got stuck and we had to pay. , it was raining that day, and the exit was a one-way street and no U-turns were allowed, so my girlfriend ran to the lobby to register again in the rain.
4️⃣The air conditioner needs to be turned on by closing the window button. The system linkage was not informed in advance. I was sorry for the trouble and the maintenance staff came to see it. He was very patient. The overall speech training was in place and polite. I felt that there was no need to bother people. I just got one. Tips are the best

msg:At first, I booked the wrong hotel date and blamed the hotel for being so slow in ordering orders. As a result, the guy at the front desk was super nice and highly qualified. He always helped me check information and confirm my order with a smile. I was really embarrassed. Special thanks to Xiao Zou from the hotel. Hahahahahaha with Xiao Deng is really great! Very kind! Very considerate! I will stay in this hotel next time I come to Hangzhou! I think the hardware facilities are really comparable to many hotels. The rooms are very big. My friend said that she has stayed in so many hotels and only your toothbrush is the best! The most important thing is that the hotel service staff are really good 😬

The environment here is beautiful, the location is good, the transportation is convenient, the rooms are comfortable and hygienic, and Yuna in guest relations is very enthusiastic.

The breakfast at Sofitel Hangzhou Yingguan Hotel is rich, the overall facilities are very user-friendly, the high-speed Internet signal is good, and the scenery outside the window is beautiful. What I like most is the floor-to-ceiling windows, which are very open. The design of the room is also very unique. Good value for money, I will stay here again next time. After I checked in, Yuna from guest relations was very concerned about the details of my stay and made me feel very warm.
The hotel room is very spacious, and the TV in the hotel is also a high-definition LCD TV. I highly recommend this place! !

Because the whole experience of staying at the hotel was very nice, I want to give it a sincere review! In addition to the five-star hotel itself, the following points contribute to my praise:
1. Help me upgrade to an executive room
2. After checking in, the beautiful little girl at the front desk helped me drag my suitcase to the room and gave me many warm tips.
3. After returning to the room after a meeting in the afternoon, the cookies provided in the room were delicious.
4. Ask for suggestions after checking out and give me a cup of coffee
5. From the front desk to the door until getting on the bus
I have stayed in many five-star hotels. The hardware design of this Sofitel is also very good and very new. The key point is that I have to sleep without sound or light. They did a good job. They also pay so much attention to service and user experience. I give it a thumbs up ❤️!

The scent of aromatherapy, accompanied by light music and warm lighting, is bright, comfortable and relaxing, and the room is full of light, which makes patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder ecstatic.
The most commendable thing is that Yuna from guest relations has been connecting with me since the first booking, carefully asking me about the room arrangement and personal preferences.

This time we came to Hangzhou to celebrate our birthday. Zana specially sent us cakes and greeting cards, helped us upgrade to a suite, and paid close attention to our stay experience throughout the whole process, and responded to our requests.
The French decoration style of the entire hotel is very youthful. The white marble decoration of the entire hotel not only demonstrates the taste of the hotel, but also shows the ultimate hygiene without blind spots. The hotel's breakfast is also very diverse, and the public facilities are complete and high-end. The price is moderate, making it more attractive to discerning hotel guests than hotels of the same class. I will definitely stay at Sofitel Sofitel again when I come to Hangzhou in the future! Thanks again Zana for the arrangement

But the Sofitel Hangzhou Yingguan Hotel I stayed in this time left a deep impression on me, and the service exceeded expectations. In particular, Ms. Zana, the hotel's guest relations, called the day before check-in to inquire about the relevant needs and met them one by one. She truly cared for the guests rather than some mechanical services that stayed on the surface. It can be seen that the hotel managers are here. It is also very hard work. The hygiene level of the entire hotel, including the guest rooms, is also quite high. The overall style of the hotel also continues the refined and elegant style of a French luxury hotel, and the check-in experience is also very comfortable. Ms. Zana also kept asking about relevant needs and giving help throughout the stay, which made me really feel like a home away from home, and I would like to express my deep gratitude!

As soon as I entered the hotel lobby, I was immediately struck by its ambience. The entire lobby is spacious and bright, with luxurious and exquisite decoration. Gorgeous chandeliers, elegant furniture and green plants everywhere give people a sense of tranquility and comfort. The hotel staff were polite and enthusiastic, welcoming us with a smile. Among them, Xiao Chen's service attitude left a deep impression on me.

I explained my reservation to Xiao Chen and she checked in very quickly and accurately. During this process, Xiao Chen always maintained patience and smile, and gave me a lot of help. She answered my questions in fluent English and recommended tourist attractions and food around the hotel to me. Xiao Chen provided us with thoughtful service, which made me feel the professionalism and meticulous care of the hotel staff.

In addition to his excellent service attitude, Xiao Chen also gave us a surprise. She proactively mentioned that afternoon tea was included in our reservation. This unexpected good news made me very happy. The quality and taste of the afternoon tea at the hotel was also outstanding. The exquisite pastries and fragrant tea made me a full meal. This extra courtesy not only enhanced our stay experience, but also made us feel the hotel's generosity and care.

What was even more surprising was that Xiao Chen told us that the hotel upgraded our room type for free from a common room to a superior floor. This promotion made me feel that I was noticed and treated with dignity. I opened the door and saw a spectacular panoramic view of the city. The higher floors not only gave me beautiful views, but also kept me away from the hustle and bustle of the city. In this ideal environment, I completely relaxed and felt unprecedented comfort and tranquility.

Overall, staying at Sofitel Hangzhou Yingguan was an absolutely perfect experience. Whether it was the luxurious decoration, warm and thoughtful staff service, or the unexpected afternoon tea and free room upgrade, they all left a deep impression on me. I was impressed by the excellent service and supreme trea**ent at this hotel and have no hesitation in giving them my highest praise. I believe that whether you are on a business trip or vacation, choosing Sofitel Hangzhou Yingguan will definitely make your experience more comfortable and satisfying.

She would also considerately help me arrange the room and welcome fruit in advance to solve all my problems. The recommended Zhenxiang card is also really fragrant and very favorable hahahaha

msg:I came here for the Hangzhou Tennis Masters. The room is quite new, but the location is too bad. It is surrounded by the urban-rural fringe area, and there is nothing there. The design of the hotel is also very strange. It is at a crossroads but the main entrance is blocked by a green belt (I don't know if it is due to Feng Shui). You can only turn right or left in a big circle to enter the door.
The TV in the room couldn’t be turned on. It still didn’t work to ask the waiter for help. It took 10 minutes for the engineer in the engineering depar**ent to rummage through boxes and cabinets before passing the exam. I was speechless.
The lobby bar gets off work at 21:00 in the evening, and does not go to work until after 10:00 in the morning. There is no chance to use the drink coupons provided 😂
Also the breakfast is good~

Since it was during the Dragon Boat Festival, there were a lot of people, and Xiao Jiang immediately tried to solve the problem after reporting it. The breakfast was also rich and high-quality.

The price of more than 900 RMB was comparable to a business hotel priced around 500 RMB in terms of environment and service. Check-in When I arrived, the front desk asked me to go to the counter next door. When I went there, they asked me to wait. There were no other customers at the front desk? There was a takeaway smell in the elevator, but the welcome fruit was almost as simple as what I had prepared in a hotel with a price of more than 400 yuan. There were hairs on the bathroom floor mat, and I don't know if the slippers were of this quality or reused. It's pilling. I've been told how good it is online, but it seems to have been painted on. I highly recommend it.

msg:When checking in, one girl was too arrogant. The room card made it impossible for me to have a room with a guest on the floor. I have never experienced it in my hotel experience. I swiped into other people's rooms, but I couldn't get in. Suddenly, a person came out, which was super embarrassing😳.
It was 29 degrees in the room, and there is no air conditioning in a five-star hotel.
The pile driving on the opposite construction site was very loud, which made me leave the store.
This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in

msg:This year is quite special. Our small family chose to travel by car to celebrate the New Year. The family of four drove nearly 400 kilometers that day and arrived at the Sofitel Hangzhou Yingguan Hotel at 9 o'clock in the evening. The two staff at the front desk were very heartwarming. They heard the little girl Muttering about my birthday on 1/23, I proposed to give a birthday cake 🍰 as a gift 🎁. In fact, Lutu wanted to buy a small cake to sweeten the child, but it was not possible because the store was out of stock. Here, I would like to thank the hotel for the surprise, thank you!
        When we checked in, we arranged parent-child room No. 23 on 28F. We prepared a fruit platter for welcome. It was warm, comfortable and cute, and the children liked it. Here I need to mention some problems with the water temperature last night... Although it was a bit late, she also offered to change the suite for us. The young lady led me to find a room to test the water temperature, and the maintenance master quickly solved the problem. Since the two children have already used the room, we were also worried about the waste caused by changing the room, and finally chose the original parent-child room. All the staff are actively helping to solve the problem, we would also like to say thank you!
       Tolerance means understanding and respect. Finally, I would like to thank Manager Zhu at the front desk for his calm response to the problem. I am grateful for everything! ❤️If you have the opportunity to come, you will definitely choose Sofitel again! ㊗️ It's getting better and better!

msg:I really tied the Q... I thought it was an upgraded room type, but it turned out to be an indescribable room. Don't tell me that it was upgraded to a king bed room. This room doesn't even have what a king bed room should have! If I don’t have a room, I can check in later. If I find out that it’s a side room, forget it. The room doesn’t even have a [sofa]. ? Although [sofa] is generally not used by me, but if I don't have it, I really feel that something is missing. A large pillar in the room blocking the line of sight is not a big problem, and the bug was not found one night - I slept until the next morning and was woken up by the light! The room cannot be completely dark, because there is no curtain on the side of the glass to cover it! Behind this glass is the washroom, I thought it was because the curtain was not closed in the washroom, but... the curtain is transparent! No shading effect at all. In order to sleep more... I can only cover it up. In order to let everyone not step on the thunder, I tell everyone that this is Room 03 of a certain high-level building. If you have requirements for light, you must pay attention! Objectively speaking, the location of the hotel is not bad. There are a lot of food downstairs, and there are several convenience stores, which should be open 24 hours. The service is also OK.

The newly opened hotel is very beautiful, and the room design is also good, but the water is already leaking at the foot of the washbasin at night, and the shower water is relatively small. There are quite a lot of varieties for breakfast in the morning, but some guests come to eat in bathrobes. As an international chain five-star hotel, guests pay the price of a five-star hotel. I feel that there are still many areas that need to be improved. Generally speaking, the newly opened hotel is still in the process of improvement. The current experience of staying is not satisfactory, and I hope to continue to improve.

The decoration of the room is pertinent, and the wooden floor in front of the bathroom of the room where I stayed last night was soaked. The room service and front office service are well-behaved, but I personally suggest that the restaurant really needs to be improved: 1) It is the peak summer season recently, and there are already a lot of people eating breakfast. The registration staff at the door should play the role of registration & drainage. Let the guests go in and find their own seats, which is chaotic and disorderly and hinders the original work; 2) During the busy time of breakfast, I saw that there are more kitchen staff than the restaurant waiters. In fact, it is not that there are no empty seats, but the closing action is too slow; 3 ) It was the first time I saw an international five-star restaurant that it was so untimely to refill dishes, cups, and cutlery. From the time I went to dinner to the time I left, the juice cups were not replenished, so I could only go to get a coffee cup to fill the juice. , this service should not appear; 4) I had three meals in the restaurant in total, two for breakfast and one for dinner, and the basic situation was the same for three days. This experience is a big discount for the hotel's impression.

msg:First of all the bathtub has body hair! ! ! But that's not the point!
The point is that the manager on duty is very talented in languages! Blame the customer for interrupting him! ! ! The point is that as a manager, you can’t speak clearly and find various excuses to talk nonsense!
The front desk of the hotel is the front desk, and the lobby bar is the lobby bar. It doesn't feel like a hotel at all! The check-in package includes afternoon tea. The front desk did not indicate the specific time for afternoon tea. We also indicated the time we needed to use it and followed the instructions to reserve afternoon tea for the next day in advance. But the weird thing is that the front desk did not inform the lobby! In order to avoid missing the reservation at noon that day, we called the front desk in advance to confirm and transferred to the lobby! And when we went downstairs at the agreed time, we got the wrong afternoon tea set, which was not our reservation order! The lobby told us that the set meal we ordered needs to be reserved in advance, and we have to wait half an hour for it to be made fresh! As a result, we had to wait for more than an hour for the afternoon tea that was originally served at 14:30 at 16:00! I called to complain about communication difficulties throughout the process, accusing us of interrupting the manager on duty at your hotel, telling us that he didn't interrupt me when I was speaking, and saying that I kept interrupting your manager! Instantly we feel as if we are the ones being complained about! ! ! This experience was amazing!

The room is very big, it's a little scary to live alone, the bathroom is very big, and the marble floor has a few traces of red, yellow and yellow, which makes it a little scary. It should be a lot more comfortable for two people, and the washing and care are all lanvin, which is still very good~
The breakfast is very rich ~ everything is available ~ the service is ok, the location is very good, it takes half an hour to go anywhere in the city, except for Xixi. Also close to the airport, it is worth staying!

msg:Very good hotel. It is convenient for business trips and flights. It is also very convenient for food and takeaway nearby. The service attitude of the front desk staff is good. Instead of questioning the guests, I also politely informed us that we can actually change rooms at the moment. The buffet in the evening is quite good at this price. The only drawback is that the breakfast dishes are not prepared in time. The cooked food is not ready yet. For those who travel for business or take a morning flight, it is not too early to eat at 7:00. This should not be a mistake made by a five-star hotel.

msg:Worst 5 star hotel ever
- Stayed at night on 7.29, there is no doorman at the door, there is a security guard who yells loudly.
-The suite that I booked includes welcome fruit, but after checking in, I found that there is no fruit in the room. After I called the service desk, it took an hour for someone to deliver it. The service desk also questioned me, arguing that it was released before check-in. Management is very confusing.
-Breakfast is on the second floor, there are many varieties, but the chef who made the egg rolls left work early at 10:20. But the waiters at F&B are quite enthusiastic.
- The happy hour of the executive lounge is only 5.30-7.30, which is much shorter than other hotels, but the front desk did not inform it.
- Back to the hotel on the night of the 30th and found that the room was only half cleaned, this is the first time I have encountered such a low-level mistake in a five-star hotel. The bottom pad has not been changed, the paper has not been put away, and there is still garbage on the ground.
- On the night of the 30th, I asked someone to deliver the pillow. At 7:00, I called someone to deliver it, but it was not delivered. I called again at 10:00, but it still didn't deliver.
-On the evening of the 30th, I saw a girl in a bathrobe in the lobby saying that a man broke into her room while she was sleeping or taking a shower. The front desk gave the wrong room card to someone else.
All in all, it was a chaotic and speechless stay experience.

msg:Overall, I am not very satisfied. I brought my family to play during the Spring Festival holiday. Ctrip wrote about upgrading the room type, but there was no communication when I checked in. The family forgot to bring their ID cards and had to check in with an electronic ID card. The attitude of the front desk staff was not very good Okay, I just kept saying that there are photos, but do you have any photos? What we need to know is how to obtain it. As a star hotel, it is not very comfortable, and it did not take the initiative to inform the problem of parking and entering the license plate. Let’s talk about the room. I can see that the occupancy rate of the hotel is not high, and the room allocated is Construction site view room, and there is no non-slip mat in the bathroom. The elders slipped and fell out of the shower. It’s not a big problem, but the experience is not good. The children are going to swim. The fitness center is open until 23:00. We want to go to the fitness center at ten o’clock There is not even a receptionist, and the call to the service center is always busy. Later, I went to the front desk and asked the front desk and said that it was open until 22:00, and it also opened at 10:00 in the morning. When I waited until the next day, I was told that it would not open until 11:00. Is it the service that Sofitel should have? ? ? By the way, I ordered takeaway, and the takeaway counter also needs to go around a corner, and I can't find it without asking. . .
Of course, there are also good ones. The hotel security guy I met was pretty good, and he was quite service-minded.

To sum up, the interior decoration style of the hotel is pretty good, but as a hotel of this level, I think the service is too slow to keep up. It should not only be caused by the shortage of staff during the Spring Festival, but our family is not very satisfied with the overall service. Not very recommended to stay, the price is very low

I used to live in Sofitel in Xi'an. The legend has left me with super invincible memories. After this time, I should be more cautious about this brand

Room service needs to be greatly improved, mainly in the following points: 1. The welcome fruit displayed when booking is not provided. 2. The sofa in the guest room was stained and very dirty. The staff came and said that it was a trace of stain removal, and it was cleaned again but it was not cleaned (the guests cleaned it themselves later), and there was a lot of dust on the countertops in various corners. 3. In the evening, the child injured his finger and needed a band-aid and a quilt. He agreed but never brought it. A bit late to call, but should give feedback if not available. 4. There is water under the steps at the exit of the swimming pool, which causes it to slip. Safety measures need to be improved. It is recommended to add a cushion or the like.

On the same morning, the security guard was arrogant and scolded the guest to move the car away (the key is that it just stopped for two minutes, waiting for someone to get the parking card). At night, the security guard asked the guests to display the health code in the same tone as a prisoner without seeing it! The customer couldn't bear to go to the front desk to ask the manager to respond to the situation. A person who claimed to be the biggest leader came out and apologized, but just asked the customer how to solve it. No sincerity! The middle security guard came to quarrel with the customer again. The manager turned a blind eye and let the security guard quarrel with the customer! Really eye-opening! There is still such a five-star hotel! Not even the least respect for customers! The service staff didn't even say hello! All the opening lines start with "how are you", no service at all! The cleaning of the room is even more perfunctory, the cotton swabs used for five days and the mineral water that has been drunk are still in place. I really don't know how to get good reviews!

It was not until I called their lobby manager and complained through Ctrip that I took out a packed room and was able to check in smoothly. Call the front desk at 10 pm and ask for a dental kit. At 10:30, I called again, and the toothpaste was delivered quickly. But the front desk said that the room service was a little busy today, until 11:30, knock on the door and wake me up who just slept! ...
Is this what a five-star hotel does?

msg:I have always loved the hotels owned by AccorHotels in France. I stayed at Sofitel Hangzhou Xiaoshan for two nights during my first Chris**as. Got two free afternoon tea coupons. I got a souvenir after checking out.
The hotel is very new and has a wide view on the 29th floor. Due to the epidemic, breakfast will be a set meal on December 24th and will be self-service on the 25th. The room is very large and separated from wet and dry areas.
Disadvantages: 1) Unfortunately, the air conditioner in the room cannot be adjusted and it makes a whistling sound when the transom door is opened. As an architect, I know this is a shortcoming of high-rise building design. Provide fresh air in the corridor or provide blocking measures above the transom windows;
2) The two wash basins in the washbasin are unreasonable, and the dressing table for women is too small;
3) There is no clock in the room and I don’t know how to tell the time.
Overall, I give it five points Merci. Thank you.

The hotel is very new and big, the rooms are well decorated and well-designed, and the details are handled very well. The toilet is a separate room or a smart toilet. The bathroom is TOTO. I also like the small cloakroom very much. Lavin for spare parts. I really like the room.
Some tips: The front desk was indifferent during the entire check-in process. The concierge had no sense of service. When the car came, he looked up. There was a little episode about hygiene during the stay. Steven Zhu ran up and down very nicely to help us solve the problem, like it. There is no service in the breakfast western restaurant. There is nothing to eat after 9 o'clock. The dishes that the guests ate on the seat did not have time to clean up. It took a long time to sit down.

msg:On National Day, I don't want to go to a crowded scenic spot, so my friend recommended to come here, saying that the room is great and the service is super cost-effective. So I booked two rooms and set off immediately. There are also special offers for newly registered members of the hotel, including breakfast, which is great! There are a lot of luggage with the baby, which is actually quite troublesome. First of all, the hotel gave me a good impression, the hardware is great, it is very clean, it is very popular, there are so many children, and the little girls are beautiful and happy. Photograph. I also saw the team guests who came here to play, maybe they are close to the scenic spot, but they are not the hustle and bustle of the relationship. From the guidance of the parking lot to the patience of the bellboy brother, we left a good impression. There are a lot of seats in the rest area, which is really considerate and there is enough space for guests to take a rest. Since the checkin team has a lot of guests and the service counter is full, a caring and beautiful lady took us to the executive floor to check in. The whole service was very nice, and she carefully arranged for us on the same floor and treated the elderly and children very well. Gentle, after inquiring, I found out that she is Monica whom the guests have always praised, so happy! In the past few days, from the opening hours of the restaurant, the swimming pool, the specialties, the points of attention, and even just remembering to order birthday cakes for friends, Monica has helped us a lot, especially for our first stay. The guests have a very reassuring sense of warmth. There is also the little brother Jackson, the front desk manager. Every time I see guests or children, he always greets very kindly. We need help temporarily, so we can solve it quickly. There is also hardware, the restaurant is large, and the service Very good, although it hasn't been long since the new opening, but in the face of the large passenger flow of breakfast during holidays, every manager and service staff are very patient and meticulous, very busy but not messy, it is not easy. The swimming pool facilities are very good. I thought that the water temperature inside would be relatively low, but it was unexpectedly warm. The changing room was set up very well, and the water temperature was above 28 degrees. It was very comfortable. The children played very high. There were 2 full-time safety guards. Intermittent pool patrols are safe. It can be seen that the hotel is attentive. I will choose here when I come to play ☺️

msg:The 5-star rating is due to the request of the account manager, and she will be under pressure if she scores less than 5 stars. First of all, thank the hotel for the upgraded room type. (The complimentary fruit plate and breakfast were not used.) Compared with the stay at the end of August, this time is another unusual experience. It is only for reference of guests who will check in in the future. The truthful comments are as follows: 1. In front of the hotel, a blue mask is on the ground. The concierge foreman picked it up in time. In the code scanning area in front of the door, when I showed the health code, I found that the welcome guest was not wearing a mask. I asked: You don’t wear masks in public places. What do you think about looking at the health codes of guests so close? 2. Back to the hotel in the evening, call the front desk to ask if there is a memory pillow available, and tell if there are other pillows, but they haven't been delivered in the past 9 minutes. Let me choose another pillow, but after a while, the phone told me that there was no more. I asked if it is possible to let the guest room communicate directly on the room phone. I asked the same thing 4 times, and I replied that you chose 3 kinds of pillows. I just went to work and did not understand the situation... I would like to ask, what is the training content of the hotel front desk? Don’t you answer guest questions? I have a recording, I have no bad attitude, let alone yelling. (When repeating the second time, the waiter surnamed Zhu was forced to use the phone to record.) Until 23:05, Manager Zhu at the front desk of the hotel called. He had a good attitude. He wanted to send pillows. I said that I don’t need it. I need to rest. It's midnight, and I haven't seen the pillow yet. What time is it when the pillow arrives? Starting from 22:36 at night, pillows are not available as a basic hotel accommodation. If you want to rate a 5-star hotel, you must also consider whether it matches the 5-star hotel. 3. The elevator went downstairs. When the elevator reached the 13th floor, the elevator opened. A staff member entered the elevator. I asked: Do you think it is appropriate to be in the elevator confined space with the guests without wearing a mask? She replied that the mask was broken. Alas...4, take a cup of water above the kettle in the room, the shape of the cabinet door is dusty, and the dust will fall off when the cabinet door is closed. 5. The bathroom glass partitions the floor, and there is particularly short stubble. I disinfected it again before using it. 6. The wooden sliding door of the bathroom needs to be paid attention to. Some hands are scratched, and it is easy to be injured when you use force. 7. At around 7 o'clock in the morning, the paper towels littered on the ground in front of the hotel can be seen impressively. Summary: The 5-star evaluation should match the hotel's own services and hardware, not defined by the score. Customers have their own experience. If there are problems again and again, it is not an accidental situation.

Since the company customer came to the airport because there was Line 7 at the door, they always booked Sofitel, jumped in to do business, and checked the health code at the door like a display. Anyway, I personally came in without being checked for the health code. The hotel lobby More than half of the people who came to the meeting did not wear masks. The hotel did not have any reminders. The staff was extremely inefficient and moved very slowly. The Chinese restaurant was unpalatable.

msg:After my son and I checked in, we went to the hotel to swim, thinking that anyway, there were big bath towels in the swimming area, so I didn't bring our own clothes. As a result, after swimming, we found that there were no large bath towels in the locker room, only towels. We had to go back to the room quickly. We took the elevator and found that we couldn’t swipe the card and could not go to our floor. After tossing in the elevator for a long time, we finally ran back to the front desk of the gym. The front desk told me that the card was demagnetized. What? Demagnetized after not using it once? The gym said she called the reception desk and came over and drove us into the room. We waited for a long time at the door of the room. Our son shivered and said that his mother was so cold. But I picked up the floor phone and dialed the reception again. The reception was only late. The next day’s breakfast buffet, my son had been waiting for a long time in his swimsuit last night, and he immediately vomited after eating breakfast. I asked the waiter to come and clean it. I heard that customers passing by are going to have nausea. Really powerless to complain, the service is terrible

msg:The smell of the room is very heavy, and the temperature of the air conditioner can't be beaten down. After staying for 2 days, an engineer has to repair the air conditioner every night before it can be used. The water from the toilet tap has floating objects on the cup, and there are few choices for breakfast, and it is still cold. Can such a hotel be considered high-end!

msg:This restaurant must be a long commentary, and it usually ends with a little five-star perfunctory. It was originally a Sofitel member, but this restaurant is undoubtedly the best service among the Sofitel I have stayed in. The attitude is very good and it is not too enthusiastic and comfortable. I was very thoughtful. When I was sitting at the door, I observed and greeted every customer who arrived with a smile. The environment is elegant, the design is full, and the sleeping environment is consistently comfortable.

msg:住了兩天後，感覺不錯，選擇了續住。杭州英冠索菲特酒店的餐飲也很棒。早餐品種非常豐富，除了一般五星級酒店的早餐標配外，英冠索菲特有一些自己的特色餐品，比如貓耳朵、杭州特產葱包檜等等。更值得點讚的是，早餐每天還會換一些東西，讓續住的客人始終保持新鮮感。
非常建議購買行政酒廊待遇，下午茶很精緻，甜點、鹹點、曲奇餅乾都挺好吃。與家人好友喝喝茶，聊聊天，還是相當愜意的。歡樂時光有壽司、熱菜、炒飯、還有洋酒，菜品味道很不錯。歡樂時光5點半開始，在34樓的行政酒廊一邊品酒，一邊欣賞美麗的落日，很是浪漫，恍若到了海邊的度假酒店。
原本預訂了一家杭州很難訂到的餐廳，因為酒店的歡樂時光很不錯，果斷取消預訂，第二天繼續選擇在歡樂時光用餐。對了，兩天的歡樂時光熱菜菜單，可是完全不同的哦！

msg:經常世界各地跑，住過酒店不計其數。杭州英冠索菲特酒店可以説是同級別酒店中最好的，性價比非常高。酒店整個裝修風格，既保留了索菲特品牌特有的法式浪漫，也兼顧了詩畫江南的特色。
硬件好，服務佳，這6個字可以大致概括杭州英冠索菲特酒店。作為一家2021年開業的酒店，硬件設施相當不錯。全自動的抽水馬桶，雙洗手枱……全是奢華酒店的配置。床品也是延續了索菲特酒店的高標準，非常舒適。
現在，硬件設施不錯的酒店不少，但很多酒店差在服務，而在杭州英冠索菲特酒店，完全給你賓至如歸的感覺。
預訂酒店後，馬上就有管家與我聯繫，詳細詢問入住要求。由於工作的關係，需要接線板，第二天進入房間，發現接線板早已準備好放在房間。電話中，我衹是提了一句，馬上要過生日。入住之後，酒店送上了驚喜——生日蛋糕🍰。
入住第一晚，由於周邊的工地和小區比較吵，跟酒店反應。雖然這完全不是酒店的問題，但酒店積極處理，甚至表示如果大晚上搬行李不方便，可以把行李放在原房間，人住另外一個房間。兩位值班經理潘經理和肖經理，處理問題既專業又周到，體現了相當高的酒店管理水平。換了房後，房間很安靜，休息得很不錯。
入住期間，管家薇薇一直與我保持聯繫，噓寒問暖，詢問還有什麼需求。尤其不容易的是，休假期間，薇薇還不忘詢問入住期間還有什麼需要。有一次薇薇發訊息給我的時候，正好水喝完了，我隨口説了一句，正在外地休假的她，馬上請同事送水過來。
入住前，曾擔心酒店在蕭山區，遊玩不方便。事實上，酒店距離7號線明星路站非常近，地鐵出站後有一個口直通酒店，哪怕下雨天都淋不到雨。
以後到杭州，英冠索菲特酒店就是不二的選擇了。

msg:非常好的服務，特別是賓客關係的管家很温馨，滿足我們的各種需求，有求必應啊，下次還會入住！酒店位置挺好，出門就是地鐵，周邊也有各種小吃餐館，前台服務周到，有問必答。酒店乾淨，隔音效果也好。離店秒走。早上八點多到的酒店，本來是打算把行李寄存一下，到下午遊玩回再住店的，沒想到管家十分貼心，讓我們提前住店，晚上回到酒店後，客房阿姨很熱情，酒店準備了水果還有歡迎卡片，真的很用心很貼心，房間環境還不錯，簡潔，用品齊全，也很舒適，早餐也還不錯，走的時候前台也是各種詢問問我們入住體驗好不好，有沒有什麼可以給到的建議，特別虛心接受，下次來杭州還回來的，我們住的挺開心的。

msg:去年入住過杭州英冠索菲特酒店，此次入住一如既往的很滿意，安排的房間也非常的喜歡，這次入住是因為出差到了蕭山，酒店的價格性價比很高，大堂吧的咖啡果汁很好喝！！！地理位置也很優越，附近有七號線地鐵站，便利出行，酒店周圍也有一些小吃，星巴克、炸串，尤其是賓客關係小姐姐服務態度很專業，熱情體貼，美中不足的是沒有能多待幾天，之後出差還會選擇這裏！！！

msg:大，房間大，床大，浴室大，水大，大的讓我一開始以為春節這酒店沒什麼人呢。
酒店的房間的佈局也是很合理，獨立衞生間與浴室分開，浴室很大，有浴缸和淋浴房，雙台盆。房間的燈光非常喜歡，有幾個模式選擇，全部打開以後，房間非常明亮，不像有些酒店暗沉沉幾個小燈光。
春節期間到了餐廳才發現人超級多，不知道酒店平時有沒有領位，反正春節期間好像是沒有，需要自己找位置坐，找服務員要餐具，還有客人為了位置吵架差點打起來，這個可能需要酒店改進。
第二天換了7點就餐，感覺就一下子好了很多，早餐品種不算太多，湯麪還挺好吃。
最後説一下，管家服務還挺熱情，會提前告知天氣，有需要也會及時對應，提醒客人評價也沒錯，但是如果盯着客人評價總是有點小不爽的。
總體，如果自駕，目的地在蕭山，湘湖附近的，這個酒店是個不錯的選擇。

優點：
1.去大蓮花是比較方便的6轉7。
2.這次入住33層，整晚很安靜，説是有團隊，但是無影響。
3.床品很舒服，床墊是住過的酒店中算蠻不錯的。
4.周邊小吃店很多，吃飯方便。
缺點：
1.攜程有升級房型禮遇，但酒店説當天客滿無法操作，我是四月入住 三月就預訂，提前一個月酒店安排房間應該不是問題。

前台小姐姐一路就給升級了行政大床房，34層的高樓，夜景還是很有feel的。
再説地理位置，雖然屬於蕭山，但就在奧體邊，離濱江商圈也是很近的。離西湖有些距離，不過邊上就有地鐵站。自駕住這家酒店是首選。

我對住所有潔癖，最在意的就是布草是否乾淨，這方面做的完全沒毛病。本來這個價位，其實對服務沒有抱太大期望。但是這家索菲特的服務完全有點超預期。我定的行政房，不確定是不是因為行政禮遇，入住前就有人打電話給我，雖然我沒接到。辦理入住也很順利，還送了個小竹編燈籠。房間裏有準備好的果盤，還有小甜品，會客到客房，也有開夜床服務。雖然行政酒廊和早餐我給浪費了，哈哈因為沒能起床。但是真的很感謝美女小姐姐Zana，我凌晨發vx問她能不能延遲退房，第二天醒來看消息已經幫我延遲到四點了。最近兩週在國內差旅住了蠻多類似柏悦，君悦，安達仕，尼依格羅一級的酒店，整體下來真的是這家索菲特服務給了最大的驚喜。

一些中肯的看法：千萬別因為大堂布局和酒店外觀
低估這間酒店，房間的內飾完全沒毛病，輕奢簡中風格。

唯一略遺憾的是酒店的備品都是大瓶，某種意義上節約成本和環保？牙膏是真心不行hh，但是反正我都是自己帶。其實備品真的還蠻想帶走一組hh，蠻喜歡的香味。

説説不足的地方，定的帶早餐的房間，也收了帶早餐的價格，可是第一天去吃的時候十點了還在排隊進餐廳，想想打個包吧，咖啡機也是各種排隊等，好不容易等到了，拿回去一喝簡直無法入口，拿鐵喝出了焦味。第二天就不敢去吃了，免得影響遊玩的心情。可能準備不足難以應付那麼多的客人。

msg:房間空調不能製冷的，酒店給出的理由是沒到開通的月份，不論當天是否天氣炎熱，也不論客人體質是否怕熱，均不能自主製冷或者制熱，也就是房間的温度不能根據個人體質自主調節的。
衹有一小片頂窗可以打開很小的角度，空調控制器顯示，入住3天2晚房間温度都在28—29度，全程悶熱狀態。
交涉好幾回，酒店態度不錯，但是均表示沒辦法，衹能提供電風扇一台，事實上對降温毫無作用。
特別不能理解，800左右的房價竟然沒有選擇温度的權力，並且辦理入住的時候前台沒有告知房間温度不能自主控制。
態度很好，但是態度換不來舒適的住宿體驗，吃此一塹長一智，以後旅遊訂房時，一定要問清楚，能否自主控制房間温度，並且辦理入住前一定要去房間查看空調是否可以製冷和制熱。

設施：房間設備設施沒得説，也住過很多酒店了，這裏確實是我喜歡的風格，設施設備好。健身房泳池沒得説了，真的很不錯！
衞生：衞生很乾凈，打掃我們房間的客房大姐很熱情，送東西也很及時。
早餐：這裏的早餐品質很好哦，種類多和JW萬豪差不多的品質，餐廳領位的是餐廳經理chuck人很好，會關注我家裡人的喜好 。第二天也會提前幫我把喜歡的咖啡送到位置，細節了。
服務：酒店的服務員都是熱情親切的，每次路過前台都會熱情親切對待我，入住時候禮賓部有幫忙拉行李，退房的時候前台的Monica親切詢問入住體驗，還送我們門口上車，感覺酒店很暖心。
新年住了三四天很滿意，也成功變成了一個雅高粉。五分好評好評～
