From 4.13 pm to 4.14 am, the lady in charge of check-in at the front desk and another man in charge of reception in the restaurant were very responsible and had a very good service attitude!
The hardware facilities are very good, and the room is also equipped with a microwave, which is very convenient.
It's off-season now, so there aren't many guests, but the hotel's breakfast is still good, with freshly made noodles, buns, sandwiches, fried eggs, milk, coffee, and fruits.
The hotel parking lot is in the basement. I feel that if there are many guests, there will not be enough parking spaces. It would be better if it can be equipped with tram charging piles in the future!
All in all, the overall experience is good and I will come again in the future!

You basically don't need to wear a coat. The front desk service is very good. We upgraded the mountain view room and actively solved any problems with the room. The breakfast is exquisite, with both Chinese and Western food. I really want to praise the ice milk. The room is quite large and has a balcony. Because the air conditioner temperature is very high, it is also equipped with a humidifier. Oranges and drinks were given, and the oranges were very sweet. The only drawback is that the garage is a bit small, and the parking space is a bit tight when you come back at night.

There were also fruits in the room, and knowing that we brought children, Wangzai milk and potato chips were also given.

There is a concierge at the front desk to help with luggage. The guest rooms are also very clean. I slept there and felt that their mattresses were very comfortable and refreshing. I specifically asked the guest room what kind of mattress the Winter Olympics guests stayed in. Is it a King Koil mattress? After skiing, I saw a lot of horses on the mountain next to the hotel. It feels like a mountain home. The breakfast is very rich. It is very comfortable and you don‚Äôt need to eat at noon when you go skiing! Greatüëç

The most worth mentioning is that the mattress is very comfortable! It is said to be Jin Keer's! When I checked in at night, I was given drinks and fruits. If I have to say a shortcoming, it is that the smell of the decoration has not yet dissipated.
Breakfast: A big surprise!! There are many types of food provided, including shrimp dumplings, steamed chicken feet, smoked salmon, and French toast that I love. For a foodie, I am very satisfied with this hotel.
It is a hotel that I will stay in next time!

msg:A very cost-effective serviced apar**ent. In terms of room facilities, because I have a mild obsession with cleanliness, I can't stand old furniture and bathrooms with serious signs of use, as well as the long-lasting smell in the room. Everything here is new, very clean and comfortable, which makes people feel happy. The furniture and carpet in the room have good color matching. There is also a simple open kitchen with a microwave and a refrigerator. A large amount of mineral water is given every day. There is also a fruit plate when you check in. The basic living guarantee for skiing is no problem. In terms of the hotel, the breakfast is very rich. I strongly recommend beef noodles, and there is no need to queue. The restaurant environment is very spacious. The hamburgers and pizzas for dinner are also good. There is a laundry room with three washing machines and three dryers, but you have to bring your own laundry detergent. The indoor parking lot is not large but free, and it is very convenient to go from the room. The snow in the past two days solved a big problem, and you don't have to get up early to shovel snow. The gym is small and practical. The swimming pool and hot water massage pool are the favorites of children. They have been soaking in them after skiing and refuse to come out. In terms of service, the staff here are all young people, very enthusiastic, polite and dedicated. Finally, let's talk about the location. It is recommended to drive here. It is only a ten-minute drive from Yunding Snow Resort, five or six minutes to Taiwu, and 20 minutes to the county town. There is no traffic jam on the road and it is very smooth, but there are really few restaurants or supermarkets on foot. You need to pay a deposit of 800 yuan before checking in, and it will be refunded to the card immediately when you check out. Ctrip's courtesy hotel is also fulfilled. To be honest, this price can be said to be the king of cost-effectiveness near the ski resort.

Needless to say, the breakfast is far beyond expectations! The service is also very good, and the young brothers and sisters are enthusiastic and attentive. The only thing that may not be perfect is the location, but the hotel has a reservation for a shuttle bus, which also perfectly solves the transportation problem.
I felt the five-star service at the front desk on the first day of my stay. Vincent really helped us to coordinate and arrange the room and travel transportation matters tirelessly, and also introduced us to fun things. Full of touching! During the Chinese New Year, we organized guests to make dumplings, draw prizes, and children to make lanterns. There were too many activities and I was too busy. I also skied for a day, and it was great to soak in the massage pool in the swimming pool!
In short, it exceeded expectations!

We came here on Friday and were the only residents of the hotel that night. We confirmed with the front desk that we would have breakfast at 8:30 the next day. We arrived at the restaurant on time the next morning, but because there were special customers who came to have breakfast, we waited until 9:05 to see the porridge, and other food was not served until 9:25.

At this point, we didn't want to leave a negative review because the front desk and restaurant staff were very serious and apologetic. What made us decide to leave a negative review was that while we were waiting, a certain leader of the hotel was at our table to warmly entertain special customers. Completely ignored and waited for almost an hour after we arrived as promised.

If the time agreed in advance can be ignored, it is recommended not to open to ordinary individual customers.
