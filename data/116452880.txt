msg:The hotel was previously responsible for hosting the Winter Olympics, and it was just opened to the public at the beginning of this year.
From 4.13 pm to 4.14 am, the lady in charge of check-in at the front desk and another man in charge of reception in the restaurant were very responsible and had a very good service attitude!
The hardware facilities are very good, and the room is also equipped with a microwave, which is very convenient.
It's off-season now, so there aren't many guests, but the hotel's breakfast is still good, with freshly made noodles, buns, sandwiches, fried eggs, milk, coffee, and fruits.
The hotel parking lot is in the basement. I feel that if there are many guests, there will not be enough parking spaces. It would be better if it can be equipped with tram charging piles in the future!
All in all, the overall experience is good and I will come again in the future!

You basically don't need to wear a coat. The front desk service is very good. We upgraded the mountain view room and actively solved any problems with the room. The breakfast is exquisite, with both Chinese and Western food. I really want to praise the ice milk. The room is quite large and has a balcony. Because the air conditioner temperature is very high, it is also equipped with a humidifier. Oranges and drinks were given, and the oranges were very sweet. The only drawback is that the garage is a bit small, and the parking space is a bit tight when you come back at night.

There is a concierge at the front desk to help with luggage. The guest rooms are also very clean. I slept there and felt that their mattresses were very comfortable and refreshing. I specifically asked the guest room what kind of mattress the Winter Olympics guests stayed in. Is it a King Koil mattress? After skiing, I saw a lot of horses on the mountain next to the hotel. It feels like a mountain home. The breakfast is very rich. It is very comfortable and you don’t need to eat at noon when you go skiing! Great👍

If I have to say a shortcoming, it is that the smell of the decoration has not yet dissipated.
Breakfast: A big surprise!! There are many types of food provided, including shrimp dumplings, steamed chicken feet, smoked salmon, and French toast that I love. For a foodie, I am very satisfied with this hotel.

msg:A very cost-effective serviced apar**ent. In terms of room facilities, because I have a mild obsession with cleanliness, I can't stand old furniture and bathrooms with serious signs of use, as well as the long-lasting smell in the room. Everything here is new, very clean and comfortable, which makes people feel happy. The furniture and carpet in the room have good color matching. There is also a simple open kitchen with a microwave and a refrigerator. A large amount of mineral water is given every day. There is also a fruit plate when you check in. The basic living guarantee for skiing is no problem. In terms of the hotel, the breakfast is very rich. I strongly recommend beef noodles, and there is no need to queue. The restaurant environment is very spacious. The hamburgers and pizzas for dinner are also good. There is a laundry room with three washing machines and three dryers, but you have to bring your own laundry detergent. The indoor parking lot is not large but free, and it is very convenient to go from the room. The snow in the past two days solved a big problem, and you don't have to get up early to shovel snow. The gym is small and practical. The swimming pool and hot water massage pool are the favorites of children. They have been soaking in them after skiing and refuse to come out. In terms of service, the staff here are all young people, very enthusiastic, polite and dedicated. Finally, let's talk about the location. It is recommended to drive here. It is only a ten-minute drive from Yunding Snow Resort, five or six minutes to Taiwu, and 20 minutes to the county town. There is no traffic jam on the road and it is very smooth, but there are really few restaurants or supermarkets on foot. You need to pay a deposit of 800 yuan before checking in, and it will be refunded to the card immediately when you check out. Ctrip's courtesy hotel is also fulfilled. To be honest, this price can be said to be the king of cost-effectiveness near the ski resort.

Needless to say, the breakfast is far beyond expectations! The service is also very good, and the young brothers and sisters are enthusiastic and attentive. The only thing that may not be perfect is the location, but the hotel has a reservation for a shuttle bus, which also perfectly solves the transportation problem.
I felt the five-star service at the front desk on the first day of my stay. Vincent really helped us to coordinate and arrange the room and travel transportation matters tirelessly, and also introduced us to fun things. Full of touching! During the Chinese New Year, we organized guests to make dumplings, draw prizes, and children to make lanterns. There were too many activities and I was too busy. I also skied for a day, and it was great to soak in the massage pool in the swimming pool!
In short, it exceeded expectations!

We came here on Friday and were the only residents of the hotel that night. We confirmed with the front desk that we would have breakfast at 8:30 the next day. We arrived at the restaurant on time the next morning, but because there were special customers who came to have breakfast, we waited until 9:05 to see the porridge, and other food was not served until 9:25.

At this point, we didn't want to leave a negative review because the front desk and restaurant staff were very serious and apologetic. What made us decide to leave a negative review was that while we were waiting, a certain leader of the hotel was at our table to warmly entertain special customers. Completely ignored and waited for almost an hour after we arrived as promised.

If the time agreed in advance can be ignored, it is recommended not to open to ordinary individual customers.

辦入住，晚上8點多到的，前面有一人辦入住，排隊的過程中，有個服務員帶了一名男士過來説要結賬，就插隊到我的前面去了，辦入住的工作人員很自然的先給結賬的男士辦理了，很窩火😡
定了兩間房，説是挨在一起的，房號確實是連着的，結果離得特別遠，工作人員對酒店事務太不熟悉。
泳池開放時間是10點到晚上9點，每週二還休息，哪有酒店的泳池開放時間這麼短的，水還涼的很。
房間有陽台，門卻別著不讓開，不知道為什麼。

1，酒店位置非常偏僻，附近沒有任何商業和配套設施，無法解決餐飲問題，而且因為崇禮打車極其不方便，導致出門和回酒店是個大問題；
2，入住之前致電酒店説是有酒店的車輛可以接送，結果酒店衹有一輛車根本沒空接送你，酒店預訂了花樣滑冰的門票，居然給了過期的門票，搞得進不了表演廳，最關鍵的是酒店有個所謂的女的“**”公車私用也不給客人使用還擺了張臭臉，居然被我遇見公車私用是為了自己去看錶演！這********，**！
3，酒店管理混亂，人員極其不專業，酒店大堂在一個山坡上，門口隨意停車也沒人管，導致打車回來需要爬山坡回酒店，酒店服務員送個東西也要半天才送。
4，酒店不知道是新裝修還是很久沒啟用一股嚴重的裝修味道瀰漫房間，酒店餐廳員工的培訓也不到位，新的餐具居然可以和擦桌子的摸布混一起拿，無語…
5，唯一欣慰的是前台有一位**主管還算負責盡心！

msg:住了那麼多酒店，近幾年為數不多的除了房費還需要額外付款800按金的酒店。
酒店離太舞小鎮4分鐘車程，當地打車出行不太方便，酒店開始説衹有車接高鐵站，沒有車送小鎮，在我的堅持下協調司機接送。覺得他們區別對待沒有真正的從客户的需求出發，協調司機時間很長，前台小哥説沒什麼權限，聯繫經理又一直不回覆。感覺酒店管理銜接，對客户的服務體驗不是很重視！最重要的，我昨天退了房，按金現在還沒退😠

msg:1月15號剛開業不久的酒店，訂之前查攜程沒有點評，心裏也沒譜，實際入住三天後感覺挺好。酒店距離太舞開車大概8分鐘，位於一個相對獨立的區域，很清凈，但是周邊也沒啥配套。下山對面是太舞小鎮，目前看大多處於關門狀態。酒店設施很新就不用説了，房間也很乾凈，地下車位有點少，如果白天出去滑雪回來晚可能沒有車位。早餐品類豐富，在太舞這個區域應該和其他的四五星酒店差別不大。午餐和晚餐是套餐為主，零點衹有西餐，所以正餐建議還是在雪場附近解決。銷售和前台非常熱情，一看就是剛開業培訓的很到位，這個服務態度和太舞小鎮那幾個一千多的酒店比起來，真是天壤之別。酒店提前一天聯繫我確認是否需要高鐵接駁。每天還詢問是否需要擺渡車去雪場所以不自駕的雪友也可以選擇，感覺應該交通上不存在什麼障礙。
