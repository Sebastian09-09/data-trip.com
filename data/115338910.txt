The front desk staff on the morning shift is enthusiastic, helping to introduce the surrounding environment and helping to upgrade to a river view room. The room has a strong sense of design, simple and practical.

msg:The hotel is very new, with a stylish layout and a rich breakfast variety. The front desk and cleaning ladies are very polite. There was a lot of traffic during the Spring Festival holiday, so it was understandable that the room delivery was delayed. During the waiting period, we thoughtfully provided coffee and upgraded to a suite for free. After experiencing the suite, from the perspective of the best among the best, we recommend: (1) Some of the power lines in room 388 are probably installed incorrectly, and the plug on one side of the bedside is dead; the lights in the living room and bathroom are directly connected to the toilet lights in the room. When turning on and off synchronously, the bathroom lights in the room cannot be controlled independently. In the middle of the night, the bathroom lights in the room cannot be turned on. When I want to use the toilet outside the living room, as soon as the light is turned on, the mirror lights in the room are directly turned on again. Frightened family members and children. (2) The bathroom partitions in the room are detailed, and there are two sets of wash basins and faucets, but there are no hooks for washing items, and there is no space to put clean clothes on the stone table. The bathroom space is not large, and there is no possibility to hang clothes to dry. After washing, you have to come out of the basin area to get dressed, but the door to the wash area does not close tightly at all, which is really inconvenient for families with children.

The waiters are very warm and considerate and ask to keep warm. The room is also very clean, and the bedding is relatively comfortable. I think this hotel is excellent value for money. Value for money, recommended!

msg:The hotel is located in the Shanshui Shuanghe Scenic Area of ​​Qianpai Town, at the foot of Fengche Mountain, with a good location.
Let's talk about the advantages first:
The hotel is brand new, with a good design style. At least it can be ranked in the top ten among the hundreds of hotels I have stayed in. The service is in place, and they also helped me upgrade the room type for free, and took me to see several room types before letting me choose whether to upgrade or not. This is worth a thumbs up👍. The view from the viewing balcony is also very good! Although there are not many types of breakfast, they are all very exquisite. The key is that they are very hygienic, and the restaurant service is also impeccable!
Let's talk about the disadvantages:
The hotel navigation is very poor. After arriving at the navigation, there is no sign of where the door is and where to park. The key is to design the door at the back and the parking lot entrance on the side. This is incomprehensible.
In addition, as a resort hotel, at this price, the room is indeed a bit small and cramped. The shower room should be designed in the middle, and the water will overflow directly to the bed when taking a shower. There is no leisure table and chair on the landscape balcony, only a hanging basket. It is a waste of such a good view without sitting and watching the scenery!
Sincerely suggest that the hotel can improve as soon as possible, and don't let the originally good hotel lose in details!
