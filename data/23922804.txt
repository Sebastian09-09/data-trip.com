The place is furthermore a cosy getaway, quiet and remote, to enjoy a romantic stay. The staff is very helpful and aware of our needs and made our stay, even with mediocre weather conditions, just breathtakingly comfortable. 
I hope we find an opportunity t come again.

msg:I had an amazing stay at this resort! Lu lu was super helpful and made the experience seamless. The restaurant was great, especially for breakfast. The hot spring bath was a highlight - the staff made sure that the water temperature was exactly to our liking and provided hot tea and towels for our use. The grounds are well-maintained and beautiful. The only negative I could say is that they did not offer massage services when I stayed, even though it was advertised online. Maybe because it was the low season or because they forgot to update the listing?

Hotel organized for us a pick on arrival, also brought us down to the entrance every morning, and even wanted to organize a transfer back but we had own arrangement for a day. We received TV, based on request, and enjoyed fruits and tea in the room while watching favorite movies. I explained to the kitchen ayi how to do breakfast eggs so managed not to get hungry over Chinese breakfast (never closing doors in winter). Dinner is available as well or you can get a taxi to the city - 20 min, we enjoyed Korean barbecue for two nights. Pity we could not try the pool and jacuzzi, it was very cold. Great service and great recharging stay, thank you for everything ZiShan Resort!

Nothing is over manicured and a lot of the plants and flowers are left to live their own natural life. This creates a nice and natural atmosphere. The food in the restaurant is definitely the best in the area and we throughly enjoyed all of it. Me and my wife stayed for three nights and loved every minute of it. Is it cheap?

Transportation: Wulingyuan Scenic Area is close to the middle gate, and it is very convenient to enter and exit the scenic area. The hotel arranges business cars to pick up from the middle gate, and will also contact guests in advance to arrange airport pick-up;
Environmental sanitation: The hotel terrace can overlook the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãclouds and mountains, and the greening inside the hotel is very good;
Food: The restaurant has a buffet breakfast, and the local rice noodles in Hunan are delicious üòã. The dinner is even more delicious than the outside restaurant made by the local chef in Hunan. I recommend stir-fried beef;
Service: Butler service makes guests feel at home; our butler Lulu is beautiful and kind. She arranged the airport pick-up the day before and informed us of the weather to prepare clothes; recommended the tour plan to Wuling Scenic Area, so that our self-guided tour was orderly; even arranged ginger tea to remove moisture and coldness after the tour on rainy days, and cared for us; you can also drink the special Zhangjiajie berry tea.
So much so that during the stay, I recommended my family to choose this hotel when traveling to Zhangjiajie, and I will never regret it.
In short, perfect travel, pleasant accommodation, and lovely butler.
Next time I come, I will choose Zishan Manju.

The hotel has a beautiful environment, and you can see that a lot of detail has been put into it. The service staff are sincere and enthusiastic. Our Lulu butler paid full attention to us from before check-in to after check-out, and was very considerate. There are also some experience projects in the hotel, such as cycling, dressing up and taking photos, etc., but it is a pity that there is no time to experience it. In the evening, there will be a resident singer singing live in the "Time Concert" recording, which is full of atmosphere. In short, I will come back if I have the opportunity in the future. I heard that the snow scenery in winter is also very beautiful, so I will definitely come and take a look.

Manju is only a few hundred meters away from the middle gate of Zhangjiajie National Forest Park. It is just a short walk away and it is very convenient to visit the scenic spot.

There are not many tourists at this gate, so there is no need to queue up. It is highly recommended.
The breakfast and dinner in the restaurant are delicious, especially the dinner, which is much better than the private dishes outside. I really regret not eating in the hotel on the first day.
The service of the housekeeper Xiao Deng was super nice. He was always available and met all the requirements within his authority. He was very considerate in arranging vehicle pick-up and drop-off for the two-day trip to Zimugangmen.
If I come to Zhangjiajie again, I will definitely choose this hotel.

msg:Location:
In Longweiba Village, this village is close to the Zimugang Ticket Station and is also called the Southeast Gate, not the South Gate. Zhangjiajie has four gates: the East Gate is close to the Tianzi Mountain Scenic Area. The disadvantage is that it takes a long time to take the eco-friendly car to the center of the park to transfer to the four gates around the water; the West Gate is close to Yangjiajie. If you have a short travel time, you can ignore Yangjiajie, which is relatively unpopular; the South Gate is close to Jinbianxi and Huangshizhai. The disadvantage is that the eco-friendly car cannot reach the South Gate and you need to walk; finally, the Southeast Gate is also Zimugang, which is closest to the four gates around the water and the closest to Yuanjiajie. It is also a must-go for the transfer of the park. So I recommend staying near the Southeast Gate! Zishan Manju is a 5-minute walk to the Southeast Gate! If you don‚Äôt want to walk, the housekeeper will also arrange the hotel‚Äôs car to pick up and drop off every guest between the Southeast Gate and the hotel.
Environment:
It is a homestay style, and the environment and rooms are up to the level of a five-star hotel. The quiet courtyard, the wide lawn, and the thousand-year-old trees all make you feel comfortable and comfortable.
Service:
I think the exclusive butler service is the most satisfying and thoughtful highlight of Zishan Manju. Our housekeeper Miao Miao serves us online and offline 24 hours a day, solving all small problems! On the day we left, we left too early to have breakfast, so Miao Miao went to the kitchen to communicate with the chef to pack breakfast for us in advance, which touched us very much! It was dark, and she led us to the field to experience digging bamboo shoots and cooked delicious braised bamboo shoots for us for free. Every day, she patiently and punctually arranged the hotel's free shuttle service for us!
Dishes:
We only had one breakfast and one dinner in the hotel. The price was right, the dishes were very delicate, and the taste was unanimously praised by my companions.
Pickup: The pick-up was extremely punctual and thoughtful. It was not a matter of money. Everyone could afford the taxi fare, but it was such a free pick-up that made us feel more convenient and more at ease.

Serious evaluation, thank Miao Miao, thank everyone who served us at Zishan Manju!

Actually, I don't like to stay in homestays, fearing that the quality control is unstable, but Zishan Manju is indeed the best hotel in Zhangjiajie (note, it is compared with all hotels). First of all, the pick-up at the station was very timely. Lulu Butler contacted us in advance to arrange it. The driver said that if there are different orders, they will send cars separately, and they will not share cars. They still pay attention to customer experience. The restaurant is amazing. I was afraid that the food would be average before I came, but the Chinese restaurant is so delicious, the specialties are good, and the breakfast is also rich, which is better than some five-star hotels. It rained on both days when we planned to go to Zhangjiajie Forest Park, but we still went there for most of the day when the rain stopped. They also sent a car to take us to the middle gate, which was very convenient. The next day, it rained too much, so we boiled tea around the stove, which felt very romantic. üåπFinally, I would like to thank Lulu Butler for his thoughtful service, many very good warm tips, and waiting for us to arrive at the hotel when we returned late. One day, he waited until very late to introduce us to the attractions and tour routes. Really very satisfied üëçThe room quality and environment are also great.

Since I checked into Zishan Manju, accompanied by Lulu housekeeper, we have completely changed our perception of the service level of domestic hotels. It turns out that hotel services can be so meticulous and considerate. Lulu housekeeper has done that as long as you have reasonable needs, he can actively find ways to meet them as much as possible. The service is a 24-hour one-to-one private housekeeper, which does not affect the guests' stay, but can also be on call, pick up, explain, accompany services, arrange surrounding tours, and have very high reception standards, smiles, and careful care, making people feel at home.

Because there was no twin room option at that time, we booked a king-size bed room. After the telephone communication, considering that we were two adults and one child, Susu also helped to upgrade the parent-child room. I am especially grateful to her. If there is a next time, I will definitely specify her. Of course, the scenery of the hotel is really invincible and beautiful. It is a natural oxygen bar. After staying in the city for a long time, I am used to the fast-paced overtime study and traffic jams. Here I can read quietly and slow down. The core scenic spot is near Zishan Manju. Have lunch, go to the scenic spot to play and walk in the afternoon, breathe the fresh air, and spend a day leisurely and fulfilling. Finally, I have to praise the hotel's breakfast. It is not as bad as some of the comments say. I think the rice noodles for breakfast are YYDS, and the braised beef in chicken soup is absolutely amazing.

msg:We stayed at Zishan Manju on the last day of Qingming Festival. The hotel is not far from the southeast gate of Zimugang, Wulingyuan. The environment inside is very good. You can see the mountains of Wulingyuan Scenic Area in the room. When you get up in the morning and open the curtains, you feel like you are swimming in a painting. In addition, the hotel's service is very thoughtful. The room manager Xiaokai contacted us the day before we checked in and provided meticulous service from the moment we arrived at Manju, including taking us to experience bamboo forest archery, digging spring bamboo shoots, singing, boiling tea around the stove, introducing us to the history of Zimu, introducing life in the mountains of Zhangjiajie, and brewing Zhangjiajie tea for us, making us feel at home. Finally, I would like to praise the hotel's meals. The breakfast is very delicate, and they also fried a dish of bamboo shoots for us, which tastes great. A very satisfactory experience. If I bring my family to Zhangjiajie next time, I will consider staying here again.

msg:The environment and service are impeccable. Before checking in, a business car was arranged to pick us up at the high-speed rail station. After leaving the station, we never had to carry our luggage by ourselves. It was very convenient for the two ladies. The environment is very beautiful, with both the simplicity of the village and the exquisite design. From checking in, to the room, to the restaurant, to the evening concert, there is tea everywhere, from Pu'er, black tea to black tea, and many different teas are drunk in a day. At more than nine o'clock in the evening, the housekeeper Xiaoxin was still explaining the tour route to us. The explanation was very detailed. We wanted to try berry tea and baked glutinous rice cakes around the stove. Even at more than nine o'clock in the evening, Xiaoxin was still not impatient at all, very enthusiastic and kind. The housekeepers we met in the whole Manju were very enthusiastic, even if they were not our housekeepers, they were enthusiastic to serve us. The prices in the restaurant are unexpectedly normal, and the quality of the ingredients is very high. The local chicken has the fragrance of local chicken, and there are old farmers who go to dig a basket of spring bamboo shoots and hand them over to the restaurant. The wild vegetables are very fresh, and some vegetables are picked directly from the vegetable garden, which is very safe to eat. What needs to be improved is that the cleaning ladies are all from the mountains and may not be so particular about hygiene. I hope there will be an additional hygiene acceptance link to inspect the cleaning quality of the cleaning ladies.

msg:During my trip to Zhangjiajie, a B&B called "Zishan Manju" was highly recommended by my friends, saying it was the most beautiful B&B at the ceiling level.
As a hotelier, I have almost never stayed in a B&B in the past few years, and I am afraid of stepping into the trap of all kinds of irregularities.
The summary of my 4 days and 3 nights in Manju: It smells really good!
Butler Xiao Tang confirmed all matters with me a week ago. He also served my friend who lived there before. He was so meticulous and considerate that I always thought it was a girl. When he picked me up at the high-speed rail station, he turned out to be a handsome guy!
Let‚Äôs show the beauty of Manju with the photos that I take crazily every day. What I like most is its blues time, and I also really like its glass study room, the warm flames of the fireplace, the fragrant sweet potatoes, corn, and milk tea in the baking pan... I drag my tired steps back every day (I still come back to and from the scenic spot) Pick-up and drop-off), Butler Xiao Tang has prepared these. It doesn't feel like I'm going back to the hotel, it's like going home.
Manju‚Äôs hot spring pool just came online on December 1st, and I was lucky enough to be one of the first people to experience it. Outdoors, among the flowers and green trees, the pink gauze curtain hangs low and the water is dense, creating a charming scene. The resting pavilion is even more ingenious, decorated with ginkgo leaves intertwined one by one. Butler Xiao Tang and the service staff at Manju were busy making sure we had a comfortable stay.
The breakfast is excellent, small and exquisite. There are always small dried fruits in the glass bottles in the restaurant, so you can eat them as you like.
I visit scenic spots every day, and I feel like I have to leave before I‚Äôve had enough. The circle of friends I posted has also attracted a group of friends, who are clamoring to come together next time.

Overall five-star praise! Special mention is given to our housekeeper, Xiao Kai.

Zishan Manju also has a swimming pool. It will open on December 1st. You need to make a reservation in advance. This is a good place to relax on vacation. Come to Zhangjiajie.

When you go to the hotel door, you will go out to greet you and help you with your luggage. When you come back from a trip, the housekeeper will be waiting for you at the door. I really recommend it, no matter where you go. It is a B&B recognized by everyone. The food in the restaurant is highly recommended and tastes very good. Every service staff is very considerate and meticulous, especially the housekeeper Susu. She even ran away when I wanted some tea late at night. I came over and gave you a tea set for making tea, which was really heart-warming! Living here is a kind of enjoyment, the ultimate enjoyment for body and soul. We also upgraded the room type for free, and later we extended our stay at a preferential price. It was really good and highly recommended!

msg:The first time I came to Zhangjiajie, I stayed at this legendary Hunan B&B with ceilings. The overall feeling is very good!

+ The hotel design perfectly combines rural beauty with modern luxury.
+ Butler service is very friendly and considerate. Thanks to Xiaokai Butler and the service team!
+ The breakfast and dinner in the restaurant were delicious.
+ Convenient to go to Forest Park. Close to Zi Mugang Gate. Moreover, there are relatively few people at Zimugang Gate.

- Zimugangmen is a relatively unpopular entrance. This also causes traffic in the park to be diverted to other gates, resulting in sometimes long waits for buses...
- The place is relatively remote, so it may not be very convenient to go to other attractions and shops. When we stayed here, we mainly focused on Forest Park and generally had no other needs, so there was no problem.
- Although the stone pavement and dim lighting are very stylish, it is relatively inconvenient to walk. It was troublesome to carefully look at the road and the boxes (the housekeeper helped, thank you for the hard work of the housekeeper).

P.S.
1. Because it was our first time to visit Zhangjiajie, we mainly visited the Forest Park and did not have much time to enjoy various activities in the hotel, such as making tea, sweet potato tasting, etc. It will be a good experience if you have the chance.
2. I didn‚Äôt try the swimming pool because it was cold.
3. Because of the cold and off-season, I was unable to experience some activities, such as the Time Concert.

msg:This high-end B&B was much worse than expected. It is next to the forest park and the scenery is beautiful. I booked it after seeing the reviews, but after arriving, I felt that the service was still much worse than hotels of the same price. After we arrived, the driver arranged by the hotel was late. I told him that I hoped to arrive as soon as possible with the elderly and children. The driver asked us to wait for him at the entrance. He was late and parked the car in the parking lot. We pushed the luggage to the parking lot by ourselves. He was cold and didn't help with pushing the luggage. The housekeeper was arranged by me after I contacted the B&B the night before in advance. Unlike the five-star hotels in Changsha and the Su Lu Lianhua B&B in Fenghuang Ancient Town, they would contact us in advance. In short, everything was delayed and difficult, and they would never tell you unless you asked. You also need to walk a long way to eat, and if the villa you live in is not at the entrance, it is even farther. We live on the first floor and found that there are bugs on the bed. The lobby in the hotel did not arrange mosquito repellent incense seriously, and I was bitten by 3 big bags when I checked in... Before leaving, I booked a car from Ctrip to take us to the airport. When asked what souvenirs such an expensive B&B gave us, my answer is: absolutely nothing! The driver was also surprised. In short, this homestay greatly reduced the points of this trip to Zhangjiajie and is not recommended at all.

Not disappointed! It was a super relaxing two days~~ I stayed in a tree house on the first day. The tree house is a bit more original and the 270-degree panoramic windows are very nice. Changed to a view room the next day. Personally, I prefer the view room ~ the area is half larger than the tree house. Because we two girls are a little afraid of insects, we recommend the view room more!
The hotel meals are also quite delicious. You can make a reservation with the housekeeper in advance when you are about to return to the hotel from the scenic spot, so that you can eat when you get back. After the meal, you can also listen to the resident singer band singing ~ to relieve the fatigue of the day~~

The last time it seems to be more than 10 years ago, the reason for not choosing a homestay is because I am a person who has high requirements for accommodation. The last experience of a homestay was not good. very good. This time I was attracted by the environment of Manju, and after reading a lot of reviews, I decided to give it a try. Before checking in, the housekeeper Yoyo contacted me in advance to ask for the address where the car was picked up. After arriving at the location, Yoyo and the little brother who carried the luggage greeted me at the door. It really felt like home. Surrounding the surroundings, I am really amazed, it is so beautiful, the greenery and lawn in the yard are carefully taken care of, there is a large lawn in the middle, and a canopy is placed on it, (if possible, I suggest a few more, because after someone sits Others are embarrassed to pass) There is also a concert at night, although the singing is average, but the overall a**osphere is very good, I can't bear too many mosquitoes!

The price of the hotel is not cheap, even exceeding the price of some five-star hotels, but the overall facilities and services have not reached the level of five stars; the display of the room, TV equipment, etc., and the moldy bathroom are all unacceptable to me. Now that you have done it, you can actually do it to the extreme.
2. Some experience activities, such as fish fishing in rice fields (sewage ditch, I asked the waiter and said that there is no fish, and it is also such a dirty ditch). Farm picking (it‚Äôs a small place next to the restaurant, planted a few eggplants and peppers) road riding (it‚Äôs good to provide bicycles for free, but you can check the quality of the bike regularly, either the brakes are broken or the chain is off, and you can also prepare Some small cars are usually used for family trips, and they are not very friendly to those who are not tall enough), this series made the mood that I was looking forward to, but after I arrived, I learned about it and fell to the bottom.
3. I did not take the initiative to ask about the travel photography and Hanfu experience bound to the reservation. I went to the front hall several times, but no one was there, and I couldn‚Äôt ask
4. Because the location is in a village, it is very inconvenient to eat. If you stay for a few more days, it is not recommended. The restaurant in the hotel is really expensive. I ordered four dishes for about 800 yuan, and the price/performance ratio is very low. The key is the general taste! It is suggested that it can be more economical and affordable. Although it is on the mountain, the transportation is also very convenient, and there are farmlands, so the ingredients are not very scarce! I hope the boss can put people first and really make customers feel at home!
The above is my fair evaluation, there are good and bad, the environment is very good, Yoyo's service is also very good, and the handling and response are very thoughtful!

Thanks to the housekeeper, Xiaokai, for his careful arrangements these days. He really did what he needed. The planned forest travel route and the hand-painted map were very practical, because our high-speed train in the afternoon was relatively late and he applied for a late check-out.
The taste of the hotel restaurant also suits your appetite. Every dish I ordered in the past few days is delicious. Although it is Hunan cuisine, it is not particularly spicy and oily. Although there are not many types of breakfast, it is better than delicious. I recommend casserole noodles and beef. There is also a vegetable garden behind the restaurant that can be picked for the kitchen to cook.
The service and experience this time are full marks, and I will choose this place next time I bring my baby to play in Zhangjiajie.

The hotel is located outside the middle gate (Zimugang) of Zhangjiajie National Forest Park. It is a ten-minute walk to the scenic spot, with rice fields and bamboo forests on the roadside. The hotel is also very beautiful. The thousand-year-old catalpa tree is withered but still standing; the tea mountain in front of the restaurant overlooks the mountains and the clouds roll in; the butler service is also very good. The free in-hotel travel photography not only comes with aerial video, but also the staff The sunrise, sunset and sea of ‚Äã‚Äãclouds mentioned in the chat were also incorporated into the video [laughing]
I am very lucky to have met the housekeeper Lu Lu, a very warm-hearted and gentle girl. I sent you a WeChat message before checking in, received you at the door, and introduced you to the scenic spots. They were very considerate!

Zishan is a warm homestay, because time music comes to check in, but what you gain is not only the experience of Internet celebrities. First of all, the location is very convenient. The homestay is only 800 meters away from the middle gate of Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, which is very convenient for travel. The homestay arranges a homestay clothing experience, and arranges travel photographers to take pictures, so that the girls who love beauty can take enough pictures, and there is no need to squeeze the tourists in the scenic spot to take pictures. When going to the show at night, Lulu has always been concerned about the whole itinerary, and told him to pay attention to safety when driving at night. This is not just an accommodation, but also a warm place to relax and unwind. The beef for breakfast was so good, I'm already missing it. see you later.

It is true that excellent talents are always careless. All kinds of little details. Thanks to the housekeeper Lulu for his meticulous arrangements, thanks to the drone brother for helping us shoot blockbuster movies, thanks to the photographer for helping us take pictures, and thanks to all the service staff of the hotel for their service and convenience during our stay. The hotel facilities are also very good. The glass tree house is very popular among children. The view room on the distant mountain has a pleasant view. Archery, fishing, swimming pool, picking, book bar, restaurant, concert, ethnic costumes, etc. are all available in the public area. Thumbs up. Finally highly recommended again!

msg:The first stop of the baby in summer, the choice of accommodation is perfect.
The most important thing I care about every time I travel is accommodation, and this time it is the peak of summer vacation, so I am very cautious about the choice of accommodation in popular scenic spots. I am afraid that the weather will not be able to travel and I will be stuck in the room with nothing to do, and I am worried that there will be too many people. The service of the hotel is greatly reduced, but the four nights of the trip to Zhangjiajie were all arranged in Zishan Manju. It can be said that there is no regret in this trip.
First of all, let‚Äôs talk about the environment. It‚Äôs right next to the forest park. The location is superior. The hotel is built according to the terrain. Walking in it can be described as a scene every step of the way. In the Northeast dialect, why go to the forest park, this is the forest park, hahaha
The second thing is service. This year, I prefer to live in B&Bs. Apart from liking the original natural features of B&Bs, especially scenic B&Bs, and returning to the taste of the mountains, it is also because the services of B&Bs are becoming more and more refined. The service quality of high-end homestays can be said to be vividly displayed here in Zishan Manju, which can be regarded as a model in the industry: receive the housekeeper's long-term check-in reminders and precautions in advance and arrange the room according to the requirements; send a text message and bring Waiting in the parking lot with luggage in the rain; after check-in, take it into the room and ask again for check-in requirements to coordinate and solve it in a timely manner; during check-in, you can always appear at the time and place you need in time; think about everything before you and remind you in time; Wherever you sit down, there will be a cup of hot tea at your hand... The meticulous and considerate service makes my daughter feel like she is at home. According to my daughter, the service you get when you stay in a so-called seven-star hotel is no better than this (although I didn't ask, but I made a rough estimate, the number of service staff must exceed the number of rooms) ha Ha ha
The store manager‚Äôs shooting skills are top-notch. The Hanfu and ethnic costumes in the clothing experience hall in the store are quite beautiful and diverse. I really want to wear everything but can‚Äôt finish it...
There are also delicious meals, colorful experience activities, educational and interesting parent-child projects...
There are so many surprises that it is impossible to tell them all.
In short, it is the time when summer vacations are overcrowded, and I can get a satisfactory stay experience in Zishan Manju. I sincerely thank the housekeeper Youyou for his meticulous and thoughtful service, the store manager for his patient and serious travel photography experience, and thank you all Zishan people for their enthusiasm .
Next time we come to Zhangjiajie, this place will be the best choice for our family.

We will definitely come to Zishanman again next time. We stayed this time Three days is still not enough, next time you choose to come when there is snow! I wish Zishan Manju's business is booming and the source of customers is booming.

From waiting in the parking lot in the rain to caring about us from time to time during play, to always thinking about us when he is busy with other work, living here will really have " The "illusion" of coming to a relative's house to play"! I have stayed in so many high-end hotels. The hardware facilities are not bad, but the humanistic level is probably the best, most comfortable and sincere service I have experienced so far. I am pleasantly surprised that I would like to come here again because I stayed in this hotel!

msg:It is really the most sensible to choose Zishan Manju for a May Day outing.
The hotel is in Longwei Village, close to the Zimugang Gate (southeast gate) of the National Forest Park. Walk along the bicycle path to the entrance of the scenic spot for seven or eight minutes after leaving the hotel. It is very convenient, and there are few tourists. good. Even Master Didi said that we chose a good place, quiet amidst the noise, and the environment is beautiful.
Service: First of all, the housekeeper will call you one day before check-in to check-in information, and there will be a special car to pick you up at the airport, which saves time and effort. Our housekeeper Xiao Deng is very warm and thoughtful, and will carefully help plan the itinerary. When you go out to play, if you have any questions on WeChat, you will solve them in a timely manner.
Facilities: The room is very large, and there is a large balcony with a good view when you open the window. The bedding is clean, the hangers are sufficient, and the sanitation is also good, without any peculiar smell. But the socket is not enough, the ground plug is a bit loose, and the big Apple users can't use the USB socket, but Xiao Deng also sent the power ***** in time. The bathroom mirror light will automatically turn off after a while, and it will be fine after maintenance the next day.
In addition, if there is something that needs to be improved, it is hoped that there are more toilet paper towels in the bathroom, and water is easy to accumulate at the shower door, so you can lay a mat.
The food in the hotel is pretty good. There are many types of breakfast, including both Chinese and Western styles, and the taste is relatively popular. Hunan specialty rice noodles are recommended, with many toppings, a bowl full of energy in the morning.
If I have the opportunity to come to Zhangjiajie again in the future, I will definitely choose here!

From the time we got off the high-speed rail in Zhangjiajie to the time we entered the room, we didn't even move our hands. The whole process was full of service!
1‚É£Ô∏èThe hotel environment can be said to be the ceiling, listening to the singing of cicadas and birds in the mountains, smelling the fresh air, looking at the hotel's buildings, flowers and plants, and the scenery everywhere. Hygienic, I have tested it for mild cleanliness, and it is safe üëç
2‚É£Ô∏èService: Butler Xiao Deng pulls the butler group in advance and arranges the driver master (ps The driver master is a retired old squad leader who has the same mobile phone screen saver as me). All the itineraries are 360 degrees and there are no dead ends. Here we must praise and thank the hotel housekeeper Xiao Deng , Patiently introduce and serve us!
My husband and I slept late on the first day and didn‚Äôt wake up. Xiao Deng was afraid that we would be hungry, so he made breakfast for us and left it at the door. We went out and sent us out to plan our itinerary. I was hungry the next night, so Xiao Deng went to the supermarket to buy noodles and snacks for us. You must know that it was already 12 o'clock.
3‚É£Ô∏èFanwai, there are singers here every night, and there are free barbecues. We also met a group of friends who came here from Beijing like us.
In short, this is our first time to come to Zishan Manju. We plan to bring our parents to live here next time. After staying in the city for a long time, we will come to live here, because it is so comfortable!
Finally, I would like to sincerely thank the hotel housekeeper Xiao Deng and the service staff for providing us with a comfortable journey!

msg:After reviewing the ratings for accommodation in Zhangjiajie for two hours, I finally chose this homestay as the number one place. Reviewing the accommodation experience during the May Day holiday, I am very satisfied overall. I have already given Amway to many friends and colleagues around me. I write this review, hoping to be able to Let friends who are still hesitating in the evaluation area choose TA unswervingly: Zishan Manju

1. Geographic location:
The homestay is located at the southeast gate of Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, 8-10 minutes walk away, about 45 minutes drive from Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport, and about 40-50 minutes away from downtown Zhangjiajie (such as Zhangjiajie West High-speed Railway Station/Tianmen Mountain Scenic Area). It is extremely friendly to plan to enter Zhangjiajie Forest Park for more than four days. It is convenient to walk in and out from the friendly distance. At the same time, the southeast gate is much cleaner than the sign gate (east gate) and the south gate. Taking the May Day holiday as an example during the peak period of tourists, entering from the southeast gate has really realized the ideal scene of less queues for entering the gate and taking eco-cars.

2. Environment of accommodation experience:
I have stayed in many, many resort hotels and homestays, some near the mountains and some near the water/sea. I think the landscape planning of this homestay and the style of the distant mountains are very beautiful and impeccable. Many small designs are small and ingenious, so that the comfort and leisure are filled in the entire paradise-like vacation experience. Stargazing at night in the mountains is a must for me after I get a few days of sunny days! twinkle Twinkle Little Star! For city life, it is a rare luxury and beauty!

3. Service chapter of accommodation experience:
The super six-star butler service made me feel good about this high-end homestay! Of course, my evaluation in this dimension only comes from Yoyo, the beautiful butler who is in charge of my trip, and may not represent the overall average level of the housekeeper~
In addition to the professional support and suggestions for itinerary planning that are very reliable, what the butler Yoyo brings to us is sincerity and heart. After eating in the restaurant for the first time, I just casually told her that the food was too salty, but I didn‚Äôt expect that the saltiness of each subsequent meal was very palatable. Later, I learned that the hotel has a mechanism such as a log, and Yoyo made a special note. , Every time you order another meal in the restaurant, the chef will make relative adjus**ents. During the few days of staying in the B&B, I had a lot of troubles to go to the butler Yoyo's place, and the service results exceeded expectations every time. I am very fortunate to have the professional and caring company of Yoyo during the few days in the B&B!

4. Peripheral services of homestay experience
Those who stay in hotels or homestays for vacation and leisure are generally concerned about what to do except lie down and stay at home. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs all inclusive, but what I enjoyed included: ordering service at the restaurant for lunch and dinner, Qing Bar at night, archery in the bamboo forest, travel photography in the B&B... Overall, there were surprises, all of which were unexpected.

Overall, it is super five-star, although this homestay became popular when it was later learned that it recorded some Hunan Satellite TV program in 2019. But objectively speaking, it is far from enough to label Zishan Manju with only "Internet celebrity homestay"!

There are also many activities in the hotel. In fact, even if you don‚Äôt go to the scenic spot, staying in the hotel for two days will be a good enjoyment~ I will try it again in the future, and I look forward to seeing you again~

msg:I have never commented, but this time I can't help giving Zishan Manju a five-star praise. Zishan Manju is highly recommended both in terms of software and hardware.
First of all, in terms of hardware, the room is warm, clean and tidy, with a spacious area. The sofa is very clean without any stains. It is very soft and comfortable to lie on the sofa after climbing the mountain every day. The mattress and linen are also very comfortable, no less than a five-star hotel. In short, Zishan Manju is not at all like a homestay that has been open for five years, and it is very well maintained.
The restaurant at the homestay is also delicious. Every dish does not step on thunder. The housekeeper said that fresh ingredients grown by local villagers are delivered to the restaurant every day.
Secondly, from the software point of view, it is even more worthy of praise. As a senior hotel controller, I have stayed in countless five-star hotels and homestays at home and abroad. Zishan Manju's butler service is also one of the best. Every morning when I go out, I can see the housekeeper Xiaoxin, who will give our family sincere greetings, and then accompany us all the way to the breakfast room. After breakfast, I accompanied the children to build blocks, play puzzles, make plant specimens, and patiently taught the children how to archery in the bamboo forest. The baby had a great time playing, and he liked brother Xiaoxin so much that when we went to play in the forest park, the baby kept talking about going back to the hotel to find brother Xiaoxin to play.
When we play in the forest park every day, Xiaoxin will care about where we have been, and tell us the attractions and routes online in real time. We encountered all the problems and difficulties, such as too many people queuing up, going down the mountain too late, there were no eco-cars, and the staff were off work, etc. Xiaoxin has a way to help you solve them. Every night when we go back, Xiaoxin will wait for you at the door and accompany you back to the room. In short, the service of the housekeeper Xiaoxin is really impeccable, he always appears in front of you at the right time and place. No more, no less. Makes you feel very comfortable.
Finally, this time we are traveling to Zhangjiajie for our birthday. Thank you Zishan Manju for giving us a free room upgrade and giving us a big and sincere strawberry birthday cake! I will recommend Zishan Manju to all my relatives and friends!

msg:The butler service is very good, from booking a room, confirming the itinerary, asking whether to pick up the car, sending menus, ordering meals, breakfast reminders, weather reminders, luggage, and the whole process of caring babysitting services, all kinds of services are really invincible; This level of service is a bit beyond the standard for this room rate. I booked the most basic room type of 1500, because it was a free upgrade from Ctrip's "diamond level" hotel to a slightly larger room type, but it is not considered a view room, but I think it doesn't matter whether it has a view or not. Quiet, comfortable, is the most important thing.

The hotel bedding is great, but it seems that the basic room type does not have a TV, at least my room does not, but I don't watch TV either.

The hotel's Chinese restaurant is also very good. Hunan cuisine is delicious... I feel that there is no bad Hunan cuisine in Hunan.

The temperature of the hot water in the hotel was a bit low in my experience. I don't know why. I saw similar negative feedback in other reviews.

The only thing that is lacking is that the breakfast is a bit stretchy. There are almost no Western-style parts, and there is no freshly squeezed juice; up.

Generally speaking, it is very good. I stayed for 2 consecutive nights. Compared with the last stop at Tangshe in Yangshuo (2800 a night), I don‚Äôt know how many times better.

Manager Chen was very considerate for us and arranged the most suitable and comfortable room for us. Our housekeeper, Lulu, is very kind and kind. He really cares for us these days. Especially on rainy days, there will always be timely umbrellas at the door. The environment of Manju met all our expectations.

Near the entrance of Zhangjiajie Forest Park, the environment on the mountain is very good, and the air is fresh and pleasantüëç. The layout of the store is very careful, every corner is very carefully decorated, every corner can produce a pieceüëçüëç.
The tree house is like a fairytale hut hidden in Zhangjiajieüõñ, from far and near, there are beautiful blooms from different angles for you~

Service: The service is the part that has to be praised. Before check-in, I will contact and send the specific location in advance, arrange the parking space and the master who carries the luggage, and you don't have to worry about it from the gate.
Special praise to Butler Tang ‚ù§Ô∏è for being warm and thoughtful, polite and measured, good all-round service without invading privacy too much, everything is just right, very üâëÔ∏è. Helped us coordinate the fruit we wanted to eat when we came back at night, arranged the turndown service, and made a play guide. The omnipotent housekeeper took the trouble~üëç

Hygiene: After drinking in the tea room üçµ, the cups are all warm cups just taken out of the sterilization cabinet, so I feel at ease. Everything in the room smells fresh, there is no peculiar smell, and the hygiene is very thorough.

Facilities: The filming locations of famous variety shows are said to be hired by the city, and the variety shows arranged to be filmed here, the facilities are not terrible. I thought the tree house would be cold when it rained, but the underfloor heating and air-conditioning function is too powerful, so it became hotü§£

Exquisite afternoon tea: snacks and soup were prepared, we also made a cup of tea by ourselves, and looked at the scenery outside the window leisurely, it was really nice. During the period, I also saw a rare big hailstorm in Zhangjiajie, which is an extra gift from God~

The scenery along the way is very beautiful. Before arriving at the hotel, Mr. Deng, the housekeeper, contacted me in advance and was waiting for us at the gate. He was very enthusiastic.
The hotel staff are basically locals, and they are very enthusiastic. The food in the restaurant was also very good, both dinners were eaten at the hotel.

msg:After so many years of travelling, first of all, I have never commented. The bad ones are not worth it, and the good ones are not worth it. This hotel has given me countless surprises. First of all, I didn't expect to have such a beautiful homestay in Xiangxi. I directly dumped countless streets in Lijiang. Lijiang is too commercialized, and it is too urgent to make money. Unlike here, there is a kind of elegance and immortality in it. Because I left in a hurry, I didn't take many photos, so I took a few photos before I left and put them up. Full of praise as follows:

First of all, Yoyo: First of all, we must praise Yoyo, the most responsible and warm-hearted housekeeper I have ever met. She looks sweet and her service is even sweeter. She also made us special local tea very thoughtfully. It is said that it will not affect sleep , it seems to be, the taste is very unique and delicious.

Second, the room: I must praise the layout of the room, the big terrace is a big plus, there is floor heating, and there are large floor-to-ceiling glass folding doors. My room is facing the time music venue and restaurant, the green lawn and the small pond Don't have a flavor. Oh and that fireplace with firewood ready.

Thirdly, the service: the software service must be praised, people arrive before the menu, people are already waiting at the door when they arrive at the butler, the room is already brightly lit, the floor heating is turned on, the fruit is served, and the local tea is brewed. Point Basic Seconds* All five-star hotels

Fourth, the restaurant: Although there are not many dishes, the taste is very good, simple but not simple.

Fifth, the front desk and public areas: the details are reflected in every place, so I won't repeat them here, as shown in the picture above.

To sum up, it is definitely a place where I will come again, and I sincerely recommend all donkey friends to come here

In addition to pick-up and drop-off, ticket booking, environmental introduction and daily reminders, the housekeeper Yoyo also planned a very reasonable itinerary for us to play, and also gave us great solutions when there were unexpected situations in the weather and itinerary. The two-day itinerary in the off-season is not rainy or foggy. It is luck, but it is also inseparable from the high-quality experience provided by Zishan Manju. If there is a chance to visit Zhangjiajie next time, I will definitely choose here again.

At noon on the first day, the two of us ordered too much fried sausage and only ate a little. There was a lot of waste. The waiter offered to save it for us to heat up at night, which was a great service.
There is nothing to say about the environment, the design is very thoughtful, the upgraded room view is amazing, I will book this room type next time, it is really good.

The waiter treated my family (children) rudely, which made me feel uncomfortable. Even though the manager and housekeeper apologized, I met the bad waiter again after breakfast. , feeling very unhappy. Generally speaking, the environment is acceptable, the rooms are not as useful as ordinary five-star hotels, and the towels and bath towels are a bit damp. After checking out, we stayed at the Naberry Hotel. The price was more than 500, and the price here for the day was over 3,000. The rooms and breakfast at Naberry were much better than here, but the greenery outside the restaurant was still very comfortable. The quality of the waiters is better than that of a 5-star hotel, and in terms of housekeeping, this is obviously a super high-end hotel. The place is small but exquisite. Low cost performance. If you like quiet and don't have a lot of money, you can stay here. It's very nice. Most of the staff are nice. It is recommended to strengthen the education of waiters on kindness and patience in treating children, so as not to affect the reputation of the hotel.

It is not so much a service staff as an old friend who has not seen for a long time. They met all the requirements of my husband and I when we stayed at the hotel; a driver came to pick us up at Zhangjiajie West Station, and when we entered the scenic spot near the hotel, the "Lulu" came out very enthusiastically to take care of everything for us, and there was also a long-dried The old tree stands majestically in front of the hotel lobby, and there are cartoon characters of salamanders and mountains on the side of the road. I stayed in a tree house for one night and a room with a view for two nights. The tree house is beautiful. It‚Äôs a bit cold in this season. The view room is very large. When you open the floor-to-ceiling curtains, you can see the real scene that you can touch. There is a restaurant next to it. It's very close; the service staff in the restaurant are also polite and will not neglect the guests just because it is an internet celebrity hotel. You must try the beef brisket noodles in the restaurant. The beef brisket stewed is not greasy or smelly. Dry pot chicken, rock fungus kudzu root roll, eggplant stew, shredded radish in oil residue, stewed rock fungus chicken..." Personal tastes are different, so many things need to be tried by yourself to know which tastes better. The night before going up the mountain, Lulu will also help us to divide the route map for us to go up the mountain. We call it the "treasure map". According to the route she divided, we can basically play everything that should be played, and we don't have to be misled by the tourist guide in the scenic spot. , It also saves a lot of time for traveling in Zhangjiajie. My experience of staying in the hotel for three days is that I feel at home, a veritable top1 hotel in Zhangjiajie. Next time I bring my children, I will choose Manju. I heard that you can dig bamboo shoots in the back mountain. I will try it next time~

msg:I lived in a tree house and Manju Guanshan respectively. If you are not obsessed with the Internet celebrity glass tree house, I would recommend Manju Guanshan: a larger house area and a better view outside the window. Compared with the tree house, the only small disadvantage is privacy. If there are parent-child families next to it, there will be noise. The interior area of the tree house is a bit small, and it is not very convenient to move around, but it is very quiet. The hotel's breakfast and daily meals are higher than the local level, and it is very comfortable to eat. Special thanks to the housekeeper Lulu and the sales Xiaochen for their careful care. I spent two very happy nights, which are great memories.

As soon as I made the reservation, the housekeeper Lulu contacted me in a very timely manner, and gave me a thoughtful reminder on the check-in requirements and the matters to be paid attention to when visiting the scenic spot. After arriving, he accompanied us throughout the process to help us with luggage, check-in, and introduce hotel facilities and services. Very caring . The hotel's catering and hygiene are also very good. It is also very close to the entrance of Zhangjiajie Scenic Spot and the nucleic acid testing point. It is worth recommending~

The best thing is the butler service of the hotel. Our butler, Xiao Tang, is so caring and makes people feel at home. He will help us arrange a pick-up when we go there. Help us arrange the scenic tour route, you don't have to do your own strategy, and the others are also responsive, we can't think of Xiao Tang will take the initiative to remind us ~ this hotel is just a blind rush!

In the middle of the mountain, the area is very large, but the distance between the rooms, the lobby and the restaurant is more suitable. There is a large bamboo forest behind the hotel, and there is a thousand-year-old tree in the middle.
The service is also very comfortable, just right and thoughtful, and the housekeeper Xiao Tang confirmed the itinerary planning in advance and so on. When I take a taxi back from the hotel at night, I will watch the surveillance to open the door in advance, and the details are not bad. There is also a little brother who forgot to leave his name and took a picture.
All in all, although the price is not cheap, it is definitely worth it

He added WeChat to contact the check-in matters one day in advance, and also planned the scenic spot for us when we arrived. The hotel environment is quite beautiful, and the room can be maintained. Although the sparrow is small, it has all the internal organs. I have lived in a few similar scenic spot B&Bs, and I feel that there are a little less entertainment activities. With such a beautiful scenery, you can add some activities such as morning yoga, picnic, and folk parent-child experience. Will come back to see if there is a chance.

I especially like to decorate the lobby with ethnic characteristics and the thousand-year-old catalpa tree in front of the door. Back in the hustle and bustle of the metropolis, the sound of the wind that I heard reading books on the balcony of Manju was still echoing in my ears.

As a small suggestion, you can install screen windows on the balcony of the room, so that you can fall asleep listening to the sound of cicadas.

The scorching sun was waiting, and I stayed for three nights. From the hotel sales manager Chen to the exclusive butler, Lulu served us in every detail, and also helped us plan the tour route of Wulingyuan National Forest Park and Tianmen Mountain. I would also like to thank you very much. Manager Xiao Chen, on the day we checked out, we decided to go to the ancient city of Phoenix to stay for one night, but the hotel rooms we were looking forward to were sold out. Manager Xiao Chen actively helped us contact friends he knew during the meeting to help us coordinate a suite. The key is the price. gave a discount

The housekeeper, Lulu, is attentive and responsible, and responds to every request. She took the initiative to provide us with sunscreen products, patiently explained the travel route, and reminded us to eat in time... While enjoying the high standard of service, we also felt the sincerity of Zishan Manju. Sales Xiao Chen also provided us with all the convenience and took us to the gate of the scenic spot. He also patiently explained the past and present of the hotel and various tidbits that happened here. His humorous language often made everyone laugh.

Come and experience Zishan Manju, while all this beauty is still alive!

msg:Before the trip, I read the list of Zhangjiajie hotels, and the first place to score is Zishan Manju. After reading the comments, I am very excited. So decided to start. The housekeeper Xiao Deng set up a WeChat group two days before our arrival, reminding us to prepare nucleic acid. One transfer service is included in the room rate. Xiao Deng arranged the pick-up station in advance, and the driver called five minutes before our high-speed train arrived and told us where to pick it up. The partner who was traveling with her suffered a sprained foot. Xiao Deng arranged for the driver to pick her up alone and accompany her to the hospital. The hotel learned about this situation, and it also distributed fresh herbs to my friends every day for wet compress, and the effect was very good.

The location of the hotel is surrounded by mountains, and it is close to an entrance of Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, which can be reached on foot. The entrance of this gate is the nucleic acid testing point, which is very convenient.

The menu of Zishan Manju Restaurant can close your eyes, every one is deliciousüòã. The Tujia Sanxia pot is amazing, bacon + bacon ribs + bacon pig feet, with winter melon, super rice. Crispy bamboo shoots in chicken sauce, the crispy and tender bamboo shoots absorb the umami of the chicken soup. Rock ear stewed chicken, Xiangxi Valley duck, rock ear kudzu roll, rock ear scrambled eggs, shredded radish with oil residue, beef brisket noodles for breakfast, each dish is unforgettable.

On the second day of my stay, it was sunny after the rain, and the dinner was not over yet. The guests of the restaurant got up one after another and went outside to take pictures. So there is a random shot of the first picture. The small village in Wulingyuan is located at the foot of the mountain, shrouded in clouds and mist. You can see that the land is flat and the houses are like fertile fields, beautiful ponds, and mulberry bamboos. Qian Mo traffic, chickens and dogs hear each other. This is not Tao Yuanming's Peach Blossom Spring.

Last but not the least, focusing on commending the service of Zishan Manju, which can be regarded as the top ceiling of China's homestay industry. Our housekeeper Xiao Deng, the young man is simple and honest, lovely, thoughtful and considerate. The three children in our group all liked him. When we left, the children waved goodbye to Brother Deng reluctantly, and repeatedly stressed that Brother Deng must come to Beijing to play with us.

Three nights of living in Zishan, beautiful pastoral scenery of Wulingyuan, well-cooked meals, flowers and crops in the small garden next to the restaurant, midsummer night concert by Mr. Frog and Miss Xia Chan under the stars, by the pool? The laughter and laughter of children in the rice field are unforgettable. Zishan Manju, it is worth coming again!

When I originally booked the hotel, I also read the reviews and booked it with the mentality of giving it a try. I didn't expect the environment and service of the whole hotel to exceed my expectations. The housekeeper Lulu and Mr. Chen have been helping me in various ways, so that I don't feel unfamiliar at all in an unfamiliar environment. It's like being warm and thoughtful at the house of a long-lost old friend. They will take the children to play when I am tired and help me adjust my mood and actively solve problems when I have problems. To say this is providing a service is more like taking care of friends. So I will definitely be here again. I have stayed in many hotels, and basically I have stayed in the top hotels in the local area. I have experienced various services. There are really not many people like Zishan Manju who have perfected the details and services. So highly recommended. If you want to travel to Zhangjiajie and want to seriously appreciate the beautiful scenery and taste life, you must try it.

Since the hotel was booked at noon, the butler Xiao Liu said that the afternoon tea could not be provided, without any apology, and directly said that because you stayed for two days, I would give you two servings tomorrow, two servings a day? Later, someone said that it would be converted into 168 yuan, huh, what I want is 168 yuan? At the final checkout, the 168 was not deducted, and Ctrip directly forcibly deducted the money. At that time, the butler asked me, what time do I need afternoon tea? I say 2 o'clock. She said no at 2 o'clock, she has something to do. Then I said it would be at 2:30, and she said yes, but it was delivered at 3:15, and I urged it. The day before I left the store, I informed the next day at 7:30 to help me carry my luggage. The luggage was on the mountain, which was very inconvenient. The housekeeper group also said that there was no problem. I called the housekeeper at 7:20 the next morning to say that I was ready , What did you say you are leaving? No one is working now. I **** 10,000 ***. Just because a star has been here, can you be so proud? I generally don't comment, this is the first bad review in several years. Still chasing me to give 5 stars, 5 stars, have you done it? This is the case with all my bookings on Ctrip. At the beginning, they fooled me into ordering offline, saying that the meal coupons were delivered. If I ordered offline, I was afraid I would be in trouble.

We didn't dare to take a shower for 2 days. 2. Hotel catering: The breakfast variety is very small and very unpalatable. There is no air conditioning in the breakfast place. It gets cold before eating. Because the hotel is on the mountain, lunch and dinner can only be eaten in the hotel. The food is the price of a five-star hotel, but the taste is really not good. 3. The internal facilities of the house are simple. I washed the kettle twice and still poured out the tea leaves left in the kettle by the last guest (I don't know if it is tea leaves).

üöó Transportation: The pick-up service was booked at the hotel. A 9-seater car took us and a group of 8 people~ It takes about 30-40 minutes from Zhangjiajie West High-speed Railway Station to the hotel, a short section of Panshan Road, which is very convenient!

üßπHygienic: It should be regarded as one of the best sanitary conditions in Dafulan B&B, and it can catch up with the standards of four-star hotels or above~ The sanitary problems that usually worry about the style of a B&B are totally absent here!

üçÉEnvironment: It can be seen that it is a very careful design! Reconstructed from the abandoned forest farm in the village, the Tujia brick-wood style small building with chimney fireplace perfectly blends with the surrounding environment ~ street lights in the reeds, stone slabs leading to the bamboo forest. . . There are small details everywhere~ the design of the room is also good, lying on the bed and opening the curtains is the forest, with floor heating and air conditioning, the toilet is also smart, plus a real fireplace, it is too comfortable in winter! The hotel‚Äôs meals are also good, and it‚Äôs very comfortable not to go anywhere in the hotel~


üîîService: The best thing is the service. The quiet butler is beautiful and enthusiastic, thoughtful and meticulous, which is the biggest surprise of our trip!

Zishan Manju is located on the mountain near the gate of Zimugang Forest Park. If the traffic is a little inconvenient, it would be good if you drive by yourself. The homestay is very quiet and private, and the greenery is also very good. The butler, Xiao Liu, is very caring and will prepare hot tea when he returns late. We are also a leisure trip. It‚Äôs okay to live here to visit several core attractions in the Forest Park in one day~

When the order was booked successfully, the phone immediately called to confirm the itinerary, and the housekeeper immediately pulled a group. , Arrange the pick-up service... This series of operations gave me a good expectation for this vacation. After the 3rd arrived, I saw the unique landscape design of the inhabited residence, which is simple, comfortable, elegant and peaceful. Aesthetic feeling, as if encouraging people to boldly pursue all kind and beautiful things...the service box of the small back basket, the uniform national costume, the transplantation of reeds...all are conveying their most beautiful possibilities of shaping the hotel.

Special thanks to the butler Xiao Tang. Not only is he handsome, but he is also very considerate. In my heart, the pick-up and drop-off has always been carried on and off.

If you have to make suggestions:
One is to strengthen the gym
The second is the details of the room. For example, the shower and bathtub must be placed separately, and now there is only one mat. Add a shelf on the bathtub, etc.

msg:The hotel is 500 meters from the forest park, like the outside of the park, quiet and very emotional! The room is large, the bedding is comfortable, the design is modern, and the food in the restaurant is very delicious! Great place to rest and relax after returning from a visit to the forest park! Xiao Tang housekeeper was responsible for our one-on-one service, very warm and attentive! The coordination arrangement of selling Mr.Chen Jinxuan was also very thoughtful! All in all, the 3 days here was very comfortable and happy for 3 days!

msg:Hotel accommodation is an important part of travel, is the necessary condition to enjoy a holiday! So evaluate it, after staying in Lushan, Zhangjiajie does not want to go anywhere! The scenery is too beautiful, and the butler Xiaolian intimate service! Relax and relax in the place! The first day of stay, even if it rains, is beautiful. We relied on the next day to enter Wulingyuan in the afternoon. The hotel is also located at the southeast gate. The park was just in time to avoid the crowd. I was originally prepared to take a tour guide, but the butler Xiaolian has made a strategy for us, a very easy route. The room was spacious, clean and refreshing. A place where adults and children are reluctant to leave, in short, highly recommended.

The service is also in place, and the housekeeper Xiao Deng is great. He also prepared small gifts for the children on Children's Day. It is recommended that the hotel install a TV, but there is no TV hahahaha ü§£

msg:If you go to Wulingyuan, staying at Zishan Manju is a very good choice. It is very close to the Zimu Gang Middle Gate of the National Forest Park. There are not many tourists using this gate, so it is quick to enter the park. The hotel can also arrange car transfers. Special thanks to my housekeeper Miaomiao, who is simple and enthusiastic. They carefully arranged and answered all my questions about my trip to Wulingyuan throughout the whole process, which was very considerate. Thanks!
