msg:After being exhausted by work, I took a spontaneous trip before the hot weather and the peak period of May Day. I heard a familiar yet unfamiliar city in my dream - Lianyungang. So I booked a ticket and set off immediately.
I stayed in Liandao for a few days. Although the scenery was beautiful, the accommodation conditions were still average. I was a little worried about the level of tourism infrastructure in Lianyungang. Before leaving, I chose to stay in Huajianling for one night to make up for all the small regrets of my travel in Lianyungang.
The staff contacted me in advance, asked about the check-in time, and asked the staff to pick me up from the mountain. The service attitude was excellent, thoughtful and gentle. Check-in was fast, the courtyard was beautiful, and the room was beautiful and comfortable. Although I just wanted to lie down after running all the way, I couldn't help but go out and take hundreds of photos at different times.
It was inconvenient to go down the mountain at night. The housekeeper would ask in advance whether to eat, and he could take me with him when picking up employees from the mountain. However, because it was in the scenic area, the ticket to enter the mountain again had to be paid by myself. After the housekeeper explained, I thought it was reasonable.
In the evening, I had nothing to do, so I played chess in the hall by myself. The housekeeper took the initiative to pour tea for me and came to help me replenish water from time to time, which was very considerate. When I went down to the end game and was about to go back to the room, the tiger-*****ed "little boss" in the park suddenly appeared. He was not afraid of people at all. He was very tactful and lay quietly on the sofa to accompany me and let me take pictures.
The exquisite breakfast on the second day was also very delicious. After the meal, I also experienced making tea, making incense and making dried flower silk fans. The housekeeper has always been very patient and provided timely instructions and help. Finally, he helped me print a few photos taken this time and framed one of them.
There are some small regrets, such as the infinity pool was not turned on due to maintenance, and the TV was difficult to turn on (I was lazy and didn't ask the housekeeper to help), but they are all small problems. The wonderful experiences mentioned above are also very profound, and there are many other details that have not been expanded.
In short, it is highly recommended, especially for those who like to climb mountains or just want to lie down and rest like me.

The food is generally good, and there is a business car to pick up the car in the parking lot.
The air duct design of the restaurant door can be optimized, and there is always a humming sound.
Overall, I want to come again.

msg:Honestly speaking, I am a detail ****** in the hotel industry.
1. I was worried about the inconvenience of sleeping with my baby at first, but I didn't expect that the room had a fully enclosed tatami mat and a large bed with a window.
2. The executive treatment was also very good, with fresh and rich fruit snacks.
3. The room was equipped with countless bottles of mineral water, which was highly praised, and there was also juice, no hidden costs.
4. The last meal was booked in the hotel, and there was no soup left for the wild mushroom hot pot.
5. There was also a girlfriend's phone, and I watched a movie in the middle of the night, which was so cool.
I took pictures to keep a record, and I will follow this when I decorate my house in the future! It was worth the trip!!

msg:The hotel is located in the Huaguoshan Scenic Area. You can confirm the arrival time with the hotel butler before you arrive. The butler will send a car to the entrance of the scenic area to pick you up. The service is very good and friendly. The room I booked is a mountain view room with a large panoramic glass, which allows you to have a panoramic view of the scenery in front of you. There is a tea garden at the foot of the mountain. When I checked in in the afternoon, I saw many tea-picking girls. After checking in, I walked around the scenic area. On the way to the Water Curtain Cave, I saw groups of monkeys, which were similar to the Monkey Island in Hainan. There were so many of them. It is said that the monkeys in Huaguoshan are vegetarians, so don't feed them ham sausages or something, they will be angry. I took some beautiful photos of the hotel and share them with you.

msg:Location: Halfway up Huaguo Mountain, at the South Tianmen Gate. We traveled first, going down from Jade Girl Peak. We told the master about the hotel and he would stop at Nantianmen. Later, the hotel sent a car to accompany us to the parking lot to pick up our luggage from the car.
Environment: Visible in the picture. Although it is a pity that it is winter and we cannot see the swimming pool or the green all over the sky, we can still feel the overall beauty. The hotel itself is very new and clean.
Service: This is really worthy of praise, kind attitude, smiling faces, and detailed explanation. (We checked in at 2 pm on 24.2.17. There was a boy at the front desk who was really nice. I regret that I don’t know his name.) From the initial contact, to the service at the front desk, to the pick-up service, to afternoon tea and dinner, every step , every point is very satisfying. Fruits at check-in, various snacks in the refrigerator, dinner arrangements and delicious food (and the price is very reasonable), very delicious hawthorn wine (it was so delicious that I asked for another bottle). Also, they took the initiative to provide toothbrushes and quilts for the children. Seeing that the children's feet were relatively large, they replaced the original children's slippers with adult slippers.
Food taste: I ordered a set menu. The chef looked at our two families and changed some repeat dishes. Thank you very much.
Very, very recommended to stay! However, there are only seven rooms, so you need to book in advance.

msg:A very beautiful hotel with a beautiful scenery, just inside the Huaguoshan Scenic Area. The store will contact you in advance to arrange pick-up and drop-off. The architectural style is very unique. It "grows" on the mountainside. There are lively and bright goldfish at the door. The various room types and considerate services are simply my favorite place to "lay down". You can... We played percussion drums in the hall (I was simply addicted to it), experienced various aromatherapy, looked at the small library, and followed immersed meditation. The room environment is very hygienic and the facilities are new. There is a heated open-air glass swimming pool below the hall, which is very comfortable. Lying in the glass swimming pool and watching the sunset, accompanied by the refreshing mountain air, is super wonderful. The customer service guys and ladies are very nice~ I asked them all kinds of questions, including how to get around and play in the scenic spot. They would help me think of the route from the perspective of the guests, and provide a map of the Huaguo Mountain scenery, so I can go out for a walk. You can find the tour bus stop just a little way down the road, which is great. The breakfast provided will be asked in advance to taste, it is delicious and comfortable. I really recommend this place~

msg:房間特別棒，有種住在仙境的感覺，孩子大人都很滿意！猶豫入住時間有點晚，送人的專車師傅下班了東西拉車上了，保安張大哥專門騎摩託車送到停車場取的東西！特別熱情❤️前台的女孩子特別好，特意問了一下，姑娘姓楊，太周到了！退房的時候，酒店經理剛好在，專門給我們送下山，後來發現充電器沒拿，小夥子又跑了一趟給送下來了，特別棒的入住體驗！強烈推薦

特別是酒店的服務，長者特別滿意，專門讓給好評。
酒店特色活動很多，團扇製作長者很喜歡。
早餐很好，一人一份。
午餐和晚餐的套餐味道也不錯。建議以後增加些選擇。
服務方面，男經理帶我們體驗了點茶、香篆等特色項目，很有意義。前台小楊幫忙搬行李，很温暖。
以後還會去
不足的地方就是房間看不到山景，窗户外面就是石牆。

房間也很不錯，到的時候已是下午，落日的餘暉鋪滿了整個房間的金光，彷彿伸手就可以握住;
夜間的酒店燈火通明，福字的燈籠紅火美麗，在山間的黑夜裡更顯得温馨温婉;
清晨的日出也沒有吝嗇它的熱情，很早就灑在了庭院的每一個角落。遠眺山間，一覽羣山萬壑，瑰麗美景映人間;舉杯品茗，淺嘗閑花百味，賞風沐晴遊青山。
山上猴子成羣，爭相嬉鬧，遊客餵食歡聲笑語。路上偶遇白貓，山民自養，慵懶可愛。
一半清風一半日光，一半吵鬧一半靜謐，慢品人間，閑觀歲月，不虛此行。

12月初住一晚，分享體會
這不是商業酒店而是一家民宿
位於花果山景區半山腰的風景南天門處
有，且衹有7個客房
主打一個人性化服務和高檔型消費，經理小袁温文爾雅，見面就奉上王德傳的紅茶，出門就給送上裝着兩瓶水的袋子，幫助客人照照片，還打印出來，感覺他總是在琢磨怎麼能更好的為客人服務，總希望再為客人提供些服務。
住：房間設施齊全軟服務到位，送了水果小吃和各類茶葉，浴缸大而豪華熱水充足，床被枕頭都很舒服。冬天去的時候，一定要提醒店家在客人來之前提前開地暖！不然是真的冷。還有房間外的取暖爐有聲音，睡眠有要求的要提前瞭解一下能否接受。
吃：價格不便宜，可選擇餘地不大，因為人流不大，感覺正餐基本上衹能選擇酒店提供的269、299這一類的套餐，可以單點菜，量很大。倆人點了299，因為肉多就又加了一份青菜，廚師手藝還行！早餐按份，一大桌，很豐富，肉蛋奶麪粥主食都非常豐富，就是青菜少一點。
行：進酒店需提前聯繫酒店派車到景區停車場接，衹管來了接一次走的時候送一次。酒店出來就是花果山景區遊覽車南天門站點，到玉女峯25元，不是買了票就能上車，需要服務員跟山下聯繫留座位，等個十幾二十分鐘，非常方便。早晨起來坐上景區車到玉皇宮，可以看到一大羣猴，真的特別有意思。從水簾洞走回來時間不太長也不太短，很適合漫步。
看：酒店的位置得天獨厚，設計的也很巧妙，本身也是一個景點
