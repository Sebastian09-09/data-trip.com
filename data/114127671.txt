We also brought two dogs with us, and the small courtyard of the B&B allows them to run freely. The brothers and sisters in the B&B are also very nice. As soon as we arrived, they introduced the route to climb Huangshan Mountain. There are drivers to pick us up and down the mountain. Five-star recommendation~

The housekeeper group helped a lot. I booked the tickets for Huangshan Mountain. Otherwise, this trip would be a pity. It was 10 o'clock in the evening when I arrived at the homestay. The housekeeper helped me carry the luggage and arranged the climb of Huangshan Mountain the next day. It was very thoughtful. In short, it was a very pleasant trip. The location of the homestay is very good, very close to the scenic area transfer center. There are many restaurants and entertainment around. The main thing is that you can bring your pet.

Secondly, the room faces the swimming pool. If you come in summer and the swimming pool is open, I definitely recommend staying in a pool room. Open the door, wear a swimsuit, and jump directly into the swimming pool. It should be very comfortable
The location of the hotel is also good, close to the transfer center
The restaurant recommended by the young man is also delicious
A homestay worth recommending!

I was upgraded to a room type for free. The room is equipped with smart curtains and smart toilets, which are very advanced. Even disposable bathtub covers are thoughtfully prepared. The sound insulation effect is also good, the parking lot is also very large, and the sound insulation is also good. You can hardly hear it when the windows are closed. Free pick-up and drop-off service to Huangshan Transfer Center is also provided. I was late for the flight at night and couldn't get back to the hotel to pick up my luggage. They also delivered the luggage to the door of the transfer center and asked the master to pick us up directly. That's why I caught the plane. The service of this hotel is really in place, and it's worth investing in it!

It was cozy and comfortable to cook tea by the stove. After a day of sightseeing, the housekeeper helped us order meals. I didn’t expect that Anhui cuisine was so delicious. The breakfast was also very rich, including fried spring rolls and hand-rolled ones. Noodles, egg fried rice, egg pancakes, sesame balls, and various side dishes. My favorite is the fried shredded green pepper and pork. Tea by the fire (afternoon tea): special health tea, delicious snacks, and night conversations around the fire are very relaxing. My old father said that next time he comes to escape the summer heat, he will not go hiking with us and just drink tea and relax here. Facilities: The bedding is comfortable and the large bathtub makes everyone happy and relieves fatigue. Hygiene: Very clean, and all sanitary corners are clean. Environment: There is a yard, a mountain behind, and a garden terrace. Service: The handsome butler served us very patiently. He helped us with strategies and picked us up from the car, which made this trip perfect.

We also played table tennis, billiards, and made tea by the stove. The cat shop manager was also very kind, and a group of people gathered around to take pictures haha
The swimming pool is the specialty of his home. It is big and picturesque. The butlers at the B&B are all born after 1900 and helped us take a lot of photos. They also answered all our questions and helped us make strategies. I have to sigh. The service is so attentive. When I posted it on Moments, people thought I had gone to Sanya.

msg:連住了兩個晚上
設施：我對酒店細節還是比較關注的
1，首先房間排氣扇空調等幾乎靜音；
2，大浴缸很有必要，下山泡澡可以放鬆肌肉，緩解一天的疲勞
3，馬桶座圈是加熱的，很提升幸福感
衞生：極其乾淨！
環境：樓下就是咖啡廳，連喝了三天的咖啡，顏值好高，看了一圈，應該是鎮上最好的咖啡店了
服務：管家是可可愛愛的小姐姐小哥哥，相處起來如沐春風，聽説都是大學畢業，素質很高，很有邊界感！另外，他家的貓最搞笑了😆，我們上二樓，一回頭他也在爬樓，笑不活了

到民宿還幫我們拎行李到房間，大包小包自己實在是拎不動啊！
上山是商務車送我們到換乘中心，因為來的時候剛好下雪，早上温度很低，司機師傅還提前給車上開了空調，貼心度拉滿了！前台小姐姐推薦的民宿門口餐廳好像叫小廚王，做菜好吃且價格合理，推薦的高一點燒餅，香酥可口，好吃不貴。可見這家民宿真的是很用心在做的，五星好評！
黃山雪景絕美！遊玩體驗超棒！

房間窗户、陽台每個地方拍照都很好看的，欣賞周邊風景，後面的山景真的好漂亮。
管家小姐姐真的太棒了，給我們推薦了好幾個玩的地方，都是她們自己去過的、有照片，像盧村，塔川就不適合這個季節，去了也啥都沒有，能結合我們的實際需求來為我們指定旅遊規劃，我們沒有踩雷，旅行圓滿了！
住的很舒服，人很放空，有機會還會來的。

設施：設施齊全，徽派風格房屋、院落盡顯雅緻。
衞生：乾淨整潔，每日消毒，一塵不染。
環境：環境優雅、依山傍水、空氣清新，蟬鳴鳥叫好不愜意，在民宿裏都不想去爬山了，就在這裏小憩，下午茶也很美味健康，小朋友特別喜歡。
服務：超級到位，因為房間少，衹有店長和兩個管家還有衞生阿姨，但服務沒得説，隨叫隨到那種，每個人都親切熱情，隨時恭候您回家。
民宿店長還為我們安排了專車，都是商務車，非常舒適，價格公開透明不收回扣，都是直接付給師傅的，確實比自己打車划算很多。
強烈推薦！

民宿背靠山林，景色很不錯～
而且民宿還帶一個超大泳池，這點我比較滿意，要不是季節不合適，多少會下去遊幾圈！
環境清幽，休閑度假的好地方，下次還會再來！

msg:體驗很差

1. **地板問題**：房間的地板在走動時發出刺耳的咯噠聲，這不僅幹擾了我的休息，也讓我對房間的維護狀況感到失望。

2. **空調噪聲**：空調的排風聲音異常響亮，幾乎整夜都在製造噪音，嚴重影響了我的睡眠質量。

3. **語音控制系統**：房間的語音控制系統不僅反應遲鈍，還會在深夜突然激活，提出詢問，這不僅令人困擾，更讓人感到驚嚇。

4. **衞生間衞生**：衞生間的清潔狀況令人不滿，這讓我對酒店的衞生標準產生了質疑。

5. **投影儀問題**：投影儀的使用體驗非常差，而且需要付費才能享受投屏服務，這在其他酒店中是難以想象的。

6. **充電不便**：床頭的充電設施設計不合理，夜間充電極為不便。

7. **早餐質量**：早餐的質量令人失望，玉米過硬，香蕉切開後放置時間過長，導致顏色變黑，這顯然影響了食物的口感和新鮮度。

總的來説，這次住宿體驗讓我感到極度失望。我原本期待的是一次放鬆的旅行，但酒店的服務質量讓我的期待落空。我希望我的這次評價能夠引起酒店方面的注意，並採取措施改善，以避免其他客人有類似的遭遇

老闆很漂亮，她的貓也很漂亮，在大廳準備了很多口味的餅乾，一上來就一邊招呼人幫我們把行李送到房間，哈哈！特別提醒一下：早餐是自助餐！（一般民宿衹提供份餐）ps:一定要上一碗麪條，比外面賣的還好吃！
之所以願意花時間好評的重中之重原因是感受到的服務，就像是你到了老朋友的家，就怕怠慢了你！知道我們到了鎮上馬上聯繫我們來接我們，幫我們搬行李，離店的時候又送行李到我們去坐車的地方，湯口鎮裏很多酒店離下車點比較遠，我看到很多人自己拖着行李箱揹着大包小包的去酒店，真心建議那些不接送行李的住的地方多學習學習。
最後特別鳴謝民宿做接待工作的那位小哥，那麼多行李辛苦你了！

進入房間後，我被它的寬敞感深深吸引。兩張大床足夠容納一家人入住，床鋪非常舒適，讓我們一夜好眠。此外，旁邊還有一個餐廳，提供美味的徽菜菜餚，味道很不錯，而且價格適中，為我們的住宿體驗增色不少。
而且，當我們因為玩得太開心回來晚了，擔心孩子沒有飯吃時，司機師傅還特別熱情地幫我們聯繫了餐廳，詢問是否可以加餐。這種關心和貼心的服務讓我感到非常感動。
總之，這次的出行，最大的驚喜莫過於這家民宿。孩子們特別喜歡房間裏的投影設備，讓他們度過了愉快的時光。我希望這家民宿能夠繼續保持這種卓越的品質，因為下次來黃山，這裏肯定是我們的首選！感謝他們給我們帶來了如此美好的住宿體驗

民宿的床品和用具品質都很好，這明顯顯示出店家對品質的極致追求，這種用心令我印象深刻。

民宿門前的草坪更是一大亮點，不僅可以供客人露營，還可以攜帶寵物入住，這真的非常友好。如果民宿內開設一個咖啡廳，對愛喝咖啡的上海人來説那簡直就是完美，這麼有格調的地方，一杯美味的咖啡讓我體驗更上一層樓。

總的來説，這家民宿位於黃山山腳附近，是我見過的最好的選擇。我強烈推薦給所有尋找獨特住宿體驗的人，因為這裏絕對不會讓你失望！

msg:這些民宿就在黃山換乘中心旁邊，挺近的，所以一大清早五點多鐘出發去坐換乘巴士還是很方便的。房間裏面非常乾淨整潔，設施也比較新，我們訂的套間，兩大一小睡一個好覺，方便第2天爬山，養精蓄鋭，店裡美女也很好，五點多鐘就幫我們煮麪條了，竹筍麪非常的好吃，手藝非常好。我們有個小狗沒法帶出上山，店裡也能妥善安置並且延遲退房，解決了我們的大問題，總之是一家挺不錯的民宿酒店，前台的小帥哥還幫我們遛狗呢，是特別好的小夥子。感覺還是很不錯的，出發前還幫我們加了保温杯茶水。

msg:民宿的服務讓我們體會到了黃山的熱情和歡迎八方來客的心情，住了三晚，感覺還沒住夠呢！奈何我們要踏上下一段征程，依依不捨的與一曲相思，與黃山道別！
民宿的服務是讓我們印象最深的，從預訂的小插曲到入住後的聲聲問候，有問必答，有難必幫，都讓我們體會到了温暖！
民宿的設施也是細節處見用心，一次性用品也不敷衍客户，一個木質的小梳子就讓我們體會到了民宿對客户的細微用心！
民宿的小童區是真的不錯，孩子下山還有精力去玩（反正我是沒有精力了，衹想早點上床睡覺😴），民宿還有一個公共讀書角，既有小童讀物，也有適合大人打發閑暇時光的書本，民宿在做好環境設施的時候，也沒忘了我們的精神世界，感覺她們的服務理念真的覆蓋方方面面了。
民宿的位置就在南大門附近，也離街上不遠，到哪裡都方便，早上去買了些管家推薦的黃山燒餅，確實味道不錯！
還有很多沒説到的地方，總之祝民宿生意興隆，越來越棒！

msg:酒店位置交通非常便利，距離高速出口1公里，距離黃山寨西換乘中心直線距離700米、步行可到，早上登山坐景區大巴上山非常方便。周邊超市購物、吃飯什麼的也都很方便，挨着酒店的徽菜是點評必吃榜商家，馬路對面的徐媽媽也是舌尖商家。
環境整體還是蠻好的，23年新開酒店，設施都比較新，全屋智能、百度語音控制，房間有浴缸可以泡澡，洗浴也有配潤體乳，居住體驗不錯~其他配套的游泳池、鞦韆椅、庭院投影、乒乓球、桌球都有，甚至還有按摩房！
老闆和老闆娘是會生活的，服務很貼心，大堂也是咖啡廳、可以手作咖啡，入住有安排下午茶（手法檸檬茶+雪媚娘），爬山準備了小零食、還提供免費的登山杖，回酒店想找推拿按摩也直接安排到位，全程舒心。
跨年還專門安排了活動，篝火聚會、户外影院、圍爐煮茶、一堆的煙花、還幫忙煮了紅酒🍷，開開心心跨年，算是過了温暖舒心的跨年夜，感謝老闆~
非常推薦入住，下次來不爬山也會入住~
