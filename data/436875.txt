As many mentioned, poor hotel breakfast

Great housekeeping, housekeeping staff is warm and nice!

Reception is of varying quality depending on the who.

Zha Xi Deng Ba was awesome help! We are so thankful to him, both when checking in and checking out.

One particular night, we had to collect things from the reception. The lady on duty actually wondered out loud how she was supposed to know where our package was, since the one who received it was in the day shift. I would expect the hotel to have a system. Anyway, after a long search, we finally located our package. I would expect better accountability from the hotel.

1. It’s so beautiful, it totally fulfills my fantasy of staying in a historical building in an ancient dynasty time and being a rich Chinese girl . 
2. The Location is so very convenient, and I love this entire neighborhood. Very close to the temple. 
3. It is very clean and quiet. 
4. The technology in room ! They got JBL horizon speaker, and something like Alexa. 
Last but not least !!! 
5. I love meeting my new friends from the bar! The drink was delicious and delicate ! And the girls I met are so friendly and fun to hang out with! 

Oh and they have good breakfast selections, too. 

I am highly recommended this hotel, if you are bored with hotel chain ! 

The only thing is hard for foreigners is communication, the employees don’t really speak English, but they are very friendly and helpful tho! 

I wish I will go back to this hotel soon !

Conveniently located near public transportation and a picturesque temple, the spacious, clean rooms provide a comfortable retreat. The property's highlight was the complimentary cocktails in the hotel bar, a delightful touch. The staff's professionalism shone through in every aspect, making the overall stay quite enjoyable. While the property itself is charming, the breakfast proved to be dissapointing, lacking any standout elements. Overall, a pleasant stay with room for improvement in the dining experience. We would especially like to thank mr. Junhao Zeng.

On arrival you would also receive free Hanfu makeup and photoshoot, as well as a free cocktail from their bar. The area surrounding is very cultural, away from the bustle and bustle, but also just less than 5 minutes walk to a train station should you go to a different location. All in all would recommend to all travellers going to Chengdu.

For amenities, I really enjoy the personal laundry service. Although they could consider adding a weighing scale.

Breakfast quality is fantastic, just like having meal in restaurant.

The hotel is next to Wenshuyuan, which is a popular temple with lots of snacks and souvenier shops around. Not too far from a subway station.

As hotel is not accessible by car, perhaps hotel management can set up a pick up/drop off point that is clear for hotel guests and taxi drivers. 

We definitely want to stay at this hotel again!

The interior of the hotel is elegantly decorated and the furnishings are very antique. The equipment and facilities in the room are very complete, including Dyson hair dryer and smart toilet. During the stay, fruits, peanut crisps, cookies and other snacks were also given. The hotel's meals are also delicious. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner in the hotel, and they were all delicious.

It is very convenient! The front desk guy is very nice! He also gave us an 18-seed bracelet when we checked in (forgot to give a good review [covering face R]). The daily necessities are all Balmain. There is a coffee shop and a bar in the yard (there are singers performing on a daily basis). The most important thing is that there is Sichuan opera yyds! The breakfast is also very good! You can eat the special Bobo chicken, hot and sour noodles, wonton, dandan noodles... Highly recommended!

msg:Friends who like Chinese-style architecture must not miss Chengdu Courtyard Hotel. Every corner has a different scenery: the stone drum at the entrance of the courtyard, the window panes on the corridor, the screens in the hall, the carved beams and painted buildings on the roof, the lush green and colorful garden, even if you spend a whole day in the courtyard, you will be full of interest. Wake up every day with the call of the cuckoo, make a cup of fragrant tea on the terrace, or sit and watch the clouds rise, or listen to the rain hitting the eaves.
The hotel facilities exceeded my expectations. The toilet is smart, the hair dryer is Dyson, and there are disposable compressed face towels. Every little detail is considerate of the most subtle needs of guests with cleanliness. For more than ten years, I have never used the hotel's kettle and cups when traveling. For well-known reasons, I broke my hygiene prejudice here.
The room service is warm and considerate. Thank you, the butler Li Cong and Xiao Xiong, for making me feel at home.

Fu Yan and Mao Li were very nice and even gave a small gift when checking out. When we first arrived, the hotel staff showed us to the door of the room and even taught us how to use the terrace light without looking at our names. The service staff were very kind. The aunt who cleaned the room told us that small drinks were free. It is full of details, including the disposable toilet seat and alcohol spray that I needed, which won my heart. There is also a sewing kit, surprise. I ordered takeout and the staff delivered it to the door. I asked for toilet water, but I didn't actually see it. The breakfast staff also greeted me with a smile and helped to collect water. All in all, the experience was very good! The only drawback is sound insulation, but there's nothing we can do about it. The terrace is an open space, so it's acceptable. I was worried when I read the reviews before, but it was a great experience after actually staying there! Because the hotel also has public bars, restaurants, etc., but the hotel area has access control, and outsiders cannot enter. Welcome fruits were given on the first day. Haha, it’s not a big deal, I’m just happy. I’m taken very good care of. People in Chengdu are very welcoming.

I was satisfied with the check-in experience. I took a taxi to the entrance of the parking lot and there were staff to help carry my luggage. As I walked, I briefly introduced where to eat in the yard at the check-in area in the lobby. Although it was spoken in Sichuan dialect, I could hear it clearly. The breakfast variety is not as rich as a luxury five-star one, but it is enough to eat. Water and snacks are provided for free in the room. The room is clean and has no peculiar smell. The reason why I write so much is that I will choose this antique courtyard that is quiet and quiet in the middle of the bustling city in the future. Just deduct 500 from the store deposit~

On the first day, I met Yang Yang at the hotel front desk and went out to look for a hotel. Yang Yang was afraid that we were going in the wrong direction, so he led us through most of the street. Desserts, fruits and drinks are provided when you enter the room. It is so comfortable to drink tea leisurely in the yard. After a hearty breakfast the next day, we walked to Wenshu Monastery, which was a rare moment of peace during the holidays. On the day I left the hotel, due to time constraints, I had to find a snack on the street at a stall. Yang Yang walked through the crowd and found me. He gave me a bottle of hot mineral water and chatted with me. It was so warm on my last day in Chengdu. , because I fell in love with Chengdu and the hotel’s considerate service.

The two cocktails provided by the hotel were good, and the pub environment was very a**ospheric. There is also a coffee shop, so you can have a cup of coffee if you feel tired. There are many peach blossoms on the terrace where I live, and occasionally I see kittens passing by on the tile-roofed house. The hotel's face change is also nice. The summary is that there is wine to drink, coffee to drink, Sichuan opera to watch, and a lot of delicious food nearby. Wenshu Monastery is next to it, making it a one-stop convenient hotel.

If I come to Chengdu next time, I think I will give priority to this place.
The only problem is that the price with Ctrip is not cost-effective. If you extend your stay the next day, Guanwei is a little cheaper than Ctrip.

The layout is particularly particular. The hotel is like entering another world with music. So quiet. Let’s talk about service. The mineral water in the hotel is slightly different from other hotels. The courtyard will be equipped with a large bottle of mineral water, which many hotels do not have. It's not that the guests can't afford it, but that the courtyard is more considerate. A bottle of mineral water only costs a little, but the considerate service is heart-warming. During the entire check-in process, we met a Mr. Huang Gong who served us all the time, from picking up our luggage, to guiding us to the guest rooms, to introducing the history of the hotel, like a senior tour guide.

An environment that has its cake and eat it too
A family living together has space for interaction but is also independent. In addition, it has an antique-style environment, but there is a smart home inside.

Meticulous and considerate service
Miss Yang Yang who received us was warm and gentle, helped us check in smoothly, and provided us with many thoughtful suggestions. We felt at home! Every time I go back to the yard, I feel like I’m home!

An experience you can have without leaving home
The courtyard is connected to a cafe and a Hanfu experience center, so you don’t have to go far to enjoy it. It’s best to take photos in a hotel after wearing Hanfu, as there are fewer people and the scenery is better.

Breakfast was surprisingly good
I had seen good reviews for the breakfast before booking, but after eating it myself, I was still amazed! There is a wide variety of ingredients and cooking methods. If you have requirements for a healthy diet, it is highly recommended to have a nutritionally balanced breakfast like this in the morning while eating various snacks!

It is worth mentioning that the hotel has its own bar. With the cocktail coupons and Hanfu experience coupons, you can drink cocktails and take photos of Hanfu for free. I recommend everyone to come and check it out. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic. Everyone laughs and answers all questions. If there are any questions, they will help solve them immediately, especially Dongyan, the lady at the front desk. Everyone who helped coordinate the room was very professional! Highly recommended.

Surroundings: Wenshu Monastery is within easy reach. We four mothers came together to pray for our children and eat, drink and have fun. It is a very suitable place. The vendors near the scenic area are also very honest and do not ask for random prices. It is very easy to take a taxi from Chunxi Road and Taikoo Li. close.
Eat: The hotel sent cocktails from Orchid Garden. The environment is nice and there are singers singing on site, but the quality of the wine is average, haha, maybe it’s because it’s free. The Michelin restaurant in the courtyard was missed due to time. There is a sloppy mushroom soup restaurant nearby, a chicken feather shop. Pretty close too.
Accommodation: The two-bedroom suite where the four of us lived had two bathrooms, one 1.5 and one 1.8, and a small living room.

The staff are disappointing and the relationship with colleagues is not good. First of all, when I got off the bus, I was greeted warmly by an uncle, but half of the box was pushed down, and a young man yelled at me rudely and ordered him to go back to the door. But why? Why didn't you go to the door if you didn't receive the guests? Secondly, the front desk was even more amateurish. It took two people to book a room, and the room number was written wrong. They didn’t tell me where to eat breakfast and what time it started. I had to ask. I can't describe the characteristics of the hotel. I can't explain the meaning and introduction of the mechanical delivery. That is to say, it does not have the professionalism and competence that a star-rated hotel should have, nor does it have the enthusiasm and confidence of a B&B, so it is a bad review.
Too lazy to say anything else.

msg:Every time I visit a city with historical heritage, I hope to find a hotel with cultural and historical connotations, because the hotel is not only a place for temporary residence, but also the cultural carrier of the city.

Chengdu Courtyard Hotel is located in a Chengdu courtyard. The courtyard is composed of many ancient houses. These ancient houses were once the residences of Chengdu dignitaries. For example, the owner of "Jiangyuan Gongfu" is said to be an important minister during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty; the predecessor of the owner of Majia Garden He was a senior official in the Qing Dynasty; Lanyuan was the place where the British missionary Tao Ranshi worked during the Republic of China; Shangxilongyuan was the former residence of Ba Jin's grandfather Li Zhuxi; Deyuan was the former residence of Zhang Qun, a famous political figure during the Republic of China.

As soon as you walk into the Chengdu courtyard, you are immediately isolated from the surrounding noise. What you see is the antique blue bricks and red tiles, wooden lattice windows, red lanterns, brick carvings, and rattan chairs, which are full of Chinese architectural style.

The furniture in the room I ordered is also in Chinese style. The wooden lattice windows reflect the green plants and white walls and black tiles. The room is spacious, but the windows and doors cannot be opened, so fresh air cannot be provided in the morning.

The hotel gave you a coupon for the Orchid Garden Bar. You can order a cocktail after 8pm. There will be singers singing on site, and the a**osphere is great.

The breakfast is rich. Wenshu Monastery is right outside the hotel. It takes more than ten minutes to walk to the subway station. I took a taxi both in and out, which is very convenient.

msg:#When you come to Chengdu, you must stay in Chengdu Yard
I strongly recommend this unique intangible cultural heritage hotel. The hotel has its age, is thick but not heavy, has a story but is not formal [strong]
Inside the courtyard is a quaint mansion in Western Sichuan of the Ming and Qing dynasties with hundreds of years of history. Outside the courtyard is the Intangible Cultural Heritage Street, which is located in Wenshu Fang and is worth a visit. Shu brocade, Shu embroidery, silver wire drawings, and lacquerware are known as the five golden flowers of intangible cultural heritage and are living fossils of Bashu culture. [666] The hospital has its own theater with intangible cultural heritage Sichuan opera, storytelling, acrobatic face-changing and other performances, a Michelin restaurant, a bar that picks ears, and sells bean curds to shine shoes, which is simply the cultural epitome of Chengdu city [Rose]
For quasi-five-star hotels, aside from the reinforced concrete buildings of international brand hotels, the cultural heritage of this kind of building is very interesting. It is said that there are courtyards in the north, gardens in the east, Hui-style buildings in the south, and Chengdu courtyards in the west. Besides, the service environment and breakfast are very good, and the key price is reasonable[666]

I met the newlyweds at the hotel in the hotel and held a pure Chinese style wedding, and they were very happy[666]

The room we stayed in was very large and came with complimentary snacks and a mini bar. Toiletries and a hairdryer were very useful.
The location of the hotel is very good. After leaving the hotel in the morning, you can stroll nearby to have breakfast, then go to Wenshu Monastery for a stroll. It is also very convenient to visit other attractions.
All in all, it was a great experience. Fu Yan and Li Cong of the hotel also provided considerate services. If I come to Chengdu again next time, I hope to stay here again.

It’s just that there is an alley outside the window of the room, which is also a good place to drink tea and chat, but it will be a bit noisy at night. The sound insulation of the room is not very good. Fortunately, after school starts, there are many fewer people, so it is not so noisy.

The hotel is suitable for tourists, but not suitable for business.

The hotel also occupies an excellent location. Not far from the hotel is Wenshu Monastery, and there are also many delicious foods in the surrounding area: time-honored Sichuan cuisine Rongyuan, Zhang Laoer jelly, Sichuan cuisine of Jimaodian, Long Chaoshou, Yan Taipo Guokui, Laoma Tutou, Bashu Dazhaimen hot pot and so on are all within one kilometer of the hotel.
More importantly, the staff here all give people a feeling of being at home, especially thanks to the housekeeper Li Cong, a big warm boy in our small courtyard.
Next time I come to Chengdu, I will definitely stay at the Chengdu Courtyard Hotel.

Because it was a temporary hotel, there were not many room types to choose from. After checking in, I suggested that I want to change rooms. The girl at the front desk Yang Yang's enthusiastic and thoughtful communication helped us finally change to a suite that was more suitable for us with our baby during the Spring Festival peak season. He also made considerate phone calls to help us change rooms after we went out. The style of the room is very unique, and the room facilities and equipment are also very good.

It is very beautiful and the location is very good. Going out It is convenient to take a taxi, and you can stroll along the Wenshuyuan Pedestrian Street. The restaurant Wuyue Palace tastes very good, and the price is very high. The bar and coffee in the hotel are very convenient. There are not many types of breakfast but Sichuan characteristics. The price of 88 is not bad, 5 years old Half price for children below is a bit unreasonable. The front desk of the hotel, the aunt who cleans up the room, and even the staff who direct the vehicles, and the waiters in the restaurant have a good attitude, but the room service efficiency is very low. On the first day of check-in, you need to wait around the bed for three times It took more than four hours to deliver, and the room was not cleaned up after returning to the room at 3:00 in the afternoon the next day. Tourists often came in to take pictures in the hotel room and felt that the privacy was not enough.

msg:I came to Chengdu on May 11, staggering the peak period of May Day, and booked the Chengdu Yard Hotel on Ctrip. This hotel is very antique and unique. Zheng Baidan and Li Cong at the front desk are very enthusiastic. Not only did they check in quickly, but Li Cong also took the initiative to help deliver the luggage to the guest room. When we were leaving, Zheng Baidan and Li Cong sent us outside the gate again. Li Cong also helped us take a taxi by the side of the road, which moved us two old people very much. In addition, the location of this hotel is very good, it is only a wall away from Wenshu Monastery, and the small street of Baiyun Temple is also very distinctive. The breakfast was also very tasty. Thank you to the hotel staff, I will come again if I have the opportunity.

There are mosquito repellent and toilet water in the room, and the front desk will also present a mosquito repellent bracelet when needed to effectively avoid mosquitoes. By the way, the hotel also has a gym, a bar, and a self-service laundry room with complete facilities.

There is no elevator for parking in the ba*****t. The room is also in Chinese style, I like it very much. But the balcony screen door was not closed tightly, and there was a big fight against mosquitoes at night, killing four of them. I closed the balcony door, plugged in the electric mosquito coil, sprayed toilet water, and barely fell asleep. The exhaust fan in the bathroom is loud, and the towels are old and frayed. There is actually a toothbrush and toothpaste used by the previous guest on the shelf in the shower room that has not been cleaned. Looking down from the balcony, the narrow courtyard is full of parasols, completely blocking the courtyard. It doesn't live up to its name. I sent a few small gifts when I checked out. Use this fee to update the room facilities.

The scenery is better than that of many scenic spots. It is quiet in the middle of the noise, and it is a scene everywhere.
Rest tables and chairs can be seen everywhere. Walking in the rain has a special mood.
The balcony room is thought to be overlooking the garden,
As a result, only adjacent roof tiles are visible.
It's good to live in an ordinary room and spend more time in the yard.

1. The hotel is extremely bad! ! !
2. In the hotel park, there are bars, restaurants, and theatergoers. It’s crowded and chaotic!
3. Someone broke into the yard early in the morning to take photos and check in. There was no privacy at all!
4. There is no soundproofing. First, the noise from drinking, the voices of couples at night, and the sound of cars coming and going are so loud that I can’t sleep.
5. The vehicle management in the hotel park is very unsafe, children cannot play, there is no space, and there are all cluttered people.
6. The breakfast is so rubbish, it’s not even as good as a fast hotel. There are hairs on the plate, it’s disgusting!

msg:When I got off the station and was about to take a taxi, I found that the hotel and Wenshu Monastery were only within 100 meters. I thought it was a hospital, but when I arrived, I found out that it was indeed

Environment: As shown in the picture, the first picture was taken standing on the balcony of the room. It is good that the room has a small independent balcony. Picture 2 is the view that you can see when you stick your head out of the corridor window. It will probably be more in place as the flowers bloom in a short time. Figures 3 to 6 are all in the hotel yard. There are people eating and drinking. The hotel also gave out coupons for drinking, but I can’t feel the cold, so I will come again next time. The style is simple and simple, but subjectively, I prefer this taste. The room is the same as the room picture taken by Ctrip, and the buyer's show and the seller's show are still wide. Picture 789 is walking out of the hotel, there are tea drinkers picking their ears out, and turning right when you go out is Wenshu Monastery, a large red wall is a happy and beautiful picture, it is still very convenient.

Hygiene: tidy. I think it is clean, no smell, no obvious stains, and the cleaning is diligent, and I even folded my clothes. You say that the old house is spotless, but it is impossible to say that it is not, just occupy the quaintness.
Service: Well, I have to boast about this. I arrived around two o'clock in the afternoon. Although there were many guests, the guy at the front desk led the way himself. Second, I'm rather stupid, I can't turn on the cleaning lights, and I can't turn on the water in the pool. I can only call the front desk the next day when I go out and tell the front desk to clean up. The lady at the front desk is also very gentle and responsive. I explained what to do. Thirdly, the anti-mosquito stickers were given; fourthly, the waitresses and sisters I saw everywhere were smiling, and I liked it. Finally, when we left the store, Miss Baidan gave me and panda pins and bookmarks, which are so cute! If you like it, put it on immediately.
       In short, one cannot have both. My subjective feeling is that the quaint a**osphere here is very elegant, and it is also elegant in the downtown area. I can feel the hustle and bustle of drinking tea in the daytime and still have the tranquility in the corner of the yard. Then it must be accommodated that she is a bit old, and it is inevitable that there will be some problems with wooden structures. Tolerate her, after all, she is beautiful and comfortable.

Hongyan and Li Cong at the front desk took the initiative to ask about our needs and provided comprehensive services. The cleaning staff also regularly tidy up the room every day, so that we can relax after returning to the room after the journey.

msg:This hotel is a bit disappointing, and we must read more system reviews in the future. Only after checking in did I see reviews from other systems...
advantage:
Environment When I first arrived at the hotel, I felt that this old courtyard is very distinctive, and the environment is first-class. It is a fatal temptation for those who like retro. We chose a big bed room with terrace. This small terrace is a great place to relax. It’s great to sit here and bask in the sun when there is sun.
Warmth: I thought it would be colder if this kind of old house had a terrace, but after actually living in it, it feels very warm and not cold at all.

The following disadvantages:
Environment: Success is Xiao He and failure is Xiao He. It was good at the beginning, but when I became a resident, I felt bad. It’s chaotic, and all the restaurants and coffee shops are in the yard. Everyone can come in and out at will. There is a room card to enter the housing part, and the door is often not closed. To be honest, you can come in and out at will, and anyone can walk to you without barriers. doorway.
Meal: Let’s start with the afternoon tea. I’m very happy that the hotel gave afternoon tea rolls. However, the coffee shop is a small Internet celebrity bar, where you can make tea around the stove. There are many orders. We are hotel guests. This coffee First of all, it is the hotel industry, not to mention that we provide priority services. It took at least 30 minutes from when I handed in the afternoon tea roll to when I actually got the broken dim sum, and it was at the end when I said that we don't want tea, just give me dim sum (I guess the dim sum does not need to be freshly made), the waiter brought a The cheap plastic bag (with the dim sum in picture 7 inside) was dropped on the counter, and the waitress made it for me herself. Two afternoon tea rolls are two plates of this small biscuit. As a five-star hotel, how come I'm ashamed to take it out... I'm really convinced. Fortunately, the young lady of the service staff was very good. She immediately picked up the plastic bag and took it to a sheltered place next to me to pack it for me, and let me go back to my seat and wait. To tell you the truth, the service delivery lady is very good, patient and careful.
Let's talk about breakfast: there are not many things, let's not talk about the food, it's boring, it doesn't match the five stars at all. Let's talk about the big problem: cold. There is a dining area when you enter the door without any cover, and you need to wear a down jacket for breakfast. But whoever thinks more about the guests will not arrange this way at all, and the meal is shivering and cold. I want to choose a place to eat, and ask the waiter to bring me meals and tableware on a table (after nine o'clock and less than half past nine, breakfast until 10 o'clock, many seats do not have tableware), the waiter let us Sitting on another table (the other table is full of cutlery, I suspect that no one is sitting because of the cold), I said cold. Then there was no more, the waiter left... We moved the placemats over by ourselves.

Service: Just now the restaurant service is like that. After arriving at the store, I called the front desk to ask for children's slippers. After waiting for half an hour, we took a break and did not deliver them. We went out for a walk and had dinner. After dinner, we came back for three or four hours, but they did not arrive. We went to the room Call the guest room again, and it's delivered.
When checking in, the guest room was messy and no one could take it. The front desk called the lady who took the room several times, but no one answered at least three times. She even called and refused to come. Finally, the young lady who made tea saw that we had waited for a long time to take the room. our past. Clothes!

Hygiene: OK. It doesn't feel particularly dirty. There may be some dirty things hanging on the door of the bathroom because of the aging decoration.
Summary: This is a store with obvious characteristics and obvious shortcomings.
If you don’t reach the five-star rating, please don’t call yourself a five-star rating. It will mislead the next customers, and instead make everyone misunderstand and give a worse evaluation, because the five-star rating is really not like this....

The hotel design is also very classic and elegant. I saw many photos taken by celebrities doing shows, which shows that they all recognize the style and quality of the hotel .
When stepping into the yard, I feel inexplicably at ease. The rustic wood, the quiet courtyard in the busy city, the very layered garden design, and the appropriate lantern decoration, everything is so elegant. Here I suddenly realized the elegance of the national style aesthetics charm. The hotel's smart toilet is very easy to use, the hot water is also very comfortable, the bedding is very comfortable, and it is quiet and not noisy when falling asleep. The room has a classical Chinese style interior design. I slept very well this night. I am personally very satisfied. In the morning Waking up to the singing of birds, stepping into the courtyard is a relaxing feeling. The breakfast is also very rich, especially the rice noodles are delicious. It’s a great experience. I will definitely stay here again next time I come to Chengdu!

There was light rain during the stay, and I felt quite at ease watching the light rain dripping on the roof of the tiled roof. Although the hotel is a scenic spot, it doesn't feel noisy. The price is a bit expensive in Chengdu, which is better than the price of big hotels in first-tier cities. Overall, I am satisfied, and it is the hotel I hope to stay in next time

msg:Excellent location, full of cultural monuments, should be well managed and inherited. At first I thought I had booked a state-owned hotel by mistake, but later I learned that it was a private enterprise. I felt sorry for the boss. I wondered if I knew the status of the employees. The price of a suite of more than 1,000 a night is indeed not high, but the service and quality are not bought by five-star hotels.

I went to the lobby at seven in the morning and found that there was no one there. As a result, a sleepy head came out from behind the front desk and stared at us with complaining eyes, disturbing our sleep. It turned out that he actually set up a bed behind the front desk to sleep. Breakfast started at 7 o'clock, and I found that the restaurant staff took all kinds of lunch boxes to eat with the guests in the cafeteria. An employee in front of us took all the steamed buns and put the empty steamer on top. The coffee machine told the passengers catching the plane that it was broken, and then went to get the corn to eat, but in the end it was actually not turned on. The soup of Xiaolongbao is sour, it should be left over from the previous day and it has not been refrigerated. Before leaving, I checked out with two large suitcases, and asked where was the nearest taxi. Without looking up, I told us to walk 15 meters away (if you are awake, you can help the concierge who is carrying the luggage to wake up).

Later, I proposed to change the room, and waited for almost 20 minutes before the waiter came. The hygiene of the changed room was also worrying.

房間寬敞，衞生間稍顯侷促。迎賓水果有發黴，和前台反應後及時更換了，基本還是挺滿意的。服務都比較積極，贈送的十八籽説是文殊院開過光的，很喜歡

如果要説唯一缺憾，就是衞生間略冷，建議大家多開會熱水或者房間打熱一點，注意保暖就好～

1、隔音絕對硬傷，所有人的一致感受。隔壁説話一清二楚，然後如果你不幸訂了露台房，還是趕緊換了吧！我一個朋友本來是訂了幾天，當天就加錢換到馬家公館，也衹住一天就撤到了其他五星級酒店。1號樓下是隔壁院子采耳的地方，這個喧鬧，大家都懂
2、酒店安排也十分不合理。後面幾天是週末辦喜宴的人多了，川劇變臉就放到了1號樓，下面開戲，樓上地板都在震動，一天有好幾場從9點開始，就完全沒有休息可言。
3、服務，差評僅針對第一天，由於一羣人的行程原因，我4晚分成了三個訂單預訂。第一天帶去的7號樓一樓房間，一進門就是好大的煙味，我的喉嚨馬上感覺不適。反正電話前台的解決方法也衹是你自己去前台，那邊有且衹有這一間，你不要就自己過來看看那邊的房間，有且唯一…反正這種夾生的情況我第一次在五星級酒店遇上。
4、服務，退房碰到的那個男生好評，給了我們熊貓髮卡還聽我睡了不好申請了小折扣，但是第一天的體驗感太差！抱歉，沒法換好評！

早餐不差，但也説不上豪華。
有網友評論房間隔音不好，這個比較中肯，畢竟是木質結構房子，但也並不是吵得無法入睡（或許看隔壁素質吧）。

msg:位置很好就在文殊院的隔壁，房間，院子都是古香古色的佈局。房間很寬敞，衞生間有窗户。早晨醒來隔着百葉簾看外面的屋檐綠樹，聽着鳥鳴，很愜意。值得一住的酒店。唯一的缺點是酒店衞生打掃有點瑕疵，浴缸旁邊放的洗漱用品是小瓶子的，按説是一次性，可是一進來就發現一個瓶子的蓋子都沒擰好，應該是之前用過的沒有換。

msg:這趟成都之旅在院子酒店留了11 晚，住的是兩臥室套房。入住當晚一下車走進酒店，就仿如進入了古時的院子，很有古式古香的味道，這種特式酒店真的要來體驗一下，絕對會是旅程中的一個亮點！

房間：房間與酒店院子有着內外一致的古式風格，房間室內空間大。缺點是兩臥室套房只有一個洗手間，也沒有如一般套房一樣擁有獨立客廳區。房間內洗手間間中有渠臭味，希望酒店有關部門注意（已向酒店反映）。

服務：接待我們check-in 和 check-out 的前台職員（我只記得其中兩個是李聰和伏燕）非常友善親切。入住時酒店送上每人一杯免費雞尾酒券及每房一次免費漢服體驗，退房的時候也有小禮物！

早餐：款式頗多，有中西食品，每天的早餐款式也有一點少變化，不錯。

週邊： 一出酒店就是文殊坊，也鄰近文殊坊地鐵站，很方便

酒吧服務也是酒店標準的，入住時送了兩杯雞尾酒，品酒是肯定不懂的，但入口好喝。
下面説下酒店吧。
位置很好，隔壁就是文殊坊步行街，出大堂臨街的大門，就置身在步行街了，往右走兩三分鐘就是文殊院，香火很旺，但環境管理都很好，井然有序的。整條步行街人文氛圍、市井煙火相融，時尚的霸王茶姬、傳統的洞子口張老二涼粉等間雜，嚐了這家本地人常光顧的小店，涼粉、擔擔麪、紅油抄手等都好吃，其他的甜水麪等看起來也好吃，但吃不下了。
拍了張文殊院外牆的夕顏花，酒店所在區域的人文氛圍大致是這個感覺，和酒店成都古建居屋的調性相諧。酒店建築風格圖就不上了，拍的也沒有攜程頁面的好。
再説服務和酒店文化，標準的酒店服務，但給人的感覺是賓至如歸的，不刻意，但也不欺客，有求必應的同時態度都很禮貌，這種培訓方向是對的。細節也有點用心，如房間裏的書法體驗，贈送的手串、香囊，臨走再贈送的熊貓夾、書簽、中國結掛件等，整體體現酒店的人文風格。包括酒店的劇場，劉關張桃園結義主題的川劇表演，變臉表演等，應是成都文旅的一個品牌項目，很多非住店遊客觀演，人氣很旺。
餐食方面，衹吃了早餐，其他不知。早餐很豐盛，成都風味，中西餐都有，品種選擇餘地足夠，口味也很好，每天還有花樣變化。
房間體驗感，床具、潔具、浴巾毛巾等衞生基本到位，智能馬桶，床鋪軟硬適中，我的感覺還挺舒適，唯一就是枕頭有點高，個人不喜高枕。
不錯👍繼續加油啊
哦，還有，如酒店官網定，可能會比攜程便宜，這個也難説，可以比較下。

周邊環境有餐飲，酒吧，價格都合適。很方便。走不遠有個龍抄手，味道都很贊。

我住的院子大床房，房間不算太大，如果對房間大小有要求可以選擇更高級的，價格算是實在的
前台鶴瑾服務很好很熱情，我們衹來了兩天，沒有太多時間，時間充足想去周邊玩的話也可以在前台預訂周邊遊或者門票演出等等

房間設施陳舊了不過還算乾淨，訂的親子套房，外間空調感覺是壞的，居然可以設定到10℃，但是依然不給力，衞生間的門把手有問題，不好用力，洗漱的時候門不能關緊，否則很難打開。説到温度，走道和電梯口也都很悶熱，，感覺沒有空調。
優點：
1、酒店的風格，很古樸很喜歡，曲徑通幽、鬧中取靜、小橋流水、酒吧旗袍、一應俱全，院子裏還有很多供喝茶聊天的茶桌。
2、早餐是真的豐盛，住過很多酒店，這家的酒店的早餐是真的真的很贊！！
3、入住有歡迎水果，還有包裝完好的4塊精緻小蛋糕，能感受到酒店的人文關懷的態度。
4、最後説一下這家酒店的地理位置，位於一條步行街，很方便，但是由於時間緊張沒空一一逛一遍很可惜。
總的來説，為了這些優點我可以忍受設施舊了點，以後再來成都還會考慮住這裏。

服務很體貼，因為院子很大，房間的分佈廣，前台小姐姐幫忙提着行李送我們到客房。房間非常棒，床品也很舒服，零食飲料也有。可能怕老宅有異味，還送來了香薰。早餐很豐富，並且退房時還送了小禮品。
期待我們以後再見！

衞生：房間乾淨整潔。
環境：據説酒店是在古建築的基礎上改造而成，古香古色很有特別。酒店一共就兩層，有電梯。
服務：屋內的零食飲料均是免費，前台服務很好、很熱情。
總體來説，還是值得推薦的，但是由於酒店是木質結構，導致隔音不是很好。酒店表示已經開始改造了，很期待，會再入住。

房間有個大陽台，非常舒服~ 小朋友玩的很開心~
酒店房間整體設施不錯，唯獨建議洗手枱再大一點，有點小，不太夠用。另外就是陽台上外面的一個燈和躺椅壞掉了，建議維修一下。不影響整體入住體驗，還是不錯的~
另外這次攜程的預訂感受也很棒，因疫情的原因主動幫忙聯繫酒店和我們調低的房間。真心點贊!

前台可能不是本地人，不清楚文殊院開門時間。反而引導的大叔比較熟悉。不是啥大事，工作人員態度都很友好。
酒店旁邊的宮廷糕點和甜水麪值得打卡。酒店到春熙路打車15分鐘左右，出行便利。春熙路有機場大巴，到天府機場70分鐘。

温馨提醒一下：插卡取電的時候，智能馬桶會啟動沖水，小度同學可能也會發出聲音。大家不要被嚇到
