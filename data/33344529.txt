msg:I originally wanted to book the Raffles InterContinental, but netizens said the rooms in the Raffles were too small, so I decided to book the Ritz-Carlton, which turned out to be a wise decision. The night view is so stunning, the room is in the Langham style, very elegant, and the overall service is also good. Check in is on the 69th floor, the view is unbeatable, and the hotel's exclusive elevator to the room is down, which is not very accustomed to at first, but it's okay after getting used to it. Also, there is the Cloud Bar on the 70th floor, where many beautiful ladies come to check in at night. The only drawback of the hotel is that there is no swimming pool, everything else is very good.

msg:On my recent trip to Chongqing, I chose a hotel with a great view in the city center, which not only provided an unparalleled panoramic view of the city, but also allowed me to experience an extraordinary level of service. During this stay, I was particularly grateful for the professional service of the hotel manager Maggie. She not only personally handled my check-in procedures, but also solved various problems I encountered during my stay, showing excellent solution capabilities and meticulous customer care.

Maggie's expertise was particularly important in guiding me to taste the authentic Chongqing cuisine. Through her introduction, I was able to explore a variety of local specialties, each of which showed extremely high culinary standards and regional characteristics.

Located in Jiefangbei, the hotel's excellent location provides great convenience for visiting Chongqing's major iconic attractions. The room can enjoy a spectacular view of the bustling downtown area, and the city lights are particularly charming at night.

Overall, the hotel's service level and facility configuration meet high-end international standards, making it a great choice for travelers seeking a top-notch accommodation experience. Here, every employee shows meticulous care to ensure that every guest enjoys a distinguished and comfortable experience. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to travelers who expect to have an extraordinary accommodation experience in Chongqing.

msg:On the day of check-in, the hotel guest service center (AMY) called me to tell me what I needed for the room. I asked for an upgrade, but AMY didn't seem to have the authority on the phone. Finally, when I asked if there was any welcome fruit, AMY's answer was: welcome fruit is only provided to Ctrip Black Diamond users. I don't understand this very much. Now most high-end brand hotels will provide welcome fruit, not for Ctrip Black Diamond members or Hyatt members. But in the end, when AMY told me whether I was a member of the hotel, my answer was: "No." AMY's answer was: If not, we only provide welcome fruit and room upgrades for Hyatt members. Finally, AMY heard that my needs were not met, added WeChat, and told me that she helped me register for Hyatt membership (upgraded room type and gave welcome fruit), and told me the membership number. However, she didn't tell me how to log in to the membership account, what rights and interests I enjoy, etc. I asked. Finally, the Hyatt member account still failed to log in successfully. I told AMY the member account problem, and she only told me: "You can directly contact the Hyatt customer service center, manual customer service, account activation problem" (this is her original words • 24 words). Since you told me that I need to contact manual customer service, how can I contact it? I searched for Hyatt's customer service phone number on the Internet, but I have not found it so far, including the official website. Such an image ambassador, for me who stays in the hotel, the service is not qualified, and it does not meet my ideal expectations. As for the room, on the afternoon of the second day of check-in, I called the service center to report that there was a roaring sound in the room at midnight last night and during the lunch break today, and I did not rest well, and asked the takeaway on the table in the room to be cleaned and three towels to be replenished. When we returned to the room at night, the takeaway was not cleaned and the three towels were not delivered. It may be because we turned on the do not disturb light in the afternoon, resulting in no door cleaning. If this is the case, I have told the service center that we need cleaning. Even if the room attendant finds that the do not disturb light is on, if the service center does not confirm, should they call the guest again to confirm whether cleaning or cleaning is needed. Finally, for the roaring noise in the room, even after I left the hotel for almost a week, they still didn't give a reasonable explanation. I still went to your store to read the previous reviews and replies, which were really casual, to the extreme, and almost every sentence was the same routine, and none of them answered the guests' hearts. It was really terrible!

As a Chongqing native from Sichuan, I am not good at eating spicy food, and I am not good at climbing hills. Fortunately, it was cool today, otherwise I would still be heat-intolerant. I was not able to check in five famous Chongqing attractions at once like Sister Cai, ignoring the Liziba Light Rail and Chongqing Shiba Ladder Traditional Style Area [sun]. The location of the hotel is quite good, and it is very convenient to check in Hongyadong and the city center. I took my children to visit the nearby Chongqing Bombing "June 5" Tunnel Ruins Museum, learned patriotism education, and bought the hot and sour noodles that I had been thinking about. The taste of the flagship store of Bayi Food Street is still the same as it was 20 years ago. In the evening, I enjoyed the hotel's seafood buffet. The night view and food are not to be missed. Thank you very much to our exclusive butler Vivian, who provided caring, thoughtful, enthusiastic and professional services throughout the whole process. I give you five-star praise and will recommend it to my relatives and friends next time.

msg:I did a lot of research before departure, and I personally think that the evaluation of this hotel is not accurate: First of all, there are enthusiastic staff on the first floor to help with luggage, and they will take it all the way to the 69th floor. The elevator is not difficult to wait for. The front desk and lobby manager are very enthusiastic and answer all questions. The room was upgraded for free, but only one of the two toilets is smart; the breakfast is also very good. Although there are many people, it is orderly and not noisy; the hotel is also very orderly, and there are no tourists who come back and forth to punch in; the 24-hour gym is right opposite the "Double-sex Pot". The reason why the service cannot be given full marks is that the room service is really too bad. When I checked in at 5 pm, I asked for slippers and water, and it was not delivered until 9 pm when I urged again. The welcome fruit was also given after several requests. The most outrageous thing is that I asked for a quilt around 10 pm, and it was not delivered until 11:40, and I called again in the middle. It is really impossible to give a good review. It should be noted that there will be people taking artistic photos at WFC who forcibly block the exit in order to make you go downstairs from the stairs with the storefront for taking photos. This really drags down the score.
Because there are so many negative reviews about this hotel online, and based on my original intention of coming here to check in at high altitude, I am going to change hotels today, hoping for some new surprises.

You can overlook the night view of Chongqing Yuanyang Hotpot and the Magic City while lying in the room. The location of the hotel is very good. It is on the Yuzhong Peninsula. Most of the tourist attractions in Chongqing are nearby and can be reached on foot. The room is clean and hygienic, with high comfort. The overall feeling is very good, which makes me feel at home. The air conditioner is very powerful and the cooling effect is very good. My girlfriends woke up several times because of the cold. Although it is summer, they can only stay by the window to bathe in the sun for heating. The main feature is the cooling effect. The hotel housekeeper Vivian is very good and enthusiastic. The service attitude and service awareness are very good. Every service detail is done very well. She is warm and thoughtful, and the people are beautiful, leaving a very deep impression. The night view of the hotel is super good. Although romance doesn't cost money, enough romance requires enough money. My girlfriends like it very much and are very happy. Not only can they take pictures of kissing on the light rail, but also Hongyadong and Qiansimen Bridge. The room is also very soundproof, the layout is perfect, elegant and romantic, the wifi is also very smooth, and the room is also prepared with various small surprises. Oh~ The only drawback is that the hot and cold water in the kitchen are connected in reverse, which does not match the label. It would be great if the air conditioner can also be used for heating in summer, so that people with weak constitutions do not have to worry about being cold at night. In short, this hotel is a place to fulfill dreams and is very worth staying in. You must be unswerving about the people and things you love. Although the pace is slow, it is very romantic. Meeting is God's will, and having is happiness. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Chongqing.

I am surprised that this is a four-star hotel with no swimming pool. The weirdest thing is that I caught up on the day of check-in. Let's hold a conference for a certain micro-business... The hotel lobby is set at the highest position on the 69th floor, so you can only rely on elevators to go up and down the stairs. One of them is a dedicated direct connection from 69 to the 1st floor. Then you encounter many people dressed like agents. People were queuing up to wait for the elevator...there were drunken people in the lobby chatting...in short, it just felt messy and no one cared about it.
The location of the hotel is very good, just 5 minutes' walk from Jiefangbei and Hongyadong. However, the service and awareness really need to be improved. After all, we are also sleeping. Since picky guests like us are willing to spend more money to stay in a good hotel, it must be I hope I can isolate some idle people and get a better experience.

I will come again next time if I have the chance, and continue to stay, haha!

It has an excellent location, only a hundred or two hundred meters away from Jiefangbei. The room is bright and comfortable, and the breakfast is rich and delicious, made with great care. I will choose this hotel again when I go to Chongqing next time.

Every staff member is very polite and considerate, but one morning when I went to the restaurant for dinner at 7 o'clock in the morning, there were only two or three slices of bread. Was it left over from the previous day? Because there were few people in the restaurant at that time in the morning, it was definitely not eaten that morning, which made me feel very bad

She was very considerate and thoughtful. The problems I reflected were solved in time. Great praise 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻. Then, when I got off the car, there was an uncle from the hotel to help me take my suitcase, waiting for me to check in, and then helped me send my luggage to the room with a sincere and enthusiastic attitude! The room was very clean, the equipment was very complete, and the bed was very comfortable to sleep on, and I didn't have back pain. I arrived on the 7th. It rained that day, so the scenery I took was gray, but the weather was very good the next day, and the scenery from the room was very beautiful. The room is in a good position, and you can see Raffles, Jialing River and Yangtze River. The scenery at night is even better. The hotel is in an excellent location, the most central location, whether it is Hongyadong or Raffles Shibati, it is very close, just a few steps away. In addition, all the service staff of the hotel will greet me when they see me, which is very worthy of praise! The guy at the front desk was very efficient. The charger and heater I mentioned were delivered to my room right away. When I ordered takeout, it was delivered to my room right away as long as I called! It made me feel very comfortable and I didn't feel neglected! I will stay at the Ritz Hotel next time I come to Chongqing, because I think it is worth it and the price is worth it! The Ritz Hotel is the first choice for everyone to come to Chongqing, just listen to me and buy it with your eyes closed!!!

The only drawback is that the hair dryer is very poor, the same level as the 100-yuan small hotel on the roadside. You don't need to change to Dyson like the executive room, and a better domestic one will only cost two or three hundred yuan.

In addition to the basic rest and washing areas, there are additional dressing cubicles, which are thoughtful and considerate. The bathroom is spacious and bright, with a reasonable layout, shower, bathtub, two washbasins, automatic flushing toilet, etc., so that guests will not feel cramped when washing at the same time... Entering the lobby on the 69th floor, the waiters' warm smiles and warm reminders make the guests feel at home. The breakfast is also exquisite and delicious, with Chinese, Western and Chongqing's main local specialties, and there is a lot of room for choice. Sitting by the floor-to-ceiling window, while enjoying the food, you can also overlook the beautiful scenery of Erjiang, the most prosperous and CBD area in Chongqing (the night view is even more dazzling), which makes people feel relaxed and happy... In short, our group all think that it is a very cost-effective mid-to-high-end hotel, and it is worth choosing again next time! !

The river view is beautiful, the breakfast is quite rich, and the room can provide many considerate personal supplies. The breakfast is very basic but also has local characteristics. The hardware is slightly worse than that of InterContinental. Due to the large number of people on the day of check-in, the room card can only be picked up at 16:00. The travel route was temporarily adjusted. The hotel was very considerate. After understanding the needs, the check-out time was also assisted in delaying, so that everyone can plan the itinerary in advance later.

msg:Very good hotel, live in the room facing Chaotianmen and Raffles, several important Internet celebrity spots are very close, Hongyadong, Kuixing Tower, Daijiaxiang Trail, Jiefangbei, etc., are all within walking distance. However, I advise everyone to walk as little as possible, it is too difficult to find, Chongqing refreshed my understanding of 100 meters.

Back to the hotel, the lobby is on the 69th floor. If you drive, you need to park your car in the underground garage. It is best to go to B3, where there are many parking spaces, and then take the elevator to the 1st floor, and then go from the 1st floor to the lobby on the 69th floor to check in. After getting the room card, take the elevator downstairs to the room. The elevator is a little troublesome.

The room is very good, the decoration is very new, and the facilities are very complete.

If you have to say the shortcomings, there is one, that is, there is no gap under the door of the shower room, and the towel for stepping on the foot will be squeezed away when placed on the ground. It is estimated that this was not considered during the decoration. In addition, the buttons of the smart toilet are a bit strange, just use the normal one, which made me learn it before I can use it.

In short, I am very satisfied overall and spent a pleasant two days in Chongqing!

The daily necessities delivered to the bathroom are dirty when opened. It is estimated that they have not been used for a long time. You need to call the service desk to deliver the takeaway upstairs, otherwise it will be left on the first floor. I don't know why I waited for an hour and a half for the first time and it was not delivered. It is recommended to stay in a room facing the Raffles direction. There is nothing to see towards Jiangbeizui. Anyway, Hongyadong is blocked

The overall hotel service awareness is particularly strong. Regardless of the front desk, cleaning, room staff, and restaurant staff, all kinds of service staff can take the initiative to serve and help solve problems before you ask. The view from the room is very pleasant, and the Jialing River, the Yangtze River and the Chaoyangmen Wharf can all be seen. The night view is superb, and the hotel stay is worth the money.

First of all, the location is right on Jiefangbei Pedestrian Street. Go downstairs and go out to the pedestrian street. To get to Hongyadong, just cross the overpass. The hotel is located upstairs in the financial center. Needless to say, the view and quality are high. Secondly, when it comes to service, service is also an important factor when choosing a hotel. The service at the Ritz is really great. I am especially grateful to Mr. Feng Linlin who checked us in. He was meticulous, caring and attentive, because we only checked in after watching the concert in the evening. The fatigue of the day was greatly relieved and surprised by the high-quality and attentive service. It was such a happy stay experience. After checking in, Mr. Feng also accompanied us to the elevator to the upward room and reminded us again of the breakfast time and location. It was really thoughtful.

msg:The hotel is very good. I stayed for 2 nights and spent 3 days shopping in Yuzhong District, and I understood it well. To be honest, I think this hotel should be the best luxury hotel nearby. First, the geographical location goes without saying. Just downstairs is the Jiefangbei, and the Jiefangbei is within walking distance to Hongya Cave, Mountain City Trail, Shibati, and Bayi Food Street. Secondly, it is the height. It is currently the tallest building and the scenery is needless to say. Thirdly, the river view, the river view has to see the Jialing River and the Yangtze River, that is, it has to see the intersection of the two rivers. I stood on a high building and saw that this position is invincible. I found that some hotels can see the Yangtze River, and some can see the Jialing River, but to see everything and clearly, it has to be this hotel. Don’t doubt it, it’s his hotel. And I also understand that the two rivers are actually the same thing, just divided into two parts by a plain. Fourthly, the service is very good. Even though I was so busy during the Spring Festival, I didn't miss it. I was told to provide more water for tea. Not only did it come with tea sets, but also I took a huge amount of water. Finally, I will add a few more pictures. The area, river view and sleeping position of the 270-degree room are absolutely amazing... Go for it!

She called me the day before check-in to ask if I had any requirements for the room I wanted to stay in. She could arrange and decorate it for me in advance, which I was very satisfied with. There is an art gallery downstairs in the hotel, which is great. Just a few minutes from the back door is Jiefangbei and Bayi Snack Street, which is very convenient. The river view downstairs is also very charming. The only drawback is that the sound insulation is not that good. I am very satisfied with this trip. There are no problems like previous netizens.

msg:First of all, I would like to praise the hotel staff Li Xiangwei. As soon as we arrived at the hotel door that day, we met Comrade Li. He was very proactive and enthusiastic in helping us carry our luggage. When we asked him how to travel around Chongqing reasonably and efficiently, he was very attentive in planning the route for us. When receiving other guests, he did not forget to come to us and continued to design travel routes for us so that we could travel in the most time-saving and effortless way. Everyone knows that the most expensive thing to visit in Chongqing is feet, so his suggestions were very helpful for our entire trip. To be honest, it was so useful that when I returned to the hotel every day, I would check to see if he was there. I wanted to say hello to him and say thank you. I must give him a thumbs up for his enthusiasm and warmth👍👍👍. The hotel itself is located on the 58th to 74th floors of the World Financial Center. It is the real top of Chongqing. You need to buy a ticket to view the night view at the top of the building. The hotel is in a prime location. It is convenient to go anywhere. Metro lines 1 and 2 are very close. There is Raffles City in the front, Liberation Monument in the back, Jiangling River on the left, and Chongqing night view on the right. You can take photos in the room or in the lobby. It’s a big block, but it’s a pity that it’s separated by glass😜. We live on the 60th floor. Personally, I feel it’s high enough. We can see the surrounding buildings at our feet. From the river view room, we can easily see the intersection of the three rivers and several bridges. My daughter and I will see through it every morning and evening when we go back. Take some photos through the window😜, the room and bathroom are very grand, there is delicious coffee, and there is also a separate dressing room, which is especially considerate for girls, where they can sit and play around. There is a gourmet restaurant on the ground floor. I had an authentic Chongqing breakfast. I forgot what it was called. It was quite good. In short, the experience was very good, especially the warm and considerate service of the staff at the door, Li Xiangwei, which made us have a very good experience in the first place. First impression!

I would like to complain that the parking space downstairs is too small. It will be a bit crowded to park a medium to large SUV or above, and it is easy to knock the car door.
There is a restaurant on the 6th floor that is very delicious and I had two meals there.

The room was more than 100 square meters, so big. The view from the room is also superb. There are fewer things in the executive lounge, but they are more exquisite. The room is also very clean.

msg:Share your entire experience staying at this hotel
1. Check-in: Go to the hotel front desk around three o'clock in the afternoon and tell you that the room is not clean yet and you need to wait. We managed to arrange a room for check-in.
2. Room hygiene: The bathroom smells of cigarette smoke. As an international five-star hotel, should there be distinction between non-smoking floors and smoking floors?
3. Let’s talk about the facilities: The hotel lobby and buffet restaurant are really simple in terms of soft and hard decoration, and there is no hint of the Hyatt Reserve style.
4. Breakfast: Breakfast should be the soul of a hotel. After walking around for a long time, Chongqing, as a tourist destination, should have some local characteristics. I can’t compliment the product and taste.
5. Service: Place an order around 19:30 on Tuesday night, and cancel without exemption before 20:00. Because I have to go to Tongliang on a business trip on Wednesday, I will contact the hotel before 21:00, hoping to cancel without exemption. The front desk informed me that cancellation is possible, but the reservation depar**ent I already got off work at 20:00, so I asked the reservation depar**ent to come to work at 9:00 the next day and ask me to call again to inform me of the cancellation. Since I was having dinner with a client, I agreed. I contacted the hotel reservation depar**ent at 10:00 the next day, and the person who answered the phone told me that I could cancel and let Ctrip issue an order. I contacted Ctrip to issue an order, but they refused. Ctrip called me again and asked me to communicate with the hotel. I called the reservation depar**ent again. The girl who answered the phone impatiently told her that she needed to check with the front desk to see if the front desk had agreed to cancel the night before. After waiting for more than half an hour, Ctrip sent me a message. Manager Deng of the hotel reservation depar**ent refused to cancel. It is not necessary to check in according to the rules. The management of a hotel is so chaotic, and I am only less than an hour away from being exempted from cancellation, which is such a huge difference in my room income.
After checking in, the assistant manager at the lobby called and came to apologize. To be honest, it was unnecessary. Because I don’t want to be disturbed after checking in. 🈶Why don’t you train your employees properly during this time? A warm service is called service. It wouldn't be like this if you had a little bit of empathy.
I can only say that I won’t go there again next time
Finally, let me talk about the French style decoration of the room and the furniture is not bad, it is Accor Langham style. In addition, the concierge on the first floor after check-out took the initiative to call a taxi.

msg:The service is very good. I originally stayed in the king-size bed room. When I entered it, the smell was uncomfortable. I was immediately upgraded to a side cover. I have to give it five stars for this. They also asked about my experience when I checked in and out, even though I was wearing a mask😷 and there were few responses.
The breakfast is also satisfactory, with enough choices and freshly made ones.
The location is good, right next to Jiefangbei. It is convenient to take a taxi or take the subway. The night view is beautiful, and it is very close to visit Hongya Cave alone at night.
The room is clean, the bathroom is big enough, and the air conditioner heats up slowly.
The only drawback is that the sound insulation is poor. There is a night owl next door who stays up at one or two o'clock in the middle of the night watching TV, but I can hear it clearly. In addition, I hope the hotel can change the fragrance. The current one really doesn't smell particularly good and is not high-end.

Definitely need to find a better hotel.
Facilities: The room facilities are complete and equipped with everything. Basically, there is no shortage of this or that.

Service: Elsie, the room housekeeper, added her contact information in advance to inquire about check-in requirements. There was a small problem in the middle, but it was solved in time. Check-in and check-out are very fast and there is basically no need to wait. The staff in all depar**ents of the hotel are very enthusiastic and take the initiative to say hello to the guests when they see them. The best part is that takeout can be delivered to the room, so you don't have to go downstairs to get it.

Disadvantages: We came back late in the evening, several elevators were closed, and there were no staff to guide us on the first floor. We didn’t know which one we should take, or other guests told us.

Overall it's very good, but at this price point, these are standard features of a good hotel, so keep it up.

She is very familiar with the surrounding areas and even many places in Chongqing. If you need to know how to play or eat, you can consult her. She has a strong sense of service.

Because the high floor has a great night view, it is very good for taking photos. If you are disabled, you can take any photos. The filters are very nice. The top of the building is where you can check in at the top of Chongqing. There is also a wings bar at night, which is perfect.

The hotel floor has a panoramic view of the scenery, and it is also very convenient to go to Hongya Cave, Yangtze River Cableway, etc., but the air was not ventilated during the two days I stayed. The evening snacks on the executive floor are good. Compared with its price positioning, the hotel hardware and breakfast still have a lot of room for improvement. As a high-end hotel, it can add a little more tonality.

msg:I really don't want to say anything. I'm speechless. I stayed in the hotel for four or five days. Because the flight ticket was suddenly cancelled, I wanted to delay the check-out for a while, but I couldn't delay it. The air conditioner broke down in the middle of my sleep in a hotel that costs more than one thousand yuan. I woke up from the heat. I found a master to come in and fix it, but it didn't fix it. The room was not big. There was nothing good except the night view. The bathroom door was broken. The toothbrush in a hotel that costs more than one thousand yuan is also very low. There is also a door to a suite in a king-size bed room. I don't want to say anything. This broken hotel doesn't even have a laundry room. Chongqing is good in everything, but this hotel is not good. Unless you are stupid and have a lot of money, don't come here. The experience is very bad 👎 I have stayed in many hotels, and it is rare to find such average service facilities in a hotel that costs more than one thousand yuan. The price-performance ratio is too poor

2. Bonus points: I like the breakfast in the hotel (but I don’t recommend eating it consecutively, there are less changes), and I like the bar upstairs, which can be quiet or noisy (the guy who took us upstairs is very clean and handsome, extra points, but it’s a pity) I only noticed the bar on the last day, otherwise I would go and drink a little every night)
3. The elevator is a bit clumsy. You can’t swipe your card from the first floor to go to your room.

Not only did he help us order Pengge Cantonese cuisine, which is said to be the ceiling of Chongqing Cantonese cuisine, but he also gave us a birthday cake for our child's birthday and decorated the guest room, which moved us very much. The location of the hotel is super good. The scenery from the floor-to-ceiling windows is unparalleled. You can see the two rivers and four banks. I will definitely choose Lisiri next time I go to Chongqing.

msg:I came to the mountain city of Chongqing again after thirty years. This city has undergone earth-shaking changes. The porters have long since disappeared from the bustling Chaotianmen Pier, replaced by modern high-rise buildings rising from the ground. The experience of staying at The Ritz-Carlton Reserve, Hyatt Collection was great. I felt at home. It is worth spending more time and space to share my feelings. The hotel management has a resolute, high-efficiency and top-down execution ability from discovery to resolution of any problem. At the beginning of my stay, I met the duty manager Mr. Deng by chance. Because I have traveled around the world all year round, stayed in hotels of various grades and brands, and have been in the service industry for decades, I instinctively made some small suggestions. Manager Deng was very sincere. He listened carefully and expressed his gratitude to me. When I returned to the room in the evening, I saw the fruit plate and red wine presented to my wife and me, as well as the card handwritten by Mr. Deng. My wife and I were very happy. The hotel's rooms, the lobby and restaurant on the 69th floor, and even the executive lounge and gym all have first-class river and city views. The cloud bar open at night offers a 360-degree panoramic view of the entire Chongqing scenery. The room is fully equipped with a Nespresso capsule coffee machine, top-quality TWG tea bags for free, and the drinks in the Mini Bar are also very reasonably priced. There are many varieties of breakfast, which is much richer than the Sheraton Hotel I stayed at the day before, and there is also Haagen-Dazs ice cream. The hotel's service is meticulous, whether it's the tall and pretty girl who presses the elevator button for me in the lobby, Dove in the executive lounge, Ciccy who greets me at breakfast, the restaurant manager and the waiters all call me "Zhang" when they see me. Sir, it feels very friendly and the attention to detail makes the Hyatt Reserve stand out among many five-star hotel brands. Special praise for the excellent service in the executive lounge and breakfast restaurant. The staff will always appear when you need it without disturbing your meal. This is the highest level of service. When we left, the lobby manager on the first floor sent us to the underground parking lot. Due to space limitations, we cannot record them all. I would like to make another small suggestion. If the bottled purified water in the guest room is replaced with natural mineral water, although it will only increase the cost slightly, it will give the guests a better experience. The executive lounge can add a small amount of hot food at specific times every day, two or three times. In addition, as modern people pay more and more attention to health, some people prefer to drink mineral water or purified water instead of juice for breakfast. It would be better if it can be provided. Although I only stayed at the Lisiri Hotel Chongqing for one night, my wife and I left a wonderful and profound impression on our southwest self-driving trip from our home in Shenzhen. I would like to thank the hotel management and ordinary employees for their hard work. I hope you can maintain extremely high standards in both hardware and software and continue to strive for excellence!

msg:Location: The hotel is in a great location. It is in the World Financial Center building, the tallest building around. There is a WFC upstairs in the hotel that should be an observation deck and an attraction, but we didn't go up. I just lay on the bed in the room and watched the scenery! Floor-to-ceiling windows, unparalleled views. You can see three bridges across the river, and you can see the panoramic view of the landmark Raffles City Center with a wide view. Just a two-minute walk downstairs from the hotel is the Liberation Monument, and next to it is the Bayi Food Street. Jiefangbei Pedestrian Street. There are many shopping malls, snacks, restaurants, supermarkets and cafes. Crowded. (There is a small stall across the road from the hotel's main entrance. All kinds of noodles, steamed buns, and rice noodles are very delicious.) After entering the hotel and entering the room, I couldn't hear any noise, except for the faint sound of a few ship whistles. The room was very quiet. There were not many people in the hotel and there were no groups. I haven't met anyone in the corridor these few days I've been here. Most are business people and independent tourists.
Facilities and hygiene: It smells good when you enter the hotel, the room facilities are new, and the bedding is clean and tidy. The shower room and toilet are separated by a wall. Can be used at the same time without embarrassment. The bathroom is large and has a table to sit on. The water is strong and the temperature is stable. The bathtub is big and wide, making it very comfortable to take a bath.
Service: As soon as the order was confirmed, the dedicated butler Vivian called and added WeChat. Come and ask about arrival time and any requirements. I asked to reserve a room with an unobstructed river view for me, and Vivian indeed reserved a room with an unrivaled river view for me. She also sent a greeting message after arriving at the store, asking me to contact her if I had any questions or needs. Makes me feel like service is all around me. I also requested a late check-out and was given a free late check-out. Check-in at the front desk was also very fast. When the service staff saw people queuing up, they immediately opened a counter to quickly check in for the queuing guests. The hotel lobby is on the 69th floor. To go to your room and to the first floor, you have to switch to the elevator in the lobby. At first, I was worried that the wait would take too long and that it would be too troublesome. There is actually no need to worry. First, I took a look at the hotels in Chongqing. Most of the high-rise buildings have to use elevators. Second: The service of the concierge is simply not that good. There is the hotel’s concierge counter on the first floor. Every time I see a guest coming, I run over and press the elevator first. There are two elevators on the first floor that lead directly to the hotel. Don’t mix them with others. , the elevator came soon. When we arrived at the lobby, the concierge service staff saw a guest coming, and immediately ran to press the elevator for the guest to go to the room. This elevator is also exclusive to the hotel, so you basically don’t have to wait. I didn't find this troublesome or long waiting time at all. There was a concierge, I didn't see his name clearly, he was tall, and he smiled when he saw the guests opening the elevator door far away. His smile was particularly enthusiastic, sincere, and full of joy. As soon as I see him smile, I want to laugh too. It makes people feel happy and kind.
Others: There is a coffee machine in the room, four bottles of mineral water (daily), three coffee capsules, and 6 TWG tea bags for free. The thoughtful thing is that there are also two disposable coffee cups. You can brew coffee and drink it while walking.
The only thing I would like to suggest is that there are no rubber slippers for bathing. You have to wear disposable cotton mops to take a shower. Although the cotton mops are of good quality and thick, they are difficult to dry when wet. But you can ask for two pairs to change into dry ones after bathing.
The hotel does not take the initiative to provide disposable items, but you can call the room to request them, which is very comprehensive. Everything you want is available. There is a list in the bathroom.
The price is a little more expensive than others, but the location is good, the setting is new, the scenery is beautiful, and there are not many people. I didn't book a room with breakfast, so I won't comment.

Except for the online concierge service, the lobby manager, front desk and duty manager's ability to handle things is so inefficient that it's suffocating. The emotional intelligence is so low that I would suggest not to do it. In the service industry, the room and washroom infrastructure is imperfect. There is no small mirror. There is no trash can. The design of the luggage table is very unreasonable. A larger suitcase cannot fit in and it looks very crowded. This is the only hotel I have ever stayed in that has no turndown service and no welcome fruit. There is no point at the front desk. The two girls winked. The housing arrangement was thousands of miles away from the elevator. The room didn’t look good at all when taking pictures. This was the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in in Chongqing. I suggest you choose some old star-rated hotels that are more reliable.

Facilities: The hotel is on floors 53-63 of the Global Center. The lobby is on the 69th floor. The view from the room is very good. With large floor-to-ceiling glass, you can have a panoramic view of the two rivers at night. It is beautiful!

Serve:
       The hardware facilities of the hotel are very good, but staying in a hotel is to feel like home. I think the service at Lisiri is really great. Let me talk about my feelings:
Before check-in: Vivian, the housekeeper, called in advance and told us how to get to the hotel by car through WeChat, and had all the travel guide, surrounding food and other relevant information ready to send. This was very useful for me when traveling to Chongqing. It gave me a feeling like home 👍👍👍 From entering the store to leaving the store, Vivian was always available and was very responsive. really thankful!
Waiter: Since the hotel is on a high floor, the elevators need to be switched, but the hotel's waiters are very enthusiastic and proactive. They pick up luggage, press the elevator, and actively help check out. The expression is very clear and the guests are very considerate.
Cleaning staff: The hotel cleaning staff is also very enthusiastic and proactively asks if there is anything else you need! The room was also super clean! In fact, a large part of hotel maintenance requires cleaning!

Catering: The hotel restaurant is on the 69th floor with a great view! The hotel has a rich breakfast, including Chongqing specialty noodles, delicious pastries, and even Haagen-Dazs ice cream. The kids loved it! By the way, there is a coffee machine in the room, and TWG coffee is delicious!

In short, for me who travels everywhere, Chongqing Lisiri is the hotel with the best environment and the best service I have ever stayed in. It shows humanity in every aspect. I will recommend it to my friends!

msg:Selling dog meat over sheep’s heads, using the Hyatt Reserve Collection, which is completely different from Hyatt
The elevator is shaky on floors 1-69
The bath towel was not washed thoroughly and was a bit sticky.
At 11:21, the waiter knocked on the door and asked what he was doing. But he opened the door directly with the key card and came in. The key thing is that no one apologized. When he saw someone closing the door and leaving, he was confused and speechless.
Chengdu Hyatt Reserve has secured the Hyatt brand, and its services and hotels are all very good. Hyatt Reserve Chongqing is here to hit the market. It is a basic copycat version of a big name. Except for the logo, one is worth ten thousand yuan, and the other is It's like a few dozen dollars, but the difference is so big. It feels like spending money to buy a Hyatt Grand Selection. The service and staffing are not at the same level at all. I don't know how Ctrip passed the five-diamond review.

As shown in the picture: There is no trace of Hyatt, except for the name Ctrip!
Please give me honest feedback. Please don’t call me for a follow-up visit. Thank you!

msg:Full marks hotel! ! It can be described as one of the top hotels in Chongqing. Because it happened to be my birthday, the hotel specially upgraded the room type, which is very thoughtful. I did not choose the wrong Lisirui when I came to Chongqing. Here, casual photos are handsome...

Facilities: high-end, well-equipped. A look at the material, is to use a more advanced material. Great touch and style. Now all hotels in Chongqing implement environmental protection, and the front desk will take the initiative to inquire about the disposable supplies needed.

Hygiene: Hotel room cleaning pays great attention to hygiene. Floors, ceilings, bed sheets and quilt covers are frequently wiped and washed to keep them clean. High dryness, neat and standardized. The bathtub is great, one of the few hotel bathtubs I can choose to soak in! It's really enjoyable to look at the scenery. If only there were bath balls! Cry faint.

Environment: The hotel is located on the 69th floor of Universal, you can overlook Chongqing and have a panoramic view! See the meeting of "Mandarin Duck" (Jialing River and Yangtze River) red soup and white soup. The unique fragrance of each hotel, I like the taste of Lisi Rui very much. Light and very agile. It is 100 meters away from the most lively Jiefangbei in Chongqing, and there are many high-end shopping malls, but it is quiet in the middle of the noise! Not affected.

Service: The service staff smiles all the way to help you solve problems and matters you need. It is very thoughtful to take the initiative to provide birthday decorations for birthday customers. Strawberry shortcake was offered. The beautiful scenery, coupled with this small sense of ceremony. Let people feel the romance of the mountain city!

Breakfast: Dining in the high-altitude restaurant will give you a full sense of experience and a lot of things. Waiters are polite. Open at 6:30, you can see the sunrise!

Service: The hotel service is good, the staff are warm and polite, and they deal with problems in a timely manner. There are some unexpected problems in the room (6719), but the staff's handling and public relations awareness are very good;
Facilities: The hotel is a bit old. The former Lisry Hotel was not the Hyatt, but the overall decoration of the hotel is good. The breakfast is not as rich as the expected five-star hotel. It may be related to the local breakfast habits in Chongqing. The lower floors of the hotel are shopping malls and office buildings , you need to transfer to the elevator to enter and exit the hotel, which is a bit inconvenient;
Highlights: Floor-to-ceiling windows in the room provide river views and city night views, and the rooftop viewing floor has a good view;

It’s about 10-15 minutes’ walk from Raffles City (Chaotianmen) and Hongya Cave (there are few people, and the journey is 10 minutes downhill, and there are many people, and it’s a 15-minute uphill road back to the hotel). The little brother who cleans the room is very nice and polite, and responds to every request. Whether the hotel is on the first floor or the 69th floor, the service attitude of the staff is also very good. They will take the initiative to help press the elevator and deliver food to the room. If you don’t book the hotel’s breakfast, there are three very authentic Chongqing noodles downstairs. The taste is very good. I like the blue and white porcelain tea cups and coffee cups in the room, and I bought them home. You have to go to the 69th floor to transfer first.

The hair dryer is from Dyson, and the sound insulation effect is pretty good. , It’s just that the floor sometimes creaks when you step on it, but I don’t mind it too much. You can see if it needs to be repaired. The tv is small but I don't watch tv and it doesn't bother me.
Hygiene: clean and tidy, no major problems
Environment: The river view is great. Turn off the lights in the room at night to see the night view outside. The effect is similar to that of the viewing platform of Huixian Building on the 75th floor (I am a big wronged person, so I went up to see it haha), so I don’t need to spend extra money to buy a ticket to go up La.
Service: I would like to praise the service. Not long after I placed an order and made a reservation, the concierge took the initiative to call me to confirm the check-in time and requirements and add WeChat. Since the package includes a pick-up, he was also very enthusiastic to help me get in touch. Machine related matters. From the beginning of check-in, the doorman helped to carry the luggage, and led the check-in to the room. During the period, the hotel staff would also take the initiative to say hello. It may also be due to the contrast caused by the terrible experience of staying at the R&F Ritz-Carlton in Chengdu before. Ritz-Ray’s service training is really good, and it also took the initiative to help with luggage and taxis when checking out. If you have any needs, you can also take the initiative to contact the housekeeper on WeChat, and they will help you quickly.
Lounge: Open from 14:00 pm to 20:00 pm, the light meal and cocktail time in the evening are great, the meals are different every day, and the waiters in the lounge are also very considerate. By the window, you can see Raffles City, the new landmark of Chongqing (the last picture), which just makes up for the embarrassment of not being able to see it in the room.
In short, next time you come to Chongqing, you will choose Lisirui! (To add, the scenery on a rainy day is really great)

msg:After looking at Ctrip for a long time, I decided to book this hotel. I stayed for four nights in a row. It was a wise choice. First, there is a concierge to help with luggage when arriving and leaving, and send it all the way to the front desk on the 69th floor. The service attitude made me feel the hospitality of Chongqing. Second, the receptionist at the front desk always has a smile on his face when he checks in, his voice is gentle and friendly, and all the items are clearly introduced one by one, which makes me feel like a spring breeze. Third, I made an appoin**ent for a deluxe river view twin room. The room is very large, and the decoration style is simple and refreshing with a touch of luxury that I like. The bathroom is very large, and there are frosted glass doors for the toilet and shower room. It is a very thoughtful design, so that it will not be embarrassing for someone to remember to go to the toilet when taking a shower. The bathtub is large, and it is very comfortable to take a bath. In the shower, the water is very large and the water temperature is relatively stable, and it is very refreshing to take a shower. The floor-to-ceiling glass of the room is facing the confluence of the two rivers. Whether it is day or night, the scenery is unobstructed, especially the night view, which is superb. The 1.4-meter single bed is very comfortable to sleep on, and you can turn over at will. There are a lot of cabinets, and the storage effect is great. My son and I can put our clothes in different categories, especially because there are so many hangers. I took out the T-shirts, skirts, and coats in the suitcase and hung them up. The chaise longue by the window is very good. It has been occupied by my son for the past four days. He is the happiest when he comes back from the scenic spot and lies on it to play games and watch the scenery. Fourth, the hotel is very close to various scenic spots. Hongya Cave, Jiefangbei, Baixiangju, Yangtze River Cableway, etc. are basically within walking distance, so it is very convenient to go out and play. Fifth, there is Bayi Food Street near the hotel, and the WFC where the hotel is located has several popular restaurants. It is very convenient to sleep until you wake up naturally when you are not going out to play, and then go downstairs to eat. Seventh: The flash stay booked on Ctrip is very convenient whether you check in or check out. You don't have to wait, just hand in the room card when you check out. Overall it was a pleasant stay experience. 🥰🥰

msg:Personally, I am quite satisfied with the hotel. There are three main reasons: 1. The location is good, just at Jiefangbei. As a tourist, this is very important, and it is very convenient to go anywhere; 2. The service of the hotel is very good, from the welcome From the front desk to the catering depar**ent to the guest room staff, they all showed high professionalism. I lived in many hotels of the same type, and I felt deeply about this; 3. I lived in a room with a 270-degree view. The room type is not good, but it is better Big, especially the bathroom. The best thing is that the view is very good. You can have a panoramic view of the confluence of the two rivers, the Qiansimen Bridge and the Yangtze River Bridge. If you are a young person, you can soak in the bathtub and look at the so-called infinity pool in Ting opposite. , must have a sense of accomplishment.
        Of course, there are some unsatisfactory things: 1. Since the whole building is not only a shopping center, but also an office building, and there is an Internet celebrity bar, the staff is more complicated, but the hotel needs to swipe the room card, so the security is still guaranteed; if you are young People, it's very close to the nightclub, and you can go up to the first floor in the lobby, which is fine; 2. The front desk is at 69, and any guest room needs to go to the 69th floor first, and then use the elevator to go down to your own floor; but there are two direct elevators, most of them The waiting time was not long, but it was troublesome because of smoking.
        Let me say something for the hotel. I read reviews before saying that the hotel’s breakfast is not rich enough. I personally think it’s because of the layout. It’s not compact like many hotels, but scattered everywhere, so it seems less; but the service staff is really It’s in place, and there’s life in the eyes, which many hotels can’t do; and the breakfast is on the 69th floor, full of views, and it’s delicious; the happiest thing is that there is ice cream at the entrance and exit (is it Haagen-Dazs? Forgot ), after eating, dig a spoonful and take it out, it feels like pulling wool.
       Finally, I would like to say a little regret. After staying for three nights, it would be more heartwarming if a staff member took the initiative to ask if a late check-out is required; when we left, it was raining heavily in Chongqing, although the concierge took the initiative to show us as soon as we appeared on the first floor We declined to ask if we needed help, but it was a bit regretful to see that I took two elderly people to load the luggage into the taxi in the heavy rain without taking any action.
        In general, among the many hotels I have stayed in, the quality of the staff makes me feel the most comfortable, and the money is worth it.
        Next time I go, I would still choose this one.

msg:Advantages: The location is very good, between Jiefangbei and Hongyadong. The size of the room is not small, and the high-altitude view is good. Disadvantages: The parking lot is unmanaged, many cars are parked in the passageway, no one is in sight to direct, and driving is difficult. The signage of the parking lot is the most common KT board printing, fake style, and the price has dropped to the ground. The concierge depar**ent shares the first floor with office buildings and shopping malls, which is cramped and has few service staff. The elevator is crowded, and it takes a long time to wait. From the first floor to the lobby, from the lobby to the room, various transfers to the elevator, the key guidance is not obvious, and the head is dizzy. The lobby is small, the space is low, and the decoration is simple and casual. It sounds like an Internet celebrity elegant style, which is quite low-grade, similar to an Internet celebrity coffee shop. The room space is good, the bathroom is well received, it has the same look and feel as the lobby, and the decoration and furnishings are quite low-grade. The service is good, but sometimes no one answers the call at the service center, but they arrange it quickly. The overall is very average, compared with hotels of the same grade, it is not worth the price.

The location of the hotel is very good. Opposite is the net red chopsticks building (Chongqing Art Museum), and behind it is the Jiefangbei. It takes about 5 minutes to walk to the entrance of Hongya Cave. It is surrounded by Times Square and various restaurants. It is very convenient to travel and eat.

The room type of our executive suite is very good, the living room is facing the river view, and we are lucky to see the sunset of the burning clouds. The bedding on the big bed is great, and I slept very comfortably.

The service attitude is even more commendable. From the beginning of booking, Vivian will follow up the whole process, and check in and check out quickly. The high-quality service can make you experience more value for money.

Next time I come to Chongqing, I will still choose Lisirui Hyatt!

msg:It's a very nice hotel. First of all, I would like to thank the service ambassador Echo. I am very satisfied with the stay for a few days. I recommend everyone to stay.

1. The location is near the Jiefangbei. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the scenic spots and business districts. In Chongqing, which is 40 degrees, the location is too important.
2. The IFC Center is definitely a landmark building, living on the 50th floor, with a wide view, an invincible river view, and a beautiful mood.
3. It is a relatively new hotel with very good service. Although the breakfast is not too much, there are small noodles and western food, which is suitable for families and children.
4. You get what you pay for. The downside is that there is no swimming pool and the mattress is a little hard. Others are very satisfactory.

I took a lot of photos and experienced the Internet celebrity city in depth. I will stay here again when I travel to Chongqing next time. I recommend families to travel and live.

The room service staff is also very polite and greets us proactively. The hair dryer in the room didn’t work well. They immediately brought a Dyson hair dryer from the presidential suite for us to use. They have a very high sense of service and are worthy of 5-star service. They also offered to help after leaving the store Take your luggage to the place where you are waiting for a taxi.
It is also very convenient to travel around, many attractions are nearby, and the subway is also convenient.

Personally, due to physical reasons, you must fall asleep in a very cool and quiet environment. I slept well this night in Lisirui good smell. The style of the whole room is modern and fashionable with some French styles, and the decoration is very new. The only problem: the flushing position of the washlet is too far back, which is not easy to use.

Hygiene: no

Environment: The view of the 62nd and 59th floors of the 270° river view room is really amazing. The full floor-to-ceiling glass curtain wall can clearly overlook the entire Chongqing river view. Raffles has a panoramic view. I think this river view should be the best among several hotels! Enjoy the view while bathing and showering.

Service: The housekeeper, Vivian, contacted me one day in advance to confirm my hotel needs for a second time, arranged a birthday cake for my husband according to my needs, and followed up our various problems with all my heart and responsibility, which was very considerate. Whether it's breakfast or buffet dinner, the service of the whole hotel is great, and you can feel the care for guests all the time.

Comments: 1. I hope that Hyatt can open up the membership card points system with Ctrip like InterContinental and Hilton Group, so that bookings here can also accumulate hotel points in Hyatt at the same time. 2. For a hotel at this price (you can enjoy the executive lounge service), the first time you see the Minibar, there is a charge, which is a bit pricey, and the charge table is very hidden.

The beauties at the front desk are equally professional. Sitting in the hotel room, you can have a panoramic view of Chongqing city, which is great. At the same time, there are a few suggestions: 1. The room facilities are not worthy of such a good hotel. You can buy it from a shower stall in the shower room, as shown in the picture; 2.

If it weren't for the follow-up schedule, I really want to stay for a few more days.

msg:This time I chose Lisirui among several high-altitude hotels, and the experience was good.

The hotel ambassador, Vivian, contacted me one day in advance to inquire about my room type preference and expected check-in time, and made careful arrangements.

Lisirui is located on the 58th-69th floor of WFC World Financial Center, a five-minute walk to Bayi Food Street or Hongyadong. The location is quite superior.

The hotel as a whole has a relatively retro white tone, which is in line with my aesthetics. My room is on the 63rd floor of the hotel, with 180° large floor-to-ceiling windows, facing the east, facing the Chaotianmen Wharf, but the view will not be blocked by Raffles, and I can just see the confluence of the two rivers, the Yangtze River and the Jialing River. The wharves are gathered together, and other landmarks such as Qiansimen Bridge, Hongya Cave, Chongqing Grand Theater, and Liangjiang cruise ships are all under your feet, with a panoramic view, which is very suitable for watching night scenes. Looking to the right, you can see the golden eagle of Nanshan shining in the sun. It can be said that the vision is invincible.

Besides the hotel, Lobby Boy is very responsible, helping to deliver luggage and bring it to the lobby for check-in. The elevator in the ps hotel is a little complicated. People who have no sense of direction, such as me, will feel a little dizzy. To go back to the room, you need 1-69, and then take the elevator to 58-63. The breakfast is in the restaurant on the 69th floor. There are small noodles with ice powder, which are more Chongqing-style breakfasts, and the view is quite good.

Finally thanks again Vivian.

From the 58th floor to the 69th floor, there is a concierge depar**ent in the lobby on the first floor. Take the elevator on the first floor to check in on the 69th floor. The surrounding area is centered on high-end commerce. The hotel is adjacent to Chongqing’s landmark Jiefangbei, and you can also walk to several famous scenic spots in Chongqing, such as Hongya Cave, Baixiangju, and the Yangtze River Cableway.
    Facilities: The hotel bedding and mattresses are very comfortable for sleeping, the air conditioner makes no noise, and the sound insulation is better at night. The room style is modern and stylish with a bit of elegant French style, and the decoration is very new. The bathroom is spacious and bright, the bathtub is also full of floor-to-ceiling glass, double sinks, and makeup can be done through natural light. I prefer the bathroom area, and a door is designed separately, which can be soundproof and lightproof, and has high privacy. Although the hair dryer is not a Dyson, it is less noisy and has sufficient power. The tables and chairs in the room are fully functional, and the chaise longue is large enough. There are plenty of hangers in the wardrobe. Toiletries are small. The toilet is manual.
    Environment: The 270° river view room has a good view even if it is on the 58th floor this time. The floor-to-ceiling glass curtain walls on three sides can clearly overlook the entire Chongqing river view. Raffles City, Hongya Cave, and Qiansimen Bridge are all under the window. The whole room has a good view and is transparent and bright. Because the floor is high and it is not adjacent to other buildings, the curtains can be fully opened anytime and anywhere. Because of the rain and heavy fog, although you can't see the bright night scene at night, you just saw the "Mandarin Duck Pot" in the river during the day, and you can enjoy the real state of fog in the evening and morning.
    Service: The housekeeper Vivian contacted one day in advance to confirm the needs of the hotel, and quickly responded to the request for separate re-disinfection of the bathroom and toilet. The concierge depar**ent in the lobby on the first floor is the most contacted. Every employee has a very good attitude, is polite and enthusiastic, and takes the initiative to help press the elevator every time.
    It would be better if the bathroom can prepare slippers separately. Although the breakfast has a complete range of categories, it is not rich enough. The elevator is a bit winding, and you need to get used to the elevator. Every time you enter the elevator door on the 69th floor, you have to be blown by the wind from the air outlet.

The butler service is very proactive and cares about the check-in experience. What is relatively lacking is that the room service standards are not uniform. After staying for 4 nights, the cleaning and cleaning standards of the rooms for 4 nights are different, but through feedback, even if we make improvements and make up for it. Because the hotel is on the 69th floor of the World Financial Center, it is a bit troublesome to transfer to the elevator.

The floor-to-ceiling windows of the room are much cleaner than other hotels, so the high-altitude scenery is very good.

Although there are anti-slip mats in the shower room, it is still slippery when entering and exiting, so be careful. Although breakfast is only open until ten o'clock, it is not rushing, and there is plenty of food at the last minute.

2. Living in Room 5905, the room can see the Chaotianmen Wharf, and you can have a panoramic view of the two rivers.
3. The breakfast is pretty good, both Chinese and Western styles
The bad aspects: the hygiene of the room is not in place, the carpet and the countertop have obvious stains, spots, and dust; the trash can under the washbasin has not been cleaned (no photo is taken here), and the lower corner of the shower room and yellow spots on the brick joints are obvious. The clothes are a little creepy, and it feels like it hasn't been washed for a long time; the sofa legs are a little worn out, and the back of the bed has obvious stains, which makes people feel very bad, which doesn't match such an expensive house price.

After learning that there were children, we thoughtfully prepared the children's bathrobes and accessories in advance~ and upgraded them to a deluxe river view room. In the evening, I ate a buffet on the 69th floor of the hotel. I thought it was just a good view, but I didn’t expect much from the dishes, but the taste turned out to be very good, especially the pastry was very delicious, and the barbecue was also good, and there was Chongqing red soup hot pot~ There is also a very enthusiastic Italian chef, the child's wall is cracked and he asks to book this restaurant next time (^.^(^.^)

When I went to Xiaohongshu to do my homework, I was frightened. There were a lot of negative comments, which made me tangled for a long time. In the end, the priority of the appearance of the room prevailed.
Before arriving at the hotel, the service started, and the ambassador took the initiative to add me to ask about my preferences; although the hotel does share the gate with the office building, the concierge's excellence completely offset this deficiency! There is no queue for check-in, and the process is very smooth.
The unexpected surprise is that the hotel concierge can deliver food to the room, and this should also be praised. Some luxury hotels only provide an indifferent option to go downstairs and take it yourself.
The room decoration and the view from the room window are really beautiful, even better than the pictures.
The room cleaning aunt was also very considerate and sincere. Although there was hair on the sheets, she quickly came to deal with the replacement. (No matter which hotel you stay in, you have to check it with your own eyes)
The scent of room amenities is very high-end.
The fly in the oin**ent is the breakfast taste, like the Plus version of Atour, ordinary

It’s really like the book said that you can’t see the night view and haven’t arrived in Chongqing. Thanks to the beautiful ambassador Luna for helping us to upgrade the room type standing in the room is enough to watch from early morning to sunset The most beautiful scenery in the mountain city! In the past few days, the weather was hot, and the flight was delayed. After breakfast, I took my child to a nearby hospital for nucleic acid testing. If I went back to the hotel and took a shower, it would exceed the check-out time. The very caring ambassador, Luna, helped us to postpone it. Two hours to check out, I am very grateful! I gave a small gift when I checked out. Thank you! Next time I come to beautiful Chongqing, I will definitely stay again. Highly recommended! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

msg:When staying in your hotel this time, you must give five-star praise to all the service staff, from the concierge to the hotel front desk to the restaurant service and room cleaners, all the little brothers and sisters have professional training, hospitality, and standard service. Special thanks to Butler Amy for helping me upgrade to a deluxe river view room before I checked in. It happened to be the hotel I arrived at night. As soon as I entered the room, I was amazed by the river view at night. The curtains were automatic, and I could see the two rivers through the glass. What a beautiful view! The room is also big, clean and tidy. The front desk and buffet breakfast are both on the 69th floor. Although you need to transfer to the guest room elevator, the speed is not slow at all. It will be here in a while, and it will be very fast to reach the first floor, so you can directly avoid the small worries before going. In the past few days in the mountain city, I felt the enthusiasm of Chongqing people, and it was a very pleasant journey. Looking forward to seeing each other again, I'm glad I happened to meet ❤️ Chongqing for the second time, I will definitely stay here again, and I must meet Amy, the housekeeper. When leaving, the lady at the front desk in black uniform (should be the management staff) did not forget to give a souvenir. Thanks again to all the staff of the hotel, your service is really warm! Hope to keep it up!

There are many delicious and fun around. The key is that the hotel's scenery is really good, just in time to see the mandarin duck pot in Chongqing.
The living environment is also good, clean and tidy, and the bed feels good. The hotel also gave a small gift upon check-in. The hotel has a special person to receive it. Our receptionist, Wang Defo, is very responsible and positive. I like it. The receptionist Xiao Pan was very polite and polite. The only thing is that the luggage reception of the hotel felt a little indifferent when going upstairs. Others are very good. I will choose here next time I come to Chongqing.

Room: The view is good, the sanitation is also done well, and the bathroom is relatively spacious.
Breakfast: The hotel's self-service products are average, and the salted bean curd is quite delicious.
Travel: It is very close to Jiefangbei and Food Street, and is far from the subway station, but it is convenient to take a taxi in front of the hotel.
Shopping: There is a Chongbai supermarket nearby, but the prices of specialty products inside are more expensive than those in specialty stores outside. Takeaways are available for delivery, but not in supermarkets.
Coffee Shop: There is only one Starbucks downstairs, and there are no specialty shops nearby.

Luckily, we met Miss Tracy, the thoughtful contact reminder before coming, and the thoughtful and reassuring service after coming, all made us feel good. Because it is the child's wish trip, we also specially arranged a great location for us to broaden our horizons. It's very hot outside, and you can enjoy the invincible night view of the mountain city directly from the room. It is definitely the best choice.
The facilities of the hotel are also very good. The location is really invincible. It's not a waste of time. Will choose here next time.

msg:Very unrecommended hotel, the worst Hyatt I have ever stayed in
1. The lobby is on the 69th floor, but the elevator is shared with other commercial establishments. It takes a long time to wait and is very noisy. It is not like the Interstellar Hotel at all, like a homestay
2. There is only one bar at the front desk for check in, no welcome
First, I arranged a Unicom room for the upgrade and went back to the front desk to replace it. I didn't want a Unicom room. Then I arranged a Unicom room. It was too hot and too tired. I didn't want to change. To compensate for the change of room, the breakfast the next day was very good and comfortable, but when I went back, it was still dirty and it was still there, and it was not handled at all.
3. The water is ordinary Yibao, and there is no executive lounge. The lady at the table next to the breakfast is also complaining that the Unicom room next door is very noisy at night. I changed the room twice and I don’t want to change it.
4. The two bars on the upper floors are not in the hotel, but they have to share the elevator with the tourists visiting the viewing platform. It is very crowded and noisy.
5. If you apply for a late check-out, the attitude will tell you no, you can't be scared and check out before 12 o'clock.
6. The breakfast is also very general, the room decoration is also very rough, there is no star hotel perception, there is no lobby, it is inconvenient to take a taxi

The hotel checks in upstairs, and there will be service staff downstairs to open the elevator service, all aspects are very good
The river view belonging to the first floor of the highest floor in the Jiefangbei area
The standard of the room is acceptable, the service is good, it is relatively spacious, the gym is basically complete, and the service is good
The first one to go upstairs, because there are office buildings, businesses, and bars and restaurants, so the flow of people is too large, there is no special parking place at the entrance, and it is understandable that every inch of land is expensive
The overall decoration style of the second hotel is relatively simple, and the various facilities are not top-level, but they are without merit.
The third breakfast has not so many varieties, the overall OK
If you go out, the location of this hotel is its biggest advantage, next to Jiefangbei and Hongyadong
Overall service is good
However, there is room for improvement for the brands selected by Hyatt, and I am very satisfied as a travel agent.

The river scenery in many cities imitates Shanghai, and the river scenery in Chongqing has its own characteristics and is beautiful.

In addition, the hotel is a combination of business and residence, which gives me the feeling that the a**osphere is not good with star hotels. We were going to arrive in the afternoon. We wanted to take a break when we checked in. We forgot to put up the Do Not Disturb sign, and we rang the doorbell three times in just two hours. makes me feel uncomfortable

There is a concierge on the first floor, the check-in front desk is on the 69th floor, and the first floor goes to 69th and the next floor every time. The waiting time for the elevator is long. The decor details of the rooms are anything but fancy. The hotel's breakfast is rarely anything to eat. It is worth mentioning that it is okay to see the river view from a height. The grade of the hotel can only be between comfort and high-end.
Let’s talk about Ctrip. The same is an executive room. If you can buy an executive twin room, you can pay for it, and you can’t buy an executive double bed. The unit price is higher than that of booking one night. What Ctrip has done is really ridiculous, and it is obviously bullying customers. Moreover, it was written that the double viewing platform will be sent every day for two people. I booked two nights but only sent one day of viewing. I asked the front desk, and the front desk confirmed that it was only sent for one day. I wanted to see the day scene one day and the night scene one day. Bullied again.

msg:Lisi Rui is a hotel with very distinct advantages and disadvantages. Let's talk about the advantages first, the location is good, just in the center of Jiefangbei. The floor is high, the hotel room is basically at the highest point in the city, and the surrounding scenery is unobstructed. The service attitude of the staff is very good. The disadvantage is also the location, the center of Jiefangbei, super traffic jams, and it is difficult to call a car. The entrance of the hotel and the entrance of the office building are mixed together, the staff is noisy, and it does not have the style of a five-star hotel. The hotel lobby is on the 69th floor, and there are only two elevators to reach it, and one is often repaired. The lobby on the 69th floor is either empty or one floor, not like a five-star hotel at all. In short, if the price is five or six hundred, it's okay, but I'm sorry for the price of more than one thousand.

msg:The hotel is located on top of WFC, one of Chongqing's landmarks and the highest building above sea level.
Purchased a pre-sale package and communicated with the hotel in advance before check-in. The manager was kind enough to help us upgrade to a deluxe river view room despite the recent tension in the room. The service attitude of the staff is very good, but because the previous guests checked out late, we waited in the lobby until more than three o'clock to get the room.
The floor of the room is quiet, and the space on each floor is very large, whether it is the corridor or the room, it gives a very open and a**ospheric feeling. The hotel was originally going to be listed on the Langham, so the decoration style is Langham white, and the interior is elegant and luxurious. I personally like it very much. The deluxe room is very spacious, our room is facing the Jiefangbei, and the view and landscape are great. The large floor-to-ceiling windows provide good light during the day, and the lights at night are even more gorgeous. The beds were comfortable and the bathtub was huge. The room is equipped with a capsule coffee machine, and you can drink hot coffee every day. The TV can cast the screen, but it is more complicated and there is no tutorial, so you need to call the staff to operate it. But all the service staff are very nice.
The room is gifted with tickets for the Huixian Tower Observation Deck. It is hot during the day. It should be better to watch the night view at night, but unfortunately we did not experience it due to time constraints. I also presented a cocktail experience coupon for the skybar on the 70th floor. The seats by the window to watch the night view have low consumption, and others do not. I had a good time with my friends.
Due to a rush at noon and a preference for a lunch break, guest services helped extend the delay. When checking out, I asked for a beautifully designed room card as a souvenir, and the front desk enthusiastically agreed.
All in all a great stay experience.

msg:The advantage is first of all the view. It should be the highest hotel in Chongqing. Secondly, the location is very convenient. The Jiefangbei is downstairs, and you can walk to the main attractions. The overall decoration tone is relatively calm, and the level of facilities is relatively average compared to this price. It happened that a company held a meeting and booked a room, and the experience was relatively average.

The interior is very good, simple and elegant, the dressing table is very similar to the palace, and the indoor lighting is very good

The environment of the wings club is great, there is a little episode, but it does not affect my liking
69's afternoon tea sweet dish is too bad, everything else is good
:-( The only disadvantage: I was notified that I could get points after I finished my meal at Peng Pavilion, but I had already checked out at that time, and I didn’t get the points, so I’m not happy. There are too few meals in the room! I hope it can be improved.

msg:I feel that this hotel is a rating between high-end and luxury. Let me first talk about the location of the hotel. It is located in the Jiefangbei business district. It is convenient to go anywhere, and you can take the light rail bus. The hotel is the tallest building in the Jiefangbei. It is very good to see the river view during the day and the night view at night. It happened to be a birthday during the stay. The hotel also simply arranged the room, and gave welcome fruits, birthday cakes and small gifts. It felt very good and intimate. The lady who checked in at the front desk has a very good attitude. When checking in, she helped to find a solution in time because of some minor problems with Yukang code during the epidemic. The little brother in the concierge downstairs is also very polite. He greeted each other and helped with luggage by the elevator. I think the room, experience and price can still match. After all, it is so convenient to go out for a walk and eat. The room service was very prompt, and it was confirmed every day whether the bed linen should be changed or not. I think the room hygiene is completely ok for people who are obsessed with cleanliness. I don't know if it is because of the reasons that I have explained. The only thing that feels a little troublesome is that the lobby is on the 69th floor. Every time I go back to the room or go out, I have to change an elevator, but the speed of the elevator is still very fast, and I don't feel that there is any big inconvenience. Stayed for three days and felt that overall it is recommended to stay

🚗 Transportation: Easy parking, free parking lot
🧹Hygiene: To be honest, I was surprised when I saw the reviews said that it didn’t look like a new hotel, but the visual effect before entering the room did not look like a new hotel within three years. After entering the room, it felt like a new hotel. Hygiene No problem, it's nice and clean.
🍃Environment: This is what I want to complain about. The lobby on the first floor is very messy. It is understandable. After all, it is not only the lobby of the hotel, but when we reach the lobby on the 70th floor (can't remember clearly), it is still very messy, and there is a feeling of going to a bar. , instead of a five-star hotel, where everything is messy, and it feels like everyone is running around in the hotel.
Another thing to complain about is the breakfast. There are very few varieties. I thought it was a semi-self-service. I asked the waiter, and the waiter said that all the breakfasts are here, and there is no menu to order 🤷‍♂️. Well, I personally think that there is really no way to compete with Westin in this way, except that it is high enough, there is really no advantage. In fact, I always thought that the breakfast in the Hyatt hotel should be better than the Marriott. I don't know why our breakfast was like this. The scenery is really great, I hope to continue to work hard

My daughter likes little yellow ducks so she booked this room type. I feel that the details of the children's room can be paid attention to, such as small hardware such as anti-knocking, bed enclosures and so on. These things are not expensive to purchase, but they will give the hotel a sense of attention to detail. It's not that ordinary rooms are called children's rooms if they put a little something for children to play. Overall it's pretty good, the night view outside the window is also very beautiful

I don’t know if it’s a coincidence or the staff’s care, the hotel gave Room 6221 to the hotel for the 21st birthday.

msg:The five-star hotels in Chongqing City are too scarce, especially the new ones. The thousand-yuan level is Westin. This time I saw this Lisiri decisively placing an order. I have been looking at the evaluation and said that the scenery is good, sure enough, invincible The river view overlooks other buildings in the direction facing Chaotianmen. But Jiang Jing is the one who can do it.
Originally, I went for a brand selected by Hyatt. I felt pretty good when I lived in other cities, but this time I was disappointed. Sharing in an office building makes the elevator particularly chaotic. People coming and going are very noisy. If it is not guided by one person on the first floor, I am afraid that everyone will not be able to find it. The elevator needs to be changed on the middle floor, and the speed is very slow, which is far from Nigro. There is no one at the front desk, the processing is fairly fast, just the attitude, it's very official! Your room cannot be sold, and the price has been reduced twice online. I asked you to upgrade the room. You said that there is only a charge of ➕350. I remember the tone and look in your eyes! I am 100 nights in Marriott Titanium and Hilton Diamonds. Am I going to get angry with you? Can I not afford to live? Funny! The decoration inside is simply a nigh**are, isn't this just the whole season? This decoration is too ugly! The control system is also inexplicable. Give me a connected room without a lock button, and the door is across from the bed. Who has a sense of security?
After dinner in the evening, there are girls with suspected special occupations, which is really a bad feeling. Never try this weird internet celebrity store next time, and please don’t break the Hyatt brand.

1. Awesome service! ! ! Landing in Chongqing on a cold rainy day is shivering, and as soon as I enter the lobby, I feel warm and home. When I met His Royal Highness Xin Wei, he was not only warm and hospitable, but also patiently and meticulously answered. He took the initiative to help pull the luggage by the elevator, and after going through the formalities, he could lead the way to check in. Because I didn't make many play guides before the trip, I was worried about how to arrange the itinerary for a few days. At this time, His Royal Highness Xin Wei appeared again~~~! Not only recommended fun places in Chongqing that must be punched in, but also provided daily recommended scenic spots based on my time, helping to rationally plan routes and save repeated journeys. When encountering some similar scenic spots, we can further introduce the characteristics and differences in detail. After studying the route, I felt hungry. At this time, His Highness Xin Wei appeared again~~~! According to the distance from the hotel, many restaurants are recommended, both high-quality and down-to-earth, all kinds of hot pot and snacks. Ready to go out to play and walked out of the lobby to find that it was raining. Just as he was at a loss, His Highness Xin Wei appeared again~~~ took the initiative to help borrow an umbrella in the lobby. I was warmed up again in an instant~~~ The hotel also delivered afternoon tea, because it was the plane that left at noon, so I could help pack it and eat it on the road if it was too late to eat. Finally, help to call the car and notify the guard to pay attention to the license plate and inform the driver to wait~
2. The location is awesome! ! ! Located in the core area of the city center, the transportation is very convenient. You can walk downstairs to Hongyadong, Jiefangbei, Bayi Haochi Street, Chaotianmen, Shiba Ladder, etc.
3. The room view is superb! ! ! The tallest hotel in Chongqing with superb views. The lobby and the room overlook the entire Chongqing landscape, and you can spend a lot of time in the room, taking pictures of the unique day and night scenes. Residents can also go to the top viewing platform at a discounted price.

The service, the view, and the location are all great. You can walk to Jiefangbei in one minute, which is very convenient and safe for one person to travel. One of the more memorable places is the stunning scenery from the floor-to-ceiling windows of the hotel lobby. I really like it! ! (This time I didn’t have time to experience the gym. It’s a pity. It’s said that the scenery is also very beautiful.) For Chongqing, most hotels are older, resulting in older decorations, design styles, and facilities. The difference between five-star hotels is that the design is very modern, and compared with Westin Niccolo, the advantage is that you can spend less living in a river view room. The service of the concierge on the first floor is superb, and the details are well understood. (Especially when I left the room and went to the high-speed rail station to wait for Cao Cao, the concierge guy stayed with me and waited for me to leave without telling me to put the luggage down. He waited until the car came to help me put the luggage away before leaving. This is true. It’s very heartwarming.) Next time you come to Shancheng, Lisiri is the first choice, a pleasant stay experience🥳

The most important thing is that the hotel is in the same building as the Global Center. The lobby is on the 69th floor. Because the hotel is located on a high terrain, the lobby is on the 69th floor and overlooks the entire Chongqing scenery, especially the night view is too beautiful. Don’t go to other places at all. If you wanted to stay for a day, book another five-star hotel. The second thing you see when you stay here The day went on for two more days. The only problem was that the elevator had to go to the lobby on the 69th floor and then change another elevator to your room, but it still feels ok. I can see the panoramic view of the lobby every time. There are a lot of gym equipment, but there is no swimming pool. The breakfast food is plentiful, the restaurant is excellent, and you can have breakfast while looking at the scenery. The breakfast hotel on the third day was changed to a set meal.

msg:Lisiri Hotel is in the World Financial Center. Some people say that it is the highest hotel in Chongqing. I don’t know if it is not. I feel that I am still a bit disappointed and even dissatisfied.
For example, the hotel is in this global financial center. There are office people and shopping people in this building. When entering and leaving the hotel, the gate of the World Financial Center is like a swarm. . . I wanted to enter the hotel elevator below, but I was stopped by the security staff and asked me to take another elevator. Why should I take another elevator when I stay in a hotel? Are you funny with me? It just feels messy, like a homestay hotel in an office building. It’s not like a five-star price drop. . This is the reason for the points reduction.
The hotel's processing speed is very fast. No deposit is required. After check-in, disinfection water and disposable towels are also provided. This praise.
The corridors of the hotel are beautiful. The air-conditioning and air-conditioning are also sufficient. There is automatic recognition when entering the room. The lights and curtains are automatically opened. .
It’s nice to put hotel pajamas in a bag.
Another point of disappoin**ent is because this welcome message is written Dear Li, I am obviously surnamed Wang Haha, I wrote it to the previous customer, right? That's fine s reason.
It's still a problem with the elevator. When the room goes down to the ground floor, you must first go to the hotel lobby and then down to the first floor.
The hotel staff are so indifferent. Except for a staff member who said hello to each other when they left in the last morning, the other hotel staff were busy with their own work. .
Lizrui may really have no memory other than Gao. . (Maybe because I stayed at Regent the night before, I feel that there is nothing glaring about Lisiri. Of course, the two hotels are slightly different from the actual prices. The environment and services that may be obtained will not be the same. I think this must be the first This is the last time I have come to live in Lisiri. Compared with the various goodness of Lijing the day before, I can't boast enough. It’s not bad. How many days will I come to Chongqing to live in Lijing?)

There are not many kinds of breakfast, you can eat it anyway, there are several kinds of noodles. The rice dumplings are good. Much better than the Hyatt Jiefangbei in front. Later I still considered living here, the riverside scenery is also good.

msg:The hotel is located in the core location of Chongqing Jiefangbei business district, and the surrounding area is very convenient for eating, shopping, entertainment and transportation. The Chongqing World Financial Center, where the hotel is located, is 339 meters high and is the third tallest building in Chongqing, overlooking the beautiful scenery on both sides of the river. The lobby is on the 69th floor, you need to take the elevator from the first floor, and then transfer to the guest room elevator to reach the floor where the room is located. The decoration of the rooms is stylish and elegant. The breakfast variety is relatively rich. The service is very warm and thoughtful. The fly in the oin**ent is that since the hotel and the office building share the same gate, the first floor is rather disorderly. In addition, as a luxury hotel, especially a high-altitude hotel, it is a pity that there is no swimming pool.

I went to tell me that the room type I selected was not visible at all, but the evaluation All of them are the room types I chose. As a result, another 350 was added to upgrade the room type. The service was particularly bad. I asked to clean the bathtub for a long time. I waited for half an hour and told me to go to work alone at night. Such a big hotel, working alone, suddenly found in the morning that there was a door in the room I lived in. It was really good, it turned out to be two connected rooms. The manager coordinated to deliver afternoon tea. The overall experience is that the service is too poor. The facilities are not particularly good. Many of Ctrip's evaluations are false.

The commendable director of the concierge, Xiao Xu, has a professional sense of service. He did not lose sight of returning from abroad. He saw that guests had luggage and took the initiative to dock. Every time he saw guests, he was warm and thoughtful. The last day he called for a car happened to rain heavily, and another guy braved the rain to help us. Take the luggage and send it to the car, and Xiao Xu is in the same class! commendable!

msg:The 60-story scenery is very good, and you can see the river and water. This is the main reason for choosing to live here.
The location is good, just beside the Jiefangbei, it is very convenient to buy things and eat around, and it is not far to Hongyadong, but it is troublesome to take a taxi downstairs and it takes a long walk.
The room facilities are okay, but the bathtub and bathroom are separate.
Breakfast is okay, but the quality of coffee in the lounge area next to the front desk needs to be improved.
The only negative comment is about the service attitude. The service staff on the first floor are generally very enthusiastic and polite, but some of the staff upstairs have a much worse attitude, which lowers the evaluation of the hotel management.

衞生：房間很乾凈，一點味道都沒有，一些小角落也沒有灰塵。

設施：中規中矩但是非常齊全，迷你吧、咖啡機該有的基本都有了。設備品質都還是不錯的。

環境：這個地理位置真的百裏挑一了！下樓走兩部就是解放碑，走到洪崖洞也就15分鐘。去各主要景點都很方便！

服務：下車就有人幫忙提行李到房間，全程都是微笑服務，給人非常温暖的感覺。

msg:去了那麼多地方住了那麼多酒店，這個凱悦我算是開了眼了，很少寫評價更很少給差評，但是真的服務差到讓人大跌眼鏡。大堂環境匹配得上這個價格和星級嗎？如圖二三，這麼潦草的大堂，極其壓抑，層高不夠這是硬傷。再説軟件，大堂一點生氣沒有，沒有一絲的格調和審美，大過年的，淘寶幾個紙殼摺紙就能打發？真花很貴嗎？大堂一共衹有幾把椅子，長期有各種行李和大媽大爺佔座，孩子吵鬧和各種嘈雜聲不絕於耳。看來酒店管理能力是真的有限。從禮賓到大堂接待再到前台，形象都一言難盡，不能挑選到形象氣質佳的最起碼也選些有精氣神的吧？辦入住的時候我又確定一下，問前台這個凱悦是那個凱越嗎，被前台很自豪的告知是凱悦的高端品牌，這理解水平，真的是“高”情商。第一個房間裝修氣味巨大，要求了換房，被告知還沒有房間，我們要把行李自行拿到前台，有房間了會把行李送到房間，也算是有了一點服務意識沒有影響出行。關鍵點來了，晚上四點半，突然被隔壁的説話聲吵醒，大概持續了半個小時，別人衹是在大聲聊天，不是在喊叫，為什麼隔音會這麼差？！第二天十一點半前台就打來電話問退房時間，因為晚上沒有休息好，我説兩點，前台告知要在一點半以前？怎麼，是我不知道最遲退房時間還是半夜被吵醒沒投訴讓你們有了勇氣這樣要求住客嗎？沒有全部給差評的原因就是下樓就是解放碑步行街，酒店位置好高空景色還不錯（圖一）。五星的位置和景色，三星的大堂，快捷酒店都不如的隔音和服務。

缺點：衞生衹能説勉強合格，但真的達不到五星標準，地毯臟，上面有頭髮，洗手池也不是特別乾淨，衞生間瓷磚上有污漬。
服務中規中矩吧，沒有出彩的。早餐也是中規中矩。
從旅遊地理位置的角度，推薦。但如果是想享受下豪華五星酒店，那還是別選這家了。

但是這次入住覺得整體有下降。
首先是，電梯好像比之前慢了，總感覺要等幾分鐘，不知道是不是跟春節入住率高有關。
其次是，入住兩天，有些物品並沒有供應充足，到第二天，竟然抽紙和捲紙用完，這讓我很不解🤔。
再次是化粧台竟然沒有收拾。。。前一天的紙巾和頭髮還在🤯🤯🤯

msg:選擇這個酒店，吸引我的是270°的江景，房間其實並不大，江景還行，但是，入住五個晚上，我感觸還是很深的。
1、五天房費9857元，攜程訂的時候已經付款。到店後付款房費被告知需要付款13000元，等於我又付款了3143的按金，我挺詫異，我説為什麼要押這麼多？前台答覆因為我住的時間長……嗯，住的時間長就要押的多……
2、早餐10點準時撤，所以，衹吃了一次，後面全部放棄
3、房間馬桶一直慢堵塞，五天，有兩次是直接塞死……明知道有問題建議儘早換掉或是放個馬桶塞，我們客人自己疏通！
4、居住第四天早上起床，準備穿衣服，猛一轉身看到玻璃外牆面有超人在清潔外牆，目光對視，直接社死，如果什麼都不穿，當場一定投訴……
5、有一説一，一樓前台服務生服務可以，打掃房間的阿姨也不錯。

第一，價格和尼依格羅和威斯汀差不多了，但是個人感覺上來説客房要比他們差一個梯隊（我這次三家都定了）
第二，酒店和寫字樓混用，有五六個電梯井，來回折騰，迷宮一般磨人
第三，洗浴用品的安全裝置過低，讓別有用心的人有機可乘，建議全部拆換

msg:第一接待管家服務態度很好.第二酒店乘坐電梯特別麻煩第一天懵到第四天離店.先從1樓坐到69樓.就倆電梯.需要等幾分鐘才一趟.從69又要轉坐電梯下到住宿樓層.這是我見過住過最mini的五星酒店.前台小的可憐.並沒有什麼性價比.也沒有什麼五星酒店該有的服務.衞生也一般.偶爾還有下水道反味.地漏臟.總之不會再來.

msg:23號晚上預訂的，到店後告知下午19：00還是幾點，以後就沒有行政禮遇了，為什麼預訂的時候不説明？我就為了你mini吧的幾瓶水是吧？相當於多花了錢沒體驗到應有的服務！
酒店環境大廳就那麼點面積、就像一個辦公接待廳一樣、裝潢非常一般！房間各種裝修痕跡，非常失望！
最關鍵的來了，我半夜中途出門，在等電梯的時候居然有人來光明正大的詢問*****，安全感在哪？1000+的酒店*******？住過那麼多家酒店，你讓我長見識了！
我住的五鑽酒店你家的吹風機是最難用的，拉胯的。
服務：沒任何亮點、中規中矩都談不上。禮賓還不錯吧。
除了樓層高、能看到江景、其他一切都很失望。

2. 空調無法自由調節温度，室內陰冷，洗漱間沒有垃圾桶，衹有廁所有一個，相比其他五星級酒店，房間設施簡陋得可笑；
3. 早餐是幾十年來住各種五星級酒店最差的，幾乎沒有任何高質量食材，烤麪包機都沒有，特別差；
3. 健身房器械極其陳舊，必須先去69樓申請才能去66樓使用，沒人值班，特別不方便，健身房裡的水竟然是很low的桶裝水，感覺很臟；
4. 顯然這不是一個專業的酒店，管理團隊很糟糕，即便在金融中心樓裏也掩蓋不了各方面超級差的質量。

msg:國慶中秋雙節出遊，本來還是很惴惴不安的，畢竟人趕人的，哪兒能放心得下呢？然而，節前提前了兩天，管家小姐姐Vivian就和我聯繫了。她瞭解了我的行程需求後，給出了出行建議和注意事項。入住當天，當她知道我在自己路上時，還貼心的預留好了房間。所謂萬事俱備，衹欠東風，大抵如此吧。有此管家服務，復何求也？抵達酒店後，在前台辦理入住手續，Vivian小姐姐一眼就看出來是我們，這業務素質，天花板了呀，這眼力勁兒，足以見證管理團隊培訓的給力。離店前一晚，Vivian小姐姐還貼心的為我們延了一個小時，我們得以從容不迫的收拾行李。最後值得一提的是，Vivian小姐姐業務好心思細以外，顏值也非常高。當然了，麗思瑞還有好多帥氣的小哥哥[偷笑]重慶果然是福地呀，人傑地靈，男帥女靚。[強][強]

msg:一分錢一分貨吧，雖然住的是最便宜的房間，但是酒店位置、房間佈局還有服務，都配得上一千多塊一天，住完之後感覺，訂少啦，多住兩天更好一些。
1.房間很大，不過定的兩間，一間對着走廊，一間在邊上，好在隔音不錯，靠邊的由於房間佈局，落地窗要比中間的小一些，不那麼通透。
2.房間有膠囊咖啡機，這個比較特殊，其他的都和一般五星酒店差不多。
3.大落地窗和無敵江景是很好的，可能價格更高的房間會更好
4.服務很好，前台很耐心，外賣可以送到房間，因為下雨，點了好多次外賣，小哥哥都很耐心地送過來。
5.大堂咖啡吧也有無敵江景，不用去頂樓觀景台了，前台送了飲料，不太好喝
6.地理位置絕佳（不適合開車，周圍太堵），地鐵很近，解放碑、美食街、長江索道也都很近，樓下就是筷子樓，還有大商場，離洪崖洞、來福士、魁星閣、羅漢寺都是步行可達
總體是真的不錯，很喜歡。

msg:房間不錯，服務也很好，就是前台給我感覺很不好，訂房的時候最好一天一訂，我是攜程1990一天一間的房間訂了二天，當時訂一天和訂二天都是一樣的價格1990✕2，沒有享受什麼優惠，第二天我行程有變衹住了一天，結果退房的時候前台要求補280，我不知道酒店是怎麼規定的，我要是享受了優惠怎麼補都沒有問題，但是我沒享受優惠卻叫我補費用，錢到時沒有多少但是感覺很不好，下次肯定不會在這裏住了。

msg:入住兩天重慶麗思瑞凱悦臻選酒店的體驗非常的好，促使我第一次寫了點評。
    首先，需要值得肯定的是酒店的提前服務。酒店管家Echo提前一天就電話確認對房間要求和到店時間，做好服務對接，很暖心！加了微信後，服務熱情，需求秒回，發來了酒店地理位置，並告知酒店大堂在69樓。當晚19:50入住，不一會兒Echo就詢問安排的房間是否滿意，並讓我後續有什麼問題以及對周邊有任何疑問都可隨時聯繫她。入住第二天向她打聽周邊美食，Echo給了我詳細介紹。退房的當天，Echo又詢問我是否需要延遲一點退房。總之酒店管家Echo，很好履行了管家的職責，24小時為客人提供高質量的專業服務。
    其次，一樓禮賓部的一位很年輕的小帥哥，當晚看到我東張西望找對應的電梯，馬上上前詢問，並幫我按了電梯，介紹大堂位置。九月一日早餐和晚自助餐的兩位女主管很熱情，在我的要求下，帶我去餐廳另一側看了白天和夜晚不同的風景，晚自助餐吃完後碰到另一位男主管，主動打招呼，並詢問我對餐食是否滿意。早餐因人而異，我覺得還是蠻好的。
    然後，説一下客房，房間打掃的非常乾淨，我用紙巾到處擦（不包括地面），都沒有灰塵，包括網上有人説的床靠背上面。設施和裝修也保養的很好。
    最後，酒店地理位置優越，江景一流，景觀無敵，地段一流，10分鐘內均可步行至解放碑步行街、洪崖洞。
    總之，我的這次重慶之行，碰到了服務熱情周到的管家、禮賓小哥、餐廳工作人員和認真打掃的客房保潔人員。
    希望麗思瑞凱悦臻選酒店是我來重慶的不二之選。

  房間設施普通，不夠智能，床很舒服
  此外樓下一到晚上就有一堆酒吧銷售，很煩

不足：第一、由於地處重慶cbd，周圍比較擁堵，自駕車的需要考慮車較多問題；第二、禮賓與前台的服務熱情度，還有一定提升空間；第三、也許地處美食之都，美食聚集區，早餐還是過於簡單了點。
綜合地理位置、環境衞生、服務等方面，還是值得選擇。

msg:看江景不錯，圖片就是在房間拍照的。除了硬件設施，軟服務比較欠缺。
第一次打電話諮詢的時候，等了很長時間，居然沒人接電話，第二次才打通，解釋説是佔線，頭一次聽説酒店的電話佔線。我這裡是無人接聽的聲音。入住後，床頭的電話線插錯了位置，導致免提可用、聽筒無法使用，個人認為作為五星酒店，前台電話無論是佔線還是無人接聽、房間電話聽筒無聲音，都是很嚴重的失誤。
定的行政樓層，這個酒店的行政酒廊不提供早餐，中午12點才開始提供為數不多的幾種餅乾、小點心，晚間的歡樂時光很早就結束，也沒啥可吃的。感覺是為了必須提供這個服務而應付。
最不理解的是早餐，早晨快10點鐘了吧，另外一份早餐需要打包帶回去，但是酒店衹允許打包一個整水果、一杯奶和麪包，解釋説打包其他食品，長時間不吃，會變質壞掉。無論何種食材，打包回去，孩子沒睡醒的話，可以放冰箱裏，回覆除了上述三種，其他就是不可以。
入住時還有更慘的景象：剛到酒店趕上下雨，雨還不小，這個酒店沒有汽車能開上去的遮雨廊檐區域，出租車衹能停在樓前。腦補一下：媽媽帶着孩子，冒着大雨、兩人分別從後備箱拿下出租車上兩個行李箱，為了儘量少淋雨，必須快步走上台階、到大門口，避雨。（如果一手打傘、一手拿行李箱，很不方便，所以衹能淋着雨拿箱子）。這時，才有禮賓部人員上來詢問是否入住並幫忙拿行李。
入住前會聯繫客人，加管家微信，方便有問題諮詢。有時候太早或者太晚，不好意思打擾管家，人家也應該有休息的時候，管家這點，算是加分項。
總結一下，看夜景可以住，硬件還不錯，畢竟酒店很新，至於其他軟服務，不要期望值太高。

msg:1. 入住需要等到下午五點才能進，理由是因為人太多，忙不過來

2. 隔天續住要增加按金，也不主動通知，等我刷了門卡發現不行，主動到櫃枱問才知道

3. 房間打掃過了 還有服務人員要再來打掃……難怪昨天入住時説人太多，拖到五點才能進房間

4. 淋浴間地板超級滑，就是一般的磁磚，這等級的酒店，難道不應該鋪防滑地磚？不怕住客摔倒？

酒店人員服務態度好，但《管理混亂》毀了一切，酒店掛着 凱悦 的名字，差的一塌糊塗

酒店位置景色極佳，我們入住63層，兩江交匯景觀一覽無餘。

早餐品種豐盛，中西餐及各種飲品應有盡有

愉快的入住體驗並沒有因為客滿而降低，大推介。

msg:房間特別棒，無敵江景房，我家寶寶比較敏感當天房間裏沒有任何異味，空氣也很好，挺滿意。當天寶寶生日，還幫忙佈置的房間很不錯。還贈送了蛋糕和禮物！就一點不太滿意，酒店早餐水果不太好，還有就是小朋友沒有吃早飯要求可否帶一點點心走，先是拒絕，找了經理還是拒絕，最後才通融給一點。這點一點不向大酒店的風範，我們去其他酒店都是很樂意給我們的！非常感謝客房部的佈置，我們寶寶度過了一個愉快的生日
服務：80分，因為早餐扣20

msg:有些説不好這店與凱悦關係，像是後掛的牌、主動攀親依附。在巴塞隆拿也住過凱悦臻選，但感受完全無法相提並論。不能理解凱悦為何會跟這種酒店合作。
大堂所在的樓層，電梯間一出來拐進大堂，就看到站着兩個並非工作人員的詭異男子，莫名其妙的看着你，似乎是情色業者***，但並沒有過多幹擾。忽然回想起早年在成都凱賓斯基被人尾隨進電梯並自薦業務令人大跌眼鏡毫無安全感。整體感覺不佳，應該説是一個無名單店更貼切，酒店裝修風格比較民間俗套，房間有甲醛味道，整體不入流，但房間視野好是真的。還送了頂樓天台門票，值得一看。確實可惜了這個地標樓宇，但樓內商業整體慘淡，和這酒店氣質又挺搭的。是一間給品牌減分的酒店。不推薦。
