msg:Stayed 3D2N during the Golden Week. Room was spacious and beds were comfortable. Were there for bday celebration and lovely hostess Â∞èÁî∞ÔºàXiao Tian) was very thoughtful and arranged surprise arrangement in the room for us. Another surprise cake when we got back from dinner. Kids had fun at the Children indoor water park. Breakfast variety was good. Had dinner 2 days in a row at Yiyuan Restaurant. Love the food! Hotel staff were all very helpful. 
Hotel is located right next to the Guangfulin Relic Museum. Beautiful architectures and sightseeing.
Bit of the downside - room located at ground floor, balcony is facing walking streets. Not so much of privacy. Bathroom is spacious but toilet space is a little too small. I‚Äôm a petite size but i find it crampy. But of wear and tear in the room deco and carpet could be cleaned better. 

Good experience in overall. Â∞èÁî∞ made our stay memorable. Ë∞¢Ë∞¢Â∞èÁî∞

msg:I had a very pleasant experience staying at the Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel, and I would like to especially thank the housekeeper Xiao Zhang for his excellent service. The hotel is in a prime location, close to the Guangfulin Ruins Park, and the underground parking garage has an elevator directly to the lobby on the first floor, which is very convenient. Hotel guests can enter the park directly from the small door of the hotel with their room cards, which is particularly convenient for seeing the night view of Guangfulin.

The interior environment of the hotel is simple and elegant, and the old house building is awe-inspiring with carved beams and painted rafters. The garden is quiet and pleasant, and you can see unique views at every step. The room is spacious and bright, and the decoration has a Chinese style, creating a comfortable a**osphere. The hotel staff always smiles, is gentle and kind, and can always meet the needs of guests immediately.

Overall, I am very satisfied with my stay at the Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel. Thanks again to the housekeeper Xiao Zhang and the entire hotel team for their excellent service.

The hotel environment is very good, with a view at every step, surrounded by greenery, and you can go directly to the scenic area with the room card. We visited once at night and once during the day, and felt a different Guangfulin.
The breakfast was quite rich, without any merits or faults, and there was no particularly amazing food. However, the Yiyuan restaurant in the hotel is very good, with exquisite dishes, good taste, great environment and service, and the price is not high for a restaurant hidden in the hotel.

The most considerate thing is that you can contact the butler to arrange for the front desk customer service to deliver it to the room after ordering takeout. Compared with other hotels, you have to go downstairs to get it yourself, which is really convenient! ! Praise my butler Xiao Xie, who is beautiful and professional! The design of the room itself is very regular, the view is full of green and highly comfortable, and the coffee machine, hair dryer, and toiletries are also good! There are also many types of breakfast in the hotel, and the fruits are super sweet! ! The only drawback is that the bread does not come with jam and nutella, and you have to piece it together to have iced Americano. It would be more perfect if the tableware was arranged in a set of knives and forks. It is in the Guangfulin Scenic Area itself, and the 2D1N Staycation experience score can get at least 85 points+!

Salvatore Ferragamo is used for washing and brushing, and Dyson hair dryer is configured. Soft drinks in the minibar are free. The fruit plate and snacks are delicious. By the way, there is also a good night sweet soup peach gum and white fungus soup in the evening, which is cooked in a thermos cup of Thermos, which is very warm.
I experienced the hotel's afternoon tea, Yiyuan Restaurant, and breakfast. I feel that the hotel's catering is really flawless. The first time I ate the afternoon tea Malantou ice cream, it tasted better than Matcha. The snacks in the Western set meal tasted good, and the desserts and savory snacks were just right. Yiyuan's products are also very good, and the crispy crispy chicken with sweet and spicy sauce is delicious. Breakfast is the only hotel I have stayed in so far that has a clean plate.

The whole hotel is very antique, and the garden is super large, especially suitable for taking pictures. There was a free makeup + three photo shooting event, but the film was really good after it came out, so I paid extra to buy a set meal.
The service here is very good, especially the housekeeper Xiao Liu, who is really thoughtful and meticulous. Considering the humidity on rainy days, it was specially arranged on the 2nd floor.
The room is very large, and the terrace is facing the fountain, which is very beautiful. The tomatoes in the snacks are also very sweet

msg:The overall environment is quite quiet, and it has ancient garden architectural features. I have stayed in more than one or two hotels in Songjiang. The Hilton I stayed in before was also quite distinctive. Relatively speaking, Prime Minister's Mansion has some history, so the price is a little higher than the Hilton, which is considered good among five-star hotels. However, there are still many small points that do not feel expensive this time, not just the service. First of all, the welcome gift from Prime Minister's Mansion. We checked in at 2 o'clock, but it was not delivered until 3 o'clock, and it was only after calling twice to urge. Shouldn't the welcome be ready when you arrive at the store, or at least ready and put in the room before you arrive? Is it the welcome that comes late only after someone urges you? Then the morning buffet snack dishes are not very diverse (the Hilton next door should be richer). The three-piece shower set I saw on the Internet before was Clarins, but this time I found that it was changed to another brand, but I washed my hair several times at night and it felt so dry. The conditioner didn't work, and the amount was very small, which felt petty. The toilet in the bathroom was actually designed with buttons. I had to touch and press hard to go to the toilet at night, which was completely inconvenient to use. I won‚Äôt go into details about the other details. I hope the store will work hard to improve its services and supporting facilities to be worthy of its name and price.

The lobby of the Prime Minister's Mansion is really gorgeous, well decorated, and many details are well designed. The location is very good, separated by a wall from Guangfulin, and it is very convenient for sightseeing.
Disadvantages
The service awareness is not in place. After checking in, I found that there was no tissue in the room. I made 3 calls in a row until my wife angrily complained that someone sent it, and it was sent to the wrong place.
The sound insulation is too poor, the noise in the corridor, and the loud talk in the balcony next door early in the morning are unbearable.
The facilities are old.
When the shower in the bathroom is turned on, it really scatters flowers from the sky. Flowers are everywhere in the bathroom. I dare not even open the door of the shower room. After a shower, the water floods the Jinshan.
Next time I come, I may consider staying at the Hilton üòÇ

I especially recommend the hotel's restaurant. I recommend all restaurants without distinction. It's worth visiting in the morning, noon and night. The scenery of the hotel is worth visiting in person. You won't regret itüëç

Chen Donghekuo's service team is very considerate. There are many situations when taking care of children. There were several small episodes in the middle, but they were all resolved. They can reply in seconds and deal with it immediately during the busy May Day holiday.
For this service and for the beautiful house, I will come again next time!!!

Although there were many guests in the hotel during the holiday, the hotel concierge and customer service staff were gentle and friendly, and responded promptly, making the guests feel at home. The hotel environment is good, and there are scenery everywhere. The overall stay experience was good. The yellow croaker noodles and braised pork at Yiyuan Restaurant for dinner were also delicious. The children also took turns to check in at the various parent-child activities in the cute pet park in the water play center. It was very happy! It is worth coming again if you have the chance

The whole hotel has an antique a**osphere, the room is large, and it has a large balcony. The glass railings are also very high. It is very convenient to bring a baby over one year old to check in. Very satisfied.
The service is super good. As soon as I arrived at the hotel to check in, I was given a baby bathing suit and small slippers. The brother who brought the guest also gave the baby a small car üöó, which is very loving. This hotel is a butler system. As long as you make a reservation, a butler will contact you, and the butler will respond and answer various information in a timely manner. Here I would like to give a special praise to my butler "Xiao Cheng". He contacted me before checking in and sent me very detailed information about the hotel. He also answered any questions about booking restaurants and midway in a timely manner, and was very patient.
The underground floor of the hotel is a water park and a children's park. The facilities are very good, but it is recommended that the hygiene and management of the children's park should be taken seriously. It is best to measure the body temperature of the baby entering it. Our baby got a fever after playing there once. At that time, the older children kept coughing. It was obvious that they came out to play before they recovered from the illness, which affected other babies. I hope the hotel can measure the body temperature of babies entering the water world and children's park to prevent sick babies from infecting others.
I also want to praise the hotel's breakfast here. There are more kinds of food for Xiaobao, which is richer than the breakfast of other hotels I stayed in last time. I miss the noodles in the hotel. The hot sauce is especially delicious. There are also baked sweet potatoes and dried plum cakes. There are also snacks made by the hotel. Overall, I am quite satisfied. It is worth going

The hotel is elegantly decorated, especially the lobby and check-in desk, which are representative of the facade. It feels like the boss is saying, "I am rich and tasteful, welcome to visit." The room design is simple and generous in the new Chinese style. What is special is that the door of the bathroom area can be pulled in both directions. People who are taking a bath can also look out the window and the head of the bed. The light through the bathroom wooden door also feels like a lantern, which is quite healing. The breakfast has light and seasonal dishes representing local characteristics. The staff are also polite and serious. The staff who cleaned the bottom of the pool for two days have been soaking in the water to clean it. After I consulted about the hotel, the housekeeper Xiao Wang has been helping us to improve the accommodation experience in all aspects. I will stay in the hotel again when I have time.

For the first time, I felt the appearance that is not used for "hotel", and it deserves the honorific title of "Prime Minister's Mansion". The design and layout from the lobby to the room are very comfortable. The details: such as the exquisite tea set, the porcelain tray for fruit snacks, the display cabinet for water, and the "jogging picture" worthy of praise, are so amazing!

Thanks to Wang Tian, ‚Äã‚Äãthe lobby manager of Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel, for providing us with great service from before check-in to check-out, reminding us to eat, etc., and helping us make an appoin**ent for Yiyuan Restaurant in advance. We went to eat immediately after watching the lighting ceremony. The dishes at Yiyuan are so delicious, recommended!
In short, it is especially recommended to stay for one night when you come to Guangfulin, because there are very few people going out for a walk early the next morning, so it is particularly good for photos.

The room was pretty good. After living in Anlu, I wasn‚Äôt really surprised by the houses in these ancient buildings. They were basically the same. But the interior is better than Anlu's, at least it's not as trendy and it's cleaner. The spare parts are also very useful.
The activities were okay, family cards, but not noisy. The guqin is played beautifully, but even if I play it wrong, I don‚Äôt know. Guqin always goes well with ancient buildings. It would be perfect if you can get some speakers within the hotel and drink tea on the balcony of your room.
The restaurant is delicious, but it's hard to make a reservation. You have to wait for a table on site. The price/performance ratio is pretty good, and there are also set meals available on weekends. You can also go to the afternoon tea place in the morning to make a cup of coffee and relax. The breakfast variety is average and the quality is good.
The gym is too stuffy and has no ventilation.
There are too many pillars in the parking lot, which is not friendly to female drivers.

This enriched the experience and spent a pleasant 48 hours, visiting every corner of the Prime Minister's Mansion. The adjacent Guangfulin Cultural Heritage Park and the Songjiang Campus of East China University of Political Science and Law opposite Guangfulin.
The ancient house in the middle of the hotel is noble and breathtaking. The service was great, the details were spot on, and the restaurant was great.
I particularly like Xiao Li from the front office, who is gentle, patient, polite, always smiling, and warm and helpful.
There are too many beautiful pictures to put down!

msg:The hotel is quite unique and antique. The room facilities are well maintained, but the service initiative and professionalism still need to be improved. When you enter, there are only people to guide you where to register, and there is no one to help you with your luggage. When dining in a restaurant, the tableware is set up for you to scan the QR code to order, and no one offers tea for a long time. The employees in the lobby are walking around, either looking down at their phones or looking at something else, and they don't take the initiative to say hello, ask you what you need, or introduce you to the particularly unique mansion. The whole Taiwan Paopao is worthy of praise. I ordered takeout, went downstairs and asked the front desk where the express locker was. He asked for my mobile phone number and room number, and then offered to have it delivered. Finally, he added me on WeChat, and from time to time he asked me how he was doing and introduced places to visit around him. Ask me if I want a special pillow before going to get off work, ask me if I slept well before going to work, and if I want more coffee and tea. I was waiting at the front desk, and they gave me heated mineral water, saying it was cold outside to warm my hands. If all hotel employees serve in this way, it will return to the hotel's best flowering era.

msg:Enjoy a cozy time at Songjiang Guangfulin Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel
On February 5th, a special day, I took my dear mother to the picturesque Songjiang and stayed at the famous Guangfulin Prime Minister‚Äôs Mansion Hotel. From the moment we stepped into the hotel, we were deeply impressed by the warmth and thoughtfulness.
First of all, I must praise the hotel's service staff. The vehicle attendant in front of Jinshi Jiji Mansion is not only polite, but also shows professionalism and caring for guests, making them feel at home.
Secondly, Miss Wang Tian, ‚Äã‚Äãthe front desk lobby manager, warmly welcomed us, responded to our requests, answered questions patiently, and introduced the hotel services in a clear and refreshing manner, which made us feel very at ease. They also carefully arranged for the bellman to help us carry our luggage to the room and let us have lunch in the restaurant first. In the evening, we arranged to leave a dessert of Sydney pear and white fungus soup to our old mother. The deep friendship moved us... Every detail revealed the hotel's pursuit of excellence in service quality.
Once again, our room was clean and tidy, tastefully decorated, and the scenery outside the window was pleasant and refreshing. My mother was full of praise for the comfort of the room, especially the warm and comfortable bed, which gave her a good night's sleep. Here, we seem to temporarily forget the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoy a sense of tranquility and relaxation.
Finally, the food service is also commendable. The breakfast is rich and varied, combining Chinese and Western styles to meet the needs of different tastes. The waiters always kept a smile and patiently answered all our questions. Even after learning about my mother's special dietary needs, the chef specially prepared suitable food for her. This thoughtfulness made us feel warm.
In short, this night at Guangfulin Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel was a beautiful memory during our trip. Thank you to all the hotel staff for your hard work and meticulous care. Your enthusiasm and professional service made our stay experience the best. If we have the opportunity to come to Songjiang again in the future, Guangfulin Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel will be our first choice and will be highly recommended to our relatives and friends.
Thank you again and look forward to our next encounter with Guangfulin Prime Minister‚Äôs Mansion Hotel!

The day before check-in, the housekeeper added WeChat, the room attendant Ou Ling cleaned in a timely manner, and the room supplies were replenished in a timely manner. You can swipe your card at the back door of the hotel to enter Guangfulin to avoid the crowds. The buffet breakfast is very rich, as well as freshly baked prune pancakes and freshly made glutinous rice balls. I didn‚Äôt experience the hotel restaurant this time.

msg:This must be the third time I‚Äôve stayed here.
Spare parts are Filamog
There are snacks and fruits in the room, this time it‚Äôs kumquats
Minibar is free for Ctrip orders, which is very convenient
Mainly because there are no restaurants nearby, so if you get hungry at night, you can rest your stomach.
Breakfast is very good and has many varieties

Very antique atrium and ancient house
Very suitable for taking pictures of Hanfu
There are a few cherry blossoms that have bloomed, but it rained and many petals were knocked off.
The last two times I went to the Children's Park, I saw that there were Hanfu rentals nearby. I guess there should be services for styling and shooting.
Wearing Hanfu to enjoy flowers and take photos, the buffs are stacked up, and there are fewer people in the hotel than in the scenic spot, so the experience is better. Suitable for social terror

Service is pretty good
This time I went to the hotel lobby and the manager Wang Xuan added my green software.
Some information will be prompted at the arrival point. The most convenient thing is that he told us the breakfast time.
It‚Äôs easy to forget this when staying in a hotel. Even though the front desk reminded me when I checked in, I basically forgot about it after I put my things in the room. I often call and ask again. I mistakenly remember 1030 as 1100, and I often miss breakfast. If you leave a message and forget to read it, just take a look
In addition, because it is difficult to find a room, staff will guide you every time you check in and help carry your luggage, which is also very considerate.

The hotel has a wealth of parent-child activities, including a children's playground and a handicraft workshop for children's entertainment. There was a lighting ceremony at around five o'clock in the evening. The old man watched the fun and someone introduced the history of the old house. The environment is antique, with every step of the way. There is butler service, and the whole process is followed up on WeChat. The butler Wang Kuo's service is warm and thoughtful. Children's toiletries were provided and small gifts were given to the children. A great weekend getaway.

There are two supporting hotels at the Guangfulin Ruins, facing each other across the lake, namely the Hilton and the Prime Minister's Mansion. Both hotels have direct access to the Guangfulin Ruins from the back door. It can be said that the room rate includes the tickets for the whole family.
.
I have been admiring this hotel for a long time and finally made the trip. Before checking in, the hotel will call to inquire about the arrival time and other matters. The butler will also add WeChat to facilitate communication. This is something that the neighboring Hilton cannot. I still have a Hilton Diamond card. , there was no phone call from beginning to end.
.
The housekeeper Alice Sweet was diligent and responsible during the check-in process and made proper arrangements to ensure that I had the best experience. Her warm and professional service is worthy of praise.
.
Guangfulin Prime Minister's Mansion is named after the former residence of Xia Yan, the chief minister of the Ming Dynasty. The hotel lobby is antique and bookish. This time I stayed in the 60-square-meter Yiju Suite. The room also continues the Chinese classical style design elements. It is located on the first floor of the hotel. The rooms on the upper floor will also have a larger courtyard. My room is located on the edge of the hotel, close to the water. I can watch the sunset from the room, which feels good.
.
The suite is a one-bedroom, one-living-room, one-bathroom structure. Due to area restrictions, there is no guest bathroom. The entrance corridor leads directly to the living room. There are large mirrors on both sides to expand the field of vision. There is also a shoe-changing stool on the left hand side.
.
Then there is the minibar and main bathroom, free water from Nongfu Spring, which is very sufficient and there are two large bottles, enough to make tea. There is a capsule coffee machine with 2 capsules, and soft drinks in the small refrigerator are also free. The welcome gift is a three-layered red antique box with Chinese snacks and fruits inside.
.
The living room is of a decent size, with a Chinese tea set, an external terrace, and bright lighting. The bedroom has a bedside stool and a sofa, and the mattress and bedding are quite comfortable.
.
The bathroom is smaller in size, but the layout is quite reasonable. The middle position is left for free movement. The washbasin, toilet, shower room and bathtub are lined up around it. Ferragamo supplies, toilet washlet, and Dyson hair dryer are also included. The configuration is consistent with the price. There is a semi-independent cloakroom between the bathroom and the living room. Except for the luggage rack design, which is occupied by the safe and cannot be used to store suitcases, there is nothing wrong with the entire suite, and the space is highly utilized. It's quite comfortable.

There was a lighting ceremony at 5:38, which was very creative, and there was also an explanation of the house, which was both educational and entertaining. I highly recommend this hotel and will invite friends here in the future.

The lobby manager, Wang Tian, ‚Äã‚Äãhad already contacted us one day in advance with check-in details and thoughtful reminders. The weather was cold, so we almost didn't go out and ate at the hotel, checking in and taking photos. The Ctrip booking also gave us travel photos. It felt like we had a very warm and fulfilling day. The restaurant's breakfast dishes are exquisite and rich, and there are Chinese and Japanese options for dinner, all of which are delicious.

The whole family was very happy during this trip. When spring comes, the flowers bloom, and I want to come again.

Room environment: Hygiene needs to be improved. There is a lot of dust in the room and the floor is not very clean. After pulling out the quilt, I found hair and dust pulled out together, which is a bit disgusting... The most devastating thing is taking a shower at 22:00-23:00 at night , it must be the peak period for water use. The water temperature is very unstable. At the beginning of normal washing, it turned into scalding water without any warning. I had no time to avoid it and was scalded, and then it turned directly into cold water... I was scared to take this bath. I was afraid I could get burned at any time. Fortunately, the two children had been washed early and it wasn‚Äôt the peak period... I still love the style of the room! I'm really satisfied with the fact that it has two large beds and is not expensive!

Service: Very enthusiastic and friendly. If you have any questions, you can contact the housekeeper Xiao Liu for consultation at any time. Very nice~

When entering, it is written that he was a Jinshi. The entire lobby is a mortise and tenon structure. There are also two 60 cm thick golden nanmu pillars. On the pillars are animal wood carvings from the Ming Dynasty and figure sculptures from the Qing Dynasty. They are all lifelike. With the playing of the guzheng, it feels like traveling back to ancient times. I like it very much. This kind of exquisite and simple feeling. The boss also placed a lot of antique furniture, calligraphy and paintings, which is very tasteful.
The hotel garden is an exquisite Chinese-style garden, with flowing water pavilions, turquoise flowers and birds, and it is still beautiful even in winter.
The room is very exquisite, decorated in Chinese style but not old-fashioned and tasteful, and the wood used is very comfortable. Looking at the tiles outside the house, the strings of rain curtains created by the falling drizzle have a unique charm, which is my favorite style.
In addition, the overall service staff are very warm and friendly. When checking in, there is a private butler who can add bubbles on WeChat to give reminders and help from time to time, giving guests a good VIP trea**ent experience.
A very good hotel with history, charm, service, newness and comfort. It is a hotel I would like to visit again!

The nanmu beams are magnificent and the carvings are simple. With the guzheng playing in the lobby, it is placed in it and it feels like traveling back to the ancient residence of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The artistic conception is very beautiful.
üî¥The hotel facilities are modern and high-quality, low-key and elegant. The small disadvantage is that maybe for the sake of the overall a**osphere, the lights are dim and it is impossible to work; the butler-style service is considerate and thoughtful, and the response is timely. I must thank my handsome butler Wang Kuo for this; hotel guests can hold a room card Entering Guangfulin Business District directly, it is very convenient to buy some specialties such as sponge cakes. The rich breakfast is comparable to the seafood buffet dinner. Although some of it tastes average, it is better than having it covered.
üî¥The hotel's Yiyuan restaurant has very good service. The service fee is only 8 yuan per person. It is really conscience, the taste is acceptable, and the price/performance ratio is very good.
üî¥Every staff member is smiling and greeting each other politely before leaving. I feel the high-quality service and the profound feeling that China is a land of etiquette, which is especially profound in the garden. Summary~~It is better to live in the garden than to visit the garden. It is a good place to take a break...

msg:The New Year's Eve at the Prime Minister's Mansion is really a wonderful memory. I chose the duplex suite to accommodate a whole family. The two large beds and bathrooms upstairs and downstairs are very convenient and comfortable. The elderly like it very much. The hotel environment is elegant and unique, and the mansion itself is a cultural relic, just like living in a museum. The hotel service is very good. The butler Huaizi contacted us the day before check-in to inquire about the itinerary, prepared the room in advance, and helped to book the Yiyuan dinner, which saved a lot of worry. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, the ingredients are carefully prepared, and the quality is top-notch. The hotel's swimming pool is basically a small children's splash center, with various slides and a very suitable temperature, so you can enjoy playing in the water in winter. At midnight on New Year's Eve, the sky was filled with fireworks. I stood on the balcony to enjoy them. It was so fun. I will come again next time!

The check-in experience was pretty good. Someone called me the afternoon before check-in to confirm what needs I had, and then the butler Xiao Wang added me to WeChat that night. There will be warm reminders throughout the process, and if I have any questions at any time, the butler will reply quickly.
Went to the hotel‚Äôs cute pet zoo. Thank you to the hotel for the free park ticket. I went to the cute pet paradise and fed the little rabbit. The little fox was so happy eating carrots.
Parking in the hotel is convenient and the service is very good. The lighting ceremony on 17.38 is very ceremonial. The back garden of the hotel is Guangfulin. You can swipe in and out freely with the hotel room card.
The hotel's breakfast buffet is rich and tastes good, with many varieties of cakes.
I hope to have the opportunity to stay in a loft room here.

There is a constant-temperature water park suitable for children in the hotel ~ and the water park/parent-child activity park is open until 23:00 in the evening! Let guests who have finished eating and shopping still have time to play! Ctrip booked a loft with two bedrooms and the kids loved it! There are separate bathrooms and bathing spaces on both the upper and lower floors ~ very suitable for mothers and best friends to travel with their children!
After booking the hotel, you will be assigned a dedicated butler! The young man who received me, "Huaizi", helped arrange check-in if necessary. Even the special activities that children could participate in and the "takeaway milk tea delivered to the room", which is the soul partner of mothers, were all arranged immediately.
The hotel's own breakfast is a hard-to-find Yiyuan table in the evening. It is also highly recommended for taking the elderly on weekend short trips ~ The hotel has underground (non-shelf) and above-ground parking spaces! very convenient
Overall, I am very satisfied and will recommend other friends to come.

The housekeeper Xiao He also thoughtfully sent us a gift box of fruits and snacks from the Prime Minister's Mansion, and booked a place for us in Yiyuan for dinner. At night, if you swipe your card at the hotel's small door, you can go directly to Guangfulin Scenic Area for a stroll. There are few people and beautiful lights. Breakfast the next day was also very rich. Xiaohe also sent us a special letter to tell us what scenic spots in the surrounding area are worth visiting. After we checked out at noon, the hotel still gave us a key card to enter and exit Guangfulin. We drank coffee and had a light meal in the Yichi Garden 100 meters away from the hotel. The weather was quite good, and we chatted until about 2 p.m. Go home reluctantly. It was a wonderful two days, very satisfying and happy.

msg:The overall experience of this stay: elegant environment, in-depth services, and attentive facilities.
1. Elegant environment: It may be scientifically possible to recreate the Prime Minister's Mansion that was over 500 years old from Jiangxi to Shanghai through careful calculations, but with the addition of later power distribution, tour routes, and tea tasting To make the expansion of the reading area less obtrusive, it requires high-level aesthetics. The choice of wood grain and the matching of wood and stone styles all reflect the elegance of oriental beauty; the seating in the second-floor borrowing room is spacious, and the selection of books reflects the noble taste - neither a random pile of Internet celebrity books nor a pure ancient book.
2. The service is in place: From the time of check-in, the manager, staff, cleaning lady, and restaurant waiters were dressed appropriately and had genuine smiles. There was no common behavior in other hotels, such as looking at mobile phones during working hours or turning a deaf ear to guests. Pay attention to other low-level errors. When checking in, the manager presented the dog with a beautifully designed rally toy car (the front and rear wheels are realistic and can go uphill); the children's disposable bibs presented during dinner were individually packaged; the staff also provided them during breakfast Ask if you need help in advance, and if you see that it is inconvenient to pick up the meal, the meal will be delivered to the table by default; "Just tell me what you need, you are welcome"... etc., every detail reflects the training meticulous and service-minded professionalism. In addition, we would like to thank WeChat Butler Paopao for providing us with considerate and timely help every time.
3. Careful facilities: It is the season and the wind is biting. The simulated stove in the main hall not only allows visitors to feel virtual warmth, but also plays a certain humidifying effect; the breakfast variety is not only complete and delicious, but the placement of the dining tables is also exquisite. , I believe that the vast majority of diners will not make too many round trips.
If we have to be picky, apart from dozens of praiseworthy points, the only thing that is slightly innocuous and worthy of improvement is that the teacher who introduced the Prime Minister's Office could speak a little slower. It can be expanded a little if time is controllable.
Looking forward to going there next time!

msg:Before the epidemic, I planned to stay at the Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel to celebrate my husband's birthday, but I didn't expect that the delay would be three years. I booked the room a month in advance. Xiao Huang, the hotel housekeeper, contacted me in advance and asked if I needed help. Since it was the weekend, I was worried that the restaurant reservations would be tight, so I asked her to help reserve a table in Yiyuan. On the morning of check-in, the housekeeper Xiao Huang reminded me to keep warm due to the cooling weather. He also sent me the hotel location and told me the location of the parking lot. Although Guangfulin has been to Guangfulin many times, after all, I haven‚Äôt been there in more than 3 years. The road may be unfamiliar. I originally planned to navigate to find the parking lot by myself, but now I don‚Äôt have to bother. I have to thank Xiao Huang for his carefulness. When we entered the hotel, we felt the enthusiasm of the hotel staff. They looked at me holding the cake, asked me if I needed storage in the refrigerator, and led us all the way to the room. Xiao Huang was on duty at the ancient house that day and introduced us to the history of the ancient house. Another Xiao Cai enthusiastically introduced us to the hotel environment and pointed us to the road to Guangfulin Scenic Area. I revisited Guangfulin and made an appoin**ent with my sister's family to have lunch at Yi Chi Garden. We walked around the scenic spots and watched children picking rice in the farmland and feeding sheep. We spent a restful afternoon. I went to Yiyuan for dinner in the evening. I arrived a few minutes late because I had a reservation. I was told that there were no tables. I was about to get angry and asked the housekeeper Xiao Huang. The restaurant waiter immediately told me the solution and helped us contact the restaurant Wu. Manager, a guest in the Luming Pavilion private room happened to cancel his reservation, so he took us to the private room on the second floor, celebrated our birthday, and gave us birthday noodles. After dinner, we strolled around the night view of the Prime Minister's Palace, sat on the terrace and chatted, listening to the gentle breeze rustling the shadows of the willows, and watching the roar of planes flying over the moon and setting. When we woke up the next day, the sun was shining on the terrace and we felt the a**osphere of the weekend. The breakfast room at 9 o'clock was full, so we were moved to the Yiyuan next door to sit down. We didn't mind walking a few more steps, so The variety in the restaurant is very rich. After eating, we went to Guangfulin to shop for souvenirs. Overall, the hotel's service awareness is still great. We are equipped with a butler to facilitate our requests and contact us at any time to solve problems.

The mainland children's paradise is a ticket for ‚ë† room, ‚ë† day and ‚ë†. I think there is no need to limit the guests to 2 days and 1 night. You can only choose to use it on a certain day. Even if you let customers "take advantage", let the children play on the day of check-in and let the children play again on the day of check-out. With the charges of your hotel, don‚Äôt argue with the residents~
In addition, the activities of the Book Fragrance Workshop are indeed a bit watery.
But the overall attitude of the staff is excellent.

msg:Location and transportation: In Songjiang, it is very convenient for people with cars. There is basically no traffic jam when coming from Hongqiao. The light is green all the way, so it is still very convenient.

Room facilities & services: I stayed in a loft twin room. The room was generally good, but the bed was a bit hard and it was a bit tiring to sleep on. The rest was actually fine. The snack fruit given was fresh hawthorn, which was silently thrown away. In addition, I brought an elderly person with me. When I checked in, the front desk helped to change the room and gave me a room with a round view. There was no need to wait. Thank you Huaizi for his considerate service and also helped with late check-out.

Restaurant: I had the barbecue set meal, and I also added a sukiyaki pot. For barbecue, the Xiaoqinglong is not fresh and not very good, but the lamb chops are still okay, and the other skewers are also delicious. The a la carte sukiyaki is good, and it‚Äôs good to have some hot vegetables on a cold day.

Overall, because I grabbed the coupon on November 1st, the price/performance ratio is quite good. Also because it is estimated to be just after November, and the weather is good, the room is full this weekend and there are many people. If there is no event, there will probably be a lot less people. Not bad as a weekend getaway.

msg:I visited Songjiang on the weekend and stayed at the Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel. It is located next to Guangfulin Cultural Heritage Park. The lobby is a Jinshi mansion that was originally demolished from Guixi, Jiangxi. It is said to be the former residence of Xia Yan, the chief minister of the Ming Dynasty. This is also the origin of the hotel's name.
	
The car drove into the entrance of the hotel, and the antique fragrance hit us. The door was very grand. After checking in, I took a short rest, just in time to catch up with the hotel's special project - the Lantern Ceremony of Youshi. I shared the video of the scene (see the previous note). My friend said it was very good. It feels like time travel, indeed! After the ceremony, the little beauty in ancient costume led everyone to visit the old house and gave a detailed introduction, including the architectural features, the life of the owner, and the cultural connotation... I sighed that it was a great harvest!
	
The guest room is quite spacious and has a large balcony. The courtyard downstairs is lush with trees and greenery. You can sit on the balcony to have a cup of tea in the morning and evening, watch the clouds rolling in and relax, and enjoy the ethereal autumn night. It comes with a welcome food box prepared by the hotel. , including fruits and dry snacks, I felt very good at the moment... Speaking of food, the breakfast at the Prime Minister's Mansion was also remarkable. I actually had roasted sweet potatoes and prunes and vegetable cakes, both of which were freshly baked in earthen ovens. This is special in the hotel. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen him!
	
After dinner, I took a few steps in the yard, and the scenery of early autumn suddenly came into view. The leaves had slowly turned yellow and red, but the water lilies in the vat were still in full bloom. The little beauty in front of the hall was playing sweet guzheng music. She sat in a corner and listened quietly... The Prime Minister‚Äôs Mansion is worth a visit!

Since it was a family member's birthday on the day of check-in, he helped us make a birthday decoration for the room and also gave us snacks and birthday cakes.

When I checked in, there were many services that I thought were great value for money:
1. Seeing that there were children, the front desk gave the children toiletries and slippers when checking in, which was very considerate.

2. There are many parent-child projects, and children as young as one month old will not feel bored. Even if it rains outside, there is still something to play in the hotel. (Butler Meng Zihuai also recommended parent-child activities suitable for us on WeChat)

3. A child was accidentally knocked down in the hotel and was crying. When the girl at the front desk saw it, she immediately brought a pinwheel to comfort her. It‚Äôs really heartwarming!

4. My period suddenly came at night, so I called the front desk for help, and four tablets were immediately sent to me as an emergency. Thank you so much!

1 large and 1 small water play center. Enjoy the privileges: all hotel guests can enter. You need to bring your own swimsuit, swimming cap and swimming ring to enter the water (you can buy swimming caps, swimming rings and one-size-fits-all swimsuits on site). The pool is more suitable for children to play~

Breakfast: It is the most varied and sumptuous breakfast in my memory. I feel it is no worse than some five-star breakfasts. great!

It is spacious and bright, with a reasonable layout and complete facilities. The balcony of the guest room faces east, and there is a hexagonal pavilion, creek, and koi carp downstairs. The twin beds are each 1.35 meters wide. The bedding is of excellent quality. It feels delicate and soft, clean and skin-friendly, and provides a good sleeping experience. The shower room in the bathroom is well sealed, and the handheld showerhead and tropical rainforest showerhead have sufficient water output, making bathing comfortable. The hotel's buffet breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good, which makes me full of energy every day. The food at Yiyuan's Chinese restaurant is delicious. I especially like the Xiangfu Egg Yolk Lion's Head, which is truly fat but not greasy and melts in your mouth. It is a delicacy. The proactive and attentive service of the hotel's waiters made us feel at home. This is a resort hotel that I remember fondly.

I called one day in advance to check in, and there was a butler +V who knew how to travel in advance, and provided parking and other services, and it was very good (be sure to praise my dear Xiao Li). The butler service this time can be said to be the best among all my hotels this year, which added points to this trip.
Stay in the LOFT room, which is spacious and bright. The extra-large bed is suitable for bringing a baby, and it is not crowded at all.
The minibar in the room is free for the first round and provides basic drinks (Coke, Sprite, Fanta, sparkling water, beer).
There is a bathtub on the second floor. You can take a bath. The key is that disposable bathtub bags are provided, which is quite considerate.
The hotel has a garden style and has 2 fish ponds, where you can feed the fish and enjoy the view.
The back door of the hotel leads directly to Guangfulin, and it is convenient to swipe your card in and out.
The hotel's breakfast buffet is very good, with a wide variety and acceptable quality.
The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is very cost-effective. I must praise it. I was impressed by it before I came here. I had a good experience both times (the service was lacking, maybe because the business was too good).
The hotel's children's paddling pool is a paradise for children to enjoy.

Later, I reported to the waiter that the waiter had set the elevator on the third floor, did not close it, and did not put up a roadblock reminder. The elevator door was always open but unusable, causing the other elevator next to it to never come to the third floor.
You can only walk down through the safe passage, and the door cannot be opened.
Finally, go to the second floor and take another elevator down.
Later, I reported it to the waiter, and the waiter had an indifferent attitude.

msg:To celebrate my wife's birthday, I chose this antique Guangfulin Prime Minister's Mansion after comparing many hotels.

facility:
Although the overall layout of the hotel is classical Chinese, the room facilities keep up with the trends of the times, and the bathrooms are all modern (the fully automatic toilet sensor is too sensitive, and it often misunderstands an unintentional gestureü§≠). There is a USB socket in the bedroom for convenient charging.

health:
Very good, the water cup and bathroom handles are all shiny. The waiters who clean the room by chance are also very polite.

environment:
The three-entry hotel lobby and the carved beams with more than 500 years of history are of extraordinary heritage and style (you can also go upstairs to visit). I took a lot of photos, and the details are endless and beautiful.
The interior layout design of the hotel is also surrounded by green shade, small bridges and flowing water. The room also has a small terrace courtyard with elegant landscape.
Adjacent to Guangfulin Scenic Area, it is easy to enter and exit, which is equivalent to sitting in a large garden.

Serve:
Mr. Wang, the lobby manager, learned that it was my wife's birthday on the day we checked in, so he carefully arranged the room decoration and specially arranged a birthday cake as a gift. It was so thoughtful and touching! During the meal, I also took the initiative to help contact the restaurant, and all questions were answered with my heart, and they were resolved as soon as possible. The young Manager Wang, handsome and warm, must be praised üëç.

It is worth mentioning that the breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western, with rich varieties. The service is also in place and diligent.

A very nice hotel experience. Will come again if I have the chance.

msg:I took my parents to visit Guangfulin together. I didn‚Äôt want to be in a hurry so I chose to stay in the Prime Minister‚Äôs Mansion next to it for a day. There is a door behind the hotel that leads directly to Guangfulin. You can come and go freely by swiping the room card. It is very convenient. You can take a bus early in the morning or at night when no one is there. It's time to take pictures, it's very photogenic. The hotel was renovated from an ancient house. It has an antique feel. There is a house number at the door that says Jinshi. You can go there to feel happy before the college entrance examination. When you enter the door, there is a strong aroma of golden nanmu. It smells very good. The building is also very beautiful. The whole hotel is like a Gardens in the south of the Yangtze River offer different views every time you move. I booked a two-bedroom loft room on the upper and lower floors. The price-performance ratio is good. The upstairs is quite high and it is not depressing. It has air conditioning and it feels okay and not too stuffy. Even if it is facing the lake, there are still mosquitoes at night. The hotel provides mosquito coils, but if you can Just install a screen door on the balcony door. After all, some people are not used to the smell of mosquito coils.
The hotel's breakfast is very rich, especially if you like Chinese breakfast. The variety is rich and the taste is good.
The hotel service is very considerate. There is a butler who will respond when I check in. I would like to express my special thanks to the butler "Pao Pao" for promptly answering all my questions, reminding me and informing me of hotel activitiesüëç

msg:I saw a friend staying at the Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel in the circle of friends. I didn't have any arrangements for the last few days of the National Day, so I brought my whole family and a swimming suit and collar bag to check in. All the food and accommodation for 3 days and 2 nights were completed in the hotel, and the room rate was 5,400. The meal fee is +2700, and the total consumption is more than 8000, which is indeed a holiday price. When we arrived at the hotel at 12:00, we were told that the room had not been cleaned yet. The older one and the younger one waited until 14:30 before changing us to a room that had been cleaned. Of course, I personally understand the National Day schedule. I have to complain about the swimming pool. This is the first time I encountered a five-star hotel without an adult swimming pool. I should have given the hotel a 4-star rating when I came here, but fortunately there is a butler, Xiao Li, who is almost always responsive to every request. He also takes the initiative to inform the hotel of event information. I would like to give the hotel five stars to Xiao Li!

Hygiene: very good, clean and warm, details are in place
Environment: There are views everywhere, and you are in the garden. The only regret is that the corridors do not match, and it feels a bit like a hotel. However, the flaws are not outweighed, and the environment is very good.
Service: Remarkable. Wang Tian, ‚Äã‚Äãthe lobby manager, brought me afternoon tea after I checked in and cared about every aspect. Service is provided with smiles and love.
The child will soon study here and can stay here often. Hope it continues as always. Forgot that the food was really great. Both breakfast and lunch are exquisite.

Outside the window of the terrace on the first floor is the Guangfulin Scenic Area. From the side door of the hotel, you can easily enter and exit the public areas of the scenic area with your room card. There are many options for dining and entertainment.
The hotel itself has a garden architectural style, with pavilions and pavilions. The teahouse also arranged a guzheng performance, which combined with the wooden structure style has an antique flavor.
Building 6 B1, where the hotel lobby is located, is equipped with various family and parent-child entertainment facilities, plus a pet paradise at the entrance, so there is no need to worry about children getting bored.
When checking in, the hotel will arrange one-to-one butler service via WeChat. When we stayed during the National Day, Chen Donghe and his extended service team provided corresponding services. They often sent thoughtful and useful tips, and the response speed was also very timely.
All in all, it was a very satisfying stay.

The golden nanmu in the lobby of the ancient house is filled with rosy scent. There are regular guzheng performances and lantern lighting ceremonies. Most of the activities are in the afternoon and need to be done. Good itinerary. There were more guests during the long holidays, so I had to wait for a long time for the room. The housekeeper Alice Wong (Wang Tian) actively arranged it. Thank you very much. The Mingge loft room is located on the third floor and has a good view.

What's more, since they are traveling here, who will let their children stay in the park all the time? This can be improved. The small door of the hotel leads directly to Guangfulin Cultural Heritage Park, which is similar to most ancient towns. Apart from the underwater museum, there is nothing particularly amazing. Guangfulin is opposite East China University of Political Science and Law, but you can check in at the campus. The nearby town of Thames is also nice.

On the one hand, it is the accommodation environment, which is really quiet in the bustle, and on the other hand, it is the hotel's service. From the moment we checked in, we felt what it meant to feel at home. A young man who did not leave his name in the lobby saw us holding our baby and took the initiative to help us carry our luggage to the room. In addition, I would like to give special praise to Chen Donghe's service team. The service is very good. He contacted us the day before check-in and sent us the hotel's program. After checking into the hotel, he also gave us afternoon tea and helped us make reservations for dinner in Yiyuan in the evening. After getting a seat, I specifically asked if I needed a bath bag or buckwheat pillow before going to bed. Compared with other hotels, their service is really meticulous and thoughtful. Thanks again to all the staff at the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office!

Before check-in, the housekeeper added WeChat. Chen Donghe and the service team provided good service and four-on-one service. I was really shocked. I reserved the bed rails in advance and thoughtfully helped to make a reservation for dinner in Yiyuan.
There are a lot of people everywhere during the National Day. The hotel is basically full. On the first night of stay, snacks and a mini bar are given as free gifts. The hardware is very good, including a Dyson hair dryer and a complete set of Ferragamo toiletries. The baby has his own toiletries. The air conditioning temperature in the room is also very suitable. . The children had so much fun that they missed their childhood.
The hotel breakfast, Shuiyunjian afternoon tea and Yiyuan dinner are all very good. The only complaint is that all the activities are charged, including the children's playground. It is free for the first time. Although there is a discount for hotel guests, 80 is not enough. It‚Äôs a bit expensive, I hope more thought can be given to value-added services.

I have been planting this for a long time. I seem to have seen somewhere that it is the ceiling of a parent-child hotel in Shanghai. Well... maybe my expectations are too high. It is not bad but it is still far from the ceiling.

Let‚Äôs talk about the good things first: the overall environment of the hotel is very good, with rich green plants. When the sweet-scented osmanthus is fragrant, it is very pleasant to walk around the yard. There are many fruit trees, and there is a persimmon tree hanging full of red persimmons. Look at it. It's Geely; the attitude of the service staff is very good, and the response speed is very fast; the room is quite large, and the balcony has a good view, but it's a pity that I don't have time to sit on the balcony; the complimentary check-in snacks, especially the mini ones, are very smiley Eat; the large bottle of Nongfu Spring is very practical; the bathroom basin faucet is well received and the water is very soft. I would like to know the model; the toiletries smell good; the parent-child water play center is not bad, but we are still a little too small, and older children can play Very happy, free for hotel guests.

There are also many shortcomings: the satisfaction was compromised when we checked in. It was past three o'clock when we arrived, just in time for the baby to take a nap, but the room was not finished yet and we couldn't check in. We didn't call again until almost four o'clock to urge us. The room card was sent, and the bed rails that were specially booked in advance were not installed... The bed rails were very thin and could not be fixed at all. It is strongly recommended that the hotel check and adjust themselves, in case an active baby falls due to this; The lighting design is very confusing. I can't find a slightly darker light at night. The sensor light in the corridor is a bit out of control. When it needs to be on, it goes dark for a while. When it doesn't need to be on, my eyes flicker from time to time. There is no screen window on the balcony, and the sound insulation of the bathroom is quite poor. Of...Hotel guests are charged to go to the children's park. It's the most speechless cute pet park. The ticket seller tried to trick me into buying the original price ticket, which seemed to be 98 or something. I said I was a hotel guest, and the person even argued that they were outsourced. The implication has nothing to do with the hotel. I emphasized again that I saw the hotel said the guest number was 38 yuan, so the man reluctantly said okay, let‚Äôs buy a ticket for 38 yuan... Now the Shanghai Zoo ticket is only 40 yuan.

Overall, I am satisfied. I hope I can come again when my baby is older and the experience will be better.

Admire this.

After comparing many hotels, I chose this place because it is a family hotel. I chose this place because I booked in advance. When I first arrived at the Unicorn Parent-Child Room, I was amazed by the hotel's facilities, layout and services. The first thing I want to praise is the butler Xiao Huang. I have never experienced butler-style services in the past. Before checking in, I added the butler Xiao Huang to be able to check in. Before checking in, I knew any questions about the hotel and made reservations for catering and other services in advance. They answered all my questions very enthusiastically, making it convenient for a socially anxious person like me. Thank you very much, Mr. Huang! However, there was an incident when I checked in. The guy at the front desk told me to turn left and then turn right. However, since it was my first time to check in and I didn‚Äôt know the layout of the room numbers, I took the wrong elevator and went up to the 3rd floor but couldn‚Äôt find the room. I finally went back to the front desk to look for it. Someone helps lead the way. It is recommended that the little brother explain in detail to avoid misunderstandings and misunderstandings by guests. Apart from this, the rest of the services are very satisfactory. The cleaning lady has always been very enthusiastic to help clean the room and replenish drinking water. New We will also give you welcome fruits and snacks on the first day of your stay. Thank you very much for your enthusiasm and giving your guests a perfect experience during their stay. I am particularly satisfied with the Chinese afternoon tea at Shuiyunjian. It is so delicious that I recommend everyone to try it! The daily breakfast is also rich in variety. I will choose to stay here again in the future!

There is a small door in the hotel, and you can enter Guangfulin by swiping your room card. Maybe it rains intermittently on weekends, so there are almost no people at night. It is very pleasant to take a walk to eat. Guangfulin at night has a different feeling than during the day.

msg:I was very satisfied with my stay. There were a lot of people in the hotel on weekends and the lobby was a little small, but everything from check-in to check-out was very smooth. It felt good!
First of all, I would like to thank my little housekeeper. The housekeeper Xiao Li contacted me the day before check-in because we had a baby who wanted to have a meal so that the baby could take a nap. The little housekeeper came early in the morning and made arrangements after coordination. I'm so grateful that I can sleep! If you have any questions, you can ask the butler, and most of them will be answered!
In fact, my son doesn‚Äôt like ancient buildings, but my mother does, and the Prime Minister‚Äôs Mansion is a place that perfectly combines ancient buildings with parent-child care. There is also a children‚Äôs paradise and a pet paradise. Unfortunately, it has been too cold these two days to let him try the water park. I can only come next time.
There is no problem with the hotel‚Äôs hardware, but software is king! Having stayed in so many hotels, I have never been so satisfied with a hotel‚Äôs breakfast for a long time, including freshly baked prune pancakes! There are really too many people on weekends, but the busiest time for breakfast is not very chaotic. I saw the staff quickly arranged to sit in Yiyuan, and the response was just right! In addition, I have a natural affinity for hotels with generous water supply, because drinking water is not valuable. But if it's a little more remote, it's not convenient to buy water, especially for babies who want to make milk and drink water. We were given a large bottle of water and a small bottle of water. Because we had a baby who brought a kettle, we used one bottle at once. The service staff who opened the night room after dinner refilled the water. It was a good review!
Another point is also a plus. When we checked out in the morning, there were a lot of people. Someone cut in line in front of us. Since I was not in a hurry, I let them go first. The staff saw it and gave the child a small toy. , Zaizi is very happy! Although it is a small thing, I feel that they are always paying attention to the guests!
In addition, there is a ceremony on the weekend night, which is quite ritualistic! There are also special intangible cultural heritage activities on Saturday, but it‚Äôs a pity that we went to bed, otherwise we could have played there.
By the way, the hotel is relatively quiet in the morning, which is a good time to take photos. After a heavy rain last night, lotus flowers bloomed at the door overnight. It is really a pure thought, and lotus flowers are blooming everywhere!

The hotel is designed in a small villa, Chinese style, with small bridges and flowing water. The room is also designed in Chinese style. The wooden elements are our favorite style.
As soon as we checked in, the housekeeper Bubble added WeChat full tracking service, reminding us in advance of the strategy of eating, drinking and having fun in and around the hotel.
Children like the amu*****t park in the hotel very much, because the little friends are afraid of the water, so they can't experience the paddling pool.
The breakfast is particularly rich, but contact us to avoid the morning rush hour. The housekeeper reminded me that nine o'clock is the peak hour, but because the children get up late, they can only eat at the peak hour. However, the hotel staff are super humane, and they are afraid that the children will not be full, so they take the initiative to provide package service .
In short, the experience of staying in this hotel exceeded expectations, and I will definitely come again next time I have a chance.

I decisively booked a room for 2 consecutive nights almost a month in advance. We checked in on Sunday, thinking that a hotel with more than 1,000 yuan a night should be regarded as a 5-star hotel, and we should be able to enjoy high-end services.
You can feel the caring service of the hotel from the day before your stay. The front desk of the hotel called one day in advance to inquire about the check-in time, number of people, meals, whether to participate in hotel entertainment activities and other arrangements, and also informed that there is a butler service, hoping to add the butler WeChat to enjoy more detailed services.

When we went to the handicraft room, just after the class was over, the butler communicated with the teacher. If the teacher didn‚Äôt leave in a hurry, let us play too. The teacher Li, who is kind and kind, agreed decisively, and the small class became One-on-one, this class is to use incense powder to make incense brand incense beads, which can be taken home to smell and prevent insects. The children have learned knowledge and exercised their hands-on ability. The experience is great!
At 6 o'clock is the lighting ceremony of the hotel. Everyone came to the gate of the old house and waited. Our butler Wang turned into a costumed lighting manager to perform for us. The former residence of Xia Yan, the chief assistant of the Ming Dynasty, was originally demolished and rebuilt in Guixi, Jiangxi Province. There are many beautiful embroidery works on the walls of the ancient house. , Nobility is self-evident. Guangfulin is the "root of Shanghai" and is the earliest human activity site in Shanghai. You can visit the Guangfulin site for free when you stay in the hotel. Most of the guests staying in the hotel are family tourism to increase the influence of history and culture. The scenic spot closes at 4 o'clock. If you want to play, make arrangements Good time, it takes 3-4 hours to finish all the shopping, and it takes more than 10,000 walks.
The hotel has a complete range of food and beverages, including Chinese food and Japanese food. The taste is very good. Dianping has a set menu. You need to make a reservation for the meal. You can ask the housekeeper to help you make a reservation.
There are 2 bottles of 1.5L Nongfu Spring in the room every day, 4 bottles of 500ml mineral water for free, fruit cakes, refrigerator drinks, coffee, and Kung Fu tea for free every day. At night, the butler will ask you if you need to choose a functional pillow, and you can choose from 9 kinds of pillows Choose, it's really quiet to live here, the pillows and mattresses are very comfortable, once you enter the room, you will feel calm, almost falling asleep in seconds. It is also very considerate that the check-out can be extended until 14:00.
I thought it was a high-end service, but in the end I enjoyed the top-level service. The price/performance ratio is super high. Next time I come to Shanghai, I will stay here again!

msg:Environment: The overall old-fashioned old house has a lot of charm. In the afternoon, there is a young lady playing the guzheng. It is worthy of being the prime minister's mansion. It is a bit winding like a maze... It is a style that adults like, and the children at home say they like the Hilton next door üòÇps: Underground There are many pillars in the garage, and parking is not as convenient as Hilton. The front desk of the lobby where the elevator comes up to check-in is too small, and it will be crowded if there are even a few guests.

Hygiene: Very clean, the toiletries are from Clarins, but the bathroom and shower are ordinary, there is no washlet, there seems to be a problem with the top spray, and the water splash will be crooked in one place (I live in a room on the first floor).

Facilities: Capsule coffee, mini bar, more kung fu tea sets and tea bags than the Hilton next door, and afternoon tea (but not as exquisite as expected). Is there a rocking chair in the garden on the first floor?

Service: The advantage of booking with Ctrip is that there is a butler throughout the whole process. This time, the butler Xiao Wang actively provided help throughout the whole process, and other hotel staff are also responsive, praise! I especially like the hotel's buffet breakfast. It has an old Shanghai flavor and has a lot of dishes. There are basically everything you want to eat. The freshly made rice cakes and dried plum vegetable cakes are especially delicious!

Lightning Protection: Yiyuan Chinese Restaurant. It can't be said to be unpalatable, but the dishes and taste are the same as the restaurants outside with tens of per capita. The price/performance ratio is too low.

1, We made an appoin**ent in advance for the double room on the first day, and it was a good stay for another day, and we stayed in the twin room on the second day (it feels a bit worse than the double room) see the picture
2. There is a water park and a children's playground in the parent-child area. The children had a great time playing, but they didn't go to the feeding area.
3. The ancient house of the hotel is worth admiring, which is also a factor I like. The hotel is built in Guangfulin Park, so the environment of the whole hotel is very good, and guests can go to the park to play.
4. The hotel is equipped with a dedicated butler. Our butler, Bubble, is very responsible and serves us at any time, so hotel service is also a major factor for our continued stay.

msg:How to say, the greater the expectation, the greater the disappoin**ent. Maybe during the summer vacation, even on non-working days, the room could not be checked in until nearly 3 o'clock. The smell of the toilet in the first room was relatively strong, and the children's facilities were broken. When I moved to the second room, there was filming next to it, and the door was full of facilities. There were people walking around and it was quite noisy. The most incomprehensible thing is the so-called housekeeper. Before checking in, I read other reviews about how considerate the housekeeper was and gave various suggestions without having to contact him. Our housekeeper will not contact us to provide any information unless you take the initiative to ask. This is the most annoying thing. I asked him to make a reservation for lunch and hoped to eat after 12 o'clock. However, he never received the restaurant information. The butler said that he would wait for the restaurant to call and not tell him whether the reservation was made. However, when he arrived at the restaurant, he found out that the butler and the restaurant had made a reservation for 12:30. He had to wait for the meal. It's already 1 o'clock for dinner, and the adults are already very hungry, let alone the children who are accompanying them. Of course, there are also good places, it is very close to Guangfulin, and the hotel concierge will help with luggage.

The surrounding environment is good, and the facilities in the hotel can also allow children to play for two or three days without worry. The package booked by Ctrip is very valuable. There are exquisite snack boxes every afternoon, and there are very good drinks in the refrigerator every day. I especially like their mineral water, the Nongfu Spring series, which is very beautiful. The room was big enough to sleep comfortably with a child. The children's paradise is not big, enough for children in the lower grades, and the indoor swimming pool can only be played by children, not adults. The only drawback is that I often call for a car, and the master refuses to pick up at the front desk because it is inconvenient to go in. The takeaway can only be delivered to the security booth, not the front desk. But it is said that you can ask the front desk to help you get it, and I get it myself. In addition, the butler is good. This time, due to a temporary emergency, my daughter was playing alone in the children's playground. Fortunately, the butler helped to send it back to the room. I wanted to stay for one more night, but the price given by the temporary hotel was 300 yuan higher than the price of the Ctrip package. There was no comparison and no harm. I thought it was not worthwhile, so I moved to the Hilton next door. I hope that the hotel can be flexible in the future under the premise of sufficient rooms. After all, the rooms are still idle. Wouldn‚Äôt everyone be happy with a discount for a longer stay?

msg:During the three years of the epidemic, no one has traveled much. It is June now, and the frenzied summer tourism wave has not yet started, so early and mid-June is a good time to stay in a hotel.
Some of my colleagues have stayed at this hotel before, and the reviews of this hotel on all major platforms are good, and the reservations are also very popular, so I made a decisive reservation three weeks ago.
Going out for a trip and living in a Western-style hotel, it‚Äôs not a bad idea to experience the Chinese style.
Depart from the city at noon on Saturday, with a small traffic jam, and arrive at the hotel at about 2:30 pm. The weather was hot, so I parked the car in the underground garage, and the parking space was quite sufficient.
The elevator in the garage goes directly to the lobby. Wang Tian, ‚Äã‚Äãthe butler who added WeChat at the time of booking, is already in the lobby, and I feel cordial. After checking in, we saw that we had an elderly person in a wheelchair, and the waiter took us to the room with our luggage. The two rooms are at the end of the third floor, facing west. If it is a hot afternoon, you can't go to the balcony!
The room is spacious and bright, simple and elegant, and my parents like it very much.

After check-in, the housekeeping depar**ent delivered an exquisite lunch box with three layers, including Chinese snacks, matcha-flavored macarons, and purple grapes. There are green and black teas such as Longjing, Tieguanyin, and Jinjunmei in the room. A Chinese afternoon tea is all you need! It tastes so good! I especially love the lunch box, which is said to be custom-made by the hotel in Jingdezhen.
There are complete toiletries in the bathroom, all of which are Clarins brand, which is pretty good.

Dinner was booked at the Yiyuan restaurant in the hotel. The business was so good that I was "forced" to have dinner at five o'clocküòÑ. I bought a set meal for two from a review, and added crispy duck, corn soup, vinegar jellyfish, brown sugar rice cake, etc., and it was almost enough for four people. Around six o'clock, many people had finished eating, and hurried out. After inquiring, it turned out that they were going to the gate to watch the "lighting ceremony" arranged by the hotel every Saturday night at six o'clock in the evening. strange.

Go to bed at night, the bedding feels comfortable, and sleep through the night.
I went to have breakfast at 7:30. There were not many people at this time, especially the small children, so it was more comfortable. The restaurant offers a lot of varieties, both Chinese and Western, especially congee and eggs are very suitable for me.

After dinner, go out through a small door of the hotel where the room card is swiped, and then go to the Guangfulin area. But like the hotel, most of the roads in the park are paved roads, which are very unfriendly to wheelchair users and can hardly be pushed!

Having said so many advantages of the hotel, of course some problems must be mentioned! One is the road, which has been mentioned before, so I won‚Äôt go into details here. It is suggested to build a barrier-free road aside. The second is that the gap in the shower room in the bathroom is large, the water in the shower is splashed out, the exhaust fan is not strong enough, and the floor does not dry for a long time. The third is that the edge of the washbasin is too wide, and it is more difficult for the elderly, those who are not tall, and children to wash. In addition, the ordering and serving of food in the restaurant is a little confusing and error-prone. It is recommended to provide a paper menu in moderation and confirm it with the waiter after ordering.

Of course, the flaws are not hidden, the hotel is still very good overall, especially the lobby manager of the hotel, Wang Tian, ‚Äã‚Äãwho lives up to her name, this Hunan girl always has a sweet smile on her face, and she does her best to serve the guests, which is worthy of praiseüëç!

I believe that I will continue to patronize the Prime Minister's Mansion in the futureüòÄ

During the summer vacation, I was afraid of the heat and crowded and went to Songjiang Guangfulin Prime Minister‚Äôs Mansion Hotel. It took about an hour and a half to drive to Shanghai. I was a little surprised by the hotel‚Äôs hair dryer and toiletries. In addition, there will be snacks in the afternoon, which taste very good. The hotel service is good, the butler knight is very considerate, and helped to reserve the room in advance.

The hotel's children's playground is also very thoughtful, unlike some hotels that put some building blocks and basic children's books to make up the number. Here, the children's playground has carousels, ocean balls, sand pits, castle building blocks, etc. Children who are over age have fun playing. In addition to the children's playground, there is also a children's paddling pool. Although there is no formal swimming pool for adults, it is very interesting for children to like. There is also a cute pet paradise next to the entrance. It is also very interesting for children to feed the small animals.

This group purchase also gave away a package of Guangfulin ruins. If you are an adult, you can swipe your room card to go to Guangfulin next door. It is only one door away. If the weather is not hot, you can really play here for several days.

He helped us coordinate and solve problems as soon as possible, and the hotline responded very quickly. There are many parent-child activities in the hotel in summer. We participated in the lighting of the old house, the introduction of the old house, and the learning of traditional Chinese painting. In the evening, we went to the water play center. The water is very clean and there are not many people. Both children like it very much. In addition, the buffet in the morning is very rich, our family is very satisfied, and we are willing to come again next time.

You can play for a day, and you can go directly to the garden behind to take pictures with the room card. There is also a capsule coffee machine and tea bags. If it is not creamer and a pack of milk, this coffee will be perfect. Of course, the toiletries are also in my opinion. I am particularly satisfied.

He started the process of serving us very thoughtfully and enthusiastically. First of all, I asked Han Jiannuan to ask us what special requirements we have for traveling and staying in the hotel, so that we can prepare services for us in advance, so that people have the feeling of going home before they check in. The building of the hotel is in the style of Huizhou folk houses, which is antique and makes people linger and forget to return. The special praise is that as soon as you step into the hotel, all the waiters in the hotel are very enthusiastic and proactive. When you ask for directions, you will be very enthusiastic to help, and warmly send guests to where they want to go. The housekeeper actively and enthusiastically provided different kinds of help during our stay, and tried his best to meet our various needs, so that our guests could feel at home and enjoy good services. In the evening, we had a good dinner and went back to our room to rest. We thoughtfully served fruit refreshments, said good night, and told us the time for breakfast the next day. This is a real five-star hotel with five-star service. A hotel worthy of our frequent vacations.

msg:July is the birthday month of our family, and the family of four will come on vacation together.
The Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel is a new online celebrity shop, and my wife has been talking about it, so this time I came here especially for its name.
We came here at noon on Saturday. The gate is at the entrance of Guangfulin. We told the security guard at the gate that we lived in a hotel, so we drove directly into the underground parking lot. It is relatively new and has charging piles, which is suitable for self-driving travel.
I booked the Yiju twin room. When I checked in, the two children were very excited. Li Zhuo at the front desk was very nice. He learned that we have 2 children. In order to have a better experience, he helped us upgrade the loft for free. Once we entered the room, the children were very happy. I was so happy, I directly occupied the second floor üòÑ
The room is clean and warm, with a high degree of intelligence. In addition to the cold drinks in the refrigerator, there are also afternoon tea snacks and fruits, which is very considerate.
The children's swimming pool on the first floor is free to play, and the two guys are very happy.
Dinner was eaten at Yiyuan in the hotel. The 2 adults and 2 children did not finish the meal. The dishes are exquisite and delicate, suitable for family dinners.
You must take a look at Xia Yan's old house, as shown in the picture, this is just Xia Yan's old house, made of golden nanmu, carefully crafted, the big family in ancient times is so heroic. There are two upper and lower floors in total, and the upper one is called the Happy Valley Floor, which can be walked around the venue, but it is hot in summer, and it is obvious that there is air conditioning. The lower floor is the main hall, which reflects an a**osphere, and those wood carvings are really the ultimate embodiment.
The hotel is close to Guangfulin, and I also visited it for a while. It is actually a museum, which introduces the history of Shanghai and the origin and content of the Xiaguangfulin site. The appearance is relatively new, as if it was submerged in water, but the inside is quite cool.
This weekend parent-child trip is very happy, especially Li Zhuo at the front desk, who will send just the right reminders at various times, the service is quite considerate, fully considering the user experience, like it!
Seeing this, action is worse than heartbeat, you also come to the Internet celebrity Prime Minister's Mansion to check in!

It is very convenient to enter and exit the park. It is very convenient to eat inside the hotel or in the scenic area. There is a children's playground and a children's water world on the ba*****t floor. Children have a great time playing. There is also a handicraft experience next to the playground. There is a cute pet playground at the door, so you can easily bring your baby without leaving the hotel.

KFC, Star Papa, milk tea shop, Haode Convenience, Cantonese cuisine, Japanese cuisine and farmhouse cuisine are optional, and there are few tourists in the morning and evening.
        The most worth seeing is the old house carved with golden nanmu, which was relocated from the original flavor of Jiangxi. Guests can appreciate it carefully, and the air is filled with woody fragrance, which has endless aftertaste. It's a pity that there is only one day a week for lighting activities at night, and I haven't been able to appreciate the charm of it.
        The hotel software is also good, the service is standardized, the staff are polite, and they greet people when they meet, which is quite like everyone.

After check-in, @@ÊûóÂÆ¢ÂÆ∂ will also take the initiative to provide suggestions and services for the guests.
        The disadvantage is that there are too many mosquitoes outside, and mosquitoes will sneak in if you are not careful. Of course, there are objective reasons for the surrounding greenery and sultry weather, but the hotel should also have anti-mosquito measures.

After discussing with my family, I booked my father Check in. The actual experience really exceeded expectations. This year's Father's Day just happened to be in Shanghai, and thunderstorms and strong winds were double-yellow warnings. I was worried about the safety of my old parents. I called the hotel and added the WeChat account of the housekeeper Li Zhuo. Lived a lot. But such caring staff is the real plus. From our proposal of whether there is a room for the elderly to rest, to the follow-up introduction of the hotel and its surroundings, Li Zhuo's housekeeper made proper arrangements, which far exceeded expectations. Also asked if it was safe to return after checking out. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve written a small essay, and this trip to satisfy my family is worth writing about haha. One more thing, the hotel's breakfast products are also good. For leisure and vacation, food is the soul.

When I checked in, I was told that my room had been upgraded for free. It was originally a twin room, but it was upgraded to the white moonlight in my heart - a double-story loft room! There are two floors up and down, the first and second floors have super big beds and their own bathrooms, a family of three üë™ can sleep comfortably! I was also fortunate to participate in the lighting ceremony at 18:08. My baby listened carefully to the history of the Prime Minister's Mansion told by the cultural officer. The scent of golden nanmu makes people feel calm. There are also cute pet parks, children's parks and indoor paddling pools to play in. It is a parent-child hotel suitable for walking children.
The best thing is the service. Every employee will greet us warmlyüôã, especially Mr. Wang Kuo, the one-on-one housekeeper. We are very touched by the thoughtful and considerate service!

The service is really nothing to say, this is the first time that the hotel called in advance to ask about the needs. Helped arrange a baby cot in advance (which was lovely), a suite upgrade and a late checkout.
The whole process of butler service is considerate everywhere, and our butler Xiao Wang deserves applause.
The breakfast room is very rich, and the stewed beef brisket with radish in the hot dish area is absolutely amazing.
If you really want to be picky, the Japanese food at the Xi restaurant for dinner is not very amazing, and you will not be disappointed if you lower your expectations. If I had known that Xixi was a breakfast restaurant, I would have eaten elsewhereü§≠

The housekeeper, knight, was very patient. He helped us make a reservation for the restaurant and proposed that the reservation was canceled and re-booked due to changes in the plan. By the way, the hotel's food and beverages are also very good.
Children's Paradise and Cute Pet Paradise are the children's favorites. When we went there, only one baby in our family turned the audience hahahaha
You can go in directly from the hotel, the scenery is very good and the key is that there are few people

msg:First conclusion: a hotel suitable for group incubation of young dolls under the second grade

Aunt Yang, who cleans the room, has a good attitude, and Xinxin, the housekeeper, handles the needs quickly and quickly. You can buy suburban parents and children when housing prices are low.

[Room] The area is large enough, and the balcony is a plus. However, the interior furniture and furnishings are not good enough, and the large space is wasted without reasonable planning and use.
[Support] Clarins Clarins Clarins Clarins, praise. Toothbrush toothpaste for kids is Sunstar.
[Service] needs to be unified and strengthened. Different people asking the same question at different times may get different answers.
[Fun] The water park is small, and there is no charge for residents, so you can have a little fun. The children's playground charges an extra 80, which is considered expensive, so I didn't go. It is slightly above the average line of parent-child parks in general hotels, but the only advantage is wiped out by extra charges*.
[Dining] Chinese restaurants are popular, but considering the location of Songjiang, they are quite expensive. The Japanese restaurant is slightly watery, just in the breakfast place.

Finally, focus on breakfast and service. As a resort hotel in the suburbs, there is no epidemic bonus. The staff guard the door and charge one centimeter more for strict height measurement. This is the first time I have seen such a strict SOP in a hotel, measuring height - charge - allowed to enter. Understand the starting point of this cost control, but it is too embarrassing. Key point: There are no five-star products, and the face depends on the face. really embarrassed

First of all, I would like to thank my housekeeper, Xiao Ren, for his two-day service, from helping us with our luggage, to Carefully and considerately reminded us of the precautions, reminded us that we can also help to order dinner, the notification of the hotel's special lighting ceremony, and the cute pet park ticket for the baby, full of love, I want to introduce him grandly, really He feels like home, and he will agree to any unreasonable request I make. Awesome!
The environment is also a major selling point of the Prime Minister's Mansion. The first choice is in the scenic spot. The small gate of the hotel is the commercial area, and the hotel exit is connected to another gate of the scenic spot. Then there is the hotel's own environment, which is very antique, with pavilions, pavilions, carved beams and painted columns. The lobby of the ancient house moved from Jiangxi is the most eye-catching.

The hotel's rooms are very powerful, well-designed and reasonable, whether it is dry and wet separation or drinking tea on the terrace, it is very comfortable. There are also fogged glass and automatic curtains, full of sense of technology. The spare parts are all from Clarins, the brand I use every day, and the children have spare parts and toothbrushes from the little prince. It is a caring parent-child hotel, and he has done it.
The hotel also has a cute pet park, a water park, and a children's park. Although my housekeeper is very good and basically applied for experience coupons for me, I complained about the management of the children's park. I went to the children's park as soon as I entered the hotel and asked me to buy a ticket. , I bought it, and then we went to the Children's Paradise from noon to night, but we didn't see anyone checking the tickets, so what's the point of buying tickets? Guests who have not bought a ticket can come in at noon or evening. This makes it embarrassing for us to buy tickets in the morning.

Hotel features: There are only two good hotels around Guangfulin, Prime Minister's Mansion and Hilton. The Prime Minister's Mansion is more distinctive, with real ancient houses implanted, and modern facilities to ensure the quality of accommodation. The breakfast is also richer in terms of food and beverages. Personal experience is cost-effective higher.
Hotel location: Very convenient. There is parking in the ba*****t (free for guests). The scenic area is located in the back door and it is a dining area. There are many options for dinner. It is very convenient to open the door and go out anytime, anywhere.
Room & facilities: The room is large in size, with a balcony, a bath, a water-absorbing area suitable for children, a spa suitable for adults, a chess and card room, and a table tennis room; in terms of activities, there will be a lighting ceremony performance + an ancient house around 6 p.m. Explanation, not long worth watching!
Service: There is a housekeeper who has a very good WeChat service, and will take the initiative to check the room situation and ask me if I want to delay check-out until 2 o'clock. I try my best to consider the customer! The snack and fruit plate delivered in the afternoon is delicious. For dinner, we had a good meal in Yiyuan in the hotel, but the back kitchen had no time to cook it. There were many people who made reservations and it was a bit late. Personally, I suggest that you go to the restaurant in the scenic area at the back door of the hotel to eat; The breakfast on the second day was very rich, and it could catch up with the formal buffet 5-star dinner! There is also a pastry shop in the scenic area, which is very good and worth buying a box of.
Generally speaking, it is a good hotel for family and friends to come again!

The room is also very large and spacious. It is very comfortable to see the view through the window.

The most satisfactory thing is the hotel service. This time, the hotel housekeeper Wang Kuo received the whole process, and the service is very good. The waiter is also kind and lovely, helping to draw the curtains and order liquid mosquito coils. I have always felt that the hardware of Chinese hotels is five-star, but the service is always unsatisfactory. But in the prime minister's mansion, I felt the long-lost five-star service of international standards, which made people really feel the comfort of guests first.

The ingredients for the hotel's breakfast are also fresh. The amaranth and wild rice that I ate this morning are very tender.

It is a very happy thing to play Guangfulin and stay in the prime minister's mansion for one night. You can enter and exit Guangfulin scenic spot at will by swiping the hotel room card, which is simple and convenient.

At night, you can swipe the hotel room card to enter and exit the Guangfulin Ruins Park. The small gate is located in the dining area, and walking forward is the Zhiye Temple. It has a special flavor after the lights are turned on at night.
P.S. The hotel uses Dyson hair dryers and Clarins toiletries.

msg:I originally booked a hotel in Suzhou, but due to the shortage of May 1st train tickets, I temporarily changed my itinerary and decided to stay at the Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel. The experience of two days and one night made me feel very worthwhile. The environment of the hotel is very good. The lobby of the Huizhou-style building, the Soviet-style garden, and the warm and modern rooms are perfectly combined. The balcony with a view allows people who want to escape from the city to enjoy a peaceful and comfortable place here. The hotel service is also commendable, the patient reception and explanation at the front desk, everything will be thought of for you, every service staff encountered is kind and polite, even if there is only one big bag, they will mention the room for you, now many hotels It has been difficult to do. The hotel is located in Guangfulin Scenic Area. One advantage is that you can swipe your card to enter the scenic spot. It is very convenient. Although I have been to Guangfulin in the past, this is the first time I have experienced the night view. It is very beautiful~
Finally, I would like to thank the hotel. Due to my carelessness, I forgot the data charging cable and potion in the room. After communicating with the hotel, the hotel immediately sent it for me and received it the next day. Thank you!

After walking for about 10 minutes (accompanied by 2 elderly people walking slowly), we arrived at the Guangfulin site, which is great. When I checked in in the afternoon, I went in the wrong direction. The intern Gu Xinyu helped my dad while showing the way. When he learned that the three of us were going to check in at 3 p.m., he directed us to rest in the lobby and brought us 3 bottles of water . When I checked in and got my room card, the housekeeper Wang Kuo immediately took my backpack. The warm and thoughtful service made my parents feel like they had returned to their own home. The breakfast on the second day is rich in variety, from Chinese food to Western food. Yiyuan's dinner is also worth recommending. The three of us ordered 4 dishes, and we finished every dish without wasting a bit. The fish soup with mustard greens is light, which is very suitable for the elderly. The river prawns are springy and fresh. The duck is delicious, and the spinach is also fried well.

Special thanks to the hotel staff Mr. "Li Jiuling". The child had a fever in the middle of the night. I thank him for running errands to buy medicine for me in the early morning. Thank you very much! The child was able to reduce the fever immediately after taking the medicine. I am really grateful for his help! The leader must look over and make a contribution! The hotel can also prepare some first aid supplies such as ice stickers.
The only dissatisfaction is that we took the baby out of the car at the gate, and did not go to the ba*****t to park and drop off the passengers. At the gate of the old house, I asked the waiter if he could help with the luggage. The young lady replied that I could not, and went to the underground garage! We asked about the luggage trolley and she said no. Later we found the trolley by ourselves. After checking in, the little brother was also very enthusiastic about delivering the luggage service. The lady at the door, you are going to remelting training, service industry, the gate is the first to enter ! Don't show off to the guests, we're here to play! Not here to find fault! Anyway, a small episode, does not affect the children's fun, I will still recommend it to everyone! Seek truth from facts!

I actually ate the same smoked fish, king oyster mushroom beef cubes, and 4 types of porridge, as well as freshly made plum cakes and glutinous rice balls.

It can be said that in terms of customer service, we have given a high evaluation to the Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel, and we have agreed with friends and family to continue to patronize next time. I have to say that it is very educational to bring children to visit Guangfulin. We can enter Guangfulin directly from the back door of the hotel.

Otherwise, you need to buy another ticket if you participate alone. There is also a Hanfu rental of 80 for three hours, which can also be experienced. In addition, the location is very convenient inside Guangfulin. In the afternoon, a box of snacks was also delivered. The buffet breakfast is also very rich in content.

msg:The environment of the hotel is great, with beautiful scenery everywhere. Before check-in, the butler Xinxin contacted me to understand the requirements for the room type. After reading some hotel room type maps, I chose the room type on the first floor with river view. The butler carefully arranged and upgraded the room type, which made me live in it. I like it s room. After check-in, the butler provides warm service throughout the whole process, helping to arrange delivery of takeaway medicines to the room, and warmly reminding us of the next day's breakfast time at night. When you meet the service staff in the hotel, you will greet the guests. Since I checked in on Sunday, the underground parking garage was full. I went around the parking garage a few times. A busy service worker saw it and immediately stopped what he was doing and helped me find a seat back and forth in the parking garage. The details feel very warm!
Insufficient: At 4:30 in the afternoon, the catering depar**ent called to confirm the evening meal time and the set meal. Entered the restaurant at 6:30 as scheduled, the waiter introduced the seat, poured tea, and waited a while to serve the main course-pepper chicken soup pot, the process operation is not bad. But the follow-up dishes have not been served for a long time, and I am a little confused. Is there no food? I asked the waiter and said that there are appetizers, sushi and desserts. I estimated that I waited 20 minutes for the appetizer, another 20 minutes for the dessert, and then the sushi... I asked the waiter why I had to wait so long since I had already made an appoin**ent, and the waiter would just say sorry and hurry up! Leaving aside the fact that you should be prepared when you make a reservation for a restaurant, let‚Äôs talk about the quality of five-star hotels. Does the meal have to be served according to the order? Otherwise, why do you need appetizers, main courses, and desserts? It's not a small restaurant, you can eat whatever you want. I feel that the restaurant is obviously understaffed. The tableware and leftovers after the guests' meals are all piled up on the table. No one has cleaned them up for an hour and a half after the meal. The soy sauce and condiments are all empty and no one adds them. This is the only shortcoming of the hotel, unfortunately, I hope that the quality of the food and beverage depar**ent can be improved quickly!
In addition, I hope the road signs of the hotel can be clearer. At night, the lights are dim and the sight line is not good. Although I went shopping in the afternoon and know the layout of the hotel, I still go the wrong way and get confused!

msg:I didn't go out of Shanghai during the Chinese New Year, so I chose the Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel. The exterior of the building is an antique building, but inside it has the facilities of a five-star hotel, which is unexpected. During the Spring Festival, there is a lot of passenger traffic, but the hotel's services are not discounted because of the large number of people. Before traveling, call to inquire about the needs. After arriving, show the room now, and check in when you are satisfied. The hotel is in Guangfulin Scenic Area, and you can enter the scenic area by swiping the room card. The advantage is that when the scenic area closes sooner or later, you can avoid the flow of people and enjoy the scenery to your heart's content.
In the hotel, whether it is check-in or the aunt who cleans in the corridor, everyone greets politely with a smile on their faces, and will try their best to meet any reasonable requests. The capsule coffee in the room is finished, and I want another one. Immediately Gave me one.
I ordered a two-bedroom room. There are bathrooms upstairs and downstairs, which is very convenient. The only downside is that the upstairs is a smart toilet, but the downstairs is not. It is a bit cold in winter, and the temperature of the upper and lower floors is a bit difficult. It's a bit stuffy.
I think the breakfast is pretty good, there are quite a lot of things, and I want to eat, and my parents like it very much, but when there are many people, I have to go early, and I don‚Äôt get a seat at the door, so I have to go in and find a seat by myself.
B1 has a children's playground and a water play center, suitable for younger children to play, and there are Hanfu borrowers next to it. Unfortunately, there is no swimming pool for adults.
The hotel feels very good, and I want to go again when the spring is warm and the flowers are blooming.

This is a hotel with beautiful scenery such as small bridges, flowing water, pavilions, ancient roads, sunsets, and starry sky that you want. It is a postcard if you take a photo. Friends who love to take pictures, this is definitely a place for you to check in The place.
However, because of the ancient architectural style, there are many thresholds, stone roads, and rockery shrubs, it is not recommended for infants and young children. It is more suitable for families with students who have a basic understanding of knowledge and art appreciation and are curious about knowledge. top choice üôÇ
Friendly reminder, the other rooms are perfect, but it is not recommended to check in the loft room in severe winter. When the temperature on the first floor is suitable, the temperature on the second floor is a bit high. It is completely OK in other seasons, just for your referenceü§ûüèª

All the extra charges for the facilities are not included, except for the cleaning of the room. The staff of the children's play pool look like they owe a lot of money. Why do you ask three questions? During the peak meal time in the morning, there is no one to show you a seat, and you can't find a seat to sit. Ask the staff with a blank face and can't help. With a child, I finally found a seat for two, and asked the service staff to help me get another chair next to it. Several staff members in the restaurant pretended not to hear, and just didn‚Äôt step on you. The service is so poor that it is impossible to imagine that this is a hotel in Shanghai. The staff of Yiyuan Chinese Restaurant are also very confused. Because of the 4 small and 3 large positions, we insisted on going to the private room. We told the lobby that there is also a place because we said that children can't eat that much. This kind of hard sell is really unbearable. The environment is beautiful and the facilities are good, please train the service, otherwise no one will live here.

Hotel guests can also take the special passage of the hotel to directly lead to Guangfulin.
When I checked in, Xinxin at the front desk gave me a deep impression. Her speech was gentle and gentle, and she was also very polite and kind to the guests. After arranging the room, the little brother took the initiative to help with the luggage, which really made people feel at home. After arriving at the room, wow, I opened the balcony door and faced the evening sun. The scenery outside the window was so beautiful that I couldn't help but sit on the balcony for a long time, enjoying this moment of tranquility.
I took a night tour of Guangfulin at night. When I returned to the room, I saw that the turndown bed was made and the garbage was sorted out. I also saw the kind message and good night greeting from the housekeeping depar**ent. It was so considerate.
Compared with the Peace Hotel where I stayed on New Year's Day, the Prime Minister's Mansion really satisfies me. The air conditioner in the room is also suitable, not too stuffy. The bathroom products are all from Clarins. After washing, the bathroom hardware is also very delicate and hygienic, my son
After a beautiful bath, everyone slept soundly that night.
Because I was too anxious to check in the previous night, I went upstairs from the garage and didn‚Äôt have time to visit the hotel lobby. After breakfast the next day, I went to the hotel lobby and walked around. I heard the sound of the guzheng. Ah, the embroidered murals complement the decoration.

Right ‚û°Ô∏è walk to the iconic underwater museum very quickly, with different feelings during the day and night.
Hotel Highlights:
The lobby was moved directly from Jiangxi and the younger brother Jinshifu. The wood is very fragrant and the book is very classical. At night, there are people playing the zither. It feels very peaceful and peaceful when sitting. Passing through the lobby and bypassing the bridge corridor is the front desk, and the next The room is actually a modern style mixed with some ancient rhyme, taking the ancient style route, the hotel is basically a garden landscape
Room Facilities:
The room is the most general, but it has a small balcony. After checking in, it will take you to the room and give a brief introduction. The price of the minibar is very close to the people. You can make tea and coffee in the room, which are free. Children's birthday It is even more simple to arrange balloons üéà, and send cakes and gifts [gifts]
swimming pool:
There is no adult swimming pool, only the warm water children's wading pool, children are reluctant to come up, adults can sit next to it, it is a bit stuffy inside, if there are many people, it may be noisy
Children's Paradise: It's not big, but it's enough for children to play. There is a sofa at the door for waiting and resting
There is also a scholarly workshop next to the children's playground. There are manual activities, but no experience.
There is also a Hanfu rental next to it. The children and the elderly are not interested, so they give up. It is not bad to see someone change the Hanfu to take pictures in this garden hotel.
Cute Pet Paradise: There are a lot of animals, carrots are not cheap, if it is not a ticket for the room, it is a bit tricky to buy it alone
breakfast:
The breakfast is really average, but you can eat enough, and the dining environment is good.

Maybe it's because of staggered check-in, there are not many people, the experience is very good, the service is very good, you can also ask the front desk for fish feed, children are very happy to feed a fish, but in fact, the hotel is not big and there are not many service staff , you will not be able to make it during peak hours, and it may appear crowded

I heard that I was here for my honeymoon and helped me to contact me for a room upgrade. It was my first time to be upgraded, too. liked. The upgrade from a normal double room to a suite, as well as the room layout, is simply too careful. There were also snacks and small gifts. Full of sincerity.
Then let's talk about the advantages of this hotel. I bought it from a Ctrip group, so I think the price is 1588 for a one-night double room and a sukiyaki dinner. The hotel is very close to Guangfulin. There is a small door to go out to the main entrance of Guangfulin. The whole hotel has an antique style and is almost integrated with Guangfulin.
The toiletries in the room are all from Clarins, the home is smart, and even the toilet will greet you.
The whole hotel has blue tiles and white walls, but a large amount of glass is used instead of the walls. The oil corridor in the whole room is very transparent and bright. The two sides of the room are floor-to-ceiling glass, and the scenery is really beautiful. Especially at night when the lights are on, it has a transparent beauty.
The details of the hotel are also very elegant. It is a good experience to sit in the lobby or walk in the hotel late at night. There is an obvious golden nanmu fragrance in the lobby. There is a lot of ingenuity in places big and small. An ordinary corner can make you clearly feel that you have spent your time. The hotel staff are very welcoming. We will greet you when you pass by üôã.
The bedding in the room is also very comfortable, I slept soundly and recovered quickly. The breakfast buffet in the morning is also very good, there are many Chinese food, go back full after eating, and don't have to eat lunch. Anyway, will come again next time. Very satisfied this time.

msg:Environment: The hotel is located in Guangfulin Scenic Area, and it is very convenient to enter the scenic spot. I thought that there were not many people when I checked in on weekdays, but there were actually many people in the hotel and the scenic spot, and the business was very good. The flow of people on weekdays is still very comfortable. There is a restaurant "Yiyuan" in the hotel. The per capita consumption is about 200 yuan. The price is a bit expensive, but the quality of the dishes is on par with Mingge. Yiyuan‚Äôs occupancy rate is also around 90% on weekdays, and business must be very good on weekends, so you must make an appoin**ent in advance. The hotel's buffet breakfast is also eaten in Yiyuan and a Japanese restaurant. Because of the layout, I thought there were not many choices. In fact, the layout is very compact, and all kinds of food can be eaten, and the taste is good, and it is very comfortable to eat. Some dishes in the buffet breakfast may be a bit repetitive from Heyi Garden's main meals. For example, I wanted to order BBQ pork crisps the night before, but I couldn't eat it, so I saw it in the buffet breakfast the next day, hahaha . When eating at Yiyuan, you can order some meals, and some snacks can be eaten in the buffet breakfast.

Facilities: The hotel is an ancient house with carved dragons and paintings, which is very charming. The bottom of one building is only used as the hotel lobby, and the whole floor above is reserved for guests to read books and enjoy tea (free). The hotel itself is the building, so taking pictures in the hotel is also good. Because I was traveling with 3 adults, I was very satisfied with the Hanfu experience in the package. There are many sets of Hanfu to choose from in the hotel's Hanfu experience, and the quality of Hanfu is very good and very beautiful. I can wear it to take pictures in Guangfulin, and I am very satisfied.

Hygiene: The hotel is definitely cleaned to a high standard. However, because it is a garden hotel, it is understandable that there will be some flying insects and thin ash in the open-air facilities/1st floor facilities of the hotel.

Service: The service attitude is warm and very satisfactory. I originally booked a large bed (no extra bed) and wanted 3 adults to stay. The hotel staff said that the double bed (no extra bed) was more comfortable and offered to change rooms. In fact, this is true. The bed in the hotel's twin room is quite comfortable for 2 standard-sized adults.

msg:As a well-known Internet celebrity hotel, after 3 days and 2 nights of stay experience, I feel that it is really affordable in terms of hardware and environment, because it has a unique Xiangfu mansion and a unique geographical location. Compared with such superior hardware facilities, the hotel's management service is a soft underbelly, as evidenced by this. Example 1: The check-in procedure was slow. At around 2:30 p.m., the check-in guests, check-out guests, waiters, etc. were crowded in the small space at the front desk, and the first impression was uncomfortable. In fact, there is a space inside the main station where you can rest, but no one tells and guides you; Example 2: The breakfast restaurant is obviously crowded during peak hours. In fact, guests can wait at the door and be led by the waiter to ensure the meal. The space is orderly and not noisy; the above two should be suggestions for hotel managers!
Because the hotel has not been open for a long time, the training of service staff still needs to be improved. The service staff are warm and friendly, but sometimes they don't know what to do!
During this stay, it coincided with the birthday of the child. Although the hotel responded slowly, it still provided warm service: a room for celebrating the birthday was arranged, and a birthday cake and small gifts were given! Special thanks to the store's sincerity! I hope that the quality of hotel services will be improved day by day, and I hope to experience it again next time!

The wood carvings in the ancient house in the lobby are very good, but unfortunately I can't understand it very well. It is perfect if someone introduces it on the side. It is also very convenient to go to Guangfulin. It is completely unexpected to be able to take a close-up photo of the night scene of Guangfulin. After checking in, someone took us to the door of the room. Not long after that, someone from the cleaning depar**ent came to deliver 2 bottles of water and asked if they wanted to help us make the floor mats in the bathroom. When we came back from dinner, we found that there was a bowl of washed and plastic wrap in the room. Jujube (very sweet). The room was clean as a whole, but the exhaust fan in the bathroom on the second floor was turned off accidentally, and there was a strange smell in the sewer in the morning. There is dirt on the headboard door on the first floor (I only saw it when I woke up in the morning, and the pillow had been covered before). There are fingerprints on the glass on the second floor and on the balcony glass on the first floor. Really can't pick out any faults. The hotel facilities are quite aimed at younger children, with a children's playground and a paddling pool. It is disappointing that there is no adult swimming pool. The pool and ping pong rooms are also big and clean. (Unfortunately not üì∑).

The restaurant is a little crowded, it is better to book a box in advance next time.
Due to the epidemic and renovations, the swimming pool is not open, and the spa environment is not bad.
The biggest disadvantage is the poor sound insulation of the room, children running around in the corridor, parents reprimanding, and someone next door drinking too much and talking hard at night without sleeping, which affects the rest.

I asked them why they didn‚Äôt inform or check before checking in, and they came to check again The manager said that I should not adjust the water temperature drastically when I take a shower by myself! How can a normal person adjust the water temperature to a temperature that can be rinsed, who would adjust the water temperature at will? Also significantly adjusted? Did you think we never took a shower? ? With a room fee of more than 3,000, can't you even guarantee the basic bathing equipment?

Remind parents who live in a loft room with their children to pay attention to the temperature of the bath water, so as not to cause similar problems again, but it is best to stay away

The price of the Chinese restaurant for dinner is ok. We ordered a set meal of 298 yuan. The taste is average, and it is not happy to go out to find something to eat on a hot day.

msg:I have been wandering between the Prime Minister's Mansion in Guangfulin and Hilton, although Hilton is cheaper and more famous. Later, I saw the comments that the Prime Minister's House service is better. So here it is.
Sure enough, the comments are still there. The overall service level of the Prime Minister's Mansion is very good and responsive. Yiyuan's dishes are outstanding, and they basically don't step on thunder. The hardware of the hotel is also very good and very distinctive. The children's playground water center has opened, and the children are very happy. Although the water in the pool is shallow, adults still have to watch it. If the water slides are not stable, there is a possibility of choking on the water (I saw a child being pulled out of the water by an adult with my own eyes). Some parents keep looking at their phones over there, and I really sweat for the safety of these children. The hotel staff are very responsible. When there are many people in the pool, there will be four or five staff members looking after them at different positions. It is recommended that children still need more parental care. Drowning is a matter of seconds. No amount of staff can look after all the children.
I like to drink tea and read books on the second floor of the ancient house. Books can be borrowed, but unfortunately I didn't finish it because of the short stay. Next time you have the opportunity to stay longer.

The breakfast is good and the quality is very good. There are playgrounds, children's playgrounds, and children's paddling pools. Service is acceptable. Besides, it's not good. It's newly renovated, and the room decoration still smells. All drinks in the refrigerator are charged, all children's playgrounds are charged, and the paddling pool is said to be free. There is no corner around the corner, and it is said that children can enter, but adults are not recommended to enter the pool. But the swimming pool anti-skid mat, the security guard did not have either. Adults do not worry about entering the pool everywhere. Understandable, but no one cares about entering the water without a swimsuit and cap. There is a fee for everything, and it's a lot of money to make. What's even more intolerable is that when I wake up in the morning, there are blood stains on the sheets, it must not be mine! Since I have slept all night and can't speak clearly, I have no entanglement. It's just uncomfortable! Hope the hotel self-monitors.

msg:When the epidemic just turned, I saw the hotel's promotions, so I quickly started to book a room at the end of June. After reading everyone's comments in advance, I am still very uneasy. After 2 nights of experience, I would like to summarize my own feelings for the reference of those who follow:
-1. Transportation: Self-driving, the hotel has its own parking garage, which is very convenient.
-2. The overall environment of the hotel: The hotel is very new, and it is on the edge of Guangfulin, which has a unique environment. To travel to Guangfulin, it is a 5-minute walk from the hotel.

The whole hotel garden design, antique. The door of the hotel is very distinctive. After entering, I feel that I have traveled to ancient times. The tall gates show the majesty of the prime minister's mansion, and experience the so-called ancient gates.
It's just that the lobby for check-in is a little small. When there are more children, the whole a**osphere becomes very noisy. This needs to be improved by the hotel. But I'm a layman, and I don't know how to arrange it properly. Anyway, the lobby is really a bit small compared to other hotels.
The double-tree room is quite large, and the overall hygiene is also good. Maybe the ecology is too good. The sound of frogs at night is so loud that people can't sleep. They can only sigh, people are not as good as frogs!

-3. Hotel catering: I must praise the hotel's breakfast. There are not many varieties, but the quality is good and the taste is good, except that the skin of the dumplings is a little thick.
The hotel's Chinese restaurant, Yiyuan, tastes good, but the price is not high.
You can order takeout, or you can drive to the nearby Impression City for a meal, which is very convenient.

-4. Parent-child aspect: Although the hotel has parent-child attributes, it is simple to provide a parent-child paradise. Especially the cute pet park, which is very small, no child does not like to feed pets, so it can be expanded a little and add some animals. I have to say that the lamb in the cute pet paradise is too smart. As soon as it sees someone, it makes a noise, asking for attention and feeding. It makes people think that if you don't feed it, it will jump out immediately.

Reminder: There is a nucleic acid test point next to the hotel, which is very convenient.
In short, if it is a pure family vacation, it is not suitable, but if you are taking a tour of Guangfulin and want to take a break on the way, it is still highly recommended.

The room is very clean, the facilities are flawless, the hair dryer can be better. It's the first time I saw such a long handwritten letter üòÇ I'm attentive. I had a lot of fun overall.

Service: The waiters are very friendly and responsive. Takeout will be delivered to the room by hotel staff.

msg:First of all, let's talk about this room type, which is especially suitable for traveling with children and the elderly. It feels more than the 55 square meters described, at least we 4 adults and 1 child did not feel crowded. The room comes with 3 breakfasts, and you can add one more when you have breakfast. The point I want to complain the most is that you have to go through the lobby to eat, there are steps and the door of the ancient house is slightly small, it is very inconvenient to push a cart in and out. The Chinese restaurant is very cost-effective and highly recommended. There is a small door at the back that leads directly to Guangfulin, which is very convenient. However, it is too hot to give up every time I go out... 40 degrees is afraid of heat stroke. Net red soft cake is worth buying, it's really delicious~

We ordered takeout several times. Because the takeout could not enter the hotel, it could only be delivered to the garden gate. It was Xiao Shen who personally helped us pick up the goods and deliver them to the room in the hot weather. , this service is first class, thank you very much. The Guangfulin next to it is also worth taking children to visit and study, and it is worth coming again.

The hotel rooms are also good, there is a capsule coffee machine, and the welcome fruit is lychee, but the drinks in the refrigerator are charged, this idea is a bit interesting, the cost of drinks is compared with this price, the hotel marketing strategy is not my guess. The afternoon tea environment is good, the Chinese dim sum is slightly worse, and the overall value for money. I ordered the Luming Pavilion and did not explain it to the first floor, and I didn't have time to read the public comments, but I lost face, which is a bit regrettable. The breakfast was good, and overall it is recommended.

msg:There was some hesitation between Hilton and the Prime Minister's Mansion. The price of the Prime Minister's Mansion will be a little higher than that of Hilton, but Hilton has lived a lot and wanted to change to Chinese style. After all, in Guangfulin, Chinese style is more flavorful. Before the epidemic, the Prime Minister's Mansion The price is very high, but it has dropped after the epidemic. I bought a package from Ctrip, which is very cost-effective. 1388 is +300 for weekend stay, and the price is also increased for two months during the summer vacation, so come and experience it during the summer vacation. This package includes the mini bar There are also many snacks for free drinks, two breakfasts + an extra breakfast. If you want to add more, the price is moderate 128 per person, and children over 1.4 meters are half price, which is reasonable~ When we went there, dine-in was just open, but only for hotel guests. , this is very good, after all this epidemic, there is no place to eat outside, unless it is take-out to the hotel, the main food for breakfast is set meal, you can choose ABC for you, fast speed, good taste, you can eat everything you want, fruit The drinks and salads are all self-service, the fruit is good, and the milk may be room temperature milk, so I don't like the taste very much. I recommend Yiyuan for dinner. Compared with another open Luming Pavilion, Yiyuan is much more cost-effective and has a very good environment. It is recommended for guests to dine in. We ordered grass prawns, stir-fried pork with tempeh, sauce pork buns, and mung bean cakes. None of them stepped on the thunder. .

Speaking of service, all aspects are in place, the front desk checkin and checkout is fast, there is no cumbersome procedure, the explanation is very clear, the training is in place, the room is very like, the double bed is also big, the bed is comfortable, but the pillow is too low, There are both showers and bathtubs. For the bathtub, you can ask the front desk for a disposable bath bag. It is quite convenient. The bathroom is well separated from wet and dry. It will be very eye-catching, and the room service is responsive, basically it can solve our problems well. TV channels are a little less, HBO has none, it is suggested to improve. The hotel does not have a swimming pool, and the only children's water play center is still under renovation. The weather is hot. If the epidemic situation improves, I hope the water play center and spa can be opened one after another. The hotel also has a cute pet paradise. Our package includes a family voucher. Go in and feed the small animals, there is a free carrot for children, ponies, lambs, rabbits, ducks, it is very fun, and the place is not big.

The entire hotel is next to Guangfulin, which is easy to access. There was originally a small door leading to Guangfulin in the hotel, but unfortunately it was closed during the epidemic, otherwise it would be more convenient. We visited Guangfulin for two consecutive days, carefully. It's quite big to go shopping, and I bought the Yexie soft cake I was thinking about. I like the decoration style of the hotel very much. It is very Chinese. The highlight is in the lobby of the ancient house of the hotel. It is said that the logs were transported from Jiangxi. When I walked into the lobby, there was a smell of wood, and I saw a group of children brought teachers to visit. The underground garage is very spacious, with a direct access to the hotel lobby, with obvious signs, and there is a table tennis room below, you can contact the waiter to make a reservation.

msg:The hotel that has been planting grass for a long time finally pulled the grass in the days when they could not stay in Shanghai. The Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel is located next to the garden, accompanied by the river, and you can visit famous historical and cultural attractions such as Zhiye Temple, Sanyuan Palace, Chen Zilong Memorial Hall, Guandi Temple, Ming and Qing Street, Time Tunnel, Guangfulin Museum and so on. The lobby is a Jinshi and Difu that was demolished from Guixi, Jiangxi Province. It has a history of more than 500 years. It is said to be the former residence of Xia Yan, the first assistant of the Ming Dynasty, so it is named "Prime Minister's Hotel".
The process of breaking into the hotel is like visiting a museum. First of all, you will be attracted by the grandeur of the high-ceilinged foyer, with exquisite details in the quaint a**osphere. The jinshi and the first gate represent the glorious imperial examinations in ancient times. Behind the gate are brick carvings of clouds and clouds, which are paired with "the mountain is in the west, the air is fresh, and the east is in the east." Can not help but respect the ancients.
Step into it, there is nothing in it. The lobby has a large area of two floors, and as far as the eye can see, the vertical columns and horizontal beams make a sound of this huge space. It is said that the ancient house in the lobby is composed of 65 golden nanmu, tip wood and fir, which is naturally elegant and fragrant, low-key and luxurious.
Step out of the Prime Minister's Mansion and walk into the inner courtyard of the hotel, which is also comparable to a small garden. The landscape corridor, one step at a time; the elegant depth reveals a classical appearance, and the millennium charm is fully displayed. There are also a variety of green plants planted in the courtyard, and the interest of the Soviet-style garden can be seen everywhere. Now, it is also a good place to take a stroll after dinner~

msg:After being closed for two months by the epidemic, this hotel is definitely the best choice for you who want to temporarily escape the depression of the city center and feel the rich history and culture while relaxing! üçÉEnvironment: The design and historical background of the hotel are definitely a highlight. It is difficult to find such a beautifully designed and antique Chinese-style hotel in downtown Shanghai. I learned that it was the original demolition of a famous literati ancient house in Jiangxi, and the design of the entire guest room was also integrated with the ancient house. If you come by car, you will miss the shock of the ancient house. Be sure to park your car and walk out of the main gate to re-enter to experience it! There is also a tea house on the stairs on both sides of the lobby, take pictures and punch cards, or stop for a cup of tea to read a book, and feel the history and mystery by your side. The surrounding environment can actually make you stay a few more nights. Guangfulin&#39;s indoor halls are not open due to the epidemic, and I hope to have the opportunity to visit next time. In the nearby streets of Cangcheng, the cafes are very fashionable, but the villages are extremely simple and even a little lonely, but it does not hinder your purpose of escaping the hustle and bustle of the city. Sheshan Happy Valley is not far away, when the epidemic situation and the weather are suitable, it will be next time! üîîService: The service is something I didn&#39;t expect. As a hotel that is not a chain international brand, I was a little worried before I came. But from the guide when entering the hotel, check-in is very professional. In particular, Chen Xudong, the deputy lobby manager of the front office, changed my room twice after I suggested that the room was facing a bit too dark, which made me a little embarrassed. The only fly in the oin**ent of the hotel is that some rooms have poor orientation or lighting, probably because they need to meet the overall design requirements. I have never written so much text, and I have attached some photos. I hope that the industries that are greatly affected during the epidemic can hold on, and come back next time!

Taking the children for their birthday, the reception manager Shi Dongdong thoughtfully upgraded the room type, with very cartoon children&#39;s arrangements and a full set of baby toiletries. Knowing that it was the child&#39;s birthday, they also gave a birthday cake! Although you can&#39;t dine in, delivering food to the hotel is another experience. It&#39;s a pity that the children&#39;s water absorption center is being renovated and upgraded, and the children&#39;s paradise is very luxurious and worth playing. When the epidemic is over, I will definitely bring the children again. Wait

The housekeeper Chen Xudong was very caring for the Ultraman parent-child room. He was afraid that the floor of the tent would be too hard for children to sleep in, so he specially prepared a thick quilt. During the period, he always cared about our various needs and was very satisfied with a parent-child trip.

There is a small gate in the hotel and the park, and you can enter and exit by swiping your card. During the post-epidemic period, many restaurants in the park did not open, but KFC, Starbucks, CoCo, and small supermarkets all opened. Few people, sightseeing is very comfortable.

       When I traveled to Europe before, I stayed in several hotels converted from ancient houses: the large garden house built in 1760 in Venice, the exquisite wooden house built in 1800 by the canal in Amsterdam, and the one built in 1800 near Oxford University. The majestic manor in 995, etc., is a great favorite every time. Now, there are also ancient houses in Shanghai to live in, and finally you can no longer be envious! üëç

It was the former residence of Xia Yan, the first assistant of the Ming Dynasty, 500 years ago, so it was named "Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel". ‚Äã‚ÄãEvery old object in the lobby carries the past.

msg:1) On the premise of three mentions of putting a crib, the baby was about to sleep that night and found out that it was not put at all.
2) Babies and old people drink a lot of milk and tea. When they asked for water for the second time, they were told "you will be charged if you ask for more water." I regretted that I gave a tip of 100 when I introduced the room.
3) The management of breakfast is very chaotic when there are many people. You have to queue up to get your coffee, and the breakfast is not delicious (personal experience).
4) There is only an indoor hot pool for children to play in. It is very small. If adults do not enter the water and accompany them, they will suffer from heat stroke. There are no towels in the dressing room, and they have to be taken at the front desk of the pool, which is inconvenient.
5) The cleaning of the room was very messy, because everyone took their children to check out late, and the time for the housekeeping was very tight. If it was cleaned, it was equal to not cleaned, and I was very angry.
6) I told the hotel in advance to arrange our two rooms closer, but it didn't happen at all. My parents got lost twice because they were old.
In general, I can feel that the hotel really wants to do a good job in the service. The attitude may be there, but the ability has not kept up.

msg:The long-awaited two-day one-night trip to the Prime Minister's Mansion in Guangfulin is over! Before I came here, I read a lot of online reviews. The most popular one is the hotel's service, and the other is the hotel's breakfast. I'll tell you my personal experience this time.
We arrived at the hotel around 12 o'clock. As soon as you arrive, you are attracted by the strong historical a**osphere of the hotel. As soon as we got off the car, a waiter helped us with our luggage, introduced the hotel very warmly, and then led us to the hotel lobby, and distributed children's toiletries to the children. This made me feel differently about the hotel services reviewed online. Because the hotel's regular check-in is until 3 o'clock in the afternoon, but we came early, so the front desk allowed us to take a temporary card to Guangfulin to go shopping, and call us when the room is cleaned up. It is really convenient to go from the hotel to the scenic spot, as long as you cross the Suzaku Bridge from the back garden, you can reach the scenic spot. The key is that it used to be a food street, with a lot of food. We happened to have lunch there. As soon as we finished eating, the front desk called and told us that the room was ready. I looked at it for half an hour at most! This is still pretty good. After we got the room, the waiter took us to the room. Along the way, the layout of the hotel was also introduced. This hotel has three buildings, the main building is the sixth building, and then the seventh and eighth are connected to the main building by the corridor. In addition to the elevator in the main building, the other two buildings do not have elevators. You can also choose to take the stairs to go downstairs, otherwise you have to go around to the sixth building to go down. It's okay for young people to take the stairs, but it is really inconvenient for the elderly. This is the shortcoming of the whole hotel layout.
I stayed in a two-bedroom suite. When I first entered the room, I thought they had given the wrong room. I only saw a bed, but no stairs. After walking a little further, I found that there was a TV behind the wall. One staircase leads to the second floor. I think this room is suitable for a family. Both beds are large. The kids ran up and down happily. But I want to complain about the toilet downstairs, this toilet is not intelligent, and the one upstairs is intelligent. I don't understand why it is arranged like this! Since it is a five-star hotel, can't you even buy a few more smart toilets? There is also the bathroom upstairs to take a shower at night, the water pressure is obviously not good, the water is very small, and the water temperature is not hot. I've seen other people talk about this issue with water pressure before. There is also the hygiene of the room. At first glance, it is very casual to clean, and the entire staircase has a lot of dust.
The whole hotel at night is another feeling, the front room is my favorite. The hotel also has a children's playground, which includes a paddling pool and a playground. This ticket can be obtained by following the official account when checking in. But you can only play for one day, and you can go in and out as many times as you want on that day. Not the next day! Our children played in the paddling pool for 2 hours. Although the paddling pool was small, she had a great time. But drinking water is not provided here. Generally, the hotels we live in will provide mineral water in both swimming pools and paddling pools, but not here.
Let's talk about the hotel's breakfast again. As said on the Internet, no one takes the seat, there are few varieties of breakfast, and there are many people. Many dim sum are served cold. Not quite up to the standard of a 5 star hotel. Hope that will change in the future.

msg:Personally like this hotel very much:
1. I drove to the store by myself, the underground garage was full, the security uncle came down to help me find a parking space, thank you so much
2. The garage leads directly to the hotel lobby on the 1st floor. This hotel should have taken the niche route. If there are not many people, it should be more suitable for the scene. The front desk of the hotel and the concierge brother are very good. After registration, they directly helped carry the luggage to the room.
3. We live in a double-bedroom loft. The room is very large. I recorded a 2-minute video but I can only upload it for 30 seconds each time. It is very troublesome to take screenshots. A brief introduction, downstairs there is a large bed, bathroom plus shower, sofa, coffee table, TV, upstairs there is a large bed, TV, chaise longue and bathroom with bathtub, smart toilet and shower, there is also a small balcony outside to sit and enjoy Jing was drinking tea, but it was cold this time, so it didn't come in handy!
The room service is very good. On the day of check-in, they checked and found that the lights were broken. We changed the light bulbs as soon as we entered the door. The turndown service was also very active at night. Capsule coffee and refreshments.
4. Because my father is in poor health, my parents are very happy and satisfied when they stay in the Prime Minister's Mansion this time. I will definitely come again next time I am in the suburbs of Shanghai.
5. I booked the New Year's Eve dinner at Yiyuan. The hotel's food and beverage depar**ent contacted me 2 weeks before check-in. On New Year's Eve, I took my parents to the restaurant. Everything was ready. Most were packed and brought home.
6. It is very convenient to enter the ruins park directly by swiping the room card through the access control. If you are tired from walking, you can go back to the hotel to rest.
All in all, this suburban experience is really great, give the hotel full marks!

I feel that the staff has not been trained, let alone the initiative of the service. The toiletries are changed only when the customer is called, and the slippers are not replaced in time. It‚Äôs like a dial of an abacus. The buffet in the morning is not timely or the food is not fresh. It‚Äôs also very slow, just like breakfast. All the lack of time to make up meals is due to the fact that there are too many guests and the private rooms are full, so it‚Äôs too late. Is there only one hotel in Shanghai that is full? Then I want to ask you, this service fee is a service that needs to be charged It‚Äôs hard to imagine such a high-end hotel with such an unsatisfactory service. The fruit delivery service is only for guests who check in on the first day and continue on the second day. If you don‚Äôt have one, I paid the room rate for two days. The room rate is the same without any discount, but the service I enjoy is really discounted. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a problem if you stay here. The children‚Äôs play facilities on the first floor of the hotel are reserved when booking the hotel. There is no clear notice at all that you need to pay extra fees to play. I didn‚Äôt expect to go in and play and was told that there is such a hidden consumption. How can such a service improve customer satisfaction?

msg:Due to the epidemic, I couldn't go out to play. After seeing a lot of hotels, I finally chose the more distinctive Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel and pretended to be out of Shanghai. Hahaha

üöó Transportation: It is very convenient to get off the toll station. Basically, you can drive along a road to the hotel. The parking space is also very spacious and convenient to take luggage. We arrived very early. The parking lot was quite empty after a day and it was full. There are a lot of cars parked even on the ramp. It seems that the parking space is still very nervous when there are more than one person.

üßπSanitation: The whole hotel is very new and very clean. The room is also cleaned and the outdoor balcony is also very refreshing. There are no leaves and dust.

üçÉEnvironment: The overall environment of the hotel is garden-style and antique. Areas with water on the way to the restaurant in the morning will be sprayed regularly. The a**osphere group is full score üíØ Hahaha
The door of the room is built in, it feels very private, and the sound insulation is OK. The stay experience is very good. We provide two nights of stay. Every night, small snacks and a small brain axe are delivered. It's super cute! The toiletries are from Ferragamo, and the mineral water presented by Nongfu Spring is from Changbai Mountain. Although the wool comes from the sheep, the quality is up! üÜôüÜôüÜô

üîîService: Most of the services are in place. We ordered the New Year's Eve dinner at the hotel and went to eat it early. It can be seen that the hotel has prepared enough for the large passenger flow. The dishes that can be served can be warmed up a bit, that's better
There is also a breakfast section with a lot of choices. The tofu flower is very good. There are also freshly made dumplings. There is also ice cream in the beverage area. This is amazing! It's just that the skin of the shrimp dumplings is a little thick, and the skin of the steamed buns is also a little thick. The pastries may need to be improved.
I also hope that the waiter can take away the empty plate on the table in time. We are used to taking as much as we eat. We may not take much each time, but we will finish it. In this way, we hope that the empty plate on the table can be taken away in time, otherwise we will not be able to put it down haha

Overall, I am very satisfied with this stay. Not bad

msg:The architecture of the Prime Minister's Mansion attracted this hotel. Although it is a domestic brand, I thought that a hotel at this price should be good. It turns out that my idea was wrong. First of all, let‚Äôs talk about check-in and parking. The first time I encountered a hotel parking lot that had no space, it took a long time to park on the slope of the garage. The design of the parking garage is very unreasonable, there are many pillars, and the location is unreasonable. Most importantly there is no management! If you are not staying in a hotel, you can park at any time without charge. As a result, all the people who went to Guangfulin next to them were full, and those who stayed in the store had no place. Let's talk about facilities, a 1700-a-night hotel doesn't have a swimming pool! There is only a 60cm deep children's paddling pool! So speechless! Children's Paradise hotel guests will also be charged 80 yuan once! The children's swimming pool said that it was until 11 pm, and after 10 pm, the staff at the door did not want to let us in, and asked why we came so late. We said that we would only let the children in after playing for half an hour. Is it true that it ends at 11:00? Then the hotel sound insulation is very very poor! Just watch the TV next door and the Echo is like watching a movie in your room! It should be said that there is no sound insulation! I really had a very bad impression of my stay this time. I won't choose this hotel again when I go to Guangfulin next time.

The lady in the hotel said that the room with a big bed was still being cleaned, so I was directly upgraded to a suite. I was pleasantly surprised. The facilities in the room are great. When you push the door to enter the bathroom, the toilet lid will automatically flip up (TOTO), and it will instantly become taller. The breakfast dishes are very rich and taste good. Although Yiyuan's dinner is a little expensive, the shape and taste of each dish is worthy of five stars. I see many people outside the hotel come to eat at the hotel. Special reminder: Try to make an appoin**ent for dinner in advance, otherwise you will have to queue.

The disadvantage is: 80 yuan for the children's park is too expensive, and the price should be differentiated between morning, afternoon and all-day, or hotel guests can have certain discounts. We stayed for three days, and the children had to play every day, for a maximum of 2 hours, which was not suitable.

Stepping into the Jinshi and Difu of Xia Yan, the first assistant of the Ming Dynasty, 500 years ago, black tiles and white walls, bucket arches and cornices, courtyard corridors, pavilions and flowing water. . The two-story lobby is said to be composed of 65 golden nanmu, top wood, and oak, all of which were demolished and rebuilt from Guixi, Jiangxi. The carvings on the simple logs are lifelike, and the precious woods are naturally elegant and fragrant. With the electronic animation of the theme of "Clouds Steaming Xia Wei", the entire lobby is powerful, reflecting the low-key luxury and solemnity of the Chinese-style mansion. During the journey, it is like passing a hundred years in seconds, and those who are close to it are also coming. As a resort hotel, the rooms are large, and most of them have terraces along the river. Sleeping against the river is like the hometown of Jiangnan. Under the traditional Chinese coat, there is also a heart for children to play. The game console children's playground paddling pool is still very suitable for young children's parent-child families. The slightly larger table tennis, billiards, and chess and card rooms are also very suitable and full of vitality. In-house guests can rent Ming Dynasty costumes for three hours. Walking through the 500-year-old Nanmu mansion, reading books and drinking tea, is really a leisurely half-day leisure timeüëå

The attitude of the service staff is also very friendly, and the overall is still very good. The fly in the oin**ent feels that there are two points, which only represent personal opinions for your reference: 1. It is a bit embarrassing that the two-bedroom suite only provides two breakfasts. In addition, children who are over one meter 2 will be charged (half price), which should be a bit rare in high-end wine. Experience It's almost 1.4 meters. 2. Except for booking parent-child themed rooms, the hotel's parent-child park is charged, 80 per day. As for the Luming Pavilion restaurant, I personally think that if there is no need to pay attention to the occasion, you can consider choosing something else üòÇ

The hotel has a card directly connected to Guangfulin, you can take night scenes!

room üõè
It is lavish enough. The courtyard on the first floor is a treasure place for directly viewing flowers, birds and fish. It is worth a moment of paradise, not inferior to the gardens of Suzhou and Hangzhou. Except the sensor light is slightly sensitive and the sound insulation is extremely poor, everything else is fine. The quality of the hotel supplies is very good, the bed is sleepy, and the Salvatore Ferragamo for the toiletries. The small tea set in the room is cute and lovely, as well as Jin Junmei, Tieguanyin and so on.

Dining üç≥
Only had breakfast and really liked it! When I went at 7 o'clock, there were no people and the dishes were not ready. Basically, it came out at 7:30. It was very rich! I love the fried dumplings and fried dough sticks! There are many hot Chinese dishes and steaming, and the pork neck is so powerful! There are salmon and sushi, and the coffee machine can also make Australian white, which is absolutely amazing!

fitness üèì
There are chess and card rooms (for money), ping-pong room, and billiards room. There are many people who have not tried it, but I only know that everyone inside is happy. The gym is not big, but the equipment is complete. I have developed new equipment, which is amazing. Now the all-in-one is absolutely amazing. Yoga mats and foam rollers are of good quality. However, the goose does not have a swimming pool for adultsüò©

The next day I went on a trip, and when I returned to the room after one o'clock in the afternoon, my aunt was cleaning again. When I entered the room for two consecutive days, they all stood outside and waited. The accommodation experience was poor. The biggest weird thing about the room is that, from the entrance to the card bar, the entire aisle is about three or four meters away, and all voice-activated lights are installed, and the lights are not turned on as soon as people walk by, and they have to go to the door. This led to the aisle being dark for a long time. Sitting in the hall, the large area on the left is dark. The light in the room was originally dark, so it looked even darker. This light is for environmentalists. Designed? The room is located on the first floor, there is a little greenery outside the balcony, and outside the greenery is the main road of the hotel, so the whole room is very gray, and footprints can be stepped on the floor. There are cobwebs in the corners of the balcony, the tables, chairs and railings are all gray. It is impossible to sit on the balcony and drink tea and watch the scenery. The glass on the balcony and the glass in the room are the dirtiest in the hotel I have ever stayed in. , without one, it is hard to imagine that the glass of a five-star hotel room can be so dirty! The TV cannot cast the screen, there is no on-demand, and there is no satellite channel, which is very low. After talking about the room and food, the Chinese waiter made a mistake on the first night and didn't explain it. On the second night, the waiter came up with an open bottle of beer. The sushi was served without sauce. Do you want to eat sushi? Staying at the hotel for three days and two nights is a lot of bad things. Although the room manager has also explained and gave small gifts when leaving the hotel, these are not enough to change the bad accommodation experience. It is said that the hotel rooms are full on New Year's Day. It feels that the staff of this hotel is not capable enough to receive the full guests. It is in competition with the Xi** Hotel next door, so what is there to compete with?

The second is because it is just fresh. The decorated, individually sealed corridors can still smell.

The hotel policy is 15:00 in the afternoon. We arrived at the hotel at 14:50 and were told that there was no room. Asked when we can get the room , Answer 15:00-16:00, the reason is that the room was full the day before, is this the reason for not being able to hand over the room on time? Later, I changed the appearance of a front desk manager to check in. There was no smiling face during the whole process. The reason was repeated mechanization, and there was no comfort to the guests. Although we finally got the room on time with our insistence, it felt very bad. The next day When I got up, I found that there were snacks from the former guest under the bed. The cleaning was not meticulous enough. Finally, I would like to praise the room service is very prompt and enthusiastic. Welcome fruits are delivered in time, toothbrushes and toothpaste are also delivered quickly, and the whole process is courteous. , The contrast with the front desk is obvious. For the same hotel staff, the contrast between the training results is too great.

Thank you very much. The check-out procedure is very simple, and the breakfast is very generous, but there are too many people, and the waiter sister can no longer take a seat, which causes some guests to find a place to eat at once. The clock tower of Huazheng opposite the hotel, the ringing of the bell at 6 in the morning really wakes me up from my dream, the pillows in the room are really uncomfortable, the quality of sleep is indeed discounted, other aspects are very good, I recommend everyone to come Check in, after all, it's in the scenic area, and the price is much higher than that of Hilton

msg:Guangfulin Prime Minister's Mansion, opened this spring, the hotel is very new.
The mansion in Jiangxi, Fu Xia Yan, the head of the Ming Dynasty, was demolished and moved over. As soon as you enter the lobby of the ancient house, you can smell the fragrance of logs, golden nanmu! The whole hall is supported by three sets of wooden pillars, and a pair of large columns with a diameter of 64cm is really amazing. The design of the entire lobby is open and simple, simple and magnificent, and the antique is combined with modern fabrics, which does not violate the harmony at all.
There are large and large wood carving stories on the carved beams in the primary color in the lobby, showing the aesthetics and finesse of the ancients everywhere. In contrast, Duoyunxuan in Guangfulin also relocated the entire old house, which is not enough.
Hotel twin room, the room is very spacious, the bathroom is open on both sides for easy entry and exit.
Disadvantage 1 Bathroom door design, the non-pullable door shrinks by 20-30 cm, you can watch TV while soaking in the bathtub.
Disadvantage 2 The lighting combination is not good enough, and there is one less reading light design, which is convenient for people who are used to sleeping late, and does not affect the rest of the family, but also retains
A little soft light.
Disadvantage 3 A common problem with many five-star hotels is too hot and too dry.
The hotel‚Äôs service is very good, with a five-star standard. It is especially worth mentioning that the hotel does not skimp on drinking water. The standard configuration is 4 bottles. [Smile].
Recommend the tea provided by the hotel. I tried Jin Junmei. The tea color, tea fragrance and tea taste are all good.
There is a Wanfu Bridge in the garden, and you can pass the bridge directly to Guangfulin by swiping the door with your room card. Walk 50 meters to the dining street in Guangfulin, with lakes and mountains, and Yexie pastries.

msg:Established next to the Guangfulin site, the birthplace of Shanghai, the hotel itself is also an old mansion, echoing Guangfulin. Fortunately, it is very quiet and well managed. The security at the entrance of the car and the brother must maintain a five-star service. People who are not related to the hotel are not allowed to enter, which makes the residents quite at ease, so they don't want to go to Guangfulin to join in the fun. Because of the epidemic, people in Shanghai can't go out, so the room is almost full. The little girl and the manager are very good at handling them. Will they ask if there is a demand for the room? Although the needs are not met, it makes me very happy. Secondly, the room size and decoration are integrated with the environment, and there is also a welcome gift for check-in. There are five-star equipment, such as capsule coffee, etc. The five-piece bath set does not have the Clarins in the previous evaluation, which is the general hotel delivery "Shanghai Beach". At this price, you can send Sprite Coke in the refrigerator, but no. Breakfast is similar to all five-stars, nothing special, there are many people on weekends, and replenishment is fast, not as many as the staff. In that Chinese restaurant, I have to wait in line to go to the restaurant at night. There are no discounts and no care for the guests. So I can only go to another Japanese food store for dinner. It is estimated that many people have no choice but to choose this way.

It is very convenient for elderly people or children to go back to the hotel to rest at any time. There is also a country park next to the Guangfulin Site, so it is recommended to stay at this hotel for two to three nights. There is plenty of play time, more fun, and not too tired.
1. Convenient transportation. Adjacent to Guangfulin Site, Chenshan Botanical Garden, Yuehu Sculpture Park, Happy Valley, Sheshan etc. are all within easy reach. I personally think that Guangfulin is my favorite among these scenic spots.
2. The guest room environment is very good. The main entrance hall is full of cultural relics. Many guests are checking in and taking pictures. It can be said that the hotel itself is also an attraction. The rooms are relatively spacious, the facilities are new, and the bath products are all Clarins. The stuff of this brand is still very useful.
3. The breakfast is relatively complete, supplemented in time, and tastes good.
4. The hotel comes with a children's playground, and because of the parent-child room, a coupon for the playground is given. There are still many playable items, and the children will have a lot of fun. A voucher is limited to one day and can be used repeatedly on the same day. It would be better if it could be used during the stay.
5. Hotel service, staff attitude is very good, especially the front desk, deal with it in time, check in is fast, the front desk manager Wang, a handsome guy with humor, clear thinking, enthusiastic service, we take the children and help us take our luggage along the way Go to the room and answer our questions, you must like it üëç
In a word, a very distinctive hotel, with Chinese culture flowing in the tranquility, will stay again, and I recommend it to everyone.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good, just beside Guangfulin, hotel guests can directly enter Guangfulin by swiping their cards.
A staff member will confirm the check-in time and other information with you the night before check-in. We arrived at the hotel more than 12 o'clock the next day, and the rooms have been prepared for us, which is very considerate.
The hotel's Chinese food is very good, there are lobby and private rooms, you can choose at will (private rooms need to be booked in advance).
The only downside is that the lobby and breakfast room are relatively small, and it will be more crowded when it comes to peaks.

msg:Take the mother to stay on vacation. The hotel is an Hui style building. It is said that the entire building was transported from Jiangxi, and each log has a history of hundreds of years. The three-entry structure of Huizhou architecture is simple and elegant. White bricks and black tiles, eaves beasts, very shocking. The hotel itself is a landscape, adjacent to the Guangfulin ruins.

The Ming Dynasty architecture of the entire hotel is integrated with the natural scenery, with small bridges and flowing water, resting on the river. You can watch the sunrise or the moon. The feeling of drinking tea on the balcony is very good, the wind is clear and the autumn is high.

The food in the hotel restaurant is also very good. The fly in the oin**ent is the room delivery, which was delivered nearly half an hour late. Perhaps it is the lack of experience in the newly opened hotel, and it should be possible to improve in the future to live up to the beautiful scenery.

The gift from the hotel is very delicate, thank you.

msg:The overall design and positioning of the hotel is very good. Recently I like this kind of ancient hotel.

Part of the hotel is very similar to Zhujiajiao Anlu. The hotel can directly enter the main scenic area of Guangfulin by swiping the room card at the back door of Guangfulin Scenic Area.

The rooms are also good. The basic room with balcony is about 50 square meters. Because it is a new hotel, the facilities are good. It‚Äôs nice to have a balcony. You can drink tea and read a book on the small table on the balcony.

The weekend occupancy rate is very high. The basic rooms are full. But when I went there was no concierge at the door, and there was no guide to check in. I couldn't even see any staff member, so I could only trouble the cleaning aunt to guide the front desk.

On weekends, breakfast is only 3 hours from 7 to 10 o'clock. I thought 9 o'clock was the peak, but I didn't expect 8 o'clock to be the peak. It is recommended to pick up the noodles after 3 minutes. I didn‚Äôt expect to change hands and give your customized noodles to others. . In other words, if you don‚Äôt stand by and wait for what you want, you may never be able to do it. .

During the breakfast, I asked the staff if I don‚Äôt need to wear a mask to pick up the meal. Answer: No need. Only this point is immediately reduced by 100% here. .

The Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel is both Chinese and foreign. The interior is clean and western. The three-story building is completely connected. Walking in the corridor is like walking into a maze. The outdoor is simple and elegant, with gray walls and black tiles, winding paths and crooked rivers...
My favorite is on both sides of the small river. From time to time, water sprays and mists, which makes people feel immortal. A pair of unfamiliar old people, walking on the foggy stone path, staggered...

This time I booked two room types: parent-child suites, suitable for younger children. The bathroom with parent-child sets is very cramped. There is a problem with the countertop design. The vanity mirror may be hung particularly high in consideration of the child. It can directly cure the cervical spine.
Another loft room type is very good, there are bathrooms on the upper and lower floors, the best choice for family travel
The hotel has a small door that leads directly to the Guangfulin Ruins Park. It saves a detour and takes the main entrance. The hotel lobby is very distinctive. There is no cave, but the service desk is very cramped and can‚Äôt be received with more people, but the guy at the front desk has a good service attitude and has a good memory.

The hotel has a small door that leads directly to Guangfulin. Guangfulin at night is still worth a visit, which is completely different from what you see during the day. Although the lights have been reduced a lot after the National Day, I still recommend you to go shopping and have a look.

Indeed, as shown in the picture, the details of the architectural furnishings are very well done, and the lighting effects are also very rendering. I really like the koi in the pool. We can watch it for a long time.

The terrace of the room is very transparent and comfortable. After a few minutes of opening, the smell of the decoration in the room is basically gone, and the surprise is that there are no mosquitoes in it. The matching coffee/pot is very good, easy to operate and tastes good, much better than the standard instant coffee in ordinary hotels, but the taste of tea is weak.

The service attitude is very good, thoughtful, timely, and considerate to customers.

I don‚Äôt think anyone thought about the shortcomings, but the TV is really only TV, no other apps, no movies, no games, no English stations, this is something I‚Äôve never encountered before, so boring to say :-p

msg:When I first saw the hotel, it was amazing. Entering the hotel‚Äôs living room area (that is, the photo-taking area) was antique, substitutable, and tasteful in soft decoration. The entire hotel environment also has many varieties of vegetation, dense plants, small bridges and flowing water pavilions, you can imagine the beauty of the original flourishing age.
Afterwards, the feeling is really not as pleasant as the scenery, but the quality of the hotel‚Äôs Japanese materials is also quite good, whether it is freshness or quantity, you can praise it üëç. The first regret was when the meal was finished and the bill was settled, because the in-house guests also had advance deduction as a deposit when they checked in. Therefore, I asked for a billing, but the subsequent processing made me unable to feel the service level that matched this. The hotel refused to bill the bill because the meal cost exceeded the deduction of 54 yuan, and I proposed that it would also be paid when checking out. Lost, but it still doesn't work ‚ùå or you need to go to the lobby immediately and deduct the fee again, because it is with two children and I don't want to toss back and forth, so I just paid directly to the restaurant at that time;
After washing up the next morning, because the towel fell off accidentally, when I picked it up, I saw a lot of long hair on the towel. I suddenly felt sick and shuddered with goose bumps. Because I have super short hair myself, the two boys are of course short hair, so those long hair is obviously not our own...Hey, I don‚Äôt know how to say it. I pointed out as an opinion when checking out, the staff‚Äôs reaction speed is also considered fast. , Immediately proposed to waive the breakfast fee of 99 yuan.
But the problem is not 99 yuan. The point is that there are rave reviews. No matter when the hotel is hard to find, it is difficult for me to say anything at the end of my holiday... As a local in Shanghai, I think I will not deliberately stay in a hotel again in the future. Visiting the Guangfulin ruins, so this kind of image should be a comprehensive product for the hotel...
The service level is the most important soft power. No matter how luxurious the decoration is, no matter how high-end appliances are, as long as there is a little flaw, especially the towels with long hair of others, how do you feel?
Finally, I would like to say that when I put it forward, I also clearly informed that there was no photo taken üì∑, because it is of little significance, and the staff quickly handled it and went upstairs to check it, which also explained the truth.

msg:The newly built hotel tastes normal, and the facilities will be worn out when the taste disappears;
Many people do not go early during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and basically can‚Äôt queue up. There is no western food supply, but there are Starbucks in Guangfulin, and there are many restaurants where you can eat things at the back door of the hotel.
The ancient architectural style of the entire hotel is suitable for the elderly to live, there are not many things for breakfast, and there are many people in line for freshly burned things.

msg:üçæMadu Hotel Line IIüç∑[Guangfulin Prime Minister's Mansion Hotel] is also a newly opened hotel this year! Excellent location ~ located in the Songjiang Guangfulin Cultural Relics (near the "Fulin Gate", 3088 Guangfulin Road, the overall architectural style is mainly new Chinese style, black tiles and white walls, bucket arches and cornices, curved courtyard corridors, pavilions Flowing water. It has the magnificence of Huizhou architecture and the compactness and exquisiteness of Suzhou gardens. The classic elegance and fashion style are perfectly blended.

One of the most beautiful finishing touches is the Ming Dynasty "Ancient House Lobby" in Guixi, Jiangxi, where the entrance is located. After restoration, the old house moved to its current location). It is said that the restoration of the entire ancient house does not require a single nail, it is made by old craftsmen using mortise and tenon to pile up ~ a whole body! Whether it is a carved wooden window (stigma) or an ancient lamp, it shows the a**osphere of traditional Chinese culture everywhere.

Stepping out of the old house, what you see is the elegant and deep courtyard of the Soviet-style garden. Stroll in the courtyard and enjoy the leisurely and elegant taste.

The small details in the guest room are also full of ancient meaning! The comfort of the bedding is more in line with our needs than the other one in Guangfulin!

The hotel's Chinese restaurant dishes are also in line with the high standards of five-star hotels, and each dish shows the chef's intentions!

Be sure to have afternoon tea in the backyard of the old building. The scenery is great and the tea food is also very good. My room is on the first floor, the balcony faces the garden, and under the balcony is the goldfish pond. It is good to sit by the goldfish pond in the morning and drink tea and watch the fishes. The room is separated from wet and dry, and there is also a bathtub. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is very rich, I really like their small wontons, tofu flowers and fried dumplings. For dinner, it is recommended to dine at the hotel‚Äôs Yiyuan. The dishes are very exquisite. The sesame crispy chicken, abalone braised pork, pine nuts and wild vegetable buns and Hua Ting glutinous perch are my favorites.

It's service to complain. I thought it was a boutique hotel, but the three front desks couldn't help it. Later, I found that there are a lot of rooms, and it is too much to wait for more than 20 minutes to check in during peak hours. Moreover, the order is chaotic, and the queue is also required. The breakfast staff did not seem to be very experienced in dealing with large passenger flows. The environment and variety of tea room, afternoon tea and breakfast are good

I booked a private room on the 2nd floor for dinner, and the environment and dishes are not bad. I booked a set of afternoon tea for both Chinese and Western. There is no reserved space. The one used in the lobby is a little embarrassing for people to come and go. The little friends are still very happy to have fun. Two or three days
In the evening, a dinner plus an afternoon tea, the total cost is about 21,000 (group purchase for one of the rooms), it should be a second hotel.

The bathroom space on the upper and lower floors is large enough, and the bed is also a king-size bed. However, the air conditioner on the upper floor is facing the bed, which makes it easy to catch cold when sleeping at night.

1. The large double bed in the room is 4 feet and a half, and the four of us can sleep without an extra bed.
2The hotel parking is free. The hotel is located in the Guangfulin ruins, so it is very convenient to go to the museum. Although the weather is very hot, it is very comfortable by the lake.
3 Hotel breakfast is not very rich, but the overall taste is okay.
4It is still very suitable for bringing a baby in. When I went to the hotel pool, I knew that I was very young and hopeless, but the two children felt very happy. They played until 11 pm and closed the door üòÇ. It was also very convenient to check out the next day! On the next day, you can die directly at Mau Smurf Paradise to play indoors!

msg:It's hard to evaluate this time! In fact, it should be a good place to take the elderly and children on vacation. Children can gain a lot of historical knowledge while playing, and the elderly have a beautiful and quiet environment to watch. The hotel is very creative, with good architecture and decoration. There are three things that disappoint me:
1. Waiter training is not in place: When we checked in, the concierge took us around on the second floor and found our room on the first floor. Of course he apologized. For breakfast the next day, the room attendant told us that it was at B1 and the telephone service said that the lobby concierge would guide us. In the end, I went to the lobby and asked.
2. The most uncomfortable thing is the toilet seat. It is not smart, let alone the toilet. It is also different in size from the toilet, and the material is poor. New hotel, why the customer broke the original toilet lid so quickly? The express hotel is better than this.
3. I booked two rooms 7111 and 7112. The toiletries in the two rooms are actually different. Does this hotel have standards?

msg:I chose this hotel because I read various reviews saying that there are children‚Äôs amusement parks and other parent-child projects, so I chose this hotel. Due to the large number of people staying in the summer vacation, I was told in advance that I would not be able to check in after 3 pm, and I went to the children‚Äôs playground after check-in. I was told to stay in the hotel. Guests also need to buy tickets for the children‚Äôs playground, 80 yuan/piece/person (children), from 8 am to 11 pm. I personally think that this is unreasonable, and forget it. I was worried when the children went in to play. The children‚Äôs facilities were not safe (the sockets were not protected, and the walls were not soft-covered), and the sanitation was also worrying (sand and ocean). The balls are mixed together and the socks turn black within 5 minutes.) The children‚Äôs amusement park is sultry and not ventilated in the basement, so it is not recommended to go to this hotel to take children to play in the amusement park later, but you can do it at will if you don‚Äôt mind; The room is still very clean, the staff are very enthusiastic, the lobby can take pictures, read books, cultural a**osphere is still there, next to the Guangfulin Ruins Park, it is also good to walk the baby, in general, except for the awkward children's playground in the hotel , Others are still possible.

The check-in brother was very polite, and the aunt who cleaned the room was also very polite. commendable.
The service staff of the children's playground and the water play center are not good. Let's talk about the children's playground first. I don't know that some comments say that it is very big. What is the result of comparison? Just an ocean ball pool, the ball is not willing to put it, it is very shallow. Two trampolines, a sand pool, sand was flying everywhere, no one cleaned it. There is also an inexplicable place where no one plays with it. You don't need to wear socks when you go in and out. So many people walk in barefoot, and hygiene is worrying. There are bear kids in the venue and the staff did not maintain order, pretending to be deaf and dumb at the door. The water play center is too small to be unbelievable. When I went there, I said that the current limit was not allowed, and guests were asked to leave their mobile phones to wait for notifications. No one ever called when they checked out.
Besides Yiyuan, the waiter is dumb as an AI. He can only pour water and nothing else. Talking to her means nothing. You need to go and find someone else to pack the box yourself.
The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and antique, and the place for afternoon tea on the first floor is also beautiful and worth a try. It is also close to Guangfulin on foot. I hope that the hotel will train some of its employees and do better.

Integrating with Guangfulin, it is very convenient to go to the source during the day and to visit the ruins. Just a warm reminder, flat shoes, sports shoes are good

msg:The location of this hotel is good, just beside Guangfulin, parking is more convenient. The hotel is very large, a bit detour, and people with a bad sense of direction will get lost.
The service of the hotel staff is generally good and friendly. The guest room is provided with free Nongfu Spring. It‚Äôs hot in summer. After drinking the water, a phone call will be delivered soon. There is nothing to say. The front desk staff are very nice and polite.
The hotel‚Äôs water play center is suitable for children, and the children‚Äôs playground requires additional tickets, but the children‚Äôs playground is large and has more facilities. It is also suitable for younger children to play. So this hotel is more suitable for bringing younger children to play.
After staying for two days, several defects were found.
First, the hotel is relatively new, and there is still a smell of decoration in the room. The room we stayed in had obvious stains on the back of the bed and the sofa in the room. The room is a bit hot, the air conditioner is 18 degrees, but the actual display is still 26 degrees, a bit hot in summer, the room temperature is not low. The design of the room lighting mode is unreasonable, there is no way to leave a bedside lamp, even if you choose the soft mode, it will make the room very bright.
Second, we stayed for two consecutive days. The room attendant replenished the toiletries in time, but the coffee and tea were not replenished in time. I gave a snack box on the first day, which was probably a check-in gift, but it was also confiscated the next day. At this point, attention should also be paid to details.
Third, I gave two afternoon tea vouchers. This afternoon tea is a bit tasteless, with a pot of tea and a table of biscuits. After a visit, both coupons were all sold out. I didn't know whether this coupon was counted by head or number of times. The labeling is not clear, and it feels unreasonable.
Fourth, the breakfast is so mediocre. There are not many varieties, there are many customers during peak hours, and the restaurant's capacity is obviously insufficient. The fried rice noodles are cold and taste bad. We also tried the dinner buffet once. The sashimi was good, but the other dishes were still too few, which was not in line with the price of nearly 300.
Fifth, there are not many restaurants to choose from near the hotel. You can also drive out for food when you come by car, otherwise you can only choose the restaurants in the hotel. Ordering food at his Yiyuan restaurant is very difficult. Scanning the code, but without pictures, it is very difficult to see the blind selection of dishes.
But overall, the hotel is ok.

Some people eat directly while standing. Meals are not updated fast enough, and often many plates are empty. The cleanliness of the restaurant cannot be complimented.

msg:The quaint building is close to the Guangfulin Scenic Area. When I arrive at the hotel, I feel that I am back in ancient times. The hotel staff is very considerate and will help with luggage. The check-in staff will also hand tea and pour water. The hotel environment is really good.

msg:After reading other customer reviews before, I thought the semi-buffet breakfast in the hotel would be very general, and the result was amazing: the color, fragrance and flavor are excellent (pictured). In addition, the biggest feature of the hotel is to find a retreat experience in the antique mood (it is said that the prime minister is the Xia Yan of the Ming Dynasty: the disciple of Zhang Juzheng). The design sense of the entire hotel is integrated with the design sense of the Guangfulin site. Quiet, fortunate enough to see the fire cloud. The hotel‚Äôs children‚Äôs pool and children‚Äôs playground are closer to children. In addition, my daughter especially likes the tent in the room and insists on sleeping in it for one night.

msg:Let me talk about the key points first. In the two-bedroom loft suite we stayed in, our 12-year-old kid suddenly fell over the bathroom door in the room, which surprised us. Later, it was discovered that the bath water in the bathroom had seeped out along the wall, and the soles of disposable slippers were dripping with water. The walk on the floor tiles was very slippery. The hotel should pay attention to this point. At that time, the child did not smash and bleed, so the hotel was not notified. But regardless of whether the elderly or children encounter this situation, it is very dangerous. The scenery inside and outside the hotel, the location is invincible, and the service is also very good. I stayed for two nights, ate four meals at Yiyuan, one meal at Luming Pavilion, the dishes are really attractive and tasteful, there is no doubt about this Yes, it's just that some of the waiters in Luming Pavilion are not conscious of service and have a good attitude. The waiters kept clearing their throats while standing in the aisle of the box, which made us a little mad at hearing. We still need to pay attention to pharyngitis. The hotel‚Äôs western restaurant has launched a buffet and it should be advertised at the front desk or at breakfast. This changed the pressure of Yiyuan, but our guests didn‚Äôt know that there was a buffet, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have eaten Yiyuan four times. There are not many people in the children‚Äôs playground. In-store customers buy a ticket for 80 yuan, and children can enter and exit unlimited times within a day. 88 hours for billiards and 68 hours for table tennis are both acceptable prices. Parking in the underground garage is free. Since the meals are all hanging on the room, the hotel felt that my deposit was not enough and I had to go to the front desk to recharge. I felt that this was too small to make, the first time I encountered it. The asparagus bonsai in the room is full of dense white bugs, which makes the scalp numb. It's good overall, and there are many things that can be improved in the details.

msg:I heard that a new cultural hotel was opened on the Guangfulin Site, so I came to experience it. The most distinctive feature of the hotel is the lobby of the old mansion, which was originally demolished and reconstructed from Guixi, Jiangxi. The rooms are in a new Chinese style and very impressive. The hotel service is very warm and thoughtful, especially the concierge Xiaohe is very enthusiastic and meticulous, helping to introduce room facilities and breakfast time. This staying experience was great! I hope I can come to experience the hotel afternoon tea and Yiyuan Chinese restaurant next time.

msg:The high-priced hotel pillows are not equipped with thickness distinction. Both pillows are thick. The bedroom top of the suite is low and hot. The air-conditioning temperature does not come down at night. I did not sleep well all night, which caused both people to be tired and spent the next day. Very good price, not as comfortable as the orange hotel, poor
