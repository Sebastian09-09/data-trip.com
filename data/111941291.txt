msg:My recent stay was overall pleasant, with comfortable accommodations, friendly staff, and convenient amenities. However, one aspect that fell short of expectations was the gym equipment.

While I appreciate the effort to provide fitness facilities, the gym equipment was lacking in variety and quality. The available machines were limited. Additionally, the selection of free weights was minimal, making it difficult to complete a well-rounded workout.

As someone who values staying active during travels, I found this aspect of the hotel disappointing. It would be beneficial for the management to invest in upgrading the gym equipment to better cater to the fitness needs of guests. With improved facilities, guests like myself would be more inclined to utilize the gym during their stay and leave with a more positive impression overall.

In the morning the breakfast buffet has many Chinese and western options and is all freshly made. The free airport shuttle is convenient and on time. The best asset of the hotel is the staff - all are very helpful and keen to please; from the tea offered at check in to the fruit basket delivered to the room. A 5* choice

I only knew where it was more convenient. I didn't expect the simple designer style decoration in the lobby, especially the style I like.

The hotel is close to the airport, but the smell of the new hotel is so bad that I couldn't sleep all night. There were no bathing slippers in the bathroom, so it was so slippery. Who cares? The lighting design of the room is too unreasonable. It is in a rural area with wild mountains and wild mountains. It is okay for people who want to catch a flight, but it is not suitable for traveling. It is too biased. How did Ctrip get the 5-star rating? ,

Before checking in, the housekeeper Xiaojuan called me in advance, checked the hotel reservation information with me, and asked me what time I would arrive at the hotel and what room requirements I had. I asked for a higher floor and a non-smoking room. When I arrived at the store, I felt Xiaojuan’s warm service. She brought me tea and hot towels, and took the initiative to ask me if I was coming to Guangzhou for business or tourism. She kept chatting with me and felt it. Feeling like coming home. No wonder they asked me when I would arrive at the store. I was very satisfied with the service. They asked me in advance if I needed pick-up service, checked my pick-up information with me, and helped me make an appoin**ent for hotel personnel to pick me up. After I got off the plane, they even asked me if the driver had contacted me, for fear that they would be neglected if they didn't receive the call. After checking in, customer service Xiaojuan helped me with my luggage and took me to the elevator. She told me that the hotel had free late-night snacks. She also took the initiative to tell me that they could be delivered to my room. I had a great time chatting with Xiaojuan. After going to the room, Xiaojuan delivered the cooked noodles to the room. The noodles were very good and delicious. This is a very considerate service. You can have a midnight snack and fall asleep full. It made me feel that my family cared about me, and it was really a home away from home. The next day, I asked Xiaojuan about what to eat, drink and do near the hotel. He also introduced me in detail to the nearest Sunac Mao shopping mall, which has skiing options and delicious hot pot and Japanese food shops. I recommended a night market area with a lot of snacks. He also sent me the location and said he could answer any questions he had at any time, which was great. When they learned that I needed airport drop-off service, they asked me where I was flying and whether I needed to check it in. They told me that I had to leave the hotel two hours in advance and what time would be appropriate for breakfast. Just after we finished eating, we set off from the door on time. He helped me put my luggage in the car and told me that I was looking forward to going home next time. It was really warm. The service over the past few days has been very attentive. If I have anything, I can ask Xiaojuan to solve it immediately. If I need room toiletries, they will also help me deliver them to the room. The room was very comfortable and clean. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming, thank you to the hotel for providing such a good service. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Guangzhou. It is worth recommending!

msg:As someone who has been working in hotels since the end of 1990, I am very satisfied with my final choice here! ￼The overall hardware and service software are both remarkable. For a hotel that has been newly opened for about three months, everything that needs to be thought about and done in terms of details has been fulfilled￼. From the perspective of an experienced hotelier, there is room for improvement, but it is already pretty good. The airport pick-up and drop-off service is proactive, with on-time departures and good car models; the breakfast buffet is rich in variety and the service is attentive. The brunch tea and a la carte dishes in the Chinese restaurant are also excellent.
      The front desk staff has strong service awareness and responds to problems quickly and efficiently. Among them, Xiao Zhong left a deep impression on me. He handed me a cup of hot tea with both hands when checking in, contacted him to ask if it was convenient before giving him a welcome fruit plate, and said goodbye politely with a smile before leaving.
      Although it has been less than 16 hours since I left the hotel, I am already looking forward to my next stay in the near future.

msg:Near Guangzhou Baiyun Airport, 5-star hotel, 24-hour shuttle service, hotel that can accommodate foreign guests ~ etc., this hotel is satisfactory
1. Car: It takes about 15 minutes from Baiyun Airport to the hotel. I called and said it would take 15 to 20 minutes. I calculated it myself and it took about 11 to 15 minutes, which is relatively close. It's not a bus. It comes as soon as you arrive. We provide you with one-on-one service. When you book a hotel, leave your flight number and phone number and the driver will come. The hotel departs from the airport on time, no need to wait, and no need to get on the bus if there is no parking space. I like it very much.
2. Front desk: The reception of foreign guests is okay.
3. Room: 5 star hotel, basically the same, but I am very satisfied with many details, such as disposable items, rubber bands in disposable hats, earplugs, free drinks in the refrigerator, welcome fruits, etc. There is a dressing table chair under the dressing table, which makes me sigh. I can sit on the chair and blow dry my hair. The hotel room is so perfectly designed. Like it👍🏻
4. Breakfast: delicious, not many varieties, but they are all delicious. I really have more time and want to enjoy the food slowly. I didn’t eat much and it took more than half an hour. Freshly ground coffee, jam knife, and cheese are good. Eat~.
Overall, very satisfied.

msg:The rooms are dark and some don't even have windows. The hotel is in an industrial park, and it feels like it was renovated from an old factory or unfinished building. The atmosphere was eerie. It's cheap and affordable to catch a flight, so don't have any expectations. There is a free bus to the airport, but it only leaves once an hour. If you have an early flight and have to leave before 7 o'clock, don't expect to have breakfast. When we checked in, we promised to pack our bags in the morning, but they were not ready.

msg:I would like to sincerely thank this hotel for a very memorable stay and especially for the excellent service provided to my family. My mother specifically asked me to write a positive review to express her gratitude for your staff's excellent service and genuine care.

My mother originally planned to take a non-Singapore flight from Guangzhou, but she was unable to board the flight that day due to a sudden cardiovascular disease. I had to book her a room at your hotel remotely and your team played a key role in this difficult time. Your staff demonstrates exceptional hospitality and a strong commi**ent to service.

One particularly striking moment was when a manager came to my mother's room with a member of your team and asked with concern about her health. After that, I went to the hotel restaurant to order food. Seeing that my mother was not in good health, the service staff asked her to go back to the room to wait, and then took the initiative to deliver the food to the room. The kindness and concern went way beyond expectations and the sense of service was great. What's more, your team didn't ask to write a positive review like some other hotels do. As such, we didn't remember their names, but their dedication to guest satisfaction will forever be remembered.

The room is not only spacious, but also clean and tidy. Meticulous attention to providing a comfortable and welcoming environment has not been overlooked. The breakfast can be seen to be made with great care and tastes delicious.

I must also commend your airport transfer service. Under the scorching sun, your driver showed extraordinary patience and service. He made sure to get on board comfortably and assisted with luggage.

All in all, your hotel's excellent service, genuine care for your guests and your team's

We were impressed by the ongoing efforts to provide comfort and health during these difficult times. Thank you for your excellent hospitality and service.

msg:I checked it out on Ctrip and saw a lot of good reviews, so I decided to give it a try. Before I even entered the hotel, I saw a shadow trotting through a glass door and trotting up to help us get our luggage and take us to the front desk. After checking in, he was very considerate and provided red date tea and towels. What was particularly touching was that the little girl suddenly said: Sir, welcome home. You have had a hard journey, wipe your hands, and then provide tea to quench your thirst. Suddenly I felt It was so warm, and then he asked me if I was here for a trip? Where are you coming from? Where are you planning to go? He gave me a detailed introduction to the places to eat next to the hotel. The hotel is very close to the airport and it is very convenient to go to the airport. The housekeeper sent us to the room to bring us slippers and boiled water for us. What did we drink? The hotel provided black tea, green tea, and coffee. It felt so considerate. She then asked us if we had any clothes to change. There must be a lot of dirty clothes when we go out to play. I asked her where I could wash clothes, and she said no. You are very tired after riding in the car for a day. I will wash it for you and send it directly to your room in a while. This is the best service I have ever seen. We rested for a while and saw her again when we went out to the lobby. She was the receptionist. Our housekeeper, Xiao Shuang, rushed over and asked us where we wanted to go now and if we would like to call a car for you. She took us to the car very carefully. When I came back, I found that a luxurious meal was prepared for our room. The fruits include sunshine rose green grapes, plums, and cherry tomatoes. They are all fruits that I like to eat. I said that I prefer cherry tomatoes because they have low sugar content. She said that next time I come, I will contact her in advance and she will prepare a plate of cherry tomatoes. It really warms my heart. I give Huanhuan a big thumbs up! The next morning, he sent me a WeChat message to see if I had breakfast. The service was really good. He even arranged a car for me to go to the airport. He was really considerate. The room environment was also nice. It really felt like a vacation. It was so nice. Thank you. To be honest, our family may not be able to provide such attentive service. We were lucky enough to meet each other when we were traveling. We are very lucky. From now on, I will stay at Meihao Yazhi! I love this place from the bottom of my heart and don't want to leave. I believe I will come again next time 😊 😊

The second hotel is not very close to the airport, and there are many hotels to choose from in the same area and distance. I was anxious to book this hotel because it was the first one recommended by Ctrip. I also felt that Ctrip was very unscrupulous. Later I saw that the price of this hotel was too expensive. , there are many choices around and I regret it a bit.
The third one is the most exciting. I suspected that there were not many guests staying in the hotel, so the yogurt had expired. I took a photo to keep the evidence. Businessmen, don't try to bully me.
A beautiful woman at the next table ate half of her breakfast and started vomiting. Finally, she found out that the fried dough sticks were sour. At that moment, I wanted to vomit too. I have never eaten sour fried dough sticks in my life.
Overall, I can't give it a thumbs up, so that's it.

The hotel also provides free pick-up and drop-off services. The hotel allows guests to choose the time to go to the airport and the lobby. There was hot tea and lemonade. Xiaojuan served hot tea to me and my friend when we checked in. This little bit of service made me feel good. The hotel lobby is high-end and very clean. You can order meals in the hotel or have them delivered to your room. The nearby shopping mall is a little far, but it is understandable that it is near the airport. You can take a taxi to Huadong Market in the evening and there are many night market stalls for you to choose from. There are many, very cost-effective, and the service is great. Breakfast is from 7 to 10 in the morning. You can have breakfast in a buffet style on the first floor of the hotel. It feels good. There are steamed, stir-fried, fried, and deep-fried. There are also many choices for drinks, such as soy milk. , milk and juice, the room size is suitable, the layout is reasonable, the room is clean and tidy, the shower and bathroom are separated from wet and dry, the quality of toiletries is also good, disposable supplies including razors are very complete, the room has water, tea bags and coffee bags, the room Relatively quiet and close to the airport after all. This experience made me feel satisfied and comfortable. The hotel's services, facilities, environment, etc. are pretty good. Business people or those catching a flight can choose to stay here.

房間也挺乾淨的 前台服務也不錯 就是因為出發比較早
