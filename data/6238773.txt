The large living area gives you an opportunity to relax and snack in comfort as if you were at home. The fantastic location gives you central access to everything you could want to do in Shanghai.

If you’re in for making your own meals rather than eating out every night, you must come to the place as they have everything you need, from oven to stove to dishwasher to all sort of kitchen utensils.

Also, I loved the bathtub. Clean and spacious. Period. 

Very convenient too. Just a few steps away from the Lujziachui station, the new town of Pudong. About 20 minutes by foot to the Bund or just take a cab. DiDi is fairly reasonable.

msg:A Pleasant Stay at IFC Residence in Shanghai

I recently had the opportunity to stay at the IFC Residence in Shanghai for two nights, from September 25th to 27th. Overall, my experience was quite positive, with several notable aspects that made my stay enjoyable.

First and foremost, the location of the IFC Residence is incredibly convenient, situated in Lujiazui, Pudong. Being connected to the IFC shopping center allowed for easy access to a wide range of dining, shopping, and entertainment options right at my doorstep. The vibrant atmosphere of the area added to the overall appeal of the hotel.

The room I stayed in offered a stunning view, which was undoubtedly one of the highlights of my stay. It provided a picturesque backdrop of Shanghai's iconic skyline, creating a memorable and visually pleasing experience. I was also impressed by the room's condition, considering its age. The maintenance and cleanliness were commendable, showcasing the hotel's commitment to providing a comfortable and well-kept environment for guests.

Throughout my stay, the staff at IFC Residence exhibited a high level of hospitality. They were friendly, approachable, and always ready to assist with any inquiries or requests I had. Their helpfulness greatly contributed to the overall positive impression I had of the hotel.

While my experience was largely positive, I did notice a minor area for improvement. The housekeeping service could pay more attention to vacuuming the rooms thoroughly. Although the overall cleanliness was satisfactory, a more meticulous approach to cleaning would have enhanced the overall experience.

Additionally, I would like to mention that I found a better room rate through Trip.com compared to the official website of IFC Residence. This highlights the advantage of utilizing Trip.com for booking accommodations, as it provided me with a cost-saving opportunity without compromising on the quality of my stay.

In conclusion, my stay at IFC Residence in Shanghai was a pleasant and enjoyable one. The hotel's convenient location, captivating views, well-maintained rooms, and friendly staff contributed to a positive experience overall. With some minor improvements in the housekeeping service and the ability to find competitive rates through platforms like Trip.com, I would highly recommend IFC Residence for a comfortable and convenient stay in Shanghai.

Location is superb right in ifc mall with two metro lines 2 & 14 which can bring you to airport, railway station and all sorts of tourist places. The only thing is smoking smell in the room though every room is claimed non smoking room.

I was supposed to have the online meeting in the room during the trip but the wifi signal was totally not stable and it was a very bad meeting experience. Apart from that, it’s still a good stay overall but I would be very cautious if you need to do online conference from the room.

Terrible thing I find is hotel doesn’t have free parking. 
14 yuan / Hour  or 112 Yuan / Day. 

Breakfast…very limited options, 3 star standard. 
Yogurt packets were at last date of Expiry date (25 Days)  

Room was very clean 👍🏻

Recommendable for people who ain’t driving by themself and looking for service apartment only.

The living room was comfortable and spacious and my older kids loved sharing a room and having their own bathroom. Nice big tub and the amenities in the kitchen made it easy to cook small meals and heat up restaurant leftovers. There is a grocery store in the bottom floor of the mall so we were able to pop downstairs to stock up on fruit, snacks and drinks to enjoy in the room. Very close to the pearl tower and the Shanghai Ocean Aquarium. We will definitely stay again!

msg:I recently stayed at IFC Residence and while the accommodations were comfortable and the staff were friendly, I was disappointed with breakfast. 

The breakfast buffet was particularly disappointing. The prive fir breakfast was ¥178, but the food was unappetizing, and the selection was limited. 

Despite the disappointing food, the hotel itself was clean and well-maintained. The room was spacious and comfortable, and the staff were helpful and accommodating. The location was also convenient, with easy access to nearby attractions and restaurants.

Overall, while I would recommend IFC Residence for its accommodations and service, I would caution against dining at the hotel's restaurant. There are many other dining options in the area that offer better quality and value.

The pillows were nice and comfortable and the quilt covers were fluffy and cosy. Regarding the in-room big fridge and freezer, kitchen equipment and various cutlery, they were all fully functional and complete. I think the most important point I have observed which is every traveller's main concern is the full control of the air-conditioning within the rooms. There were two separate air-conditioning controls for the living space and bedroom itself. No longer you will suffer the hot stuffy air-con which refuses to lower temps even after adjusting unlike in other hotels (including 5/6 stars hotels I've stayed in the past) which uses central duct as an excuse. IFC air-con is the best and coldest so far.... just this alone gets my vote for best in class! For travellers who care about air-con temps within their rooms, look no further.

Hospitality is superb.  Stephen, Edith fm the Reception, David who came twice for some housekeeping matters, and the cleaning ladies on the 20F and the swimming pool , all are more than wonderful and kind. 

The 2-bed flat is spacious although it may not be as big as 150 m^2 (measured by construction area?). Good enough for us 4.  Kitchen is a decent bonus for our 6-day stay coz we don’t hv to dine out for every single meal. 

Anyway, a perfect stay and will come back again!  Great thanks to all at IFC Residence who have made our very first post-Covid home visit a memorable one.

The personnel were constantly confused about the COVID-19 policies and provided us wrong instructions. For example, they said that they would bring the breakfast to our room since they believed we were in the home monitoring period. I informed we were not three times but the info wasn't shared amongst the staff members.

Lastly, the breakfast is acceptable but rather simple. It was simple compared with the one from other 4-5 stars hotels.

To sum, such a great and efficient place to stay if you are on a business trip. If you expect a luxurious hotel experience, this is not the option.

The 2 bedroom, 150m² room was definitely smaller than that. It was more like 100m², however the apartment is spacious enough for 2-4 people. It's perfect for families or friends who are traveling together. We loved having access to a nearly fully equipped kitchen (no can opener). The breakfast was the only bad thing. Old, stale bread, cheap Spam, and processed cheese. You're better off booking a room without breakfast and then just prepare your own food in your kitchen. There's a City Super in the basement of the IFC mall where you can buy groceries, there's also a Little RAC that has tasty breakfast sandwiches and French crepes. If the hotel made a little effort to improve the breakfast quality, then it would truly be a 5 star experience. I would definitely book the apartment again, and recommend it to others who want a more spacious place to stay than what most 4 or 5 star hotels offer, and because it was an overall good experience.

msg:The service is extremely friendly and welcoming. They indulged us in providing us with a room high up with a nice view when we requested. The main living room and adjoining patio is awesome to lounge in, read a book, recharge devices or do work and so on. You could also pass by and get fresh coffee/tea and cookies basically any time during the day. The outdoor patio has lounge chairs lined with comfortable cushions and lovey plants. The garden area is lovely but could do with a little bit of upkeep. We did not use the gym but it looked great and well-kept. We really enjoyed our time in the pool, which also had some jacuzzis nearby and good locker-room facilities. If you go early in the morning, you won't have to contend with any people and can get some awesome views just to yourself. The room itself had ample storage space and practical items such as pots, cutlery, washing machine, convention oven and so on. The only thing was there would be a small wafting from the bathroom from time to time- perhaps from the pipes? We had a great time exploring the nearby bund and river area and there were a lot of food options available. I would only advice that you watch your timing of your visit if you are not a fan of crowds (ie- public holidays), as the residences are located next to many popular attractions. Other than that, I recommend whole-heartedly!

And before the trip, I read reviews from people that the rooms did not correspond to the declared footage, and I specifically clarified this issue 2 weeks in advance, and they confirmed to me that the footage was 95 meters. In general, it was very crowded, the audibility was very strong.

For example, how to use the equipment in the room, the afternoon tea experience in the lobby, etc., can be presented to the guests one by one, which is more in place. There are fewer kitchen utensils in the room. There is no dishwasher in the small room. The smart toilet uses cold water for washing. It's too disappointing. The most important thing is that the subway is Line 14 Exit 8, not Line 2. I understand that Line 2 will be a selling point, but provide accurate information so that guests can judge, and they will not choose your hotel because it is not Line 2. Thank you.

The only big drawback is that the pillows are too hard, heavy, and high, and have zero elasticity. After staying for four nights, my neck is a bit stiff. The cleaning was very good, the dishes we used were washed every day, and the vacuum cleaner was very careful. The location is convenient, close to the subway station, but it is best not to use the entrance and exit connected to IFC, which is too circuitous. Although the view from the room cannot see the Oriental Pearl Tower, it can see the entire financial district. The view is wide and really good.

The best advantage is that four people can split the room into two rooms and enjoy the living room and kitchen. If you want to find it inside Ifc mall, look for Louis Vuitton. It's hard to find the entrance. If you go all the way inside Louis Vuitton, there is the entrance to the residence. There's a supermarket in the basement, and it's nice that most Chinese food is delivered to Waimai. Delivery is accepted in the lobby.

msg:Let’s talk about the poor experience first. As shown in the picture, the check-in area at the front desk is a bit messy. Secondly, I am curious to provide an ID card but can check in without swiping my face to verify the ID card. Because I have a baby who is over one year old, I originally planned to have two rooms on the 7th floor. When I arrived at the front desk at around 2 o'clock, the cleaning was not done. In order to make it easier for the baby to sleep, I was given a room on the 5th floor that was already ready. I thought it was two floors away. It doesn’t matter anymore. As a result, as soon as my aunt entered the bedroom with the baby and my parents were watching TV on the sofa, I heard the sound of flying insects hitting the bookshelf in the opposite direction. When I saw a huge cockroach with wings, the family was speechless. My parents beat me for a long time and they didn't die. I was scared to death. I called the front desk and the waiter confirmed that the cockroaches were there and called the front desk to confirm and take pictures. After about 10 minutes, it was probably the manager or something who brought food and apologized, saying that the cockroaches might have escaped due to the hotel's disinfection in March. Yes, this reason is really far-fetched. Anyway, there is such a big cockroach flying in the house. I am very curious about how it came and what kind of environment it was like to have such a big cockroach. The solution is to change rooms.
The good thing is the location of the hotel. You can go directly to the shopping mall on the 3rd floor. If you ask for a crib, it will be provided promptly. The concierge will help with your luggage. The breakfast is neither good nor bad, but it may be more expensive than the price for one night. The location is right.

The advantage of the apar**ent-style apar**ent here is that the one-bedroom apar**ent has a separate living room and bedroom. And there is a kitchen where you can cook. The location is very good, you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower from the hotel room. You can go directly to the Guojin Mall from the hotel, and across the mall is the Oriental Pearl Tower. Overall I am quite satisfied.

Moreover, dining and entertainment are also rich and convenient. Connected to the IFC mall, there is a cinema downstairs, shopping and entertainment programs are also arranged. We requested to check out later, and the front desk quickly arranged it at 1:30, which provided us with some convenience. But this time I asked to prepare a bedding for my son. When I opened the bedding, I found 5-6 large and small stains, which was shocking. Definitely call the front desk. The service was very fast, and someone came immediately to change the bedding with clean ones. But I feel that as a 5-star hotel apar**ent, it is really inappropriate to give out such bedding to guests. If it is just one place that is not conspicuous, I think it is understandable, but if it is so obvious and multiple, it feels like the hotel has cheapened. In addition, I asked for a small square towel to wash my face, and the front desk said that it had been reported, but the hotel did not prepare it. Small square towels should be easier to prepare and provide than large towels, and they are also a must-have for 5-star hotels. I really hope that the details can be more user-friendly to make guests more comfortable during their stay.

In particular, the service staff took the initiative to offer help, which gave my family and I a wonderful experience in Shanghai. thank you all! Especially the lovely Katee and another male colleague♫
My family and I are very much looking forward to staying at IFC again next time.

msg:Not really.
It’s not like I’ve stayed at Guojin once or twice. Maybe I didn’t have high expectations before, so so... Well, now it’s getting more and more perfunctory and worse. It’s so bad that I can’t help but leave a negative review! First of all, none of the service staff at the front desk served with a polite smile, nor did they say hello. They seemed to have no energy to say even one more word. They were so reluctant, so your reception center should be changed to a fully automatic one! That male waiter, I stayed here for two days. Every time I see your image, I don't want to stay in the lobby anymore. I call the front desk to ask for cleaning. It's also very unfriendly. Also, female waiter, Peggy, am I remembering correctly? What are you doing in Gaogui? Is this my first time staying in all star hotels in Shanghai? I don’t think your communication with foreigners is like this~ Why, do you look down on your Chinese compatriots? The room I was given was also very poor, a lot of dust, and the shower head in the shower room was broken. I was too lazy to give feedback. Can you adjust the service to my satisfaction? I think certainly not. Before leaving, I heard you discussing holiday travel. After leaving this job, you are also an ordinary consumer. Thinking from my perspective, I don’t know whether you have requirements for travel and what kind of communication and feedback services you expect... Finally, I Want to say. If this job cannot give you a sense of value, then China International Finance Apar**ent will always be eliminated in the era of industry involution.

msg:This hotel is really cost-effective
Let’s talk about the location first: it’s adjacent to China National Capital Corporation, so it’s an excellent location in Lujiazui.
Let's talk about the facilities: When I walked in, I felt like a high-end apar**ent. When I went up to the reception hall on the third floor, I felt like I had entered a rest area, and then I could enter the floors of various rooms. The style is a mix of classic + modern. It is a decoration style that is more in line with many people's aesthetics.
The room space can be said to be very large and the functions are very complete. After all, it is an apar**ent hotel.
As for the price, the price of more than 1,000 yuan in this location can be said to be very worthwhile!
I will choose this hotel next time I get together with friends!

Clothes and pants were left in the room, but the hotel did not take the initiative to contact me. I contacted the front desk on the same day and said that I had looked for it but there was no reply. I contacted the hotel again the next day and was told that it was not there. Only later did I get a message back saying that I had found it. Does your guest room cleaning staff not provide feedback on items left behind by guests? The front desk does not proactively contact guests. Is there any item missing? Is this the service of a 5-star hotel?

However, as soon as I entered the door, I felt very cramped and crowded. It didn't feel like 95 square meters at all, so I used an Apple rangefinder to measure the area. The total of the measured data is less than 50 square meters. It was explained that the marked area is the building area, so you should indicate the building area and not the usable area before booking. The difference is really outrageous. In addition, he called me before one o'clock the next morning to urge me to check out, and even threatened to pay an extra day if I didn't check out. According to the law, consumers can check in at 2 o'clock, so they should check out at 2 o'clock at the latest. Our room rate is charged for 24 hours, and the service attitude is very poor.

Furthermore, since it is a hotel-style apar**ent, should the washing machine be equipped with some washing powder, and the pots, pans and spoons should be equipped with dishwashing liquid, should there be a dishcloth. Can the soundproofing of the room be done more seriously? Standing in the corridor, you can hear voices in the bathroom. Is it too embarrassing? Generally speaking, apart from the good location, the price/performance ratio is really average.

After the engineering depar**ent came to repair it, it stopped making noise. However, the air conditioner did not seem to produce much air, and this problem should have been solved before check-in. After we checked in, we found that the air conditioner made abnormal noise, and the hotel staff came The processing speed was quite timely and the attitude was good, but shouldn't we change rooms in this situation? In the middle of the night, the child told me that there was a small white spider on the bed. I guess it was because the air vent net was removed when the air conditioner was being repaired and the spider fell off. In short, the facilities are old. The pillows on the second bed are a bit high and not suitable for small children to sleep on. The hotel's takeout cannot be delivered. The hotel has a robot on the third floor, but not on the first floor, so it cannot be delivered. Hotel parking is also charged.

So, even if you have children, it's good even if you don't like Chinese food. However, after actually making a reservation on trip.com (it seems to be linked to c-trip based on Chinese standards), it is a system that requires a deposit of 2200 yuan at check-in and returns it after deducting the accommodation fee based on Chinese standards at check-out. As a person who received a discount through trip.com, it was as if I paid for it and used it haha ​​Please keep this in mind.

Great Metro connection.
There are really only little things I would like to point out. The hotel is in an area that is simply amazing Shanghai Tower on the left and Orietal Pearl Tower on the right. The rooms are also very nice. What should be noted is that there were no sewing kits in the room and no minibar. I only say that because the location was so great. If you book the hotel you are not doing anything wrong, on the contrary you will smile slightly and then mentally agree with me. I highly recommend it. So don't let my review put you off, it should make you curious. Ok have fun in the hotel you will definitely not be looking after it.
Oh yes, we stayed at the hotel as a family.

It was said that the room was 71 square meters, but it actually felt very cramped and could barely fit a crib. The room had a kitchen countertop, which was almost useless, and there were no toiletries or even a glass of water for brushing teeth. The breakfast is also not suitable for a five-star hotel. What's even worse is that the hotel doesn't care about guests' parking. They parked in the hotel parking lot on the second floor for one night and were charged 128 yuan for parking. After paying the deposit, the balance was not refunded in time after check-out. I called to ask and was told that it would take 1-3 working days to arrive. It's better not to stay in such a hotel.

msg:The toilet in the hotel is broken, and it cannot be said to be broken. It means that after flushing the toilet, the toilet will continue to flow if you are not careful, and there will always be noise of water absorption. You need to open the toilet lid and move the water absorption. , Put it down, it will be fine (it will be in this state three or four times out of ten, not every time it is broken) I don’t know if other rooms are like this, anyway, there is a problem with the room I live in. This is the second time I have stayed in this hotel. The room I stayed in for the first time was fine, so I must judge from my heart. We stayed in a two bedroom room and my friend teased me that after staying in this hotel I would be a professional toilet repairman. In the other bathroom, the button of the toilet is very tight. It will be even more difficult for a lady who has a slightly longer manicure to go to the toilet. Going to the toilet is very laborious. And the paper in the toilet is really really poor quality and so thin. I have stayed in so many hotels, and I have never seen such a thin paper in the toilet. The paper shattered with a little water. There is no resilience at all, and it is seriously suspected that there is a problem with the procurement of this hotel. What kind of paper did I buy? I forgot to bring wet toilet paper when I went to the toilet. I made it so thick, and I tried to wipe it clean with some water, but it broke immediately. Also, this hotel has to pay at the store. I have charged the card on Ctrip, which can be used in general hotels, but not at other hotels. I am sorry that they can only pay at the store. It's all about paying anyway, why can't we give customers a little more convenience? Some customers just recharge their cards on Ctrip and just want to pay directly. It’s so old and it’s not flexible at all. Except for these problems, the rest are pretty good. The aunt who cleans the room is very nice, and the service is still very good. I have never given such a detailed evaluation to others. It really annoys me to go to the toilet to fix the toilet!

Service: The service is also very ok, and someone will help you with your luggage. In short, it feels more like a hotel

Location: The location is easy to find, the only thing is that there is no free parking lot

Floor: You have to pick up the food by yourself, and you have to go through 2 elevators to go to the room. You can only go to the dining room on the 3rd floor at one time, and you can go through the entire dining room to get to the second elevator, which is actually quite troublesome.

Room: The room is very big and the view is ok. I originally booked a one-bedroom deluxe room. The hotel has upgraded to a two-bedroom. The lobby is very large. The script* eats everything is ok. There are kitchens, dishes, ovens, etc., which are pretty good. The room service is also very good

Summary: very satisfied

All-day flour freshly ground coffee, small biscuits, Sprite Coke, great!

Insufficient, there is a lot of wind noise after the room air conditioner is turned off. If the sleep quality is not good, try to choose the bottom floor. The cleaning of the room is very unprofessional. The slippers are not updated after staying for three days, because the bathroom does not have slippers for bathing, causing children Every time I finished washing the slippers, they were still wet. I left a message on the phone on the third day. It turned out that the small soap was not replenished, so I put a piece of it on the second day, and I didn’t put it in the future. The things are worthless, so you don’t have to. The small soap was very problematic for our family to wash our hands when we came back. It was delivered 40 minutes after calling customer service.

msg:Much better than expected. The problem of obsolete facilities mentioned in the reviews actually does not exist. The overall environment is very well maintained. The public area on the third floor is particularly comfortable for resting. The coffee machine and hot water supply can meet the needs. It feels like staying in a hotel. The overall quality of the guests is also relatively high. Many of them are families, which shows that the hotel is suitable for both young and old guests. It is very quiet at night and has a good rest. When I checked out, it was already past the 12 o'clock check-out time because I was packing my things. There was no rush at the front desk, the overall experience was very good, and the hotel’s first-class location is really worth staying at.

The location of the hotel is very good, it is very convenient to go everywhere, shopping or takeaway are ok. We brought our own food to eat hot pot in the hotel, but the hot pot is brought by ourselves. Other tableware and so on are from the hotel.
The view of the treadmill in the gym is very good, but the only pity is that I am too weak to walk recently. . .
The swimming pool is very good, and there are also dry and wet steam rooms (although not big), but 2-3 people can sit.
It's a good choice to go for a walk along the riverside, and I can't help but choose this place for every family gathering. The letter price ratio is super high!

I went to have breakfast this morning. The scenery outside the dining window is beautiful, and the ingredients are fresh and exquisite. Except for cold meals, hot meals are covered with heat preservation. The most important thing is that the staff come to ask about needs from time to time. They are polite and thoughtful. Sitting in the restaurant is also a kind of enjoy. Love the front desk, concierge, breakfast and room service of IFC Serviced Apar**ents.

Truly a home away from home. With this hotel, even if you don’t need any nanny, you can easily travel with your children. When you come home every day, the tableware on the dining table is cleaned by the cleaning staff. I really admire the service here, especially the receptionist. All of them are very warm and considerate to the guests. I hope this hotel will continue to have a prosperous business, and the guests come like a cloud. I express my infinite love.

The downside is that parking costs money, and the price has increased. Many downtown hotels will subsidize parking fees, but IFC does not. Then you can basically only look at the swimming pool. It is too shallow and can easily hurt your toes.

msg:The location of the hotel is good. There is a special entrance connected to the IFC Mall. The nearest subway exit from the main entrance is Exit 10 of Lujiazui Station. When checking in in the lobby on the first floor, some residents lost their mobile phones and called the police, so the check-in process was a bit embarrassing. To get to the room, you need to go to the living room on the third floor to change to the elevator. The overall privacy and security are good.

Room Facilities:
It has been open for a long time, but after entering the room as a whole, I feel that the maintenance is not bad (unfortunately, the chain was lost later), the floor height of the room is not high, but the overall decoration style still feels very warm, and the kitchen appliances and kitchen utensils are also readily available. , Whether it is a short-term rental or a long-term rental, it is a good choice. Bad reviews for the bathroom. There is a strong odor coming from the drain of the bathtub. The bathtub needs to be plugged and water-tight to prevent the smell from wafting out.

swimming pool:
Guojinhui's own swimming pool is currently under maintenance, and hotel guests can take their room cards to the fitness center at the Ritz-Carlton next door.

Unexpected episode:
As shown in the accompanying picture, when I came back from the outside at night, I stepped on a large puddle of water and slipped for a while. After a closer look, I found that the line from the oven to the sink to the door was full of water... It was not long after I finally wiped it dry. Water all over the place [wiping sweat] In the end, I had no choice but to contact the front desk to change the room in the middle of the night. The air conditioner in the newly changed room had problems with the heating and kept blowing cool wind. room.

The breakfast is not up to the standard of a 5 star hotel. There are few varieties and the taste is not good. For example, the croissant is very dry, but it is still very large and cut into 2 small pieces. The Shanghai wonton is the most unpalatable wonton, and it does not look good. It's really not good.

If you want to live in a hotel-style apar**ent with such a good location, such a great view, and a suite with simple cooking at this price point, I'm afraid there is really only IFC. I accidentally found the hotel on Ctrip, so I decided to come and experience it, and it turned out that I came to the right place. I am very satisfied with both the service of the staff and the design of the room. If you are not looking for the ultimate scenery of a three-piece high-rise hotel in Lujiazui (the scenery of Guojinhui is not bad), it is really recommended to choose Guojinhui, because you can hardly find a level like Guojinhui at this price.

The service is very attentive and meticulous.

Lujiazui is also relatively quiet at night, the floor is not too high to sleep well. Maybe now that I have grown up, I no longer like the noisy feeling of the Bund, but rather appreciate the quiet, down to earth feeling. The service is very good. The beautiful and handsome guys at the front desk are warm and just right and very comfortable. The chill room is also very big. After all, it is a serviced apar**ent. The feeling is that if you want to rent a service apar**ent in Shanghai for a long time in the future, you will choose ifc!

So, in this Mid-Autumn Festival, come and enjoy the experience of watching the moon from the sky with your family.
The family is very satisfied with this stay. I have to say that Guojinhui is definitely the most cost-effective hotel in Lujiazui: the three-piece suite can cure cervical spondylosis, the large unobstructed glass window in the room can enjoy 180 degrees of CBD, the river view in the second row has a unique flavor, and the kitchen The tableware is V&B, the kitchen utensils are Miji, the swimming pool on the 25th floor is sunny and there are two lifeguards to keep an eye on the safety of tourists, the gym on the top floor is fully equipped, and there is also a separate yoga room...
The waiter at the door, the receptionist at the front desk, and the service staff in the room are all enthusiastic and efficient. If you have any questions, you can answer them at any time and solve them as soon as possible in a short time, which is quite good. Even nucleic acid testing in special times is very fnag

Every time I go out, the concierge staff will open the door in time to help tourists with their luggage. The key point is: the current hotel does not provide dine-in. Breakfast will be delivered to the room as early as 08:00 at the request of the customer. The lobby on the third floor now only provides coffee☕️ and hot water, and the terrace at night can take an invincible "3-piece set". The water quality of the swimming pool on the 25th floor is clean. There were only 3 people when I went there (there was only 1 person on the birthday the previous year, like a reserved venue)

Environment: The location is excellent. There is a small door leading to the Guojin Mall. It is in the center of Lujiazui and is very convenient to various office buildings.


Service: I would like to praise Mia at the front desk. I booked separate rooms for two nights, but she actually remembered me and arranged the same room for me twice. She also remembered that I didn’t need a comb for toiletries. The entire check-in and check-out experience was perfect.

I could only take a taxi from the only open door in the mall to return to the hotel entrance. At that time, I was very tired and very late. I didn't know how to go out of the mall. I called the front desk of the hotel. Complaint trouble please contact me during working hours the next day to tell me the result of the complaint. In the end, no one contacted until check out. In a hurry, no further pursuit. But a hotel opened in ifc has good hardware conditions, but the software service is not in place. Since your parking space is connected to the shopping mall, you must consider how the driving guests will return to the hotel after the shopping mall is closed. Or a warm reminder when you check in? Anyway, I didn't feel that the hotel was trying to solve it after receiving customer help or complaints!

What I want to complain about is the service. The hotel front desk service is too poor to answer questions. When I asked them the opening time of the swimming pool, they answered impatiently: What is the opening time? When I went to the swimming pool in the morning, the receptionist at the front desk also had a bitter face, no smile, no greeting, no goodbye, and a cold look.

msg:The security guard at the so-called valet parking at the entrance of the mall is particularly poor, with an arrogant attitude, deliberately pretending to be stupid, I gave him a tip of 100 yuan, and immediately nodded and bowed, very speechless. The checkin at the hotel is also dumbfounded, a kind of fake politeness, that is, the surface is to provide services, but in my heart I feel that you are a woolen yarn. Haha, sorry, maybe the understanding is wrong, but others can still see the insincerity. In the hotel cafeteria, you can make coffee by yourself in the afternoon and evening. When you go out, turn right and walk along a tree-lined path. The nucleic acid testing booth is 100 meters away, which is more convenient. The room facilities are old but clean. There is nothing for children to play with. I stayed here for a few days during the decoration of my home. It can only be so-so. The location is better. The ifc downstairs is convenient for shopping and eating. Parking and drinking ritz are not free, I can only say that Guojin is a bull~

You can also buy the food you need in the city supermarket. The handsome guy at the front desk arranged for us a green space suite on the 20th floor. The beautiful scenery outside the window was full of views. My mother was so excited and squinted with joy; the suite had all the facilities. We bought all kinds of ingredients from the supermarket downstairs and used the price. In the induction cooker inside, we made the original hot pot, we made it in the living room, through the large glass window, while enjoying the scenery while tasting the delicious food, it was very pleasant. The bathroom here is clean and comfortable. In this winter, the warm toilet lid makes the elderly feel warmer. Thank you IFC Hotel Apar**ent, a very good experience, my mother said that I will stay here some days later, because the oven in the room must be used next time 😂😂

The location is indeed very convenient. It is in the IFC and connected to the mall. It has been raining in the past few days, so it is more convenient to go to the mall for dinner.
Relying on the Oriental Pearl Tower alone, it is convenient to take a walk along the river, but the weather is not good.
The service is good, the luggage and attitude are okay.
Sanitation is also good, there is a mini children's playground on the 26th floor, which can be regarded as a time to pass.

It is estimated that it is more suitable for long-term residents. There is a supermarket in the mall downstairs. You can buy all kinds of fresh food, but there are no seasonings in the room. If you are hungry for a short stay, you might as well buy instant noodles at the convenience store on the first floor of the Financial Building opposite. It will be faster. The pillows are either high or low. I asked for a buckwheat pillow or latex pillow for room service, but there is still only a thin layer of buckwheat pillow. . .

I don't like that some hotels set the front desk on the 10th or 20th floors, and you have to change the elevator every time you go in and out. This one is good, the front desk is only on the first floor, and then you have to take the elevator to the third floor for no reason to change, isn't it annoying? The gym is small and the equipment is old. The room facilities are also very old, the air conditioner is so noisy that I can't sleep well, and when I open the door, there is a damp smell that can't go away. The breakfast should be the worst in a hotel of the same price, not one of them. The worst thing was that the invoice was issued wrongly. I said that I will send it back to you now. You should issue me the correct one first. I will pay the bill the next day. No, I have to receive it before I can issue it again. I just want to ask, it is your fault. Or I was wrong, I should have chosen the wrong one, can I not go back next time?

(위챗 아마수작 미니프로그램을 통해 포장 예약 이용 추천) 도보로 15분 정도 거리에 새벽 늦은 시간까지 영업하는 하이디라오가 위치해있어 상하이에 입국한 날 늦은 시간에도 식사할 수 있었습니다. 룸서비스의 비용도 한국에 비해서 아주 합리적인 편이었습니다.😊
공항에서 호텔로 택시를 이용했는데 택시 사기를 당할 뻔 했으나 호텔 직원의 도움으로 어느 정도 해결할 수 있었던 점에 진심으로 감사드립니다. 직원들의 영어 실력이 훌륭한 편은 아니었으나 어느 정도 소통 가능한 정도였고 번역기를 사용해 크게 무리없이 이용했습니다. 샤워 가운이 모자라서 전화로 요청드렸는데 늦은 시간에도 룸까지 직접 가져다주셔서 친절하다고 생각했습니다. 체크아웃 후 짐보관서비스도 편리하게 이용했습니다. 
3인 투숙이어서 주니어 스위트룸을 이용했는데 룸 상태도 깨끗하고 침구류도 잘 정돈되어있고 푹신해서 좋았습니다. 거실의 소파도 편안하고 레지던스 특성 상 취식도 가능하여 주방의 조리기구를 사용할 수 있어 좋았습니다. (칼의 날 상태는 무딘 편이었음) 환상적인 야경뷰도 좋았지만 무엇보다 호텔의 실내수영장의 수질이 굉장히 깨끗해서 만족스러웠습니다. 샤워실에 건식, 습식 사우나도 있고 다이슨 헤어드라이기가 2대가 있어 호텔에 머무는 동안 매일 이용했습니다.
다시 상하이에 방문하게 된다면 이용하고 싶은 호텔이라 적극 추천드립니다😄👍
중국 특성 상 편의점이 많지 않은데다 주변 건물과 도로 규모가 넓고 큰 편이어서 편의시설을 찾는 것은 어렵습니다.😂

停車也沒有優惠
酒店是很缺錢嗎？？？好歹豪華酒店至於打印也要賺這個錢嗎😧

個人感覺服務挺好的，前台的工作人員都很禮貌周到，不像有評價説態度不好之類的（入住前還擔心來着），check-in的時候會主動詢是否需要一次性牙具和刮鬍刀，退房時開發票也很快。
不足：房間內衞生有待提高，我們共住了5晚，幾乎每天都遇到點客服清潔不完善的情況。第二天更換後的浴巾上出現黃色長髮（我們都是黑短髮），有一天少給一條浴巾，面巾紙盒空了也並沒有填充。唯一好的是打電話到前台後處理的很及時。

🧹衞生：房間總的來説算乾淨。衣櫃裏面、地板都擦的很乾凈。但是能看出有些年頭了。用的地毯，就大家都心知肚明啦～廚房裡油煙機上有些成年老垢。

🍃環境：實際房間比照片裏看起來小，擺了傢俱之後，基本就衹能過人，塞的很滿檔。孩子們的lego小零件掉到傢俱縫縫裡，我們就必須搬開來找，下面的臟的東西也算是在接受範圍之內吧，就是實在太挪不開了，找的很辛苦。房間裏的燈也太暗了！有情調吧可能是。
游泳池很棒，人也不多，孩子們玩的很高興。
酒店跟國金商場在一起，購物、吃飯都很方便。叫外賣需要自己到大門取。

早餐：品種不算豐富。該有的都有一兩樣吧。但是168一個大人的價錢我認為比較坑。


【咖啡廳】下午有免費的咖啡、小餅乾提供。

總體來説地理位子很優越，周圍的設施都很齊全。帶着老老小小的住很棒。下次家庭出遊還會再住！希望酒店可以裝修升級的時候考慮用地板 🤣

想説一下這次入住的體會。
1、早餐，太簡單了。價格是五星酒店的早餐價格，好像是178一位。如果房價裏不含就去別處吃吧。
2、停車，住店客人自理，體驗感很差。
3、房間有異聞，最少是我住的房間有。
