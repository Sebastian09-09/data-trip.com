msg:Breakfast is 15 per person, fried dough sticks, rolls, steamed buns, rice porridge, soy milk, eggs, and 4 hot dishes. There is also a buffet at noon and evening, and the dishes taste good.
The location of the hotel is good, the mountains can be seen in front of the door, the hotel is quite big, the gym, billiards, chess and card rooms are complete, the restaurant is large, and KTV.
There is a free parking lot, and more than a dozen cars can be parked at the door of the guest room. Twenty to thirty cars can be parked at the entrance of the restaurant, stay away from the guest room.
The room facilities are a bit old, with 24 hours hot water, and the water is not too small, but the room is centrally air-conditioned, there is no warm air, it is very cold. However, there is a bathroom heater in the bathroom and electric mattress on the bed. If you can install a split air conditioner and have hot air, it would be great. Just to explain, it's midsummer, and it's really cold here.
There is no separation of dry and wet in the bathroom, it is recommended to add a water retaining ***** and shower curtain. The bathroom door is not closed tightly, and the room is a bit humid. These two days have been cloudy, if it is sunny, the house may not be so humid.
