msg:Hotel is a little old but more importantly, Executive Lounge was closed and shifted to restaurant downstairs. Food options for afternoon tea and cocktail hours had very little variety. Breakfast was only slightly better but still not of Marriott standard. Except for check in which was very good and fast and staff was efficient, otherwise everything else are lacking the Marriott and 5 star standard. What was most preposterous is during breakfast, several guests took the scoop spoon for the sauces and put into the mouth to taste the sauce and then proceeded to put the same spoon back into the same sauce bowl he tasted from. Staff didn‚Äôt do anything at all. I do not think this is acceptable in any part of the world. Quite disappointed overall.

The room itself is good, the house keeping team is very nice. 
The breakfast is not good as the price. Even worse than a 4 star hotel. Most items are lukewarm, not hot and fresh. I had a dinner in the hotel restaurant, the food is bad too.

msg:During the May Day holiday, I chose the Shanghai Hongta Luxury Collection Hotel for my parents. It is a more luxurious brand under Marriott. The hotel is in a great location and the transportation is also very convenient. It was quite late when we arrived at the hotel. The front desk lady Chloe checked us in quickly and helped us upgrade the room. I was very satisfied with the stay. She also took the initiative to provide toothbrushes and combs, etc. She also helped to delay the check-out for free. The service was thoughtful, the breakfast was very rich, and the service staff were neat and tidy. During the stay, my parents felt at home. I am looking forward to staying here next time.

msg:The shower water is very big and comfortable, which is great.
There is only one toilet paper roll next to the toilet, which I have never encountered in other hotels. Obviously, it will cause embarrassment that it cannot be connected. Nowadays, there are usually double toilet paper rolls, and there is a small shelf on it to put wet toilet paper (anal wipes) or mobile phones. This kind of thing that costs tens of dollars should be updated immediately!
Another strange problem is that the water outlet on the wash basin is not horizontal but tilted downward, and then there is an elbow water spout, which is too close to the wall of the porcelain basin. I can't put my hands in to wash my hands, and I can only get water from the toothbrush cup at an angle... Did the water outlet pipe have been pressed down by someone? Or is it caused by the porcelain basin being installed far away from the wall? Luxury brand sanitary ware makes it difficult to wash hands and brush teeth!

Opened 20 years ago and not renovated, the hardware is indeed old, but it can be seen that a lot of money was spent on the renovation. The room size is large, the bedding is very comfortable, and you can see a three-piece suit. Another advantage of an old luxury hotel is that it has a superior location. Everywhere is convenient. The parking in the basement is anti-human, the breakfast is really not good, and the service is not appreciated.

The breakfast every day stunned me. I stayed for several nights in a row, and I didn't see many edible foods when I went to the restaurant at 8 o'clock every morning. There was a long queue, and the seasoning in front of the noodle stall was only a few green onions and a little soy sauce every day. This is the worst hotel I have stayed in. Even ordinary star hotels in small cities have more abundant breakfasts than this. Not to mention that I have always recognized that Luxury Collection is a luxury hotel under Marriott Group. I think Marriott Group should still cherish its own brand.

In the New Year, let yourself fail, don't mention how bad it will be. After I fell, no one came to help me, and no one answered when I called the waiter to mop the floor. It wasn't until I limped over to an employee that anyone touched the dirty spot. The restaurant's occupancy rate was about 80%, so they claimed that there were too many customers and they were too busy, so they were negligent. So what happens when it‚Äôs full? Because you are busy, you can neglect hygiene and let the guests fall and get injured? It‚Äôs really haha. I went to a hotel with my elderly family member, and I was really worried. What would happen if the elderly person fell? !

The other party didn't apologize at all, just turned around and walked away. I immediately reported the situation to the manager, but the matter was left unresolved without any resolution.
The whole thing is very disappointing. Hongta Hotel needs to retrain the restaurant's waiters' professionalism and basic etiquette. A five-star hotel should never have this level of service.
If you don't improve, you will lose a lot of customers.

Breakfast is haphazardly arranged in the banquet hall, with simple and low-end ingredients, which cannot even be compared to ordinary business hotels. It doesn't feel like a five-star hotel in any aspect. Too bad, too bad.

I left something behind at the hotel, and no one contacted me for half a month. I searched for it at home for many days, and then took the initiative to contact the hotel. The call received by the receptionist was very forceful and said that they would not take the initiative to contact me, saying that they were different from other hotels. They are Hongta. Does **** still need to be in the service industry with such arrogance? It's really surprising. Why should you be so angry after spending money on a five-star hotel?

Why is the service poor? It is reflected in the details, let me give a few examples:
1) Did not take the initiative to provide toothpaste and toothbrush when checking in (do not take the initiative to ask)
2) The door card failed, so I went to the first floor to find someone to help solve it. I don‚Äôt know why the staff looked reluctant, and there was no communication during the whole process
3) The bathroom on the first floor is dirty and messy, which is reflected in the cigarette butts in the male bathroom and the dirty toilet

After booking in advance, I was told that I couldn‚Äôt check in at 5:00 pm. I didn‚Äôt say there was a room until late at night. I claimed that all the customers who wanted to check out today would rather pay a fine than check out, probably because they didn‚Äôt make a reservation. FITs give priority to reserve vacant rooms. If you continue to ask the front desk, the waiter will yell at the customer, or just pretend not to hear, it must be the hotel group's instruction. Will never book this hotel again.

The hardware is old, the speed is very slow, and the wifi is ridiculously bad

The service attitude is also extremely bad. The room I booked for my family on May Day was not allowed to be checked in, saying that it was not cleaned up. It was delayed until 6 or 7 in the evening. I came to the front desk to give feedback and said it was very polite, but the front desk kept smiling and ignored me. I don't believe that such arrogance was not taught by the hotel's internal training. If I wasn't busy with work, I really wanted to write an email to the headquarters to complain (Oh, by the way, my boyfriend called to urge the check-in, and the person who answered the phone deliberately said that he would ask about the situation, and then left the phone there for 5 minutes and ignored me. I hung up and called again, and the answer was picked up immediately. It was so funny)

If it wasn't for my family, I would definitely check out immediately and I will never come again!

msg:Very unprofessional room service, turned on the do-not-disturb reminder light when leaving, and the cleaning still came into the room to clean when no one was there! All personal items are not collected, and I feel very offended by being moved! You need to ask for a toothbrush from the front desk separately. On the first day, you will be given a very cheap toothbrush, which is hard to brush your shoes. You have to remember to go to the front desk to ask for it the next day. Originally, I thought the welcome service was very good. Although the room is small, it is acceptable in this location. I would not give a bad review. It is really unacceptable for the cleaning incident. Let's talk about the room in detail. 1. There is no window, and the smell of street stalls is very strong when you first enter the room, and you can't smell it after staying for a long time. There are obvious stains on the office chair and sofa, and I don't know what left them there. 2 The shower room is very small, so small that it hits walls on all sides and bumps from time to time. The most silent thing is the hot water supply. The water temperature is very unstable. After a few minutes of washing, the water will be cold. If you need to re-adjust it, you only need to adjust it 5.6 times after taking a shower. 3 The cold water faucet of the sink and the faucet of the bathtub leaked. At first, I thought I had wet the sink, but later it was found that it was a leak, and the items placed on it were soaked. 4. Items are placed unreasonably. The trash can for sanitary napkins is placed under the sink, but there is no toilet. The trash can in the room is placed under the TV cabinet, which makes it very inconvenient to walk over to throw garbage.

The hardware is very good (the hardware of Pudong hotels is generally better than that of Puxi): the room is big enough, the bathtub is comfortable enough, the big bed is big enough and the bed is big enough, and it is very comfortable; The swimming pool is also very fun. The service staff are very polite and warm, and they also give advice to children, which is very down-to-earth; the breakfast is relatively rich, there are all the things that should be there, both Chinese and Western styles, and the waiters are very polite. Before checking in, I read some bad reviews. It is recommended for guests who often travel on business or high-end travel. The hardware of this hotel should not be able to pick out anything (under the same age), and the service is also good. The only thing that can be picky is that the breakfast may not be as good as The old Puxi five-star, the battle is so big

In addition to the internet speed, I chose this place basically for this chair, so I won‚Äôt get tired after sitting for a long time. By the way, there is also a stereo, although it is useless, it is comfortable to look at.
bed:
For people with a poor waist, it may be slightly softer. I put a pillow under my waist and fell asleep for a long time.
wifi:
The signal is very good, especially there is a network cable in the room to plug in, so happy.
Cost performance:
very high. The hotel is not new, but it can be seen that it was very hard. The price of such a configuration in such a lot is already super affordable.
Location traffic:
Very convenient. But at the same time, I was woken up early in the morning by the sounds of various cars.

msg:The overall hardware configuration of the hotel should be the configuration of a five-star hotel, not to mention the location, I am satisfied with both points. Next, I will talk about the dissatisfaction: 1. The bedding is relatively ordinary, and both pillows are high. People like me who can‚Äôt use a high pillow can only give up the pillow, and the bed is soft and airtight at night. I feel sweat all over my back after sleeping for a while. 2. Breakfast is very average. If you look at the price of 150 yuan, there is no price-performance ratio. The variety is small and the taste is average, which is disappointing. 3. The hotel‚Äôs swimming pool has poor water quality and is relatively muddy. This has a lot to do with the hotel opening the swimming pool to the outside world. After 4 pm, the surrounding residents basically bring their children over for swimming lessons. The coach hurried several times. It is better to open it to hotel guests according to the time period.
Generally speaking, the price-performance ratio of a hotel like this for nearly a thousand stays is gone.

Parking: If you can park on the ground, stop on the ground. The underground parking lot is full of three-dimensional parking facilities. The passage is also very narrow. Large vehicles are advised to leave.
Room: Very old and full of style. 48 square meters is big enough. The bathroom facilities are not well maintained, but the bathtub is big enough for children to play.
