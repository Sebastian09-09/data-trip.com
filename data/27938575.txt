msg:Stayed for one and a half day as our flight is 10 pm the following day.

Room is very clean, with all necessary accessories. Staff were very helpful, which made my life much easier with 5 pieces of luggage and an 80-year old senior.

Lunch is very unique, all pot style, fresh and tasty. We ordered 3 hot dishes plus 2 desserts, totaling about $30. Not too bad.

Light control is a little outdated and can be a little confusing in the beginning. No big deal once you get used to the system. Make sure you adjust the AC to a comfortable level - Xiamen can be very, very humid, at least for the two days we stayed there.

Overall very good experience!

They even upgraded my room at no extra cost because the room that I booked were all taken.  Staff were friendly and courteous. Only thing was they didn't state that the Chinese Tea provided in the room were chargeable.  So ended up paying about 80 Yuan extra for the tea. But no harm done. I did consume the tea.

Staff spoke English well and were more than happy to use a translator if needed. They also gave us a complimentary ride back to the airport the next day. 

Lots of cool restaurants and convenience stores in the area, definitely give them a go if you have time! 

Special mention to Jaren who helped fix up my partner quickly after he fell over and needed some first aid. Very attentive and kind and made sure he was well taken care of.

Will definitely consider staying here again if we are in Xiamen.

Thanks again for the fantastic short visit to Xiamen.

We had a really friendly driver who fetched us to and fro from the airport. He was knowledgeable about xiamen and gave us many suggestions about the various places where we could try good local food.

The room was extremely pleasant - clean and well-prepared, and they even delivered a fruit basket to us!
We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel breakfast too, and the staff was very friendly throughout our time there.

Thank you for this pleasant experience!

msg:Great hotel very close to the Airport. Don’t take a taxi. It was a 13 minute walk. Clean! Nice! The front desk personnel were great and amiable. I came across a friend on the trip who didn’t have lodging, and he was able to join me in my room with no hassle at all after adding him to the room. I lost something very valuable there. They found it, and sent it home for me! Great service! Highly recommend.

msg:This is the Nth time I stayed at the Xiamen Maritime Silk Road Art Center Baixiang Kunshuo Hotel. Since I chose this hotel for the first time when I chose Xiamen Airlines' international connecting flight to Europe, I fell in love with this hotel, the first theme hotel under the Baixiang Hotel Group that uses art as a carrier.
The hotel is located on the beautiful shore of Dailiao Lake, with lake light brushing clouds and egrets. The lake view suite with 270-degree floor-to-ceiling windows allows you to enjoy the beautiful lake without leaving your home. Or you can walk to the lakeside through the sky bridge behind the hotel. In the evening, many citizens start walking, square dancing, and relaxing by the lake. It is so lively.
It is adjacent to the Maritime Silk Road Art Center, just a step away from art. Each room has a different art theme. There is a carefully handwritten introduction to the art of this room on the desk. Every time you stay in a different room, you will have a different artistic impact, which will give you extra artistic influence and enjoyment during the trip, making the journey more pleasant. The hotel lobby, restaurant, and guest room corridors are filled with books. You can encounter an artistic anecdote everywhere in the fragrance of books, allowing passengers to be in the artistic atmosphere, taste the charm of culture, admire the beauty of creativity, and enjoy a convenient flight journey.
It is only 600 meters away from Takasaki Airport T3 Terminal and only 10 minutes by car from T4 Terminal. The hotel displays real-time flights and provides free airport pick-up and drop-off services. The pick-up and drop-off masters are warm, thoughtful and considerate, making people feel the warmth and peace of mind of family, boarding the plane calmly, and the convenience of the journey is within reach. The rooms are spacious, reasonably designed, well-equipped, with separate bathrooms, external washbasins, sofa leisure areas, desk business areas, wine glasses and tea sets, and high-speed Wi-Fi without lag.
The extra surprise this time was that "Jeli·Cantonese Zhezhebao·Guangzhou-style cured meat claypot rice (Takasaki Airport Branch)" was staying at the hotel. You can enjoy authentic Cantonese cuisine without leaving the hotel. I tried it at night. The claypot rice was very authentic and the service was warm and thoughtful, but the ingredients were a bit salty.
In short, the service was as warm and thoughtful as always after staying there for many times, and the price was reasonable. I will choose her again when I transit in Xiamen in the future.

It took less than ten minutes to reach the International Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan Departure Hall. The transportation is really convenient.
The whole hotel building is full of artistic a**osphere, worthy of the name of "Art Hotel".
In terms of software, everyone from the front desk to the cleaning lady is very polite, and they greet each other with a smile.

msg:Booking: In the past, the company arranged accommodation in Lushan. We decided to stay near the airport for easy boarding. After booking, we called to inquire about the check-in time. The answers and arrangements were satisfactory, 10 points

Check-in: Convenient location, taxi directly to the door, no concierge or porter, only security to help open the door, no luggage, 8 points,

Room: The facilities lack uninterruptible power supply. The front desk suggested giving an extra card for power supply to ensure that the room power supply is uninterrupted. Other equipment is basically complete, only live TV, no movies or on-demand, 8 points

Hygiene: Basically satisfied, but the decorative pillows have some stains. It was originally a icing on the cake, but it made people feel uneasy. It is better to remove it! 6 points

Soundproofing: This is a key issue. The windows are very soundproof, but the soundproofing near the bed is very poor. At 23:00 on the first day, the guest next door entered the room, and the sound of the door closing was enough to wake people up. The sound of the wardrobe door opening was also very obvious. The flight was at 13:00, and I planned to sleep late. At 8:00 on the second day, the sound of the doors of the next door rooms opening continuously was like knocking on the bed. The hotel should know the problem, but it is difficult to rectify it. I don’t know if the automatic door closer can be used, just like the car door automatically closes, without noise. 5 points

Complaint: I complained to the front desk about the noise problem and waited for about 10 minutes. Follow-up processing was carried out and breakfast was given. I didn’t pay attention to whether breakfast was included. I think the room of about 450 should include breakfast! I planned to sleep until I woke up naturally, but I got up at 8:00 to be in a daze and wait for the plane. The handling attitude was sincere. I didn’t have any requirements, so the attitude was up to par. 9 points

Breakfast: The breakfast was average. The restaurant arrived after 9:30, and the hot dishes were already wilted! Everything else was fine, the dishes were normal, nothing special, no juice, 8 points

Check out: Waited for the airport bus at the agreed time, the front desk arranged a taxi to take me to the airport, quite honest. 10 points

Overall rating 8 points!

But the window faces the airport, and you can hear planes taking off and landing until late at night. So if you are sensitive to noise, it is recommended to wear earplugs.

There is no free shuttle bus after the driver gets off work after 10 pm. During the day, you can pick up and drop off from Xiamen Gaoqi Airport for free. When we arrived in Xiamen, the driver asked us to wait for him on the roadside. He said it was a purple Buick Business. We were worried that we wouldn't recognize the purple and black one, but it turned out to be... very purple.

The service is very good, warm and thoughtful.

When we went to Thailand from Xiamen, our thick clothes were stored directly in the hotel, which was really convenient.

The welcoming young doorman was very enthusiastic and was responsible for delivering luggage to the room. The girls at the front desk could take it to the next level if they smile a little more and don't be robotic. If you want to eat, you probably live in the city, as there aren't many big hotels around. I will definitely stay there next time.

I also wrote the previous review about the accommodation conditions, so I won’t repeat them here. Before checking out today, I have to give a big thumbs up to the warm service provided by the cafeteria staff - I had dinner with my mother last night and packed it up before finishing the meal for fear of wasting it. When I checked out today, I asked the hotel front desk, who contacted the restaurant staff. The staff are helpful and helpful. Xiamen is really a nice place with nice people. After coming out of the airport, I stayed at this hotel. I really recommend it. By the way, it also has a very artistic feel.

msg:(1) Geographical location: Between airport T4 and T3, it is unrealistic to walk there. Either you need to make a hotel reservation in advance and arrange a car pick-up (on the first floor below); or you need to take a taxi directly after you come out. It costs 20 yuan to arrive directly without using the meter, otherwise the driver will not want to pick you up. . .

(2) Environment: quite good, both the lobby and the rooms are good.

(3) Service: The lobby service is enthusiastic and organizes participating activities. However, the front desk reminded me that children's slippers would be given away. I waited until dawn and didn't even wait until there were two dark circles under my eyes. . . Flaws do not cover up strengths.

(4) Bed: summed up in three words: a little itchy.

(5) Breakfast: Very rich, thumbs up 👍.

(6) Summary: Recommended airport accommodation!

This hotel really gave me a memorable experience. I can feel that it is a serious hotel owner who wants to be a good hotel. The room is clean and tidy, the artistic a**osphere is rich in details, and the towels are folded. The cute bunny has many bottles Free mineral water, Xiaoqin, Rubik’s Cube, fruit, daily nuts, small details, small sewing kit, paper pen, pencil sharpener, ruler, pins, even small earplugs. It’s really a very meticulous hotel. The free pick-up and drop-off service is also very convenient in the morning. Sometimes it is very beautiful and true to send a group of guests a purple Buick business alone.
The only downside is that the air outlet of the air conditioner in the suite is too long and the wind blows directly on the bed

But it is recommended to use online car-hailing! Because the taxi is such a short distance, the master usually has a big emotional explosion, which affects the mood of the trip.
However, I still hope that the hotel can provide 24-hour shuttle service. After all, this new service should account for the majority of airport passengers!
The accommodation room does have a five-star standard, spacious and comfortable.

From the pick-up staff to the hotel front desk and even the security personnel, they all take great care of the guests. There was a bit of noise in the room when I checked in this time. The guy at the front desk was very considerate and offered me the room next door so I could move there so I didn't have to move a lot of luggage. The next day when you checked out, the beautiful lady at the front desk greeted you again and apologized for the inconvenience last night... In short, you feel the hotel's service and attention to each guest's experience, and you really feel at home...👍👍

Facilities: There are relatively few smart facilities

Hygiene: Hygiene can be done well, and it is clean and comfortable to live in, without any peculiar smell.

Environment: You can see a lake outside, not very big. Because there are objective factors in the construction, it will not be exaggerated too much.

Service: The service is okay, the waiters are good and efficient, and the image is also very good. The key is that it doesn't matter the appearance, clean and tidy, and the work clothes are very distinctive.

msg:Because the flight was too early, I chose a hotel close to the airport to check in. Check in feels very good. As soon as you enter the door, you will be greeted by fairy ladies in Hanfu. Children can get small keychains and small candies for reciting poems. Although it is only a small gift, the children are very happy and stimulate their interest in reciting poems. The front desk specially added children's art bags for children, which is heart-warming. There are some simple artworks on the floor for viewing, which can be regarded as some small features. In the afternoon, I stayed at the downstairs restaurant and ordered meals. The price is moderate. The small garden is very cozy. It’s pretty good to have some afternoon tea outdoors. There are simple small slides, rocking bridges, and swings. Self service laundry room is also very convenient. The room is also good, all services are very attentive. There is a small convenience store opposite the hotel. There is a free drop-off service on the second day, and it is only a 5-minute drive to the T3 terminal. Great! Definitely a great place for a turnaround. A little regret is that there is construction near the hotel recently, and there is ding ding bang bang at night, but this is temporary, and it doesn't affect people like me who sleep well. 😂

The driver is super nice. We helped us carry a lot of luggage to and from the car. We are curious about the car service so close, and I feel sorry for you. You dragged your luggage. It's not convenient. The room is very spacious, clean and tidy, and the staff are very nice. The Chinese New Year a**osphere that I didn't feel abroad suddenly made up for it here😂. It’s just that I didn’t know the name of the hotel from the beginning to the end, it was too long 😂 but I finally realized why it is called the Art Center. Every floor has an art core, and the fifth floor where I stayed is embroidery. Only after seeing the introduction on the small sign on the table did I understand why the room felt so good when I entered the room. It turned out that the decoration was thoughtful and unique, and the value for money was excellent. There is also a seafood wholesale market about ten minutes away by taxi. I found a small stall, and the boss went directly to the market to get the goods. It was so delicious.
