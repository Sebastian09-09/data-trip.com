msg:Family, in the past two years, I have stayed in Marriott and InterContinental hotels. I have to say that the InterContinental Hotel located in Shenzhen International Convention and Exhibition Center has the best value for money and the best service. You can check the official website. The room fee is not high, but this hotel is newly established. The decoration is very luxurious and the service attitude of the staff is also top-notch. I strongly recommend it to everyone. If you want to spend a weekend in Shenzhen to go out to a five-star hotel, you must come to: InterContinental Hotel Shenzhen International Convention and Exhibition Center.

It seems that there are many personal facilities in his house, but I live alone, so I don‚Äôt need them. The infinity pool is very clean and the experience is excellent. Before leaving, he also gave me a small gift (a piece of aromatherapy), and I specially left a room card as a souvenir. Special thanks to the front desk brother Cary, the service is very thoughtful and patient.

The facilities are very new and well decorated. It is near the airport but there is no noise in the room at all. It's a pity that I can only take a short break for one day on a business trip.

They actually use broken tea bags!!!, and make coffee bags for guests to drink,
A conscienceless hotel, not as good as the supplies of Atour Hotel,

The shampoo and shower gel used are big brands, but the quality is terrible, it makes hair itchy and dry,
I saw clearly: it's "selling dog meat under the guise of sheep", the products are very different from those in retail counters,
They are worse than those used in Vienna Hotel,

I went to the hotel to confront this, and the hotel said that they use hotel-specific products, which are a little worse than retail products, and the taste is different,

This hotel is a scam, the **** InterContinental Hotel

When we left, we had only one thought: this InterContinental was really terrible. No matter how good the facilities were, they couldn't cover up the low-quality service of the service staff.
We really don't know how Diana, the manager of the executive lounge, could become the manager of the executive lounge. After a round of communication, we knew that she had no sense of service from the bottom of her heart, so it's no wonder that the people below her were almost the same.

msg:One thing to say, the hotel opened in 2023 has a very new decoration, the rooms are large, and it is very comfortable to stay. The bathroom is open, which is a very special design. There is no view at all, as the surrounding area is a suburban residential area.
On May Day, several friends and I booked an executive room. In fact, we just wanted to rest in the executive lounge and eat simple food without going out to crowds. First of all, the executive lounge is very small and there are few seats. When we went up for afternoon tea, there were already cases where we could not find a seat. I guess both the guests and the staff were not expecting it, so the scene was very chaotic. The afternoon tea provided is the shabbiest among the many five-star hotels I have ever stayed in. Then because I called in advance to ask about the children's charges, when I arrived at the scene, I said that the message given was misunderstood. Fortunately, I had written evidence to prove it. These are not important, because Ctrip helped me handle it in the end, showing the responsibility of a big brand. On the other hand, the hotel, let alone the fact that the information they provided was wrong and led to a misunderstanding, the executive lounge manager on duty, Diana, did not provide any solutions or say anything during the whole process, and she was black-faced throughout the whole process. It really looked like we were some kind of enemy. The overall feeling of the three-day and two-night trip is that this hotel provides standard services from top to bottom, nothing more. The so-called customer service is absolutely nonexistent. If you are passing through and staying for one night, it doesn't matter, but if you are on vacation with family and friends, you may encounter vomiting blood in many places. I strongly recommend that you choose other hotels.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the quality of the food. The breakfast is good. The executive lounge only provides afternoon tea and happy hour. There are very few varieties, and they are all good home-cooked dishes. On both days, they were fried with beans and pork slices, mushrooms with pork slices and the like. No soup no pasta. There are also very few wine varieties. It's acceptable to give it for free, but it's really unnecessary if you use money and points to exchange it, and the experience is really bad.

I didn't sleep well for two nights. Because I found it was too late after checking in that day, I reported this to your online customer service, but I didn't get any response the next day.

msg:I was very happy when I walked into the Edon Suite. Seeing the beds, slides, lighting, patterns on the walls, and the layout of the altar, I felt like I had walked into a fairy tale in a dreamland. I felt so good! It's just that the hygiene is not that good. They said they would broom the room for me, but I felt that there was dust on the bathtub, slide, and the bow of the Eton. This is the worst part!
Hygiene: The next day, I asked the housekeeper to clean the broom; there was no need to clean the beds. The toilet in the main bathroom seems to be a little clogged, I need to clear it! But I didn‚Äôt expect that the housekeeper only collected the garbage, simply cleaned the bathroom, and replenished some supplies. The toilet in the main bathroom was not unblocked (still didn‚Äôt dare to put toilet paper down), nor did they wipe the table or help with the floor vacuuming. Damn, the hygiene standards of InterContinental Hotel rooms should not be like this!
Environment: The environment outside the window is also very good. There is a view of the river nearby. The floor I live on also has a sea view opposite the convention and exhibition center. Also because it is close to the airport, I, who likes airplanes, can constantly hear and see planes taking off. After passing it, I felt even more excited!
Service: Zoe and Tina, the staff at the executive lounge, have taken good care of me since I walked in and checked in. Zoe will remember that I cannot drink iced drinks and take the initiative to bring me room temperature ones. Tina will also help with hot soup. Afraid of scalding guests, they will always take care of them immediately when they are in need and give them peace of mind when they need a rest. It is rare for them to understand the needs of residents on the executive floor at such a young age.
Service: The next morning, because there was a large-scale event in the hotel the day before yesterday, many guests stayed. During breakfast, the restaurant seemed to be chaotic and crowded like a war! Cerrie Wang at the lobby restaurant, she knew that I couldn't squeeze in to get something to eat, and only had food that didn't suit my taste, so she took the initiative to help arrange smoked food and steamed snacks that suited my taste. I received her care for two mornings. Diet, and asking for warmth from a weak and cold person are very heartwarming!
Finally, I would also like to thank Xujiazhen Rex from the concierge depar**ent. He helped answer many questions about the environment, facilities and transportation near the hotel!

It is also the first year since I switched from Marriott and ihg dual holders to focus on ihg. The service is really good. The concierge helps me pick up my bags from the moment I get off the bus. I went to the front desk to check in warmly and thoughtfully, and took the initiative to upgrade my "little silver card" to a room type. My room is relatively smart. The only problem is that there is a problem with the WiFi link. First, the computer couldn't connect, and IT came to solve it. At night, the mobile phone couldn't connect. . . Repeated restarts didn't work, so I gave up. I was given snacks and snacks, but I had slight diarrhea after eating them. It's a small shortcoming.

The hotel's playground is also very good, and the shape of the boat is very distinctive. The service is super considerate and thoughtful. This room has a lot of exclusive privileges, and there are special people to teach little friends how to fold towel animals. The executive lounge is also very tasteful. I thought the surroundings would be very desolate, but I didn't expect that walking by the river would be very comfortable. Although there is a shopping mall next door and there are many restaurants, we finally solved breakfast, lunch and dinner in the hotel. The service and environment are nothing to say. The products are also excellent in five-star hotels, and the cost performance is very high. This time I came to the swimming pool for maintenance and was not open. I hope to experience it next time. I have been paying attention to this room for a while. It is usually fully booked. I suddenly found that there was a room and came. I think it‚Äôs great, but I‚Äôm afraid that too many people know that it will be difficult to book next time. I will come again!

This is truly a five-star hotel. The staff is friendly, polite and smiling.

The ventilation system in the hotel room is good and does not bring any odor; the utensils in the bathroom are also very carefully made.

The only drawback is that the water in the wash basin in the bathroom is very slow, which is poor.

Overall it is worth recommending.

In the evening, we went out to eat After dinner, the air conditioner in the room was not very cold. I contacted the front desk and immediately a second batch of staff came to check and repair the problem. They quickly solved the problem. Among them was a very shy young man from the engineering depar**ent. His voice was soft and he quickly solved the problem. The air conditioning problem was solved üëç, and fruit desserts were served again in the evening, which made me feel uncomfortable, haha. The next day, Tina apologized again for yesterday's air conditioning issue. In fact, it was not the hotel's fault, it was because our hotel was not cold enough. , Haha, they gave us another small gift. Anyway, I am very happy to stay here. Oh, and their breakfast buffet is also very rich. Finally, I would like to thank every staff member of the Intercontinental Hotel for helping us in time when we came out.

It is simply full of emotional value for children and adults!
Give children a "task card" when checking in
It‚Äôs not so much a question card as it is a room play guide!
Where you can run mazes, slides, roll dice and more
From the wallpaper, to the furniture, to the sofa, everything is nautical themed
As soon as my son got in, he ran to the bed and "sailed the boat"
Upon check-in, fruits, snacks, and yogurt will be delivered to the room.
When children are happy, adults will also be happy!
	
We went back to the room after dinner and found that there were desserts, chocolates, and yogurt delivered to the room again! And the chocolates are also nautical themed! Desserts are very delicious
An exclusive table was arranged for breakfast the next day, with small dolls, brooches and exclusive muffins for the children (pictured)
For adults, each person is given a special drink in the executive lounge
Although many things may not necessarily be used, both adults and children are pleasantly surprised by the hotel's thoughtfulness.

The big oysters, shrimps and scallops were cooked so freshly that it dropped your jaw, but but but, the wifi signal in the room was so poor that if you want to rely on the hotel wifi to watch TV shows and attend meetings, you can just pass it~ I would like to praise Rita for her active and patient help in solving the problem.

msg:During the Spring Festival, the management and service of the Shenzhen International Convention and Exhibition Center InterContinental were so bad that it‚Äôs hard to describe. How can there be any hint of Intercontinental here? I suggest the management go to two intercontinental companies in Chengdu to learn and communicate. The only positive thing I can say is that on the day we checked in on February 14th, we came up from the basement elevator. A young guy with short hair enthusiastically showed us the way and carried our luggage. He learned that we were in an executive room and helped us clean the elevator. And you will be sent to the executive lounge for check-in. The worst thing is the executive lounge, where people come to hang out, eat and drink! Two adults and a child came to the executive lounge, three people! three people! The lounge staff reminded them that they needed to pay the additional fee, but the family argued that "only the children can eat, not the adults." But in the end, the children and adults ate together, and in the end they did not pay the additional fee for each person. Moreover, their children were running around in the lounge and howling loudly, but no staff stopped them! When encountering such scoundrels, the hotel should strictly manage and adhere to principles! This is a sign of respect for all guests. As for the food at the happy hour in the lounge, there are not many hot dishes. The so-called meat dishes are processed meats such as sausages cooked with vegetarian dishes. They have no taste. I didn‚Äôt see any original meat, nor did I see it. When it comes to seafood and vegetable salads, the bottom is already low, and no staff has yet to add more. The desserts in the lounge are pretty good, reaching intercontinental standards. Let‚Äôs talk about the breakfast the next day. After we sat down, we couldn‚Äôt find the coffee machine. I saw a girl wearing glasses who looked like a foreman and asked if she could help me make a cup of coffee. She replied, ‚ÄúYes, please wait a moment.‚Äù This wait was ten minutes. For a few minutes, the female leader didn't know what she was doing and completely forgot about our coffee, so that we found the coffee machine by ourselves. There was a cup of prepared coffee on the coffee machine, but she never gave it to us. Bring it over. Finally, the lady remembered our coffee and brought it to us more than ten minutes later. I told her that I had already made the coffee myself and didn't need it. The waiter in the breakfast room first came up and held my plate with his hands, and then asked me, "Do you need me to take it away for you?" Shouldn't he first ask the guest if he wants to take away the plate, and then take my plate away? This is really not an intercontinental service!

On New Year's Eve, a few of us went to the self-service seafood restaurant on the first floor for a buffet. There were more than 300 people per person, and it felt like It is very similar to the buffet at the Intercontinental Shanghai Ruijin where I stayed last time. It may be a newly opened hotel, so the service level is very high so far. The employees are very polite, very considerate, and very enthusiastic. If there are any small problems, they can be quickly followed up and solved. The general manager and the heads of each department On the first day of junior high school, small pero gifts and chocolate candies were distributed to everyone.
Environment: Environment, it is in the security area, west of the airport, basically near Dongguan, relatively far from the main city, very close to the exhibition center and the airport, and many of the surrounding areas are industrial areas, so during the Spring Festival, the entire surrounding area It seemed empty, and there weren't many people on the road, but the hotel was very lively and popular. It was basically full during the Spring Festival, and I had to wait in line for the buffet I had that day.
Hygiene: The hygiene is very clean, I haven't found any flaws yet
Facilities: Compared with other InterContinental hotels, the facilities use more metal materials. They have a slightly industrial feel like 1/10. Everything else is fine, and the design style is quite satisfactory. Surprisingly, the industrial style is particularly popular here in Shenzhen. Many hotels adopt the industrial style and use a lot of metal accessories. Metal hardware is used to make indoor tables, chairs, cabinets, and edge decorations.

msg:The hotel is in the center of this area. There is a shopping mall across the small road, but it is mainly for eating and drinking. It has everything you need, which is quite convenient. I like the style of the hotel very much. Compared with the other two Intercontinentals, the decoration style really hit my heart at once. I really like this simple style. The size of the room is still very Intercontinental, and the layout is reasonable, mainly large and clean. Also clean. The decoration smell in the room was not as serious as I expected. It was not noticeable. There is not much scenery around the hotel, which is understandable. It is mainly convenient because it is close to the Convention and Exhibition Center. I think the breakfast is pretty good, five-star standard. I was too busy taking care of the kids to take care of it. The hotel's service is very friendly. The lobby manager Ethan took us to the elevator hall, helped us press the elevator button and reminded us to turn on the elevator light. Brother Pike and Miss Irene are very good at service. They are very gentle and talk to me. They run around for my children's things. After Katie paid the bill, she came out to say hello and goodbye to my daughter, which made her feel good. Maybe it‚Äôs just a habit, I always choose Intercontinental when I go out. If you are traveling nearby for business or attending conferences and exhibitions, I still recommend 5 stars.

msg:I had read some bad reviews before, and I was worried about the smell of a newly built hotel, but I still felt that I should trust the quality of InterContinental. After checking in, I was very satisfied with everything. The person who received me was Miss Zoya, and the service was very good. Maybe there were not enough people in the guest room, so we still had to wait for a room. However, Vincent gave us drink coupons, which alleviated our anxiety of waiting for a room, so we can ignore the small problem of waiting for a room. Later, I mentioned in the lobby that it would be better if the room had an air purifier, and Ethan immediately arranged for an air purifier. The service was very fast. The concierge Leo also quickly helped carry the luggage to the car when checking out. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. Although it is far from the city, it is close to the Convention and Exhibition Center, so it is very convenient to come and watch the exhibition. I will come back to stay next time there is an exhibition~

The amazing thing is that it is basically the same as Conrad Guangzhou, and the toiletries are also from the same brand, BYREDO. The service attitude is very good, everyone they meet will take the initiative to smile and say hello. Except for the guy outside the gate who was in charge of car doors and luggage, he was a little slow and took a long time to react. Maybe I came here from Didi and didn‚Äôt look like I was staying in a hotel.
The location is too far from the city, but there is a commercial building downstairs and very close to the exhibition hall. It is a good choice for those going to the exhibition.

In the restaurant bar, it is very pleasant to take a break and drink a cup of coffee. In addition, the facilities are very complete, there is a special makeup mirror, and the wet and dry bathroom has a separate space with a wash basin. This design can get full marks!
The breakfast is rich in variety and of good quality, especially bread and cakes. There are many people staying during May Day, but the waiters are very diligent! The service is also very good.
The hotel has just opened for more than a year. The gym equipment is very new. The swimming pool environment is very good, especially with a warm pool and a cold pool. There are also wet and dry steam rooms in the shower room. After a busy day, it‚Äôs time to exercise to relax!

msg:This booking was a family trip with a few friends. I thought it would be more convenient to book a room in the executive corridor without having to travel around. I also believed that a big brand chain would not be bad. As a result, I was very disappointed this time!

First of all, the hotel introduction states that each room can invite one additional guest to enjoy the executive corridor dining service for free. As a result, an executive room with two breakfasts includes one executive corridor service, one for one person! The free invitation is equivalent to administrative treatment for two people. This is quite puzzling!

As a rule, two people are allowed to stay in each room, and breakfast is provided for two persons. Why does the executive corridor originally include one meal per person? Moreover, when we booked the room, we emphasized many times that we were going on a family trip. Every family has an older child. We saw that we could invite one more person to enjoy the executive benefits for free, which is a family of three. We felt that we were sincere before making the reservation. For this resort hotel, the customer service knew clearly but did not inform about this problem. It turns out that each room only has one person, and the invitation is only for two people at most. It was quite annoying when we were there! The manager in the administrative corridor has very poor service awareness! During the communication process, his arrogant tone was like that of Party A‚Äôs father, and he felt that they had no problem at all!

Secondly, the hotel's official website states that the executive corridor hours are from 6:30 am to 10:30 pm, but it actually starts at 12 o'clock, and no food, including snacks and biscuits, is provided during non-dinner and afternoon tea times. On the first day, I saw that for dinner (starting at 6pm), there were not many varieties and small portions. Everyone was really waiting for food just like they had been decades ago! This kind of courtesy is very poor! It is simply not worthy of the international brand of Intercontinental, and it seriously affects our impression of the Intercontinental brand as consumers!

Furthermore, we lost a room card in the executive corridor on the first night. We went back to the seat where we were sitting and looked for it but couldn't find it. As a result, the next afternoon, our companion went up to the executive corridor and sat in the same seat. We found the room card under the table. Our companions found out that they asked the front desk to check the room number. They actually told the room number directly to the friend who picked up the card and gave them the room card instead of contacting us to get the card! If other random people took it, I can‚Äôt imagine what would happen! And if the card was picked up in the same location, does this mean that the administrative corridor was not cleaned? !

To sum up, if you choose an executive room for vacation, this hotel is completely unqualified! Choose carefully!

The room is very large and every space is used very well.

The hotel staff provide very good service, everyone greets me with a smile and takes the initiative to greet me. When we got off the bus and arrived at the hotel, the guys at the door, Reg and Leo, helped drag four carts of luggage to the room. When we checked out, they happened to be the ones helping us drag four carts of luggage. Thank you very much! Ethan served with a smile and checked in very professionally and quickly.

I encountered some minor problems when I checked in, and the hotel staff quickly discovered and helped solve them. The service attitude was excellent. It is very consistent with the Intercontinental brand concept and is customer-oriented. Thanks to the manager Mr. Mao Ning for his excellent and considerate service and actively helping us solve our problems, as well as Katie Zirong at the front desk for her smiling service.

msg:First of all, I noticed hair on the pillow when I just checked in. I didn‚Äôt respond because I was tired at the time. During the shower at night, I found that the water temperature was unstable. I had to adjust the water temperature more than five times after taking a shower. At that time, I thought it was okay to stay only for two nights, and then early the next morning I found a dental floss pick on the bedside. I thought that someone else‚Äôs used dental floss pick had been left on the bedside all night. It was quite disgusting. This was considered a major hygienic oversight. After breakfast, I reported to the manager on duty at the front desk and asked for a replacement. room, I was asked to go back to the room and wait. Not long after, there was a knock on the door. I thought it was the manager who came to change rooms. Unexpectedly, it was the health aunt who came in to deal with the room situation. It was a private space to watch the aunt deal with the situation. We didn‚Äôt know where to be in the room. Why, I explained the situation to my aunt again, but I had no choice but to wait in the lobby. When my girlfriend got impatient in the lobby, the manager on duty came down and asked us to change rooms. When we went up, we found that the big bed we originally booked had been replaced by one. There were twin beds, one man, one woman and one backpack. Anyone who looked at it would know that they were a couple. They had to confirm that they were switching to twin beds. Then they were led to a large bed without air conditioning, but a large bunch of hair and hair were found on the floor. Food remnants. We had already been moved to two rooms early in the morning. In fact, I was a little tired and wanted to just forget it. Maybe the manager on duty was embarrassed and wanted to change another one for us. It was a good intention but it was too late to wait. Although I was in the room for an hour, I thought it wasn't the final room and I didn't dare to drink water or lie down. Besides, there weren't many customers at the front desk around eight o'clock at that time. I didn't understand why it took so long to change rooms, although in the end I upgraded, but there is no real difference between the upgraded room type and the previous one. Except for the higher floor, it is still a community building with no view outside, and there are not many people nearby. The lower floors are just as quiet, and the height of the floor really doesn't matter. The difference was that Nescafe coffee was replaced with capsule coffee, but it was not as good as the Luckin store downstairs, which costs NT$99. The fruit plate and scented candles that came with it were mediocre compared to this annoying experience. The key was to upgrade the room in the end. The light-blocking of the room is not as good as the previous one. There is a gap at the bottom which is not good for light-blocking during the day, but it is too troublesome and I don‚Äôt want to bother with it. The whole process of changing rooms went through four rooms, and I changed two rooms in the morning while carrying my luggage. I thought that this was the end of the hour room, but no, I wanted to leave directly on the final day of check-out, but seeing that the check-out lady was very enthusiastic and apologetic, she wanted to invite me to give my feedback to the manager on duty that day. At that time, I felt that the design was so so It was a pity that I had a great hotel experience but not a good one, so I agreed, but ended up waiting for half an hour. If my girlfriend hadn‚Äôt gone to the bathroom in the middle, she would have left. During the waiting period, I wasn‚Äôt invited to the lounge and just sat in the lobby. I was given a bottle of mineral water and two tea shops outside to try lemon tea in small paper cups. It was incompatible with the luxurious lobby. I felt that even if I came to an interview to get this, it would be a bit shabby. Finally, the manager on duty came, A very young guy, I reported all the problems, and he accepted them all and apologized. He said that he had witnessed the hotel from the beginning to the present, and he also hoped that the hotel would be better. To express his apology, he invited me to contact me next time I stay. He would apply for a suite and a self-catering double night. I originally thought that the guy should be really responsible. I thought about the problem and got effective feedback. I thought that it is normal to have problems in the new hotel. It just depends on how to deal with it. Knowing the mistakes can make a lot of improvements. I won't leave a bad review, and I quickly booked a stay for next month upon invitation, but it was a bit uncomfortable. Maybe the guy saw that I readily booked for next month, and immediately upgraded the room for the next stay. He asked for this good review on the grounds of a double night buffet...and it was quite urgent. Even if I refused to give this unintentional good review, he still hoped to give him a separate good review. The sincerity and apology before had turned into utilitarianism and transaction at this moment, even though In the end, the problem was communicated well, and it cannot be denied that the overall trip was not satisfactory. Moreover, it was quite bad to ask for a positive review on the grounds of next time. I am not averse to asking for positive feedback, but positive feedback should be based on a good experience and should be done after solving the problem for the customer. In the case of the problem, the room upgrade and two nights given out should be the hotel's apology and sincerity to the guests, rather than threatening customers with favorable comments. Moreover, many customers may not care about the cost of a meal and Upgrading my apar**ent is far from worth the troublesome experience I have had in the past two days. Even if I get cashback for good reviews on Taobao and cashback on takeaways due to good reviews, it is a bit inappropriate for Intercontinental to handle it this way. I think I should even learn from the Haidilao waiters about this attitude. Comprehensive From the looks of it, there was a problem with hygiene first during this stay. The attitude of the first manager on duty was actually very good. The manager looked really anxious and guilty, but there was a problem with the business. The second manager on duty didn‚Äôt know what was going on with his business, but he treated him well. There is a problem with the customer's attitude. He is not sincere and overly utilitarian. I have also encountered problems when staying at newly opened hotels of the same level before. But usually there will be a dedicated lobby manager to deal with the aftermath and turn the crisis into an opportunity. But this time the whole experience Pretty bad, a shame for such a good design.

As soon as I entered the elevator, I smelled the smell of formaldehyde. When I got to the room, I smelled the smell of formaldehyde again, so I immediately asked to change rooms.

  The hotel is surrounded by greenery. It was late when we arrived at the store, but the service was still as comfortable. Before we arrived at the hotel entrance, a staff member came to welcome us and opened the door to ask if we could check in. After we got a response, we took us to the front desk for formalities. The front desk manager Emma served us It is really warm and thoughtful, and the professionalism is vividly reflected. The beauty who checked in is also very considerate. Because I arrived at the store late, I checked in for us very quickly. I arranged a very comfortable room for us to rest. The room is really beautiful, and There are also handwritten welcome cards and small gifts prepared by the room staff and Emma. They are really considerate. The impression of the whole hotel is up up up‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë. The elevator design of the product to the hotel is very reflective of the style of the entire hotel.
  The breakfast really surprised my Chinese stomach. There is black sesame paste, which is too friendly for people with hair loss. The environment is also very good. I lean against the window and look at the scenery outside. I really feel relaxed and comfortable. , I love the noodles for breakfast! ! And porridge! ! The master told me the name of the congee, but I really can‚Äôt remember it in seven seconds üòÇüòÇ It‚Äôs really delicious and rich in ingredients.
   The surrounding area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is very convenient. It is 900 meters away from the subway station. There are also fruits and restaurants around the hotel, and there are also rich suppers.
  The lounge is located on the 19th floor of the hotel. Upon arrival at the door, the staff will warmly greet you and lead you to a seat. Afternoon tea is provided in sets. The snacks are exquisite and the design is particularly beautiful. Sitting by the window has a wide view and beautiful scenery, which is suitable for relaxing yourself.
  This intercontinental trip is really worthwhile. Compared with urban hotels, InterContinental is more comfortable. The considerate and professional service of the special staff makes me not want to leave. I am very grateful to Manager Emma for her warm hospitality. I will choose this place again and look forward to it. once met üëí

But it can really be compared to your own holiday. There are many restaurants and a supermarket nearby, but the price is a bit expensive.

I was fortunate to experience the executive lounge. I commend the service of the ladies in the lounge, Zoe, Tina, and Rita. They are considerate~ The dishes at Happy hours are very rich and delicious, which is in line with the lounges of other InterContinental hotels. In stark contrast, the lounge manager Diana introduced the lounge very enthusiastically, only to realize that every place has been designed for a long time. From the perspective of the guest experience, she is really very attentive, and she has decisively turned fans of this hotelüíØ

There are a variety of different drinks in the room that can be drunk for free. After finishing the impression, the InterContinental is an executive suite or the like to use the executive lounge.
