msg:The place to stay in Tianjin!  We always stay here when returning to Tianjin.  Location is the best and service is outstanding.   Take Metro Line 1 - Exit XiaoBaiLou station and go out the A or D exit.  A is shorter but D exit has less stairs (if you are pulling luggage).   As you exit you will see the hotel directly in front of you.    Rooms are of a classic design with solid walls ensuring a good sleep.  Windows can be opened which is a nice feature.   Staff are all very helpful, friendly and enthusiastic.  There are many shops, restaurants, parks and other attractions all within walking distance or short metro ride.   We did not have the hotel breakfast this time but on prior visits it has been fantastic.   Tianjin is well known for great breakfasts - do not miss the Jianbing guozi !     Thank you to everyone at the Clarion for making our stay so enjoyable.   We hope to be back soon.

One odd thing. The socket on the wall might be a bit old and does not take my phone charger. Acutally can't really blame them as my one is on Australia standard. But the charger does  go into socket in other hotels....strange.

msg:I had to attend an appointment here at short notice, so I drove to Tianjin with my boyfriend. It was too late and I didn't want to go back to Beijing. Let me comment on this hotel objectively.
Location: First of all, it is very convenient to take a taxi or bus. It is located in the central area. Next to it is the famous Cheeseland.
There are also many food around, and there are stalls at night.
Parking: It is very inconvenient. The hotel does not have its own parking lot. Only 20 cars can be parked at the door. There is an underground parking lot opposite, but it takes a long way to walk up. The weather is very hot. It is easier to park at the Friendship Hotel next to it.
Facilities: Old hotel, very old, it should be a good hotel in the 1970s and 1980s. But now it seems very inconvenient, and it is obviously not upgraded. The shower, charging port, and air conditioning are not very easy to use, especially the air conditioning, it is so hot. . . It is not cool even after opening for a whole day.
Service: Give 5 points. The hotel called me to inquire about the check-in situation. I said that you don’t have a USB charging port, and you charge it with a charge. The hotel immediately sent someone to deliver the plug. But I just want to ask, why not equip the room with a charging head instead of a charge? Such good service is given to the front desk, but not to the hotel itself.
Hygiene: As an old hotel, I trust the hygiene conditions, but to be honest, the bathroom should be cleaned.

There is a delicious breakfast stand next to the hotel, recommended.

It has basically all the breakfasts in Tianjin and is a good place to eat. It is also very close to the Wudadao tourist area, which is about a ten-minute walk away. The waiter was warm and reasonable when checking in. Although the hotel is a bit old, the sound insulation is good and the price-performance ratio is good.

2. The socket on the bedside table is obviously detached and there is no electricity
3. The air conditioner cannot be turned on. I contacted the front desk and they said that it is now natural wind, no air conditioning, and gave me an electric fan
4. Takeaways can only be placed in the takeaway cabinet and cannot be delivered upstairs
5. The sheets may be yellowed due to being too old

The security guard who parked the car was very enthusiastic. When he entered the lobby, he explained the Ctrip reservation. The front desk was also very enthusiastic and the process was completed in less than a minute. Went upstairs to rest for a while, then came down to take the kids to eat steamed buns.

It has been a four- and five-star hotel for so many years. Even if it is not completely renovated, it should be repaired and maintained. It has always made money. Not to mention comfortable and luxurious outside, any economic chain is better than this. It's okay. When I checked out, I asked how the experience was and said I hope I can understand it.

msg:This is the first time I saw a five-star hotel with faeces painted on the walls! I really don’t know how to rate it with five stars!
First of all, the environment. It looks majestic on the outside, but the inside is not good at all. There are 4 pits in the women's toilet in the lobby on the first floor. One toilet is broken, one door is broken, one sewer is clogged. Finally, **** is sprayed everywhere and no one cleans it. There were just a few abandoned coffee machines on the bar. The front desk of the standard room I stayed in said that the view from the upper floor was better. I thought I could see the night view, but when I looked at the window, I saw it was dirty as if it hadn't been wiped in ten years. Four stars is too much for this environment!
What's worse than the environment is the service. We arrived at 11:30 and were told that we had to wait until 12 o'clock to check out if there was no room. As a result, there was still no room available when I came back from lunch at 12:30. There was only one broken chair in the lobby, and the marble on it was still scratched. The most annoying thing is that there is a sofa area in the lobby, but the front desk said that it was under construction and was not allowed to use it. There was no sign of construction at all. The empty sofa was not allowed to sit. A 70-year-old man wanted to take a rest at noon, but he could only Sit on the chair and wait. I asked the front desk several times, hoping that the room would be cleaned up and let us in as soon as possible, but the front desk was just perfunctory. Especially a woman with black-rimmed glasses, whose face almost drooped to the ground. She must be unhappy about working overtime during the Spring Festival. I asked her about the progress of cleaning the room, and she said angrily, "Cleaning is a matter for other departments, how do I know?" as if she owed her money. I waited until it was almost 1:30 and asked again. The front desk said that 4 rooms had been packed out and they were finally let in. Obviously the cleaning department above had already cleaned up the room, and the front desk didn't even notify us.
Breakfast was also eaten in the hotel, which can only be described as average. This hotel has a feeling of poor management. I don't know if it's because of the lack of manpower during the Spring Festival or if it's always been like this. The only advantage is that the location is good, surrounded by restaurants and shopping malls, Xiaobailou across the street, and close to the subway station and Fifth Avenue.

The scenery is beautiful, there are two subway entrances in front and behind, two large shopping malls, and there are delicious food downstairs. The location is impeccable. You can see the Haihe River from the room. The room was very warm and we booked two twin rooms for a family trip. The little cleaning lady is very polite and has a good attitude. There are various types of breakfast, including Tianjin specialty steamed buns, gaba dishes, small chaos, fried cakes, Chinese and Western breakfast, etc... I went to check out and the lady at the front desk saw the service with a smile. After leaving, I was given two souvenirs - the 18th Street ** flower was very grateful to the hotel and service staff. The hotel parking security staff also had a very good attitude and helped guide parking, which was very polite. Will stay here again!

The worst thing is that no one answered the phone in the room and the housekeeping center. I came back late from an evening trip and there was no hot water in the shower. I originally put out a little warm water and started taking a shower. The more I wash it, the cooler it gets. I was washing my face with the faucet, but as soon as I turned it on, the water filter above it fell off. The master came to fix the hot water, but he couldn't fix it for a long time. The front desk didn't think of changing the room until 12:30 in the middle of the night, but it was too late. I don’t know if the room was tested after the last guest left.

msg:I have stayed in a lot of hotels, large and small, over the years.

The score of this hotel on Ctrip is 4.5. To be honest, I think it is too high.

Front desk service: Check-in and check-out were smooth and the service was very good.
Room service: I really didn’t expect that. Maybe the room I stayed in was special. It was so hot that I felt out of body. The room repeatedly told me that there was no air conditioning.
There is no solution. If you kill me, you want to kill me!

The TV remote control was not sensitive. A young lady came over to adjust it. She was even more impatient than me. I said, why don't you check if the battery is out? I helped her solve the difficulties at work. She didn't express gratitude to me, but I tolerated her. I am speechless with my emotions😓

The environment and hygiene of the room are like the atmosphere of an old hotel. When you step on the solid wood floor in the elevator room, you will hear the sound of time.

I used to complain when I read the review, but now I think it was a very restrained narrative.

One thing to say, the location of the hotel is pretty good. It’s really convenient to focus on one thing, but it’s only very convenient.

Those who have requirements for hotels should still make multiple choices.
Or maybe the one I caught was too hot for me
It felt like I had been sitting in the Flame Mountain for half the night. I lost my precious sleep, canceled my room reservation for the next day, and went home.

To be honest, if the hotel makes money these years, it should consider renovating it. It’s such a shame in such a good location.

The first woman couldn't do anything but just put on a bad face. She left the room at around nine o'clock in the evening. I had to wait half an hour for it to be repaired. Not recommended.

At first I only booked a deluxe king room, but when I arrived at the hotel, they were very enthusiastic and upgraded me to a family suite for free. This not only gave me a surprise, but also gave me a more comfortable and spacious stay during my vacation.
The decoration of the room is very exquisite and the facilities are complete. It is particularly worth mentioning that their gym is located on the third floor, with a large space and complete fitness machinery.
The service attitude of the staff is very good, full of care and enthusiasm for the guests. This stay exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend this hotel to other travelers.
Thank you to the hotel for providing me with this unforgettable experience!

Just outside Exit D of Xiaobailou subway, there are surrounding shopping malls with many kinds of food. It is within two or three kilometers of Fifth Avenue, Porcelain House and so on.

The intersection in front of the hotel is a pentagonal intersection. When crossing the road, you need to be careful not to read the wrong traffic lights.


Hygiene: Generally speaking, it is okay. Some areas of tables and stools that are not commonly used can be seen as not being hygienic.

Service: The guys and girls at the front desk are very skilled and efficient. Check-in and check-out are quick and easy.

Facilities: It is relatively old hotel. There are no smart facilities in the room. What is more inconvenient is that there are very few sockets. If there are more devices that need to be charged, there will not be enough space. But the water pressure in the room is very strong and the hot water is very hot. I like this. The air conditioner is indeed noisy, so people with light sleepers need to be careful.

msg:I will never go back to this hotel. Let me talk about what I am not satisfied with. On the first day of arrival, the security there did not allow parking at the entrance of the hotel. There was indeed no formal parking space, so I parked in the underground parking lot of the ** Concert Hall (Xiaobai Building), and then checked in, thinking of parking like this It wasn't an option, so I went downstairs to consult with the front desk and the security guard about the parking issue. The front desk said that I could park if there was space, but when other people's cars were leaving, I needed to cooperate with them in moving the car. The security guard was noncommittal and waited until I paid the parking fee. Yuan (one-hour parking fee). When I parked my car in front of the hotel, the security guard started to make trouble, saying that parking like this was making it difficult for him. I asked the front desk again if I could leave my phone number and car keys at the front desk, but the front desk said I don't know how to drive, so I can solve the parking problem by myself. I even thought about changing hotels. I thought **. This stalemate lasted for ten minutes. I planned to drive to the mall, park inside the mall, and park in front of the hotel when I came back in the evening. At this time, the car in the back wanted to leave and asked the car in front of him with a Dongying license plate to move, so that I could Stopped. Alas, I didn't see this security guard again for the next two days. I don't know if he was avoiding me or something. The above things make me have a bad opinion of *** (both the front desk and the security guard have a strong ** accent), **. In addition, on the last day, I suddenly discovered that I had a lot of dandruff. I also wash my hair every day in winter. If there is so much dandruff, it is because the shampoo in the hotel is too bad. Then I went to other hotels to wash my hair and got dandruff. There is no more dandruff, not before, and not in the future. Just two days after Kailong had so much dandruff, it can be said with certainty that there is something wrong with his shampoo.

Five Avenues, where 64 former residences of celebrities are gathered, is completely different from daytime and evening shopping. The first 4 pictures are for the living room. The refrigerator is more favorable. It is not a decoration, but it can really cool down. You can buy some Tianjin snacks and put them in it. The salmon sashimi I bought was put in the ice overnight, and the ice was still a little bit unmelted. The fifth is the living room bathroom. 789 is the bathroom of the guest room. 6 is the TV set in the guest room. You can take beautiful sunset photos downstairs. If you have parents with children, it is recommended to take a rickshaw. The owners of the rickshaw can explain the things of the Republic of China. In short, recommend it.

There are abundant dining options in the surrounding area. Tianjin No. 1 West Restaurants are just around the corner from Shilin, as well as a 24-hour convenience store.

The location is really hard to choose. The front door of the hotel is Xiaobailou Station of Line 1, and the rear is Xuzhou Road Station of Line 4. Although I don’t understand why Tianjin Metro doesn’t plan to transfer, it’s really convenient.

The room was clean and tidy without any smell and the carpets were clean. You can swim in Laimei Fitness on the 6th floor. Because the pool lock requires a deposit of 100 yuan, I don't have that much cash, so I told the front desk, and the manager personally ran to help me pay the deposit and deliver fruits. It was a very comfortable experience.

msg:It's a pity that I can't give 0 points. This hotel has the advantage of its geographical location, and it has a five-star shell. The hardware is barely 2 stars. The front desk staff is good, but the hotel management is very poor. First of all, the overall decoration feels that it has not been repaired for at least ten years, and there are still some specific problems: broken faucets, broken lights, a lot of stains on the bathroom curtains, serious yellowing of pillow cores and abnormal noises during sleep, and I did not have a good rest all night. Finally complained, Ctrip's handling is quite satisfactory, but the hotel management has been wrangling. For your reference, I hope that Ctrip can supervise the improvement of this hotel. After all, the location is so good that Tianjin’s appearance cannot be damaged. I hope the hotel can also learn the management and operation strategies of other excellent hotels to improve the overall level. If it cannot be improved, It is recommended to change it to about 3 stars or 3 diamonds, otherwise it will mislead consumers

The hotel has no parking space and the front desk service awareness is poor. They won’t take the initiative to find a way for you Solve the problem with a face of not being able to refund the money anyway, honestly waiting in line at the front desk, the receptionist has no sense of service at all, but those who jump in the queue at the back greet them with smiles, and call if they feel that the pillow is not suitable It’s like not playing. Anyway, they will tell you that there are no extra pillows or quilts. When you enter the room and turn on the faucet, it turns out that the yellow soup has been left for a long time before the water turns white (it’s a pity that you forgot to take a photo). There is no soundproofing. The suite I chose during the May Day holiday was intended to be more comfortable, but I didn't expect it to be so bad. I hope I don't mislead consumers anymore! Generally, I don’t comment very much. I didn’t expect Ctrip’s first negative review to this hotel

Maybe it's because it's relatively old that the price is so low in a good area like Xiaobailou. The overall stay experience is half, not recommended.
It is especially recommended that the bathtub in the bathroom can be removed. First of all, it is unhygienic and contains dirt, and it is also dangerous when exposed to rain.

環境：交通便利，出大廳20米3號線入口，酒店門口經常有出租車等着。由於房間緊張幫忙升級了更高的高層，一覽眾山小，尤其夜景好
衞生：乾淨衞生，床單有點兒舊，反應後給換的新的
設施：比較周到，浴缸，酒櫃，沙發，一應俱全，但是由於是老牌國營酒店，裝修有些顯舊，淋雨在浴缸裏，沒有分離
服務：非常周到，有求必應。

值得改進的～我住的房間空調聲音偏大，翻新時貼的裝飾板有開膠的情況，看不出來但是一碰就響，對於想在窗户邊靠一會的住客感知是比較明顯的；有些層的電梯按鈕似乎是壞掉了，幸好是層控😁，不太影響。需要檢修一下啦！
