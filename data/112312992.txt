Xiao Qiao at the front desk is also very friendly. She will answer any questions and is very patient. It is a good choice to choose the six-row room when I first came to Keketuohai. There are also many places to eat around the six-row room, and it is also very convenient to walk there.

msg:The best hotel in Keketuohai, remarkable
1. A must-select suite, with one bedroom and one living room of more than 60 square meters. There is no better place than this decoration and area.
2. Breakfast in the hotel is available until 11:30 at the latest. It is very rich and can also pack breakfast for free (which hotel in the country can pack breakfast for free)
3. It has complete facilities, including a billiards room, bar, restaurant, and the only underground parking lot in Cocoa. When the mountain is closed, it is very comfortable to lie down in the hotel for a day.
4. Thank you to the housekeeper Ismaili, who helped me deliver my huge and heavy luggage when I checked in, and finally helped me clean my snow-covered car, set up shop for my stalled car, renew my room, and was always considerate and caring.

msg:Facilities: The hotel is new and has just opened.
Environment: Very good
The service is very good. The skis were sent to the hotel before the guests arrived, and the hotel helped to pick them up.
The hotel also has many drivers' phone numbers. If you need a car, ask the front desk for the driver's number and make an appoin**ent in advance.
Because the road to the Keketuohai ski resort is closed, we can't go to the ski resort. We can't get our skis at the ski resort, but we have to leave Keke, so we asked the hotel manager to help pick them up and send them back to us later.
Then the breakfast is very rich and delicious😋

msg:This is the third year I have been skiing in Keketuohai. This time, I chose the newly opened Keketuohai Six-Row Apar**ent Hotel. I was actually quite worried before I checked in, because in the past two years, the overall decoration, facilities and services of Keketuohai hotels were not very ideal, including the most worrying sound insulation problem.
But after this stay, all the previous worries were gone. The hotel lobby is spacious and bright, the room decoration is simple but not simple, the hotel restaurant has a rich variety of dishes, and the most important thing is that the sound insulation is quite good, so that I can get a full rest after skiing for a day, and I will not be disturbed by the neighbors outside the door or upstairs and downstairs.
The disadvantage may be that the room price is a little expensive, but for other advantages, it is completely acceptable. I hope the hotel will remain as it is now, and I will come to Keketuohai to ski every year and choose to stay in the Six-Row Apar**ent Hotel.

msg:It is said to be one of the best hotels in Keketuohai, but it is really disappointing. First of all, check in. Since I rushed to Keketuohai from Urumqi, it was already past one o'clock when I arrived. The front desk of the lobby was lying on the sofa of the hotel. I woke up after shouting a few times. Then I checked in with various problems. It took thirty minutes to get into the room. I was exhausted. I opened the toilet, and the toilet was full of feces. I don't know how the room manager checked the hygiene of the room. The next morning, I found that the toilet was blocked, and I communicated with the front desk for repairs. When I returned to the hotel at night, it was still blocked, so I had no choice but to change a room. During the period, I found that the hygiene of the room was a mess. As a new hotel, I was really speechless. Then talk about breakfast, which only has ten varieties in total. And the boxed yogurt is available one day and not the next day. Let the chef make noodles, and the chef looked for a soup spoon for a few minutes. It's not funny. I stayed for four days and had various accidents. Finally, I would like to say that the cleaning of the guest room is troublesome to be more serious. The garbage is not cleaned up, and the basin is not washed. If it is not well managed, please ask a professional team to manage it. If it goes on like this, it will not be worth the price.
