msg:Great and helpful people 
Rooms very good
Location far from the centre of guangzhou but on the motorway. 
Nice swimming pool.
Staff don't speak English :(
Breakfast is very simple but no ENGLISH labels which they didn't bother to put lable for my 8 days of stay!

Over all I would come again and book with them

msg:I chose this one because the popular hotels next to Baoneng Stadium were all gone. The room I booked was relatively large and empty so it was easy to move around. However, the facilities were a bit old and the smell was not good when I entered the room. Fortunately, I brought an air freshening spray to get through it. , There are not many breakfast options, and they are a bit greasy.

I could even vomit myself several times while brushing my teeth due to the sewage smell that came up from the sink drain. It was so frustrating.
