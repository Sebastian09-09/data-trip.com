msg:One of the best stays in China as a foreign traveller!

The hotel and its facilities are excellent, clean and well furnished with every detail taken care of. 
The surrounding views of the mountains and rivers are stunning and the hotel is ideally situated just out of the city in the mountains.
Our room included a outdoor natural hot spring as well as pool overlooking the river. The bathroom also had a hot spring/bath inside.

The hot springs are some of the best we have been to and were included in the stay along with breakfast and a private morning yoga session.
Steve and the team were incredible and looked after us during the entire stay - he assisted us with our booking, check-in, dinner and spa reservations as well as assisting us with anything else we needed, all in English. There were also English copies of the menus in the restaurant and translations throughout the hotel and stay which was a massive help, especially being foreign guests at the hotel.

We had breakfast and dinner at the hotel which were both great. 
The breakfast consisted of local Chinese (The Chongqing Noodles are an absolute must) as well as international options. 
For dinner, we asked Steve to recommend traditional, local dishes and he took care of the rest. The Duck, Salted Goose and Lotus root were our top picks from this. There is of course a very wide selection of international dishes to choose from as well.

The hotel is the perfect blend between modern 5 star luxury and a traditional, nature stay.

We highly recommend Bolian to anyone looking for the perfect escape from the city.
We will certainly be back!

msg:My friend was attracted by the reputation, and I had longed for it for a long time, so I decisively booked a room for one day. This was a perfect experience beyond expectations. The design, service and management of the hotel just hit my expectations and aesthetic points. The ordinary is extraordinary, the simple is not simple, and only beauty and perfection can be used to express the woods, buildings and feelings under the early summer sun. My friends were also very satisfied. The hotel sent a car to pick us up and the room was upgraded for free, so that the two couples could have a shared living room and riverside terrace. We drank tea, chatted and soaked in private hot springs. We had lunch under the big tree on the open-air platform of the Chinese restaurant with sun-dappled sunlight, watching the green water of the Jialing River, and for dinner, we scanned the code to order and sent it to the room. Get up early and go to the hot spring temple next door to burn the first pillar of incense. Both lunches ordered sauerkraut Jiangtuan, which was delicious. Breakfast was also very attentive. The vase flowers were picked and inserted by the tea artist himself. The hotel is a bit old, but the maintenance and management are still in place, and the smart toilet and scanning code ordering are also in place. The private hot spring is very comfortable and warm, and the service staff are of high quality and the service is very considerate. This attitude of running a hotel makes people grateful.

msg:The location of this hotel is unique in Chongqing, facing the river and mountains, just inside the North Hot Spring. The service is very good, basically always responsive and responsive to requests. It is adjacent to the Hot Spring Temple (right at the door) and is also very close to the former residences of many cultural celebrities in Beibei. The only flaw is that the equipment is relatively old: the hot water supply to the hot spring pool will be shut down from 12pm to 8am (this was not informed to the guests when checking in), it is said that the water tank capacity is insufficient. However, this means that all guests are basically unable to bathe in the hot spring pool at night and in the morning. Compared with other hot spring hotels of the same level, there is a big gap. In addition, the hot water for a normal shower basically takes about 5 minutes after boiling the water to reach the normal bathing temperature. Later, I talked with a previous friend (who stayed in the same room type about two months ago) and we all had a rather unpleasant experience in common: because we all have the habit of taking a bath in the morning, however, we walked to the outdoor terrace on a cold day After entering the pool, I found that the water was all cold. I hurried to the shower room to take a quick shower to warm myself up, but I found that the water that came out was also cold water (because the hot water had to wait for a long time). This can easily cause guests to catch colds and get sick. In addition, the shower room only has a ceiling spray but no shower head, and there is no open whiskey glass in the whole room. If the hotel management can pay attention to these small details and make timely improvements, they should greatly improve the customer experience.

After calling to ask, I was told that it was closed because the pipes were cleaned the night before. Was replied to wait for the engineering depar**ent to work. The hotel did not inform the guests when the hot springs would be disconnected in advance, and the service was not in place!

What's even more headache is that you can't watch TV without lying on the bed, because the TV is fixed at the end of the bed and cannot be rotated left and right, and the radiation directly shoots people to death...
…the shower only has a fixed overhead shower, no hand-held showers
...the furniture is old, for example, the back cushion of the sofa is at a right angle, you have to sit gently or you will hurt your tailbone, because the cushion is really hard.
…I was told that breakfast could be delivered to the room when I ate at the restaurant on the night of my stay. The next day, when I asked for breakfast to be delivered to the room, I was replied that there was no problem. Then I called and said that there would be an additional service fee of 88 yuan per person for breakfast. The management was very good. confusion.
…If you want to contact the duty manager in the morning, the front desk can only contact you at 8:00 when you go to work. Is this a five-star hotel or a state unit?

The above situation was partially resolved later, but it was all reached after several protests. Children who are not noisy have no sugar to eat. Is it too tiring to stay in a hotel and defend their rights all the time? It's not worth it to charge 4000 a night to stay in such a quality hotel, very bad experience!

2) The TV is broken. And the audio is still unusable.
3) The overall environment is relatively quiet. However, the facilities are quite old and outdated, and it can be seen that there is no maintenance at all.

The lowest cost-effective hotel I have ever stayed in, there is no one.

Breakfast is mainly a la carte, the chef cooks food on site, and there is a small amount of self-service, which is exquisite and avoids waste! There was a little misunderstanding when picking up the station, but it paid attention to the needs of customers and resolved it quickly, and the service was very good!

最後吐槽下床尾的電視，操作非常複雜，並且不太靈敏，聽説還是才換的，真的不太喜歡。躺在沙發上就沒法看了，必須要在床上才能看。

msg:帶母親去的。前台主動免費給升級到躍層房，感謝。環境很不錯，温泉水很熱很舒服，衞生這些都沒問題。

有一點不足，以重慶這個天花板的價格來説，房間外的露天温泉池私隱性稍微差一點，我這棟左邊是高於我們餐廳樓，中間衹用了植物隔開，右邊一棟平層雖然有隔牆，但上面一層沒有隔開，也就是我的斜上方就能看到人走動，對方如果要想窺視下面的人，也從陽台縫看得到。所以基本沒太泡露天的這個池子，幸好房間裏還有一個湯池。這方面就真的比不上重慶悦榕莊了。在日本生活多年，常常去住獨立帶露天温泉的温泉旅館，日本的温泉villa雖然沒有這麼豪華，但對私隱是非常注重的。不知道是不是國內一般泡温泉都是穿着泳衣，大家沒太在意私隱。反正我個人認為泡温泉私隱是最重要的，柏聯這個設計反而有一點被忽略。

此外，早餐是送到房間，很豐富，本是好事，但食物過多就浪費了。又要提到國外，常常在歐美旅遊，很多高檔酒店早餐也是送到房間，但會在房間放菜單紙，你需要什麼食物和飲料自己勾選後，將菜單掛到房間外，晚上有人來收走，第二天根據你點的東西送，就不會出現浪費食物的現象。這種方式對廚房來説是稍微麻煩一些，畢竟每個房間要準備的食物不同，有出錯的可能性，但更人性化，更節約食物。好的酒店不僅僅是豪華的硬件，更多的應該是向社會大眾提倡一些好的中華民族的傳統美德。比如減少浪費糧食，節約資源。

msg:優先：
私湯和公共温泉都很棒；未能安排接車但能改為打車報銷，處理得很靈活，很好；在嘉陵江邊能看到市民游泳、泡野温泉，很有趣味；早茶精緻；酒店裡有寺廟挺有意思

缺點：
最大的缺點是泡公共温泉的外來人能在酒店區域裏閑逛，不安全，降低私密；
酒店裡國道太近，夜間貨車開過聲音好響。。。
這兩個缺點讓酒店大為掉價
