msg:We traveled with a group of 6 people, booked 3 rooms without a window, this was the best sleep of our lives) the rooms have mega comfortable beds, excellent hard mattresses, even the pillows are comfortable. The rooms are always clean and tidy (cleaned daily). Bottles of drinking water and soap supplies are renewed every day (brush, toothpaste, comb, shampoo, shower gel and soap are provided).
The breakfasts are delicious - there is plenty to choose from, there is both local food and European food (we ate an omelette and vegetables and fruits every day).
Convenient location: the hotel is located on the 3rd ring and there are 2 different metro lines nearby, so getting to any attractions was not difficult.
And a special thank you for the early check-in! We arrived at 5 am, were at the hotel at 7, we wanted to at least leave our suitcases, but they checked us in! Thanks a lot!

The hotel facilities are very old.
The place that can be praised is that there are many rooms.
The most unacceptable thing is that the water quality is very poor. . It's deadly.

I called to complain, and the front desk told me that it would be clean water after 20-30 minutes of boiling water, but it was the same after 30 minutes, which is unacceptable. One word: dirty

msg:First of all, I would like to thank the hotel for changing me to a room with a window for free when I was feeling unwell.
Secondly, let’s talk about the problem
1. The safety chain on the door of the room I was moved to was broken;
2. Because the bathroom in the room is 5 floors higher, it cannot supply hot water for bathing;
3. At noon the next day, I went to renew at 1 o'clock. For a four-hour room, there was no discount for the room. Moreover, after paying the money, the key card was not updated for me. As a result, I couldn't open the door after I went out. I sat on the ground waiting for the waiter to open the door.
The hotel is relatively large, but the facilities are old. You cannot charge directly via USB. You need to bring a plug🔌

The recreational gym attached to the hotel needs to be charged separately and is extremely expensive. I personally feel that the price/performance ratio is not particularly high. But the service was very good and in place. The front desk also upgraded the room to a room with a window for free. Overall, it was a decent stay experience. If you want to attend conferences, exhibitions and other activities here or nearby, it is really good to book a night here. However, if the first purpose of coming to Beijing is sightseeing and you don’t have enough travel funds. If so, I personally recommend choosing some more cost-effective express hotels.

msg:I came here to attend an exhibition. Since the exhibition is right next to the multi-functional hall, I decided to stay there for three days and two nights just for convenience.
Let’s talk about the advantages first. The room is large and the service is very friendly. Fruits will be delivered when you check in, which is very considerate.
In terms of shortcomings, the first one is the facilities. The air volume of the air conditioner in the room I stayed in is about 0. If someone goes out to run a few hundred meters and comes back to gasp for air, the wind is stronger than it. I discovered this problem and reported it the first time I checked in. The staff who came to see the situation claimed that the air conditioner was like this and the temperature would be higher because the room faced the sun. I believed this at first until I went to the same hotel where I stayed. Ask other friends’ rooms for confirmation. The room air conditioner has almost no effect, this is one of them;
Secondly, although the accommodation conditions are very good, the breakfast conditions in the hotel are really not even as good as some three-star/fast standards. The type, quality, ambient light, and replenishment speed of food and drinks are completely incompatible with the quality of the accommodation. not equal. While eating breakfast, I even had the urge to find seasonings to optimize the fried rice. Although I was mentally prepared, I didn't expect that it didn't work beyond my expectation. Even the "other standards of the benchmark store" were not met. If you can't do it, it will be really difficult for people to evaluate.
The third is some minor problems such as poor cooling of the refrigerator in the room, ineffective elevator access control, and holes in the towels changed the next day. These can probably be attributed to the age of the hotel.
In short, I just booked it here recently. It has advantages and disadvantages, but I personally hope that the breakfast issue can be at least optimized for the sake of the hotel's reputation.

msg:It was my first time to stay in a room without air conditioning in a five-star hotel. It was hot and stuffy all night. After reporting it to the front desk, they wanted to change me to a room without windows. They said that the central air conditioning was not turned on. My sky was so big. The five-star hotel in Fengtai District of Beijing, which is also the front of the Dahongmen International Conference Center, couldn't even provide air conditioning for the guests. In the end, the front desk was forced to change me to a room with a window at almost 00:00 in the morning so that I could rest. Overall In terms of accommodation, the Dahongmen International Conference Center can be thought of as a three-star hotel, which is more appropriate. I also hope that the relevant units will see that it is properly managed. There are still five-star hotels in Beijing with such poor management from the rooms to the hotel. This place is really unbelievable
There are no other free facilities. The only ones are the landscaped garden and pavilion at the entrance. Compared with other five-star hotels, there are many swimming pools, gyms, etc. that guests can use for free.
There is nothing here, so choose carefully

msg:The hotel is really bad, I'm making an exception this time since I never comment on it! !
The facilities in the room were old, and it was as dark as two in the middle of the night when entering the room. The whole family searched for half an hour before fumbling to turn on all the lights. All the floor lamps were not plugged into sockets. The bathroom doesn't even have shampoo and toiletries. The room is as cold as an ice cellar. The air conditioner barely warms up after being turned on all night, and the air conditioner makes a lot of noise.
The attitude of the front desk is very different. I am known as a nice guy and easy to talk to, so I was in a hurry with the front desk twice:
For the first time, I was afraid that the takeaway could not find the small building where I lived, because the Gaode map did not show the building where I was, and I couldn’t tell clearly when I came here for the first time. Did you say takeaway?"
The second time, the next morning, I asked the front desk where to eat breakfast. The front desk said it was in Meihuayuan. I said that today’s chess match was in Meihuayuan. I just came back from there. Children are not allowed to enter. The front desk said, "Then I didn't know that the notification I received was in Plum Blossom Garden" and I was stunned. I'm talking about the front desk on the night of February 10th and the morning of the 11th!
Let's talk about breakfast, who said that there are so many varieties of breakfast? There is no other word to describe it. The most disgusting thing is that most of the breakfast is all kinds of stir-fried vegetables. The tongs and trays used to hold vegetables are full of vegetable leaves that guests have missed. The entire buffet countertop is no different from the kitchen waste bin.
This is the worst and worst hotel I have stayed in with my baby for ten years. My husband has traveled countless times, and this time he also said that this hotel is really, really bad! ! ! ! ! !

msg:Booked a parent-child room. There is one queen bed and two single beds. I originally decided to bring my children here to participate in the Rubik's Cube competition, but later the Rubik's Cube competition was cancelled, so I lived here for tourism. The cleaning lady was very enthusiastic and polite. She asked us what we wanted and gave us two extra bottles of mineral water. Feel well trained. Originally, I had to change hotels in three days. Considering the reason of the epidemic, I decided to stay here for another three days. The wall and quilt of the little yellow man are very cute, I like it! Plush darts for kids to play with. There are dragonflies and butterflies on the curtains. There are also small animals on the plug, which is very childlike. After renewing the house today, the housekeeper also gave us fruit plates, yogurt, and colored pens and plush dolphins for the children. We had a great time here! Also very comfortable! grateful!

msg:The service and sanitation of the hotel are good, and the breakfast is quite delicious. The room facilities are a bit old, but the washing facilities are okay. The surrounding city interface is a bit worse. There is a garden, but it seems to be arranged very casually. A few sculptures are still inconsistent with fish lamps, so I can't bear to look directly at them. How should I put it, I can only say that all the hotels in Beijing are less cost-effective than other places in the country. This is a city attitude issue not the hotel's issue.
