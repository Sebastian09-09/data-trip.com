Room was clean and view was amazing. However not a big fan of the room facilities especially the AI toilet (not sure why it must flush the moment I sit down every time). The shower also floods every time it is used. As I stayed here with a friend (not a couple) the barely frosted glass on the shower and toilet doors meant we had to be very comfortable with each other. The staff were on the whole polite but service was inconsistent- some staff were friendlier than others. One of the staff started shutting off the restaurant facilities before we were done with dinner which I felt was an awkward way to hurry us. Special thanks to 橙子 谢谢你热情友善的服务- 特别感谢祢平时的帮助 还帮助我们定票， 规划怎么玩。

The room is well designed and equipped with high-end facilities. You can see the sunrise on Jinshan Mountain while lying in the room! The location is really great, the proportion of public areas is just right, and there are many free projects
The dishes in the restaurant are also above expectations, the hot pot is very delicious, and the hotel's homemade wine is also very delicious haha.
The service is meticulous and in place~ The ladies are so gentle
I chose horseback riding as an experience project, which is right next to the homestay, and it is also highly recommended
I will definitely choose this place next time I come to Lijiang!

The location of the entire hotel is very good, between Yuhu Village and Longnu Lake, away from the commercial streets, it should be the most comfortable location in the entire area. The check-in experience is very good. The front desk lady upgraded us to the Snow Mountain View Room. You can see Yulong Snow Mountain while lying on the bed. It is a great experience! The hot pot sent by the hotel is delicious, with a lot of vegetables and very healthy. Although it is a double hot pot, the four of us can't finish it. In addition, the fruit is also delicious! It's a pity that it can't be mailed. I especially like the lady serving in the restaurant, she is super cute! ! My favorite activity is to go up the mountain to pick pine cones. We participated in it for two consecutive days. Uncle and brother took turns to take us up the mountain, and there was also a puppy guide! I saw a completely different mountain landscape from my hometown. When we came, it was not the season for mushrooms to grow, and it was a pity that we didn't pick mushrooms. Finally, all the service staff of ****ou House are super warm! Looking forward to coming again next time!

The lady who picked me up was very nice! The other ladies and brothers in the hotel were very nice! The baby had a lot of fun, and the handicrafts made by the baby in the hotel have been posted in the hotel. I went to Longnu Lake for horseback riding for two consecutive days. When I left, I asked when I would come again next time. I think my daughter has fallen in love with horseback riding. Visit the Naxi family! Feel the Naxi culture, papermaking, writing, etc. hand in hand with the Naxi grandfather! The journey is beautiful and short. Because there are other itineraries to be arranged later. This trip to Stone House is over! Thank you again to everyone in Stone House, your kindness and enthusiasm touched us. I am a person who basically does not write reviews. A few lines of text cannot reflect your goodness. I can only say here that I look forward to meeting you next time! Goodbye everyone!

msg:Don't hesitate when you see this comment, just book this place, eat my recommendation!! Coming here is like going to the home of a friend who is a social bull but lively, hospitable and tasteful. Once you come here, you will become a tap water and miss the happy time here!!
The architectural design, architectural style and overall layout of the stone house are really great, with ideal ethnic customs, natural environment and modern facilities. The whole courtyard is open and bright, and every corner is very good. The sharing of public space and the privacy of personal space are well balanced. You can make tea quietly in the room, or read books, do handicrafts and chat with other guests in the public space. It's not like living in a homestay, but more like another life.
What's even better is all the service staff here, they are like many friends in a big family. I especially cherish the attitude of the service staff here to put the convenience and satisfaction of the guests first. From the time the driver picked up the station at the train station, he grabbed the luggage and carried it. When I arrived at the stone house, the friends of the homestay had already put the luggage at the door of the room before I got to the room. The young lady of the homestay will help arrange time as much as possible so that we can participate in various activities. Even at the end, the guy at the homestay drove us to the next scenic spot and parked the car at the luggage storage area carefully so that we could walk less. This kind of care and attentiveness made us feel that we were well taken care of. When we said goodbye, we really looked forward to coming back for the next trip and we would see each other again soon.
btw It is worth coming just for the various activities in the stone house! Going up the mountain with the uncle, visiting the homes of the Naxi people, tasting the roasted tea of ​​the horse caravan, this experience not only enhances the quality of the trip, but also gives us a life that we have never had before and a world that seems to be another possibility.

msg:It has been more than two weeks since I came back from Yunnan. I suddenly found that I was still very interested in Lijiang, Yunnan. It was probably because I chartered a car to Lijiang and stayed at ****oucuo as soon as I arrived. The name of the hotel is also a good name, which makes people feel the tranquility and beauty of returning to nature. I set off from Shuanglang, Dali at 12:30 noon and arrived at the front desk of ****oucuo at 4 o'clock. The housekeeper will thoughtfully bring a cup of hot milk tea to wash away the fatigue of walking on the mountain road.

The housekeepers are like family members who have never met. They are kind and easy-going. The service is also very considerate. The messages in the group are replied in time. The hotel also provides laundry services, fruit snacks, coffee, milk tea and hot cocoa at any time.

Every corner of the hotel seems to be carefully decorated. You can take pictures with a camera at will. The entire hotel building and the layout in the room are integrated and reflected with the scenery of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. Fortunately, I opened my eyes the next morning and saw the sun shining on Jinshan. The feeling of being there is very dreamy. I was even more shocked as I had never seen a snow-capped mountain. The wind blew the lush trees and grass at the foot of the mountain and the clear water in the pool in front of the yard. It turned out that landscape paintings were just like this.

Unfortunately, my schedule in Lijiang was quite rushed. I was busy with private activities and did not participate in the hotel's pine cone picking DIY memorial photo frame and other activities. I looked at the photos sent by the housekeeper and felt that the photo frames made by other guests were very beautiful. I went to Lijiang Ancient Town in the evening and experienced the crowded night market. It made people return to the crowded and urgent feeling in the city. I unconsciously preferred the tranquility of the stone house and the comfort of watching the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain up close. The stone house deep in nature is really relaxing!

The design of the hotel room is really better than the photos. The wood and cream color are very new. All the supplies are high-end brands. It is so comfortable that I don’t want to go anywhere. I just want to lie in the hotel and watch the snow-capped mountains.
The hotel staff has very good service. Unfortunately, it rained and I couldn’t go to the mountain to pick fruits. The next day, I went to the outdoor horseback riding project. It cost 880 per person. To be honest, it was worth it. It was more fun than queuing up to go to the snow-capped mountains. There were only two of us. When we got to the mountain, the scenery was very spectacular. I need to suggest that the food cooked on the mountain is not delicious. The villagers said that we can actually choose roast beef, but no one asked us what we wanted to eat. It would be better if we could inform them in advance. And I saw on Xiaohongshu that many people can go to the snow-capped mountains to ride horses back and forth for a few hundred yuan. There is no need to book with the hotel.
In general, this hotel can really be of international level. Like

The room we booked was upgraded to p9, which is a hotel room with a view of the snow-capped mountains outside. The room facilities are the same as those of a five-star hotel. The toiletries are the same as those of the Park Hyatt. You can ride horses within walking distance of the hotel. We were very lucky and saw sheep and calves.
The most distinctive thing is the hotel's service. The staff care about you like friends. They will arrange various activities for you throughout the day and accompany you without paying. We experienced the Sanduo Festival, doing handicrafts and horse riding, which were all unforgettable experiences.
We had the hotel's yak hotpot. It was much better than the one in Lijiang Old Town. You can have free fruit and drink. The blueberries are super delicious. There are many kinds of breakfast.

The first pick-up service made us feel enthusiastic. Because we arrived late, Miss Sanduo waited for us for nearly an hour. When we arrived, we were attracted by the decoration style of the hotel. Most of them were made of stone, which was very charming. Features: The service attitude of the butler Luo Zhixiang and the front desk staff is very good, warm and thoughtful, they will ask us what we want to drink to warm ourselves, and help us carry our luggage to the room.
The first time we stayed in a double bed room with a snow mountain view, we could see the starry sky when we looked up. When we opened the curtains, we could see the snow mountains. We could see the Rizhao Jinshan Mountains without leaving the house. It was so unforgettable.

The hotel also provides a variety of activities, including handicrafts, picking, horse riding, roasted tea, Naxi home visits, and bonfire parties. Even if the weather is bad, you can cook wine, sing, and chat around the fire with the staff and other guests at the front desk. It is so happy. The hotel The atmosphere is very nice. Since our friends sang a lot of Jay Chou's songs, the staff said they would customize Jay Chou's work badges for us in Stone House. Unexpectedly, we actually got them after we checked in! We originally planned to go to other cities, but were completely blown away by ****oucuo, so we decided to come back and stay for another three nights. The second time we stayed in a side-snow king bed room, it was also very good.

****oucuo is the life we ​​long for. It is our second home. We are grateful to our family for their company and care. Brother Ma, Sister Xiao Min, Luo Zhixiang, Louis Koo, everyone who can't bear to leave the Stone House, are waiting for us to come back!

The environment is amazing! Open the curtains and face the snow-capped mountains. It’s a super movie and you don’t have to climb the mountain. You don’t have to get up too early. You can see the sunshine of Jinshan Mountain!
Excellent service! Because I have been sick with a cold these past two days, I feel like I have been bothering everyone by making medicine, bringing me breakfast to the room, lighting the fireplace, and taking photos and videos for me (I would like to thank Miss Orange for your kindness. The kind-hearted guy Lahahao kept taking videos and photos for me and even helped me think of a good place to take the pictures!!!)

msg:Village at the foot of the snow-capped mountains, riding horses through the canyon
Is there any more exciting combination than this!
Stone House is the top accommodation in Yuhu. The overall style can be seen to be high-end wild luxury. The environment is very beautiful, but during the Chinese New Year, there are many people and it is a bit noisy. There is nothing particularly impressive about it. (It’s a pity that I didn’t see the starry sky)
Personally, I think the best thing is the custom-made horseback riding trip through the canyon by ****oucuo. The leader of the caravan designed a route through the wilderness and through the canyon. This can be regarded as a life experience! It would be better if there were fewer branches on the route!
Horseback riding experience: The starting point is the stables of Yuhu Village, passing through the village, passing through the pine forest, and arriving at the open meadow at the foot of the snow-capped mountains. This is a secret place. There is only one horse team in the entire canyon, and the sound of horse hooves and horse bells echoes in the canyon. The altitude increases from 2800m to 3400m. As the altitude increases, the canyon shows different levels of beauty, from rich vegetation to golden meadows to the huge mountains and glaciers at the end. They are all different shocks. We are just like this step by step Going deep into the hinterland of the Jade Dragon Canyon, we were welcomed by the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, and light snow fell on the way back. The gravel roads and loess roads along the way were made step by step by horses. This section was once the route of the Ancient Tea Horse Road.
Picnic experience: caravan roasted tea + fire to cook meat and vegetables. The caravans traditionally drink salty Pu'er tea to replenish their physical strength. The water source comes from a piece of glacier cut in the cave.
#This world cannot be without small animals! !
The golden retriever Doudou and the beagle Huahua are really in the wilderness. They accompany their owners on 20-30 kilometers of mountain roads every day, running freely on the grasslands and touring in the forests. They are everywhere in the dust raised by the horses' hooves, guarding them throughout the process. As the cavalry marches forward, I have never seen a dog with such a free spirit! !

We also made handmade refrigerator magnets, and no matter where we went, there would be a special car to pick us up and drop us off, which saved us worry and effort. I was so sad when I left, and I look forward to seeing you next time. Oh, the most important thing is that we saw the Rizhao Jinshan Mountain while lying on the bed in the room. We were so happy. Next time we will stay a few more days. We won’t go anywhere, just lie down in the hotel and watch the snow-capped mountains.

The sisters at the front desk are all very beautiful! There is a separate WeChat service group, and the replies are very timely! From check-in to check-out, I didn’t pick up my luggage once, and the lady came to pick up my laundry and then washed it and sent it to the room!

Three meals a day are served at the hotel, the ingredients are super fresh, and fruits and drinks are free! Both highland barley wine and plum wine are made by ourselves! Delicious! (The hidden menu allows you to secretly drink the boss’s private wine. Don’t ask, if you ask, you will secretly drink four cups in three days😎) Strawberries, blueberries, and mangoes are all super sweet! In addition to three meals a day, there is also afternoon tea and milk before going to bed. The lady at the front desk feeds me to full every day!

Write a separate paragraph to express your love for the roasted milk at the front desk! ! ! Really awesome! ! ! No one can resist a cup of hot roasted milk with a rich aroma of tea and milk! I had five or six drinks in three days and two nights, and I even took two drinks with me when I left! ! ! It’s really super super super super super delicious! ! !

The hotel activities include horse riding on Longnv Lake➕Naxi home visit➕pine cone picking➕homemade plant photo frames and refrigerator magnets! It’s all super fun and meaningful! I took away the beautiful photo frames and refrigerator magnets I made and the Dongba script I wrote!

During dinner and bonfire party, I met Louis Koo, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Daniel Wu, and some other tourists! It was really super fun for everyone to sing, dance, drink and chat together! Wuwuwu Stone House is my only home in Lijiang! ! !

Wait until I get home, soon! ! !

P.S. I took away Louis Koo’s work badge. Remember to exchange it with me for Liu Yifei’s next time you come back. From now on, I will be Liu Yifei from Stone House! ! !

The hotel's lawn is also a must-have for taking pictures of snow-capped mountains! You can ride horses, pick pine cones, and do crafts every day, and you can also set off fireworks in the evening. The only regret is that the bonfire party was not held because of the wind these two days😭

msg:I made an impromptu decision to go to Lijiang during the Spring Festival and booked a room at Stone House. When I booked, there was only one room left. I booked a room with a snow mountain view. It was a very surprising experience.

Open the window and see the mountain: The large floor-to-ceiling window faces the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. If you open the curtains, you can see the Rizhao Jinshan Mountain.

You don’t need to travel with your brain: when you book a hotel, you can choose one of three itineraries. I chose the Naxi home visit. I went to the local people’s homes to experience their way of life. You can play for a whole morning. Recommended! There are also horse riding and sightseeing options, so I’ll go there next time. It also comes with afternoon tea, picking, handmade DIY, roasting tea by the fire, and bonfire party. The activities are rich and can be arranged by the hotel.

Free coffee and free fruit are all free, especially the coffee is delicious. Two cups are ordered and delivered to the room every day.

When you return to your room at night, you can ask the housekeeper to light a bonfire. The outdoor private hot spring uses spring water from the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. It will be covered with disposable bags, which is clean and hygienic. There is also airport pick-up or drop-off service for one-night stay, which is very considerate.

You can buy all the handicrafts in the hotel, and we took a tile cat with us when we left.

The hotel housekeeper Cheng Zi learned that it was my wife's birthday and specially ordered a birthday cake for us. The chanterelle mushrooms in the hotel restaurant were delicious, and they packed a jar for us to take away before we left.

The uncle at the hotel (forgot his name) also went to pick pine nuts from the trees for us and packed a lot of them to take away. When we go home, we can continue our crafts or peel out the fresh pine nuts to eat.

I will recommend it to my friends and will come again if I have the chance. The second phase of expansion is under way, looking forward to it.

msg:How to express it?

After all, it is a hotel that echoes the snow-capped mountains and nature.

The whole experience is unmatched by other hotels.

In order to fully experience the various activities arranged by the hotel, I stayed for three nights.

From the moment we were picked up at the hotel in the ancient town on the first morning, the whole experience was destined to be extremely wonderful.

We arrived at the hotel around 9:30 on the 31st, got on the horse directly, and paid to experience horse riding and hiking in the Grand Canyon. I am particularly grateful to Brother Ma for taking care of my four-year-old child. He endured the torture of two people sitting on a saddle that should have been for one person for several hours, and laughed and sang loudly with the child all the way. I had to carry him on my back all the way on the road where I couldn't ride a horse. It gives my wife and I a lot of peace of mind. The child said this was his first old friend here. The child was even jokingly called "big brother" by Marco and fellow passengers. And became famous instantly. In the next few days, the ladies in the hotel also jokingly called him big brother. Let him lose himself step by step. The scenery of the Grand Canyon is extremely beautiful. Although it didn't snow. But the experience of being infinitely close to the snow-capped mountains without a large number of tourists still left a deep impression on people.

On the night of the 31st, I participated in the New Year’s Eve bonfire prepared by the hotel. The tourists and the hotel’s handsome guys and beauties sang and danced together, drank wine and ate barbecue, and the show kept laughing. But it was a pity that the baby couldn't hold it and was withdrawn early.

On the 1st, I experienced free picking of pine cones on the mountain. The hotel boss enthusiastically explained everything along the way. The doll accidentally fell down and was encouraged by the oversized pine cone.

On the 2nd, I experienced a Naxi home visit, wore traditional Naxi costumes, and learned about the history and customs of the Naxi people. Together with the dolls, we experienced the making and tasting of stone-ground soy milk, Dongba paper making, Dongba writing, etc. The child said that the sister who took him through the experience was the second old friend he made.

The hotel offers free drinks, free fruits, and mineral water including Vosse and Perrier. The fruits are also fresh local seasonal fruits. Among the complimentary hotpots, the most recommended is the cured pork ribs hotpot. It's delicious without dipping in water. The hotel bathroom supplies are also from foreign brands, and the sofas are also designed and full of comfort. I feel like all the details try to match his house price.

In fact, the most praiseworthy thing is its service. First of all, the ladies and brothers all have the looks of Rosamund Kwan, Joey Wong, Louis Koo, and Daniel Wu. Especially the young ladies look even more beautiful wearing Naxi costumes. The service is extremely enthusiastic, patient, and proactive in helping, asking, and feeding. People gradually get lost.

Child No. 3 is reluctant to leave. He said, I will come back.

Yes we will be back. When my eldest brother is older.

msg:A place that can currently be called the ceiling of a B&B. Last year I was amazed when I first came here. This year I brought my family to celebrate the New Year. It was basically the same as I remembered.

Facilities: Different room types feel quite different, but the overall hardware is great, comparable to star hotels, and it is also clean and tidy.

Environment: On the edge of Yuhu Village, next to Longnu Lake, it’s okay to take photos of Jinshan in the morning.

Service: Best, bar none. One of the bosses mentioned that their store focuses on providing customers with emotional value, which is actually very appropriate. All the staff like and are willing to chat with you, all over the place. Maybe the neighborhood has not been fully developed yet, so most of the people have simple and honest customs, which I hope to keep as much as possible.

Catering: It's basically all-inclusive, and the products are stable and the ingredients are OK. Beer soaked in wine and red wine drinks, strawberries, cantaloupe and oranges, I will miss you😎 But for the rice noodles for breakfast, you can try one more of your local methods, although I understand that you want to conform to the public's taste and let the guests add their own condiments. But from Lugu Lake to Lijiang Old Town, the rice noodles you eat are better.

Finally, the free activities are enough for two days. This time I went to the Grand Canyon, which is a self-funded project. The scenery is not as beautiful as I imagined, but the process can be selected as one of the journeys of life. The horse is very stable and has a lot of personality. It lasted a full 5 hours. The companionship is really worth it.

Suggestion: If you have time, it is recommended to stay here for 2 nights. If you are in a hurry to stay for 1 night, try to arrive as early as possible. This is not the kind of B&B where you can only stay in your room.

I look forward to you developing more new routes. Keep up the other activities and see you again😊 Oh, and the prices will remain stable...get more discounts haha

I like the stone exterior facade, simple interior, and light wild luxury style. The altitude is more than 2,000 meters, which is relatively friendly to me. The stone and glass building against the background of snow-capped mountains and green pine trees is full of design. The bathrooms in the rooms are all glass partitions and the boundaries are not good.
The main focus of the service is sincerity and enthusiasm. The lady in the front office is very, very good, picks up and drops off, carries boxes, is full of energy, and speaks modestly and sincerely. Luo Zhixiang was very careful in introducing us to the room, and he was also reliable and reassuring in carrying our luggage and leading the group. What also impressed me deeply was Xiao Mu and Princess at the front desk. I didn't have much contact with them, but I could feel their natural and simple temperament.
Finally, I want to nitpick. The management service should be designed from the top. Relying only on personal enthusiasm will always lead to misalignment. Residents will always pass by in a hurry and may not understand the hard work behind the scenes. This will inevitably have a negative impact on people who are enthusiastic about their work. Spend time.
All in all, it was a pleasant stay and I would recommend it to young friends😊

I have stayed in many international high-end hotels, wild luxury hotels, and B&Bs, but there are still very few people who want to continue my stay right away.

The Stone House is ideal and distant, and you can see the sunshine and golden mountains from your room.
The round-the-clock and enthusiastic service of the housekeepers and staff is almost always responsive. You can see from the eyes of every service staff that their enthusiasm comes from the heart rather than "management requirements". Services include but are not limited to airport pick-up and drop-off, informing Rizhao Jinshan and Activity times, good night hot cocoa and more.

Although there are not many choices of meals, the ingredients are very good. Fruits, strawberries, blueberries, figs, and milk dates are all available in unlimited quantities. The accompanying drinks voss, Perrier, yogurt, etc. are all available for free. It is really all-inclusive. It’s very worry-free. The coffee and milk tea are all handmade and very professional. The wine is also brewed by the hotel itself. If you have mulled wine, you must try it. It’s great!

The hotel has a full schedule of activities, including hiking, horse riding, handicrafts, bonfire parties... You will not feel bored during the whole stay. We stayed for 2 nights, but we felt that it was not enough for 3-4 nights next time.

Although the public area is relatively small, it has everything it needs. I heard that there will be a second phase of expansion in the future, so I am looking forward to it! I hope that every time I come here, I will feel this sense of returning home after a long absence. You must stick to your original intention~

Enjoyed dinner and breakfast at the hotel, tasted local delicacies, and had unlimited drinks (very satisfying🤗)

The service attitude of all the hotel staff is first-class and they will help with luggage. The ladies and brothers are very hospitable. In the evening, the hotel owner Xiang personally entertained us and we chatted and drank until the early morning.

In addition, the hotel also helped me decorate and send me a small cake for free to celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday🎂

￼This kitchen experience was very good. In addition to encountering a high-quality room, I also made a group of friends (I should say family members 😂). I look forward to going home next time!

msg:I was very happy to stay at ****oucuo this time. The view of Longnu Lake is worth visiting again in the summer. The yak meat hot pot, cured pork ribs hot pot, fried yak meat and caravan rice were all very delicious. We even ate a lot of sweet potatoes on the milk tea stove. It is a guest with a lot of needs. I finished burning the firewood twice. After seeing the scenery on the first floor, I changed to the room on the second floor. The uncle who took us to pick pine cones heard that I liked the sea buckthorn branches in their store. The next day, he took us to pick it alone. Now when I look at the seabuckthorn branches at home, I am still very moved. Luo Zhixiang, a child in 1998, heard that I was not comfortable riding a tram. When I dropped him off at the airport, it drove smoothly and smoothly, and I almost didn't even have to brake. I haven’t stepped on anyone. They are really a group of simple and friendly friends. Everyone is very nice. I will come again in the summer.

msg:I had a severe high fever while traveling in Sichuan. Considering my physical fitness and not wanting to get up early to climb mountains to see Rizhao Jinshan Mountain, I randomly chose this place to live on Ctrip. However, the living experience was very good. Taking advantage of the snow-view room, I sat on the balcony with a cup of hot milk tea and watched the snow-capped mountains for more than two hours. I calmed down alone, sorted out the past of 2023, and thought about the road to 2024. The temperature was relatively low at night. I thought, "I've come here, why not try a bonfire party? As a serious I person, I'll probably retreat after 5 minutes." I actually danced Guozhuang with Luo Zhixiang and Louis Koo (staff), and it was so cold. One day, I was sweating all over, and I was lucky enough to meet another couple of guests playing Gatling. The starry sky that night was strange but warm. As expected, the high-reflector showed up. The lady in the hotel prepared an oxygen bottle and a Lux bar in my luggage when I went to Yunshanping. I was really touched. Although she was much younger than me, she was very attentive to her job. Make yourself more professional and provide a better accommodation experience. After participating in the horse riding activity, the Jade Girl Lake with the sun setting in the west is as beautiful as picturesque without the need for special effects. Of course, the most beautiful thing may not be the photos taken along the lake, but every staff member who performs his duties conscientiously and wants to record the beautiful moment. Traveler. I personally like the decoration style of the hotel. It is convenient to lie down and enjoy the moment of peace brought by vacation. The facilities are good~ I will recommend it to my friends~ The picture is the original picture~

I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a starry sky room, facing the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. I could lie in bed and watch the sunshine on Jinshan Mountain both mornings.

When traveling with children, the beautiful sisters interact with the children lovingly. The hotel arranges many activities and will remind and communicate with us in time.
Food: There is a complimentary hot pot for dinner every day, and the ingredients are plentiful and fresh. In addition, you can also order individual meals, which taste very good. Dianhong roasted milk tea and fresh fruits are available throughout the day, which is a favorite among children.

msg:The boss is full of sincerity and cares about the user's experience. The configuration is also very luxurious. It is basically an all-you-can-eat state. He is always responsive to requests. You can see the boss's behavior.
The location is on the edge of Longnv Lake and very convenient to the village center.
The decoration of the public areas is also very tasteful and the overall look is beautiful.
Let’s talk about the shortcomings: We stayed in a twin room, but there was no shelter outside the bathroom. It was very inconvenient to change clothes after taking a shower. Whether we were traveling with children or friends, since it was not a double room, this was not considered. Woolen cloth?
The second intelligent system's air conditioner was insufficient, which was later solved through central control.
Lijiang is really cold in winter, especially near the snow-capped mountains. It’s cold and dry.
If the boss 🈶️continues to maintain the quality or plans to renovate, it is recommended to add floor heating.
Overall, I felt quite happy eating and drinking.

msg:In order to make it easier to visit Yunu Lake and Yuhu Village, I found this hotel nearby. The stay experience was beyond expectations. Although the room price is not low, it is really worth it!
1. Very cost-effective
There are too many free items given away by the hotel, and most of them are very practical:
The business car picked us up from the airport to the hotel. When we left, we were picked up at the place where we played and sent to the next hotel;
There is free hot pot for dinner. We ate for 2 days. We tried yak meat and cured pork ribs hot pot, and also ordered some local dishes. They were very delicious and not expensive.
There are also various free activities. We participated in pine cone picking and hand-making, and horseback riding experiences by the lake.
2. considerate service
The housekeeper added us on WeChat a few days in advance to confirm the pick-up time and precautions with us, which was very considerate.
Although it is not a family hotel, it is very child-friendly and the boys and girls in the hotel are very considerate. Clothes can be washed, and good night milk and hot cocoa are provided.
3. It’s so beautiful
Both day and night have their own beauty. The hotel's light and shadow design is very clever and very cinematic.
The room type we booked can see the Rizhao Jinshan Mountain through the window, which is really comfortable.
Next time I’ll stay a few more days and ride a horse through the Grand Canyon during my summer vacation.

You can watch the sunshine on Jinshan Mountain while lying on the bed!The key point is that compared to traditional brand hotels, the service at Stone House is very warm and thoughtful, and almost all of the employees (all of whom have outrageous stage names hahaha) are social talents. After a day stay, there are a full schedule of various activities, and drinks (coffee, Perrier, Coke) are free. The main thing is that you will not be allowed to leave until you have a foot to walk and a soft belly until you are full.
The supplies are also of high quality, including hand sanitizer from Bairdol, laundry detergent from Le labo, Dyson hair dryer and Marshall audio.

The local chicken mushroom and yak pot are both delicious, each with its own characteristics. I also ordered the snow mountain fish, the meat is very firm.
It's delicious, but I just can't finish it. Hahahaha. So much meat and drinks.
Drinks were freely available, including roasted tea and mulled wine. In the evening, we also participated in a fire party to look at the stars in Lijiang's sky. In front of the hotel is Longnu Lake, which has beautiful scenery with few people. I tried horseback riding, went for a walk in Yuhu Village, and visited Yuzhu Qingtian when I left. The unique culture of the Naxi people is really fascinating.
at last! What a surprise. The room is like One Hundred Years of Solitude, which I love so much!

The only shortcoming is that the room we arranged is relatively biased. We booked a double bed room with a snow mountain view just to view the snow mountain. The view was half blocked by pine trees. On the second night of my stay, the power in the room was cut off in the early morning. In the morning, I found that the circuit breaker in the room had tripped.

There is a lot of activity in hotel projects. We arrived at close to 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and the hotel guy who picked us up arranged rubbings for us on the way (Picture 1).
Then we went to the lake in front of the hotel to ride horses, take photos, etc.
Dinner was yak meat pot, and I took a fancy to the wine list brewed by their hotel, including highland barley wine and whiskey base (Picture 2). I don’t have enough drinking capacity, so I couldn’t taste them all.
Went to attend a bonfire party around 9pm, singing, dancing, chatting, bragging and setting off fireworks. It was quite fun (Pictures 3 and 4).

morning. From the room we stayed in, around 7:30 in the morning, we could see the Rizhao Jinshan Mountain.
We didn't even have time to brush our teeth at that time, so we rushed to the grassland in front of the B&B, near the lake, and just clicked and took pictures. It was very photogenic! ! (Figure 5-8)
I had rice noodles for breakfast, and the fried mushrooms were so fragrant!

morning. We both decided to ride horses with the Naxi people to the Dongba Grand Canyon at 9 o'clock (Figure 9-12). A total of 4-5 hours on horseback (depending on how fast you are) between going back and forth and having a picnic. Unfortunately, I got altitude sickness when I reached an altitude of over 3,000 meters. Fortunately, there were oxygen tanks at the picnic.
Since we were catching the high-speed train, the Naxi guy kindly asked the chef to take us back to the hotel on the way back, as he was afraid it would be too late. This driver is a god, he can guard the mountains, arrange flowers, and take pictures.

afternoon. When I left the hotel at 3 o'clock, due to high fever, the hotel guy kindly brought me a huge box of sunshine roses to supplement my sugar content, which made my high-speed rail journey extremely happy (Picture 13).

[The Dianhong roasted milk tea cooked in the hotel is very delicious (Picture 14), the milk skin is very thick, at least we drank 7-8 cups in total, and the kind-hearted lady at the front desk even sent me the recipe. The hotel’s German shepherd is so cute (Picture 15). I also took away two cans of fried mushrooms (Picture 16) and two cans of olive vegetables. It’s really embarrassing that you can even eat and take it. If it weren't for the fact that yak ****y couldn't pass customs, I would have brought two packs of ****y with me. . . 】

In front of the hotel is Longnu Lake, which has beautiful scenery with few people. I experienced free horse riding around the lake. I envy those who can ride horses. You can also ride wildly by yourself. There are still many optional activities in the hotel. We went to Yuhu Village the next day. I walked around for a while, but unfortunately I didn’t have enough time. Otherwise, I would have gone to the Snow Mountain Grand Canyon on horseback. It sounds like fun too.

This time I decided to take my parents together. I chose the Stone House, which was newly opened last year and is located in the unpopular Yuhu Village.
From airport pick-up to check-in, to participating in activities, eating and drinking, everything was great. The hotel provides free water, freshly ground coffee, milk tea, sparkling water, yogurt drinks, and a free hot pot. Horseback riding around Longnu Lake is also free. Fruit freedom is available in the hotel
The room is large and equipped with smart home. It is so comfortable when the sun shines in.
In the morning, you can walk to Longnu Lake for 2 minutes to see the Rizhao Jinshan Mountain, and you can walk to the commercial street of Yuhu Village in 10 minutes. Everything is still under development, so there are few people, which is really good.
The hotel staff are all local young people. They are very friendly, enthusiastic and efficient.
Will go again~

msg:I made a surprising discovery during a trip without any strategy. This accommodation at the foot of the snow-capped mountains is highly recommended. The hotel has a unique design style that preserves the natural landscape while maintaining a modern visual a**osphere. The hotel staff are attentive and enthusiastic, and the hotpot is also delicious. , there will be a warm and happy bonfire activity in the evening...there will be expectations to come again

msg:Stone House is a hotel that feels like my hometown in the snowy mountains. Although it was only three days, I still felt deeply sad before leaving. Looking back on these three days, hand dyeing, horseback riding around the lake, and picking pine cones, it seems that they have been integrated into the life here unconsciously. The mountains here are lovely, the water is lovely, and the people are lovely. Every morning when it gets slightly brighter, I look out into the hall from the window on the second floor and see the busy figures of the little brothers and sisters, and I feel an inexplicable sense of warmth. Stone House has proven through actions that attentive service can fill the hearts of guests. All in all, it was a very warm travel experience ~ I hope to see you again soon

Thank you to all the staff for their enthusiastic arrangements. We have a good time. We had cured pork ribs hot pot, had a bonfire party, fireworks, horseback riding, visited Naxi families, and the enthusiasm and warmth brought to us by the awesome handsome guys and beauties. Due to the weather, we did not go up the mountain, leaving a small Sorry, looking forward to our meeting again in ****oucuo💗

msg:In the season when Pyracantha is in full bloom, I went on a date in the snowy mountains and came to the stone house I had longed for. The temperature during these three days and two nights was the most touching: it was the beauty of the snowy mountains visible through the window; it was the preparation for my return from the snowy mountains. A good cup of hot ginger tea; it is good night milk every night; it is the warm and measured service from every butler, brother and sister: special thanks to Luo Zhixiang for allowing my son to enjoy the trea**ent of a little brother; thanks to Wang Sicong for picking up and dropping off Warm service on the way; thank you to Louis Koo, Daniel Wu, every housekeeper, brother and sister I met (forgive me for not remembering all the names) and the boss behind the scenes who sent us to the snow mountain attractions. By the way, there is also the uncle who helps pick firethorn early in the morning... We meet in mountains and rivers. Thank you for meeting us. I wish everything in Toushicuo will be better! (The photos of the nine-square grid uploaded were chosen over and over again. In short, they are so beautiful that it is difficult to choose.)

Although there was relatively little snow on the snow-capped mountains these two days, it was really amazing to be able to enjoy the beautiful scenery while lying on the bed. The staff were super enthusiastic and polite, helping us with our luggage and taking us to various activities! I picked pine cones with the guide uncle and the lovely Xiugou, and made plant dyeing.

msg:I came to Yunnan on a whim and stayed in Dali for two days. After I came to Lijiang, I wanted to have the luxury of staying one night in the snowy mountains. I struggled with Pu Xiu and Tou Tou Cuo for a long time, and finally chose Tou Tou Cuo. After a day of experience, Let me immediately exclaim that it is so worth it! It’s worth it alone, let alone with friends and partners.
The hotel will contact you one day in advance to create a service group for you. The butlers are all in the group. If you have any problem, they can arrive and solve it for you in just one minute!
First of all, there are really many activities in the hotel. I came to the ancient city to pick me up in the afternoon. After arriving, a young man was very enthusiastic to pick up my luggage.
1. After I arrived and put away my things, the housekeeper took me to pick pine cones, which I had never experienced before! It was very novel. Liu Haoran took me to pick pine cones and was very patient.
2. After picking pine cones, I played with the big dog for a while, and then the housekeeper took me to do rubbings. It was really beautiful.
3. After finishing the dyeing, the housekeeper Luo Zhixiang took a lot of photos for me! The photos taken by Luo Zhixiang were super beautiful, and then the butler sent afternoon tea to the room, and we had afternoon tea on the balcony while looking at the scenery!
4. We started organizing horse riding around five o’clock! The horses are also very well-behaved and super fun.
After the horseback riding, I took beautiful photos in the room. After resting, I went to the restaurant for dinner. The yak hotpot was really, really delicious! At first I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to get used to it, but in the end I really had a big bite.
5. After dinner, we took a short rest and had a bonfire party around nine o'clock. We danced, sang, and chatted together. It was really fun. I felt that everyone was really friends. It was really beautiful to look up at the stars during the bonfire.
The hotel room is large and very comfortable. All the housekeepers and staff really seem to love their jobs and everyone is in high spirits.
There is also a small fireplace in my room. In the evening, the housekeeper came to light a fire and bring me hot cocoa. I was so happy that I was so happy to be alone. I wrote this little red book out of my own experience! Anyone who comes to Lijiang and doesn’t live in a stone house will be sad.

Although this is my first time in Lijiang, when I come to ****uocuo, I really feel like I am reunited after a long separation. Whether it is the selection of the room, the special hot pot in the restaurant, or the various activities arranged, I particularly like it. I want to come back next year, the year after that, and every year after that. I will never forget the shock of seeing the snow-capped mountains when I open the window. Rizhao Jinshan is really amazing! 😍😍😍Friends who hope to see my comment must come here! Thank you to every family member in ****oucuo for your meticulous care and leaving a perfect memory of my trip to Yunnan. See you next time!

You can see the snow-capped mountains when you open the curtains in the room, and you can see the starry sky when you step out of the terrace at night. If you want to be more relaxed, you can participate in hotel activities and take a walk in the back mountain to take photos for two days. We secretly prepared for it when we knew it was our birthday. The cake is placed in the room, it’s really great! ! ! There is a bonfire party every night, and it is very comfortable for everyone to chat and drink. The pictures below were taken on the mountain behind the hotel and in the hotel. It is beyond the scope of the photo taken casually. I must stay here again next time I come to Lijiang.

msg:Without further ado, let’s start with the pictures.
I haven't checked out yet, so I wanted to write this review before leaving.
Two i people said that the stay was really comfortable. I originally booked it for just one night, but extended my stay for another day. If the vacation had not come to an end, I would have liked to stay longer. There are two 1-year-old German shepherds in the store, named ****ou and Xiaocuo, and a Beagle named Diandian. They are all very good-tempered and friendly. As soon as dog lovers go out, they want to “stick” with them.
I participated in the pinecone picking and rubbing activities organized by the hotel (I printed the flowers and plants on the canvas bag, it was so beautiful and felt very meaningful!) Horseback riding by Jade Girl Lake, rich afternoon tea, and dinner beyond expectations... all arranged by the hotel It was a great day and I had so much fun!
The starry sky pool in the yard/Naxi folk songs and dances by the bonfire/Fireworks after the party/The reeds swaying in the wind/The dogs by the tree at the door...
I will have a very good impression of Lijiang because of this hotel. I like the hospitality of Lijiang people!
All the staff in the hotel are responsive to requests and always give warm smiles and greetings whenever they meet.
The only regret is that the weather has been bad recently and I didn’t see the sunshine on the Jinshan Mountains. But in the hotel room, you can see the snow-capped mountains while lying on the bed. Opening the curtains makes you feel like you are in the mountains and forests...the air is super good!
It's raining outside at the moment. Looking at the patter of raindrops on the balcony and listening to the sound of rain mixed in the wind... it's always a rainy day. See you next time in Lijiang and see you next time in ****oucuo.
(I have never written a review before. This was strongly requested by my girlfriend. I can only say that I am very satisfied!)

msg:This is my third time coming to Yuhu Village, and there have been some changes. But the most surprising thing was staying in this stone hotel at the foot of the snow-capped mountains.

There is a very large lawn facing the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. Afternoon tea and evening bonfire party are very a**ospheric.

Facilities: The boss is very tasteful and has a sense of design. It’s easy to take pictures from all angles

Service: The staff all wear traditional Naxi costumes and communicate enthusiastically and promptly. It happened to be my birthday, so I went to buy me a cake.

The hotel also has many activities you can participate in, including picking pine cones with a local man, riding horses around Longnv Lake, and hiking in the snow-capped mountains. It's a pity that the time is too short to experience them all. Leave it to me to bring my parents next time

I got to know the Lijiang branch members Daniel Wu, Luo Zhixiang, Ou Hao, and Deng Ziqi🤨Hahaha. I heard that the names were assigned by the boss, but each name is really similar to the employees. They are handsome and beautiful! 😎
The hotel is very beautiful. I want to take pictures of every part. There are many activities every day. You can participate in tree climbing. Daniel Wu is very good at picking pine cones on the top of the tree for you to eat. At the bonfire party in the evening, you can also hear them singing ******* songs. Yuge👏You can also see many stars💫
It’s a pity that I didn’t see the sunshine at Jinshan Mountain because of the clouds. I will regret it (find a reason) and come back next time~🫡

msg:Stone House is definitely the warmest and most comfortable hotel and B&B I have ever stayed in🥰I stayed there for three nights and I didn’t want to leave☹️😭 I will contact you in advance before arriving. The whole check-in process is very warm and the staff are very cute. Friendly and sincere people, the hotel is really lucky to have them. I think most of the guests are touched by your friendliness and sincerity. We were frustrated because we couldn’t get ropeway tickets on the first night. Orange🍊 and Xiaoxiong came to chat with us right away and gave us itinerary suggestions🥰 The cutest thing is that everyone has the name code of a celebrity, so creative🥺I can talk to us every day Liu Haoran chatted and rode in Daniel Wu’s car, drank coffee made by Daniel Wu and listened to martial arts singing by Jincheng 😆 The B&B has arranged many activities, including horse riding activities, bonfire parties, and roasted milk tea around the fire. The roasted milk tea is really delicious! The hotel will arrange breakfast and send guests a hot pot dinner every day, which is really considerate! We usually have afternoon tea and coffee, which is really satisfying. It feels like we have entered the recording site of the life program that we long for🥺🥺When we finally left, everyone would send us out of the door to wait for our car to drive away😭

The decoration of the hotel is mainly wood tones. I like it very much. The snow mountain room I booked this time can see the snow mountains directly from the room. It is so beautiful~ The hotel also has its own small lawn, where you can take pictures of many stars at night!

The overall experience is super warm. I will recommend it to other friends and I will come again next time!

Service: The boys and girls in the store are very enthusiastic. It is the most humane hotel I have stayed in during this trip to Yunnan. Everyone is very enthusiastic and the activities organized are also very good.
Choose one of three options: Snow Mountain Cured Pork Ribs Hot Pot/Local Chicken Hot Pot/Yak Meat Hot Pot: The hot pot for dinner is very delicious!

msg:Looking at the Malongnu Lake, you can see the snow-capped mountains leisurely, and you feel so comfortable that you already want to retire early and stay!
The hotel is right at the foot of the snow-capped mountains. I highly recommend a room with a view of the snow-capped mountains. You can actually see the golden mountains in the sunshine while lying down. Drinking afternoon tea, eating snacks, listening to your favorite songs and chatting is really complete.
The housekeepers in the hotel are also very nice. They were very considerate in helping me find medicine when I got sick. I would like to express my special thanks to Comrade Cheng Zi, who was so kind. When my partner caught a cold and vomited while hiking in the snowy mountains, he was very considerate in helping me find medicine and even asked if he needed to prepare noodles to nourish his stomach (already) It was not meal time at that time) The other butlers, brothers and sisters were also very considerate. The bonfire party in the evening was very lively and they really worked hard to invigorate the atmosphere. Luo Zhixiang sang songs in ****oucuo and it was very joyful! The other housekeepers are also very polite and make you feel at home~
The sanitary facilities are also very good. Most importantly, the food is delicious! Drinks and drinks are free (the boss is really not afraid of losing money?) Compared with the same-priced hotel I stayed in before, ****oucuovoss has mineral water (6 bottles) and Jade Dragon Snow Mountain spring water (two extra large bottles), as well as various drinks in the restaurant and bar. Unlimited drinks are the conscience of the employment industry
The landscape service and sanitation environment are very good. If you, like us, want to escape from the fast-paced life for a while, there is nothing wrong with choosing Stone House.

I want to say that although I have experienced expensive hotels before, this is the one I stayed in. The most expensive hotel I’ve ever stayed in is also the hotel with the best service. I’m really lucky. It’s an unforgettable experience. I won’t regret not seeing Rizhao Jinshan Mountain (due to weather) because you will find that there are more interesting things. The experience is waiting for you to experience it, especially the young brothers and sisters who serve you and accompany you to experience it. They are all really nice.

From the moment I checked in, I was full of surprises. The hotel’s roasted milk and roasted sweet potatoes are both great, and there are fruit drinks available everywhere indoors and on the lawn for you to pick up~
The friends are all super enthusiastic and cute, including Sanduo, Chengzi, Lijiang Liu Haoran and Wu Yanzu, etc. There are also three cute little ones: "****ou, Xiaocuo and Diandian!" (Super and super cute!) Thank you very much for your companionship. In the end, I was even a little reluctant to leave~
There are also various activities in ****ouzuo. We experienced pine cone picking, dyeing, afternoon tea, horse riding around the lake and a bonfire party. Pine cone picking is especially recommended. The route that my uncle took along the way was really beautiful. He also introduced various flowers, plants, and humanities and history in great detail. It happened to be rainy a few days ago and I picked mushrooms. When I came back, I baked them on the oven and ate them. The meals in the hotel were also super delicious!
I hope I can get together with Toushicuo and my friends next time and the next time~

The hotel is located in Yuhu Village. The village is very quiet. There are many fewer people than Dayan Ancient City. Several cafes are very good, and the hotel is next to Longnu Lake, so you can check in at any time. The hotel facilities are very new. I chose a snow-capped mountain view room. Because it hadn’t snowed yet during the season I went, I could only vaguely see it. The hotel provides free hot pot and good night desserts every day, and you can drink all you want, including wine, coffee and milk tea. The sister's service is also very attentive. She is always available to help carry luggage and deliver things. It’s just that the hotel is a bit far from the city. If you like peace and quiet, this is the right choice!

It's quite far from the city, and the gravel road into the village is very difficult to walk, but I still give it five stars because the scenery here is worth it. The hotel facilities and hardware are comparable to the InterContinental Hotel Hefu. After all, they are newer and smarter. And the free hot pot dinner is quite delicious. The staff were very nice and there were many activities in the hotel. I only participated in the bonfire party, which was a bit regretful. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Snow Mountain! I have already proposed to the staff that if the boss buys another shuttle bus to take people in and out of the village, it would be perfect!

The two rooms the hotel booked for us this time were upgraded to snow-capped mountain view rooms. The rooms are not too big, but the interior decoration is very good. The toiletries are from Le Labo and I like the smell. The toilet is also smart, but for some reason there is a machine noise at night. There are two bottles of snow mountain mineral water in my room, but not in the other room. The details need to be improved. I have to say that the small balcony in the room is really great, suitable for making tea and reading a book... There is also a beautiful small stove in the room.
Although the hotel is located in a remote location, it has a variety of activities every day, including picking pine cones in the mountains, horseback riding, and bonfire parties... Breakfast is a choice of three rice noodles, noodles, and bait, and dinner is a complimentary local chicken or yak meat hot pot in each room. , paired with some self-service fruit soft drinks and wine.
Overall it's good. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Lijiang.

Everything is perfect, from the hotel's location by the beautiful Jade Girl Lake, to the hotel's interior design, which is full of light luxury, a designer style favored by young people today, to all the real layout details, to the delicious roasted milk. There are also horse riding activities arranged in the hotel, as well as a touching bonfire party in the evening, which really allows people from the city to calm down and enjoy the beauty at the foot of the snow-capped mountains. Not to mention the considerate and impeccable service! You must come to ****oucuo in your lifetime, so if you have the budget, just don’t rush! ! I think we will bring our children here again in the future~

msg:Feeling like home is not enough to describe the courtesy and service we received after checking into the hotel: 1. After it was confirmed that we would check in, a WeChat service group was established. There were dedicated people responsible for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment in the hotel and quick responses. At the same time, we were informed that we could participate during our stay. The activities have already created a holiday atmosphere even before people arrive. 2. The check-in procedure was quick. The diligent Naxi boy walked quickly to deliver the luggage to the room. The welcoming girl took us to the room with a smile and demonstrated the use of various facilities. 3. We have stayed in too many five-star and above hotels in recent years, and the ice bar in Shitoucuo is the most generous! The afternoon tea is beautiful and delicious, the milk tea brewed in the lobby is tempting, and the hot pot provided for dinner is delicious. I recommend the ******* roast pork. The dishes are definitely the standard of a five-star hotel chef. 4. The room faces the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, and the children cheered for the comfort of lying on the bed and watching the snow-capped mountains. Fortunately, I saw a little bit of sunshine shining on Jinshan Mountain. The stars in the sky poured into my eyes like dust in the sun. The air was filled with the sweet fragrance of grass and trees. I heard the chirping of birds in my ears. There was only joy and peace in my heart. 5. After writing so much, the deepest impression that Stone House left on me is sincerity. The required services will be responded to immediately. The smiles of the staff are just right. They are a little more borderline than home and a little more warm than other hotels. The bonfire party is as relaxed and enthusiastic as welcoming friends who have not seen each other for many years. They are respected but Don't be disturbed. I'm not good at writing about this kind of stay. The only way I can think of to describe it is the highest level of sincerity.

msg:I stayed at Stone House for two nights. I highly recommend it. Let me tell you my true feelings.
A very impressive hotel, I chose ****oucuoyi because of its location. In Yuhu Village, it is far away from the noisy crowds and completely close to nature. The hotel has arranged many activities that can deeply experience the cultural customs. I feel that this cannot be replaced by other hotels. Snow mountain afternoon tea, pine cone picking, Naxi home visit, plant dyeing and bonfire party. After checking in, there is basically no need to arrange the same day. It’s an itinerary. The hotel’s activities are far more interesting than going to various classic and crowded places.
Secondly, let’s talk about the service. After check-in, you can drink wine and fruits for free. Our package also includes dinner, so the room price does not seem cheap, but after careful calculation, it is really very cost-effective👍🏻The hotel staff are very helpful Well, it’s not the polite but distant feeling of a five-star hotel. Every staff member is warm and friendly~
The supporting supplies and small appliances in the room have also been carefully considered. The public areas are beautiful. The pictures are all original pictures taken at random for your reference.
Finally, I would like to commend Wang Sicong, the hotel’s butler, for his sincerity and humor. We became friends in just two days. He brought us many gifts when we left😄 and even sent us to the airport, which made this experience very special~

good service
Good environment

Each item is unique, such as horseback riding around the lake, bonfire party, picking pine cones, and caravan roasting tea. After staying for 3 days and 2 nights, I didn’t finish playing. The children like it so much! The whole process of butler service, the younger brothers and sisters are very gentle, good at singing and dancing, and the service is very considerate. During the stay, tea, coffee, drinks and fruits are all free, and there are delicious boiled milk tea and roasted sweet potatoes in the lobby. Every day, I go to the lobby to drink milk tea and sweet potatoes . The taste of the restaurant is also very good, the breakfast is very rich! It’s just that it’s been raining for 2 days and I haven’t seen the snow-capped mountains, so I’ll save some thoughts and come back next time!
Recommended recommended! The following photos are all real shots! Everyone must go, the stone house under the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain

Book this homestay, you can definitely experience the original ecology in one stop Lijiang tour, free horseback riding activities, you can also participate in the project of paid horseback riding into the mountains and milk lake customized by the homestay, but this time it is really bad weather and it has been raining, neither seeing Jade Dragon Snow Mountain nor participating in milk lake The event 😂The milk lake tour is led by Ma Ge, the landlord of the homestay. It seems that Ma Ge is the heir of the caravan, and the experience of riding a horse into the mountains is absolutely extraordinary! It's a pity this time, but leave some regrets, never forget, come again next time! The homestay service is very good, it can be said that it is responsive to every request, and it is very warm. There is free coffee and milk tea at the front desk. There is also afternoon tea in the afternoon. You can also experience caravan roasted tea and chat with the local brothers in the store. There is a bonfire party, which is especially suitable for She Niu. The restaurant can make reservations for dinner. Although the dishes are not many and expensive, they taste good! The lighting, air conditioner, TV, and curtains in the room can all be controlled intelligently. In short, ****ou is worth recommending. I will come again next time.

The hotel has free programs to participate in every day. I recommend visiting Yuhu Village, rubbings and horseback riding around the lake. I personally think it is very interesting. It is much more fun than going to the snowy mountains to crowd people.
It is highly recommended to have a bonfire party in the hotel at night. Drinks are free, you can watch fireworks, and the focus is on the beautiful brothers and sisters singing and dancing together. It is very lively.

msg:Does this hotel have good reviews? I read all the reviews when I made the reservation, and there was not a single negative review, and the reviews were very thoughtful. Later, there were negative reviews, and I was so worried that I checked out four rooms for one night. Reserved for two nights. How low are those standards for cleanliness and tidiness? As soon as we entered the room, my family and I were in emoji. The signs of use in the room were too obvious, old and dirty. I felt like I had come all the way to suffer, and I wanted to escape. On the first night, I kept searching for other hotels to stay in, but unfortunately all the decent hotels were fully booked during the Spring Festival. The entire hotel facilities, you can take pictures and experience them on the spot, they are dirty and rough. The price of more than 3,000 during the New Year and more than 2,000 in normal times should probably be based on the location of the snow-capped mountains and the seemingly abundant activities. However, hardware maintenance should be somewhat dependent on the price. If you have some requirements for cleanliness and tidiness, choose carefully. Lijiang Xingzhuwuhelan has a high price, but the hardware, services, and ingredients are very exquisite and high-quality, and the price is worth it. Stone House is a bit like a copycat version, but not worth the price.

The hotel's various services are relatively good, and a service group will be established. The group is full of big stars, and everyone is good at singing and dancing.

The milk lake horseback riding tour of the hotel is also good, but you have to rest well the day before, otherwise you will be really tired after riding a horse for 4 hours, with various butt pains and back pains. 😅

Next is a little suggestion: There are indeed a lot of flies in the room. I don’t know if there is any way to solve it. This will affect the mood of the stay. The other is the resource sharing of the surrounding scenic spots. If you want to go to the city after checking in, it is a bit far away and it takes 40 minutes to drive. Therefore, most of the people who live here will take this as the center for simple travel. In fact, the recommended sharing and introduction of the surrounding environment is particularly important. . It would be even better if they could be combined.

msg:Ctrip's 500-word character limit is not enough for me to express my dissatisfaction. The reviews here are almost overwhelmingly positive. I was also looking forward to it. Unfortunately, what I experienced was not a hotel worthy of its price at all!

Due to character limit, I cannot comment in detail, but what dissatisfied me most is the attitude of the front desk. There were many of them, but they didn't show the advantage of their numbers at all... They said they would help us pick up our luggage from the previous B&B. When we arrived at the hotel, they first asked where our luggage was. We told them that they had picked it up, and even lied to us that it was downstairs. , it finally took at least 3 hours to get our room...

Not only did we pick up our luggage, we also made an appoin**ent for a car at 8:30 on the day we checked out. Before having breakfast, we told us that we would move our luggage to the front desk. As expected, half an hour passed after we finished breakfast, and they still didn't arrive. When I urged him, he said he was picking it up.

What makes me even more speechless is the ride-hailing service. Before checking in, I had been communicating with the hotel about hiring a car to take us to the airport. Every time I communicate, they seem to have never heard of it, so forget it. The day before check-in, they called and sent WeChat to confirm everything, and I gave them all the flight information. After checking in, he sent me another WeChat message asking me how to arrange it?

Well, when it was time to leave, I asked them if the car had arrived, and they also asked me if the driver had contacted me. You were the first to book a ride, and if the driver contacts me, do I still need to ask you? This is not a kindergarten. Do you want customers to help you think about the arrangements before taking action?

More than that, anyway, the front desk is slow! Although polite, it is obvious that they don't take the customer's request to heart at all. The price here is 2-3 times the price of nearby international five-star hotels. I can't understand this kind of service attitude.

During the days I stayed here, I saw the sun shining on the golden mountains in the morning, the sunshine on the lawn in the afternoon, the stars in the sky at night, and the bonfire party with strangers. , and a smoke cured me! The hotel also has many activities to experience. Breakfast and dinner were very good, and I didn't get tired of it after several days. The housekeepers here are all like friends. Everyone, including Daniel Wu Orange, Luo Zhixiang, etc., is very nice.

msg:The hotel staff were very attentive. The hotel couldn't contact me because I didn't have a mainland phone number, but I asked for pick-up service on the day of check-in and they immediately arranged it for me. Unfortunately, I missed the caravan roasted tea and afternoon tea because of the time schedule, but the dinner and breakfast were very rich and the bonfire party was also available. It's fun and you can see the starry sky at night, which I have never seen before. When I left the hotel, I misunderstood that there was a drop-off service. I could only choose one of the drop-off/pick-up services, but the staff was very enthusiastic to help me arrange it. The car prepared fruit boxes and milk tea and helped me pay the fare in advance. It was very considerate. I will definitely come again if I have the chance. Although the price is not cheap, the hotel is worth it.

After we arrived, he helped us deliver our luggage to the room, and took good care of our two children. So this is the best choice for parent-child travel.
Breakfast and lunch are delicious, and the ingredients are fresh. Fresh fruits and snacks in the restaurant can be picked up by yourself. Coffee, whisky and wine in the lobby are free. Everything in the minibar in the room is free.

msg:In Yunnan this summer, booking hotels and B&Bs really depends on fate.
At 2:00 in the morning, I brushed the stone house at Banyan Tree. Although it was marked as a trial operation and had not yet been released on Ctrip, I made the reservation based on intuition and decided to stay in Yuhu Village for one night.
Yuhu Village and Stone House were really pleasant surprises from this trip to Lijiang. I really like the location and design of this homestay! I was also moved by the full communication and communication between all the B&B staff and us, which made up for the lack of details during the trial operation. It's a pleasure to witness the start of an excellent homestay! The future can be expected!
It has been widely advertised to the fox friends. I also look forward to the second visit to Yuhu Village and Stone House.

真有點不捨，感覺要離開朋友了。
一進門，就被火爐煮奶茶，温暖到了。
奶茶水果咖啡酒水，全部無限暢吃。
酒店金屬木質感設計，洗漱用品非常全，全屋小度聲控。
晚餐時，老闆和管家來一起喝酒聊天，談到初心，希望能給客人提供情緒價值，讓來到這裏的人，都能打開心扉，把開心的和不開心的都釋放出來。
馬哥，桃子，橙子……一起圍爐煮酒，來自天南海北的遊客們，透過音樂聊到了一起，這感覺太棒了！
酒店提供的活動很好，真希望能多住幾天，全部參加一遍。
下次有機會，帶上孩子再一起來[耶]。

msg:誰懂真的超級超級值得來
專車接或送二選一:我們到大理已經很晚了 訂完酒店馬上就着急打電話給前台美女，客服那邊很快安排車輛來接我們 前後不超過五分鐘。
電話裡邊約完車輛就馬上拉了一個服務小羣專房服務 效率高到沒話説 
到酒店很晚 當天大風小雨 篝火晚會改成室內
進門就可以看到管家們和客人們圍着爐子其樂融融的坐成一圈，相關飲品有熱水，熱紅酒等好多
剛一進去有管家特別熱情的邀請加入晚會（本i人驚慌） 
雪山臘排骨火鍋/土雞火鍋/氂牛肉火鍋三選一:我們晚到有在車上直接預約了氂牛肉火鍋，當時餐廳應該衹剩下我們了 但食材特別新鮮 味道也超級好
 後來一起唱了會歌

設施：房間裏有壁爐 當時應該很晚了也幫我們點上了 真的很暖和 隔音也超好 有户外泡澡池 有一次性泡澡袋和泡澡球可以用來泡澡，頂着大風也幫我鋪了一次性泡澡袋🥺感動。mini bar的飲品因為就晚上也沒怎麼喝但很整齊品種全，房間大部分由小度掌控😉“小度小度！”

服務：不用多説 都超級好 很有家的感覺 小姐姐們都超級漂亮🤩 小哥哥們都很帥氣有擔當 回到房間以後問我們要不要熱可可/牛奶之類 提醒了第二天日照金山的時間☺️ 幾乎衹要看到客人就會站在旁邊幫忙開門（感應的）也會提前一天出行詢問是否需要車輛供應。

第二天早上起來有帶領我們去吃早餐 餌絲/米線/麪條，新鮮水果、麪包、牛奶……較豐盛。

龍女湖騎馬或遊覽玉柱擎天景區或納西家訪三選一:選擇了騎馬 當天風蠻大的，就沒辦法全部環繞 怕出問題🥲但風景很好 拍了很多照片
還去做了手工😏可以留下紀念也可以帶走🥰

很多照片視頻都在其他手機/相機裏 如果來得及還會再補圖🥳

在此，特別感謝橙子小姐姐，管家古天樂（藝名），還有前台小姐姐，接我們的三朵小姐姐。

msg:酒店位置就在玉龍雪山山腳下，房間一開就能看到雪山側面，酒店旁邊就是龍女湖，離玉湖村就幾分鐘的電瓶車車程，走走逛逛再加上酒店的行程基本上可以在酒店待一整天。
設施跟環境是真的很舒適！酒店大堂的設計給人一種像家的温馨感，把房間內的暖爐點起，坐在躺椅上看着篝火滿滿療愈。

酒店活動豐富，但有些點還是要吐槽一下，原本是期待煙花跟篝火晚會的，也提前打電話詢問説是會有，但實際入住卻因為風大都取消了，細問才知道基本上那段時間都是這樣的大風天氣，也已經好一陣子沒放煙花，電話詢問的時候大可以明白的説最近天氣都不允許，這樣也不會像是被澆冷水一樣失望。另外，騎馬體驗的時候還是被強買強賣了，雖然跟酒店沒什關係，但最好還是提醒住客。
整體來説體驗感是不錯的，衹是對標上這個價格，服務的細節希望還能再提升！

msg:很難評的一家酒店，優缺點都很明顯

優點：
- 接送服務優秀：入住時免費從火車站接人，退房時也熱情把我們送去下一個入住酒店，響應很快
- 有些好的服務設計：在閲讀時會有工作人員熱心送上烤火炭盆，問是否需要酒水和零食，上門點房間裏的壁爐，騎馬/篝火/採摘活動等
- 房間智能操控（小度）總體挺好用

缺點：
- 4888兩晚的酒店是五星級價格，但是硬件和景觀並不達標。房間設施開始陳舊和破損，雪山景觀被前面亂糟糟的電線毀了一半，雪山本身也是比較側斜的景觀
- 人多之後服務明顯跟不上，比如晚餐和早餐組織開始亂（其實完全可以跟各房間提前安排好時間錯開），碗盤來不及洗導致客人無法自助取餐，地面油膩和疏於清潔。同時也能觀察到一些工作人員在餐廳工作了非常久的時間（從早餐到晚餐），看得出明顯疲憊
- 我們非常喜歡的採摘活動其實沒想到運動強度是比較大的，爬了相當久的山坡也從一些較陡滑的坡度下山，對部分沒有準備的賓客來説，提前説明活動時長和路線設計會更好

總體來説，是個獨特又温馨的體驗，但是和價格是不符的，有很多可以進一步標準化提升的空間。淡季優惠的話可以一住。

第一次這麼認真的給一家酒店寫評價，也是第一次讓我有因為一家酒店打算再來一個地方的想法。
這次住的“十一月”星空全景大床房，雖然因為天氣原因沒能看到星星和雪山全貌，但憑欄聽雨也別有一番味道。
雖然衹有短短兩天，但留下了太多太多難忘的回憶。
從麗江站的接站，到晚上大堂吧的小酌和圍爐遊戲，到第二天早晨五點四十送我們去“集合點”，到最後再不辭辛勞送我們去麗江站，有始有終的“羅志祥”；
在飯點開山路接我們回酒店，幫我們安排騎馬環湖，半夜十二點多到房間幫我們點壁爐的“王力宏”；
雨夜陪我們飲茶，一泡又一泡不厭其煩幫我們試茶，向我們介紹當地茶文化，自己喝到“醉茶”的“童錦程”；
在我們退房後依然主動送我們去白沙古鎮，叮囑我們謹慎購物，拿不準的時候可以在羣裏問問他們的店長；
還有很多很多，每次都主動來問我們需不需要再來一份果盤再來一杯熱奶茶的前台小姐姐。。等等等等
這裏的工作人員熱愛這份事業，並且在認真的做好它，也許石頭厝現在還是籍籍無名的獨苗苗酒店，但我相信有這樣一羣可愛的人，它一定會形成屬於自己的文化自己的品牌，即使沒有花功夫花心思在營銷上，但桃李不言下自成蹊，住過的人享受過這份獨有的温暖且靜謐的氛圍的人，口口相傳，終有一天想要來麗江的人都會知道它的名字。

為什麼隨便一煮都那麼好吃呢

酒店的房間很舒服 各個細節也很到位
比如温暖的燭光 先做的奶茶 烤紅薯
無限量的咖啡 和各種泡酒
我最喜歡的是黑松露泡wisky 等等等等

早上睡到自然醒
吃過早飯 去酒店附近的湖邊轉了轉
	
湖不大 但説很低 很美
今天太陽出來了，照在身上也很暖和
路上看到遠遠的雪山
若隱若現
應該就是玉龍雪山了
	
酒店的活動也很有意思 采松果 挖野菜
晚上有篝火晚會
我們很幸運還看了煙花

特別鳴謝酒店店長 陳冠希
因為政府臨時叫停了騎馬雪山活動
他各種幫我們想辦法 忙前忙後
雖然有這個小插曲
但plan B 也是蠻開心的！

酒店套餐包含了每天的早餐和晚餐（火鍋），都非常豐盛。單點的炒菜口味也不錯的。酒店附近是沒有其他商店和餐廳的。

酒店的服務是非常棒的！比如 我們晚餐吃早了 睡前有些餓 詢問了管家之後給我們送來了點心 每天晚上也會詢問需不需要睡前牛奶 我們爬山回來有些脱水 羣裏問了一句就有兩位小哥哥趕緊跑來給我們送電解質飲料 吃飯的時候有員工給我們講納西族的小故事 無限暢飲的各種飲料真的是很舒服了 奶茶也特別好喝（喝多了會拉肚子…）

酒店的活動 龍女湖騎馬 非常休閑方便 另外定製了兩小時的玉湖村+吉祥湖騎馬 簡直就是這次旅行中的最大亮點

我們的管家 羅志祥小哥哥 全程對我們關心有加 分享了許多遊覽資訊 也給我們送喝的送吃的 非常貼心

晚上的篝火晚會讓城裡的小朋友大開眼界 
晚上可以看到很多星星
酒店所有的員工也都對小朋友特別有耐心哦！

我們還一直惦記着酒店裡的石頭和小厝 還有我們騎的小馬 小湖

非常值得推薦的酒店！

每天晚上還會詢問是否需要熱牛奶或者熱可可，還參加了酒店組織的挖野菜和摘松子活動，
對了，自製的奶茶根本喝不夠。

馬幫烤茶體驗:
特色下午茶➕專業小哥哥沏茶，據説老闆自己擁有的一家茶園，3種口味的茶都體驗過了，可惜我不專業

設施：房間內的一切都是小度控制，高科技滿滿
衞生：這麼説吧，自己帶的一次性浴巾和床單都沒用上
環境：雪山腳上，打開窗口躺着都能看到雪山的風光

如果還有機會來，可能還會選擇這家酒店，我要選擇冬天來，一片白雪皚皚

酒店的附近有雪山下的騎馬場，酒店出去走一兩分鐘就到了，景色美而且人不多！再過一點就是龍女湖，早上我走了五分鐘到湖邊看了不用人擠人的日照金山，雖然今天大風湖面一直不平，但算是簡單地打卡成功了！
總的來説，下次來麗江的話還到這家，100分！

希望有機會再見呀👋🏻

設施：電視的智能遙控和小度貌似不一樣，用着有點怪…這大概是整個酒店唯一的小缺點了～（也可能衹是我不太會用哈哈哈哈）加濕器是我在麗江香格里拉七天下來，覺得最好的加濕器了，沒有之一～
衞生：超級好，能在山腳下做的如此乾淨我是着實沒想到，這個季節這個位置換一家店大概會被蒼蠅搬走…
環境：就在玉龍雪山腳下，很舒服很愜意，訂的雖然是側景，但是在陽台癱着就能看到雪山…騎馬去大峽谷，還看到了一衹野生的鹿哈哈哈哈哈
服務：小哥哥小姐姐們真的培訓的很厲害，他們説烤茶，我老婆聽錯了以為是烤腸…小姐姐們就記住了她想吃烤腸。這種小細節就很厲害…住這一天時間，我聽到最多的兩句話是小姐姐問我還要冰美式嗎，和各種提醒我穿個外套別穿背心亂跑hhhhh
除此之外的話～篝火晚會很有趣，馬也很好很聽話，黑松露酒很香～馬哥在山上做的炸豬肉很好吃，奈何我吃的少hhhh。這家店貌似對寵物很友好，有遇到另外對情侶帶狗來的～～～

環境：雖然在雪山腳下的小鎮裏（晚上相對是有點荒涼）但是看雪山是一等一的好，而且民宿旁邊就是龍女湖 非常近很舒服。晚上的時候還可以看到很多星星。

服務：管家式服務，真心考慮到方方面面，無論是禮貌招呼，還是貼心的問詢，都讓我覺得賓至如歸！當我們有顧慮的時候也會一一幫忙解決，非常耐心！小姐姐們都人美心善，小哥哥們都很帥！！ 

馬幫烤茶體驗:小哥哥們的烤茶技術都很不錯，還能和你聊聊天，品品茶都很棒。

很喜歡這家民宿，能體驗好多有趣的活動，上山摘野菜啊（4月初）還有騎馬進峽谷超級不一樣的體驗，遠離人羣悠閑的好去處。還會再來的。

房間裏面的設施都是智能聯網的，十分方便，還貼心的準備了加濕器，雲南真的好乾。還配備了Marshall的音響，音樂配上景色，很絕。

套餐：我們買的套餐裏面有騎馬環龍女湖、馬幫烤茶、篝火晚會。小哥哥帶着我們體驗每個項目，分享自己有趣的故事，都很有意思哈哈哈哈哈。篝火晚會上酒店的小哥哥小姐姐和房客們聚在一起度過了一個有意思的晚上，豆豆好可愛！！很乖，就坐在邊上，真的是很棒的體驗。
另外，下午茶和早晚飯都很好吃也很精緻。下午茶的種類很多，也很有特色，蘋果乾和蜜餞很好吃。

服務：酒店的小哥哥小姐姐們的服務都很熱情、貼心且周到，但又不會過度很有分寸。還沒入住前就會詢問是否需要接送。入住後能感受到他們的活潑和熱情。對小哥哥小姐姐們的服務誇誇哈哈哈。

最後，看到這個點評不要猶豫，直接訂房吧，強推！哈哈哈哈哈哈

下訂酒店後，前台小姐姐第一時間聯繫了我們還拉了一個服務羣，整個旅途7天我們訂了6個酒店，石頭厝是唯一一個我有機會再來會想住的酒店。全部的服務人員都是年輕有活力的小哥哥小姐姐，從辦理入住開始就開始想方設法餵飽我們，免費的咖啡拉花還是美美的，一點都沒有打折，騎馬環湖，牽馬的小哥哥一直很努力的幫我們拍各種照片各種角度拍拍拍。我們自己溜達去玉湖村，前台小哥哥還怕我們累着，開車直接帶我們去到村裡，還貼心的給了兩瓶礦泉水。
下午茶，馬幫烤茶，晚餐，晚上的圍爐夜話，所有的安排都很精緻舒服，小哥哥小姐姐們也都是享受生活的人，才能這麼認真快樂的去準備一切。
這一切都很美好，有熱心的司機小哥哥帶我們玩汪汪;和善的廚師大叔飯桌陪聊，高興的時候還加兩把嫩菜葉給我們，喂得走不動道;愛講鬼故事的小哥哥分享許多趣事導致太興奮了第二天起不來;前台美女姐姐貼心的睡前熱飲和上雪山的巧克力補給。衹要合理，所有的要求都會被滿足！
有快樂的小哥哥小姐姐，美好的景色，獨立的小陽台，不止是服務，住宿條件和美景也讓人心情格外美好，強烈推薦！下次如果有機會，我還想抱着一杯熱可可，坐在房間後院的陽台，靜靜地觀賞日照金山的出現😌

品一杯馬幫烤茶，策馬奔騰在夕陽餘暉，靜靜的看一場繁星，在篝火晚會上與來自五湖四海的靈魂共振，跳一場舞熱烈奔放，唱一首歌血液沸騰。快樂又自由，讓人永生難忘。
————————————
服務：辦理入住當天有點不舒服，不確定是之前的行程沒休息好還是到這邊海拔的變化，幫忙辦理入住的小姐姐看到我臉色不好，貼心的詢問我是否有高反的症狀，聯繫其他人幫我去找氧氣瓶。雖然後來沒有用到，休息了一會自行緩解了，但心裏還是暖暖的。
淡季剛好有空房，前台小姐姐又幫我們免費升級了雪山全景的房型，真是超級驚喜。
酒店裝修的很有特色，隨手一拍都是大片。
房間裏幾乎都是智能家居，使用起來非常便捷。
入住送的歡迎水果超級新鮮，下午茶也很精緻，能看出來用心在招待客人。
住在石頭厝酒店就完全不會覺得無聊，因為酒店的活動排的滿滿的，我又一個都不想錯過☺️
馬幫烤茶在茶室進行，特別感謝一下管家小歐，一邊幫我們烤茶，另一邊還介紹了當地風俗習慣，我們一起聊了很久，服務很貼心，人也長得帥～（^o^）
晚餐我們選擇的是臘排骨火鍋，排骨很香，青菜很嫩，啤酒、果汁、酸奶隨便喝～
⭐️最最推薦的是一定要參加晚上的篝火晚會，抬頭可見漫天繁星，一邊喝酒一邊唱歌跳舞，還放了超級美的煙花，所有人都嗨到爆。
小酌一杯後躺在院子裏的露天浴池看星星，水温剛剛好，簡直不要太浪漫了。
他家的咖啡可以説絕了，香氣濃郁，懶得下樓還能送到房間哦。
退房當天我們晚班飛機，下午沒事做，前台小姐姐還幫忙辦了延時退房。
想説的太多，總之是一次非常好的體驗！挑不出來毛病，一萬個點贊！
有機會六月份再來，去山上采菌子打火鍋！

首先酒店的服務給人一種家的感覺，我剛下訂單酒店前台就聯繫我加了微信，把我拉到有8個人在服務我的羣裏[偷笑]，羣裏的小管家們都很熱情，給我們發了酒店注意事項和活動的時間表，真的好貼心。到了酒店，確實很有設計感，是個很有人情味的酒店，整體風格比較温馨，給人一種回家的感覺。房間內的物品都很齊全，乾淨整潔，大大的落地窗正對雪山，好喜歡這個房間。最後想説的是酒店的服務人員也很專業，能感受到他們的熱情和對我們的照顧，小哥哥小姐姐的笑容都好治癒，和我們聊天都很開心。
哈哈，再補充一個酒店額外收費的私人定製線路，騎馬加徒步到玉龍雪山大峽谷裏，累並快樂着，真的非常非常推薦，下次來一定再選石頭厝，再讓小馬哥帶我們走進大峽谷。

其次，酒店的服務非常出色，員工們非常熱情、友好，讓人感到非常舒適和歡迎。酒店的接送機服務非常便利，還提供了免費活動，包括篝火晚會、馬幫烤茶、騎馬環龍女湖等，非常有趣，讓我們的旅行更加充實和難忘。酒店贈送的火鍋非常好吃，其他小炒味道也非常棒；在此，也力推下由小歐和小硅掌爐的燒烤（需要提前一天預約），可以一起參與製作；酒店各式各樣的酒水全部暢飲，特別是酒店自製的奶茶和黑松露威士忌我非常喜歡。最重要的是，酒店提供的一站式服務旅遊讓我們不用太擔心旅行中的安排和細節，非常貼心。

總之，我非常推薦石頭厝酒店，如果想要去麗江旅遊，入住石頭厝將是一次非常美好的旅行體驗。

msg:雲南，一個美麗、精彩的地方。美麗，是因為有湖光山色，洱海、瀘沽湖，就像羣山之間鑲嵌的明珠，玉龍雪山、蒼山，巍峨壯麗，白雪皚皚；精彩，是因為有20多個少數名族，服裝百花齊放，飲食琳琅滿目。旅行前的娃，是自然的鬧鐘，催着我們出發。兒子翹首以盼坐飛機旅行，已經心心念唸了三年，得償所願的時刻，臉上寫着顯而易見的激動。乘機抵達了麗江，我們入住的，是玉龍雪山腳下的石頭厝，酒店大堂裏，陳列着披着動物皮毛的沙發、壁爐、咖啡機，小資氛圍濃郁。工作人員則穿着納西族、藏族的民族服飾。我們的房間正朝向雪山，次日早晨，拉開窗簾的一剎那，清晨的陽光灑在雪山頂上，山頂的積雪，被陽光照得十分耀眼，碧藍如洗的天空，和金色的山頂反差強烈，真是名副其實的日照金山。玉龍雪山的行程安排了2天，首日我們乘坐纜車，映入眼簾的是三層顏色，天空的藍、雪山的白和青山的綠，抵達了海拔3500米的氂牛坪，纜車上山時，雲層已經在腳下了。次日，則是旅行的重頭戲，騎馬進入雪山大峽谷。領隊的是一匹矯健的黑色賽馬，主人是一位壯碩的納西族漢子。我們一行14位遊人，走入了茂密的森林和起伏的山谷。馬隊踏過的是山間狹窄的小路，邊上鬱鬱葱葱地生長着幾十年甚至上百年的植被。雲南松林、麗江雲杉林、大果紅杉林，遍佈山野。大家需要經常低頭讓開枝枝蔓蔓，調皮的小騎手摘着垂手可得的松果，把玩着大自然饋贈的玩具。上坡時，騎手身體要前傾，下坡時身體要後仰。馬兒喘氣的時候，脖子後側會一鼓一鼓，熱了馬兒也會汗流浹背。路過溪流，馬兒會自己停下來開懷暢飲，看到灌木的嫩芽，會停下來大快朵頤。和同伴距離走遠了，會心急火燎地嘶鳴幾聲。遇到極其陡峭的斜坡，騎手衹能下馬，人馬分開步行，因為一側便是懸崖峭壁。雪山背陰處，積雪還沒有融化，在這冬去春來的時節，一邊是馬踏飛雪，一邊是春花綻放，我們在正午時分，抵達了峽谷最深處。馬伕們開始生火做飯，不多時邊端上了五花肉，土豆片，香腸和麪條，騎手們餓了半晌，個個狼吞虎嚥。娃們爭先恐後騎上賽馬，我們則不約而同地掏出手機，留下這珍貴瞬間。後3天的行程是麗江古鎮和大理的蒼山洱海。在古鎮，大紅燈籠、白牆黑瓦，比比皆是。巨大的水車吱嘎作響，女生們穿着五彩斗篷，攝影師們的鏡頭忙不迭地捕捉鏡頭。過橋米線鋪子的跟前，是一條水渠湍急流過，米線的香味飄散四周。而作為經典雲南美食的鮮花餅，是我們絕不能錯過的。鮮花餅外面裹着酥皮，餡料則是玫瑰花瓣搗碎製成。洱海距離麗江2個小時車程，第一站雙廊鎮，我們一家四口端坐在湖邊，畫師花了半個小時，刻畫出了我們四個的漫畫。隨後是洱海邊的小普陀，是野鴨和海鷗的棲息地，娃們揣着餅乾和魚乾，開始賣力投喂。大膽的海鷗，飛來空中掠走人們手裡的食物，膽小的則將信將疑地和人保持距離。在大理古鎮，我們收穫了舌尖上的中國裏提到的諾頓火腿，收穫了藏族的掛飾，我收穫了納西族的吉祥物瓦貓，瓦貓張開大嘴大笑的樣子，似乎在勸誡人們要知足常樂。在一線城市日益內卷的今天，能保持輕鬆的心態，實在太彌足珍貴了。快樂的日子，總是稍縱即逝，被高原紫外線曬得黑黑的娃，在回家路上已經在憧憬香格里拉、西雙版納、騰沖，期待下一次旅行了。
石頭厝的美好回憶將伴隨着我們一家。

衞生：特別乾淨

環境：超美

服務：超級貼心  像家人又格外有分寸

住在石頭厝，是此行雲南最温暖的遇見，也是在雲南的最後一晚。大女兒前天晚上在束河吃壞了肚子，上吐下瀉，衹想喝小米粥，抱着試試看的態度問石頭厝，客服二話沒説就答應了，現派人去買的小米，交代廚房熬好了送給我們。到晚上大女兒還是沒見好轉，又問周圍村子裏有沒有葯店，酒店馬上派人開車去很遠的葯店買葯，並且堅決沒收我的錢。第二天起來大家還在關切女兒的病情。真的是非常感動❤️石頭厝的服務真的做到了賓至如歸，如家人一般温暖、貼心。


騎馬環湖:一位小夥子一直跟着我們，幫我們安排好，還幫我們拍照，路上遇到被人扔掉的礦泉水瓶子，小夥子撿起來扔進了垃圾桶。非常有素養👍

吃：晚餐選擇了野生菌火鍋，真的是太好吃太鮮美了，從來沒吃過這麼好吃的火鍋湯底。絕對是土雞，所有的食材也很新鮮。早餐也分外豐盛，雖然我們起晚了，但是酒店為我們單獨加了餐：）

玩：晚上的篝火晚會和煙花表演特別贊，一定要參加，星空、音樂、篝火、煙花，小朋友的歡笑，我兒子還交到一位好朋友，倆人玩的非常起勁兒：）

…………

是一家非常用心在經營的酒店，全家人已經深深喜歡上了這裏，我和孩子們商量好了，明年夏天還來，來采菌子：）

msg:雪山腳下新開業的酒店，進入酒店需要經過2公里的石頭路，很顛簸，是屬於這個村的一個特色，比較適合自駕居住，因為在雪山下的酒店，所以周邊配套不是很多，晚上不適合出門，去周邊的古鎮經過一段路是沒有路燈的，很黑。我們預訂了2晚不同房型的，當天因為第二天入住的房型有空檔就直接給我們升級提前入住了，也免得第二天要換房間。先説優點：房間衞生乾淨，房間正對着雪山，第二天早上可以躺在床上看到日照金山哈哈哈，服務有求必應，奶茶和咖啡很好喝，早餐半自助形式，豐富多樣，送的火鍋套餐份量很多很好吃，素菜可以續加不收費。餐廳的小炒很適合我們的廣東胃，非常好吃。因為第二天的身體不適，酒店特意煮了粥給我們喝，還給了葯品，感謝酒店的照顧。不足的地方：洗澡的水壓比較小，第二天打掃房間的時候，沒有給我們提供山泉水、水果沒有換新，第一天的水果都爛了也沒有拿走，客房查房不細緻。下午茶沒有詢問需不需要提供。酒店晚上有篝火晚會，結束時間超過了制定時間。房間陽台正好對着篝火晚會的草坪，太吵鬧無法入睡，因為半夜12點才結束晚會，參加晚會喝酒的客人回房間比較吵。處理事情不夠專業，定價過高不配備該有的條件，讓我一度覺得酒店是在賣景色。

酒店設施非常齊全，全智能化操控，每一個角落都非常出片，抬頭就是雪山。

msg:“小隱隱於野”🏨這家玉龍雪山下，躺在床上就可以看到日照金山的野奢酒店民宿不僅有絕佳景觀位置，從服務到裝修都滿足了我對酒店的要求。入住第一天就感受到酒店員工滿分的熱情和服務。
	
📍酒店地理位置優越，遠離喧囂的城市，和景點僅有20分鐘車程，附近的村莊依然保有原始的風貌，步行過去15mins，雖然酒店靠近比較原生態的地方，但是該有的服務一樣不少。
	
就地取材，外立面裝修全是石頭，沒有華而不實的網紅風。茶室，暖爐，熱鍋，新鮮的食材一樣不少。

感謝管家：歸霖、小賢、橙子還有沒來得及記住名字的服務人員，感謝大家的照顧，讓我們住的很舒心。

等到其他季節還會來！

餐廳的食物也很不錯，奶茶更是一絕，真的是念念不忘。

msg:為一間房 赴一座城
本來這句話應該是寫給金茂璞修的（此處致謝璞修讓我對雪山附近的酒店感興趣，因而知道到了我們的“家”石頭厝）
不可否認金茂璞修是一座好酒店，但是在我心裏 石頭厝 才是我在玉龍雪山下的“家”。我注重酒店的品質，但是我更沉迷於家的温暖。
來 石頭厝 之前，其實我對她是否能讓我滿意而疑問。但是當我坐上迎接我們的車，帥帥跟我們介紹起時，我的心已經安下一半。踏入石頭厝，夥伴便為我們遞上一杯熱咖啡，我已然安心。行李由夥伴幫我們運到房間，又為我們介紹了房間。接着為我們準備了納西烤茶和下午茶，曬着暖陽，啜着普洱，愜意自在。怕我們無聊，喝完下午茶，小夥伴帶我們去騎了馬，參觀了玉湖村。遊玩歸來，老闆還邀請我同飲，一杯佳釀，一爐熊火，頓時驅走了寒氣，升起了暖意，不衹是身上暖和了起來，心裏更是暖暖的。待晚餐準備好，我們便去進餐，氂牛肉火鍋，土雞菌菇鍋都特別好吃，夥伴會説不夠就加，有什麼喜歡吃的也可以加，讓人有一種回家吃飯的感覺，這裏我要強烈推薦黑松露威士忌真的特別好喝。吃飽喝足，來到大廳，大家齊聚一堂，聊着天，喝着酒，馬哥帶頭唱起了歌，讓氣氛達到了高潮。休息前，董哥還讓小夥伴們帶我們放了煙花，真的好開心。怕我們休息的時候冷，小夥伴還準備了火盆。今夜我們帶着開心而眠。

入住酒店時很幸運，酒店將我們的房間升級成景觀最好的傍山景觀房，房間除了巨大的落地窗外，屋頂還有一扇天窗。置身於房間中，卧觀聖山，夢伴星河。入住的當晚，天地的厚愛，夜空之中，沒有一顆星星缺席，月亮與山神一訴衷腸。

今天是來雲南的第八天，我和老婆帶着四個孩子從出發昆明到版納，再到第三站玉龍雪山選擇石頭厝。一路上可以用跌跌撞撞來形容，在版納遊玩5天，為了方便和少踩坑選擇了一個品質私家團，也就是因為這個私家團把我們搞的心情全無，第三天就主動退團了。版納的美景和舒適的氣候讓人無比留戀，但遊玩過程中各種問題帶來的不適讓我對版納又有一種深深的失望，直到出發麗江遇見石頭厝。我們的行程是玉龍雪山一天，所以酒店也衹定了一天。但就是這短短的一天，真的非常治癒！從入住酒店當晚開始，遇到酒店裡的每一個人都充滿真誠。入住酒店後服務人員馬上添加微信拉起了一個6人微信羣（後來增加至8人）。入住期間有任何問題都可以在羣裏説明，會有專門對應的服務人員第一時間響應。晚餐是雲南的特色火鍋，很好吃，湯特別鮮，另外重點推薦一下酒店的那個什麼炒肉，忘記名字了。（後面我會配圖）真的超級無敵巨好吃！！！用餐期間服務人員告知酒店後面的大草坪晚上組織有篝火晚會，可以帶孩子參加一下，當時毫不猶豫就答應了，因為真的感覺她們每一個人都像家人一樣温暖，想要迫切的希望你可以更加開心。篝火晚會酒店佈置有免費的酒水，飲料水果，不管是情侶出遊還是帶孩子真的都非常適合。一羣人在星空下的大草坪上圍着篝火起舞，背後就是玉龍雪山，其他同住酒店的客人雖然陌生但是真的會被氣氛帶動起來，一起碰杯暢聊。旅行的美好意義被體現的淋漓盡致！
當天晚上酒店發來玉龍雪山日照金山的時刻表，（ps：真的非常準，精準到分鐘級）我們也很幸運的看到了日照金山！在這裏再次感謝酒店的服務人員，真的很感動！另外有一些酒店的增值服務，太多了感覺自己也寫的太長了，不過我覺得真正需要的人會想要看到，不妨多嘮叨兩句。早上出門服務人員送來了氧氣瓶。（是酒店免費為住客提供的，雪山上賣60一瓶！）6人出行叫車不方便被酒店專人安排送到雪山，並且還負責給接回來，感動哭😭酒店旁邊還有一個馬場，房費套餐裏包含有兩匹馬可以環湖，但是考慮我們人多給了4匹，最後沒玩爽又多加了兩匹，弄的我都很不好意思，一再表示要付錢，但是都被果斷拒絕！説起來是兩點退房，但是酒店的服務一直持續到我們離開酒店的那一刻，當時已經5點多鐘。
不知道寫什麼了，短短一天卻有太多的細節，
總結：選擇入住石頭厝是目前為止雲南之旅最正確的選擇，旅程中出現問題的時候總是各種遷就，得過且過。衹有在石頭厝，深深的有種被寵的感覺。感謝所有酒店的服務人員，感謝你們的辛苦付出。祝你們新年大吉。也祝和石頭厝有緣的大家温暖幸福，一生被愛。晚安！

環境：8月份新開業 感覺老闆是個很有品味的人 這個裝潢設計沒話説 真想一輩子住在這裏 房間看出去180度欣賞雪山 早上從日照金山的美景中醒來 人生還能更美好一些嗎

服務：房間包含下午茶一份 雲南特色的蜜餞 咖啡酒水飲料全天暢飲 拿鐵愛好者狂喜有沒有！早餐還行 煎蛋配的醬油和家裡的好像不太一樣 非常好吃 小哥還會現炒焦糖奶茶 ***香了 火龍果甜的想吐 懷疑我之前20多年吃的都是假火龍果……晚餐包含雙人火鍋 我們選了氂牛火鍋 感覺不夠吃又加了蛋炒飯和松茸炒臘肉 大家一定要嚐嚐 太太太太鮮美了 嘎嘎下飯 有幸嚐到了3年的生醃火腿 配上紅酒簡直是極品美味 都捨不得吃完嗚嗚嗚 騎馬環湖和篝火晚會也在酒店套餐裏 這棵樹是仙女樹 湖是仙女湖 有遇到拍婚紗照的 太好出片了 

這裏的服務生都是00後但是服務和態度真的很好 不是五星級酒店那種商務友好 而是發自內心的熱情 我高反很嚴重 爬一層樓梯稍微快點就會頭暈眼花耳鳴 他們送了我三罐氧氣和godiva巧克力 我老公説外面買買50一瓶 太不好意思了 管家式服務 有求必應 想喝啥想吃啥羣裏吼一聲立馬給你送來 衣服洗好烘乾送來 簡直是私人管家式服務 我相信你們一定會成功的！！！

麗江此行最大的收穫 不是日照金山而是真真切切的住在這裏感受到這個城市給予我的最大温柔

你無法想象在這個石頭堆砌的小村落裏
有這麼一家巴適充滿魅力的雪山酒店 
可以早起睜眼看日出可以騎馬徒步去雪山大峽谷看看 可以慢悠悠享受晚間的篝火

入住的這天一來店長就熱情的招呼我們 
陪着我們去玉湖村 告訴了我們很多這裏的故事 
我們爬上了璞石咖啡館的房頂 
走進了一家馬幫烤茶的火鍋店 
一路看到了村民門口拴着的小驢 和 滿滿一山野的馬兒
儘管這個村子很小 小到衹有幾步路

晚上風很大 氣温很低 篝火取消了
轉而坐在前台烤火喝酒 
前台小姐姐拿了好多水果和炸洋芋給我們當下酒菜
睡前點起了屋裡的壁爐 喝着小姐姐們熱的牛奶看了會書
其實這次是因為工作繁忙純粹想要出來走走放鬆 
沒想到石頭厝 反而成了我這次最大的驚喜

我很喜歡這裏 喜歡到和自己約着有機會還要再來這裏

服務：酒店裡的小夥伴們都很熱情也很舒適的距離感，對於社恐也毫無壓力。每個人的眼神裏都有着真誠，對麗江更愛了。每年都來，明年來還來這裏。

msg:玉湖村龍女湖旁的網紅酒店，今年八月新開的，我很喜歡玉湖村這種避世的小村子，很安靜很舒適。酒店景觀無敵，就在玉龍雪山旁邊，抬眼就是雪山，很大機率能看到日照金山。
酒店房費裏包含很多項目，可以免費環龍女湖騎馬，下午茶，篝火晚會，負責篝火晚會的小哥很熱情，我們玩的很開心。有一位管家名字叫陳冠希哈哈哈，好特別的名字～還贈送晚飯的氂牛肉火鍋，自己加兩個菜就好，菜品味道很好。
房間不算特別大，但小而美，全智能操控。選的雪山景觀房，躺在床上就能看雪山，舒服～
特別要誇店家的服務，入住當天是我的生日，我沒跟店家説，但check in的時候前台小姐姐應該是留意到了我身份證上的生日日期，他們晚上在給我松晚安牛奶的時候，給我了一個大大的驚喜——生日蛋糕和香檳！還給我唱生日歌。我太感動了，沒有想到我能在他鄉收到滿滿的生日驚喜。我的感謝無以言表，愛你們每個人～

△酒店陳設有設計感，隨手出片，我拍的照片都沒有濾鏡。△房間很乾凈，尤其是衞浴及床品。△智能馬桶，馬桶旁還有沖洗器，穆斯林友好。△房間全智能系統，躺在床上一鍵打開窗簾看雪山頂雲捲雲舒，晚上一鍵打開天窗在星空下入眠，絕了。△送的牛肉火鍋太實誠，我們以為鍋小肉量肯定不多，沒想到下面是用肉塞實的…根本吃不完。△餐廳的菜很好吃，不吃辣也可以做，早飯也很實誠，就在我們吃自助吃得差不多的時候突然上了一份特色拼盤…好吃啊可是真的吃不下了。△酒店全是俊男靚女（老闆挖人真的狠）弟弟妹妹都善良且真誠，彷彿回家一般，他們的陪伴使這趟旅程温暖而有意義。△篝火晚會可以跳舞或者欣賞別人跳舞或者欣賞無人跳舞時氣氛組小哥臉上尷尬的笑容。

這次來雲南總共住了5家酒店，這家是最棒的，原本衹是看中可以和馬兒小狗互動，沒想到最後竟不想走了。千言萬語匯成四個字，下次還來。

餐廳：送的火鍋看着衹有菜和肉但分量很大，還送一大鍋銅鍋土豆米飯，想吃什麼還可以加，廚房有現炒菜可以點，就像家裡廚房，我加了個炒菜好像還沒算我錢？😂餐廳不大但是挺温馨，晚上會生火，餐廳也是依雲等半自助隨便拿，還有自製的葯酒，老闆隆重推薦黃精酒，也是我生平第一次喝白酒hhh，不知老闆向總看着很樸實，不知是不是看我一個人，兩晚的晚餐都陪我吃，邊聊邊喝點小酒，就像在朋友家一樣。早餐也非常精緻，牛肉米線好吃～下午茶有地方特色但小意見每個都太甜了，品類可以豐富一些。

這裏更像是民宿或一個朋友家，每個工作人員都有温度，都有“人味”，年紀也都很小，讓在大城市呆的窒息的我如沐春風，不管真假，你能感覺到他們把你當成來家裡做客的“朋友”，而不是住酒店的“客人”濃濃人情味。選的背景音樂也有品味，是助眠放鬆的那種舒緩音樂很好聽。印象深刻的一些瞬間：老闆向總親自車接機、晚上陪我吃飯喝酒聊他店的事情，陳冠希小哥一上午陪我玩幫我照相給我拎包、剛到的第一天遇見我最愛的王大陸，冠希小哥開車陪我追星幫我偷拍、老闆冠希等帶我開車爬山🧗‍♀️，每次出行都有車免費接送，有次我自己打車還幫我報銷，感覺生怕我自己花一分錢哈哈、我説橘子好吃小妹就又給我抓了一大把橘子🍊、每次進門三朵、七月等問我要喝點什麼像回家一樣，篝火晚會熱情的納西族土豪房東馬哥的奔放舞蹈和宏亮歌喉響徹夜空，大家一起烤火喝酒跳舞、我離店時，小哥小龍還送我lindor巧克力，給我帶上依雲水怕我不夠喝😂歸霖小妹開車30分鐘送我下山做核酸又30分鐘把我送到下一間酒店……大家雖然很年輕像弟弟妹妹，但是服務意識都很強，且是滲透到骨子裡的，不是刻板模式化的，而是真的用“心”在服務，看着很隨意的一些舉動中，就把服務做的很到位，這才是真的高手。今年8月剛開業，希望不止是試營業期間這樣完美，，希望你們把這份完美一直延續下去！住酒店到現在服務體驗最好的一家！很感動～～祝石頭厝生意越來越好，希望生意好了以後不要降低標準，真正好的東西大家都會有目共睹！我還會再“回家”的！

msg:第一次來到麗江旅行，石頭厝帶來的是賓至如歸。熱情的馬哥、向總、DJ阿Long….。即便房間是獨立的，當你推開門走向大草坪上的篝火，載歌載舞，大口喝酒的時候，所有人都好像是多年未見的朋友。與眾多酒店不同，這裡有的是最珍貴的人情、煙火…
會再回來的！

訂好房後，橙子小姐姐加了微信，安排車子過來接我們，解答我們的疑問，貼心告訴我們最近的核酸點（順路直接去民宿）
到了以後有一位“大力士”小姐姐幫我們把兩個行李箱直接搬上三樓，非常感謝辛苦了
這家店最絕的是咖啡和酒暢飲，直接無敵！
唯一遺憾的就是最近天氣不加，無法看到美麗的風景。
石頭厝還有很棒的是組織活動，馬哥帶我們騎馬，晚上有篝火跟五湖四海的陌生友人把酒言歡。
總之這次體驗無敵了，已經推薦給朋友們了嘻嘻

房間是網紅最喜歡的ins風，雖然對這種風格不感冒，但各種設備配置都非常用心，能和非旅遊區2000rmb以上的國際品牌酒店站在同一水準了，美中不足是電視不能投屏，而且在雪山上遇到雷雨會跳閘。

吃喝良心，旁邊玉湖村有很多原生態餐廳🫡店裡自帶的火鍋也很美，氂牛肉火鍋比大研安縵還好吃。

因為下雨，沒體驗到篝火晚會無限酒水，不過店裡做的咖啡也很贊！

最後就是風景，我定的房間景色美哭，反正我覺得沒花冤枉錢！

最後，建議老闆在下一個旺季來臨前刷刷牆，檢修一下各種軟硬裝，店裡的裝修風格尤其是大白牆在潮濕環境下肯定容易老化，祝越來越好！希望再來的時候不會失望🤗

msg:給全5分，表示我願意再來。
但不表示沒問題哦，優缺點都簡略説一下吧。
優點：酒店位置絕佳，雪山下，龍女湖旁，騎馬放空遊山玩水都可以。酒店的設計風格完全在我的審美上，真的超讚，簡約的質樸風，每件傢俱每個角落都有精心搭配的軟裝，看得出花了不少心思。
服務很好，每位工作人員都很盡心盡職，積極主動地幫助客人解決問題，我們家小朋友入住的時候身體不太舒服，酒店主動提供氧氣罐，幫小朋友準備清淡的飲食，晚上小朋友弄臟了床褥，也很快來人更換，真的非常過意不去。
酒店的酒水飲料目前也都是免費暢飲的，雖然品種不多，但是讓客人的感受非常好。
房間的設施都很有檔次，戴森的吹風機，SMEG的電熱水壺，床品舒適，空調尤其優秀，非常安靜。
酒店坐落在山腳下，夜晚非常安靜，睡得很好。
缺點的話，硬件上，主要是我住的那間，沒有沙發之類的傢俱，除了一個很小的行李架，就沒有可以放置物品的地方了，所以打開行李箱，東西衹能放床上和電視櫃上，如果可以再有一些實用的傢俱，會方便許多。
公共區域的衞生還是要多注意，草坪啊，衞生間啊，淺色的牆面樓梯，真的還挺考驗後期的維護，很容易顯臟。
看得出來，目前人手緊張，所以難免會有些不足之處，完全理解，我説那麼多有的沒的，也是希望酒店能做的更好，相信下次來的時候，應該會有更好的體驗，期待！

1-服務團隊讓人有家人的感覺，和善且周到。因為第二天騎馬入峽谷，兩小朋友沒帶墨鏡🕶️，團隊小姐姐發動一羣小夥伴在大年初一的晚上找超市買，第二天早上順利搞定，還硬不收錢！在此致謝🙏
2-小朋友最愛石頭厝的夜間煙火和篝火晚會！ 算起來還是第一個有煙火的春節！
3-餐廳的東西好吃，好吃，好吃😋！ 免費發的烤肉真太香了！
4-貼身旅程嚮導，推薦我們去的峽谷物超所值。儘管冬季草甸湖泊略遜，但還是被峽谷的開闊震撼了！也表揚5歲的小朋友自己一人一馬也超順利完成了旅途！
5-位置超讚，玉湖村邊，龍女湖畔，玉龍雪山腳下！（可能這一點要放到第一條？）
