msg:Most important part: Checkout time is at 2PM!!!

I was thoroughly impressed by this hotel. The room is very spacious, clean, trendy and the checkout time. If you are visiting Shanghai and need to wait for an afternoon flight/train, the checkout time will make your trip back more comfortable. 

Thank you to Wang Jie for the amazing service and for also upgrading my room for free (from 2nd floor to 12th floor) ❤️ ❤️ 

I highly recommend this hotel.

msg:Hotel stay was really nice and clean. We enjoyed our stay and thought it was well worth the price. The only downside is that our room smelled a little bit like someone had smoked in it but it wasn’t a big deal. The location also isn’t super central, but we hadn’t explored the northern part of Shanghai before so it was cool to see. There is a really good noodle place like a 15 min walk from the hotel. There is also an underground market at one of the stations for line 10 close by. Underrated area in my opinion!

Staff seemed very confused about the “gifts” included in the hotel booking, and opening times of the bar for new years but Mr Lee was very helpful. The rooms are decent. A little dirty marks on the wall. Could definitely offer better services such as changing bedding pillows or room service. Not worth the money we paid.

The room was so dirty that we felt disgusted by it. We even asked the staff to clean again but even after that it wasn't pleasant. The breakfast buffet was low on variety and the food had not the best quality. The dining area was very dirty so it was unpleasant to eat there. The second day we decided not to eat there. I total we do not recommend this hotel since it is not on the level of other hotels in this price range.

msg:We stayed in the most expensive room in the hotel (rooftop suite with the bathtub). It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either - it's pretty worn in parts. The were strange stains all over the walls (it looked like someone had been fighting and throwing drinks at each other, or kicking a dirty football against the walls), and the bottom of the sofas and chairs pretty dirty too (most of these could be cleaned with a deep clean) and much of the furniture was worn with scuffs. It looks like the guests that stayed there recently just had their feet all over the sofas and stuff. The shower head doesn't move which would make it hard to shower if you wanted to wash your hair. Breakfast was very Chinese style but it looked good (we weren't hungry though and just grabbed a coffee). The mini bar was basic but there was lots of bottled water available. There was old water in a milk jug too, which made me feel like it hand' t been cleaned properly. We also had to give the bath a good clean ourselves before we used it as it hadn't been cleaned properly (there were some black grease marks on the bath which only build up over time of not being cleaned well). We cleaned this off ourselves before using it and gave the whole bath a good scrub with soap. I grew up with horses so I'm by no means a germaphobe, but it was grubby even by my standards. It wasn't disgusting, but not what I'd expect at this price point. The staff were mostly friendly however we acted like we didn't know Chinese to see how they acted and they were a little impolite at times (just a little, but this is kind of common in China). As an example, we asked for some champagne glasses and in Chinese one girl said to the other 'I don't know where the champagne glasses are, just give them wine glasses'. It's small, and champagne glasses did turn up in the end, but the tone was almost irritated and it felt a little rude in context. Is it rude if they think you can't understand? I don't know! We also had to request hair and toothbrushes as they weren't in the room. 

I feel a little petty writing it, but at 3000 RMB per night I would expect a pretty seamless, high end experience. 

We had a great time, but the room needs a little TLC and a good clean.

The only downside was the light in the room. We like sleeping in complete darkness however we didn’t manage to switch off the lights in the wardrobe area.

msg:It was a great experience. Shanghai locals recommend that everyone must stay here once! My husband celebrated my birthday. It was a bit late after watching the fireworks show at Disney, so I planned to have a romantic time in a hotel where I could see the three-piece suite, and booked a suite.

Facilities: The room is on the top floor, the decoration is quite new, elegant and generous, and the three-piece suite can be seen in the living room and bathtub. The hotel lobby is also small and exquisite.

Hygiene: Clean and hygienic, the towels are all new, white and soft. The bed is also very comfortable. There are no stains on the sofa seats.

Environment: In the core area of ​​North Bund, overlooking the Huangpu River and the three-piece suite, the price-performance ratio is good. The parking space is tight, and the hotel does not waive the parking fee. The subsidy was given, and finally I paid 50 yuan for one night. In an area where every inch of land is valuable, it is understandable.

Service: Having said so much, the best thing is still the service. Knowing that it was my birthday, the hotel gave me a beautiful cake, and the room also reserved the best room in the hotel on the top floor, the 15th floor. Thanks to Miss Jiejie. She knew we would be back from Disneyland late, but she still reminded us of the lights-out time for the three-piece suit. She hoped that we would not miss the beautiful view of the Pujiang River. It was really thoughtful!

Not only did he move my luggage for me, but he also gave me a small gift when I checked out. The service is really good. I recommend you to try it!

msg:Walk to the right from the hotel, and you will reach Suzhou River in less than ten minutes. Looking up, you will see Waibaidu Bridge and Oriental Pearl Tower. Then walk along the Bund, with flowers blooming on the roadside, people bustling around, and that classic old song ringing in my ears~~~ It feels so good. The expectations before check-in were not disappointed. The hotel service is quite good, making people feel very comfortable. It is cost-effective and I will recommend friends to stay here. The free snacks and mineral water at the front desk are super practical. Although the parking lot is charged, it is only 50 yuan a day, which is lower than those nearby. The front desk service is warm ❤

The towels provided in the rooms with more than 1,000 yuan are all broken, the sofa is also dirty, the hygiene is very poor, and the bathroom slippers are still hairy... Without further ado, let’s just look at the pictures. Many places were not photographed. It was really uncomfortable to stay there for one night. No more. When I checked out, I was told that the room rate was 20% off, but after the discount, it was still more than 1,000 per night. The quality could not keep up with the price, so I was advised to cancel the stay.

The exterior was very imposing and gave me a sense of security. The interior of the hotel was also spacious and elegant. There were many private seats in the lobby for rest. The space was bright and clean. After checking in, I asked the service staff about nearby places to eat and how to get to the Bund. I went out for a walk. It was indeed very close to the Bund. It only took more than ten minutes to get to the Oriental Pearl Tower by taxi. However, it was too amazing to check in at the Oriental Pearl Tower in North Bund. Hahaha. The front desk was very enthusiastic.

msg:Because Guangzhou Yazhi is very high-end, I decided to book this hotel; I thought it was the same as Guangzhou Yazhi, and it was also a hotel with a night view! First of all, I affirm the overall service of the hotel. The software is five-star, and the hotel staff are very professional (except for the cool lady on duty at 8 pm on May 3), all very good! The location is also good. The Bund is very close to Baidu Bridge, and you can also go to North Bund Green). Next, I will spit out the shortcomings. The hotel's hardware is only three-star level, not worthy of five stars. It is estimated that it is only the condition of the Orange Hotel next to it. There are few places to eat around and in the hotel. Basically, the tenants order takeout; because of the location where every inch of land is valuable, the conditions are very limited; the room is on the second floor, the window opens automatically, and there is a wall opposite, and the residents of the opposite apar**ent are very helpless. The room network is basically unusable, the TV freezes from time to time, and there is no HBO-bad review, and the screen projection and app are basically unusable because of the poor network. The bathroom and toilet in the room only have glass doors, which are completely open, and the curtains on the opposite side must be closed to change clothes. There is only one socket on the tea table, and you can't even plug in a hair dryer. There is basically no partition in the room, which is inconvenient for a family on a business trip. The hotel has a good breakfast, and other needs can only be taken out. The hotel bar is also very deserted, with only the diligent brother working hard, and the consumption is also a five-star standard. Overall, the price is not worth it. I will not choose this hotel next time. There are still many choices at the same price. Finally, the location of this socket design is absolutely amazing. Is it possible that the guest accidentally trips and the hot water spills out? How dangerous. I am very unhappy with the hotel's hardware, but I still have to praise the hotel service staff. They are so hardworking and professional. The introduction says "Meihao Group has created oriental aesthetics for three years", but I really can't feel any beauty. Personal stay experience! Only represents personal opinions!

You can't believe the bad things said on the Internet. We arrived very late, and the front desk lady was also very considerate and caring. The environment inside the hotel is also very good, very comfortable, and soundproof. Before I checked in, I asked the hotel staff to help pay attention to a quieter room, and then they helped to keep it very considerately. The stay was very comfortable, and the aunt who disturbed the hygiene was also very good. In addition, the hotel's breakfast in the morning is very rich, with both Chinese and Western food. They are very considerate. You can also see the Oriental Pearl Tower on the roof. The hotel is very close to the Bund Town. I usually don't like to walk and I walk slowly by myself. It's really close. It is a very, very recommended five-star hotel. Don't really believe what is said on the Internet. The fragrance of the hotel is very good. The lady was very considerate to send me a bottle. When I ordered takeout, there was also a very cute robot delivered to the door, but I didn't have time to take a photo, so this hotel is worth recommending.

The predecessor of Shanghai Bund Elegant Hotel was relatively long. You can see Pudong Four-piece Suite, Waibaidu Bridge, and the Bund in a ten-minute walk from the hotel. Don't be too comfortable to have a meal near Yu Garden in the evening and walk back to the hotel from the Bund. It was late at night, and the landscape lights outside the window went out, which was another kind of quiet beauty. The hotel room is also very large, the bed is relatively wide, and it is very friendly to families with children. The coffee in the hotel lobby is very delicious. The sanitation is also very good. And the hotel service is also very good. There are souvenirs when checking out, and the service of Huang Xin at the front desk is really good. I will give priority to staying next time.

msg:Very, very bad check-in experience. I spent more than 900 yuan to stay in a three-star hotel. The price doesn't match the configuration and service at all. The hotel is not soundproof. You can hear people talking next door. You can hear people talking very clearly in the corridor. It is no different from having no door. I didn't sleep well all night. At 2 or 3 o'clock, I heard countless heavy door slams. The decoration of the room is also very simple and superficial. The walls have many cracks, are dirty, and are in various tatters. There are also exposed wires and crooked plug sockets. The light comes on as soon as you walk past the toilet area and cannot be turned off, which affects the rest of the roommates. The blue light in the toilet was on all night, it was so scary. The breakfast had very few varieties and was very mediocre. It cost nearly 200 yuan to add breakfast, so we were given just this. I laughed. A hotel like this is not equipped with ironing equipment. We have to go to the laundry room on the fourth floor to get it. There are two garment ironing machines, one is not working and the other is extremely dirty. It's far worse than an international five-star chain brand, and it's not as good as an ordinary three-star express hotel. It’s just a waste of money. I will never come here again, and everyone should not stay here either. It's useless to contact the hotel and the sincerity of the service is very poor. In short, if you don't come, you won't be fooled.

msg:I don't know where all these good reviews come from. The room is very hygienic and full of dust. When I open the door, there is a strong smell of sewage that makes me sick. After checking in in the afternoon, I called the front desk to ask the front desk to send a pair of baby slippers to the room, but they never did. The temperature in Shanghai was 22 degrees on the day we stayed. It was so hot that I couldn't sleep at night. The air conditioner was turned on to the lowest setting to cool down, but it was too hot. The child tossed and turned until about 12 o'clock in the morning before falling asleep. After falling asleep, he also sweated a lot. My husband went downstairs and contacted the front desk to ask for an air conditioner fan to be delivered to the room. The front desk said that they would call to help. However, my husband waited in the corridor for a long time without delivering it. When he went downstairs, he saw that the front desk was asleep and did not help at all. He later thought that My husband called me. Speechless, it’s already two o’clock in the morning. The room fee of more than 1,000 yuan is not cheap. It is the worst hotel experience ever. The attitude of the female staff at the front desk is also very average and indifferent. There is only one male staff who has a very good attitude. Be patient. The rooms are also quite shabby, so please choose carefully!

msg:Ctrip classifies this hotel as luxurious and five-star, which is really questionable! I booked three rooms, and the layout of two of the luxurious king-size suites was simply vomiting blood. The bedrooms were pitifully small, so I decisively asked the front desk to pay the difference and upgrade to a one-bedroom suite. The space was not bad. However, the cigarette ash in the corner, the plastic tablecloth, the set-top box stuck with tape, etc., really don't deserve luxury and five stars! The only thing that can be praised is that the attitude of the front desk is not bad, and there are plenty of snacks such as tangerines.

msg:As a five-star hotel, the price is relatively moderate and not expensive, which is worthy of the location on the North Bund.
First let me talk about the parking lot. The so-called parking lot is shared with the property next door and can be 50% off. It is 50 yuan a day. The front desk clearly informed me that the discount is only available because you stay in a hotel, but the fee is fine. However, there are very few parking spaces, so you can survive in the cracks. It's still open-air. If there are too many self-driving tourists, they don't know how to park.
When I entered the room, the lighting was very dim. I always thought that I had not turned on any of the lights. At first glance, it looked relatively clean. I walked to the bathtub and saw a bunch of unknown hair. Think about it and forget it. I wanted a buckwheat pillow and the front desk said that it might not be available. I had to look for it. Then because I was too tired and wanted to take a shower, I called the front desk and said that I didn’t need to look for it. Forget it, I didn’t need to give it away. After I took a shower and washed it halfway, my aunt kept knocking on the door and said that it was really a gift at that time. Quite speechless. The room facilities are relatively old.
Let me talk about the most unbearable experience is the temperature of the room. Because there is a bathtub, of course you can take a bath. The bathtub and the room have no door, which cannot block the air and humidity. After taking a bath, the temperature of the entire room has reached 29 degrees. I tried to adjust the air conditioner, but it was useless. Even in my own home in the summer, it doesn't feel like 29 degrees. I opened all the windows in the room, but the air doesn't circulate at all. I don't know if it's a problem with the location of the room. I called the front desk and the front desk meant that your air conditioner was turned off. The temperature control was useless. Everyone thought it was too hot and couldn't help it, so they sent an electric fan up "in place". I want to say that the temperature in Shanghai has been unstable recently, with an average of about 10 degrees. There are always customers who are hot and cold. However, a five-star hotel cannot meet the needs of various customers. Many people around me have been infected with mycoplasma recently and the air is not circulated. It is not recommended to stay here.
I didn't get much sleep all night. The air was not circulating and it was very stuffy and uncomfortable. I opened the window and the Yan'an Tunnel was outside the window. It was very noisy and seriously affected my sleep.
The only advantage is that the takeaway will be delivered to the door of the room in a timely manner using a robot.
I have stayed in so many hotels, and they are all five-star hotels. This time I really had too high hopes.

Parking is available at the door, and it is close to the subway station, about seven or eight minutes' walk. You can also walk to the Bund, which is very convenient

Because all the people who come to stay are from out of town, travel routes and nearby attractions are displayed and recommended in the lobby. Jiajia's service at the front desk is very enthusiastic. The whole check-in process is very fast, which reduces the waiting time. When I come and leave, someone helps me pick up my luggage and delivers it to me all the way outside the hotel. The service is very attentive. Takeaways are delivered to Jiajia at the front desk. The robot sent it upstairs, it was very cute.

We could still hear people talking outside at one o'clock in the morning. I called the front desk to report the problem and they were told that someone would come up and take a look. After waiting for a long time, a man came and said that he felt very quiet when he came here just now. . Emm, brother, I can't let you enter my room to see if it's noisy. I finally got a room on the fourth floor at 1:30, but it was much smaller than the original one. A room that costs 1,300 a night is not as good as a room that costs 400 a night in Beijing😅

Service: On a rainy day, we went to the front desk to borrow an umbrella. The two of us were given a small, poor children's umbrella, and we had to deposit our room card before we could borrow it.
I don't want to give it a star

However, the front desk asked me to wait and told me to add a WeChat account. They told me on WeChat that I was in I saw the online price was over 900, so I placed the order directly. The front desk service deliberately delayed the time, and probably didn't know that I had placed the order. He contacted me later to say that he had a room. I asked him what the price was, and he told me that it was over 2,200 for two nights. I said it was more expensive than online, but I was told to book online. When I looked at the online price, it was already over 1,000, but I had already taken a taxi in front of the hotel. Forget it. I just decided to stay there, but as soon as I checked in, I found out that the building behind the hotel was mostly undergoing renovations from 9 am to 7 pm. At that time, I was buzzing, hey, there was no breakfast yet, I was drunk, and the problem was Lou was heartbroken when he saw the environment and decoration. I was so speechless, and the service attitude was not good. They had some oranges and buns at the front desk, so I went to get some. The waiter's expression was unflattering. It's just a rubbish hotel anyway.

msg:Apart from the compensation for the beautiful view of the Bund, this was a particularly disappointing experience at this price. The girl at the front desk is very unprofessional and very poor in customer service. I had a meal in the morning, but the guy who made noodles there was irritating and unfriendly. Then the food was gone and no one added it. But the aunt who cleans the room is very polite and affable. Then after this bad experience occurred, I also reported the situation to Ctrip. Ctrip was very responsible and solved this problem. Then the hotel's front office manager Li also handled the matter very well. By the way, if you book this hotel with Ctrip, don’t pay too much attention to the free gifts, because this is not the case at all, so don’t have high hopes. In fact, the front desk patiently solved this problem and it was not a big problem. But of course the front desk said that we don't have this service, which would be very distressing. After all, I'm sorry for the price. Also, when everyone checks in, if there is no electricity in the room, you can insert the room card and pull it out again. In the words of the waiter, they say that they are an old hotel and it is not surprising for such a situation to occur. In short, don't have high hopes. If conflicts arise, don't communicate with the front desk. It's better to communicate with the front desk manager. After all, you should be happy when you go out.

Although the lobby is not big, the high-quality service is still there. The elevator is very convenient, but you can take the stairs, which is old-fashioned. It's not in a special safety channel, so it's not hot and I can exercise. The hotel is located on the North Bund. I think this place is super nice. It is very close to the bustling area but not like the hustle and bustle of the Bund. It was raining when we went there, and the gray tones matched with the buildings from the Republic of China period made it feel like the time, space and location were misplaced. The breakfast is also very worthy of the room price, and the freshly cooked noodles come with a variety of toppings. I will consider this place next time I come to Shanghai. A perfect travel experience, worthy of my perfect expectations


The transportation is very convenient and quiet. The room facilities and decoration are very stylish. It is within walking distance to Nanjing Road and the Bund. The bedding in the room is very comfortable and the power supply is basically sufficient. There is a Lawson downstairs in the hotel. It is very convenient to buy water and snacks. There are buses nearby. If you come back from a place far away from the Bund, you can take a taxi without having to take a taxi for two or three stops. It is very convenient. I think it was Route 65, but I can’t remember it clearly. There is also a subway station that is very convenient. It’s about ten minutes’ walk from Sichuan North Road.

msg:The air conditioner in the room only blows air but does not cool. I guess the outdoor unit was not turned on. The indoor temperature rose from 26 degrees to 27 degrees. After sleeping for 2 hours, I was woken up by the heat. I opened the door for ventilation and opened the window. Fortunately, when the temperature dropped, I turned it on. The wind from the window blew in and I had to sleep when the indoor temperature dropped. It was a very bad experience. When I stayed at the hotel, it only said that parking was charged 50. It didn’t say that I had to pay the hotel before I could go out. Otherwise, I just went out and paid 100.

The sheets are also very clean, without any peculiar smell or stains. The service is also very good, especially the warm service from Xiaoying at the front desk, who thoughtfully arranged a high-floor room. The breakfast in the hotel is also well done, and the price is very affordable. Recommended!

msg:When I come to Shanghai alone, I want to book a hotel that is close to the subway and has convenient transportation. I visited several hotels, but none of them had good reviews. I found this elegant hotel not too far away, so I decided to come and check the situation before making a decision. The hotel is a few hundred meters away from the Sichuan North Road subway station, and it takes about ten minutes to walk there. The room was well kept, the sheets were clean and everything was neatly arranged. There is a restaurant on the first floor, and you can also scan the QR code to order and send it upstairs. It looks pretty good. There are several convenience stores nearby, as well as Starbucks, as well as several restaurants and bakeries. It is very convenient to eat. The customer service Xiao Min enthusiastically introduced the attractions and surrounding areas, sent us to the room, and helped store our luggage. The sour plum soup is also delicious. Generally speaking, it is a great hotel. I will book here next time I come to Shanghai.

But when we checked in, the hotel said that there were no rooms for the time being. I asked why? ￼They replied that a guest checked in at the clock￼? I asked again but I had already made a reservation to check in today. Why did I give my room to someone else? Then they replied that the previous guest was about to check out and they would clean your room immediately. What I want to ask is, is this how this hotel operates? ￼
Then the second thing was to call the front desk and ask for a clothes hanger. Then when the employees were delivering the clothes hangers, they just patted the door. Yes, they directly opened the guest's door with the room card and delivered the clothes hangers. Then I asked them angrily, are your employees so rude? They replied thinking I was out. ￼I just think this is a little rude and cannot guarantee the safety of guests￼Because how do I know if your employees will do anything rude?

The room temperature is 28 degrees and cannot be adjusted! Water stains were clearly visible on the bathroom counter and the hot water bottle was not clean. Unfortunately, I didn't take photos. I couldn't stand the heat at night and called the front desk. The front desk brought me a fan. The air blown by the fan was hot air! ! ! ! Didn't get much sleep all night! ! ! ! I'm sweating every time I turn over. It's so hot and there's no humidifier, which makes my nose bleed when I wake up in the morning. I don't understand the meaning of collective temperature control. Everyone's body temperature is different. Call the front desk. What's the point of providing an electric fan? . Very poor check-in experience! ! ! ! It's hot and dry, just like a sauna. It's not a bad review, it's just a really bad stay experience.

When we went there, we found that room 320 is a normal Youmei double room 42, 322. The room is not, except that the room is small and full of dust (as shown in the picture). Other hotels upgrade the guests. You can directly downgrade the guests. It is really okay. I went to the front desk to complain to her, and said the room was like this, and then changed it The front desk supervisor came to tell me that because room 322 is the last room, the layout will be different, and it will be occupied by guests even if it is covered with dust. Is such service and hygiene worthy of a 5-diamond luxury hotel? Later, it was said that room 427 was upgraded, and there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. This is your service attitude!
2. The toiletries are wrong! The introduction is Herborist products, but I don’t know what toiletries (as shown in the picture), such toiletries are worthy of a 5-diamond luxury hotel, and they are properly deceiving consumers!
The 322 tail room layout regrets not taking photos, it is an ordinary double bed room, whoever lives in it is unlucky! Comments on this real experience are likely to be blocked, so send them out!

Also, the exhaust fans and lamps in the bathroom and shower room can be turned off automatically, regardless of whether anyone is using it or not. It was reported to the front desk that it was from a safety point of view... Then why don't you consider the darkness and are not afraid of occupying the hotel? Guest fell? Also, during breakfast, the restaurant waiter turned off the air conditioner in the restaurant even though the guests were still there. Is your hotel okay? The lights in the room go out on their own, and the air conditioner in the restaurant is turned off manually. Does the restaurant have to be opened after we call? Can you tell me the reason here? It is undeniable that the location of the hotel is very good and the hotel facilities are also good. However, in terms of service management, it cannot keep up with your hotel facilities and positioning.

Unless friends booked it and wanted to stay together, they wouldn't even consider checking in. Sure enough, after checking in, I found that the room was old, the lights were dim, the carpets were stained, and the veneer on the wardrobe door was peeling off and none of it was intact. I seriously doubt that the 20-year renovation introduced on Ctrip is false information. I might believe someone who says it was renovated in the 1990s, and there are no signs of renovation! Also, the glass in the bathroom and shower is completely transparent. If you are traveling with your children, even if you don’t mind the old facilities, I strongly advise you not to choose this hotel. I decisively contacted customer service to check out of the store early. Black Diamond users rarely write comments, but bad ones must be posted to protect everyone!

The receptionist came out to help and couldn't help but stared at the customer as he struggled to pull it in. Later he found out the reason and said it was too hot outside. Don't say that I don't support domestic brands. I was really disappointed. I decided to go to Mandarin Oriental the next night. It was a world of difference. If you don’t believe it, you can try it.

msg:I initially booked a hotel near Sichuan North Road Subway Station on Line 10. Later, my colleagues suggested staying near the Bund. During the Chinese New Year, I also compared hotels such as All Seasons, Orange, and Jinjiang, and finally booked the Bund Hotel. Don't make a mistake. Xiaoxin at the front desk and Liangliang and Yaoyao have great service. The hotel facilities are good, clean and tidy. The key is that the location is good. It is very close to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street and you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower at a glance. The location is great and not too cost-effective. There are many shopping malls nearby, shopping and walking along the Bund are great. We also recommend free luggage shipping, which is very convenient when you go out for a stroll on the last day. I will continue to choose this hotel next time.

msg:As shown in the picture, we changed rooms three times in one night. The hygiene of each room was not up to standard. Even the hygiene of the bedding could not be guaranteed. There were blood stains, hair, cigarette ashes, strawberry stems left by the previous guest, and cigarette butts on the lobby carpet. There were so many problems, and only two employees were responsible for handling them in the middle of the night. The front office manager was on the line the first time he called, and he didn't answer the phone again. It was almost two o'clock when a supervisor came to handle the problem. We found a series of hygiene problems in front of the hotel staff. Finally, we fell asleep at almost three o'clock. We had no choice but to ask for leave and change the flight to stay one more night. As a hotel that charges according to five-star standards, there is no service, and the facilities are old and at most three stars. It is funny to avoid its own responsibilities? The hotel's housekeeping manager called again to ask about the whole thing and confirmed the room hygiene problems one by one. It seems that he is very active in solving the problems. In fact, his words and deeds reveal a sense of **dividing the responsibilities of each person in the hotel! Who wants to be so angry when traveling, and spend time dealing with such a mess! From this, it can be seen that the hotel has very poor mobility. There is no corresponding duty staff at night. If an emergency occurs, can it only be handled by two employees? It really highlights the incompetence and chaos of the hotel management!

I finally chose this hotel. It can be said that the staying experience is extremely poor, even with five stars. It was just a banner. First of all, there was no one to greet us when we arrived at the hotel. I went to the front desk by myself. The front desk was very small and busy. There was only one person who handled it. They gave us the room card without entering our ID cards. As a result, they were piled up and cleaned at the door of the room. When entering the room, it was even scarier. The floor was not cleaned at all, and the front desk didn’t even know it was not cleaned at 7pm. Finally, they told us to upgrade the room. The room was indeed quite big. Let’s not talk about the cleanliness of the carpets, sofas, and smart toilets. It is broken, there are no disposable towels for guests to consume, and all water drinks need to be consumed, and the smell in the room is too great, the corridor also smells, the room phone is also broken and there is no way to contact the front desk, these facilities in a five-star hotel No one knows that it is bad. No one reports it every day. It is really rubbish and makes people angry. I am really sorry for the price of this service facility. I hope to give my sincere advice to friends who will stay in the future. Be careful.

msg:Experience a super hotel. Xiao Zhai, the receptionist at the front desk, checked in very quickly, and got the room card in less than 5 minutes. The head office Liangliang also upgraded the high-floor landscape room for free. Chinese-style decoration and facilities are very modern. The bathroom is super big, and the brand of washing and care is the elegant brand of the group, which smells very good. Electric toilet. The bathroom and toilet are all sensor lights, so you don't have to struggle to find the switch when you get up at night. The takeaway is delivered directly to the room by a robot at the door. The front desk is responsive and the room service is very efficient! Late check-out until 14:00: Minibar is free and has a variety of options. Although parking is not free, the hotel thoughtfully called one day in advance to inform us of the half-price discount. Very cost-effective and very comfortable hotel. come back next time

The front desk is bright, not to mention super patient, serving every guest not only well, but also staying for two days for birthdays, and specially asked the room manager Li to give us a bottle of red wine as a gift. The room service is also very good, and every corner of the room is very clean, the environment is beautiful, the environment is complete, and the facilities are complete. Most importantly, the night view is really beautiful. The round bathtub has a panoramic view of the river! There are also candles placed by the bathtub, which makes people feel super comfortable and relaxed. The next day I heard that there was afternoon tea, and the room manager Li specially prepared it for us and sent it to our room. Considering that there are children, he warmly prepared milk🥛 If there is one, I will choose Yazhi Hotel next time

The attitude of the waiter is very bad. I went to check in at 11 o'clock and told me to check in at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. The room was not cleaned up. This is the first time I heard that a 5-star hotel cannot check in at 11 o'clock. I laughed.
The takeaway robot is under maintenance and cannot be delivered to the door. The waiter pretends to be stupid and refuses to deliver my takeaway to my room. I agree with the delivery guy that I will deliver it to him, and then there is no movement for 20 minutes. He said to me, "We don't have this service." Yours The robot is broken. Why should I bear the consequences? With this service attitude, it is strongly not recommended to stay!

Due to the masks, there were not many people, so you need to measure the temperature and check the health code and nucleic acid when entering the lobby. The location and landscape are very cost-effective. You can upgrade to the Executive River View Suite at the front desk, you can enjoy the view of the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Bund. It is a short walk to the Bund, about ten minutes walk. Lots of restaurants to choose from around. The room is fully equipped, such as electric curtains, electric reclining chairs, etc. It is also equipped with a capsule coffee machine. The little brother who checked in is very enthusiastic, and specially prepared a fruit cut for us, which is very delicate. He also helped to deliver the luggage to the room.

msg:Why is there no option for zero points? I don't want to give this hotel a single point!
When we arrived at the hotel, no one greeted us at all. When we walked to the reception desk, several of their employees were chatting by themselves. We waited for them to finish before entertaining us. Then the female employee who received us had a very bad attitude because we had to declare documents on a mobile phone. She knew what to fill, so when I asked her, her tone was super disdainful and she didn't mean to help the guests. Her attitude was very rude! Am I still being treated like this when I pay to stay at your hotel? **** Forget it, we held back, but it was absolutely horrible to go to the room! ! The attitude is bad, but the hygiene is unbearable! More than 1,000 yuan hotel can be so poor in hygiene? ! The carpets are all stained, the inside of the wine cup cabinet is moldy, the bathroom ceiling is moldy, the coffee table is full of dust, and the walls are stained, which can be described as horror, I beg you, don't live there , Whoever lives will regret it! Then I immediately asked them to change the room. Although they all gave us a newly renovated one (another floor) in the end, but that room felt like a series of Homelike Hanting, but their price turned out to be more than 1,000. ! The design of the room is super mentally retarded, the sensor light in the bathroom often turns off by itself, even if someone walks by, it will not turn on automatically, the bed is super wet, the sound insulation is super poor, and the corridor is loud when someone passes by, and the bathroom floor is full of stains. It was only in the morning that we found out that we were not given a comb, and no one answered the phone. We walked to the lobby with a mess of hair and asked them for a comb, and they found one for us.
We stayed for two nights in a row, and finally we couldn't stand it for one night and then returned!
In fact, this building cannot be described as a hotel. It does not look like a hotel at all. The reception is not good, the hygiene is not good, and the decoration is not good. Maybe it is because the location is expensive? But please believe me there are many good hotels in the vicinity of the same price, do not come to this one!

The front desk staff is also very enthusiastic. She also helped me to put the cake in the refrigerator in the lobby. It was very late and also helped me to deliver it to my room personally because I wanted to surprise my friends and I needed something and she said that they were very active and helped me deliver it to my room. It's really good. Hotel takeaway is also available. It is more convenient to use the robot to deliver it without going down to get the parking. It is also very convenient for 50 days. It is super affordable and the whole is very good. I am very satisfied. I will come here next time.

I will come again next time.

msg:I have a good impression of the elegance of Guangzhou, so I chose this restaurant. I didn't expect it to be a big mistake. I, a person who never criticizes, wrote a short essay here in the morning! There is no concierge at the door of the hotel when you check in, and no one cares about you at all. The key point is that during the epidemic, the health code and nucleic acid are not checked when you check in! People can come and go at will at the gate, which makes people feel very insecure. The attitude of the front desk was extremely bad. She was cold-faced throughout the whole process. I ordered takeout and called the front desk three times to ask the robot to deliver it. The tattooed female front desk of the hotel deliberately refused to deliver it. Her attitude was very bad. I haven't found it yet. There are too many takeaways, so I hung up the phone and went downstairs helplessly. I found that the hotel receptionist didn't even look for it. The female receptionist with the tattoo was just standing there in a daze! ! My takeout is left at the door! There is no other takeaway at all! The robots are here too! Even if the attitude is bad, the room is also very bad. At night, there will be abnormal noise from the machine at the door. People who are noisy cannot sleep at all. The sound insulation of the hotel is very poor. You can hear the people next door talking and walking normally. The air conditioner in the room is also Bad! It’s a day of over 40 degrees and no air conditioning! ! The windows were extremely dirty and the "scenery" outside made me feel very unhappy. The best service in the entire hotel was the latest robot! Watch people order food at the hotel front desk! I guess you have to have a relative from the boss to smile at you. With that arrogant and indifferent look, I thought the boss was standing there! Won't come again, thanks!

Parking is a bit inconvenient, there are not many parking spaces, and it has to share the parking space with the office building behind. 50/day is also convenient for entry and exit. Fortunately, the security guard is very enthusiastic.
The cleaning aunt is really speechless and cleans the room very enthusiastically. The front desk clerk is probably too busy and not very enthusiastic when checking in.
Depressed is the room, the curtains are not tightly drawn, and the sun will wake up in the morning. There is also sound insulation...that's really not bad...the toiletries are also miscellaneous.

msg:It's a wonderful hotel
First of all, the order stated that early check-in is possible. We arrived at the hotel at 4:30 that day, but it was said that there was no room yet.
Well, I waited for half an hour in the lobby and then asked the front desk. The front desk said to go upstairs and take a look. Then we waited for half an hour and then entered the room, and there was a sour smell. Was it lonely?
Then we asked to change the room, but we were told that there is no room now, well, we can only go to eat first
I came back at about 9 o'clock and told the front desk that I wanted to check in, but I was told that I had already checked in? My God, I am going to sleep on the street. Fortunately, I have a room. I can finally check in and take a shower.
Wonderful is here again
The light in the shower room is turned on and off from time to time, after 20 minutes, it has been turned on and off several times
There is no shower gel, and after telling the front desk, I found that there is no toothbrush. Tell me again
In the end, I waited for two sets of toothbrushes and still no shower gel
I originally booked for three nights, but I checked out at 10:00 the next day and changed hotels
This kind of hotel, the Ctrip platform really needs to review it carefully, is this considered a high-end hotel?

msg:I booked a city view room for my first stay. I could see the spiers of the Oriental Pearl Tower. It was really nice. It was completely blocked. The hotel experience was not as good as hundreds per night. The soundproofing was poor and the wireless network was not usable. I called several times and no one cared about the excuses given to us for the third time. It was just that we had no problem with it. Instead of trying to solve the problem, we shirk responsibility and make excuses. The food for breakfast was just average. The fruit after the meal is still unforgettable to me. The smell of kitchen knives is really disgusting. It is an unforgettable trip. It's so exciting.

I woke up 2 or 3 times to the heat, sweating all over my body. I couldn't help but open the window to get some air. I communicated with the front desk and asked the master to look at it. After a lot of tossing, the master came in and didn't fix it. He just told me that the air conditioner is turned off and it won't be hot. You can continue to sleep. ***, this Do you want me to open the window and sleep without the air conditioner? Because it is already tossing until 8 o'clock in the morning, so. The street is very noisy, and then I asked the air conditioner to communicate with the front desk and give me an explanation, so that the front desk contacted me, but there was no response, and I still asked them to call me again to urge them to give me a solution. The answer is that the air conditioner has not communicated with them, ***, I just have an aunt come up to communicate with me one more time, every time I communicate with someone, I have to repeat my situation, I haven’t slept all night, and the room is so hot No, it turned out that it was almost 10 o'clock, so I was asked to change to another room and sleep for a while? Total waste of my rest time, bad review of bad reviews. I was sweating all over my body, and I didn't take a shower, so I forced myself to sleep for two or three hours. Then it's time to check-out. 😡😡😡I was in a state of mental breakdown all day long.

msg:Those who came to play from Beijing on Valentine's Day also made a lot of comparisons on Ctrip, evaluating from several important factors such as price, environment, location, service, and equipment. (ps: I live in the second most expensive one, the Pearl three-piece suit)
The price is a fraction of 4,000 yuan for three nights. I think it may be expensive because of the location. It is relatively close to the Bund, but it is not very good to watch the night view of the Pearl, and it is blocked. Maybe it's better except for the most expensive room type.
Then the environment is average for me born in the 90s, the flowers in the pictures are all arranged by me, the design is a bit old, the design of the lobby is still relatively good, and then the corridors to the room appear relatively old, which can also be understood as It's an old shop, maybe it's acceptable for people in their 80s and 70s.
The service is also better when the front desk received us on the first day. Just the men, I was quite satisfied. When I left, it was a woman, and the impression was not very good. good. The second is the health service. I don’t know if I’m getting older. Since the bed is already made, at least I have to take a shot of the ash on it. It can be done in one night, but it is a bit unreasonable if this price can't do it.
The equipment is still the same sentence, it may be an old store, or a small advantage in the geographical location, (except the toilet is smart) like a sofa 🛋️, TV 📺, bathtub 🛁, shower 🚿 I live in a hotel around 500 in Changsha. The same, so I can only think that the price is more expensive than the location.
These are all sincere comments. Even if the above problems are not solved, it should be opened or opened, but in the future, there will only be more and more young people, and everyone is not stupid. time issue. If the hotels with less than 1,000 can do this, if the hotels with more than 1,000 can't do it, it can only be a step backward, and it will not be far from the end. I believe that these can get better and better. I also believe that the image of domestic hotels is getting better and better.

2. The service should be said to be good, the waiters are very polite, the freight elevator is separated from the passenger elevator, if the customer goes to the freight elevator by mistake, the cleaning aunt will let you go first, and will not ride with the customer, the details are ok
3. The facilities in the house are ok. The shampoo and bath are complete, and the dry and wet rooms are no problem. The biggest problem is the sound insulation. The wife is too bad. I think the sound in the corridor outside has amplifying effect. There is a switch at 2 o'clock in the evening. The door is so loud, it will wake you up, just imagine 😿
4. There are a lot of snacks in the surrounding area. The small shops are clean and the prices are favorable. Because the surrounding areas are residential areas, it is very good. It is not far from the Bund. You can walk past the Waidu Bridge and visit the Bund and the pedestrian street. It's very convenient to take a taxi back. (See the picture for a small shop in Planting Grass, and there is a fried dough stick that hasn't been photographed. I haven't eaten such delicious fried dough stick in a long time, and it looks clean)

msg:On a business trip in the North Bund, if you see it is within walking distance, come and try it.

Let me talk about the advantages first. First of all, the hotel is small and exquisite, and the interior decoration feels like a design hotel, which reminds people of some European hotels. Then the small suites have a reasonable layout, with walk-in cloakrooms, complimentary snacks, and windows. The third is that the bed is comfortable.

Besides the main disadvantages, there is no iron horse at the front desk in the lobby, and the waiters did not take into account the order of queuing. Many cigarette butts in the corner of the living room outside the window have not been cleaned (of course, it does not affect the stay, because there is nothing worth seeing outside the window). Finally, I don’t know if there is a KTV outside, and I sing until late in the middle of the night.

1. Very poor front desk service. The response speed is super slow, I gave my ID card three times to complete the move-in
2. There is a loud machine on the other side of the river, which is said to be the water circulation system of the building. When a room change was requested, the waiter smiled and said that some people care about others.
3. Ask if someone can help teach you how to use an iron, the front desk's reply is "None of us"
4. The bathroom has a very unpleasant smell
5. Look at the photos for the hygiene of carpets and sofas
6. Check out at 6 o'clock in the morning, no one at the front desk, no one came out after calling for a long time
7. There is a dirty piece on the pillow. I'm not sure if I did it, so I won't shoot
I said: Can you make the service better?
The waiter said: Don't compare us with Guangzhou's elegance, they are direct sales and we are franchising. There are a lot of good hotels on the Bund, so it’s great to live in Indigo.
Will never live again in the future.

msg:It took a few days to talk about my feelings about the elegant hotel on the Bund in Shanghai. We booked the hotel on Ctrip. We checked in at the end of August. When we walked into the lobby, we felt that the hotel was tall and the environment and service were very good. Fortunately, the little brother at the front desk told us that we had been upgraded to a deluxe suite for free, and the service staff also enthusiastically took suitcases for us. The hotel is not far from the Bund, Oriental Pearl Tower, etc. The children are also very satisfied. Next time I visit Shanghai, I will stay at this hotel.

In the current epidemic situation, a health code and an application code are required for check-in.

The staff are very enthusiastic, especially Xiao Zhu at the front desk, who has a strong sense of service and very welcoming people.

Very satisfied staying, will come next time.

He is warm, cordial and patient in service. We ordered the Youmei Twin Room, and he upgraded us. We lived in a one-bedroom, one-living room with a 68-flat city-view twin suite, which really gave me a big surprise. I would like to praise the hospitality of the hotel here. 👍

msg:The house was renovated, and I found a hotel nearby. Because I brought a lot of luggage, four or five boxes, the hotel brother Xiaolu saw him, and he immediately came over to help. I ran in and out, thank you very much! As soon as I entered the hotel, there were warm greetings from my little brothers and sisters, and a cold sour plum juice was provided at the time of check-in. Drinking this glass of sour plum juice in the sultry weather in Shanghai is really super happy! The young lady at the front desk is very professional and will do it for us right away. After check-in, a few enthusiastic brothers will help us take our luggage and take us to the room. She was patient and took the initiative to introduce some hotel services to us, such as laundry room and gym. There are also interesting places nearby. I like the decoration style of the room very much. It is simple and bright. The little brother told us about the room slippers, data cable, hair dryer, ironing machine, and told us about it. We need to call the front desk number "2" and ask us if the TV needs to be turned on. These details have made our family's favor with this hotel soar! The bed was very soft and comfortable. After a while, the housekeeper gave us fruit milk. Because of the children, we paid more attention to hygiene and epidemic prevention. This hotel will check the health code and itinerary code when checking in. The temperature was measured, and personal hygiene was not a problem. The room was bright and clean. After staying for several days, I would change towels, sheets and quilts every day. The aunt’s service attitude was also very good. We kept asking us if we needed it. We were very enthusiastic. Order takeout and a small robot delivered to the room. It’s almost a ten-minute walk to the Bund. It’s pretty close. It’s very convenient to take a stroll with the family after dinner. In general, it really gives us a sense of home. Hope The hotel is getting better and better, and I recommend everyone to stay!

You will arrive at the hotel by turning right and going straight. Walk for 10 minutes and the decoration is also very good. In terms of service, the waiter provides plum juice and towels for hand-wiping when checking in. The attitude is very warm and polite, especially Xiao Zhu who is staying in! After finishing the process, my little brother helped us take the luggage to the room. I have stayed in so many hotels. This is the first time this service is very good.

The room was specially selected for a parent-child room, but the breakfast restaurant did not provide baby tableware. In addition, it is different from other hotels in that there is a charge for parking, which is capped at 50 a day (50 if you stay for one night and check out the next day). The overall environment and the room are quite clean, and the coffee in the lobby is not bad

I started to book a deluxe double room. I was lucky enough to upgrade the room. Originally booked for two nights, the hotel’s warm and considerate service made me have to renew the booking for another 3 days immediately.
You don’t need to go downstairs to get the takeaway. The robot will bring it up, which is very fun.
Especially praise the butler Xiaoxin and Xiao Zhang! !
Very intimate, I feel like staying in a hotel and staying at home.
It must be a once-in-one hotel to applaud all the staff. 👏👏

Originally only planned to stay for 2 nights and went home on Sunday, but due to the "fireworks" arriving in Shanghai, all high-speed rail planes were suspended and they were forcibly stranded. I had no choice but to stay for 2 nights, so I stayed for 4 nights in total and I had a full experience of the hotel room.


The overall experience was not bad. I also delivered milk and fruit plates in the last two days. I would like to express my gratitude for the thoughtful and considerate service of Xiaohao and the butler Xiaoxin at the front desk.

In addition, I like the decoration style of this hotel. The lobby layout on the first floor is reasonable, leaving a lot of space for Resident guests, as a public area for rest, chat, and reading. The hotel service staff are very friendly, enthusiastic and warm. They can do their best to meet the needs of the guests. As soon as I walked in, I saw the customer service butler approached and offered tea, especially Mei Ting and Hao Hao. Moreover, our transportation is indispensable. The hotel is only a dozen minutes away from Hongqiao Airport, Shanghai Station and Metro Line 10, and it is also very convenient to take a taxi. In short, I am very satisfied with my staying experience. I will definitely choose to stay again or Recommend to friends.

I stayed for 2 nights this time, but it was too hot to change 2 rooms. I contacted Ctrip to check out in the middle of the night, really my wife hot! If you bring children, it will be very depressed! Then the toilet was dirty and the soundproofing was not good. There was always a voice from upstairs, asking the waiter to send the washing products for a long time and didn't even send it at the end! Asked to get ice cubes, and then the waiter brought a plastic bag to put it in, like buying vegetables on the street? Is this clean? The lobby is also decorated with a lot of dust, and the whole hotel is hot, which is terrible! Your hotel should be reorganized! There is no minimum standard of 5 stars! No difference from a hotel of 3/400! Selling 1300 is simply a scam! Who lives and knows! One to say one!

The room has poor sound insulation and can hear the sound of flushing water, which does not match the price of more than 1,500, and the experience is poor. After reading this one chosen by a lot of good reviews, in the future, everyone will still look at the bad reviews, which are more real.

2박 3일을 머물렀는데 1박 후 청소를 부탁하고 다시 돌아오니까 바닥에 머리카락도 가득하고 따로 모아둔 쓰레기도 버려지지 않았어서 눈에 띄는 부분만 치우는 것 같다는 생각이 들었어요.

2 早餐甚至無雜糧麪包，跟不要説歐包，法棍等，這也能理解。可是雞肉腸牛肉腸也是一沒。堅果也沒有。玉米涼的。但是有清蒸黃魚。

msg:酒店的優點和缺點都非常突出。

先説優點
1，價格適中、不貴，對得起北外灘的地理位置。
2，早餐雖然不豐富，但食物很符合中國人的口味。
3，免費的洗衣房。很多星級酒店沒有洗衣房，衹能叫洗衣服務，洗一件內褲的價格等於買條新內褲，很浪費。
4，馬桶內側有藍燈，晚上上廁所，不需要開衞生間的燈就可以看清楚馬桶在哪兒，藍燈不刺眼。
5，馬桶外側底部有一個按鍵，用腳輕輕的踢一下就可以沖馬桶，不需要彎腰去按。

再説缺點
1，房間隔音很差，隔壁看什麼節目，我都知道。
2，打掃衞生不及時。有一次我晚上回到酒店竟然發現房間還沒打掃。
3，酒店完全不提供洗衣服務，衹能自己去洗衣房。
4，房間裏沒有熨斗和熨衣架，洗衣房裡衹有懸掛式蒸汽熨斗，沒有熨衣架，衹能粗略的熨一熨特別明顯的褶皺，無法把襯衫和西褲的細節熨平整。
5，酒店門口有台階而無斜坡。不方便輪椅和不方便大件行李進出。
6，洗衣房的烘乾機，清潔嚴重不到位。我拍了幾張照片，顯示烘乾機裏面有多少積灰，太可怕。

總而言之，這家酒店主要適合家庭旅行，不適合商務旅客。

房間看着有點老舊，燈光偏暗。最主要，好像哪個房間空調出風口的噪音都很大（因為某些意外原因，連續換了三個房間）

前台告訴我，可以看到東方明珠塔的房間一共衹有四個。好吧，這個完全不重要。臨近路邊的房間，擔心靠近馬路會吵（居然不是雙層隔音玻璃）。另一側的房間結果更糟心，對面大樓的冷卻塔一整晚都在嗚嗚嗚。。。。

説回房間內部，附圖可見，枕頭底下這是什麼黑黑的，不知道，給我換個房間吧。浴室地漏下水特別慢（已經積水出來馬上要超過門檻石了）換個房間吧。還有一個小細節，這個酒店的拖鞋，穿久了，居然脱毛。。。爬上床的時候發現，毛毛被我帶上床了。對了對了，這空調，不知道開不開好，開了吹臉，不開又熱。這個浴室這個純透明對着卧室真的好嘛？如果是商務用途，豈不是很尷尬？莫非貴酒店衹有一個pao房的定位？

唯一正常的就是，外賣機器人送上樓。用機器人了，總算是沒有出錯的了。

總的來説，入住體驗“不錯”，下次真的不會再來。原本入住四天，立馬聯繫攜程改成一天了。

最後補一句，從2012年開始用攜程，我第一次認真評論一個酒店。明確已經進入本人黑名單了，感恩。

空調實在是太熱了，雖然有控制面板，但是沒什麼大用，衹要開着空調，室温永遠在上升中，設定温度是擺設。想開窗換氣，窗外樓下又是條排水溝，臭。
服務響應到是很快，地理位置也不錯，既精精緻又雅緻。就是室內的排風換氣功能看來需要更新了，室温失控。

There are all kinds of delicacies on Sichuan North Road, hot pot, Anhui cuisine, Yanbang cuisine, food stalls, small supermarkets, etc., and it takes about ten minutes to go to the North Bund. The hotel is small and exquisite. The lobby and guest rooms are very beautiful. As soon as you enter the door, the customer service Xiaoyu brings you a special fruit tea that is sour and sweet. It also helps you store your luggage. Besides, the guest room is very large and the bathroom is clean. It is a smart toilet and a mirror , especially the hot water is very good, the pillows are more comfortable, the sheets and quilts are made of good materials, and the quality of sleep is high. Compared with the same hotels in the Mainland, the room rate is still a little bit okay, maybe it will be more expensive in peak season.

入住兩天實際觀察，大堂無時無刻都有小朋友在大聲喊叫有人躺在大堂沙發上睡覺，大堂準備的古箏和頌缽原先應該是能讓客人能有放鬆的感覺，但是無人管理，放任小朋友胡亂敲擊，變成了騷擾所有經過大堂的人的噪音。
早上10點多離開房間，並亮起打掃燈號，下午3點半回到房間時，先發現燈號未熄，再發現房卡無法使用，回到前台才告知要重新過卡，進入房間發現房間仍未被打掃，再下樓告知前台，得到的回覆是可能沒有發現房間有亮起打掃燈號，離店前再次反應得到的回覆是：燈號不明顯，阿姨可能沒有發現，應該主動與前台告知需要打掃。
一晚原價兩千多元的房間，這樣服務質量實在讓人無法接受。

客服小姐姐小林服務很到位，酒店是按照5星級來的。距離上海繁華地帶都很近，外灘、南京路步行街1公里，城隍廟2公里。推薦，以後會推薦給家人朋友們。

中西式都很全，早餐竟然有紅燒肉這種大菜，水果也大氣，都是整個的，葡萄香蕉梨蘋果桃西瓜哈密瓜……
酒店大堂還有附近景點遊覽介紹，真的是很貼心了，尤其誇獎一下前台，忘記小哥名字了，看我們是2大2小，主動免費給我們升級了房間，68平也是夠大了，總之很滿意了
補充一點，離外白渡橋很近，不行幾分鐘就到了，非常方便。

msg:總結：細節、服務、品質、體驗都離五星級差遠了。性價比極低，不推薦！
優點：
房間面積可；
前台有幫安排對應房型的高層；
牆紙和中間弧形設計顯得特別；
有備一雙洗澡拖鞋且用塑料袋裝着；
房內椅子足夠，且各不相同；
夜裡有送一盤水果；
缺點：
設施細節顯得破舊，例如：浴巾架壞的，花灑生銹嚴重，花灑出水不舒服；
衞生不乾淨，浴室和洗手間小格子瓷磚縫隙有許多黴點；
使用習慣不到位，例如：浴巾放置處隱蔽且顯得不衞生，淋浴處狹小導致洗漱台地麪都是水；
酒店樓層低矮，可看到的景觀被一些高樓遮擋，夜景非常有限，衝著夜景去的，會覺得兩千價位就這性價比並不高；
酒店服務意識很一般，與大堂服務人員諮詢感受不到熱情和服務意識；
用餐區域非常小，我去的時候沒有位置用餐，需要在旁邊站着等別人吃完，也沒有服務人員會幫我找位置拼桌之類；因為劃分餐區面積有限，餐品種類更是少得可憐；

msg:酒店交通非常便利，好幾輛公交車直達，酒店設施完善，客服佳佳幫忙寄存行李，幫忙拿行李送上車，服務周到。但房間佈局合理，空調温度適宜，乾淨衞生，住得很舒服，完全沒有影響。酒店最大的亮點就是客服小敏，服務超級，超級好，住過很多更大牌的五星酒店沒有一家比得過她服務的，辦理住宿完成後主動幫忙搬行李送到房間，熱情介紹房間設施，我們有長者還送了歡迎水果，有求必應，第二天退房後又主動送到門口，下次再來

總的來説，酒店的服務質量和設施設備都非常不錯，入住體驗非常愉快。如果您需要在上海北外灘找一家性價比高、服務質量好的酒店，雅緻酒店是非常不錯的選擇。我會毫不猶豫地推薦它給我的朋友和同事們，同時也期待着我的下一次入住體驗。給客服小敏點個贊。

Заселили в 11-00 спасибо девочке на регистрации 🙏🏻 ребята так же подсказали локации для посещений ( написали на китайском для навигации ). 

100%. Локация 10/10 буквально 3 минуты пешком и мы на набережной вайтай -  на этом плюсы отеля закончились.

Телевизор не работает причем не только у нас но и у подруги в соседнем номере тоже. Вызвали мастера он возился но безуспешно. ТВ нужен был детям, мы прекрасно обошлись без него. Вода горячая шла рывками. Все принадлежности зубная щетка и прочее почему то лежали возле лифта )) с таким столкнулся в первый раз - позвонили на ресепшен сказали все есть смотрите внимательней, да есть ))) но возле лифта. Главный недостаток это очень очень холодно - кондиционер не работает горячим - сколько бы мы не ждали номер оставшаяся очень холодным. Пообещали дважды принести дуйку обогрев - но так и не принесли. 

Локация 10/10
Завтрак 2/10

msg:訂了外灘動人夜景房，總的體驗就是非常不值這個價，先不説夜景不咋地，這個地理位置是真不行，離地鐵站1km，旁邊是禁毒所，邊上還在施工，最動人的三件套被攔住了0.5件套…

設施：設施看得出來有維護了，算是中規中矩，其次房間標的70平，目測最多50，有些開關按鍵不太好使，電視也有點小毛病

衞生：全地毯房間，所以你懂的，地毯很臟，有各種奇怪的污漬，其他瓷磚牆壁的地方都還可以

環境：如上所述，正對面是個小樓，側面能看見2.5件套吧，且風景一般

服務：服務態度都蠻好的，但是也是沒有很熱情的幫你解決問題吧。

這些個都無所謂，這個酒店完全沒有達到我的預期，1300的價格我選擇去人廣住麗笙大酒店，雖然舊一點，但這一切都會有所改善吧？無論是位置，環境，服務…哎，不值，失望的都沒拍幾張照片，就這樣吧。
