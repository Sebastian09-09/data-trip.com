msg:The castle hot spring hotel with maple leaf as the theme is built on the mountain, with elegant environment, infinity pool, and outdoor hot spring. The hotel service staff has a good attitude and gives people a sense of home. The front desk and concierge service are very enthusiastic. The general manager is very kind. I feel honored to see me carrying a lot of things with my children. It is very warm and kind. The breakfast is also superb. It is definitely the first choice for private hot springs. It is also the ceiling in Benxi Hot Springs. It is a natural oxygen bar and is definitely the first choice for escaping the city. The hot spring water is very pure. After washing, the body is slippery. The buffet dinner is also good. The salmon freedom is realized. The lamb skewers are all freshly grilled meat. The fragrance is simply confused. The night is quiet. Sitting quietly by the pool in a daze, it is very relaxing. The bed is also very comfortable and soft, and I slept very well. The check-out speed is very fast. The front desk manager has been sent to the door. He smiled and said to us that you are welcome to come again next time. I will definitely come again when the maple leaves are red in autumn. After a long time of strategy, I finally chose the Xikang Yunshe Hotel with the highest praise. I am very satisfied ✌🏻 to put a satisfactory end to my journey.

msg:This castle hotel far away from the city did not disappoint me. The decoration style is very photogenic. You can smell the scent of the forest in the room. The lady at the front desk is very nice and attentive. You can tell at a glance that she has received professional training. From the guidance on the departure route, the use of room facilities, to the recommendation of surrounding scenic spots, I am extremely satisfied. Although the room is a bit expensive, I think it is worth the price.

msg:The environment is OK. After arriving, the front desk upgraded us to a villa with a private hot spring. The service was also very good, with a welcome fruit plate. However, the room was too high and felt a bit cold. Even with the Daikin air conditioner on, it still felt a bit cold. After all, we live in the mountains. Then, it might be the waiter's mistake. There were two bottles of shampoo in the room, but no conditioner. They were particularly unfriendly to ladies. The next day, the waiter helped arrange a late check-out, so we had time to swim in the infinity pool for a while. In short, the experience was very good and worthy of the price!

The hotel staff is very enthusiastic, from the security guy to the front desk clerk, everyone is smiling and very friendly, it really feels like home. What's particularly awesome is that the water, coffee, and drinks in the refrigerator in the room are all free 🆓.

msg:The room decoration is very good, the public hot spring is still under renovation, the hotel hardware facilities are good, but the surrounding area is relatively remote, a bit desolate, and it feels undeveloped. The restaurant is too small, and you have to wait for a table for breakfast. The hotel service staff has average ability, not very professional, and the division of labor is not clear. A group of people gather together to watch the fun and chat, which is quite different from luxury hotels. More training is needed.

We went to the main building to take a hot spring bath. Because we were guests, we also received a free fruit plate. The fruit plate was very fresh and we swept it all away. The surrounding environment was particularly great, and there were not many people. It was perfect for bringing children to play. The buffet breakfast was also good. I highly recommend it👍🏻

msg:Let's talk about the advantages first. The newly opened hotel has no problem with hygiene, all kinds of equipment are new, the rooms are super big, and the overall environment is very quiet. Let's talk about the disadvantages. There are too few public hot springs, one outdoor and three indoor small hot springs. I personally feel that the restaurant is really bad and expensive. And if you go on vacation for a quiet weekend, don't eat in the hotel restaurant, because every weekend the hotel invites people to sing in the restaurant for everyone, but it's really noisy for people like me who like quiet. And the food is served very slowly. The breakfast is good, but maybe because of the publicity that so many people come to stay and eat breakfast, the restaurant is too small to accommodate so many people and can only share tables.

msg:The hotel is in a very good location, halfway up the mountain, with nice views of the mountains opposite. It's very cold and windy in winter, but should be cool in summer. The downside is that there are not enough hot springs, which makes it a bit boring in winter. It should be more suitable for skiers. The mattress is too soft, which is not ideal. The upside is that the twin room has two 1.5-meter beds, which is better, suitable for a family room. The air conditioner is very good and is from Daikin. The breakfast is not worth 108, but other services are very good.

msg:I wanted to try to feel the hot spring in the snowy scenery on the weekend. I found a place in Benxi where you can soak in the water outdoors. There are very few places to soak in the water outdoors in winter. The decoration and service of high-quality hotels in the north are always flawed. I feel that they should invest a lot in decoration, but the design is still a combination of Chinese and Western styles and cannot be well integrated. In fact, the scenery is still very open and beautiful. The hotel's restaurant is a flaw. Whether it is the restaurant order or the buffet breakfast, it is unsatisfactory. It is hard to imagine that this is the meal provided by the hotel at this price. However, the hotel is located in a remote area and there is no other choice. It is recommended that you bring enough snacks or things you want to eat~

The service is very good, and the fruit plate in the room is very careful. The children especially like it. The outdoor hot spring pool looks good, but the weather was too cold and we didn't dare to go down. The only drawback is that the indoor pool is too small, and there are no water projects for children. It is suitable for adults to take a hot spring bath outdoors. The restaurant dishes are also delicious, and the chef is good! It feels more suitable to come here when the weather is warmer.

In particular, the room temperature is very humane. I can feel full of warmth when taking my children out in the cold winter. My favorite is the outdoor swimming pool. I swim in the mountains and look up at the sky. The stars are shining at night. How can I not feel cold? I just stand outside for a while and let my body temperature drop before entering the swimming pool. There is also a hot spring in our room. The children don’t want to come out at all. This hotel is another destination I want to visit Benxi.

周圍環境很不錯 空氣很好 
晚上的星空很清晰 就是很冷
到店後升級了別墅大床房 
有兩個私湯一個在室外一個在室內 
偏好過來泡湯的話很推薦別墅房型
主打一個來都來了！
無邊泳池也很漂亮 旁邊就是山脈
追求性價比的話正常房型也是不錯的選擇
住店的歡迎水果也很新鮮
不過因為地理位置問題附近沒有什麼24h的餐廳
建議酒店安裝一個自動販賣機
服務人員態度很好 住起來很舒適
滿意的旅程 推薦

11月6號 東北暴雪，遼瀋大地也是銀裝素裹。
經歷了口罩洗禮後的人們，不願再為浮躁與忙碌所左右，更想着沉靜下來，在平淡的日子裏品味悠閑的時光。

一想到舒服的泡在温泉池子裏，仰望着漫天的雪花..那叫個得勁兒！
話不多説，哥幾個説走就走。午後高速封了，走國道G304-經小市-過關門山-直奔湯溝。

攜程上一番劃過，看到了今年開業的“本溪觀山湖熙康雲舍健康度假酒店”。
預訂了標房，晚飯的時候趕到了酒店。
第一次入住，提出先看看房間，前台熱情的打開了各個房型，一番比較後調換了城堡山景温泉套房。
房間面積奢侈，再多的行李都能放下。走廊寬敞，視線通透。

晚上哥幾個遊過泳、泡過温泉，愜意的坐在沙發裏，小酌了幾杯。

晨起，城堡的後山有綿延的小路。沿着林場的小路前行，低窪處昨夜的雨雪已結成了冰面。
清新的空氣，湛藍的天空，久違的清爽。
返回途中遠望城堡，帶着北歐風格，簡約而不失奢華。

早上的陽光鋪滿了餐廳，暖色調的裝飾，更添初冬城堡的氛圍。
廚師準備了精緻的西式、中式早餐，咖啡飲品豐富。

從前台到餐廳，從迎賓到路過，城堡內大家都彬彬有禮，賓至如歸。
要出發了，行車坡道上，幾個小夥子剛好完成了除雪作業，乾乾淨淨的。

關門山不止有秋天的紅葉，四季都很美！這次又平添了一份滿意！

設施：設施完善 還有健身房 瑜伽館 茶室 但是我沒有太多運動細胞就參觀了一下😃
衞生：房間打掃的特別乾淨 因為帶着小朋友所以觀察的細緻 角角落落真的做到一塵不染 
環境：因為實在山林間的酒店 雖然是秋天 但是早上起來空氣也是非常清新 讓人感覺神清氣爽  
服務：進店後每個區域的工作人員都會有禮貌的問好 會耐心解答我提出的問題 沒有一點的不耐煩 因為帶的孩子辦理入住時和時服務人員還會貼心的問我是否需要小童用品 這一點真的很棒 
 真的是一次不錯的打卡體驗  期待下一次的入住 PS聽説下雪後酒店會更美 超級期待
