From the breakfast, to the tea time and fresh scones, and wrapping it up with amazing cocktails made by Rossin with a great view. The beds are so comfortable and the bathroom feels calming/spa like. I truly had a wonderful time with long time friends and could focus on our time together as the hospitality made us feel at home. The Dukes restaurant food was delicious as well! Had to rush out fast in the morning. and the concierge was so helpful getting me in a cab and telling the cab driver my next destination. Thank you for the wonderful experience Langham! We will be back!

The environment inside the hotel is ok but the most unpleasant thing is the air conditioning is very very very weak inside the room, it is so uncomfortable esp. when summer time. You should highly consider if it is suitable to choose this hotel as an accommodation especially during summer time.

msg:I recently had the pleasure of staying at an amazing hotel and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations. One of the highlights of my stay was the delicious breakfast. The hotel offered a wide variety of options, from fresh fruit to hot dishes, and everything was prepared to perfection. 

Another great feature of this hotel was the big outdoor swimming pool. My kids absolutely loved it! The pool was not only spacious, but it was also designed with children in mind, making it safe and enjoyable for kids of all ages. It was the perfect way for my family to cool off and have some fun in the sun.

One thing that stood out to me about this hotel was its cleanliness. The rooms were spotless, and the common areas were always well-maintained. It was clear that the hotel took great pride in providing a clean and comfortable environment for its guests.

Lastly, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the hotel allowed for late check-out. This meant that we could take our time in the morning and didn't have to rush to leave. It was a small gesture, but it made a big difference in our overall experience.

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. The good breakfast, kid-friendly swimming pool, cleanliness, and accommodating late check-out policy all contributed to a wonderful stay. I can't wait to visit again!

The hotel's architecture feels grand and luxurious, and the staff go over and above to make you feel welcome and cater to your every need. My favorite part of the hotel is their outdoor pool, which truly feels like an European-style oasis. I found it worth paying for a room with executive privileges, as the food, service and views from the executive lounge were truly amazing.

When we made the hotel reservation, we requested firm mattress. Afterwards, when we arrived to our room, we actually saw a wood board on the mattress which this is not we would like to have. As the time we figured out was almost 11PM and the manager actually showed us another room which we could switched to. Eventually we were able to stay at the same room with the assistance of manager and room keeper by removing the wood board and flip the mattress. We were highly satisfied with their problem solving, however, it would be more wonderful if service standards could be at the same level as other Langham hotels around the world.

“It’s not about just the location and its brand, but the warm welcome and great service. Hotel itself can’t make it memorable enough unless the engagement is there.”

“10 year anniversary - a pink car is written The Langham Shenzhen going around this busy modern Shenzhen City, a gentleman spoke in Cantonese, feels like in Guangdong already” - I chose Langham for stay-cation for a reason, because this video attracts me, it’s not only because of the fancy luxury five star hotel but it has a story behind. 

Overall the hotel is still in great condition after opening for 10 years. 
We had a pleasant stay here over the National Holiday. 

Special thanks to In Room Dining Manager Iris and Yif, Jake for the warm welcome and nice amenities, it definitely made our stay meaningful. Yif helped us for everything we need even he looked into small details, definitely it’s one of the highlights of our stay. Maggie from Perch bar, Robert from concierge. 
100% will book for another stay-cation soon.
By the way, the outdoor swimming pool is just perfect if you don’t want to travel far to the beach and enjoy the sun!

While the facilities and Duke's restaurant were superb, I would like to commend all the staff on their attentiveness and listening to my needs. Language was not a barrier as the staff spoke enough English to be helpful in any request.
I was able to organise a chauffeur to take me to Shekou port. He helped me with my luggage all the way to check in. I felt like a movie star!

msg:I stayed at the Langham Shenzhen for two nights. I chose the hotel because the hotel has a light, bright, classic feel to it. I was not disappointed, the hotel has a very nice blend of classic hotel style and modern convenience. The hotel was absolutely clean and well cared for; the entrance, lobbies, elevators, restaurants, pool and spa were wonderful. The hotel feels refreshing in a subdued manner- not like the overpowering sensation of scent one feels upon entering some of today's trendy hotels. The Langham is also not trying to be trendy, it's simply an exquisitely appointed comfort zone that provides guests a sumptuous, refreshing place to relax and enjoy themselves. The staff is utterly professional and helpful; there is no sense of pretentiousness, simply a sense of desire to provide the best service possible. 

Upon entering my room, the drapes opened and the television turned on to classical music. The room was stunningly appointed and very comfortable. I haven't slept so well in years- even while staying at some famous five-star hotels. I visited two of the hotels restaurants, but as this was a relaxing weekend staycation, I ordered room service the entire time. Again, the staff was beyond professional and helpful, they listened to me practice my Mandarin and tried to understand me, but they were always willing to speak English when I couldn't express my thoughts in Mandarin. The food was well presented and for the most part tasted good. Their eggs were a bit overcooked, but that is the only thing I can complain about. The spa was very clean and comfortable. It is not inexpensive, but I felt so cared for and so comfortable (even now- days later) that I plan to come back in the future. 

The Langham is a wonderful hotel to stay at. It exceeds in all the ways a hotel should- cleanliness, luxurious appointments, comfort and helpful, professional service. Why stay anywhere else? 4.7/5.0

Check-in at FD was quite average with the staff only speaking in Mandarin to my gf even though the booking was under my name and she also ruined the birthday decoration & cake surprise for her. English level should be improved, it’s a basic requirement I believe. 
Ordered IRD for breakfast, service impeccable with a staff very polite and professional, also got a cereal & yoghurt bowl even though we didn’t order it, so the special attention was very much appreciated! 
The outdoor swimming pool was a key criteria why we choose this hotel, and I must say, having visited a lot of outdoor pools both in GZ and SZ, this is one of the best, very clean and has little cabanas to lie down, very private.

msg:Every time I come to Shenzhen, I stay at Langham. It seems to be a kind of complex. I feel a bit like home. I stayed for a week last time and stayed for five nights and six days this time. Do you know why I still stay in a hotel that is a bit "old"? I think the most important experience is the service of all the hotel staff! Everything is so proactive, thoughtful, and kind without any expression, which makes people feel very comfortable. Take this time for example. It was quite far from the place where I was doing business, so I thought about changing hotels after staying for one night. As a result, the front desk staff thoughtfully helped me upgrade the room type. Then I met Mr. Yan Yingqiang, a waiter at the concierge depar**ent. Because the upgraded room type was not ideal, Mr. Yan Yingqiang had no complaints and took the initiative to help us contact the front desk to change the room again, so that we didn’t have to run around. After changing to the room, he also took the initiative to ask us if we needed to adjust the room temperature and send water~ I have stayed in many super five-star hotels. To be honest, such proactive services are really rare. I feel that I want to serve guests from the bottom of my heart. This kind of small experience often retains guests! So I decided to stay in the original room for the next few days! In fact, it is not only Yan Yingqiang, but other waiters are really good, such as Zhang Jie at the front desk, who is very relaxed and friendly (because I am not used to the humidity in the rainy season and feel unwell, Zhang Jie comforted me with high emotional intelligence and said that he is also like this, and it will be fine when the rain stops). Although it is just comfort, some homely chats will make guests feel relaxed. And the food at Tangge on the third floor is really amazing, okay? It is not inferior to Michelin restaurants at all! We go back and forth and eat every time! Breakfast is also very rich, and the products are very attentive. For example, the soy milk tastes really pure and rich. The Lanzhou ramen is very delicious and authentic. The ramen chef has been on the job for at least five years, right? We went there many years ago and were impressed, which shows that the hotel is also able to retain talents. 👍 In short, thank you for such careful and attentive service! I will stay in your hotel next time!

We also tried the in-room breakfast and Tang Ge dim sum. The breakfast was great and very considerate. It has a thermostat to keep it warm. The Tang Ge dim sum was exquisite and the service was attentive. The waiter helped us prepare some from time to time. However, the food tasted just ordinary and the Wagyu beef cake was not fragrant. Come on, the protein in almond tea is relatively old...

The service is courteous and attentive, but not excessive and will not bore the guests. They are also flexible and try their best to meet the guests' needs. The room and bathroom are very spacious, the overall interior design is consistent (consistent Langham style, even the fragrance), and the furniture and furnishings are a mixture of Chinese and British elegant styles. It is recommended to book a room with Club access. The Club floor has a quiet environment and the decorations are well thought out. Although the afternoon tea is average, the cocktail is more like a semi dinner buffet and is very cost-effective. The biggest disadvantages may be the average view from the room, the loud noise when flushing the toilet🙉, and the fact that it is a little far from the subway station (about 10 minutes away), so traveling is not very convenient, but it is okay. Still a very satisfying stay.

msg:This is probably my fifth time staying at The Langham. Objectively speaking, I am disappointed with the service. There are also good things. Let’s talk about the bad things first:

A few points: 1. First of all, I went to have breakfast. I felt very happy when I woke up in the morning. When I arrived at the restaurant, the waiter said that I couldn’t wear slippers. It was strange at the time. No other hotel required this, but just ask for it. Everyone obeyed, but I ran away. I went to the room to change my shoes and came back to find that someone was wearing slippers in the restaurant. I was immediately furious. You can look at the photo below. What does this mean? Double standards? I can only give 1 point for this service item.

2 After breakfast, I went swimming. I was very disappointed at three o'clock. First, the temperature in Shenzhen today was very low. There was no air conditioning in the place where I changed clothes. You can imagine how cold it was. Second, the two snail shower rooms were both broken. Then Ordinary shower rooms don’t have shower gel, hey.

3. Next is the swimming pool. Just a heads up. There are no lifeguards watching the whole process. I’m really worried. Just don’t get into trouble.

The phone number in room 4 is very strange. You have to press 0 to call the front desk service number, and there is no sign. How can ordinary people know it?


Let’s talk about the good points again,


1The overall facilities are pretty good

2. The breakfast has handmade Lanzhou noodles, which is very good.

No more, choose carefully next time. I don’t know what went wrong with the service. It’s completely different from the previous 4 experiences. Let’s make some rectifications.

msg:Many hotels have increased their prices during the Spring Festival, so I chose the Langham Donghai, which didn’t increase too much, to celebrate my birthday. We arrived at the hotel lobby after one o'clock. It was full of people, but there was no queue to check in. The front desk staff was busy but the service was pretty good. However, maybe there were too many people and too busy that day, so no roses were sent. After entering the room, I saw that it had been decorated, and there were also roses included in the package. Soon afterwards, Anne personally delivered cakes and sparkling wine. I especially praised Anne. She was very warm and kind.
I have seen many reviews saying that the Langham is very good, so I plan to stay in the hotel for three meals a day this time. Maybe because there were insufficient staff and too many tenants during the Spring Festival, the experience was really not good. I thought the afternoon tea was served in a complete set, but maybe it was too busy so it became a full buffet? The quality of dim sum is on par with usual. When I arrived for dinner at around 6:30, there was almost no room left. Too many people really affected the experience just like the canteen. Moreover, there were not enough people. When I found a seat to sit down, no one put the tableware and no one could be found. I was given a menu, and when I finally went to get the food, I caught a waiter who was not so busy and successfully ordered the food. It was okay to order pasta and a glass of sparkling cocktail, but I was not in the mood to sit slowly in the lounge. It's hell for me, I can't wait for a long time for the waiter to come. , because there were too many people, I couldn’t drink the Perrier-Jouët I wanted to try. The next day at around nine o'clock in the morning, I went to the second floor and found that there was a queue, so I went to Langham Restaurant. The variety was a bit limited, and there was no a la carte menu. I was told that Perrier and San Pellegrino were no longer available... but the lady behind me also helped. I got it. I originally planned to stay for two more days if the experience was good, but I decided not to. Overall, I quite like it, but I can only say that you shouldn't choose to come for a staycation at this time.

♣ Shenzhen is a very new city. I came to this city for the first time in 2000. At that time, I had to apply for a customs clearance permit to enter Shenzhen. It was the first time I felt how special the special zone was. Futian Middle Road in 2000 was our base camp. Every morning we walked to the company at a brisk pace. It felt like everyone was walking very fast, and anything that happened on the road would not slow down the pace of passers-by. The most impressive building every day - Diwang Building can be seen everywhere! Lianhua Mountain is a leisure place every night, and Nanshan, Dameisha, Shenzhen University and the library are weekend destinations. It's two o'clock every day, but after a long time it becomes boring. Occasionally, I go to the southernmost point of Futian District alone to see the small fishing villages in Hong Kong. However, fortunately, this period only lasted for one year, and I said goodbye with some memories of Shenzhen. After continuing my studies for two years, I chose Beijing after graduating from university. Compared with Shenzhen, in addition to the sunshine and beaches, air quality, and fast pace, I feel that Beijing is indeed a majestic, long-standing, and colorful imperial capital. It has been more than 20 years since I entered Beijing, and this is the first time I have brought my children back to Shenzhen. Diwang Building is no longer the top spot 20 years ago, and the streets are as clean and tidy as ever. Unexpectedly, the company where I was doing my internship was right next to the famous Huaqiangbei! In order to spend more time in the city, I chose the Langham Hotel. In time for the Chinese New Year, the guest room also gave me a small gift. Especially the little Paddington Bear, the child loved it so much that he hugged it to sleep every day. The indoor swimming pool is also very good. Although it is smaller, there are not many people. The sauna room in the men's locker room is very complete, so you can have a good experience after swimming. The outdoor swimming pool is also very nice, but the water temperature is too cold🥶, but foreigners are really awesome! The breakfast is very rich and has all kinds of food. There is also an exclusive parking lot, which is free. The only regret is that the hot water at night is not enough? I could only wait until the morning and wash it again. I hope I won’t run into it next time I have the chance to go there. The service staff of the hotel are still very good, and you can feel the sincere trea**ent of others - no matter how good the facilities and environment are, it is not as good as the good service attitude! ! ! The two-day trip to Shenzhen is over. In addition to the memories of the past, the experience of the Langham Hotel is also worth recalling: the setting sun leans against the west building alone, and the distant mountains are just opposite the curtain hook. The human face is unknown, but the green wave is still flowing eastward - see you later!

Complete facilities, big nozzles, I like the smell of the hotel's shower gel and shampoo, the open-air and indoor swimming pools are clean, and the scenery is good
It is very close to the subway station and is convenient for travel. The overall environment is British + Chinese style. The milky white wood tone is very comfortable. The breakfast is rich and varied, with Chinese and Western flavors to choose from. On the morning of the third day of junior high school, I happened to meet a foreign chef cooking. The service is also very attentive and attentive. Looking forward to staying here next time.

Except for the front door, which was not as grand as expected, I was very satisfied with the internal environment, service, and cleanliness. As for the price, it is very cost-effective during the Chinese New Year. The quality of the breakfast is very high. Although the single variety is not rich enough, the quality is very good.
The free bottled water is very generous. There are about 10 bottles everywhere in the room. Free snacks, chocolates and roses upon check-in.
The services from concierge to cleaning to front desk and restaurant are all very polite and courteous!
The transportation is also very convenient, it is only a 7-8 minute walk from Chegongmiao Station. Next to it is Donghai Colorful City, with green flowers and paperstones.

The hotel's heated swimming pool is also very friendly, with a temperature of 29.5°C.

Let's try breakfast this time. 220 yuan per person. The price is similar to the Langham in Shanghai. The Westin in Nanshan District where I stayed a few days ago was 110 yuan. The breakfast at Langham in Shanghai was really good, so I was looking forward to it a lot, but the Westin at half the price was almost nothing special. Still no salmon for 220 yuan. Other dishes were average. Fortunately, the ingredients are very fresh. Also, it’s not time to check out yet. One card cannot be used at 10 o’clock in the morning, and the other card cannot be used at 11 o’clock. Don't know why. But everything else is very satisfactory. If the breakfast standard is improved, I will definitely not be dissatisfied with the stay.

I came to stay for a few days because I read so many good reviews.
The public area is okay, very British style, but the room is really too old, the carpet smells very, very damp, the furniture looks like the props in an escape room, there is no texture, the sound insulation of the room is also very poor, the double bed is used There were two single beds pushed together, with a dent in the middle, and the mattress was uncomfortable. I couldn't get a good rest in the past few days. Another incident is that razors are very dangerous. I broke my mouth for two days in a row. The bleeding couldn't stop on the first day. I tried to be more careful on the second day, but it still broke. It's rare in other hotels. See.
Service is ok. The location is okay.
Still too old.

We called housekeeping several times a night to replenish room supplies, such as: children's slippers, toiletries, quilts, towels, and pillows (because every time we called, we forgot to check the room. We had to agree on the required items, so we divided them several times), but the housekeeping staff didn’t find us troublesome and greeted us with a smile. The decoration design of the hotel and rooms has a little bit of European and British style, which fits the Chris**as a**osphere very well. I stayed on the executive floor this time. I think the lounge on the executive floor doesn’t have many food and beverage choices and could be improved. Also, the countertop cabinets displaying food and beverages feel more like a boutique store, making it difficult to display food and beverages. The service in the Chinese restaurant is in place and the food is of high quality.

The best thing is that this is a "very friendly" hotel for ladies. You get a rose as a gift when you check in. I kept a rose very well. It matches the retro British style room very well. It is the icing on the cake. There is a sand curtain to prevent light leakage by the window of the breakfast hall on the second floor, which is considerate! The room comes with free afternoon tea.
 The decoration style seems to change slightly on each floor. Anyway, the floor we stayed in is European-style retro, and the taste is very good. No odor.
Breakfast is rich. tasty
Service: 10 points, the service in every aspect is very good.
The location is great. There is a ten-acre food city not far away. The hotel is connected to a shopping mall. It is not big but has a wide range of exquisite things. There is a floor for food, which is very convenient.
Comfortable, clean and quiet.
Will come back!

On this basis, the first solution given was not to refund the money, but to "upgrade the room type next time." If you take money that does not belong to you, you must return it. It is unimaginable that such a big brand would test the legal edge because of a small deposit. The whole incident is shocking, dirty and funny. Not to mention that the sighs and eye rolls accompanying the front desk service when checking in for the second time are something I have never seen from hotel practitioners.

In addition, I would like to praise Langting's service. The concierge is very good at sending and receiving express delivery. It is also one of the few hotels in Shenzhen that I have seen that has not started to use takeaway cabinets and robots. I personally prefer this kind of human touch.

It is difficult to understand why the waiter throws away the guests' personal belongings, and this is not the first time that the waiter throws things away at Langham. Room training really needs to be strengthened.

msg:The hotel service is very good, the Paddington-themed room is decorated, and it also includes executive benefits - it turned out that it included 3 meals (afternoon tea, evening cocktail and breakfast), and after check-in, there was a welcome gift (Paddington bear theme) and a birthday cake.
The room itself includes two executive privileges. You can bring a 6-year-old child to enjoy it for free, and add an extra breakfast fee of $186 for the elder brother. Then we will have three meals for the four of us and we will eat and drink until we are full.
The facilities in the swimming pool and changing room are good. I appreciate most that there is a small centrifugal clothes dryer in the changing room to remove most of the water from the swimsuit, and the luggage is much lighter. Slippers, sauna, steaming, towels, warm water, and cold water are all complete, and the service is good. The outdoor swimming pool lifeguards are very responsible for watching the situation in the pool, and there are two more when there are many people. But there seemed to be no lifeguards indoors.
The facilities in the room are good, including capsule coffee, tea, and small chocolates. But there will be a musty smell when entering the room, and it will disappear after a while. The small bathtub in the bathroom is very fun, and the two children are spinning around in it, full of fun.
The fly in the oin**ent is that I booked this Paddington bear themed room in anticipation of a large number of themed peripherals, thinking it was an immersive Paddington experience. However, it may be that the immersion of Paddington bear is missing because of the executive courtesy meal. Anyway, this staycation is also a very good experience. Both adults and children enjoyed a relaxing and enjoyable weekend. Good work!

msg:My family actually lives in OCT, which is very close to the East China Sea. Occasionally, I would like to change places to live on weekends. I have probably booked the Langham no less than ten times. I have booked deluxe rooms, executive rooms, and executive suites. I booked the Langham again temporarily yesterday. I booked a deluxe room, but I was given a room type in another direction, which I have never lived in before; they have always given me a room near Shennan Avenue, so I suddenly lived in another direction, and the room The configuration is completely different (frankly speaking, the room on this side is dark as soon as you enter the door, you can't find the light, and the smell is heavy, I thought I came to the warehouse where the broken furniture was placed) I called the front desk to change the room, and they told me I booked The room type is the same as the configuration of the room; Later, a lady came and explained to me that I had booked an executive room before, so it was different. I explained to her that I had never lived in such a room even if I booked a deluxe room. The lady asked me to give her my past reservation records on Ctrip to prove that I have booked a deluxe room, but now if I want to live in the room on the side of Shennan Avenue, I have to make up the price difference. I really don’t understand what was given to me before. The gap between the room and the room I got this time is so big... Then Peter Zhang, the manager on duty, came and said as soon as the door opened that I heard from my colleagues that you asked for a free upgrade to the executive room (I didn't want to upgrade for free , because I have always lived in the room type on the other side, even if I book the so-called deluxe room); Upgrading... So, are all the deluxe rooms I booked before being upgraded for free? ? ? Anyway, I did change rooms when I brought two young children. This time, I am very grateful to him for "upgrading me for free for the last time". Maybe we don't deserve to live in this hotel + the way I dealt with this time made me actually stay. It's very uncomfortable...; the so-called real luxury room has mottled furniture at the door, the table is full of bump marks, and the chairs in the room are all yellow and shedding... It's just a warehouse for unwanted furniture place... The original favor towards Langham disappeared...

msg:I came to Shenzhen for business, so I booked this hotel which was relatively close to my business location.
First of all, it is understandable that the hotel facilities are relatively old, but there is a strong smell of moisture as soon as you enter the room. I won’t comment on other facilities in the room. The only thing I want to talk about is the hair dryer. It was very old and difficult to use. I was really speechless when I opened the bag and saw the hair dryer.
Secondly, the welcome message on the TV after checking in the guest room was wrong. It was only after I came back from dinner in the evening that I saw it changed to the correct one.
The breakfast tastes very average and the variety is okay.
The service was average. The only good thing was that I called room service twice and it came very quickly.
If I had known this, I might as well have stayed at the nearby Atour store at a similar price, at least it was new enough.

Make me a coffee lover very happy. The mineral water in the room is also adequate. Most importantly the bed was very comfortable and gave me a good night's rest.
There are a few suggestions: The toilet board switch is too loud: the hair dryer has to be pressed all the time to get the air, and it blows to the back so that my fingers can't stand it. The room smelled a little when I entered it, I can't tell, it might be musty.
Enjoy Langham club privileges (administrative privileges): I went to experience the afternoon tea, but several of the food were taken away. Didn't see it replenished in time. The landscape is superb.

🌟The security service is too poor:
But I really want to complain about the security brother on the first floor of the hotel. Do you have to serve the guests staying in the hotel first when you wear this clothes? I forget that you have a bad attitude and don’t talk at the door, but why are you so nice to the driver who drives the nanny car with a Hong Kong license plate? They can park in the hotel lobby on the first floor for a long time. Did they give you money privately?
I stayed in the hotel for 3 days. I occasionally went upstairs to get something. I parked for less than 5 minutes, and you complained! Why can these drivers park their cars on the first floor for a long time for their convenience, while hotel guests who stay for a short time are driven away and forced to park in the basement? The hotel gives you the right to treat guests like this?
It’s really a bit *****. Brother, it’s not only the nanny car that is valuable. I hate people who treat them differently the most. What’s wrong with Hong Kong people and mainlanders? Aren’t you from the mainland of the motherland? I can’t stay in the hotel with a Shenzhen license plate? When I stay in the hotel, I have the right to choose a parking place that is convenient for me. Non-hotel vehicles can park, but hotel guests cannot park? What a rubbish service!

Tang Court Chinese Restaurant at Langham Hotel, Shenzhen
From the moment you enter the restaurant, you can see the beauty of the Tang Dynasty, with the antique tea table at the door and the Tang Dynasty tri-color pottery at the back.
From the pre-meal tea, the tableware for the meal, to the refreshing cold brew white tea in the middle, the words "food and utensils" are very appropriate here.

msg:There are many advantages:
1. The service staff of the whole hotel, including the front desk, the restaurant, and the housekeeping service attitude are very good, which is the best

2. The breakfast buffet has a lot of delicious food to choose from, and the attitude of the service staff is very good. My Valentine's Day is celebrated with a buffet in the same restaurant. The price/performance ratio is super high, and it is definitely beyond the value for money. Special thanks to Maria for helping me arrange the dining table And the room, help me book the bouquet, etc., give us an unforgettable night

3. The room facilities are very tidy, the water power of the shower is sufficient and the hot water is delivered quickly, which is relatively rare in terms of the quality of hotels in the mainland

shortcoming :
1. The location of the hotel is troublesome, because it is located in the middle of 3 subway stations, and it takes about 15 minutes to walk. However, there is a big shopping mall next to it. There are restaurants in the shopping mall and Emperor Cinema, so basically it doesn’t matter if you live far away

2. The TV model in the room is relatively old, and there is no Internet access, so if you want to use the TV to watch pre-downloaded movies on your mobile phone, you must bring your own connection cable, and the hotel does not have to borrow it

Everything is so pink and tender
Without losing the precipitation and rhyme of an old British hotel
no compliment
Even the lawn mowing at the door and the notepad in the corner
Both have a sense of design and structure, revealing the exquisiteness of old money
Gorgeous without being ostentatious
So is the Palm court
Quiet a**osphere with the French window falling ☀️
Fine tableware and floral arrangements

msg:After struggling with Jinmao jw for a long time, I finally chose this hotel, which proved to be the most correct choice for this trip! Basically, these two days are activities within half an hour's drive from the hotel. Ten acres of land is not far away, and it is only 10 minutes away from my friend's house. The hotel is also connected to the colorful world of the East China Sea. There are all kinds of catering and afternoon tea, and Didi Taxi is right at the gate. In short, it is very convenient in all aspects.

I am very happy that the front desk upgraded my room type. But the point is! I like the style of this hotel very much. It is the European style retro old money style, which has a lot of charm. Compared with the various modern decorations now, I still prefer this style. However, the most worrying thing before I went there was the problem of being too old. However, after I went there, I found that the smell in the room was not very good (I hope the hotel can pay attention to the fragrance of the hotel. I think the smell of a hotel can be left to the guests. My next impression) Besides the smart toilet, other places are still well maintained. The decoration style really won my heart, so I couldn't help but take a lot of photos. And there is a coffee machine that delights! The various details in the room are still very good, making me want to stay a few more nights. (It’s a little regretful that I went to experience another hotel on the second night, and Langting is better🥹)
However, I found that the sound insulation seems average. This seems to be a room in a suite? Because there is also a locked door. That night I could hear the snoring next door clearly, hey, but forget it, what I said earlier can make me ignore this problem.

The next day, I went to the hotel for afternoon tea. The scones were really delicious, but the spa coupons I gave were better than the afternoon tea discount.

Looking forward to going again next time~

1. Is it too much for the toilet seat in the bathroom to not even be lowered slowly? No matter how cheap the domestic toilet seat is, it is equipped with a slow drop, so you must handle it with care... otherwise it will be deafening
2. Can you take the initiative to send children’s slippers and children’s toothbrush when you are staying with children? You don’t have to call the customer

There are also all kinds of thoughtful things in the room, even so many kinds of pillows!

Two places need feedback and hope the hotel can improve:
1. The water in the bathtub is too cold. After boiling seven or eight pots with boiling water, it was still only warm. It is definitely not enough to take a bath.
2. The meaning of the welcome letter is different in Chinese and English. The Chinese is free wireless and wired Internet access, and the English is use of a laptop, so we called the customer service center, and the customer service center replied that there is no laptop...

When I came back from dinner, the bed was already set up, and by the way, I used the water bottle I finished drinking to soak the flowers. The room was clean and comfortable, and the high bed was my favorite.
Everyone I met was very polite, especially when the little security guard saw us when we first entered the hotel from the parking lot, he got up immediately until we entered the elevator. The first impression was full of details.
The breakfast has European, Japanese, and Chinese styles, which is pretty good, and the replenishment is timely. Downstairs is the colorful East China Sea. Shopping and eating are very convenient. The price/performance ratio is great.

The British style decoration is still very characteristic.

The room that was arranged at the beginning had some smell, and it was changed after explaining to the front desk.

Tang Court eats it in Hong Kong, and I also tried it when I came here. It is a little expensive, but it is delicious.

In addition, I didn't know in advance whether my daughter could come to Shenyang, so I chose a suite because I thought I could add an extra bed. The suite is really good, you can see the Shenzhen Bay Bridge, and the price/performance ratio is also 👌. (Three large wardrobes are enough for the three of us to spread out separately), but the daughter arrived in the early morning of the next day, only to find out that the children's bed was added. The bed fee, it is said that she can enjoy the executive courtesy, but she has no time, so I feel that the extra bed fee is a bit unfair (it is reasonable that the children's bed should not be charged separately)

msg:Originally booked Mandarin Oriental, but was attracted by the reviews of Xiaohongshu. On the first day of the Spring Festival holiday, I chose Langting to stay and booked an executive twin bed. I originally planned to stay comfortably and then continue my stay, but I decided to change hotels that night. There are reasons, 1. When I checked in, it said that I booked the executive trea**ent provided by the deluxe room. It was obviously bought with real money, so I don't want to squeeze this wool. After confirming by phone at the front desk, it was agreed that it was an administrative double. The total floor height is 22 floors, give me the 8th floor, I can understand that there are many people during the Spring Festival, but I think the administration on the 8th floor is a bit low. 2. There are children’s room layouts on the platform. Although there was no relevant room type when I booked that day, I asked casually if the layout could be better. The result was that it could be done, but I said no, I said yes, I said no. When I got to the room, I said to wait, but said no. Don't worry, I still understand that there are many people during the Spring Festival, but this repeated calls and back and forth calls reflect that there is a problem with internal management communication. So tired. 3. It’s normal to not be able to remember the guest’s last name on the phone. Just say hello. Calling the wrong last name twice makes me feel very aggrieved. 4. The sound insulation in the room is poor. The toilet is old-fashioned. It would be much better to add a rubber pad, but the sound of hard plastic touching the hard plastic switch is very loud. ***** "The most important thing" is ***** at 9:00 p.m. to add a quilt, but it was not delivered until ten o'clock, and it was delivered after another reminder. Well, just sleep after a busy day, it doesn't matter if the sound insulation is not good. It was almost one o'clock in the morning in a daze, and the service staff rang the doorbell frantically, and the baby cried in fright. The door opened and said that it was to deliver the quilt. I……………. Although Langting will have extra points, but the management is really problematic. i have a hard time sleeping

msg:The Langham, East China Sea is located on Shennan Avenue, Shenzhen, with convenient transportation. There is a subway station not far from the door, and the buffet is also super delicious. Most of the hotels in this hotel are handsome little brothers, even the cleaning ones are the little brothers, and they give me the impression that they are sunny and enthusiastic, with smiles at all times. On the day of check-in, the little brother who helped me with the luggage was warm and thoughtful throughout the whole process and helped me connect to the wifi. I said that I don’t bring any cash anymore, he hurriedly smiled and said, it’s okay. The next day, because the nucleic acid test report when I left the Shenzhen high-speed rail station was not displayed in the itinerary code, I was a little worried, for fear that the code would turn yellow after the expiration date, so I decided to do the nucleic acid test again after a telephone consultation. When I came to the lobby, I met Chen Weiping, the foreman of the day, and asked how to get to the nucleic acid point. It was already night, and he estimated that it was difficult for me to find it. He immediately said that I would take you there. Then he accompanied me through two traffic lights and passed through. It's a small square, and he accompanied me to scan the code and line up for nucleic acid testing, and finally accompany me back to the hotel~ Oh my God, as a tourist who is not familiar with life, I was really moved to cry. The service culture of the hotel is touched, and I have a good impression of Shenzhen. Next time I come to the Langham, I will choose Donghai Langham. Five-star recommends everyone to stay!

When I was notified later that it could be delivered, not only did it not arrive for half a day, but I started knocking on the door to collect the laundry after a while. . .
The duty manager acknowledged that the hotel has its own process. But can't the process be changed according to the customer's request? Is it difficult for a hotel to knock on the door after two o'clock?

msg:The guests were dissatisfied, the water leaked on the first night of their stay, and the floor was covered with water. The next day they called for trea**ent, but the trea**ent was not timely. They had finished swimming and were going to go back to the room to take a bath. As soon as I entered the door, it is not that I did not wash when I got a guest to take a shower. This hotel is also in a better location, with full facilities. The executive double room with nearly 1,500 beds a night is small and old. If you choose, the service should be online at least, and the result is not ideal. Lots of other hotels to choose from, the Langham will not be back.

🧹Hygiene: I am very satisfied with the rest of my stay this time, but there is ash in the bathtub, an obvious layer of small black ash particles. I put it in the first time and rinsed it with a bath towel, and then I put it in the second time. water.

Facilities: The hotel has everything that the hotel should have. The capsule coffee machine is used, and there are a lot of capsule coffee and tea bags. But: 1. I can't connect to the hotel's Wi-Fi, so I can't pop up the login page; 2. The light switch control is a little old, the bedside light doesn't respond when I press it once, and I can't see it in the dark environment , inconvenient to press.

msg:Langham Hotel is a British style that I like very much. From the doorman, front desk to the Langham Club staff, they are all professional and enthusiastic.
I arrived at the hotel very early in the morning because I changed shops in the same city. The lady at the front desk was very friendly and helped me arrange the room in advance.
The 20th floor has a wide view, and the floor-to-ceiling bay windows on one wall are very suitable for viewing. In the evening, I saw the Shennan Avenue that was in the early hours of the lights. In the morning, I admired the colorful clouds in the morning light. It is an unforgettable experience.
The interior design of the room is also very good. Separate dry and wet, with bathtub and shower.
What I like most is the walk-in cloakroom, which is very convenient for organizing and changing clothes.
The hotel’s breakfast is very rich, with a combination of Chinese and Western styles. There are many choices, and I even ate the hand-pulled beef ramen, and all kinds of desserts are also very special.
Stay in the executive room and get free afternoon tea for two and evening cocktail hour. After experiencing the afternoon tea, the Langham Club on the 22nd floor has a good environment. The afternoon tea refreshments are inferior to the breakfast desserts, but it is still okay to sit and chat with friends for two hours😊.
The location of the hotel is very good, it is very close to the highway junction, and it is very convenient to go to the airport; especially, the second floor has direct access to the colorful world of the East China Sea, and it is very friendly to stroll and eat inside.
In short, I was very satisfied with the experience of exploring the shop. Next time I go to the hotel of choice in Shenzhen.

What impressed me the most about this business trip was when I was at the front desk, Miss Chen Yanfang received me. I was very adaptable. At that time, I was anxious to go to a meeting. I picked up my luggage and asked the waiter to send it back to the room. He handed me water to quench my thirst, so that I could come back and have enough time to check in.

🔔Service: Whether it is the Langham Club or the front desk, the staff at each position has impressive service. They are very kind and sincerely like to communicate with guests. It coincides with Mr.’s birthday that the guest room has arranged simple decorations and small cakes in advance. I am very happy. .

🍮Food: The afternoon tea/cold dishes at the Langham Club is a bit disappointing. I feel that the food has been placed for a certain period of time, but the happyhour drinks are quite good and the champagne is great! The breakfast is very rich, and the handmade noodles (dan dan noodles) stalls are delicious.

msg:Due to frequent business trips to Shenzhen recently, I have stayed in almost every five-star hotel on Shennan Avenue. The Langham is the only one worthy of review, because of its characteristics, it is especially suitable for women.
First of all, the British feeling is very moving. Whether it is the small surprise of sending a rose to the woman during check-in, or the decorative wall painting in the corridor, it is in line with the elegant positioning.
Secondly, hygiene is up to standard, because I almost never use the hotel bathtub to soak, but I have soaked for 3 nights in a row. Besides, I will use the hotel coffee machine when I travel in Europe. Can make tea and drink.
The only regret is that there are usually upgrades or free drinks and fruits in the previous stays. The Langham did not. Later, I continued to stay for 2 nights and still did not. Maybe the British conservative still needs to stay a few more times to get acquainted with it😃

When I actually checked in, I found that there was a big pillar in the room, and it was very difficult to walk around.
The phone is out of battery at night and needs a charging cable

定的是行政房，在行政樓層的Happy hour非常的好，他們會有一個立式的大立櫃，然後一到時間一打開就是一個有着各種豐富的酒水的Bar,感覺非常的有特色可以讓人自己DIY.入住的時候有個小小的插曲因為定的房間和我在網上的照片有一些不一致。然後我就聯繫了酒店説出了我的疑問，然後一會值班經理非常的負責和貼心的馬上給我回電了，細心的解決了我的疑惑，因為當天有團隊入住然後值班經理還為我換了一個房間，然後還給我升級了。其實我挺過意不去的，因為我就是一個直來直往的人我衹是説出了我的感覺並不是説我去找什麼問題非要要求給我升級或者怎麼樣。然後我和值班經理也是這樣説的。但是人家説：請我不要誤會，他們也當然沒有這樣去想過我，衹是希望能讓我有個好的體驗才這樣去做。所以我非常感謝他們的細緻和為顧客着想的心。衹是時間久了現在才有時間寫點評所以忘記了這位值班經理的名字。不好意思了。總之非常感謝他的處理方式也讓我很安心和滿意。在店期間去過中餐廳和酒吧，都是不錯的，中餐廳的粵菜非常的好上茶上湯上菜的方式節奏把握的非常的好，給我服務的一個訓練有素的姐姐人很好，感覺她很專業對粵菜很瞭解為我介紹菜品推薦的也很好。我還選了一杯白葡萄酒配餐也不錯。酒吧晚上有駐唱，還有一個外場，外場很舒適。適合把酒言歡。

吹風機也很古舊，是需要手摁着才能啟動的，堪比七天如家的體驗，想把短髮吹乾虎口都發痛發麻，體驗感非常不好，非常失望。
酒店桑拿房沒有計時鐘。
外賣等衹能送到禮賓，且前台不能轉交，需要自己穿着睡衣拖鞋穿過整個大堂拿外賣，體驗了一把事必躬親。甚至不如普通的經濟型酒店啟用智能機器人送外賣。
整體裝修都很古舊，客房內尤其是創頭控制面板的按鍵非常不靈敏，半夜睡覺起床真的抓狂。
還有牀頭櫃的插座正前方擺了倆超沉的瓷花瓶燈，真的是天才設計，要用充電口得繞過沉重的花瓶才能插電，我真是拜託你們經理自己住一晚你們佈置的客房吧，你吹頭充電睡覺感受一條龍的不便。
以及辦公桌的那個凳子真的是我坐過最難受的椅子，非常窄小，坐着不斷往下滑，跟90年代歌廳淘汰下來的二手貨似的。
服務態度是好的，體驗是差勁的。

總體感覺：是塔樓型酒店，比較商務，度假感比較弱。窗户不能打開。服務意識非常好，很正規，類比同價位北方的五星級酒店，體驗天差地別。一天內打掃兩回，住到第三天給換了床品。之前住其他家，要求換床品都被拒絕。
設施：酒店有些年頭了，但是維護的很好很乾凈，看不出陳舊。早餐廳略小，種類少。室內游泳池很小，衹有一個池子，勝在人不多，水温不涼。房間內插線孔很少，充電不方便。
位置：福田市中心，不過距離地鐵口要10分鐘，所以都是打車出行，打車去主要公園什麼的也要20分鐘。到機場半小時。

msg:整體感受是缺點遠遠多於優點，下次不會再選擇入住該品牌旗下的任何酒店。

先説優點。地理位置確實好，可以看到海。除此之外，酒店行政酒廊的甜品做的還不錯，但也遠未到令人驚艷的水平。

再説缺點: 最大的不足是服務整體比較垃圾。我一直認為酒店的核心價值是服務，也就是讓顧客住的舒心，但是很不幸我在該酒店的經歷卻令我十分窩心。因為退房當天需要遠程工作到晚上，所以我向酒店提出，能否在退房那天享受酒廊待遇，入住當日不享受。作為凱悦環球客和希爾頓鑽卡會員，我住過的所有酒店都是可以享受兩天的行政酒廊待遇，這對出差狗來説十分重要。與之相比，我這次提出的把第一天待遇平移到第二天這種事情實在是雞毛蒜皮。但是沒想到前台為了這件小事和我argue了好長時間（將近20分鐘），打了幾個電話申請才勉為其難批准，最後還不忘提醒我下不為例。我當時十分惱火。平心而論，這個請求一點也不過分，衹不過把時間段a平移到時間段b，對酒店沒有任何額外損失。就是在這點小事上都要斤斤計較，更別説其態度之冷漠，實在是我住過的五星級酒店裡罕見的。

除此之外還有很多缺點，諸如酒店設施老舊有黴味，燈光和開關之間甚至有延遲。除了甜點之外，酒廊裏的食品也不敢恭維。有人吹在該酒店酒廊可以點餐，實際上就是人太少了怕浪費而已。

員工熱情有愛，態度專業，了解客戶需要無微不至。
特別是Anna 小蔣 由我們的步入酒店到退房的遇見都十分體貼詢問我們的要求。

房間報置一流，每次回房也有小驚喜。
各員工服務態度很好，小兒普通話不太靈光，但這裡會粵語的員工也很多。 
行政lounge 環境一流 基本上可自由出入。
親子遊樂房間也 很好，設備玩具很新。
一家人都流連忘返，下次的旅程還要再來。

因為送了水療額度，還用了一下他們的川spa，入住以後預約了當晚。理療師Apple按得非常好！！！平時工作壓力很大，按完久違地好好睡了一覺。而且裏面spa設施也很齊全，汗蒸泳池浴衣梳粧台都弄得很乾凈，也不吃時間按滿90分鐘，價格和外面也差不多，真的物超所值。

其他就是地理位置挺好的，附近有很多xhs推薦的小吃，離高鐵站衹有一站路。

燈光系統真的難用，設施也有些陳舊（要是所有的東西都新新的，肯定就沒那種温馨的感覺）

服務細節上仍需提升，在開啟了請勿打擾的情況下 客房服務員敲門並還是直接開門進來了，然後有一晚開夜床居然衹開了一側😂

這次住了70多平方的房間，在樓層的盡頭。要吐槽下浴室，浴室很大，有個圓形的雙人浴缸，旁邊有淋浴間。如果要用浴缸的花灑，水就會漏一地；而淋浴間是沒有門的，也沒有浴簾，正常洗個澡，浴缸旁邊就全濕了。洗個澡必須戰戰兢兢不能滑倒，洗完還得擦地，不然孩子跑來跑去就完蛋了。房間燈的開關也是很難用的，全屋三個總開關，一按就全黑了，再按是無法重開的，必須走到那個燈旁邊打開。我在洗手間吹頭髮，孩子在外面一按總開關，就衹能摸黑穿過寬敞豪華的浴室走出去對付了，還好我老公這次來了，我一個人的話真的要崩潰的。另外這次買的帕丁頓熊套餐，主題床品拖鞋浴袍甜品繪本帳篷一應俱全，還送一精緻的熊。可是，孩子刷牙是要去浴缸那裡刷的，因為沒有提供腳凳去夠洗手盆。小童枕頭和被子也沒有提供，孩子一晚上踢大被子，我其實沒怎麼睡，半夜讓老公找服務員送了大浴巾對付一下。

希望酒店團隊改善設施，也增加服務親子客人的經驗。回頭再去找你們哈！

其他方便整體還不錯，還是推薦入住的。

msg:除了房間內部設施差強人意其他都很棒。簡單説就是臉面做的很好，特別是吃飯和大堂的環境很好。相比較而言休息的房間，也就是內部，差點意思。
設施有壞的，雖然維修及時。內部裝修的檔次也較外部差些。
另，個人遇到一個問題很不爽。第二天早上想續住，因週末有活動接待無房了。之前並沒有任何問詢及通知。
我可以接受被通知無房續住。而不是想續住才發現沒機會了。這矯情一點就是被“請”出去和被“趕”出去的區別。
不想因此抹殺其他服務人員的服務。但個人覺得這樣很不應該。這應該是經理級以上負責人的問題！你當住客都是**還是都素質很低？碰上素質低的你這樣做確定能好了？

服務：服務員都很熱情，幫忙拿行李，微笑服務很滿意
尊享行政禮遇:行政房很大，正方形浴缸是孩子最愛的，酒廊對孩子很友好，酒廊餐食選擇相對豐盛，甜品🍰出品相當棒，酒廊的晚餐簡餐就是正餐吧，三種主食隨便吃，重點是精緻不限量
早餐:豐盛，非常棒

真是一言難盡，剛住進去就給人感覺很不好，雖然後面值班經理努力幫我解決了，但大過年的，總是讓人不舒服。

然後做衞生的又出了問題，又是值班經理來道歉解釋了，我也沒話説了。

本以為就這樣結束了，誰知道後面還有事情。退房幾天後，我發現丟了個電腦充電器在房間，於是打電話給酒店，第一次給我回復説沒找到，並且強調説沒找到應該就是沒有，我詳細描述了退房的過程，明確這個充電器衹能是落在酒店了，然後第二次給我回復説找到了，當時登記有誤，通常客人落了東西在酒店，當天就應該聯繫客人的，內部流程如此混亂，朗廷已經完全沒有了以前精緻服務細心的感覺，也就是普通商務酒店的水準了。

客房送餐的品質也下降了，菜單上有些菜沒有，更不要説以前的客房送餐單比現在豐富得多。過年住朗廷的一大原因就是我印象中餐飲品質很好，現在各方面品質都下降了。

硬件設施過時這是沒辦法的事情，但是服務品質下降這就是酒店自身管理的問題了。

午餐自助和早餐值得推薦，完勝。

特別提幾點意見供酒店考慮：1. 雖然酒店保養良好，設施和裝修還是很棒的，但畢竟也有年頭了，有些房間的淋雨房的門密封條老化，洗澡會流水出來。2. 偶爾出現過天花板裏的空調冷凝管滲水，建議排查。3. 本次入住出現了白天上午有很大的維修/裝修聲，打給服務中心和前台，似乎未能及時解決，後來停了，感覺酒店內部在此類工作的對接上要再清楚一點，客房部門似乎並不清楚有工程在進行，影響了解決效率。

節之處見真章！因為不得不來深圳出差，但是又趕上疫情。慎重之後選擇了東海朗廷。辦入住的時候我的一個重要的包落在前台了，幸好前台給我辦入住的Luna及時提醒我，才沒有影響我的會議！！
入住期間的房間打掃，包括用品、茶品和水的再次補給，有水果送，每次用完餐都會跟你説謝謝，而且菜品精緻又很好吃，另外自助餐也不錯，服務真的太棒了！無論哪個崗位都會一看到客人就主動打招呼指路。每個員工都在繁忙，對客人的服務不分工種和級別，而且態度相當親奶[愉快]連禮賓部包括門口保安也是。走的時候luna還給我熱心介紹出行路線和注意事項，讓我省了不少心❤五星級的服務態度。
停車免費，登記車牌號出車等等都是非常的主動方便，感覺其他酒店都該向他們好好學習。性價比高，服務卻比其他家好。

總之失水準，跟我幾年前住的朗廷差別太大。
