Location is great. We also suggest their offer of one day (5 meals) plan for like RMB$450 per person, the executive lounge can see the beautiful view of the Pearl River and the Canton Tower.  Very happy with our stay for 3 days.

The food was average 5/10 for executive lounge standards, it was served cold and the cooked food was served over cooked. Ambience at the lounge was 10/10. Option for drinks was perfect 10/10. Noah was very helpful at the executive lounge and what made us feel welcomed was he remembered our names. We had a lovely time staying at the Ritz Carlton and will come back, we hope the food would be up to standards.

Everyone speaks English which is impressive! Dennis did a wonderful job checking me in! Rocky helped me find a location to take a Covid test and helped me figure out how to get my Covid test results from the previous day which was very helpful. The spa is extremely beautiful and relaxing and the swimming pool is very lovely! I booked an amazing makeup artist in Guangzhou to come over to do my makeup to take some beautiful pictures. I enjoyed the bar and had delicious spaghetti and a delicious dessert which included ice cream. I took a relaxing bath the next morning and had the most delicious breakfast I ordered through room service! It was the most amazing experience!

Their level of of service reflect the signature Ritz Carlton's hospitality brand. The room is massive and I slept comfortably during my stay. If anything, perhaps the pool is a bit small for a 5 star establishment and the breakfast spread is not quite on par with other Ritz Carlton hotels that I've stayed before.

Soundproof in the room is so poor, and the last thing one would expect from a property that has just been through extensive renovation. I could hear my neighbors, doors opening and closing, and cleaners cleaning in the morning when you are trying to sleep in. I would not recommend travelers who need complete quietness to sleep. This being said, the location is excellent, breakfast has varieties of options, and service is what one expects from a 5-star hotel.

The location is in Guangzhou Zhujiang New Town, behind K11. It is very prosperous. It is very convenient to go to Guangzhou Tower, parks, libraries, museums, and theaters. And there are many places to eat nearby.
Facilities: Renovated in 2021. The gym, swimming pool, and high-altitude bar are all very good. His family uses a small purple bottle of Asprey.

Service: After booking, Freya Danica Wendy from the guest department called to inquire about the check-in requirements and arranged welcome fruits for check-in. Usually, things are delivered quickly. You can also print documents downstairs.

Most importantly, the view is very good. Opposite is the Little Slender Waist, a super beautiful night view.

msg:After browsing the online reviews of various five-star hotels, I chose the Ritz-Carlton, and the netizens were honest. The hotel is in a good location, close to the Provincial Museum and Guangzhou Library, and next to K11. Fruits were also added in the evening, with a lot of variety, which was very good. The breakfast was very rich, a combination of Chinese and Western, and the porridge was freshly made and delicious. The hotel lobby is not big, the room hardware is good, but the hygiene details are still a bit lacking, and there are yellow stains around the sink drain.

This time, because I requested a non-smoking room, the front desk staff took the initiative to help coordinate a free upgrade to a room with a view of the Guangzhou Tower. It is commendable that they can provide a bath kit for children. The room is comfortable and clean. Guangzhou Library and Guangdong Museum of Literature are next to it. The Guangzhou Tower is not far away, so it is more convenient to get in and out!

msg:The service is very poor, the facilities are old, and this hotel is not cheap. I booked two rooms, one with a large bed and one with a city view. The average price is 2,000 yuan per night. I didn't expect it to be the worst experience. 
1. The check-in is very slow and unskilled. The person who helped me deliver the luggage didn't catch up with me halfway and disappeared. 
2. The bathtub drains very slowly. It takes an hour and a half to drain. It's so noisy that I can't sleep. 
3. The facilities are incomplete. There is not even an Apple charging port. The sockets are all yellow and look very old. The socket at the head of the bed can't be used at all. The charger will pop out directly if it is not pressed tightly. 
4. The hair dryer is the most old-fashioned one that costs about 50 yuan. 
I'm afraid that I can't sleep well on a business trip. I'll spend more money to find a hotel that's about the same. It's speechless. I won't dare to stay in the Ritz-Carlton series anymore. I usually don't write reviews for business trips or tourist hotels and homestays. I find it troublesome unless they are very good or very bad. This time I wrote a review seriously. I just think that the price and facilities of this hotel are really average.

msg:I stayed here before when I took my child to see an eye hospital. I didn't stay in a room with a view of Guangzhou Tower at that time. This time I chose a connecting room to see Guangzhou Tower. The child was very excited and said it was like a maze. The suite is connected to the twin room. Welcome fruits were given twice, especially peaches, which were super delicious. The manager on the 29th floor also gave two little lions, but I forgot their names. The service response was very good and fast. I called to ask if there were any disinfectant tablets to disinfect the bathtub. The room service directly came to disinfect the bathtub. After disinfection, two disposable bathtub covers were given. I participated in the parent-child activity to make pizza, which was pretty good. I hope there will be more parent-child activities. It is very close to the museum, library, Haixinsha West Pier and APM. But the swimming pool is quite disappointing. It is very small and not indoor. I also hope to add children's play facilities. It was raining heavily during the Qingming Festival and I couldn't go out. The children were bored staying in the hotel.

2. They come to clean at 10-11 am and insistently call. I'm sleeping at this time. I didn't like it very much either.
3. On the 3rd day they stopped renewing tea and sugar in the room.
4. The air conditioner temperature control does not work; it always blows 21-22 degrees. It was very cold in our room.
5. Light and curtain controls are buggy. Conventional switches would be more convenient. Only on the 2nd day did I roughly understand how to control the light.
6. The view from the window is excellent, the curtains were never closed, the view of the city, river and tower is beautiful.
7. Breakfast is 4+ for us, but probably 5+, for us, Asian cuisine is still unusual, and it predominates at breakfast.
8. Towels, sheets, etc. are all clean and changed every day. The room is spacious. There is a comfortable work desk with a view out the window, and there are enough sockets to keep everything connected.
9. The hotel is in a good location, everything is nearby, the metro, the city center, a park by the river, a pedestrian bridge, a tower. The airport is 45 minutes by metro or taxi. There are many shops and cafes nearby.

My room has carpets, which is very unhygienic. Because of these problems, the quality of the hotel seems to have dropped, and I will not go there again. Afterwards, the manager called me to communicate, but I thought why didn't I do a good job and come to ask for forgiveness? The most basic issue of a hotel is hygiene. It is hard to imagine that allergies can occur in a 5-star hotel. It is difficult to understand.

Huahui Plaza, library, museum, and grand theater are nearby. The hotel service staff are very enthusiastic and provide fruit drinks when you arrive at the store, and oranges after you finish the meal. There are quite a lot of breakfast varieties, especially the raw porridge is recommended. But the hotel is old after all, and the room had a pungent smell, probably from the air conditioner or carpet. The waiter brought an air purifier, and the window was opened, but the smell was still quite strong. Wifi is also average.

msg:Since we didn‚Äôt have a long vacation to celebrate my child‚Äôs birthday, we booked a room in the city where we live so that we could walk back to the hotel after eating the ‚ÄúMinase‚Äù buffet and check in. Perfect!
I called and asked for help with the decoration. The room was decorated with balloons, and the children were given drawing paper and brushes, as well as a little lion ü¶ÅÔ∏è doll. There are fruits and small chocolate cakes (which taste good). There is a charge for the minibar, but I bring my own drinks. Then I rearranged the layout~
The decoration facilities of the room: The facilities are a bit old, but they can still reflect the luxurious style. I especially like the cloakroom. It looks classic and luxurious. Our family of four has many clothes and shoes, which can be used and stored by us. . I won't talk about children's supplies. As a big-name hotel, it should be provided. Children's baths are generally of this brand. Smart toilet üöΩ is very convenient and comfortable to use. It would be better if the bathtubüõÅ could be improved. The bathtub toiletries are relatively monotonous. Thank you to my little brother for helping me install the bathtub cover. The plastic cover was slippery when the bathtub was raised, and the children almost slipped when they stepped out. Be careful if you have children.
As for service: The check-in front desk was indifferent... As soon as I checked in, I was recommended to upgrade to a room with Canton Tower view. I said no, why bother when I can see Canton Tower from the roof of my house... I told you that I had communicated in advance to arrange the birthday arrangements. After checking into the room, she realized that I was the guest who had called in advance to arrange the birthday room, and then... nothing happened... I looked indifferent. Was it because I didn't upgrade? On the contrary, the pretty cleaning lady and the greeting lady who stood at the door during the day were very polite. They would say hello and interact with the children... My husband told that sister to celebrate Dabao's birthday, and the lady very kindly gave me two children's luggage tags. , when he learned that I had two children, he even gave me a doll as a supplement.
I really don‚Äôt understand. Isn‚Äôt it great that a low-cost lion doll can increase the guest occupancy rate in our five-star hotel? Can only one be given to two children? I called and said that I could only give you one, and I asked the front desk. The front desk gave me a mechanical and formulaic answer, saying that the number was limited and I had done my best to help you apply for one, eh! **~
I was actually a little aggrieved at the time, so I had to pay for my humiliation and compromise. The receptionist on the phone and the front desk explained nicely to Dabao's birthday. Since I had sent a doll to Dabao, I hoped to give it to several little ones... but I was rejected. I was extremely disappointed. As a mother, how do I feel when I watch my little and big babies fighting for a toy?

Thanks again to the lady who greeted me at the door for her sincerity and kindness. At least it warmed my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è because she made me want to come back to experience the executive lounge next time.

Thanks to the two beauties of the hotel, Abby and Flora, the room reserved in advance was in a very good location...the children loved it. The night view is particularly great! The room is fully equipped with various facilities, including drinks and snacks! It‚Äôs just that we were in a hurry this time and had to catch the high-speed train early the next morning! I will stay here again next time I come to Guangzhou!

We entered the basement on the first floor twice and were blocked by many trucks for several minutes. We asked to enter the hotel before they moved the trucks for us and allowed us to drive in. The entrance to the underground garage was also blocked by many slop barrels. The kettle in the room where we entered by sliding the door had a foreign object like a small stone.

msg:A must-stay hotel every time I go to Guangzhou! This time, there seemed to be a female intern among the front desk staff in the lobby who was not familiar with the system operation. After entering the input, she asked the "person next to her" to assist. It took more than ten minutes (it was very fast before) to complete the check-in procedure. However, I went to the lobby to ask questions that night. I happened to meet Mr. Barry Lu from the previous stay. Mr. Lu was as cordial and professional as ever, and I was very satisfied with his response. The food at the Ritz is still top-notch, and the simple braised pork rice served during lunch in the executive lounge is probably my current choice. The best taste I have ever tasted. In addition, I would like to thank Ms. Rikki Duan of the Executive Lounge this time. When I brought my elderly family to stay, my family liked the Italian bread sticks in the meals in the Executive Lounge. I asked again this time. However, the hotel is not for sale to the public. After accidentally mentioning it to Ms. Duan, the other party specially packed some for me to take away and bring to my family. Although there are not many things, I am very grateful for this heart-warming service! Thank you againüôè! (It is now afternoon During tea time, all the snacks were collected, and only three kinds of biscuits were available for guests to pick up. Unlike before, they were all placed outside for guests to choose from. Now they are all served by hotel staff for guests. I don‚Äôt know if it is for cost control reasons. Because I don‚Äôt know the other party. What kind of small cake was servedüç∞, the experience was a little bit worse). But overall it was a very comfortable and pleasant stay. Next time I come to Guangzhou, this hotel is still the best choice!

It is a long-established five-star hotel with impeccable service! Thanks to the housekeeper Danica Ava, who was very considerate. She contacted us in advance before traveling and made proper arrangements for check-in, ensuring that we could check in as soon as we arrived at the hotel without waiting too much. This is really nice for families with children. The Pearl River Panoramic Room for children visiting relatives has a panoramic view of the riverside scenery. Children will love the small tent in the suite, which is very suitable for parents and children. Downstairs of the hotel is the Guangzhou Library, a 5-minute walk to the Guangdong Provincial Museum, and a 15-minute walk to Pearl River Avenue, Huacheng Square, China International Finance Corporation, etc. The transportation is very convenient. It was a very satisfying trip and very child-friendly. I will definitely come again if I have the chance!

The location can be said to be first-class, just down the road is the Guangzhou Library and the Guangdong Museum. Although the entire facility has been renovated, it is still a bit old, and of course it has the retro style of the Ritz. The service is average and the underground parking lot feels a bit rundown. The executive lounge on the 33rd floor can overlook the Canton Tower. The service is not bad, but the waiter's initiative is a little bit less, to be honest. Overall 85 points, recommended!

msg:The room is clean, the bathroom area is particularly good, and the bed, quilt, and pillows are all very comfortable. We went to the front desk to check in at almost 11 o'clock in the evening. The guy that day was so cute. After the room was arranged, he reminded us to turn off the lights at 11 o'clock and jogged us all the way to take the elevator. We lost our ID cards at the front desk and he helped us to deliver them in time. Come up! Attached to the review is a light-up photo of a slim waist, thank you to that cute guy!

The hotel not only arranged 30 floors, but Bevedly Flora also carefully decorated the room, placed fresh and rich fruits, and specially prepared cakes in the evening. What particularly warmed me was the handwritten greeting card given to us. I felt very thoughtful and soft in it. The greeter, the sister in the guest room, and the pastry chef who brought the cake were all very polite and made me feel at home.

The room was very spacious, especially the bathroom was very large and very good. However, the suite we stayed in had A light was broken, so we didn't tell the hotel because we had something to do. The breakfast in the morning was very good and had a lot of variety. After all, the room price was too expensive, hahaha.
By the way, the check-in process can actually be faster. It took me a long time, but they were very polite and the whole process was good.

Thanks to Guest Relations GR Flora and Ava for their attentive service. They contacted me by phone and WeChat before my trip. They responded to various questions in a timely manner during my stay at the hotel, demonstrating their high-quality service attitude and capabilities. It is highly recommended that everyone has the opportunity to experience the service of the executive lounge. Regardless of the restaurant view (Guangzhou Tower view), the quality of the dishes, and the level of service, it makes people feel that it is worth the money. In particular, I would like to praise Ms. Susie Fu Qianqian for her over 100-point service. Her enthusiasm and professionalism make people have to admire the hotel's standards and vision in selecting employees! In just two days, I felt like home, and I look forward to seeing you again at The Ritz-Carlton next time!

It's an old hotel, very clean, with well-equipped facilities, which shows that daily maintenance is in place.
The room cleaning pays great attention to details. Guests' broken belongings are sorted out for you, and they also write service cards, which is heartwarming.

First of all, the front office arranged the wrong room. After struggling for a long time, the front office arranged a double bed room for me, and then asked me to change it again. The room I changed had an obvious musty smell, and the room I changed still had the same smell. The problem is, I was too tired and didn‚Äôt want to bother, so I finally endured it. As a result, there were people getting married and getting married in the room next to the floor I arranged at around 8 o‚Äôclock in the morning. It was so noisy that I couldn‚Äôt sleep.
In fact, the rooms and decoration are very good, but the service and management really can't keep up, which ultimately leads to a very poor experience.

msg:I brought my eight-year-old twin sons to Guangzhou for summer vacation. I didn't know where to live in the urban area, so I chose Ritz-Carlton after comparison. The location of the hotel is superior. The downstairs is the Guangzhou City Library, and the Guangdong Provincial Museum is in front of it. It only takes two stops to go to the Guangzhou Tower by the APM line. The nearby businesses are also very complete, and it is very convenient to go out for food. The decoration style is my favorite American retro style, and the toiletries are also my favorite fragrance brand "Diptyque". This time I stayed in a tower view room on the 25th floor. The view is very good, and you can see the tower through the window. Next time I come to Guangzhou, I will consider staying here.

msg:The hotel is located in the most prosperous area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGuangzhou, across the river from Canton Tower.
Facilities: There is a swimming pool on the fourth floor of the hotel. There are not many people. It is suitable for taking children for a swim. There are electric curtains in the room, and you can see the Canton Tower when you open the curtains. There is also capsule coffee in the room. In addition to the conventional configuration of shower room and bathtub, there is also Kohler's fully automatic toilet in the bathroom, and there is a small TV next to the sink. The washbasin is a little high, and the position is slightly inside. The water during washing is easy to splash on the edge of the table and wet the clothes.
Hygiene: The room and bathroom are clean and tidy, which is comparable to that of a five-star hotel.
Service: The waiters at the entrance of the lobby are enthusiastic and take the initiative to help guests with their luggage. The front desk will take the initiative to contact the guests before they check in and arrange rooms according to the needs of the guests. On the day of check-in, fruit and snacks were thoughtfully arranged. If there is any shortcoming, the overall a**osphere of the hotel is more business-oriented. Not many facilities for children.

Is it because you are short of the 3,400 yuan, or is it an insult to further insult?

Because of an emergency, I wanted to check in and work in the hotel in advance, so I quickly contacted the housekeeper. They perfectly solved my needs and brought out my professional quality. Thank you very much. Although it was a late check-in in the end, the spirit of genuinely caring for the guests was very comforting. The location of the hotel is excellent, the service is very good, the style of the room is very pleasing, and the luggage is put in the room for the guests. When queuing up for breakfast, they can also take the initiative to understand our needs and arrange a meal in the lobby. The breakfast is very rich and has everything you need. There is also a handsome foreign guy who distributes ice cream. Next to the hotel is the Guangdong Provincial Museum and Library. Unfortunately, due to time, I didn't have time to see it. It is recommended to stay in the room type where you can see Xiaomanyao and the Pearl River. The scenery is so beautiful that it makes people linger and forget to return. The three-day and two-night trip will soon end. I look forward to meeting with the hotel next time.

I checked in at night on 7/31, and I went out to do errands at noon on 8/1. I went down to the first floor and told the front desk that the room needs to be cleaned! Back to the room at 14:30, and it was not cleaned! Before going out around 15:30. The second time I called the front desk to explain that the room needs to be cleaned! When I came back at 17:30 in the evening, I needed to rest and found that the room was still the same! I called the concierge for the third time and said I wanted to make a complaint. After a while, the staff knocked on the door with the cleaning lady! Ask if you want to clean now! ? Said that they made a mistake in the handover of work! Come so fast when I want to complain? And I'm already going to rest, so I came to clean? Does it fit?
Nothing more than three right! three times! It was not cleaned until 8/2 check out! Toothbrush gives a day's share! Let me brush for two days! Is this what you call a service? All bath towels have not been changed! Fortunately, I still brought my own disposable bath towels!
Let's talk about breakfast, I asked me what I wanted to drink, I brought my own kettle, I said, please fill me with warm water! The waiter replied yes, and then... I came back with my breakfast and the empty kettle was still there. I had to find a waiter myself and I almost had to pour the water myself!
By the way, mention your GR üëç
This is the hotel with the worst service I have ever seen! Completely snub customers! The experience is very poor! Stepped on the pit, quit Park Hyatt and come to your Ritz-Carlton, I really have a bad brain!

My phone was almost out of battery, so I called the front desk again. It took about 20 minutes for the doorman to deliver it! It's already past five o'clock! Fortunately, I have a child with me and she prefers the room, so forget it. When I go out and get in and out of the car, I open the car door once or twice out of ten times, and I only ask to help carry my luggage!

1. The faucet in the shower room is broken and the drain of the washbasin is broken, but no one cares about it. I called to complain, and no one responded for half an hour. I had to keep calling to urge someone to contact me. This service is really speechless. .
2. The service is very poor. If you know that there is a group checking in, you should separate the group and individual guests for check-in procedures. As a result, all the waiters check in for the group, and the individual guests have to wait for half an hour before checking in. The on-site management is very poor. .
3. The hotel facilities are very dilapidated. Ctrip also said that the Meijing Hotel was really good, but it turned out that it was not even comparable to the Poly Intercontinental Hotel. The European style is not like the European style, and it is gloomy. . Very not recommended to stay.
     Anyway, the management is poor, the service is not in place, and the service awareness is not good. It is a thousand miles away from Four Seasons and Rosewood. I would rather stay in the Sheraton than this hotel. . At least the Sheraton service is much better than it. Bad review Bad review!

I read a book saying that the Ritz seems to need improvement in the reception of children, but I was still attracted by the special European style. After arriving at the store, the lady at the front desk received us warmly and gave the children two inflatable toys. We also gave us a free breakfast (the breakfast is a bit expensive, hahaha), our room is quite large, and there are two basins in the bathroom, so brushing your teeth and washing your face will not be crowded. The little brother also introduced some operation methods such as switches, and there are fresh fruits on the table as a gift. There are also free soft drinks to drink, and after we went out for food, we also gave a pineapple-flavored beer as a gift, which tasted okay. There is also a floor mat under the basin. Children's exclusive bathrobes and toiletries are also provided. The breakfast is really good, right from the expensive price, hahaha. There are raw beef porridge, pizza, Hong Kong-style dim sum, and the meals are quite exquisite. The overall experience is not bad, the location is OK, just next to the Guangzhou Museum and the library, some of the outdated facilities mentioned in the online reviews are acceptable, if it is not so friendly to family members who like to charge by the bed, come here At that time, we went around twice before finding the main entrance of the hotel. The hotel logo was not particularly obvious at the intersection, so we missed it accidentally. Also, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the toilet is fully automatic.

msg:Although the hotel is relatively old, the hardware facilities are good, and the service details are in place. The doorman will come up to open the door, help with luggage, and has a strong sense of service. The check-in coincided with the anniversary, and Nuanxin helped to decorate the room to send blessings and cakes. The old people in our company also arranged adjacent rooms, and the bathroom was covered with non-slip mats in advance, which is almost responsive and considerate for guests everywhere. From check-in to room service, and the staff at the outdoor swimming pool are all smiling and soft-spoken, very warm. The bedding is comfortable, and the skin care products smell very good. If I come to Guangzhou in the future, I will still choose this place.

The content of the package is very recommended. The executive lounge on the 33rd floor of the hotel is simply invincible. The ingredients and products are very suitable for both of us. It is worth going on vacation again.

Although the hotel is a little old, all the service staff are very enthusiastic, as warm as coming home. Every detail of the hotel is well done. I didn't choose Magnificent and Four Seasons, but I prefer Marriott's culture, which is very warm and family-like. The front desk also sent a children's day drawing book to the baby, very happy. Special thanks to HR Kevin for his warm hospitality, and Niki at the front desk for his thoughtful service, who delayed the check-out and let the baby take a nap. Breakfast is also delicious. The location is also invincible and convenient. Xiaomanyao, Haixinsha, Huacheng Square, library, and museum are all just a few steps down the stairs. very good! Come back next time you have a chance!

msg:Location: The location is very good, you can walk to the Guangdong Museum and the Guangzhou Library in 5 minutes. 10 minutes away from Huacheng Square, especially suitable for watching the night view of Canton Tower.
Facilities: The lobby is very small, which is similar to other netizens' comments. The decoration is very European, very delicate, and the aroma in the lobby smells good.
The room facilities are also very complete, and the toiletries used are also very good.
It is very convenient to go to the Michelin one-star restaurant on the third floor, but in order to ensure a seat, it is recommended to reserve a seat in advance. Food products are relatively good. It is also very delicate, but the price/performance ratio is not as good as the nearby Taotaoju.
Disadvantages:
1. The service seems to be very good and enthusiastic, but it is not efficient and a bit messy. The concierge helped deliver the luggage to the room, but it didn't arrive for nearly an hour. I called and asked several times and said that it was delivered, but it turned out that I went to the concierge on the first floor to find the luggage.
2. Cleaning problem. I went out in the morning and came back at about 14:00. I wanted to rest, but the room was not cleaned yet. Call for consultation, and tell the cleaning to give priority to cleaning before going out, and then arrange cleaning. He also said that cleaning is done by floor, and it hasn't been arranged to the room I live in yet. I have stayed in hotels with more rooms than this and have never encountered this kind of problem. I don't know whether the staffing is insufficient or your hotel's regulations.
3. The shower room in the living room only uses a paper door to separate the dry and wet areas. Since the slope of the floor drain was not well grasped during the decoration, the water will overflow to the sink when taking a shower, and it is easy to slip.
4. At the same price, the room in this hotel is a bit small, and the tower view window is divided into two by a wall, which is not very bright.

msg:Originally, it was my birthday, so I specially booked an executive room.
1. The front desk told me to upgrade the room type, but finally failed to fulfill the contract. Check in at 3:00 pm as agreed. I didn't expect the room to be cleaned yet. The front desk gave us a small surprise and told us that we could upgrade the room type and the view would be better. I didn't expect to call to confirm the room after checking in and forgot to give us a note. It was upgraded, and in the end it was the room type we booked. We didn't have time to pack our luggage and wait for the room change. In the end, we compromised and received an apology lion and a luggage tag.
2. The room has a strong musty smell. It was the first time I smelled the smell of damp wood in a five-star hotel. The room faced the opposite twin buildings, and the view was blocked by more than half. I looked at the map and found that this direction was the side with the worst view. The most uncomfortable thing was the front desk. When I apologized, I added that the room we lived in actually had a very good view. The view of the building is blocked by the side where I live. I really appreciate it. Everyone, avoid lightning in this room 3612.
3. The welcome fruit, I want to laugh a little, this is the most perfunctory welcome fruit I have ever seen, I gave a few plums that are neither sweet nor sour, without any presentation, I don‚Äôt know how the thief evaluates it.
3. The executive lounge experience is good. The main purpose is to watch the concert, and there is no time to go out to eat, so the executive lounge is our best choice. The whole team in the lounge is enthusiastic but concerned about the privacy of the guests. There are many, three or four hot dishes, and there is no time to experience them at other times.
4. The taste of the food delivered in the room was amazing. Arrived at the hotel at midnight snack time, ordered the wanton noodles and grilled skewers set, the service delivery brother was super good, he helped us set up all the tableware, and also provided salt and pepper, the wonton noodles delivered, the noodles were very chewy, and it felt like they just came out The pot is the same, it is more delicious than breakfast, the charcoal grilled skewers are full of flavor, it has the taste of supper, and the meat is delicious.
5. For breakfast, we choose the cafeteria on the first floor, because there are more varieties than the executive lounge. There are indeed many varieties, with Cantonese characteristics, all kinds of porridge, dim sum and wonton noodles, and the bread taste of Western breakfast is not bad .

Hygiene: Hygiene must be in place, but the smell in the lobby is too strong, which is a bit of a headache.
Environment: The surrounding environment is very convenient. Opening the curtains is a small waistline, and the location is superior. Of course, this may also be one of the few advantages of this hotel.
Service: I really can't keep up with the service. It should be the worst service among the many Ritz-Carltons I have lived in. After checking in in the morning, the front desk told them to send the luggage into the room. As a result, when I came back at night and saw that the luggage was still at the front desk, I simply brought it up by myself. Later, because the guests upstairs were too noisy, I responded to them and told them that I would give you a free breakfast for two, but did not change the room. We accept your handling results , I didn‚Äôt order breakfast because I couldn‚Äôt get up so early. As a result, I checked out before leaving. The double breakfast that day was not free, and it was still on the bill. I didn‚Äôt care about it when I was in a hurry to catch the plane. To be honest, the quality of the breakfast is also very poor. It is not because your hotel service is poor, so I slander you. The objective facts must be clearly stated. Good is good, and bad is bad. I booked a room for a week, and the room rate is about 2500 per day. It is cost-effective It's really low. You always recommend us to eat at the Chinese restaurant in the hotel. If the breakfast is of this level, what do you expect us to expect from the dishes? Thank you for refreshing our understanding of the Ritz-Carlton brand.

1. When you arrive at the hotel, there will be staff to help you with your luggage and open the door. When you check in at the front desk, there will be dedicated colleagues to guide people to avoid centralized queuing;
2. The room is also very clean. At the beginning, because the room was a bit like the southern sky, I changed it and prepared welcome fruit;
3. There are other latex pillows to choose from, the quilt cover is also very comfortable, and the mattress is not very soft;
4. I upgraded the administrative courtesy myself, and encountered some minor problems. The duty manager Dennis Liang quickly helped to solve it, and proposed several options for guests to choose from, very professional! Because it was evening, a supper was also included. The tangerines given by the administrative courtesy are very good;
5. The taste of food and drink is quite satisfactory, nothing special.
The overall service exceeded my expectations, and the room renovation is also good. I will continue to choose Ritz next time~

msg:Before checking in, I read many other guests' comments. There were many surprises mentioned in the comments, including "welcome fruit", which is a common practice in most hotels now. But it didn't happen after I checked in. This was beyond my expectation. The child was sleeping during the day, and I was always worried that it would suddenly come to deliver fruit and wake up the child. I didn't receive a welcome gift until I turned the bed down at night. I was curious, so I called the switchboard to ask if it was there or not. The switchboard said to check, I said I didn‚Äôt mean to ask you, I just wanted to know why I saw some customers on Ctrip saying that there were welcome fruits and macarons, and then I held the phone and checked. Said you could send me one. I said, can you tell me, normally I have this reservation or not? She said no, but because it was my first stay, I could send a simple fruit. About 40 minutes or so, I delivered a small fruit, an apple, two green dates, and a passion fruit. Sorry for not taking pictures. Because I really have no appetite.
Then when I was using the hair dryer at 9 o'clock in the evening, there were frequent poor connections at the beginning. I thought it was not plugged in properly, and then sparks came out. right. Sparks. Immediately called the switchboard, the staff there also expressed shock, sorry, and asked about my safety. And told me that I would report it as soon as possible and solve it for me. Five minutes later, I received a call from the manager on duty. After a brief communication, the other party apologized and said that he would arrange a fruit plate for me. I said no, it was too late and we couldn‚Äôt eat any more, but I think this matter is still very serious. , If it causes clothing, hair fire, or burns the skin, it is terrible. The other party kept apologizing. Then he said that he would give me a hotel mascot, but I also refused. When this kind of thing happens again, a fruit plate or a mascot will not have the same soothing effect. Thank you again for the prompt response from this employee. After all, this was not caused by this employee or someone else, and it should not be the responsibility of an employee to bear the guest's bad mood or loss.
After checking in at noon that day, I used the hotel kettle to boil two bottles of mineral water from the hotel. I cleaned the kettle before cooking. Very cloudy. As shown in the picture. Because the child was going to sleep, I washed the kettle again and boiled a pot of water. After comparing it, it was ok, so I took a rest.
The next day is the day of check-out, because I told the manager on duty the day before that check-out might be delayed, and the other party readily agreed to extend it to 3:00, but we checked out directly in the lounge after lunch and left . Because I really don't want the staff to apologize for the hair dryer, everyone is very embarrassed.
After I left the hotel, maybe the colleagues in the lounge heard about it and called me again, and they still wanted to send me the hotel‚Äôs little lion, but I still refused. Because I still feel that these two things are not equivalent, I still appreciate the attitude of the staff.
In addition, the hotel does not provide safety fences. The reason is that there are unsafe factors that will trap children. The baby cots in the hotel are 97 cm long. Basically, children who are about one and a half to two years old cannot sleep, and the twin beds cannot be shared. The bed is very high. I don't know if this is my family's problem.
How should I put it, this stay has mixed feelings, and the attitude of the staff is very good, but there is a feeling that the hotel can't keep up with all aspects, especially the breakfast, which is a disaster. I can't imagine that 3000+ (paid upgrade) hotel breakfast is like this. I didn't know what I ate the whole time.
The concierge ignored the car door, did not open the door, did not take the luggage, and did not open the hotel door
Check-in is very fast, and the room is available within 10 minutes. The GR at the front desk is very enthusiastic and guides you effectively
The executive lounge is really great, the environment, landscape, food, service, nothing can be faulted.
The room is very clean, no smell, no old feeling, and the view is very good.
I hope that some safety hazards can be taken seriously

     The location of the hotel is excellent. The Guangzhou Library and the Guangdong Provincial Museum are just outside the door. The Huacheng Square and the Guangzhou Opera House are within a 5-minute walk. It is very convenient to take the APM unmanned subway at Huacheng Square to the Canton Tower for two stops. There are many shopping centers around the hotel, and there are many choices for eating.
     Although the hotel has been in business for many years, the equipment is well maintained. The panoramic room has an excellent view, and the beautiful Pearl River and Guangzhou Tower are just outside the window. The night view can only be described as stunning.
     The hotel has excellent service, which can be called 5-star+. When I checked in, I gave the room bill but still had a grand birthday decoration. When I checked out, I gave the grandson the hotel mascot as a birthday gift, which gave the child multiple surprises.
     Finally, thank you to the hotel for making our trip worthwhile and giving our grandson an unforgettable birthday.

I called for room service three times and it took more than half an hour to arrive. The only drawback was the buffet at night. The oysters were unlimited but definitely not fresh. Two of the three were bad. The clams were full of sand. Other dishes were mediocre and the experience was very poor. It was not at all what was advertised on the website. , is the worst buffet I have ever had in recent years, bar none. I hope the store can improve! In sharp contrast to the dinner, the breakfast was very good. I couldn't fault it. Was it made by two batches of cooks?

There was actually a live broadcast of more than a dozen people in one room carrying goods next door. During breakfast, I met them in the elevator moving equipment and had to wait for a long time. It was very noisy early in the morning. When I opened the door, there were several large takeout garbage bags on the ground. I was really speechless.
However, after reporting the situation to the front desk, I was immediately upgraded to a room with a view and given fruits and cakes. The service was mediocre, but the room I was changed to had a sewage smell. I guess the hotel knew about this problem because I kept the exhaust on. Afternoon tea is nothing amazing but the price is cheap

The opposite bank is the Canton Tower (you must live in a tower view room to see it). The user-friendly smoking area on the first floor (Figure 3) is very friendly and comfortable, and there is no mandatory tea fee or seat fee. On the evening of the New Year, I also gave Guangzhou special pineapple beer and biscuits (picture 4), which was very touching. Overall business, tourism, parent-child are recommended.

The room service attitude is very good, and there is a need to respond immediately. The only small problem is that the phone in one of the rooms we booked is different from other rooms.

It is very convenient to walk to Liede's bar and have a late night snack at night. You can walk and chat in the square late at night, and enjoy the quiet Guangzhou CBD exclusively.
The decoration of the hotel has that kind of old European style, I like it very much, the sofa, bathroom, bed, etc. in the room are full of European aristocratic temperament. From the window of the room, you can see Xiaomanyao, the North and South Towers, the Pearl River, and the high-rise buildings near Huacheng Square, which has the a**osphere of a modern metropolis. Lying on the bed at night, you can see the dotted lights of various office buildings, and you can enjoy the night view of the city quietly, which will make you feel a lot of thoughts!
The variety of breakfast is also very rich, and children, the elderly, and young people can all enjoy the food.
Hotel service is also great! Because it was a high-speed train later in the afternoon, the hotel delayed the check-out time for free after knowing it! The waiter's attitude is also very enthusiastic, and the room is tidied up in one breakfast time! Check out was quick too!
It is a bit of a shame that the building is designed so that the windows of the rooms are separated by walls.
All in all, I enjoyed my stay very much!

It has been a long time, and the repairs are rough to the point of speechlessness! The shower is leaking! Shower is small enough! The service can't keep up, I ordered mineral water and latex pillows, but they didn't arrive after waiting for an hour, so I called again! I don't know if the latex pillow is that kind of latex pillow! Ridiculously hard! The lighting in the whole room is dim, which makes people feel very depressed.

Since I didn‚Äôt dine at the hotel when I arrived in Guangdong, I ate my favorite dishes and morning tea at Bingsheng Restaurant in Guangzhou. The cakes in the lounge are delicate in taste. It‚Äôs good that there are many foreign channels on TV. The only thing is that the cloakroom is a bit small.

I wiped it myself the night I checked in! 2. I ordered takeaway and told the front desk clerk that there are two takeaways, but only one was delivered in the end. I told the waiter who brought it up that there was another one downstairs, but in the end there was no news, not even a notification that it was not found! (Are you hungry to eat!?), and there is a takeaway next, I forgot to tell it to be delivered upstairs, and no one notified me after staying for two days! 3. The temperature control equipment in the toilet is also broken! Although I understand that May Day is busy, but a good hotel can't be so bad?

After the room layout was updated, I felt that the space felt better. Walking into the lobby with an ancient British style, I felt that the surrounding time had slowed down.
Special thanks to Juno, Manager of Executive Lounge, Noah, Supervisor, and Judy, Claudia, Lilia, Kiki, Antonia, Charlie, Lisa, Anne, Joesta, Corrie. The time in the Executive Lounge is truly a home away from home. Needless to say the scenery, as the hotel closest to the Canton Tower in the CBD, the beauty of Yangcheng is naturally unobstructed. In terms of service, because it is a holiday, there are a lot of guests in the executive lounge, but during busy hours, even the lounge manager will personally help to collect meals and serve dishes, so even if there are many people, the service quality can always be maintained online. Point is really rare.

msg:I stayed in the hotel's executive room again and it still felt so good. Besides, there is no need to talk about the advantages. However, you can take away the room card, which is quite interesting. Let me give you some advice: both Four Seasons and Magnificent hair dryers use Dyson, so please keep up, otherwise you will really fall behind. The facilities in the bathroom are a bit old. The faucets were all unscrewed and I had to install them myself. The food in the executive lounge is still good, but the desserts can be slightly less sweet. The most important thing is, as an executive room, should there be a desk for work convenience? In addition, the mirrors in the corridor still need to be wiped clean. Of course, the entire stay experience was still great. There were just a few flaws. I hope my suggestions can make the Ritz-Carlton even better tomorrow.

The hotel is located in Zhujiang New Town in Tianhe District. Facing the Guangzhou Library, there are many brand hotels in this area. Leeds Carlton is adjacent to Conrad, Rosewood, W. The opening time of the hotel itself is not very short, and the overall decoration style is typical European style.
There is a place for afternoon tea in the lobby, and there are some Guangzhou people who come to drink afternoon tea on holidays. Even if there are not many children in the hotel during holidays, the residents are basically younger.
üìä There are Executive Lounge on the 33rd floor, Churchill Bar on the third floor, and Lixuan Chinese Restaurant, all of which are very good.
üìä The hotel's gym is well equipped, and I exercise 1-2 times a day during my stay. It adds a lot to the whole stay experience.
üìäThe queen room I stayed in this time. The layout is spacious. It should be about 40 square meters. There is still a small sofa area next to the bed, and the bathroom is large, with a bathtub and a shower, and has a double sink. Next to the bathroom is a mini cloakroom equipped with a full-length mirror. As the top brand of the Marriott depar**ent, there is nothing to say about bedding and mattresses.
üçéüà¥Ô∏èI give 8 points for hotel check-in.

The Ritz-Carlton Hotel, a true century-old brand, originates from Europe and is headquartered in the United States. It is known as the roof of the world.
The Ritz-Carlton, Guangzhou was built in 2008. It was jointly founded by the top international hotel management group Ritz-Carlton and Guangzhou R&F Real Estate. It is the earliest international luxury five-star hotel in Guangzhou.

üöñTransportation:
The Ritz-Carlton, Guangzhou is located in the core area of ‚Äã‚ÄãZhujiang New Town, the central business district of Guangzhou. It is adjacent to many cultural landmarks such as the Guangdong Provincial Museum, Guangzhou Grand Theater, Guangzhou Library, and across the river from the Canton Tower. It has a unique geographical location and very convenient transportation.

üè†Facilities:
The hotel has 351 rooms and 91 luxury apar**ents. This time I stayed in a deluxe tower view twin room, 50 square meters, with unparalleled views. The guest rooms have entrance corridors, walk-in closets and other designs. The room furniture is made of dark-toned mahogany, harmonizing with the original wooden floors. The original wooden boards and the soft and delicate cashmere carpet are very warm.
Room fabrics are made from velvet, silk and soft wool, and the piping is woven from silk. The room is equipped with Simmons Sweet Dreams Black Label series mattress, which is matched with pure cotton fabric with excellent texture. It has strong wrapping when sleeping on it and guarantees the quality of sleep experience.
Two-tone paint wall panels, antique mirrors, leather stitching, and simple and soft solid-color curtains create a light and refined residential a**osphere. The bathroom is spacious and bright, equipped with a separate bathtub and shower room, double sinks, granite countertops, and toiletries are from Asprey from the UK.
There are capsule coffee and tea bags, in addition to German Ronnefeldt, there are also local Guangzhou scented teas, eight-treasure tea, etc.
The hotel gym and swimming pool are on the fourth floor. The gym is not big, but the equipment is fully functional, with equipment area, aerobic area, and a yoga room. The swimming pool is outdoor, heated, and has a heated soaking pool. The lounge chairs around the pool are very comfortable. There is also a steam room in the locker room.

[Service Bell] Service:
The service is generally good. But it is not a butler-style service. Many things will not be proactively thought of or arranged in advance for the guests. However, as long as the guests ask or make requests, everything will be answered.
In terms of guest service, everyone from the manager to the clerks to the cleaners has a very good attitude.

üç≤Catering:
The hotel has six restaurants and lounges: the distinguished Cantonese restaurant Li Xuan (one Michelin star and two Black Pearl diamonds); the international food stage FOODS; the fashionable and modern Italian restaurant Yixuan (Michelin Plate Award); the European-style lobby bar Pearl Wine Gallery; Churchill Bar, a British whiskey and cigar bar, not only inherits the culinary essence of "eating in Guangzhou", but also closely follows the world's food trends.
The executive lounge on the 33rd floor offers a 270-degree view of the Pearl River and is known as "the most beautiful space in Guangzhou". Here, we enjoy colorful and exquisite dining and entertainment during five periods of breakfast, lunch, dinner, afternoon tea, and sweet wine and desserts. A range of personalized services. Recommend the cuttlefish noodles, pan-fried radish cake and white fungus syrup.

I am very satisfied with the breakfast. The chicken porridge and seafood porridge are much better than those in other restaurants. And there is actually ice cream available during this time period, which is great.
The toiletries asprey... smell bad, and the disposable bottle is not leak-proof, and it will bleed into your hands as soon as you open it.
The swimming pool is outdoor. Is it covered in winter? Otherwise, it would be freezing to death? The WiFi signal in the swimming pool area is so poor that even a WeChat voice call won't work.
The gym view is much different from Rosewood, and the facilities are also no better than Rosewood. I don't know how good it is. However, there are still quite a lot of small equipment here.

I really don‚Äôt know what else to play in one day, but I just saw that there is a package recommended to stay in the hotel all day, so I decided to book it. If you are staying at the Ritz for the first time like me, or if you want to take your children to relax and experience a high-end hotel, then I hope reading my review will help you. Among the hotels I have stayed in in the past, only the St. Regis should be at the same level as the Ritz. Sheraton and Hilton seem to be a little lower than its level, so my child and I have high expectations, so when we When I first came to the hotel's underground garage, I was a little disappointed. Passengers and goods share the same entrance and driveway. The underground garage has no floor paint and the parking spaces are messy. These are all flaws of the old building. There is a quick charge for the tram, which is a surprise, but there are only two charging guns, and the oil car may occupy the tram parking space. I called the front desk and got the answer that they can't do anything about it, but later a waiter contacted me to have a space for charging, And also help me occupy a parking space, which is completely unexpected. The room type has not been upgraded, so the room landscape is not very good. The decoration in the room is quite satisfactory, and the small accessories are worth the cost, such as the switch panel and the faucet hardware, but the quality of the decoration is average, and the inspection openings of several ceilings are made ugly. Incomparably, the curtain control button of the bedside table was damaged and not repaired in time, which is very inappropriate. The soft packs can quite reflect the brand tonality of Ritz, but there is no welcome fruit or free soft drinks, which are available in many five-star hotels. The feature of the package is that it includes 5 meals, so that you can take your children to relax in the hotel, but there are 4 meals that need to go to the same place to dine, and will face the same group of waiters, but I have to say that the fat boy Great service from brother. The dining environment in the executive lounge is good. Sitting by the window, you can see the waist, and it is beautiful to take pictures when the weather is good. Afternoon tea is very ordinary, the same as those of Rosewood and Jumeirah, mainly taking pictures and viewing the scenery. The exquisite dinner is actually not bad, but there are few choices, but the food is full, and the main dish of beef brisket is quite good. Evening desserts and wine are ok, but no drinking with kids. For breakfast, we went to the restaurant on the first floor. There are many kinds of meals, and each kind of product is very appetizing, and it is very good to eat well. However, the meal time given by the front desk does not match the actual meal time provided. The details are as follows: Necessary improvement. I didn't eat lunch because I was too full for breakfast, which should be similar to an exquisite dinner. In addition to eating and drinking in the hotel, you can also take children to swim. The overall feeling is still good, and it is recommended to rot it occasionally. However, the price/performance ratio of more than 2k+ is average, and it cannot be said that it is low. After all, this is the Ritz Hotel, but if you often stay in five-star hotels, you should not have high expectations. Anyway, we do not feel that it is better than Hilton, How much better are these Sheraton brands, and even some newly built Sheratons are even better in terms of details and services.

msg:(brief review version)
The overall stay experience was above expectations. The highlights were the executive lounge, breakfast on the first floor and bathroom facilities in the room. The shortcomings were the room porch floor and charging sockets. Although there are not many types of meals in the executive lounge, the products are exquisite, the service is meticulous and responsive, and the lounge is very quiet; while the breakfast on the first floor is rich in variety, and four flavors of jam are placed on each table. As for the bathroom facilities in the room, the smart toilet is highly praised, but the small TV is slightly lacking (it is too far from the bathtub and too small). The reason why the wooden floor in the corridor and the sockets in the room were considered to be deficient was because the wooden floor at the entrance sank at the bathroom door and the sockets in the room were unreasonably located. But the faults do not hide the faults. Overall, it was well received and the stay experience was excellent. I would like to thank the hotel staff! Warm service!

(Long comment version)
I have to say that the experience of staying at the Ritz-Carlton was still very good. If I had to give a review on the entire night's stay, it would be "exceeded expectations." Because when I first booked the hotel, I wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to stay in the hotel for a day, doing nothing and just resting. So I hesitated for a while during the selection process, and finally chose between Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton. the latter. Although I had expectations, what I was more worried about before checking in was that it would end up being "sleeping on a soft and weak bed with back pain, and then eating a mediocre breakfast with no highlights." Fortunately, it didn't turn out that way.
I originally thought I would arrive at around two o'clock (there is a question here, why can't I check in after three o'clock in the afternoon? Generally, I can check in at two o'clock, but three o'clock seems a bit late), so I opened the hotel in the morning When I asked about the expected check-in time on the phone, I said half past two (I still have to give a good review here. At that time, the hotel said that if check-in arrived at two thirty, it could be arranged and the hotel would clean the room in advance to make room available). It's a pity that I arrived late later, which wasted the hotel's arrangements (although there was no way to verify whether it was really vacated in advance). I set off so late that I was worried that the afternoon tea would be over after checking in on the way. Fortunately, I didn't miss the time.
When I was preparing to check in at the lobby, the receptionist reminded me that executive rooms can be checked in on the 33rd floor, so I didn't check in at the lobby. The young lady was very enthusiastic about helping us pull the suitcase, but my suitcase was really not easy to pull, so I declined her offer. I would like to thank this young lady. This really shows the level of care in service in the small details, or the so-called "service consciousness". Thank you!
Here I should first comment on the environment of the executive lounge. Personally, I think the number and relative positions of the seats are relatively well arranged. They are not overcrowded or sparse. More than half of the seats are occupied by the window, so the seats by the window are not filled all at once. Moreover, the lounge is very quiet, which is suitable for simply dining or sitting and chatting.

After checking in, we had afternoon tea in the lounge. Personally, I think the afternoon tea snacks can be considered exquisite, but not amazing. The desserts may not be as delicious as the salty snacks. But the jam is very good, creamy and not greasy. Among them, the orange-yellow jam has tasted several times, and I think it should be a mixture of orange and grapefruit. The acidity and sweetness are just right, not too sour, and just enough to relieve the greasiness of the dessert. As for the tea that comes with it, although it doesn‚Äôt taste bad, the 1 yuan tea bag seems a bit lacking in sincerity. However, one thing worth commending here is that there is a small jar containing sugar cubes on each table. There are brown sugar and white sugar. You can use tongs to add sugar to the cup yourself. This is better than putting bags of white sugar or sugar in the cup. It is better to have brown sugar at the table for afternoon tea, because small packages of granulated sugar are easy to scatter during the process of tearing and pouring, and the amount is difficult to control.
After having afternoon tea, it was actually almost 5:30, so I chose to put my luggage back in the room and rest in the room before having dinner. The room we stayed in and the room next door can be connected, but their connection method is different from the direct opening of the door in the room that many hotels use to connect to each other. Instead, after the two rooms open the door, they open another one at the end of the corridor facing each other. Door. The door in the corner of the corridor was open when we checked in, but obviously, if a family or multiple friends are checking in together, that door can be closed, and then everyone can open their own doors. In this way, there is no need to open the door in the room to affect the sound insulation, and you can also close the respective room doors when needed. In contrast, individuals will recognize this design more.
The room is really great overall. There is nothing to be too picky about. Each area is well laid out and the space is large enough. The bed is just right in softness and hardness and will not sink in as soon as you sleep on it. The bathroom is relatively large and does not look too compact, and the toilet is separated by a sliding door to ensure that two people can use the bathroom at the same time. The toilet is a smart toilet. Although this is slowly becoming a standard feature in many hotels, many luxury hotels have not updated their configurations and still use ordinary flush toilets. Personally I think the position of the small TV is not well set. Although it can be used as a makeup mirror next to the sink, it is too far away from the bathtub, and the entire screen area is too small, and because it is at a certain angle with the bathtub, if you want to watch TV while taking a bath, You can only turn your head to one side, which is not reasonable enough. In addition, there are two obvious shortcomings. One is that there is an obvious sagging in the wooden floor corridor at the entrance to the bathroom and cloakroom. In fact, hotels should pay more attention to wooden floors. If there is obvious expansion/shrinkage, they should be replaced in time. Secondly, the socket layout in the room is not reasonable enough. There is only one socket at the bedside, and the socket beside the desk is also unreasonable. It's easy to plug in. You have to reach across the entire desk to plug into the socket on the wall (and there's only one socket here), otherwise you have to plug into the floor next to the sofa. We had to charge our mobile phones at the same time, and there were three mobile phones at that time. It was very inconvenient when charging.

Let‚Äôs review the dinner and free drinks in the executive lounge together. For dinner, although the variety of food is definitely not comparable to that of the restaurant downstairs, compared with some hotel lounges, it is really attentive. There are several choices of vegetables and cheeses in the salad and cold section, while there are four hot dishes to choose from in the hot section. The bitter gourd-stuffed dace meat is delicious and creative. When I first saw the stuffed bitter gourd, I thought it was a Hakka cuisine that uses pork as stuffing, but when I ate it, I discovered that it was made from dace meat. On second thought, this also reflects the characteristics of Guangfu. After all, one of the delicacies of Shunde next door is hand-baked dace meat. It is stuffed with dace meat instead of pork. It is a fusion of Shunde cuisine and Hakka cuisine. The bitter melon is braised just right. It has a slightly bitter taste and goes well with dace meat. Next to the bartending area, there is also a freshly prepared area that provides soup noodles and meals. For the staple food that night, you can choose fish curd noodles and barbecued rice. I wanted to try both, so I ordered noodles and rice with my friends. After trying it, I thought the noodles would taste better than the rice, because the roasted pork in the siu-mei rice was still average, but the fish tofu noodles were both cooked well, both in terms of noodles and fish tofu. The noodles are made with Cantonese-style alkaline water, which combines with the umami flavor of the fish tofu, making it light but not bland. There will be a bartender stationed at the bar from 6:30 to 7:30, and you can let him make a special drink of the day (unfortunately, since I don‚Äôt drink, I can only choose a non-alcoholic mojito. It is made with grapefruit juice that day) , but after adding orange juice...it's so sour and sour, and no syrup is added, it tastes a bit choked, the taste is very astringent, not very tasty). Dinner ends at eight o'clock, followed by drinking time. In addition to drinks, fruits and desserts are provided in the lounge. Although the coffee is brewed by a coffee machine, the iced latte has plenty of frothed milk.

The breakfast the next day is worthy of a five-point praise. Breakfast can be taken in the executive lounge or the buffet restaurant on the first floor. We chose the restaurant on the first floor and recommend everyone to have breakfast on the first floor. One thing that must be praised about the buffet breakfast on the first floor is that there are four flavors of jam on each table, three of which are honey, apricot jam and cherry jam (because it took too long to write this review, I really can‚Äôt remember what the fourth bottle was). The advantage of putting it on the table is that there is no need to put sauces on the bread and snack stalls for everyone to help themselves, which is better from a hygienic point of view and convenience. Regarding apricot jam and cherry jam, I personally think apricot jam is more delicious than peach jam. Another thing worth praising about the breakfast is that it is very complete and has many choices, whether it is Chinese buns, dim sum, porridge, noodle soup or stir-fried noodles, or Western bread, pastries, salads, breakfast sausages and bacon. , ham, there are several options for each item. Although I wanted to try several stalls, because there were so many varieties, I ended up trying less than half of them. However, I want to mention the croissant here, not because it is delicious, but because it is unsatisfactory. The croissant was not crispy enough, and it was just hanging there without being illuminated by a fluorescent lamp. It was too soft and soggy when you ate it.
Lunch is pretty much the same as yesterday‚Äôs dinner, but the beef brisket pho is worth mentioning. I originally thought that the beef brisket would be too hard when stewed, or that the radish would not be tasty enough, but when I ate it, I realized that the radish was very tasty, the beef brisket was also very soft, and not too oily. The ratio of tendons to meat was just right, and it still tasted relatively fresh. of.

One more thing to mention here is the service. how to say? The services in the executive lounge and buffet restaurant can be regarded as "prompt response", but after all, there are many more guests in the buffet restaurant than in the executive lounge, so even if there are three or four waiters visible to the naked eye during the meal, they You also have to be busy guiding guests to sit down, clearing the table and taking away the plates. Although there are only one or two waiters in the executive lounge, because there are few guests, any needs can be responded to in a timely manner. If we want to talk about subjective feelings, it is "the service is in place, the response is timely, the language is very soft, and it does not make people feel overly enthusiastic or even intrusive." In terms of ratings, it would be full marks. (&The brothers and sisters are all very handsome/beautiful)
(I still have to interrupt, why does it feel like the more I write it, the more it sounds like a food review, hahaha. But to be honest, as an executive lounge, the meals provided are not only not perfunctory, but also very attentive and even present. The stalls they make are very worthy of praise. In comparison, some hotels can really only be described as "pale in comparison")
The hotel's swimming pool is a semi-open-air swimming pool, but because I didn't prepare any swimsuits and trunks, I just stood outside the glass and took a look, and I couldn't go in to see the environment of the swimming pool. But you can see through the glass that there is a single swimming lane in the middle, which should allow those guests who really want to swim to avoid friends who play in the water. This approach is still good.


Summarize:
Room facilities - highly recommended;
Room environment - recommended;
Exterior landscaping ‚Äì recommended;
Executive Lounge (environment & food) - highly recommended;
Buffet breakfast - highly recommended;
Service level - highly recommended;

last of the last! First of all, I would like to thank our friends who helped us and provided us with various services during our stay. First of all, I want to thank all of you whose names I couldn‚Äôt remember (I‚Äôm very sorry because I really didn‚Äôt ask for your names), including the handsome guy who helped check in, and the guy who helped us call the bar when the drinks were about to stop being served in the lounge late at night. Beautiful sister with two cups of latte; then thank you to Christina and Elsa, Coco, Amber, Kristen in their team, thank you! (I don‚Äôt know if you are among the friends whose names I have thanked above. If so, please forgive me.)

The SAP vouchers provided are exempt from the items that cost 1000-2000. I don‚Äôt want to use them at all. The little chef class and children‚Äôs program feel that the hotel has no sincerity and they are randomly placed in the same hall. In several projects, children learn to make cakes and pipe cream, and there are no aprons or sleeves. Parents have to keep helping to clean them up. Generally speaking, they will not choose them in the future.

Knowing that I am taking the children, in order to give the children a better experience, they also helped me to upgrade the room and send The chocolate cake and fruit plate that children like to eat are very heart-warming. In terms of hardware, whether it is a sofa or a bed, I like the comfort. The check-in and check-out in the lobby are also very smooth, and there is basically no need to wait. Due to the epidemic, I asked a lot of questions. I would like to thank you coco, edilisa, kitty, and amber from the guest relations depar**ent. I will definitely stay again and recommend friends to come!
Another small suggestion, there are not many styles of breakfast, and the taste is average, the children choose less, I hope it can be improved.

msg:The first time I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Guangzhou, I gave myself a staycation for the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. The entire stay was surprisingly comfortable and pleasant. From check-in to check-out, you can feel the thoughtful service of the old-fashioned hotel. The five meals a day in the executive lounge are really full of sincerity, and those with a budget are really worth adding an executive meal! Other swimming fitness and spa facilities are quite satisfactory.


üîîService: When you get off the bus, you can help with luggage and send it directly to the room. The check-in process is also very convenient and fast. When you call the service hotline in the room, you can also get a quick response. The service staff are very warm and polite throughout the process, making people feel very at home! Before leaving, he also gave me a mascot, a little lion. The little details are really touching.


üçÉEnvironment: The refurbished Ritz-Carlton suits my taste very well. It retains the original classic European style and is not boring at all. The decoration style is unique among several luxury brand hotels in Guangzhou. The advantage of the room is that the bathroom is really big and the partitions are reasonable. The bedding is very soft, which is very suitable for people who like soft beds. The small disadvantage is that the bed is not very big. It would be more comfortable if it was longer. The room has everything that should be there, and it was cleaned very cleanly, and I asked someone to help turn the night down that night.

The Ritz-Carltons in the cities where they currently live have not stepped on the thunder. It seems that the old-fashioned hotels still have their own way of operating. It's the details that best reflect the good and the bad.

The biggest dissatisfaction of coming to the Ritz-Carlton is the breakfast. I saw good reviews saying that the breakfast was good. I chose breakfast for two nights in Guangzhou and gave up the morning tea for two days. The breakfast I had was disappointing. The refreshments were probably pre-made dishes or at least semi-finished products. They were quickly steamed. The porridge was extremely bland and tasteless, and other dishes were basically useless. Just add some soy sauce to the soup noodles to taste. There were too few varieties. Overall, the room and service were good, but the details needed to be improved.

2. I changed the room and apologized for offering iced drinks, but it didn't provide any drinks when I left the store.
3. The invoice information has been registered at the time of check-in, and the invoice information is also required to be provided when leaving the hotel.
There is another point that I will not describe here. The above three points are already unhappy. The price of 1,800 yuan per night is too far from the current service. Season is not as good.

It was peak check-in period, but the front desk staff didn't keep me waiting for a room. The layout of the room is very good. There is a long corridor from the master bedroom to the door, which can isolate the sound outside the door. I don't sleep well and don't like light. Fortunately, the curtains in the hotel are very tight. Since there are many delicious foods in Guangzhou, it is recommended that the hotel provide an electronic scale for the room.

The hot dishes for dinner in the executive lounge of the hotel are the best in the executive lounge in Guangzhou.
The breakfast of chestnuts is the most authentic in Guangzhou. I think that as a luxury hotel in Guangfu, it should add more elements of Cantonese breakfast. Chestnuts are the best in Guangzhou. The variety is very large and very complete.
The room size is average, but it can be seen that the maintenance is good, and the luxurious style of chestnuts is also presented.
The turndown service is very professional, and the old-fashioned style is fully displayed.

msg:I stayed for two nights on Valentine's Day and was disappointed, so I gave it one star for the environment and hygiene that could have been three stars.

Let's talk about Ctrip first:
I regretted the price of nearly 2,200, which was 500 more expensive than **.
I am a diamond member of Ctrip and bought a super member;
I am an F4 member of ** and bought a money-saving card.
You should know that ** calendar rooms are counted as nights, and there are Marriott points.
Ctrip's tricky description made me mistakenly think that 5 meals were included, which was quite cost-effective. After all, the hotel's Chinese restaurant is Michelin and Black Pearl.
Dining location, Ctrip described it as inside the hotel, and I blamed me for being too naive. It is indeed possible to dine in the executive lounge, not in the restaurant, which is fine.
Ctrip described it as a fine dinner; the hotel described it as cocktails and snacks.
I blame myself for not seeing enough of the world and not realizing that it was actually an administrative benefit. I added a SPA coupon on the first night and a bottle of red wine and a piece of cake on Valentine's Day on the second night.
I blame myself for being confused by Ctrip's instructions. Otherwise, I could have just booked an executive room with a tower view and saved money for two tickets to the Guangzhou Tower Ferris Wheel.

Let's talk about the hotel:
I booked an executive room with a tower view and a river view in Guangzhou. You can see it from the photos. The window is small, and the curtains are used to block the window in the middle. When I opened it, I saw that a wall in the middle was used as one-third of the window.
The window is the layout of the hotel that cannot be changed. I silently told myself to forget it. Let's talk about the service.
1. When I checked in, I asked how to book the SPA coupon. The front desk told me that the executive lounge would help me, and then there was no more. When I left the hotel two days later, I didn't use the SPA coupon.
2. I ordered Earl Grey for afternoon tea in the executive lounge. My girlfriend said she wanted to have a sip, so I politely told the waiter to add a cup. He also said politely, I'll add some hot water for you. Hey, is this Tieguanyin brewed in a thermos cup? Add hot water? This is a tea bag. Do you still expect the bergamot to be endless? Do tea bags have to be reused? Service awareness, I can bear it.
3. It's time to stop. We happily went to Guangzhou Tower to ride the Ferris wheel. On the way back, we were looking forward to what kind of red wine and snacks would be served on Valentine's Day? When I opened the door, I was shocked. Not only was there no red wine and snacks, but even the room was not cleaned! When I went out in the afternoon, I specifically told the manager in the executive lounge, and his answer was don't worry, my colleagues will help you.
I exploded instantly, and called to ask why the room was not cleaned? Why was there no red wine and snacks? The answer was: Did you turn on Do Not Disturb? The skill of finding excuses is perfect. Did I take what I said in the afternoon as **? Moreover, there was a card hanging on the door for the waiter to open the night room, and there was a signature. It was obvious that I forgot.
The waiter came to clean at 10 o'clock in the middle of the night, and I had nowhere to go to the executive lounge to complain. I asked the girl at the front desk, can you ask your duty manager to come over? She called, but added that we have more guests today, so there will be some inconsiderate places. Are you looking for excuses again? So what if you have full rooms? Don't take on porcelain work if you don't have the diamond drill!
The duty manager needs to wait for a while before coming. Why? He is dealing with another complaint. It turns out that there are more than one person complaining at the same time! ! ! ! This is the level of this hotel.
The duty manager said that there was nothing wrong with what he said. He said that in order to express his apology, he would send me to the airport the next day. It was very late, and I was too lazy to care about it, and I didn't want to embarrass the duty manager. Forget it.

The next day, because I was too busy the day before, I left late. I almost missed the plane. On the way, I asked the driver if he could go a little faster. He politely found a bunch of reasons stipulated by the company, and then only drove 70 kilometers on the highway. "Safely" sent me to the airport.

Staying in a hotel, it turns out to be such a tossing thing!

There is a kind of service that has a good attitude throughout the whole process, but it will make you feel weird. Have you encountered it? This is called careless perfunctory.

The hotel is an old high-end hotel. It will be renovated in 2021. It is my favorite neo-classical style. The five-star service is first-class! The only shortcoming: maybe the occupancy rate during the Spring Festival is too high, and you have to queue for 15 minutes for breakfast. Fortunately, the breakfast is delicious and rich, and it is still worth recommending!

The only fly in the oin**ent is that there are some small details in hygiene that need to be improved, such as the floor-to-ceiling windows of the room and some grease stains, which should be left by previous guests leaning against the window, and a lot of dust and hair on the TV remote control. It is very uncomfortable to look at (maybe because I have a slight cleanliness), I wiped it off with an alcohol cotton pad, and it does not take a lot of time, so it is recommended to include these small details in the training of employees. Hygienic and clean.

msg:I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Guangzhou during the Chinese New Year. The service staff looked like advanced AI artificial intelligence and were very polite. For example, when I checked in, the receptionist knew that it was my first time to stay, but they didn‚Äôt tell me that I could have breakfast on the first floor. It was only told that the room type I bought could dine in the executive lounge. After I asked again, I was told that I could go to the first floor. They also didn‚Äôt explain the check-out time. It was only after I asked the counter that they said: Uh... you can help me a little or a little at the latest. I was half-checked out, so I was asked to check in and check out for a while. I was really dumbfounded. After being presented with two options, they helped me choose the worse one? I was asked again if I could choose 1:30. As for my previous group of guests, I don't know if they are members or have other methods to apply for late check-out, because he allowed them to delay check-out until two o'clock. This overall feeling is really not good. In addition, because I saw someone leaving a message on Ctrip saying that he had received a lion as a gift from the hotel, I asked what type of room you need to stay in or what conditions are required. He definitely replied that the lion needs to be purchased and will not be given away, but I said But I saw someone‚Äôs comment saying that he should be one of their premium members, okay~ So sometimes the comments from netizens still have to be considered carefully, as they may not be applicable to the actual situation. In addition, dining in the executive lounge is a normal high-end dining environment. The people who collect the plates are quite diligent, and they will remember that regular customers will greet them. Unfortunately, I am not a regular customer, and the plates are sometimes put away without saying a word, but there is one The girl was wearing a black suit, remembered my last name and preferences, and was much kinder than the others. There are not too many choices in the meal part, it is a relatively small and beautiful route, and it is enough to serve five meals a day. As for the overall decoration of the hotel, it is very luxurious, but it would be perfect if the room could be renovated. The room type I stayed in this time was a city view room, which can overlook the Four Seasons Hotel and Rosewood Hotel opposite. The night view is beautiful, which is the only reason why I don‚Äôt regret my stay. Since I can see the Canton Tower when dining in the executive lounge, I chose the city view room. It‚Äôs OK if you can‚Äôt see the Canton Tower.

Compared with several nearby luxury hotels, the view and room of ritz are not outstanding because the room is not a whole floor-to-ceiling window. Sitting on the sofa chair is always blocked by the window frame. Only standing in front of the window or lying in the bathtub can you see it. Expansive views. But our focus this time is the lounge. Although this lounge is limited by the size of the venue, the food or snacks provided are not so wonderful, but the quality is very good, and the service is also at the level of ritz carlton.

Secondly, the hotel's facilities and the taste of the Michelin one-star restaurant are both of extremely good standards. This added a lot of surprises to my trip to Guangzhou.

msg:This time I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, which my child originally chose among several hotels because he liked the car. My father and I felt that it would be the same wherever we stayed. It would be better if the bed was bigger, and it would be better if it had a child's bed. . This is my first time staying at the Ritz-Carlton in Guangzhou. The front desk receptionist is very enthusiastic. I once hoped to arrange a room in the Canton Tower but failed. When the front desk found out, they immediately upgraded me to the Executive Canton Tower River View Suite and moved all the children‚Äôs belongings there. , the service is in place üëç. The kids slept in the tent at night‚õ∫Ô∏è. Since we checked in on Chris**as Eve, we unexpectedly received a gift from "Santa Claus" when we opened the door the next day. It was such a surprise. It's very convenient for a hotel to give you a small gift, mainly because of the thoughtfulness, but I'm too easily bribed üòÇ. There are not many breakfasts that can leave an impression. The porridge in the hotel is processed in bowls and it is really deliciousüòã. When I finally left the hotel, I forgot my child's water bottle. The hotel sent it back by courier. Thank you very much. Nowadays, there are more trips with children, so it is still necessary to consider the needs of the family. I will definitely stay at the Ritz-Carlton again next time.

üßπSanitation: The sanitation situation is also pretty good! The cleaning service is very good, and the turn-down service is also very good!

üçÉEnvironment: The overall decoration still looks like you like!

üîîService/Facilities: I have always liked this brand. I lived there for two weeks before, and the meticulous service was amazing. This time I stayed for two nights, most of the time I still feel good, but there are some "surprising" places...

1) First of all, we must praise the front desk manager Zhu for his warm reception and carefully introduce the fun and delicious nearby. It is indeed much more convenient to play! grateful! There is also a special note before that a dehumidifier is needed, and it is also equipped for me, thanks!

2) This time the room was divided into a corner room. I accidentally found that the large window curtain next to the bathtub was not very shading. I looked at the window before taking a shower at night and I could see the outside through the curtain. I was really worried about privacy and asked the service staff. They said that it is single-sided glass, and the inside cannot be seen from the outside, but there is still a little concern about privacy. It is recommended that you can change to a thicker or shading curtain!

3) The bottom of the shower door may not be covered enough, and the shower head is hung to wash. The water flowing through the door cracks is like a small waterfall. The floor is covered with towels but it will still get wet. It should be improved! Avoid danger.

4) The stewed chicken soup for breakfast was completely cold. An uncle touched the pot and said it was cold. The waiter said that it was hot and I took a bowl. It turned out to be completely cold...I can‚Äôt eat it, I hope it can be improved. Quality of breakfast soup!

5) There was a capsule coffee machine in the room when I stayed two weeks ago, I am not sure why there is no welcome fruit in the room this time... I don't know why

I have always liked this hotel! Will come again if there is a chance!

msg:On the first day, I couldn't book the Canton Tower River View King Room, and I switched to the Canton Tower River View Twin Room. The next day, it was converted into a double room. I went to have a buffet breakfast at 8:00 in the morning and told the front desk to change the room. I promised to follow up. I called the front desk at about 12:00 and asked, saying that the room was still being cleaned. I packed my luggage, and then called the front desk at around 12:00 and said, I'm going out, just help me move my luggage to the new room, and they all said no problem, no problem. When I went out, I saw a big bed room next to it, which happened to have been cleaned. After shopping, but not eating, I came back around 2:00 pm to get a new room key card, and was told that there was no room yet. At that time, I felt very annoying. The more I thought about it when I went back to the room, the more angry I became. I asked the front desk to report it, but there was no reply for a long time. Even after contacting four or five times before and after, no one solved the matter at all. From 8 in the morning to 3 in the afternoon, all the good mood of the holiday was gone, and it was a big fire that the money was not going well. At this time, the manager said that he was cleaning the room, what to talk about, although I am not rich, who cares about the discount of hundreds of dollars? Maybe he really shouldn't dress like a blind man to live in a five-star hotel, and he forgot to show a few words in English to show his identity. In short, I was not in the mood to live any longer, so I refunded the room fee for the next day and left. The whole thing is like this. It's just that a very unpleasant thing happened to me in a very good hotel. I don't want to live in such a five-star hotel in the future. From 8:00 am to 3:00 pm, I confirmed with the reception 5 times for my room transfer(¬•1417/night), every time the answer was everything would be done and fine, still I got no transfer and be treated like air. Finally I refund and get right away. Maybe a good hotel but never friendly to people doesn't look rich. A very very extremely unhappy experience in 5 stars hotel!

üçÉEnvironment: Located in the CBD of Guangzhou, I wanted to live for a long time, because I am a py person and I haven't come too close, but now it's old. The room is not big, it was newly renovated in April, so it still feels quite clean. It‚Äôs a business hotel, unlike a resort hotel where there are many places for children to play
üîîService: The service is nothing to say, after all, it is a big old hotel. We only arrived at 12 in the morning, so set us to check out only at 2 in the afternoon.
You can participate in many activities, but I just stay in a hotel, so the experience is not enough.

During the one hour waiting for check-in, no one even gave a bottle of water; 3. The waiter at the entrance of the car did not know how to open the door; 4. I saw a service in the elevator Sheng pushed a huge luggage cart in the elevator. My buddy looked at me and said: Sir, wait for the next shift. Completely speechless... I will never live in this hotel again, and I also tell some high-end guests that if you don't want to be boring, there are many hotels of the same price nearby. The Ritz-Carlton Guangzhou is a disgrace to the brand.

Personally, I felt that it was five-star, not as fast and comfortable as the high-end ones. The hotel is very old, the decoration is very old and very old, the windows cannot be opened, the windows of the five-star hotel I booked for the first time cannot be opened, the smell of smoke is particularly strong when I go to the elevator to the floor, I don't know that the hotel does not distinguish between smoking floors The non-smoking me was arranged on the smoking floor. No one asked me. I only felt the pungent smell of smoke and the windows could not be opened. It was too uncomfortable. . When the child wanted to go to the bathroom while swimming, I asked him to ask the staff, a 4-year-old boy, because I am a mother, it is inconvenient to take him to the women's restroom, so he asked the staff where the men's restroom is, and the staff simply told After giving him the direction, there was no guidance, no guidance, the child slipped and fell on the head in the water before he got to the bathroom, and cried and cried, and then the staff came over! It is obvious that he will guide the accident in advance that will not happen, or if the accident will not happen even if the water on the ground will not happen, you have to wait for the child to fall before caring about it. I have lived in the worst five-star hotel.
