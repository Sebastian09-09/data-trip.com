msg:Before entering the hotel, the housekeeper had contacted in advance and made thoughtful arrangements. The hotel is hidden in the valley. When we drove into the store, the handsome and beautiful receptionist greeted us as if we were at home. As soon as we entered the lobby, the high-end design facing the water on three sides shocked our vision. It is fashionable and elegant, and the simplicity contains connotations. The lobby and the book bar spread their wings in the water, with small bridges and flowing water, lush green plants, and clear water. The environment is very beautiful. The guest room design has good privacy for single doors and single households. The room is large, with luxurious facilities and elegant decoration, showing quality. I heard that the room is fully booked. Looking out the window, there are mountains and water. In the drizzle, it is like a picture of the misty Jiangnan, which has a unique charm. It is worth taking pictures and checking in. The hotel prepares many activities for guests, and the meals are also exquisite and rich. Enjoy the tranquility here, enjoy the integration and coordination of nature and cultural landscapes, the hotel has thoughtful service, suitable for holiday leisure, entertaining friends, business negotiations and cooperation, or accompanying parents, taking children on family trips, etc. It is also a good place to live!

msg:The hotel is hidden in the bamboo forest, facing the water on three sides. The landscape design is very quiet and comfortable. It is said that the Shanghai designer combined the boss's original intention of architectural design with the integration of Hui-style architecture and Japanese garden design. Breakfast is served by the pool. The air is excellent and full of negative oxygen ions. The hotel park is worth a visit. One step at a time, the overall feeling is very comfortable, worth the price~ First of all, it is worth praising that the price is not raised during the holidays. We stayed during the May Day holiday, and the price did not fluctuate. In order to leave excellent memories for the guests that night, fireworks were set off, which was very beautiful. There is a hot spring in the hotel, which is a real hot spring. The overall hardware facilities and environment are very good, and there are free projects such as handcraft activities. Everyone in the team has very good service. Everyone also knows the various elements of the entire park very well. They will accompany the tour and explanation, and will take the initiative to ask for opinions. The response to the needs of the guests is also very timely and useful. If necessary, they will also help to collect and deliver them to the room in time. The management is operating attentively, and the a**osphere of being at home is greatly felt.

入住會有免費歡迎水果，免費下午茶，免費晚安甜湯，免費mini bar ，臨走還會送伴手禮小餅乾。

環境：名副其實的野奢酒店，特別野，酒店旁邊有小村子，如果想在村裡走走 要小心小狗汪汪叫。
餐食：酒店廚師做飯還蠻好吃的，餃子的味道也非常好。因為酒店位置太野了，是點不到其他外賣的，大家如果有其他想吃的東西 自己帶着點。

提點小意見：房間小冰箱不太製冷，電視暫時沒辦法投屏，夏天了拖鞋有點太厚了
