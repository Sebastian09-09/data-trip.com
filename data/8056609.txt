msg:A very comfortable hotel in every sense.

Environment and facilities. One person lives in a small western-style building. The height of the living room on the first floor and the bedroom on the second floor are both OK. I feel very spacious when I live there. The mezzanine pavilion is indeed cramped. There is a mini garden in the entrance hall on the first floor. It is very comfortable to make a pot of tea and eat melon seeds. The red wall and green plants outside the bedroom window complement each other, which is quite artistic. It is also good to look at it and be in a daze.
When the housekeeper introduced the check-in, he said that it was designed by the late master of Aman. My American business level is low and I can only see that the lattice door is similar to Yangyun. Although I can't see anything else, I still like it. The iron bracket of the window reminded me of the appearance of my home when I was a child.
There is really nothing in the public area. The library is very small, and the French restaurant is open to the public. There are a lot of people. The swimming pool over there is also very small.

Rather than saying that the service is good, it is better to say that it makes people comfortable. The housekeeper introduced a seafood food stall nearby that is very good. Staying in the hotel once also gives a bunch of hotel peripheral products. There are three luggage tags alone, and I am embarrassed.

Dining: I ordered room service for breakfast, which was average. I had the cheapest lunch at French restaurant, which was a decent French restaurant bar. The bartender at the French restaurant bar was the former chief bartender of the Ritz-Carlton, Xi'an, and was quite talkative.

The living room is divided into a reception area and a small dining room, equipped with a toilet. The back kitchen is locked and becomes a linen room. Going upstairs, the middle floor is a pavilion, which is used as an entertainment room with a mini bar. The master bedroom on the second floor is a king-size bed room with a bathroom and French decoration. The guest room is a twin bed room, and the bathroom of the guest bedroom is on the third floor. The highest is a steep staircase leading to the sun terrace. There is a library in the hotel lobby where you can enjoy refreshments. This hotel is not bad except that it is expensive, but it is expensive for a reason and it is worth experiencing.

The enthusiasm of every service staff makes people feel warm. During the stay, it rained one day, and the four of us took 2 umbrellas. Every waiter saw us and asked if we needed an umbrella in addition to greeting us. They would not turn a blind eye like the waiters in other hotels. They are also very friendly to children, and the toiletries and slippers prepared for children are of very good quality. Breakfast can be delivered to the room, and it will be delivered on time every day, and the attitude is so good that it makes people feel embarrassed! The breakfast is delicious, especially the beef noodles, my favorite! If I have the opportunity to go to Shanghai, I will definitely go to Capella again.

It was a semi-self-service breakfast. After eating in the restaurant, I ordered a room service. The design of the five-story building will be booked again next time I come to Shanghai.

It's quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle, making it very convenient to go out for a walk or ride a bike. Although the design of the small five-story building is climbed up and down, the functional areas are indeed divided very well. The sanitation and cleaning are good. Both bathrooms and toilets are smart and have heating functions. They are very friendly to friends who come to Shanghai in the winter. The audio-visual room does not disturb teammates who want to sleep. The light shading in the room is excellent and the sound insulation is very good. , it was quite quiet all night (but I don‚Äôt know if it was because there were few or no neighboring guests), which was appreciated by teammates who suffer from insomnia.

As for breakfast, I think it can be improved. Breakfast is a la carte service and can be ordered and delivered to the room. I went to the restaurant to eat, but my expectations may have been too high. I felt that the product that day was not at an excellent level, and the staff did not feel very busy. Why do I always have to ask for more tea? Haha...

On the day of check-in, I upgraded to a room type. I sat in the front lobby and ate snacks while checking in. There are five floors from the room to the top terrace. Each floor has its own functions. There are many drinks and snacks at the bar, almost all of which are free. The front office proactively informed that because the water pipes are old, turn on the water and wait for it to heat up before taking a shower to avoid catching a cold. It is very It's thoughtful, but in actual use, the water temperature and pressure are very good. However, people with limited legs and feet may experience some inconvenience. The breakfast on the second day was also a small highlight. Some of the ordinary traditional Shanghai dim sum were made to a high standard. The taste was a little less smoky but had a different flavor. When the service staff saw that we had eaten well, they kept reminding us whether we needed extra food. There is no special scenery around the hotel, but the hotel itself is rich in both hardware and software and is worth staying and experiencing.

Perhaps the expectations were too high, but after the experience, the flaws in the service were more vividly remembered: First, the doorman's service awareness. The hotel's door is not conspicuous, and you need to go to the side to enter. Various maps are located opposite the hotel, so you can't first check it out. The time is convenient for the doorman to judge the guests and provide services, which is embarrassing;
The second is the breakfast room. There is no guide and no front desk receptionist. I found it all the way and asked the staff to be seated. The breakfast food was not delicious and there were not many choices. Hair was found on the beef noodles and the juice was not fresh. Squeezed...

The experience of the old villa is very unique, the design has been given a retro trea**ent, and the accessories and minibar are also remarkable. Especially in the city center, there is such tranquility, and the experience of old alley villas is probably unique in Shanghai. However, due to the limitations of old residential buildings, there are naturally many inconveniences. To go to the bathroom, you have to go up and downstairs. One is on the first floor and the other is on the fourth floor. It is not suitable for people with mobility impairments.

msg:I stayed in three hotels in Shanghai this time, Aman, Capella, and Peninsula. I stayed at Capella for two nights. The service was great. From the moment I got off the bus and checked in, I felt very caring and checked me in. The front desk was a young man from Shandong. He is also from the north, which makes him feel more friendly. Later, there was some unpleasantness due to the hot water problem during the check-in, but it was solved quickly. All minibars and snacks in the hotel are free. Is there anything you need to add? Very timely, including the attitude of the aunt, the location is convenient and the transportation is convenient! I also made an appoin**ent at the spa. I was supposed to get off work at 10 o'clock, but because they waited for me until 11 o'clock, the staff finally worked overtime to help me do the spa. Thank you very much! I think I will still choose Capella next time. Except that there are too many stairs and may not be friendly to the elderly. Young people and children are definitely the first choice for accommodation!

The Capella Hotel combines classic Chinese elements with 19th-century French style. It is also The only all-villa hotel in Shanghai. Our family had a very comfortable stay during this holiday. I would especially like to thank Zhang Ning, the manager of the front office of the hotel, who is very enthusiastic and dedicated. He helped us solve everything no matter how big or small as soon as possible. The day of check-in was also my birthday, and the hotel helped us The birthday room was carefully decorated and a birthday cake was presented.

The dining area is relatively small, so you have to wait for a table if there are many people. You can call a room. Although there are not many on the menu, you can call a room as long as there is something in the restaurant. The only drawback is that each floor of the room has only one function. If you want to do different things, you need to walk up and down the stairs. This is fine for young people, but it will be more difficult for older people. The wine in the executive lounge can also be packaged, so you can really get everything you ask for.

The hotel's location, environment, room design, etc. are consistent with what other guests have described.
1. Before check-in, the cultural tourism officer will call to understand the check-in time and needs.
2. The day of check-in is the child's birthday. Arrive early, and the room has been prepared; the decoration is very beautiful, and many small gifts have been prepared. And arrangements are made for late check-out.
3. When checking in, there are staff serving tea and water.
4. Accompanied by a cultural tourism officer to the small villa, explain the history of the hotel and the distribution of the floors in the guest rooms along the way.
5. Dessert cakes, seasonal fruits, iced juices in the room, and all soft drinks, snacks and candies in the mini bar are all free.
6. Children's activities on weekends, with teachers explaining the history of Shikumen, playing alley games with children, and small gifts at the end of the activity.
7. The Capella Library is equivalent to the executive lounge, with snacks and drinks available 24 hours a day; afternoon tea and happy hour. All produce French restaurants with one Michelin star, and the taste is very good!
8. Although the hotel has only one restaurant, it is far better than several other hotels. Breakfast is served at the French restaurant with one Michelin star, and it can also be delivered to the room.
9. The turndown service is very serious, and the spare drinks are replenished in time, and small gifts continue to be given (it is really soft to receive small gifts).
10. All the service staff are enthusiastic and professional, and they will take off their shoes and enter the guest room, which is too detailed.
Meticulous layout, attentive service, thoughtful gifts, everything is appropriate and unforgettable!
The only downside: There is also a charge for parking for guests, although it is half price.

Escape from the joy of living in the city for a long time, the freedom of being away from books, mountains and literature, wandering aimlessly in a daze, listening to the sound of rain and the singing of birds. Perhaps only you know how precious and healing this happiness and quietness is. Thank you Capella for giving me a rare living experience, and thank you to Raven, the little housekeeper who helped me check in. She is cute, meticulous and patient, and responsive to all my needs. She saw me carrying a Capella bag and gave me a new one. , and it also helped me prolong my daze time! Thanks to Aaron, the concierge, for helping me answer all my questions in the library, and even gave me delicious chocolate! God, they are so nice. Thanks to Capella, the unique alley design helped me isolate the city and the bustling. It was the respect and preservation of architecture and culture that made this trip more intimate. Of course, I will come back next time I come to Shanghai.

In the room with more rooms, the bed quality is hard and not skin-friendly, there is little rain and hot water is slow to come out, the space around the toilet is very small, and the washlet comes out with cold water. Most of the above problems can be solved quickly after being raised. I didn‚Äôt want to leave a review, but I got a call from the hotel just after I got home, asking to return the big-mouthed monkey themed toy! Did the staff inform me at the beginning that it was only for display? ! Is there a sign in the room telling you that you cannot take it away? ! They didn't apologize at all when they told me to return it, so I can only think that I haven't stayed in this kind of room for too long and don't understand the rules. For all the above, I hope the hotel can improve and give other travelers a better experience, but I will probably not go there again. After all, Peninsula, Puli, and Waldorf Astoria are also very good.

The staff at the spa are also very good, the reception service is gentle and gentle, and the actual staff skills are also in place (you can feel that they have been specially trained).

5. Afternoon tea: Custard pie is delicious. The tea was okay, but not very impressive.

6. Please note: Spa products are purely plant-based and may cause allergies after use. I was so itchy that I had to take loratadine because I washed my face in time but didn't take a shower. So spa guests or guests with allergies need to consider this.

Summary: Will stay here again because of the high quality of room service.

msg:Capella in Shanghai Jianye does not know where to start, I think it has been perfected

I brought my parents to Shanghai for a city vacation, and originally booked a two-bedroom Shikumen villa. Later when I checked in, the hotel front desk upgraded me to a more advanced room type with three bedrooms. Probably one of the best rooms here.

check in
Three days before the check-in, the hotel calls to inquire about the situation of the guests and whether there are activities such as anniversaries, which can be arranged for us in advance.
When checking in, Mr. Bryan at the front desk was very professional and attentive, and the check-in experience was pleasant and very fast. After it was done, he took us to the room, and introduced us to each room and the history of the hotel in great detail from the inside to the outside.

Room
Entering the old Shikumen villa is first a small courtyard. Entering the room is two floors and two and a half floors. There are three bedrooms upstairs, and there is a living room, dining room, and a small reception space downstairs. At the same time, there is an audio-visual room on the half floor of the first and second floors, and a secondary bathroom and roof terrace on the second floor. Reading, drinking tea, chatting, drinking, this villa can accommodate all imaginable activities.

Life
The breakfast is a la carte buffet, both Chinese and Western, and every breakfast tastes pure and exquisite. In the afternoon, there is afternoon tea in the library. Snacks and drinks are very suitable for chatting with friends or reading alone. In the evening ceremony of the Michelin French restaurant, you can taste the cocktail of the day. Spa, dry steaming, and salt room in the gym allow the body and mind to recover very well.

Serve
In fact, compared to the hardware, the software is the more memorable experience here. The politeness of all employees, careful explanations and introductions, and even small chats make people feel comfortable. The level of food production is online, so that the quality of bedding and bathroom products cannot be mentioned from these many excellences.

design
There is nothing to be picky about the design, the overall feeling is slightly retro, but still modern, and it is very harmonious in the context of old Shanghai Shikumen architecture. At first glance, it feels very visually rich. After careful consideration, it is found that not only the interior decoration of the guest rooms, but also the types of materials and usage methods in the entire hotel public area are only a few. The designers have created such a rich experience with such restraint. I admire it very much.

citywalk
The location here is very happy for those who like to wander around the old city of Shanghai. There are countless parks, old Shanghai buildings, shopping malls, and online celebrity shops within walking distance. At the same time, the subway is also very convenient. It's just that the comfort of the hotel makes it less desirable to go out for a walk

From the courtyard filled with various plants after entering the door to the exquisite arrangement of various supplies in the room, we can see the design of this hotel.
The smiles of the service staff from the housekeeper to the receptionist in the lobby to the room cleaning staff show that the hotel's training is very rigorous.
Breakfast is made to order. I like this Shanghai breakfast. The soy milk and fried dough sticks are small wontons, plus a side dish, which meets my needs. In short, I was not disappointed when I followed the Internet celebrities to check in this hotel, and I returned with satisfaction.

I personally prefer a good hotel brand to enjoy a good level of service through the comparison of these days! I have to praise the Capella Hotel. The Bryan service staff who met at the door never left our smiles. They gave gifts to the children and took us to the room to introduce and visit. The service really compares with the ceilings of these hotels! Actively solve the problems I raised! And it worked out very well! The layout is very large and the vision is very high! Put the customer's needs first! Come back at 7.50 in the evening and go to the lounge to drink red wine again! At this time, a handsome ********* guy named Alex waited tirelessly for us. Not only did he extend the time, but he also stopped serving three bottles of red wine. He never disliked us and waited until 10 o'clock. Provide services! I really feel that when I went to Capella, Bryan and Alex provided us with too many memories! I think this is where colleagues should learn from! Bulgari can't compare to his service and standard! ! Shanghai Capella is too hot! Only after comparing can you know the difference! Thanks to these two service staff! Bring us good memories!

msg:In order to arrange a five-day, three-day parent-child trip in Shanghai for a family of four, I looked at dozens of hotels of various types. Facts have proved that Capella is worth staying indefinitely.
Environment: The hotel is located in the building complex of Shikumen, a century-old building in an international metropolis. This alone makes it a winner.
Facilities: In addition to the audio-visual room, the bathroom on the top floor, and the terrace, the entire villa has a total of 5 floors that can be used. There are two bathrooms on the first floor and the top floor. The living room on the first floor is very suitable for receiving guests and gathering with friends.
Service: Quoting a message from a friend in the comment area, "I think even the waiter who wants the stars in the sky can pick it off for me." I made up my mind to place an order just because of this comment. Sure enough, from the children's small gifts to the children's toiletries, to the 24-hour on-call service with a smile, everything is done with care.
Additional: The breakfast at the hotel's one-Michelin-star French restaurant is worth staying in for a breakfast. The quantity is not much, but the variety is rich enough, and the quality is considered to be high. Eating one meal feels like it can manage the day. The Michelin-starred bakery La Boulangerie next to the hotel is said to be an online celebrity bakery, and it must not be missed.

The hotel retains the outer walls of the Shikumen, and the layout of the villas is also preserved to a large extent. Each villa is a 5-story building, which is very interesting. I like these hotels with history and charm.
The hotel's breakfast is very rich, and it is cooked to order. The restaurant environment is very good, and the location is in the hotel's 2,000 French restaurant per capita. I feel that I have earned a French meal üòÅüòÅ The tableware and tea set are very beautiful. It is a German brand of villeroy Bach. The tea cup costs more than 1,000 yuan, so it is really pleasing to the eye.

The environment in Xuhui District is very beautiful. The streets are full of sycamore trees with traces of time, which is very artistic. There are many good French restaurants and cafes around.

msg:Compared with high-rise luxury hotels, I prefer unique boutique hotels, and Capella Jianyeli is one of them. Although it is also located in Xuhui District, Jianguo West Road is quieter and more everyday than the popular Wukang Road. The storefront facing the street is a row of shops full of foreign flavor, exquisite and low-key. Behind these shops is the hotel itself. The unified row-style Shikumen villas, red bricks and red tiles, are unassuming; and this typical old Shanghai architectural style is fresh and nostalgic, really unique! Although the layout of the hotel is semi-open, it looks peaceful and comfortable, with a sense of "escapism" that neither immerses nor escapes.
Matching the hotel's comprehensive facilities is their exquisite service: not overly enthusiastic, but considerate. This stay was in late March, and it was rainy, especially cold at night. The room service staff adjusted the temperature in the downstairs living room and stairwell to slightly higher than that in the bedroom, so that you can read a book downstairs in pajamas at night, or get up at night to go to the bathroom. There will be no discomfort. After getting up the next day, I folded the pajamas a few times and put them on the pillow. When I came back at night, I found that they were folded neatly! Moreover, after staying for three days, the small gifts given at night are different every day. So much so that I was thinking, if I live for a week, will the gift be the same again?
I am very grateful to the staff at the front desk, Thomas and Vicky, who put down their work in their busy schedules, patiently answered my various questions, and satisfied my curiosity about the past and present of Shanghai Shikumen buildings; I also thank sister Alisa of the room service, Meticulous and responsive.

This time, they can regain their childhood memories in Capella Hotel. It can be seen that they are really happy.
Dad is getting old and needs to take a nap every day, so he contacted the hotel two days before check-in to ask if he can check in in advance. The hotel not only agreed, but also learned that the reservation was for the elderly to celebrate their birthday. On the day of check-in, they specially handwritten a card and sent a strawberry tart cake. Bryan at the front desk on the day of check-in received us warmly. After knowing that only my father and mother had checked in, he left his contact information and said that I could ask him to do it at any time if I had any questions. After checking out, he also said that he would send me a small gift for check-in.
Whether it is hardware or software, the hotel is really at the ceiling level. It is really a once-in-a-lifetime stay experience that the elderly can recall. Thank you Capella Hotel for giving the elderly an unforgettable birthday.

msg:The remodeled luxury hotel of Shikumen, a characteristic building in Shanghai, can pursue childhood memories. Staying away from noisy places like Nanjing East Road, Lujiazui on the Bund, and being alone in a quiet and comfortable environment is the best choice for vacation.
       The single-family building is about 1/3-1/2 the size of the old Shikumen before. The three-story building is changed to the fifth floor with split floors, the living room and guest bathroom on the first floor, the bedrooms on the second floor, and the balcony on the third floor. Pavilion lounge and main bathroom. It's perfect for a private vacation or a small get-together. The facilities are basically satisfactory, but it is limited to the structure of the house. The air conditioner cannot be set too high, otherwise the room will be very hot due to the heat. It should be very comfortable in spring and autumn, and the balcony can also bask in the sun.
       The service wants to be perfect, extremely polite and professional, and any problem will be solved in the first time, which is really satisfactory. The gym is small, and the facilities are sufficient. There is also a constant temperature soaking pool, and a high temperature salt room. Steaming is good for health, which is quite unique.
       The breakfast is at Michelin one-star PG, a la carte, both Chinese and Western dishes, and you can add three dishes if you are not enough. There are not many choices, but the advantage is that they are freshly prepared, and the quality is guaranteed, which is very good.
       Very satisfying experience, I found childhood memories in the long alley, going up and down the stairs, patio and terrace, and pavilions.

For the first time, I have upgraded the room and upgraded the garden villa. intimate. Because of the short time, there is no time to experience other services of the hotel.
The villa has a total of five floors, the bedroom is on the third floor, the tea bar is on the second floor, and the bathroom is on the fourth floor. It is easy to get the wrong floor at the beginning, and you always go upstairs and downstairs.
The bathroom equipment is indeed a bit too "ordinary". The toilet is not smart, the bathtub is easy to slip, and the trash can next to the toilet is unacceptable because you have to get up and turn around and step on it with your feet to open it after using the toilet , very inconvenient, hope it can be improved.
It would be even better if a shoehorn can be prepared at the entrance.
The only French restaurant in the hotel, the taste is still satisfactory, that is, the set meal of more than 2,000 per person has a total of 6 side dishes, which is not enough for me haha, I always feel like eating more after eating. Next time it will be a la carte.
The hotel parking lot is not free, 15 yuan per hour for in-house guests, and 120 yuan for 24 Xiaoping. For reference.

Let me talk about the inconvenient places. The remodeled rooms of the old Shikumen house will indeed bring some inconveniences, such as narrow stairs, and the bathroom and bedroom are not on the same floor. It is a bit laborious to go up and down the stairs. Different people have different opinions! There are some problems with the door downstairs, and the door cannot be automatically locked when it is closed.

Ordered takeaway at night is also delivered to the room, which has surpassed many hotels!
Breakfast is a la carte system, both Western and Shanghai local styles are available. The taste is because üêë has no taste after eating anything.

First of all, the design of the room is very beautiful. It is very beautiful to take a photo casually, and it is very comfortable and convenient. It is as comfortable as at home. The children are happy to run around upstairs and downstairs! Secondly, the breakfast is really top-notch, everything is delicious, and the service is also very good!

The third is quietness. It is very quiet in a busy city. There are no crowded and noisy crowds or internet celebrities posing. It is an excellent escape from the world! The last is the very considerate service, every service and reception staff is very kind, making people feel professional and sincere!

msg:Good things: The location is absolutely the best location in the city center. If you want to take a walk in Shanghai, this is definitely the golden location. Changle Road, Anfu Road, Wukang Road, these Internet celebrity roads can be reached within 20 minutes on foot. Petty bourgeoisie coffee shops and Western restaurants are nearby, and you can get there in ten minutes by taxi.
The sanitation is not bad, the floor is refreshing to step on with bare feet, and the service is also in place.
The hotel's French restaurant is good. The breakfast is in the French restaurant. The food is delicious.
Disadvantages: The hotel is rebuilt from Shikumen. If you want to experience the living experience of Shikumen in old Shanghai, you can try it. But only one day is enough. Each room here is more than 100 square meters, but it is evenly spread over the fifth floor, the living room on the first floor, the audio-visual room on the second floor, the bedroom on the third floor, the bathroom on the fourth floor, and the balcony on the fifth floor. On average, each floor is about 20 square meters, and it feels aggrieved to live there. Especially with children running up and down is very troublesome. The room is dark and poorly lit. In fact, Shikumen is also Tongzilou. If you let the space design concept of a hundred years ago live in today, you must not be used to living in it. Experience it for a day.
The second is the hardware facilities. The decoration style is Chinese and calm, similar to Wanda Hotel. The decoration workmanship is relatively rough, and there is no sense of refinement. It's as if there is a threshold in the bathroom, it's really easy to trip. The bathroom brand used is also very common, duravit.
In short, it's good to experience Shikumen once, but I won't live there again.

Then I compared Amman with Capella in Jianyeli, and finally I was very fortunate to choose Capella. Already shared with my family on the day of arrival. When I met Jianyeli, I had read the book word for word. I was moved that there are still people who are willing to spend so much time and money to protect and let us walk through this past history. Whether it is glory or downfall, forgetting history means betrayal.
Its overall renovation and repair have made me deeply understand that every brick and every door is the cry of history and the commendation of time. They will become the most talked about topics in the 21st century in the near future. I'm honored to have been a part of the lifetime that created it.

Facilities: SPA, salt house, heated swimming pool, gym are all clean, private and comfortable

Hygiene: Such a Capella must make you linger like me

Environment: Privacy, refinement, and quietness are what I care most about when I am on vacation, and Capella has done it all.

Service: From the lobby to the room, from the SPA to the public area, the service attitude of every service staff is beyond expectations, including the cleaning lady in the room, the masseur in the SPA, Rose and Xiaoguan in the lobby, sorry, everyone's name I don't remember them all, I will definitely next time. üòÇ

msg:The Capella in Jianye is rebuilt from the traditional Shikumen building, which has a heavy sense of historical accumulation. More than 50 guest rooms are all presented in the form of villas, trying to restore the original Shikumen style. The facade is a little low-key, giving people a mood of "hidden in the city". Each villa has five floors, the first floor is the living room, the second floor is the projection room, the third floor is the bedroom, the fourth floor is the bathroom, and the fifth floor is the sun deck. The height of the living room and bedroom is impressive, and the sense of space is very large. The walls are in two colors of gray and yellow, which are bumpy and convex, which complements the color of the interior lighting, making the room full of vitality. In the middle of the boundary between the living room and the stairs is a decorative painting, with wooden design on both sides, with regular hollow patterns on it, which is stable and a**ospheric. The minibar is free and rich in content, and the afternoon tea cakes and fruits provided are of high quality. Breakfast is served at the Michelin-starred restaurant le Comptoir de Pierre Gagnaire, where French flair and Chinese charm combine to create a relaxed and elegant a**osphere, and the avocado toast is top-notch. The front desk staff are professional and efficient. The only shortcoming is that the service staff around the room should strengthen the communication and interaction with the guests, otherwise this is not in line with the positioning of a top luxury hotel.

msg:After staying in Capella for my birthday in September, I also booked Capella for my parents‚Äô wedding anniversary and my mother‚Äôs birthday. I contacted Mr. Zhao (manager) of the hotel in advance, hoping to arrange it for my parents, and at the same time, the old The wish to be with my nephew was announced together, so there was a decoration of roses on the first floor and a starry tent toy cabin between the pavilions on the second floor. That day, Capella required 24-hour nucleic acid testing. My mother did it early in the morning. If the nucleic acid report was not issued, I had to wait for the report in the front hall (very strict and safe). Unfortunately, Manager Zhao was not there that day, so I asked his colleague from Shanghai to accompany Gu Xi. Chatting with their parents, the familiar language immediately eliminated the strangeness, and after the nucleic acid report came out, they were guided to visit and understand the facilities in the room, as well as the spa, which opened a journey of surprises one after another. Special thanks to Manager Zhao and another manager (from Shanghai) for their meticulous preparation and patient and meticulous companionship and explanation.
It‚Äôs still the same service of taking off your shoes and entering the house. The arrangement of roses and ambient lights makes the parents‚Äô eyes shine (the old couple have never experienced such a ritual wedding anniversary); on the second floor, there is a childlike ceiling The light-up tent, which also contains Capella Bear, a picture book that children like, and a fire truck with many functions and strong exploration, are all children‚Äôs love. The baby listens to the insects in it, and looks at the vast sea of stars. Fell asleep, and slept very soundly.
The breakfast is French cuisine with one Michelin star, and Manager Zhao also helped us apply for a breakfast fee for one person. Although it is the second time to have breakfast here, but there are so many varieties, and some can't stop. Stairs and patios are still baby's favorite places to go up and down alone and have fun.
By the way, what is worthy of praise is that this time I knew that there was a baby staying, and I specially prepared a small toilet for the baby in the bathroom on the fourth floor, which is convenient for the baby to go to the toilet (fortunately, I was lazy that day and did not bring a portable toilet, which saves effort It's also worry-free), and a step stool for washing (the first time I came in September was a bath stool, and children need to hug the stool to wash). This is also very thoughtful.
Parents and babies spent a beautiful holiday with their grandchildren and children at Capella for two days and one night. Thank you Capella for giving parents a different kind of anniversary and birthday experience. It is a family that is suitable for the old and the small , Children and old people have a loving holiday retreat.

Capella has always been one of the few hotel brands in my mind that perfectly combines the seemingly unrelated words of local customs and luxury. This is especially vividly reflected in Shanghai. Compared with luxury hotels like Bvlgari and j, which have become popular due to Internet celebrity style in recent years, Shanghai capella is not inferior in terms of service and environment, but also because of its unique location, even if it is located in the center of Shanghai, it is also As if away from the hustle and bustle, in a paradise.

msg:During the Chinese New Year, my boyfriend came back to spend his birthday with me. Because he is in the housing construction design industry, he will always choose hotels with design characteristics when staying in hotels. I chose Shikumen in the old alley. And the basic restoration in memory.
I won't go into details about the hardware. After all, the price is here and it won't be bad. For 2 people, there is no inconvenience except that half a flight of stairs is needed to go to the bathroom. I like the terrace on the top floor, which brings back memories of going to the terrace to cool off in summer when I was a child. Such a room is very suitable for small gatherings with three or five friends. There is no sense of distance in the hotel, and there is a kind of comfort and kindness at home.
There are also many five-star hotels in Shanghai. At present, the service of this hotel is ranked No.1 in my heart. It may be blessed with nostalgic feelings, because my boyfriend thinks that this hotel and w‚Äôs service are both good and can be tied. . The check-in process was fast and it didn't take more time because it was a Hong Kong and Macau resident pass, which has happened at the Ritz before. Check-out is delayed until 2pm. This needs to be mentioned as an episode, because the lady at the front desk mentioned at the time of check-in that it will be delayed until 14:00, and then if necessary, you can ask the front desk to see the room status of the day. On the day of check-out, it suddenly rained and cooled down in Shanghai. We didn‚Äôt bring an umbrella. I also needed to change trousers and had to buy them from the rider. My boyfriend called to ask if the check-out could be extended, and the switchboard refused to say check-out at 2:00. Well, when I confirm the estimated delivery time of the rider, I will call in person, the switchboard will transfer me to the front desk, and inform me that my delivery is expected to arrive around 2:30. I hope it can be based on the room condition without affecting the hotel's sales and occupancy. , extend 1 hour for me. The front desk readily agreed.
There is a birthday note in advance, the hotel has arranged and presented a fruit tower, from the check-in to the birthday, the hotel sent a fruit tower for two nights, thank you very much. What makes me satisfied is that the breakfast can be delivered to the room until 12:00. Although it is a set meal, if you have other needs, you can also tell the switchboard. You must know that both of me can't get up in the morning to have breakfast... Here I can finally have breakfast
During the Spring Festival holiday, friends came to visit the New Year's party. The 6 of us gathered for takeaway, drinks, and barbecue. Although we ate in the living room on the first floor, there was a smell of takeaway barbecue left in the room at night, and a lot of garbage was created. The phone asked for a big garbage After the bag was cleaned up, I let the gang throw it away when I went out. After walking back at night, I found that an air purifier was also arranged. There are small gifts when turning on the bed, and my boyfriend likes it very much. Although sandalwood fans are special products of Suzhou, most of Shanghai Nannan had them at home when they were children. I asked him to take it home for Mommy. He kept the small mirror to be smug, and other small gifts, including the little dolls he gave away from the store, and the tea leaves he brought back to borrow flowers to offer to Buddha, and I kept only the scented wax tablets. I really like the smell of their aromatherapy so much. When I left, I asked the front desk specially and said that it was adjusted by the hotel spa. Unfortunately, it closes at 22:00. Every time we return to the hotel, it is after 0:00. If only there was a way to buy online
It was raining when we left the store, and the little brother who welcomed the luggage saw that our handbag was wet and told me that he wiped the rain off by pressing and gently absorbing it for us. So soft and detailed
Maybe because I have also worked in the hotel industry before, and I have a Virgo personality. Under the same general hardware and software conditions, I like to read the details. Overall, I am very satisfied with the check-in experience. I will recommend me to my friends and customers next time I stay. Will choose Capella

After staying here, I really love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Originally, I liked the high space, and I was curious about the pattern of Shikumen. It was a look at it~üßê
Curious baby ran upstairs and downstairs.
The living room on the first floor, the audio-visual system on the second floor, the bedroom on the third floor, the bathroom on the fourth floor, and the roof.
(Daily climbing stairs doesn't feel inconvenient after you get used to it?üòÇ)
The bedding is super comfortable, and the Diptyque shower water pressure hin selected as accessories is excellent~ and I saw the fresh air system! This is ok~üëè

In addition to liking the building/space itself, the service is also very good~
Every staff member I met was enthusiastic, proactive and full of smiles~

Finally, let's talk about breakfast.
The ordering system is unlimited, happy and full~
The quality of Miyi is still guaranteed~
(When you wake up, you can drink a cup of real. fresh grapefruit juice first, which is a fundamentally different feeling of pleasure than drinking a cup of rejuvenated/blended juice! Wake up to a good mood all day~)

Okay, no more talking, see you next time~

Children's decorations and small gifts for children are also good. Worth the experience.

msg:During the Spring Festival, I picked a good weather and my family to check in at the Jianye Capelli Hotel. The environment and service are excellent, the check-in in the lobby is very convenient and fast, and the service is also very nice. The book bar on the side is convenient for waiting for people or small chats, because I think that the guests on the side may disturb me, the waiter is very considerate and guides me to sit in other places and give small gifts. I stayed in the Shikumen Villa, which was private and comfortable. The room was clean and the toiletries provided were very advanced. Except for imported wine, all other soft drinks and snacks in the small bar were free. Small snacks and sandalwood fans, and a handwritten welcome card, the details are in place. The breakfast is in the hotel's Black Pearl restaurant. You can choose according to the menu. It is very comfortable without waste. There are both Chinese and Western food. The foreign foreman of the restaurant also specially came to say hello. The waiter is also very good. The only thing that may be difficult to adjust is that because the air conditioner is turned on too high in cold weather, it is a bit stuffy to sleep at night. It would be better if the temperature and humidity of the air conditioner could be adjusted automaticallyüåüüåü

The service starts from the call the day before check-in, and you can let us know if you need it. Check-in is very convenient, we sit and drink tea, we will handle it in a while, and introduce it in detail. Every staff member is very warm, thoughtful and meticulous.
When I called, he said that we were here to celebrate our birthday. As soon as we entered the villa, the door was arranged for us, and a cake was also given, thank you.
The 1st to 4th floors of the villa are very beautiful, and the 5th floor is a terrace. Although I have been in Shanghai all the time, this is the first time I have experienced the taste of Shikumen, and I like it very much.
Breakfast can be ordered, it can be a set menu, or a single order, there are Western-style, there are Chinese-style, delicious, worthy of being produced by Miyi.
The downside is that the hairdryer is heavy.
The hotel is quiet and low-key luxury.

msg:Capella Shanghai Shikumen Hotel is the top luxury hotel brand in Singapore. It is located in the golden area of Jianguo West Road in the French Concession with strong French style.
The hotel has floor-to-ceiling windows along the street, and the exterior is clear red brick. The villa rooms with excellent privacy push open the wooden door of the outer courtyard and enter the living room on the first floor. The hotel's thoughtful and thoughtful service has already set up the a**osphere and is festive. There is a guest guard in the back, which is very convenient for friends to visit. The audio-visual tea room transformed from the early pavilion is on the first and a half floors. The bedroom on the second floor is very a**ospheric and connected to the cloakroom. Through the window screen, you can see the red walls of azure smoke and rain. The second floor is a separate bathroom. A protected area, such a low-rise and high-level view is also quite open. There are receptions and libraries in the public area, and free afternoon tea is provided (lemon cake is refreshing and sour, brownie is rich and pure dark chocolate is sweet but not greasy).
If you come to Shanghai and want to experience the French-style old Shanghai, I recommend you stay at Capella. If you have a special day to celebrate, I recommend Capella. After experiencing a good life, returning to the daily life, the driving force is full, and it is a year full of energy and struggle!

msg:I received a phone call from the hotel the day before check-in and asked a few people to check in, whether it was an anniversary, what requirements, etc. I felt very intimate.
As soon as we got out of the elevator hall, the waiter immediately helped us with our luggage and let us sit in the sofa area. The waiter would help us to check in, provide tea and soy milk for the children, and gave the children a puzzle, and then took us to the room. The layers are briefly introduced, and it feels very warm.
The small room has been decorated, with tents, bears, toys, books, and starlight projection lights with music. The children are very happy. The aunt who turned the bed at night brought a lot of water. Seeing that the child had eaten a pack of potato chips, she immediately gave two more packs.
In the afternoon, I drank afternoon tea in the library. The breakfast was exquisite. The Shanghai breakfast I ordered, the shredded pork with pickled vegetables was delicious. The table has a layer of cushion under the tablecloth, the elbows are very comfortable, too intimate details, and the waiter irons the tablecloth carefully.
There are two sofas at the door, you can sit and change your shoes, and the slippers have been placed next to the sofas. The aromatherapy in the living room smells good. The plastic wood floor in the shower area will not have the cold feeling of marble. There are two different thicknesses of bathrobes. There is also a Mickey toothbrush cup for children. The capsule coffee in the minibar is well received. There is a small stool under the sink in the bathroom, which is very practical, and children can sit and change clothes.
When I checked out, the waiter saw me coming, he trotted over to help me with my suitcase, and was moved. The service here is perfect.
The sofa, dining chair and bedding are all comfortable, but the desk chair is not particularly comfortable.

msg:The service was excellent, every single staff member was very enthusiastic and did their best to meet all our requests. The location is also great, close to everywhere. Although the hotel only has French food, many takeaways are delivered to the door of the room. Except for the service location, it is basically unsatisfactory. The rooms are distributed on each floor according to the functional area, and everything is up and down, and the body has been fully exercised. The height of the audio-visual room is low, and the whole room is very crowded after the tent is placed. The air conditioner was adjusted to 16 degrees and the minimum wind power was obviously cold on the 1st and 4th floors, and hot on the 2nd and 3rd floors. Because of the temperature difference between the upper and lower floors, my daughter had obvious symptoms of a cold the next day. Due to the rain, the windows could not be opened, and the air conditioner was turned down. The room on the third floor was still very hot, and the whole family did not sleep well all night. I didn't understand that there was no Washlet in the toilet. The breakfast is produced in a Michelin French restaurant, only a la carte. Because we ordered 3 sets and then ordered some other meals, the waiter directly said that we could order more after we finished eating, but we were in a hurry to go back to sleep after eating, and he insisted that we ordered more. . . In fact we ate all but the bad egg rolls. Except for the restaurant waiter, every hotel staff we encountered was very nice, no matter the check-in or the room cleaning, they were very warm and attentive.

Under his introduction, we went to the quiet and peaceful Caoying Bookstore. This makes us feel that Capella Hotel is rooted in local culture. In addition to the excellent basic services, the awareness of building brand cultural connotations is also very strong.

The breakfast in Capella Jianye is more expensive than the average five-star hotel, but it is worth the money. Order system rather than self-service form, the variety of meals is small and refined, and the food is genuine.

During their stay, hotel guests can enjoy free refreshments and tea in the library, evening cocktails in the French restaurant, gym and sauna in the spa area.

On its downside, I think the kettle and hair dryer are a bit too bulky. As for the inconvenience of going up and down the stairs, and the slow heating of the bath water, these are the characteristics of Shikumen architecture, which can be understood and accepted. The temperature and pressure of the bath water is still enough, a little patience, the bath is quite comfortable.

The hotel has organized the Shikumen Villa in Jianye Li very well, not only the appearance, the details of the interior decoration, the supplies, and the facilities are very exquisite. But the most impressive thing is the service. When we checked in in the afternoon, the staff outside the hotel seemed to treat us as a large group of passersby taking pictures and neglected the reception. I complained a bit when I went through the formalities, and later the hotel manager took the initiative to contact me and apologize. He quickly sent some gifts and prepared a birthday cake when I checked out. I have encountered too many top-level venues in China, but the staff actually only want to send customers away, and they have no real sense of service and attention to details. I think Capella has done it, and I would like to recommend it to everyone.

The hotel is located on a very quiet road in Shanghai, surrounded by many beautiful western-style buildings from the 1930s and 1940s. The exterior of the hotel has both the charm of old Shanghai and some French style. We live in the garden Shikumen villa. The small building has four floors and is a very standard Shikumen house. Each floor is very distinctive. The furniture is very Shanghai style; the bedroom is not very spacious but fully functional, especially the bedding is very comfortable, which makes me sleep very well, who often suffer from insomnia. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the quality of toiletries and towels are very good, soft and delicate. The disadvantage is that you have to go up half a floor of the stairs to go to the bathroom, which is a bit inconvenient at night. Breakfast is served in the one-Michelin-star French restaurant next to the hotel. The quality is good but the way of ordering is relatively small. The hotel is first-class in terms of quality and service. If you have a chance, you will stay there, but it's a little expensive.

Before check-in, the hotel confirmed the relevant matters by phone, including the scheduled SPA time, afternoon tea meal time, etc. Since I made an appoin**ent for the SPA, I checked in early at about 1:30. The whole check-in process was quite attentive. A dedicated service staff led the check-in and gave a detailed explanation before check-in. It really felt a bit at home. Although the reservation is the most basic room type, as far as the service attitude is concerned, compared with another one, which is also platinum-rated, it is almost a sky and an underground. It is lifted 360 degrees and spiraled up to a thousand meters. More than!
The hardware level is no longer redundant, and it should be covered in other comments. The SPA experience is also great, and the price is below the average price level of each five-star spa service, but the overall spa experience is not inferior to the peers, which is remarkable. In the future, even if you don't stay in the store, you will have the urge to use his SPA.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about breakfast. Guests staying in the hotel can provide a free meal delivery service, and it can be delivered before 12 noon the next day. There are not many types of breakfast, but the taste is good, in the upper-middle level of the five-star breakfast.
If there is a chance, I still want to experience other room types. After all, there are not many hotels with special features and services that are always online.

msg:During the Shanghai epidemic, I booked this Shikumen Villa Hotel in the city center. I visited the nearby French bakery last time. I think this hotel is quite distinctive.

The hotel is located in the Hengfu historical and cultural landscape protection area in Xuhui District. It is the only all-villa-style urban resort hotel in Shanghai, with the "Shikumen" complex originally built by French real estate developers in the 1930s. A relatively low-key high-end hotel, you will miss it if you walk the road outside. It was also the Shikumen complex in "Jianyeli" that was discovered when the surrounding Yueyang Road fell on the street.

The hotel lobby and the library are together. In a small place, French furniture is placed in the room and Chinese artworks are hung at the same time. It is a close combination of Eastern and Western elements. In addition to the more expensive bottles of wine in the room, the other drinks in the refrigerator can be replenished, and there are many small snacks. I like the Capella Library very much. In-house guests can enjoy afternoon tea and Happy hour in the evening. The WIFI speed of the entire hotel is fast enough. The afternoon tea pastry cake is the same style as Le Comptoir de Pierre Gagnaire at the entrance of the hotel.

For example, the Garden Shikumen is in the front row. , It is still relatively close to the road, and it does not mean that the sound insulation is not good. It is just that the cost of the garden Shikumen is more than that of the Shikumen. Is it only the flowers outside the window or the door? There are more mosquitoes in the summer. I believe that there are not many people who will enjoy the flowers in the courtyard, and there will be no people who are not quietly blowing on the air conditioner and opening the window to enjoy the flowers.
The structure of the hotel is very simple. The first floor is the living room. The place is slightly narrow, but it is better than high. It looks good. The outside of the door is in Shikumen style. Open the door to enter the interior. It is indeed a large and luxurious decoration. There are pastries and fruits presented by the hotel. I believe that every room will have them. The hotel is doing well. The hotel turns on the air-conditioning control for each guest who stays in advance to make the guests feel cooler after entering. Open the door on the first floor, and the back It‚Äôs a locker, obviously not of much use, and then there is a toilet, which may be used by customers. It‚Äôs a simple toilet and wash basin. Go up the stairs to the second floor. It‚Äôs an audio-visual room. You can watch it. TV and projection screen, the hotel also prepared a comic book for us to look at in our spare time, which is very good, there is a cabinet next to it, there are free and chargeable drinks and wine, the refrigerator is all Free, tea and coffee are also free, the brandy above is chargeable. Then go up to the third floor, the master bedroom. The master bedroom has everything in it. It‚Äôs really good. If the phone is dead, there is a charging cable at the head of the bed. The hotel also has aromatherapy to help sleep. The TV can be rotated. Yes, it‚Äôs easy to watch. The hotel also has a radio to sit and listen to the radio. Of course, this is what Shikumen should have. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is very good and can also be delivered to the room. There is a menu in the bedroom. You can call and talk to the lobby staff. There is also a cloakroom and dressing table in the bedroom. It is very good and meets the needs of the hostess. The hotel handbag is a cloth bag, which is really good. I especially like this. It depends on whether a hotel is good or not. The key is to look at this bag. Usually paper bags, cloth bags are not particularly large, and they are short and wide. Love it! On the fourth floor, there is the bathroom. The washing is here. It is very good, clean and full of things. There is only one thing. I heard from the manager. Because the floor is high, it takes a minute for the hot water to come up. So please everyone. understand. Going up one level is the top floor terrace music. There are benches and a small coffee table on which you can sit. The weather is good, you can see the clouds and stars, and the hotel umbrella can be taken away. It is very good and humane.
Special commendation to Manager Li. Since the first acquaintance, he has solved the troubles of my annoying customer. He is a patient and meticulous and outstanding service industry worker. I heard that you will It‚Äôs a pity that Capella will get better and better if you have a good manager like you. I hope you will be in a new environment and everything will go well!

msg:We booked 3 rooms for 2 nights during the Spring Festival. At night, the air conditioner in the master bedroom is "dididi...". It took a long time for the staff to arrive on the phone, and I once suspected that they did not intend to come. If the repair is not good, other solutions will not be proposed in time. Several people from the engineering depar**ent are walking around the room, saying that he can't do anything if there is no repair person at night. No supervisor came out. It can be said that Shanghai Capella, "you" has no emergency handling ability. The child usually goes to bed at 9:30, and it takes until 11:30 to change the room. The child has been crying all night and has not slept well. It‚Äôs okay to encounter it yourself, tossing the child is really full of fire. By the way, after changing the room, the air conditioner still has abnormal noise, but it is not in the master bedroom, even if the bathroom is noisy.

msg:Capella Hotel is hidden in the prosperous magic capital, located in the "***" of old Shanghai. It is quiet in the midst of the hustle and bustle, low-key and luxurious, and pushes the most attractive Shiku gatehouse in Shanghai to the top of the five-star hotel. The exterior does not show the landscape, but the interior shows the petty bourgeoisie of old Shanghai to the extreme. Whether it is a Shanghainese or a non-Shanghainese or a foreigner, whether it is a couple, family or friends, if you have the conditions, it is really recommended that you take a look at it.
       It is also worth mentioning that the hotel received our handsome Russian guy, Anru (probably the lobby manager), who knew a lot about the old Shanghai culture. The introduction and reception made the guests feel at home....

msg:The red trumpet creeper hung all over the wall, and was knocked down by the rain on the stone slab of the yard. The damp air made the glass a little foggy, and the light in the living room gently showed through. Slippers were placed in front of the two armchairs at the door, and it felt like going home immediately after entering the door and changing shoes.
The guest rooms of Capella in Jianye are based on the townhouse Shikumen. The whole building uses staggered floors to arrange the functional spaces on different floors. The living room and bedroom each occupy one and a half clear heights of 3.2 to 3.5 meters. Therefore, although the width of the new-style stone library is slightly narrower, it has been transformed by Master Jaya. The height of the main space is quite comfortable.
The vertical space is a bit scattered and complicated, and the plane space is quite regular, which is also a major feature of the hotel rooms. The wall is decorated with wooden frames, and the furniture is arranged in a symmetrical arrangement. The bedroom, the audio-visual room, and the guest room all use Chinese elements. There is a movable rattan table in the middle, with embroidered pillows on both sides. It is quite relaxing to sit on it and have a cup of tea and a snack.
Before moving in, I prepared myself up and down. Because of the staggered level, you can walk six or seven steps to another room. It will not be as tiring as I heard before. Instead, there is a sense of novelty that continues to be discovered. Although sometimes I still have to reflect whether I should go up or down.
The only flaw is the toilet, which has only one basin. The size of the two adjacent compar**ents for the toilet and the rain shower is too cramped. In addition, the net height is only about two meters, which is really not open.
The favorite of Capella‚Äôs public spaces is the library. Pick a book, drink a drink or chat with family and friends for an afternoon. The library of Shanghai Capella uses bookshelves to partition the three-in space, which is closer to the scale of the library in Sanya.
The penetrating back garden connects the rows of Shikumen houses. The red brick wall covered with vines and various pink, blue and purple hydrangea are exquisite like a watercolor painting. At the ends of every two rows, there are tables and chairs that can rest and three cute pairs of birds. Hope to see them often in the future.
Let's talk about Capella's service. These days are during the rainy season in Shanghai. Every time they go out, the hotel staff will actively guide the vehicle to park in front of the lobby and hold an umbrella under the canopy where there is not enough space. For fear that the guests will get a little rain, they will take the initiative to take the umbrella. , The buckle is fastened and then handed over, ignoring that his clothes get wet. The box temporarily placed at the front desk, the staff took the initiative to ask if it was a fragile item, and when it was picked up, the fragile label was intimately attached and the bag was installed. Participated in the hotel‚Äôs tasting activities, the management also made a special trip to stay for a while and asked the guests whether they were satisfied with the activity. The heart-warming little details leave a good impression.

msg:"From the brightest star in the night sky" The quality of Capella is fascinating. After experiencing Capella Sanya, Shanghai Jianyeli Capella has been included in the check-in list. Before I checked in, I had lunch on Jianguo West Road. After walking a few hundred meters, I saw the number of the hotel. The gate is hidden in the buildings along the street, which is very low-key. There are twos and threes sitting on the table in the alleyway. This is the most common way of life in Shanghai alleys. It's just that the cigarettes and tea in your hands have become bread and coffee. This way of life without losing the exquisiteness of Shanghai is exactly the same as Capella gave me. It is the only all-villa hotel in the magic city. Living in a single-family Shikumen in 1930, it is a leisurely life in old Shanghai that is completely different from high-rise buildings. The concierge at the entrance led us to the main building of the lobby. The lady at the front desk was quite enthusiastic during the check-in process. The young lady in the library behind the front desk brought us a welcome drink and introduced us to the room after roughly introducing the hotel facilities. There was an introduction on the way. The approximate location of each business point,
Arrive at the door of the room and open the door to the living room on the first floor. Thanks for leaving without rooming at the front desk. In luxury brands, you should at least ask the guests if they want rooming. Each villa has three floors, with a total area of about 110 square meters. Small and warm is the deepest feeling I have ever lived in. "Dojo in a screw shell" is the wisdom of Shanghai's residential houses.
In order to make the living environment more comfortable, the formerly cramped and crowded layout of Shikumen was changed into the interior, and each floor has its own and clear function. For the ancient residential buildings, only use is the greatest protection. Capella has done a good job in this regard, which not only meets the needs of contemporary people for the living environment, but also retains the characteristics of the original building to the greatest extent, 1.5 mezzanine The audio-visual room is great. The bedroom is on the second floor. It is very comfortable. The toilet on the third floor and the small terrace on the top floor are all very comfortable. It's just a lot of effort to run up and down. This is also the happiest journey of exploration. Most of the staff are very enthusiastic and proactive, but in Capella, the standard must be higher than that of other high-star hotels. The lady who checked in at the front desk readily agreed to us delaying arrival except for not asking the guests if they want rooming. After checking out at 14:00, there was no update to the system. At 12 noon the next day, the front desk called to urge due out. When I went to the front desk to consult, the front desk staff also sat and communicated with the guests. For dining, the bar at the entrance. The bartenders in western restaurants and bars, men with short hair and floral arms are very polite and service-conscious, and the cocktails are also delicious. The next day I saw him in service again at the happy hour in the library, the standard gentleman manners. The afternoon tea in the Capella Library, which is equivalent to the executive lounge, is exquisite although not many ingredients, rich in books, and good service. The tableware for breakfast is also a highlight. Although it is not a buffet, the dishes are really exquisite. You can choose between Chinese and Western set meals, but the service staff is a little reluctant when adding orders. The coffee cup has lipstick marks and has not been washed off. I can understand this. It‚Äôs more difficult to wash off. After giving feedback to the lady in the restaurant, she said in a very common tone that she would change it to you. I probably didn‚Äôt inform the restaurant leader later. This is a very basic common sense problem. I can not talk about this on the spot, but it will reduce the customer‚Äôs awareness of the brand. If she will tell the restaurant manager, at least it can reduce the negative reviews if she is sorry on the spot. It is the restaurant, the GM and the guests at each table that say hello in a half-squatting manner to increase the goodwill. Every employee of the hotel should really take this as an example and serve with heart and not superficial. The SPA service is very good. The swimming pool and the gym are relatively small because of the small building. You can experience the floating warehouse. The room is very hygienic. Sister, it is very hard to do the room and turn down the bed. In short, if you want to feel the old Shanghai style, Capella in Jianye is a great experience. The above mentioned shortcomings are also based on my wish to make the hotel better.

msg:Very satisfied hotel.
During your stay in Shanghai, if you want to find a hotel in Puxi with good facilities, quiet, and Shanghai style, Capella is definitely the best choice.

Quiet in the noisy area, with complete facilities. Going out is the core historical district, convenient for shopping. After entering, there are Shikumen villas, with a proper Shanghai taste, and there is no problem with security and privacy. The four floors of the room have a loft, the living room, study, bedroom, and washing are on the first floor. If there are elderly people with inconvenient legs and feet, it may be a bit difficult, but it will not affect us at all.

Although the hotel garden is very small, it is very beautiful in time of the hydrangea blooming period. The breakfast is sumptuous, taking into account both Chinese and Western tastes. Afternoon tea is delivered to the room, the taste is slightly sweet.

The only flaw is that the service staff are too enthusiastic. During the afternoon tea chat with friends in the room, I came in four or five times, which was a little disturbing.

Will definitely come back to the hotel.

They asked me at the hotel door and asked me to go down, regardless of whether I had a suitcase or not. After going down, I moved it by myself. I almost fell down after looking for the entrance to the elevator hall for a long time... When I met a service person in the elevator, he didn't help me move my luggage in time. I didn't start picking it up until I got to the lobby. Deducted 1 star from these.

üßπHygiene: Overall good. There is a hair stubble in the bathtub. It should be men shaving or having short hair. I cleaned it again myself. Other places are generally good.

üçÉEnvironment: There are no chairs or sofas on the top floor and cannot be used. The wooden benches are very uncomfortable and fixed. It is uncomfortable to see the view. The other environment is not bad, it feels like going home. But the bathroom upstairs is too shabby, and is generally at the level of a 4-star hotel. Yes, five stars is not enough. Seriously affects the check-in experience.
üîîService: There is no service. No introduction is required when you bring it to the room. It is completely transparent later.
[Boss Recommendation] Between 3.5-4 stars, average, not very recommended. You can go and experience it. Aman is a bit far, otherwise it would be a better choice.

msg:It‚Äôs a great hotel to finally experience! Needless to say, the hardware is naturally very good! The three-story Shikumen villa is quite elegantly decorated! Before check-in, the housekeeper called us to politely and carefully inquire about our needs. When we checked in, the waiter greeted us warmly and helped us with the luggage. Check-in was very fast, and the welcome fruit drinks were very generous! Evian water and beer are free to drink! Suitable for taking blockbusters! Environmental services are all perfect. The price is quite expensive, but a villa is more than 100 square meters, and with the Shikumen elements, it is worth the money. What is a little surprising is the food. The library has afternoon tea and evening drinks, but the choices are slightly less, especially the evening drinks. There are only one or two types, and there are even fewer snacks to go with the wine. Fruits and free drinks are welcome in the room. The generosity of the drinks was a stark contrast. Maybe the hotel thinks that what is delivered in the room is enough for you to enjoy! Breakfast is surprising, it is not a buffet but a set meal, which is understandable considering the limited environment. However, breakfast is 316 yuan per person, and a seven-year-old child is charged half price. The set menu has few types and small portions, so the price/performance ratio is not high. Fortunately, the quality of the freshly squeezed orange juice is very good, the dining environment is very good, and the tableware is also very elegant! There are so many delicious food on Jianguo West Road, which probably reduces the motivation for hotel dining! It is said that the breakfast room itself is a Michelin French restaurant. There is no swimming pool, but there is a hot water spa pool in the gym that children can play in. By the way, there is a fee for parking! This is definitely rare in hotels. The fee is 30 yuan per hour, with a maximum stay of eight hours at a time, and half the discount for hotel guests, which means one stop is charged 120 yuan! ! It‚Äôs simply unbelievable! There are too many mosquitoes outdoors, but indoors are okay. It is recommended to strengthen outdoor mosquito control! Except for the above minor flaws, the hardware services and so on are all full marks. As one of the top hotels in Shanghai, it is really worth staying! ! Overall recommended, will consider coming again.

msg:Poor service, uncoordinated, sorry for the price. Epidemic prevention is the most stringent in Shanghai. The nucleic acid test done in the morning has not yet come out, so they are not allowed to enter, even if the results are within 72 hours. Zhongshan Hospital can enter, but they are not allowed to enter the hotel. We were forced to wander outside for four hours and wait for the results to come in before we were allowed in. Coming from Zhejiang, I was tired from driving all the way. I thought I could lie down in the corner of the hotel, but I insisted not to let me in. I have never been to a five-star hotel like this during this period of time. Is this the service attitude and level of a hotel that costs more than 4,000 a night? I think there are n kinds of disguised service methods that can satisfy everyone, but they just refuse! Row! Then I will reject you too, I won't enter your store in this life, it's okay! ?
