Unsure if it is the weather but the room is quite humid and has a smell to it which took quite a while to vent out.
A little inconvenient that you need to take the lift up to the lobby and another lift up to the room.
But in general, quite a good stay and location is convenient.

Located right outside the metro exit. Within 5-10minutes walk to major commercial areas.

Rooms are larger than normal and newly-renovated but there is no fridge inside.

Room initially felt damp with some hint of cigarette smokes but much better after turning on the air conditioning for several hours.

Overall ok stay but with nothing remarkable to boast.

The staff were at a minimum, the amenities written most of them weren't open like the gym, spa, restaurant( open only for breakfast) and the swimming pool was open to the public ( people who didn't stay at the hotel used the pool hence a lot of people).

There is also a subway entrance on the 1st floor, which is very convenient to go to the airport and the high-speed rail station. There is a Coast City shopping mall nearby, which is a one-stop shop for eating, with many choices. There is also a MixC around Hyde Hotel, which is less than 1 km on foot, about 900 meters. It is also a popular check-in location in Shenzhen. Next to it is the famous China Resources Building. The building is full of spring bamboo shoots, and the night view at night is also very good. There is also a Talent Sports Park next to it, where you can jog in the morning, which is very suitable for a morning jog partner like me. It's the best. Let's talk about the hotel design. The lobby is designed on the 13th floor East Building. It's quite large and the lobby is also very a**ospheric and high-end. The guest rooms are divided into single and double floors in the high area, which also avoids the peak of passenger flow and outsiders can't go up. It's very good, the bedding is comfortable and the room is very spacious. The front desk lady Xiao Liu is very attentive and helps to delay check-out. I will come again next time.

I was lucky to experience two room types. Different design styles bring different living experiences. It is worthy of being designed by a master. It is refreshing and refreshing. I was in a hurry for an early flight in the morning and left something behind. The guy contacted me in time to send it back. The rain is ruthless, but people are kind. Thank you

msg:Recently stayed at Shenzhen Haide Hotel and overall it was an impressive hotel. From the moment I arrived, I felt the warm hospitality and professional service from Miya at the hotel front desk. This attentive service made me feel right at home.

The hotel's location is very convenient, close to Coast City and Houhai subway stations. My room was also spacious and comfortable, the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was well equipped and clean. The hotel's environment is clean and tidy, making me feel comfortable and relaxed.

Overall, Shenzhen Haide Hotel is a very cost-effective hotel. I will consider staying at this hotel again next time I come here.

msg:It was my first time staying at Hyde Hotel, and I was not disappointed. The hotel is very conveniently located. There is a subway station on the second floor below ground, and you can go directly to the hotel lobby without leaving the ground.
The lobby is spacious, bright, simple and elegant. The front desk service is very good. The front desk helped me upgrade the business king room I booked to a room with a bathtub, and I could also see the sea view. When you open the curtains of the panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows, you can see the famous buildings of Shenzhen, Spring Bamboo Shoots and Spring Cocoons, as well as the sea view of Shenzhen Bay. The room is large, and with the sea view, it makes people feel comfortable.
Thanks to the front desk WEY for the great service. Helped me send sugar water to the room. I didn't have time to eat at that time, just in time to replenish energy. The sugar water is sweet to my heart, thank you!
It's a pity that there is construction outside the store, which is a little noisy. But it doesn't affect me to choose to stay at Hyde Hotel again~
Also, the breakfast buffet is great!

The hygiene was not done well. In addition, the glass windows were really dirty, which directly affected the view. It should be that the external windows were not cleaned regularly. The hotel is located next to the subway, which is very convenient. The facilities are also good and the price is moderate. The layout is not very good.

1⃣️Convenient location and transportation. Who can understand the excitement of taking the subway from Shenzhen North to the station when you are hungry and turning around to see the hotel sign?

2⃣️The candies at the random front desk after I checked in saved my life. After I entered the room, I called the front desk and offered sugar water that saved my life. After eating these two and resting for a while, I gathered enough energy to go out and go to Wanxiang next door to look for food.

3⃣️The attitude of the staff is also very nice~

If you have a trip to watch a concert in Chuncan, it is really convenient to choose this place. It is convenient for eating and transportation~

The front desk was on the 13th floor and check-in was a bit slow, but takeout was very convenient. I looked around and found two large shopping malls nearby.

The sanitary ware is Kohler, the floor-to-ceiling glass windows, electric curtains, and the double beds are 1.5 meters wide. Although the restaurant decoration and layout are also simple, it is clean, tidy and bright. The front desk and room service staff are efficient and methodical. It is very important that the hotel is in a good location, between Mixc and Poly Center, 500 meters away from each. I ate at Mixc at noon, watched a movie at Poly in the afternoon, and continued to eat at night. The subway is zero distance downstairs, and it takes less than half an hour to get to Bao'an Airport without traffic jams during the New Year.

- There must be a dedicated pick-up and drop-off location for the hotel. This hotel does not have one. It is really dangerous to pick up and drop off the bus on the roadside. ￼
- The hotel room must have a bathtub. This hotel didn’t have one. I even got wet when I bathed the baby￼￼
- The hotel needs to have a refrigerator, but this hotel does not have one in the room. We bought yogurt and found that there was no refrigerator. We called the front desk and a staff member immediately brought up the entire refrigerator. I was a little speechless￼￼￼￼
- Check whether the sheets and quilts are clean. A casual person cannot see it, but it cannot escape the eyes of a mother, especially when the bed is used for small children to sleep.
- Check in is best on the ground floor, the lobby is on the 13th floor￼
- The hotel must have a restaurant or a buffet with good reviews downstairs. The buffet was relatively average after reading the reviews, so I had no choice. However, there was no restaurant downstairs, only a convenience store and two coffee shops￼￼

The only saving grace may be the view￼. In addition, it is actually close to the subway station, but I don’t like taking the subway because I don’t like going through security checks and transfers and walking long distances￼

There are two of us staying, so it is reasonable to ask for two room cards. It is possible that I will go to have breakfast and my friend will go to enjoy other hotel facilities, but the front desk is very reluctant to give it and repeats that the room has a power card and we do not need two. Very stingy.

Trip.com platform service: poor, there is a site next to the hotel, trip.com did not mention it at all, there are pictures to prove it

Breakfast: The breakfast priced at 130 yuan on the platform can be eaten from 7 o'clock to 10 o'clock, but after 9 o'clock, only the leftovers of cold rice will not be replenished. They will be taken away at 9:45, and there are pictures to prove it.

Overall: Only the hardware (room entrance) reaches the 5-star level. The dim corridors and software (service level) are comparable to 3-star hotels.

About half of Nanshan District is doing repairs, right?

The location of this hotel is actually quite good. Shenzhen Bay Vientiane City is nearby and just walking distance away. Apart from this, it has nothing good about it.
The entire hotel is in a large commercial building. There are many messy shops in the same building. The hotel is divided into several floors. The lobby is on the 13th floor. It is really troublesome to go to the elevator. Don't book if you are afraid of trouble! !
If I hadn't come back from Shenzhen Bay Port to deal with it, I would have chosen this one nearby. I really wouldn't have chosen this one. I don't like this kind of hotel in the building. It's like a business apar**ent. There seems to be some kind of bar and restaurant downstairs, so I feel very unsafe!
The most important thing is! ! There is construction next to it. It’s such a late night! ! Everything is under construction! ! It's so noisy that I can't sleep at all. Unless you're really sleepy, there's no chance you'll be able to fall asleep.
There is no soundproofing at all. After leaving the hotel for a long time, I feel like I am hearing hallucinations. Who knows who has stayed there?

msg:It’s a five-star hotel but it doesn’t have a festive a**osphere, no one delivers takeaways, and you have to save on shower gel. I don't understand why it is considered a five-star hotel at this price.
Advantages: The location is convenient, the hotel is right next to the subway, and it is close to large shopping malls such as Vientiane City and Coast City.
shortcoming
Service: There are no staff to deliver food, and there are no robots. You have to use the ** software to pick up the food from the self-service machine in the lobby. When I buy fruits in the supermarket, I need to get a ** app. No service at all, not worth more than 700 per night
Shower gel: When registering for 2 people, only 20 grams of shower gel is given in total. Toothpaste costs 5 grams at a time. This hotel only provides 10 grams of shower gel for one person. Leading to limited showering and personal hygiene issues. As a five-star experience, the experience is poor.
Landscape: It’s all construction sites and dirt
Hygiene: There are traces of use and water stains. The traces are still there, but it is not a big problem.
A**osphere: Five stars but no festive a**osphere. It would be better to choose something else during the holidays. There is no facade either. The lobby is on the 13th floor. At 8pm there are still a bunch of men smoking indoors at the entrance. No one cares about it. You have to smell secondhand smoke while waiting for the elevator. Still five stars...sigh
Very bad experience

msg:The location of the hotel is convenient for travel. Houtan Metro Station is directly at the door, and it only takes 25 minutes to go to the airport. The hotel itself is located in the core CBD of Shenzhen, with all kinds of businesses around it. Shenzhen's most high-end business district, Vientiane City, is a 5-minute walk away. Shenzhen Bay Park and Talent Park are also a 10-minute walk away.

The hotel lobby is located on the 13th floor of the building. From the 13th floor, you can use the hotel's dedicated elevator to reach the accommodation floor. This arrangement effectively filters out crowds and provides residents with a private space.

The hotel room is very spacious, more than 50 square meters. The views and lighting are excellent. In particular, I need to praise the floor height of the room, which is more than 12 feet and 4 meters, which is much higher than the indoor height standard of ordinary buildings. The head space is not depressing at all!

The space is divided ingeniously, and the living room and bedroom areas are separated by the height of the floor. The bedroom and bathroom are separated by solid wood doors, and the bathroom also has a sliding door, which is equivalent to two doors. Even if one person uses the bathroom, the other person will not be disturbed in the bedroom.

The decoration materials and design are all high-end customization, and the doors and windows are all oversized. The entrance door is a new smart lock. The bathroom has a suspended washbasin, and the shower area adopts the most popular international black and white marble contrasting colors. Anti-fog LED double bathroom mirror. Open hangers are convenient for hanging clothes. So the switches have LED background light *****s and electric curtain controls. The bed is 2 meters long and has a suspended design. The bedding material is breathable.

The air conditioner has dual air outlets, and the room is also equipped with a writing desk, dressing table, coffee table, and even yoga mats for guests to use.

msg:Stayed two nights for a concert. Since this is written as a five-star hotel, I will rate it as a five-star hotel.

Facilities: The first impression is not good. Park the car to the 4th floor, then you need to spend time to find the elevator, wait for several buildings, and there are floor restrictions for the elevator to reach. It will probably be confusing to first-timers. And every time I enter or leave, I have to change floors on the 13th floor, which is very annoying. I didn't expect such a five-star hotel.
Hygiene: The room is clean and the facilities are good. However, when I entered the room, I felt a very strong smell of cigarette smoke. It was very uncomfortable and my throat couldn't bear it.

Environment: You can’t believe it. The lobby of a five-star hotel is not as good as the lobby of a chain three-star hotel. You can’t believe it at all!
    The thing I want to complain about the most is breakfast. I have stayed in hotels of all sizes, and this one ranks at the bottom. I deliberately paid extra money to buy breakfast. I have never regretted it so much. It was really speechless and the dishes were so few! The worst thing is that the floor of the entire restaurant is sticky. In a five-star hotel restaurant, this happened to me. I lost my appetite at all. For the cost of four breakfasts, I ended up eating one meal (in a hurry) You can’t help it with time, you have to eat). After I returned to the room, the stickiness on my shoes continued. I thought about how dirty the restaurant floor was. Really disgusting!
        
Service: The service is within a reasonable range. I only felt that the cleaners on our floor were very polite. Forget about the other front desks.

Summary: four-and-a-half-star charges, five-star banner, three-star service, and two-star environmental experience.

In fact, the core problem is that hotels do not cater to individuals, but many cater to groups. This leads to the aloofness and arrogance that the entire service exudes. Represented by Luana, an old employee even asked us to check out early, and it was like a repeater saying that we have to receive other guests today and you must check out 2 hours in advance. This is what normal service would say, next to it Kitty's employees couldn't stand it when they saw us. On the contrary, the attitude of the new employees is actually quite good.
Moreover, it was promised that we would have a room reserved for us on Saturday, but when we checked in, our house was given to someone else. I checked in at about 3:30 in the afternoon, and my name was not written on my badge, but I checked in through a new window. My house was immediately canceled without good explanation or communication.
Finally, overall, the swimming pool experience is very average due to the building construction. In addition, the hotel does not have a lobby, which is not suitable for personal travel options. In addition, the taxi location downstairs is not very convenient. But the attitude of the new employees is actually quite good, especially when I called to confirm in the morning and when I left. I hope that it is really those who are willing to work hard who can do the work, so that the so-called old employees like Luana, I believe the hotel will not be able to go forward in the long run. .

Although entering the swimming pool requires a $58 swimming cap, I think it is worth it because health is priceless.

I can't understand, why do you have the confidence to let me go when you take over the group, or call me at night!
2. There are 108 people in the hotel earlier, which is really Disney level. (It's my problem not to eat because of the price, I just tell you the level of everyone here, and judge by yourself)

msg:I stayed in this hotel this time mainly to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and stayed for two nights, but the overall experience was terrible. First of all, the hotel room is indeed very large, and the room is considered clean. Other than that, other facilities and service experience are very poor. One of the most worth mentioning is that the water in the bathtub is muddy yellow, and it is impossible to take a bath at all, which is a waste of a good bathtub. But the most irritating thing is not the sewage problem, but the guest relations manager surnamed Liu in the lobby who has a surprisingly bad service attitude. When we described the problem to her when we checked out, Manager Liu not only did not apologize, but also blamed us for not immediately reporting the matter to the front desk. He also mentioned that this situation occurs in rooms on higher floors, implying that we should accept this situation. We mentioned to Manager Liu that this way of answering is not like the response of a 5-star hotel. She pointed out that the 5-star rating is only given by a third-party platform. If we have any comments on this rating, we should directly put forward our opinions to the third-party platform instead of looking for her. So in the end we left the impression that the hotel staff are unprofessional, and it is hard to imagine that the manager who is responsible for guest relations is also of this quality. Finally, the swimming pool is completely different from the photos. You must wear a swimming cap when swimming in the water. If you don’t have one, you need to buy it from the hotel, so of course you didn’t enjoy the swimming pool service in the end. Originally wanted to celebrate a birthday, we didn't expect such a bad experience in a hotel of this price, which really made us feel sorry.

You can reach the hotel immediately from the exit of Houhai Metro Station, and it takes 30 minutes to reach the T3 Passenger Terminal Building on Line 11.

Not only helped us arrange a high-rise room on the 31st floor, but also upgraded and gave us 2 breakfasts! The room is larger than expected, and there is room to move around with two 1.5-meter beds. The swimming pool on the 12th floor is also nice. It is worth mentioning that the open-air bar opposite the hotel lobby has a particularly beautiful layout and is a hotspot for taking pictures!

It would be even better if there was a reminder that you need to bring a swimming cap when swimming. Because it costs 59 yuan to buy on the spot. Breakfast is also quite good. There is land outside the hotel so it is a little noisy. But there are food markets and shopping malls within walking distance. The location is excellent. It can be reached by taxi from Shenzhen Bay within 15 yuan. The hotel can be reached by taxi from the Safari Park for 50 yuan. I will consider visiting again next time.

Arrived at the hotel at three o'clock, opened the room and was dumbfounded. The room was not cleaned, the toilet was not filled, and the smell of cigarettes and alcohol permeated the whole room, which was very disgusting. I was very angry and went to the front desk. The front desk arranged for an upgrade to a sea view room, but it turned out to be a construction site view room. Four or five construction sites are under construction. Forget it, but the construction noise was extremely loud at night. From 10:30 to 12:00, I couldn't fall asleep. In the early morning, I packed my luggage and went to change rooms in my pajamas, but I had to transfer from the lobby to other floors. Wearing pajamas in front of everyone, carrying all kinds of miscellaneous things, changing rooms in the early morning, he died directly.

The front desk of the double bed room we originally booked said that it could not be arranged at first, but we insisted on it but refused to arrange it on the same floor (because two friends were returning overseas Chinese). In the end, we could only arrange a twin room on the same floor. The infinity swimming pool was not as cool as the hotel advertised. There were at least five or six construction sites around, and there were all kinds of grids, and there was no view of the Bay Area at all! Parking is not free either.

msg:It was the first time I stayed at this Hyde Hotel. I thought it was the same high-end hotel as other places many years ago, but I was actually confused when I arrived. In a shopping mall, the driver couldn't deliver it to the building and could only park on the street. As soon as I got the impression, I felt like I was about to step on a thunderbolt. The hotel lobby is on the 13th floor. The lady at the front desk who checked in asked me to wait. She hadn't finished chatting on WeChat on her mobile phone. It took her a long time to check me in. She started by telling me that I had booked a business king room with a view across the street. The building is under construction. It's not noisy at night, but there will be construction during the day. I suggest you change me to another room type. It doesn't depend on the view. I'm OK with it. As long as it's not noisy, I can make do with it. I spent half an hour checking in. In order to He apologized and offered me a fruit plate, which I accepted with all my heart. But the strange thing was that a plate with fruits was brought to me from the office, and it was not wrapped with plastic wrap. When I was holding it, there were some small tomatoes on the fruit. Running around with plates, I said I was really worried about the funny situation of holding my luggage in one hand and the fruit plate in the other, but fortunately the young lady said she would go upstairs with me and send me to my room, so it was handled properly. But a weird thing happened at night. I was out eating and socializing, and another girl in the hotel called me and said that I didn't pay the room fee and asked me to come back to pay. I was confused. I checked in and paid for the room with my credit card. At the same time, there is a credit card guarantee on the Ctrip APP. Why do you ask me to pay again when I come back from outside? I immediately refused and explained that I had already paid. The front desk said that you should show her the payment voucher. Oh my god, you The hotel should look for the credit card records and post receipts by itself. I am just a hotel guest. It is a matter of your hotel management. Do you need to bother the guests to go back and deal with it for you? The hotel management and thinking are simply incredible, which directly lowers the image again. Fortunately, it went smoothly the next day when I checked out and replaced another group of people.

To reach the hotel underground, you have to take the elevator, and the lobby is on the 13th floor. When you arrive at the hotel lobby on the 13th floor, you feel good. You will be greeted by the front desk staff soon, and the check-in procedure is fast.
Arrive at the room, the area is spacious, the decoration style is simple and novel, the window is very large, you can watch the view of the busy city of Shenzhen, and the extra large electric curtains add a star! Because I was anxious to go out to play, I lowered my luggage and left. When I returned to the hotel after 11 o'clock and wanted to take a shower, I found that the water was running continuously when I washed my hands. I called the front desk and a staff came to repair it in about 10 minutes. Minus half a star!
When I got up the next morning and made a cup of coffee on the spot, I found that the water cup was dirty, which was left by a guest's lips after drinking the coffee. If the water cup is not disinfected, please rinse it with clean water and wipe it with a sponge. Half a star.
The check-out procedure was quick, and the customer service also took the initiative to send balloons to the children. Of course, I did not forget to mention that I gave them five stars for the hotel.

msg:Come, come, see if this is a five-star hotel?
Is this the room standard of 1,000 yuan?
It's not even as good as the minimum supporting facilities of the Express Hotel.

The room facilities are damaged, as shown in the picture, five stars did not make me sick, and there is a serious lack of maintenance.

The phone in the room is broken, the door stopper is broken, the socket is broken, the hole of the floor drain has been cut for some reason and has not been installed, the anti-collision ***** of the door is also broken, and the wires behind the TV are drooping like intestines Note that the floor is made of the composite floor material provided by the Express Hotel.

This kind of hotel is actually marked with five stars on Ctrip?

In the lobby, the business license is too small to hang in the sky. The employee man in the middle of the front desk is soaring loudly to the sky. Anyway, the room card is ready, and you can roll into the room.

Not to mention the lack of room design, the lack of basic facilities,
There is no scale, no ironing equipment, and the kettle is so dirty that it looks like it was picked up from a garbage dump.

Even a roll of paper is left over from the last guest for you,
You don't even want to look at the crumpled two packs of coffee powder, do you dare to drink it?

This kind of service, this kind of facility, deceives consumers, not only regrettable, but also outrageous. A chain hotel worth a few hundred yuan has better facilities than your 1,000 yuan hotel. The so-called sea view, at one corner, has been blocked by many new construction sites. Even if it is not covered, it is not a good sea view.

I hope that Ctrip will strictly investigate the five-star rating of this Hyde Hotel and provide consumers with a safe channel for consumption and reservation. Otherwise, after consumers check the five-star hotel, such hotels will pop up and shoddy and harm consumers.

In short, pretending to be five-star, the facilities are old and not maintained, the supporting facilities are not complete, and there is no service.

When I arrived at the hotel at night, the lobby was no longer on the first floor, but on the 13th floor. So unique is what I want, without being disturbed on my off day.

From checking us in to taking the elevator, they are very friendly, which is different from other traditional five-star hotel services. The professional expression of the staff makes me feel a little more casual and relaxed. When it comes to the room, the personalized towel bunny is so thoughtful. The most important thing is the large space in the room and the big bed. I like the simple adjus**ent the most, and I really chose the right one , far away from the bustling city of my own, and came to Shenzhen, where I have been away for decades, I feel very good. I feel very comfortable as soon as I enter this hotel. It is like the relaxed feeling of a friend at first sight. I will stay again next time. I love it. Love it.

msg:The hotel is relatively new, the rooms are large, with a split-level design, a good sense of space, and the electric curtains are easy to use. The main disadvantage is that the lobby is on the 13th floor, and taxis cannot reach the hotel. It will be a bit inconvenient if you have large luggage. The water in the toilet looked yellow, and I thought it hadn't been flushed, but after flushing it a few times, it was still the same. I don't know why.

There is a serious traffic jam at the intersection. Taxi cannot park at the entrance of the lobby. It is very troublesome when it rains. There is no robot delivery service, and you need to transfer to the elevator to go downstairs. The low-end and mid-range office buildings have been converted into hotels, and the office smell is everywhere. I don’t know where the five diamonds came from.

It really lowers the hotel's standards. I don't look at the order. Then I asked these useless questions. Checking in from the front desk gave me a very bad experience, which really brought down the hotel. The overall experience is not very good. The water from the bathtub in the room is still yellow. Nothing can compare to the real thing. I have never stayed in many hotels like this. It is too irritating. The surrounding area is still okay, there are shopping malls to go shopping, you can go for a stroll when you have nothing to do, and the surrounding scenery is also okay.

msg:Did Ctrip misunderstand the definition of a five-star hotel? Samsung is much better than this! The room cost more than 1,500 per night, in a very dilapidated building, there is no door, and the signboard only has a word "Hai" on it. Check in on the 13th floor. As soon as I entered the room, I saw that the room was as empty as a blank room. The few furniture were the cheapest fake marble that can be seen on Taobao, and there was a big pillar in the middle of the side with the window. The bathtub is very abrupt at the door, and it is dirty, the plug is broken, and the water can't be filled at all. The toilet paper and hand sanitizer were all used (a roll of paper and soap is definitely new for a 5 star hotel). A coat hanger broke after hanging clothes, and the nails were directly exposed. The point is to find someone, the front desk and the switchboard can't get through on the phone! After all, someone came and wanted us to go to the front desk to wait for the room change. Shouldn't the guests go directly to the new room? The attitude of the person who brought it later was also very bad. It was supposed to help take the luggage to the new room, but he refused to say that he was very busy with work! Isn't it the hotel's job to serve guests? And later, I took the wrong room and went directly into the room I had already checked in. The room was full of other people's personal belongings! Can't live in this hotel at all! When we checked out, we kicked each other out. As long as I handed the card to the front desk, I had to wait in line for 20 minutes (during the process, everyone in the line scolded the front desk, which shows how bad the service is). After I checked out, I found that there was no Did not return the documents!

Wherever you touch, wherever you look, everything is fine. The new generation of Internet celebrity hotels is superficially checking in. The location of the hotel is very good, just outside the entrance of the taxi, and there are all delicious food nearby. The view is not bad, even though it is blocked, you can still see some sea.
The only downside: the shower head in the bathroom was a bit dirty and leaving the floor mat on the doorknob left me speechless. Hope to make persistent efforts to strengthen and improve this aspect.

The second bad feeling is that when I come back at night, I want to go to the partly ktv downstairs to have a look. I know more than a dozen sexy young ladies who seem to be looking for customers and keep going from the 6th floor to the 9th floor. The room is also the same 𨋢, but my 7-year-old Xizai watched the meat for more than two minutes. If I want to get angry, they won't hold the depar**ent 𨋢. .
So those with children really can't go shopping in the hotel at night.

There are two tables in such an empty room, and a small stool is placed, and a large piece of furniture is missing-the sofa! It's outrageous. I also called the front desk at night to communicate with the room, but no one answered. His front desk phone is just a decoration! No one will pick up at all. The environment of the building is also very poor, and the room rate is very expensive if it is not a high-end room! The sea view and the infinity pool are mentioned, take a look at the real photos taken! This broken room costs 900 yuan!

msg:A very poor hotel experience, definitely would not recommend anyone to go.
1. There is no air-conditioning or heating in the room. The room is still cold in such a cold January. Calling the front desk did not solve the problem. Is the air-conditioning panel in the room pretending to be happy?
2. The lighting in the room is dim. The most confusing thing is that I asked the front desk to ask for a floor lamp, and told me that there is no more. What's even more outrageous is that all the rooms have been repaired, so it was meant to be?
3. The attitude of the service staff was bad enough. It was obvious that the room tripped, and then we thought it was strange that the kettle couldn’t boil anyway. Finally, we sent a half-baked uncle who didn’t wear a uniform, pretending to be at the switch for a long time, and finally had a very bad attitude. The poor came to choke me and asked if I would use a hot water bottle, but the switch was not turned on. (What the hell? Am I a primary school student?)

It's also luxurious, don't be kidding, luxury is in terms of price, right? If you don't know how to open a hotel, don't open it. The facilities are half-baked. Will I get half of the money back?

msg:Apart from the relatively satisfactory check-in speed, there is almost nothing to praise. Seeing that the lobby is on the 13th floor, I feel that I have booked the wrong hotel. Sure enough, the tiles in the elevator are damaged, and the lobby is also a typical second- and third-rate business hotel style. Check-in is very fast, for fear that the guests will go back on their word. After changing the elevator to the room, it felt like no one lived on the entire floor. The room size is quite large, and the bed is not small, but the comfort of the bedding is average.

There is a construction site downstairs, and there is noise from time to time at night, making it impossible to enter. It is very strange why the hotel did not inform this information in advance.

The simplicity of the breakfast buffet is beyond imagination. There are no noodle stalls, no hot dishes, and no snacks. Only quick-frozen steamed stuffed buns fill the stomach. Extremely disappointed breakfast! !

After breakfast, I decisively checked out early. After a quarter of an hour of tossing, I got a wrong invoice and had to exchange it with the hotel by express.

The decoration of the room is similar to the home furnishings, with all hard floors, of course, the home is bigger. . Say it is a simple style, but it seems more simple. Just look at the room, the three-star is almost the same.

The bath is not bad, the water is quite hot.

The location is very good, just by the subway, the subway goes directly to the airport in half an hour, and you can walk to Vientiane City and Talent Park in 5 minutes, which is also very convenient.

However, there is a large construction site next to it, at least until three o'clock in the morning! ! The room is full of low-frequency noise. I can't sleep without earplugs. There is also an air conditioner. When it is turned on, the sound is loud, and it is also a low-frequency noise. I had to bring earplugs to sleep, which was the first time I stayed in the store.

Breakfast is said to start at 7 o'clock, and there is nothing at 7 o'clock. It was actually completed at around 7:15. Those who catch the plane early in the morning cry.

The most important function of a hotel is to sleep. When you feel unable to sleep well, please lower the star rating and price, and suspend the use of the room facing the construction site. The price of 750 is comparable to a four-star hotel, but it makes people unable to rest. The experience cannot be worse.

My little brother Vinson at the hotel front desk, thank you very much. I arrived at noon and many rooms have not been cleaned. The cleaning has not been reported yet, but I was in a hurry to make up and change clothes. He specially coordinated a room that had just been cleaned and helped me a lot. Busy!

This time I booked a deluxe double bed room. The room is spacious and tidy, without any odor. The decoration is simple and stylish, with electric curtains, power sockets and usb ports. The newly renovated hotel facilities are indeed convenient.
I must boast about the service of this store. Thank you very much for the help of Lola and the lady in charge at the front desk. Not only did I arrange the room I needed, and provided the hospital information for nucleic acid testing, but also helped to arrange the breakfast reasonably. I am skilled and thoughtful. , Really feel at home, a very pleasant staying experience

The room is very large and comfortable, but unfortunately there is no refrigerator and the shower water temperature is not enough, I hope to improve it.

msg:This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Entering a hotel is like entering a construction site. The room is considered a "site room" and the curtains cannot be opened (should be deliberate). Anyway, just sleep for one night. As a result, the noise of the hotel’s air-conditioning makes it impossible to sleep. Same. The waiter said, "All our rooms are the same, are you too hot if you don't turn on the air conditioner", what do you say? Isn't it too hot if the air conditioner is not turned on in summer? In the middle of the night, I can't bear to turn off the air conditioner to sleep, then wake up from the heat, and then sleep with headphones. It's also very noisy, and I have to play music. The mobile phone has a software to measure the noise, which is basically 70dB (what concept is equal to the noise of congestion on the main road).
Suggestion: If you haven’t booked yet, don’t book it. If you have already booked it, cancel it. If you can’t cancel it, go to the hotel to see and listen. If it’s what I said, please ask for a check-out refund. Don’t stay first, or you will suffer. No more, you will be told, "You have another plan, just to take advantage of it, you can't give it back. There is always a sound when you turn on the air conditioner. If you feel noisy, we will change the room for you, but it's the same." It is also the original words of the waiter! (Do you still have to fight with a waiter)

5. You need to pay several hundred deposits to check in. There is no refrigerator, and the deposit will be refunded after the room inspection.
6. The hotel feels like a farmer's house converted into an office building and then converted into a hotel.
7. Opposite the hotel is the office building, in fact, there is no view.

There are few reviews, this hotel really feels a bit too much. This hotel search ranks second. Ctrip is amazing. The price is more than seven hundred, which is not worth it.

After the TV turned on, there was no signal and I asked the engineering depar**ent to check it. It was messed up on the TV. Half an hour, it’s true🐮, I was woken up at 9 o’clock in the morning, and the room next door was actually being renovated and the electric drill was hitting the wall. My first reaction when I woke up was whether the neighbor next door was renovating the house again, and then I I called the front desk and said that the room next door was being renovated and it was very noisy. The front desk told me that the construction site downstairs would definitely be noisy. I said it was renovation work in your hotel room, and the receptionist replied even worse. Do you need to change rooms. Change my room early in the morning, you, the front desk, can't help but say such things, are you out of your mind? Ask the front desk to tell them to stop the construction. I don't know how the front desk communicated to them, it is still under construction. After 10 minutes, I called the front desk again to tell them that the next room was under construction, and told them to stop. The sound of the construction was very loud and annoying. It stopped after more than 10 minutes, and started again after 12 o'clock. I am really convinced of your hotel. Will others come to live if you do this?

msg:The attitude is very bad. The customer service at the front desk is very speechless. I checked out at two o'clock that day. When I went down, I told me that it was overtime. I said that I had to give him a good review and exempt me from the half-day room fee? ? ? ? Am I staying in a hotel for the first time? 1. If we are out of time, can we contact by phone? Is there no phone in the room, or did I not reserve my contact information? 2. I went down at 2 o'clock, not my sister who went down at 4 o'clock? ? ? ? 3. I asked twice and I said, is it possible that if I don’t give this good review, the deposit will not be refunded? The front desk said that I want to apply, I really laughed at me, but I said later, so be it, I would rather not have this deposit, I have to confess truthfully, she came to tell me that I did not say no refund! ! ! It’s really the first time I’ve stayed in the store so many times, I’m sending you home a long story (don’t call me, you don’t need to delete it)

I was also unlucky, the type of room I took was poor, and the view was poor. There is a rooftop outdoor swimming pool with a good view, but the supporting facilities are not up to date, and the lifeguards are often absent.

msg:The hotel basically has no sense of service. When you check in, the front desk keeps answering the phone. There is no smile during the check-in process. It is not professional. There is only one person in the entire lobby.
Hotel elevators are also not managed in a standardized manner. When entering the elevator, there are also construction carts and construction materials.
The parking lot is shared, alas, such a pricing, how can it match.
There are construction areas outside and downstairs of the hotel.
Only hardware facilities, no systematic hotel training, management, no service, is it still a hotel, at most a business apar**ent

msg:Very not recommended. The decoration taste is very heavy. And the facilities are at the level of an express hotel, not as good as Atour. The rooms are small. There is no wardrobe, just a hanger. The door faces the bed. There is no partition between the washroom and the bed. The lobby is on the 13th floor, and the first floor is very chaotic when entering. The shopping mall is like a construction site. It feels like it opened in a hurry without getting it right. Such a broken hotel requires a five-star price. The only advantage is that it is close to the airport. Get some sleep and leave quickly. I don't want to stay for a minute.

When the hotel was not full at all, the front desk called from 1:40 to urge check-out to 2:00, and made three calls in 20 minutes. I asked if it was a minute late and she said yes 🙂 How much? The half-day room fee is more than 490. . I laughed. How short of money is this? Then you can't wake up earlier? I was drinking and drinking next to me until 4 o'clock to check in. If you want to do this, you can call me earlier to wake me up.
Then I turned on the TV to watch the European Cup, but there was no CCTV. I called the front desk and the front desk said that if there is no, then there is no. . Why do you have one to 15 in the center, and 5+, but not 5? Don't the hotel itself feel weird! ? Anyway, I agree with this attitude. .
I'm never coming anyway

msg:這次住高級大床房，裡面的淋浴設備排水不佳，整個淋浴間排水不知道被殺堵住了，裡面洗到一變成個小水池，這還不打緊，水排不出去，就從旁邊的馬桶間排….可能這之間的防水也沒做好….，整個都留到外面…但終於知道為啥外面的洗手台下面還要做一個止水擋跟排水口了…. 另外，游泳池開放了，但當你遊在中間水道時，可以發現下方不知道啥雜質，一條一條的東西沈在泳池底下，游泳時，也可以清楚看到不知道是誰的唾液還是鼻涕，載浮載沉的飄在泳池的上方，實在是頗嚇人的，回去想要好好沖澡，淋浴間瞬間變小泳池…. 這回憶實在…

其次，前台經常不搭理人，在那裡一個問題要問好幾次才回復，要不是離出差的地方近，才不要來這個鬼地方！！！！！

首先，酒店的工作人員非常友善和熱情。他們總是微笑着迎接我，並隨時準備回答我的問題和提供幫助。無論是前台接待員還是客房服務員，他們都展現出了極高的專業素養和服務意識。

其次，酒店的設施非常出色。我的房間不僅寬敞舒適，而且裝飾精美。床鋪非常舒適，讓我每晚都能享受到高質量的睡眠。浴室設備也非常現代化，提供了一系列高品質的洗浴用品。

最令我驚喜的是酒店免費為我升級了房間，並送來了新鮮的水果。這種額外的關懷讓我感到非常特別，也讓我對酒店的服務質量更加印象深刻。

酒店的餐飲選擇也非常豐富多樣。無論是早餐、午餐還是晚餐，我都能品嚐到各種美味的菜餚和精心製作的飲品。服務人員也會推薦一些特色菜品，讓我能夠更好地瞭解當地的美食文化。

總的來説，深圳市海德酒店以其卓越的服務和出色的設施給我留下了深刻的印象。我強烈推薦這家酒店給所有來深圳旅行的朋友們，相信你們也會像我一樣享受到難忘的入住體驗。

再次感謝深圳市海德酒店及其員工們為我提供的獨特服務和美好回憶！

臨時決定帶小朋友出門旅行，離航班起飛衹有2個小時多點，隨便整理了行李就出發了。在機場時，因為航班延誤，所以開始訂酒店，因為有小朋友，而且睡覺很好動，以前哪怕2m寬的床都睡不好，所以決定選個大一點的單人床，結果看了一大圈，就海德的單人床是1.5M，事實證明，睡眠質量高多了。
酒店位置很好，實際走路到華潤萬象城和人才公園都很快，旁邊還有後海滙、保利、海岸城等購物廣場，後海地鐵站就在酒店樓下，出行都非常方便。
酒店設施一般，泳池不開。房間內部設施也一般，我們的商務房，沒做咖啡機、沒有小冰箱等這個級別酒店該有的，個人認為不應該。
另外，酒店大堂在13樓，不是在大樓1樓，這個需要注意。

msg:酒店位於後海站旁，F出口一出就是，酒店既B2層亦連接地鐵站，交通方便無懈可擊。房間很大，沖涼水夠熱。
酒店沒有正門，滴滴叫車要到樓下馬路旁。
早餐超級難吃，超級難吃，超級難吃！三星級都比它好吃，我第二天叫**外賣。Trip.com應該增加一項食物評分，好讓我給它一個”很差”。
床被很薄，問前台，他們說整間酒店的被都沒有多出的了。
地板牆壁很薄，都會聽到聲音。
最後，如果是喜歡看TVB的朋友，它什麼台都有就是沒有香港頻道。

地理位置沒得說，旁邊就是深圳灣萬象城，離後海地鐵站也很近。

酒店在一棟樓裡面，感覺有些嘈雜，服務和設施都很一般，沒有五星級酒店的檔次。

房間挺大的，視野不錯。但是只能說很普通了，夠不上豪華型酒店的水準。

總之，只能說中規中矩吧，住一宿圖方便的話是不錯的選擇。如果追求高品質住宿體驗的話，還是建議選擇Manderin Oriental 或者 St. Regis一類的酒店。

msg:客觀的評價一下這家酒店。首先不要懷着住五星酒店的預期入住這家酒店，因為他的基礎房型600多塊錢，也不是後海這個位置五星級酒店的價格。畢竟旁邊的凱賓斯基和木棉花都是1200+左右的價位。所以肯定是有着明顯差距的。
經常住這附近的五星酒店，預訂的時候看到這家酒店是新開的，這麼便宜，以為自己是撿漏了，但入住後發現是自己想多了。
先説好的:地理位置是很好的， 這點對於出差的人很重要。就在地鐵11號線後海站F囗出來就是，從機場過來非常方便，衹有4站，20分鐘。去福田市中心也很方便。
無邊游泳池雖然由於工地，從景觀上來講沒有想象的好，但是水質還可以，而且最重要的是有加温的功能，這次四月份來深圳，天氣出其意料的有些偏冷，但是由於游泳池有加温，晚上辦完事回來遊起來也非常舒服，所以這對於一個喜歡游泳的人來説非常加分兒，我遊了有一個小時。
最後説缺點。最大的問題是酒店從一樓到13樓大堂的過程中，需要與下面的那些店共用一個電梯，這樣人就顯得很雜，這一點是最明顯區別於其他五星級酒店客人整體檔次比較高的一點，也是最減分的項。高層需要到13樓轉電梯，這也導致從房間出來到大門口需要花費至少五分鐘，對於時間寶貴的商務客人來説，可能會體驗不太好。
另外就是服務，客房打掃衞生服務員都很熱情，有求必應。但是辦理入住的人員顯然沒有經過標準五星級酒店的培訓，形象氣質儀態都有明顯差距。感覺他們也盡力了，但是由於人員本身素質不行，以及培訓不到位，所以從這個角度上來講，給人的感覺檔次下來了不少。
總體來講性價比並不算低，這個酒店分數之所以不高的原因，我想是攜程把他歸為五星，六星豪華了，這樣在搜尋的時候，客人的預期就是五星以上，而且客人有可能大部分是習慣了住五星級酒店的，這樣的話從很多的細節上一下就能感覺到檔次明顯是不符合五星級酒店的。我一共住了五個晚上，是商務出行，剛到的第一天，感覺很失望。但是後來考慮一下這個價格，基本就是旁邊五星級酒店的一半多一點，其實也還是可以的。
所以總體來説，如果不抱着那麼高的預期，客觀的結合它的價格和位置，這個酒店還是值得考慮的。

當中有位姓許，應該是叫 Gina的小姐，態度佳，服務到位。我們登記入住時要求手機充電線，轉眼間她已派員送到房間裡。另，由於我們翌日要到另一個地方遊玩，她又細心解說使用打車app的方法。到了晚上，她還致電給我們跟進打車的情況，真的非常貼心。

是次入住海德，體驗甚佳，超推薦。

不過，前台的男士服務員差點意思，在明明有房的情況下，想用沒房作為藉口，不給我享受攜程給我的房型升級權益。

後來，我被我識破，反問既然沒房了，那為什麼攜程還那麼多房，能下單。
看着自己圓不了，就換了另一個女服務員來給我辦入住，同時也升級了房型。

酒店明知有施工情況，辦理入住時並沒有提前告知。
出差很累，沒有休息好。最後折騰了一通的解決方案是衹給了耳塞，但並不能實際解決問題。
酒店位置好，但是在寫字樓裏，彎彎繞繞不好找，整棟樓的內部環境也有點嘈雜。
總之，這個價位不會再住第二次，還是選擇品牌酒店吧。

唯一不太好的就是洗手池下漏水！保給前台後竟然沒人來查看，長期的漏水會破壞好幾個房間的，希望引起重視吧！


環境：樓下就是地鐵站，非常方便。酒店所在大樓停車場很大，車位很多，就是太陰暗了，有點可怕。

服務：前台小姐姐態度很好。

樓層服務員就有點差勁了，難道是深圳的優越感嗎？這一年多帶着孩子住了差不多一個月的酒店了，無論是大城市還是小城市的酒店，衹要是要求多給一床被子，服務員都會很友好很快速地拿來被子，現場套好！唯獨這一家的服務員一直強調自己很忙，九點多十點了，還很忙，套個被子的時間都沒有。第一次見！雖然理解，但接受不了這樣的服務態度。

第二，設施比很多四星的都差，無力吐嘈，上一張浴缸放出來黃水的照片，一整個噁心住了。
第三，這是最無法理解的，就是服務態度連三星級都沒有，浴缸放出黃水，打給前台，拖了半個小時才來處理，並且最難以置信的是居然全程一句道歉都沒有，what?
真的住過無數五星級酒店，也遇到過不滿意的，各種各樣都遇過，從來沒寫過點評，第一次寫。幫你們避坑。特別是女孩子住的，你不想晚上跟一羣酒鬼搭一部電梯的話，直接pass。真誠的建議，你們那些服務態度好好培訓一下吧，怎麼上的五星

msg:首先聲明，我是個很懶的點評人。視頻很實在了。

🏨酒店簡直就是地鐵上蓋 就在「後海」地鐵站
地理優勢特別突出

環境：酒店所在寫字樓也是新蓋的，還沒有特別多商家店鋪入駐，所以環境和酒店給人感覺很新。

結合地理優勢和酒店環境來説，6百多的價格，真的性價比很高。 

服務目前來講算滿意&衞生也挺乾淨的

因為這趟短暫旅行目的就是在後海附近走走，從酒店出來去附近的商圈都衹需要走10到15分鐘就到了，非常方便～

msg:臨時去深圳辦事，不熟悉南山就在攜程上按六鑽五鑽級別挑了這家酒店。服務水準極差，下午四點半到的前台 人很多 排了半小時的隊 告知房間還沒準備好 。再問等多久也不清楚 問能否把行李放進房間也不行 。最後説房間打掃出來會電話通知我 我也懶得計較就去辦事了。晚上吃完飯九點多十點到了前台拿房卡，又等了半天 跟前台發飆半天。一個女的職員態度很好 表示道歉又幫我把行李送到房間 還説要送我多一份早餐 被我拒絕了。

第二天早上九點半去餐廳吃早餐，一進餐廳就看見餐廳大部分的桌子都沒有打掃 全是用過的餐具

當時頭就大了 覺得一陣噁心 
本來要住兩天 回房間收拾行李 辦理退房。説要在攜程上申請。 跟攜程申請完了我就直接離開了。錢一直也沒有退我 給攜程客服打電話 客服聯繫完酒店説下午統一退款。今天都第二天了 也沒看見退款的提示。

msg:初四晚上入住非常不愉快的一次體驗
1.中午1點多前往辦理入住，被告知房間沒有打掃出來，節假日表示理解，待吃完飯前台人山人海依然沒有房間，直到下午六點還沒有打掃完畢，擔心晚上客人爆滿，要求給我們未打掃的房間放行李。此現象已經遠遠超過店家承諾的兩點前入住，因此耽誤我們半天的行程。晚上十點半回到酒店還有大批客人在前台等候，有鬧事客人阻攔前台為我們辦理手續，我們的孩子長者被迫在過道吃飯。整個過程未見酒店相關負責人出面協調。
2.預訂時稱房間為海景大床房，實際入住房間對面是在建工地，實屬虛假宣傳。
3.酒店客房部未計劃應急預案，房間打掃不出，銷售部門也未停止出售房間，導致大批量客人聚集前台，但是接待人員服務態度很好，很有耐心。

msg:海德酒店

在2023年7年15-16日期間入住深圳海德酒店，整個體驗都算是不錯，在以下數方面都有着良好的感覺。

在地理位置方面，可算是十分方便。海德酒店位於后海，一出后海地鐵站就已經會看到，地鐵站內也有海德酒店的出口指示，可見其方便程度。而從福田口岸過去亦是半個小時內的車程，十分方便快捷。其次是附近環境優越，四處都是大型商場，有着不同的娛樂活動如戲院、夾公仔中心等，亦有各式各樣的餐廳供選擇，如想去一些較遠的地方如海岸城、歡樂天地等都是約二十分鐘滴滴車程便可以到達。

在酒店服務方面，基本上都沒有甚麼可挑剔，處理着麻煩的客人，服務員都能保持着專業的態度。當日亦有一個加分位是check in時，櫃檯職員細心地詢問我們對房間有沒有要求，我們亦清楚地向她表示想住高樓層，她亦馬上搜尋系統空缺並安排我們住在21樓，這個小小的舉動幾窩心。

在房間方面，房間內的設施和基本配置都是正常，廁所、沖涼設備都是正常，花灑出水量都夠。美中不足的是室內氣溫一直保持25度，任憑我們如何調教冷氣，都沒有用，可能是我們不懂操作，抑或是冷氣系統有小問題都不得而知，因我們亦沒有就這個問題呼叫職員來解決，純粹是一個提醒，如果將來有住客有同樣問題，亦可以嘗試呼叫前台。第二件可挑剔的事情是電視聲音奇怪，未能播出最高質素的聲音，可能是入牆式的電視設計，令聲音像被遮蓋一樣，過度集中。房間衛生方面，都屬正常水平，沒有明顯的污漬，毛巾表面亦無污漬或頭髮，故此屬可接受範圍。個人用品方面，基本牙刷牙膏等都有，惟獨是沒有男士鬚刀，如果有鬚刀，就會顯得更貼心。

總括而然，房間地理位置優越，交通四通八達，房間內設備基本上齊全，亦屬正常可操作範圍，服務人員都是細心有禮，而房間空間感亦十分足夠，情侶、朋友或家庭入住都是不錯選擇，價錢比對下，當刻booking是Trip.com屬最優惠選擇，我是用約$700港幣便預訂到商務大床房，比起用內地網站用人民幣$700做booking更便宜。不過在前台check in時湊巧聽到有人即時到前台訂房，價錢是$708人民幣加兩人早餐，所以是十分便宜，不過有個風險是可能房間預約爆滿。總結以上，海德酒店性價比屬正常範圍，若要去短期兩三日旅遊，可以值得一試。

服務：同衞生一樣糟糕。1. 早上9點多出門的時候就把立即清理的燈亮起來，下午3點多回來房間居然還未清理，打電話給前台，前台才説讓稍等現在安排。2. 第一晚水喝完了打電話給前台讓多送幾瓶水，前台説送2瓶上來，我説再多給兩瓶吧，前台説多了是要收錢的，雖然最後多拿了兩瓶，但這個説法真讓人無語。3. 退房。退房時讓開發票，掃碼後提交了前台説訊息不全，我就問他標星號的都填了哪裡不全，前台居然也不知道，衹好又填一遍。這個時候也沒有客人 ，前台居然拿了一個信封出來直接説給你個信封你自己裝一下，也是很有特色的“自助服務”。可能這個酒店就是提供個床 ，什麼服務都要客人自己自助完成的吧。

總之不會再住了，主要是衞生，真是被噁心到了那坨在沙發邊的衞生紙

msg:差差差！5/27 凌晨12點 打電話去前台要個體重秤 因為第二天要坐飛機離開深圳 想要確保行李沒有超重，前台人員（男生）服務意識真的差！直接回答沒有！我不可思議的再問了一遍：“那麼大的酒店連一個體重秤都沒有？” 這位男生再次堂而皇之堅決回答“是的！” …… 隨後我找了客房的服務人員，卻説有的，並在3分鐘內就送來了…… 我想問問酒店是怎麼做前台服務人員的培訓的？謊話説多了以為是真的吧？

從一進酒店，我就被其豪華而寬敞的大堂所吸引，工作人員的熱情接待更讓我感到賓至如歸。入住過程非常順利，他們已經提前準備好了所有的東西，讓我可以立即進入房間休息。

我住的房間寬敪明亮，現代的裝修風格讓人感到非常舒適。房間設備齊全，包括一張舒適的大床、寬敞的工作區域，以及乾淨的浴室，這些都使我的住宿體驗達到了新的高度。從房間的窗户，我還能欣賞到深圳美麗的城市景色。

海德酒店的餐飲也非常出色。早餐提供了各種選擇，包括本地和國際美食，我特別喜歡他們的自製麪包和新鮮水果。我也嘗試了他們的晚餐，菜品美味，服務周到，讓人感到非常滿意。

總的來説，深圳海德酒店提供了一種超越期望的住宿體驗。無論是豪華的環境，還是專業的服務，或者是舒適的房間，都讓我對這個酒店留下了非常好的印象。如果你計劃來深圳，我強烈推薦考慮海德酒店。

以後肯定不會再住這家了，難得寫評論，希望大家不要栽坑裡。

msg:整體評價：0.5顆星
屬於這個價位中少見的軟件與硬件都很差的酒店
軟件方面：服務態度冷漠
1入住三天總枱，前台，服務中心的電話從來沒人接聽過，有需要衹能去前台找人。詢問為什麼電話無人接聽時，前台衹説一句“沒人接”再問就不搭理了
2怕冷找前台要個電暖器，去了三次才拿到
3明明網上可以預約增值税專用發票，但退房的時候被告知衹有普票，詢問原因就回復“衹有普票”詢問什麼時候有專票就説“衹有普票”

硬件方面：格局差、配套設施沒有
1網圖看着房間大是因為瘋狂壓縮衞生間的錯覺，恨不得可以坐在馬桶上洗臉，而且浴巾毛巾和馬桶平行，且緊挨着，蹲坑時浴巾甚至比廁紙離你更近
2下沉式客廳，台階上沒有放行李的地方，衹能提着行李來回走台階，考驗入住人臂力
3網上宣傳的有泳池，實際去到所謂的11樓康體中心會發現，都租給各種企業做辦公室和多功能會客廳了
4寫字枱就是個小茶几，老闆椅換成了餐桌凳，還是簡易的那種。沙發很硬，和坐在其他酒店的地毯上差不多
5不能加床（和上面比 這條可以忽略不計）

以上介意者慎入

大堂挺簡陋，地板很臟，入住排隊有些亂，各種工作人員和客户亂竄，着裝也參差不齊有的前台就一件襯衣釦子敞開；當晚前台處有非常濃的啤酒倒一地的味道，電梯早晚都有不同的異味。
服務、衞生：
辦理入住時查了一會説沒收到訂單讓退了重新訂，聯繫了攜程客服跟前台溝通了一會才辦理完成；入住後在房內看到他人的貼身衣物掛在浴室，跟前台説明後換了間房，結果另一間房一股濃重的煙味，又去了前台申請換房型，前台説可以但是是自願降級房間所以不予退費。
設施：
總得來説各方面都是挺差的，就當晚入住情況基本都是在附近喝酒後過來的，房間裝修硬件就是精品酒店級別類型，不會有鬧鐘音箱之類比較簡樸，地板也會不平整，空調風躁聲非常大，即使開到35攝氏度出來也是冷風；海景大床房衹有單個淋浴花灑，花灑水非常小，同時打開水龍頭水會更小，其中一條毛巾也有些臭味。
不到迫不得已的時刻實在不推薦來這裏，應該算是住過最差的酒店。
