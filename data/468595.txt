msg:Today I had an experience with the front dest customer service where they inconsistently applies charges to breakfasts. They never charged my son before and on this particular stay it is the Canton fair. Because of the influx of people they now decided to charge the breakfast fee. I phoned the front desk to explain and they just referred to their policies not listening to may complaint of inconsistency. Later he transferred me to a second person which the assistant explained the sitution. This assitant asked me “how can I help you” acting like he had no idea. His english competancy was not strong as he asked me to repeat and speak slower. I decided that after breakfast I will go down to sort out the situation. When I arrived at the front desk, they showed me the policies, again not caring about the distrust formed due to the inconsistency intill I showed them my previous payments and bookings on paper. By this time the front desk person (Luo) who has been speaking to me in English, stopped making eye contact, put on his mask and refused to talk to me. He called another person over to tell me I should please wait for the manager. I was very uspet by the way I was treated. The manager tried to fix the situation by giving us the “half price” breakfast off to keep me as a loyal customer. I am very dissapointed by their customer service and I am unsure if I will support this brand again after this experience.

In the morning, I found that I needed several paper clips, so I called the front desk and the problem was quickly solved. There is a small mall program in the guest room, which can provide some necessities 24 hours a day, and the delivery robot is also very novel and efficient. The hotel is in a prime location, only a five-minute walk from the US Consulate, and you can see the queue at the US Consulate from the hotel window. The hotel is opposite the Landmark Plaza, surrounded by many delicious foods, and the underground floor is connected to the subway and there are also many small restaurants. It is not difficult to walk slowly to Huacheng Square and then slowly walk to the Little Waist. I like Ascott because the serviced apartment feels like home. The room is equipped with a refrigerator, washing machine and dryer, microwave, dishwasher and kitchenware, including smart toilet, shower and bathtub facilities. The room is clean and tidy, I like it very much

First of all, the location is excellent. There is a semi-large shopping mall next to the hotel, with many choices of restaurants. There is also Landmark Plaza opposite, which is convenient for shopping. K11 is just across the overpass open-air park, which is also convenient for the elderly. We booked a three-bedroom executive suite. After the upgrade, the suite faces the Canton Tower. The beautiful view is really rare. Thank you very much. The service staff are also very friendly and cooperative. The most important thing is that when traveling on weekdays, you may feel a little surprised by the hotel room, but here it feels like going home, and even my parents feel at ease. I personally like it very much and highly recommend this hotel to everyone. In addition, there are some areas that I personally think can be improved. Since the hotel has been around for a certain period of time, it is acceptable to be a bit old, but it can be made up for in terms of hardware. For example, the lighting is a bit dim, which I personally feel needs improvement, especially Guest toilet, secondly, if there are multiple people staying in the three-bedroom apar**ent, it would be more reasonable to have a hairdryer in each room or at least two. Overall, I am very satisfied. I have decided to stay here again next time I travel. I hope the hotel can continue to follow up on customers' suggestions for improvement. highly recommend.

Toiletries are piled next to the water pipe under the sink (it is indeed a sink, not like a washbasin at all). It is the kind that is generally dirty. There is a cabinet under the sink designed to cover the water pipes. When I opened the cabinet, I saw a large water pipe, and then there were several toothbrushes piled next to it. There were some words taped on the side of the cabinet with transparent tape, which meant that toiletries were placed inside. . There is no dressing mirror facing the sink. The mirror is installed on the side. This is also the only mirror in the whole room. When washing, you need to turn your head 90 degrees to see this small mirror. Other equipment is also seriously aged, and it is basically the same as the floor level of the Ascott brand I have lived in 😂

msg:At first, I was worried that the hotel would be a bit outdated after being renovated for too long. After checking in, I found that there was no problem at all. The hotel thoughtfully prepared a check-in gift package. The service staff were warm and thoughtful, and the breakfast was good. Compared with the average five-star hotel, this place has more home-cooked food, so it is suitable for permanent stays. , ps, I didn’t expect that hotels in Guangzhou can also have spicy chicken for breakfast. The washer and dryer are a plus, perfect for traveling with the whole family. Surrounded by K11 and parks, the environment is very good. The disadvantage is that the children's playground facilities are old and small, which can only be said to be better than nothing. There is also a children's theater that showed Japanese-dubbed cartoons twice, including Zootopia. It feels a little strange. Overall, this stay was a good experience and I will come again if I have the chance.

When I arrived, I was told that because there were no two three-bedrooms on the same floor, I asked for two floors. This is a bit unacceptable. If not, I would not have checked in before. I should have informed you when the time came. I am very dissatisfied with this.
However, later the hotel also offered a free upgrade plan. Although we rejected it, we still recognized the hotel's willingness to solve the customer's problems.
The location of the hotel is good, there are a lot of food nearby, and you can see your waist in the room. In short, except for the initial unpleasantness, everything else is OK and fully meets the needs of a large family who need a relatively large environment when traveling.
In addition, I would like to mention that the security staff in the lobby are absolutely comfortable. They will ask you if you need any help. When we checked out, they had already taken our many suitcases to the underground garage and helped us. Loading the car was so touching that my family felt embarrassed. It deserves praise.

msg:This time I traveled with my relatives. There were seven people in total, including four adults and three children, including a baby. So I took a long time to find this apar**ent hotel, which made it easier for everyone to move together and take care of the baby.
        In terms of service, everyone at Ascott is very polite. We arrived at the hotel at around 7 o'clock in the morning, and the front desk helped us check in after the shift. One morning, our children had no appetite and did not eat breakfast because they were tired from traveling. I told the guy at the restaurant about the situation and took some food out.
        The hardware facilities of the hotel are quite satisfactory, but I personally think it is better than the apar**ent-style accommodation, which has a quiet environment and the guest rooms are large enough, with three bedrooms, one living room and two bathrooms, which is more than enough for the two of us. One of the three bedrooms is the master bedroom, with its own storage room and bathroom. Fortunately, the master bedroom can see the Canton Tower, which has a great night view; the other bathroom is a public bathroom, which solves the problem of many people going to the bathroom and taking a shower. To solve the problem of queuing, the kitchen is equipped with pots and pans, a refrigerator, a washing machine and a dryer. After washing and drying the clothes, they can be dried the next day, which is very convenient. The hotel has a gym, swimming pool, indoor children's playground, and a small children's swimming pool. Although it is small, it is still OK to play in the water. There is a small children's swivel chair slide and seesaw outside.
        In terms of geographical location, it is within walking distance to Canton Tower, Guangdong Provincial Museum, Huacheng Square and Metro Line 3.
        Overall, it was a good experience this time!

msg:Normally one would not give a negative review at all, but this check-in employee was a little outrageous. I booked this hotel because I wanted to book a 2-bathroom, 2-bedroom family suite with my family on a high floor and see the Canton Tower, so I made a note of the requirements for the guest room. The depar**ent also agreed. When I checked in, the employee saw my application and verified that I wanted a high floor. However, he said that if I wanted a high floor, I could only renovate the noisy room next door. For the sake of my family's safety, I agreed because there was a good view. When I checked in, I found out that the room on the 8th floor was not a high floor. Even so, I couldn’t see the Canton Tower at all (the three of them could be seen from the window) and had to endure the noise from the next door during the day because the trip was very long. I was full and my family was here, so I didn’t bother to change rooms to ruin my mood and energy. However, when I checked out the situation with this employee and just wanted to apologize, he actually told me that the suite room type was only on this floor. It was funny to me. Well, the building on the 23rd floor told me that suites are only available on the 8th floor, and it’s a Thursday. Are you fooling customers like this? If you tell me there is no one, I can book another hotel. You are not wasting your energy and time like this, so just When I told him that he would give a negative review, the employee told me that even if I gave the hotel a negative review, it would not have any impact on him. That was fine. I thought that you were still working as a front desk person at such an old age. Since I told you It doesn't matter, just feel free to give the hotel a bad review, but I have to say that the hotel is still okay, but I have such a smart front desk.

Environment: The overall environment is also good. There are fragrances in the lobby and outside the guest rooms (but the elders in the family think the air conditioning is too strong and the fragrance is too fragrant). The windows of the living room and two bedrooms face Huacheng Square.


Now that I’m satisfied, let’s talk about some regrettable experiences.
Health: Because we have to do business at the U.S. Consulate and considering the convenient transportation, we selected three five-star hotels closest to the consulate from the beginning. But considering the needs of my elders, I chose Ascott, the only one with windows. However, the apar**ent hotel is large in size and has many rooms, so I am a bit concerned about hygiene. The overall hygiene was passable, but the closet in the guest bedroom was a bit dusty. Then there was sticky and unclean stuff on the edge of the closet door. I wiped it all with a paper towel before I dared to hang my clothes in it. There is some thin dust on other corners, but those are not major problems. Then there was a hat left by an unknown tenant in the gap between the desk and the curtains in the master bedroom... Because the table was transparent, I could see the hat as soon as I pulled up the chair.

Breakfast: Before booking the hotel, I read everyone’s reviews. Many people said that the breakfast was average, so I didn’t book the breakfast-included price. I thought I would try it out at my own expense on the first morning. The additional breakfast is 159 yuan per person. In terms of variety, it is similar to some good four-star hotels and many ordinary five-star hotels. There are also noodle stalls. Unfortunately, it's not very hot. Whether it's porridge or vegetables, or even the noodles cooked in the noodle stall... they're not hot, just lukewarm. (The green vegetables next to white rice porridge and black rice porridge are even warm)

When we arrived, it was already 3pm check-in time, but we were still told to wait. I had an old and young family sitting at the front desk with their luggage and waiting. The front desk staff had poor service awareness and did not take the initiative to inform me about the breakfast floor and parking exemptions. The price was more than 2,000 per night and the standard of a 7-day hotel. I declined. !

Needs improvement: 1. The lighting in the bathroom is relatively dim. 2. Parking is the most speechless. I drove out halfway and was told that I would need to pay for it myself when I came back. In the end, I didn’t drive out and was charged when I left. (I’ve stayed in so many five-star hotels for the first time and encountered this situation. If you can’t afford the parking fee, just don’t.) 3: It rained heavily in the morning, so I asked the front desk if there were any umbrellas. ? The front desk just ignored me and ignored me. I saw an umbrella at the door and asked the front desk. The front desk replied that they didn't know. (Shouldn’t every room have an umbrella?) In the end, I got angry and the security guard gave me an umbrella (I only needed it for 10 minutes to go back and forth).
Service: Poor (small details reflect insufficient management)
8 electronic parking coupons (can be exchanged for 1 free parking within 24 hours): After driving out in the middle, you have to pay for it when you come back (I don’t understand, it is obviously free for 24 hours)
Environment: Older
fully equipped
Hygiene: very good

You can have a cup every day when you go downstairs. The coffee star thinks It's very convenient and satisfying. Then the downstairs of the hotel is Huacheng Square. At night, you can directly see the night view of Canton Tower. It's also very convenient to take a walk to Canton Tower. Visiting museums, IFC Center, and K11 are all within walking distance, especially suitable for children. The overall layout of the hotel and the service are very good, especially thanks to Sal at the front desk. From the first day I checked in, I felt the warm and professional service, so I stayed for four consecutive nights. I couldn't continue my stay because the hotel was full. , and it was also thanks to Sal who helped find a way to coordinate the room. A high-level, professional and humane staff is a big plus for the hotel.

msg:The Poet Service Apar**ent, Guangzhou International Finance Center

1. Hotel location: The location of Ascott Ascott is very good. It is on the upper floor of the International Finance Center in Zhujiang New Town. From the living room, you can see k11 and Gaode Landmark Plaza. The view is very wide. Downstairs is the Friendship Store, and across a bridge is Haixinsha Square. Guangzhou Library, Rosewood Hotel, Four Seasons Hotel, and Ritz-Carlton are all nearby. Fully meet the needs of walking and shopping.

2 Hotel facilities: The electrical equipment is Siemens brand, which is very comfortable to use, and there are many types, including washing machines and dryers, refrigerators, microwave ovens, induction cookers, ovens, etc. So as soon as we arrived at the apar**ent on the first day, we went downstairs to buy oil, salt, soy sauce and vinegar. When we didn’t want to order takeaway, we cooked things by ourselves and baked sweet potatoes. Don't worry about not drying your clothes after washing, just throw them in the dryer to dry and wear them. It is much more convenient than staying in the hotel Ascott.
After staying for so many days, most of the service staff are more professional. My favorite is the takeaway service upstairs! Generally, hotels will set up takeaway tables for guests to come down and pick it up. However, Ascott has a special delivery robot, or there are waiters who deliver it to the door. You don’t have to go down to pick up takeaways yourself, although it’s a small thing, it’s a plus!

The living facilities are complete. Ascott is very cost-effective in terms of location, facilities, services and price, so it is quite comfortable to live in.

The bathroom in the room did not even have a separate shower room, so I needed to stand Into the bathtub hope. I called the front desk and I wanted to change a room. The front desk said that it was very full that day and could not be changed. At my insistence, he said that he found a room with a separate shower room and asked me to go down and change the room card. The second room The room is obviously not an executive suite, the size is no more than 60 square meters, and the hotel customer service did not tell me this. Because it was too late that day, I didn't contact customer service again.
3. The hotel environment equipment is very old, the curtains are wrinkled, and each hotel location has a strong musty smell.

5. The handling of the hotel is also very chilling. I stayed in a hotel with more than 2,000.

msg:The location is very good. The nearby Huacheng Square is an excellent location to see the night view of Guangzhou, including the Canton Tower and the site of the Asian Games. The room is spacious, the price is reasonable, and the kitchen facilities and washing machine are all available. The housekeeper cleans the room every day, even when I hang After you sign the "Do Not Disturb" sign, you will also make a special call to confirm whether the room needs to be cleaned? Before leaving, I took a taxi, and there were two women with three large suitcases. When the driver sat firmly on the Diaoyutai and did not help, two security guards at the door took the initiative to help with the suitcases. Very moving!

After talking about the praise, I have to say some shortcomings: first, it may be built a bit early, and the facilities are a bit old and need to be updated. For example, the bathroom of the one-bedroom room is designed with a bathtub, and the length of the hand-held shower is too short, so it is fixed on the wall. The upper height is not enough, you need to lower your head to take a shower; second, during the breakfast on July 4, the female chef at the noodle shop stall had a bad attitude. When the 17-year-old girl politely asked whether the rice noodles she just ordered were cooked, she replied impatiently in a scolding tone : "No good! Come back later!" On the other hand, foreigners will take the initiative to smile and ask what they need? This point was also mentioned in the previous comments. In what age, shouldn’t it be a basic business etiquette to treat guests equally?

But the flaws are not hidden, it is still a very recommended accommodation!

A few points, 1. The things prepared in the room are not complete. It is likely that the two suites are for a family of 3-4 people, but the toothbrushes and other toiletries are not complete, and only 2 sets of bathrobes are prepared. 2. Hot water is a problem. After the bathtub is full, it is prompted that it will take 20 minutes to use hot water. Few hotels have this. 3. The door of the small bedroom is closed at night. If there is wind, there will be noise. It should be because the door is not tight. I am sensitive to sound and I have to deal with it several times. 4. The front ** is stiff and expressionless. I think it is not qualified if it is counted as a hotel front desk.

Brother Ivan was patient and meticulous, and took the trouble to introduce us to the hotel facilities and surrounding routes. The room was also arranged properly and comfortably for us. We were very satisfied. After checking in, we were asked if we were satisfied with the room. We were satisfied even if we were not satisfied with such enthusiasm. Another surprise is that the children's gift packs and robot delivery are the same in the lobby, and there is also a mailbox to send postcards, which is very good. It was a worthwhile trip!

It’s my first time staying here because I’m afraid the room is not good, so I only booked one room. I’ll feel it first. I’ve made a note to travel with children. I hope I can arrange a better view. The lady at the front desk contacted me that day and said that she saw my note and gave me an upgrade. After entering the room, the scenery is amazing, and I am so happy to fly. Decisively stayed for another two nights.

The room is big and clean, and there are free cookies and coffee. Robot delivery is also super convenient. Washing machine, microwave, refrigerator, cooker and utensils are all available. It is not too convenient to take a taxi and go to the scenic spots. It's really suitable for family outings!

It should be noted that smoking is not allowed in some rooms, and the management is very strict. I think this is very good, and it ensures the needs of passengers in non-smoking rooms, rather than the standard of opening a window to cope. Please note if you need to smoke. Don't feel uncomfortable if you are assigned a non-smoking room.

msg:As a high-end hotel, I booked a suite. When I checked in, the front desk clerk said that because I booked the room through Ctrip, I was asked to pay a 500 yuan deposit, which would be refunded if no facilities were damaged when I checked out. It's a bit strange. I already have to write down my phone number and signature. Ctrip also has my personal information and credit card information. I still don't trust the customer? He said it was hotel policy so I had to accept it.

At 8 o'clock in the morning the next day, when I checked out, I asked for a refund of the deposit. The front desk clerk said that I had to check the room before I could check out. I said check it now, I could wait, but he said that the staff who checked the room would not go to work until 9 o'clock. If no problems are found after checking the room, the deposit will be deposited into the WeChat ID account left by the guest and I will be asked to leave first. I am dissatisfied and have no choice. Fortunately, there was a person next to him who might be a senior person and said to return it first, and the front desk clerk immediately returned it. He is someone who would rather offend the guests than adhere to the hotel's rules. Failure to consider guest interests and needs.

I probably won't stay here again unless this rule is lifted and the service staff are taught to be flexible and customer-oriented.

**Service: The front desk staff are serious and responsible, especially caring and thoughtful. When we checked in, he patiently introduced the surrounding supermarket information. There were not many people when we checked in, and it was smooth and efficient.
Room: When entering the room, it feels quite spacious, at least much larger than expected. In addition, pots and pans, kitchen utensils and tableware are all available. You only need to buy good food yourself, cook the rice and vegetables, and you can have a simple family feast...it feels like going home.
**Hygiene: The room was cleaned very cleanly. To be honest, it's not as bad as some reviews say. The cleaning lady is very responsible and polite.
**Facilities: It can be seen that it has been in business for a while, the focus is on how to maintain the facilities, and the maintenance work is still in place.
But the location is really great, the outdoor garden on the 6th floor is my favorite. Go for a walk in the outdoor garden at night and enjoy the "grace" of the small waist. The West Tower is close at hand, and I am deeply attracted by this beautiful night scene...
**Breakfast: There are hot and cold dishes and specialty stalls. The variety is not very rich.
All in all, it is recommended for those who care about cost performance!

msg:All staff should be well trained and the service is excellent, almost responsive, polite and welcoming without being overly intrusive. The location is also very good. The IFC Center is downstairs and k11 is opposite. It is very convenient to buy things, order a taxi and order takeaway.
The room facilities are indeed aging, but they are not dilapidated. It should be considered a very good decoration more than ten years ago. This time I lived on the 7th floor and there was no view at all. There was hair on the carpet when I first checked in, and it was quickly resolved after I was notified to clean it.
The sanitation of the children's playroom on the 6th floor is very average, the amu*****t facilities are also very old, and so is the gym. There are not many people in the coffee shop, so it is suitable for working, but the milk is broken when I want to drink a cup of coffee.
The room is big enough for a family to come out, but if there are not so many people coming out together, it may not be the first choice.

It is very convenient for shopping, eating, sightseeing, and doing business. It is very close to Exit C of "Zhujiang New Town Station" of the subway (exit of R&F Yingkai Plaza). One door in the lobby on the ground floor of the hotel is connected to Guangzhou Friendship Store. The hotel has warm service and upgraded the room type. The rooms are clean and spacious, and the kitchen is fully equipped with induction cooker, oven, microwave oven, refrigerator, dishwasher, washing machine, dryer and other home appliances, all of which are big brands, making it feel like home. There are gymnasium, swimming pool and reading hall on the sixth floor of the hotel. The takeaway will be delivered to the door of the guest room by a cute little robot. The only downside is that the mattress is too hard, it would be perfect if it could be updated and replaced with a comfortable mattress.

1. The hotel facilities are very old. We stayed in room 911 and found that the hot air conditioner was useless at night. We were told that room 910 was turning on the cold air conditioner. We are one. If the other party turned on the cold air conditioner, we cannot use the hot air conditioner;
2. The bath water is half washed and found to be not hot, and it takes another 20-30 minutes to bathe the child with water;
3. There is a smoke alarm on the top of the room, but it is the kind that keeps flashing, which especially affects sleep;
4. There is a note in the order that a 4-year-old child will stay. I hope that the children's bathroom will be prepared in advance. If there is no one when checking in, it will be delivered to the room;
5. The room was arranged on the 9th floor, the sound insulation is not good, the sound from the street can still be heard clearly at night...
1200+ a night room, the location should be OK, the others are really average, and the service attitude is okay. I really saw that there was a living room at the time, and it was convenient to bring the baby. Otherwise, I would spend a few hundred more to live in other places. I think it will be better. more...

msg:This is the worst Ascott I have ever stayed in, and it definitely smashed the Ascott's brand. Before I went, I read the reviews saying that the facilities are relatively old. Thinking about the perfect service of Ascott Chongqing, I still stayed in a three-bedroom, 2k a night. I didn’t expect the facilities to be so simple. The only advantage is that the shower spray is relatively large. But is this mattress really worthy of the Ascott signature? Home Inns' mattresses should be more comfortable than this one. I think the hardware can be old, but these replaceable ones should keep up with the age, ok? The most outrageous thing is their service. The package is a 24-hour parking coupon. When I arrive, I can only go out once a day. Otherwise, I will pay for the extra parking fee. Your hotel will be short of dozens of yuan for parking. fee? And not every room comes by car. If you take a few more parking coupons, you will go bankrupt or you will not be able to pay wages? The indoor swimming pool told me that the jacuzzi was not cleaned and advised me not to open it. I was also speechless. After staying for one night, I asked Ctrip to refund the next three nights and changed to Fraser Court. I have to say that the Fraser Court apar**ent I stayed in last year should be strongly promoted. The location is excellent, the facilities are very new, the sanitation is very good, and the service is excellent. The politeness is in place, and there are more breakfast options. Friends, please keep your eyes open and book. As a diamond customer, I have never criticized a hotel so angrily.

msg:I book hotels frequently but rarely write reviews. The location of this hotel is very good, and the front desk service is also good. There are not many other services in this kind of apar**ent. After all, it is an apar**ent. But among the same brands, this one is worse, especially in terms of hygiene, just like an ordinary express hotel. I booked a three-bedroom executive room. There is no description of 200+ square meters, but it is about 150 square meters at most. The living room is so small. But that's not the point. The point is hygiene. Everything is greasy and dusty. We checked in at night and checked in without paying attention. As soon as I entered the room, I smelled the musty smell of Bu Shao. Then it felt greasy wherever I touched it, making me extremely uncomfortable. I had a bad nose one night, my nasal fluid was refluxing, and I couldn't fix the problem. The next day I discovered that the original wall panels were all hairy and covered with dust. I felt uncomfortable immediately. I woke up my family and checked out immediately. .
The hotel experience is super bad. Ascott in foreign countries has taken good care of it. The decorations have been done for more than 10 years and it looks like new. There is absolutely no greasy feeling, nor can there be so much dust.
In fact, apar**ent hotels are very convenient for families to travel and take care of, and they can also make breakfast, cook late night snacks, etc. It feels like home, but this time staying in a hotel only left a terrible feeling.

But I got out of the swimming pool around 11:30 and couldn't swipe my card! ! I try to go down to the front desk on the 1st floor to register and then go up to the 25th floor to open the door.
Why can't I open the door before I check out, the air conditioner is automatically turned off, and the lights are also turned off. The kids waited a long time in their swim suits. A few minutes after opening the door, the waiter asked 'why haven't you checked out yet?

I asked the front desk several times what was going on, but they kept saying it was just a key card issue. Finally the front desk said to me 'a little gift for you'. Is it that hard to say sorry? Is this the Ascott's solution to the problem at International Hotels? I want to ask Ms.Ling Chen at the front desk again?

The facilities of the hotel are really very suitable for bringing babies with a constant temperature swimming pool. Children's Paradise likes to see the food delivery robots.

It's nice to have a garden to come out and get a breath of fresh air
The breakfast is also very rich and delicious
In short, it is a very high-level serviced apar**ent

If you really want to talk about the place that can be improved, it is probably the bathroom, because it is a bit outdate and there is no separate shower room, which is slightly inconvenient, but it does not affect the overall experience

The surroundings are convenient. I broke a spoon while cooking breakfast. I will accept the deduction, but the reason for the break was because of the placement of the kitchen cabinets. The location is very unreasonable. It is placed in a place where you can't even see it. You have to stand on tiptoes to touch it, and it will fall down when you swing your hand to find out where it is. The overall experience is average, and it is far worse than the Ascott hotels in Shenzhen. Yes, the price is not necessarily advantageous.

The security guard at the door was very enthusiastic and helped to deliver the luggage to the car. Will recommend to friends.

We went in and found that the used paper in the toilet was still not flushed out there. The cleaning staff came in to clean, and in front of me they used Toilet guests' towels were wiped everywhere. The facilities in the house are still good, but it can be seen that they are a few years old, especially those sofas and curtains. There are quite a lot of types of breakfast, but the waiter at the entrance is like a thief, afraid that everyone will not swipe the card to dine in, so this is not necessary!

The room is a long time ago, the living room is ok, but when you enter the bedroom, there is a glass partition from the previous era. It feels like the style of the 1980s? Could it be that this is nostalgia? It feels dirty everywhere, like a very ordinary hotel you see on TV. Very regret to book this hotel. I don't have any opinion on this hotel. It was the first time I stayed, and the pertinent evaluation came from a Ctrip Golden Diamond member. It can be said that if I can see the room first, I will not check in for free.

It may be the summer vacation, there are so many people, and the room types are fully booked every day. There are two points of dissatisfaction with this stay; the first point is that Ctrip Black Diamond users can delay check-out until 2 o'clock when staying in a hotel, but this time they can't delay check-out. Although it is a hotel apar**ent, it is a hotel and then an apar**ent. It should be It's the same as a normal hotel.

msg:I booked a deluxe three-room for New Year's Eve, and then I was too lazy to change the hotel, so I continued to book an executive three-room for two nights on Ctrip. The hotel was also nice and didn't let me change rooms. The deluxe three-bedroom is the largest, suitable for family and friends gatherings, but cannot see Guangzhou (it is said that some two-bedrooms can be seen).
The hotel service can only be regarded as a comfortable type. When checking in, the two young ladies at the front desk actually opened up directly (without taking into account the presence of customers). The hotel breakfast is also average. Because the apar**ent is supplied with hot water from a storage tank, we all encountered no hot water halfway through the bath. Compared with the DoubleTree by Hilton we went to stay in Zhuhai later, they are all old hotel brands, but the difference in service is quite obvious.

There is not even a single USB socket that is commonly used at present, and no conversion socket is provided. The waiter said coldly: "No" ! And the internet speed in the room should be snail speed, you can only use the mobile network of your own mobile phone. When we checked into the hotel, we had a free upgrade to a second room because there was no one room, but it was of no use to us. When we checked out, we applied to postpone the check-out until 2:00, so we couldn't delay the check-out because the room was upgraded. It's ridiculous! Will never live again!

I will definitely be able to find my mobile phone when I pack my luggage, but I couldn’t find my mobile phone when I was rummaging through the luggage one by one. I even searched for the corners of the sofa and mattress, but I couldn’t find it. Check out 24 No one gave me an answer for hours, and there was no answer.

msg:A very bad experience. I have lived in Ascott Suzhou before and I feel that laundry is quite convenient and suitable for long-term stay. I ordered Ascott on a business trip to Guangzhou, and even the sale was ordered, which cost a total of more than 35,000 yuan. , Because there are so many things, I don't want to toss about it. I really can't stand it today. I changed the hotel. The overall feeling is that it is uncomfortable not to write a bad review. The five-star price and the five-star service surface, the real core is still a small hotel. I think that competent leaders have been transferred to the Huanmao store. Huanmao's service is not bad. This hotel has a lot of foreigners, and may only be polite to foreigners.
A few questions for travelers' reference
1 The signal is extremely poor, whether it is 5G or wireless network, I watch videos in the house every three seconds, let alone play games, I live in Ascott for a month and quit my games, thank you! I called four times, and no one asked me. On the third time, I said that I had called three times and no one came to see it. Then the front desk said I was embarrassed that the technology was off work, and I would help you see it tomorrow. The result was the same four times. The answer is that I will look at it tomorrow after get off work. I have waited for another week and haven’t come. I have to pull it down and change hotels. It’s really not how long I wanted to move.
2 I stayed for a room rate of 35,000 yuan, which is not too much or too little. I have a lot of stuff. The front desk asks people to help. An aunt came and said that I could not help as soon as I walked in. I only cleaned, okay The polite language has been handed over to the leader, and there is no embarrassment. I called the front desk again, and the front desk said that only the security can help you, and a security guard came here with a black face. It is really not an exaggeration. He has the same expression as a ****, standing at the door and not moving. I said, can I help you lift it? No! Said you are too messy to make it difficult. Helplessly, I said you go, let me come by myself, and see that I am not happy to help me lift the skis, the car is not enough, and the front desk is called to send a car, and another security comes, the climax is coming, I also watched when I moved things and got on the car. Now, I don’t move, I really admire the management of this hotel, oh yes, I pushed a car for me, thank you! Didi came when I was out, and I took my bags out, and no one helped you during the whole process. Really sweaty, shivering with anger. I can help you get things all season.
3 There are a lot of foreigners in the hotel, so I don’t dare to go for breakfast and let the room be delivered. Well, after staying for more than 20 days, it was delivered for 4 days. Others are gone. I said you don’t let me call and say the same thing every day. You just help every day. I just send some eggs. I didn’t believe it for three days.
There are welcome snacks in the room. Since I moved in, I have eaten it on the first day and never let you off.
4 I started to live in two rooms, and it felt okay. Then my friend left and I lived in a single room by myself. I wiped everything down. If the shower head is better than Hanting, please come and scold me.
5 The air conditioner suddenly broke down one day and asked me to change the room. I said it was OK. Then I could only change it, and then let me change the next building. That’s right, the next building is not on the same floor. How to change so many things, it takes two hours to move. I was on fire at the time. I said if you have a room in this building, I will reply in half a day. If there are only two rooms, I will upgrade you today. . Really, I haven’t lived in a two-room apartment and it’s taking advantage of you. Your air conditioner is broken, and you told me to move to the next building. If you come to help me move, I’ll admit it. NS? Can I live in your two beds? The next day I made two phone calls and asked me when to move out of the two rooms. It was really amazing. I am so poor that I take advantage of you. My air conditioner is broken, and the air conditioner is not broken. I have so many things. If you upgrade me, I won’t go. Qianduo, isn't it fragrant?
5 As a Ctrip Black Diamond member, it is the first time that I have such a bad feeling on business trips. There is no extra fuel or exaggeration. The price of single room is 900, and the price of double room is 1500 is not low. The front desk service is okay, that is, it is worse than Huanmao. Huanmao always stands up and communicates with you. This is like a mobile customer service, and I often forget things, but thank you to the little brother at the front desk to send me express delivery today and like it. Decoration environment The decoration is old and there is no sense of service. I have been in business for decades. I have written so many words for the first time. I hope you are better, but at present, it's pretty bad.

The security will select the residents to show the accounting. The security guard who was on duty at 19:30 on the evening of November 4 still forced me to show my health code after I walked in and presented my room card, and he did not stop many people from entering behind me. Such poor quality security will make me very worried about the security of this apar**ent. It also made me directly cancel my wish to renew my stay. I am from the media, and I will inform all my colleagues and friends not to stay here.

If four people stay for less than 400 a night, they can enjoy more than 130 square meters of space. There is a bathtub, a washer dryer, and kitchenware (it’s great to have a washing machine in hot Guangzhou).
As soon as I got off the bus, I came to pick up my luggage, and even the young lady came to help. She was really a girl! It’s too cute to order takeaway and Xiaoya robot to deliver the food~~
After staying for two days, I found out that the Zhujiang New Town subway station is right below, so the traffic should not be too convenient! ! The CBD in the CBD is very, very pleasant!

2、比較好的是房間可以開窗，結果連着兩晚樓下小路收垃圾，都是晚上11點後，第一晚持續幾小時，第二晚持續1.5小時。
3、早餐很一般。
4、嬰兒的所有用品都沒有，除了一張嬰兒床，鐵架子的，8個月以內的小baby完全使用不了。這都算了，最差要有個澡盆也可以，可惜也沒有。這個可能是我強人所難了。

가족들이 많이 찾는 호텔이라 조용한 일상을 원하시는 분께는 추천하지 않습니다. 너무 복잡해요. 엘리베이터 이용도 불편합니다. 주변의 특급호텔 대비 조금 저렴한 수준이지만, 이가격이면 5성급 다른 호텔을 이용하시는게 나을거라 생각이드네요.

msg:房間比較舊，有蠻大異味，環境設施跟商務酒店差不多，但收費卻不低，最無語的點是明明定了3個房間的套房，肯定不止一兩個人入住的，但居然衹有8張停車票，每張抵3小時，衹夠一輛車停24小時，我們四輛車根本不夠用，非常不合理。都已經住店消費一晚了，還不免停車，導致額外多給400停車費，簡直無語至極。

msg:舉家出行偏愛2室的套房，因此雅詩閣旗下的公寓通常會是首選，環境、地理位置、服務、價格綜合看來十分實惠。全國各地雅詩閣住過不少，也是某地盛捷的長租客，必須還是要吐槽下廣州的這家。
1，舊。房間實在是有點老舊了，不僅體現在房間木質傢俱、牆板、裝飾物上，更體現在床上用品上。床墊太硬了，睡在床上有一種縣城小旅館的感覺。被子薄且有點潮，幾乎沒有蓬鬆感。總之睡眠體驗很差，衹能用將就着睡來形容。
2，小。大堂很小，基本上人稍微一多就會顯得很侷促。加上前台服務人員不多，高峯期忙的不可開交，客人也亂糟糟。心疼前台。
3，摳。大寫的摳！説實話，這是我第一次遇到在國內住酒店需要自己掏停車費的情況。雖然酒店提供8張電子停車券，但一定要注意必須要一次用完才能免24小時停車費，如果分開使用，每張衹能抵一個小時。這就意味着，一旦你開車進來就不能隨便出去，不然你就得考慮停車費怎麼算更划算的問題。
酒店還是有一些可圈可點的地方，比如早餐還是比較豐富的，小童娛樂場所也不錯，交通方便，服務水準還是在線。但下次，在它翻新前應該不會再選擇入住了。
順便一提，晚餐去了隔壁四季酒店，發現那裡也是亂糟糟的。這麼一比就，還行吧還，行吧。

msg:住了好幾次這個公寓，但是這次，酒店給了我一大驚喜，安排了一衹蟑螂和我一起睡覺，就在枕頭上面，單人房套間的設計，簡直離譜，還在浴缸裏面站着洗澡，況且洗澡間和洗漱台還沒有隔斷，洗一個澡整個廁所都濕透了，非常好的設計。發現蟑螂在枕頭上後，給前台打電話，前台回覆的是“不好意思”可能隔壁驅蟲跑你這邊來了。”後續什麼都沒有，漂亮的解釋，漂亮的處理，再來説説前台的服務人員，這個公寓前台看見外國人，90度鞠躬笑臉迎接，咋們中國人的住户，全程沒有微笑，就像包拯一樣的臉，“沒有你好”，“沒有笑臉”。我問了一下公寓是幾星服務，前台的一個穿黑色西裝的一個四眼大哥（本來不想用這詞的，但是這種崇洋媚外的酒店，我也不需要客氣）説我們公寓沒有星級，好，問題來了，沒有星級的標準平判，攜程給的是四星，然後價格收取的也是4星價格，不是星際酒店，你們告訴我，你們公寓的服務和設施怎麼達到的這個收費標準？自己定價的嗎？最重要一點，你們都是一名打工人員，不要看見外國人就像一狗樣點頭哈腰，看見我們自己國家的人像開封府辦案的包拯大人一樣，黑口黑臉。這麼喜歡外國人，討厭中國人，門口就寫一塊牌，不接待中國人。真**狗的一家公寓，真的越想越氣，有蟑螂我都無所謂，這種東西可能也避免不了，但是你們以後去看看，這麼他們前台看外國人那眼神，真的就像看見他們親爹樣，巴不得下跪那種，看見我們中國人，感覺我們住户是****一樣，去你**的，你們衹是一羣發工服務員，穿的西裝筆挺，還真以為自己高一等了，自己每個月拿幾個工資心裏沒點數，房貸每月要換多少心裏沒數，傻吊一羣，我還會去住這個公寓，下次我讓你們感受一下你們是二的那個公民的感覺。我不小心刪了頭有蟑螂的圖片，你們酒店應該知道這事的。沒住過的千萬別去住這個公寓。不信你們自己去體驗一下。

msg:Ascott is located in IFC, close to Zhujiang New Town. I particularly like the terrace garden on the fourth floor of the hotel, where you can enjoy or take photos of the slim waist. In addition, the apartment hotel is fully equipped with a kitchen and living room, kitchenware and tableware, and laundry facilities, which is especially suitable for families or friends to stay.

msg:The hotel service attitude is arrogant, speaking English first to Chinese people.
There is an unfair treaty in the membership points system. Ctrip stipulates that only sales rooms can be accumulated. Personal membership cannot be found at the front desk, and the front desk discriminates against Ctrip booking guests. Related issues have been complained to the hotel and Ascott China many times but to no avail. Hilton and Marriott do not have similar problems. This is my own real experience. Companies that despise Chinese consumers should get out of China. I will continue to report to the relevant depar**ents to protect my rights.
