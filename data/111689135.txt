I paid extra to upgrade to the new wing, so I stayed in the same room for two nights. The hot spring has many different types of baths. The overall environment is novel and beautiful. Looking at the surrounding scenery, I feel relaxed and happy. Thank you Alfred for recommending Chinese food and trying Zhongshan's The food was delicious. I ate here two nights in a row.

There is a Chinese-style courtyard between the buildings, which is very unique and comfortable. We stayed in a new building. The room was large, with a terrace, exquisite decoration, and the room was new and clean. The most surprising thing is the extra-large double bed. Two Queen’s beds are combined into one large bed, which can sleep 4 adults without being squeezed. ￼😃

The hot spring park is isolated in the hotel lobby and is very convenient to walk from the guest rooms. The park has different hot spring pools, among which the fish spa pool is worth recommending. In addition, there is a hot stone bed area with towels. It is very comfortable to sleep on and you will fall asleep unconsciously😴

Overall, the hot springs and accommodation were a good experience👍🏻

Disadvantages: The central park is a little farther than the waterfront room, but it's okay. In addition, it costs 3 yuan per bottle to get more bottled water. I think the hotel can be more generous. In addition, the breakfast provided by the hotel is not good for the location, with few varieties and not very exciting products, which cannot match the new decoration of the central park. The snack bar in the hot spring can be reopened and more interesting. If possible, the children's height for breakfast can be over 1.4m to be charged, which is more friendly.

msg:Transportation is not convenient
Fortunately, a local will drive us there.
Hot spring opening hours are from 9 am to 11 pm
Tongyu Hot Spring is open 24 hours a day and is unparalleled
There aren't many waiters, so it's hard to find anyone to help.
And he has a bad attitude and a black and expressionless face😑
Breakfast until 10:30
Don’t have expectations, not many choices
There is no one to take care of the hot spring. The environment is average and there are many mosquitoes.
The swimming pool is not big and has no facilities.
What a small farm, so different from the photo
I just saw a few poor little animals
Children will be disappointed if they go there
No wonder no one is going
Only a few local elderly people go there
The only good thing is that the room design is nice
There are 3 types of fork cords available for free
The bed is big and very comfortable
Overall, it's a bit mediocre
Very bad experience
Wouldn't recommend it to friends

When we entered the room, we found that it was a room without a balcony, and the area was smaller than the 43 square meters of the twin room we booked. After communicating with the front desk, we got a room. The room with balcony in Building 2 is larger than the previous one in Building 1. I don’t understand why we were given a room in Building 1 first, and only one room was well sanitized. We little kids were very sleepy. Other rooms were not arranged for us. Although they gave small cards for the children to play with, the adults still felt uncomfortable. In the end, they added 400 yuan (at the beginning, the front desk said they had to pay the 500 difference in price, but I said that Ctrip would pay the difference. 400, he said he would help me apply for 400😞) After upgrading to the largest suite, I had an existing room. There is an additional charge for the children's paradise, 68/person, which is smaller than the free children's paradise in other parent-child hotels. If you don't go, you can take the children to the farm to feed the rabbits and hamsters. The worst thing is the breakfast. It is said to be a buffet, but the variety and quality are very poor. It is definitely not comparable to a star hotel. It may be at the level of a fast hotel.

温泉區較細，也可能湊上五一假期，人真的那個多！第一日入住下午3-4點去泡温泉，全是人頭，直至到6點才泡上。第二日一早再去泡，人少，舒服。
另酒店裡麪幾乎全都要錢，消費也不低。

一個插曲，泡温泉時，有五六個大媽大叔操着外地口音，穿着衣服泡，佔了一整個池。極度不衞生，和工作人員説了也無濟於事，她當看不見。當天很多池水都較臟，有飄浮物。影響體驗。
