msg:The Holiday Inn Resort Zhangjiakou is a great hotel with only 5min walking distance from the Forlong Ski/snowboard area. We stayed in a family room with bunk bed and our kids loved it. Breakfast is very good as well with choice between Western and Asien food. If your Chinese is not so good, a few employees can speak English as well. We definitely would come again.

Seeing that I brought children and the elderly to check in, there were a lot of people queuing for a long time, so she gave me a small gift for the baby and breakfast for the extra bed. The front desk responded quickly, and the request for an extra quilt was also coordinated and delivered as soon as possible. The service in the Chinese restaurant is also good. The baby's spoon fell on the ground, and the restaurant manager helped to wash it and scald it with boiling water. I am very satisfied with the living experience, and the temperature is also very comfortable. I have the opportunity to come back with my father and baby.

msg:The natural scenery in Fulong is quite good in summer. The blue sky and white clouds + European-style town are very picturesque. It is close to the city and convenient for shopping. It is very quiet in the off-season. It is a good place to escape the summer heat.
Traveling in the off-season, you can read all the reviews. Originally, it was just a change of environment for a few days with the kids, so I had some mental expectations before coming. So after coming here, we can accept the situation that there is no shuttle bus to the town, the bus does not reach Fulong, many shops are closed, and the circus is closed. After all, there are few customers. But regarding the experience of the hotel itself, there are a few points that I, as an i person, must talk about.
First of all, when I arrived at Chongli Railway Station at around 1pm, there were no shuttles or buses. The difference from the guide made me want to ask what was going on at the hotel. As a result, I called the front desk three times and got 10 calls. For about minutes, no one answered. It wasn't because the line was busy, but because no one answered after dialing. I even suspected that I dialed the wrong number (it was verified later that the number was correct). Later, I asked the bus driver passing by and found out that this place is on Fridays. You can only take a taxi there.
Secondly, after checking in, I asked the front desk if there was a children's playground in the hotel. The front desk simply replied that there was no children's playground. I said that I could only go to the White Bear House to play, right? Answer me yes. This was different from what was mentioned in the guide. I thought it might be because of the off-season, so I took my children directly to the White Bear House. As a result, we went to the underground G floor of the hotel and found a small activity room next to the all-day dining restaurant. There was a children's slide in it, as well as a bunch of various small sofas and handmade gadgets. It was a bit gray without maintenance, but children can also play, so The front desk's definition of this room = no children's playground.
Finally, we checked out on Monday morning and planned to have breakfast at 8 o'clock and leave to catch the train at 9 o'clock. We arrived on the first floor just after 8 o'clock. The front desk staff greeted us as we passed by. When we arrived at the restaurant, we had been eating normally for the previous two days. The door of the restaurant was closed, and we were confused because there was no notice at all. We returned to the front desk to ask what was going on. The front desk was not apologetic at all and said that they had changed to a meal delivery system today, and also gave us a bunch of reasons why the meal was delivered. We were told that we were in a hurry, so the front desk gave us a table to order our food. They said it would be ready in 15 minutes or up to half an hour. We waited in the room for 40 minutes, and even asked for help once. The actual situation was that the catering depar**ent did not respond at all. We knew that we were going to have breakfast today because the front desk forgot to notify us the day before, and the time required for temporary meal preparation was not the maximum half hour mentioned by the front desk. The originally ample time became very tight, and the staff in the catering depar**ent behind us They worked very hard to help us prepare meals, including sending us downstairs, carrying our luggage, and coordinating vehicles. All the people from the catering depar**ent were from the catering depar**ent. From the beginning to the end, the front desk said something apologetic and did not leave the front desk counter. The so-called manager called us later. The apology call was also very formal.
I have met many hotel people, and this is the first time I have seen such a disconnected cooperation between hotel depar**ent teams. The attitude of some front desk staff is also very unique. Three stars are given to the girl who helps the babysitter at the front desk and the catering depar**ent staff. The staff and the beautiful environment of Chongli are great, but often one bad service will affect the overall stay experience, so everyone should be mentally prepared.

The breakfast is rich and there are even five or six kinds of bread sauce. I had two meals in the Chinese restaurant Jinxiu Pavilion. The food is light and delicious. I give great affirmation to the waiter Yigege. He always has a smiling face and interacts with the children. The children like it and don’t want to leave~ In addition, the room is large enough, with six bottles of mineral water, and the bed is of suitable hardness. I will stay here again in summer!

msg:In mid-March, I sealed the ban and came to Chongli.
Because I brought a baby with me this time, I chose the Fulong Holiday Resort Hotel, which I have stayed at before and received good reviews.

Facilities: The weather in Chongli is really dry, but fortunately there is a humidifier in the room. We were traveling with our children this time, and the hotel front desk provided a crib and a brand new baby pillow.

Hygiene: I have stayed in several hotels and B&Bs in Chongli, and Fulong is the cleanest and tidiest in my opinion. Rooms are cleaned daily and equipped with new items.

Environment: It’s very convenient because you can ski in and out of Fulong Ski Resort, and I heard that there is also a White Bear Paradise in the town for children to play. Although I didn’t go there this time, you can do it when you come to escape the heat in the summer. Come explore.

Service: The most important thing is the service of Fulong Holiday! Thanks to every hotel staff for taking care of us and making us feel that it is actually very convenient to bring our children. Everyone has provided us with a lot of conveniences. Thank you to the room manager for preparing desserts and fruits for us every day and asking us if we need help every time. Also thank you to the restaurant staff, the little girl entertained us very enthusiastically.

I met all the warm-hearted people during my trip at the end of winter~see you again!

The room was very quiet. Opposite the balcony were rows of small buildings, standing quietly in the blue sky, with a Nordic style. Our flight was delayed. The lobby managers, Mr. Xie Wendong and Ms. Shi Ziyue, received us very warmly. Because we hadn’t bought ski tickets yet, they actively helped us find solutions and provided reasonable suggestions. They heard that I had a bad stomach, and they were considerate. I asked the restaurant to prepare energy packs, and the sandwiches inside were super delicious. The two waiters who clean the room, Zhao Xiaocui and Xu Liangfang, are also responsible. All in all, in just one week, we felt at home, and we will bring relatives and friends to stay here next time.

msg:For those who are planning to order for the first time:
1. The room is very dark, so you have to use a flashlight to illuminate something. The slightly brighter light source is above your head, and it emits a very emo effect.
2. The wardrobe in the room can hang two pieces of clothes.
3. The service attitude of the male waiter at the front desk was very poor.
4. If you need an extra quilt, just say you don’t have one. It took three calls the next day to get a quilt.
5. Check out at 8:20 in the morning. I need a trolley to take my luggage. I was told that no one would be available until work starts at 8:30.
6. I didn’t see the smiling service until the female receptionist who checked out.

Summary: No cancellation is allowed after booking, so I stayed at Fulong for the first time for three days. It seriously refreshed my understanding of InterContinental. The service was very poor and the experience was very poor.

msg:The room was big and comfortable, and the free laundry was a surprise. The breakfast room is large and not crowded. It only takes 3 minutes to walk to the ski resort, which is the best choice for skiing in Fulong. The desserts at the hotel's Chris**as buffet are amazing. The disadvantage is that it may be due to the first floor. The bathroom has a peculiar smell and cannot open the door. It would be better if there is an air purifier. In addition, the area near the balcony door is still a bit cold even if the door is closed tightly.

In short, it was my first time to come to Zhangjiakou, and I left a very good impression at the Fulong Holiday Hotel. Everything was perfect. The only regret was that I caught a cold and had a fever at the night skating venue, and I didn’t skate after that. I remind everyone to wear more clothes when skating at the night skating venue. Looking forward to coming again next time!

msg:Facilities: The room facilities are all normal. Maybe because the occupancy rate is not high, the room has a slight smell. You need to contact the staff to open the balcony door. If it cannot be closed after opening, you need to contact the staff again to lock it. Otherwise, it will be cold when you sleep at night. Contact the staff in the afternoon. The staff closed the balcony door, but no one came to close it until I went to bed at night. I slept with the door crack open all night. Fortunately, the weather was not too cold. The service staff did not know whether it was due to lack of staff or lack of service awareness. What questions should I ask? , it took many times to get the answer. It was raining and I asked the front desk to borrow an umbrella. I was told that there was one in the closet in the room. The problem was that I had already gone downstairs, and one umbrella was not enough for two adults. After it was clear that I needed to borrow another one. I was asked to sign and borrow a broken umbrella...and no matter what I communicated with the front desk, except for the warm reception of a new girl at the front desk, the girl with a perm at the front desk kept looking at the list in her hand and insisted that the guests wait for her to count. I gave the answer after finishing the data in my hand. The new girl may have just started working. If she couldn't answer the question, she had to ask the girl who permed her hair. The girl was very impatient and made her wait. In short, the check-in experience was not good.
Service: The front desk is really bad. When checking out, checking in, borrowing an umbrella, asking questions, I kept waiting even though it was not busy. The check-in experience was particularly poor. The breakfast staff are very warm and friendly, and will greet you proactively and tell you where there are available tables.
Hygiene: The room is very hygienic. There is a bag of unknown objects on the balcony. It may be dirt. The balcony cannot be opened by itself, and the staff cannot close it by themselves. I contacted the staff but no one came for a long time.
Environment: It's about a 10-minute walk from the circus show, the White Bear's House, and the fish feeding place in the town. It's personally acceptable. There is a KFC nearby, about a 10-minute walk, and you can also order takeout. There are not many varieties and the taste is normal.

Of these towns, I feel that I currently prefer Fulong Town, where both adults and children can find corresponding fun.
If it's not enough:
1. Bedding, the sheets on the day of check-in had a hole.
2. Restaurant food, some food tastes cold (staple food that is not cold)

This time we went on a trip with friends. Everyone was very happy on the way back and felt like we had a great time! With nothing else going on we will go again after eleven.

The deluxe is marked with high floors, so I personally understand that high floors correspond to good scenery, but the windows of the room are half-open, which is very awkward. The scenery is also the interior of the hotel. What I saw It is a mess in the courtyard, and this kind of room can be discounted.
There is a refrigerator in the house, but there are no beverages, only four bottles of normal temperature mineral water.
Hygiene: There are mildew spots on the pillow
Environment: The hotel is located on the outermost side of the town, and it takes 10 minutes to walk (walking speed) to the play area (grass skiing, fountains, etc.), which belongs to the outermost side of the town.
Service: Even my rough husband has to say: the service is far worse than that in the south. (He is targeting the Holiday Inn Hotel in Sanya, which costs several hundred yuan a night)

Final summary: the service cannot keep up with the price, and the room type is disgusting!

It is a ski resort in winter, and it is changed to grass skiing, go-karts, mountain bikes and other entertainment items in summer. It is really rich, especially suitable for bringing children to play. The hotel is also pretty good. The room is very comfortable to live in.

The area of ​​the room and the bathroom are large enough It is large and can fully meet my picky requirements for the size of the room. The most important thing is that each room has an independent balcony, which makes the room more transparent and oppressive. Coupled with the good weather and beautiful environment, it is really perfect The room service staff are also very warm and polite. I usually drink a lot of water. In addition, the air in Chongli is dry, so the demand for mineral water will rise immediately. I got a piece of mineral water in my room. The service is heart-warming. If you want to comment, just give me one. It is recommended to control the sanitary details of the room. This time, I saw a toothpick on the carpet under my bedside table.

I've stayed in countless five-star hotels, I'm a bit lazy and I wrote a little bit of comments, but I'm really satisfied and touched by everything in these three days. First of all, the smile of the security uncle in the lobby makes the guests feel extremely warm. He greeted the guests before they got off the bus take baggage. When checking in, manager Li Xiaxia offered to help upgrade the family room, gave the children breakfast as a gift, and arranged a room with a great location for the elderly. What moved me the most was Manager Guo Jiaxin. Because he came out too early, he didn't bother to print the children's class materials. When he asked the printing shop, Manager Guo printed the materials without saying a word. He was really very objective. The service of Chongli Fulong Holiday is worth learning from many five-star hotels. From the security guards, to the aunts in the restaurant, to the staff, you will feel that the service here is really poured into the emotions of the service staff.
The important thing is that from the exterior of the hotel, the park, to the interior, and the bedding, it is found that everything is very clean. Cleaning is done by two or three staff members, meticulous. The breakfast is rich, clean and of good quality. As soon as the elevator room exits, there are many bottles of mineral water for guests to use at any time, which is great! Besides, the outside is surrounded by mountains, karting at the foot of the mountain, grass skiing, mountain biking, Internet celebrity swings on the top of the mountain, and coffee shops, especially Fengling Valley. Coupled with the cool temperature of less than 30 degrees, it is really beautiful.

Please make a note in advance when making an appoin**ent, and the hotel has prepared rooms according to the note. It's quieter, and the stay is quite comfortable. The service of the hotel sky is very caring, and it's well received. I would like to give some comments from old customers: the yard can be properly cleaned.

2. The hotel service experience is extremely poor: ordering takeout is not allowed to be delivered to the hotel lobby. You can only ask the concierge to pick it up at the entrance of the parking lot. I was promised that the takeout would be delivered to the room, so I went back to the room to wait, but as soon as I arrived in the room, I was greeted by a I called the concierge again to pick it up, and the service staff's attitude was extremely bad. They were almost giving orders and did not give any explanation...
3. The experience of staying in bed was extremely poor: I wanted to sleep in before checking out, but at around 8 a.m., there were floor service staff chatting and making noise loudly in the corridor for a long time, and the guest room was soundproofed. The effect was not good, I couldn't sleep at all due to the noise, and I collapsed (make sure it was the housekeeping staff, not other guests)! ! !
4. In 20 years of business travel, I have experienced the worst value for money hotel, bar none! ! !

He upgraded our room and gave the child a small gift when we checked out! Children are very happy! Fulong Holiday is located in Four Seasons Town, which has a lot of activities, such as grass skiing, rainbow slides, cable cars, go-karts, and taking the cable car up and down (I don’t remember the name) White Bear Indoor Park! When the high temperature is 40 degrees in Beijing, the highest temperature there is 30 degrees, which is really cool! There is also a supermarket in the town that is highly recommended - "Jiajiayue" is super beautiful and cheap! The children’s favorite Poppo is only 4.9 a bottle. In short, Four Seasons Town is suitable for long-term summer vacation! Will go again!

The hotel rooms are clean and tidy, quiet and warm, and the service staff are warm and thoughtful, responsive to every request. The breakfast feels average, there is a gap in the horizontal comparison, and there is room for improvement in the quality and quantity of dishes. Having dinner at the Chinese restaurant, it is said that there are conferences and meals that are busy. Facing the increase of individual customers, I am at a loss. There is obviously a lack of emergency measures, the waiters lack training, and the wrong dishes are served many times, which makes me feel chaotic.

There is still a 100-meter distance between the hotel and the ski resort, and you need to walk down. It is more convenient to put the snowboard directly on the snow field.

It is recommended that the hotel prepare some instant noodles, snacks and beverage mineral water to replenish the skiers who are tired from skiing.

There are a lot of people on holidays, and the price is a bit more expensive than usual, but the overall service still makes me satisfied. There is no situation where luggage is not given, and the service is indifferent to answers. On the contrary, they are very enthusiastic. Of course, staying in so many five-star hotels is a standard service, but too many negative reviews may have lowered my expectations. The overall feeling this time is still very good, slightly exceeding my expectations. The hotel buffet is also very good. The only regret is that there are few types of dishes, but the glutinous rice balls, hot pot and chicken wings are my favorite, and I can eat them every time. It was not very bright early, but the taste was still good. No more than 5 minutes' walk from the ski resort, the weather of minus 30 degrees did not hinder me, or even bring discomfort. After skiing, I went back to take a bath and felt so comfortable. Thanks to the service of all the staff, let me have a great ski holiday experience, thank you

msg:Departing from Beijing on the morning of New Year’s Eve, headed west all the way to Chongli, started the first two-day, one-night Spring Festival trip in Chongli in three years [Loving Heart], there were very few cars all the way, and it took two and a half hours to arrive at the hotel . Very well [rose]
At around 12:00 noon, I went to the front desk to check in. He was a very polite boy. As soon as he entered the hotel with his children and parents, the staff came to greet him. When he came in for the first time, the staff asked the child if he was hungry. Hungry, thirsty or not, there are biscuits and drinks in the lobby rest area 🥤, ever since the child knew this, every time he passed by, he would go there to find snacks [Naughty]
The arranged room has a small terrace facing south. The temperature in Chongli is relatively high these two days. It is very comfortable to stand on the terrace around noon.
Breathe the fresh and pure air after the snow among the high mountains.
During the two days of my stay, I would like to thank every employee at the front desk who answered the phone in room 1519, and the very polite boys in the food delivery depar**ent who delivered supplies and buckets of ice every time they came to the room , the night of the 22nd is a girl, and they are all very polite.
Of course, there are employees who make us feel at home, so I will not be stingy with my praise, but there are some unsatisfactory places, and I also hope to use this platform to give feedback. If your store can see it, that would be the best.
On New Year's Eve on the 21st, I took my father to the gym on the basement floor of the hotel, thinking about exercising. At that time, there was only a woman wearing a red knitted hat. At first, I thought it was some customer who was exercising here. My father and I wanted to try the pedaling equipment, but it couldn’t be turned on no matter how hard we pressed the switch, but the power was connected. The display screen was also on. After studying it for about 3-5 minutes, we didn’t get it right, so we gave up and planned to leave. After we went out, we happened to meet two male service staff and asked them to help look at the instrument. They were very enthusiastic to help find the reason, but in the end, we decided to leave. During the chat, when I learned from them that the woman wearing the hat was the manager of the gym, I felt very angry and funny. I followed two The service staff said, she is the manager? We've been messing around here for a long time, but we didn't see her come up and make a fuss, thinking she was a guest. I really think that as a service industry, such feedback from customers is really ironic. Anyway, this detail is the moment that lowers the favor the most. If I could score, I can only give this so-called manager a zero.
Details determine success or failure, and also determine whether you work hard. On the 21st New Year’s Eve, I went back to the room after dinner, called the front desk and asked for 4 bottles of water. After a while, the boy in the delivery depar**ent brought a bag. The moment I picked it up, I felt that I was very heavy. I counted it when I entered the room and found that it was 6 bottles, my mother said you ordered 4 bottles, didn't you? I said, maybe it’s because it’s Chinese New Year, and I think 6 is more auspicious [strong]. Whether it’s the boy who answers the phone at the front desk or the boy who delivers water in the food delivery depar**ent, in short, a certain link is full of delicacy and thoughtfulness, which warms my heart. .
Not much to say, thank you to those warm people. [love]

There are many people. The hotel service is very good and the room is very comfortable. You can send the afternoon tea set to the room It's delicious, but it doesn't provide a dinner buffet.

Ms. Guo Yaru is the one who checks in and checks out at the front desk (the work name tag is a bit small, and it’s not easy to stare at it all the time, it seems to be the name). Brother Pang Jie in the concierge depar**ent helped me get my luggage from the room until it was delivered to the car. The service is commendable. After returning to Beijing, I found that I accidentally forgot important items in the room. I called the hotel and Miss Sunny quickly helped me find them. Thank you very much!

There is a small seafood hot pot set meal together with the check-in reservation. This small hot pot is said to be 158 per person, but it actually feels that 58 per person is not worth it. Star hotels can be expensive, but they can't be standard poor. North hotel, expectations are not high, but worse than expected. Quasi-5-star facility, service should be less than 4-star standard.

The two hotels share the children's playground in the middle, the Polar Bear House, grass karts, ropeways, and mountain coffee , the environment is fantastic. Takeaways cannot enter the lobby. Extra beds are charged, so no quilts are added. It is recommended to strengthen cleaning and facility maintenance. The service attitude is very good.

Then our room rate includes afternoon tea. If you want to change the time, call the front desk. The front desk let me contact the restaurant...

Position: Full marks. It's a 3-minute walk from the ski resort hall, a 15-minute walk from the county town, and a 5-minute drive. There are many ski shops along the way.
Health, hardware: 90 points. For details, please refer to the standard of four-star hotels in Beijing.
Hotel service: full marks. The check-in is very efficient, the room service responds promptly, and the overall is very user-friendly. A staff member at the bar in the lobby also helped out extra. I'm really sorry that I forgot my name! At around 9:00 p.m. on January 1, consume a bottle of White Bear at the same time.
Hotel dining: 90 points. In addition to the supply of main meals and quality clearance, simple meals are still provided during non-dinner hours. The style is a bit small but the taste is ok and enough to satisfy the hunger.

One shortcoming (key point): After checking out, take a taxi to the high-speed rail station. The security guards in the parking lot did not allow taxis to enter and could not drive to the entrance of the lobby. They tried to communicate to no avail and were told that the parking lot was managed by the ski resort. So we dragged a huge suitcase and took our baby to the entrance gate of the whole area, which took about 5 minutes. Saw other people walking with skis along the way. An employee in the lobby offered to help us pull our suitcases, thank you very much! !
Parking may not be directly related to the hotel, and the staff are trying to help. But I have to make complaints about it. Choosing such a hotel is for peace of mind. What's more, the time to take a taxi is not the peak traffic period (around 1:00 noon), and there is no traffic congestion in the park, and there is no need to restrict the entry and exit of vehicles. Hope the hotel pays attention to improvement.

msg:The most outrageous five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. Hotels at this price are standard international five-star prices in first-tier cities in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, but there are not a few points to complain about. I'm not a princess, so I'm particularly lazy to write comments, but I just couldn't bear it this morning.
        What happened was this morning I asked the waiter to deliver ice cubes, and he brought me a bag. I filled the ice bucket with ice cubes myself, and then I found this bag Burton? ? In my memory, Burton, a ski brand, doesn’t produce food, right? So where were those clear bags that brought me ice cubes the other day? ! Pretending to be something? ! I want to vomit! Then there is the washbasin. This is the sink that I washed myself with soap and towel, and the hole is still yellow and slippery. Next is the toiletries, each one is different? ! Did I stay at a fake Holiday Inn? ! Are you staying at Chengtang Inn? ! There is also a humidifier, I don’t want to touch it, it’s yellow and slippery! With such a level of cleanliness, did you slap yourself in the face by putting that card in the room? ! Are you still hosting Olympic hotels? ! Was there any mistake? !
        I booked one day on Ctrip and 3 days on igh's app, so I stayed on the 4th day in total. There were many, many complaints in the past two days. I didn’t want to embarrass anyone, so I didn’t take any photos. I've said it all the same. For example, the breakfast was poor. I didn't see any meat or protein from Monday to Wednesday. I only saw fried chicken nuggets with a lot of flour and not as good as McDonald's. There was no cheese or cold cuts in the salad stall. I saw cheese for the first time on Thursday. It was grounded. Qi is fine, but as an international standard, shouldn’t there be a standard? ! The nut brand says cashews, but actually there are only dried bananas and dried bananas every day. It was rare to see peanuts yesterday, and the bread was very dry and there was no jam. The breakfast at Yuelong Apar**ent on the mountain is better than this. I am a very lazy person. I am too lazy to change hotels and too lazy to write reviews. If it cannot be cleaned, I just wipe it myself. I feel like I ate flies today! A negative review is necessary!

The hotel facilities are very new, the space is relatively large, but it is a pity that you can't see the scenery of the snow field. The breakfast is average, but the service is very good. Basically, all meals are settled in the county. If you come to Fulong for skiing, your first choice is to stay on holiday.

msg:The service is average, and the price of the stay and slide package is very high. But the front desk really didn't understand this product, so we reminded us countless times, and the ski resort opened at 8:30 at the last minute before we got the ski ticket. The complaint telephone number given was also empty, very speechless. The next day’s snow ticket had to be confirmed with the ski resort again, only to find out that the hotel had under-issued the order number, otherwise a lot of time would be wasted the next day. The humidifier is not working, and there is no movement when I call for repair. There are many tables and only one chair in the room.
There is no shelf in the shower room, and the toiletries are on the floor!
The holiday inn turned into a five-star, quite speechless.

Accommodation and activities are very close to the scenic area. The room size is satisfactory and the facilities are complete. It is considered to be in good condition outside the Great Wall. Some suggestions are that hygiene needs to be further improved. There is no heating during the National Day, the overall feeling is relatively cold at night, and the restaurant serves food at a slower speed.

I changed the room twice after staying for four days. The glue ***** on the balcony door fell off for the first time. It rained the next day, and the roof of the five-star hotel was leaking. On the last day, there was no hot water after taking a shower and washing. How does this kind of hardware meet the Winter Olympics?

Ask the front desk if there is a fan or not. Let the windows open to ventilate and let everyone listen to the noise outside. It stops at 24 o'clock and starts again at 4:30 in the morning.
There is a little more luggage, so even if you don’t help move it, you have to drive away in the morning, and the security will not coordinate the construction vehicles to give way. Let us wait?
The service attitude of other service staff was pretty good, but the problem was not solved.
By the way, whenever you open a little window, all kinds of bugs will come.

The hotel is so bad that I will not come again.

The town has hot pot, Western food, fast food, barbecue, grilled fish... and there are many things to play. There is also a Big supermarket, very convenient. The musical fountain is very good. After dinner at night, sit down at the musical fountain and enjoy the breeze. It's very pleasant! The hotel is a 2-minute walk from the town. Although it is not in the center of the town, it is very quiet and not noisy. The room I stayed in on the first day was next to the opposite kitchen. The blower was very noisy, so I didn’t sleep well. I found the front desk the next day. Although the room was basically full in those two days, the staff Sandy was very serious and responsible, and helped me coordinate. Finally Helped us to arrange a quiet room, the view outside the window is also very good, and also very considerately helped us apply for a late check-out, which must be a five-star praise. In addition, the staff member Wen Chunyu knew that we were going to change the room, so he specially pushed a luggage cart up to help us move the luggage to the new room. It made people feel very heartwarming. I praise him for his thoughtfulness, five-star praise! The only regret of the hotel is that there are not many choices for breakfast, and some chefs are obviously not well trained. They are not familiar with the dishes provided, such as noodles, rice noodles, and rice noodles, and they are a little overwhelmed when there are many guests. Hope to improve next time I go!

酒店設施一般，定的不是親子房，所以，確實連個小童坐便器都沒有～不過，話説一半以上客人都是帶娃來的～
早餐也很一般……
服務也一般～
而且攜程上的酒店定位是錯誤的～給我們導航去了翠雲山的皇冠假日酒店，那邊的服務明顯好一些，耐心的幫我核對酒店，並給我重新定位了一下！

msg:到酒店前台，衹有一位在辦入住，另外兩位前台不是在聊天就是低頭打電腦看手機。等了一會終於喊我。

孩子肚子不舒服，五點多想説叫個客房服務，前台衹負責轉接餐廳，然後永遠沒人接，自己到一樓，問了三個人，每個人回覆都不一樣。

入住後房間悶熱，衹好打開陽台門通風，晚上八點沒有很涼，請服務人員來看，他隨便按兩下，我們以為我們按錯了。半夜12點多要睡了，把陽台門關上才發現房間沒有空調，悶熱到不行。兩點半，完全受不了打給前台，來看了之後説“對喔，空調壞了！我請工程部現在來修！”簡直傻爆眼，我們房內還有兩個幼童。半夜兩點半修理冷氣，你開玩笑嗎？！此時才在我們極度不舒服要求下，讓我們抱著孩子換到另一層樓，這時候來到半夜三點多，新的房間比原來更悶熱，沒有預開，沒有試，還沒有陽台可以開。此事，衹有攜程默默一直關心我們。直到五點多，我們一家四口累到不行，隔天行程也宣告全部泡湯。

隔天，前台詢問，您有什麼訴求。我沒有訴求！你們酒店真的不值得花這個錢去住，草原蒙古包民宿服務態度跟危機處理都比你們好多了！

唯一的一分是給早餐門口的小姊姊，就她最熱情，衹有她有五星酒店的樣子！

服務人員少得可憐，沒人幫拿行李～～
房間窗簾拉不嚴，有點影響休息～～
退房當天我們房型所在的樓層唯一的客用電梯壞了，沒有任何書面的通知和提示，打電話給前台，回覆不知道什麼時候能修好。多虧十五分鐘後保潔阿姨出現了，把我們帶到了隱蔽的員工電梯～～

前台最差，前台看到有客人等着辦入住不主動招呼辦理，客人得自己主動追着問才理你。晚上打幾個服務電話都忙音很久才接通。

msg:第一次來崇禮選了富龍雪場，對比下來綜合性價比比較高的雪場+酒店，離雪場出門100米距離，雖然不是滑進滑出也算是方便了。

先説好的地方，酒店大堂大，人不會都集中在大堂亂哄哄，去了翠雲山那個假日就是大堂很小，都是人亂七八糟的，早餐品種不説多吧但是基本能吃飽，餐食也一直在添加沒有快到點擺爛。服務員態度都挺好。
房間相對較大，這種一特大穿一小床設計也符合家庭出遊休息的舒服點，雖然房間也真的不便宜，可能是寒假裏。

缺點：
我這個房型都在一樓，網上評價説的廁所反味問題真的很明顯，第一天入住不知道是不是噴過去味劑了還好，第二天開始一直到退房每天進門就是一股廁所味道，也沒有每天去味。浴室的地墊也沒有，從第一天就沒有，叫了服務來給了我們洗浴的大毛巾，説用一下，所以大家儘量洗澡還是自帶毛巾比較好。

隔音反正還行，不怎麼吵要麼就是入住率不高，但是陽台出去都是房子，有沒有陽台也沒啥區別

總體來説廁所問題挺掉價的，其他都還行

房間有少許的裝修味，要白天打開涼台門放放風。它的衞生間可以點贊三次：一是夜燈亮度適宜（就是五星酒店也僅有少量可以做到）；二是衞生間是封閉式的（有效地隔絕了濕氣臭氣），而不是敞開式的（現在高檔酒店也越來越少了），提高了卧室的舒適度。三是衞生間的門不是左右推拉式的，而是門軸式的（高檔酒店唯一僅見，從中國古建借鑒而來？），推門而進、推門而出，避免了推拉門因維護不到位而常嘎嘎作響。
早餐對於128元的價位來説太一般了，品種不多花樣簡單，有食材不太新鮮，按五星整體水平太勉強。

一是訂房前想電話諮詢一下，結果前台電話從來沒有人接，形同虛設，這也導致後續
二是服務意識一般，主要是被高鐵到酒店的接駁車坑了，訂房沒有提醒可以坐接駁車，要走的時候詢問有大巴可以送站，沒有人告知上車點是在煥活酒店還是哪裡，直到一家老小在酒店門口等到大巴上車時間過了。
我想説作為一個初次到店的客人，有些訊息酒店不提醒，住客怎麼就能理所當然的知道呢。
房間不錯，但是離富龍的遊玩區和餐廳都有點距離，需要步行。酒店最方便的原來是煥活酒店。

msg:我必須把酒店和整個度假小鎮一起來評價了。因為住這個酒店就是衝著整個度假小鎮一起去的。

酒店本身住的房間都還挺好的，房間很大很安靜，設施也應有盡有。端午節去不冷不熱，也不用空調暖氣的。

吐槽為啥服務給分低：一個是早餐到了九點人多的沒地方坐，吃的也都啥也沒有了似乎也不填補了。真是端午節人流量估計不足嗎？以前我挺理解的，慢慢我也吐槽了，為啥讓消費者吃虧，接待不了這麼多人就別接嘛。

其次酒店和整個富龍度假小鎮給客人是整體的體驗，但是到了度假小鎮那邊什麼風鈴悦谷還是啥的商業遊玩區，真是鬧心。啥啥項目都要單獨收費！車挺的亂七八糟到處都是。遊樂項目一個纜車上山80元，上山後一個玻璃天梯上去鞋套2元一副，真是一種扣扣索索的感覺。一個套票328，玩的時候才發現一個大型的球狀那種蹦床不包含，卡丁車不包含。就是幾個巴掌大點的淘氣包，充氣堡，四次滑道。 對比一下去過的迪士尼，或者響沙灣，那種全包無限玩的服務，真是覺得這裏特小氣。

衹能説可能這裏冬天來滑雪才是主體，要想打造成四季玩樂的精品，還差很多。

不説太多了，房間打掃也非常粗糙，早晨醒來才發現被套的角落有兩小塊兒血跡。像是被蚊蟲叮咬後產生的，且能看出是洗過、但沒有洗乾淨的情況。因為急於趕行程，沒和酒店計較。總之，這家酒店是我期望較高，失望較大的典型了。

2點建議
1，淋浴間玻璃門的塑膠密封條老化產生缺口，導致淋浴時大量水漏出到外面，且廁所洗臉池附近沒有地漏，我們花了好大力氣用浴巾清理地面水。安排修理後，問題未徹底解決。
2，房費之外的一份早餐128元，明碼標價，個人認為不值，因為早餐品種不豐富。

五一假期出行，崇禮不屬於熱門目的地，雪季結束，夏季未到，天氣多變，早晚温差挺大。好在富龍其實有很多其他文體娛樂項目，因此遊客真的不少。30日酒店就滿房了。天氣也給力，30日開始艷陽高照，日照充足，風和日麗，有高原的感覺。

酒店的設施沒得説，畢竟是IHG旗下的酒店，硬件設施比較完備。

因為人多，自助早餐較為集中就餐，人多嘈雜，好在餐食供應還算及時，一切比較有序。午餐晚餐有中西餐廳，因為同行長者較多，因此中餐比較推薦，價格合理，口味不錯。

選擇的豪華房，45平米，房間足夠大，設施也齊備整潔，晚上睡覺看暖風，很舒適。

酒店位置和邊上的煥活酒店挨着，共享富龍雪場和其他娛樂設施，活動方便，出行便利。

個人覺得，唯一有點點遺憾的是酒店集團和攜程之間的合作銜接有點問題，4月份訂房時反覆致電攜程和酒店，確認了五一期間活動可以累計IHG積分，於是預訂了全家人5間房間多日入住，結果入住時卻告知不可以積分哈。我完全理解其中的問題可能出在哪裡，但是確實是預訂之前反覆致電確認過的。經過多次交涉，好在最後前台的一位矮個子女士努力協助，總算是累積上了一個人一間房的積分哈。

當然還有一些些其他的小問題，但是出遊總歸會遇到各種問題，不過，總體還是很滿意的，期待下次雪季或者夏季再次入住體驗。

兒子愛好騎車，早早就申請去張家口崇禮騎行。
本次出行，一波三折，改簽了好幾次行程，但無論攜程還是最終入住的張家口崇禮富龍假日度假酒店都給予極大的幫助，由衷感謝和感恩！
先説攜程，因為兒子學校教學安排及課外班老師調整，我們的張家口之行從最初的05.01-05.03調整為04.30-05.02，後又調整為05.01-05.02。因訂單超半小時不可取消，攜程的客服人員積極與酒店協商，最終同意給我取消。取消後我預訂不到原房型，攜程客服又幫我與酒店協商可加床房型，攜程小姐姐本第二天是調休，但為了最終解決我的住宿問題，特意將孩子送到學校後又跑到單位給我解決了最終住宿問題。換位思考，急客户所急，攜程客服棒棒噠👍富龍假日度假酒店棒棒噠👍
第一次入住富龍假期度假酒店，印象特別好。從停車到前台，到早餐餐廳，服務人員都超級好，辦事靈活，態度友好。
引導停車的大叔在引導我們停好車後，非要給我拿行李，太和藹可親了。
兒子騎行刮破了腿，沒想到前台竟然配備有紫葯水和棉簽，電話打過去不到兩分鐘就給我送到了房間🙏🙏
吃早飯時，人比較多，餐廳服務的小哥哥歉意地跟我説，不好意思，人比較多，服務可能不太周到，您多包涵。簡直太可愛了。點贊喲👍
入住時，酒店告知需下午2點前退房。由於頭天夜裡下雨，原定上午的騎行安排不得不延後到下午。我擔心兒子結束時滿身的汗和土需要清洗，就想着跟酒店商量一下能否加錢延長几個小時，前台接待我的Lydia小姐姐聽了我的情況後竟然免費給我將房間使用時間加延到了18:00。感動得我呀……張家口人民太可愛了，真的是愛你們。由衷祝願你們越來越好3。
酒店硬件設施好，工作人員服務好，相信你們一定會越來越好。💖🌹

這次來雖然還是在萬龍滑雪，但決定體驗一下富龍的酒店。由於富龍雪場已經基本關閉，幾乎包場差不多，很舒適。
服務人員態度不錯，各類設施照常運作，退房延遲到5點…給個五分好評吧

提個建議，人少時早餐是點餐制，吃的沒問題，但應該在預訂界面提示一下。

惟，1、性價比不高；2、自助早餐品類無變化，品質偏低；3、前台服務、客房服務、送餐服務，均為同一服務人員接線且極不專業，遇住客身體不適等情況無法提供任何有效協助，一言難盡。

酒店的房間住得很舒服，衹有一個BUG，沐浴間竟然沒有放東西的架子，最後衹能把洗浴用品放在馬桶上，不停的開門取用，太彆扭了。
大堂的書吧很好，選書都很有品味。
早餐廳的服務比較到位，但是疫情期間應該要求客人戴口罩取餐，雖然有提示牌，但面對眾多沒戴口罩取餐且大聲聊天的客人，並沒有工作人員制止。
兩個晚餐都是在酒店中餐廳吃的，第一晚很好，菜品味道不錯，其中78元的“蘆花雞”印象深刻，太好吃了。而第二晚，像換了個飯店和廚師的感覺，非常非常失望，圖中78元的“崇禮燉菜”衹有白菜粉條土豆和兩三片肥肉，另一個“走地雞”88元，衹有幾塊雞肉，下面半盤全是大蒜和葱頭（可以對比下最後一張圖，是頭天的蘆花雞），由於點完餐等了近一小時才上菜，雖然沒吃飽，也沒敢再加點，等不起了……三個菜二百多元，餓着肚子走人……

好的方面：酒店硬件設施很好，外面看很氣派，內部裝修也很上檔次，房間非常大，三分離衞生間，還有大浴缸。緊挨着滑雪大廳，來滑雪的話住這裏很方便。
不好的方面：整個崇禮感覺像個大工地，酒店前面的路上不停的走大車經過，灰撲撲都是土的感覺，周邊沒有什麼可逛的，如果不是雪季，住崇禮基本衹能在賓館呆著。賓館早餐非常一般，完全跟五星酒店不匹配，基本衹有普通商務酒店的水平，不知道跟非雪季客流量少有沒有關係。
