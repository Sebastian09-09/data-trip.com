msg:The worst Conrad Hotel in the world. It stated on website that hotel is newly opened in 2022 which means brand new hotel rooms & facilities but it fact it is the most awful hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed and it is overpriced. The tiles in bathroom are extremely dirty with black stains, hotel room smells like rotten veggie, all hotel staffs are rule. Upon my arrival around 1pm, receptionist greeted me with long faces, no welcoming gesture, asking me whether check in or out. If check in come back at 3pm coz they were fully booked. Although room changed but a pair of used slipper was placed inside the room. No adaptor available, all these requests are normal in international chain hotel. In Conrad Shanghai seems demanding. This hotel is not able to meet Conrad hotel standard, not even local hotel chain standard. It was like sleeping under the train coz the aircon was very noise. Never recommend it to anyone. And I doubt all the positive comments from other users. Why am I so ‚Äúlucky‚Äù?

The check-in time certainly took longer what i have expected at a hotel like Conrad. Nonetheless the gym was very impressive and the best thing I loved about this place. The pool lifeguard did not allow me to swim at 1015pm but I saw others entering the pool after me. I felt there was a bit misorientation when I first entered the pool area. There were no designated personnel or signage instructing where to take towels or what to do before entering pool.

Check in is a little slow , my husband (Chinese) would speak to the lady in Chinese and she would answer me (a foreigner) in English, completely ignoring him and after handing us our room cards communication stopped immediately. The lady couldn‚Äôt direct us to the elevators which are plentiful and quite confusing. The rooms are small, there are stains on  carpets and we knew the windows couldn‚Äôt open but there are also no air purifiers in the room so the air is really not good. Could really do with an extra bath towel , especially if you are two people and have no extra towel to dry your hair except for the hand towels. The Wi-Fi signal is not stable , the only good thing at the hotel is the interior look/ design.

And, the master switch did work partly. It could not turn off  the bathroom light could. At midnight, an electrician specialist entered the room for maintenance. Although the problem was fixed, it made the guest feel uneasy about this sleep. This situation should not happen under the Conrad brand.

Elizabeth's Front office manager was great in arranging the club lounge for us and Vicky at the Lounge was a great Host. Both of them showed the experience. And knowledge. about customer service. Besides that, the upper management of the hotel was missing in action on a busy weekend. 
Days off I was told. 
This hotel has the facilities and location to be a Conrad but somehow they are not being used the right way. Food was below standard both at the Lounge and the breakfast buffet in the morning was a disaster. If I pay 1200 for a room and need to find where to get my coffee and wait 12 minutes in line for an omelet. I wouldn't call that a 5-star service. But I let you be the judge

The only problem is that there are many blind spots for hygiene. I wonder if this room has not been occupied for a long time. There is dust on the edge of the bed and skin care oil. The most egregious thing is that the body of the hair dryer is left by the previous guest. Oil stains and greasy fingerprints, I hope the hotel will strengthen training on cleaning.

The hotel's breakfast is good, with traditional egg pancakes and beef porridge. The First Food is across the street, and I had a lot of fun shopping there.

I will come again next time to avoid the peak of winter and summer vacations.

There are taverns, coffee shops, and convenience stores next to the hotel. The hotel lobby is on the L floor, probably the 11th floor, and the concierge is on the first floor. There are elevators in different directions from the first floor to the lobby and from the lobby to the rooms. If you drive to the designated parking lot, you have to take three different elevators to get to the guest room.
Special thanks to the handsome guy Seven at the front desk for upgrading our room type, which made our experience with our children even better!
The facilities in the room are very clean! Everyone can rush with confidence! The snacks at the bar are delicious and both adults and children love them! If you are too lazy to go downstairs to buy coffee, there is also a capsule coffee machine in the room to satisfy your cravings. I especially like the memories of the TV background, which directly affects my aesthetic point. There is also a smart sound system in the room for listening to music. Sitting by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking at the People's Park and the towering buildings outside the window, listening to songs is really a great experience!

At about nine o'clock in the morning, the room next to me kept opening and closing for some reason. When I opened the door, I realized that it was for maintenance. Two people were chattering and it was so noisy. Please avoid lightning. For this money, it is better to stay in an ordinary chain hotel.

Just around the corner downstairs is the flagship store of mm Dou. You can walk to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street in just one cigarette, which is very convenient for tourists. Line 2 is closer to Renguang Station, a 200m walk and just across the street. .

I've been coming here since it was renovated.
Its characteristic is that it is quiet in the bustle. Because the floors are high, you can't hear the noise of Nanjing East Road, but you can overlook the hustle and bustle of Nanjing Road.

Facilities: Recently renovated, the convenience facilities are relatively new.

Hygiene: Auntie is very careful about cleaning and the room is spotless.

Environment: I booked a suite with a view this time, and the environment and scenery are very good.

Service: The service is slightly insufficient, maybe because there are a lot of people during holidays.
Room cleaning was delayed, but that's understandable. The clothes I left in the restaurant were found in time.

Because I decided to travel to Shanghai at the last minute, I didn't book a hotel in advance, but I found a surprise at Conrad Shanghai! The location of the hotel is very good, right on Nanjing Pedestrian Street, and it is very convenient to go to the Bund, Chenghuang Temple, and Yu Garden. The decoration of the hotel is very luxurious, with a sense of luxury, but it doesn't make people feel exaggerated. This time I booked a high-rise deluxe room (large room), which is very large and has a huge balcony, with a beautiful view of the entire Nanjing Pedestrian Street. The room facilities are very complete, with an oversized bathtub and a huge TV. The bed in the hotel is very comfortable and I had a very good sleep. The hotel restaurant is also very good. I tried their buffet. The ingredients are very fresh and the taste is very good. The service of the hotel is also very good. The staff are very friendly and make people feel very comfortable. Overall, Conrad Shanghai is a very good hotel. If you are going to Shanghai for a trip, I highly recommend this hotel. Whether it is a business trip or a tourist vacation, this hotel can meet your needs. If you haven't tried this hotel yet, then I strongly recommend you to try it, I believe you will have a very good experience!

It is also close to Huanghe Road, which was popularized by "Flowers". It takes only a few minutes to take a taxi to popular business districts such as Jing'an, Huaihai Road, and Nanjing West Road. It is super convenient!
Facilities: The hotel was renovated not long ago. Everything is very new and textured, which is in line with the tonality of the Conrad brand.
Hygiene: The guest rooms are cleaned very carefully, the bedding is also very new, the toilet is smart, the washbasin conforms to ergonomics, and children can also use it independently.
Environment: Very satisfied, it was a pleasant stay, leaving me with good memories!
Service: The hotel is a super high-rise building. Although there are many passenger elevators and a large public area, there are hotel service staff everywhere, and they will take the initiative to ask if I need help. It is very reassuring and considerate! In particular, Mr. Xia, the duty manager on duty at the front desk, helped me check in. He was warm and thoughtful. His skilled business level made me experience what it means to check in smoothly, and his elegant conversation left a deep impression on me. There is also Mr. Carl at the front desk, who is a handsome sunny boy full of warmth! The answers to my questions were not only patient and meticulous, but also very humane, which made me feel the hotel's unique humanistic care!

1. You can only check in at 3pm at the hotel. The front desk will only tell you that you can only get the room at 3pm. If you want to coordinate any issues, they will just say sorry to you.
2. The queuing time is very long. After waiting in line, they tell you that you can only get a room at 3 o'clock. Every guest is very angry.
3. The hotel room facilities are as shown in the picture. The luggage rack is a decoration. The wardrobe must be 1.8 meters tall to hang it. I'm 1.65, and I can't stand up even when I stand on tiptoe.
4. For breakfast in a restaurant, I asked the waiter for a latte for the first time, but turned around and forgot to give it. The second time I asked for it, I got an American cup, and asked for a change, but turned around and forgot about it again. It took the fourth waiter to get it. The right latte
5. Foreigner 1 came back from shopping and found a room card that did not belong to him under the bed. He asked the front desk if anyone had entered the room and asked the front desk to check.
6. Foreigner 2 was also very angry because of the room card problem and went to the front desk to argue. The intern next to him was at a loss and could not communicate in English. He had to use translation software. The foreigner hoped that a manager could come out to deal with it, but the front desk ignored him...
7. The guest asked why the service phone could not be reached after 12 o'clock in the evening, and the front desk said that no one answered...
Anyway, as long as you stand at the front desk for 5 minutes, there will be different complaints, but you will not get any reply. The front desk will always say four words to you very carelessly (this is how we are) - sorry

The lobby manager Chole has a good service attitude and handles problems quickly. Xintiandi/The Bund/found158/Nanjing West Road/Nanjing East Road/Jing‚Äôan Temple/Lujiazui are all nearby, which saved me a lot of transportation time. If you don‚Äôt want to waste time on the road, you might as well consider this place! For Hilton members, you can enjoy membership benefits, free breakfast for one person traveling with you, executive lounge, and afternoon tea are also good.

Let‚Äôs talk about the so-called smart facilities: the food delivery service can only be selected on the TV, and the remote control button settings are very complicated, which is obviously a challenge to me who is not good at games. There is a smart hub in the room, similar to Xiao Ai's classmate; but it cannot understand any instructions.
The noise at night, although it had nothing to do with the hotel, was from the scaffolding on the exterior of a building on Nanjing Road, which someone seemed to be repairing. The whole night was filled with tinkling and banging, resulting in a sleepless night.
Finally, let me talk about the wake-up call service in the morning. The phone was placed on the desk and not beside the bed; but the wake-up call only rang 3-4 times and hung up before I could answer it. I just returned to bed and said to lie down a little longer, and then it rang again ~ I was really afraid of what I felt.
At the end, the screen will only thank the distinguished guest ~ So, how can I, the lady who placed the order, reply to your hotel‚Äôs thanks?

However, the room facilities are quite old, one of the room phones is broken, and the water in the wash basin is super slow...
The most unreasonable thing is that as a diamond card, you are not assigned to the executive floor, and the elevator to the executive floor and executive lounge has to go to the lobby L floor to change, which is really very inconvenient... I only stayed for one night, so I didn't bother to change rooms. ‚Ä¶

I highly praise Faye who received us. After booking with Ctrip, we had to wait for a while before the hotel confirmed it. During this period, she has been eager to help us with the process. She is very patient and enthusiastic, which makes people feel like spring breeze.
The hotel has a great view. You can see People's Park and the Puxi skyline going in and out. The breakfast is also very rich and tastes great, especially the desserts. Everything is delicious. I will stay here again next time I come to Shanghai.

The lady on the L floor enthusiastically helps open the elevator and introduces the environment.
Disadvantages: The twin room booked was placed in the corner. The room was very small and the bed was very narrow. The two beds were almost next to each other, like one big bed.
The house price is more than a thousand, not worth it.

Although many reviews online said that the hotel was old and the service was indifferent, I felt it was okay after experiencing it. It was a bad idea, but the stay was okay, my friends had fun, and the room was big enough. We had communicated in advance that we wanted to see the Oriental Pearl Tower, and we were indeed satisfied. Unfortunately, there was too much fog in Shanghai, but the scenery was still good, the geographical environment was also very good, and we had everything we wanted to drink and eat.
I would like to thank Miss Natalie from the Executive Lounge. This is my first time to experience the Executive Lounge. The afternoon tea is a bit limited, only fruits. But when I asked Miss Natalie about the happy hour, she noticed that I wanted to go to the Executive Lounge. I shared it with my friends in the room. I was given a bottle of red wine as a special gift. Thank you very much~ Later I went to have breakfast in the morning. There were many things for breakfast and it was very comfortable!
The hotel also sent a cake, which was nice.
In short, I am very grateful to Conrad Hotel for giving me a good experience. I will come back next time if I have a chance!

msg:The address and location are excellent. Downstairs is the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street and opposite is the First Food Company. Check-in is convenient for the first time in Shanghai. However, the hotels on Nanjing Road are all old. This hotel is probably also renovated. You can tell by looking at the phone number that it is a certain age. I have stayed at Conrad many times. I read reviews saying that the service at Conrad Shanghai is not very good. It is true. The service attitude of the staff is very cold, not comparable to that in Macau, and they Is the doorman useless? The door is already in a busy pedestrian street and it‚Äôs difficult to get in. Moreover, the people at the door don‚Äôt know how to manage and direct the vehicles, making the door a mess. Look at the picture, and it can even be used to pick up and drop off passengers. It‚Äôs really true. It‚Äôs crazy to see that it‚Äôs not up to five-star standards, especially the shower in the bathroom. If water comes out of the shower, there won‚Äôt be enough water in the bathtub. In winter, the amount of hot water even when you wash your head and take a bath is not enough! Anyway, that's it, it's worth staying just because of the location. It's opposite Crowne Plaza, but I think Crowne Plaza has been around for a certain period of time before I chose Conrad, and I only stayed for one night!

The breakfast in the executive lounge is particularly good. The meals at other times are also good. However, there were a little more people during the Chris**as period when I stayed.
The main reason for the price is that there are many basic-level waiters, many of whom are quite unprofessional and can deliver the wrong coffee and some incredible service methods. However, some senior staff are obviously of Conrad's level and can respond promptly if there is a problem. Reasonably at least I am satisfied with the service and the service attitude is quite good.
At this price, it‚Äôs good to stay at Conrad in this area. You just have to be mentally prepared for some of the services.

However, I called the service depar**ent and they arranged for someone to come and deal with it as soon as possible. In addition, the hotel has a variety of breakfast options and a large space, which is also suitable for staying with children.

The hotel is close to the duty-free shop, which is very convenient for shopping, and you can also reserve discounts.

After the run, we returned to the hotel and took a long rest.

The hotel facilities and design are also very good, but the parking lot is a bit old.
The minibar menu is not visible in the room.

In addition, the hotel bears and ducks in the room are particularly cute.

msg:Conrad Shanghai is one of the worst Conrads I have ever stayed at.
The first point is that I have serious doubts about the front desk reception. The check-in service staff are all interns. They are unfamiliar with their work and have low efficiency. This is also the first time I have encountered anyone staying in a hotel and no one has come to ask if they need help with luggage.
The second point is that when I checked in on the first day, I arrived at the front desk at 3:10 and was told that the room type I booked was not available. Under the guise of upgrading the room type, I was assigned a deluxe room type on the lowest floor. It turned out that it was a full room next to the Executive Office. The house smells musty, and the window is blocked by eight water storage wells, with no view of the scenery at all. I asked to change rooms. At 3:40, the front desk asked me to go down and change the room card myself to the 28th floor. At ten o'clock the next morning, I called the reservation depar**ent to inform me of my request for room renewal. The receptionist at the reservation depar**ent asked me to go to the front desk to apply. I arrived at the front desk at twelve o'clock. After queuing for twenty minutes, a male receptionist informed me that I Has your house been checked in by someone else? ? I was shocked and did not check out. Then the male receptionist asked me to pack my luggage. I made it clear to him that I had a meeting at noon. The male receptionist arrogantly emphasized that that could only be done by our staff. I went to pack my luggage and change rooms for you, and called the reservation depar**ent in front of me and said that this room was booked by a group member. They did not deal with my problem, said that I could not extend my stay in the original room, and asked me to place a new order. Then I called Ctrip went to solve the problem. Ctrip spent ten minutes solving the problem for me, but from the beginning to the end until checkout, any Conrad employee did not communicate with me personally, not even an apology. Really rubbish, first time to experience such bad service. To lower the brand image, I will also send an email to the group to complain later.

msg:I received a return call from Conrad today. I truthfully reported the problems I encountered during the check-in process, but they were all responded to in a perfunctory manner. Finally, they shamelessly asked me to give them a five-star review in exchange for "benefits". After I refused, the other party quickly hung up the phone. Totally not the responsibility and service attitude that a big hotel should have. What I don't like about the check-in process is that the first time I arrived at the hotel to check in was after 15:00, and late check-out is usually between 13:00-14:00. At that time, I was told that rooms would not be available until 16:00. I expressed that I couldn't understand why it took so long to check in. The front desk arranged other room types for me to stay in. Although the hotel has carried out remedial measures, the premise is that when I was checking in, another customer in front of me chatted with the front desk for a long time. The customer next door had finished processing 3-4 customers, and I had not finished processing here. The front desk made other arrangements for me based on my emotions and their inappropriate arrangements. Secondly, the cleaning process is quite sloppy. The snacks I purchased were thrown away by the staff cleaning the room. A bag of snacks was all gone. One of the days, I was still in the room and ready to go out. The cleaning staff asked if they could provide cleaning services. Since I didn‚Äôt want to hinder everyone‚Äôs work, I agreed (because I could go out soon and there was no need to delay other people‚Äôs work). ) During this process, I saw a very sloppy cleaning process. Of course, I understand the chaos in these industries, but it was more interesting to see it with my own eyes. The problems are all minor, but the communication on the return phone call is completely insincere, just for a five-star review, and even benefits are exchanged for the review. I would be happier if the hotel truly listened to its customers in order to improve service levels. Although return visits and phone calls are also one of their work indicators, compared to Niccolo, they are much more sincere in dealing with customer complaints. The above is my third time staying at this Conrad hotel.

msg:We went during the National Day this year and booked in advance on Ctrip. Many hotels in Shanghai do not offer free parking, so I searched for it for a long time. Although this one costs more than 1k, the location and parking are convenient. It is next to Nanjing Road and there is a shopping mall downstairs.
1. I remember from the pictures on Ctrip that you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower in the high-rise rooms, but there are different room types in the high-rise rooms. . . So if it is just the difference between high-rise and ordinary floors, there is actually no need to pay 100 yuan more per night for a room.
2. The hotel is upstairs in a shopping mall, so it is really inconvenient to go downstairs every time. I have to go to Haidilao on the 8th floor to transfer to the elevator. . .
3. The size of the room is okay, but the aunt bothered me every day to clean it. Because the room was not available after 4pm on the first day of check-in, we were made to wait for a while and asked for ducks ü¶Ü and bears üêª as gifts. We were still very happy. .
4. During the National Day, Orange and All Seasons were both priced at 7.800, so I still chose this one.
5. The first food is also nearby, the butterfly cake is delicious. There is also a tea restaurant in the alley, which is also good.

The check-in queue was like a long one, and the hotel didn't even think of opening more counters. There are three counters out of eight in total. The hotel should be able to foresee the heavy traffic on weekends, right? I booked two rooms together, one on the 38th floor and one on the 35th floor. They refused to give me more room cards. It was very inconvenient for me to move back and forth between the two floors. The hotel room was not ready when we arrived at around 4pm, so we waited until after 5pm to check in. Won't go there again.

Check-in: There are four seats at the front desk. I arrived at 3:30. I only waited for five minutes and was told that the room was ready in advance. If there is no online transmission, you need to queue and wait for the room.
Inside the room: Very clean, without the musty smell spread online. Because I had a child, I prepared a bed surround in advance and a Conrad bear was placed on the bedüêª
Service: The guest service center answers the phone very quickly, and the delivery of things is not particularly fast, but I think it is within the acceptable range.
Travel: Too! square! Convenience! Got it! The joy of just walking two steps from the hotel to the subway station! ! (Taking a taxi is also very convenient!
Breakfast: The size of the restaurant is okay, but there are really not many categories. This can be improved. It is enough for me.
Check-out: also very fast, and we will call back in the afternoon

I didn‚Äôt believe it at first, but after actually experiencing it, I found out that the service here is real. How can I say it, everyone They all seem to try hard to provide you with good service, but they can't do it well at all. 1 For example, at the restaurant bar on the first floor, it takes 20 to 30 minutes for the waiter to pour you water. I went there three or four times in total, and twice I forgot to pour you water, and twice I had to wait for 20 minutes. I just gave you some water. You ask the waiter to come over and take away the finished tableware to make room. He really just takes the tableware away and ignores the food residue on the table. You need to remind him if he can come over and wipe it. I don‚Äôt think this is a five-star hotel.

After giving feedback to the front desk, the relevant personnel came over to clean and tidy up again, apologizing and explaining that it was because the dust raised during the final vacuuming fell back on. My mind was full of questions, shouldn't I vacuum and wipe again? 3. The shower water in the bathroom is very small. In short, it is much smaller than other five-star hotels I have stayed in. Perhaps it is because the floor is high and the pressure cannot come up. ? 4 The packets of potato chips I left in the room were put in plastic bags and thrown away as rubbish by the cleaning staff. 5. Customer service calls often go unanswered at night. It takes several attempts to connect... 6 The only good thing these days is that the air conditioner is quite cool, and nothing else.

Before choosing Conrad, I read the bad reviews of several hotels on the Bund (Jin Maoyue and some three-piece suite hotels). I was really impressed by the other hotels I checked in with Conrad. Guest verified. So I didn‚Äôt give much hope for how good the service would be. Assuming that the young lady has upgraded to a high-level building, it's okay.
Speaking of facilities, the ordinary rooms on the Bund are relatively small and comparable in size to Hong Kong hotels. Since the newly renovated rooms are relatively new, the bedding is very comfortable and great. The wet and dry separation in the bathroom is also okay.
A reminder for those who want to see the view of the Bund. If you want to see a beautiful view, you must choose a river view room, otherwise there will be no view to speak of.

The standard of a five-star hotel was so low, which left a deep impression on me. I will definitely not choose this hotel again in the future. Here are a few examples for reference: 1. According to the hotel's requirements, I checked in after 3 pm that day. I entered the room and wanted to take a bath. When I opened the bathroom, I found hair in the bathtub that made me look disgusting; 2. The facilities in the room were old and the cabinet door could not be closed. On the floor, the floor tiles are raised and not slippery; 3: The water in the toilet is not flowing smoothly, so I couldn‚Äôt call the engineer to repair it twice, and finally gave up (this hotel may be too popular, and there is no room inspection to release the room) 4: The next day For breakfast, there was no greeting from the service staff at the door, no guidance, no inquiry about coffee or tea (later I saw that this service was provided to foreign guests), and I didn‚Äôt want to mention the dishes. Let‚Äôs talk about the fruits. The watermelon was rotten, the cantaloupe was hard, and the banana was Head rot.

During my business trip to Shanghai, I booked this place because it was conveniently close to the conference. Who knew...
1. Since staying in a five-star international hotel feels like home, it has a decoration level such as 7day. Bad review!
2. The price of the Ctrip room is 40 square meters. After entering...haha, I really can‚Äôt feel it. Bad review! !
3. Everyone uses hot water when taking a shower. The red side is hot and the blue side is cold. I turned it on the blue side and the hot water can still help you remove hair in one go! Be especially careful if you take children with you! Bad review! ! !
4. Check-in is for two people, and the front desk registration is for two people. I am given a bath towel every day. Is there any management level? Bad review! ! ! !
5. When checking in, there were so many people in line that there were only two front desks open. Two waiters were chatting next to each other. When they saw me looking at them, they consciously went further away to continue the conversation. Can't you open one or two more front desks? Bad review! ! ! ! !
Not worthy of an international five-star hotel
Will not stay here again!

4. The hotel has nothing and charges for everything. There is only a toothbrush and not even a comb! ! The interior decoration of the hotel is not like that of a five-star hotel. It is relatively old and the facilities are average!
5. Conrad Bear will not take the initiative to give it to you when you see a child. Later, I asked the front desk and said that you have to get it yourself! What attitude
6. There is no concierge porter, so you have to move all your luggage yourself!
7. There are no free drinks or welcome fruits in the refrigerator! !
8. The most outrageous thing is! ! At 12 o'clock on time, the whole house automatically cut off the power! ! ! ! How could you have the nerve to cut off the power on time at 12 o'clock if you can't even provide the room on time? ! !
9. Look at the entrance of this hotel. There is only one entrance and exit in other hotels! ! The car obviously arrived at the door, but it was stuck in traffic for half an hour! ! ! !
Oh my god! ! I have never stayed in a five-star hotel like this, and I have learned a lot! Still in a big city like Shanghai, it‚Äôs really embarrassing

First of all, the check-in was written at 3 o'clock. We arrived and were waiting for check-in. The check-in process took about 15 minutes. This average speed may be longer. We got the room first. No one took care of my sisters' room until 3.30, so I called the front desk to ask. , said he had a house, asked why no one notified him, and said oh, maybe you didn‚Äôt receive the text message, he was speechless.
For takeout, there is no one to deliver it. You have to go to the takeout counter on the first floor. The attitude of the service staff is very average.
The room environment is also very average. The ladies' room has no slippers and only one bath towel.
I asked for mineral water 4 times
1500 per night, the service may not be as good as chain hotels
And the smoking area at the entrance is very strict. It's not even a meter away, but check-in at 3 o'clock allows you to wait until 4 o'clock. It's really speechless.
I have never written such a long negative review. It‚Äôs too bad. It really brings down the standard of Conrad. I will never consider staying at Conrad anywhere in the future. It‚Äôs too bad.

We arrived at the hotel at 11 o'clock on the day of check-in. We could not check in and needed to store our luggage. The staff at the luggage storage on the L floor did not smile the whole time. When we returned to the hotel to pick up our luggage at 10 o'clock in the evening, the staff there had already left work. No one informed us where our luggage had gone, and we went to the front desk to look for it; 2. There were stolen items on the sheets and pillows in the room, and there was mold on the edge of the bathtub; 3. The overall experience was poor and the service staff were not enthusiastic.

msg:It all looked pretty good when I made the reservation.
Especially the price, the price/performance ratio is straight up.
But after arriving at the store, I understood some of the reasons

Location transportation:

The location is really convenient and easily accessible in all directions.
It's very convenient to call a taxi downstairs. The area in front of the door is quite spacious.

Serve:

The service is a bit awkward, both at the front desk and concierge
I have a bit of a harsh attitude toward the delivery guy and makes picking up food cumbersome.
The doorman will not help pick up the luggage and will only chase away the taxi driver.
After checking out, I received a call on my mobile phone asking if I wanted to extend my stay.

Room facilities:

The room facilities are quite good, especially the bedding
The soundproofing is a bit awkward, but it's pretty quiet at night.
The bathroom facilities are average and the hot water is pretty reliable.
However, the bathtub has... broken skinü§îÔ∏è

There are many shortcomings. I never expected that the biggest feature is that it seems to be extremely short of manpower. In all aspects, it can be summarized in a thousand words: all aspects are at the level of a four-star hotel, including of course the price.

The view outside the Bund view room at 1800/night looks like this, on the 36th floor.
There is this old building opposite. The roof of the rooftop is so dirty that I want to go there and clean it. Those with mysophobia should choose carefully. .

In fact, it is not called Conrad, and many of its problems are not problems. Either the name is changed, or the service and hardware are improved. . So be it

msg:We checked into Conrad on April 3rd, and the front desk took the initiative to upgrade me to a suite. I was very grateful. In the evening, we had a buffet meal at the restaurant in Alley L11. The waiter greeted us with a smile. Although there were not many diners, the ingredients were fresh and rich. The family had a great time. We also met the new hotel manager Mr. Zhang in the dining room. He saw that we needed drinks and took the initiative to bring us freshly squeezed orange juice. We were very touched. Next time we stay in Shanghai, we will choose Conrad Shanghai!

msg:The second time I stayed at Conrad Shanghai, I felt very friendly. The location is in the city center. The service staff at the hotel greeted me warmly and thoughtfully, and the buffet dishes were also rich. There is a big improvement compared to when I came last year. We stayed in a luxurious king bed, and the waiter took the initiative to upgrade the room for me, which I was very grateful for. The swimming pool was closed on the day we checked in. After asking at the front desk, Mr. Zhang from the hotel personally came to tell us that we could swim the next day. I was moved by the spirit of Mr. Zhang and the service staff. I felt at home at Conrad this time! like!

The location is excellent, close to the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, and downstairs is the MM Bean Factory Store and the Lego Store. It is within walking distance of food, accommodation and entertainment, and is within walking distance of the Bund and People's Square. They are all on foot. If you want to buy Butterfly Pastry from the International Hotel, it is also within walking distance. It is particularly worth mentioning for family travel. The breakfast in the hotel is very rich. The swimming pool has a separate children's pool. The children like it very much. It is also very close to the Shanghai Museum of Natural History. Nearly, overall very satisfied.

msg:First, the hotel does not have an independent underground garage, and there are few parking spaces in the underground garage. The environment is poor, and there are garbage disposal areas everywhere. The entire basement exudes a smell all the time, which is not at all what a five-star hotel should be.
Secondly, the structure of the hotel elevator is too complex, and it is extremely inconvenient for people who drive to get to the hotel. I suggest that everyone stop driving. First, you have to take the elevator from the underground garage to the 8th floor, and then transfer to another one to the front desk on the L floor. If you happen to have takeout, you have to take another elevator to the G floor to get it. The hotel does not have door-to-door food delivery service. Because the floors are high, the elevators on the ground floor and the upper floors are separate. I have to go to four or five elevators to get back to my room. Some people thought I was playing 007.
Third, the hotel efficiency is too slow. First of all, I checked in at 10:30 in the evening. There was no one checking in at that time. Logically speaking, I should be able to complete the formalities quickly. However, I stayed at the front desk for nearly half an hour, and two or three people changed in the middle. I don‚Äôt know who was there. What are you busy with? It was already past eleven when I finally got to the room. Secondly, after checking out, my friend's charger was left in the room. I immediately went to the hotel and asked the cleaning lady to help me see if she could find it and send it to the front desk for me to pick up. However, the front desk told me that the cleaning lady couldn't be contacted and asked me to Waiting for her to call back, I would like to ask if this is reasonable? I was so angry that I just didn‚Äôt want the charging cable.
Fourth, in a city as developed as Shanghai, this five-star hotel actually requires a separate parking ticket, a ticket that is valid only if it is written on a piece of paper with the license plate. Moreover, customers were not informed or reminded in advance whether they had a car or whether they needed it. I drove to the garage gate and found that I had to pay 160, and then I remembered that the hotel should have a parking ticket. But I called the hotel and wanted them to explain the situation to the doorman over the phone and let me go, but the hotel insisted that I go up to the front desk on the L floor to get a parking ticket. As I mentioned above, the journey from the garage to the hotel is very tortuous. I checked out at 11:30, but wasted time to drive out of the garage at 12:05. During this time, I felt speechless countless times.
As a five-star chain hotel in the center of Shanghai, the problems listed above made my stay experience very poor. I am not sure whether I will choose you again because I am really disappointed.

It's very convenient to take a taxi downstairs, but the surrounding roads are very narrow and sometimes you have to wait for a few minutes. The hotel strictly abides by the 3 pm check-in policy. If you arrive early, you will have to wait for a room. Because you are traveling with an elderly person, the hotel still helps coordinate and arrange a room half an hour early. The hotel service is also very good. Friendly reminder: It seems that only rooms above the 40th floor are equipped with electric smart toilet seats.

The service is basically unremarkable: I arrived at almost 12 o'clock in the evening, and the check-in process for the first two groups actually took almost half an hour; the card was not written on the first time, and the elevator could not go up; invoicing was cumbersome, and I had to fill in the information myself because I did not reserve a room. No. No call was made, and even though I called, the call still didn't arrive. We moved to the Hilton the next night and the experience was completely different.
The room size is seriously misrepresented, very cramped, and the facilities are average.
I don‚Äôt know if it only deals with regular customers, but there are no signs on either the G or L floors, so it took me a long time to find it at the front desk.
A masseuse approached me at the elevator entrance.
The breakfast was quite satisfactory, no surprises or surprises.

The Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street is just around the corner, and the night view of the Bund and People's Square from the lobby is truly amazing! Walking to the Bund and Xintiandi, Nanjing East Road is also super convenient! This time we originally booked 3 nights, but due to travel reasons, we had to cancel the last night, and the hotel was very quick to handle it immediately! When I checked in, I was generously upgraded to a room. I would like to give a big thumbs up to all the front desk staff (all of whom are beautiful girls Faye) for their professional attitude and service level. Thank you! Breakfast is also very rich. It is a hotel worth recommending! I wish it better and better!

You need to transfer to the elevator to enter the hotel from the parking lot. The privacy is not so good
The location is very good, just on Nanjing Road, close to the Hongkou Football Stadium, just to listen to the concert, so I booked the hotel

Service: Average, maybe because there are too many people, but it is not too busy, the staffing is relatively small, it is not as good as Hyatt, neither warm nor cold

The room is a bit small, and the bathroom has a shower and a bathtub, which is a bit cramped

msg:I often stay at hotels under the Hilton Hotel Group. I have also stayed in Conrad several times, and I can say responsibly that Conrad Shanghai is the worst hotel I have stayed in, bar none. The following is what happened when I stayed in Conrad. I booked through your platform to stay in Conrad on the 19th and check out on the 21st, because I had two children, an old man and a lover, a total of five people and two I had a piece of luggage, so I wanted to park the car in the temporary parking lot on the first floor of the hotel. I saw the staff in the parking lot. On the premise that there were enough parking spaces, I communicated with him because I had two children and an old man. I need to stop for a while. After I go upstairs to the front desk to check in, I will drive to the underground parking lot. But the parking staff at that time had a very bad attitude and asked how long you parked. I said about 20 minutes. The staff was very reluctant to let me park the car in the parking space, and then said please hurry up. I really don't understand that the parking spaces at the entrance of the five-star hotel are reserved for luxury cars? The first floor of this hotel is on the G floor, and the front desk is on the L floor. As soon as you enter the hotel lobby, it is overcrowded. There are people on the sofa and on the ground. Since I stayed in this hotel for the first time, I don‚Äôt know the hotel environment, and I don‚Äôt know the hotel reception at all. On the G floor, there is no welcome at the gate on the first floor, and there is no manager in the hotel lobby. After searching for two minutes, I found someone who looked like the front desk. Upstairs, I was like, are all the staff in a five-star hotel like this? It took me a long time to find the elevator on the upper L floor, and finally found the front desk. The time is about 2:30 to 3:00. I booked a luxury suite (including two breakfasts). I thought I could check in directly, but the front desk staff turned out Let me know that the previous guest in this room hasn't checked out yet. After the guest has left, ask the room attendant to clean it for you. I asked the waiter about how long it will take, but the front desk clerk said it was not good. Please leave me a call and then you can clean it up first. I had no choice but to find a place to rest or go for a walk, because the children hadn‚Äôt had lunch yet, so I took the children to eat first. After eating, it was about 5:30, and the hotel hadn‚Äôt responded yet. I directly reported this matter to Ctrip's butler. At that time, Ctrip's butler had been helping me communicate with the hotel. I have encountered this kind of thing in other hotels before, but the results of other hotels' handling He directly gave me a free room upgrade and apologized to me. I don‚Äôt know why this Conrad‚Äôs service is so bad. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs accidental. It must have something to do with the management. The same is for service. After communicating with Ctrip , Ctrip helped me coordinate and help me deal with the problem at the first time, and finally Ctrip took out part of the cash as compensation to me. I thought this was the end of the matter. There is no men's razor in this room. I called the front desk at around 8 o'clock in the evening. I called the front desk three times and no one answered the phone. The next morning, I went to the restaurant for breakfast, went to the restaurant door, and swiped the room card. The restaurant waiter told me that breakfast was not included. I told the restaurant waiter that you could check it out. I included double breakfast, but the restaurant waiter told me You can only go to the front desk to verify it yourself. I can‚Äôt verify it. I have no choice but to go to the front desk and ask the front desk clerk to see if my room includes breakfast. The front desk clerk told me that it does not. I will take my order from Ctrip I went out to show the waiter, but the front desk clerk didn‚Äôt say anything and added it to my room card, and then I told the front desk clerk by the way, I said yesterday that the front desk promised to give me a breakfast, and the front desk didn‚Äôt verify it. , just tell me that I will write you three breakfasts in the room card. You must know that there are so many loopholes in the management of this hotel. I want it to come out with 5 more breakfasts. It really overturned my management of Shanghai Conrad Hotel. cognition. One can imagine how long it has been without regular meetings and assessments. Finally, I secretly tell the big Vs who are doing hotel reviews on the video platform that there is a lot of dust under the TV cabinet in the living room of the luxury suite in this hotel. I am responsible to say that it is definitely not the dust of a day, it is definitely the staff who cleans the room The place has not been cleaned. Apart from being in the center of Shanghai, this hotel has a very good view, but it is not an ordinary room. It is a luxury suite on a high floor to see the view. By the way, my room is in The 62nd floor, the 65th floor of this hotel is a restaurant and maybe a bar after 8 o'clock. It is noisy at night. If you have trouble sleeping, please be careful on this floor.

1. The room is small and the facilities are outdated. The glass in the bathroom is transparent, so there is no shelter when taking a shower.
2. The service is extremely poor. It is difficult to get through the phone at the front desk. I got through and asked for a quilt to be delivered to the room, which took an hour.
3. The hotel does not provide any food delivery service, and you need to find it if you order takeaway.
4. The hotel does not meet the standards of a five-star hotel.

First of all, the room is like a sauna, and the indoor temperature is 27 degrees. I contacted the hotel, just to take a look, and there is no solution. Since we have to shoot and have a lot of things, it is not convenient to change hotels. We stayed for 3 days in a row, and responded to the customer service depar**ent for 3 days, but no one solved it. On the fourth day, I finally couldn't stand it anymore, and the air conditioner in the lobby outside was still cool. Just rely on an electric fan to blow the air. The management of the hotel is really bad, and it has not been resolved, nor has it been said to change the room. It is a hot summer, and I would like to ask you to sleep in a room with an indoor temperature of 27 degrees. How do you sleep? (We responded for 3 days, but we didn't solve it.) Anyway, after staying once, we won't come again. Service is really important, if you also want to experience this service, then come and live.

msg:Did not step on mine! The children celebrated their birthdays. In previous years, they used to stay at the Hyatt on the Bund, but his house is currently being remodeled, so we decided to stay in a hotel where you can see a three-piece suite for one night. So we checked the old Xijiakang‚Äôs brand and booked a luxury suite. It can be regarded as the second-tier suite below the presidential suite. In fact, there is a Bund view suite above it, but the area is not as large as the noble suite~
I don‚Äôt know why there are so many bad reviews on the front desk in the comment area. Although the check-in on the executive floor has been placed on the L floor since 7/1, the front desk on the L floor has a good attitude. They take the initiative to ask questions, help with luggage, and explain and answer. Very detailed and thoughtful. The view of the executive lounge is invincible, and the service is also very good. The main thing is to be friendly, as long as the young girls are more sophisticated~
Tell me about the room~
It is indeed the room I fancy! The bedroom is facing the three-piece suite, the study and the living room also have a view of the Bund, and the restaurant has a whole wall of floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the People's Square. It really has a panoramic view of the bustling Shanghai Bund!
There is a Conrad bear on the bed. By the way, the purple duck in the bathroom is also a gift~ Don‚Äôt forget to take it away!
Summary: Thanks to the birthday star, there is no thunder! Did not step on mine!

The set seems to have the largest area of ‚Äã‚Äã134 square meters, which is really shocking. One bedroom, three living rooms and two bathrooms. But the disadvantage is that you can't see the view of the Bund. You can only see the river view in the elevator hall. The check-in was also very smooth, and I specially timed it. It took 8 minutes to check in at 4 pm on Saturday. There are not many breakfast items in the executive lounge, and there are few people. The most impressive thing is that the watermelon juice is really sweet. LOL. The overall feeling is quite good. It feels better than the penthouse of Villa Moller at the same price.

The biggest problem is the service. The front desk clerk didn't even raise his head when talking to you. He asked me if there was a depar**ent store downstairs. He asked me to check Baidu myself. When I called to ask for more bottles of water, he didn't answer the phone for two minutes.

msg:1. First of all, the check-in process was very slow. Whether I checked in at 3 a.m. or extended my stay at noon the next day, I had to wait for a long time.

2. After entering the room, another note reminded us that until January 30, there will be people cleaning the windows outside at any time from 8 am to 6 pm every day. As a result, I did not dare to open the curtains when I got up in the morning. This experience was very unpleasant. Well, I have encountered window cleaning time before, but it is usually between 12 and 3 o'clock when checking out.

3. The toothbrush set was available on the first day, but not provided on the second day. We also called the front desk to ask for room cleaning, and then the aunt came to help us clean the room. Moreover, the care package is in good condition on the outside, but empty on the inside when you open it. Many details still feel incomplete.

4. The advantage is that the transportation is really convenient, the house price is not very expensive in the most central area, and the overall decoration is relatively new.

msg:An inexplicable and disappointing check-in experience. The inexplicable thing is that this hotel perfectly avoids all the advantages of the Conrad brand. Except for the service in the executive lounge, the other places can be said to be completely inconsistent with the quality of Conrad. Dry.
Service has always been one of Konrad‚Äôs core competitiveness. Proper and considerate service has always been the reason why I choose Konrad, but Konrad in Shanghai can‚Äôt realize this at all. Except for the lobby, The managers of the restaurant on the L floor are more friendly and sincere, but the rest rarely smile. It is probably due to too many tourists and insufficient manpower. Everyone does not have any eye contact and interaction with the guests, and many stations are too late to receive. , There is no location, no one asks about coffee and tea, there is rubbish on the ground, respond to the waiter, the waiter will not do it and hate you, all the products are shocking, to put it bluntly, this is it The level of breakfast is not even as good as an ordinary Hilton, let alone a Conrad. There are too few types. Except for one pancake that can be eaten in the whole restaurant, the rest are too poor. What kind of muffins are they made of? So disappointed! It is strongly recommended that Conrad's executives go to experience it on the spot! Is this the Conrad I am familiar with? !

msg:A more fair review, not as bad as the online reviews. Bears and ducks will be given if you ask for them. I don‚Äôt know if the soundproofing is due to the executive room I live in. There are relatively few rooms upstairs, so I feel it is quite quiet. The service staff are very friendly. The overall service attitude is very good. The room service is indeed slow. The customer service staff who contacted the executive lounge during the day responded very quickly. At night, the call to the executive room was unreachable. The response for ordinary services probably took more than half an hour. You do need to transfer to the elevator for underground parking, and the front desk does not ask if you are driving. You need to ask for a parking ticket yourself. There is no charge for the crib, but there is no quilt. It took an hour for the baby to fall asleep before getting it. The executive lounge does not accept check-in, and they say they have been moved downstairs. The wait for check-in was not bad, it only took 10 minutes. Generally speaking, it's okay. Maybe the passenger flow is peak during summer vacation and there are not enough staff. Be more tolerant and maybe the experience will be better next time.

There were omissions in every step of the service from check-in to check-out. ! The efficiency of the front desk was low. When we checked in at 8pm, there were only twos and threes of guests in front of us. There were also three check-in counters, but we had to wait for more than half an hour before it was our turn to go through the formalities. The room was not cleaned in time. The next day, we came to clean it at 2 or 3 pm. After the cleaning staff left, we started to take a nap. After ten minutes, there was a knock on the door again and he said that the dirty bath towels had not been taken away. We all fell asleep and were woken up again. After checking out, I asked the front desk to issue an invoice. The invoice was not sent until the next day. After staying for two nights, it was only opened for one night. I had to call to ask again before I was told that it was missed. In short, every link is missing, which is amazing! I can accept old facilities. I have stayed in very old hotels, but as long as the cleaning is clean and the service keeps up, you can live comfortably. The facilities at this Conrad are old, the cleaning is not clean, and the service is poor. Not in place, really down.

In fact, there is no change whether you upgrade or not. In the final analysis, it is just a lie. What's even more annoying is that when I checked out, I asked for an invoice, and they said it was an electronic invoice. I said we are seniors and don't know how to use electronic invoices, so I asked for a paper invoice. They said they couldn't provide it. I wanted to provide the invoice to the consumer. It is a must-have for stores. Why can't they provide paper invoices? As a store, you must think about consumers and elderly consumers. Moreover, the service attitude is not correct.

There are many people at the front desk of the hotel no matter what time, and the queue is full at noon in the evening. There is no one to guide you, and there is no quick check-out.

This time I went to ask for the [Northwest] facing room I had last time, but the front desk told me that it didn‚Äôt exist without even looking at it. Please, I don‚Äôt want a room facing the Bund! I was told that it only faced Nanjing Road, but I didn't care. In fact, when I checked in, I found that the room was facing Yan'an Road. It's funny, the front desk didn't know the direction of the room at all!

I brought wine to the room to drink and ordered an ice bucket, but it was so dirty down there! ! ! ! ! Help! ! ! ! ! There must be thousands of years of mud in here! ! I can‚Äôt believe your staff didn‚Äôt look inside when they poured the ice! ! !
There was no red wine glass in this room. I called and asked for it, and a super mini cup was delivered! ! Because it was my second stay, there was a normal red wine glass in the room where I stayed for the first time. I called the front desk and asked for a normal glass. I was told that there was no such cup. I told me that it was my second stay! I was sure there was a normal cup, but when I delivered the ice bucket for the second time, a man came to deliver it without a cup. When I asked, he told me that there was no normal cup! I emphasize again that it was there when I stayed last time! And I had photos on my phone, so I said I would try to find them! He also muttered that it would take a long time to wait ~ I am also quite busy. Please! It was 11 o'clock at night at that time. It's so busy. Please ask the hotel to recruit more people!

In short, I'm really speechless. I didn't care when I read reviews about this hotel's poor service, but it was my turn! üôÑÔ∏è

When I entered the room, I found that it was not even equipped with hand towels. The room The decoration is very old and has a lot of damage. I will not stay at Conrad Shanghai again. Conrad Guangzhou and Conrad Hangzhou are a thousand times better than Conrad Shanghai!

msg:I chose this hotel because of its strategic location, but other aspects are really unsatisfactory! There is basically no service at all. There is no one to guide you when you enter the lobby, no one to help with your luggage, no one to say hello. The staff you see are just standing there, not busy or saying hello to the guests.
I went to the front desk twice after 12 o'clock and before 3 o'clock and was told that there was no room until after 3 o'clock. Of course I know this is a common saying and operation of hotels~
After checking in, I came back to get the room card in the evening, and my luggage was not placed in the room in advance. The staff in the check-in and check-out procedures were very mechanical, without any smiles or emotions, especially when checking out, our room was the only one in the lobby to handle the procedures. There is no service either.
The room hygiene was also not satisfactory. There was some liquid solidified on the desk, and there were hairs from other guests on the sofa.
I don‚Äôt know if the Hilton brand is like this. The overall stay experience is better than the location, and I really can‚Äôt compliment anything else!

msg:The location of the hotel is relatively good. It is located in the center of Shanghai to the Bund, Shanghai Museum, Sixing Warehouse, and Waibaidu Bridge. It is very convenient for city boys who can walk in Shanghai. The hotel shows on the platform that it will be renovated in 2022, but it is actually Shanghai Shimao The Royal Le M√©ridien was remodeled. The rooms in the building are not raised high, and the layout is not particularly good. The check-in lobby is on the L floor (it should be the 11th floor). From the 1st floor to the L floor to the lobby, you need to use a different elevator from the lobby to the room floor, which is troublesome and inconvenient. The gym and swimming pool are on the 10th floor of the hotel. Take the elevator to the L floor, pass through the hotel lobby, and take the stairs down. The swimming pool is relatively small and the gym is not particularly large. There are no supplies in the changing room, only relatively simple shampoo and shower gel. No mouthwash, toothbrush or razor like other hotels. The locker room is far from the swimming pool and gym. Swimming and fitness have to go through a long corridor and up the stairs from the changing room to enter. Personally, I feel that it is embarrassing for ordinary guests to wear swimming trunks in the corridor. Swimming and gym should be outsourced, shower gel and shampoo are of rubbish quality. The bathtub and shower in the hotel room are in the same partition, which is not very convenient. The hot water bottle is very dirty. It seems that it has not been cleaned. There are no A4 paper envelopes in the room. I feel that A4 paper and envelopes are standard in the room. Since it was a special forces trip, I didn't experience much about the service of the hotel. The hotel did not have a welcome gift for check-in. I called the front desk and asked the front desk to send it only for suites. Conrad‚Äôs standard bear is not delivered to this hotel, and it‚Äôs only given to the suite when I asked. I booked for three nights. When I first checked in, I felt that the experience was relatively poor. It felt like the hotel was paying special discounts. To sum up, as a newly renovated hotel in 2022, I think the overall interior decoration feels old. The price of around 1000 is mainly to buy the location of the hotel. The recommendation index is not high. As a former hotel colleague, accommodation > environment > price > cost performance > service.

Going to the restaurant for breakfast, the waiter told you that you can't enter the room with slippers. After going back to change shoes and entering, I found that there were guests wearing room slippers for dinner. I asked the waiter and only replied that she didn't see it. I hope to find an explanation. I didn't apologize from the beginning to the end. I blamed me for not worrying about what she didn't see. I even questioned whether the guest asked her to beat the man in slippers to solve the problem. Is the service like this now? Is it that hard to say sorry? ?
Does anyone else dare to use such a service?

Check-in at around two o'clock was not a long queue as mentioned in the reviews, and we checked in directly. (Maybe lucky not to meet the development meeting). In terms of service, when I first entered the hotel, when I met the staff, they were all smiling and eager to provide service. Let me praise Eli by name. He is super nice and gentle, making people feel at home.
The guest rooms in his house are quite satisfactory, and the decoration status is relatively new. Hygiene did not say, or OK. The breakfast is relatively rich and tastes good, which can meet the needs of the general population. Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio is very high, and general business travel is no problem.

I arranged to upgrade the rooms in advance and prepared the necessary items. I was very enthusiastic and had an excellent service attitude! Kudos to the professional hotel staff!
  
  There are many breakfast options, high quality online, in line with brand standards!
  The only shortcoming is that the elevator from the parking lot to the hotel lobby is quite circuitous, and you need to queue up to enter during the evening rush hour.
  Conrad Hotel will be one of my first choices when traveling to Shanghai!

msg:It's my fault for being poor. The Conrad with over 1,000 yuan can only be used as a quick stay. The toilet is very strange, with a broken nozzle and a broken drain. The whole room has strong traces of renovation, like a private house converted into a B&B. If I could do it all over again, I would rather stay at Atour, which at least provides services. Any basic services must be obtained repeatedly and discussed with Ctrip. More than 1,000 yuan is a convenient place to live in Shanghai, and more than 2,000 yuan is quite comfortable. Also, there are too many strange women in the lobby, and those who follow them upstairs are really bad. Q, can you please take care of it? I live in such a bad place. Is this place cleaned well?

msg:On a business trip to Shanghai for one night, I saw that Conrad was re-opened in 22 years (the original Emmy) and decided to experience it for Conrad's reputation. but! completely lose hope! Never live again! Poor service attitude! ! ! The service attitude of the front desk and the concierge are very poor! Hotel facilities are not very new! The restroom layout is simply weird. The water temperature control is also very slow, either cold or hot! The hotel is not suitable for business travel, only for tourism, the traffic jam around is severe! Almost missed the flight.
The service was so bad that it was really outrageous. It rained heavily at night and wanted to go out to buy something. I asked the concierge on the first floor to borrow an umbrella‚òîÔ∏è The concierge initially said that there were no umbrellas, but there are obviously many umbrellas behind us. Shouldn't we just point out that the umbrellas are right behind? The concierge boy said indifferently: We only provide it to guests. Only take out the room card to prove that you are a guest! The little brother reluctantly took out an umbrella, and after taking it out, we asked for another one. The little brother said: We only provide one umbrella in theory, there is one in the room, you go back to the room and get it. I really have a look of doubt. If it is not urgent, I must take it from the room. It shows that I am in a hurry to buy something and return it soon. The service staff was still reluctant, until we expressed our serious incomprehension and at the same time another staff member came and said give it, and then got the umbrella.
During the stay at the hotel, all the service staff did not smile, and the front desk staff also kept emphasizing "normally speaking". How can there be so many normal speaking in the service industry? It seems difficult to understand each other in this hotel.

At night, the through door of the takeaway cabinet is closed, so you need to go out of the hotel and go around half a circle to get the takeaway.
The layout of the room is good, but the sanitation is not particularly clean.
I asked the front desk for the Conrad bear and asked to call the customer service to deliver it.

Location is important, but cleanliness and service are more important = Not recommended.

I guess the staff doesn't speak English.
Communication is difficult because they speak Chinese English.
They always speak English well, but when you ask a question, they don't speak English from then on.

Not clean. I looked closely to see if the bed was clean, but there was a lot of hair under the pillow. The water didn't flush in the sink, and in the end, the bathroom smelled like cigarettes, so I asked to change rooms, but I'm glad they changed me right away.

Breakfast not tasty. It was worse than 3 or 4 star hotels. Not recommended. What a waste of money.
But from the executive level onwards, it seemed like breakfast was eaten somewhere else.

I didn't have high expectations, even if it was a 5 star hotel, but since it was a Hilton affiliate, I thought it would provide adequate service, but it wasn't even up to that standard, so I was very disappointed and I don't think I'll go there again.

After checking in, I wanted to get a drink from the mini bar. Not to mention that there was nothing good to drink. The drinks lady at the mini bar didn't check. The cola was all opened and not replaced. I didn't want to touch the mini bar at that moment.

I took a shower at night and found that the bathroom drain was not clear. After washing, the whole bathroom was wet. I contacted the front desk. It took a long time before someone came to clear the water. Then I asked if I wanted to dry the water (I must do it? Do I still need to ask?) and then changed it. Someone came and only got two new floor mats and asked the same question again‚Ä¶.

After taking a shower, I wanted to wipe off the lotion, but found that the lotion was also empty. My aunt didn‚Äôt even check it. I thought I had called the front desk so many times and was about to check out, so I didn‚Äôt bother to say anything more.

The hotel has nothing to say about these. I hope you will improve in time and not let down the Conrad brand. Thank you..

msg:I would like to mention two points for improvement: 1. The room I stayed in was very unclean and there were bugs. The bathtub was very unclean and there were hairs in the floor drain. I seriously doubt that the bathtub was not cleaned. 2. There were very few counters open. I arrived at close to 4pm that day and there was a queue. After waiting in line for a long time, I was told that the room I booked was not clean. At the front desk, there was a short woman with long hair and a round face wearing glasses. She had a very bad attitude. She was very reasonable if she didn't have a room? ? He said coldly that there was no room. I asked what I should do and was told that I had to wait. I understand that you are busy, you don‚Äôt know how to speak well, and you still work without being trained. Is it difficult to say sorry that the room is not clean yet? Please wait for a while or help me ask how long it will take before you can give me a room? What kind of service is this? There is no basic courtesy. One person represents a hotel. I suggest that people in the hotel who are not well-trained should not embarrass themselves by embarrassing themselves. This is the first time I have spent money when encountering such a stinky person. Being slapped in the faceüëéüèª

She has a special liking for this hotel. I stayed with her this time and had a lot of time, but I can feel that the service of this hotel is still very attentive. Although the facilities are a bit old, the service level makes up for the shortcomings of the hardware. Ryan upgraded to a premium room. The bed was very comfortable. The lounge on a high floor had a great view. HH and breakfast were very good. The location was also very good and the transportation was convenient.

msg:1. The concierge looked at each other when he got out of the car and came towards him, but at the same time a Mercedes-Benz came behind him, but he turned around and opened the door for the guests in the Mercedes-Benz. Shouldn't the service staff pay attention to the first-come, first-served order? Are the services sorted by the luxury level of the car?
2. Walk into the first floor and go to the lobby. The elevator signs are not obvious.
3. The staff who came to you did not tell you where the elevator was.
4. There are only two staff at the front desk of the hotel, and they are not familiar with the business. It took more than 20 minutes to check in.
5. As soon as you exit the elevator on the executive floor, you will be greeted by the smell of the restaurant. There is no a**osphere and fragrance that should be expected in a 5-star hotel.
6. There is no controller button on the bedside curtains in the room to control the opening and closing of the curtains.
7. Breakfast on the executive floor is single, two kinds of hot noodles, and six other snacks
8. The welcome service in the breakfast room was extremely poor. We were not allowed to wear slippers in the hotel. They said it was an image issue and they even told me in English (fortunately, I understood it and I called the front desk before eating and the front desk told me the truth). It‚Äôs okay to wear a bathrobe when going out to eat, so why is there an image problem when wearing hotel slippers?? What‚Äôs the problem with customers wearing any clothes?? Is it nudity?
9. When I entered the breakfast room to order noodles, the greeter came over and told me that there was only hot wax noodles. I asked what hot wax noodles were, and she said hot sausage noodles. It‚Äôs obvious that the noodles need to be hot, so why not just tell customers that only sausage noodles are left? Do you think hot wax noodles make you feel more advanced? ?
10. After finishing the meal, I immediately asked the service staff to call the restaurant manager. Unexpectedly, I called the staff with low service level to act as the manager. After a lot of trouble, I called the real manager on duty.

The stone in the bathroom is stained, the edge of the desk is slit, and the primer inside can be seen from the hard bag on the wall. Let me focus on the check-in experience. It was very, very bad. It was the worst hotel among all the hotels I stayed in, bar none. 1. After a long wait, I didn‚Äôt get the room until after three o‚Äôclock. Not long after I entered, a room staff member inexplicably swiped the card to enter the room without knocking. 2. The bedside alarm clock rang inexplicably at 12 o'clock in the middle of the night. I couldn't turn it off, so I had to unplug it. 3. The bedside phone rang inexplicably at 5 a.m., but there was no sound when the call was connected. The whole check-in experience was very strange and left a huge shadow. It is completely unworthy of a star hotel, let alone Conrad.

Feel the hotel's customer-oriented heart.
The executive lounge on the 44th floor is very considerate, and everything tastes good.
The location is superior, the Nanjing Pedestrian Street is downstairs, and it takes 45 minutes to get to the airport. Ôøº
The swimming pool needs to wear a swimming cap. Is it a lifeguard requirement? Therefore, no one uses it basically all day long, and the water quality remains extremely clean.

msg:As a star hotel in Shanghai, there is no dedicated parking lot. I waited for more than ten minutes to check in. The room was cold when I entered. I asked and was told that the heater was not turned on.
The most amazing thing is: I found a condom box that had not been cleaned when I entered the room. I didn‚Äôt check out the next day. The service staff opened the door and came in. They took a look at the guest‚Äôs privacy. The final solution was to give a 25% discount on the room rate. I was so surprised. The Magic City Hotel is amazing. The room rate is 2,000 per night.

There are cold eyes everywhere from the front desk to the restaurant, the remote control of the TV in the room does not work, the sound is intermittent, the bed frame is creaking, and the garbage is placed in the aisle at the door and has not been disposed of until 11 o'clock in the morning! The most strenuous thing is to go to the ba*****t to get the car and go to the elevator three times! Is this kind of experience what a Hilton luxury hotel should have?

msg:This store is really never coming back again. Let‚Äôs talk about check-in first. When we arrived at the hotel after 4:00 p.m., we first made a mistake in the room type. After reading the Ctrip order, we admitted that we had made a mistake. Then we said that we would have to wait at least an hour and a half for a room, so we had to go to eat first. When I entered the room at night, I found that there were not many tissues. I called to ask for the tissues to be delivered, but they didn't arrive after more than half an hour. Looking at the room again, everything is old.
        The scariest thing was the breakfast the next day. The little girl with the seats led us to a dining table. When we went back with the good things, the seats were already occupied. We didn‚Äôt want to solve it, but asked why you didn‚Äôt put some first. Food on top? Then we started contradictory operations again. We said that since this is the case, we should find an empty seat to sit on our own, but we disagreed, saying that although there was no food there, the sign was overturned, indicating that there were people and we could not sit. I asked the waitress girl, why was our seat flipped and someone was sitting? She actually said, your friend voluntarily gave up. Could it be that you have a brain problem? The family of three is already seated, we asked you to solve it, and you said to find another seat for us, so we let it go. Now we can't find a seat and we voluntarily give it up? I really don't understand what you want to be the leader for?
        Finally found a seat, the waiters who cleaned up around complained about the crowds and being too busy, and the manager of the ** restaurant even said woc. Are there any guests around? This is the service quality of Conrad?
        The scariest thing happened, there were unidentified hairs inside the fried dumplings, it was really disgusting! I found the manager of the restaurant and said that the breakfast fee cannot be refunded because it was paid together with the room fee. I asked him how to deal with it and said that he would find the chef. Anyway, just a word, this is not the hotel's problem, the fried dumplings were ordered outside, and the hotel is only responsible for frying them. Seriously doubt that the entire restaurant is outsourced? From waiters to restaurant managers are not trained.
       Because it's my friend's birthday, I don't want to talk about it, so let me prepare a new breakfast and deliver it to the room. It was delivered around 10:50. All dry stuff. Ask the food delivery person, what about the juice you drink? Tell me back that I don't know, the restaurant asked me to send these, otherwise you call the restaurant to ask.
        Will never go there again! Management is extremely chaotic!

The rest...it's really hard to describe...I won't mention the check-in time of three o'clock. I can't even stay at three crucial o'clock. After you went in and waited for a long time, the room you were given was perfunctory. It was not the room type you saw on Ctrip. When you called to ask for a room change, you were told to go to the front desk and ask? I'm really speechless... I called the room to ask for a toothbrush and slippers and waited for almost two hours but couldn't get them... In short, bad review! Will never go to this hotel again!

It's cheap, and the toiletries are from big brands, but they come in big bottles, which lacks a sense of luxury. . It may be the lowest-grade Conrad hotel in the country and even in the world.

The location is next to People's Square, just after you see "Shimao Plaza", behind Nanjing Road, it is very convenient to go to the subway station, with lines 1, 2, and 8. Just go downstairs
I would like to commend Ryan at the front desk for helping me check in quickly and efficiently. He knows the hotel's information very well and likes people who are capable and not sloppy.
He also introduced me to nearby amu*****t attractions, including my route to Disneyland the next day, and also introduced nearby check-in places in Shanghai. I was also told about a place that doesn‚Äôt have many people but definitely produces movies. I also went to the place he recommended, and it was indeed very interesting. Thank you very much to him. This trip to Shanghai was well worth it. I have all the photos I need
The hotel room facilities are also very new, and the bedding is also very delicate. After taking a shower, you can lie down and fall asleep instantly. Anyway, it's great.
Thank you very much Ryan, it was a great stay. Conrad is a very worthwhile hotel with good location, good service and good hardware.
There were quite a lot of people during the National Day holiday recently. You can actually see the bustling crowd downstairs at Conrad. This is another unusual experience.

Service is very very very poor

1. The room service is in vain. I called four or five times an hour to ask for a bath towel but it never came to me. The customer service tried to evade it several times by saying that they called to remind me but no one actually called (lying).

There was a long queue for check-in at 2.2 o'clock, and we had to wait for half an hour to check in. I had to wait for a table when I came back at 10pm to extend my stay.

3. The hotel's pillow supply is insufficient. If there is a shortage, don't put a supply card in the hotel. There won't be any pillows you want.

This decoration style is more in line with my aesthetics. The location is very good for tourists. The first floor is Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street. The lounge and restaurant are not amazing but passable. The view from the lounge is particularly good. This time I didn‚Äôt make a reservation in advance and I didn‚Äôt eat the butter-aged tomahawk in the western restaurant. I will definitely try it next time I come to live. I heard that it is the 1.3kg tomahawk of m5.
Also talk about the shortcomings. 1. The service is definitely not good compared to hotels of the same level. Considering that there are too many people and the size of the hotel is too large, I think it can be understood as appropriate. Xiaohongshu said that the attitude is bad, but I haven't encountered it three times. Although there is no intimacy, the attitude is still passable. 2. The probability of damage to the facilities is higher. Except for the first time, nothing happened, the second time there was a small problem with the shower in the suite, and the third time the high-rise twin-bed toilet flush room was loose. After all, it is a luxury brand, so we still need to pay more attention Check out the details. Third, pay attention to the phone number of the front desk switchboard, it is too easy for no one to answer it
To sum up, I think that despite its shortcomings, his home is still worth staying in, and I will definitely stay there for the fourth or fifth time in a while. Although there are many bad reviews, the business is really good ü§£ I hope the price will not increase too much in the future. In terms of selfishness, I hope that the business will be a bit worse, so that I can experience a better living experience and the price can return to 22 years. ü§£

msg:Don't stay here, the service efficiency is super low, and the attitude is really super super super bad! !

When we checked in on the first day, we queued for a long time. When we finally arrived, the front desk told us that the computer was broken, so we had to check out and asked us to go to another line to queue againÔøº. At that time, the people in front of the line were checking out, but the front desk did not coordinate. Later, when I checked in, I called the hotel about two days in advance and said that the two rooms I booked should be on at least one floor or close together as much as possible, but the front desk told me that they could not guarantee the two rooms. , and told me to let us come back in the afternoon and wait to see if we can arrange it.

When we came back around 5:00 p.m. and checked in again, the hotel front desk told us that only one room was ready, and the other one she said "the guest just checked out half an hour ago", we asked her if it was because it was not cleaned up Nice room, but she didn't answer us directly, she kept emphasizing that "the guest only checked out half an hour ago". Later, we asked her how to check in quickly, because it was already five o'clock in the afternoon, and the front desk told us that we could urge the cleaning lady to let her clean up quickly. We asked if we could ask for help, and she said that I need to inquire about it myself and told us, "I don't recommend you to rush this way." I really don't understand how this hotel does staff training. They don't know how to solve problems when they encounter problems, and we, the guests, have to solve them ourselves. Obviously the hotel didn't arrange it well, and it ended up like we had a lot of things to do, and the experience was extremely bad!
Ôøº
We did inquire about it ourselves and finally checked in. At that time, our two rooms were each given a strawberry cake. Ctrip did show that we had to book three days in advance, but we forgot to make a reservation. We asked the hotel front desk if we could exchange a small cake of the same price or a lower price. ÔøºAs a result, the front desk of the hotel also asked us to go down to the restaurant on the first floor to ask ourselves. After we went down to the first floor to ask about it, their work efficiency was extremely low, and they made us wait for about 20 minutes. We couldn't wait any longer. After asking for a long time, we were finally told that we could not change it. I really think that this hotel's gift cake is just a routine, but he didn't intend to give you a cake at all, because if he really wanted to give it to customers as a gift, why did he need to book it three days in advance? Ôøº

I think these are already too much, and the hotel's facilities are still very bad. On the first day, there was no problem with the lights in the hotel. When we were going to sleep at about 2:00 the next day, the bedside lights and the toilet lights couldn‚Äôt be turned off. We tried all the switches, but it didn‚Äôt work. . At this time, the hotel called a repairman, and he probably repaired it for more than 20 minutes, but he didn't fix it, and the light finally unplugged the circuit.

For these problems, the hotel did not provide any solutions or compensate us. I really think this hotel is very bad in terms of service attitude and facilities. Don't stay here!

1. After checking in, I found that there were no toiletries in the room
2. Close to the revolving glass door of the takeaway self-pickup cabinet, there is no warm reminder on the door. My friend almost ran into it, and I hit it directly, and I was still walking normally without being distracted by my phone. If a child hits it, the consequences will be disastrous.
3. After my forehead hit the glass door, a small bag immediately bulged up, and I told the lobby staff on the first floor to send ice packs to the room, but he actually told me to go back to the room and call customer service?
4. After returning to the room, I found that the two phones in the room were just decorations and were useless.
5. I went online to find the front desk phone number again. Except for the first call, it took a long time to get through, and then I called again, but no one answered. Is this the service of a luxury hotel?
6. At 9:54 in the evening, I told the front desk that my forehead was so swollen that I needed to send ice packs immediately. It was not until 10:25 that a bucket of ice and two garbage bags were delivered. Is ice made on site half an hour apart? Why doesn't such a big hotel even have such basic medical supplies as ice packs? ?

I called the front hall and said that I would go down to scan the power bank. As a result, I put on my clothes and went down to scan the power bank after six o'clock.

Therefore, there are almost 5 or 6 groups of residents in each queue at the front desk on the L floor. During the waiting period, I felt a little impatient. However, Lisa, the lady at the front desk, said "I've been waiting for a long time" and then patiently explained that the rooms were full today and the system was a bit stuck. This anxiety was immediately relieved. She also patiently listened to my preferences and helped me choose a luxury suite closer to the river. It makes people feel that the hotel management has indeed carefully trained and implemented it, and serves every guest attentively and seriously under any circumstances.
There is no need to go into details about the rooms. The bedroom, study and living room all have three-piece views of the Pearl, and the island in the pantry offers a panoramic view of Renguang. It can be said that you can have a panoramic view of Shanghai's famous attractions and landmarks.

msg:The hotel is located in a tourist area and the location is very convenient. I stayed for three nights in total. There was no problem on the first night. On the second night, the lights in the room suddenly turned off, and then kept flashing intermittently. So I called the front desk to report the situation, and the front desk said they would I sent a technician to deal with it, but after waiting for ten minutes, no one arrived. I contacted the front desk again before a technician arrived. After the inspection, I needed to change rooms. The front desk clerk gave me the new room card and asked me to wait. After waiting for 20 minutes, I contacted the front desk again. She apologized and said that she would give it to me immediately. I would contact the front desk for the first time. The entire process of getting your new home card takes about fifty minutes. When I arrived in the new room, I was almost ready to go to sleep. On the morning of the third day, I realized that the TV only had sound and no picture, so I contacted the front desk again, and the front desk sent a technician to assist me. This time, he turned the box behind the TV on for me and the problem was solved. I went out and returned to the hotel at about 4 o'clock, but the room card could not be used to enter the room, so I had to go to the front desk to deal with it. When I returned to the room, I found that the bathroom scale was broken and the handle of the chair was also damaged. I can understand what happened in the first room, but I really can't understand the situation after changing rooms. There are too many problems. And the staff, from the lobby manager down to the front desk, may be too busy and seem to lack empathy. Fortunately, this is the last day of the last stop of my trip. If it were the first day of the first stop, the problem would be huge, and the entire travel mood would be ruined, so choosing a hotel is really important.

msg:I had read many reviews before and complained that this hotel had many problems. I was a little worried when I made the reservation, but after the actual experience, I felt that it was very cost-effective! 1. With a price of more than 1,000 points, which five-star hotel of the same type in Shanghai can compare? And my conscience is that other hotels have increased their prices a lot on weekends, but his hotel has not increased their prices! 2. The location is super good. It is convenient to go everywhere. You can also overlook the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, see the Oriental Pearl Tower and the three-piece suit from a distance, and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Suzhou River. 3. There are plenty of choices for eating, drinking and entertainment in the surrounding area. Citywalk on Nanjing West Road in People‚Äôs Square is not too good! In addition, there is a double-decker sightseeing bus stop next to it, so you can leave at any time. 4. The room should be renovated on the basis of the previous one. The original structural influence can be seen, which makes the room space slightly smaller, and the washbasin and bathroom are cramped. However, the layout is reasonable and the dry and wet separation is achieved. 5. Personally, I like to eat out, but don‚Äôt like hotel catering very much. I usually choose basic rooms in five-star hotels that do not include breakfast. I cannot comment on the complimentary services or breakfast provided by some high-end room types. 6. There will be a queue when checking in, but you don‚Äôt have to wait long. The front desk lobby is a bit plain compared to other hotels of the same level, but the lady at the front desk looks pretty in professional attire. 7. Compared with Conrad Hangzhou, except that the room is slightly smaller and the lobby is slightly worse, there are not many shortcomings, but the price is much better and the location is much better. Such high cost performance, highly recommended! The first choice for future business trips to Shanghai!

msg:Let's evaluate after living
To be honest, I was really nervous before, because I read a lot of reviews that said it was not very good, and xhs also had a lot of complaints, so I tried it with the mentality of opening a blind box.
Check-in at five or six in the afternoon, there is no queue as mentioned in the bad reviews, and no one can do it directly. I told the front desk that I wanted a higher floor, so I directly arranged for the 37th floor, and I drove to a blind box room with a great view. I was very happy! !
The service aspect is actually not bad, because we stayed outside most of the time for two days, and we don‚Äôt have much experience in the service area, but the staff in the lobby will be very enthusiastic to provide help, and the concierge downstairs It is also very convenient to store luggage.
The cleanliness did not encounter the situation that the room was not cleaned up as mentioned in the bad reviews (maybe it was luck). The elevator did need to be reversed twice but it was acceptable, and the speed was quite fast, and the wait was not long.
There is nothing to say about the location. It is upstairs in the World Trade Center, which is very convenient. The scenery outside the floor-to-ceiling windows is very beautiful. It is very happy to eat and chat with friends by the window! ! The price/performance ratio is really high
If I have to say that it is not enough, it would be better if the takeaway can be delivered to the room or floor, but it is understandable that there are too many rooms and it is troublesome to deliver one by one, but it is a little troublesome to get it from the takeaway cabinet outside the G floor.
Generally speaking, the experience is really good (good luck is not excluded). I sent puq to several friends to ask which hotel it is, and I still recommend it! !

msg:The location of the hotel is very convenient, just on the side of Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, it is very convenient to order takeaway when traveling. Behind the hotel is the M&M flagship store. The high-level night view is also good. But as a brand of Conrad, it can indeed be more high-end and more detailed.
There is also hotel parking in the World Trade Center, you need to wait for a seat to enter, and it may be more difficult to park on holidays. Fortunately, the hotel service is not bad, and the overall feeling of staying is still good.

Service: The most impressive thing is the front desk saki who helped me check in. She is very professional and understands what my needs are.

And it's really nice that she has a smile that I can see through the mask and into her eyes! like very much! It feels like she is at work 24 hours a day. She checks in and checks out.

msg:Such a disappointing stay, not worthy of Conrad's name!
First of all, the reserved high-rise came to the store and told me that the high-rise was gone, and I was moved to the 28th floor. Since it was too late, I just wanted to rest early, thinking that the hotel would arrange compensation or propose to change the room the next day, but there was no. And there was a problem with the shower head and the toilet in that room!
Again, it was disgusting to find that there were stinky socks left by the previous guests on the curtain side.
Finally, when the front desk went to check in, change rooms, etc., the waiting line was very long, and the delay was too long on the big weekend!
We checked in on the first night and found a problem. We wanted to call to change rooms and complain. We found that no one answered the phone. We continued to call the next morning and found out that there was no one on duty at night, only in the morning. I communicated on the phone to change rooms and agreed to come down. When I got downstairs, the front desk didn't connect, and I said the reason again. When we got out of the hotel, we called again to ask why we changed rooms. . Really hot. I will definitely not live again next time.

You can hear the conversation in the corridor clearly. The sound of the sewer pipe is so loud that it collapses. Too small quilts are dragged on the ground, stumbled when walking, a toothbrush was notified to the guest room to be delivered to the room from check-in, and the middle phone called four times, but it was not delivered after waiting for two hours, and then I called the room phone and no one answered , Called with my mobile phone and no one answered. The check-in and check-out at the front desk was queued for half a day. At the end of the check-out, I couldn‚Äôt wait until I put down the card. If I am busy, I will return it. What a wonderful operation, the front desk staff went to eat during the peak check-out period, and it was the first time I heard of it. This kind of hotel is not worth five hundred in Shanghai.

msg:I specially stayed for one night. I booked a premium room and asked for a corner room. The room is relatively spacious and has windows on both sides. One side can see the Pudong four-piece suite. The view is good. Comment on the overall pros and cons:
Advantages: Good value for money, this brand, this location, this landscape, this price is really not expensive, and the price has not increased much after the epidemic.
shortcoming:
1. From Royal Le Meridien to Conrad, but apart from the logo, from the service to the interior decoration, the characteristics of Conrad cannot be seen, and it is more like an ordinary Hilton hotel. Although the hotel has been renovated for some years, the aroma of wine is not afraid of deep alleys. Looking at Hong Kong's Conrad (Hong Kong's Conrad) for a long time, it has to be reflected in the service details, warm and elegant interior decoration and comfortable bedding.
2. When it comes to service, it barely passes the mark. The lobby on the first floor basically does not take the initiative to greet and care about customer needs. The front desk service is more routine, like an assembly line, and lacks a sense of intimacy, but this seems to be a common problem in most hotels in China.
3. There are no ducklings and bears in this room type. I always think this is the biggest feature of Conrad. Conrad has collected them all the way from Hong Kong to Guangzhou to Xiamen. Only Shanghai did not get them, and I forgot to ask for them myself. Yes, sorry.
4. In terms of sanitation, the locker already smells like dirty clothes; when the water washes down the gutter in the shower, a lot of black dirt flows out.
5. In terms of food and drink, I went to the restaurant with a view on the top floor. I spent more than 1,000 yuan alone, and my flesh hurts... The view is very good, but the price is indeed relatively expensive. There are not many choices of Western food, and the menu is only a few cold dishes and appetizers. , a few staple foods are gone, and the service is not humane enough. I asked for a fruit plate to eat alone, and I was served a large plate for a group of people without prior notice.
In short, it has been a while since I changed the cards, but the rating has not been going up, there must be a reason, I hope it can be improved!

msg:It can only be said that Hilton has forced the Conrad brand to death in Shanghai. A hotel in Shanghai that costs 1,000 a night really cannot compete with Amman, Yue X Village, Waldorf Astoria, and Bulgari that cost more than 2,000 or even higher. It's not realistic either. I won't complain about my feelings, just to be specific: 1 check in time is too slow. After calculating the time, the entire check-in process took more than half an hour. It is estimated that this is the norm in hotels. 2. The power banks in the lobby are all borrowed. 3. There is also a queue for breakfast at the hotel. The above three points are all due to the disappoin**ent of the experience of the bottleneck of the reception capacity brought about by the peak of full rooms. In my opinion, as a mature operation and management, Conrad should not be unable to cope. In addition, my watch was pulled down at the hotel, and I had to contact the hotel after three hours to find out that the watch was pulled down. This level of world-class brand hotel should not be such a passive behavior. The overall check-in experience is also very average, and the room size is not large. To be honest, considering the price and the location, you can't say it's bad. But I can only say one thing: It turns out that Conrad can also make the brand like this, which is really an eye-opener. In other cities, don't use it to compete with Park Hyatt, Ritz, St. Regis, and Intercontinental.

msg:I have never stayed in such a bad hotel. As a university hotel management professional, I never imagined that a star hotel can be so bad. From the moment I entered the door, when I arrived at the hotel after two o'clock, the staff in the lobby told me that there were no rooms. , We booked the room three days in advance. There was no room without any notifications and reminders, so we were left to wait. The attitude of the reception staff was also very bad. I normally asked when the room was available, and asked for a time. I didn‚Äôt know when I asked. I don‚Äôt know where, but I keep asking me Mr. What‚Äôs the use of asking me here? This sentence made me laugh. You are a hotel receptionist. If I don‚Äôt ask you, I will ask who.
Then I queued up to check in. When I arrived at 2:00, I was told that there were vacancies at 3:00. After I went out to eat, I came back at 3:00 and told me that the room was not cleaned and we had to wait. Let us go to the executive lounge for afternoon tea and so on. What's in the executive lounge? Lemonade, coffee machine, a few small biscuits that no one eats, the room has not been cleaned at almost four o'clock, so we can only go to a friend's hotel to stay temporarily, and come back to open the room at night, I really can't afford to delay this time, a star hotel Even the room control is not good, this is the first big problem
I came back at night and opened the room and went back to the room. There were no toiletries, including toothbrushes, combs, shower caps and other disposable items. The bath towels were missing one piece. I called the front desk to ask for it. I called the front desk seven or eight times and no one answered, so I had to do it myself I ran down, and then the person at the front desk confidently said that I was too busy to answer the phone. I arrived at the hotel at 11:30 am. I was curious what you were doing at night? The room phone couldn‚Äôt be answered, and the attitude was even worse. I threw two toothbrushes at the bar and ignored me. After I went back, I began to observe the room I had been waiting for for a day. To be honest, the hotel has been broken down like this for 22 years. What is the standard? Does this kind of standard need to be received from two points to four or five points? How do you train your guest room staff? Where did the front desk service staff graduate from? Next look at the picture, everyone? Keep your eyes open, there are dirty and unknown objects on the carpet, several black marks on the pillow, white ash on the table where the towels are placed, fine hairs on the connection of the kettle, the TV is crooked, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs blood or something on the wall , the bathrobe is rotten like a rag, one of the phones is broken, and there is no electricity. This is the Conrad Star Hotel. The price is nearly 1,000 yuan a night, and it provides service like a youth hostel at 80 yuan a night next to the train station. This is the worst hotel I have ever seen. It is not one of them. It is recommended that the big boss change the team and find some professional and responsible people. Don't do one-time transactions.

Anyway, I was bitten as soon as I lay down, and then I called the front desk, but no one answered after 4 times, and said to ask the waiter to take a look, I said there are mites, what can the waiter see? Look at my bitten bag? The front desk insisted that the waiter come to see it, and after ten seconds, he said that I can't control it, and asked the manager to connect. It was almost 40 minutes from the time I called to the result. Then I talked about the facilities in the room. There was no toothbrush in the room before the room change, and it took 20 minutes to send it over. After changing the room, there was a bottle of unsealed but undrinked water in the room, which was placed on the bar. What do you mean? The housekeeper didn't check at all. If someone added something to it, and the guest didn't pay attention when drinking, who would blame it if there was a problem? I stayed in the hotel for less than 10 hours. Every time I passed by the lobby, there were various complaints from guests. One or two may be problems with the guests. If there are so many, it can only be a problem with the hotel.

shortcoming:
1. The room service is extremely poor, and it took 20 minutes to get the toothbrush. The most outrageous thing is that the hair dryer is broken. After I urged and urged, I waited for more than half an hour before someone came! ! Dry hair too.
2. The hotel shares the parking lot with the shopping mall, and there is no dedicated parking space. There are very few parking spaces during peak hours, and the parking lot environment is not good. From the parking lot, you need to go to the mall first, and then walk a while to the elevator to the hotel. If you forget to take the initiative to take the parking ticket (note that it is the initiative), then congratulations, you will get the white eyes and ridicule of the guard.

We can only give us one room at 3 o'clock, and the luggage will be delivered later. We were sent to the first room. It was already 4 pm when we returned to the hotel after dinner. The room was still not cleaned. Because the child was sleepy and wanted to sleep in the room, I called twice from 4:00 to 5:30. The phone at the front desk kept saying that it was being cleaned. Before I called the second time, I went to the floor to check with the cleaning staff, and said that I could move in after the cleaning. I had already told her about the situation when I called the third time and said that I needed to call to ask. , let me wait for a few minutes, see that my voice is a little louder, just hang up my phone. I have never met so many hotels. After a few minutes, I will call back and say that I can check in, but I still need to wait for a few minutes, because The room card needs to be made on the spot. I asked why she hung up on me. She said she hung up after she finished speaking. She was really speechless. The promised luggage was delivered to the room, but it was only delivered after two reminders. After check-in, the hygiene of the room is so-so, the bathroom facilities are relatively old, and the smell is strong. Communicated with her at 17:35 on August 5, 2023, claiming to be Ms. Xu.

For hot rice noodles, only one bite is given each time. Children are not enough, let alone adults, and they have to go to get the noodles again and again. They give a little each time with an indifferent attitude; Make a little bit, every time I go to pick it up, I say no, pasta is the same, people just don‚Äôt make it well, they have to order a la carte, there are not many hot dishes, drinks need to be charged separately, coffee needs to be lined up and only one person makes coffee, too busy Come on, the coffee is half a cup, the buffet is super poor, there is nothing to eat, but the fees are charged normally, and the food is reluctant to put. Before the meal is collected, the general hotel will remind the guests that the end of the meal is over, and the food needs to be picked up as soon as possible, but this hotel collects it as soon as the meal is collected. The cars, sweepers and moppers, regardless of whether there are customers or not, are all dispatched. In an instant, the restaurant becomes a garbage disposal plant, and the noise is very loud. Is this still a five-star chain hotel? It must be rated badly. Never live again.

Let‚Äôs talk about the advantages first: the location is indeed very good, in the most prosperous and lively area, on the roadside in Nanjing, with several shopping malls nearby, and it only takes ten minutes to walk to the Bund. But this is the only advantage
Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings
1. I was given a corner room without asking. The room was overcrowded. Later, a staff member explained to me that business people with the same area would prefer it. However, you saw me checking in with my children. Does business have anything to do with me?
2. The overall decoration of the room does not deserve five stars at all, four stars at most.
3. The temperature in the room was abnormal. Even with the air conditioner on, it was still 27 degrees high. A fan was provided at my request.
4. The water in the shower room was blocked at night and the water overflowed. The engineering and cleaning staff were busy for a long time. The structure of the shower room is also speechless, the bathtub and shower are together.
5. The attitude of the service staff (guest service operator) cannot be said to be bad, but they are full of the fast pace of a big city. Can their tone of voice be softened a little?
Knowing that I was not satisfied with the room, a person in charge contacted me and asked me to accept his apology for sending breakfast. I said I didn‚Äôt need breakfast starting at noon, but he insisted on delivering it. I was rejected.
I state it truthfully and objectively, not to ask for your breakfast, but to let more customers see this and hope that the hotel will sincerely improve.
It‚Äôs really a very poor experience, I will never stay here again!

The front desk clearly arranged at least six check-in channels, but only two were opened. The check-in queue took 20 minutes. There are still a few people in the back and the guests are busy saying that check-in takes so long? It was obvious that everyone had a bad experience. 3. Don‚Äôt hotel staff smile? This is the first time I have seen people who are bitter and hateful. 4. The hotel infrastructure is still broken and the lights cannot be turned off. The room cleaners will not check it and come to repair the switch at 2 o'clock in the evening. Really bad experience üëé

3. I heard that the hotel was purchased and remodeled. The internal equipment is not up to the standard of Conrad. The hair dryer is not good enough, the closet is not closed tightly (the light is always on at night), and there are no toiletries (I don‚Äôt know if I forgot to put it.

4. The static electricity in the hotel is very serious, and the Bluetooth speaker is broken;

When I made a reservation, I saw a bunch of negative hygiene reviews on the Internet, and I was still quite uneasy, but after all, it is a high-end Hilton hotel. Maybe it was affected by the epidemic, but it was actually a slap in the face... First of all, the check-in was done very quickly. , The employees are skilled in business. I booked a premium room. When I checked in at 9:00 p.m., I was told that there were only rooms available on the lowest floor, and I couldn‚Äôt give rooms on higher floors... The cleanliness of the room was a bit poor. No problems were found when I checked in at night. During the day, I saw a previous guest staying under the desk The chocolate and outer packaging under it... It is estimated that there are too many disturbing negligence in the room. , I have to complain, one day after the automatic curtains were closed, the sun shone directly on the head of the bed, and I was woken up by the sun at 6 o'clock in the morning. After so long, have no customers complained? ! However, there is a tea set in the room, which is great. I like to make a pot of tea and watch the scenery by the window. In addition, waiting in line for breakfast, Ming stalls are comparable to Conrad's market...

The hotel has been properly refurbished on the basis of the original Royal Le M√©ridien. It meets the standard five-star standard but it is not amazing. The flaw is that the hotel occupies an excellent location for viewing the Bund, but you can enjoy the public areas and rooms on the Bund. The field of view is very narrow. In the public area, only the bar on the top floor and the windows next to the high-rise elevators can see the Bund.

In addition, the variety and products of the buffet in the restaurant are quite satisfactory, and the swimming pool and gym were not experienced because of the cold weather.

There is only one washbasin and the room is so small. To be honest, I might as well have stayed in a full season.
I called the front desk and asked him to send two bath towels now. He promised very well. I waited all night and they didn't come, so I didn't bother to make a second call... There was an alarm in the corridor all night, although it wasn't very loud, but it kept going. Hear it!
Really disappointed with this hotel Will never go back!

msg:It adheres to the Conrad brand, and Amy has lived in the original location before, so the impression is pretty good. The result was really disappointing! It was difficult to enter the ba*****t since the hotel and the mall share a parking garage, so I had to queue for half an hour to get in. Then when we checked in, the lobby was very messy. After we got in line and asked for a crib, we were told that there is a fee for the crib. I didn't say it was impossible, right? I have stayed in so many hotels, big and small, and I have never seen anyone asking for money for a crib. After some discussion, the waiters decided not to charge for it. What the hell is this? The surprise came after entering the room, there was no electricity at all! After ten minutes of calling the front desk, the maintenance man came. After tinkering with it for a while, he said he needed to change the fuse, so he left to get tools and repaired it about half an hour later. But the air conditioner in the entire room does not produce hot air. During this period, except for the maintenance man, no one came out to explain or apologize. Then because I had to go out at night, I went downstairs and told the lobby manager about this matter. I said that the air conditioner must be fixed for me when I come back in the evening, because I have a three-year-old child who is afraid of catching a cold and fever at special times. She said no problem. When I returned to the room at nine o'clock, the air conditioner was still the same one that produced cold air! I got really angry and went downstairs to lose my temper, so they changed the room! This Conrad will gradually drive you crazy. I hope everyone will not step on the wrong thing! ! Must force the pit! ! ! It's really scary! Hardware services are not available!

2. At the beginning, I booked online for one night. After checking in (paying a deposit of 1,000), I confirmed my itinerary. I needed to stay for another day, so I renewed the reservation online for another night (the front desk said that I can renew the reservation online by myself. It‚Äôs ok), but the front desk called at 9 o‚Äôclock in the morning on the day of check-out and said that the deposit was not enough (no in-room consumption), I said that I would check out after a while, the front desk was very tough and said that the deposit was not enough, I need to come down now Make up the deposit, and then we packed up and went to the front desk to check out. I said just now that you called and asked to pay the deposit immediately. I didn‚Äôt have any consumption, so why is the deposit not enough? The front desk staff checked the computer and asked me: Is the deposit refunded to you? I said no, and then the front desk said it was a mistake.

It is convenient to eat and drink, and it is very convenient to go to various popular places. It is suitable for business trips or short-distance travel. If you want to experience or roam the magic city in depth, it is recommended to avoid the core area of the city. The hygiene is average, and the hair in the bathtub is disgusting. The service level is still maintained. Take the children to the executive lounge to see the night view and drink some drinks for free. Although the money is not much, it does make the guests feel warm and a**ospheric. They arrive early and check in smoothly. It is indeed a customer-centric service. The swimming pool is not bad, suitable for children. The breakfast is a standard five-star standard, and the surprise is that there is handmade chaos. Please note that the T66 and MUSE bars on the top floor are not hotels. The dark environment, asking the bartender who doesn't know anything, and the flower-armed doorman are not suitable for tourists.

I originally wanted to go to the gym and swimming pool, but I spared a few elevators and went to the registration area to sign and told me to go there again. After crossing a corridor and walking upstairs, I gave up decisively. I had a lot of luggage when I left, so I asked for a luggage cart in advance around 11 o'clock. I didn't see it until 11:55, so I called and said it would be here soon. I really admired it. This is the most cost-effective place I have ever stayed with my children, and the service is basically all points deducted.

In the end, CHOLE upgraded me to a premium room, and there happened to be a clean room and I checked in. I liked it instantly.

I stayed in the Jinka Buddha Depar**ent, booked a basic room, and upgraded to a high-level basic room. RYAN at the front desk is more efficient.

The area of the basic room is about 30 square meters, and the non-bund view is also good. You can see Renguang and Tomorrow Square JW.

In fact, I personally feel that Shangkang is not bad, because the service from RYAN at the front desk is also very good, and the price is quite cost-effective in the city center.

2. The service attitude is good, but it is obvious that the manpower has been overloaded and cannot meet the traffic;
3. It is difficult to call the service center at night, and it takes more than 30 minutes to ask for something, and it is often lacking.

I negotiated with the front desk and provided the deduction voucher. I still had to go through the process of replying. Now two days have passed and the hotel has a bad attitude. Strong words, and boasting that he is not a small inn and needs to go through the process. Let us shut upü§êÔ∏è. This kind of five-star hotel has such quality employees and such corporate management is not worthy of five-star standards.

The manager also personally called to express condolences, and I feel full marks.

I hope I can give advice to Shimao Group. You can‚Äôt lie to people in business. It‚Äôs no problem if you convert Amy into Conrad, but many old facilities continue to be used, and they use the Conrad brand to deceive everyone, which is a bit boring. . You can't deceive consumers by relying on a good location. Your real estate owes money, or you can cash it out, or you can manage the hotel well, don't look around. You sell your son and worry about his son taking someone else's surname, is that interesting? Hope this can be seen by the management.

msg:Taking Beijing Conrad as the standard, this Le Meridien brand-changing Conrad is similar to DoubleTree by Hilton. . There is always only one person at the concierge, and the location on the first floor is small. There are also a lot of cars parked. The traffic jam must be 24 hours a day. The first time I stayed in a Conrad hotel, I had to take two or three boxes of luggage to the air lobby and then take it to the room. It is strongly recommended that the concierge, FOM, and GM all go to Conrad Beijing to learn how to improve the guest experience. There is only one word for the whole check-in experience: chaos.

The child kept sneezing, and the hotel couldn't bear to clean up the false eyelashes left by the previous guests. The child sat on the sofa I wanted to open the curtains while watching TV and found that the buttons were useless. I called the customer service center of the hotel and no one answered after ten calls. I had to call the concierge depar**ent of the hotel, and when I got through, I was told to arrange for an engineering depar**ent to take a look. Then I waited. I checked for half an hour and said that the curtain motor was broken. He said on the intercom that he could arrange to change the room, so he asked me to call the front desk as well. This time he finally got through and said that he would arrange for a colleague to deliver the room card immediately, so he waited for another hour. No one came yet, so I called the hotel customer service center and they said they would deliver it right away. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and called Hilton‚Äôs official complaint number. They said they would contact me right away. When the customer service was talking to me, the hotel seemed to be the guest room manager. Just come, really, can't describe will never stay in this hotel again

msg:Not a single point was allocated, and the check-in experience was really bad. From environmental sanitation to reception services, they are not worthy of the price of a five-star hotel.
Facilities: Very average, the bedding feels very old, and many five-star standard facilities are not available
Hygiene: Extremely poor. Can hair and dirt that are so obvious in the bathroom and toilet be invisible even when you clean it?
Environment: The room is small and the decoration layout is ordinary
Service: What I want to complain about the most is the service. After I reported the hygiene problem, three people I contacted within an hour did not even say a word of apology, as if they were used to this kind of thing. Some even slammed the door and left. Now I am doing service. Are everyone in the industry so arrogant? ? ? ? This attitude is really infuriating
Later, I called Ctrip to report it, and someone finally came to deal with it. I was upgraded to a room, and breakfast was also given. But it was already one o'clock in the morning, who could get up early? I don't need these, I just want to stay clean and comfortable for one night, but this hotel can't do that. Please take care of the most basic things in a hotel, such as hygiene and service. Anyway, I will block this hotel.

I felt good, both in terms of service and environment. Not bad, but the first time I felt average, the second time I checked in was even worse. I wanted to take a rest before going shopping after checking in at four o'clock, but the main light in the room couldn't be turned off, so I contacted the front desk. The front desk said that the staff would come over immediately, but I didn't go until after five o'clock, so I went shopping first, and when I came back at ten o'clock in the evening, it still hadn't been repaired. It was very insecure facing a male maintenance person in the room, and the front desk didn't say sorry or embarrassed. The third time I stayed, that is, this time, I chose to trust this big brand hotel again. As a result, the water in the shower head in this room was very insufficient this time. This is the only water that is so insufficient in many brand hotels in many cities I have stayed in. And Hair dryer in the morning didn‚Äôt work. I called the front desk and sent another one, but it still didn‚Äôt work. I changed the socket. It turned out that the socket was faulty and had no power. Such a high-end hotel has various problems continuously. I‚Äôm really sorry for one night and two The room fee of thousands of dollars, I have personally experienced these several times to make a sincere evaluation, not intentionally trying to blackmail this hotel, when these problems occur, the front desk staff has no apologetic attitude, and will never do so in the future Staying at this hotel again, none of the facilities and services are satisfactory.

Walking to the Bund in the evening, blowing the riverside breeze, pointing out the mountains and rivers to the Wanguo building complex, very cool! The surrounding environment not only has a strong metropolitan a**osphere, but also has the style of old Shanghai. I feel that this is the real Shanghai. The interior is very clean and elegant, the noise of the outside world is completely isolated from the heavy hotel door, and the interior is quiet. Staff on every floor are gentle, attentive and well-balanced. The price is also right. If you come to Shanghai again, you will stay at the Conrad Hotel, so you don't have to worry about doing your homework. This location can be taken into account, whether it is business or leisure. More worthy of praise is the considerate service of the lobby manager Faye and others~

msg:This is the worst Conrad I have ever stayed in, the worst Hilton hotel, even worse than Hampton Inn. The first night I stayed in a high-rise king bed room, it was too hot to stay in the western sun. I turned on the air conditioner and went out to eat and it was still very hot when I came back. I called the maintenance person and said that they could lower the water tank temperature and it should be better. After trying it for more than an hour, it still didn't work. The maintenance man came and tested the room, which was only one degree lower. But when night fell, I thought it would be cooler and it was late, so I went to bed first. I woke up with constant heat all night, which really made me collapse. I didn‚Äôt expect that Cantonese people would die from the heat in Shanghai in November. The next day we continued to report to the front desk, but at night the air conditioner was still not working. We asked to change rooms and got a high-rise executive room, but the executive room was much uglier than the ordinary room. . There is also a strong decoration flavor. It's just a little bit bigger. The waiter said that there must be something wrong with the air conditioners in ordinary rooms. We could only stay like this for two more nights. The maintenance staff had a good attitude, but they couldn't solve the problem.
The first ordinary room did not have any place to dry clothes. The clothesline was only available in the executive room. We could only move everything in the closet to another cabinet and hang the clothes in it. Unexpectedly, the aunt who cleaned the next day, Actually closed our closet door! The clothes smelled bad after being covered for a whole day, but they were not dry at all. despair.
The gold card provided breakfast for three days. When we got up on the first day, we thought we had not slept well, so we should go down and have breakfast early. There were very few people in the restaurant, but no one took away the plates. The man who was frying eggs seemed like we owed him money. He asked if the egg rolls placed there were reserved by others and could be taken. The attitude was very bad and he said that you can take them if they are left there! Because the pregnant woman asked if he was sure it was fully cooked, he said he told you to take it. ? ? ? A stocky male waiter. Speechless. Then the table next door was also fighting with the waiter because there were bugs in the porridge. Absolutely.
Except for the good geographical environment, there is nothing else good about it.

msg:As a Royal Le M√©ridien, it's not bad, as Conrad, it's too far; as a luxury five-star hotel located in People's Square with a room night of 900 yuan, the price is very high, but as Conrad, it's too bad.
Brands are difficult to do, and they will compromise when they catch the property, but it is a Conrad, so let‚Äôs renovate it, not only the hardware renovation, but also the improvement of software (management, operation level).
Because the father of a big owner compromised, but in the end, the brand Conrad will get worse and worse in China. It is a pity that it is a brand that was founded in the name of the father and has Hilton's blood.
As a member of Hilton's luxury brand matrix, the room hardware is far from up to standard. The design soul of the entire hotel is far from Conrad, and is similar to that of ordinary Hilton. Forget it, the sanitary corners in the room are basically not up to standard. Even the kettle, bedside table, etc. that can be seen on the surface cannot be seen;
The details of the service are too poor. The toilet paper in the room is gone. The coffee cup in the room is not equipped with a coffee spoon (Is it because I am afraid that the OE will be lost, it is not different from the food and beverage depar**ent, so I just don‚Äôt put it away?) Call someone to deliver it, small Brother actually instructed to "wash it before using it", so did you just pull it out from the linen room?
The hotel on the top of the tower, I thought the night view would earn some points, but unfortunately the glass in the room is so dirty that it is more enjoyable to draw the curtains

msg:The location is really good. The hotel is on the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, next to the People's Square subway station. There are four subway intersections, and the transportation is very convenient.

The overall hardware facilities are very average, but they are also the configuration of an ordinary five-star hotel. It should be that the previous Le M√©ridien has been slightly renovated after the brand change. The design of the sink and bathroom is very strange. I don‚Äôt know why the sink is designed to be so small. For children? The bathroom is obviously not big. I have to squeeze into a bathtub. After taking a shower, I turn around and sit in the bathtub. Moreover, the maintenance is very poor. For example, there are many black marks on the wardrobe in my room, and the joints of the bathroom floor tiles are also moldy. The most frustrating thing is that the bathroom is not very big. What people cannot accept is that there is a circle of üí©-colored stains around the toilet tank lid! After learning about Shangkang‚Äôs üí©water incident, it‚Äôs really hard not to think too much about it

The service at Shang Kang is really rubbish and not as good as some four-star hotels. In addition to the well-known fact that their lobby is as crowded as a train station, here are a few things I have personally experienced: 1) The hotel service center called three or four times No one answered the phone. I booked a room for three nights this time, but for some reason, the front desk only gave me the room permission for one night at first. As a result, I queued at the front desk for half an hour to apply for a new room card the next day. 4) The most irritating! I asked the hotel if I wanted some vinegar, but I waited for dozens of minutes without saying anything. As soon as the service staff opened the door, he directly held the vinegar in front of your eyes and said very rudely, "You want it." This is really awesome.

The front desk said There is no room vacant, and I was asked to come after 3 o'clock, and I accepted it, and then I came with my friends, and wanted to say that I lived on the same floor as my companions, and asked them to help me stay on the same floor, and they also said it was ok, but I came at night When I checked in, the front desk said that there is no more.

I asked if I need to book the buffet dinner in advance. The front desk just told me that you can just call and ask. I asked him what his phone number was and he told me that he didn‚Äôt know. Then during dinner, there was steamed fish. One of the guests wanted to pick up the fish himself. The chef immediately brought the tong over and said, "Can you pick up the fish?" The attitude was extremely bad, and he broke the fish into pieces. The guest said it didn't matter, just give it to me. The chef threw the remaining half of the fish tail into the trash can. The worst thing is the sanitary environment, which is very average and the child suffered from acute gastroenteritis. I really hope the hotel can provide more training to the staff.

msg:Let us wait and see whether the quality of the former Royal Emmy, now Conrad, and Hilton can be rebuilt.
This is a hotel with strict epidemic prevention. When checking in strictly at the front desk, after reading the 48-hour health code and confirming the green itinerary code, it is necessary to check whether the guest lives in a risk area. Of course, it does not mean that this is not necessary, and it should be .
In addition, a point to be reminded is that this is also a hotel that strictly enforces the check-in time of 15:00 pm, and the guests on the executive floor must also check in at 14:00 pm, so that when I arrived at the executive floor on the 44th floor at 13:55 , the door of the executive lounge is still tightly closed, which shows that the strict and standardized implementation of the hotel's rules and regulations has reached a high level.
Overall, this hotel is still suitable for business stay and does not have the conditions for an urban vacation, for the same reasons mentioned above. However, staying on the executive floor can get the Conrad bear as a souvenir, which is good.

msg:It‚Äôs unimaginable that a Hilton founder-branded hotel in Shanghai is like this. . . . Hardware: The elevator is shaky, there is a rumbling sound when opening the door, the blackout curtain cannot be closed, and the plug cannot be inserted; Service: The bathrobe is half-stuffed in the cabinet like garbage, the ironing board is hanging out, every kind word from the security guard, check-out The front desk didn't even look up and said, "Leave the room card there." What are these? Is there no one in charge of the housekeeping depar**ent? No money for maintenance? This is Conrad. . . Absolutely amazing

msg:The location of the hotel is good, but the room is really small, the bathroom facilities are also very old, and the layout is unreasonable. There is no aisle where the desks and chairs are placed to walk to the bed. When checking in, the hotel did not proactively ask if toiletries are needed. At night I took the initiative to call the front desk several times to wash my hands but no one answered the phone. When asked, I was told that there was only one person at the front desk. Is that the reason for not answering the phone? Is that the service attitude of a five-star hotel? Is it a matter of hotel staff arrangements? The supply of supplies is also very slow, and there are not many types of breakfast. Apart from the good location, there are no other advantages. I will not go there again.

The deluxe guest room has a plum blossom embroidery background, elegant and comfortable, the room is large, the TV is like a small set as a partition, the area is 50, we are 3707, the floor-to-ceiling windows are facing the new world, for your reference.

Service: I arrived early. First, I was afraid that parking would be difficult on Saturday. Second, my child had classes in the morning, so I borrowed a conference room with administrative courtesy. Faye, a kind and lovely lady, is very nice, she has troubled her with a lot of things, she is very patient and helpful, gentle and meticulous!

All in all, it was a very pleasant weekend parent-child leisure time, and I also participated in the hotel parent-child handicraft activities. The double-decker bus at night was also very exciting, and I will come again!

Shanghai finally has its first Conrad Hotel

In extraordinary times, choose Conrad for a leisurely walk.

Although it was transformed from the former Royal Le M√©ridien Shanghai, its architectural style is fashionable and avant-garde and its location is excellent. The luxurious room decoration perfectly interprets the brand characteristics of Conrad Hotel.

Change to three elevators from the underground parking garage, go directly to the executive lounge on the 44th floor to check in to the distinguished executive double room, and enjoy the romance of urban staycation.

The tall, spacious, bright and elegant executive lounge is the best place to enjoy the urban landscape of the Shanghai Metropolis. Standing in it, you can have a panoramic view of the spectacular scenery on both sides of the Huangpu River.

Enjoy free drinks, fruits, snacks and afternoon tea here during the day, and spend a leisurely afternoon; happy hour from 5:30 to 7:00 in the evening, simple Chinese and Western dishes and a lot of drinks, watch while eating , flashing neon lights, feasting, and a good mood. Recommend the current noodles in the lounge, with a variety of toppings, delicious.

The hotel's gym is equipped with high-end and complete equipment, and I like it very much; the swimming pool is open to the public, and the people are messy, full of sense of disobedience, so I don't recommend it.

Breakfast is enjoyed on the L floor, the environment is first-class, but the variety and quality are far from expectations.

Praise the Dali jewelry design creative children's fun weekend camp included in the hotel package, it is very interesting, parent-child activities, DIY jewelry making, free take away, full of sincerity.

I like the little bear and bathing duckling that represent the image of Conrad's logo, cute and playful cute pet dolls, take them with you as souvenirs.

There is no need to bring the hotel breakfast, it is really not delicious, very average.
The nose is very sensitive to the air in the room. Although there is no particularly strong odor, I keep sneezing.
There are many tourists received, and the whole environment is very noisy, like a vegetable market.
There are many elevators, but it is also difficult to wait.
In short, Shanghai Conrad will not live again in the future. Not recommended!

Then I drove the car to the garage and took an elevator, then I had to go out and walk for a while, then I changed to an elevator to check in, and then I went to the lobby on the first floor and told the room number to arrange luggage, and then It is up to the elevator and then change to the elevator to get to the room. It's really amazing. I also brought a three-year-old child with me. The fatigue index of this experience is five stars. Then in the room, the bathtub and the shower room are together, the toilet is shaking, and there is a loud noise of the toilet breaking when you sit down hard, it is really amazing. Even the towels and bath towels are a little thin. This is the first time I have stayed in a five-star hotel that I am not satisfied with in every aspect. It is really amazing.

I accidentally bumped into the front desk on the 11th floor without anyone giving me directions. The lady at the front desk insisted that I go down to the 9th floor and wait. I got really angry and they agreed to help me, and they waited for another 20 minutes. After I finished it, I was told that I had been queued up, so please come back after 3 o'clock.

There are noisy children everywhere and customers waiting with their suitcases. The elderly in the family received the same trea**ent when they checked in one day early. They spent nearly 10,000 yuan to book 8 rooms for the whole family to enjoy.

Service üîî: I wanted to give the service 0 points but didn‚Äôt. When entering the lobby on the first floor, the security guard only said please scan the health treasure. When I walked to the round table in the atrium of the lobby, three men in suits were standing there. It was really there. He stood expressionless and said nothing like hello, can I help you, or are you checking in? A woman with a ponytail and a suit looked at us up and down with her hands behind her back as we walked over, and then went back and forth several times. These people are like this every time I pass by. There is something wrong with the management of the reception depar**ent. When I go to the L floor to check in, there are a lot of people queuing up. There are people in suits standing in every corner, but there is no one there. The guide may ask you to fill in the health treasure nucleic acid and other information first, and then just leave it there. There are so many people and it will not be used. You can go to the two Conrads in Hangzhou to learn how they provide services. There is a queue. There was basically no movement in front of the bar for 20 minutes, so I called a waiter and asked if I could go to the executive lounge. I told her that I had a card, and the girl said that it was okay, I would take you there secretly, it was like, when we got to the executive lounge, the whole lounge was empty. There were four girls at the front desk standing in front of the computers, and one at the door, and there were others inside. Two men, there are so many people queuing downstairs, but the upper level is so empty, there is really something wrong with the management of this hotel.
Hygiene üßπ: The sheets were dirty and stained. There were a lot of women's long hair on the floor. I stepped on it with my bare feet and the soles of my feet were covered with hair. The corners of the shower room were all yellow. I called to report it. There is nothing more. Even if the guest house aunt or your duty manager calls to say sorry, this is not Conrad. You are sorry for this brand. You are working at Conrad and doing Home Inn work.
Breakfast‚òïÔ∏è: There are many people at breakfast but it is very orderly and tastes good. The service is also very good. The only place I feel this hotel has service is in the restaurant.
You are a five star hotel! Conrad, not DoubleTree

We had to wait until we asked ourselves whether to store our luggage or check in. This feeling is really uncomfortable; I also stayed at the Conrad Hotel in Macau and the service attitude was very good! As soon as you enter, someone will greet you and guide you. The difference is too big. Because it was not check-in time yet, we stored our luggage first. After a while, a waiter would come to guide us and we could go to the registration information and wait in line for check-in. I asked a few more questions about which floor and where the elevator was and got impatient. ‚Ä¶Is this the kind of service attitude your five-star hotel has? After checking in, I found that there were nails in several places in the room! You'll get stuck if you're not careful! One is in the rug under the TV and one is next to the bed. This is very dangerous, okay? Fortunately, I discovered it early to avoid accidentally pricking it with force and causing bleeding. I will never stay in this hotel again! I don‚Äôt know why the experience is so different for the same Conrad Hotel! I am very disappointed, it seriously affects my travel mood!

The only way to remedy the situation was to ask the waiter to come and clean it without any apology. They even blamed us for pressing the Do Not Disturb button! (I have never touched this key before.

1. On the night of check-in, I went back to the hotel after dinner and took the hotel stairs. The stairs fell twice and I was scared to death (I‚Äôm not kidding, you can adjust the monitoring).
2. The floor drain did not drain when I was taking a shower, causing the bathroom to flood (called a maintenance man to come and fix it)
3. The bathroom light could not be turned off at around two o'clock in the middle of the night. I called to inquire and was told to send a technician to repair it. Then I waited for 30 to 40 minutes and the repairman did not come. Finally, I felt sleepy and decided to unplug the power and sleep.
4. The breakfast was not delicious, the egg shells were eaten out of the meat floss egg rolls.
All in all, there were all kinds of minor problems when I checked into the hotel. The customer service phone number couldn't be reached or no one answered it, and the TV was stuck! Maybe it was because the elevator fell that we were frightened. We had a child with us at the time. When the child took the elevator the next day, he said that the elevator had fallen. Due to various problems, we decided to check out early and leave! After receiving the refund, I checked the bill and found that the refund was really short. What can I say? Is the hotel so unprofessional? I didn‚Äôt book an express hotel chain, right? It‚Äôs really not cost-effective!

msg:This is an unbeatable KLD‚Ä¶
Laughing to death. . It‚Äôs also a five-star hotel and it‚Äôs a high-end Hilton brand. .
Please look at the picture...
What the hell~
The elevator button is crooked. .
The corridor is very low, so forget it...
As soon as I opened the door, I was dumbfounded...
You can take a look. .
How much damage has this door gone through?
Hasn't any employee seen it? ? ?
How many other rooms have doors like this?
The room type I booked was not the worst. . .
It says online that it was a hotel opened in 2022. . It turned out to be the kind that bought old hotels and renovated them. .
This facility puts KLD in shame. . .
Bathroom and toilet are separated. . However, as soon as I take a shower in the bathroom, the water flows out to the floor and toilet...
There is still a floor drain. .
Let people see it. . It seems like there is a lot of hair stuck~
So what are the people cleaning the house doing? ? ?
If you can't get out of the water like this, you'll be in dire straits if the guests slip and get injured...
The mobile signal is only 1 bar, and the wifi is often disconnected...
What the hell. . . .
Some little girls also ignored her when talking to her. . . hehe. .

msg:To tell the truth, it smashed Hilton's signboard.
1. On the night of check-in, I took a shower halfway and found that the conditioner was empty. I contacted the front desk of the hotel after taking a half-shower. I was speechless.
2. There is no welcome fruit for 2 consecutive nights
3. What the duckling wants for himself is not placed on the side of the bathtub
4. I didn‚Äôt find any cotton swabs on the first night. After the room service the next day, I found that they hadn‚Äôt been put in the previous night. After the room service the next day, I found them.
5. There are 2 landlines in the room, there is no sound when you pick up the microphone, and there is no sound when you press the front desk service button. After calling the front desk with a mobile phone, the maintenance worker came to the door and told to pick up the phone and press line1 or line2 on the phone. There is no prompt card for calling the phone in the whole room. I asked the maintenance man, how would I know to press the line, and replied: I will teach you (sorry, it feels like I don‚Äôt know how to use a landline...)
6. The hair dryer in the room is very old! The gym hair dryer is Dyson. What a high-end operation for cutting leeks.
7. Disposable toothbrushes and other four small boxes were handed over to me at the front desk, and I carried them to the room by myself. (If I hadn‚Äôt lived in Atour, I wouldn‚Äôt have known that it could actually be put in their handbags for customers to carry around)

The only advantage should be the excellent location
After reading so many bad reviews, I don‚Äôt believe it, I have to go
The honorable big bed I also chose is about 3,000 yuan for two nights. The whole body feels like this:
Tell me if you're missing something, I'll make it up for you, but I'm not sorry, I'll make it up and leave
There's no home away from home, it's all borders

Every time you check in or have anything to do with the front desk, you have to queue up for ten minutes. The hotel's own rooms are oversold and there are no rooms. They upgrade guests and force you to change to a room type that cannot be sold. The service attitude is as if someone has died at home. It is not even as good as a fast hotel. If you want to cause trouble for yourself, just stay in more ** hotels and block them!

When I went to the front desk, I only said perfunctorily that I would check it out. In Shanghai in March, it was only around three to four degrees Celsius at night, and my friends and I both caught colds. Is this the attitude a hotel should have? Secondly, the hygiene is not up to par. When I was taking cold medicine, I found that the cup was the leftover coffee from the previous guest. How funny is that? If the hotel doesn't want to be too bad, it should focus more on service and hygiene. It's terrible haha

1. There is no doorman or concierge in the hotel. There is no one to open the door or tell you where the front desk is.
2. The arrival time was after one o'clock at noon. I was told that I could check in at two o'clock. At two o'clock, there was a long queue at the front desk to check in. It was very slow and there was basically no service. The management and service attitude of the entire front office are very poor.
3. I booked a non-smoking room and there were traces of cigarette burns on the table.

When I asked if I could upgrade the Bund view room, the lounge NNELLIE AIRES checked the room status and agreed, and took the initiative to ask if I needed toiletries, and the attitude was very good. To the Bund view room on the 38th floor. The room is not big, only 38 square meters. As soon as you enter the door, there is an open bathroom. The bedroom area is separated by a glass screen. Thanks to the relatively square room type, two relatively spacious spaces are left in the bathroom and bedroom area, but other areas are crowded, such as the bathtub. Showers crowded together, and narrow aisles on either side of the bed. The design of the room is still good-looking, the basic room is fresh and artistic, and the executive room is more dignified and heavy. The NNELLIE AIRES service in the lounge is very attentive and warm.

1. Inhumane, you must check in at 2pm!
      The result is: after two o'clock, all guests queue up at the front desk to check in. Such an arrangement during the epidemic will undoubtedly increase the risk of contact! (I wonder what Conrad thinks!)
2. The room is not clean!
      When we entered the room, there was actually a leftover pear core from the previous guest in the trash can. It was really off-putting!
3. The service is really bad!
      I called customer service and asked my aunt to help cover the sofa with sheets for the children to take a nap. After the aunt delivered the sheets and learned that they still needed to be laid, she looked unhappy and reluctant. She kept a dark face the whole time without saying a word, and left after hastily laying them out!
4. The front desk‚Äôs service to guests has no bottom line.
      The children had to take a lunch break before leaving. They went to the front desk and asked for a late check-out, but were told by the front desk that they couldn't. When I found a photo of the leftover pear pits from the previous guest, the front desk immediately changed their attitude and said that late check-out was no problem!
I really want to say something, just across the People's Park, can we learn how to treat guests with JW Marriott? ? ? ! ! !

msg:This is a former landmark of the Magic City. Let‚Äôs revisit the old place. In the previous Starwood era, the vibrant Le M√©ridien could barely compete with Hilton. As Hilton‚Äôs top brand, Conrad should be compared with St. Regis. And this The only Conrad in the Magic City gave me the feeling of a DoubleTree by Hilton, but without DoubleTree‚Äôs signature cookies. Let me just make a complaint. When I arrived at the store around 10:30, the girl at the front desk told me without hesitation that I could not check in now. His check-in time was three o'clock in the afternoon, and he could rush me to two o'clock in the afternoon. I also I have stayed in many hotels. In addition to resort hotels during holidays and business hotels during super large exhibitions, I can usually check in smoothly. There are many rooms here, and the room status the night before was not nervous. Not to mention that I am a calendar person. The standard order on the room, even if it is an oversold executive package in your home through various channels, it is clearly stated that check-in can only be done at 3 pm. When the front desk of Building L was empty, we were kicked to the executive lounge on the 44th floor. The front desk at the lounge immediately gave us a room without any upgrade. Doesn't this mean that the front desk downstairs obviously had a room? Do you deliberately make things difficult for guests under the premise? Are we going to have to wait three or four hours? Is this what you call stay inspired? Let‚Äôs make another complaint. As a room on the executive floor, there is no welcome fruit. The bath supplies are in the express hotel mode, with large bottles hung directly on the wall. This is the first of its kind in Conrad. I admire it. The bath towels in the locker room at the swimming pool were even worse. The only good thing is that the five o'clock happy hour can still maintain a high standard in the family-like environment of the executive lounge, and the service in the executive lounge is also acceptable. The breakfast on the 11th floor is barely up to Conrad's standards except for the juice selection. I hope the hotel can live up to its own brand.

1 There are no toiletries when you check in, and other hotels don‚Äôt provide them directly, but at least you will ask if you need them when you check in. Your family didn‚Äôt even ask us if we needed them. They didn‚Äôt replace it with new ones for 3 days. After we brushed our teeth, we put them by the sink, and after you cleaned them, the toothbrush head was directly attached to the wall. . .
2 The bathrobes were not hung up or replaced with new ones. They were rolled up and nestled on the sofa. When I came back at night, I opened them and they were still wet inside. .
3 It is too inconvenient to change elevators, and even have to change 2 elevators to go to the gym
4 The tiles of the elevator are broken, which poses a safety hazard
5 It is inconvenient to go up and down the stairs, and you have to go down to get the takeaway by yourself, and there is no robot to bring it up
6 The coffee cup was not cleaned after use, and there was still a circle of coffee stains on the bottom of the cup when it was used the next day
7 Ask to send a disposable toothbrush, wait for almost 20 minutes, the response is too slow

1. We are traveling as a family with suitcases, a stroller and a baby. There is no concierge outside the hotel lobby and no one can help us with our luggage. We have to drag our luggage up to L to check in.
2. The room can only be described as "tiny", and it is extremely dirty. There are yellow patches on the carpet. I don't know what the hell they are.
3. When eating breakfast in the breakfast room, there was no one to take a seat. There were 3-4 staff chatting together at the door.
4. My child had a fever at night and I asked if the hotel had a thermometer. This was also the most disappointing point. It was called an international 5-star hotel, but it didn‚Äôt have basic medical equipment at all. I was drunk.

Informed about the dining time and floor of the breakfast and lounge, as well as some practical information such as the location of nucleic acid in the vicinity, and the service was very thoughtful. This is the second time to stay here. The location of the hotel is excellent. There are several subway lines nearby. It is very convenient and the environment is good.

Location and transportation: The location is good, but taxi drivers often cannot find the entrance to the hotel gate. Love the smart toilet in the room. There are two styles of rooms looking at the Bund and People's Square, but they are both magnificent, and Conrad is worthy of the city skyline. Faye and Bella at the front desk are both very good, and the check-in and check-out services are very professional. The sanitation of the rooms on the upper floors is also very good. Comprehensive hotel traffic location, environment, sanitation, service in place, will come again next time.

The environment is beautiful and a**ospheric, especially Miss Sarlett at the front desk has a super good service attitude, very enthusiastic, and has a pair of beautiful big eyes that can talk! I am super kind, beautiful and polite, and the handling is good, very fast, very skilled, the boss must give her a salary increase! My good mood is all given to me by her, I really want to give a big praise! Never been so happy! This service attitude is really good. . The corridors are also very clean, and the logos are concise and clear. The first feeling when entering the room is that the room is large, clean, and warm. The room is fragrant, indicating that the ventilation effect is good. The bedding was changed at first glance, it was very clean and tidy, and the hygiene was really nothing to say. The glass in the bathroom is bright and there is no watermark at all. It seems that the waiter has cleaned it carefully. . The bed is also comfortable to lie on, and it is really a good choice to watch TV and rest. The water provided in the room was very considerate. A good place for business trips and tourist rest, I give this hotel a big compliment!

The front desk of the hotel is on the 11th floor (L floor). Faye is the one who received me. It feels very friendly and efficient. Because it was booked for my parents for two nights, there are some details that the elderly need to pay extra attention to. Faye gave me Lots of help, thanks a lot. On my mother's birthday, the hotel also sent snacks and fruit, which was very attentive.
A very cost-effective hotel, in a prime location in the city center, it is highly recommended for those who come to Shanghai to play or want to relax for two days locally.

Because of the good location and the quality of the hotel, there are still quite a few guests. There is a special take-out storage box at the door, which is also very considerate. This location is very fast for take-out, faster than your home.

The service of the front desk service team is excellent, especially Reketon is very enthusiastic and professional.

The hotel facilities are about average. If you are a luxurious and picky person, it is not for you, but for basic travel, the hotel is very good in the mid-range. Although the room is not too new, it has enough charm. The room is also very clean, with capsule coffee, tea bags, and byredo supplies. The room cleaning is also done quite well!

The parking lot and the main entrance are a bit tricky to check in and then go to the room.

The hotel is almost in the center of the city center, so shopping and dining around are very convenient. Scarlett Wu from last week still received it during CO, warm and efficient.

When I made the reservation, I saw that it would be opened in 2022. Later I discovered that the hotel was not a new hotel before Le Meridien. The front desk service efficiency was average, and I kept getting good reviews. The air conditioner in the first room was broken, and they were moved to another room after coordination. It is understandable that the room does not come with toothbrushes as standard, but the front desk could at least let him know. I wanted to call room service when I needed it, but it didn't work. No one ever answered the phone. You still need to go downstairs and pick it up at the front desk. All in all, the service needs to be improved.

The feeling of the hotel is very artistic, very high, and the environment is very good; in addition, the cleaning of the hotel is also in place, the rooms and public areas are cleaned, the hygiene quality is very well controlled, and the facilities and equipment They are also more advanced and intelligent. And the hotel's service control is also in place. From the moment I entered the hotel, I felt a warm welcome. The most impressive thing to me was Bella, the receptionist at the front desk. She arranged a room that satisfied me according to my needs. She is very professional, and her service attitude is excellent. From her, I feel the warm hospitality of a home away from home, and I will choose Conrad when I come to Shanghai in the future. A very good experience.

msg:It was too hot in Shanghai, so after checking out from another hotel, I decided to stay in the hotel instead of going home. After choosing it for a long time, the one I like is either too expensive or has already lived in it. Conrad is the best location, convenient transportation, suitable price, and relatively new decoration. Although there are many bad reviews on the Internet, I still decided to take a risk.
When we checked in, because we waited too long and there was no vacant room to clean up, we upgraded the executive room that was cleaned first, and moved into the 60th-floor super-high building. The 60-story super-high elevator is so fast that your ears will be stuffed in the elevator.
I don't know why there is no air conditioner in the corridor of the hotel. It is extremely hot. Every time I jog from the elevator to the room, it is too hot.
The area of the room is small and the design is very compact. The scenery outside the window on the 60th floor is excellent, but the window is a bit dirty.

The small room and bathroom took up a lot of space. The bathroom has achieved the most authentic and standard Japanese-style three-separation, especially the small bathtub in the shower, and the deep and small bathtub is completely Japanese-style. The bath water is huge, a bathtub can be filled quickly, and it is super comfortable to take a bath at night. I am a very fancy person about bathroom decoration design, so I like this design very much. The sound insulation of the room is super good. After staying for two days, I didn't hear a little sound from the next door or in the corridor. It was very quiet.

The breakfast is very good, there are many things, the place is big, very spacious
, Although there are a lot of people, it doesn't feel crowded at all.

There are also the signature Conrad bear and ducklings that can be taken away. This hotel currently only has this bear, there is no other color.

In general, this hotel is not as bad as the legends. Many problems are caused by too many guests. Too many people can't keep up with the service, but it can be seen that the service staff are trying their best to serve. , so many guests are so busy, but everyone's attitude is still super good and patient.

msg:I stayed at the first blacklist hotel in the country for 3 days and 2 nights. From the first day I arrived to the last time I checked out, I was very unhappy. First of all, when I arrived at the hotel, no one helped me with my luggage or open the door (no one helped me open the door every time I returned to the hotel). Then I had to wait 20 minutes to check in. When I checked in, I asked if I could help bring my luggage up. The staff said yes. Then I went to the room and waited for more than ten minutes before it was delivered. I called the concierge and the concierge said that I had put my luggage on the second floor. , this was not his responsibility, he asked me to find the staff member who helped me check in, and then I went downstairs to find it myself (it was too much). Then I went downstairs with my friend to take a taxi. The driver of the private car quarreled with the staff at the door. The driver of the private car was queuing up (there were 3 "luxury cars" parked in front of the door waiting for someone to pick me up? I don't know?) The staff didn't tell me about the 3 cars. He was trying to catch the special car I called, but he said he was blocking the way. So is it because I didn‚Äôt call for a Maybach car that I don‚Äôt deserve to be waiting in front of your hotel? Then I complained on Ctrip, and the hotel staff quickly called me and apologized, saying that there were insufficient staff and insufficient training, and offered me breakfast for two days (I didn't eat it).
Then we wanted to have a drink at the hotel in the evening, so we called for a bucket of ice. While waiting, we found that the TV and smart assistant in my room were not connected to the Internet. Then the staff arrived and gave me a "bag" Ice, yes, I don‚Äôt even deserve an ice bucket. I asked the staff member whether the TV and smart assistant in my room were connected to the Internet and couldn't be used. The staff member said: Oh, then you have to contact the engineering depar**ent, I can't control it. I:? ? ? How about I join your company directly? This hotel requires me to go to the hotel check-in staff by myself within one day and ask me the name of the hotel staff. It also requires me to go to the engineering depar**ent to solve the network problem by myself. You can't explain it without paying me wages. I really accept it.
As for the facilities, the bath water is only hot and cold, not moderate. Let‚Äôs talk about the service. When my friends booked the room, they were given cakes for three days (3 in total). They had to pick them up themselves and were not allowed to deliver them; every time they needed to call the service desk, they only called the service desk once out of 10 times. It was answered.
Also, when we went out on the first day, we met a cleaner who asked us if we were checking out. I was really convinced. On the first day, I didn't even sleep before she asked me if we were checking out.
Later, the hotel called me and explained to me "again" that there were insufficient manpower and insufficient training. It is also said that the hotel‚Äôs delivery staff and cleaners are all outsourced by third parties (outsourcing again, one of China‚Äôs traditions of shirking responsibility?)

msg:A Conrad that really has no service...
As the top 5% black diamond customer awarded by Ctrip, this is the first time I strongly want to give a bad review to a hotel.
First of all, from entering the hotel, there is no waiter to help open the door and take luggage, the first impression is not very good. The elevator went upstairs to the front desk. The front desk service was really blunt. There was no introduction, such as what time to breakfast, and no instructions. No one asked you if you needed a toothbrush or something. Then I went to the room and wanted to get a toothbrush. I made six or seven calls, but no one answered the phone. It was the first time I encountered no one at the front desk of the hotel. After persevering efforts, someone finally answered the phone. I asked in a good voice why the front desk has been unanswered for a long time. I was told that this is how we are. We are very busy and often no one answers the phone. I was stunned and speechless. As a normal hotel, is there no such thing as staff training? It's not the same as the Conrad in other cities in my impression...
The only good estimate is the location. But from the parking garage to the hotel is really quite detour.
