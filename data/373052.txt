Best location ever, Bund view with wide and clean windows (see the photos). 
Service is perfect. Front desk really helpful and they helped us a lot and they even provided us late checkout. 
The bar in the 36 floor is the best with the best view to the Bund and the Pearl Tower. 
Staff are really nice, they ordered our taxi and helped us a lot with our luggages

One of the highlights of my stay was visiting the Jade Bar on the 36th floor, which boasted the most breathtaking views of The Bund. The panoramic vistas from the bar were simply mesmerizing, offering a stunning backdrop to enjoy a drink or two. It was truly a memorable experience to take in the beauty of The Bund from such a vantage point.

In conclusion, the Shangri-La Pudong hotel exceeded my expectations with its cleanliness, inviting atmosphere, and spectacular views from the Jade Bar. It was a delightful stay that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a luxurious and unforgettable experience in Shanghai

From the moment I stepped into the hotel, the cleanliness of the facilities was evident. The rooms were immaculate, with every surface gleaming and the air fresh and welcoming.

What truly set this hotel apart was the staff. Each member of the Shangri-La team was not just professional, but genuinely friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to ensure that my stay was comfortable, addressing any needs with promptness and a smile that made me feel truly valued as a guest.

Whether it was the concierge offering insightful recommendations for exploring Shanghai or the housekeeping staff ensuring my room was always at its best, the service was impeccable. It’s rare to find a place where the staff not only performs their roles excellently but also creates a warm and friendly atmosphere that resonates throughout the entire establishment.

The Shangri-La in Shanghai is more than just a hotel; it’s an experience that I would highly recommend to anyone seeking luxury, comfort, and a team that makes you feel at home in the heart of this bustling city.

msg:I recently had the pleasure of staying at Shangrila Pudong and I must say, it was an incredible experience. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warm hospitality and a welcoming atmosphere. The check-in process was smooth and efficient, and the staff were friendly and accommodating.

The room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed, with all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and I slept soundly each night. The bathroom was modern and clean, with plenty of towels and toiletries provided.

The location of the hotel was also a major plus. It was conveniently located near many attractions and restaurants, and the staff were happy to provide recommendations and directions.

Overall, I would highly recommend Shangrila Pudong to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The staff, amenities, and location were all exceptional, and I cannot wait to return.

A bit expensive for what it is as is a bit old and total lack of soundproofing means you can hear noisy guests late into the night and it’s hard to get a good nights sleep with people playing TV, talking loud and constant door slamming all hours. Gym and pool are good and it’s an easy walk to the IFC center and subway line.

msg:Pros:
-location (walking distance from the bund, many restaurants nearby)
- view (if you get a bund view room)
- the lights are white, so it’a bright. It’s good if you need to do a make up or work, read, write.
- the room looked cleaned, no musty smell!
- breakfast was good, lots of varieties, but more Chinese style!

Cons:
- extremely old! Decoration is so old, the furniture, especially the chairs and armchair were full of stains, I didn’t feel comfortable sitting on them. It looked dirty.
- there was a HUGE line for breakfast! It was ridiculous! Around 9:30am, people were waiting for hours! The thing is that the hotel have two buildings, one new and one old! We were in the old building! I think it’s cheaper, and crowded, so the lines on our side of the building were long but we went to the other building because our friends were there and they said there was no line! So there is a preferential treatment! Make sure you book a room on the new building otherwise it won’t look like a five stars hotel! 
- the swimming pool, gym, bar, hair salon sushi restaurant are all in the new building as well, so you always need to cross to the other side of the hotel.
- the service was terrible! We called to ask if there were still tickets available for the New Year’s Eve party before we booked the room, and they said there were! Then we got there and they said they were fully booked. My friends went to the bar to ask again and asked if my son could enter the party they said they still had tickets and my son could join! They even joked that he couldn’t drink alcohol! Obviously! So we bought the tickets! When we got to the party they didn’t allow my son to enter, someone was already sitting on our table! We had to leave and ask for a refund! I completely ruined our New Year’s Eve plans! We were very frustrated.

From the moment we checked in, we were greeted with care and warmth. Wayne at the front desk, upgraded us to a lovely room and even gave our daughter vouchers for the play area because he noticed it was her birthday. Another concierge chatted with my husband about his 2 sons and made us all feel right at home.  We have a very friendly 1 year old and the staff, from the doorman to the breakfast waitstaff always took their time to make us feel welcome. We came back to our room while the aiyi was cleaning and the baby was so curious about her and she ended up playing with her and even running out to get a child’s bathrobe for my other daughter and an XL bathrobe for my husband without being asked. It was the level of care and hospitality that really stood out for me. 
The view from our room was amazing and our children sat at the window for hours watching the boats sail down the river. Easy access to so many places, a nice pool, good breakfast and nice place to stay overall.

The hotel's location was great being right in front.of the restaurants and bars along Fucheng Road. The East bund walking and bicycle lane can be accessed easily from the hotel. Dining for breakfast and dinner was also fantastic as they have a comprehensive selection of dishes from different cuisines. The service was awesome as all staff were very friendly and accommodating including those in the bar in the 36th floor of the grand tower. Btw, the bar was also  very cool and staying there for some time with drinks and a beautiful night view is pretty relaxing. I will come back again one time to Shangri-la Pudong.

msg:I had a wonderful staycation in Shangri-la, Pudong for my 50th birthday!  The room that was given to me did not have a good view, it shows the roof top with exhausts? of the next building.  My big thanks to Andrew, one of the front desk staff, who was very professional and accomodating.  He immediately made arrangements for me to transfer to a much better room.  I appreciate that they sent me a delicious birthday cake (chocolate mousse?).  The housekeeping staff was also very kind to allow me to put my luggage in the room while she was cleaning and it took her only ~30 minutes to tidy up the room.  The jacuzzi was so relaxing and the area is very clean.  I had a good sleep because the bed and pillows were so comfortable to lay on.  The breakfast buffet is very satisfying with a lot of food varieties.  However, there was no glass to put the juice in.  Instead, we used the regular white coffee cups.  Check out was also quick and I left the hotel with a smile when the front desk staff again greeted me, "Happy Birthday"!  Thank you Trip.Com and Pudong Shangri-la for making my 50th birthday memorable!  I will definitely go back to Pudong Shangri-la!

My room allowed me access to the horizon lounge. The horizon lounge offered a nice and quiet area to dine and chill. Breakfast, lunch and a light dinner = all complementary. Compared to the main dining hall there were a lot less people. They also had a happy hour where you could get free drinks including alcohol. I was given a room on the 30th floor, the view was amazing! 
I would definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it to friends.

The Rooms where clean and service at reception was good .

The food and beverage is very disappointing for a hotel if this quality and it seems management have no system- the staff have no direction and understanding of service.

msg:A very bad hotel stay experience! It is a five-star hotel, but apart from the geographical advantage of being able to see the river view, it is not a five-star hotel at all.

From getting off the car to checking in, no one guided us, not to mention asking if we needed help with the luggage. After checking in, when I opened the hotel room, it was almost 2,000 yuan? ? It was small and old, and the tiles of the facilities were all yellow and old. Considering that it is an older hotel, this is fine. After playing in Disney for a whole day, I wanted to find a better hotel to rest and take a bubble bath. Let the child take a bath in the bathtub first. When he came out, I saw that the whole bathroom was full of water. I thought he spilled the water while taking a bath, so I scolded him. There were no cleaning tools in the room, so I was sorry to bother the hotel staff to clean it up, and I was embarrassed to apologize to him. Who knew that when we used the bathtub later, the whole bathroom was full of water again when we filled the water! I looked at it and found that the floor drain under the sink was backflowing. As long as the bathtub was filled with water, the water would backflow from the floor drain, and it would also bring out a bunch of disgusting black dirt! Because it was past one in the morning, we changed into pajamas and didn't want to let outsiders in, so we were the only two cleaning the sewage. It was really very, very bad!!! What's even more disgusting is that when I checked out the next day and reported this situation, a fat manager said, "I'm sorry, I'll upgrade you next time." Me? ??? ??? Next time? ??? ??? How could there be a next time? This is just a perfunctory apology. Do you treat people as **? I said there won't be a next time, and then he said, give the child a doll, which is the mascot of the hotel. At the moment, I was actually very unhappy. Can a doll compensate for a bad experience of one night? Since it was this attitude, I didn't want to be said that I wanted some compensation, and I didn't want to be affected by this ****ty thing. I ignored him and left. At night, I went to a hotel in Hangzhou that cost more than 700 yuan. The comparison of the service facilities reminded me of the experience the day before. It was very unhappy! ! We were given such an ugly doll, and we were dragging two suitcases and a bunch of things. This doll undoubtedly added to our burden! It was even pulled from Shanghai to Hangzhou! The more I think about it, the angrier I get. With this bright red and bright blue color scheme, I really don't want to bring this ugly thing back to Xiamen. I immediately found a trash can to throw it away. I regret that I should have thrown it away in Shanghai at that time! ! How can such a rubbish hotel be rated with stars? ? This is the only stain on this trip to Shanghai and an unhappy experience! 

In a word, the store bullies customers with its size, and it also subverts my impression of a five-star hotel.

msg:I stayed at Shangri-La Hotel for my first checkup when I came to Shanghai for a tour.
This hotel was established in 1992 and has a very good location👍 The room has floor-to-ceiling windows and you can see the night view of the Oriental Pearl Tower from the window. I stayed in the room of Pujiang Building. Unfortunately, the toilet was a bit dirty. If you care about the environment, you can definitely stay in this hotel. To be honest, the actual price should match the price!
I like the scenery and some small things in the lobby.
I am relatively satisfied with the breakfast, which has a lot of varieties and starts from 6 am to 10:30 am. I am very satisfied with the lazy people👍
When checking out, the front desk staff also gave me a small gift🎁 Overall, I am quite satisfied👍

msg:Before traveling, I looked at several hotels and finally decided on Pudong Shangri-La. Needless to say the location is convenient. I booked a deluxe double room in Pujiang Building for two nights. I arrived late on the first night. After getting off the bus, a greeter helped me pick up my luggage and delivered it directly to the room. In this room type, I was assigned a city view and a partial river view (Picture 3). The next morning, I told the front desk that I thought I could hear some noise in the room (I couldn't hear it when I was sleeping, but I could hear it a little during the day). I arranged for a technician to take a look and said it was because it was close to the elevator, which made the front desk very happy. The hotel helped me change a room and upgraded it to a river view room with a view of the Wanguo Building Complex (Picture 1.2), which was really considerate. I had two breakfasts at the hotel. The food was rich, the fruit was delicious, and the coffee was delicious. I also experienced the hotel’s buffet for dinner, which was also in the Yi Coffee dining area. The salmon and sweet shrimp were all fresh, and the crispy roasted suckling pig was also delicious. Overall, I was very satisfied. The service staff are all polite and nice. The price difference between the holiday period and normal times is not that big, which is very conscientious. Already recommended to friends. I will choose here again next time I come.

msg:Very close to the Pearl Tower. Although the room I booked was not overlooking the Huangpu River, I could still see some river views from the room. The most unexpected thing was that when I lay on the bed and opened the curtains, the Shanghai three-piece suit was right in front of me. It felt like it was within easy reach. It was worth it. IFC was across the street, so it was super convenient to go downstairs for shopping. The room hygiene was also satisfactory. The disposable quilt cover I brought with me would not get messed up, and the room attendant helped me put it on when I cleaned up. I was so touched. While waiting for the elevator, I found that the entire Pearl Tower could be seen through the corridor glass. I didn't have to squeeze outside at all. I could see the Pearl Tower day and night. I also have to praise the hotel's swimming pool and sauna facilities. The water was very clean. In addition to dry and wet sweat steaming, the sauna room also had a massage pool, which was absolutely amazing and very comfortable. If I come to Shanghai again next time, I will definitely stay at Shangri-La Hotel again.

Just across the road from the hotel is the riverside, which is very comfortable for walking and eating. When I checked in, I upgraded to a river view room. You can see the river view through the floor-to-ceiling windows, which is very comfortable. The overall facilities of the hotel are relatively complete, and the services are very standard. However, the hotel room facilities are relatively old, and one of the electric curtains is broken. There are two TVs in the room, and one remote control can control two. It's magical. However, the room is quite spacious. The smell is quite loud when the corridor is being cleaned. The buffet restaurant is quite good, recommended.

The decoration is old, which is understandable, but can't the things be better? The guest experience is not considered at all.

Service:
The service is very poor. When we checked in that afternoon, we were asked to go to the temporary table in the restaurant upstairs to check in. The experience was extremely poor. The receptionist was a fashionable lady with red hair and her attitude was not friendly. Breakfast is eaten in such an environment. What the hell? Breakfast is more than 200 per person, and children are half price. There is no service and no experience.

Whether it is the subway or the ferry, it is very convenient to get to the Bund. The hotel hardware is also very good. The breakfast is rich and the service of the lobby staff is very good. The only flaw is that I checked in at 11 o'clock in the evening and called to ask for a pair of slippers to the room. It was not delivered until 12:30. I called the front desk 3 times and they just said to help me urge it. Later, I was too sleepy to do it, so I gave up. I really don’t know if such a big hotel can’t find someone to deliver a pair of slippers. I also said that I could go and get it myself, but it was fruitless. The next day, they didn’t take the initiative to put an extra pair of slippers in the room. The level of attentiveness to guests is not as good as some small hotels.

The hygiene is average and the cleaning is not timely. 4. There are no garbage bags, so it is very inconvenient to collect domestic garbage. There are no disposable toilet seats or bathtub covers. 5. The service is not proactive. I made a note of children's toiletries and slippers before checking in. After I checked in, the front desk told me again, but they still weren't delivered. I called again at 10:30 at night, but still no delivery. I called again at almost 12:00, and it took half an hour for the delivery to arrive. Very poor service! 6. Without a robot, you have to go downstairs to pick up items, which is very inconvenient.

First of all, the location is great, only a few hundred meters away from the Oriental Pearl Tower, next to the Zhengda Mall, opposite the IFC, and close to the subway station. Secondly, when checking in, I told the front desk lady that the children wanted to live on a higher floor, and she immediately arranged it considerately, and sent welcome fruits in the evening. The room is spacious and clean, with a wide view and a great view. The Oriental Pearl Tower is right in front of you, and the night view is super awesome. Thirdly, the staff in the hotel are very warm and thoughtful. I will definitely stay here next time.

Facilities and hygiene: 3 stars. After all, it is an old building. We mainly look at the scenery, although there is only one window! And the fully enclosed window is stuffy and the air is not good!
Some of the fruits sent were rotten and inedible!
All snacks on the bar are charged, only two bottles of cheap mineral water are free!
Napkins are only available in the bathroom, and they are used up after a few!
The most critical thing is that there was a sudden knocking sound at noon...

Because it was my birthday, Summer at the hotel front desk helped me upgrade to a sky king room for free, with a view of the Huangpu River, and gave me a breakfast and birthday cake. I woke up in the morning and marveled at the Bund C-position river view. It felt great! In addition, thank you to Nilo at the front desk for his good service attitude, helping me apply for membership and gifts, and having a happy and lucky birthday.

Although the upgrade fee was waived the next day, the experience on that day was still not very comfortable.

We booked a deluxe king room in the Pujiang Building. When we checked in, we asked about the river view room. Since we had plans for the afternoon, the lady at the front desk recommended a suitable upgrade package for the river view room (the view is great). After checking in, we started walking the baby.

For a short 2 days and 1 night trip and a family trip with children, I highly recommend choosing Shangri-La. The service pays great attention to details. There was no request for an extra bed when checking in, but when I returned to the room in the evening, I found that an extra small bed had been added. bed.

The location of the hotel is very good, close to the Binjiang Park on the riverside. In addition to the Shangri-La Yi Coffee Seafood Buffet Restaurant, there are bluefrog Blue Frog and Puais. Thai POETS.Thai Thai food, Chili's Cafe&Bar
, Tianshuilian Italian Restaurant, ELI FALAFEL Lebanese Restaurant, BROWNSTONE Spanish Restaurant, 1886 German Drive-in Restaurant...and the nearby Zhengda Plaza for dinner, light meals, coffee, milk tea, etc.

It's about a 5-minute walk from the Disney flagship store, which is also very convenient.

It’s about an 800-meter walk from the Dongchang Road ferry, and it’s 2 yuan to take a ferry. It’s also very convenient to go to the Bund.

Chaoyang is very bright all day long~
There are just a few small issues that I feel I must mention. Maybe I am too forced. There is no toilet in the hotel bathroom🗑️ I find it very inconvenient~ Although the trash can provided under the sink has a lid, it overall looks clean, but in reality It's inconvenient to throw away garbage~ I personally don't like the fact that the trash can has no bag~ And I think a box of tissue paper should be provided at the sink. Also, for the safety of electricity, the hotel fixed the hair dryer in the drawer of the desk outside~ I think it's very Awkward~ You have to dry your hair outside after taking a shower~ And there will definitely be a lot of hair on the carpet~ Anyway, it feels inconvenient~ The overall use of the bathroom can be improved~ There are hooks on the inside of the bathroom door for hanging clothes and bathrobes~
All you need to charge your mobile phone is a cord, which is very convenient~
The Evian water provided is so luxurious~ Haha
It’s very convenient to live here~ You can also take a taxi when you go out~ Go shopping~ Go to the aquarium~ Disney store (not far from the hotel~ You can get there after crossing the overpass)

Suggestion: It is recommended to replace the guest room toiletries (toiletries series). The smell is too fragrant and the quality is not good. For people like me who don’t take anything with me when I go out, it is a bit unfriendly~

msg:It was the first time I stayed in a hotel on New Year's Eve, hoping to give my family unforgettable memories. The result was indeed unforgettable... I chose the five-star Shangri-La, a deluxe river-view twin room in the "Pujiang Tower". In order to see the river view, I paid a reservation deposit, and it cost nearly one night. Two thousand yuan.
When I arrived at the store in the afternoon, there was no one to guide me during check-in, and the front desk was noisy. A foreign tourist told me where individual travelers should queue up. Then after a long process, I was told that there was no room reserved on the floor. When asked to upgrade our room to the "Purple Gold Building", we asked to see the room before making a decision. The person who seemed to be the manager replied that we could see the room after checking in. No one sent our luggage, so we two ladies dragged our luggage from Pujiang Tower to Zijin Tower by ourselves.
As a result, Pujiang Tower is right on the edge of the Huangpu River, but Zijin Tower is quite a distance away, without being informed at all. We called the front desk, but no one answered the first time. We left a phone number, but we didn't receive the call. After calling back, no one answered the phone for four minutes. We had to hang up in order to request a taxi. It was also difficult to request a New Year's taxi. No one contacted us again.
The room I changed was quite large and had a large TV, but the distance between the twin beds was about zero. . It's short and small. It's a large bed, but the bed is also very hard. The air conditioner is turned on to the minimum, but it is still very noisy. The ceiling spray in the shower room is dripping, and it can't be closed tightly. While washing the shower with hot water, the ceiling sprays cold water at the same time. .
The only thing that left a good impression was the room service staff, who were friendly and provided bottled water in plastic bottles in a timely manner.
There should be a lot of breakfast varieties, but it was too crowded and crowded. I didn't have time to take a closer look, but there didn't seem to be anything amazing.
Generally speaking, the hotel is dishonest in booking rooms, has no sense of service when checking in, deceives guests, has an arrogant attitude, and cannot be contacted. The room service attitude is good, but the facilities are old, the bed is uncomfortable, the noise is loud, the rest is not good, and the experience is poor.
After leaving, the customer service called to ask for advice and offered compensation, but we refused. We believe that the mood of the New Year and the experience of accommodation are more important than material things. We hope that the hotel can reflect on it.

msg:My family and I chose to stay in a hotel during the Chinese New Year. We also booked Puxiang’s buffet for the New Year’s Eve dinner. I originally booked a deluxe room in Pujiang Building. Later, because the room was being cleaned when I checked in, I was upgraded to an executive room in Zijin Building. Although the hotel decoration is slightly It's a bit old, but after all, it's been open for many years and is well maintained. The restaurant is very good and has a lot of choices. Breakfast is included in the order. There are many choices for breakfast, and the eggs Benedict are great. If I stay in a hotel during the holidays in the future, Uraraka will be my first choice.

I booked a room with a river view and loved it😁
The hotel environment is very good, the festive a**osphere is good, the hotel service is also very good, and snacks are provided. Baoer is very happy🥳
A special lion dance performance was arranged on the first day of the new year, but it would be better to consider the customer's feelings more during the ceremony.
I met maybe a foreign captain by chance, Baoer admits my mistake, I am inexplicably sorry😬, but🈶I can also consider it if I want to meet a girl🤣
Looking forward to 🈶 the opportunity to stay again 😄

When I checked into the room on New Year's Eve, there was a welcome fruit plate and the Oriental Pearl lanterns flashed outside the window. The next day, on the first day of the ***** new year, I watched a lion dance and dragon performance outside the door, and the entire hotel management appeared to celebrate the New Year. In the hotel, I even encountered the big boss giving big red envelopes to the shops in the hotel. Breakfast is mainly Chinese food, with rich varieties, including rice cakes that Shanghainese like. Looking forward to staying again next time.

If I didn't upgrade, I would say that Ctrip's room type was the worst. Ctrip didn't mark the room type of the house. Is it different from the definition of a hotel? The outside of the room is full of equipment, the hotel is relatively old, the cleaning is not clean enough, and the bathroom is a bit dirty. All in all, it was very different from my previous expectations for Shangri-La. It was the worst experience I have ever had in a five-star hotel, bar none.

msg:1. The service is very average and the service awareness is weak. Maybe we stay in five-star hotels on business trips, and the ones in other provinces and cities are better than this one in Pudong.
2. Hygiene I believe that the five-star hotel is definitely not like this, but I caught up with it and it is very understanding. Just a poor job.
3. When encountering such a thing, customers should be more satisfied. I believe that people who keep staying in five-star hotels are not doing this just to get a discount on the room rate. This matter is handled very poorly. Didn't get to the core of the problem.

Unhygienic photos will not be displayed
After all, Shanghai is the number one city in my heart

I stayed for three nights in total, but because there was constant noise from next door on the first night, my nephew and I didn't sleep well. Then we gave feedback to the hotel, and they upgraded the room to a room.

Well, after the upgrade, it is still good, but the weather is not very good, and my nephew has a fever, also because he didn't sleep well, so I hope the sound insulation will continue to be strengthened! ! !

The floors here are higher and the views are better.
In the Horizon Club, you can enjoy free afternoon tea, happy hour, and breakfast the next day.
The next morning there was a long queue for breakfast downstairs and it took a long time. It's much more comfortable in the luxury pavilion.
The lights on the Bund start to light up at 6 o'clock, and the night view is very beautiful~ Go for a walk in the morning, and the pedestrian path is close at hand.

The hotel is very close to the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Three Piece Suites on foot.

What's even more surprising is that after a good night's sleep, I posted a message on Moments with the location. When I woke up, I saw a comment. An old friend was also staying at the hotel that day, right above us. Make an appoin**ent right away and have breakfast together~

It turned out that the valve of the air conditioner pipeline was broken and it only supplied air but no heating. The next day after changing rooms, I woke up feeling dizzy, bloated, and had a cold and fever. I had no appetite for breakfast at all. I ate some hastily and immediately went home to take medicine and sleep to recuperate. In the photo, because there is no heating and air conditioning, the glass windows are full of water droplets, and the water droplets that have not been wiped off the corners of the windows and doors are still clearly visible. This shows the chaos in internal management.

Overall, I was satisfied. In the evening, the waiter gave a Happy New Year snack, and the child was very happy.
There is one point that I have repeated countless times, but Shangri-La has never corrected it. At least I have raised this issue in Nanjing and Shangri-La in Shenyang. It’s facial tissue. It shouldn’t be placed in the bathroom or outside the room. Napkins must be provided. As a global chain of luxury brands, this customer pain point should be corrected.
In addition, the toothbrush is of very poor quality and I hope it will be replaced.

Although it was only one night, my writing skills really cannot describe all the surprises and satisfactions. I still have to be there to experience it!
As I write this, the paper is full of praise. Some people must think that this must be a gunman article, haha.

Although it is extremely well maintained, But you can still see the traces of time, not shabby, but style!

I gave the storage card to the concierge staff and said that it should be taken to the room. , let’s just say, you can pull two pieces by yourself... 😓 For a room that costs thousands per night, I feel that this service is not up to par.

Lynn Lorena Yuna Candy Zari from the guest relations team [turn in circles][turn in circles] was worried about me being afraid of the noise. Got me a room on a high floor. Outside the window is the night view of the Huangpu River and the Oriental Pearl Tower. Totally stunning. The Chris**as tree decoration in the lobby is also super stunning. Thank you❤️Looking forward to your next stay

msg:On my first night in Shanghai, I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, Pudong, at the top of the city. It has been 10 years old and the equipment is a bit outdated. I went for a walk in the morning and came to the riverside. I found the tall and luxurious Pudong Shangri-La Hotel. The entrance to the hotel was extremely busy. It seemed that many large conferences were held here. Hotel and conference staff were attracted to and from the hotel. It was very lively and I could feel the economic recovery. A breath of vitality. Entering the hotel, the aisles at the front desk on the riverside floor and the front desk on the roadside floor are very luxurious. The guests are distinguished and elegant, mostly foreigners, each with a confident smile and a fashionable a**osphere. Chris**as is coming, full of Chris**as decorations, and many children are happy After having fun, I immediately decided to stay at Shangri-La today. The front desk staff is very smart and dedicated. They will help guests consider the perfect feeling and let you choose. The lobby cafe is also great. In the afternoon there is a performance of Chinese and Western musical instruments including piano, guzheng and pipa. It is perfect for a music lover like me. The room is clean and tidy, with a wide view. I got up at 5 o'clock in the morning and went to the fitness room. The equipment was very complete. My phone was almost out of battery. The staff enthusiastically helped me find a charger. The service was great. After the workout, swimming felt good, the temperature was suitable, the water was clear, and I felt comfortable after swimming in the sauna and soaking in the pool. The breakfast is extremely rich, with a combination of Chinese and Western options. This trip to Shanghai was extremely perfect. The romance of the Ritz and the luxurious enthusiasm of Shangri-La gave me the strength to work. This should be the ceiling of a five-star hotel.

The hygiene is average, the facilities and equipment are also seriously aged, the minibar has obvious stains, and there is a big problem with the toilet drain. There is only one trash can in the bathroom and it is puzzling that it is under the sink and not next to the toilet (adding a trash can should be the fastest solution). Breakfast is also room for improvement at Shangri-La.

msg:Overall, the service is very poor, it's a very old hotel, and the room facilities are really old.
I chose this hotel because of the location, going to the Zhengda Plaza for exams. It's right next to Zhengda Plaza, right outside the Oriental Pearl Tower, and the location is really good. The environment is also good, a traditional old hotel bar with nice Chris**as lights.

However, the service in the hotel is really terrible! When parking the car, the driver didn't know that he could drive up. The doorman/security guard/doorman at the door not only didn't help me carry my luggage up the hill, but they also surrounded the car and shouted at me, and asked me: "Why don't you let him drive up?" Huh?" What can I say? I could only reply, "How do I know? I'm a tourist." [You can tell the truth about the quality of the hotel by helping with luggage, it's really good]

Check in at the lobby, normal. But when I went back to the room and asked the front desk if there were various things, there was nothing. And I actually have a question, why do you reply to me in English after hearing me say hello?

The most speechless thing is that when I went to take the exam the next day, my mother was waiting for me in the lobby. My mother, who is almost 60 years old, failed to set up wifi by herself, so she asked the front desk for help. Brother at the front desk or baggage management office, why does my mother ask you in Mandarin, but you always reply to her in English proudly? Why are you checking back and forth with such a bad attitude, asking her repeatedly what room number/what name you used to register/why you can't be found... Are you okay? Yes, we Hong Kong/Cantonese people speak more Cantonese, but Mandarin is not that bad, right? What do you mean by using English to this teacher who doesn’t speak English very well? I see you are respectful to white people!

Extremely speechless! If it’s not because I have to take an exam, I will definitely not help you again! Shangri-La is really old!

In order to prevent your hotel from discriminating against us in Mandarin or Chinese, the following expressions are in English. I believe your English level will be able to understand it!

I feel really exhausted and annoyed about the service in the hotel. I had been traveled lots of luxury hotels domestically and internationally, this is the first time I feel so uncomfortable about the service. And I definitely will not choose your brand any more. You guys are so rude, and so impolite and unfriendly to the one who really needs your help. More training should be required for you.

I really don’t like you!

msg:The biggest advantage of this hotel is that it is close to the Oriental Pearl Tower, Jin Mao Tower, Shanghai Center, and World Financial Center. It has a rich breakfast variety and a large dining area. The rest is hard to describe.

First of all, the check-in at the front desk was extremely slow. There were only one or two check-in staff, and the queue had been waiting for at least ten minutes. The room was not available yet, and there was no telling how long it would take. It was already past two o'clock in the afternoon, and there were also complaints from guests. The sound was very loud, and just because of the queue problem, the entire space was extremely hostile.
And there are a lot of foreign guests... The equipment in the room is also very old, there is a strong smell as soon as you enter, the decoration has a sense of the times, and the refund of the deposit is very slow... I really want to avoid this kind of old hotel when traveling, it makes people feel extremely uncomfortable. It doesn't deserve a 4.8 rating.

The overall feeling is that this hotel is like an old green train, driving slowly on its own track. No matter how great the changes are outside, it will not change its own style?
 
I won’t choose again in the future.

msg:On this business trip, I booked the Shangri-La Hotel in Lujiazui Financial Center, Pudong on Ctrip. The overall experience is very nice. The service level of a five-star hotel is quite good. Whether it is from the front desk to the guest room, or from the guest room to the restaurant, the staff take the initiative to say hello and make guests feel at home.

 I would also like to give a thumbs up to an employee at the front desk named Nina-Zhang Di. It is necessary to write something to her. First of all, Nina checked in for me when I checked in. She was smiling throughout the whole process. The experience she gave me was particularly good at the beginning. A smile can really heal a person's soul. This is something I can truly feel. Arrived.
  If Nina’s smile was the beginning of my unexpected encounter with Shangri-La Hotel, then what happened the next day was the perfect ending.
  Due to changes in itinerary the next day, we need to stay for another three days. Seeing that Ctrip's original room type had been booked, I was very troubled at this time. Then I came to the front desk and Nina greeted me. After learning about my situation, she told me that I could place an order for the currently available room type on the official website and extend my stay in the original room. My troubles were solved, which was really unexpected. When I originally thought I might consider changing hotels, I didn't expect that I wouldn't have to worry about it.
  I am very grateful to Nina for her proactive and enthusiastic help. Although I was very tired from the busy schedule during this business trip, her smile and proactive service attitude gave me a lot of comfort.
  In addition, the view of the river-view room facing the Bund that Nina arranged is also very eye-catching. The window is facing the century-old Bund buildings. At night, when the lights are on, the lights are brilliant and beautiful. Standing in front of the window of the room, you have an unobstructed view.

In addition to the buffet breakfast, you can also make exquisite Western-style meals to order. The service at Shangri-La is as good as ever, with all staff greeting us with a smile. The toiletries are from Osudan and the water is from Evian. If you need takeout, it is very convenient. No matter whether it is a new building or an old one, there is a takeout cabinet at the door on the first floor. Will come again next time!

msg:I have no doubts about the service staff of the hotel, except for the front desk staff who checked me in. She was a woman. I don’t know how she felt good about herself. She looked up at people and spoke with contempt. I booked the river view. Is it because of your attitude that you pay more than 4,000 per night for a suite? If there is a room, I will not change it. Later I asked to call the manager. She was standing there playing with her mobile phone. The person next to her said that she was calling the manager. I didn’t even say a word to her. , just playing with her mobile phone, and treating customers like this. Really, I have stayed in so many five-star hotels. How long have I lived in Shangri-La in Beijing? I have never received this kind of trea**ent. After I changed rooms, I was told that the fruits in the room were reserved for members. Come on, I really didn’t want to get angry with her, so I didn’t say anything. ***I’ve lived in a five-star hotel for so long that I never knew that the room I stayed in didn’t have fruit. If the room I rented was a normal room, you could treat her differently. , why am I not worthy of eating a few of your broken bananas with more than 4,000 yuan? This is my last time at Shangri-La, I will never stay there again, and I won’t let anyone around me stay there either.

msg:Just this small bed, so close, is this a room worth 1500? , it’s so deceiving, but the most deceiving thing is the room. You can smell the moldy smell as soon as you get off the elevator, and the smell is even stronger after entering the room. The most deceiving thing is that the furniture in the room smells of inferior furniture after the room becomes moldy. It irritates my eyes. I dare not open the cupboard door. The smell is even stronger and irritates my eyes. It’s too painful to live here. The lobby here is magnificent, but I’m not staying in the lobby. No matter how nice the lobby is, it’s useless. I wanted to make do with it when I came back. It was okay to stay here, but I couldn't sleep well, and my son kept coughing. I called the front desk to report the problem, and the attitude was okay. I didn't expect that this room smelled worse, and then they helped me find another one, saying it was in another building. , turned around several times and then said that they made a mistake and it was still this building. I returned to this building and the room was darker. I kept going from 11 to 12 o'clock in the evening, but it still hadn't been changed. They started to ask me to change to a double bed room and add another one. The bed, but the small double bed that is very close to each other is still like this. The smell is very strong. I'm fooled by sleeping in this Shangri-La. I won't get sick if I live here. The smoke originally gave me a headache. After another hour of tossing, it will be better. Each one was worse than the other. They all felt like they had been in the house for a long time, and were dark and damp. I suspected that all their rooms were like this, so I had no choice but to go back to the room and lie down. After finally surviving the night, I quickly opened them when I got up in the morning. The damp smell in the corridor is smaller than that in the room. There is no furniture, so there is no smell of inferior furniture. I urge everyone not to be fooled. It is not like this for 200 a night. I booked on Ctrip.com and told Ctrip that this room is like this. How can I pay 1,500? Ctrip negotiated with Shangri-La and refused to discount the last penny. It’s really annoying. If it weren’t for midnight, I would have left directly.

Finally, I chose Pudong Shangri-La Hotel because there were not many tourists after the National Day. The service was very good and I informed you in advance of the anniversary. The hotel specially decorated the room in a simple way. They also gave me cakes and red wine and the kids had a lot of fun. The environment and sanitation are okay. Maybe I stayed in the Zijin Pavilion deluxe room with panoramic glass. I could lie on the bed and look at the Huangpu River across from the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street. After checking in, I could go to the Oriental Pearl Tower next to it. Afterwards, you can go back to the hotel to have afternoon tea and then go shopping at Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street.

msg:The shower head is really dirty. I have never seen it so dirty. It is full of dirt and has a thick layer. It seems that no one has cleaned it for a long time. This shows that the hotel is very poor and lazy. Is it difficult to clean the shower head? ? There is no overhead shower in the bathroom, only this dirty and broken hand shower. The carpet was extremely dirty, with large areas of stains. The buildings were very close to each other. Outside the window was the exterior wall of another building. It was very light-blocking. The area was very small. It was sold at a five-star price. In fact, the hardware environment was at the level of a fast hotel.
The vast majority of tourists want to avoid lightning. If they want to see the scenery, they must go to the highest observation deck of the Oriental Pearl Tower or find a restaurant near the river. Don't expect to see any scenery in this hotel. The hygiene is very poor. The price is not as good as a chain hotel, and it is not worthy of a five-star hotel. .

msg:As a business person who travels frequently, I often stay at Shanghai International Deluxe Hotel and I am very satisfied every time. Compared to this time, it was a very unpleasant and unpleasant check-in experience. The attitude at the front desk was poor and unprofessional. My reservation information could not be found? After I presented my booking confirmation and payment voucher, the front desk still insisted that there was no reservation for me? At the same time, he asked me if I was sure I booked it on Ctrip? I would like to ask if the four big words "booking successful" written in black and white on the paper issued by Ctrip can't be read clearly? Do you mean I'm joking? This not only delayed my time but also affected the plans of me and my family. At the same time, the children were hungry and waiting because of the front desk. They were originally scheduled to have dinner in the hotel, but after all the hard work, they finally checked in. , who knows that the reserved restaurant (19:30) has closed! The key point is that the front desk was unapologetic throughout the entire process, amazing!

msg:Overall, it conforms to the positioning of an established luxury hotel. The lighting, decoration, glossiness of the tiles in the lobby, and the enthusiasm of the service staff are better than those of the Westin across the river.
Pujiang Tower was built and opened around 1998, and the room facilities should have been updated in 2009. Compared to the Westin's old-fashioned feel (of course some people call this old money feel), Shangri-La's facilities are slightly newer, but The control methods for bathrooms, bathtubs, washstand lamps, TVs, room lights and one-to-one wall switches are no longer convenient nowadays. Old five-star brands such as Guangzhou Garden and Baiyun Hotel have all been updated, and we hope to update them as soon as possible.
Everything else is a plus. The pillow is also very unique. It is very long and comes in two types: high and low. People who are used to sleeping on latex pillows can also sleep well.

The facilities for children are especially complete: Lego, children's slippers, bathrobes, and toiletries. Very satisfied with this! It's just that the facilities are relatively old and you can see some sense of age. There was no plug in the bathroom and the curling iron didn't work.

msg:My son wanted to see the scenery of the Bund during the National Day. He struggled with many hotels for a long time because the Banyan Tree was too far away and the Wanda was not the most ideal location. Finally, he booked the Shangri-La. I was worried that the room facilities would be old because of my old relationship, so I booked the Zijin. Deluxe room with Bund view in the luxury pavilion on the upper floor. The result was much better than I expected. The cleanliness and hygiene were very good. Except for the fact that the facilities were not the latest, the maintenance level was very good and the service was very good. For my son’s birthday this month, I also got a cake. My son also liked it very much. I ate it and thought it tasted good.
I am also very satisfied with the Horizon Club benefits. I also booked the Shangri-La Horizon Club when I went to Nanjing before, so I feel good about the executive benefits. I will continue to consider Shangri-La Hotel for future trips. Usually I am too lazy to comment, but the situation of the hotel this time is worth commenting on.

msg:A five-star hotel is actually of such a standard. First of all, let’s not talk about the hotel’s condition, and then let’s talk about the service: I lost my ID card while having breakfast in the hotel restaurant, and the waiter didn’t report it to the hotel when I found it. I found out that I had lost my ID card, so I called the hotel and simply said it was not there. I confirmed again that it was not there. Later, the guest refused to give up and went to the breakfast room to look for it again. It turned out that the waiter had found it and put it on the counter where the breakfast tickets were collected. Five Is this what star-rated hotel services are like? Wouldn't it be handed over to the hotel front desk to contact the guest? Really can't express it in words. I am posting this review in the hope that all my friends will think twice before choosing this hotel. I sincerely give a negative review.

If you don't want "calories" or "make meat buns", you just want to spend your free time looking at the scenery, shopping to be eye-catching, and meeting friends with delicious food, SHANGRI-LA is the best choice.
Get up in the morning and go to bed late, take a walk along the river at the wrong peak; when you are hungry, you can sit anywhere and there are all kinds of delicious food; when you are tired, sit in front of the window and have a panoramic view of the buildings from all over the world on the other side of the river; fortunately, you find that there are obviously more ships on the river. May the world be prosperous. , the country is peaceful and the people are safe!
This year I have stayed at Pudong Shangri-La 4 times. From the Zijin Tower to the Pujiang Tower, each one has its own merits. The Zijin Building is a new building, relatively large and new, but the view will be blocked by the Pujiang Building. The view from the Pujiang Tower, especially the main river view room, is unparalleled.

First of all, I stayed in the Zijin Building. The lobby is very grand. The corridors are carpeted and very clean. The room is very big. You can directly see the Oriental Pearl Tower from the window. The room is also very clean and very quiet at night. The Oriental Pearl Tower and Tomson Yipin are nearby. The housekeeper is also very nice. Be patient, the hotel bed is actually 2 meters tall, maybe because it doesn’t sound good, it’s made 1.98 meters tall. I think all conveniences are very good. If you are afraid of old facilities, then book the Zijin Building. This is a new building. Whether a hotel is good or not depends on the details. Shangri-La Group is doing better.

msg:When I was a child, I, a Shanghai girl, always dreamed of spending my birthday by the Huangpu River one day. Two days ago, my dream finally came true at the Pudong Shangri-La Hotel.

I booked a Superior Bund View Super Deluxe Room in the Purple Tower Horizon Club, which gave me an unobstructed view of the Bund’s international architecture. After the lights are turned on at night, it is even more dazzling and gorgeous.

Compared with the beautiful scenery, what gave me an unexpected surprise was the Shangri-La Hotel's concierge. Their team (Lynn Cathy Lucy Lorena Sarita Kikyo Freda Miya) carefully decorated the room for me. When I opened the door, I was greeted by a room full of balloons, flowers, birthday cakes and birthday cards with deep blessings written on them.

If you are looking for a hotel with a superior location, a first-line river view, and high cost performance in Shanghai, then Pudong Shangri-La Hotel is definitely your first choice, because every angle of it is pleasing to the eye, and every staff member is attentive and considerate. Make you feel at home.

Because I took an early flight and arrived at the hotel around 12:00, Nina at the front desk enthusiastically checked me in and helped coordinate a high-floor city view room. When I was about to leave, Nina took the initiative to tell me that I could give her the invoice and issue it in advance so that I wouldn’t have to wait in line when I left the store tomorrow. I was touched by this proactive service awareness. I have stayed in many hotels on business trips, but this time Nina's employee's proactive service awareness made me truly feel what it means to feel at home.

msg:The room was basically as expected, and the hygiene was OK. The key point is that we started cleaning the glass curtain wall at about 8 o'clock on Saturday morning. During this period, the sound of the rope hitting the glass woke me up several times. I really couldn't sleep. Finally, I couldn't bear it anymore and communicated my hope with the service desk at 9 o'clock. Stopped cleaning, but still didn't stop after waiting for a long time. I had no choice but to call the service center for the second time and strongly requested it to stop the operation. The service personnel later came to explain, but still did not stop the operation and gave reasonable explanation or compensation.
As a well-known high-end hotel, Pudong Shangri-La cannot even provide the hotel's most basic sleep service, which is really disappointing. It is also the only disappointing accommodation experience I have had so far in Shanghai.

msg:It’s all a history of blood and tears, so please don’t book here! Is Shangri-La so bad now? I hope Shangri-La Hotel Group has quality control and will take a closer look at this. I stayed here on a business trip a few years ago and I thought the location and night view were good. This time I brought my children to play and I booked this hotel specifically. The Shanghai Pudong Shangri-La, which has received a lot of bad reviews, is not bad with my negative review, but the Shangri-La Group definitely hurt a long-time member.
It's already 11:50 in the middle of the night. We can't take a shower because there is no cold water in our room but only hot water. We haven't been able to rest. We checked in very late on the first night with our 4-year-old child because we had played in Disney. There was no cold water in the shower room, and the minimum temperature was 50 degrees +, which was very hot, so we didn't take a shower. I went out early the next morning and came back to the hotel in the evening to coordinate and repair, but to no avail. The key is that the hotel replaced people throughout the whole process. They didn't answer the phone, wasted time, and no one had the attitude of wanting to serve you. I started The hotel's suggestion was to let us take a shower in the nearest room because we didn't want to change rooms and delay our rest. The hotel did not agree. After being delayed for more than an hour, they still let us take a shower in a room at the end of the corridor, and the room fee was not reduced at all! ! They said the most compensation would be a late check-out. I thanked you. Do you know what time my flight is the next day? I paid the room fee normally, why did you delay my rest by giving me a room without a shower? In addition, the manager on duty looked condescending and not apologetic at all. He said that he was delayed in coming here so late because he had been trying to understand the situation. Finally, I said that I wanted to record the situation on video. It was true that our room was delayed because the faucet was broken and we could not take a shower. After a break, he said that he was going to the engineering depar**ent to understand the situation. So what did he just say that he had been understanding the situation? In addition, the manager also boasted that the faucets had been checked before check-in and were in good condition. Does this mean that they were damaged during our stay? I have memorized a lot of clichés, all of which cannot stand up to scrutiny, making people even more angry. I wouldn’t tell other details if it weren’t for the unpleasantness:
1. When I checked in, I found a very long black hair on the bedside table. After cleaning the room the next day, the hair was still there (our hair was short and dyed). It was old. Is it hygienic?
2. When I took a taxi to the hotel, there was no doorman to pick up my luggage, so I had to run inside the hotel to find it. The concierge was just helping a foreigner call a taxi on his mobile phone. After telling him the situation, he asked him to wait without calling anyone. It feels like there are only two concierges in the hotel, and there is no service when they are busy.
3. It was said that it was a family hotel, but when I asked the front desk about the family facilities, I didn’t know anything about it.
4. When I was going through the room renewal procedures the next day, I met a front desk person who said that he would not be able to come to work on the first day. Alas, there is really no one at Shangri-La. Newcomers are not trained on the first day but go straight to work! When I asked about nearby facilities, I said I didn't know about them and I just came here. . .
5. The shower room cannot be used. I wanted to use the bathtub, but it turned out that the drain was blocked! ! You have to hold your hand down before getting into the water, which means you have to wait there for the water to drain out after washing. And there is no water-blocking shower curtain. After taking a shower, the floor is covered with water, which is super slippery! Too dangerous! ️
It would be better to stay in an express hotel. I had a lot of fun in Magic City, but staying in this hotel was really my biggest mistake! Discredit Shanghai!

Although the room is smaller than the previous Zijin, it is enough for two people. The bathroom is dry and bright, with complete toiletries, and welcome fruit! Sitting in front of the window at night to enjoy the night view of the Oriental Pearl Tower and the river is very pleasant.
The next day's breakfast started at 6 o'clock, Shanghai was dawning early, and we went to Yi Cafe on the second floor to eat on time. The restaurant is quite big, and there are many varieties of breakfast, including Chinese-style steamed cakes, pasta, porridge, authentic Shanghai dishes, Western-style bread, pastries, salad cheese, various sausages, and Japanese-style miso soup. There are also five or six kinds of fruits. Drinks include coffee, milk, juice, etc. Generally speaking, the quality is good!
Check-out is quick and easy when you leave. Recommended hotel!

Seeing that we were a family of three, they specially arranged a room with a sofa bed for us, which was very heart-warming. It is super convenient to stroll around the nearby shopping malls at night, eat, and check in at the Oriental Pearl Tower and Lujiazui.

msg:At the end of the vacation, I stayed at the Disneyland Hotel for one night. My conclusions are as follows: the hygiene is no problem and meets the standards of a hotel in this price range. The environment and location are nothing to say. I overlook the Bund from a distance and the Oriental Pearl Tower up close. The night view is pleasing to the eye. The hotel is just a few steps from the Shanghai Ocean. It is not far from the hotel, Lujiazui three-piece suite, and the first-class mansion, Tomson One-Station. It is also quite pleasant to spend some time strolling along the riverside and looking at the Bund. In addition, as for the last picture, the hotel should contact Super Brand Plaza to either green the roof of the Super Plaza Plaza and turn it into a sky garden, or paint it all into color art, so that all the hotel can see is the scenery, which will be more perfect. It's much better than the rusty ones we see now; the hotel has been renovated for a long time, and the facilities can't keep up with the times. Look at the toilet. It splashes water if you're not careful, and I forgot to take a picture of the mattress. I felt the mattress was poor and I slept very uncomfortable. It was not as good as the Sealy mattress at the Disneyland Hotel. Finally, I focused on the service. When I checked out at about 10:45 the next day, I casually asked how long it would take to get to Pudong Airport and the subway. Which one is faster? The waiter replied, "Private car transfer ***". I didn't hear clearly at the time, so I asked again. As a result, the waiter shouted impatiently, "Private car transfer is 900*...Look at the waiter's answer." and disgusted looks in our eyes, which made our pleasant trip to the magical city suddenly not so good... Pudong Shangri-La, I'm sorry to give you a bad review of the service!

When I first arrived at the hotel, there were a lot of large and small boxes, but no one was there to help me. I went to the lobby to ask someone to help push them. The suitcase was not delivered to the room until 20 minutes after check-in. Sitting dryly and waiting.
Checked in at 2 o'clock. I ordered a parent-child decoration. There was no decoration when I checked in. After calling twice to confirm, I brought in black bags and arranged them one by one. There are no surprises for children. The floor was set so low that I couldn't even take pictures outside the window. I could only see the dirty top floor on the opposite floor. I wanted to move to a higher floor, but there was no room. Fortunately, I only stayed for one night and moved to another hotel. hotel.
I was told that the go-kart in the parent-child package can only be played by those aged 5 and above. Finally, I found the front desk manager to coordinate and gave it away to the children🧸.
When I checked in and took a nap in the afternoon, there was the sound of decoration.
The overall feeling is too low. Suzhou Shangri-La has also stepped on the thunder. This time I really learned a lesson.

msg:I came to Shanghai to watch a concert on the weekend. In order to stay comfortably and eat happily, I chose the Shangri-La in Pudong instead of a nearby hotel. I thought that the old five-star hotel is always a safe place. As a result, the experience this time is really hard to describe.
The first step is to check in. When I pushed my suitcase in and checked in, there was no concierge staff to greet me and help with my luggage. Due to the large number of people checking in, four check-in windows were opened when I arrived at around 4pm, and there were more than three people waiting. The processing process was a bit slow, but the amazing thing was that the captain of a foreign airline came to handle it and opened a separate window and completed it quickly. I really felt that I was being treated differently.
The second is the maintenance of room facilities. I stayed in a large bed room in Pujiang Building. There was only a plug in the corner of the desk for charging. It is super unfriendly to Apple’s current interface. There are wireless and USB charging at the bedside. The charging port on the desk was broken when we arrived. We called the maintenance man and it was handled quickly. However, as a five-star hotel, basic facility maintenance and inspections were still not in place.
Finally, breakfast, very, very, very speechless? ! If the number of guests exceeds the reception capacity, the hotel should carry out diversion planning in advance and in time. When we went there after eight o'clock, there was a long queue at the door. There were obviously many empty tables inside but the guests were left waiting in line for a long time. Moreover, the management was chaotic. In the middle of the queue, the staff asked if there were five guests together, and then let the five newly arrived guests in in front of the dozen or so guests in front. What does this mean? Learn how to call online celebrity stores by zone? It's obviously a self-service breakfast bar, why don't you explain it and ask the opinions of the customers in front of you? After everyone expressed their dissatisfaction about this matter and waited for a long time, the hotel began to guide people in line to dine in the banquet hall and other areas, but it was probably that the configuration could not keep up. Later, I saw that many people who had gone before came back. And after we went in and arranged the seats, because we didn’t bring anything with us for breakfast, we came back after breakfast and found that the seats were occupied by other people (since we were queuing up to register, not to mention that there were too many people, we couldn’t serve at a single table, so at least we reserved it for the guests who came in) seat bar). In the end, because I queued for so long, I missed the high-speed train and almost couldn't get home.
All in all, the lack of management ➕ confusion ➕ incomprehensible queuing system ➕ differential trea**ent, all at the same time in this five-star hotel, is really shocking and disappointing. I’m afraid I won’t and won’t dare to choose Shangri-La next time.

msg:I thought I could see the Bund river view, but it turned out that there was only a small glass door on the floor. The room was stuffy and the toilet had a peculiar smell. The big bed was two small beds joined together. Shangri-La didn't even have a smart toilet seat. Only the service staff was satisfactory. Breakfast Dining was in the building. We originally planned to stay for 2 nights. After the first breakfast, we decided to change our itinerary and check out. We went to the Ritz-Carlton next door. The price difference was NT$800. However, the facilities, night view, breakfast and seats overlooking the Oriental Pearl Tower were worth it. ! Should decide to stay at Ritz for 2 nights

There was a shuttle bus to Disney. When we came back, only one of our hotels also sent a car to pick us up. The concierge depar**ent was very polite Very polite and caring. Guest room customer service has also established WeChat to communicate meticulously. The room is clean and tidy. The softness of the bed is more suitable for us. The Oriental Pearl Tower can be seen through the window. It is also close to the Pudong Riverside Bund. There are fewer people than the Bund. It is convenient to walk to the pier, cross the river and take the subway. It is still the right choice.

By the way, Zijinlou LOUNGE basically meets the needs of breakfast and dinner, so you don’t need to go out to find food. 😊😊😊

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first: the room is large and the facilities are relatively new, with a good view! The gym and swimming pool are also available. The window faces the Huangpu River, and there are quite a lot of people walking along the river! The location of the hotel is very convenient. One door can go to the riverside, and the other door can go to ifc. There are also many gourmet restaurants on the riverside. There are all kinds of western food, barbecue bars and so on. You have to queue for about an hour. There is no such thing as this summer vacation. The solution is to have more people.
Let's talk about the hotel, the service is a bit weak, the auntie who is the pool attendant is rather indifferent, but everything else is fine.
Especially the check-in procedure, it is called slow! Waited for more than three hours! Wait from 10:30 to 13:30! They move really slowly! Each one is slow rather than a certain one. I feel like I am not familiar with the business. I took the room card and continued to answer various questions for the guests. There was a long line behind me waiting to check in, and each line was in a long line. The entire check-in front desk was useless. It was a mess. Can't I ask another question for the consultation? There are two reception staff next to you to assist with the process. What do they do? The most important thing is that after waiting for so long, there is no glass of water for you, and there is no welcome drink in the lobby, which immediately lowers the rating of the five-star hotel level!

After all, it is a brand, but there are also bad reviews, so I was a little apprehensive before staying here, but I am still very satisfied after arriving. Satisfied. First of all, the location is very good. It is very close to the three-piece apar**ent and the Oriental Pearl Tower. If the physical strength allows, it takes about ten minutes to walk. It is very convenient. The room is a river view room with a wide view. Secondly, the decoration and layout of the lobby and rooms are very good, they are well maintained, and there is no obvious damage. Because I didn't decide on a room with breakfast this time, I mainly thought that I couldn't get up in the morning, so I don't know the situation of the restaurant. The fly in the oin**ent is that the air conditioner in the room is too loud and needs to be turned off when sleeping at night. I hope it can be improved. Generally speaking, I recommend it and will not step on thunder.

This time, the fan is the cleaning lady on the 13th floor of the capital building. She is very gentle. Because I have a cold, she has been expressing her concern. Seeing me resting in bed, she has been helping me tidy up lightly. She is very sorry. It makes people who are away from home feel very warm.

When you get to the floor, the carpet is really not clean, and the most important thing is that there is a peculiar smell; when you get to the room, the bed is very small, which is not allowed Evaluation, because the hotel only has this kind of bed, but the hygiene makes me very uncomfortable.

2. Hotel facilities: I bought a special discounted room type from Ctrip, which is very good. You can directly see the Oriental Pearl Tower and a three-piece suite (it’s a pity that you can’t see the Shanghai Center). The hotel facilities meet the five-star standard. Children's small toys and Pu Xiaoxiang's dolls!
3. Hotel service: very good, 2 vouchers are given when you check in, you can go to B3 to drive a card car (return 100). What made us happy was that we came back from Hangzhou at night. It happened to be our daughter’s birthday that day. The hotel specially prepared a birthday cake🎂, it was great, and the service was really good!

From the moment you enter the hotel, there is no one to help you open the door, pick up the luggage, enter the lobby, and no one informs the front desk when checking in. I told you that I would stay for 3 days and only swiped the room card for one day. I swiped the room card again because we were on two floors and they didn't tell us where to go to the wrong building. The cleaning lady patiently told us where to go downstairs and asked the front desk staff with a disdainful attitude. She pointed at me too. Hahaha. During the whole stay, the cleaning aunt was really nice and the attitude of other service staff made me speechless. The hotel bathroom leaked in the shower. No matter how late at night, the aunt came to help clean it. I don’t believe that I was the only one who discovered the leak. I pretended to be a service person every day. The staff wiped water in the toilet while eating in the restaurant. The child wanted to take some bread. The waiter refused to let him take it away even though he could see other people holding the meat. We couldn’t tell whether he was allowed to take it or not. I saw the concierge helping others with their luggage and a cart. If he didn't get it for us, maybe he is a VIP? I really don’t understand why the service attitude in Shanghai is like this. The attitude of five-star hotels is not as good as that of small hotels outside. I will not choose Shangri-La in the future and will tell my friends.

This house can accommodate four people, because there is a sofa bed, the king bed is super big, and the room is accompanied by glass bottles of Evian water, nuts, potato chips, energy bars, and light beer. There are more than 10 kinds of water and drinks. The night view of the Bund is unobstructed. It is very comfortable to watch the boats on the river during the day. My husband and nephew slept in a room with a view of the Pearl Tower. The night view is also good
Breakfast: Line up, but the taste is authentic, Chinese style, Western style, Japanese sashimi, noodles, etc.
Horizon Club courtesy: When you arrive at the upgraded Horizon Club, the procedures are a bit slow, and you can wait for it
Service: good service
Swimming pool: very good, but a bit cold
The overall experience is very good, but the check-in price on Friday, Saturday and Sunday will be high. I don't think the usual price is very high. I will choose this place next time

You can also see the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Huangpu River ✌️, and there happened to be a room that was cleaned and checked us in early. The next day, there were many guests who did not agree to postpone the check-out until 2 p.m., but they also agreed to delay the check-out for more than half an hour, which is very humane! Just after checking in, there is a butler who adds WeChat to follow up the service at any time, and can reply to any questions in a timely manner. Click 👍 Overall, the service is very nice, and I will choose to stay next time

Service: The front desk service is good, but the attitude of some staff is very poor
After dinner, I came to the hotel and sat in the lobby for a while waiting for some of my friends.
People keep coming to ask me if I am a hotel guest.
There was also a staff member who kept staring at me with a 7-point threat and a 3-point homeless look.
I really think these actions are stupid
I think even strangers need to maintain a friendly attitude.
What's more, we are still customers and you are the service staff.

It's very convenient to get to the subway station. You don't need to take the big circular flyover, just cross the road and you will arrive at the Phase 2 of IFC, and turn around to get to the subway station. Will book this hotel next time

msg:If you take your children on a trip to Shanghai, of course you have to live in the Bund where there are many tall buildings.
The location of the hotel is excellent, the Oriental Pearl Tower, IFC Center, and the tallest building in Shanghai are just outside the door. If you want to go to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, you can go directly to the subway station. Compared with taking a taxi, children prefer the subway. In the evening, take the children out for a walk in Binjiang Park to see the Huangpu River up close.
The hotel's breakfast on the second floor is very rich in Chinese and Western food. The bread, donuts and candies as soon as you enter the door are sweet bombs for children.
The hotel has two buildings, Pujiang Road and Zijin Building. I understand that Pujiang Road is more suitable for viewing the Huangpu River, and Zijin Building is suitable for viewing city views, such as landmark buildings such as the Oriental Pearl Tower.
The most caring thing is that the little brother at the front desk even upgraded the river view room, the children took a nap at noon, and even applied for a two-hour delay for the check-out time, which is great!

msg:The Yangtze is a hotel with a long history, once known as the third largest hotel in the Far East. I spent four days and three nights here comfortably and happily. First of all, the transportation is very convenient. It is just a short distance from the subway entrance. There are sushi and Hong Kong and Cantonese tea restaurants downstairs. Next to Raffles City, watching movies and shopping worry free. When you step into the room, you can smell the fragrance of flowers. Although the facilities have some traces of history, you can see that they are well maintained. From the two aspects of cotton mop and bedding alone, the comfort level is better than that of Ritz-Carlton and Waldorf. Take a walk around Nanjing Road, take a bath when you come back, and lie alone on a 2-meter-high bed, not to mention how comfortable it is. The function of the terrace is almost useless, and there is no view. The breakfast is on the ninth floor. The dishes are slightly less, but the quality is relatively high. There are freshly made noodles, noodles, and wontons. The afternoon tea provided by the room was a bit embarrassing, three small pieces of watermelon, three small pieces of cantaloupe, and a mini egg tart. After sitting for 10 minutes, I hurried away.

Just when you registered at the front desk, the front desk told you: Sir, we will upgrade you for free. I quickly said thank you! As a result, I upgraded to a small room at the corner of the elevator entrance. The elevator went up and down there all night, and I hardly fell asleep. I felt really disgusting.

We lived in a super deluxe double room with a panoramic view of the Bund in the Horizon Club of the Zijin Building. The room was clean and tidy. It is very pleasant to see the river view through the large floor-to-ceiling windows. Especially at night, you can have a panoramic view of the entire Huangpu River. The breakfast is very rich, with both Chinese and Western dishes. When we arrived at the hotel, Ms. Milin warmly welcomed us and even carried us Luggage, I met the manager Lynn when we checked in. She helped us arrange a room with a very good view. I thank Lucy, Angie, and Nini joy Yuki for their various help to us. The overall experience of staying in the Horizon Club is also very good. Every time we come in and out, the manager Penny greets us warmly and takes us to a place with a good location. The coffee she makes is also very delicious. Chloe can remember our preferences, so we don't need to tell us later and serve us directly. The view of the Horizon Club is really great and highly recommended. You can see Lujiazui and the river at the same time. We experienced it in both directions. The children's homework needs to be done, and they also help us print it out. Forst will also chat with us, introduce many nearby attractions, recommend us to go, and help us book restaurants. A really satisfying stay experience. Next time I have a chance to go to Shanghai, I will definitely go back. Hope to see these wonderful staff again.

Apart from this, there is no problem, because the hotel has a special person to call to apologize for this matter. The attitude is very good, but I am also u1s1. The location of the hotel is very convenient, next to the Oriental Pearl Tower, Super Brand Plaza and Guojin, it is also very convenient to buy luxury goods. Check out the tennis court~perfect~

msg:Breakfast is not recommended. There are many varieties but the taste is very poor. The waiter is always in a hurry to collect the plates. There was no one to help open the door, and as long as the waiter was walking around, he wouldn't say hello. You have to queue for more than 20 minutes to check out. The reason is that there are only two staff at the front desk during peak periods, one is issuing invoices and the other is receiving foreign guests. There is no time to pay attention to other guests, and no one maintains order. You can jump in the queue when checking out. I would not recommend this hotel to my friends and family when they come to Shanghai.

msg:Let me talk about the background. I stayed at the Toy Story Hotel the day before, and I was very much looking forward to staying in Shangri-La the next day. But, I arrived around 13:30, and I was told that I needed to wait, and the room had not been cleaned. During this period, 2-3 groups of guests encountered this problem. In this case, they are all with children, and it can be seen that the guests are obviously unhappy. Well, the cleanliness after check-in is shown in the picture, the quilt core is exposed, I'm afraid we can't see how dirty the quilt core is, the bedside lamp is all dusty, and the kettle has been coated with pulp. . . In short, the hygiene of the hotel can be described as disgusting. After reporting to the front desk of the hotel, no decent staff came forward to solve the problem. Two room attendants came, carrying a plate of fruit, and wiped it as soon as they came, but it was not wiped clean. To help change the quilt core, the bloody quilt core was put directly on the bed and pressed on the child's clothes, I hurriedly asked her to go out to change it and then bring it in again. In short, this stay has no good impression at all, and I should never stay in any hotel related to Shangri-La in the future. Hotels can be old, but dirty really isn't an excuse. By the way, there is an inexplicable door in the room, is it a suite? But the door can't be opened, so, if you really don't care about the hotel, just block it. By the way, please wipe the windows too, it will dirty the view of the Huangpu River.

When I checked in, Lucy at the front desk gave me the relevant information about when to check out, whether breakfast is included, and the time and location of breakfast. Thanks to Rena Eve for connecting my phone to wifi in the lobby.
I booked a Horizon Club room, and the Horizon Club courtesy service is also very comfortable and in place. When I went to have afternoon tea, Kenny, the manager of the Horizon Club, served me with a smile and warmly called me by my name. It felt like home. I was not disappointed in the aspect of accommodation that I was most concerned about. Hot water came out quickly in the room, the bed was comfortable to sleep, the river view was wide and the view was good, and the location was excellent. It is also very convenient to order takeaway, and there is a takeaway cabinet downstairs that is safe and secure. It was a particularly good check-in experience. Thanks to Lynn, Joy, Betty, yuki, NiNi and Angie from the guest relations team. They helped me solve the problem in every detail during the stay. When I checked out, I met Ms. Milin and gave us a little fan Bear. Shangri-La's service is slowly getting better and better, which is obvious to all.

msg:I like the service of Shangri-La Hotel the most. Pudong Shangri-La is near the subway, and it is isolated from the Oriental Pearl Tower. After staying, you can visit the Oriental Pearl Sightseeing Tower.
This time we stayed in the Bund Room of Pujiang Building. As soon as we entered the room, we could already see the Bund of Shanghai. The scenery of day and night can be seen at a glance. It is a super value enjoyment, and the food is also diversified. You can enjoy the food without going out, just like Feel at home without leaving home!
The shower in the hotel is very satisfactory, but unfortunately the pillows are too soft for the elderly to get used to. It would be better if there are pillows with moderate hardness.

msg:Because the scenery of Shangri-La Hotel is good, I chose this hotel for the anniversary this time, and wanted to enjoy the scenery of Huangpu River. Check-in was a bit of a hassle, the order took a while. Fortunately, I met a reliable front desk to actively help with communication and coordination. The children were waiting anxiously. When the front desk learned that we were here for the anniversary, they immediately helped arrange a room upgrade for us so that we could get the room card immediately. They also coordinated for us to go out Contact the housekeeping depar**ent during lunch time to help us with the decoration. This kind of service awareness is really considerate, and it also eliminates some of my unhappiness. After entering the room, the view of the river and the Oriental Pearl Tower from the floor-to-ceiling windows is really pleasant. The room is large enough for children to run around and play. When we checked in, we also added WeChat to indicate that we can inform the guest relationship when we leave the room, and they will notify the housekeeping depar**ent to arrange it. The details are really thoughtful. When I went back at night, I was very satisfied with the layout of the room. Although it was just a simple embellishment, it didn’t cost money after all. They also prepared cakes, which the children said tasted very good. delicious. On the day of check-out, it was raining and asked if we could check out later, and it was arranged for us in a very humane manner. Lynn Lucy Milin Rena Kikyo Cara Nini from the guest relations team was really great, and thanks to Julia from the housekeeping depar**ent for helping me decorate my room so well. The whole stay experience is very satisfactory. Five-star hotels really rely on service to make word of mouth. Good service can cover up some other shortcomings. I will come to stay next time I have a chance.

The executive lounge trea**ent of the Horizon Club is the icing on the cake. The fried dough sticks and soy milk for breakfast are all local specialties in Shanghai. I haven't eaten these things for several years.

msg:I wanted to go to the newer Jing’an Shangri-La, but I chose to stay in Pudong Shangri-La based on the location of the Oriental Pearl Aquarium and the Huangpu River. The first feeling is that the hotel is very big, the lobby is very grand, and there is no end to a straight road. Angie who received us helped us with our luggage and led us to the front desk to check in. Ms. Lucy at the front desk saw that we brought the children and gave us pink teddy bears. The children were very happy. The room arranged for us was also great, with floor-to-ceiling glass windows for a panoramic view of the Huangpu River and the buildings of all nations on the opposite bank. The big bed was facing the river, and the children were so happy to see it lying on the bed. During the check-in, the guest relationship also added our WeChat, providing butler-style service during the stay, answering all questions and responding to requests. Lynn Milin Nini Rena Cara were really caring during their stay. There is also a children's playground on the 4th floor of the hotel. There are entertainment items such as ocean ball slides and gashapon machines for children to play. Miss Jane inside played with my daughter and was very patient. The daughter clamored that she wanted to play with sister Jane. There are two places for breakfast in the hotel. We tried both during our stay. Because the children don’t have much appetite and don’t eat much, so after the overall experience, we still choose the Horizon Club on the 29th floor. The view is good and the service is good. Especially the manager Penny is patient and considerate to the children. The Horizon Club is divided into two areas. In the sofa area, you can see the scenery of Lujiazui. If you walk a little further inside, there is a place where you can see the river. The happy hour here is very rich and can be used as dinner. The service is also very good. During the stay, Niall and Lebron could remember our preferences, greeted us kindly, and led us to the location that the children liked. Joy from guest relations the day before check-out also asked on WeChat whether he needed to arrange a car and issue an invoice in advance, and he provided services from the customer's point of view. On the second day, Bruno prepared the invoice and bill for us in advance. Yuki arranged a car to wait for us in the lobby, and sent the children balloons and lollipops to see us off. My daughter drank with us on the way back and said that next time I have a chance, I would like to stay in Shangri-La again, play with those young ladies, be gentle and give her gifts. Not only children, our stay experience is also very good. Except that the facilities are really a little old, everything else is perfect. Will recommend family and friends to stay in Shangri-La.

The breakfast is rich, but there are really a lot of people for breakfast on weekends. It is much better on weekdays, and the service will go up when there are fewer people. I am very grateful to the manager of the breakfast room, Manager Yan, for helping the children to pick up breakfast and sending the children to the Children's Paradise. Although Pudong Shangri-La mainly has a large number of people on business trips, it now also offers a lot of family packages. Since it has decided to cater to families, it still needs to do a good job in service like Manager Yan in the breakfast room. Otherwise, it will give people a feeling of wanting to earn this money, but also think that the family customer group is noisy with children, and it will give people a sense of twisting.

When we checked in that night, the bathroom in the room smelled faintly of urine. I thought it was coming from the toilet, so I boiled two pots of water and boiled it, then walked around in the lobby downstairs and came back. It still tastes good. I called the front desk and the waiter was very nice and immediately offered to change my room for me.
It was too late and very tired. The room will not be changed. Just arrange for a waiter to clean the bathroom again. But after cleaning, I still smell a faint smell of urine when I stand in front of the wash basin...
When I checked out the next day, I kindly told the front desk about the situation. There was no dissatisfaction or request. The handsome guy at the front desk was very nice and said he would give feedback and follow up. Half an hour later, their supervisor called and said they had brought the waiter to check and there was no smell of urine. . . When I answered the call, I was busy and didn't think about it. Later, I recalled that my supervisor said "I don't smell urine" on the phone. It seemed that I was blackmailing and looking for trouble. This service attitude is also too bad. After staying in so many hotels, this is the first time I smell this "urine smell". I mentioned this issue in a friendly manner, I just hope that the same thing will not happen to the next person who checks in.
The hotel's breakfast has good Chinese and Western products and is very cost-effective.

Check-in date: May 20
Price: 2885
advantage:
The location is excellent, just a 5-minute walk from Zhengda and just across the street from China International Finance Corp.
With executive benefits, you can check in directly on the 29th floor, which is very convenient because there are few people.
Children's bathrobe, slippers, toiletries and footrest provided
shortcoming:
Old facilities, dirty carpets, damaged shower heads
The breakfast is chaotic, the arrangement is chaotic, and there is very little variety
The children's play area on the 4th floor charges an additional 50 yuan/half hour. It's a little big... There are only a dozen free regional colored pens, and most of them don't have water... Compare the facilities in the paid area, 50 yuan for half an hour The price is simply weird... Most hotels offer free services better than this, right? If you don’t have the ability, don’t create a children’s play area.
Someone rang the doorbell in the morning and asked if she needed to wash the clothes, and she was told that she didn't. About an hour later, when my daughter was sleeping, someone rang the doorbell again. There was no urgent response, and she actually swiped the door card and came in. I asked who it was and if I needed to wash the clothes...
The hotel's courier asked me to leave the things I bought at the Disney store at the concierge and called SF Express. I placed two bags and only sent one bag to me... I was really surprised to receive it when I got home. My daughter Keep asking me why the toys haven’t arrived
From check-in to departure, the overall experience was very bad, which overturned my understanding of Shangri-La. Now that the hotel industry is so busy, it can be considered an old-style high-end hotel. If you just perfunctory because of your geographical location and there are no guests, it will decline sooner or later. of.

The afternoon tea in the lounge and the night view of the Bund were very beautiful, and we had a very satisfying day!
When we checked out the next day, Kikyo and Rena took the initiative to help us introduce the surrounding attractions and commuting methods.
I have stayed in a total of six Shangri-La hotels in four countries. Pudong Shangri-La's service is the best and it makes me feel like home. I will definitely choose Shangri-La again next time!

They also specially arranged for me a location where I can see the river, and I was very satisfied with a breakfast. The overall stay is very satisfactory, and I will live in the one with the executive lounge when I live in Shangri-La in the future. The whole experience is also good. I am very grateful to the three managers Ken Lynn Penny and Chloe Rena Chris Nini for their responsive butler services during their stay. I will recommend family and friends to stay in this Shangri-La. Hope to maintain this level of service.

msg:It was a very amazing experience
First of all, I would like to thank Penny at the Horizon Club on the 29th floor of the hotel for causing us a lot of trouble because of our personal reasons. She always greeted us with a smile and helped us solve them professionally. Aiden at the concierge offered to help with luggage.
Lucy, who checked in, was kind and recommended the Horizon Club room, which has a good view and good service. Guest Relations Lynn Rena Yuki Aimee Nini paid close attention to our needs during the stay, made restaurant reservations for us, and contacted the concierge to book a car for us. Shangri-La makes everyone feel the love and hospitality everywhere. Every employee who comes into contact with you smiles and solves everything for you. It makes us feel natural and considerate. We feel at home. I want to say that what you do is much better than the promotional videos
Although the decoration of the hotel room is a little old-fashioned, it is very clean and tidy. The breakfast is also very rich. There are still many activities in the hotel, so that everyone will not feel so boring. A very satisfactory stay experience. Thanks to the staff at Shangri-la for their professional service.

What surprised me the most is that the hotel has a free parking lot. I am really happy. The breakfast is on the 2nd floor of the hotel. There are various types. It is divided into two areas, Chinese food and Western food. It is very convenient to travel around the hotel. It is also very close to the subway. You can watch the Huangpu River from the hotel. It is especially recommended to watch the scenery at night. It is really beautiful. When you enter the hotel, you will have a concierge The younger brother helped us with the luggage, and the younger sister from the guest relations team solved various problems for us in a timely manner. The check-in at the front desk was very fast, which saved me a lot of time. All in all, it was a good experience. Many thanks to Lynn Milin Joy Rena Jean for their service.

msg:The Shangri-La Hotel is really big, the lobby is super grand, the hotel has two buildings connected by the lobby, and there are many types of rooms. This time I took my family out for the holidays. Fortunately, Penny who checked in recommended us a room suitable for us, which made us very satisfied with our stay. The double room type room is big and has a good view. You can also go to the executive lounge to experience the service and view. The elderly at home are very satisfied. The service at the Horizon Club Lounge is really considerate and meticulous. Thanks to Ciel Vicky Chloe frost for taking care of us during our stay. We lived comfortably and ate well. The guest relations team is also very good during the stay. They will answer and provide assistance as soon as possible if there are any questions or needs during the stay. Next to the hotel is Binjiang. It is really comfortable for the elderly to go for a walk after eating. The check-out also prepared an invoice for us in advance according to our needs, so as to prevent us from queuing up in the lobby with the elderly. Thanks to Jimmy Lynn Angie Joy from Guest Relations. I am really very satisfied with this stay. The old man in the family said that next time we have time, we will bring them to check in and enjoy it. A big thank you to these wonderful staff at Shangri-La for their excellent service.

msg:I want to take the children out to play a few times during the holidays. I am optimistic that I chose Pudong Shangri-La. I was mentally prepared to queue everywhere, but it exceeded expectations. Entering the hotel lobby, the smell is very good. There are railings in the lobby, and the staff are maintaining the team in an orderly manner. Seeing that I brought my children to tell me that I can go to the 2F to check in, and I can rest and provide drinks. We went to the second floor to check in. Milin who received us not only gave us balloons and small toys, but also poured coffee and orange juice for us, and the whole experience went up. The manager Lynn who checked us in, communicated with us very kindly and finally recommended us a room with an executive lounge. The room was also arranged very well for us, and finally he thoughtfully arranged a late check-out for us. During the stay, guest relations can also be added to WeChat to provide help at any time. After going to the room, my daughter was very satisfied with a large floor-to-ceiling glass window. You can lie on the bed and watch the entire Bund view opposite, which is great. Afternoon tea, we went to the executive lounge to experience it. Penny who received us was very nice. He saw that we brought our children to coordinate a seat by the window for us to sit. The executive lounge is good, with good service and a good view. Manager Pan introduced that we can go to two places for breakfast on the second day. After learning about the differences between the two places with our guest relations colleagues, we finally decided to go to the second floor. The breakfast is really rich, but too many people affect the experience somewhat. . The overall stay is really satisfactory. Shangri-La dispelled my worries about taking children out on holidays. Thanks again to Carl Lynn Milin Penny Chris for their help during our stay. Very satisfied.

msg:Traveling has to be a big-name hotel service like Shangri-La to be reliable. The service has not been greatly reduced due to the busy holidays. And it also fully reflects the thoughtful holiday response measures. Let’s talk about the check-in procedure first. There was a queue at the front desk when we checked in. As expected, we were very cooperative and waited slowly in the queue. The service staff in the lobby will come over to ask if you need to wait on the second floor when you bring your children with you. Regional processing, we declined because it was almost in line, and they went to get water and toys for us, which really reflects the professionalism of a five-star hotel. Let’s talk about the staff who checked us in, because we still really want a twin room with our children, and the room is too tight to coordinate during the holidays. We are also ready to squeeze. Who knows, this young lady is very patient to help us. After all kinds of communication and coordination, we finally arranged a highest floor, the 28th floor. The heart is simply satisfied. The colleague who completed the check-in guest relations added WeChat, and can provide any assistance during the check-in. After entering the room, the overall white decoration style is clean and tidy. The layout of the room is also very large, and the view from the window is great. The hygiene of the room is also very good. There are many kinds of breakfast, but there are too many people. Queue lack of management, messy. Fortunately, the lady who checked in reminded us to go early, otherwise we would have to eat in the corridor. The overall stay experience is good. Thank you Lynn Aimee Milin Chris Rena Penny for their service and assistance during our stay. see you next time~

The surrounding area is very close to the subway station and shopping malls, making travel very convenient. Service: The service is even better. Jinxuan at the front desk checks in quickly and professionally, and will arrange the room according to the needs of the guests. Give us an upgraded room. The floor-to-ceiling glass windows in the room have an absolutely wide view. During the stay, the guest relations team Lynn Rena Nini Aimee provided timely assistance, and the missing items in the room were delivered in time. During the stay, they also recommended a lot of interesting places to us, and they helped to solve the problem of the hotel ordering phone. The overall stay experience was really great. The children's center on the 4F of the hotel is also very fun. There are ocean balls and claw machines. My daughter had a great time playing. It feels especially suitable for walking babies. Soak in the hotel for a day to free your hands. Miss Kitty from the children's center patiently played with the children. It's great~ especially if there are things left in the check-out room, I contact guest relations and help to send them back. Shangri-La's thoughtful service is really great.

Children are not as interested in the park as they are to the Bund, but she is very happy to stay in a hotel and see the Huangpu River. During the May Day holiday, we stayed in Puxi for two nights and Pudong for one night. Shangri-La Hotel is a very good choice 1. Convenient transportation 2. The three-piece suite in Pudong and the Oriental Pearl TV Tower are within easy reach 3. The night view of the Huangpu River
Next time I come to this hotel, I will stay in this hotel again. This time I live in the new building downstairs and go back to the old building to experience it.

msg:Shanghai Pudong Shangri-La has two buildings, the old Pujiang Building near the river, and the new Zijin Building. I booked the Pujiang Building, which is relatively old overall, and the room size is not large, but the facilities are complete and the hygiene is good. I read in the comments that there are more than 1,000 rooms, and the decoration is similar to those of those guest houses. To be honest, compared with the new hotel, it feels a bit like this, but the sanitation is acceptable, and the breakfast is rich, which is very characteristic of Shangri-La.

Toothbrushes, shower gel, etc. are also worthy of improvement by the hotel...
The breakfast is rich and worthy of praise, but the attitude of a thin, short, and ear-cut male waiter in black clothes is very bad (at 4.30, he serves orange juice and apple juice in the area diagonally opposite to the orange juice and apple juice in the right diagonal 4-seat area). He is really a "mouse" ****"!
The view of the location is nothing to say, excellent.

When checking in, there is also a guest relations team that can provide services at any time, check in and lead us to the room. We needed a few more bottles of water when we checked in, and they quickly responded to our needs and delivered them to the room quickly. During the check-in process, a car needs to be booked, and they also actively help the concierge to communicate and coordinate. Thanks to the team Lynn Chris Joy Angie for their help and thoughtful service. In addition, the hotel's breakfast is also worthy of praise, it is simply too rich. There is everything you need in Chinese and Western food, and you can eat as much as you want. Checking out is also very convenient. You can return the room card to the guest relations without an invoice, and they will arrange the front desk to assist you in checking out. Because this business trip needs to be reimbursed, they also prepared an invoice for us in advance to reduce our waiting time for check-out. Pudong Shangri-La is worthy of praise and recommendation regardless of its location or staff service.

The hotel manager Kenny helped to introduce the shopping at the opposite IFC, and the Super Brand Plaza next to it is basically a one-stop shop for shopping and eating. It is only a five-minute walk from the riverside. Metro Line 2 and Line 14 are very close. It is really the first choice for travel. In a city with Shangri-La Hotel, it is basically our best choice. It can be said to be a habit or a preference, and it has a sense of belonging. Love it as always.

msg:Pudong Shangri-La has been in Shanghai for many years. Although Shanghai has opened many hotel brands, I always think Shangri-La is very good!
Nancy, the front desk partner who checked in, was enthusiastic and professional. It was great to observe the guests from the corner of the eye when registering information 👍🏻 and she is an intern! The aunt in the guest room also greeted me warmly when passing by! Although Mandarin is not very standard!

Facilities: The room facilities are good, clean and tidy, and the view from the window is also great! Compared with some newly opened hotels in the past two years, there must be some deficiencies in some places, but the foundation is still there! So the facilities are great!

Sanitation: Sanitation conditions throughout the sanitation road are five-star!

Environment: The environment maintains a consistent character!

Service: Rich breakfast, good welcome service! There is still a lot of room for improvement in the in-meal service. There is less enthusiasm and greetings, and the dishes are collected by machines! Randomly ask where the gym is, and I don’t know where it is, and I can’t think of it from Shangri-La! There are few management staff in the restaurant and there is no enthusiasm for customers. It is possible that I just went to the Michelin restaurant next door the night before to make a comparison! The male expatriate gro on the first floor and the passing black-clothed logistics staff had their job number plates out of alignment, and looked at the situation without smiling. This point can actually be learned by the staff of the International Financial Mall. The passenger flow of people in a day is higher than that of hotels. many! Compared with the previous Beijing International Trade Center and Chengdu Shangri-La, I have a better impression!
Overall very good, good service at the front desk! The entire superior 9 location, will come again next time!

Their service is considerate and thoughtful. We lived on the 22nd floor and could see the Huangpu River. The scenery was incredible. Shangri-La's hygiene is very satisfactory to me. I can't say that every corner is clean, but the places I passed by were kept extremely clean and the details were well done. Breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner are sumptuous and delicious, and the desserts are the ones that stick in my heart. Okay, no more writing, just know how to choose.

msg:It was the first time for a three-year-old boy to travel far in his life, so he decided to bring him to Shanghai to see the world and celebrate his birthday. After looking at several hotels, I finally decided on Pudong Shangri-La. I originally wanted to choose a room with a big mouth monkey theme in Pujiang Building, but later found that the Pu Xiaoxiang theme room in Zijin Building was also good, and the price was cheaper, so I stayed for two nights🛌

📍Location:
When I booked at the beginning, I mainly took a fancy to the prime location where the hotel is located, on the banks of the Huangpu River and in the center of Lujiazui~
✨Cross the road and you can go to Super Brand Plaza and IFC for shopping and eating, and to play in the Oriental Pearl Tower and Ocean Aquarium. Just walk a few steps on the flyover, and you can see the famous "three-piece suit" downstairs when you look up at the hotel
✨Direct access to Metro Line 2 and Line 14, close to the bus station, the traffic is very convenient

🍀Services:
From the beginning of the booking, it was a very smooth and comfortable experience, all the way to leaving Shanghai. The hotel's facilities are very new, and the service is a plus. I have checked in other high-end hotels in Shanghai before, but it is no exaggeration to say that this is the first time I have "feeling like home"~
✨Conversed by phone in advance, hoping to live in a higher room with a better view, and then want to add an extra bed, all these requirements have been taken care of, thank you❤️
✨Knowing that the baby is going to have a birthday, I specially arranged a birthday cake❤️
✨The lady at the front desk, Lara, is very patient and gentle, and helped to check in in advance❤️
✨When I checked in, I gave the baby a small balloon toy, and arranged for a special staff to bring it to the room❤️
✨The communication with the guest relations team was smooth during the stay, all kinds of help to answer questions, Milin, Rena, Lili and the manager Lynn worked very efficiently❤️
✨When I left and returned to the hotel, I was warmly greeted by Uncle Andrew at the door❤️
✨The eldest sister of the room service made the room very clean, and greeted you kindly when you go out in the morning❤️

🏨Room:
Pu Xiaoxiang-themed Zijin Building Super Deluxe Queen Room. We were arranged on the 16th floor (the highest floor of this room type), near the southeast corner, room 1659～
✨The room is very large, facing the Huangpu River, with beautiful scenery. Although there is a Pujiang building in front, it is far away (from the room) and not directly in front, which does not affect the view at all😍
✨A 1.98-meter bed and a 1.5-meter sofa bed. The big bed is soft and very comfortable to sleep on. The sofa bed should be a mosaic bed, it is relatively hard and has gaps, and it wakes up as soon as you turn over😅
✨Whether the central air conditioner is turned on or not, the indoor temperature is basically constant at 22-3 degrees, and I sweat under the quilt at night. But it’s not too cool to wear a piece of clothing to rest in the room during the day 😄
✨The room is relatively dry. I measured it with my own temperature and humidity meter and found that it was less than 20%. Contact the hotel quickly and ask for a humidifier. The humidifier was delivered in a short while👍But it seems that this humidifier has not worked for hundreds of years, and the whole body has mold and white spots. It took me more than half an hour to simply clean it before it can barely be used😅
✨Free mineral water is provided, pure joy. The boiled water in the hotel has a strange smell. In the past two days, we both drank mineral water, so the consumption is relatively large~ The hotel immediately replenished it after seeing it🤝
✨In the bathroom, children’s toiletries, footstools and bathing toys are thoughtfully prepared. Even the faucet is covered with cute little crocodiles. The baby is clamoring to wash his hands and take a bath every day😂
✨The Wi-Fi in the room is very powerful, and it is not difficult to watch videos and play games
✨ There is room service, looked at the menu and it didn't suit me. It’s more convenient to order takeaway when you’re hungry. There’s a takeaway counter on the right side of the gate. The takeaway guy is very helpful. I ordered supper for two days in a row🤪
✨The Pu Xiaoxiang baby doll prepared by the hotel in advance likes it very much. She hugs it during the day and even sleeps with it at night☺️

🍜 Breakfast:
The room includes breakfast, which can be eaten at Yi Cafe on the second floor. The breakfast time is very long from 6:00 to 10:30. I basically go down around 8:30. There are too many people, so finding a seat depends on luck~
✨Breakfast is rich in variety, divided into three parts according to the type of food: hot dishes, cold dishes and beverage areas
✨The hot food area is mainly some traditional breakfasts. Porridge, steamed buns, noodles, scones, casserole, fried rice, soy milk, etc. There are quite a lot of people who eat them. There are also side dishes such as grilled sausages, vegetables and eggs. Add a little, it is a nutritious and appetizing meal😋
✨There are some Japanese food and bread in the cold food area, (because I’m full) I didn’t go to see it, I don’t know how it is, but the big brother at the next table should taste pretty good😋
✨The beverage area is freshly squeezed juice, milk and coffee. Drinking grapefruit mixed with pineapple and hot milk for two days, I can’t stop feeling 😋
✨There are many waiters in the restaurant, and they actively provide children's tableware for the baby (the baby chair is too crowded to sit, which is more suitable for babies). The closing is also very diligent. On the morning of the check-out day, I just took a bowl of noodles and put them on the seat. I went to wait for pancakes. When I came back, I found that the noodles were gone 😅

🎠Recreational facilities:
The one suitable for preschool children is the K20 playground on the second floor of Pujiang Building. After playing for half an hour, the baby clamored to go back to the room, saying that it was still fun in the room😅
✨Pu Xiaoxiang Theme Room includes K20 Amu*****t Park admission ticket, the face price is 50 per ticket, the front desk gave a total of 4 tickets, and actually used 1 ticket
✨Go to play after 6pm, no one is there
✨It is said to be a playground, but it is actually a room-sized place, with climbing mats, plastic wooden horses, big caterpillars, ocean balls piled up all over the floor, and some sports facilities such as slides and trampolines
✨There are several claw machines and toy tables outside the room, which are charged separately
✨Adults cannot enter the ocean ball and slide area, they can only watch from outside

📣Summary:
1⃣️Easy to travel
2⃣️Beautiful landscape
3⃣️The room is clean and comfortable, full of childlike fun, with a wide view
4⃣️First-class service level and high service efficiency
5⃣️ Eating and drinking taste good
6⃣️ High cost performance
This time I lived in Zijin Building, next time I hope to have the opportunity to visit another Pujiang Building🥰

msg:1. The hotel is strategically located in the center of Lujiazui near the Huangpu River. The hotel rooms have good city and river views. The decoration facilities are old, but the maintenance of the facilities is pretty good. It is recommended to install a small table for mobile phones in the bathroom. It should not be expensive. It should be at least a little more humane. If it is a 5-star hotel, it should not be high to put a box of napkins on the washing table. The hotel service is basically non-existent and has nothing to do with 5 stars. The ladies at the front desk didn't have much smiles, so they only asked and answered questions. When checking out, they ask if the invoice is issued by the platform or the hotel, and they impatiently ask you to queue up, pretending that they are busy, and ignore you no matter how you ask. I guess they think the salary is low and they don't do it as much as they like.

msg:The price is 1,948 per night, and I live on the 5th floor (the former marketing depar**ent office was renovated, and the signage has not been removed). The hygienic condition of the room is worrying. 1. There was discarded toilet paper next to the toilet in the bathroom and it was not cleaned. After calling customer service, they immediately came to re-sterilize and send it to the customer. Plenty of fruit. 2. When I came back from an evening trip and prepared to take a shower, I opened the shower room and found a ball of hair at the sink (at this time, I had to wonder whether the bathroom had been cleaned after the last round of guests left). It was very late and I was too lazy to ask customer service to just rinse it. For a moment. 3. The only hotel I have ever stayed in does not have tea bags and coffee bags, let alone fruit snacks when you enter the door. Paper towels are only provided in the bathroom, not in the room area. 4. The reviews say that the breakfast is very rich. Maybe my room price in 1948 is low configuration, so the breakfast is very cheap. There is not even cup yogurt. The other meals are also very low. There are not many varieties. It is 3-star standard at most. ! In short, I didn’t expect it to be such a Shangri-La. Even the children said they were disappointed!

msg:I came back to Pudong Shangri-La again after two years because the previous stays were arranged by Manager Wang, and my family and I also liked the location and convenience. This time our family has two rooms on the 11th floor of the Pujiang Building, facing the Huangpu River. This time, the room should not be arranged by Manager Wang in advance, so the scenery on the lower floor is of course no problem, but I will roughly describe the experience in the hotel for 45,000 days this time.
Because the hardware of the Pujiang Building is aging, first of all, there is basically no sound insulation. During these four nights, it was difficult to fall asleep before 2:00 am every day. I don’t know if it’s from upstairs or from the next door. The beeps can be heard clearly, which means that the sound insulation has reached the extreme. The second is that the hardware is too old. When I flush the toilet in my room, I have to close the cover. If you have requirements for the hardware, it is recommended to choose the Zijin Building. At least the sound insulation is okay. The only thing I think the hardware is better than the Zijin Building is that the mattress is soft and comfortable. If the sound insulation is not so bad, I think I should be able to sleep well every night...
Let’s talk about the soft service. At breakfast on the first day, there was a girl in a blue shirt. In the area where milk was served, a female employee who spoke Shanghainese was loudly educating another young employee. I think breakfast is okay. Everyone has a different opinion. I think it’s not bad. I want to pack some fruit. The waiter offered to provide bags. It’s really not easy for these low-level waiters. The next day at breakfast, a female employee in a black suit was wearing a mask and coughing at us until I was there. After reporting the room number, she coughed. I thought it was time to get a seat, and she said "inside, please." ... It's too rude. The breakfast on the third day may be due to the holiday. There are too many guests. We arrived at about 10:00. very speechless
Do you think this is the end? wrong! This is just a small part of the scariest place. This is also the place where I was shocked and unbelievable when I returned to Shangri-La after two years! During the four nights and five days we were in the hotel there was not a single staff member! Yes not one! None of the staff will take the initiative to say hello to the guests when they see them! Not even a hello! This is the most incomprehensible and "scary" thing we feel. For example, we entered the hotel from the lobby of the Zijin Building and walked back to the Pujiang Building. It rained at night and we were wet with big shopping bags. The concierge just stared at you. It is like a pillar there, and it will never come to give you any help, not even a single word of greeting, just staring at you like ****, and the women at the front desk are walking around in the lobby, arrogant and majestic. The eyes are all on the top of the head. I don’t understand the most basic way of hospitality. I don’t have any education and quality. I just walk past the guests with my head held high. There are no rules. Seeing the flattering smiles of foreign guests from my compatriots makes me feel extremely heartbroken. There are also two female staff members in black suits in the elevator. Watching the guests enter the elevator with hostility, don't say hello, if I hadn't lost my temper now, I would have thought X. The scariest thing about them is that none of the employees would greet the guests even if they said hello during the four nights and five days. It's really cumbersome to stand there without those old concierges wearing red clothes. I don't understand what role such old staff (at least 70 years old) can play for guests? The few scenes I saw were chatting loudly with the driver in Shanghai dialect at the entrance of the lobby, or holding the guest's phone and yelling at the driver who didn't know the location of the hotel... It was all done by these elderly concierges out of things! I have only seen this kind of situation in Shanghai! Extremely wonderful! Very strange. Is caring for the elderly? There's absolutely no reason to hire these ******! In the whole hotel, I feel that it is normal for Manager Wang and the cleaning lady to deliver a razor, and it takes three consecutive phone calls for an hour before it is delivered. This is something that I can’t understand. It shouldn’t be. Appeared in Shangri-La and came back to read the reviews of Qiantan. It’s a mess. I feel that all the employees are very unhappy at work. In Hu Ritian, there are no senior leaders to manage seriously and pass on these incompetent hostility to the guests. The good location and brand are really ruined by these people. After two years, I came back after two years and rely on the superior location to eat "old money" with the Shangri-La brand. From the inside to the outside, from top to bottom, it is a mess for the current Pudong Shangri-La. The best compliment is that I stayed in Hong Kong for a long time last year because of the epidemic. The professional ethics and professionalism of the hotel service staff in Hong Kong really need to be studied. It feels good to check out today. A young man in blue in the lobby came up to help us Take the luggage to the garage for us. The grassroots employees of this store are really good. I want to praise them. In addition, I would like to say something that everyone understands in their hearts. The locals in Shanghai are really not very suitable for the service industry. The inferiority complex and self-confidence in their bones are contradictory. The so-called sense of superiority It's gone. The management really needs to reflect on it! w

Opposite the hotel is the Super Brand Plaza next to the International Financial Center, so you don't have to worry about eating and shopping. The famous attractions of Oriental Pearl Tower and Aquarium are also within walking distance. You can also take a walk to the riverside to have a look. Traveling is really convenient. Especially the row of restaurants next to the riverside is comfortable to watch the sunset and have a cup of coffee and wine at night. [Facilities] It has everything that a five-star hotel should have, but it is relatively old, but the maintenance is not bad. The lobby is very stylish, connected on both sides, spacious, bright, clean and decent. [Hygiene] The cleaning is very clean, and the sister in the room is also very enthusiastic, and will greet you kindly when you meet in the corridor. [Service] The service is the biggest highlight of this stay. The front desk staff provided professional services from the customer's point of view. When the hotel arrived at 4:00 pm, the reserved room type had not been cleaned up and immediately arranged another room for me. , better than what I booked myself, and the staff explained the reason to me very clearly. The colleague who completed the guest relations during the check-in process also led me to the room. I added WeChat to contact them if I needed it during the stay. In the end, after washing my hair at night, I found that there was no comb. The customer service center was busy, so I asked if they could send a comb, and it was delivered to my room within five minutes. It turns out that they added WeChat to provide high-quality services to guests👍 On the day of check-out, they also asked if they needed to issue an invoice and arrange a car in advance. Really professional and thoughtful. Afterwards, there will be a return visit to ask how the check-in experience was. A real big thank you to Lynn Rena Chris from guest relations and Jimmy who checked me in for their professional service. It makes me feel good about the Shangri-La brand.

The service was originally five-star, but now one star has been deducted three times and four times to urge me to give a five-star review. I know very well that the staff has no choice but to do this, but I want to criticize the boss who formulated this KPI. I don’t know which VP came up with it. Yes, guests are constantly being disturbed after they leave the hotel. At the same time, they push guest reviews and take screenshots to send to the housekeeper. This incident goes against Shangri-La's brand purpose and completely ruins the hotel's goodwill. It makes people lament that a long-established and good hotel has fallen to this point.
I fully understand the importance of ratings to hotels, but please take care of your feathers.

msg:Besides the location next to IFC, what are the other advantages? I ordered coffee and tea in the lobby bar. The quality of the tea is very poor. Is this quality sold in five-star hotels? Are you blindly pursuing the results of GDP? I suggest the general manager to try it out. When booking a room, the picture on Ctrip has a river view. When the front desk checked in, it said there was no room with a river view, and immediately asked why the room type had a picture with a river view. , I was told that it was released by Ctrip, does Ctrip take the blame? Needless to say inside the room, look at the picture, the equipment and facilities are all old hotels. In the afternoon, a big sister came to deliver fruits, and the big sister who opened the door handed me three fruits with bare hands. Where is the service standard so tough? This is the first time I have seen it , The washbasin in the room is not connected to the water, and the beeping sound can't go down the water. I always feel that there are countless hairs clogged in it, and the nausea follows. The doors of the shower room and the toilet are closed very loudly. I am really worried that the glass will be shaken. It was broken, and there was rumbling at night. I don’t know what the noise was. It was very noisy. I walked from the Zijin Building and wanted to go to Guangzhou on the second floor for dinner. I asked the staff at the entrance of the Chinese restaurant on the first floor how to get to the second floor. I then pointed in the direction of the Zijin Building, and told that the elevator next to the Chinese restaurant on the first floor was not connected to the second floor. We walked a long way, and then asked the boy who looked like a concierge, and was told that the elevator was next to the Chinese restaurant, and we were taken back Go to Guangzhou Zhou on the second floor. Is it because Guangzhou Zhou on the second floor robbed the Chinese food business on the first floor, or the staff just don’t know anything about the product, or we asked the wrong person, and I’m not in the mood for this tossing, so I barely stayed. I decisively checked out one night, but I couldn’t find a luggage bag in the whole room. This is the second Shangri-La room that doesn’t have a luggage bag. I don’t know if I asked for one from the concierge or the front desk. I asked the Shangri-La Group that the room is not suitable now. Luggage bag? In the end, the young man gave me a blank look and didn’t say a word. What else does a hotel with no hardware or software have besides the advantage of its location?

msg:It should be said that the hotel experience this time was very bad and very unpleasant. I spent 2,180.31 RMB per night, but what I got was being fooled by the hotel and a very unpleasant stay.
First of all, we have stayed here 4-5 times and have a basic understanding of the room types here. I stayed for 2 nights in total this time. I bought a river view room in Pujiang Building for ¥1655.72 on September 14th, and a deluxe bund view room in Pujiang Building on September 24th for ¥2180.31.
There was no problem on the 14th. I stayed in whatever room I booked, half facing the Oriental Tower and looking sideways at the Huangpu River.
The big problem came on the 24th. When I checked into the room, what I encountered was a pre-designed trap and a wonderfully rehe****d performance. The girl named Summer served us. She told us that the room she arranged for us was half facing the Oriental Tower and half facing the Pujiang River (she was deliberately testing the customer, but she didn’t need to tell the customer. The room would be the one the customer booked), because We had the impression that we had booked a room facing the Bund, so we told her that we had booked a room with a view of the Bund. If there was any room available, she said no. Then she said, help us look for it (to make the customer feel that she is helping the customer, her acting skills are very good) and said that there is a room 626, and she even said "enthusiastically" that she could take us to see it (this way to torment the customer), we looked, because Tired and late, I agreed.
After moving in, I found that the facilities and supplies were relatively old and felt damp. Something didn't feel right, so I looked through our order, and it was indeed: Deluxe Bund View Building. In order to avoid making a mistake, I went to Ctrip's official website to check. Indeed, the picture is facing the Bund, not half facing the Pearl Tower and half facing the Pujiang River. I also found that there were many houses of the same model for sale that night. The more I thought about it, the angrier I became. I felt that I had been fooled by Miss Summer and the hotel. I contacted the front desk and admitted that the 6th floor was the worst room of its type. Indeed, there is nothing "luxurious" about it. The front desk asked the manager and transferred us to 2727.
Room 2727 was quite satisfactory, but we had to pack up our luggage and move to the 27th floor, and we were afraid of losing things in a hurry. It also made us feel like it was a cause for trouble. After struggling for several hours, I no longer wanted to stay happily. I wanted to take a cruise on the Pujiang River that night, but I happily went to the airport the next day, but I didn’t take the cruise.
The most important thing is that we spent money (¥2180.31/night), but the hotel did not give us the room that it should have provided. It created a big trap to trick the customers and asked the customers to thank them. That is not right. It is inappropriate and unethical to cause so much trouble and loss to customers. No matter how clever Miss Summer is, a lie will always be a lie and it is impossible to cover up the truth.
If the hotel insists that half facing the Oriental Pearl Tower and half facing the Pujiang River is also a "deluxe Bund view room" (this is the excuse the hotel gave us this time), then the hotel should put such a photo instead of the Bund view picture now, otherwise it is " "misleading", misleading customers. It is illegal both internationally and domestically.
I hope Pudong Shangri-La Hotel can treat customers sincerely. Hotels can fool customers, but customers can also not come.

msg:I stayed at the company's annual meeting a long time ago. The hotel is next to the Huangpu River. You can see the hotel directly when walking along the riverside, so the view should be very good. I really want to experience the river view room, so I did not hesitate to book this room when I brought my children to Disneyland this time. You can park for free when staying in the hotel. The parking lot is not big, but if the hotel is full, the hotel will reimburse the hotel guests, which is very humane. But it is much more convenient to find a parking space and park at the hotel with children. The check-in counter comes up from the garage. The front desk service is very good. I took my children and told me to arrange a river view with the best view. After checking in, I learned that the room I lived in was on the other side. The front desk asked the welcoming girl to lead me to the room and added WeChat, telling me that I could contact guest relations if I had any questions during my stay. After adding it, they sent me a WeChat message, introducing how to connect the Wi-Fi to the hotel facilities, which is very good. When I checked in, the front desk said too much and I really couldn't remember it. The first feeling after entering the room is that it is so beautiful. The children are very happy to watch the river and boats. The room is quite satisfactory, but the decoration style is a bit old-fashioned. Later, Baidu checked that it has been in business for more than 20 years, and it is actually well maintained. After a short rest, I decided to have dinner at the hotel. Because I brought the children who wanted to eat something lighter, the guest relations recommended Huaiyang cuisine on the first floor and helped to reserve a place. The dishes are exquisite and delicious. But the price is not cheap. It takes only five minutes to walk to the Binjiang River at night, and the other side of the Huangpu River at night is another feeling. very beautiful. The next day we planned to go to Disney to stay there for one night, so we checked out early. Guest Relations arranged a taxi for us in advance, and gave toys to the children to welcome us back next time. I will definitely come back next time, the stay is so comfortable and satisfactory. I would really like to thank the guest relations team for their excellent service during this stay, Lynn Milin Chris Kitty Ann. Looking forward to seeing you next time.

The toilet has not been cleaned and there are stains left by the previous guest. I didn’t expect such an expensive hotel. , why is the price difference in service? It’s too low. Overall, the price is high and the service is average. I will not stay at Shangri-La with the same price next time! ! !

msg:I took the children out for a stroll on the weekend, and chose to drive to Shanghai to have fun. It happened to be a tour of the Oriental Pearl Disney. After doing a bit of strategy, I chose Pudong Shangri-La. The geographical location is adjacent to the Oriental Pearl Metro Station, so it is convenient to travel. There are many room types on Ctrip, so you can book one with a reasonable price, and the parking fee is free when you stay in the hotel. Go to the front desk to check in. I saw that we brought children a room recommended to see the Huangpu River, but my son said that he wanted to see the Oriental Pearl Tower. Jasmine at the front desk immediately said that he would arrange one for us to satisfy the child's wish. We were checking in, and the welcome in the lobby gave lollipops and small gifts. I can check in with peace of mind when the children are quiet in an instant. When I went to the room, my son was so happy, jumping up and down was very happy. Although the white tone of the room is old, it is clean and looks very comfortable. The supporting facilities of shopping malls and restaurants around the hotel are really as mentioned on the Internet, and many are very convenient. Check out directly on the day of going to Disney, there are a bit too many people, there will be a receptionist in the lobby asking if you need an invoice, if you don’t need an invoice, she will arrange to check out later so that we can avoid queuing. After checking out, I received a text message from the hotel informing me that the deposit has been refunded. Very explainable. very satisfied. Thank you to the ladies in the lobby, Lynn Grace Lili Angie, for their warm, thoughtful and professional service.

msg:I have great trust in the brand of Shangri-La Group. If there is Shangri-La when traveling, it must be my first choice. This is the first time I live in Pudong, Shanghai. There are many Shangri-Las in Shanghai. After comprehensively planning the route for this trip, I finally chose Pudong Xiang, which opened the earliest. The first impression when you check in is that the lobby is very large, and the familiar fragrance is very elegant. The hotel seemed very busy. The welcoming lady said that because there was a team checking in, there was a queue for a while, but the lady was guiding the guests to check-in at the counter in an orderly manner, busy but not chaotic. After all, it is a large-scale hotel. Response in order. The procedure was very fast, and the front desk was very skilled. They said that they had arranged for me a room with a panoramic view of the Bund, which had the best view among the room types I booked. I couldn't help but secretly pleased. Going to the room, it really has the best view, and the river view is very upright, and you can see it. There is no trace of occlusion outside the window to directly watch the entire Bund and Huangpu River scenery. Really great. Breakfast is in the cafeteria on the 2nd floor. You can book a room with breakfast included in the refund. More than 10 stalls to choose from. You don't have to eat it after lunch. Before leaving, I asked if I could take a cup of coffee, and I kindly brought me a disposable cup. The service is really good. After check-out, the guest relations team also called back to inquire about the check-in experience. This is done very well, and we can understand what happened during the guest's stay and improve it. This approach is recommended. But this time I am very satisfied. Special thanks to Bruno Lynn Milin Aimee for taking care of me during my stay.

msg:Facilities: The transportation is convenient, and there is a subway station not long after going out. Take three stops to the Science and Technology Museum. In the most prosperous place in Pudong District. Opposite is the International Financial Center, next door is Lujiazui Binjiang Park, and next to it is Lujiazui Super Brand Plaza. It takes less than five minutes to walk one stop to the tourist center.

Environment: The gate is not very grand, I can't believe it when I pass by. Narrow and small, probably an old hotel, right? The location is great. The underground garage is relatively narrow, and the location inside is very compact.
There are two old hotels. I booked the slightly better Pujiang Building. Two days of cloudy and hazy days, we chose the Oriental Pearl Tower. When the sun was shining in the third day of junior high school, her son took a photo with her. really good 😄

Service: The service is ok 😊 Said to give a small doll as a gift, but found that the hotel did not prepare it. Immediately contact the front desk, and she will bring it right away, and there are indeed a few slippers, all of which satisfy consumers one by one. Ha ha
There are too many queues on the first day of the new year, which is surprising.


Hygiene: not bad


Children's breakfast: I bought it separately, because I didn't look at the package when I placed the order. Neglect and children's breakfast. Two days later. The buffet price is worthy of the quality of Shangri-La Hotel. The quality is higher than many five-star ones, at least it deserves its name. Son's favorite assor**ent of donuts and expensive cheese. Although bluefin cheese is smelly, he picks expensive cheese with great taste. The boss said roughly that it stinks and is not good to eat.
What I am most satisfied with is that there are all kinds of dishes, pastries and breads are available in miniature, so that I can try them all to satisfy my appetite and my little bird stomach.

K20 Amusement Park play voucher 100 yuan: gift, my son chose the karting club. Small but interesting helmet equipped well.

One Pu Xiaoxiang limited doll toy: very cute, delicate little pillow Pu Xiaoxiang.
The service location and quality are basically right for this discounted price. The room is a bit small, but the rest are pretty good. The best thing is that I can visit several famous scenic spots and go to Guojin to taste some delicious food.

msg:In my impression, Shangri-La is a business-oriented hotel. Later, I saw some in-person rooms and parent-child activities on Ctrip, so I wanted to experience it. There were a few twists and turns from booking to check-in, but fortunately, we were able to live in the room type we wanted in the end. Special thanks to the manager Jimmy for his flexibility to meet the needs of the guests. The lobby of the hotel is spacious and stylish, clean and a**ospheric. As far as the eye can see, the lobby and front desk staff warmly greet the guests coming and going, and work hard to help guests solve their needs. The scenery that greets the eyes after entering the room is really unique. There is no obstruction to the view at all. You can directly see the Huangpu River and the Bund. The film is like an oil painting. The children were so happy to check. The matching layout of the themed room is also in place, which adds to the childlike fun. The children are so happy that they don't want to check out, and they say they will stay again next time. In the afternoon, I entertained my friends and went to the lobby bar for coffee. The overall service was very good. If I could see the river from a higher height, it would be even more perfect. The breakfast is very rich, with many varieties and good taste. What I am most satisfied with is the high-quality service provided by the guest relations team during the stay, responsive to every request, and all kinds of questions can be answered and resolved in a timely manner. Thanks to Lynn Aimee Milin Grace for their professionalism and thoughtfulness.

After checking in and entering the room, they introduced the hotel's facilities and restaurants, asked if they needed to book a car on the day of check-out, and issued invoices and luggage in advance. Special thanks to team Lynn Jimmy Grace Rena Angie. The food in the breakfast room is very rich, and the breakfast room is so big that you basically don't need to eat lunch after eating. The hotel concierge service is also good. They can help to receive the courier and send it to the room. During the check-in, I asked how to get to the places to visit, and would considerately help to print the map. I also patiently handwritten which subway station to take and how to transfer. The check-out speed at the front desk is also very fast. If you don't need to issue an invoice, you can leave after returning the room card, and the deposit will be refunded quickly. Very satisfying stay experience. I will also Amway to experience such high-quality services for my friends and family around me.

msg:Really rubbish hotel with bad rooms and bad service! I’m really annoyed that I rarely leave reviews! I stayed in a double room for the first night for two nights. I booked two rooms for the second night, one with a twin bed and one with a king bed. I checked out the room from the previous night around 12 noon and checked in the two rooms on the same day. As a result, the twin room smelled weird (like mold + smoke). My friend couldn't stand it and wanted to leave, so we went downstairs to check out the double bed (we didn't go to the double room). We checked out the room card and the front desk said in ten minutes. After a while, the security deposit and room fee were refunded, and then I went out. I called Ctrip at the front desk of the hotel to cancel the security deposit. I took it immediately. As a result, when I checked out the next day, I didn't notice it at first. I just left the hotel. I didn’t refund enough money, so I asked Ctrip to refund the security deposit. Ctrip said that the hotel refused when I checked out, but I didn’t receive any phone calls or reminders from both parties. Ctrip and the hotel called N times before refunding the security deposit. I’m really convinced who this belongs to. negligence? What I don’t understand the most is that I’ve been to Shanghai so many times and your hotel is the best. You have to pay once to book a room with Ctrip. The hotel also has to add money and a deposit. I can’t even refund the money. Are you sick? Also, the service at the door of your hotel is terrible. The doorman didn't even pick up the luggage and made a bad face. Then the hotel staff in the lobby asked her something and ignored her to chat with foreigners? Does your hotel specifically serve foreigners? Don’t you treat our countrymen as human beings? What a rubbish hotel to stay in for the last time! ! !

msg:Taking into account the entire travel plan, I chose Shangri-La, which has a more suitable geographical location. Call the hotel before check-in to see if early check-in can be arranged because the flight is relatively early. The front desk solved my problem satisfactorily. Let me talk about some good points: 1) When I entered the hotel lobby, the welcoming lady came up to greet me quickly and guided me to check in. The front desk had to accommodate my birthday during my stay, and I found a guest relations colleague who said he could prepare a cake for me , and recommend a room that suits my requirements. 2) During the stay, I used the VIP lounge on the 29th floor. The view and service are very good. The happy hour is highly recommended. Those who have a small appetite can deal with it as a dinner. You can go to the VIP lounge all day, which is quite good. 3) The scenery is as shown in the picture, the floor-to-ceiling windows have a wide view, and you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower and the river view. You can enjoy the two scenic spots in Shanghai directly in the room, which is great. 4) During check-in, Lynn Lili Grace Rena Milin Chris, the guest relations team, helped me solve many problems, and helped me book a restaurant and arrange laundry delivery. The service was really good. Respond to every request. 5) The hotel is within walking distance of Line 2, Line 14, the riverside, and the Oriental Pearl Oceanarium. 6) On the day of check-out, the guest relations asked if they needed to arrange a car and take luggage, and they did it very well from beginning to end. There is really nothing wrong with choosing Shangri-La this time. Will come back again in the future.

msg:Except for the location, this hotel really has no merit. There is a male receptionist named Peter at the front desk. How can I put it, he may have misunderstood the front desk. His attitude is not like the front desk of the hotel, but like the leaders of government agencies and enterprises. Ask him to handle the matter. When checking in, it depends on his face. He is scolding his colleagues while checking in, and has an attitude of "I just don't have a room, what do you want to do with me". The whole front desk is a mess. Let's replace this kind of front desk as soon as possible. Anyway, the service is just that, so just lower your expectations, but the view and location are really nice. I also felt that the little girl in red clothes who was waiting outside didn't understand what I asked. She didn't know anything after asking three questions. In fact, the hotel can train its employees well before coming out.

The water in the shower room in the bathroom is slow, and it is blocked after taking a shower for a while. You have to stop and wait for the water to go down before you dare to wash. The breakfast was great and plentiful. Check-in at noon is that there are too few waiters, and the waiting time is a bit long, but check-out is fast. If you don’t issue an invoice, you can just give the room card to the front desk. It's just that there is no welcome fruit in the room, and the drink is only mineral water. It feels too simple. Now when you stay in a hotel, you basically have welcome fruit or snacks. You go for the brand and location!

I went to the front desk to queue up for check-in. I queued for 20 minutes and no one checked in. The check-in was slow. The front desk employee Lin Haotianju had a look on his face that he couldn't help but shocked me! It's really unlucky to encounter such an unreasonable front desk. When I checked in, I didn't have a room and I couldn't talk to anyone. I felt like I would slap the table and curse if I asked any more questions. I wonder if this is the service quality that the front desk of a five-star hotel should have. , does anyone still dare to go to such a service?

msg:It is an old five-star hotel with good facilities and environment, but there are obvious signs of aging in the room, but this is normal. Since I booked a Horizon Club room, I stayed in the Executive Lounge on the 29th floor. The service in the executive lounge is really good, which is to be commended. The food in the executive lounge is quite satisfactory, but there are few people and quiet, and the view is not bad.

The river view is not bad. After all, the price/performance ratio is relatively high. The room only costs 2,000 yuan to enjoy the panoramic view of the Bund. The scenery is still beautiful. The cleaning aunt of the room service is also very friendly, the service is considerate and polite, which is worthy of praise.

It's a pity that the service quality of Yi Cafe the next morning, I didn't plan to go to the executive lounge for breakfast at the beginning, I went to the Yi Cafe restaurant downstairs, but there were so many people, there were plates everywhere that I didn't have time to take away Occupying a seat is a very bad experience. (But I can feel that the waiters are working very hard and have been cleaning up, but there are too few people, and it is still a problem at the management level.) I found a seat but did not bring other things with me, so I could only use the room card to occupy the seat. I did not expect to take it After returning from the meal, the card was confiscated. When I reported the problem to the restaurant manager, I asked if I had misremembered the seat... I left a very bad impression. In the end, the room card was returned to me without a word of apology. This is quite disappointing. It is recommended that if you have the conditions of the executive lounge, go to the executive lounge for breakfast. Although the variety is not as good as that on the second floor, the restaurant on the second floor is really overcrowded, messy, and the experience is not good.

I will still consider staying in Shanghai next time, but please improve the service of the hotel, otherwise it will really affect the reputation.

The breakfast room is super old-fashioned and you have to press it all the time to release the air. It’s crowded and noisy. The quality is poor and there’s not much to eat. If you bring a child, you need to pay for the child’s breakfast. The InterContinental Banyan Tree, W, Marriott and even Sofitel do not require it.

During the check-in process, there was no concierge or lobby service staff. I brought my children from Disney alone. I bought a lot of dolls, and there was no concierge to help me with large and small bags. It was Wednesday, and there were not many customers. Three people were at the front desk, two people were checking in, and one person had no customers. Very speechless. . . Later, a man greeted me to check in, and the overall service was still online. The Pujiang Building is the one near the Huangpu River. The facilities are a bit old, but the sanitation is okay. The biggest advantage is the good location, the north gate is opposite to the main gate, the east gate crosses the road to the IFC, and through the IFC is the center of Shanghai. There is a western restaurant on Fucheng Road downstairs and my favorite Chunzai. It's really convenient to go anywhere.
I went to Guojin to buy things, and I walked down the Ritz-Kelton lobby. The concierge at the side door opened the door in time and asked if I needed help to deliver the things to the room. If there is no comparison in one detail, there is no good or bad. They are all old-fashioned five-star listings. , Service level is the most powerful competitive weapon!

msg:Bad review. For a hotel at this price, the level of service and sanitation is really an eye-opener. I stayed for four days and three nights. On the first day I went in, I found a black hair hanging on the front of the towel, not hair, it was disgusting. The anti-collision ball behind the bathroom door was broken on the first day and fell on the bathroom floor, but it remained in place until check-out. It can be seen that no one cleaned it for four days. The area around the toilet is also extremely dirty, mold, stains, garbage... It's unexpected for a five-star hotel to do this. Ctrip included two services (hereinafter referred to as A and B) when booking a room. When I checked in, it said that it would take time to prepare additional services, which made me wait for 20 minutes before picking up the room card. Later, A was indeed arranged in the room, so I thought B is already in the room card, and you can directly swipe the room card when you consume it, but when you use it, you are told that you need to go to the check-in office at the front desk to get it again. Why isn't it all done together while the check-in waits? The attitude of the front desk staff is still very bad. After the first inquiry, they said that they did not purchase this service, and then argued that I was also helping you. I'm sorry, this is your job, and it's your job that didn't do a good job, not your doing good deeds and helping me.

During this period, I heard another guest preparing a birthday cake or something at the front desk. The refrigerator in the room broke down because it was not cooling overnight. When the service staff found out, they felt very perfunctory. What’s even more scary is that the room is full of bugs, including the wardrobe, bathroom, and roof. Those who don’t like bugs are welcome to stay🙈

Bustling city, green nature, what will happen when these two collide? Recently, I came across an "urban oasis" hidden in the landmark circle in Shanghai, the magic city. Shanghai Pudong Shangri-La combines the two. One side is the bustling city, and the other side is the intention of nature. The hotel endows the city with a new style and unlocks a new way of vacation. Here, you encounter an ultimate experience of freedom and leisure.

Serve:
Thank you, Manager Chi, the beauty on duty at the front desk for quickly solving the problem, and thank you for your recommendation, which brought me many surprises during my stay.
Room facilities:
The room is quiet and allows me to have a good rest comfortably.

health:
clean

Room view:
The suite on the 14th floor can have a panoramic view of the Huangpu River.

Location traffic:
There is nothing more convenient than here, the parking lot 🅿️ is convenient.

msg:I checked in again after a year, and I feel that the hotel is still very busy. However, the service and scenery of the hotel are worth visiting again and again, especially the lobby layout is large and grand, definitely full of the style of a five-star hotel. Let’s talk about the service again. There are very good guidance from entering the door to checking in. The girl in the lobby, Milin, greets the guests and sends gifts to the children. The first impression is very good. The room arranged by Lynn at the front desk is very satisfactory, and a suitable room will be reasonably arranged according to the occupancy needs. When it comes to breakfast, there are really many varieties, but it's a pity that I don't have two stomachs, and the plates are collected very quickly. The most surprising and lingering thing is the children's play center on the 2nd floor, which has more ocean ball slides than before, which is really an excellent choice for children. Kitty is very nice and guides children to do handwork. There are often some children's courses that can be signed up from time to time. It is highly recommended to stay with children.

msg:Rumors #Speaking the truth
1. Bringing a one-and-a-half-year-old baby to check in, the front desk did not ask for extra breakfast fees. When reading the reviews, I saw that a one-year-old baby was asked to pay for meals.
2. The front desk did not collect a deposit of 10,000 yuan. In addition to the room fee, the deposit was less than 1,000 yuan. It is the same in other cities. Looking at the reviews, the deposit of 10,000 yuan is scary
3. The front desk did not have a bad attitude. I booked a river view bed at the beginning. I called the front desk in the morning to help lock a room facing the Huangpu River. The front desk attitude was very good and very enthusiastic. 1828, there is no room on the other floors, 28, after arriving at the hotel, I really don’t want to stay on the 18th. There is a Huangpu River on the 21st floor of the Deluxe Pavilion. It costs 530 yuan to upgrade. The Deluxe Pavilion can be purchased because you can eat three meals. Only the afternoon tea is simple. The evening meal is the same as breakfast. You can make a full meal, so the extra money is worth it.
4. There is no parking fee. I checked in on February 1st. There are two underground floors, 1 and 2, and one floor on the ground.
5. The room is not very old. Although it is not a new hotel, it is well maintained. Whether you live alone or book it for a friend, it is enough. It is not a house purchase, so no one will go to the corners. The large area is enough and the lobby is also grand.
Because I want to see the Huangpu River and the Three-piece Suite and the Pearl Tower, if living in Puxi is too expensive, then I choose to live near the Three-piece Suite. I can see the river and go downstairs to take pictures of the Three-piece Suite. The Deluxe Room of the hotel can see the panoramic view of the Pearl Tower. In short, I am very satisfied. Don't upgrade to Zijin Building. Don't upgrade for free because Pujiang Building has the best view of the river. Zijin Building is not much new and is blocked by Pujiang Building. Personally, I recommend living in Pujiang Building.

msg:The Shangri-La Hotel is really big. There are two buildings. After doing some homework, I said that the Pujiang Building has a good view and has a children's center. So I booked in the Pujiang Building. The hotel lobby is super stylish, and the first feeling when entering is that there is no wrong choice. When I met Lynn, the front desk employee, she was also very warmly received. Knowing that we were staying with children, he arranged a room with a very good view for us. The hotel's cafeteria is also very large, with many choices and everything you need. Hotel guests use the gym and swimming pool for free. I take my baby to play in the middle of childhood, and the father of the child can pass the time by exercising, which is really suitable for parent-child travel. The next thing is that I checked out in a hurry and did not issue an invoice. Nancy is also very good. She added WeChat and followed up until I received the invoice. The hotel's services and facilities are worthy of staying.

msg:As a hotel under the Shangri-La brand, located in the diamond location of Lujiazui, its current level of management and management really requires introspection and review. Don’t talk about anything else, let’s just talk about this “bed”
Generally, the time in the room does not exceed 12 hours and 8 hours in the bed, so the bed is the most important facility. It was obvious that the middle of the bed had collapsed and lacked sufficient support. I would like to ask the owner and hotel management company, do you replace old mattresses according to Shangri-La's standards? Is it because my income is too low during the epidemic that I have postponed replacing my mattress? When a guest suffers from back pain in bed, do you think it is just a matter of customer dissatisfaction? No, this is anger against Shangri-La. Is this how you ruin the Shangri-La brand?
You should, first, inspect all mattresses in the hotel throughout the year and replace all unqualified mattresses.
Second, you should interview 500 customers on-site, give 500 free nights as gifts, and find the 50 problems that the hotel needs to solve most.
Third, you should review and reflect on why the hotel cannot receive the best room rates despite being in the best location. Don't mention that the hotel is old. The British Savoy is much older than you. There are many older hotels in Europe and the United States, and the prices are just as good. It is necessary to formulate a plan to improve and transform the hotel throughout the three years to truly become a first-class hotel and charge first-class room rates.
Good medicine tastes bitter. It is hoped that Ctrip will not disclose any relevant personal information.

msg:An old-fashioned hotel, the view is absolutely top-notch in Shanghai, with a sweeping view of the Pujiang River, and Jinmao and the financial center can be seen from the bathroom. The level of service is first class and almost flawless. The Japanese restaurant supporting the hotel looks very small, but the food is very fresh and tastes great. On the contrary, the expected parent-child facilities and buffet breakfast are disappointing. The breakfast is nothing to eat, and there is no highlight at all. There is no cup in the place where the milk is received. I was told to go all the way to the bar to get the cup (not that there should be wherever you need it) Is it?) There is no Shanghai scallion oil noodles, and scallion pancakes are also Western-style, not old Shanghai. The so-called parent-child amu*****t facilities are just a few inflatable castles, so don't expect them at all. In addition, the facilities are too old, and they are not checked at any time. On the first day of check-in, we found that the electric curtains were broken. After a long time of repair, we couldn't fix it, so we changed the room. After changing the room, I found that the coffee machine in the room was broken... I hope that the hotel will confirm the integrity of the basic facilities before the guests check in. Since they want to provide them in the room, they must ensure that they are easy to use, instead of relying on the professionalism of the waiters spirit to make up for. By the way, I would like to give a thumbs up to all the service staff, from the doorman to the front desk to the operator to the delivery staff to the cleaning lady, many locals in Shanghai, they are well served and very polite, which is the face of Shanghai I am familiar with. So I give it five stars overall, and I still recommend staying here.

In addition, the package offers a 100 yuan children's playground coupon. After staying for two days, I bought two packages but only got one coupon for the same room. I think it is a bit unreasonable... The hotel is divided into Pujiang Building and Zijin Building. Zijin Building is updated, but It is said that the lake view of Pujiang Building is better. The location of the hotel is very good, next to Super Brand Plaza, opposite to Binjiang Park, many coffee shops, western restaurants, and Lebanese restaurants haha. The Oriental Pearl Tower, Pudong Art Museum, Shanghai Center, etc. are within walking distance.

msg:Very bad experience. I took my child to Shanghai during the Spring Festival and booked a Bund panoramic room for 1770 per night for a total of 3 nights. Because there were two adults and one child who needed an extra bed, Ctrip Hotel's children's policy was that extra beds were free for children under 12 years old. When I arrived at the Shangri-La front desk, I was told that there were few people checking in on the 3rd floor (this hotel is a place where all kinds of shady things are led to the dark), and then an arrogant woman said in a tough manner that we didn't have free extra beds here, and it would cost 408 per night, and the extra beds were all used up, and there were none now! Then we were given this room, the view is as shown in the picture, obviously not the Bund panoramic view... No one mentioned the price difference? I asked twice to change to a panoramic view if there was a room, but the front desk did not take the initiative to contact me from beginning to end, and said there was no better room when I asked. The next day, someone else asked if there was an extra bed, and was surprised that there was no one yesterday? A child's bed was added quickly, but it insisted that we would charge for it. Before checking out, I contacted Ctrip to coordinate, and the hotel changed its words and charged according to the order details. If the order was free, there would be no charge. It was really speechless. Do five-star old hotels have to ** everywhere? As for the hotel, it is good in location, but the room is small, the facilities are old, the air conditioner is noisy and inefficient, the ventilation is not good, the worst thing is the 255 breakfast, there are many people during the Spring Festival and we were asked to eat on the 3rd floor, the canteen is the same, the Chinese is ok, the Western is just some small sausages and small bread, nothing good. This hotel is too bad, it seriously affects the impression of the brand, I will not come again.

1. The response from the room service was very slow. I asked for an extra pair of slippers, but it was not delivered after about two hours. We met the cleaning staff in the corridor and asked for it.
2. Breakfast has been recommending us to go to the third floor, saying that there are few people and the varieties are exactly the same, but we went to the third floor for the first time. To be honest, it is not even up to the standard of four-star hotels in other places. There are few varieties, and most of them are repeated. Fried dumplings Cold, no automatic coffee machine, only capsule coffee machine, etc. very poor.
3. It is the most speechless. I stayed in the hotel for two nights and spent 10,000 yuan. When I checked out, the car was wiped. The main reason is that there is a car parked in the no-parking area, but the hotel parking management is negligent, and the owner of the car is not notified to leave, making it difficult for guests entering and leaving the area to pass.
The so-called parking manager on duty has an indifferent attitude, doesn't know what to ask, and responds slowly. As soon as the processing staff comes up and asks you how much you want to claim, you should call the police. Excuse me, this is your hotel's responsibility, okay? !
In the end, the car owner arrived, and he was not bad, and confirmed that it was their fault and negotiated to resolve it. but! ! The hotel parking management did not have any staff to apologize to us and admit that our management was negligent. We just blindly asked us to turn the blame on the car owner and cleared our responsibility. How can such a service attitude be convincing? Maybe the business is too good, and it doesn't matter.
This Shangri-La software is terrible! !

The first thing I felt when I arrived at the hotel was how big it was [blushing] Lynn who checked in arranged a room with a view of the river, and kindly sent us to the side where we checked in, only to find out that there are two buildings in the hotel. I was very happy with my stay and decided to stay another night instead of changing hotels. Sean extended our stay and recommended nearby restaurants. great~

It's very convenient to travel around the hotel. It's also very close to the subway. You can watch the Huangpu River and the Oriental Pearl Tower from the hotel. It's especially recommended to watch the scenery at night. It's really beautiful. When you enter the hotel, you can see it There is a concierge brother to help with luggage, and I can quickly solve any needs. I am very grateful to Milin and Ms. Lana for their enthusiastic guidance. Jimmy at the front desk checked in very quickly, which saved me a lot of time. All in all, it was a good experience.

msg:There was an incident during check-in, which resulted in a bad impression of the hotel. When I checked into the hotel at around three o'clock that afternoon, I was told that only the lower floors were available. The other rooms had not been cleaned up yet. I had no choice but to agree because I had a baby with me. I had no choice but to wait any longer. As a result When I went to bed at night, there was a lot of noise outside and I couldn't fall asleep. I called the hotel customer service and told them to change a room, but they didn't tell me that they changed to a small room. They only said that they would change from a big bed room to a small bed room, so at 12 o'clock at night It took half an hour for the new room card to be delivered to me after I had to push twice. At 12:30 in the middle of the night, I packed up the gifts and took my baby to change rooms. The new room was half the size of the room I booked! I was helpless because it was too late and I could only go to bed and solve the problem the next day. I got up early the next day and called the hotel to ask for the reason again. I explained it. It took more than half an hour for someone to call me back and solve the problem. I changed to a room of the same size that I booked before. I originally booked the hotel for three days. In the end, I stayed in the hotel for two days and left early with my baby. As an old five-star hotel, the service really needs to be improved. I was very dissatisfied with my stay. I stayed in a smaller room than I booked, but when I checked out, the room fee was still the same as the larger room. I was speechless. I didn’t bother with the hotel about the room fee even with my baby. I will never stay here again.
The price of breakfast in the hotel is really not low. Dinner closes at 10:30. When I went there at 10 o'clock, there was nothing to eat, and the waiters had already started to take away the meal! ! First time encountering such a thing.

The suite we booked was initially told that it was not available yet, and then they asked us to go up to the 21st floor to wait. When we got to the 21st floor, the receptionist's service attitude was not very positive. If we arrived first, they would give priority to the two people who arrived later than us. We are foreigners, and we received each other for half an hour, but left us aside in the cold. Isn’t this the same as being flattering to foreigners? ? Then, out of desperation, we went to the lobby on the ground floor to check in. We felt like we were being tricked! Moreover, during the application process, they did not tell us what free items the hotel had to enjoy, so they just gave us the room card and finished the matter! Oh, it was a complete mess. I will never come again next time!

The breakfast quality is good, but the dining experience is not very good. Do hotel service staff have salary disputes or are they dissatisfied with their pay? In short, I feel that the service attitude is not very good. Not only is it unenthusiastic, it is simply cold. The cleaning lady has the best attitude, but everyone else's attitude is very bad. On the third day, I moved to the Ritz Carlton and my attitude was much better. Probably won't stay here again.

msg:The location is superior, the transportation is convenient, and there are all the facilities that a luxury hotel should have, but if you want to see the river view, you can't see it in the ordinary Pujiang building rooms. It may be New Year's Day this time, and I didn't give a free upgrade, which is a bit regrettable. But in fact, I have stayed at the Banyan Tree Hotel and enjoyed the river view before, and it is not bad to see the city view from the other side this time. When I was a child, I always felt that the Bund in Shanghai is not just high-rise buildings, there is nothing to see, so it is better to go to the distance to see the magnificent mountains and rivers. After working now, I gradually discovered that the high-rise buildings in Shanghai are not only jungles of steel and concrete, but also gorgeous and luxurious. In fact, the scenery has not changed, but people's mood has changed. How many people can keep their original intentions consistently? May we not get lost~

msg:Nearly two thousand yuan was spent to arrange a hotel room that we were proud of in the 1980s. It was said that it had a river view, which really felt like bullying a child in the mountains. The big and tall Pujiang Tower in front was blocking the front and it was very depressing. There are air conditioners in many hotels downstairs. The big runner of the central air conditioner in the National Financial Center is constantly spinning and emitting water vapor to cool down. You can hear it clearly in the room, and the noise is really loud. The child felt very disappointed. He originally booked a two-day stay, but early the next morning he discussed with the manager about checking out and leaving, and was given a delayed swim. I like this. But the room charge for the next day has not been refunded to my account yet. Generally speaking, the hotel lobby is very grand and intimidating. As soon as you go upstairs, you are transported back to the 1980s. Very low value for money. The scenery is also very low, the price/performance ratio is still Jing'an Shangri-La, and then I decided to go to Jinmao.

msg:I have to fly to Pudong Airport the next day, and I booked a restaurant on the Bund at night, so I chose an old-brand hotel in Lujiazui. I usually choose a new online celebrity check-in hotel when I experience hotels. This time, I hope to experience the services of old-brand hotels during the epidemic. , Is it more in line with our needs?
The hotel houses have matching parking spaces. Friends who drive can directly drive to the underground parking lot. After checking in, give the car number and room number to the concierge depar**ent, and you can enter and exit unlimited parking for the day.
Because it was the peak of the epidemic, many service staff could not go to work. The hotel temporarily closed the counter of one of the two buildings. It took a distance to walk in between, but the service staff had a very good attitude. In addition to actively communicating and apologizing, they also helped us with our work The improvement of the room type allows us to face the river view directly. The river view can be said to be very good. It is recommended that you do not have to choose a high-rise room, but you must choose a room type with a river view.
It was my wife's birthday. Although the hotel couldn't make special birthday arrangements, they kindly gave us a small cake. Because we had to go out, we asked the hotel to deliver the cake to the room later, and the hotel also assisted in solving the problem. The room also sent a bottle of red wine and a large plate of fresh fruit, and the refrigerator drink bar is also available for free. It is a pity that there is no fruit knife and bottle opener for drinking, which is a little inconvenient.
After all, the decoration of the room is an old brand, and there is nothing special about it, but the toilet and bathroom are very clean, and the bed is also very comfortable. The river view is very popular. The fly in the oin**ent is that the window was cleaned the next morning, but there is a window in the hotel room. I think the notification in advance is also the reason why the waiter can help us upgrade the room type. Generally speaking, it does not cause too much trouble.
There are a lot of breakfast dishes, including Chinese, Western, and Japanese self-service and freshly cooked hot food. The coffee is relatively average, and there are various juices to choose from. What is slightly dissatisfied is that the service staff in the restaurant can see that they are temporarily on duty due to the epidemic. , when we ate porridge that smelled of burnt bottom of the pot, we kindly reminded the waiter to change it, but the waiter hesitated and couldn’t answer, and didn’t do anything about it, such as changing it or reminding the infield, just hiding away and continuing to clean up Desktop, but because it is an epidemic, I think it is understandable.
Generally speaking, the services of established hotels are satisfactory except for the shortage of manpower caused by the epidemic. Thank you for the enthusiasm and dedication of the service staff, and I recommend it to everyone!

I asked the front desk why this happened, and the feedback I received was that I am busy checking in now and will get back to me later. There has been no call back until today. Do guests who have already checked in not need service? at last! Because the room card was invalid and I was too late to return the power bank, I asked the waiter to return it for me, but it was not returned at all. Today I received a message about the unpaid charge. I can't believe such poor service is provided by a five-star hotel.

msg:The check-in experience was very poor. The air conditioner in the room was freezing. The sink was broken. There was no hot water in the shower room. The bed was very hard. The hotel called to negotiate. Everyone had different opinions and couldn't do what they said. He also said not to give negative reviews as it would have an impact on the hotel’s occupancy rate! A hotel like this costs 3,100 yuan for two rooms. It’s really not worth it. It’s not as good as the hardware facilities of a fast hotel! I have stayed in Shanghai many times and such a hotel really makes me speechless! The hotel manager's service attitude is also very bad! He said that there was nothing wrong with his hotel and it was me who was looking for trouble! I was really speechless. I didn’t want to complain at first, but later I saw how angry they were when they spoke. I really don’t recommend staying in a hotel like this.

msg:[Breakfast is very poor] Shangri-La has a good location, but it is not enough to offset the poor breakfast. I will not come again. From the variety of dishes, to the quality of the dishes, to the layout of the restaurant, to the quality of the waiters, everything about the breakfast does not meet the 5-star standard. It is obvious that there is no management at all here. Example 1. Entering the restaurant on the morning of May 31st was like entering a deserted place. No one checked your card, no one greeted you, and no one prepared the tableware. Example 2. A waiter said to the chef making carrot cake that some people reported that the carrot cake was not delicious. It's cool, heat it up a little, the chef said, there's nothing I can do, and then he put the already a little mushy carrot cake back in the oil for frying. As you can imagine, the carrot cake became black and mushy in large areas, and it was like this two mornings; Example 3: A customer’s plate was taken away before he finished his meal, causing the customer to get angry and waste time getting the meal again. Then, while my child was still eating, he was asked if the tableware could be taken away. It can be seen that the waiter did not make it clear. The guidance of the restaurant is all based on intuition; for example 4, the basic pastries, bread, cereals, fish and meat of the 5-star hotel are not available; for example 5, the restaurant layout is messy and the environment is dim, giving people a strong sense of crampedness. Breakfast can empower you or speed up your consumption, and this is the latter.

After all, the hardware facilities are not good, and the sanitary condition is worrying. Thick dust can be wiped off the table. , the corners of the drawers are full of dust, it has lost its reputation as a Shangri-La hotel. I stayed there often before, so the management is to blame. I probably have no interest in staying here again for the time being.

Does the guest not need the right to know if the occupancy situation has changed? After all, I came here for the panoramic river view room! What does it mean to me to change the room to be bigger than the original one? Speechless 😓

Before I left, I asked the restaurant waiter for a bag to bring with me two small pieces of bread and two apples. One of the waiters firmly said no, and I told them My room comes with two breakfasts, so why can't I bring a little bit with me? The waiter stopped talking and gave me a paper bag. A lady with short hair came up and told me that if I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it. She also said that it couldn't be done here. I said why can't I have two breakfasts? Her attitude was very indifferent. I glanced at her and she said arrogantly that you don't need to look, I am the restaurant manager and my name is Panni (I don't know if I wrote it right). We are Chinese here. It seems that she doesn’t need a Chinese name. She is too arrogant. This breakfast is really disgusting. Is this how a five-star established hotel treats its regular guests? I stay here every time I go to Shanghai all year round. I don’t meet many people like this. I would like to ask you why you treat guests like this! ***! It’s too scary😱Don’t say it’s right, even if it’s inappropriate, you shouldn’t treat guests like this! This self-proclaimed restaurant manager Panni, are you worthy of being a manager? The service is not bad, but extremely bad!

msg:first,
We express our strongest condemnation and dissatisfaction with the behavior of the duty manager Amber (female) in threatening guests:
1) I stayed in the Zijin Tower Executive King Room of Pudong Shangri-La Hotel for four nights on November 9, 2022. Because the place for storing items in the hotel’s shower room is too small, I ended up with a bottle of toiletries that I bought for several hundred yuan a bottle. It fell and was broken. In addition, the portable shower and overhead shower in the shower room were not good and very inhumane. Taking a bath was torture, torture, torture, not enjoyment. So, after complaining, I was moved to a king-bed room in the Pujiang Building, and the front desk staff said: Mr. Chen, your subsequent rooms will be at the original price without any additional charges. It is considered an upgrade (actually, the Ctrip price is only less than
100 yuan), like this, I stayed in the hotel for eight days.
2) Suddenly at 3:58 pm on the 15th, the Amber room duty manager called me and said: Mr. Chen, you want to move out. I asked: Why, she said because all the double bed rooms were booked out, and there were no rooms left. I gave you a room, but I said there were too many things in my room and it was inconvenient to move. She said it was okay not to move, but she wanted to come to the front desk to add money. I said yes, and she would pay for the hundreds of dollars worth of broken toiletries. Just give it to me (later I added the price on Ctrip when I renewed my room).
I express my strong condemnation and dissatisfaction with the Amber room duty manager who told lies and threatened guests. How come Shangri-La Hotel has such a manager! !!!!
3) There is a manager at the front desk (male, the fatter one), the one wearing a gold key suit. The service is very good. This should be praised.

msg:After staying there, I checked the reviews of several five-star hotels in Pudong, and it turns out that Pudong Shangri-La has the most negative reviews with more than 300. Far above other hotels. It can only be said that the eyes of the masses are discerning! This hotel is horrible, from top to bottom, up to the black dress female manager of the Horizon Club, the front desk manager, Ms. Zhao, the front desk duty manager, down to every member of the front desk. They all have the same characteristic, wrangling, prevarication, and never solving the problem to the end. And the most important thing is that they are full of lies, each person tells the same thing, and the customer is deceived. When you find out that even the management of this hotel is talking nonsense to fool people, you really give up resistance. Anyway, just make do with it. I will never come again in the future. Of course, the hotel does not lack one of our customers or dozens of guests who radiate our relatives and friends. The poor word of mouth and customers that Shangri-La has built up bit by bit will also be lost bit by bit. In the end, it was PK down by other five-star hotels. PS: The picture shows 4 workstations at the front desk, only one service person, and the guests are waiting in line to check in.

msg:Because they do not leave Shanghai, the family chose Pudong Shangri-La for their birthday. On the night of check-in, dine at Yi Coffee Seafood Buffet Restaurant (Pudong Shangri-La)🍴. It is said that the design concept of Yi Coffee comes from the famous designer Bilkey Llinas. Ten open kitchens are hosted by eight chefs from different countries. Guests can enjoy different cuisines in one meal, enjoy the delicious tastes of the East and the West, and experience the cuisines of China, Asia, Japan, the Mediterranean, and India. I prefer sea cucumber millet porridge, water hairy crab, roast suckling pig, etc. Because of the epidemic, I am not very enthusiastic about raw and cold salmon 🍣 seafood. The restaurant has a beautiful environment and the waiters close the table in a timely manner. Hope to meet friends here next time.

Although I found the baby cheese in the refrigerator, I still felt uncomfortable; cleaning The slippers were not put away after cleaning, etc. The third is that the room smelled of paint, which reflected the lack of information.

Only then did I see a waiter coming over and telling the front desk about my room change! What service speed is this? It's too slow! Is this still the Shangri-La Hotel in our minds? After changing the room, I returned to the hotel in the evening and found that there was no drinking cup? I called and asked, and they said it was in the drawer, but when I opened all the drawers, there was no cup? I really couldn’t find it, so I simply drank the mineral water directly (without a cup)!

Because my husband was injured in an accident, the trip to Sanya had to be cancelled, and finally decided to stay in Shanghai and chose Shangri-La Hotel to make up for the regret of not being able to go to Sanya for vacation. Surprisingly, I have been very happy and relaxed these days. I would like to thank all the staff for their considerate service and warm hospitality.
1. I like the decoration style of the hotel, crystal lamps and gold-painted furniture, which are very textured. Although it is a bit old, it is well maintained and not outdated, very clean and tidy. There will be some stains on the carpet due to the accumulation of years, which is inevitable and does not affect the overall experience.
2. The breakfast is rich and there are many choices. I like freshly squeezed juice and eggs Benedict the most.
3. The swimming pool is very clean. During our stay, there were few guests, the swimming pool was almost empty, and the swimsuit experience was particularly good. It's just that the water temperature is a little colder, and the temperature is higher.
4. Last but not least, the hotel service is really good! From the moment of check-in, I have experienced the meticulous service of the hotel. My husband has a foot injury and has difficulty moving. The hotel provides a wheelchair, and the lobby manager Jennifer also took the initiative to help him to the door of the room. The little brother who helped check in was also very nice.
Because it was our anniversary trip, the hotel also sent cakes and roses, which was really romantic.
During breakfast and dinner, because I had to push a wheelchair and choose a meal, the staff and service staff of the restaurant also offered to help take the plate and bring it to the table. Heart, the favorability of this stay experience is booming!
The seafood buffet dinner was replaced with Halloween decorations, and the staff's headbands were all very interesting, and the festive a**osphere was strong.
All in all, compared with other five-star hotels of the same price, this time, the experience of staying at Shangri-La Hotel is the best, and the service is really super good.
See you next time! ♥️

msg:Apart from the night view of the Bund, there really is nothing praiseworthy about the hotel. They have the same attitude as the BMW Mini staff at the Shanghai Auto Show. They are very polite to foreigners. When dealing with other guests, almost all staff will not look at you directly and speak coldly. (Except for the normal attitude of the reception staff on the day of check-in), the hotels in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, and the hotel standards in Shanghai are far behind those in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It’s no wonder that in big cities, people are bustling, and hotels are also ** The shop is too big to bully customers. The breakfast room on the second floor of Zijin Building is the noisiest buffet restaurant I have ever seen. There is no service at all. I can almost see waiters and chefs laughing and making noise while cooking. I am extremely surprised. Is there no one to manage it? Later I went to the executive restaurant on the 29th floor. There were few people there, but the food was also small and the food was very salty. There is always a buzzing sound in the room, and also in the living room. Even if the air conditioner is turned off, it doesn't work. It is probably because the sound insulation of the room is not good, and it is so noisy that I can't sleep well at night. I will not stay in this hotel again in the future. I have saved money and trouble.

I was afraid that the kettle in the room was unhygienic. I went to the lobby to find a water dispenser to get hot water, but was told that there was no water dispenser in the lobby. There was only boiled water on the 21st floor. Please register at the front desk. It’s also super slow. For such a big hotel, there are only two check-out and payment desks in two halls, and you have to queue up to check out a room. Overall, except for the location, the price/performance ratio is not high.

The front desk customer service was very considerate and replaced me with two rooms in the same building. At the same time, I upgraded the Horizon Pavilion River View Room with afternoon tea. During the process of upgrading the room, it was found that the hotel price on the day was lower than the Ctrip reservation price, and after contacting the Ctrip customer service, a refund for the difference was immediately processed. The hotel has a rich variety of breakfast. In addition to having breakfast on the second floor, Horizon Club guests can also enjoy breakfast and afternoon tea in the elegant buffet restaurant facing the river view on the 21st floor. Overall, the hotel stay was very satisfactory.

In the corridor, I happened to meet a housekeeping manager who was telling the staff where there is still a need for further cleaning. The details are in place and I am impressed.
The river view is first-class, and it may be the best hotel in the area of Lujiazui. Exit the gate of Pujiang Building, turn right and walk for 3 minutes to the riverside area. You can enjoy the Huangpu River and the Bund buildings. The location is excellent!
The second floor of the breakfast is divided into Chinese, Western and Japanese styles. The venue is long and narrow. People who are used to eating Chinese food must go in and take a seat, otherwise it will be a bit troublesome to sit on the Western side to get Chinese food. The dishes are still relatively rich, but it is rare that children's breakfast needs to be charged. The locker room of the swimming pool shows the luxury of a five-star hotel. In addition to the locker room, there are lounges, pools, sauna rooms, powder rooms, and a lot of towels are provided.
Finally, let’s talk about service. We took a 5-year-old child and a 10-month-old baby. The baby was still sleeping. When we wanted to enter the underground parking garage, the parking garage guard asked us to park in the garage of another building and then walked over? ? ? Is this the care that a five-star hotel should have? ? The doorman kept saying that the underground parking lot would definitely not stop. We ended up driving into the underground car park and found a parking space and took the lift directly into the lobby. The other waiters in the store are friendly, they will say hello when they meet, and the glasses-wearing staff who help us with free extra beds are also very responsible.
We are two big and one small. We stayed in the river view room in the Pujiang Tower. We were very satisfied with the 2-meter queen bed and the 1-meter extra bed. It was an excellent choice for a vacation in Shanghai.

This company also requires us to register as members
They also said that if you register, your children will have free breakfast.
Otherwise there will be a charge
Who said there is a charge for a one-year-old child? ?
The room facilities are very old. But a house with a river view worth more than 1,000 yuan per inch of land is considered worthy of the land price.
I'm really sorry for the money if there is no quality service.
I asked if I could upgrade the room, but the front desk said directly that I couldn't.
We booked on Ctrip and did not enjoy the free upgrade.

First of all, when we arrived at the 15th store, we were told that there were no rooms and they were still cleaning up. I had to wait in line for 20 minutes to check in. The line efficiency was extremely poor. It felt like the front desk was not trained.
Secondly, after checking in, I found that the carpet in the room was very dirty, and white dirt fell out when the curtains were opened! The quality of the breakfast buffet was also very poor. The milk was actually blended, not pure.
Finally, when I checked out, I had to wait for another twenty minutes before it was my turn. I was curious, how efficient is a five-star hotel? And it can’t be delayed! ! ! After checking in, there was no delay in checking out. Don't know why. The front desk dragged me to death one by one.

There is no fresh air in the closed window, and the room smells musty and musty! Because there is no ventilation, the smell of decoration is mixed. The cleaning of the room was not thorough. There was a little dust in many places. Has it been unoccupied for a long time? The decoration in the room cannot be scrutinized. It is like the guest house in other places. Don't think that putting a few bottles of L'Occitane will improve the grade. The most exaggerated thing is that the light on the wine counter of the coffee machine could not be turned off. It was already 11 o'clock in the evening and I called the service desk and sent a master to the door. Finally, I knocked and knocked and said that the hinge was broken and the door could not be opened, and the light turned on when the door was opened. Later, I found that the lights in the cloakroom could not be turned off! He simply locked the bathroom door and couldn't see it. This is a 5 star hotel! hehe. The breakfast is rich and varied, but there are too many people until there are vacancies after 10 o'clock. Overall stay experience is not good. Check out and said that I made an in-room call and charged 30 cents (just drunk) to keep silent about the broken facilities last night, and didn't even sign the bill for me to confirm.

Although the Pujiang Building is old, the equipment maintenance is good, the sanitation is in good condition, the room service is fast and friendly, and the response speed is fast. One of the two rooms has a slightly unpleasant smell of the sewer, which may need attention. Horizon Club has corresponding benefits including Mini Bar, afternoon tea and happy hour. The room is facing the river view. Although it happened to turn off the Bund landscape lights, the normal office building lighting is also very beautiful. You can choose to have breakfast in the Horizon Club on the 2nd floor or 21st floor, with more choices on the 2nd floor. All in all, I am very satisfied with this stay, and I will choose Shangri-La next time.

msg:Bad review, very bad
1 Check-in: The front desk staff walked away twice during check-in, which caused us to check in for 20 minutes. The efficiency was very low, and the service was not mentioned, it was very cold.
2. The twin-bed full river view room booked for room 2 was assigned to the room at the end of the corridor. The staff did not remind me if I would mind, but I really do. The bed is only 1.2 meters. In fact, it is less than 1.1 meters. I can't sleep a big one and a small one. In the end, my husband can only sleep on the sofa.
3 There is no charging plug at the head of the bed, which means that you can't charge your phone while lying down.
4 Check out, I checked out at 7 o'clock in the morning, because I was going to Disney, but I called to ask when the deposit was not refunded until 12 o'clock in the noon, only to find out that the front desk did not check you out, what kind of operation is outrageous . Had to call to get the deposit back.
5 There is no disposable toothbrush and toothpaste in the hotel, and there is no reminder when you check in, which leads to the discovery that there is no disposable toothbrush and toothpaste the next morning, so you can only rinse your mouth and go out to play! It should be explained when handling.
6 Service attitude, whether it is dining, calling a car or asking questions about the hotel, either they are unclear, or they are cold. Some waiters don't even raise their heads and don't understand. The hotel of this brand has been blocked,

Environment: The hotel is too old overall, but the protection is relatively good, but the facilities are a bit outdated, which makes people feel that many things are inconvenient to use
Parking: This is the most outrageous. There are 130 parking spaces in two garages of a five-star hotel, and it is difficult to find. The garage is very old, like an underground factory
Service: There is no service standard of a five-star hotel, no one is in charge at the door, check-in is very slow, staff training is not in place, the little girl can't operate when checking in, and she has been taught by other people, and it took 20 minutes; Checking out is about so long, whoever changed the system, they don’t know how to do it, they are doing research on the other side; then when checking out, they have to ask him to register for parking in the backstage, ten minutes, and they are still not at the check-out place , I have to go to another counter, and I spent almost half an hour alone in the early morning of check-out
Room: There is no socket at the head of the bed, this is outrageous; the bathtub is so old that people dare not use it, it is full of holes, and there is no disposable bag, it is basically a decoration
Breakfast: There are not many options, and it’s not too different from the whole season. I don’t think anyone will eat a lot of things. It’s just a supplement
This level is a bit worse than the comfort of other hotels of the same price

Many people like the Bund in Puxi, but I like the Bund in Pudong. It is not so crowded. Walking along the river embankment in the morning, my mood is quickly healed. Going out in the early morning is the Bund Riverside Trail.

🍃Environment: It occupies an excellent geographical location, the parking lot is very convenient, the surrounding is the Zhengda Plaza, there are characteristic shops and bars along the street, and the first-class river view is 500 meters away.

🧹Hygiene: I thought that the old hotel would have some flaws, but Shangri-La is very clean, even the glass is wiped clean and you can press fingerprints;

🚗 Transportation: Lujiazui Station of Metro Line 2, the starting point of many buses.

🔔Service: The front desk service is very good. At present, you need to scan the nucleic acid to enter the door. The epidemic prevention is still very safe. In addition, the nucleic acid sampling point is also very convenient nearby.

In short, in my mind, the number one luxury hotel in Shanghai must be booked for a river view room, which is a worthwhile trip.

msg:Due to the impact of the epidemic, I was unable to travel to other provinces and cities. On July 20, I made an appoin**ent with a few friends to stay at the Pudong Shangri-La Hotel for one night, and booked a deluxe river view room in the Pujiang Building. The price is not expensive, the scenery is beautiful, and the price is very high. Shangri-La is a little old, but still very clean and the facilities are good. The staff are more dedicated and have a good service attitude. We encountered a little problem, and the manager on duty solved it satisfactorily, which made us very satisfied. Will recommend to friends to enjoy the time with a panoramic view of the Pujiang River.

msg:An old-fashioned star hotel, our family was the only one when we checked in, and the speed was fast enough. I have stayed in many star hotels when I travel. Maybe it's because I don't know enough... The baby supplies are only delivered by phone, so why does the front desk have to register the identity information of the five-year-old? And I suggested that I pay the child's breakfast fee directly when I checked in. I said that the child is only five years old and does not even have a height of 120cm, so I said that if I can't enter the restaurant tomorrow, I have to come down and pay before I can enter the meal. I just want to know what I paid the 10,000 yuan for? ? Can't hang up the room bill? And when I went to the restaurant for breakfast the next morning, the staff just looked at the age of the child and said that there was no need to pay, and they entered directly. I don't understand why I have to pay for the children's meals when I check in in the lobby? ? ? It is recommended to strengthen the service quality and improve the guest experience!

Every year I bring my baby to see the Huangpu River, and Shangri-La's river view room is really true.
The front desk has increased the price to upgrade the location and administration, and the price has been very good recently. The breakfast is also good, but the epidemic can only go to the small restaurant.
Last year, because of the fireworks show, the hotel was full of people, and the buffet was crowded in the morning. I pray that the bustle of the past will be restored quickly.

The pool isn't open yet, but it's opening next week. Everyone can spend a small weekend of shopping and eating.

I made an appoin**ent to upgrade the room in advance, so the so-called river view room was only available after 4 o'clock. I waited in the lobby for more than 2 hours and walked into the room. The scenery is not bad. Unfortunately, the body lotion used in the bathroom makes people feel Sorry for the 5 star sign.
What's even more outrageous is that after eating the buffet in the set meal at night, before we could digest it, we received a call from the hotel saying that we hadn't paid for the meal, and asked us to go to the restaurant on the second floor to check out. After repeated explanations on the phone, the staff only counted I figured it out, but we were still asked to go to the restaurant to sign the bill, which was really speechless.

Then comment on the hotel, it is old, and the smell of this hotel is really varied. The lobby, 4 elevators, guest room floors and rooms are all smelly. . . I also do not understand. The elevator, especially at night, smells like **** and fart. . Finally, I would like to comment on the breakfast. The quality of the food is standard. The service: because my husband is not feeling well, I will pack it for him. The waiter said that I can only take bread and fruit! Why? Okay, and then gave me a paper bag, this bag can't even hold watermelon and dragon fruit, can it? So inexplicable. Breakfast costs money! What I pack is still limited like this. will not come again!

msg:Pudong Shangri-La Hotel has always been tall in my heart, and I have always wanted to stay for one night in my heart. This time I took my birthday to experience it.
After reading Ctrip's online accommodation reviews, I originally chose the Pujiang deluxe room, hoping to see the river view. Later, the front desk of the hotel contacted me through Ctrip customer service and told me that the Pujiang deluxe room could not see the night view of the Huangpu River (those who marked the Pujiang deluxe room in the evaluation could see the night view do not know what happened), so I decided to upgrade the river view room after I went to the front desk of the hotel (make up for the difference). 400 yuan).
Overall, I am satisfied with the stay. The hotel facilities are a little old, but the management is still in place, the various facilities are relatively complete, and the rooms are clean and tidy. Since the baby is under 12 years old, an extra bed can be added for free. This must be liked. There is also a children's playground downstairs, and the kart (80 yuan/10 minutes) archery hall requires a little arm strength, so the baby does not like to play, and there are other game consoles.
The location of the hotel is what I am most satisfied with. It is backed by the Zhengda Plaza, the Oriental Pearl, and next to Pudong Binjiang Avenue. It is very comfortable to play at night and watch the night view of the Bund. It will be more comfortable if the weather is warmer.
We will choose Shangri-La Hotel again in the future!

The hotel's elevator is severely aged and vibrates when riding. It's so scary. It's a high-rise building. I forgot my ID and asked the guest to get it by himself... I couldn't get out of Shanghai and wanted to miss Shangri-La...

I played the swimming pool at a different peak. After the swim, I went to the 36th floor of Zijin Building. -4:30) Take a look at the invincible sunset view of Pujiang River, drink coffee and eat snacks. There are also many parent-child activities in the hotel. We participated in the parade of the God of Wealth on the fifth day of the new year, and also played the archery and switch of the amu*****t park (note that the door closes at 7 pm), as well as the go-kart on the ba*****t floor, and the happy hour of the Horizon Club at night ( 5: 00-7: 00) In addition to the buffet, there are also special cocktails, watching the night view, it is absolutely no problem to be full, and the taste is also OK. The swimming pool is open until 11:00 pm, giving the guests plenty of time to swim. Opposite is the gym. You can see a three-piece suite on the 35th floor of the Sky Room. The room has Shanghai specialties, and the first round of the minibar is free. The breakfast variety at Yi Café was also very rich the next day. It was a bit late this time. Otherwise, you can enjoy the delicious food here. The honey is actually freshly uncovered.

You can have a panoramic view of such a beautiful view from the river view room of Pudong Shangri-La Hotel😍
        As the "Whampoa Military Academy" in the hotel industry, Shangri-La's service is perfectly explained by front desk employee Peter and service manager Tommy Jack, with a rigorous and attentive service attitude, and a home-like service experience. Under the epidemic, Shangri-La can still be like this. I can also feel the smiles of lvy and tina 😊
        For me, who has difficulty in choosing, such a rich breakfast really made me stunned 😂 It took me a while to recover, and it reminded me of the first time I stayed at Kerry Hotel of Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts , 🤔Kerry Hotel is also highly recommended to everyone, especially those with children, the 700-square-meter children's playground is not covered 👼, the little brothers and sisters at the front desk are really beautiful!!!

msg:This is the worst 5-star hotel I have ever stayed in, bar none. When we arrived at the hotel, we were not allowed to park in the underground garage. An old man was guarding the entrance. He told him that we were staying in the hotel and asked us to park in the parking lot next to it and said 300. Yuan, the hotel can reimburse us 80 yuan. This is the first time I have seen such a joke in a hotel in China, and they gave us a serious education. This was the first time that the front desk was so slow. There were only 2-3 guests in front of the queue, but it took about half an hour. When I arrived, I was told that I could only give one room first, and the other one had not been cleaned yet. It was already early. After the stipulated check-in time of 2 o'clock, I went to the front desk to ask about which room an hour later, but the answer was still not good. It was already around 4 o'clock in the afternoon. It was said that the guest in front of our room checked out at 11 o'clock. I was speechless. . The bath towels used in guest rooms are not even as good as those in express hotels. The swimming pool on the 5th floor can also be regarded as a swimming pool. It can only be regarded as a children's paddling pool. The floor tiles on the floor are extremely slippery. The lifeguards constantly remind people passing by to find out. People slip and fall every day. Isn't it enough to attract the attention of the management? Do we have to wait until someone falls and breaks a bone? The inflatable platform in the children's paradise suddenly leaked air when a child stood on it. It was very dangerous for the child to be covered in it. The staff nearby seemed to be used to it and came to deal with it slowly. What kind of hotel is this? I regret staying in this hotel, and of course I will never stay there again.

msg:In all these years, I have never had such a bad experience staying in a five-star hotel! If Pudong Shangri-La does not strengthen management, I hope the hotel brand will not be ruined in their hands. I drove there on August 20. When I arrived at the hotel, the security guard told me arrogantly, "There are no parking spaces, not even for hotel guests. Park in the building next door!" We could only drive to the Mirae Asset Building next door. As for whether my family and I, with our 4-year-old child, would be tired after dragging heavy luggage to the building next door and walking 100 meters back, that has nothing to do with them. I booked 2 rooms, but I didn't get one until after 4 pm. There were no tea bags in the room except for three bottles of water. I only had to call to get 2 small bags of green tea. The other room was given on time, but the air conditioner in the room was turned on but not turned on, and the temperature remained high for several hours. Call the service center on the room phone number. Whether they answer the call or not depends on their mood. If they answer the call once, they won't answer the second time. Someone came and took a look, admitted that the air conditioning was not good, and left. Later, I had to ask Ctrip customer service to intervene before agreeing to change rooms. Whether it's checking in or going downstairs to ask something, the queue at the front desk takes more than half an hour every time. I checked out the next day and went to the building next door to pick up my car. They said I was going to pick up the car and come back. The parking fee would be reimbursed by the concierge. When we arrived at the concierge, the guests were noisy and surrounded me. I went up to ask, but they arrogantly ordered me to line up. The other guests were noisy and surrounded me, but they only asked me to line up. I don’t know which article or section of the hotel management regulations this is based on. , or is it based on which hotel service standards at home and abroad, do you treat me differently depending on my attire? I am not disheveled, am I? Others, such as the elevator card swiping system, are useless. You can just press the floor button regardless of whether you swipe your card or not. I won’t go into details about these. I will never stay in any Shangri-La around the world in the future. I hope that what I encountered is just an exception.

The original executive room in Zijin Building has no two rooms on the same floor due to the high area. I asked the front desk customer service to change to Pujiang Building. The front desk customer service staff of Zijin Building was very enthusiastic to find a way for me. After many internal coordination, they transferred us to the river view room on the 28th floor of Pujiang Building. Due to the sudden drop in temperature in the past few days, the air-conditioning and heating effect of the top-floor guest room is not ideal. Manager Wang of the front desk service center of Pujiang Building also sent us a heater and waived the additional cost of room upgrade. I would like to express my thanks to the customer service staff at the front desk of this hotel! We will choose this hotel for vacation in the future.

msg:When I arrived, the panoramic river view room in the Pujiang Building was full and I could not check in immediately. The front desk recommended an extra 200 yuan to live in an executive room. I felt that the advantages and disadvantages were not worth changing after staying here. , The room is relatively quiet, but if you want to see the front river view, don't book an executive room. There is a high probability that you will see the business building next to it and the newly built Zijin Building. Looking at the attached picture, you can see how big the difference is between the panoramic river view room and the executive room. But the service is really good, worthy of Shangri-La's positioning. The staff members encountered were enthusiastic and patient in answering questions. When booking, I repeatedly booked two rooms. After checking out, I found out that after communicating with Ctrip, it was not considered a breach of contract, and no guarantee was confiscated. Generally speaking, if you live in a panoramic river view room, it is very worthwhile to stay. It is only a 2-minute walk away from the Zhengda Plaza and the Riverside Trail, which is close at hand.

msg:I checked in at two o'clock on Wednesday afternoon. The first floor was full of people and there were many people queuing up. A manager came over and told me to go to the 21st floor to check in. I gave him a thumbs up. I didn't queue up when I got to the 21st floor. I had to rely on someone inside to handle it for me. It took more than 20 minutes to do various operations. I asked if there were any higher floors. I was told that I had to wait for higher floors. I said forget it and swiped my credit card for pre-authorization. I asked if I needed to sign, and I was told to sign when I came to get the room card. It turned out that after 20 minutes of manipulation, I was told that I still had to wait for the room. So why did I have to wait for the high floor? ! Forget it, I tolerate it. I was given a code sheet (I couldn't understand the code on it anyway) and said that with this check-in, the air conditioner on the 21st floor was broken and was being repaired. I had a family and a four-year-old child with me. You can imagine for yourself. I waited for almost an hour. At around 3 o'clock, I saw that the customer in front of me had already checked in. They were on the high floor and there was no waiting. I went up to ask if the room was available. After a computer search, I was told that the room was available and was arranged on the sixth floor. I asked why the guests in the previous group could have the same room type as me and have a high floor without waiting. I was told that it was a double bed. Room, I reluctantly endured it. Then after a while, he told me that the pre-authorization was canceled by me. I couldn't bear it anymore! She asked me to provide my card number, but I refused. Later, she took a picture of the bank’s consumption text message on my mobile phone. And told her basic common sense that pre-authorization is the cardholder's right to authorize the merchant in advance. Usually the cardholder cannot cancel without special circumstances, and only the authorized merchant can complete or cancel it. She (silent) picked up the phone and started to report. I heard her say that the POS machine had not printed out the order. I couldn't help but interrupt again and told her that it must have been printed out. I was the first customer she handled. At that time, I was asked if I needed to sign. She picked up a long row of lists and searched for a long time, and finally found it. After another operation, she handed me the room key and said two words to me: OK. I couldn't help but start to get angry again. In Shanghai's weather, I had to wait for more than an hour with the air conditioner broken, and there was not a polite word of apology during the whole process. Tell me confidently that the air conditioner is being repaired. If the air conditioner is broken, don't open the 21st floor. As a guest, Yiwu will not bear the risk of repairing your air conditioner. I asked her if she should take the initiative to tell guests how to get to the elevator after handing in the room key? Should I tell you where and when breakfast will be served? Should I ask the guest if he or she drives? If so, how should I go through the formalities? Okay, I admit it. I have stayed in many Shangri-La hotels across the country, but none of them satisfy me. Every time I change cities, I always reassure myself that this city might be better. The same is true in Shanghai where I live. ! Maybe I’m not worthy of this brand! After I inquired for a while, she told me that I could just swipe my room card or report my room number for breakfast. Forget it, I should take my children to an air-conditioned room early. I was too lazy to get angry with her. Let’s talk about the waiting episode. A group of guests were also waiting, and the children were running. The service staff rudely scolded the children not to run. I understand that the starting point is good, and they are afraid that the children will fall and get hurt, but the tone is really inappropriate. Dare to compliment. Snacks and fruits were put out at the Three Points Lounge. Two children from the waiting family ran over and asked the waiter if they could eat them. The waiter asked the five or six-year-old kid seriously, "Do you have a room card for which room type?" There is nothing that cannot be eaten. To this question, does she think a five- or six-year-old child can answer what type of room she lives in? The children looked very disappointed after being rejected. What about getting a plate for the kids to pick up? The child's parents didn't see it, otherwise they might feel uncomfortable. To be honest, the view in the room is pretty good. I just brought my children to see the view and swim. Other facilities in the room are aging badly. The next day I went for breakfast and reported my room number at the door of the restaurant. I was told that it didn't work and I needed to swipe my room card! Fortunately, our family went to eat together. If I had gone first, wouldn't I have been blocked outside again? I then remembered that I was told to report my room number when I checked in, and many words were racing through my mind. . . . . . There were a lot of people in the restaurant, but every time I encountered a waiter while walking with a plate of food, I would stop and step aside to let him go. Well, I tolerated it. In addition, there is always a queue for check-in every time you come in and out, and the efficiency is still in the 90s. The management can calculate how long it takes for the next guest to check in, and the visual inspection is no less than ten minutes. One star for service is given to the girl at the swimming pool, otherwise I would give a negative score. In addition to the beautiful scenery, if you have other requirements, please choose carefully. By the way, around five o'clock in the afternoon on the day of check-in, a waiter with a northern Jiangsu accent knocked on the door and said that I had been notified that this room was checked out. She came to inquire about me. . . . . . I could only ask her from whom she had received the notice. After asking her several times, she probably felt that I was angry, so she changed her words and said she was here to see me. I asked her what she was here to see? I will give them a big thank you!

msg:Because of the location and breakfast, almost every time I come to Shanghai, I must stay at Shangri-La. This time it is really hard to say enough. Whether it is service or hygiene, the breakfast table is very unreliable. One morning, a service staff walked in front of us. There was absolutely no intention of taking us, and there was no one to take us there one day...Secondly, hygiene, when I went out to have breakfast, I found that the cleaning staff had already come, and they just put the quilt on the floor on the bed, without even laying it down, which is even more exaggerated. Unfortunately, there were blood stains from the child's nosebleed on the quilt, so I put it on the floor. As a result, the cleaning staff just picked it up and didn't even change it. I called the front desk and someone changed the quilt for the big bed, but the baby's crib was still using the belt. The blood-stained quilt was covered with blood, and no one cared about it. Due to various reasons, I couldn't bear it, so I proposed to check out early. After Ctrip customer service called and found out the reason, they apologized to me and told me that the hotel would reply to me before 12 noon the next day, and then passed A week and no response

According to the reviews, the Zijin Building is a new building, but the facilities inside are also outdated...
The toilet lid is cold, the hair dryer is actually attached to the drawer, it is very old-fashioned, the slippers are also very simple, there are no intimate objects in the room, there is not a bottle of drinks in the mini bar, and I am drunk...
Very unworthy of this five-star standard.
Apart from the view from the window, there is really nothing here.
And the scenery should be better in the old building, after all, there is no block,
But the facilities in the old building are said to be more outdated...
In addition to being outdated, the hygiene is also very careless
Dust everywhere, and the breakfast table is dusty
It won't come again in the future, it's a mess...

msg:The occupancy rate of Puxiang during the Spring Festival is really gratifying, resulting in too long check-in time and difficult parking. Fortunately, the hotel has upgraded the room. The panoramic river view room has an invincible view. You can sit in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows for a whole day in a daze.
The Puxiang Building is closer to the Bund, and the landscape is unobstructed, but the rooms are not as modern as the Zijin Building. I still prefer the Zijin Building.
Horizon Club benefits, soft drinks are available all day, and the breakfast is Western-style and can be ordered a la carte. There are fewer people than the buffet downstairs, and the experience is better. But during the Spring Festival afternoon snack time and Happy Hour too many wives, often can not find a seat, the food is always empty, the experience is not good.
The swimming pool is large, but the locker is full, so I can only go back to the room to change clothes.
The lane of the go-kart is relatively large, and the children have a good time. The inflatable castle in the children's park is too bad, and it often falls down, which is not safe.

msg:This Pudong Shangri-La Hotel is simply amazing. I have never stayed in a worse five-star hotel than this one. The experience was terrible.
This Shangri-La is a bit old, so it is understandable that the facilities are old. But because I thought Shangri-La Chinese Restaurant was delicious and wanted to see the Oriental Pearl Tower, I booked this restaurant.
When booking, because it was a package, we received Horizon Club benefits. Was looking forward to it. Unexpectedly, when I arrived at the Horizon Club, I was told that there were no seats and I had to grab a seat myself. Originally, administrative courtesy should be for a few people and should not be overbooked. Even if it is overbooked and the flow of people is really high, we can still notify customers to make appoin**ents or help arrange them. It was the first time I heard that you have to grab the position by yourself. It was an eye-opener! Looking at the self-service afternoon tea area, there were only a few items and everything was sold out. It’s just a bit unbearable.
The hygiene was also very careless and there were even spider webs under the basin.
Not to mention the facilities. At 11 o'clock, I found that the closet light was always on. I called the front desk and asked the front desk that it would turn off automatically after the door was closed. After confirming again and again, it turned off.
It was on, and I didn't bother to ask again since the baby was asleep.
Overall, it was a very bad experience to choose Pudong Shangri-La for the New Year trip. When I stayed at Shangri-La out of town before, it was very good.

Children can go to the playground on the second floor to play. The room was a little small, the bathtub was a bit de-porcelain, the shower head was old, and the spray coverage was not very friendly for short people. The brand of body wash is L'Occitane, which is very comfortable to use. The scenery outside the window is from the photo, it looks good, the curtains are automatic, the sound of the fresh air system is light, the temperature is comfortable, and the skin is still moist when I wake up the next day.

msg:I came here to celebrate my birthday during the Chinese New Year and met the weird receptionist - Peter Lin. There is no greeting. I asked for twin beds, but there was no one! Or add 3,000 liters for a suite. If the room rate is more than 1,000, do you want me to add 3,000? He didn't have the confidence to say this himself. Birthday cake, no! I'm too busy today, so I'll give it to you tomorrow. Why do I still need a cake after my birthday tomorrow? In the end, Peterlin said something shocking: This place has been like a refugee camp these two days! so terrible! Facial recognition was not performed, the deposit was not confiscated, and the entertainment coupons included in the package were not actively provided. Mr. Lin's professional ability was worrying, and all his energy was spent on making things difficult for customers who despised him.
The administrative corridor on the 29th floor has been reduced to a food court, but the front desk is very good, polite and professional. I’ve seen people sit there from afternoon tea until the happy hour in the evening, but I’ve never seen the whole place like this. All these people could sit for half a day just to occupy seats. It’s incredible! The gym was full of children, like a playground. In the afternoon, someone knocked on the door and asked if I wanted to turn down the room. When I said no, the waiter couldn't hide his joy and said thank you repeatedly. There was a problem with the water storage in the toilet of 3055. I opened the water tank lid and fiddled with it a few times to fix it myself.
Finally, I would like to thank Ctrip for turning all the "nos" in Peter Lin's words into "yess". It helped me adjust the twin beds and sent me a cake on the same day. Although it was extremely ugly, I still thank you (Picture 2). Picture 1 is a cake that was given to me by the front desk for my birthday at the Disney Hotel two years ago. Of course, the room price has doubled, so there is a reason why Shangri-La can only sell for more than 1,000 yuan during the Chinese New Year in this location.

You had to go half way to the hotel to get a meal. It cost more than 200 per person for breakfast and I felt that there was nothing delicious. It was not worth it. Afternoon tea is said to be all-you-can-drink, but the place is as big as a desk, and almost half of the people in the hotel are crowded. You have to grab things, otherwise you won't be able to eat anything. It is really an experience that changes your outlook on life. I don't want to stay here again.

msg:Every year on the second day of the new year, I choose a five-star hotel in the city to stay for two nights. So it can be said that I have stayed in several five-star hotels in Lujiazui. According to the reviews, the Pujiang Building can see the river view, so I will clarify it! I booked a deluxe room in the Pujiang Building, but when I checked in, I was told by the front desk that I could not see any river view in this room type, so I added 800 yuan/two nights and upgraded to a room with a river view. However, the final price should be considered to live next to the Mandarin Oriental. The Mandarin Oriental room is big and the hardware facilities are good.
Having stayed in so many Shangri-La hotels, this is really the smallest room I have ever stayed in, and the interior facilities are really outdated!
Another flaw is that parking spaces are hard to find! There is no parking space on the ground, and the underground garage is full. The hotel said that you can park at other places nearby, and the hotel will reimburse the parking fee. Too speechless, very inconvenient.
Maybe because there are too many guests during the Chinese New Year, the hotel service obviously can't keep up. Check-in requires a long queue; call the service depar**ent to ask for something, and it takes about half an hour to deliver it.
Also, during the Chinese New Year period, there were already a lot of guests, but the swimming pool was only opened on one building, and it was very inconvenient to wear a swimsuit every time to pass through the buildings. The pool is crowded.
In short, the experience is very general and very general, and I will not choose a hotel in the future.

msg:Staying at Shangri-La for the first time overturned my impression of senior 5-star hotels. After staying in so many hotels, none of this hotel's service plan or even facilities can keep up... First of all, the check-in line starts at 1:30. Check-in took 2 hours. I understand that there are many people during the holidays, but does the hotel have no plan? There are only two check-in windows. After everyone started complaining, one was added. The question is, is check-in that difficult? After I checked in, I understood that after waiting for 2 hours, the result was that there was no room or room card. I just registered you. After that, I kept asking you to go to the 29th floor to get the room card, and then go to the 29th floor luxury room. We had afternoon tea in the pavilion and waited. It was crowded like a vegetable market. Then we waited for an hour to get the card at around 4:30 and was told that we would have to wait 40 minutes before we could get a room. I got angry on the spot. No one wants to be angry during the Chinese New Year. The problem is that you allow unlimited guests to wait and see, and there is no solution at all. By the way, this is a family hotel. I went to see the children's paradise and immediately quit. The biggest impression that left on me was that it looked magnificent, but in reality it was a bunch of straw bags. It was confusing. There were still a lot of details that were not enough. I will see what platform can make me serious. write~

msg:I regret using the package during the Spring Festival. It took more than an hour to arrive at the hotel at 2 o'clock and wait for check in. After that, it took more than an hour to wait for the room to be cleaned and checked in, and I didn't enter the room until 5 o'clock. Although we were sitting in the executive lounge on the 29th floor while waiting for the room, there were so many snacks and drinks, but it was crowded with people, and some people even took packing boxes to pack snacks...
The room is medium in size, the window is facing IFC and Shanghai Center, and the bed is quite comfortable. But the TV is small, and there's a badminton on top...
In order to avoid the crowd, we got up at 6 o'clock and went downstairs for a swim, so as to get a positive experience.
The overall feeling is that from hardware to service, there is really not the level that Shangri-La should have. Of course, the waiters have done their best. If the capacity is not enough, then don't book so many rooms. If the experience is not good, it will really lose the word of mouth.
Then I feel that the waiters as a whole need to be trained, and some of them are unclear.
It seems that the overall expectations for Shangri-La cannot be too high.

Warm reminder: When booking a room, be sure to choose a river view room. The biggest selling point of the Shangri-La Hotel is the river view room, but not all rooms can see the river view, so be sure to book carefully. Many customers are arguing with the front desk about the river view room. To avoid disappoin**ent, check the room type before booking.

Fruits, breads, desserts and drinks are all good, but there seems to be no meat other than marinated bacon and fish pieces. There are welcome candies and red masks in the New Year's room. There are folk craftsmen in the hall making Chinese knots and window grilles. In the restaurant, Pu Xiaoxiang will come to take a group photo. There are no surprises on the birthday. The car was parked next to Mirae Asset Building, and the parking fee was reimbursed after parking for a while after checking out. Generally speaking, it is a hotel with a high cost performance for river view, and will stay again.

I stayed at Pudong Shangri-La during New Year's Day. I read reviews before booking. Many said the hotel was old, but when I actually checked in, I realized that the management was old!
1. Check-in: I waited in line for 1 hour for check-in.
2. Get a room: Reserve two rooms, get one quickly, and wait for dinner in the other. We didn’t get it until nearly 20 o’clock when we returned to the hotel. During this period, we did not receive any notification from the hotel staff.
3. Executive Lounge: The lounge is full of guests waiting for rooms. There is no staff registration information to enter. It is noisy and crowded inside.
4. Room service: No one answered the call to the front desk. When I went out to eat, I saw the front desk phone ringing, but the staff ignored it.
5. Room hardware: There was a serious water leak in the bathroom of one room after 21 o'clock in the evening. After calling and waiting for nearly 20 minutes, no one responded. I could only go to the front desk to urge. After the engineer came to the door, he only said that he needed to change rooms, and he took the initiative to go to the room again. The front desk and hotel staff did not apologize at all.
6. Breakfast: It is impossible to ask for coffee or black tea when you are seated! I only found one coffee machine in the whole place and there was a queue all the time.
7. Check-out: During check-out, the front desk staff was completely unaware of the water leak due to Shangri-La's backward back-end management system. When we mentioned it, the staff asked the manager on duty next to him to come forward, and the manager asked her to call another person in charge. , the staff called us in front of us and said, "He asked me to find you", which really made us feel the mutual pushback. In the end, when we left, no one in charge came forward to apologize for the matter.

msg:During the epidemic period, everyone chose the Shangri-La Hotel in Pudong New Year's Eve. The parking lot of the hotel is small and relatively old. If you can't stop to park around, the hotel can help you reimburse you. The hotel is divided into Zijin Building and Pujiang Building. This time we chose the executive deluxe room in Zijin Building, which includes executive lounge trea**ent. Dinner is there at night. The executive lounge on the 29th floor has a panoramic view of the Bund of Huangpu River, which is quite beautiful. The "3-piece set" can be seen in the rooms of Zijin Building, and it is spectacular when you open the curtains. One end of the corridor faces the Oriental Pearl Tower, and I feel that it looks more beautiful than the river view room in the Pujiang Tower. The hotel’s breakfast is on the second floor. It’s very large. I only prefer desserts and breads. But the service is very good and the dishes are often collected. New Year's Eve + New Year's Day. There are too many people in the hotel, the lounge and restaurant will be noisier, and the food is not fast. It is considerate. Check out in the afternoon because I have to issue a ticket, so I queued up with the check-in. Fortunately, the hotel is still humane. We left our room number to the lobby staff and left after returning the room card. At night, we returned the same way. Up a deposit.

I think the Zijin Tower Skyline Room is better, the Oriental Pearl Tower panoramic view, the Pudong three-piece panoramic view, the Huangpu River Bund panoramic view is right in front of you, the location is right, and the room view is very beautiful. The restaurant has more perspectives. The attitude of the service staff is very good. Jinxuan at the front desk checked in quickly. The manager Jimmy is very good and attentive. Maisie and Ruby are also very careful to help me introduce hotel facilities and equipment. I am very satisfied with staying here with a little baby.

When I went out at 9:30 the next morning, it was still there. We specifically went to the concierge on the first floor to inform them that there was vomit at the elevator entrance No. 5 on the 10th floor and please find someone to clean it up.

As a result, when we returned to the room at noon, this pile of things was still waiting for us at the elevator entrance. It's ridiculous, no one cared about it for 12 hours!

The breakfast is rich in variety and suitable for all ages. The only thing I feel is that the professional service provided by the hotel staff is far inferior to the management level of the Shangri-La Hotel 10 years ago. It’s a pity. There were problems with both check-in and check-out in the Horizon Club. When checking in, the companion was asked to provide ID card registration twice. However, when the breakfast was the next day, he was told that no such person was found. The deposit was not cancelled in time when checking out, thinking that later Will be refunded, I don’t want to get home at night and I didn’t return the call and contacted and said it was processed immediately. The result is still not refunded after 12 noon the next day. Call the contact again and then refund it. If you don’t pay the deposit (even though the full room rate has been paid in advance) Can you stay at ease? Shangri-La's credibility is questioned on this issue of integrity.

The whole river view room you live in has a sweeping view of the Huangpu River, which is so beautiful. The people of Shanghai look at Shanghai with great pleasure. The service attitude of the executive profile of the Horizon Club is good. The dishes for breakfast and dinner are delicious. There is also a buffet and a la carte. In the evening, there is a bit of Buddha jumping over the wall and sea cucumber and millet porridge, both of which are delicious. It’s very close to Binjiang Avenue, and it’s beautiful to take a stroll at night to see the scenery. It is worth staying.

I will not say other good things. This time, I gave the lowest score for the service. The attitude is extremely poor, and the service quality is completely different from Shangri-La's service quality. Don't introduce it to reception if you are not trained well. It does not meet the quality of Shangri-La at all, and it is still Shangri-La in the most elite Lujiazui financial district in Shanghai.

It can be said that it is one of the high-end hotels located in the core commercial area of Lujiazui~ Shangri-La has a very deep impression on me. Whether it is in Hangzhou or other areas, there is an old-fashioned retro feeling. Shangri-La in Pudong, Shanghai is still In the same vein, but one thing I have to say is that,
The viewing angle and field of view of this piece are really very good ~ a proper C position.
This time, Sean Zhu, the duty manager at the front desk, checked in, and the room arrangement was also very suitable. Because the travel time requires late check-out, call Nicole at the front desk to give free late check-out, and the service of Cassie Megan Janet is also worthy of praise. The Yi Coffee and Tanwanri restaurants on the second floor are relatively popular in Shanghai ~ especially Yi Coffee s is relatively tasteful ~ there is a swimming pool on the 5th floor ~ and the bustling Pudong can be seen in the swimming pool. Panoramic night view.
And compared to other hotels, I still recognize the service awareness of the Shangri-La brand.

They said it was a new building with more complete facilities and cleaner facilities than the Pujiang Building I booked. Since it was clean and hygienic when I came out to play, I added it without much thought. After checking in, I felt that I was being tricked. Because I recognized the Shangri-La brand, I didn’t check carefully when I entered. It was already past 10pm when I came back from shopping with my wife. I was very tired and ready to wash up and go to bed. I was shocked by the hygienic condition of the bathroom. The dust on the dressing table and the blood stains on the bathtub were not at all like what a branded five-star hotel should have. Since it was already very late and I was very tired, I didn't contact the front desk and settled for one night. Anyway, I won't choose Shangri-La when I come to Shanghai in the future. I only took a photo of the bathtub, but didn’t take any other photos. I simply washed up and rested. I was really tired.

The executive lounge breakfast and dinner are very exquisite, with a la carte dishes, but dinner is not like breakfast. Put the menu on the table. If you have not read the reviews, you don't know that there are a la carte dishes, including Buddha jumps over the wall and sea cucumber flower glue. If there is no à la carte dishes, there is really nothing special. In addition, afternoon tea is really too simple compared to early dinner. Of course the price is there. The house price of the Ritz-Carlton next door is twice as high, and the food is not as high as here. All in all, the price/performance ratio is super high. A small suggestion. Such a great meal can be used as a hotel feature. The afternoon tea at 12:30 is already very user-friendly. If there are more cold dishes, it will be perfect.

The hotel is located in Lujiazui, the most central location, so it is very convenient to go to the Oriental Pearl Tower, Oceanarium, the Bund, etc. 2. You can get a good view of the city from the 33rd floor of the hotel. 3. It’s more convenient to get takeout. 4. Parking is free. Then let’s talk about the shortcomings of this hotel: 1. Seeing that we were a family of three, they didn’t ask for slippers for a child, and there were no summer slippers in the bathroom (not even for three people), so it was a bit inconvenient to take a bath. 2. The moment I opened the door and entered the room, there was an obvious smell (the smell next to the pig transport truck on the highway) (we lived on the 33rd floor). It took about 15 minutes to get used to the smell. 3. The hair dryer is as shown in the picture below. This hotel costs more than 1,400 per night. Are you afraid that customers will steal it? Very inconvenient. 4. There is no place to charge mobile phones by the bedside. 5. This dirty carpet does not match this place at all. See the picture below. 6. If there is an additional 16.6% service fee, Ctrip didn’t tell you in advance and they only found out after check-in.

msg:Due to the fact that the baby at home cannot leave Shanghai during the epidemic, I decided to choose a hotel to pretend to be on vacation. I chose the Shangri-La Hotel because I have had a buffet at their home, and I feel pretty good overall. Facts proved that I did not choose the wrong room. I chose to upgrade the room to the panoramic view room of Horizon Club at Zijin Tower. The view can see the whole Bund. The room is clean and tidy. The hotel buffet dinner and breakfast are as good as always. The location is also very good. Jin, I would also like to thank Moni, Sheila, Lynn, Tina and Bella who served us, and of course the other staff of the hotel are also very dedicated. I will choose Shangri-La Hotel next time.

So when I made the reservation, I said that I would give a birthday cake. It was confirmed at the front desk when I checked in, but it was never delivered. Later, I made several phone calls to ask, and finally said it would take 4 hours. When I returned to the hotel more than 9 pm, I saw it on the table. It's just that this experience is not so good.

One moment the hotel front desk said it would be refunded to me, and the next moment it said it had been reported to the headquarters and could only be refunded after approval from the group. A group as big as Shangri-La was pushing back and forth for the 116.6 yuan, but it was obviously the front desk's mistake at the time!

Araon, the little handsome guy in the Horizon Club, has always been enthusiastic about serving us. Seeing that we are very hot, he brought me a lot of ice cubes.

The night view is invincible, the Oriental Pearl Tower is close at hand, the Bund opposite and the W Hotel next to Magnolia Square are clearly visible
Open the curtains the next morning, you can see the people running and cycling down the riverside, as well as the vehicles on the Bund Waibaidu Bridge. The Oriental Pearl in the morning is also very beautiful.
Room facilities:
The room is very large, the mattress is particularly comfortable, the overall port wind, the folding of the shower interface will affect the water output, the equipment may need to be replaced, the shampoo is very fragrant and the air conditioning is very powerful
I don’t know why in the room. Why are there so many drawers and cabinets? Writing desks, TV cabinets, wardrobes, coffee tables, bedside tables, tea cabinets...Anyway, many drawers
Dinning room:
There are many kinds of breakfast. There is a chocolate cake in the pastry baking, which is very delicious. I ate four whole pieces. What surprised me was that I found Shanghai special raw fried and glutinous rice cakes. Absolute!
parking:
Our car is parked at B2 and there is a direct elevator to the lobby. When leaving, please report the license plate number at the lobby concierge and staff, and you can apply
Location traffic:
Go downstairs and across the road is IFC. I ran to ShakeShack in the evening and ordered a glass of Shanghai Charm Purple Milkshake, which was surprisingly delicious.

From the height of the 17th floor, the scenery of the Bund International Building Group is first-rate, without any obstruction, the scenery of the Huangpu River is right in front of you. The front is Binjiang Avenue, and it is also very close to the shopping mall. After dinner, take a walk and enjoy the river breeze, which is very pleasant. The front desk staff are also very enthusiastic, thank Jack, Lydia for helping me check in, and Nicole is also very caring, Janet and Ms. Megan are very enthusiastic to guide me. The first choice for next trip is still Shangri-La. This time I took the children out to play, and the package included K20 coupons. I took the children to play karting, and I was very happy. Yi Coffee’s breakfast is also very good, with a variety of varieties and good taste. The children eat more comfortably. This is a good travel experience. [Celebrate][Celebrate]

msg:Satisfaction with accommodation🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Epidemic prevention and control safety 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Although it’s been a few days since I went to live in Shangri-La, I still want to come over and comment on this staying experience [强]
Although the epidemic is still happening, business trips have to continue. I have to say that Shangri-La's protective measures are really good. When checking in, look at the green code and enter the door. There is no-wash alcohol. There is also a temperature measurement post. Few hotels in this hotel can do this, either because the location is not suitable, this is also in the central location, the scenery is good, the location: convenient transportation, just a few minutes from the subway, the opposite is ifc, and it’s ok at night Go for a walk by the river! It's so beautiful!
Environment: Generally speaking, it is satisfied. Just entered the lobby. There are a lot of people. Jasper, the guy who is skilled in work and business, arranged for me. The floor view is very good. Generally speaking, Bella Yang was anxious when I was able to leave and gave me a quick check-out. A little sister named Cony Karry saw that I was in a hurry to help save the invoice information and also helped with the luggage to send out. Generally speaking, this time, I will come again next time on business trip. I would like to like the duty manager named Ken [强] for service. It is also very good to help me introduce the surrounding attractions. Parking is free for hotel guests. The hotel’s breakfast restaurant has various types of Yi coffee. The location of the hotel is quite good. IFC and Zhengda Plaza are within walking distance to shopping and eating. It is very convenient.
It is worth mentioning that Shangri-La is more suitable for parent-child travel. There is a special children's center in the hotel. It is free to participate in the hotel. The courses include western food etiquette, bartender, flower arrangement, firefighter experience, go-karting, and so on. The stuck car in Pujiang Tower b2 is very cool!
If you travel with children, Shangri-La feels even better. It is worth recommending a hotel.

On the first day of employment, we already told the front desk that we only need to add water and daily necessities, take out the trash, and do not need to help us clean the bed. At that time, the front desk staff said that there were not enough staff, and basically did not say that they could not clean. , but there is still no cleaning staff to help us clean. There is a problem with uploading and distributing, and the guests’ wishes are not understood.

🍃Environment:
[Moving Night View] I’m a little disappointed that I didn’t get the river view, but the city view is okay too.
The internal equipment of the hotel is still very old hotel style. The hair dryer is locked in the cabinet and can only be used to blow hair in a limited length. It is extremely useless. There are no sockets at the bedside. You have to go to the end of the bed and the desk to play with your mobile phone. Not very user-friendly. Such an old design of a five-star hotel is indeed uncompetitive.
🔔Service: Originally, the most important factor in booking this hotel was because the hotel has a shuttle bus to Disneyland. This was a bonus that I didn’t intend to book. The delivery was in place in the morning and the service was considerate. However, the fireworks light show in the evening started at 915pm. We must pick you up at the entrance of the park at 9 o'clock. When I called to inquire before, I was told that the fireworks and light show would end at 9 o'clock. After many communications, I couldn't postpone the pick-up time, and even paid more money for the driver. I had no choice but to take a taxi back to the hotel.

This time we stayed at the "Pujiang Tower" (this is the "old building"; there is also the "new building" Zijing Tower connected). Although the old five-star brand, the service is still great! The room was also upgraded to the 28th floor by the handsome guy at the front desk, Jimmy, thank you! Perfect Huangpu River view from the glass window of the guest room! It's a pity that the magic capital has a big waterfall!

The 2F of the hotel is the dining area, where "Yihai" Japanese cuisine is used for dinner on the night of check-in! XC hotel room package gift! The restaurant’s products are totally better than I expected! I chose the seafood hot pot (the seafood was all lively when served)! The soup base is delicious kelp soup, so there is no need for dipping sauce at all! The set also includes appetizers (hot spring egg avocado salad, jade tofu, crab-flavored stewed eggs) and meat staples (Japanese-style teppanyaki "lamb chops")! Finally, ice cream is the best after-dinner dessert!

There is also a "Yee Coffee" buffet on the same floor. Breakfast is served here the next day! The retail unit price of 255/person is in the buffet breakfast in the Magic City Five-Star Hotel. The price is considered high-end, and it is worth it to taste! The dining environment is spacious and there are a wide variety of choices, especially the steamed dishes (xiaolong, shrimp dumplings) were later delivered by the chef in a trolley. One by one is suitable for people like us who want to taste everything!

When you travel to Shanghai, your favorite place is staying on the banks of the Huangpu River. It is comfortable to see the beautiful scenery of the Pujiang River no matter it is day or night. The most important hope for traveling with children is one-stop solution, and it is best to enjoy all the happiness of vacation without leaving home.
At the Pudong Shangri-La Hotel on the banks of the Huangpu River, it has a long-standing reputation in the parent-child sector, and I saw many parent-child families when I checked in. The receptionist bella and james Lucy ken at the front desk of the hotel lobby is very thoughtful and meticulous. It feels cordial. This time I stayed in a twin room with Bund view in Pujiang Tower. The invincible view of Huangpu River can be seen from the room.
Because you live on the executive floor, you can enjoy the river view in the Horizon Club Executive Lounge even if you don’t go downstairs to eat from morning to night. I have to praise the Horizon Club Lounge for its goodness and its invincible river view. It offers all-weather food and drink, so you must choose!

The transportation is very convenient. The hotel is located in Lujiazui Financial City, within walking distance to Superbrand Plaza, Jinmao Tower, IFC, and Shanghai Center. It takes 40 minutes by car to Hongqiao International Airport and 1 hour to Pudong International Airport. It's so convenient to go to major online attractions

service:
The two front desk staff, Claudia and Tina, were really nice and patiently introduced the hotel facilities and equipment one by one. From entering the door to finishing check-in, the staff were full of enthusiasm. Moni guided me to the room and something happened in the middle. The episode, but it was resolved immediately, and the service was in place

food:
The breakfast at Yi Coffee on the second floor is very rich in variety and fresh ingredients

facility:
The facilities and equipment have a sense of age, the decoration style of the rooms is quite satisfactory, and the French crystal lamps are generally good.

Stayed in Pudong Shangri-La for the first time, and came to travel with my father.

The beautiful scenery of the Pujiang River during the day and night is beautiful and shining, and there is also a rich breakfast. On days when you can't go out, it's not bad to check in the famous local hotels to see the beautiful scenery around you 👍🏻!

msg:The old hotel, the image was very good before. There may be more new hotels now, the rooms are too small, it is not too comfortable to not be able to open the windows. The air conditioner is louder, and the room is soundproofed. Old hotels are not expensive, duvets are still too hot in summer, and I didn’t sleep well all night, so I really came to spend money to buy it. The attendants in the executive lounge are polite, but some guests are noisy, and the quality of their mobile phones is worrying. The water temperature in the swimming pool on the 5th floor is cold, and the fresh air is estimated to be facing the Zhengda kitchen. The whole swimming pool is filled with the smell of oil and HAO. The image of Yi Café was very good before, and the breakfast was very average. Maybe the material is rich now, or maybe the Chinese dim sums are all quick-frozen, not freshly made. The contents of the order notes do not seem to be seen. Under normal circumstances, whether you are staying or catering, you should never want to go again.

The parking lot of the Pujiang Building is not available and can only be parked to the Zijin Building, but there is a passage in the lobby, so it is not a big problem. Afternoon tea and happyhour can be enjoyed as long as you are staying. There are not too many people, so you can enjoy the scenery and eat leisurely. If the dinner is not demanding, happyhour can solve it. The buffet in the morning is not bad, and the decoration style is very nice. Karting is very fun, and the children's playground is suitable for children, and the overall experience is good.

The view of the Bund Panorama Room is superb. You must manually like Derrick, Nicole, Clara and James at the front desk for the warmth and appropriateness of the two days.

Children always have a wish to live closer to the Huangpu River, so the first thing we think of is Shangri-La. Due to the epidemic situation, the hotel's price is very favorable. We finally ordered the luxurious room in Pujiang Building. To be honest, the price is very favorable. Hotel parking is also very convenient. After the underground garage is parked, use the room phone to call the staff, and parking is free. Thank you Jimmy lydia jack for the warm hospitality of the three hotel staff. I also packed breakfast for us when we checked out. Thanks again! Will continue to support the hotel next time.

msg:It is not advisable to travel to Shanghai during the epidemic, so choose a local hotel and pretend to be traveling.
The reasons for choosing Pudong Shangri-La Hotel are nothing more than its reputation, location, and the services it provides. But what is the actual situation? After experiencing it, I can only say that it is quite satisfactory, with a little regret.

🚗Location and Transportation🚇: Located in the center of Lujiazui, there is Metro Line 2 and the ferry station near the hotel. For shopping, there are Superbrand Shopping Mall and the International Financial Center nearby. In terms of scenic spots, the Pearl of the Orient and Lujiazui itself are places where tourists must check in. Therefore, it is very suitable for couples, tourists go shopping and take photos on dates.

🤵Service🤵‍♀️: Shangri-La Hotel is famous for its service, but the actual situation can only say that it has just reached the five-star standard, but it is not very impressive and impressive. On the contrary, there are some details that greatly reduce the impression. When I arrived at the hotel to check in for a room, I specifically said please don’t give me the corner room, but the service staff said that there are only corner rooms, and the time is around 1:15 pm (normal check-in is 2 o’clock) Start), when I entered the room, the view of the room was very disappointing. I couldn't see the Bund and the buildings of all nations, I could only see the North Bund. I immediately called the front desk, and after some theory, I switched to a room overlooking the Bund. (So it's not that the room is full, but the corner room is arranged first. Those who are not honest will suffer). Secondly, the hotel service staff would not say good morning greetings after seeing the guests in the hotel, and there was no smile on their faces, which made people feel a little bit that this is the service that a 5-star hotel should have.

🏊‍♀️Swimming pool🏊: The swimming pool is not big, but it is better than the city view.

🪟Room view🏠: This time I stayed at Pujiang Building. After changing the room, the room view is really satisfactory. When night falls, the night view of the Bund is panoramic, giving you a feeling of king of world. But remember, don't live in the room at the end of 04, that is the corner room, there will be a wall blocking the view of the Bund.

📺Room Facilities🕰: With the development and opening of Lujiazui, Pujiang Tower’s room facilities will definitely be behind compared to Zijing Tower, but fortunately, it’s well maintained. Generally speaking, the flaws are not concealed. But the shower in the bathroom really needs to complain, a bit too old. It's not as comfortable as the spray at home.

📶wifi📶: Very stable and fast.

🥣Breakfast🍞: I am very satisfied. There are a lot of dishes and a lot of fruit varieties. You can choose from fresh cuts or whole ones. There are also many types of vegetable salads, including Japanese and Western styles. There are more choices of Chinese style, which is very in line with the appetite of the Chinese people. recommend!

[Candy] Cost-effective [spit]: Generally speaking, the flaws are not concealed. After theory, I switched to a room with a nice view and got a more satisfactory experience of staying. Recommend experience stay.

msg:The room is a children's theme room, with the scenery facing the Bund, and you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower. Environment, good location. But I had to complain. The customer service of the whole room said it was a family room. There was no sofa and no sofa. The whole room had only one stool. We were a family of three. One person sat down, and the others either sat on the windowsill or stood. The child’s baby bed is actually a sofa bed. It creaks and can’t move when it turns over at night. After staying for two nights, three people squeezed into a big bed. The fruit was not fresh either. The next day I just added the eaten, and did not give out a complete copy, which caused the fruit to turn black in the afternoon. I can be regarded as a hotel control. I have stayed in so many five-star hotels. I think Shangri-La Hotel does not reach 5 stars in terms of service. The room facilities are not humane. Maybe its standard is a business hotel, which is not suitable for a resort hotel.

msg:Very good experience!
First of all, the location of the hotel is the main reason I booked this hotel. Zijin Tower is only a few minutes’ walk from Zhengda and IFC, and you can find all kinds of food. Then Pujiang Tower is also only a few minutes’ walk from Binjiang Park. Children blowing the river breeze, watching the night view of Shanghai, listening to bars singing, and running along the trail are all great! And the must-visit attractions such as the Oriental Pearl Tower are even closer at hand!
Then I felt very good after check-in. The service was very good. There were people helping with luggage when getting in and out of the car. The room lacked something and the phone would be delivered to the front desk in time. The waiter would bring it to the seat during the meal, and then insert a sign that someone was there. When you bring your baby up late, you don’t have to worry about occupying your seat if you bring your baby for breakfast alone. There are also very rich types of breakfast, which is great!
Then bringing the baby is really worry-free. Our baby is four and a half years old, playing karting, children’s playground, and there are very nice brothers and sisters to play with, and there is a very fun bouncy castle. I also sat and took a look. That's it 😌!

When the time came, I asked the front desk and they couldn't give me the room card until six o'clock in the evening! After many negotiations, I finally got two rooms, and the other one was only available at around 6 o'clock. When I opened the door, I saw that the room was not the Bund Panoramic Suite I booked. I was extremely disappointed and didn't want to negotiate with the hotel anymore. ! Anyway, I won’t stay again in the future.

As a result, the lounge was so crowded that it was like being squeezed into a train station. There were no seats at all. Many people were standing to eat, and every meal and snack came out. Every plate was sold out immediately, and many people were still blocking the door of the kitchen. Many people took lunch boxes and took them to their rooms to eat. The food on the ground was a mess, and the order was once extremely chaotic, like a refugee camp. Some people also ran to the front desk of the hotel lobby and said they wanted to complain and expose it to the media. When I checked out, I discovered that there was an additional fee of 498 yuan during the Spring Festival. It feels like spending money to go to the train station for a day trip.

msg:They use the gimmick of family walks to sell package meals to attract guests, but in fact they are unable to receive a large number of guests using the package. Whether it is check-in, children's playground, executive lounge or room service, they are all overloaded.
I queued for an hour at happy hour, and could only eat stale steamed buns and fried foods. There were not enough vegetables and fresh food at all. By 7 o'clock, there was no orange juice or Coke left. I had nothing to eat or drink, so I had to Eat a few more steamed buns to fill you up.
The voucher for the children's playground can only be used on the day of check-out. In fact, if you don't line up on site early in the morning, you won't be able to play anything at all!
The swimming pool, the only facility without queues, was packed with children like dumplings.
Oh yes, there are also check-in and check-out. I queued in the lobby for more than an hour on the first day, and the room was only available at 4 o'clock. I had to check out before 1 o'clock in the afternoon on the second day, and the children had no place to take a nap! Totally unaccommodating!
Finally, let’s talk about the issue of queuing. It’s understandable that there are many people during the Chinese New Year, but why do all places ask guests to stand and queue? I can not understand! We queued up and waited for nothing, and we didn’t even give them a sip of water! I asked the service staff for water, but they only had ice-cold bottled water!

msg:The receptionist at the front desk answered questions very clearly and patiently and politely. The Shanghai man who greeted me at the door was also very polite and decent. The ladies in room service were very polite and took the initiative to bring water. Thank you very much! There was a tall receptionist in the breakfast area on the second floor who had a weird attitude and was very rude. I came out of the elevator with my child and an elderly couple. The elderly couple was slow to find their card in their bag. I had my card in my hand, so I thought about registering him first and taking my child to dine first. This gentleman angrily said to me, "Please wait in line on a first-come, first-served basis", which seemed to imply that I was jumping in line. It doesn't matter if you wait a while, and we all arrived together so there was no first-come, first-served problem, but his shady attitude made me very disgusted and I must leave a negative review! In addition, the slightly fat man at the luggage check-in desk had a very bad attitude. There was someone in front of me checking in for express delivery, and I was waiting patiently behind. After they finished checking in, I handed him the luggage tag and told him to pick up the luggage. He ignored me and directly greeted the lady next to him who interrupted to get a parking sign. He didn't respond to me at all. Maybe it was because the lady was fashionably dressed, wearing heavy makeup, and not wearing a mask. After receiving this beautiful woman, I finally took my luggage tag and threw it on the counter next to me, and asked a young bellman next to me to pick up my luggage. Even for such a second, he didn't even bother to deal with me, his attitude was extremely bad! Shangri-La can be considered a five-star hotel. Compared with other hotels of the same level, the service is really unsatisfactory. The attitude of the external service staff is perfunctory and shady. It really opened my eyes. I will never stay at this hotel in Pudong again. The service attitude is really impressive. So profound! ! !

Unexpectedly, it was overcrowded, there was a queue for check-in, and the room could not be checked in until very late. There was a queue at the restaurant, and many guests couldn't get in and waited outside, so they had to grab food. Old facilities are not Pudong Shangri-La's strong point, so the service should be better. The most exaggerated thing is that when we got to the room, the power was cut off, and the circuit breaker needed to be tripped and repaired. They parked the car and asked me to go to Mirae Asset next door. There was no place to park in the hotel. The passenger flow during the Spring Festival will be heavy, so your hotel can predict that it only cares about making money and does not care about the interests of customers. This signboard has been smashed. What other hotels are there😅

Check-in would take an hour. The most ridiculous thing was that after check-in, we were told that the room would be cleaned and we still had to wait for another hour. Thinking it was human words, we waited with peace of mind. During the Ctrip customer service period, I kept contacting the front desk and was told that the cleaning had not been completed. When we finished dinner and returned to the hotel at almost five o'clock, there were no guests at all in the lobby. Have they forgotten us, good-natured people? After getting so angry, the lobby manager came to say hello. I was given a room. Fortunately, I am coming from the city. What if I am an out-of-town guest? I'm really speechless 😓 I've stayed at the nearby Jinmao Grand Hyatt and the Ritz-Carlton. Why don't you learn from other people's work efficiency and service? Since we know there will be many guests during the Spring Festival, why don’t we have an emergency plan? Five-star hotels and vegetable markets can compete with each other. I stayed at Shangri-La in Xizang for a week in 2017, and even such a remote store is better than yours! Talking about service, how to provide service? I made a reservation for swimming after breakfast, but the waiter actually forgot and did not help make the reservation. In the evening, I took some photos at the consumer and tea place. A little girl came to me and told my son that this was the consumer area. My son goes to a small international school, and I really want quality education, but I can't help but be annoyed by your waiters. I stayed here for two nights during the Chinese New Year and it will be my last time. I will not recommend it to my friends, including those from out of town.

There were only a dozen people in front of me, and then they stopped moving. There are 4 check-in counters, and each counter can handle a group of people every hour on average. After so many years of staying in a hotel, this is the first time that a check-in procedure takes two hours! There was no explanation from the hotel, so they just asked us to queue like this. Although water and snacks were provided during the period, was this useful? The guest who checked in earlier said there were no rooms, so we were asked to wait! No one from the hotel provided a solution at all. I checked in in the last two hours and only one of the four rooms was cleaned. There was no place in the restaurant for dinner in the evening, so I could only pack some snacks and go back to the room to fill the children's bellies. I woke up early the next day just to avoid queuing for breakfast. Anyway, it was an unpleasant stay. I forgot that the elevator in his house can be pressed without swiping the card. It feels very unsafe!

I booked a hotel package during the Spring Festival, but found that everyone who went there that day had booked a package, and the hotel did not implement the necessary restrictions. I arrived at the hotel at 1 o'clock, but it was not until 5 o'clock in the afternoon that all the rooms were available. Everyone has the so-called executive trea**ent. This leads to a shortage of locations and a situation where supply exceeds demand. The breakfast the next day was also crowded with people, and it was so noisy that it affected appetite. Parking is also the same. There are not enough parking spaces. You can only park in the business building next to it. After checking out the next day, you have to pay the parking fee first and then reimburse it at the hotel front desk. As a result, the cars are blocked at the door. It is really a speechless check-in experience. I can't imagine this. Is it Shangri-La's hotel management level, or is this the level it is now? Compared with other luxury hotels such as Hyatt Mandarin Oriental and Banyan Tree, Shangri-La is advised to leave.

First, there was no parking space; then I had to stand in line for two hours to check in; then I had to wait for an hour and a half for children's slippers and toiletries, which were delivered at almost 11 o'clock. The hardware of the bathtub was not cleaned. Apart from the nice river view, there really isn't much to like about it.

msg:Checking in on the first day of junior high school, I queued for an hour and a half to check in. After queuing, the guy at the front desk said we would have to wait an hour for the room to come out. Although the problem was solved in the end. But clearly oversold. Very bad experience. The reception capacity has not kept up, and the administrative staff are full of aunts who just sit down and never leave, eating snacks for dinner. Extremely noisy. You don't need to look at the room card when entering or exiting, and you don't need to ask about the room. The security is poor and the service is totally lacking.

msg:The worst hotel experience I have ever stayed in recently. Check in at noon on New Year's Eve. The queue to check in at the front desk lasted a full hour and a half. I saw so many people making reservations in the backend of the hotel. Shouldn't there be more staff to handle the check-in? Then queued for the whole hour and a half and no glass of water was provided. Wearing a mask during the current epidemic is very boring. There was no air conditioner or hot water in the lobby. I didn’t dare to leave and there was only one person there, otherwise the queue would have to start all over again. The experience is very poor. Then there are people everywhere. Everyone eats. Afternoon tea for everyone. Everyone swims. Stayed for three days and two nights. There is no queue for swimming. There are ten+ rooms waiting forever ahead. The child returned disappointed. The hotel has no emergency plan at all. The check-in experience was very poor. Unfortunately, the video failed to be sent if it was less than five seconds long.

Afternoon tea in the executive lounge, regardless of administrative trea**ent or not, you can come and go at will, no one will manage you. There was a lot of fighting for food and seats, and it was a mess, like a refugee camp. The breakfast was overcrowded, no one took a seat, no one poured tea or coffee. The layout is unreasonable and you have to walk 50 to 60 meters to get food. There are few types of food, and most of them are carbohydrates. In addition to eggs and milk, protein is rarely found in fish and meat.

msg:I booked two rooms before the Spring Festival, but I didn’t know they were in two buildings at the time. When I checked in, I asked to be in one building. The super deluxe room in Zijin Building was 1789 yuan and it was changed to 1338 yuan in Pujiang Building. There was a difference of several hundred yuan. Knowing that instead of making up the difference, they deducted a few hundred dollars more from me. I called the hotel to negotiate, and if the hotel bit me and signed it, it was deemed as consent. I told the hotel that the big room was changed to a small room and finally charged me a few hundred yuan more than the big room I originally booked. How could I agree? This is too unreasonable. If you had made it clear to me at the time, how could I have changed it. Looking for Ctrip customer service to coordinate, the attitude is very good, and the compensation is more than 100 yuan, what else can I do, I feel a little dumb eating Huanglian. Finally, I would like to talk about the breakfast on the first day of the new year. It is known as the breakfast of more than 200 yuan. There are thousands of people on the scene. Not as good as a 3 star hotel. There are a lot of hotels in Lujiazui with river views, so I won't be staying in Shangri-La in the future.

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first, the geographical location is superior, the central area of Lujiazui, not long-winded here! The layout of the lobby and rooms is a bit imitating the cultural east, but the vegetation and flowers in the lobby are a few blocks away! The breakfast is quite satisfactory, basically everything that should be available, the bedding is good, and the toiletries are good. Focus on the hotel’s shortcomings: 1. The waiting time for CHECK IN is too long. I feel that the front desk staff is not very familiar with the business. They have not been able to vacate the room for the guests after 2 pm, and the service is indifferent until I am here. The room was only arranged after the front desk protested loudly! I hope that the hotel will study the service concept of the Oriental culture well. 2. Since it is a hotel with a vintage, there is no matching bag for the bathroom bathtub, and I called the room service center to inquire, no reply! Being a five-star hotel is really wrong! 3. The hotel swimming pool is not equipped with a swimming ring, which is too economical as a five-star hotel, right? ! 4. The front desk is unreasonably set up. Check-in and check-out should be separated. As a result, there is a long queue for check-in and long queues for check-out. Is this the sense of service? Negative Ratings! Not to mention the service compared with the Oriental Culture, even the service of the Peace Hotel is better than you! In short, Shangri-La Hotel's sense of service failed!

msg:I have stayed in many hotels, but I never like to review them, unless they are particularly good, or like this time it was particularly bad... Before I check out, I must review it carefully before going to bed. Because it comes from true feelings, I was filled with anger for once.
I made the reservation and saw that I could check in at 2 o'clock. I had a good meal nearby and waited until 2:30. However, the front desk said that the room was still dirty and I had to wait for more than an hour. The room card could not be given for the time being, so I would wait until later. Come and get it. I took my two children and the old man with me to take a nap, but it turned out that I had no choice but to go to the car and sleep with the air conditioner on. After storing my luggage, I played around until 9:10 pm when I came to the front desk to pick up my room card. There was no one at the front desk, and there was no one in the lobby who could ask questions. After waiting for a while, I had no choice but to find the hotel phone number from Ctrip and dial. After the call was made, the call was hung up, and no one answered when I called again. Finally, the call was put through for the third time, and I was told to go to the 29th floor to get the room card. You're really teasing me!
He took the room card and told me, my room is not on this floor... I don't know where my luggage is... I'm really vomiting blood! Everything was taken for granted and there was no apology for the inconvenience.
We dragged our tired bodies to the room. Our luggage had not been delivered yet. While we were waiting, we found that the battery of our mobile phone was only 2%. Unfortunately, we did not bring the charging cable with us today. I went to the front desk to borrow a phone, but was told that they had all borrowed it. I asked again an hour later and got the same answer. I said if the guests who checked in early could use it, I could use it. I was sorry and could only wait until the guests check out tomorrow. It can only be returned later...! In desperation, I thought of another way to recharge my phone, just to write this review tonight, otherwise I won’t be able to sleep!
Please note if you are bringing a baby, there is no place for children to play. The so-called amu*****t park next to the 2f restaurant is almost always suitable for older children and charges are charged.
In addition, if you look at the pictures and videos, the water in this shower room is so blocked that you can't even wash your head.
I don’t know what courage I have to support such a five-star brand with such poor service! It is truly one of the worst hotel experiences!
Must give a five-star negative review!

It is also very close to the Oriental Pearl Tower, so I can take pictures at any time. After staying in the newer Zijin Building, there is a "three-piece suit" outside the window of the room, especially the night view is very beautiful. There are windows on three sides of the swimming pool, which is well-lit and very bright. The changing room has a sauna and steam room, and there is also a massage pool. The breakfast is relatively rich, but the taste of individual meals is average, and the meal area is relatively large, which may be due to the connection between the two buildings. Because of the high summer occupancy rate, the front desk service is a bit weak, but the overall service attitude is not bad. The facilities are relatively complete, and you can see the details attentively. My son likes it very much and said that next time he comes to Shanghai, he will stay here.

She did not even look at the guests. She kept her head down and hard at work. She swiped my card and didn't tell me how much money was swiped. What's the way to collect money? Didn't you tell her to the customer? She ignored it and acted as if the customer owed her money. The concierge also has the same bad service attitude. The kind and warm service attitude that should be expected in a five-star hotel will not be seen here. The most shocking thing is that even though I had communicated with the hotel in advance, I almost lost my express ticket, and every time I called the concierge to ask, I had to explain the whole thing again. , asked them if there was no handover? Direct answer no one told me. Ask the concierge about nucleic acid testing and answer directly, I don’t know, go to the hospital and ask yourself. There is absolutely no intention to help guests. I really don't know what the concierge is doing. The room facilities are not bad, the design is old, and the shower room design is very problematic. After taking a shower, the entire bathroom was soaked with water. The sheets also had holes. The only good thing is that the view where I live is pretty good, with the sloping Huangpu River. The location is okay, next to CP and IFC, but a bit far from the subway station. It takes 15 minutes to walk, but I really won't come back. I have never seen a star-rated hotel with such poor service.

msg:Apart from the location, there are so many other options. The hotel is old, has poor sound insulation, and is not clean. Just read other reviews. I will say two things. First, I booked a deluxe double room in the Pujiang Building through Ctrip. When I checked in, I asked if there was a room with children that could see the ship? The front desk promoted a price-increased panoramic room. After I refused, I took my room card and went to the room. I found that it was a room at the end of the corridor on a low floor. The windows were blocked except for the Zijin Tower. Judging from the escape map on the back of the door, this room should be the worst in the entire hotel. The location and the smallest area. Although I booked the most common room type, I was mentally prepared that I might not see the river view, but the city view is not like that. When I went out to eat, I asked to change rooms. Another receptionist greeted me and changed me to a high-floor room with a river view. Although the final result is satisfactory, the process is infuriating. Since customers have needs and the hotel has rooms, should we give priority to customer needs under the premise of the same price and the same room type, and the hotel rooms are all time-sensitive? I would rather Even though the hotel manager arranged for me to stay in the worst room of the same price range, not to mention the hotel star rating and the hotel group, the original intention and service of the front desk were disappointing. Secondly, it is well known that there are many people on holidays, so I was mentally prepared to queue up for breakfast. But early the next morning, after checking the breakfast at the entrance of the restaurant, I was taken directly to another makeshift conference room to have dinner. Looking around, the number of dishes was the most three-star. There is a noodle stall, a fruit counter, a Chinese food counter and a Western bread counter, as well as three kinds of drinks: milk, orange juice and coffee. Halfway through the meal, I went to the restaurant to take a look, and found that the types of food served in the restaurant were completely different from those in our conference room. That one was called a breakfast buffet, while ours was called a coffee break at most. Although there were many people inside, some people were leaving after finishing their meals. , when I came out, I saw three or two people queuing up at the door of the restaurant, and some new guests were continued to be taken to our conference room to eat. One after another, guests expressed their dissatisfaction, and I also heard the hotel staff discussing this method of handling in private. inappropriate and understanding of guest dissatisfaction. I don’t know how the front desk of the restaurant screens the guests who go to the conference room to dine, or they are randomly selected without distinction, but is it unreasonable to operate like this when there is no long queue at the entrance of the restaurant? It is understandable that the hotel is considering the diversion of personnel, but should it still seek the opinions of guests and inform them that the number of meals in the conference room is very small? Instead of just taking the guests to the conference room to sit down, the hotel didn't even let the guests know when there were more dishes in the restaurant, or the hotel simply didn't want the guests to know what the restaurant's dining rate was. In fact, none of us have ever stayed in a hotel. This kind of meal rate is not at the level of a star-rated hotel. Even if we tell the guests: Although your location is in the conference room, you can also go to the restaurant and enjoy the meals there. Taste. It will also be much more appropriate than the fact that guests go to the restaurant one by one and discover on their own that there is a huge difference in the food. For me, although I arranged to have a meal in a restaurant after seeing other guests strongly requesting it, after the reservation experience the day before, I no longer want to fight for anything. If the service of a five-star hotel requires customers to fight for it, Isn’t that putting the cart before the horse if you won’t be treated differently? It’s too chilling. Of course, this is not just a personal problem at the hotel front desk, it can be a problem of early warning of large passenger flow in the hotel, a problem of hotel diversion emergency response, a problem of personnel training and service, and ultimately a problem of hotel culture and management. Since this is the case, I think I will definitely not choose it again in the future.

Except for the better location, you don't have to put too much hope in other aspects. The whole process is "self-service" from the time you check in. You have to wait a long time to get something delivered. I'll give you the bad review!

During the period, there was a special person to lead the seat, serve the coffee, close the market, and the service was in place. When I left, I asked my brother to take a cup of coffee. My brother immediately brought two cups of coffee and warmed my heart.
After eating, you can go to the riverside to digest. The riverside scenery of the jogging trail and cycling trail is so beautiful.

msg:I checked with Ctrip to confirm the twin bed and check in at three o'clock. When I said I had a room, I went there. It turned out that the rooms started coming out one after another at five o'clock and six o'clock. .

msg:The overall feeling is very good, we live in the Pujiang Building and can go to the executive lounge. The afternoon tea and happy hour in the Shangri-La Executive Lounge are still very satisfying to me. The meals for the two days are different, and the quality of the products is also very high. Children especially like happy hour pasta. On the first day, the cheese-baked tomato hollow noodles are already very satisfying, but the second day’s cheese-baked butter butterfly noodles are more delicious. The drinks are also relatively complete, and I hope to extend the serving time of alcoholic drinks. The hotel swimming pool is very clear and the water quality is good, but it is a bit cold. The water at 28 degrees Celsius would be better if the temperature was increased a little bit. The room facilities are not so advanced, but the sense of luxury is still there. I also hope that the karting project on the second floor can continue to expand. A good project is that the place is smaller. The overall feeling is very good, all the waiters are very good, I will choose this hotel if I have the opportunity

msg:Why is there someone at the front desk who can't speak English? Everything was so slow. It took 30 minutes to call someone to fix the broken air conditioner, and we were told to wait in the cold room for 3 hours until it was fixed. It was strange that we asked to change rooms, and we had to wait an hour to change rooms, which took hours.
Service is not what you would expect from a luxury hotel.

msg:During the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, come to Shangri-La Hotel
I thought I didn’t have much parent-child content, so I could just eat, drink, sleep and sleep!
Unexpectedly, now Shangri-La has done a lot of homework for parent-child travels 😄

For example, K20 activities are quite rich
There is a small playground for children, as well as the activity of making dumplings for the Dragon Boat Festival.
The children are having fun and can bring hands-on skills!
The child is very happy to eat rice dumplings~~
The staff are very enthusiastic, very happy to spend two days and one night~

🏨The hotel swimming pool is clean and the facilities are good~ I like it😻

😊Breakfast is abundant, and Happyhour in the Horizon Club feels like dinner in the evening, so it’s solved dinner😁
Can also enjoy the night view🌃

msg:It coincides with the Dragon Boat Festival and the double festival of the 10th anniversary of the marriage of friends. On such an important day, two guest rooms with administrative courtesy were booked in Pudong Shangri-La. The facts proved that the choice was extremely correct. The most important thing is to thank the hotel Jimmy Wilson and Jack for their careful arrangements, which surprised us and made our friends happy for a long time. It also made us feel that the hotel treats guests as family members. Let’s talk about the hotel itself. The location is excellent. It’s only 5 minutes away from the business district. You can ride on the riverside downstairs. The swimming pool is open until 11pm. The executive breakfast and dinner are also rich in variety. The fruits are seasonal and there are few people and scenery. Well, there is a karting for 88 yuan for 10 minutes on the second floor of the ba*****t, which can be played by children and adults, and the price is affordable. In short, an unforgettable experience.

msg:Originally we were planning to park in the underground parking lot, but the entrance was blocked by an online car-hailing car and there were also roadblocks blocking the way. So we found an empty spot on the ground, and when we parked, we all got off the car. A staff member came over and said that we had to park in the underground parking lot! Said there was a wedding car in the afternoon? Other cars can stop if you are in a hurry. Is there only one parking space left for us? ! We still drove on very cooperatively, but we didn't know that the parking lot was full and the parking lot was old and shabby. I searched for a long time and spent half an hour. Find a temporary location to park. Another staff member came and told me to leave a number because it was parked on the driveway...
I dragged my luggage upstairs tiredly and walked for a long time to the front desk. There was a long queue in front of me and I waited for another half an hour.
The room facilities are very old, and I only found out before going to bed that the upholstery on the bed was torn. The repairs were too careless. While waiting to take a shower, I smelled a faint smell of urine in the bathroom...

msg:A great experience and convenient location
It took more than four hundred to upgrade Jiang Jing on the 24th floor. It’s really worth it. I also gave a set of L’Occitane washes.
The administrative corridor throughout the day has nothing to eat but good drinks. Happy hour, there is nothing left when I go to late. The administrative corridor is on the 21st floor with a panoramic view of the Bund and the Oriental Pearl Tower.
For breakfast, you must go to the second floor. Many counters are very hearty and make up very quickly. However, the stomach is too small to eat.

msg:I didn’t go anywhere to play in Shanghai during the Dragon Boat Festival. I was thinking about the high saturation of the hotel during the holiday and I was worried about the service problem. I seemed to think too much. Except that the parking space was harder to find, everything else was fine. The check-in was also a bit lined up. , It’s fast, and the temporary upgrade is good. It’s not expensive. The meals in the executive lounge are quickly replenished and the taste is good. The Chinese food here is much better than Jinmao. The service staff are very diligent and polite, and the drinks are good. They are all rich. Recently I have been in the hotel twice a week in Pudong. This is probably the best service I have ever stayed in. It is not cold, humane, and the swimming pool is also very comfortable. The lady has a dry steam hot water massage pool. There is a shopping mall on the opposite side of the road. We are just across the road when we reach the river. We are in Pujiang Building 1 this time, with two large and one small meals. Breakfast is much richer than the Peace Hotel, and I don’t know much better than Jinmao’s service number, foreign nationals. The staff are very hardworking, the food is really okay, it is recommended to check in, it is also very convenient when checking out, and I took a round of shopping malls to go home, which is equivalent to two days and one night in Pudong, next time I will stay at the hotel Whether it is the front desk, waiter or cleaning aunt, the concierge is worthy of recognition and praise.

msg:Although it is an older hotel, it has a beautiful view of the river. The riverside is at your feet. It is convenient for walking and sightseeing. The most prosperous scenery in Shanghai is unobstructed. The buffet breakfast of Yi Coffee is comfortable and rich in variety. By the way, Yi Coffee’s buffet dinner Even more exquisite

msg:An absolutely good hotel, one side is close to the Huangpu River, and the other side can see the highest building in Pudong. My little brother helped me upgrade my room to the 35th floor of the Zijin Building. You can see the Shanghai Center, Global Center and Jinmao Tower when you open the window. , Great!

msg:I made an impromptu decision to stay in a hotel and booked a room with a river view. I checked in at around 9pm. From the underground parking garage to the check-in area, no one answered me, and no one came to take my temperature. The receptionist at the door only looked at people who came in through the gate. The person who checked in from the ba*****t did not take the body temperature. After checking in, because I had booked a panoramic view of the Huangpu River, when I checked in, I was told that twin rooms and double rooms were randomly selected. The check-in staff did not ask me which room type I wanted. I had a child. A family of three needed a double room, but the check-in staff gave me a twin room without asking. When I entered the room, I saw two small beds, which I couldn't sleep on. I asked to change rooms again, and waited for half an hour. I was sleepy. I felt normal from the moment I checked in. After changing to a double bed room, the shower head in the bathroom was broken and leaked. It splashed into my eyes when taking a shower. I was speechless. It was advertised as a five-star hotel, but the facilities were not as good as those of a fast hotel. I was very speechless. The only good experience was The breakfast service staff thoughtfully arranged the baby chair for the baby and wiped the table of the baby chair. I like this. Anyway, the experience of this stay is very average, not like the experience of a five-star hotel.
