msg:We came here because there is a barbecue grill. The overall environment is not bad and the service attitude is very good. In addition, there are really a lot of mosquitoes. The hotel provides mosquito repellent liquid and Liushen floral water, but it is recommended that those who bring children or those who are prone to mosquitoes should bring some mosquito repellent products by themselves. Be sure to bring some!

The surroundings of this B&B are quiet, and the local dishes cooked by the chef are very suitable for the elderly. The facilities in the room are very easy to use, and the elderly can push wheelchairs to travel, which is basically barrier-free. Living in the scenery of the countryside, but enjoying the quality of a city hotel, very good, recommended

I specifically praise a male staff member wearing glasses and a long-haired lady at the front desk. They are very kind to children and have a strong sense of service. I hope that the greening design can be strengthened, as well as the control of non-staying guests entering the farm at will. * Guests can be proactively informed in advance that there is a barbecue grill that needs to be reserved in advance.

The store also helps to light the fire, and barbecue and watch the stars at night. It's a pity that there are few supporting facilities, and it can be a very bad leisure.

msg:When you see the farm from a distance, it is very unique and feels very special. The parking lot is right next to it, so it's convenient to get things if you drive by yourself. As soon as you enter, there is a large lawn with small swings, seesaws and a small football goal for children to play. The staff at the farm are very warm and polite, giving people a very close feeling. When checking in, I was given handicrafts and asked about the time for breakfast the next day. Then welcome fruit and nut snacks, etc. were prepared in the room in advance. The environment of the room is also very good, with a small balcony and terrace for barbecue. It is equipped with a barbecue grill, so you have to prepare the ingredients yourself. The Smart Xiaocheng in the room is very smart and can control all lights, curtains, air conditioning, etc. in the room. The room is also equipped with 2 bottles of Perrier, 2 bottles of Coke, and 4 bottles of mineral water, all of which are free to enjoy, which is awesome! ! When we checked out this morning, we were given handmade rice and dried plums as gifts, and they sent us off very politely. Five-star praise! It’s really suitable to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city and embrace nature ~ I will continue to come here next time when spring comes and the flowers bloom!

msg:A super vacation experience that satisfies all the imagination and needs of mysophobia and Buddhists! Sitting in the room facing the landscape with floor-to-ceiling windows, sitting on the balcony and barbecue terrace and being completely surrounded by nature, it felt like I had taken over the world in just a few days, and all my anxieties and impetuousness were cured.
The room is really cool, with all the little details, earplugs, bathtub cover, remote control lift table, tri-fold wall...especially the smart guest control. I ask Xiao Cheng to turn on the lights, curtains and air conditioning every day. I'm so lazy that I can't even go to the bedside. No buttons are used anymore (complete dementia).
In addition, the daily breakfast and afternoon tea are very satisfying, healthy and delicious. The two housekeepers are super friendly, communicate naturally, smoothly, sincerely and effectively, and have a capable style of doing things, which makes me very comfortable. We also want to thank the store manager for taking us to the high-speed rail station. Because we couldn't get a taxi, we asked for help at the last minute, but the store manager came quickly. Thank you very much!
The last souvenir is dried plums and rice from the rice harvested in October. I originally disliked how bald the land was, but when I got the rice it produced, I really wanted to cry.

The only suggestion is that we hope to increase publicity. It took a long time to find such a suitable farm for vacation. Officials please give us more traffic!

msg:What a surprise! I didn't have any expectations for my stay in Yongtai. I just wanted to have a barbecue. On the way there, the scenery along the national highway along Dazhang River was very beautiful! When we arrived at the farm, we were even more amazed by the beautiful environment and considerate service. Because of the hot weather, we had to dine in the restaurant at noon. All we had to do was order the meal in advance with the waiter. There was nothing wrong with the meal. The barbecue started at four o'clock in the afternoon, and the breeze from the rice fields and streams was very pleasant. If a group of friends and a group of friends are having a barbecue without accommodation in the suite, the six adults and two children are relatively comfortable. Children can watch TV in the room, blow bubbles on the lawn, and play with rice ears during this season. The farm also offers mooncake making experience, which is quite enriching! You can also experience rice field breakfast on the second day~

msg:無意中刷到的民宿，沒想到入住後充滿驚喜。大樟溪畔的稻田農莊，夜色裏也能聽到陣陣蟲鳴，非常適合帶着孩子來一次鄉野自然裏的短途旅行。躺在房間放眼過去都是綠色的水稻，眼睛和心靈都很治癒，重點是花草那麼多，竟沒有蚊蟲叮咬，給孩子帶的防蚊噴霧最後也沒用上。

停車後店長就出門幫忙拿行李了，送我們到房間，準備的水果也很新鮮，兩位前台人員態度也很温柔友善，在民宿碰到也會主動問好。早餐的時候和短髮工作人員聊了一會，恰恰好的服務態度，有邊界感，沒有過分主動的熱情讓人尷尬。
晚餐和早餐也沒有隨便敷衍，食物乾淨又賞心悦目，離店還送了本地伴手禮，這樣的放鬆的小旅行，讓人愉快。民宿的手作體驗也有幾樣選擇，小小朋友不無聊。
雖然比較偏，離永泰美食街市中心都有段距離，但輕鬆的氛圍會抵消出入的不便，在這就是純粹陪伴孩子和家人。
有不足的話，還是公眾區域較小，因為沒有設定大門和圍欄，私隱性比較差，村裡的住户會散步進來聊天，自駕車會進來參觀。還有房間户外座椅有上個客人剩的香煙盒，浴缸的定位貼沒撕。瑕不掩瑜，希望下一次入住的時候這些都有完善哦。

msg:管家對接快，前台服務員態度好，廚師煮的菜好吃，但是也還是有很多不足:1.環境來説，本想着找個地方靜靜，結果吃飯有村民圍觀，户外坐個鞦韆跟村民孩子並排，衹好讓人，雖然服務員勸退，但私密性休假被破壞了。2.周邊本來就沒有娛樂，想着能夠走走路，結果走路的棧道沒有修理好。3.裝修圖好看不實用，泡茶桌在室內榻榻米，沒有靠枕，直挺挺坐着累，户外又都是蚊子，沒有泡茶桌子，燒烤爐是擺設 ，浴缸後面的簾子私密性不夠，有縫隙，外面會看到，晚上又有燈光射入。

msg:從福州出發一個小時的車程，管家和服務人員都特別有耐心，還沒入住時打電話諮詢態度非常好，因為有小朋友還貼心升級了親子房～入住後體驗很好，因為下了點小雨燒烤衹剩下壯男在户外幫忙烤，孩子們轉移到室內了，還好有榻榻米的活動空間，孩子們都玩的很開心～
主要管家對於住客的要求解決速度特別快，這點非常滿意！想等到秋意濃再去一次～
