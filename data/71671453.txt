msg:The Sheraton is Maoming was “interesting “.  Location wise it’s about an hour away from the station and once you get there . There is really nothing more than another hotel and this one. There’s a beach you can’t swim in and local restaurants in the resort that are over the top expensive for what you’re getting. The views from the hotel room are amazing. Constantly reminding you that there’s no swimming at the beach. The hotel offers hot springs for about 68 rmb p/p, really recommend doing that if you’re daring enough to go there. We initially booked 6 nights but our stay got cut down to two nights , for many reasons . The front desk was super amazing, so was the staff in the restaurant. Oh !about the restaurant the breakfast is limited, but the food was really yummy. I wouldn’t suggest the pizza or pork chop rice . Really not worth the coin. For 750rmb a night, I would think again.

The service of the beautiful girls and handsome guys is very good. When we checked in, we saw that there were children, and they gave them small balloon bracelets with bears. The children liked it very much.
I will come to this hotel next time I go

Zong'e and Xiao Luo, who I met, provided very good service and prepared fruit travel guides for us. The service attitude of the shuttle driver was also very good. When I took the children to the water park, there was always a staff member next to me to pay attention to safety, which was also very good. The scenery of the sea view room and Alice Restaurant is invincible, facing the sea, wearing warm clothes and blooming flowers. It was a very comfortable trip.

msg:Normally, I rarely give a bad review to a hotel, but the Sheraton Maoming Romantic Coast Hotel really disappointed me. The service I could experience was not worthy of the name of a five-star hotel.
First of all, when we first checked in, the hotel upgraded our room type. We were still very surprised at that time. The high-floor sea view suite had a great view! I give a good review here! But the subsequent hotel service was a bit surprising:
1. The hotel's hot spring did not provide towels. The answer was that there were too many people on May Day and they did not prepare so many. You are a five-star hotel, and it is not the first year of opening. Are the facilities for receiving customers not ready?
2. I booked a package with pick-up and drop-off. Before departure, the hotel called me to confirm the scheduled bus. When we arrived at the hotel to check in, we clearly told the front desk that we would also take a car to go out on the day we left. How did we know that when we were going to take a car on the second day, the front desk said that I did not make an appoin**ent in advance, and we had to find the hotel manager to communicate for almost an hour before arranging a car to go out.
3. We left some items at the hotel. After checking the room, the deposit was returned to the account, but no one contacted me to say that we found any missing items. It was not until the evening that we found out and called the hotel to ask them to check that they said they found it. Normally, even if the B&B finds that the customer has left some items behind after checking, they will contact the customer immediately. However, I stayed there for more than three hours from the time I checked out to the time I left the hotel, and I did not receive any information. This is very speechless.
The above feedback is the actual situation. As a senior tourist, I gave the hotel a little advice, hoping that the hotel can improve it and give subsequent guests a better stay experience.

The front desk lady, Ms. Zhong'e, was very attentive and confirmed the arrival time and other information in advance. The only drawback is that there are too few parking spaces at the hotel porch, which is inconvenient to connect when it rains.

msg:I saw the advertisement of Maoming Romantic Coast in the community elevator a few years ago, and I finally came this time.
Miss Li Zong'e at the front desk is very good, the service is very considerate and in place, welcome fruits, children's supplies, medicines, etc. are all prepared properly, and she also gave us a lot of travel suggestions. The hotel facilities are good overall, the hygiene is good, and the cost performance is very high. But because it is a seaside hotel, it is inevitable that some sand will be missed when cleaning.
Several dinners were eaten at the Wyndham buffet restaurant. The young man Jacky Huang was very good. He would ask us if we needed to reserve a seat during the peak dining period, and he would help us grill squid when it was not busy.
The hotel beach is also a must, with a very long coastline, beautiful scenery, and very photogenic. In short, it is highly recommended!

msg:I have never stayed in such a bad Sheraton Hotel. The hotel facilities and decoration are not worthy of the charge of more than 1,000 yuan. It is about the same to charge 300 to 500 yuan. The facade and lobby are not worthy of the well-known brand Sheraton. I thought I went to the wrong back door or something. The waiter's attitude was good. He sent the luggage and took us to the room. As soon as we entered the room, we were in no mood. A musty smell hit us. The room decoration was extremely simple. The sofas on the balcony were also rotten. The worst thing was that the quilt and pillow on the bed also had a musty smell. It felt sticky and sticky to the touch. It felt very uncomfortable. This Sheraton Hotel was only opened a few years ago. It turned out to be like this. We thought it was a fake Sheraton! The supporting facilities of the entire Romantic Coast are also immature. There is only one restaurant for dining. In addition to the sea and the beach, the decoration and supporting facilities of such a hotel are really not worthy of charging such a price! I was scared once and will never come to this place again!

The beach bar can be open later. It was full when I went down late at night. It was very lively~ The parent-child water park is on the Wyndham side, there are more people, and it will be much more spacious when you go to the swimming pool. The overall feeling is not bad

msg:The hotel is in a scenic area and connected to three hotels. The main entrance of the Sheraton is pitifully small. The picture was taken at a wide angle. The main entrance is only four cars wide and the road is one car wide. The lobby is not as good as an express hotel. Check-in is completely invisible. According to the guidance of any reception staff, another nearby Wyndham hotel will definitely beat this place in terms of price and supporting facilities. You have to travel by car, and the hotel is equipped with complete facilities and consistent hygiene style and standards. I took my two children back to the lobby at 12:55 to inquire and told them that we had to check out late because we had not cleaned up yet. The head waiter had a tough attitude and said angrily that there were many tourists in the back and there was no service at all. I would not recommend it.

The coconuts in the picture fell from the coconut trees on the beach. When we got the Sheraton, Miss Cindy at the hotel's front desk was really great and helped us open the coconuts very enthusiastically. Miss Cindy at the front desk was very patient in introducing us to the scenic spots and chatting with us, which brought warmth to our journey❤️❤️

And the lobster has to walk two or three kilometers to eat in that shop at night, which seriously affects my mood of travel. . . It can't be packed, and it's small, but the taste is not good. There is no children's parent-child park that I have never been to, it is too far away. The infinity pool is okay, it was just cloudy that day, and it was too sunny to swim. The hot springs are still good, those bear kids will ruin the a**osphere when they come. There is no facility to wash the sand after going to the beach. The above complaints are all bad places. Everything else is fine except the above. Good is what it should be, and good is worthy of this brand. Generally speaking, I am satisfied.

1. No service at all. I went to the hot spring at 9 o'clock in the evening. For the first time, I was so thirsty that my throat was smoking. There was no waiter and no paper cups to provide. I want to get a plastic bag for wet clothes, but I have to go out to the front desk to get it.
2. The picture above shows the sea view from the room. The sea view room is slightly more expensive. How about the sea?
3. Infinity swimming pool, small.
4. The most excessive and unreasonable thing is that the danger alarm sounded in the whole building at 7 o'clock in the morning, and it sounded twice before and after. There was no need to sleep, and the entire hotel guests were awakened. Asked why, said it was maintenance. I asked the internal personnel again, saying that the workers were not familiar with the operation and pressed the alarm. God, is this something an international hotel can do? Then there was no apology from anyone at the hotel.
This is really the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, no one, the worst

My favorite is the Alice cafeteria on the seventh floor of the hotel. It has a sweeping view of the sea, and you can enjoy the scenery while eating. We took at least 50 photos, all of which are blockbusters. The environment is super good, and breakfast is available At 13 o'clock, there is no one in the country!

Although the hotel is in the scenic spot, you still have to queue up to get a certificate to enter the hotel, and you have to buy a ticket for one more child. Only the seaside is the only place to have fun when you go in. It’s okay to walk outside the hotel at night, there are performances and fireworks to watch.

msg:Facilities: The equipment and facilities are still relatively new. The hotel is connected to Wyndham. My fellow travelers booked Wyndham and said that their room facilities are older, but the sea view room has a better view and more room types to choose from. Two hotels contract a scenic spot. They basically have everything you can think of. The public facilities are common to both hotels (such as parent-child parks, water parks, hot springs, etc.). As long as you stay in these two hotels, the beach is basically free (except eating) For customers, there is an additional charge for entering the scenic spot outside, so there are not too many people during the May 1st period. If it is usually more comfortable, the sand soup is still clean. After all, there are not many people. The only disadvantage is that there are relatively few trash cans on the beach , we walked for a long time throwing garbage.
Hygiene: not bad
Environment: very nic (I went to the first beach in China, a strong contrast. There are many people, the beach is sp**** and messy, there is a lot of garbage, and dumplings are served in the sea, this is the first time I have seen it)
Service: There is a lady named Wang Chenchen at the front desk. She is very nice and always greets me with a smile. On the first day I came here, I had a rhinitis attack. I asked her how to get to the pharmacy. She still remembered when I checked out and asked about my rhinitis. Is it better? Although it is a small thing, but thinking of so many customers on May Day, she can still remember it, and she is a little touched.

The breakfast is seven There are many varieties of restaurants in the building, and the taste is good. The auntie in the room is also very gentle. The hotel also has charging piles. The facilities and equipment are very complete. It is worth coming and staying again. Recommended👍

msg:On the second night of my visit to Maoming, I chose to stay at the Sheraton on the Romantic Coast. After all, it has not been long since it was newly opened and it is still close to the beach.

Facilities: The hotel will open in 2021. The hardware is worthy of praise. The sound effect of the bathroom is very good, and the sound of the TV is very clear; the shower equipment is also good, with stable water pressure and soft water; the bedding is not flawed, and the pillows are full of elasticity. The most fly in the oin**ent is that there is no coffee machine. As a 1000+ room, if the room cannot be equipped, it can be placed in the hall.

Hygiene: The sanitation is very good. I have touched the blind corners of the eyes, and it is basically dust-free. The mop is also soaked in disinfectant, and the bathtub has no water marks.

Environment: There is nothing to say about the environment. It is close to the coast and has beautiful scenery. Standing on the balcony at night, you can see the twinkling lights of fishing boats at night.

Service: The service is great. When we checked in, Manager Huang upgraded the sea view room type for free, and asked how to play in the resort, and patiently explained it. Asked about the seafood stalls that the locals go to, he even told us the direction intimately, and will choose to stay in Maoming next time.

I didn’t know until dawn the next day that I was in a scenic spot on the Romantic Coast. The environment was good. , Breakfast is in the very romantic top-floor restaurant, it feels good👍 Later at 9 o'clock, a few people who don't look like tourists, wearing police uniforms, are staff dining in the restaurant, it feels weird. Maybe it's me...

The duty manager KIKO in the lobby has a very good service attitude and upgraded our room. The facilities and equipment are well maintained, and the cleaning lady is also very polite. The breakfast arrives at 1:30, which is probably the latest in China. There are many varieties and I am very satisfied.

msg:￼There are 3 hotels in Maoming Romantic Coast Resort￼The high-end resort hotels are Wyndham Hotel and Sheraton Hotel. These two hotels are connected by passages and share facilities such as seaside sky pools. Since the Sheraton Hotel opened in 2021 and has the latest facilities, I chose the Sheraton this time. Staying at the hotel can enjoy the hot springs and other facilities in the Romantic Coast Resort for free. The room is also a standard feature of the Sheraton Resort Hotel, linen, toiletries, etc. The balcony overlooking the sea is very suitable for a drink. The Australian white wine in the room is not expensive, tastes good, and is cost-effective. Recommended! The hotel's breakfast is also great. Next to the infinity swimming pool on the 7th floor, you can have breakfast while enjoying the sea view. The breakfast is rich in variety, combining Chinese and Western, as well as Maoming local specialties such as Laofen and Zhen. The hotel service still maintains the consistent standard of Sheraton, and the lady at the front desk is warm and thoughtful. Next time I come to Maoming, I will still choose Sheraton.

msg:Location: Located in the Romantic Coast Scenic Area, it is suitable for vacation, and it is convenient to drive by car, but you need to enter the scenic area to stay in the hotel, and wait in line with individual tourists to exchange tickets. It is a bit chaotic in the off-season, and it is hard to imagine forgetting in summer.
Environment: It is relatively close to the beach. If the weather is good, the scenery should be beautiful, but it is not a first-line sea view.
Facilities: The facilities are a bit different from those of five-star hotels. The grade is average and the maintenance is average. The sockets of the water heater and floor lamp are broken. It is a bit dangerous to bring children to the desk to boil water without looking after them. The sound insulation of the room is not good, it is as loud as dancing upstairs at 7 o'clock in the morning.
Service: The service can only be said to be improved. I don't know if it is because of the shortage of staff during the Spring Festival. I bought a room + dining package. The check-in waiter was not familiar with the products. I asked how to use the afternoon tea and happy hour. The reply said that I could go directly. There was no obstacle in the afternoon tea, but the happy hour drink said that the front desk did not give it to me. The voucher was issued, and it was successfully redeemed after running back and forth. At 7:30 in the morning, the whole family was woken up by the waiter who rang the doorbell and gave me two bottles of water. I still don't know what happened.
Catering: Catering at the level of a business hotel. First of all, the restaurant is very small. My son said it was smaller than the hotel restaurant in the group tour last time. There are few types of breakfast and afternoon tea. Like charcoal, no one cares if the coffee cup is dirty. The happy hour drinks were replaced by two sodas. . .
Hot Springs: Seaside hot springs, the location is good, but there are few open pools, and two of them are only 20-30 degrees, the experience is average.
Summary: Nearly 2,000 yuan a night package, 500 yuan business hotel experience.

Because I arrived at the scenic spot relatively early, I went to the front desk of the hotel and asked the lady at the front desk if I could check in now. The lady at the front desk has a good service attitude and is very polite. The room decoration is simple and elegant. The bathroom and bathtub are very clean. Standing on the balcony, you can also see the sea. When we checked out the next day, the service staff also took the initiative to ask us if we needed a luggage cart to help us pull our luggage. The service is very considerate, and the check-out is also very fast, without us having to stand there and wait. The scenery in the scenic area is also beautiful, and it is worthy of being a place for Internet celebrities to check in. Strongly recommend!

msg:1. First of all, this hotel is economical, at most a Four Points.
(It's basically the same as the Hanting Express Hotel. The check-in lobby is small, and the breakfast type is also a business hotel level, that is, the space on one wall basically has all the varieties. The mini bar in the room is the kind of Nescafe instant coffee. Stayed for two consecutive nights, only simple towel change and garbage disposal. Quilt folding? Turndown service? No)
2. The hotel's facilities are shared with nearby hotels, and people from other hotels in the hot springs and swimming pools can also come to play. We were also seen serving us in the restaurant in a Wyndham uniform, and the staff probably shared it as well.
3. The Wyndham Hotel is next to it, and the lobby and swimming pool are much larger. (I paid double the price to stay)
4. The so-called sea view room can only be seen in the picture. That's what the customer service said.
5. The so-called infinity pool is a small ***** next to the restaurant. Swim during breakfast and dinner and you are definitely a sight to behold. The wet man in the swimsuit went straight into the restaurant to eat.
A final look at the hotel tableware…

1) The sea view of the sea view room in 2000 during the May 1st holiday turned out to be like this, which is completely unacceptable. However, the service attitude is ok. I changed it to a higher floor the next day, and the sea view is a bit bigger
2) The water coming out of the bathtub is yellow, and it is the same after several times, so you can't take a bath
3) The tickets for the infinity pool were a decoration. The weather was fine on the last day we went there. When we went with our children, they said that they were not open and asked us to go to the swimming pool in Wyndham (which was not open during the stay).
4) The hotel built in 2021 does not have car charging piles and needs to travel far away to charge
5) The entrance is very small, the single lane is hard to find, there is no waiter to guide the way, it is raining heavily, there is no canopy, it is very embarrassing

6) There is no Chinese restaurant in the hotel, and the western restaurant is unpalatable (the group members said), you need to go out to the seafood street to eat, or go to the buffet at Wyndham

In addition to the above shortcomings, the romantic beach is still good. The beach is very white, the scenery is beautiful, and it is very relaxing

Catering: The design of the brunch until 1:30pm is particularly thoughtful, so you don’t have to worry about sleeping in late, or you can have a simple breakfast in your room and then have lunch in the restaurant, which saves you a meal, haha. Although there are not many varieties of brunch, the quality is very good. The fruits include expensive varieties such as strawberry cherries and blueberries, and the strawberries are very sweet. The seafood soup noodles for the hot meal are all fresh and bright shrimp and sixty-six, unequivocal. There are also pork feet and ginger, clear soup belly, etc., which are very good.

Facilities and room types: The twin room can share the bed, which is good for children. The hotel's public facilities are completely shared with Wyndham. We are going to complain about the room type here. Wyndham's sea view room is definitely closer to the sea than Sheraton, and the sea view is definitely more beautiful, but the price of Wyndham's most invincible sea view room is actually the same as Sheraton's lowest equipped garden view room? ? Just because the Wyndham's room is said to be a bit older? And Wyndham's lobby facing the sea is definitely the rhythm of a resort hotel (see Figure 10, that is the Wyndham's lobby), and the Sheraton's front desk is similar to the holiday Inn... In short, I don't mind the legendary room facilities. It is estimated that Wyndham is more cost-effective...

Hygiene: Although it is said to be a new hotel, a little mildew has begun to appear in the bathroom and washbasin of the room... It affects the appearance. There is also a shower room in the hot spring. Although the overall hygiene of the dressing room is good, the walls of the shower room also have obvious mildew spots. , children with cleanliness simply refuse to shower in the locker room...

Hot springs: There are few people and many pools, and the seaside experience is good. This should be praised.

Beach: The ecological environment is very good and the people are good. We dug a lot of hermit crabs and crabs, haha. Although there is no swimming in winter, there is a hot spring where you can dig crabs, and the children are very happy.

msg:After 4 hours of self-driving, I arrived at the Sheraton Romantic Coast Hotel, where the security guards guided the parking space and offered to help with the luggage and praised it. As soon as you enter the lobby, it smells good and makes you forget the fatigue of the journey. Xiao Yang at the front desk warmly received him and introduced the hotel facilities and services. The hotel manager also upgraded us to a full sea view suite, which was a pleasant surprise! The super-large room has double balconies with sea views, and there are two separate bathrooms to avoid embarrassment for visitors and residents. The design is very considerate. The guest bathroom is a multifunctional toilet with flushing and drying functions, which is very advanced. The room is presented with fresh seasonal fruit plates every day, which is very good. The best view is the Skyline Swimming Pool and Alice Western Restaurant. The varieties and products of the breakfast are good, and they can be eaten until 1:30 in the afternoon. This is the latest restaurant I can eat. While tasting the food, looking at the sea from afar is refreshing. The hotel is very new, every employee I met was smiling and polite, and the hotel service was commendable. In short, staying in the hotel, you will not regret it, come again next time!

缺點是蚊蟲蝨子太低，尤其是蚊子太可惡。望海温泉強差人意，温泉區無論是毛巾、茶水供應都不到位，更不會有零食水果供應，温泉池水衞生欠佳，池邊有青苔，最失望的是温泉水温度低，根本不熱，沒有泡温泉的感覺。海鮮城餐飲服務員態度一般，出品一般，性價比一般。

msg:第一個差評送給您了
房間沒有致命傷，衹是不值。
本以為買到700一晚的券算賺到，沒想到住出了經濟型酒店的感受，贏的最終還是資本的力量。
酒店可能是温德姆一棟副樓改造的，酒店內缺乏康樂設施。如有需要請到旁邊温德姆使用？那為什麼不住温德姆呢？
房間配套洗漱用品與經濟型酒店一致，外貼喜來登標簽紙，也是第一次遇到這樣的操作。
沙灘大，海水黃黑色，禁止下海游泳，可能也是保護遊客的一種方式，畢竟沙灘旁邊看到兩個大排水口，旁邊有一些死魚。工作人員説這是酒店生活用水。
酒店在景區內，景區佈景審美讓人不敢恭維。吃飯貴而難吃，除了景區內吃，沒有更多其他選擇。加上網上較多的廣告，讓人覺得景區和酒店衹想做一鎚子買賣。

酒店有温泉♨️熱天沒什麼人泡，温泉水很乾凈，池子多，舒服，推薦。

msg:比較失望！衝著喜來登的品牌去的，但是與期望相差太遠了。
價格：性價比低，我們是淡季去的，花了快900¥，住了一個最多值300¥的“海濱度假”酒店。
房間硬件：裝修簡單，完全沒有喜來登的高檔品牌形象。
早餐：還比不上我們之前在粵西其他200¥多一晚的酒店。
服務態度：還是可以，也沒特別打交道。
衞生：還過得去，但温泉的水沒有每天換，所以我們也沒泡。

msg:總體來説收費高於自身水平的酒店，中規中矩，先説建議改進的點
服務：前台和客房都有工作敷衍的現象，但不是全部人，整體尚可。例如辦理入住時候問酒店是否有spa，明明温泉入口就在前台的大廳另一側，前台人員還是打電話去問。等了五分鐘之後才想起來要走過去問，我們不願意再等，告知問出結果後請打電話回客房告知，此後前台並沒有打電話。另一次詢問門房人員附近是否有滑滑梯，告知需要走到海灘另一邊，走幾分鐘就到了，結果走了十幾分鍾仍沒有找到。後來發現温泉中心進門就有滑滑梯和海洋球。此行住了四天，第二天的客房服務衹倒垃圾和更換毛巾，連床鋪都沒有收拾，可能該小哥認為自己是在民宿工作吧。其他幾天的客房服務打掃衞生還是認真的，但拖完地之後房間裏黴味更重，下一條細説。希望酒店加強對配套設施這種最基本的訊息的培訓，以及加強員工的責任意識。
客房設施：因為訂房較晚衹訂到了園景房，房間進入後發現枕頭黴味很重，小長假第一天入住的，晚上洗澡時熱水放了半個多小時都是黃色的，之後才是清水。下雨天走廊會有漏水，非頂樓。明明是去年開張的酒店，設施保養有待改進。作為海灘酒店，房間不提供塑料拖鞋，沒有小孩子挖沙的工具，也沒有海灘回來可以充腳的地方，整體設施都比較粗糙了。
飲食：酒店餐廳名聲大於實質，早餐種類不多，肉的方面甚至不是每天都有香腸。前台號稱早餐到1點結束，12點半到餐廳已經衹能點餐了。且另一天晚上到餐廳，工作人員表示點餐後需要等待1小時才能上菜。值得稱讚的是牛奶使用了純牛奶，水果種類比較豐富，且品質較好。然而四天中兩天都有腸胃不適的情況，推測有一天的紅薯可能沒蒸熟，另一天不太確定是酸奶or其他食物的問題。

衹能説茂名的海灘條件和海鮮產出都是不錯的，可惜這塊區域兩個酒店都沒有充分開發利用。
對後來人的建議：由於價位差別不大，建議訂不到喜來登海景房的情況下，建議選擇温德姆的海景房而不是喜來登的園景房，因為温德姆的評價也是房間黴味重，但相對來説房間朝向更好。

msg:🚗 交通：疫情防疫原因，節假日景區門口會比較擁堵

🧹衞生：衞生很好

🍃環境：給後來訂房人建議，豪華海景基本都是在4層，精緻海景在5～6樓，區別衹是能看到海的視野大小（4層被很多樹擋着）

🔔服務：非常好的服務質量，不愧是喜來登的品牌

房間硬件：房間佈置簡潔，給人很是舒適的感覺。隔音略差一點，包括房門外拖鞋聲，樓上小孩蹦跳聲，沙灘餐吧晚上的唱歌聲，可能房間內太靜，這些聲音都能聽得見，室內空調風扇聲音比較明顯，但衞生間排氣扇基本沒有聲音（一度懷疑有沒有排氣扇:-D），電視機聲音不大，一旦調大音量，衞生間內的“小音箱”就成了Disco

有無邊泳池和温泉，早上自助早餐也很好出品也很精緻服務更不用説，上面的硬件問題其實衹是雞蛋裡挑骨頭，哈哈，總體來説是很適合度假的一個酒店，有機會還會再來的！
