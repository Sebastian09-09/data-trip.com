msg:We booked this hotel due to the great reviews on Trip.com and we’re not disappointed. Our concierge Evan 小尹 upgraded us a room with a much better view from our room of the sea and the hills. He also checked in with us regularly to ask if we needed any assistance throughout the trip. Bedding was super comfy and room was spacious. The trip.com description and photos of the room were on point. Location was great, located next to Haitian Mall and close by to the 3rd bathing beach area. Would come back again!

msg:It was our first time in Qingdao, and we really enjoyed our stay at 青岛海天大酒店 :) 

We initially booked a sea view room with twin beds for our trip. Upon reaching the hotel, we asked Crystal Zhao, our hotel concierge on whether a room with a king bed was available. She then readily helped us to arrange for a better room with a king bed. 

It might have been a coincidence, but the room number that Crystal assigned us also matched my birthday and that made it more special! Throughout the stay, crystal also checked in on us via WeChat daily, and arranged for gifts and fruits to be sent to our room.

Service was top notch, the room was clean, and we had an amazing view. Thank you!

msg:Haitian is not my first hotel that I stayed arriving into Qingdao. I stayed at the Westin and Shangri-La. By far, Haitian is the best hotel that I’ve experienced over these 3 hotels. From checkin to the rooms and amenities. Jack was the one checked me in. Service was excellent. He has given me all the information upon checkin and also he has kept me informed on the weather and making sure I had a comfortable stay. I really did have a great stay at this hotel and will definitely recommend to my friends in the future.  Keep the great work Jack. Thank you for making my stay a memorable one.

msg:My stay at the Qingdao Haitian Hotel was nothing short of excellent, with every aspect of the experience exceeding my expectations. The customer service was truly exceptional, standing out as a highlight of my visit. A special mention must go to an employee named CC from reception. Her attentiveness and dedication were remarkable; she ensured that everything was taken care of smoothly and promptly responded to all my questions in English, demonstrating not only professionalism but also genuine care for guests. This level of service significantly enhanced my stay, making the Qingdao Haitian Hotel a place I will undoubtedly choose again in the future. The hotel's commitment to providing an outstanding guest experience is evident, and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Qingdao.

我在青岛海天大酒店的入住体验堪称完美，每一方面都超出了我的期望。客户服务确实异常出色，是我此次访问的一大亮点。特别要提到的是接待处的一位名叫CC的员工。她的细心和奉献精神非常令人印象深刻；她确保一切都得到妥善处理，并且用英语迅速回答了我所有的问题，这不仅展现了她的专业性，还体现了她对客人的真诚关怀。这种服务水平显著提升了我的住宿体验，使青岛海天大酒店成为我未来无疑会再次选择的地方。酒店致力于提供卓越的客人体验，这一点非常明显，我强烈推荐给任何计划访问青岛的人。

msg:I've been to several other hotels in Qingdao, but it was the most satisfying hotel. 
First of all, I would like to thank ☺️Crystal Zhao. ❤️❤️❤️She continued to let us know and help us through WeChat during our stay. She also accommodated our special needs and assigned us rooms on the highest floor. Also, knowing that it was our anniversary, decorated the rooms beautifully. Also, it was useful to send information on nearby tourist attractions and good restaurants through WeChat. Basically, the service and mindfulness of are excellent.

1. Location: The location of the hotel is really nice. There is an ocean right in front of you, so you can take a walk in the morning and evening. At night, the light shines on the surrounding buildings, so the night view is beautiful. The nearby tourist attraction is not far away, so you can take a taxi in about 10 minutes. 

2. Room Condition: The room is clean as it is a new hotel. I used it well because there was an air purifier. The amenities are sufficiently set up. It is convenient to control the curtains and lights.

3. Breakfast: It was nice to have a meal while looking at the sea at the restaurant, and I could eat Chinese and western styles. The instant noodles and huntun were delicious. It was convenient to make coffee and bring it to me right away.

4. Swimming Pool: I liked the swimming pool the most in this hotel. It was comfortable because I could swim while looking at the sea and there were not many people. 
The people who work in the swimming pool are really nice. I asked them to take a picture because I was alone, and they were willing to take it, so I appreciate it.

If I come to Qingdao again, it is a hotel I want to come back to.👍👍👍

msg:Relatively new hotel. Room was spacious and clean, appreciated that it had a bath. Some English spoken by staff, which is increasingly a rarity at even five star hotels in China. Breakfast restaurant had nice views over the ocean and lots of seating, food was decent quality but choice rather limited. The “sea view” room was actually more a view of the tower block opposite, which was disappointing, but you could see the ocean/beach if you stood right by the window. While the hotel is right by the sea, there aren’t many good restaurants nearby and it’s a good 20 minute walk to any of the sights (nearest being May 4th Square). Required a large deposit at check-in, despite having paid in advance, and charge for minibar items, which is very old-fashioned approach for a new hotel. Smell of cigarettes in the corridor was unpleasant, so assume some rooms aren’t non-smoking, which is a shame. The room was very hot, unfortunately the aircon was not very effective at cooling the room down, and noisy, so had to turn it off in the end. The air purifier in the room was appreciated. Lots of free mineral water provided, which was also good, as some hotels only provide 1-2 bottles. Overall, a very good hotel which - with some minor improvements - could be a great one.

From the moment we arrived, every detail of our stay was meticulously catered to. The check-in process was a breeze, and it was clear that the staff here prides themselves on ensuring guests feel welcomed. Our room was a testament to comfort and cleanliness, meeting the high standards you'd expect from a luxury hotel.

What truly set our experience apart, however, was the outstanding customer service provided by Ms.Fan and her team. Ms.Fan provided invaluable assistance in recommending local dining spots and must-see attractions, which significantly enhanced our visit to the city. Her knowledge of the area and understanding of our interests demonstrated a level of personal attention that is increasingly rare to find.

I cannot thank Ms.Fan and the team enough for their hospitality and for making our stay at Qingdao Haitian Hotel such a memorable one. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Qindao China, whether for business or pleasure. It's not just a place to stay; it's an experience that contributes to the fond memories of your trip.

Thank you, Ms.Fan, for your unparalleled attention to detail and the genuine care you show to your guests. We look forward to our next stay at Qingdao Haitian Hotel!

Upon arrival, I was immediately given a room upgrade - providing me with one of the most beautiful dual scenic views of the sea and the mountain range dotted with red roof tops of the city. As a foreigner, I was quite happy that the front desk was very accommodating. Alice Bu and Aimee Lin immediately helped me with my phone apps in booking tickets to the Naval museum and finding scenic spots. Aimee Lin was most helpful in pinging me locations/addresses on my phone for taxis to ensure easy travel around the city. She also checked in regularly with me to see if I needed water or any other service. Top notch service! Ashley Zhang was also helpful. The breakfast buffet was quite nice but the dinner buffet was the best with a grand selection of fresh and exotic seafood and other fare. There was this amazing ginger tea infused with brown sugar and the team leader gave me a big take-away cup to enjoy in my room. Oh, and there was plate of fruit in the room every day! I cannot say enough good things and will be back.

msg:The hotel has just opened for two years and the rooms are very new and well maintained! The service is responsive and the staff is friendly. It is actually the building next to the tallest building and the lower-end version of the St. Regis by the same owner! The price-performance ratio is really good! The gym is very large and the swimming pool has a full sea view for adults and children! The viewing platform ticket included in the package is also worth it! When the weather is good, you can see the golden scenery of Qingdao! I hope the hotel can continue to maintain it, and the hygiene of the public areas can be more meticulous and perfect. It is super comfortable to run on the beach downstairs. It is a 10-minute walk from the subway. It is recommended to take a taxi to the scenic spot. The breakfast is rich and it is also a full sea view restaurant. The room audio, spare parts and toilet are all very good, and there are really many details that deserve praise

msg:Spring is suitable for a spontaneous trip. I went to Qingdao with my husband for 4 days and stayed at the Haitian Hotel for 3 consecutive days. The hotel facilities are very new. From the first day of check-in, Miss Abby was very enthusiastic and added WeChat. She greeted me every day and asked if I wanted to change the spare parts and clean the room. She also told me the weather forecast of Qingdao every day, so that we could add or remove clothes when we went out. It really made people feel at home. This time, I booked an executive deluxe sea view king room. The bed in the room was very large, and the window faced the third bathing beach. It was great to wake up in the sea view every morning. The bathroom is separated into dry and wet, and the window next to the bathtub is also facing the sea. You can enjoy the scenery while taking a bath. After dinner every day, you can go down for a walk to the sea, which is very suitable for parent-child travel. The hotel's all-day restaurant has a rich variety of things, including salmon, langoustines, and red devil shrimps. The small seafood and chicken soup wontons are very delicious. Dinner also gave each person half a small blue dragon, which was very delicious. There is MixC near the hotel, and it is basically one stop away from nearby attractions. It is convenient for eating, drinking and having fun. Next time, I can bring my parents to stay for a few days

The sea is opposite the hotel, and the third bathing beach is across the road. Secondly, after checking in, there will be a one-to-one butler service. The butler Aimee Xiaolin who received my parents was warm and thoughtful. When booking, they left a message saying that the elderly could not rest well and needed a quieter room. When checking in, Aimee Xiaolin took the initiative to help my parents upgrade to a high-rise room with a wide field of view and beautiful scenery. The hotel breakfast is also very rich. You can see the sea while eating breakfast. If I go to Qingdao next time, I will stay at Haitian! The only drawback is that the quilt is a down quilt, which is too thick now! The photos were taken by my parents, and they are all blockbusters!

He helped us solve the problem as soon as we encountered it. It's very good. I will choose here again when I come to Qingdao in the future. If you come, I also recommend it.
We booked a popular room type, which can see the city 🌆 and mountain views, overlook the sea, and see the sunset directly in the room 🌄, and take pictures 📷.
The room facilities are also very complete, smart toilet (with cleaning and warm air), the shower space is also very spacious, the bedding is also very comfortable, and the pillow can be selected as needed, which is also very good.
In addition, the breakfast 🍳 of the 1988 restaurant 🍴 on the second floor of the hotel is not bad. You can eat freshly made egg rolls (egg rolls), small fried dough sticks are also good, and the rest is normal standard.

The former has a reasonable layout and large space, taking into account the needs of changing clothes, placing things, and luggage. The latter is user-friendly and truly intelligent, worthy of its name.
In addition, the service is also very meticulous. The bath salts and loofahs in the bathtub are replaced and replenished daily, and they are taken care of very carefully. Since the first day of check-in, the butler IKE has been online all the time. His patient answers and careful care have added a lot of color to my trip to Qingdao and solved many life problems and difficulties in playing. It was also with the contact of the butler IKE that I completed my first sea fishing trip in my life.

msg:I stayed at the St. Regis two days ago. I saw that Haitian had more than 20,000 reviews. I thought that since it was the top hotel in Qingdao on Ctrip, I would give it a try. After checking in, I found that it was quite different from the St. Regis, especially the management level, which was not at the same level. Because there is a St. Regis high-rise building next to the hotel, the side lake view is blocked. The front desk did not take the initiative to upgrade the room, nor did they give free drinks in the small refrigerator (see other reviews on Ctrip that there is a free small refrigerator), and the welcome fruit basket and snacks were more thoughtful. The breakfast was very ordinary, which was also the biggest difference from the St. Regis. There were a lot of people when I went there, and I felt that the service staff was very insufficient, the dishes were not replenished in time, and the table was cleaned very slowly. There were a lot of dishes, but the taste was very average. The so-called Internet-famous yellow croaker wontons are meat wontons without the slightest yellow croaker taste. While waiting, a male chef who made wontons yelled, and the female chef said that if you don’t want to do it, tell the leader, which is really speechless. The other dishes were also very ordinary, there was no freshly squeezed juice, the fried dough sticks were not delicious, and the noodle stalls did not have any toppings. The lady at the front desk added me on WeChat. The service was quite considerate and she took the initiative to delay check-out. I wanted to give a five-star review and told the lady on WeChat that I would give her a five-star review. But after I said I would give a good review, the lady sent a lot of messages on WeChat asking for a good review. I guess she usually does this to every guest staying in the hotel. The general content was that if I didn’t give a five-star review, it would affect her evaluation. This was a bit speechless. This kind of hundreds of words of words asking for good reviews on WeChat was the first time I encountered. Then I’ll write down my true feelings and evaluation of my stay. The service points were deducted for the breakfast room + the wording of the lady at the front desk asking for good reviews on WeChat. Although St. Regis didn’t have a service butler to add me on WeChat, their service and experience made me want to give good reviews on my own initiative.

From the arrival of the taxi until leaving Qingdao, the service staff are enthusiastic to help with the luggage and provide various help. From the doorman, the front desk, and even the cleaning aunt, they all treat the guests very seriously. It is a real five-star level and I am very satisfied. It is very convenient to take a taxi or bus from the hotel. It is not far from any scenic spot on the beach. You can see the light show when you go downstairs at night. There are various restaurants on the negative first floor of the shopping center next to it. The location is good. The room is large and bright, you can see the sea view, the field of vision is very wide, the facilities are complete, the smart toilet is very good, the shower equipment is great, the water is large and concentrated, and the toiletries are upscale. The bedding is good, the mattress is very comfortable, the pillow is a little low and too soft, there is a sign for choosing pillows next to it, you can change it, we are a little lazy and didn't change it. The breakfast is rich in variety, and Chinese and Western food is complete. Especially the restaurant is by the sea, the space is also large, eat delicious food, see beautiful scenery, a real leisure resort. The only drawback is that the bathroom is open, with basically no cover, which is not very accustomed to. Although the room is large, the bathroom takes up nearly one-third of it, but there is no place to put clothes for washing. It is large but not practical. Although there are many varieties of breakfast, the taste is average, which does not reflect the characteristics and advantages of Shandong, a major agricultural province, and Qingdao, a seafood city. The fruits are bland and tasteless, and there are almost no stir-fried meat and vegetables. The quality of both Chinese and Western food needs to be improved.

There is also a private butler service. Not only did they give me free drinks in the small refrigerator, but they also extended my check-out time. The 24-hour online service is really nice👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻Thanks to Eric for his service👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The hotel environment is also very good. In Qingdao, you can lie down and watch the sunset and the night view of the city by the sea. The view is amazing. The breakfast location on the second floor overlooks the sea🌊Super happy

Think about it and stay in a better hotel
Compare the reviews of several hotels
Finally chose Qingdao Haitian Hotel

The service is very considerate
Something unpleasant happened on the way from the station to the hotel.
The taxi driver took us to a back door that was closed and left us there.
It’s really embarrassing for two girls to have their bags thrown away while carrying two big luggages.
My mother was quite critical at the time.

Fortunately, Sylar and Xiao Zhang were very warm and helpful in the hotel.
Helped me choose a good room
Also provides a lot of surrounding information
Make your mother feel very satisfied
If I don’t have to go to Yantai the next day,
Mom even wants to stay one more night

The seaside greenway is right outside the door, and you can see the sea view. The hotel's Chinese food is also good, and the service is in place. There is a coffee machine in the room, which is my favorite. I have a cup every day before going out, which is comfortable and saves money.

It is the real center of attention! The sea is right outside the hotel, and the breakfast restaurant also faces the sea, which is beautiful.
The software is also super good, and the service attitude is great. In particular, I would like to thank Xiao Shao and Franz. They are very friendly, generous, and responsive. Thank you for your warm hospitality, which made us feel at home. Next time I come to Qingdao for tourism, I will definitely stay at Haitian Hotel. If my friends come to travel, I will definitely recommend such a good hotel to them. It is worthy of being the number one hotel in Qingdao. It is really great👍👍👍

msg:Haitian Hotel is not suitable for family outings. When checking in, the front desk said that it was more likely to host business meetings. If you bring children, you will not choose this hotel again.
When checking in, the housekeeper added WeChat, which was originally a good service, but it did not solve any practical problems in practice.
The extra bed guard reported at check-in was delivered after 1 hour, and the older aunt who combined the beds asked me to work with him, and I could only put the mattresses together, with large hard corners exposed, without considering the safety of children at all.
The executive side sea view twin room ordered should be above the 20th floor, but the twin beds could not be combined. After negotiation, it took 2 hours to move to the 16th floor, and it was reported that only the lower floors had combined beds. The hotel cannot meet the needs of guests and asks guests to choose whether to live in a room with an unsatisfactory bed type or a room on a lower floor.
The meaning of a side sea view room is not to stand in the middle of the room at 45 degrees to see the sea, but to stand in a specific corner of the room to see the sea. It is better to call it a superior room or a twin room, and the sea view is misleading.
The executive lounge does not even have basic meals, let alone meet the needs of children. So I don't understand why there is no point in setting up executive rooms, high floors and lounges. The living effect is the same even if you order the most basic room.
The housekeeper also tried to make up for the various dissatisfactions, but I don't know if it was a process problem or a communication problem that caused more unsatisfactory follow-up problems.
My opinion of the hotel is that the hotel service staff have a good attitude, but they don't actually do the right thing. I hope that they will focus on practical matters in the future, instead of trying to make up for it after being dissatisfied. The good mood of traveling has been ruined.

Because I needed an extra bed for the next two days, I changed the room type once. The housekeeper Winnie helped me connect well and gave the children calcium milk biscuits. If you have any needs, contact Winnie on WeChat and they will be met in time. Especially one evening when I drove back to the hotel by myself, the children were hungry. During the May Day holiday, I had to wait a long time to eat anywhere. I asked Winnie for the room delivery menu on WeChat, ordered eel rice, and the food arrived after I washed up at the hotel. Haitian Hotel is my first choice hotel when I return to Qingdao in the future.

Although the check-in day was Navy Day, the hotel cooperated to receive foreign guests for Navy Day, but the service was not discounted at all because of the busyness. I stayed in Haitian and Westin for a few days. I felt the best. Let's just compare them. Let's talk about the room first. The room is slightly smaller than Westin, but the room decoration is warmer. There is a wide enough cloakroom to place two people's suitcases. The design of the bathtub is also very clever. The glass door can be fully opened, and you can watch TV while taking a bath. For breakfast, Westin and Haitian are both very good, but Haitian is better in that it is a sea view restaurant with excellent scenery. The butler service of Haitian is better. The Westin room type with the same price as Haitian does not seem to have butler service. In terms of price, Haitian has a lot of advantages in the off-season, but the price increase in the peak season is a bit large. The price difference between my stay on Wednesday and Saturday is twice. Overall, if I come to Qingdao next time, I will continue to choose Haitian without hesitation.

Those who want to visit Qingdao recently can choose here without hesitation. The second floor is a full-time buffet restaurant "Q", and those who don’t want to go out for seafood can choose it because the stay experience is particularly good. I want to come to Qingdao again next time. Those who want to visit Qingdao don’t have to worry about staying here, just go.
Say something~

It is very convenient to go out. The hotel decoration is also very beautiful. The window looks at the sea view. The camera came here to do business more than ten years ago..
Ike Xiao Zhang at the front desk is very enthusiastic and thoughtful. You can enjoy the drinks and meals in the hotel refrigerator. I will still choose to stay here next time I come to Qingdao.
The restaurant on the 5th floor can drink some wine, smoke cigars, and listen to their live singing. It is very comfortable.

The breakfast had a lot of variety and the food was delicious. If you have Korean tastes, it might be a bit disappointing. But the restaurant is really big and has an ocean view.
The concierge staff, Mr. taiki, knows how to speak Korean, so I really received a lot of help. Thank you so much.
The swimming pool and gym are really nice haha. I enjoyed it to the fullest.

The seaside is beautiful and really cold. Xiao Bu is really great. He added a lot of points to the Haitian Hotel. He solved the problems that occurred during check-in in a timely manner. With the thoughtful service, he lived up to my choice haha
Exclusive benefits: Experience the executive lounge and afternoon tea. The lounge is quiet and it would be beautiful if it weren't for the fog.

Environment: The overall style is a normal hotel, which is consistent with most hotels at this price. The location is worthy of praise! The location is very advantageous, right next to the tallest building, maybe the second tallest! You can see the sea on one side of the room and the red house on the other side, which is amazing! Two views in one room

Hygiene: I am not picky about details, the overall feeling

Service: It is definitely worthy of praise in the hotel! Regardless of the sudden situation, the bed sheets and quilts are changed very quickly at night, and they also comfort us attentively; the housekeeper Jane is even more considerate to introduce us to the surrounding attractions and warm greetings every day! I heard that the child had a nosebleed and immediately arranged a humidifier, which is very worthy of praise! ! When checking out, I was on the phone the whole time, and I relied on my eyes and Jack to communicate and complete the formalities smoothly!
Recommend everyone to experience it, it is definitely beyond your perception of hotels at this price!

My hometown is Zibo, Shandong. I grew up in Shandong. In fact, I don’t have much confidence in the service industry in my hometown as a whole, but my stay in Haitian this time made me impressed!
Facilities: As a hotel that will start operating in 2021, it is inevitable that the equipment and settings will become obsolete. However, my intuitive feeling after entering the hotel is that there is no obvious old feeling. This should be attributed to the hotel operation and maintenance. The serious work of the staff can be said to be very good.
Catering: The hotel's breakfast is quite rich, combining East and West. I am very satisfied with the meal. Moreover, it is located on the second floor of the hotel, with a panoramic view facing the sea. It is very enjoyable to dine🍽️😋. Its executive lounge is located on the 30th floor of the hotel. Compared with the Sheraton, I counted it during the meal. The number of on-site service staff is several times that of the Sheraton, and the choice of dishes is also very large. It can be said that dining there Almost every action will be taken care of by the waiter, which is quite in place.
Service: I would like to speak highly of the service and attitude of the front desk waiter Xiao Zhao Crystal, which is very, very good! ! ! Whether a hotel is good or bad, no matter the facilities, price, location, or surroundings, will ultimately rest on the service, quality and attitude of the people, whether the response is quick and in place, will be intuitively reflected in the check-in experience. Xiao Zhao's business ability is very Outstanding, their understanding of room types, proficiency in on-site operations, and attention to guests are all very good. My wife and I are very satisfied👍
I hope Haitian will do better and better, and I will come again!

Of course, the other people I met in the hotel were all very nice, especially when I went downstairs to pick up takeout at night. My clothes were too thin and I couldn’t pick them up, so a handsome guy at the front desk helped me pick them up. He is really handsome and kind-hearted. When I arrived, a girl from the concierge helped me pull my suitcase and sent it to my room. My luggage was really overweight, so I was very touched. I can give Haitian Hotel 95 points for its all-day service attitude. Will stay again in the future. My overall senses are very good. This should be the hotel I will stay at every time I stay in Qingdao.

msg:Haitian Hotel is a treasure hotel. I have been to Qingdao many times. Staying at Haitian for the first time gave me wonderful memories of the Spring Festival holiday. Xiao Shao at the front desk is professional, friendly and skilled, and check-in is fast and thoughtful. The side sea view room is super beautiful, with sea view on one side and Little Prague city view on the other. The restaurant has an unparalleled sea view, and the breakfast is rich in variety and delicious. If the children have stomach discomfort, we specially packed an easy-to-digest breakfast for the children. Both software and hardware meet five-star standards. Thank you Xiao Shao and Haitian for bringing us warm memories.

Special thanks to Julie Xiao Zhu for her enthusiasm, thoughtfulness and professionalism, and to Alice Xiao Fan, the duty manager who handled the check-in incident. The speed and attitude in solving problems are trustworthy and praiseworthy👍 It makes people feel at home, which adds to the beauty of the trip. Without further ado, here are the pictures. You can watch the sunrise over the sea from your room.

It is also very convenient to watch the light show at night! Miss Abby received me kindly when I first checked in. She thoughtfully prepared children's supplies for us, upgraded the room type for us, and chose a room with a high view of the sea. You can see the sea from one side of the room. I can see the city, but I don’t even want to go out to play ~ Manager Fan also helped deliver fruits. The hotel’s services and facilities are excellent. Sleep masks are also provided. There are many kinds of drinks in the small refrigerator for free. The breakfast is also very rich. Next time When you come to Qingdao, you must choose Haitian, great!

When I saw that there were children staying, I specially gave them special shampoo, bathrobe and slippers, which was very attentive. Aimee Xiaolin, who checked in, added WeChat, and Xiaolin was able to quickly reply and resolve any needs she had later. Because the mattress was too soft, after telling Xiaolin, a hard mattress was added. Thank you! A steam eye mask was also given, which was very considerate. Ms. Owen who handled check-out was very skilled and professional. Overall, I feel that the service at Haitian Hotel is very good. The waiters greet you politely from the moment you get off the bus. It is the same when entering the hotel door and entering the restaurant, which makes guests feel very warm. The service is enthusiastic and professional. I must like it and give it a five-star rating!

It is a 5-minute walk to the Third Bathing Beach. There are also many things to do at the beach in winter. There are also brave people who take a bath in the sea😁.

msg:When booking a hotel in Qingdao, a friend recommended Haitian
Booked a mountain view room in advance
Arranged for the best view when checking in
As soon as I entered the room, I felt that the view was worth it.
The main city view and the side view can watch the beautiful sunset on the seaside.
Wendy Liu from customer service is also very enthusiastic and considerate.
The arrangements are thoughtful and the people are very nice.

The breakfast is quite satisfactory and generally quite rich.
It’s really enjoyable to sit on the beach and bask in the sun while looking at the sea view.

Friends who exercise highly recommend the gym on the 7th floor.
The equipment is very new, small and sophisticated, including billiards and yoga.
Enjoy the sunrise over the sea while exercising
After exercising, arrange a steaming session
You can also enjoy side sea view and city view in the steam room.
The whole body and mind are relaxed and comfortable

There is a delicious pot sticker and wonton shop near the hotel
Just around the corner when you go out are the Korean Gyeongbokgung Palace and the local seaside
They all taste good too
Go straight along the coast to Badaguan, where there are few people and great scenery.
I like it and will come next time

Especially Owen, who helped me check in, patiently helped us arrange rooms and breakfast times, allowing us to have enough time to rest and relieve our fatigue from catching the bus! There was also Aimee, a skinny girl who checked out and took the luggage of four of us to store it. I feel like everyone in this hotel works so hard.

msg:I am Malaysian and my husband is from Beijing. It was my first time to come to Qingdao and wanted to have a happy New Year's Day. I chose Haitian Hotel, but the experience was extremely poor.

We stayed in room 2922 for two consecutive days starting from the 30th. It was okay at first, but we couldn’t help but write a negative review for the following reasons:


1. There was a peculiar smell in the toilet. After giving feedback to the front desk, the solution was to provide free small drinks in the mini bar (small refrigerator in the room). But, is the solution to drinking Coke and Sprite smelling bad? Later, I was told that after cleaning, the toilet still smelled the next day.
- The normal solution is to change rooms, isn't it? Does every room have a peculiar smell? Don’t dare to change? Or is it that the hotel has no vacancies reserved?

2. We used the room phone number to make a reservation at the 1988 buffet restaurant on the second floor at 5 p.m. They said they should be able to call us at 7 o'clock. Later, we called the room phone number "0" and the customer service did not solve the problem. There was no call back until the time of posting a comment.
-The normal solution is, if the reservation is full, just say it is fully booked. Are you short of money to buy several units? Or at least give me a reply?

  3. We also called Haitian No. 1 on the 5th floor and told us that the quality of the buffet catering was better than that on the 2nd floor, so we double insured and made a reservation on the 5th floor. At first it was said that the queue would start at 7 o'clock, and they said that we should be called around 7:30. We were not called until 7:30, so we went directly to the 5th floor to inquire about the situation. They said: I don’t know when we can be called after 8 o’clock, but the meal will close at 9 o’clock, which means that the so-called high-quality buffet restaurant will let us In the past, did you eat leftovers for half an hour and then say goodbye? So I ordered takeout directly, and then called to complain. After 8 o'clock, I called and said that there was a seat and they could close our meal later. It means that we are asked to wait for half a day and just eat other people's leftovers from the buffet. Can we eat more? Waiting for a call from who knows when? at last
We started ordering takeout at 7:30 and ate takeout in the hotel on New Year’s Eve. If we don't complain, they may not even give us feedback.
- The normal solution is to say at the beginning that today's appoin**ents are full, and there may not be any reservations. Then we made other arrangements early, and we don’t have to eat your food. I don’t know what it means to keep us occupied until after 8 o’clock.
However, we ordered takeout for more than 800 yuan (picture 1), and the food was good. I will not eat at your restaurant sparingly in the future.

  4. When checking out, I briefly complained about the matter. The solution was to give us a small gift (the smallest bottle of shower gel, shampoo, water and soap) (picture 2), which was to give us an extra set of hotel amenities. supplies. He said, if we come again next time, we will be given room discounts, room upgrades, etc. With this experience, can I have another time?
- I don’t need any solutions, so why not go ahead? I think sharing the actual check-in situation with guests who may stay in the future to avoid being scammed is much more important than the so-called gift you gave me.

  5. Starting 10 minutes after leaving the hotel, they made 4 calls to us until 2pm. At first, they said they would give us two buffet coupons next time. Can two coupons next time make up for this New Year's Day mood? We refused outright. Later, he called us and said he would give us 350 yuan to apologize. I stayed for two nights in a row and had a bad experience. Do you want to give me 350 yuan to stop me? Send away beggars?
- Let me tell you that 350 cannot buy my experience, nor can I hide the fact that your service is poor.

  6. The fourth time I called, I don’t know if it was the director who called to apologize. Today is New Year's Day, can you please stop making so many harassing phone calls? The director's solution was to give us RMB 350 to express his apology. By apologizing, he showed the hotel's apologetic attitude and will provide good service next time. (Difference from the previous call?)
- It's enough to be fooled once. The matter this time will be solved this time. Don't talk about the next time, because you won't be fooled a second time. If by any chance we come to stay again, I will write a good review when the time comes.
(Finally, he said he would give me a call to resolve the matter. As of 2:40 when I wrote the comment, I had not received any calls)

Finally, to summarize:
The check-in experience is extremely poor. As for staying in a hotel, one is for accommodation and the other is for food. I didn’t feel any service at all from these two aspects. My good mood during New Year’s Day and New Year’s Eve was completely ruined at Haitian Hotel. I will not compare it with other five-star hotels. Yes, the experience is far inferior to that of the three-star Lavande. In addition to the better location, you can't see the sunrise at all in the side sea view room, so you can only watch the sunrise twinkling over you from the building opposite.

I really don’t want other sisters and friends to have the same experience as us, and I also hope that the hotel will not be like buying food at the vegetable market, using messy things to make up for your management problems, and don’t block my mouth with those false and unrealistic attitudes. Tell the truth.

ps: The breakfast was quite satisfactory and the room facilities were okay. (This is the reason for 1 star, otherwise 0 stars)

The hotel public relations has seen my comment and is welcome to reply with facts.

Davids at the front desk paid close attention to check-in feedback in a timely manner and quickly helped me extend my stay. Responded quickly to everything and even provided a mini bar as a gift.
The cleaning staff Zang Zhenhong was enthusiastic in her service. She delivered it on Chris**as Eve🍎. She cleaned it in time. She paid attention to the need for hot water for drinking tea and replenished bottled water in time.
Thank you everyone, I will stay here again in the future~

It is super convenient to go to Badaguan, Olympic Sailing Center, take a cruise to see the night view, go to May Fourth Square, Vientiane City, etc.! Daphne at the front desk is very kind and enthusiastic, and will help you solve anything you need right away. I don’t have a domestic number, so I use WeChat to contact you, and I almost always get a reply within seconds. They also helped upgrade the room, postponed the check-out time, and helped deliver the scarf I left at the hotel😍😍It was so warm! ! The check-in experience is really super good! In addition, Xiao Jin, who helped check out, was also very nice and enthusiastic. In short, if I come to Qingdao next time, I will definitely stay here again! Also looking for Miss Daphne! Thank you very much! Thank you for your hard work! Merry Chris**as!

Excellent geographical location, close to the Third Bathing Beach, Badaguan Taipingjiao and Haitian MALL, etc., for travelers who can completely relax and experience the beauty and romance of Qingdao. In addition, the excellent service provided by the hotel staff is impressive. Thanks to Aimee Xiaolin at the reception desk and Owen at the check-out service!! Haitian Hotel, whether in terms of service, equipment, design and quality, makes people feel satisfied and treats the guests who stay attentively. It is worthy of being a hotel that has won the International Five-Star Diamond Award and is the first hotel in Shandong that has received foreign VIPs, heads of state, etc.! It is well deserved!!

I could only listen to music and try to sleep. At 11:9, the phone in the room rang and I finally fell asleep. The manager on duty wanted to wake me up. He said he didn't hear any noise and asked me if there was still any noise. Do I need to move to another room? The noise continued until one o'clock in the morning🕐. The loud noise started again in the morning. I thought that the bedside of the room should be facing the bathroom next door. The loud response should be the sound of the next door closing the toilet glass door and closing the shower glass door. When I checked in, I told the boy at the front desk to be quiet. The manager on duty called me on my cell phone and refused to answer the phone. He insisted on calling me from the room and woke me up. The quality of the room was too poor and the service awareness was too poor, regardless of the guest's request. The key is here. I have stayed here before and left my contact information. I am afraid that I will not be satisfied with the bad reviews. Contact me and give me a discount. Do not go through the platform. Do not give bad reviews. This time it is the agreed price. It should be Ctrip. This time, Ctrip has a bad review. This time, the bed was vomited and was not clean and smelled. I regret being treated a hundred dollars cheaper

From entering to checking out, from hardware to service, I am super satisfied.
The little beauty Lisa checked in and greeted her thoughtfully every day.
Brother Evan handled the check-out and arranged for someone to deliver the luggage to the car.
I had breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner at Haitian. I was exhausted.
The seafood for lunch is super fresh! The dinner included in the hotel package is also very sumptuous and can be eaten as a meal
The restaurant has a beautiful view. I saw the blue sea on the first day.
Happy~

msg:Qingdao Haitian Hotel left a deep impression and wonderful memories on us.

When I came to Qingdao for the first time, I gave up the InterContinental I was used to and chose to stay in Qingdao Haitian. Facts have proved that this is a wise and correct choice.

It was just after 10 a.m. when we arrived at the hotel. I thought I could only check in first and then store my luggage (the hotel check-in time is 3 p.m.), but the handsome Xiao Shao who received us said that he had a cleaned room and we could go directly. We checked in and arranged a room with a better view. We were satisfied with Xiao Shao's reception.

During my 3-night stay, Xiao Shao sent me hotel-related information via WeChat, greetings every day, and reminded me of weather changes, so that if we had any needs or encountered any problems, we could contact him via WeChat in a timely manner. We were very satisfied with Xiao Shao's concern.

When we left the hotel, Xiao Shao happened to be on duty at the front desk. We said goodbye to him and waited for the bus outside the lobby. Unexpectedly, Xiao Shao came outside to say goodbye to us warmly after receiving the guests who checked in. The temperature outside the lobby was very hot. It was low and raining. Xiao Shao's personal farewell was very heartwarming and surprising to us. We were very satisfied with Xiao Shao's carefulness and thoughtfulness.

Haitian Hotel is luxuriously decorated, and the rooms and hotel facilities are first-class, brand-new and intelligent. The hotel has a first-line sea view. When you go out, you can walk along the coastline to the left to the May 4th Square and the Olympic Sailing Center. To the right is the Third Bathing Beach. You can go to Taipingjiao Park along the coastal plank road and then stroll to the Badaguan Scenic Area. The quality of the hotel's breakfast is very good. When you enter, you will be guided to your seat by a dedicated person. You can enjoy the delicious breakfast while enjoying the first-line sea view. The afternoon tea in the executive lounge on the 30th floor is also worth experiencing.

It was our first time to come to Qingdao and the experience of staying at Haitian Hotel for 3 nights and 4 days. Especially the detail-oriented service provided by Xiao Shao and his colleagues made us want to come back before we left. Because of Haitian, we will come to Qingdao again.

msg:Escape the haze and cooling in the north and come to the familiar Qingdao to continue the autumn. Staying at Haitian for the first time left a very good impression. I will make it a choice when I come to Qingdao again.
When Haitian Mall was built two years ago, I looked at the Olympic Sailing Center from a distance and looked forward to living in this ideally located place one day. The hotel is facing the sea. If you go to the left, you can walk along the coastline to the Olympic Sailing Center Lover's Dam to see the sea. If you go to the right, you can quickly enter the Badaguan area for a stroll.
The hotel is very new and has very good facilities in all aspects. I particularly recommend the gym and swimming pool. The view is excellent and the facilities are comprehensive. The swimming pool is very clean.
I thought that non-global hotels would encounter less than ideal service, but the overall service quality is very good for the same level in Qingdao.
The only shortcoming encountered is that the quality of the guest room preparation is average, and the effect of tidying up does not vary greatly between the same person. This convenience and standardization can be improved.
For a tourist whose goal is to relax, overall good reviews and recommended!

Finally, I would like to thank the handsome guy Evan Xiaoyin for arranging fruits and attentive services every day. I look forward to meeting Haitian again on my next trip to Qingdao~

msg:Facilities: Haitian was renovated and opened in 2021. The overall facilities from the lobby on the first floor to the guest rooms are very fashionable and trendy. The design style is Italian-style, simple and elegant, and at the same time exquisite in details. The bathroom supplies in the rooms are all Kohler Yes, equipped with a smart toilet. The audio is from JBL, and it is very convenient to connect to the Bluetooth of your mobile phone to listen to music. The gym and swimming pool facilities are also very clean and tidy. On the seventh floor, the view is very good. If the weather is good, you can see the silver coastline٩(๑^o^๑)۶!
Hygiene: Since this is a new store opening, there is absolutely nothing to say about hygiene, thumbs up 👍! The cleanliness of the room, at least for me as a tourist who often stays in five-star hotels, I didn't find anything wrong with it, praise 👍!
Environment: Like 👍!
Service: Special comments would be made about Annie at the hotel’s front desk customer service center and the auntie at the room service, praise 👍! Because I was traveling with my parents, I communicated the remarks with the customer service at the front desk. The front desk really paid attention to the remarks. Whether it was checking in or during the check-in process, the attitude of communicating with the front desk was very polite and warm, and the international style was also reflected. ! The two front desk ladies in the executive lounge on the 30th floor are very well paid~(¯▽¯~)~👍

msg:After checking out from the old five-star Haitian Garden Hotel, I transferred to this hotel. The comparison is really different. The entire hotel is very comfortable, and both the hardware facilities and services are much better than those of the Haitian Garden Hotel. I specially booked a side sea view room and a mountain view room. The scenery in the mountain view room is very good. I don’t need to go to Signal Mountain to take pictures of the red tiles and green trees. The hotel has convenient transportation, with the sea at the door and the Haitian Mall next to it. The incomparable sea view in the breakfast restaurant is among the best in the country! During the check-in process, we are very grateful to the butler "baby" for his assistance and making us feel at home. This hotel is the most comfortable hotel I have ever stayed in Qingdao. It is also the hotel with the best service and environment I have ever stayed in in China. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Qingdao.

msg:The hotel is located on the beautiful seaside. There are some restaurants, cafes and bookstores in the Haitian Building next to it, which is very convenient. The subway and airport bus are not far away.
Stayed at the executive floor on the 30th floor. It is very convenient to enjoy afternoon tea and evening happy hour, which is included in the package booked by Ctrip. Especially dinner, it actually far exceeded expectations. There were hot and cold dishes, fruits, wine, drinks, Western desserts, and coffee. It was quite rich. It was no problem as a dinner, and the sea view was wide. The breakfast room is very large, and many seats have sea views. The dining table is roughly divided into two areas: the external Chinese style and the internal western style. You can choose from the nearest one. Although it is hosting a large conference, the restaurant capacity is still quite satisfactory.
Annie's reception service was in place, the introduction was clear and concise, and the follow-up service was also very meticulous, thoughtful and warm. The hotel helped arrange the room in advance according to our needs. It gave us a birthday a**osphere as soon as we checked in. We also presented a (not too small) delicious birthday cake, which was a great surprise to the birthday girl! The warm service provided by the cleaning lady and the staff at the wellness center also made our stay comfortable and secure during our two-day stay.
There is a Nespresso coffee machine in the room and decaffeinated coffee capsules are provided. The tea bags taste fresh. The ingredients in the restaurant are very fresh, the pastries made have pure and delicate taste, and the dried fruits are of good quality.

There is not even a complimentary fruit in the room. And when I checked in, the door that can be opened between the two rooms was locked. I called the front desk to ask the staff to come up and open it. If I had known this, I would not have chosen this room. I was traveling with my one-year-old baby and aunt, so I wanted to find a suite. I didn't expect this kind of room to be very average. The view is not good either.

From the concierge to the front office, every staff member is very good. Special thanks to Abby for her full service and changing us to a double room. He said that he also gave free fruits and steam eye masks in the evening. During this period, he kept asking how the experience was. It is really good that the service industry can do this👍🏻


Hygiene: The room is clean and tidy. The whole hotel has a faint smell of aromatherapy. What surprised me was the toilet in the bathroom. It smelled very good. I searched for a long time and couldn't find the aromatherapy.


Exclusive benefits: We booked an executive one, so it included afternoon tea and happy hour. Overall, it was very good. Although we couldn’t eat much, the scenery in the executive lounge on the 30th floor was really good during the day, but the scenery at night was average.


Breakfast: quite satisfactory. The highlight is that you can cook while watching the seaside, which greatly increases your appetite.

Finally, I would like to thank Abby again for making this two-day and one-night trip to Qingdao very enjoyable.

msg:During the National Day trip, it was my first time to visit Qingdao. Since I brought two young boys with me, it was important to find a hotel with complete facilities and parent-child friendliness. In the end, I chose Haitian Hotel, although the appearance and decoration are not parent-child friendly. It's a hotel, but the service inside has fully met my expectations. It turns out that the decision to live in Haitian is great! First of all, the location of the hotel is excellent. It is right next to the coastal greenway. There are beach rocks at the door to catch the sea (it is really fun to dig for crabs and small fish). It is very close to Sanyu and May Fourth Square. You can walk along the greenway to get there. . It is also very convenient to watch the light show at night. The Haitian Hotel is the building next to the tallest building. The hotel's executive lounge, buffet restaurant, swimming pool and rooms are all very good. You can see the old city of Badaguan Scenic Area, Taiping Mountain TV Tower, the sea and the Olympic Sailing Center. The scenery is excellent. In the morning, you can see the beautiful sunrise by opening the automatic curtains in the room (why go to Shi Laoren). The hotel service is also very considerate. There is a butler who can be contacted at any time. The butler Mia took the initiative to ask if you have any comments or needs, and took the initiative to send free fruits several times, which was very considerate. The executive twin room booked by Ctrip allows you to have free afternoon tea in the executive lounge. There is a rich variety of food and the scenery outside the floor-to-ceiling windows is very good. It is very comfortable to stay there and I don’t want to go out. Because this hotel gave me a very good first impression of Qingdao, I will definitely choose Haitian if I come back next time!

The hotel is located near Taipingjiao and Badaguan Scenic Areas. Downstairs is the beach and coastal promenade. Not far away is May Fourth Square and the Olympic Sailing Center. The location is perfect!
The hotel is very new, built in 21 years. All facilities are absolutely great.
The hotel's buffet breakfast is very rich and tastes good. The panoramic sea view restaurant on the second floor is a pleasant place to eat.

I booked a suite, but it was actually two rooms with a connection in the middle. One of the flaws was that there was a big pillar in one of the rooms, which slightly affected the city view. The other room had more of a view of the sea. Overall, both rooms had a big pillar. The rooms are all large and the beds are quite comfortable~
The breakfast was very rich, it was a very large restaurant, and you could sit by the window and have breakfast while looking at the sea. When you left, there were also disposable paper cups to bring your own coffee. Overall, I was very satisfied! Will come again if I have the chance!

I think it is pretty good. It may not be the best in Qingdao, but with the blessing of invincible sea view, I am really satisfied. Although Qingdao Seaside There are many hotels with a view of the sea, but you should not choose hotels with relatively deserted surroundings. Before, I was worried that the city center would be too noisy. Later, I found that the location of Haitian is just right. The seaside is very lively and the walk to May Fourth Square is quite nice. It's lively and interesting. If it's a pure beach, it's quiet at night. It's actually not interesting at all. It's probably a bit scary. I'll probably choose this place next time I come to Qingdao. Unless I want to choose a hotel with a terrace, I might go to Huangdao to stay on this sea-to-sky trip. The housekeeper Lisa is a very responsible housekeeper. It is relatively convenient to have such a housekeeper. If you have any needs, you can solve them through WeChat. Thank you for the service of the housekeeper Lisa in the past few days.

I think it would be a pity not to live in Haidian to see the sunset and sea view. It’s so beautiful that I’m speechless.
I made many choices before coming to Qingdao, and finally chose the Haitian Hotel between the St. Regis and the Haitian Hotel. The two hotels are adjacent to each other and have been renovated after many years. It has awakened the memories of many Qingdao people. I like the location here and it is right away when I go out. In the third bathhouse, you can also see a light show at night. There’s really nothing to say about the location.
Room: When you enter the room, you will find minibar, De'Longhi hot water kettle, coffee machine and other facilities. The shower room and toilet are in separate compar**ents. The key point is that I really like the large floor-to-ceiling windows in the room, and the sea view at sunrise and sunset is even better. beautiful. The sea view room type is very different, facing the sea, and the best floor height is recommended to be around the 20th floor.
Hygiene: Needless to say about hygiene, it is absolutely excellent, the whole room is bright and makes people feel happy, and a bubble bath at night can eliminate the fatigue during the journey!
Restaurant: Floor-to-ceiling windows with 180-degree unparalleled sea views. Buffet breakfast is served from 6:30-10:00 on the second floor of the hotel:
1988 all-day dining restaurant "The dining space is very large, the environment is also good, there are many kinds of breakfast to choose from, and you can see the endless sea area when you sit by the window. Get up early and enjoy breakfast while watching the sea. This is a slow-paced lifestyle." really comfortable.
The buffet is considered to be the best in Qingdao. It costs 398 yuan per person and the service is very good. The food trays are collected in a timely manner and there is no need to queue up to pick up the food.
During this stay, you will enjoy 2 special privileges
1. Afternoon tea includes (desserts, fruits, pastries, drinks; all self-service, the style and type depend on the day of the hotel; use time 14:00-16:30)
2. Happy hour includes (cold meals, desserts, fruits, drinks; all are self-service, the style and type depend on the hotel that day; usage time is 18:00-20:00);
Service: The arrangement of Mia in the room is clear and the service is thoughtful. When we are queuing up to check in, we take the initiative to assist and give priority to check in. JACK, the butler, provides considerate service. He proactively adds WeChat messages to greet him in the morning and evening and reminds him of the weather and outdoor protection precautions for the day. He also proactively arranges to deliver fruits and eye masks every day. He also handles daily feedback issues in a timely and efficient manner. I highly commend JACK for his excellent service and attentive care. We accepted it and look forward to our next encounter.

The hotel's breakfast and buffet are also good. You can choose to book a room with breakfast and 1.2m children are free. Because the room we booked temporarily did not include breakfast and added breakfast at the front desk, it was a little bit more expensive. Well, that's basically it, I hope to give some references to friends who want to stay. Choosing the right hotel can have a big impact on the entire journey. There is Haitian mall next to it, which can meet the needs of daily coffee and snacks. You can also experience the Qinhuangdao skyline. . . Opposite is the third bathing beach, you can go to the sea in tens of meters. . .

When checking in, I was reminded to add the housekeeper's WeChat account. The butler Taiki Yuan is very friendly. He would ask room service to bring children's toiletries and remind me about the morning and the hotel swimming pool floor. If I have any travel-related introductions, I can also consult him. When they learned that I was going to take my children to dig sand, they informed me that they would provide sand digging tools. And asked me when checking out and completed the check-out procedures. Makes me feel very convenient. I read a lot of reviews before and was confused about choosing a hotel. I would say Qingdao Haitian Hotel is in a great location. The night view is beautiful. Across the road is the beach. This is highly recommended for taking children to dig in the sand and swim in the sea. Take a walk in the evening from May Fourth Square back to the hotel to enjoy the night view. The hotel is next to the third bathing beach. Location is its advantage. The service is also very good. I will travel to Qingdao next time. Would choose this again.

After comparing Shangri-La Westin and MGM, I finally chose Haitian to check in. After Gali helped me check in, I felt the hospitality of Shandong. A brand new day has begun. I went to Haibo, came out of Net Red Road from Gate No. 3, took a stroll to check in Daxue Road, Longjiang Road, and went to the third beach for sea swimming. It was really cool to surf and swim in the sea under light rain. The advantage of being close, go directly back to the hotel to take a shower and make a mask, a beautiful day. The swimming pool can directly see the sea

There is a shopping center next to it, not far from May Fourth Square. Although there is a queue for the hotel buffet breakfast during the summer vacation, the breakfast is very rich. And when there are vacant seats, there will be dedicated waiters to take the seats, so as to avoid self-serving guests looking for a seat in the restaurant of Nuoda. The room cleaning is also very careful, and the service staff of the hotel are also very enthusiastic. The executive lounge has a good view, and it is a good place to go to the hotel if you don't want to go out to see the sea view at noon. The minibar in the evening also provides hot food, which is very convenient. Special thanks to Daphne and Gali for their attentive service during check-in and check-out.

The follow-up service is very fast, and the room cleaning is also very timely. This room type is larger than ordinary rooms. Except for a pillar, the view is very wide. You can see the sunset on the back mountain and a partial sea view. There is no absolute requirement for sea view, but if you have requirements for activity space, this room type is really the first choice. If we have to talk about shortcomings, the planning of the parking and drop-off area at the entrance is a bit too sloppy for a five-star hotel, maybe because it is too close to the sea and there is no place, but this does not affect the experience of staying at all.

I also gave some rationalization suggestions and reminders, and there are coupons for Yunhaitian tickets next to it, which came in handy! The room is very spacious with two beds put together, and the room service is timely and friendly. The rich breakfast is also prepared with care, even at 9:30, there will be a 🈶️dinner peak, and the waiters will arrange the seats reasonably. In short, I will choose it next time🌟

msg:The beauty Abby who checked in was very kind. We arrived at the hotel very early. Although there was no room, we checked in quickly, and then went out to play. Come back at night and check in directly. Before checking out the next day, I was too late to come back from the beach, so I contacted abby and gave the delayed check-out time to 2:00, and the handsome guy batty who checked out was very efficient and checked out in one minute. The location of the hotel is very good, and the view of the room is also very good. Half of it is the sea and half is the mountain. It is very beautiful to see the blue sea and blue sky and the red and white old town. You can just sit by the window in a daze and don't need to go out to check in the scenic spots.

Although it is the peak season of summer vacation, the sound insulation effect of the hotel is top-notch, and I sleep very soundly every day. Living on the top floor of the 31st floor has a beautiful sea view. Ms. Zhang Yahui at the front desk also sent a WeChat message to remind the opening time of the executive lounge, because our flight was delayed. Thank you very much for arranging a late check-out for us! The cleaning lady on the 31st floor is also very, very nice. In fact, every waiter in the hotel is very enthusiastic. It is worth mentioning that the hotel's buffet dinner is really cost-effective, mackerel soup, yellow croaker pot stickers, etc. are very delicious! Next time I come to Qingdao, I will continue to live in Haitian!

The bathtub feels a bit small, maybe I’m too country bumpkin to take a bath😂
The room facilities are good, the view is good, and there is a lot of food (I just saw it in my hand, but I haven't eaten yet). The swimming pool and gym are useless. It's really a pity... I will stay here again next time I come to Qingdao

Looking out from the room is the sea, blue sky, white clouds, sailboats and yachts. Downstairs is the beach. Walking, digging sand and sea bubbles, it is a paradise for children to spend their holidays. Not far from every attraction. Thanks to Owen, I gave my child breakfast for 4 days, and I was reminded warmly throughout the stay, very considerate! 👍👍👍The breakfast is very rich, the wontons are really delicious🤤, and there are hot fried dough sticks, which are must-eat items; the buffet in the evening is also great, with unlimited supply of sweet shrimp and lobster. Have a bottle of Tsingtao Beer and enjoy life!

Service: Jack is warm and polite. After adding v, he sent a lot of reminders such as breakfast, dining time, swimming pool time, afternoon tea time and so on.

Breakfast: It's almost meaningless. I always feel that there is nothing delicious, and there are too many people. 555.

The whole is still very worth living, and it is still the best choice to go to Qingdao!


By the way, I went to play in the very tall Haitian Center next door, but after checking out, I found out that hotel guests can get a discount of 50 per person, vomiting blood! ! 😂 Just put the card in a more conspicuous position!

We even dug up snake starfish and released them. The children like to play on the beach. Digging, if you bring your children to dig the sand, the experience will be easier. Go back to the hotel when it’s hot, and go downstairs to dig the sand when the tide is low. The Haitian mall next to it has a simple meal supermarket, bakery, milk tea shop, and it’s very convenient to eat casually. The hotel also provides executive afternoon tea and light meals in the evening. The aunt who cleans up the room is also very enthusiastic. In short, the stay is quite pleasant, and I will come again next time.

After all, it is a famous five-star hotel in Qingdao, with complete facilities and considerate service. The afternoon tea provided by the privilege is good, but the light meals during happy hour are a bit monotonous. Breakfast may be due to the festival, and the flow of people is very concentrated. It is recommended to use the executive lounge to divert the flow to improve the dining experience of guests. Overall evaluation: Five-star praise, highly recommended!

I would also like to thank the room service Zang Zhenhong on the 31st floor (I don’t know if the wording is correct). Since we checked in, he has been very enthusiastic, considerate and responsive, and greets us with a smile every time we meet. The old man at home urged me to do it for three days. Give Xiao Zang a good review, name and praise👍

Even slippers and toiletries were not added in quantity. Extremely stingy! Very poor living experience! There are layers of dust on the window glass of the city-view king bed room. I'm speechless just looking at it. There is also the noise from high-altitude construction!

When I checked in, Franz reminded me that I couldn’t see the sea. Help me Changed to a side sea view room, the room is very beautiful, you can see the Olympic Sailing Center, and the night view is also beautiful. I got up early and went to the gym for a run. It was the first time I ran while looking at the sea view, and I was full of energy. The breakfast variety is also very rich. I ate a lot without knowing it while looking at the sea😂The facilities and sanitation are all five-star, and the service makes people feel at home, especially Franz and cc, who are very kind and lovely. If I come to Qingdao again, I will choose Haitian to stay here😊

The selected room type also provides exquisite afternoon tea (the desserts are delicious). The sea is outside the window, eating and drinking with the waves... not bad...
Just in time for Mother's Day, we sent warm flowers, which added a heart-warming surprise to the trip of our two mothers!
Hotel facilities are not bad! The location is also very good!

The hotel faces the sea, whether you are resting in the room or dining in the restaurant, you can see the sea, and you need a robot to find anything in seconds. Here I would like to praise Mr. Zhao who received me. The room dispatch is not only fast but also can meet your demands.

In fact, I feel that although the services of many five-star hotels in China are quite satisfactory, there are no faults, but they are less humane and warm.
But this time I came to Qingdao and stayed at the Haitian Hotel. The overall service is really good. From getting off the bus to entering the hotel to checking in, every hotel staff is very warm and welcoming.
alice Xiaofan's service is very thoughtful, meticulous, caring and patient
This stay experience gives full marks💯

The location of the hotel is very convenient, the breakfast is also great, and there are executive gifts (afternoon tea and evening light meal), the experience of staying with parents and children is great. Lying on the bed in the room, you can see the sea view and Badaguan. It takes about 10 minutes to go downstairs to the third bathing beach. It is very happy for the children to go to Chasing Waves in the afternoon in the middle of May. It is very convenient to take a taxi nearby to the Zhanqiao, Wheat Island Park, and May Fourth Square, and the taxi does not exceed 25 yuan. Just a little suggestion, if the room has a window that can be opened a crack, it will be more comfortable~

msg:First of all, let’s talk about the service, the service is very good, the hotel staff will greet the guests no matter what position they see, help carry luggage 🧳, press the elevator, Tina who checks in will also recommend hotel activities, tourist attraction route maps, etc.
Then let’s talk about the room. The room I stayed in is on the 18th floor. The scenery is quite good. You can see the Lover’s Dam Lighthouse, the location of the extreme challenge. The curtains in the room have sheer curtains and cloth curtains. The electric switch is very convenient. The lights in the center are tightly blocked.
The hotel's buffet is also great. I usually don't order breakfast when traveling. This time, I read the reviews saying that Haitian's breakfast has many types, so I ordered it. It's really good. The key point is that the scenery by the window can directly see the sea. I feel that I can sit by the window I had breakfast until ten o'clock, and I chose the Japanese restaurant on the fifth floor for dinner on the first day.
This time, I also participated in the kite-flying activity organized by the hotel, met the enthusiastic chief concierge student Xiaoding, and successfully flew the kite up with the help of the enthusiastic local uncle.
The location of the hotel is also very good. It is very close by car to several surrounding attractions. If you are physically fit, you can walk slowly along the coastline. There is a light show at night. Several colleagues have been planted by me. Next time Come to Qingdao and live here! (I wrote so much for the first evaluation)

msg:1. Lived in a special-shaped room. The so-called family room is actually two double bed rooms next to each other with an extra door. It doesn't matter. But both rooms are triangular in shape, and each room has a huge pillar. The space has no layout, the area is very small, and it is too awkward to live in. This is a typical use of waste space.
2. The service is too poor. There are two large quilts for four people, which is inconvenient for two children. I wanted to ask for an extra quilt or blanket, but they said if the guest room was full, so they brought me a quilt cover! Is it the right temperature to cover your child with a thick quilt? Also, there was no fruit for two days. When I checked out, I asked the front desk why it wasn't there. He said that he might have forgotten it and that he had sent me a text message. Does your hotel need to send a text message to confirm when delivering fruit? There was a text message telling me the wifi password, and it didn't say anything about fruit.
3. The breakfast buffet is really average. But the overall grade is the most passable. There are basically no cooking dishes, only four fried vegetables, and many things are always missing. The reason must be that there are many guests during holidays. I can only say that if you don’t have diamonds, don’t do the porcelain work. There are many hotels to go to during holidays. It’s not this one, it’s much better than here.
4. Small problems. The water pressure is too low, the worst I have ever stayed in a hotel.
I basically don’t comment because this time it was so unsatisfactory. It costs more than 13,000 yuan to stay in a room for two days. What I want for this price is the corresponding service. You are far from able to meet it. I must make it clear. The ratings are all brushed up, right?

For this trip, we had to choose between St. Regis next door and Haitian, because Haitian is an old 5🌟 hotel in Qingdao, and it returned after the old hotel was blasted, so we chose Haitian.
The hotel is new, the room size is moderate, and all facilities are very good.

The afternoon tea and dinner happy hour in the executive lounge are very pleasant, the meals are ok, and the service is especially remarkable👍
Swimming in the swimming pool at night, the water quality is very good, very pleasant!
The next day's breakfast had my favorite full English breakfast option, and I was very satisfied. Looking at the magnificent sea view outside the window, drinking freshly ground cappuccino, it was very pleasant.
Finally, I would like to thank Eva for her reception during check-out and the doorman for her help. I will come again next time😄

msg:This room is definitely the ceiling except for the Sea to Sky Suite
Panoramic wrap-around floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city
I planted this type of house when I came to Qingdao last year
In the end, I didn’t have time to experience it. It’s scheduled for this year.
Special emphasis was placed on the room type requirements during check-in to avoid follow-up troubles
Brother Gali is very nice. He chose the former between the Haitian King Room and the City View King Room. When he opened the door, he was very pleasantly surprised. It was exactly what he wanted.
The check-in staff said that this room type has the same level of ceiling in terms of layout and area, and it is their favorite except for the suite.
The birthday hotel also sent a cake, very considerate, praise!
The whole check-in experience was not standard, and the staff I met this time were so enthusiastic! Very good! When you stand in the lobby for half a minute, you will come forward and ask if you need help. Next time you come to stay at Haitian!

If you ask that food not be delivered to the room, okay, I will treat it as a means to stimulate consumption, so at least you must provide normal service, instead of saying that delivery takes half an hour but actually takes an hour and a half.
The cleaning lady was rude and kept urging the guests to let her finish cleaning this floor as soon as possible.
Overall, five-star price and two-star service.

Service: The service is really good. This trip happened to be my boyfriend’s birthday in the Gregorian calendar. Although we are not in the Gregorian calendar, the hotel still thoughtfully prepared a cake. It’s delicious 😋
Exclusive benefits: There are desserts and dinners every day. Although there are not as many types as breakfast, it is already very good
Breakfast: The breakfast is very good. There are Chinese and Western styles, as well as a little Japanese style. The video strongly recommends fried dumplings and wontons (my northern stomach still prefers this stuffed one, of course the others are also delicious) If you want a table by the window must go early
PS: The lady at the front desk, Bonnie Xiaoqu, is really beautiful and the service is also very good. I love it. If you are traveling to Qingdao for the first time, you can really choose Haitian accommodation. It will make your stay very comfortable! 😊

This is also the main reason why I chose this hotel with my baby. The scenery is beautiful, especially when the lights are on at night. Watching the light show at the bathhouse is really awesome. Just throw it on the beach and your child can dig out the sand for a day. However, the experience of staying in the hotel was a bit unsatisfactory. Even after I came back for two days, I still can’t forget the hotel experience when I think about it... Although it is a butler-style service, other supporting services feel more like taking the convention and exhibition business travel route, which is high. Cold and serious, not the friendliness of a family hotel (compared to hotels in Sanya, my expectations are too high maybe...), most of the waiters will not take the initiative to help you, and have to ask you to find someone for service, and the service can only be We achieved a passing level of 60 points, but the toilet smelled like urine for some reason (this may be an isolated case)... Those with children should consider it carefully. We also stayed in the Huangdao Mangrove Forest for two nights, and we had a lot of fun. Most netizens commented that the service was about the same... I originally wanted to improve my experience by switching hotels to Haitian, but it seemed that apart from the better hardware, there was not much difference.

The hotel is located near May Fourth Square, and the surrounding attractions and shopping districts are all very close~!

Service: Franz and Steven checked in for us, very fast and proficient~ I asked if there was a higher floor and upgraded our room type for free, thank you very much, and then added WeChat. If necessary, you can contact us through WeChat, which is very convenient , Welcome fruit was also presented after check-in.

Needless to say, the location is really great. To borrow a buzzword from the Internet, it is facing the sea and spring flowers blooming.
Because I arrived earlier than the scheduled time on the day of check-in, I specially called the hotel to coordinate. The receptionist Ellen was very enthusiastic and even added WeChat to help check in in real time. The lady at the front desk, Alice, was also very enthusiastic. I also helped arrange a room with a view of the sea. It was really nice to watch the sunset in the room for two days.
Of course, these two young ladies are not the only ones. All the staff I met in the hotel were very enthusiastic and would provide help as soon as possible.
I look forward to going to Qingdao next time and experiencing the scenery of other rooms.

Environment: Facing the bay, there is nothing to say about the walking environment. Next door is Yunhaitian. It is worth a visit. It is amazing to see the sea of clouds. There are coffee and restaurants in the Haitian mall next to it. The bookstore is especially recommended. It is very comfortable to read and work while watching the sea

It is equipped with a humidifier and purifier, and the room temperature control is convenient and reasonable. It is especially important for high-rise buildings where windows cannot be opened. The elderly are sensitive and respond very comfortably , It means that it is really good. I would like to make a suggestion that the Philips hair dryer has a strong plastic feel. Although it can be used, it is a bit cheap.
Exclusive benefits: The executive lounge has a nice view, you can go for afternoon tea, I feel that there are many young people at night
I have said a lot. As a quasi-business person with some experience in global travel, seeing Qingdao has such a quality, I suddenly feel that the country of the motherland is beautiful, and I am inexplicably moved. I thank the hotel students for their service. I will come again next time

Henry, he originally wanted to arrange other rooms for me, but he told me that this room has a special view, and he thought I might like it, so I said that I would take a look after I went in, and I really liked it when I went, and I felt very professional. I understand the psychology of customers very well!

msg:On the last day of the Spring Festival holiday, I took my family to stay at Haitian Hotel, tasted the Haitian buffet, and enjoyed the first-line sea view. The location of the hotel is superior, the supporting facilities are complete, the breakfast is rich, and the service is warm. The customer service also took the initiative to handle late check-out. Seeing the sea, the only downside is that the room decoration materials and decoration grade are average, which is not much different from hotels that cost four to five hundred yuan.

msg:The price was raised during the summer vacation, but it was totally not up to the service he deserved!
1. We brought a 5-year-old child with us. When we entered the room, there was a smell of cigarette smoke. We couldn't bear to stay there for five minutes, so we decided to contact the front desk. Afterwards, the cleaning lady came to the room and told us that we needed to leave the room for at least an hour and ventilate the smell first. We proposed After changing rooms, we changed from a side sea view room to a mountain view room. At our insistence, we were changed to the side view room we deserved the next day.
2. The overall service is not as enthusiastic as what is said online. There are indeed two extra waiters at the door to greet us on weekends. When we checked in on a non-weekend, there was no one to help us with our luggage.
3. The air conditioner is not powerful and it is very hot at 22 degrees.
4. The room is compact, and it does not feel like a home away from home. There are many people queuing for breakfast, and the food is average and greasy. I am really sorry for the price of 2,500 per night.
5. In summer, most of the customers who come to visit will go to the beach or something. There is no very user-friendly service for drying clothes and other issues. Cleaning clothes is charged on a piece-by-piece basis, which costs more than 48 yuan per piece.
I wanted to stay in a better hotel when I was traveling with my baby. The driver also said that this was a high-end luxury hotel. I was full of expectations, but I was disappointed.
Everyone should be cautious...

msg:Really very very satisfied with a stay! Everything is great. I compared several hotels before departure. After struggling with the difficulty of choosing for a few days and nights, I finally decided on Haitian. It turned out that I made the right choice! On the taxi ride, the driver said he had chosen the best hotel. Whether it is the front desk, room service, feedback efficiency, environmental sanitation, or service attitude, the check-in experience is excellent. The room design is very beautiful, the sound insulation is good and quiet, the bed is very comfortable, and the toiletries, especially the toothbrush, are really useful! The services of Mac and Eva are very good, and you can contact them at any time if you have any questions. The sea is right outside the hotel, the breakfast room looks at the whole sea view through the window, and the indoor heated swimming pool is beautiful, big and easy to swim in! In particular, the children's pool is connected to the adult pool without water, and the children's pool has a depth of 0.6 and can play directly without swimming rings! The infinity pool looks at the sea through the floor-to-ceiling windows, which is super healing! I have never written so many words of praise so seriously, but Haitian deserves it! It's all a real experience of staying, and it is my favorite hotel of the same level that I have stayed in so far!

msg:As a veteran 5 super five-star hotel in Qingdao, the experience of staying this time really did not meet expectations. First of all, there was a hygienic problem. The mouthwash used by the previous tenant appeared in my wash box. In this epidemic environment, if it is not disinfected, is there a hidden danger of infection with germs? Friends traveling together, the same price and the same type of suite, my room has mouthwash and is above the 20th floor, but hers is on the 15th floor, no, should follow-up hotels be treated with the same type of room without distinction? Secondly, during the process of using water, turn on the hot water, and the milky white water is very exaggerated, like drinking a glass of milk, which makes people doubt the water sanitation problem. The official explanation given by the hotel is due to the concentration of water in the same period of time. As a super five-star hotel , what the user needs is not an explanation, and for the advance notification and advance handling of special circumstances, the processing staff only informs other rooms that it is the same. At that time, I contacted my friend on the 15th floor and asked her to take a video, and there was no such The situation, sanitation is the foundation of a hotel, Haitian did not do a good job in the basics, which made me very disappointed this time.

msg:I wanted to experience the top hotels in Qingdao (except for St. Regis), so I booked a city view double room, because after checking in at 1 o'clock, there was only a room on the 18th floor. I upgraded to a side sea view double bed room on the 30th floor, and I saw a part on the left. The sea, part of the city view on the right, blocked by a building in the middle. It’s okay to rest, but the bad thing is the breakfast experience. A hotel of this level can’t serve breakfast because there are too many people during the Chinese New Year. We ran to the 2nd floor, but we were asked to go to the 30th floor for breakfast, and there were no seats. We squeezed on the coffee table There are so few varieties of food, is it worthy of such an expensive breakfast price? I really don't know what will happen during the peak season? Later, the hotel manager gave us small snacks and sausages, but the mood of the day has been ruined. I hope to learn from other hotels. In summer, so many people also serve as usual. Will not go to live again.

The deluxe sea view suite is really good, the room is relatively large and very clean. There are two bathrooms, one of which is attached to the bathroom, which is a good arrangement. There is a sliding door between the living room and the room, which can be separated or opened. The view from the living room and the window of the room is very good, and I seem to be in a very happy mood. Because the check-in day was New Year's Eve, the hotel also gave a small New Year's gift, which was very considerate.
Parents went to eat breakfast, there are many kinds, and parents are still very satisfied.
Xiao Pan and Bonnie from Haitian answered all kinds of questions patiently and meticulously, and the attitude of the service staff is also very gentle. The experience of staying this time is still very good.

msg:The standard of the hotel's hardware facilities is an international five-star ➕, which has reached the standard. Due to booking the wrong room, after requesting to change the room halfway, the front office quickly changed to a room with the same price and a higher price, and did not ask to make up the price difference. The service awareness and coordination skills of the managers Bonnie Qu and Amanda in the front office are excellent. The side sea views of the rooms on the high floors of the hotel are acceptable, and the room hygiene and room service are commendable. The flaw is that the shelf space in the bathroom part is too small, the soap must be slippery, and it must be picked up when it slips. It is recommended to add additional shelves and replace the curved bathroom handle to avoid such risks. During the Spring Festival, the hotel made an exception and provided us with a sumptuous New Year's Eve buffet dinner. I am very grateful to the restaurant manager Bi Xia. However, the check-in is almost half-full, and the follow-up arrangements for breakfast and catering are slightly chaotic, resulting in poor dining experience for some guests, and the hotel's backup plan provides insufficient meals. It is recommended to encourage a time-sharing meal plan. There is basically no concierge service for the drop-off at the end of the store, or it can be strengthened.

There is no alternative to buy. It is not worth the money. I am too lazy to argue with them. I don’t think I will stay in this hotel again next time. Halfway through, he decisively turned to Reggie next to him.

The reserved executive room was arranged on the 28th floor by the caring staff Henry. The scenery is good, and the fatigue was swept away. I experienced the afternoon tea and dinner in the executive lounge. I like it very much. I wanted to find a place to drink beer and watch the World Cup. The staff said that you can take beer back to the room to watch, nice! There are many types of breakfast. The chef made the egg rolls very much. It was a worthwhile trip.

msg:Hello everyone, I hope you will read it carefully when checking in. This is the second time I have chosen this hotel in a year.
1. The first time I felt that the service was very poor. The hotel staff who helped with transportation were unwilling to provide transportation services and looked very bad. They carried the whole process by themselves.
The second time, it was still the same this time. It’s still the same even after a year (bad reviews, friends should pay more attention)
2. The elasticity of hotel room rates varies greatly. It is recommended that you determine your travel dates and would rather get a refund after booking than renew the room on the recommendation of the hotel staff, and do not trust the room rate that their staff promised you. Unless there is written evidence at the time, their staff will shirk responsibility, so friends should pay more attention.
3. In terms of hygiene, it is just average. If you have a mysophobia, please choose carefully.
4. Go early for breakfast, or go late. Don't eat in the hotel for dinner, the price is very unfriendly and the food is not worth it.
This time I stayed in an executive sea view twin room and an executive deluxe double room, and stayed for 7 consecutive days. When you book a room again, try to choose a room without the executive room. Friends who are traveling with you will not If you have time, the executive lounge on the 30th floor provides free services, and it’s not worth it.
5. There is no free fruit provided on the first day of check-in. Remember that drinks in the room are free, please confirm with the front desk. Since I was busy at work and didn't have time to confirm in advance, I was told by their manager that they would give me drink service for two days. I was very grateful to her. When I checked out, the hotel customer service told me that every day was free. I was speechless for a moment. It's not that I have to drink it, it's just that this kind of unattractive behavior makes me think it's a bad review.

There are many rooms in the hotel, but the breakfast room is only a little bigger. Food is collected at 10 o'clock. On the first day, I hurriedly found a seat on the tail and ate a few bites before calling it a day. I went to the restaurant a little early the next day, but I had to wait in line. The salt and pepper shakers on the table are greasy. Why don't you clean them? There are few varieties of breakfast and the quality is too average. It is scattered in all directions. It takes a few minutes to walk around but you can't find anything to eat. There is no table service in the breakfast room. I made my own coffee, either there was no milk or it was clogged. Did the co-author deliberately let the guests wander around so that they could not get food?

msg:People who have never been too lazy to write reviews write reviews for Xiao Zhao.
Before I came, I was struggling with Ruiji and Haitian, so I just stayed with both.
The advantage of Haitian is the sea view suite, which is great for watching the sunrise. The area is also very spacious, with the main bathroom and the guest bathroom. The only disadvantage of the room type is that the bathroom and the main bathroom are too close to the sink, which will be very narrow.
I didn't have much hope for Haitian's service. After all, St. Regis' service is famous for its details. This time, Xiao Zhao's service was very considerate. At the beginning of the check-in, I was facing the peak check-out period. The weather was hot at noon, and the air conditioner was not turned on in the hotel lobby. I was prone to sweating while waiting. My nose began to sweat faintly, which caused me to be inexplicably irritable. There was a waiter who looked at the length of the queue and helped me lead to Xiao Zhao's queue to reduce the waiting time. When I moved my position, I complained about the slowness of your front office. At this time, the irritability index in my heart has skyrocketed like a dynamite barrel. just fried. But fortunately, Xiao Zhao's considerate service calmed me down as a "dynamite keg" haha. I asked Xiao Zhao from the floor to help me transfer to the 26th floor immediately, and told me that I could rest in the executive lounge and wait for her to swipe my card for me. The contact information is added so that I can find her at any time if I have any questions. The reply speed is super fast. Even if I find her on WeChat after get off work, I will reply in seconds and carefully ask me to bring a coat. I casually asked if there is a charge for the drinks in the refrigerator, Xiao Zhao directly helped me realize the freedom of the mini bar. It really made me feel at home, even if I went back to Hangzhou and checked out, I complained in the circle of friends that I was stuck by a fishbone in Qingdao, and Xiao Zhao immediately commented and told me some solutions. After checking out, it directly has nothing to do with her to draw a clear line, and the after-sales service is excellent. I'll find Xiao Zhao next time I book a room.
The afternoon tea and desserts in the executive lounge are average, and the light meals in the evening are quite rich. I overslept for breakfast and slept in the afternoon, so I can't comment. My mother said that it was similar to St. Regis' breakfast, so it should be of a good standard.

At that time, it was also two girls who were taking takeaways with cotton pads. It was past 11 o'clock in the evening.

I don't know if the sound insulation between the rooms is good or if there is no one next to it. At least the sound insulation of the corridor is not very good and the sound from the corridor can be heard.
Other facilities in the hotel are not very good, but the infinity pool on the 7th floor is good. With dressing room, wristband open cabinet, dry steam room. The infinity pool has its own invincible sea view and some city views. The area of the infinity pool by the sea is very shallow, which is about the depth of the bathtub. It is convenient for children who can't swim and take pictures with children.
If I go to Qingdao again, I will consider staying here again.
If the direction of the room is right, you can also see the sunrise or sunset. Across the road is the beach. The door is also open to the sea. There are nucleic acid checkpoints not far away. However, the nucleic acid test was not long, and there was no nucleic acid in the morning. A little further there is a community wide one. You can test it in the morning.

msg:You are not allowed to leave the city during the holidays, so just stay at Haitian for one night. If you contact the hotel before, there will be a butler to communicate with. If you have any questions, you can always contact the butler. It is still very convenient, and you don’t need to call the front desk. Xu, answer any questions and requests, we ordered an executive double bed. Due to the architectural design of Haitian, most of the rooms have side sea views and are divided into east and west sides. We have two rooms, one on one side, one on each side of Qingdao. There is scenery, and the administrative courtesy includes afternoon tea and light meals in the evening. If you don’t have too much quality requirements, you can eat enough. The 30th floor has a good view and is not blocked. The hotel room is not big, and the building materials are strong and heavy. Well, the variety is rich

They are busy with the elderly, and they also arrange the room in advance. The elderly are very satisfied. The hotel also prepared surprises for the two elderly people: flowers and cakes were prepared by Miss Nora Guo Jiamin at the front desk of the hotel for the two elderly people, and then delivered by brother Franz Yan Zifan in advance. It was a variety of experiences beyond expectations! For the golden wedding anniversary of the elderly, I was fortunate to choose Haitian Hotel, and I am 10,000 satisfied!

It is recommended that you book a suite. The sea view is excellent and the area is large. It is really comfortable to sit in the room and enjoy the sea view. Spare parts are Hermes, Dyson for electrical appliances, all complete.
Don't miss the two restaurants in the hotel: the afternoon tea restaurant on the roof provides some desserts, it is also good to sit and watch the sunset and the cafeteria on the 2nd floor, facing the sea, has a lot of varieties and freshly cooked rice noodles
Thanks to Miss Alice Bu and Manager Wang Chao for helping us spend a very pleasant trip to Qingdao

Eva also checked me early and checked out late. Exquisite afternoon tea on the 30th floor, cocktail tasting at night, fruit and various drinks and epidemic prevention kits were also presented in the room. Thank you so much for her! It made my stay very pleasant and comfortable. Of course, Haitian is also the hotel with the best room environment I have ever stayed in.

msg:Staying at Qingdao Haitian Hotel on August 20, I was surrounded by warm and beautiful air! Originally planned to stay for 3 days, but was retained by the beautiful sea view and warm and thoughtful service, so that the stay was extended until August 30! If it wasn't for the daughter's report on the 31st, we would definitely be staying until mid-September!
First of all, I commend Andy, the duty manager at the front desk, who took the initiative to reserve a side sea view room on the 31st floor with a beautiful sea view, and warmly introduced their best luxury sea view suite, but unfortunately it was already booked out. After checking in, the beautiful lady Ruby at the front desk kindly added my WeChat account to facilitate their better service! This WeChat really helped me a lot. After that, Henry at the front desk was also very good. He took the initiative to help me reserve the best deluxe sea view suite. , My daughter and I are very satisfied! Reluctant to leave!
Secondly, Mr. Song Xiao, the manager of the restaurant on the second floor, is very enthusiastic and professional. The second time I saw him, he actually knew my name and took the initiative to greet me and help me to get the meals twice. The restaurant waiter, Shang Qingxia, was also very enthusiastic. , help get drinks and red bean porridge! The restaurant has a wide variety of diets, all kinds of seafood, all kinds of delicious pastries, 5-6 kinds of hot fried vegetables, and many kinds of fruits, which can fully meet the needs of vitamins throughout the day! Another important point: Haitian is very a**ospheric, breakfast ends at 10 o'clock, and it is near the closing time (around 9:50), the chef will still replenish dishes and fruits, so that guests who arrive late can also eat hot meals and fresh fruit! This is the best among all five-star hotels in the country, except for the Four Seasons Hotel in Beijing, which is the Haitian Hotel!

Maybe because of the epidemic in Sanya, the number of tourists in Qingdao has increased. There was a queue for breakfast at the Westin the night before, Haitian was okay, and the elevator was not too congested. Ruby at the front desk really thank you very much, and arranged for me a room with a good view. The room has a fresh air system and an air purifier, and it is very comfortable to live in. Make a suggestion for the buffet dinner to be improved.

Having stayed in many five-star hotels, I feel that Haitian has nothing to fault from room design to service. The room has a good sea view, the bathroom, shower and bathtub are reasonably partitioned, the smart toilet is advanced, the electric curtains, the welcome handwritten card, and the capsule coffee machine are all online. The executive benefits include afternoon tea in the executive lounge and light meals in the evening. The children are very tired after playing in the water, and it is very comfortable to have a light meal after bathing. I ate afternoon tea on the first day, and had breakfast on the executive floor on the last day. Personally, I felt that the administrative courtesy was in place. Looking at Qingdao's iconic red tiles, green trees, blue sea and blue sky, I felt that this is a vacation and rest, and I have motivation. Back to being a social animal. Thanks to the hotel for making us spend a pleasant four-day vacation~

The only flaw is the bathroom, the aisle is designed to be very narrow, it is not convenient to open the door, and the luxury suite is still small. Also, the location of the hotel is very good. At night, you can take children to the beach to catch crabs, and the children are very happy.

msg:In addition to the beautiful scenery of Qingdao, I was deeply impressed by this holiday in Qingdao, that is, Qingdao Haitian Hotel made me spend the most comfortable night. At first, I thought the hotel was a bit expensive, but after checking in, I found it was really worth it! In terms of facilities, because it is a five-star hotel and it is newly opened soon, it will not be bad! In terms of the location of the hotel, let alone the word "beauty", you can see the sunrise and sunset from the room from the room. Let's talk about the most important services! From the moment you enter the lobby, someone will guide you to the front desk to check in. The front desk service staff, Ms. Vera and Ron, are super helpful and answer any questions. I know that we have an old man who wants to see the sea-view room from a high place. beautiful view! Jack from the Executive Lounge on the 30th floor warmly introduced the afternoon tea time in the lounge and solved practical difficulties for us. Room service is also very good, not only with warm notes but also delicious fruit. The swimming pool on the 7th floor has excellent views and the water temperature is very warm. Finally, comment on the taste, scenery and service of the buffet breakfast on the 2nd floor. A little more people make the restaurant a bit messy! (It is estimated that it is due to the peak meal period), and finally summed up, I will definitely come back next time, there is a feeling of coming home!

msg:This stay experience was very bad! ! !
My advice is: if you don’t want to be upset, don’t stay at this hotel!
A total of more than 6 very bad things happened this time. Our feelings can be summed up in one sentence: a hotel that can’t even do superficial work in order to make more money! If you plan to stay at this hotel, I hope you can read these 5 things I am going to say. It will challenge my patience again and again! (In order to provide details and express our anger, this article is very long. If you have limited time, you can just read the subtitles of each incident)
1) When checking in, we had to wait for 2 and a half hours for a room: We booked two rooms and went to the hotel to check in at 3:30 pm. We were told that one of the rooms was not ready and could not be checked in, and that we did not know how to get it. How long can I wait? I can only wait for a phone call. In the end I waited nearly 3 hours.
2) The hotel’s buffet restaurant has a poor experience and did not inform about the options for meals and set meals: while waiting to check in, the children were hungry and did not want to rush to eat elsewhere without rest, so we chose The hotel's buffet restaurant. I called in advance to make an appoin**ent and asked about the price, which was 398 per person. First of all, the food was very poor. The head of the crayfish was black and blue, and the steak and sushi were hard and dry. There was no name of the food next to many of the foods, which caused me to accidentally take a bite of the durian pizza, which I personally hate. The most important thing is that after eating for nearly 2 hours, when we were about to pay the bill and leave, the service staff told us that there were still some items included in package A that were not available. The four of us looked puzzled because there was no mention of the option of a package before. As for food, if we had not chosen to pay on site but had paid the room bill from beginning to end, we would not have known that there were set meals and individual meals.
3) The computer screen was damaged during our stay: We had every reason to suspect that the cleaning staff had damaged the screen of our Apple computer. The hotel had no intention of compensating for the cost of repairing the screen, nor did it allow its cleaning staff to explain the situation to us. We can understand the hotel's behavior and rhetoric as suspecting that we spent more than 20,000 yuan to stay in the hotel and deliberately broke the computer screen to extort the hotel's repair fee. My husband's profession is closely related to computers, so we are very careful when handling his computer. There is no possibility that it has been dropped or flooded recently. After arriving in Qingdao, we happened to confirm with him/his family twice that the computer screen was intact. ! After leaving the hotel the next day, when he came back and turned on the computer again, the screen was severely blurred! After communicating with the hotel staff, they suggested that we call the police. The compensation they offered was a free meal at the buffet (the one I just complained about). They also said that the restaurant had very good online reviews (4.3 stars in one review), which was very speechless. The price for repairing an Apple computer screen is around 3,000 yuan. Should we consider ourselves unlucky and pay the full cost of screen repair without any reason?
4) The dining experience in the hotel room is very bad and the menu is not clearly marked: It is 11pm and I want to order the menu from 9:30pm to 7am. There is no beef burger on the menu, all the ice cream is not available, and the mashed potatoes are not available. If you want to order a sirloin steak, it says choose one: French fries, mashed potatoes; choose any side dishes: stir-fried vegetables, salad. I believe that anyone who has completed nine years of compulsory education will understand this explanation to mean that they can only choose one of the former, and they can choose both of the latter. When we called to order, we were told that we could only choose one of the two.
5) The price of hotel rooms has increased significantly: in February it was only 569 per night, at the end of July the price was around 2100, and in early August the price even rose to more than 4000.
6) There are other problems such as: I have to queue for a long time for breakfast, the air purifier in the room shows that the filter element needs to be replaced but it has not been replaced, and I suspect that the cleaning staff fiddled with my washed underwear hanging in the cloakroom (because the underwear was inexplicably wrapped around On the clothes rack (my husband and I have never been to that area during this period), the bathroom door and bathtub are poorly designed, etc.

Just the good attitude of some staff cannot change the fact that so many angry and sad problems have occurred. The saying "give a candy to a slap in the face" could not be more suitable for this hotel, but we were "slapped" Lots of slaps."
In the end, it took about 5 or 6 conversations about the damage to the computer screen before we agreed to refund part of the room fee, about 1,000 yuan, plus a meal at Haitian Chinese Restaurant the day before we left. The outcome of our handling of this incident was not satisfactory. Satisfied, first of all we were not interested in dining at their designated restaurants, which also disrupted our itinerary plans. Secondly, we still have to bear the screen repair fee of about 2,000+ yuan, which also makes my husband completely unable to carry out his work during the past few days in Qingdao. Finally, the manager also allowed us to write complaints but never give a low score on Ctrip. It’s really funny. Do you think customers are stupid and easy to bully? ? This is my first negative review in so many years using Ctrip! ! ! !

The price has risen sharply in the summer, but there are really a lot of people. There are messy guests everywhere. The room is not big, and the experience is very general if there are many people. Living on the 27th floor, the elevator has to stop several times every time you go up and down the stairs. It was hot and humid, and the children were very dissatisfied. The handsome guy Steven and the beautiful Tina who checked in at the front desk were enthusiastic and responsible, and the room card for one of the two rooms was a little late and they were delivered in person. One disadvantage is that I booked two rooms, and the bathroom of each room smelled of urine as soon as I entered the bathroom. I thought about changing rooms and I had to endure it. This should not be the case for the bathroom of this middle-class hotel.

There is a child who basically stayed in the room for two days to see the scenery. Go downstairs to the seaside, reefs, and beaches. The design of the hotel swimming pool is also very friendly to children. The children's pool is by the sea, and the water is warm and comfortable near noon.
In addition, I would like to make two suggestions. I hope the hotel can go further: 1. After the main switch is turned off at night, all the light control panels will flash, and they are very bright, which affects the rest too much. I hope to improve the design. 2. Optimize the variety of breakfast.

There were no disposable slippers, so I had to call to ask for them. 3. Many switches were broken. 4. The hair dryer was broken. 5. The bedside lamp was still on after turning off the main switch at night, and I had to ask an engineer to remove the light bulb in the middle of the night. 6.

Gym treadmill is also looking at the sea running. It's just that there are few types of breakfast, so the breakfast is not very good. When I was there, there were probably more meetings and business banquets, and there were people in black pants and white shirts. Entering the hotel also requires a security check bag, which should be the first time I encountered it.

There is a nucleic acid detection point a few hundred meters away. The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. The bed and the delivered latex pillows are very comfortable. The executive floor is reserved, and the executive lounge is convenient for children to use fruits and snacks. The Internet celebrity punched in downstairs, very close to various attractions, not bad.

msg:Location: It is very convenient to take a taxi. The beach is just downstairs. There is a beach and you can play on the beach after the low tide. You can walk along the coastline to the May Fourth Square at night. happy 😁

Environment: There is nothing to say about the hotel environment. The elevators are disinfected quickly and regularly, and the ice cream on the first floor is also good. The cafeteria on the second floor looks at the sea, the Chinese restaurant on the third floor and the executive lounge on the 30th floor look at the Badaguan. The room is super invincible sea view, the living room, bedroom and bathroom are all sea view👍

Service: We added Eva's WeChat from check-in, explained the restaurant's dining time, afternoon tea time, nucleic acid testing points, etc. We also sent coupons in great detail. We also have questions and answers on WeChat. Super comfortable. The supplementary food for breakfast is very fast. There is basically no need to queue up for a certain food, and many staff close in time. The afternoon tea in the executive lounge is a bit unsatisfactory. The food is not exquisite, the taste is sweet, and there are too many people. The happy hour in the evening is also the main staple food and roast chicken and fried chicken. It's to solve the guests' dinner 😂 but the ladies and sisters who serve are very good. The key point must be to praise the staff of Sansha Japanese Restaurant (I don’t know the name) because my daughter doesn’t like fish and seafood and doesn’t want to leave the hotel. I called to see if I could take away the wagyu fried rice, vegetable tempura, and sizzling vegetables. The staff said that they are actually a set meal, but they can help me order it because my daughter doesn't like the taste of shrimp, so I made a normal Chawanmushi, because I am a public comment and I asked about the dessert flower pot when I saw it was delicious. The girl said that it was already off the shelf, so I ordered a milk jelly, but when I picked up the meal, the chef said that the chef specially made a flower pot. When I returned to the room, my daughter said that I had experienced VIP service. Thank you to the staff of Sansha🙏🙏
The Chinese restaurant is also a hotel with normal quality and delicious food. There is a girl who just came to practice for three days and wears glasses. She is very polite and considerate. She looks a bit silly (not derogatory, but feels like her daughter's good friend) Sorry for not remembering the name, I can't write it in the review.

Hygiene: Auntie cleans very cleanly and responds to requests!
All in all, this trip to Qingdao was super enjoyable! I have stayed at the Westin Shangri-La InterContinental before, but I have not had a good experience with Haitian. I will come again. If you don't go to the attractions, you will enjoy the vacation when you stay in the hotel!

msg:The hotel was demolished and rebuilt on the original site of the old shop. It is very new. It is right on the seaside and very close to the May Fourth Square. It can be said that it is the ceiling of the Qingdao Hotel. We booked a sea view suite, but it was a pity that it was foggy for two days, and there was no sea view with blue sky and blue sea. It is a little regretful that we can only come again next time. The infinity swimming pool is also great. Children can swim by themselves. The executive suite includes breakfast, including breakfast (until 10 o'clock), afternoon tea (2-5 pm) and happy hour evening meal (6-8 pm), so it feels like eating and drinking all day~~ afternoon tea and dinner can be Seeing the city view of Qingdao, the meals are also very good, and the drinks are free to drink, which is really good! But I want to complain about the breakfast. First of all, there are a lot of people, and there is no one to take the seat. Second, the meal is received at 10 o'clock, but at 9:30, the place where the noodles are cooked is accompanied by a plate of vegetables and vegetables. I went there for two mornings and was told that there was no, it was huge A five-star hotel does not know why there are no vegetables. In terms of fruit, there are very few varieties. If we go late, the watermelon will be gone. The sushi and bean curd have always been in a state of no and no more. For breakfast, we can only eat casually. Who told us to go late? ... Miss Tina at the front desk is very attentive and enthusiastic. During the period, we dropped something when we changed rooms, and we quickly retrieved it. Give it a thumbs up!

Transportation: Because it is a self-driving tour, parking is very convenient. Plenty of underground parking spaces. There are special charging piles for incoming calls, and charging is also very convenient. Free parking.

Environment: The beach is just outside the hotel, with small crabs, small turtles, and small shells. The sand is fine. The internal environment of the hotel is also very good, and the breakfast has both Chinese and Western styles. The variety is rich, there are fruit area, dairy products, coffee juice area, Chinese food area, salad area... It is really the ceiling of Qingdao hotel. The room is newly renovated, with all kinds of intelligent IoT, the door of the bathroom will be opened when the toilet is dry, the door will be opened, and the curtains will automatically open; the TV will display the name of the welcome guest. Nestle's capsule coffee machine, English black tea is very good. The quality of the mattress and bed is very comfortable, with moderate hardness and softness, which is really worth the price.


Service: The service is also very good. The hotel staff will take the initiative to add WeChat, if you have any questions, you can communicate at any time. Special thanks to Xiao Shao and Yahui for their warm and thoughtful service.

msg:It is said to be the best hotel in Qingdao at present, and it has been repeatedly chosen between St. Regis and Haitian for a long time. In the end, I decided to live in Haitian, which has the best feedback.
On the day of arrival, the sun was shining brightly, and when I got off the bus, I felt that Qingdao had resumed the flow of people before the epidemic. The fresh fragrance and comfortable body temperature coming from the hotel lobby soothed my tiredness.
The check-in time happened to be the peak period for check-out, and I felt that the front desk was obviously understaffed, and there were a lot of things to show when checking in. There was a little sister named Tina who received me. She was very enthusiastic and organized. She sorted out all the crowd of passengers in front of her with ease and dexterity. This detail can obviously test the skills of the hotel management. After all, most of the complaints actually come from the first impression and experience.
The hotel room is indeed the configuration of a standard star hotel. The modern design style is modern and simple, and the use of stone, logs and glass is indeed remarkable.
As a long-term hotel stay, I give 8 points overall. 9 points is still my favorite W Hotel Shanghai North Bund.

The hotel is in a superior location, within walking distance to May Fourth Square and Badaguan. It has high-end positioning, thoughtful service and complete facilities. The opposite is the invincible sea view, adjacent to the first Three baths, the hotel's fitness swimming pool is also full of floor-to-ceiling windows, which is amazing. The best thing is Miss Eva at the front desk, who is considerate and thoughtful, arranges the service into the details, and left a very good impression.

Maybe now in order to attract passengers, the executive lounge is full of children, very noisy. There is a handmade chaotic area for breakfast. In the end, due to the large number of people, the waiter Bai Jinton took it slowly, and finally simply used quick-frozen wonton stew instead of the handmade chaotic. On the whole, I forget whether the restaurant on the fifth or sixth floor is okay, more affordable, and there are not many people. The overall three-star, five-star hotel is not only the environment, the service is very important!

The hotel is located in the Haitian Center, a landmark building in Qingdao. The vision is wide, you can see part of the sea view, the service is good, and the fruit is also delivered, which can be met in time if you need it. Kudos to ellen Xiaoshen, and waiter Li Guang👍 It's just that the simple meals in the executive lounge are a little simpler. There are many customers every day, obviously there are not enough dishes.

The hotel&#39;s room is very large and the facilities are perfect. There are automatic curtains and a smart toilet, which is very good to use. The hotel also sent welcome fruit, which is very considerate. The location of the hotel is very good, the beach is right out the door, and it is also close to the subway station. It is also very close to the third beach, which is very convenient for travel and tourism. The hotel&#39;s breakfast is very rich and tastes good, especially the braised pork with wontons, fried rice and soy milk are very delicious. The happy hour and afternoon tea on the 30th floor are also very good, and you can also see the city view of Qingdao. The service of the hotel is also very good and the staff are very professional. This time, just in time for the Qingdao Summit, there were a lot of people. Thanks to Miss Lisa who helped me arrange a room on the 20th floor this time, this room can not only see the sea, but also the L-shaped window of the room, which can perfectly enjoy the scenery of Qingdao coast. At the same time, Miss lLisa also kindly told me the time of the executive lounge and breakfast and the location of the nearby nucleic acid testing points. Allow me to arrange travel reasonably. What surprised me the most was the Valentine&#39;s Dam at night. Thanks to her timely notification, I found the best observation point for the light show. It also avoids the white run of Taitung Night Market. thank you very much. I am very happy to have such a good check-in experience this time and to see the perfect light show that day. Thanks again to Lisa Xiaowang, although this trip is only one and a half days, it is very unforgettable.

Toiletries are all Hermes, showing the grade! The fruit plate sent is also very fresh, and the mineral water is also provided enough! Let me talk about the shortcomings: the hygiene needs to be improved. As soon as I entered the door, I saw a few large pieces of flower hair on the ground. The cleaning aunt cleaned it up in time. There are also many large white flower hairs on the quilt, similar to washed paper towels. Pay attention! In addition, many control buttons in the room are out of control. Sometimes the lights cannot be turned on when they are turned off, and they cannot be turned off when they are turned on. The hardware facilities need to be repaired! Generally speaking, the stay is quite comfortable. I mention the housekeeper Henry here, and the attitude is very good

msg:Haitian is No. 1 in the eyes of Qingdao people. It is an old brand for decades. It is the first time to experience it after reopening. Whether it is hardware or software, the food in the restaurant is delicious, and the service is also worthy of its name~ Brother Ron's professionalism, and the enthusiastic guidance of the concierge brother Owen on the way to the room, definitely reflects the professionalism of Haitian. Sylar has been busy for us and I can't help but sigh that Haitian in Qingdao is still the original Haitian, or even better. Going upstairs, finally, I also thank the duty manager Ben for his constant care during the stay. When I checked out, I didn't find a pair of Prada earphone chains, thinking I didn't know where it was lost. I told the front desk with the mentality of trying it out. It didn't take long to contact me to find it. The feeling of being lost and found is as wonderful as the scenery outside the Haitian window. All five points are praised. Everyone, hurry up and book a room to experience it.

As soon as I walked in, the scenery outside the window really shocked me. I feel that the sea in Qingdao can be so beautiful, the layout of the rooms is also in place, and the services in all aspects, the executive lounge and the breakfast buffet are also very nice! On the whole, whether you are traveling to Qingdao or people in Qingdao want to feel the seascape, Haitian Hotel is highly recommended. In addition, I would like to thank Ellen Xiaoshen and Phoebe Xiaosun for their patient service. From the consultation before booking to the various requirements after check-in, they will try their best to meet us. Thank you again!

Thanks to Mia and Ruby for their service, kind and not destroying the parent-child a**osphere!

For those who are familiar with Qingdao, Lao Haitian means a high-end environment and meticulous and considerate service.

Xinhaitian, the hardware is domineering and upgraded, and the decoration style is Chinese, but it also incorporates the style of Western-style chain hotels.

The bedroom and living room are more than 80 square meters, and the price is very cheap in the off-season. The most striking thing is the sea view from the floor-to-ceiling windows in this big corner. You can watch the sunrise on the sea in the morning, and there is also a beautiful night view in the evening. The larger one of the two bathrooms also has a sea view, and the executive lounge on the 30th floor also has a sea view. The corner design can be seen anywhere. To the city or sea view. The afternoon tea and light meals in the lounge are delicious. They are more refined and thoughtful than most of the 5-star free meals. It is better to experience it when there are fewer people. It is not like the Marriott-style lounge like a vegetable market. The hall is huge, the design is stylish, and the service of the doorman is in place. The first room seems to have a strange smell from the snail noodles that the previous guests have eaten. It will be fine after changing the room. The sanitation can also be cleaned up by the ash waiter immediately. Mattress quilt pillow no smell. The materials and design of the furniture, sofas, tables and chairs are very good. Dyson's hair dryer air purification, Hermes cleaning, smag kettle, the overall is very good. A small suggestion, the bed sheet is hard, it is pure cotton but not silky enough, it should be the bedding experience of JW Marriott or Waldorf Astoria. Two yukatas are best, one big and one small. The quality is very good, but the big one said he felt a little small.

On the last two days of the Qingming holiday, our family of four came to the new landmark of the island city, the new Haitian Hotel, and stayed in the executive side sea view room on the 22nd floor. The room is not too big. It looks like more than 30 square meters. The double bed is about 2.5 meters in size. It is no problem to sleep two big and two small. Special thanks to Steven and Mac at the front desk, who thoughtfully prepared a bed stop for our sister to sleep in. The bathroom is half open, the electric toilet works well, and the hairdryer is a bit noisy. The swimming pool is not open during the Qingming Festival, but the executive lounge is open, the afternoon tea is quite satisfactory, and the happy hour in the evening is also average, which is a bit improvised. But the service staff in the executive lounge is really nice. My sister cried at dinner at night. We were afraid that it would affect others, so we were ready to take it away. The waiter in the executive lounge hurried over to ask the baby if there was any problem, and then chased the elevator to the elevator. I gave my sister a lollipop and told her to be happy. Really warm! The service staff in the room are also very nice, delivering water and fruit, very timely and thoughtful. In short, except for the food that is a little unpalatable, the rest are full marks! Will come again for the weekend!

He helped to set aside the room in advance and made small arrangements. My girlfriends and I both felt very warm. The hotel is modernly decorated, simple and generous. I like this style very much.

msg:A great hotel, great value for money! Right by the sea, the best location in Qingdao, the service is super good.
🔔Service: First of all, the most important thing to praise is the service. From getting out of the car and opening the car door, the breath of the sea and the enthusiastic service staff who helped the door open the door. Entering the lobby is also a guide all the way. The lady at the front desk, Alice, is what I must praise. Yes, I was upgraded with a sea view king bed, and the executive room also helped me choose a high floor. The whole service is reliable and considerate. When I came back in the afternoon, I not only prepared welcome fruits, but also hand-painted a small card for me, which really warms my heart when I work in a different place.
🍃 Environment:
The environment is definitely the best place in Qingdao. It faces the sea and is surrounded by business circles. The view from the past is the sea on one side and Badaguan on the other. The location is excellent.
🚗 Transportation:
The transportation is also very convenient. It is not far from the surrounding scenic spots. There is Haitian's own shopping mall, Haitian Mall, and it is not far from the Vientiane City.
In short, it really makes me write a review so seriously because it is really good, and I will choose it next time I go ~ highly recommended

msg:Sitting between the mountains and the sea, resting on the clouds.

-design-
The hotel is located in the front row of sea views near Taipingjiao in Qingdao, adjacent to the St. Regis Hotel. As a continuation of the new work of Qingdao Haitian Hotel, the owner of Haitian Hotel also invited CCD to design the interior. The overall style has many design elements from previous works, and also incorporates the local elements of Qingdao. The overall tone is restrained and solemn. In terms of materials, a lot of stone and wood are used, and the cyan color is very prominent in it, but it does not destroy the overall style, which is just right. The use of cyan and green in the executive lounge is more thorough, and the style is also continued.

-Room-
The room size is acceptable, and the semi-open bathroom can make the overall space more open. The independent wardrobe design surrounds the entry and exit positions, the moving lines are reasonable, and it is better in terms of feng shui. The bathroom is only in place, and the washlet is standard. The bathroom accessories used in the executive rooms are Agraria, a San Francisco cleaning and care brand used by InterContinental. The lemon verbena smells very good.
The overall sanitation in the room is quite good, and the bathrobes and slippers are also of the top level. Except for the slightly mediocre selection of the hairdryer, there is nothing wrong with other aspects.
However, among other hardware, the intelligent experience is slightly lower, the intelligence of the room control system is limited, and the basic electric curtains and sunshades are available, but the lighting design is slightly regrettable, the controllable scenes are limited, and the lights at the entrance cannot be turned off directly. A lot of lights in the room are designed in retro gas style. Although they are quite distinctive, they are slightly less practical. Soft wall washers and other surface lights should bring a better experience.
The teapot is a very rare smeg kettle, and the Nespresso and twg tea leaves are also the standard of this level.
The selection of bedding is qualified. The picky point is that there is no fur cushion on the mattress. Fortunately, the softness and support of the mattress are not bad, as well as a variety of optional material pillows, and the sleeping experience is qualified. .
The room is located on the 31st floor of the top floor. The angle of the side sea view is limited by the building next door. The viewing angle is as shown in the figure.

-breakfast-
The breakfast dining environment can be said to be very pleasant. Thanks to the spacious location and reasonable dining flow, the seating guidance and dining experience are very good. The most attractive of course is the invincible sea view. There are also many kinds of breakfast, the ingredients are also very fresh, and the comments from peers are also very good.

-Serve-
The overall service level is online, and the situation is as follows: the executive lounge is located on the 30th floor. Since the tea break time has passed, only soft drinks are available. However, the female staff of the executive lounge saw our 2 rooms. A total of 4 guests in the executive room did not give good guidance after entering, and made an inappropriate reminder when we took the soft drink, and the companion felt a little embarrassed after hearing it. It should be around 20:20 when we entered, the staff has already started cleaning, and they are talking loudly, the experience is slightly poor. In addition, when we checked in and out, the concierge at the entrance of the hotel did not help to take the luggage to the car. I hope the hotel can improve these two points in the future.

-parking-
The location of the parking lot is clear, and the charging pile for the special call is near the entrance of the elevator in the hotel basement, but the equipment is still being debugged until the time of departure. Guests who need charging can check whether it is ready for use in advance.

-grateful-
The space is limited, and the content is based on feelings. In the end, I would like to thank Ge Lingkang, Eric and Nora from the front office, who not only met our needs and helped us arrange the same floor, but also gave a comprehensive introduction to the hotel's facilities and locations. There are also meal times and executive courtesy. I hope colleagues from other depar**ents of the hotel can learn from him about guest service. Next time I come to Qingdao, I will choose to stay at Haitian Hotel.

The view of the executive sea view room is perfect for looking for peace in a daze. The breakfast is good, and the gym equipment is all brand new and shiny. I hope to develop the spa business as soon as possible, and there is no regret.

The most annoying thing was that after checking out on 8.17, the credit card pre-sale had not been refunded until 8.24. I called I asked and was told that the refund would be made within 1-3 working days. It has already been 5 working days. It was obvious that the hotel had forgotten to refund the refund.

Later, I found out that the old hotel Haitian Hotel has been newly renovated and upgraded. After making an appoin**ent, call the front desk. Consultation, I didn't expect a customer service Ellen Xiaoshen to immediately add me to WeChat for service tracking (really very careful), and even help me upgrade my room, and thank Manager Mandy Shi for his approval. This hotel is definitely the biggest surprise of my trip to Qingdao! Although it is only a side sea view, the height view is really great. You must eat breakfast, it's so hearty! !

There are four areas underground, and the hotel elevator is in area A. If you don't drive, there are buses on both roads. There is a subway station on Hong Kong West Road.
🧹Sanitation: The room is clean. The bedding is new. No odor. Smart toilet is very comfortable hahahaha~
🍃Environment: The side sea view room I booked is not very spacious, but it has everything. Not much to say about the surrounding environment, the coastal facade and the sea are all comfortable.
🔔Service: The most important thing when staying in a hotel is hygiene and service. The Haitian experience is really perfect. From customer service to room cleaning to the recreation center to the front desk, there is nothing to be picky about. Just that all the service staff you meet will make you very happy. Franz, the little brother at the front desk, has good looks and good service, and will meet your small requirements for the room. 👍🏻
Recommended breakfast and executive benefits are worth it.

msg:It is one of the most upscale hotels in Qingdao. The hotel is very new and the decoration has its own style. When we checked in, it was difficult. The three rooms that arrived at 5:30 were not cleaned up. After waiting for 20 minutes, one was finally cleaned up. The last room was exaggerated until 8:00. This is really uncomfortable. The front desk explained that there are too many rooms to be cleaned. Overall, the environment is good, the transportation is convenient, and the scenery is beautiful. However, there may be a gap between the service of the big brand hotels and the chain.

msg:Xinhaitian is still highly recommended. The service and facilities are actually very good. The staff at the front desk, restaurant, and executive lounge are very friendly. The reason for not giving all five stars is that the room is too hot and too dry. I slept at 5:00 and put water in the bathtub to humidify it. I am in Qingdao, how can it be so dry? The air conditioner was adjusted to 16 degrees, and it was still hot at night. My mother didn't sleep well all night... Later, I responded to the staff, and the hotel apologized, and then nothing happened. This still needs to be improved.
I booked a side sea view room with an executive lounge, and the view of the arranged room is good, thank you. Afternoon tea desserts are very good, a lot of varieties. Cocktails and light meals are served in the evening. The breakfast is very satisfactory. I went after seven o'clock and found the best place with the best view.
Come and have a buffet later when you have time. After all, Haitian is the benchmark for hotels in Qingdao people's hearts.

msg:Let's talk about the place worth complimenting---
Location: Good location, close to the sea, most of the rooms have side view of the sea, in the middle of the podium, close to the St. Regis Hotel.
Hotel decoration: It is a new hotel after the renovation of the original state-owned hotel. It is said that the renovation took several years. The exterior is very new, and the interior is also very fashionable, especially the overall color matching of the hotel room and corridor, as well as most of the hotel supplies in the room. The color scheme is black, white and gray, which is fashionable and durable. It is my favorite color.
Room matching: It is very meticulous and comprehensive, and the details of the supplies can still be done.
Service level: The more "golden key" employees a hotel has, the higher the service level of the hotel. During my stay in Haitian, I met two "golden key" employees, and I can also appreciate the warm and thoughtful, meticulous and meticulous service level of the upper and lower employees, who are good at understanding the details of the guests and responding in a timely manner, which is especially praised.
Catering package: The breakfast is still very rich, which belongs to the normal level of a five-star hotel, but the level of the waiters is average, which is very different from the staff in the front hall like the golden key. Not very familiar with the business. Because I live on the executive floor, and there are afternoon tea and dinner packages, they are relatively simple and simple, and there are many people who enjoy it, so there is nothing desirable. On the evening of the New Year's Eve, because I couldn't book a restaurant, I could only call for a delivery service. The food was very good, and the fruit was delivered very considerately, which is worthy of praise.
Let's talk about the shortcomings:
1. The sanitary details in the room are not done enough. There are obvious stains on the bathroom floor, and adult stains on the wooden decorative pillars in the house are also obvious. On the day of the first check-in, there are obvious previous guests left at the door. The cotton swabs were obviously not cleaned thoroughly, the sanitation staff were too flustered, and I felt very bad.
2. During the lease renewal time, the sanitation personnel came to clean the house, and their professionalism was worrying. People like the foreman used a vacuum cleaner to make me feel afraid of the cleaning of the ground. Kind of disgusting.
3. The details of the decoration in the room are still not perfect. Around the smoke detector probe on the roof, the ruins and holes left by the decoration are still standing, which has lowered the hotel by several grades, which is completely inconsistent with the four 5 star hotel standard.
4. Although the toiletries from InterContinental, Hilton and other Crabtree are used, I always feel that since the slogan is to become a well-known chain hotel brand, there should be exclusive toiletries.

The sea and the sky are excellent, and there is a quiet three-bathroom in front. I booked an executive sea-view double room, a room with a full sea view, the room looks at the sea, and the bathroom also looks at the sea. Ever since I was young, I have lived by the sea, and I still love watching the sea.
The room is very large, with a cloakroom, and the sink is large, spacious and bright. The curtain is automatic, and the curtain is automatically opened when the door is opened. The air purifier in the room is a plus. The structure of the room is reasonable, the color matching is correct but not old-fashioned. The only flaw is that some small details of the decoration are a bit rough, not the heaviness of an old hotel.
In the executive room, enjoy afternoon tea in the executive lounge on the 30th floor and happy hour in the evening.
In addition, thanks to the front desk EVA and the concierge Lee, who are thoughtful and professional. Ctrip helped arrange free refrigerator meals for the first check-in, helped arrange the room floor satisfaction, helped late check-out on the anniversary, and arranged free room fruits. The guest room also presented an anti-epidemic protective bag and a welcome card. Take your time, thank you.

msg:After staying at St. Regis for a few days, I moved to Haitian to experience it. I cannot say that the management level of Qingdao Guoxin** Hotel can be described in two words in Qingdao dialect: blind (what a pity)!

The Japanese Haitian Hotel 35 years ago is dead. Except for the higher floors, everything else is much lower than the level of Haitian. With such a good location and a price of six to seven hundred yuan, compared with hotels of the same price range in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai, there is a huge gap in what is provided to guests. Professional hotels are run by professional companies. It is an insult to the beauty of this beach to entertain yourself under a bureaucracy like Guoxin.

1-The hardware is good, but it lacks the soft culture of an international chain hotel. Every time you go out, you have to go to the front desk to check out the vehicle. Is this the level of the Jimo County Party Committee Guest House?
2-The glass of the guest room with sea view is covered with fingerprints. The kettle leaks, the automatic toilet often malfunctions, the water for rinsing the buttocks won't stop, and the control buttons don't work. Do you want guests to have sex on the toilet? (The simpler the hotel automation is, the better. It is best to have instructions posted on the wall)
3-None of the breakfast items are eye-catching, the cold table is full of flying insects, the kelp silk is as hard as leather *****s, a small amount of cheap red sausage, duck meat, and cheese are disappointing, a few sweets, and the bread looks like a bargain at first glance. , Qingdao's special sweet foam is neither fish nor fowl and has no characteristics at all.
4- At the breakfast buffet, the chefs stare at you with dull eyes, which makes you feel uncomfortable.
5-The waiter collects the plates in a timely manner, but often asks you if you have finished eating? Is this urging guests to leave?
Come on, conceited Qingdao people. Qingdao is the only city in the country that can still put money on Shandong's face. If this continues, the tragedy of the decline of the three eastern provinces will not be far away in Shandong.

msg:Haitian Hotel is really a childhood memory. When I was a child, I liked this hotel by the sea very much. Now it has been rebuilt with a new look, giving people a different experience. Ron, the younger brother at the front desk, was enthusiastic and gave positive feedback on the problems I reported. The security of the hotel is also very responsible. Since there was an abnormal noise when sleeping at night, the front desk and the security guard worked together to strengthen inspections; the executive lounge also has a lot of food types, the quality of red and white wine is also good, and the service is very warm ,intimate.
A few suggestions:
1. Increase children's special room types and increase children's activity areas (small playground or reading bar)
2. Do not charge for drinks in the executive room type, because you can get the same type of drinks in the lounge, it is better to cancel the fee to make people feel more a**ospheric. (actually not much to drink)
3. Provide turndown service
4. The swimming pool provides a small drying machine, which is convenient for guests to dry swimsuits

msg:The girl’s 20th birthday was 390 meters away at the highest hotel in Shandong, Haitian Hotel! People go to higher places, try to be auspicious. The important thing is: the hotel not only gives unexpected surprises and warmth, but also gives the little girl an enlightenment full of positive energy on how to be a person and how to be dedicated! The hotel has given many good courtesies. The key is that ms. Lisa Wang of Haitian Hotel organizes and coordinates from beginning to end, but after willing to make arrangements silently... I really want to thank her in person!

He upgraded the room type and provided us with breakfast. We stayed for four days. Poor sea view! The breakfast wontons are super delicious. We basically contracted billiards and swimming in the off-season. Zhu Qingfei and Kou Yuxuan from the Recreation Center borrowed swimming caps for us. The aunt helped us tidy up the room and fold our clothes every day. I couldn’t be more satisfied with the hotel~

Steven and Nora at the front desk sent me a birthday card and red wine after learning about it, and took photos as a souvenir. I am very grateful. I booked an 82-square-meter sea view suite on Ctrip. The room is so big and the sea view is so beautiful. From the front desk to the restaurant to the parking lot, the young employees are also friendly and dedicated. Now I am back to my old place, everything is brand new again, and this birthday is meaningful.

Haitian is the chief five-star hotel in Qingdao. The location is unique and the renovated hotel is full of high-tech: Kohler smart toilet, bed Head speaker smart curtains, here we focus on praising the lovely front desk tina dennis for caring and giving the mini bar. Thank you very much for receiving the warm service from the hotel staff from getting off the car outside the hotel to the lobby and then checking out. In the hotel cafeteria Eating food and watching the sea and admiring the sunrise is refreshing. After breakfast, I walked along the seaside plank road to my favorite place, Badaguan, and slowly walked slowly to see the buildings of various countries. I went to Haitian and came to Qingdao more often because of Haitian’s service.

It’s not bad, but when there are children and accompanying parents everywhere in the hotel, their heads are blown up, and the temperature of the unventilated air conditioner is too high. It directly gave me heatstroke in the winter. I ran to the first floor at night and vomited. People who don’t know thought I spit up after eating seafood, but it was actually heat stroke! I almost went to the emergency depar**ent due to vomiting and diarrhea. The service staff was very good and took disinfection tissues to my husband. I vomited and vomited all night. I asked the doctor and my friend said I was suffering from heatstroke, not food poisoning. I was speechless and crowded at breakfast. I didn’t have breakfast, so I went out to eat and took two fried dough sticks to feed the seagulls at the trestle bridge. How can I say it’s not time to come. It’s possible. The service is five-star. The price of Xiamen hotels in winter is not good, but the airiness is too good. Too bad, so boring, I haven’t slept the whole time, it’s uncomfortable, the location is very convenient to go anywhere. Within walking distance of Badaguan, I go out to the seaside, but my plan to go to Laoshan is broken. I went to Qingdao and lost 6 catty

msg:It’s been a long time since I went to Qingdao. The sun was very warm on Saturday morning. I suddenly wanted to go to Qingdao to see the sea and eat seafood. So I searched Ctrip. After comparison, I chose the latest Haitian. Most of the others were renovated in 2014 and 2016. Moreover, the location of Haitian is unique, it is very convenient to drive in and out (parking is free, entry at the front desk), the sea is across the highway, and you can walk around the bay as much as you can. Arrived at the store before three o'clock, the butler Xiaoji checked in very warmly and thoughtfully, and then enjoyed the afternoon tea full of sea style, and then was wrapped in the warm sun, walked to the beach and waited quietly for the sunset. Everything was beautiful. The night view of the hotel is changing and beautiful, with a modern urban feel. The next day I enjoyed a delicious buffet in the hotel restaurant in 1988. It was very popular. I didn’t make a reservation and troubled the butler Xiaoji. I especially liked it. This trip to Qingdao feels very good. The side sea view is definitely not as good as the full sea view, but the price is right. Oh 😀, Haitian’s choice is right, I will come after thinking about it, see you next time😊

msg:Haitian is the earliest foreign-related four-star hotel in Qingdao. Many old Qingdao people have some Haitian plots. This time I brought my parents to experience Xin Haitian. Let me talk about it first.
        First, the hotel service is super good. The two beauties Winnie Li and Lisa Wang at the Guest Service Center are almost responsive in terms of service. Especially Winnie Li, I have met my troublesome room arrangement requirements and the requirements of taking care of the elderly. It has to be said that the service of Lao Haitian has been well inherited and continued. This is the biggest advantage of Haitian, and I hope to maintain it forever.
        Second, the landscape is invincible. It faces Taipingjiao with sea views, red tiles, green trees, blue seas and blue sky, and east faces the Olympic sailing base. Although the side seascape will be partially blocked by the tower next to it, it is still amazing enough. In the evening, you can see the light show of the tower next to the hotel in the room, which is close at hand;
        Third, the location of the hotel is good. From Donghai Road to the west are the old houses of Taipingjiao and Badaguan, and to the east are Music Square and May Fourth Square. Both are the core scenic spots of Qingdao. They are all within 15 minutes on foot. Donghai Road is the seaside. Downstairs is Haitian Mall, and to the northeast are Vientiane City and Zhanshan Food Street. It is convenient for shopping and eating.
        Let’s talk a little bit regretful,
        First, the bathtub in the room is a bit small, almost the smallest in the hotel I have ever stayed in. It is neither long nor wide enough. I am 170 and feel cramped when I lie down;
        Second, the breakfast is messy due to the large number of people. I hope to stick to the lead seat system instead of letting guests find their own seats;
        Third, I hope that there will be a special food for breakfast, even noodles, so that everyone can say yes to it. There are plenty of varieties for breakfast now, but none of them are very tasty.
        Fourth, the room brought two tickets to the Haitian Tourist Center. When checking in, two coupon codes were written on a blank postcard, saying that you can visit with this. It was only when I arrived at the scene that I had to change the ticket. The procedure for changing the ticket was particularly troublesome, and the speed was slower than buying a ticket. Now that we have engaged in this kind of activity, we hope that it will be more convenient for hotel guests, rather than causing trouble to guests.

If you want to try some market snacks, you just have to cross the road. If you want to enjoy the big snack in the hotel, there are many choices. The only unpleasant part is that we arrived at the hotel early at the time and the scheduled room types were not cleaned up. The front desk staff could suggest going to the executive lounge to kill time instead of telling me that we originally checked in at three o'clock. I'm on an early flight. I definitely want to take a break when I get to my destination instead of wandering around in winter. The art of talking, brother!

The price for 388 persons is high, but fortunately A lot of seafood is unlimited, so I also give it to 5⭐
After eating the buffet in the evening, I went to the Haitian No. 1 Craft Brewing Bar. I drank two drinks, the value is 🉑, the taste is 🉑
The accommodation facilities in the room are modern in style, the scenery outside the floor-to-ceiling windows is very beautiful, the facilities are all available, coffee machine, air machine, bathtub, nice
After getting up in the morning, I went for breakfast. I was worthy of the price. Everything tastes good. The key is to have a sea-view table. I got up in the morning and had a buffet breakfast facing the sea. I felt really good!
Finally, I would like to thank Fan Yuxuan, Executive Lounge Song Linjuan, Guo Jiamin, Liu Yuanyuan and Zhang Meihui for their hard work. When I was leaving, I was suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. I recovered my bed and felt more comfortable. 🤨

msg:😍I stayed at Haitian Hotel again after two months, the service is still as considerate as before👍
🔔The Recreation Center on the 7th floor is very good for hair cutting. The environment is great. It’s really enjoyable to watch the sea doing hair. The gym is equipped with all kinds of equipment, and there is a billiard hall next door. The swimming pool was not open when I visited last time. This time it is open from 7am to 22:00. It is divided into adult pool and children's pool. The height of the children's pool is 0.6 meters, which is very suitable for young friends who can't swim. The water quality is very clear and tasteless, the infinity pool, while enjoying the sea swimming, the environment is great.
🔔The room is clean and fresh, and the room service is in place and prompt. In the early morning, you can also order the in-room catering service. The warm meals are delivered to the room quickly, and the taste is pretty good~
🔔Breakfast buffet is in the sea view restaurant on the 2nd floor, 1988 all-day dining restaurant, a variety of Chinese and Western dishes are very comprehensive, there are many choices, the taste is even better, while eating a delicious breakfast slowly and enjoying the perfect sea view♥
🔔I especially like the little brothers Yu Jialiang and Wang Yifei who check in at the front desk. They are warm and courteous. Any problems can be solved in the first time, like them 👍👍
The children are all addicted to living and don’t want to come back again when the Chinese New Year is gone. When the time comes, live for a week and enjoy the addiction♥

The business trip in the past has been very familiar with the port city. Perhaps because I love to see the sea in the morning, the sun gushes out from the sea, and the blue waves are rippling. The sea was dyed with magnificent magnificence, and the sea was like a blushing smiling face, welcoming the rising sun, which made people have a beautiful daydream. Great living experience!

msg:2021.11.11 is the 6th anniversary of my husband and I getting the certificate. The baby will be 2 years old soon, and it is not convenient to travel during the epidemic, so I chose the Haitian Hotel to stay.
Service: Knowing that it is our anniversary, the hotel lobby manager Amanda Guo Liang specially upgraded the sea view room on the executive floor, and carefully arranged flowers, cakes and champagne. The ceremony was full. During the check-in period, Frank Fan Dongqi and Ashley Zhang Yahui patiently introduced and guided them, saving us a lot of time with the baby, and even helped us with the baby to play, so that we can quickly register the relevant check-in information, this service is too considerate. After returning to the room, there was a special champagne cake to congratulate me on the anniversary. I was so moved to tears. Thank you very much for the arrangement of the hotel. I give full marks to this kind of service, it can't be less!
Facilities: The hotel facilities are even less important. First of all, we can see the air purifier in operation after entering the room. We are more at ease with the baby. Our room has a 180-degree view of the sea (approximately). The big bathtub for watching the sea is the baby's favorite. The baby who takes a bath says wow, the sea; he kicks his calves happily, so happy. The hotel’s swimming pool is also really loved. There are intimate partitions of 1.2 meters and 0.6 meters. It is safe for babies to play in the 0.6 meter area.

msg:We stayed in Haitian Hotel for four nights. Xiaofan and Xiao Guo, the front desk at the check-in, welcomed us warmly and upgraded our high-rise rooms so that we could have a glimpse of Qingdao’s beautiful seaside scenery and beautiful scenery from the room. The characteristic old houses, especially Xiao Fan, personally delivered fresh fruit baskets and knives and forks, which was very heartwarming. Xiaofan deserves to be a well-trained five-star professional in a five-star hotel. Ask for answers, so that we can smoothly go to various scenic spots and enjoy the sights, especially the light show on Saturday night. We don’t want to I missed it. I hope to know exactly when the light show started. The old man is also quite verbose, but he took the trouble to help us check the information over and over again, patiently answering instead of perfunctory matters, which made us very touched!
The hotel's comfortable and tidy housing is indispensable for the hard work and considerate service of the staff in the guest room depar**ent. Epidemic prevention and health care products are delivered immediately after check-in. In addition to cleaning and tidying up and replacing the room items every day, it also replenishes enough mineral water. The Chinese and Western breakfast buffet is varied and delicious. The staff is attentive and diligent. You often see people squatting down at the feet of the table and bending over to wipe the floor. Are you still worried about the hotel’s hygiene? The location of the hotel is very advantageous. You can watch the sea and play, such as Badaguan and the Third Bathing Beach. It is not far from the coast of the hotel. It costs more than ten yuan to take a taxi from the Olympic Sailing Center, and then you can walk to May Fourth Square. . There is also the Old Street Trestle... It's not expensive to take a taxi, it's very convenient. In short, for this free tour in Qingdao, staying at the Haitian Hotel is really the right choice. I highly recommend your friends and relatives to stay in Qingdao.
If we have to pick some thorns, we are from the south and we are not used to the room heating and cannot adjust ourselves, and it feels a bit hot.

As soon as I entered the lobby, I felt high-end a**osphere, and then I met Ruby when I checked in. She was very kind and enthusiastic in receiving and caring about our needs during our stay, introducing tourist attractions, and giving us dinner in the administrative building! The guest room is designed with artistic sense, the bathtub is comfortable, and the sea view is beautiful. We have a very happy stay! Then at dinner, I met Diviki, the executive sous chef from Hungary, and he greeted us very kindly and chatted for a while. It turned out that he had been in France for a long time. When checking out, Franz's service was also very good. I really admire that Haitian is a new hotel and the staff training is so in place! Great 👍 👍 I still have to thank Ruby for his attentive service throughout the whole process, let us feel at home when we first arrive in Qingdao😘😘

In the morning on the beach at the door, there are a lot of small fishes and crabs, as well as sea anemones that retract when they touch them. Not far from May Fourth Square and Olympic Sailing Center, Lover Dam, taxi fares start.

It just feels that the water temperature is a bit cold.
The only bad thing is the service staff in the hotel lobby. No one came up from the garage elevator to greet and help with luggage. The staff is indifferent

msg:I stayed in Qingdao for two nights during the National Day. When I first arrived at the hotel, it seemed that the facilities were quite satisfactory, but I felt that it was difficult when I checked in. The young lady who was checking in on the side was getting angry at the front desk because I don’t know when. Check in. I also said at the front desk to wait, but did not say how long to wait. It was more than 2:40 when it arrived. In fact, it is rare to check in at 3 o'clock, usually more than 2 o'clock. It’s not difficult to think about the front desk. Anyway, there is an executive lounge, so I went up first. In fact, the child was very tired from flying over and had a nosebleed. I wanted to get a rest soon. The view of the executive lounge is good and the kids play. Didn't say anything about living. Later, after waiting for more than an hour, there was no response. If the children couldn't play, they could only take them to the beach to play. During the period, I asked the hotel to wait and waited for them to call. The child was soaked while playing at the beach and changed his clothes, so I communicated with Ctrip. Ctrip helped me contact the hotel or said to continue to wait. There were no other measures or statements. Ctrip's service is quite good. I keep calling to care about progress and difficulties, express apologies, and offer compensation plans. In fact, Ctrip itself has no problem. Finally, when it was almost 5 o'clock, Ctrip told me that I should be able to check in, but the hotel did not contact me. The hotel means that there are too many guests to clean and prepare the room, but I think these objective factors are something the hotel needs to consider. I arrived on the 4th. Didn’t I live in a few days before the National Day holiday? NS? And you can call one day in advance to communicate, telling you that you have to wait a long time for check-in, or you can make guests who don't want to wait consider checking out. I arranged the itinerary based on the smooth check-in at 3 o'clock, but in the end it was all disrupted, and how inconvenient it was to bring the baby with me? I was originally here for vacation, not for emergency drills!
After moving in, I found two problems in hygiene. One was that the quilt was very dirty, so what should I prepare for half a day. In addition, among the fruits sent, some of the dragon fruit was actually bad. My child and I ate it. Fortunately, I didn’t eat too much, and there was no major problem. It turned out that I just waited for a long time to endure this matter. Now I can't accept it, and I have to complain.
I also read reviews when I choose a hotel, so I'm still going to say objectively here. I should talk about complaints and talk about the good side. The overall facilities and environment of the hotel are okay. Different people have different opinions on the location and sea view. I ate two meals within walking distance and it was okay. The all-day dining restaurant on the 2nd floor is good, the breakfast quality is good, and the view of the restaurant, room and executive lounge is very good. I didn't take the baby to the pool because of the itinerary. I don't know how.
In general, the hardware strength is acceptable, and the services and software need to be strengthened. It is not bad, but there are still shortcomings. At least it did not make my holiday very comfortable and very irritating.

On the day of check-out, the front desk directly asked for a review on WeChat. I really can’t find a reason to give a review. The location of the hotel is very good.
In the evaluation, Dyson’s hair dryer is Philips’
When I checked in, the front desk did not ask whether to open or drive over, register the license plate number and the like, scan the parking fee of 100 when going out, I think the overall rate of the hotel should not be like this

Since I was a child, I heard that stars come to Qingdao for concerts to host Haitian, so I went to experience it on the first long vacation after the renovation. The location of the hotel is excellent. It is a wonderful experience to see the beautiful coastline and the Red House at the same time. The design of the rooms and public spaces is full of sense, and there are many surprises in the details. In terms of service, Mia Bian Mengxiao was very considerate and kind, and took the initiative to remind me of the weather. The staff in the recreation center are young, energetic, and very enthusiastic.
But there are also some areas for improvement: 1. The traffic at the door is too chaotic, there is no pedestrian passage, the area at the door is too narrow, there is no view, and the green advertising signs are too ugly; 2. Only clean the rooms once a day, the current five-star hotel There are many times a day, at least guests should come to tidy up every time they walk in, so that they feel clean and comfortable every time they walk in; 3. Afternoon tea in the executive lounge is too monotonous; 4. The doors of the toilet and shower room are not damped and very loud; 5. . Slippers, towels, bath towels, the texture is very poor, not worthy of the grade of a five-star hotel, pillows do not have many choices; 6. Breakfast is very average, no highlights.
I still love Haitian very much, and sincerely hope that Haitian will become the most attractive hotel in Qingdao.

The hotel opened for half a year after its refurbishment. Everything is new. The auxiliary facilities range from various restaurants to recreational salons, which can satisfy my discerning customers.

The room size and view are slightly inferior to the Executive Seaview Double Room, but the quality of the executive lounge staff is still as high as ever!
Special thanks to Mr. Wang Yifei, the front desk of the hotel, for his warm reception during check-in and caring during the five days in Qingdao, which really made us feel at home.

msg:The hotel has just opened, so it has adopted many intelligent systems, such as the automatic opening and closing of curtains in and out of the room, the fully intelligent toilet, which automatically opens the toilet lid, automatically flushes, and has functions such as heating and flushing. I was in time for my mother’s birthday when I checked in. I would like to thank the zora at the front desk and the reception at the executive lounge for preparing small cakes for my mother. I am very grateful to zora for helping me solve all kinds of questions. Because it was still in time for Mid-Autumn Festival, we also received Mid-Autumn Festival gifts and fruits on the first day of stay. I feel that I have been receiving gifts for two days after staying, and there are surprises every day. The breakfast is also very rich, and the ingredients are also very fresh. The breakfast room can watch the sea but it will be very dry by the window. In the afternoon and evening of the executive twin room, you can also enjoy free afternoon tea and light meals in the evening in the executive lounge. Next to the City Tourist Office, if you are over 70, you can see Qingdao on the 81st floor of the restaurant for free. It is very beautiful (the adult fee is 200). If you are bringing the elderly, you can let the elderly go up and have a look. Of course, the premise is the elderly. Not afraid of heights, the last picture was taken on the 81st floor. The only flaw in the hotel is that the room still smells of decoration, but the room is equipped with a purifier. I believe that the smell may gradually dissipate after a while. One of our two rooms has a big smell, and the other has no smell. Sensitive suggestion to smell after reading the room, it is impossible to change another room.

msg:During the Mid-Autumn Festival, staying at Haitian Hotel for four days and three nights was a great experience. As a landmark hotel in Qingdao and Shandong, the location is excellent. The hotel is located in the humanistic core area of Qingdao city, open to the sea, just a few minutes walk to the third bathing beach, sitting on the classic mountain and sea scenery. It is the superior skyline landmark of the city core, leading the new trend of the city. It is the number one luxury hot-selling hotel in Qingdao, with thousands of high praise and excellent reviews online. The lobby of the hotel is large and spacious, and the waterscape of the indoor fountain is peculiar and innovative. The rooms have a natural view, and the panoramic view of Qingdao's sea and mountain views. The rooms are well-equipped, with a small entrance hall, cloakroom, mini bar and so on. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, with high-end toiletries. Smart access control, smart curtains, smart electric control, smart toilets, etc., are easy to use. When the door is opened, the lights, TV, and curtains are also automatically turned on. Pull open the sanitary door and the toilet lid will open automatically. You can see the sea view when you lie down on the chaise longue. In the executive lounge on the 30th floor of the hotel, you can enjoy the magnificence of the sea and the sky and the invincible city view of red tiles and green trees. The service of the hotel is very good. Whether it is the doorman at the welcome door, the cuties at the front desk, the handsome and beautiful waiters in the executive lounge, the waiters in the breakfast restaurant on the 2nd floor, the Chinese restaurant on the 3rd floor, and the room cleaning staff, they all actively smile and have a strong sense of service and high quality of service. , The service is in place. I especially want to praise the front desk girl Guo Jiamin/Nora who checked in for me, because I booked 4 rooms and stayed 3 nights in each room. There are 8 elderly people in my family, and the oldest is 95 years old. Health code inspection and check-in procedures It is more troublesome and laborious to handle. Xiao Guo (Hora)'s tireless patience, careful and serious work attitude deeply touched me. After staying in, I sent a text message as a full-time housekeeper to inform me that I would like to help at any time. I am really warming my heart, and I would like to give a thumbs up to Guo Jiamin/Hora Meimei! At the Haitian Hotel, I really felt the "home away from home" courtesy. During the few days of staying in the hotel, I left a very beautiful impression and an unforgettable experience worth collecting. Next time you come to Qingdao, Haitian Hotel is still your first choice!

From the beginning of check-in, the super handsome little brother at the front desk gave people just the right sense of comfort. His name is Ge Lingkang. I would like to thank you very much. He made my first impression of this hotel particularly good. The room is large, facing the sea, very suitable for a family holiday. The suite has a bonus administrative courtesy.

🍃Environment: Harvesting the whole coastline, it is comfortable and pleasant, and the fragrance in the lobby of the hotel is very warm. The hotel is very new and well equipped.

🔔Service: When you arrive at the hotel, the front desk is very busy, and the staff is in an orderly manner, diverting guests to go through the formalities. The one who received us was Miss Alice Bu Yanan, who was neat and capable and expressed clearly. Although we arrived early, she gave us a room as quickly as possible, and coordinated the allocation of the room, and divided the two rooms we booked. Together, it embodies the superior service level. After completing the formalities, Miss Bu explained that all the problems we encountered during our stay can be solved through her help, and the hotel treats guests very carefully.
        During my stay in Qingdao, I booked two different five-star hotels. Through my staying experience, my family has a unique passion for the sea and the sky. The hardware facilities of hotels of the same level are similar, and some good feelings are better than the service quality of the staff and the management level of the hotel.

In addition, the breakfast room is very large, the sea view is also good, and there are still many choices for food. Going out is the third bathing place. We walked along the coast to the May Fourth Square, and the night scene was invincible. Very recommended. Will come again. Check in and check out are very convenient, and Abby at the front desk is also very nice! Full of praise.

msg:The front desk of the hotel has a good attitude, but it takes three o'clock in the afternoon to check in. We arrived at the store after one o'clock and waited for 80 minutes to enter the room. I originally booked the Haitian Double Room, which is said to be upgraded to a high-rise side sea view room. The sea view looks good, but the room layout is really bad. It is a crooked room with a huge pillar in the middle of the window, a few centimeters from the foot of the bed. It's wide, even narrower than slippers (see Figure 7), and you can't get through with your feet. To get to the other side of the bed, you must step over from above. I don't know what kind of genius to come up with such an anti-human design! The bathroom sink is cramped, almost comparable to Atour. The room smells of decoration, and the window cannot be opened. Although it is equipped with an air purifier, it is still obvious. I was thinking about staying for a few more days, so I checked out the next day and changed hotels.

The lady at the front desk, Zora, is very gentle and has a good face. Because she brought her family, she has many questions and she answered them one by one, super nice! It can also be seen that the management also treats and trains employees very carefully. After returning to the room, I saw a small gift carefully prepared for us. It was super beautiful. We all liked it so much. The family took it back with the card and collected it. The breakfast is also very good, the restaurant is super big, the kind that you can’t see at a glance, the scenery is also very good, Chinese food, western food, fruit, desserts, it is also very rich, but it is a pity that I only think of taking pictures after I am full, so I took a picture of the scenery outside the window. 😅. In short, the experience is really full, and I really recommend everyone to stay in Qingdao Haitian Hotel! 🥳🥳

🚗 Transportation: Very convenient, there is a shopping mall next to it, and it is also close to other shopping malls. The door is the seaside!

🧹Sanitation: very clean, the room has no smell

🍃Environment: The surrounding is very quiet, the hotel has everything. The afternoon tea at 2:30 in the administrative corridor on the 30th floor was very, very delicious. Not sweet at all, but very fragrant. There are many varieties of food and drink, and my brother will take the initiative to help make coffee. There are many types of breakfast, not many people, and the dining environment is also very good, you can choose your seat freely.

🔔Service: It is really worthy of the five-star service (the country includes Macau and Hong Kong, and I have stayed in five-star hotels abroad, given the evaluation) Kate and Esther have provided a good experience from the beginning of their stay, smiling throughout the whole process, and the room Let us go to the 30th floor to rest and wait before we are ready, and then we can get the room card directly on the 30th floor (this one is really well designed and reflects administrative trea**ent). The little sisters in and out of the administrative corridor all smiled and greeted. Esther also waived our mini, and gave small gifts and handwritten cards. It was really serious and gave the guests a good experience. Let me upgrade the whole Qingdao, it is really very comfortable. We have a lot of luggage. When checking in and checking out, the concierge is very proactive to help with luggage carts. When checking out, the little concierge brother Anthony (please correct me if there is a mistake, I don’t remember clearly 😂) has been waiting next to him. I packed my luggage and I went to get the takeaway. He kept waiting for me to open the door and put it in the car before leaving. Really feel the five-star service! !

I highly recommend everyone to stay!
I only hope that the price will not rise too fast 🤣Be sure to take the family to experience it next time. Hope to do better and better! Keep it level😊

🔔Service: The small details are not as good as the St. Regis next to it, but in terms of cost performance, it is very good!
There is no bathtub in the ordinary double bed room. This point was not reminded when I checked in. This is a deduction! The breakfast options are plentiful but the quality is average. All in all, the price is very good. But if the overall quality requirements are high, we still have to consider the St. Regis next to it. The differences are all small details, but I can still feel it if I live in more hotels.

msg:The introduction is newly opened this year, just next to St. Regis, a bit far from the subway station. Crossing the road is the seaside, and a subway station from May Fourth Square is relatively convenient.

The service is super good, and it is very good from getting off the bus, and I am very proactive to help. During the epidemic, professionally check the health code, measure the temperature, and send them directly to the front desk for check-in. The front desk service Kathy Kong was kind, professional, and user-friendly, and many questions were explained clearly in advance. It’s getting dark by the time of arrival, and the front desk will help upgrade to the highest level, and the view is better. Very good, booked for three nights. The whole process was smooth and pleasant. The worst place I've lived in in recent years is the Hyatt Regency, Wujiaochang, Shanghai. It is so impressed that I can't forget it. It turns out that Hyatt can also be so outrageous. There are no pits other than this.

I felt that the air conditioner was not cold on the first night, and it could even be said to be getting hotter and hotter. The next day, I contacted the room service after shopping.

In room dining, Hainanese chicken rice is not tasty, but the service is good, the chicken is of poor quality, and the taste is average, the sauce is ok, there is soup and it tastes good, but there is not a single vegetable. You can finish it when you are hungry.

The biggest shortcoming is the cleaning and tidying of the guest rooms. There are still flaws in hygiene. Turndown service and daily tidying can pick out many problems, but they are not particularly serious problems. There are holes in the sheets and the bathtub can wipe out dust, so I only soaked my feet on the most tiring night. The garbage was not cleaned up the next day, and used spoons were not taken away for renewal, etc. However, supplementation of drinking water is timely and sufficient. There is a problem with the design of the shower room. The water is not fast enough and the ash overflows to the sink.

I like the decoration style. Although the room is not big, the location of the hotel is convenient. Overall it is worth recommending.

Finally, the location of the hotel is by the sea, between May Fourth Square and Badaguan. It is not far from any scenic spot. If you can, you must live in a sea-view room. The scenery is really good. The summary is a pleasant trip to Qingdao.

msg:I originally planned to stay for one day, but because the hotel environment is good, the service is good, and the good-looking brothers and sisters are in good mood every day, the babies like it very much, and they don’t want to go, so I stayed for four days in a row. ～😝😝

The hotel also gave a small gift, a beautiful pearl bracelet

If you can, you must live in an executive room. The service of the executive lounge is really good. There is no need to apply for the room card on the 30th floor. There is no need to wait at the front desk on the first floor.

There are some desserts and soft drinks for afternoon tea. The taste is not bad, and the baby likes to eat a lot.

The hotel’s breakfast is also good, but it’s relatively scattered, and it’s quite strenuous to walk around. The catch is that there is not much difference every day, there are not many differences. It’s a bit enough to eat for four days, but the taste is good 😁

Upgraded to a deluxe sea-view suite, the room has a wide view, and the service staff are also very considerate. The waiter Xiaolin took us to the room and introduced the room along the way. Guo Ailun happened to live in the other day.

msg:My family of 5 stayed at Qingdao Haitian Hotel from 8.5-8.7. At 23:30 in the evening on 8.4, my husband and I came to the hotel first, and met a very sunny boy at the front desk, Seven, and I told him that we are going from Haiyi Sailing Hotel tomorrow. I moved here for two days. I want to check the room type of the side sea room first. He was very polite and enthusiastic and asked their staff to arrange for me and took me to see 2 sets. After returning to the front desk, he was enthusiastic again. He arranged for me in advance the room I will move into tomorrow, so that I can move in with peace of mind tomorrow. Next, let me talk about my feelings after moving in: This is a brand new hotel opened in 2021. It is impeccable in terms of hardware and software. The view of the side sea room is also beautiful, the sea has a panoramic view, and the breakfast is quite good. Abundant and everything, you can enjoy the beautiful sea view while eating breakfast, it's perfect! On the last day of 8.7, when we checked out, Miss Ji Mingzheng at the front desk helped us to check out smoothly. Before leaving, she also gave us 2 sets of epidemic protection suits, so that we can take preventive measures in the epidemic room. I really thought very thoughtful and very considerate. Qingdao is a very beautiful city, I will definitely come again, the Haitian Hotel is my first choice next time, it is great!

msg:The hotel as a whole is very good... I saw a lot of bad reviews before, and I was a little worried, so I only booked for one day. After I arrived at the hotel, I saw the hotel facilities and breakfast standards and decisively booked for another three days...
Although the hotel is not an international chain brand, the decoration standard is really high, from soft decoration to hard decoration is almost perfect! We booked the executive deluxe sea view. The view is amazing! I opened the curtains every day and I was in a good mood...
The breakfast standard of the hotel is also very high. From the presentation to the dishes, it is exquisite without losing the taste... I have stayed in the hotel. The breakfast level is very high...
The front desk service is also very good. The receptionist was Alice. The service was very good...because we arrived at the hotel earlier and the room was not ready, we didn't wait for lunch at the hotel... When we came back in the afternoon, the luggage was delivered to the room, and the floor was also pressed We intend to move to a higher floor...
The only dissatisfaction is that the quality of the waiters in the executive lounge is relatively poor, and a few people gather around and laugh and the service attitude is particularly bad, and the service standards are not good! Hope to strengthen the training!

The hotel’s service is also great, especially Alice Bu Yanan, the little girl at the front desk who entertained us. I was injured on the beach. She also greeted my injury and cared about it once a day. A day was delayed because of the typhoon. Alice was also very enthusiastic. We provide follow-up renewal transfer
My husband and I both said that we would choose Haitian when we come to Qingdao again, and the afternoon tea and snacks in the lounge are also very good 😍

msg:In 1988, the hotel was blasted and rebuilt into today’s Haitian Hotel. The hotel is located next to May Fourth Square. Underground parking is free and travel is very convenient. It consists of three buildings. The tallest one is the highest panoramic internet celebrity check-in site in Qingdao. The hotel has 31 floors. The administrative standard room is set higher, and afternoon tea and evening light meals are also served. All meals are served on the 30th floor. . Breakfast is in the 1988 all-day dining restaurant on the second floor. You can enjoy the invincible sea view. The breakfast is very rich and suitable for children, business and couples. If you want to see the panoramic view, you can consider the suites on each floor if you are not short of money. The 360-degree sea view is invincible. Thank you Ren Xiaolu for taking care of us throughout our stay. Haitian’s service is especially attentive and attentive. If you come to live, you will feel the value for money! I have already recommended it to my friends, I hope the hotel can get better and better.

When we went, it happened to be my husband’s birthday. The hotel also furnished our room. We were pleasantly surprised when we entered the room and delivered cakes. The sea view outside was beautiful, but the floor-to-ceiling windows were a bit dirty. Chinese style, the sea view of the restaurant is superb! The lighting at night is also beautiful, a great experience!

The Ben people in the hotel are very friendly. Seeing that I have brought two children and an old man, let us move in early. The room is a sea-view room on the 28th floor. The room facilities are very complete and new. The room is also big. Welcome fruits are also delivered. The hotel is also well located. It is very close to May Fourth Square. In the evening, I walked to May Fourth Square to watch the light show. The center is also close and very convenient. The service attitude of the hotel staff is very good. The hotel’s capsule coffee machine is very good, which meets my needs for coffee ☕️. Next time I go to Qingdao, I will choose Haitian.

The double bed room is 1.35 meters per bed, so you can sleep a big one without stress. The main entrance of the hotel is across the road and the sea is very convenient. Thanks to Miss Kate for helping us choose a room on the 30th floor. Although it has a side sea view, the view is still good. The room rate was originally only two breakfasts, and we also gave us a children's breakfast for free! 👍The drinks in the small refrigerator in the room are all free. There is a fruit plate every day, too many, we have not finished eating and drinking... The most pleasant surprise is that Haitian also has a turn-down service. I came back to the room at night and felt very warm. Oh, yes, the facilities in the rooms are very modern. The curtains will automatically rise when the door is opened, and the toilet lid will automatically open when the toilet door is opened. The toilet automatically flushes after the toilet. Children like it and find it very interesting. The executive lounge has afternoon tea every afternoon, all kinds of dried fruits, drinks, small snacks, and light meals in the evening. Very humane. Afterwards, Qingdao preferred Haitian! I hope the swimming pool will open soon, so it will be perfect!

msg:I have chosen the Haitian Hotel. The only downside after check-in is that the newly decorated taste is still a bit big, but the facilities and environment are really good, and the location is also good. It is better to go to Taipingjiao, Badaguan, and Wheat Island. Convenient, a taxi arrived within 20 yuan, and there is a bus stop downstairs. You can take the bus directly to Zhongshan Park, Luxun Park, Wusheng Road, etc. The hotel is a smart toilet. The shower gel and shampoo provided taste good, but it is not Hermès (only available in suites), the kettle is from Delong, the air purifier is from Philips, and there is a small refrigerator. The tea provided is Nescafe coffee machine and twg tea, which is also very good. A small suggestion: anyone can go to the elevator floor. For safety reasons, it should be set to only the floor where you live. This point can be improved later.

All the staff in this hotel, including the room service delivery staff on the 23rd floor, are very enthusiastic and responsible. When you come to the hotel, you must book an executive room.

msg:The hotel hardware facilities are very new and intelligent, but the soft services are still not in place. It is estimated that the service training and awareness of the newly opened hotel cannot keep up. For example, when I checked into the hotel on the first day, there was no staff to guide which way and which elevator to go. When I got out of the elevator, an uncle was cleaning and mopping the floor. He saw the guests coming out and sending mops to the guests' feet. He only saw his own work and no one. I asked the guest room center for a child’s dental kit. After waiting for half an hour, the child fell asleep. The executive big bed room, the executive lounge afternoon tea is the same as the vegetable market, there is no service staff to guide the arrangement of seats, and no one to send coffee to wait for basic services. Anyway, it just feels such a good hotel, it's a pity that the service can't keep up.

msg:This hotel has an excellent location. Although it is a few hundred meters away from Line 3, there is No. 317 downstairs. You can go to Shilaoren, go to the polar region, go to May Fourth, go to Badaguan, and go to No. 317. Of course, out of the hotel entrance is the third bathing beach, the most recent one to play in the water.
We stayed in the hotel's executive sea-view twin room, which included 2 breakfasts. Abby, the little girl at the front desk, saw me taking my children and gave me two more breakfasts for the children. Stay for 5 nights and get it every day!
The executive room can go up to the 30th floor to enjoy the hotel's afternoon tea and dinner, including wine and champagne. Basically, as long as the hotel swimming pool is in place, you don't need to leave the hotel after you check in.
The buffet breakfast on the second floor is very rich, or breakfast with sea views. The children like foreign chefs very much and go to say hello every day.
The Chinese restaurant on the 3rd floor is actually reasonably priced, and there is no service charge.
The 5th floor is the Japanese food and bar, which seems to be open at night.
The gym on the 7th floor is a must, so you should have enough consumption every day.
The light meals on the 30th floor are simple but delicious.
The Mini bar of the room was booked through Ctrip, and all are given away. Make up one set every day, even if you drink it.
When I checked out, I was a little rushed. The children went to a Chinese restaurant to eat. The concierge Owen helped me carry my luggage all the way, and finally put me in a taxi very enthusiastically.
As long as the swimming pool is open, this hotel is a perfect 360-degree hotel.

I drove out to the north, and only allowed me to enter the underground parking lot after I was staying in the hotel. Couldn't I move in without driving a luxury car?

He was also very considerate if we had any questions during our stay. ! The sea view from the room is absolutely beautiful! However, there was a small episode during our stay that the air conditioner in the room we stayed in was broken. The room attendant said that we would find someone to see the result. No one came or the duty manager we found ourselves changed the suite for us. The result was satisfactory, but the process was correct. Unsatisfactory! The hotel is generally good.

msg:As a refurbished old hotel in Qingdao, Haitian, which has just opened, has relatively high-end hardware facilities. I booked a suite this time. Let me give you a brief comment from all aspects.
Check-in: Miss Kate Liu at the front desk received her. She was very gentle and kind, because she also booked a big bed room and wanted to arrange it on the same floor. She also arranged it with great care and upgraded it. It was very caring. There is still a bit of smell when you enter the room. The suite is equipped with a sample of Hermes toiletries, two bathrooms, and the bathroom in the middle has floor heating.
Turndown service: I sent a nice smelling spray, but I don’t know why the light on and off in the whole room is flashing in the middle of the night, and it’s been the same for the three days of staying. For the light sleeper, I’m here. It was very unfriendly. Although Kate later said that he wanted to change my room, but because of the trouble of dragging the house, I had to give it up. To be honest, the bed and the bedding in the guest room are not too comfortable, and the bed will have a bit of noise when it turns over, especially after staying in the sea view garden. The contrast is even stronger. Sleeping quality is very important as a 5-star hotel.
Breakfast: The variety is complete, and it is still very good. I can't get used to the waste of some tables. However, when the flow of people is high, there is occasional negligence in guiding the guests in place, and one of the three days is not taken by anyone.
Executive Lounge: The view is very good, there are not many dining options, and there are not many people. I like a quiet place. After a day of dinner, we will have one table. Although simple, the taste is OK. The cakes for afternoon tea are changed every day~the taste is good~
In detail, Haitian’s pool design is relatively reasonable I have seen. There is no trash can in the living room of the suite, which is speechless. Sometimes the turndown service collects garbage, sometimes not, so I feel that the service needs to be standardized. Hope Next time you come to Qingdao, you can see a better Haitian, not because of its geographic location, but also because of its quality of service.

The Badaguan Scenic Area and Taipingjiao Park around the hotel can be reached by walking, and the scenery is beautiful. In addition, special thanks to Mr. Sui Zhuang at the front desk for his thoughtful and meticulous service.

msg:This is the worst so called "five star" hotel I have ever stayed in! none of them! I booked an executive sea view room with no sea view! All you can see is the city view! Please be responsible to the guests and ask the hotel to change the name of the room to a city view room! Don't mislead consumers! The sink drain in the room is blocked! Washing your face and brushing your teeth are all done in the bathtub! He is also a Jue Juezi! The water in the shower room was cold, so I had to take a bath in the bathtub outside for three days! The elder and the child almost slipped! Let’s complain about breakfast again! Based on the five-star standard and most of the breakfast reviews were pretty good, I booked this hotel. To be honest, the breakfast was very poor! There are a lot of varieties, but none of them are on a higher level. The breakfast in a three-star or four-star hotel is better than yours! In the morning there was only bread, noodles, porridge, and some intestines, and there was nothing else to eat! As a seaside city, I can forgive you even if there is a shrimp in your breakfast! After three days of eating, it seemed that most of the guests were still relying on bread to fill their stomachs! The location of the hotel is actually very bad. There is no subway station, so it is awkward to go anywhere. You can only take a taxi! A very low value for money hotel! Not recommended! I think the standard of four stars is pretty much the same! Really bad review, bad review, bad review! ! ! !

msg:Qingdao is really a very comfortable city for a walk-and-go trip. As a seafood fanatic, seafood is very good for a few days. Speaking of the hotel, the location is actually not very close to the subway station. It is recommended to take a taxi. Qingdao is very cost-effective. The third bath is relatively small. If you want to see the sea but don't want to make dumplings, you can choose this location. I looked at the weather forecast and it was sunny, but the sky was not beautiful. Thank you Xiao Sui at the front desk for upgrading us to a sea-view double room on the 26th floor. Although all we saw were foggy, the room was very comfortable and the details and facilities were very complete. Capsules Coffee, English black tea bags, and mini-refrigerator drinks are chargeable. For heavy coffee lovers, the capsule coffee is delicious, so the aunt in the guest room can make up for it, and it was delivered in time. It should be Hermès that only the executive suite washes, and the executive courtesy are given. However, Agri verbena is also easy to use. The hotel has been renovated, so many facilities have not been opened yet, which is a pity 😔, this time itinerary is relatively tight, next time I bring my family and come here for vacation.

msg:I haven't been to Qingdao for a long time. I checked on Trip.com and saw that Qingdao Haitian Hotel was rebuilt and opened, and I immediately booked it. The hotel is very good in the location, crossing the road is the beach. The hotel has complete facilities, the room is very clean, and the sanitation is also my favorite Kohler brand. The staff wear masks but they can feel the service with a smile. Set a three-day administrative sea view room, but the first day the room view was blocked. After communicating with the manager of Yang Kang at the front desk, I learned that I came to see the sea deliberately. The next day, I arranged a room change and upgraded. The manager of Xiao Yang also enthusiastically introduced the relevant attractions for me. And said that if you need to contact him at any time during your stay, thank you very much! The service staff of the executive lounge are very friendly, especially Liu Wei, take the initiative to introduce the relevant information of the lounge, the service awareness is very strong. Because of the serious and proactive attitude of manager Xiao Yang and Liu Xie, I had a very enjoyable holiday! Loved the sea, I will come back to Qingdao! With these dedicated service staff, I would recommend the hotel to friends and will take friends to the hotel again for vacation. The Haitian Hotel has a brilliant 30-year history, from these staffs' dedication to let me see that the Haitian Hotel will have a more brilliant tomorrow!

msg:Haitian Hotel treats guests differently! Due to a business trip, I booked a sea-view double room at Haitian Hotel for one night. It was already 2 am when I arrived at the hotel from other places. There was nothing wrong with it. The hotel’s hygiene and rooms are relatively satisfactory. The next day, I called the front desk and asked if the check-out time could be delayed until 2 pm. The front desk staff who answered the phone told me that I must check out before 12 o'clock, and it cannot be delayed. The answer was very positive and resolute... …So I hurriedly checked out at 11:30, left my luggage at the front desk, and went out to do errands. It is not the peak tourist season. Originally, the hotel also had a late check-out policy, but I was turned down and I didn’t. What to say, as a result, I went out to work in the afternoon and met two other guests who also lived in the Haitian Hotel. When they talked about this topic, they told me that they would check out at 2 in the afternoon, which made me more a**osphere. Now, the hotel actually treats guests differently? Did I not pay for the room or what? I also happened to receive a return call from the hotel customer service. I talked about the matter. The customer service told me that they would give feedback to the leader and reply to me. As a result, I went back to the hotel to pick up my luggage at 6:30 in the evening, and I didn’t receive the so-called so-called I replied to the phone and talked about this to the hotel, but I didn’t get any response. The staff were all understatement, and they were simply drunk. If there are other options, I hope you still don’t choose Haitian Hotel. It’s really not worth it. ! It’s fine if you don’t get the respect you deserve, and treat guests differently, it’s speechless😓

First of all, some people in the hotel followed the guests up the elevator and posted illegal small advertisements, which was very insecure.
Second, a five-star hotel can't turn on the air conditioner! In addition, the windows of the hotel cannot be opened, which makes the room especially stuffy! I didn't have a good rest all night, and I called the front desk three times and it didn't solve the problem! People in the engineering depar**ent can only open the door and cool off for a while. . . This method of solving the problem is really unacceptable.

In short, it was a very bad experience!

The front desk said that it was done in 20 minutes and added WeChat, but I didn't reply. I ran to the front desk and gave me the room card after a bad meal. Staying in their hotel will let me understand a truth. When you encounter a foolish front desk, you will scold ****************.
The service is the most rubbish among the five-stars I've ever stayed in. The final apology is just that the drinks in the room are free.
When it comes to breakfast, don’t listen to flicker. Go to the 20th floor to eat. There’s nothing to eat at all, and it’s basically cold.
The side sea view is very pitted with a big pillar blocking it

The direction of the TV was facing the wall, and the air conditioner was facing the bed. The room has no windows or air purifiers, and the fresh air system is useless. When I went to bed at night, I turned off the air conditioner and the decoration of the room made me unable to sleep. When the air conditioner was turned on, the wind kept blowing my head. I basically didn't sleep all night. I got swollen in the morning, which seriously affected the work schedule of the next day! It's not that I don't change rooms, but because of work arrangements, it was almost 23:00 when I checked in, and I really didn't have the energy to go downstairs to toss. Some other details are too weak to complain.

I don't know if I can give it to me before three o'clock in the afternoon. Do not wipe the sanitary countertops. The coast downstairs is full of Enteromorpha, which is too far away from the five-star standard deviation.

msg:The hotel itself scored 5 points and the food and beverages scored 0 points, so the final score was 2.5 (not allowed for detailed items). Let's talk about the 5 points first, the hotel has a good performance from the beginning of check-in, and it is very service-conscious. In addition to the slightly smaller area, the other parts of the room are also very good (except that the pressure is not stable in the rain, and it is cold and hot). Let's talk about the 0 points, the breakfast is rich in variety, but the ingredients are very common and the taste is rough. We can understand the operating pressure of the hotel's full room, but the noodle stalls are all cooked in advance, and the guests just blanch them after ordering. The noodles and chaos are completely overcooked. As a northern hotel restaurant, it is ridiculous. The service is also inexperienced, and there are so many customers who can’t find seats.... Let's talk about the Haitian Banquet Chinese Restaurant, Shandong cuisine is not Lu cuisine Cantonese cuisine is not Cantonese cuisine, it feels like a workshop with no master chef at all. The ingredients are not particular about the ingredients. The grilled sea cucumber on the place is fresh sea cucumber, which has no taste except for a hint of fishy smell. The four of us finished the four dishes and cancelled the other four dishes and changed to another restaurant to continue dinner...After the meal, almost every dish is a dark dish, which is the most memorable moment of this trip to Qingdao . A benchmark hotel with a history, it is also operated by a local local team, so why is it so?

Finally overcome the obstacles and take a shower. I want to put a floor towel on the bathtub. The floor towel on the bathtub is completely wet (check at 6 o’clock in the afternoon). in The hotel should have enough time to clean it) After wiping half of your hand, I don't know if it is clean water. My whole person is ill. I wanted to change the suite the next day and ran away. I got home and wanted to vomit and it was so dirty.

msg:首先，感謝銷售小邵，安排了不錯的視野房間，海灘和城市景觀都有了👍
酒店規模設施較新，因為是老酒店因此服務也很到位，服務生都是笑臉相迎，這點比後幾天入住的某M 酒店好太多！
酒店距離沙灘很近，過馬路就到了，適合經常到沙灘🏖️曬太陽，晚上還可以去沙灘聽歌或者高歌一曲。晚上燈光秀，酒店也是景觀之一。
酒店早餐還可以，品類蠻多的，就是咖啡一般可能我要求比較高。
地理位置不錯，去大部分景點網約車10塊以內可達。值得入住！

msg:如果我再去青島，我的首選一定會是海天大酒店。這次入住海天的時光和感受真的是太捧了，無比美妙和享受。來青島前是聽人説海天好，住過以後才知海天真的好，超出我的預期。
如果讓説出海天好的理由，我會説:海天酒店的位置好，就在海邊，到哪都方便；二是海天的管理好，精心管理井井有條，注重細節；三是海天的服務好。細緻入微的關心，發至內心的笑容，讓我們感到特別温馨和舒服。前台的主管小劉特別熱情專業，真誠温暖的服務就如春風拂面，滿足我們要求，解決我們困難，讓我們感動。門口迎賓魏愷，康樂中心小劉，二樓餐廳那位高個管理員，入住期間碰到的每個海天人都是親切自然，熱情有加，笑容可人。住上這樣的酒店真是太滿意和幸福了。我們曾住過幾十個五星酒店，海天是第一個讓我們有了來了不想走，走了會惦念還想再來的酒店。
感謝海天，下次我們一定會再去青島，就衝著海天也會再青島。因為青島不僅“紅瓦綠樹，碧海藍天”，還有讓人難以忘記的海天酒店。

這次給我們升級入住了行政房，房間和床品都非常整潔，客房服務也能儘快送達，酒店周邊交通也很便利，在房間都能看到大海，入住體驗超棒！

酒店位置很好，處於市南區核心地段，能看到海，離鹽水浴場、帆船中心都很近
設施很也很新，符合超豪華酒店標準，房間乾淨，空氣清新無異味。酒店自帶的幾個餐廳基本都體驗了，很少踩雷，一樓的甜品bar特別不錯，價格很合理。總之是超滿意的一次旅行！

1，管家Julie小朱全程服務，有任何需求都快速滿足，房間不滿意還快速換房了一次
2，每天都有房間打掃，都是在外出的時間，幾乎沒有任何打擾，有位姓臧的阿姨，打掃的真的很認真，態度也超級好
3，奔着海景和泳池訂的房，超值，5天幾乎就是上午游泳，下午出門挖沙，孩子根本不想走，出門就是第三海水浴場，超級方便
4，早餐很棒，很意外的是定的行政側海景，包含了下午茶和晚餐，後面兩天幾乎一天三頓都在酒店解決了，物超所值

真的是超級超級滿意的一次出行，酒店真的超級滿意，帶小朋友太合適了，點贊！！

1.淋浴池那裡的枱子太小了 如果能做成雙層或者拉長一點尺寸 可能會更方便一些 
2.沙發旁的這個桌子上的雜物太多了 我覺得一個座機 一個枱燈即可 插線板可以找地方收起來 至於點餐的可以直接掃二維碼點[偷笑]桌子上的東西快佔了一半空間了[破涕為笑]
以上是我對於此次住宿的建議

msg:第一次去青島看完熱門的五星酒店，各有缺點還在猶豫之際看到了海天時覺得位置不錯，新開沒多久，看顧客發的實拍圖感覺還行，對酒店要求一向比較高，看到這家硬件不錯價格很友好，抱着試試看的心態定了，沒想到大大超出預期，首先硬件在國內住過的五星及其他高奢酒店絕對屬於偏高的水平，床品舒服乾淨，備品也用的很好。特別意外的是從進酒店開始的服務讓我震驚了，工作人員真誠的微笑，專業的一系列服務，尤其是一個叫Crystal Zhao的小姑娘從入住開始服務特別熱情，加了微信給我們推薦了一些好吃的好玩的地方，都太好吃了，每樣都不踩雷，得知特殊時期便安排給端來紅糖生薑水，差點感動哭了，還給送了水果，記住了這個熱情可愛工作充滿激情的小美女，給個大大的好評，希望以後也能把山東人民的這種好客之道傳遞給其他客人。以後再來青島一定還會選擇這裏，也會推薦給身邊的朋友們！美麗的青島，超預期的海天期待下次再見！

2辦理入住的人沒有很多，但是效率非常一般。
3房間比較新，整體氛圍感也不錯。但是面積不大，空間利用率差。沙發與床的距離太近。
4我的房間與對面相對，開着燈都不敢光着。這是側海景大床房
5早餐景色是ok的。但是人多的像趕集，沒有什麼特別驚喜的部分，我要的咖啡也沒送，有人推薦肉包子還不錯。
6還好吧，由於沒有住過，過來嘗試一下，大概率後續不會過來，沒有特別的地方。
7有個小朋友簡單表揚一下，您好譚先生，我是給您辦入住的Evan小尹，以下為酒店訊息您查收一下。

酒店設施完善，比較新。浴室和用品品質很好，自動加熱馬桶，稍有異味。早餐種類豐富，環境很好，正對着海灘，餛燉和豆腐腦不錯。

入住時加了echo微信，期間一直貼心服務，給予攻略和建議，反饋的問題也及時解決。退房時Lisa也提供了幫助。

總體説下次來青島可以再次選擇。

青島的服務太捲了我衹能説
入住兩晚
從check in到check out，服務體驗到硬件設施全部超出我的預期。
前台的Ike全程貼心服務，基本需求根本不需要我開口就幫你安排好，比如房型免費升級到行政房，比如每天早起給我貼心預告天氣、當地旅遊攻略、late check out。作為曾經的酒店從業者，我衹能説，可能唯有當年的Portman Ritz-Carlton可以一較高下。

服務：從第一天來，前台小姐姐Lisa王接待就很用心，幫我們拿行李並會關注我們住房體驗，有什麼問題都隨時幫我們解答，本來我們是要換酒店的，畢竟來旅遊的，想體驗下不一樣的酒店氛圍，因為各方面都很不錯，決定直接續住不再折騰，哈哈哈

msg:海天絕對是在我最近的一次酒店入住體驗中，最滿意的。首先，酒店的地理位置和周圍環境都非常好，交通便利，海天也是青島海岸線最突出的地標性建築，並且出行十分方便打車起步價幾乎可以到市南任何景點。房間的舒適度和衞生狀況也令人滿意，服務經理Crystal小趙的熱情和樂於助人的態度也讓家人感到賓至如歸。
酒店的設施設計也很人性化，網絡信號高速且穩定，窗外風景更是美不勝收。特別值得一提的是，酒店的早餐豐富多樣以及全日餐廳的午餐，能夠滿足不同客人的口味需求。此外，房間內的小擺件設計也很有特色，為整個住宿體驗增添了一份趣味。
總的來説，這次雖然是過站青島，也給了我和家人很温馨的感受，如果有機會期待再次入住。

客服Julie一直在關心我的身體狀況，前期還幫我升級了房型,雖然有點可惜沒有睡幾個小時就轉去住院了。julie十分貼心，給我準備了多的洗漱用品，口罩，拖鞋～真的超級貼心超感人

msg:第一次住海天，體驗真的很好！一直覺得有景觀的酒店都大差不差，但海天還真的很驚艷的！首先可能因為住房有空，Echo幫我做了房間升級，而且每天房間內還有水果🍌真的很好！
保潔阿姨也很盡責，補水清理垃圾，還幫我把睡衣疊好🤭🤭🤭
酒總體來説酒店設施 服務都💯！早餐也棒棒的！
之後再來青島會直接預訂海天吧
再提名點贊一次，Steven and Echo💯！
