msg:As a loyal diamond customer of Ctrip, this is my first time on Ctrip and I have to give this hotel a full 1 point for its service.
When checking out, the front desk said that there was a room charge of 20 yuan, but I made it clear that I did not spend it. I asked the front desk to notify the guest room to verify it. The front desk said that it would be treated as if there was no charge. The next day, the hotel deposit was refunded but the room consumption was deducted. I called the front desk and told them that I would spend it in the breakfast restaurant, but I ordered a buffet breakfast that included breakfast. The front desk didn't believe it. He said he would call me back, but he still hasn't.
If 20 yuan fell on the ground, to be honest, I wouldn't bend down to pick it up. But the hotel's irresponsible attitude can't even solve small problems. What if it encounters a big problem? How to ensure the rights of hotel guests?
I have spent my time writing so much, I hope you all can avoid lightning, avoid lightning, avoid lightning!

msg:A very ** hotel. First of all, the day before check-in, a so-called hotel housekeeper called and said that there was a free afternoon tea in the room and asked me if I wanted it. I said yes. When I arrived at the hotel, I asked the front desk and they said yes. They took me to the lobby bar and packed a snack for afternoon tea and took it back to the room. After checking out, they said that the deposit would be refunded one day later. The next day, 225 yuan was inexplicably deducted from the deposit. I asked the customer service and it was the cost of afternoon tea. I want to scold you. If you want to charge, you should take out my signature. If you don’t have a signature, you will directly deduct 225 yuan. You are a fraud. If you are short of money, you can tell me. You don’t need to use this to trick me. Secondly, the water from the bathtub faucet of the hotel, which has only been open for 2 years, actually has these black things in the picture. I didn’t dare to use the faucet in the shower room when I wanted to take a bath. I have no interest in taking a bath. Another thing is the layout of the hotel room, which can only be described as depressing and uncomfortable. The room height is very low, and the rectangular room is very narrow. Only one person can pass from the bed to the TV against the wall. Compared with Marriott in other cities, it is not a little worse. I doubt whether this Marriott Hotel in Jintan is a fake. In addition, the room manager apologized seriously and sent red wine and fruit after knowing that there was an unknown black object in the bathtub. This should be praised. I will definitely not stay at Jintan Marriott next time, and I will definitely not recommend it to my friends. It's so disappointing. I have been traveling for 20 years, and this is the first time I have been defrauded of my deposit by a hotel. I am convinced.

msg:I didn’t want to type this at first, but unfortunately the front desk didn’t ask about my check-in experience when I checked out, so I can only talk about it on the platform.
1. Can you consider changing the position where you put your slippers when you enter the room? Because every time you bend down to get the slippers, you will be hit on the head by the clothes hanger above.
2. The clothesline in the shower room is probably just a decoration and I can’t reach it at 162cm tall.
3. The bathroom has so much space. The large dressing table is empty. Even the small dressing mirror is not placed, but it is installed next to the sink.
4. There were only two bottles of water in the room. I called the switchboard at around 00:19 in the evening to ask for water. Unfortunately, no one answered the phone three times, so I had to sleep.
5. When I woke up in the morning, I called the switchboard to ask for water. By the way, I asked her if there was no one at the switchboard at night. She asked me what time the call was, and I said it was around 12 o'clock. She said that someone would answer the call at that time! I said okay, that’s because no one answered my call, and I didn’t even apologize. I said it so righteously. Please check the recording as soon as possible. This is the first time I’ve encountered such a terrible switchboard attitude.
6. I went swimming at noon. When I arrived at the front desk at the swimming pool, the little girl frowned and handed me a piece of paper to register. After I filled in my room number and name and was about to sign, she said, "Okay, okay!" ? ? Didn't you ask me to fill it out? Then he gave me the key to the locker and ended with a arrogant look on his face. He didn't tell me how to get to the locker room. Finally, I asked and looked impatient. If he didn't want to work, he didn't want to work. He didn't know if there was surveillance there so he could see her. expression
7. Here comes the most outrageous thing! There is no lifeguard in the swimming pool! ! ! I was really shocked! A family of four kept taking pictures in the swimming pool, but no one cared about the fact that there were no towels on the pool loungers, and the pool was not equipped with any water (not to mention the water and towels in the locker room, I was talking about the swimming pool). The most outrageous thing is: A piece of glass in the pool ceiling is broken! ! ! Oh my God, your swimming pool is really just a decoration! It really just provides a pool for guests! No consideration for the safety of guests at all!
8. The sticky *****s holding the hair dryer are all off! Isn't this a hotel that just opened last year? !
9. There was no welcome fruit on the day of check-in. I called the switchboard to ask and was told that you need to be a Marriott Platinum member or above to receive fruit... Does a large group like Marriott treat guests differently according to their levels? ! I can understand that because of the difference in levels, the fruits are different, but if you are not a member, there will be no fruits. This is a bit unreasonable (maybe it’s just that I don’t understand because I don’t live in Marriott very often). Fortunately, a manager called me back on the day and made arrangements promptly. Got fruit and breakfast thanks a lot to him

To sum up, I will not come again. I advise everyone to stay away from lightning. Atour is next door and the price/performance ratio is relatively high.

As for hygiene, the room was very clean, but there were hairs left on the bed, and the bathroom floor was slippery enough to skate. It seemed that the previous batch of guests knocked over things like shower gel and did not clean them up, causing the floor to be very slippery. I almost fell.
The room service speed was still OK, and water and other items were delivered quickly.
Overall, it was OK, but this Marriott, the actual situation obviously did not match the price.

There was a smell in the room. I woke up in the middle of the night with a dry and sore throat. The sound insulation is not good. You can hear people passing by in the corridor or opening and closing the door clearly. The service is very good. Because I have two daughters, I first asked the front desk to send two pairs of slippers. At ten o'clock, I found that there were not enough toothbrushes, so I asked for another pair. It was all timely and took no more than 5 minutes.

msg:I originally came to Jintan to experience the newly opened Shanghai-Nanjing High-speed Railway along the Yangtze River, so I must choose a relatively comfortable hotel for accommodation. This hotel is relatively close to the high-speed rail station and has direct buses. It's also very convenient to go to the city center.
It's just that the weather is not good today. I originally wanted to go to Qianzidang for a walk, but I had to give up. But the comfort of the check-in experience is quite good.
The hygiene of the room is quite good. As soon as you enter the room, you feel very clean. The floor-to-ceiling windows are transparent, the electronic alarm clock comes with wireless charging, and the various key switches are clearly visible.
As a hotel run and managed by a foreign professional hotel team, there are many details that are very thoughtful. Compared with the experience of staying in a hotel when traveling in Europe, and this hotel experience in Jintan, it is still noticeable. It is because of the careful thinking of the hotel management that they try their best to make the guest experience consistent without losing Changzhou characteristics. I especially like the Changzhou dun-sand noodles and tofu curd in the breakfast restaurant~

msg:Checked in on March 15, 2024. When I first entered the room, it was very stuffy and the temperature was 25 degrees. After calling the front desk, the engineering staff came to check and explained that the air conditioner in the room was turned on for natural ventilation. After communicating with the hotel engineering staff, they agreed to turn on the air conditioner. The cold wind blew, and then we washed up and went to bed. At around 4 o'clock in the morning, the 2-year-old baby was tossing and turning on the bed and couldn't fall asleep. We adults were also woken up by the temperature of the room. Later, we persisted until 5:40 or so. When we used the room phone to call the front desk to ask about the air conditioner temperature, no one answered all the contact buttons on the phone, including the emergency call button, and the phone was always busy. After pressing the button several times, it still happened, so my husband went downstairs to the front desk to find a staff member (it was already past six in the morning). The hotel front desk staff was still sleepy-eyed and said they had not heard the call from our room. After some negotiation, the front desk arranged for the night shift engineering staff who were previously on duty to come to the room to check the air conditioning problem. The engineering staff admitted that the refrigerant temperature had been increased, making the heat exchange efficiency of the room lower. 1-The room phone is in a blind tone when using the guest room call or emergency call in the early morning; 2-Because the room is fully enclosed, the hot and cold exchange in the room is unreasonable, causing the room to be stuffy. These situations can lead to accidental injuries to guests without help. We didn't get any attention or explanation from the hotel until we checked out.

msg:The main area of ​​the room is in the bathroom, and the bedroom area is relatively small, so the cost performance is not high. On the day, I saw on Gaode and Baidu Maps that this hotel only cost more than 700 yuan including breakfast, and more than 600 yuan without breakfast. Since I couldn't get a refund, I negotiated with the front desk to send a breakfast for my child, just to make up for the price difference. In the future, I still recommend that you look at several platforms for more cost performance.
I ordered a cup of coffee in the room, which cost 25 yuan. The hotel service staff delivered the meal to the room and told me that it was delivered to the room, so I couldn't enjoy the discount and could only pay 38 yuan.
I checked out at noon, the room had been checked, and the deposit of 500 paid by WeChat has not been returned to the original way so far. I was a little disappointed overall.

msg:失望…未入住小朋友堅持的東方鹽湖城內部酒店的原因就是僅信任萬豪品牌代表的品質…
理解疫情期間開業的不易以及其它不可控因素帶來的限制，寫此評論的目的衹是指出問題，不等於否定與其它大部分酒店相比的不可替代性，並期待可能的改進甚至祝願熬過這個歷史難關！
以下部分問題點不分時間先後，且不等於無其它問題，
- 攜程登記為2大1小且雙床，進門卻衹有1雙拖鞋，無小童潔具（後額外索取）
- 所有國際電視頻道不可看
- 游泳池和健身房不可用
- mini吧沒啤酒
- 淋浴使用時牆體內的水管會產生極大噪音，睡覺整晚還有上下鄰居水管的噪音，猜測管路走向設計存在嚴重問題
- 裝修細節粗糙，比如，淋浴房牆磚空鼓即將掉落
- 空調過熱後很悶，無法開窗通風，製冷模式無效果，衹能關閉空調等待很長時間降温
