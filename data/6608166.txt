The room service also took about 25 minutes longer as expected & the “fresh” pineapple juice was definitely NOT fresh! - it was from a bottle & not as in the description. The watermelon juice was fresh & OK. The breakfast selection was also very limited this time - I ate something outside after this breakfast…

msg:Before staying at Four Seasons Tianjin, I had very low expectations, mainly because the Four Seasons in China have never been up to the standard that Four Seasons should be. We have stayed at almost all Four Seasons except those in the United States and Canada. The Four Seasons abroad are indeed absolutely top-notch, the top luxury hotel at the top of the pyramid. The Four Seasons in Guangzhou and Beijing in China are very average, and the two in Shanghai have withdrawn. Even the Four Seasons has fallen to the same level as Hilton. But I didn't expect that the Tianjin one gave me a surprise. First of all, the service. When I had breakfast, Han Yiming from Four Seasons was Ms. Elodie received us. Miss Han made us experience the long-lost service level of Four Seasons abroad. Her style of conversation, her memory and attention to our personal preferences and names, and her ability to touch the teapot with her own hands to decide whether to add hot water made us feel that Four Seasons was back. Thank you Miss Han. In addition, I like the suite room of Four Seasons Tianjin very much. I feel that it is the best hardware of Four Seasons in China. The room has golden walls, milky white doors and partitions and washbasins, rich deep yellow cabinets and window arches. The combination is very high-end and temperament, giving people a sense of spaciousness and brightness. The room is large enough, exuding a unique luxury and style of Four Seasons. I will stay there next time.

The overall style of the hotel is modern and gorgeous, and the facilities are well maintained. This time, I originally booked a premium suite, and after arriving at the hotel, I paid the difference to upgrade to the Four Seasons suite. The room is very large and magnificent. Thanks to Xiao Du at the front desk for his enthusiastic introduction and careful service. As Tianjin's top luxury brand, Four Seasons has impeccable services in all aspects, from concierge to front desk, from executive lounge to room service, which makes people feel at home. The breakfast is very rich, and the view and atmosphere of the open terrace bar in the evening are very good. The hotel gym equipment is also relatively complete, and the view of the swimming pool is excellent, but there are many children who come to learn swimming on weekends, which slightly affects the swimming experience of the guests.

1. Although there were some problems with check-in, the front desk still handled it patiently and respected and adopted the opinions of the guests 

2. They also called one day in advance to ask about some needs 

3. My friend was not feeling well, and the hotel also provided assistance in check-out and other aspects. I really appreciate the thoughtful service of the hotel service staff here.

The breakfast buffet is also good. However, the desserts are too sweet. I choked after taking a bite. I arrived at the hotel at around 10 pm. The housekeeping service is average, and the front desk is good. After leaving Tianjin Station, I felt a series of unenthusiastic and cold trea**ent. The driver chased you to chat all the way, which caused me to miss the Haihe River cruise and refund the ticket. I found a noodle restaurant in the middle of the night, but the boss said that he would not work after get off work today before closing time. I went to another restaurant. There was construction in front of the door, and the road surface was cut open and it was all dusty and rumbling. The door of the restaurant was wide open, and the boss had a very bad attitude. . . . I will never visit this city again in my life.
Fortunately, there is a familiar hotel.
All the bad moods
were finally soothed by the familiar environment and service in the hotel.
My whole two-day trip to Tianjin was not such a bad memory.

I checked out at 1:30 pm the next day, and was given a lovely hotel surrounding.
Thanks to all the hotel staff~Everyone is very warm and thoughtful.
However, I returned to Beijing at night, and after I got home,
I found that my arm was bitten by unknown insects. 5 lumps. It was very painful, not mosquito bites, half of my arm was swollen. I was too tired, so I applied some oin**ent and went to sleep.
The hotel is a bit damp, and the place where I stayed the longest was the bed and the sofa. It is recommended to deworm.

It takes a long time to move in and out. The Chinese breakfast is probably extensive (at least a lot of things for them), for Europeans the breakfast is very meager, you won’t leave hungry, but for a hotel of this level of this chain, more was expected. People pack bags of food with them, fruits and yoghurts and even eggs. Apparently this is how it is done there. Because of them there weren’t enough mangoes)) everything was in their bags. The tea, as in many Chinese cities, comes from a vat (just some kind of swill), but it doesn’t look much like tea. For the second time I will choose another hotel. Cleaning is good.

The hotel's sky garden environment is quite good, but it's a pity that it was too windy to sit for a long time. If the weather is good, it should be quite pleasant to see the night view.
The hotel swimming pool is very good, there are not many people swimming, and the water temperature is suitable~

The air conditioning is used in the guest rooms and the floor heating in the bathroom is turned on, probably considering that the guests may catch a cold after bathing. The location is good, at one end of the pedestrian street, and the other end is the Haihe River, where you can see the night view. There are churches and porcelain houses around the hotel. The underground garage is a bit winding, and the hotel elevator hall is hidden behind the parking space. You have to get off the car to confirm that you can enter before you dare to park. It is a bit tiring to enter the lobby from the outside. You have to find a small escalator, otherwise you have to climb a big slope. What I am not satisfied with is that the socket in the bathroom is broken, the hair dryer cannot be used, and you have to take it indoors to use it. The coffee machine switch is not easy to find. There are also breakfasts. There are few varieties of Western food, and the Chinese Tianjin snacks are not freshly fried, and they are cold and hard. As an international luxury brand hotel, I can't give it full marks.

Service: The service is average. My wife left her charger in the hotel. No one contacted us after checking out. I was surprised. In addition, the service can be more enthusiastic.

msg:The room is very good, at the level of Four Seasons Hotel. I won't say much about the compliments. I believe the hotel has heard a lot. Here are some suggestions.

The charging sockets on the left and right sides of the bed in my room are all broken. One is completely out of power and the other has poor contact. I can only charge it at the desk at night. People nowadays can't live without mobile phones, especially before going to bed. I still hope to strengthen the inspection and make sure it is repaired and maintained regularly.

The room is well organized and the concierge service is also in place.

msg:Among all the high-end hotels in Tianjin, the Four Seasons Hotel is the best in terms of all indicators. The hotel environment is excellent, and the view outside the window, especially the night view, is even more charming. The location is excellent, and it is very convenient to visit the surrounding scenic spots. As the "youngest" hotel in Tianjin luxury hotels, the facilities are definitely the most advanced and complete. The food is delicious and has the local flavor of Tianjin. In addition, the service quality is beyond words. I am very grateful to Ms. Sun Qiuyang Susan for her enthusiastic service at the front desk, which made our journey full of joy. I am also grateful to Ms. Vivian Du for her attentive service, which made us feel relaxed and comfortable at the end of the journey. In short, the service of the Four Seasons Hotel is really good, which can make you feel at home. After a day of playing, I was very tired and returned to the hotel directly to relax and feel very happy. When you come to Tianjin, you must choose the Four Seasons Hotel

msg:My husband's birthday was on the weekend, so my husband and I returned from Beijing to Tianjin for a staycation to celebrate his birthday. We stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel. We had basically stayed at Shangri-La or Ritz before, so this time we thought about trying the Four Seasons. Although the reviews were mixed, we still wanted to give the Four Seasons a chance, but we didn't expect that the impression was really bad.
First of all, due to the busy work, we didn't arrive at the hotel until 9 pm on Friday. However, Ms. Sun Qiuyang at the front desk didn't even raise her eyes when the guests came to check in, nor did she say hello. Even the handsome concierge had already put my luggage at the counter, and I had been standing in front of her for more than ten seconds without looking up at me to greet her. She kept waiting for me to open my mouth and say check in first, and then continued to say "give me your ID card" without raising her eyes. The tone was flat and the voice was low, and she didn't raise her eyes throughout the whole process. When I noted in advance that it was for my husband's birthday, she said "Happy birthday, ma'am". This attitude made us, who were already very tired, feel very uncomfortable. Although we don't pursue "respected gentlemen and ladies" like Ritz, at least basic courtesy and greetings should be achieved, right? When I came back on Saturday night, I found that she was also at work, but she was chatting and laughing with another girl behind the counter. Although there were no guests checking in, seeing the working attitude of the hotel staff did make me wonder whether I had entered the Four Seasons or an unknown one-star guesthouse.

After I got the check-in card, she continued to say without raising her eyes that the elevator was on the left hand side, but there were two elevator halls in the lobby, one for the guest room elevator and the other for the restaurant elevator. No one came out from behind the reception to guide the guests to the direct elevator to the guest room. We could only try to find it ourselves. Later, a boy at the front desk came out to guide us to the guest room elevator and expressed his apologies.

In terms of hygiene, I habitually wipe the table to check the hygiene of any room above five stars. I think it is the basic operation of the hotel to wipe the room clean and dust-free for the guests who need to stay that day, so I wiped the desk and my hands were full of dust, substantial dust.

There were birthday cards, very "small" birthday cakes and welcome fruits in the room, but the room was opposite the linen room, so the privacy was a little worse.

During the entire stay, the only person who made me feel the level of human care that the Four Seasons Hotel staff should have was Ms. Sarah Sun Xijuan who served us at breakfast. I would like to thank her and praise her very much! I only give her 1.5 points for service! Although her right hand was injured, she still insisted on working efficiently and warmly. Seeing that the meal was about to close, she helped us to serve a large plate of fruit so that we would not miss it. The next day, when we entered the restaurant, she immediately recognized us and greeted us with a very warm and enthusiastic smile. I hope that my evaluation and praise can be seen by the hotel management. The problems I encountered may also be encountered by everyone. I can only say that I hope the management will take care of themselves. If they can truly implement the problems reflected by everyone, Tianjin may be better.

msg:Four Seasons Hotel Tianjin: A great choice for weekend trips

As a Marriott Ambassador member, I have finally had enough of Marriott hotels, especially in Tianjin Marriott hotels.
By chance, I spent an unforgettable weekend at the Four Seasons Hotel Tianjin, which made me admire this luxury hotel with admiration! The service here is impeccable and exceeded my expectations! From the moment I stepped into the hotel lobby, I was impressed by their professionalism and enthusiasm.

Let me talk about the service first. The hotel service staff are absolutely professional among the professionals. They are not only kind to people, but also extremely serious and responsible in their work. Every detail was taken care of and made me feel truly at home. I remember one time, I asked about the special restaurants near the hotel. The lady at the front desk, Manager Qi Yuanke, enthusiastically showed me the way, booked a seat for me, gave me welcome fruit, and took the initiative to introduce the hotel facilities to me. It felt very thoughtful.
Next, let’s talk about the experience of traveling alone. As a solo traveler, I have high requirements for the safety and comfort of my accommodation. And here I was not disappointed at all. The hotel room was spacious, bright and equipped with all facilities, which made me feel very comfortable. Moreover, the hotel's location is also excellent. It is the Tianjin Begonia Flower Festival, so you can easily enjoy the beautiful scenery of the city.
Overall, I am very satisfied with my stay at Four Seasons Hotel Tianjin. Their professional service and considerate care made me feel like home.
If you are planning a trip to Tianjin, you can guarantee that you will have the same feeling as me if you stay here!

Except for some old buildings below, it feels a bit like Dubai. At first, I saw a lot of comments complaining about the hotel's breakfast. , I was actually a little worried, but after one day of food and accommodation, I decisively decided to extend my stay for another day. The hotel’s breakfast played an important role. To be honest, the fact that the breakfast has unlimited smoked salmon is one of the few. It deserves a five-star rating. Bar! In addition, the transportation of the hotel is very convenient. It is within 1.3 kilometers from various scenic spots. You don’t need to drive to get there. The hotel service is also warm and in place. Overall, I am very satisfied. I will choose to stay at the Four Seasons Hotel next time I go to Tianjin.

The swimming pool is divided into a normal temperature pool and a hot spring pool. The maximum depth of the normal temperature pool is 1.3 meters. The hot spring pool has a massage function, which is especially suitable for the elderly and children to play. The only drawback is that there is a construction site next to the hotel, and construction at the construction site sometimes lasts until around 12 o'clock at night. However, the hotel overall is very good, and I will choose here again next time I come.

The welcome fruit was given after repeated requests, but it was not as good as the welcome fruit from the All Seasons Hotel. It's so hot in the room that it's too hot to sleep naked. I wanted to order food, so I told the front desk that they asked me to double check whether there was an iPad in the room to order food from. I was told repeatedly that there was no iPad available for ordering food, and they asked me to go back to the room and call again. Do you not believe me? Finally, I was given a printed menu. Is it because of environmental protection? The children's toiletries were delivered after asking for them a second time. I don't know if they didn't understand or if they did it on purpose. The quality of the Chinese restaurant was disappointing, with salty dishes and mediocre service. After feedback, the service improved. The doorman is enthusiastic and proactive, and check-in at the front desk is simple and fast. Pool kids like it

The children kept receiving desserts, dolls, and small gifts, which made the children who were in the period of self-awareness feel very Good (narcissism is satisfied). The breakfast variety is not particularly large, but the quality is good; the room service is very good, our room was a little cold, and an electric heater was provided. We go to the swimming pool a lot, so we were given two more bathrobes. The swimming pool of the Four Seasons has long been famous and is indeed very good. The dry bath towels were replenished in a timely manner and the sanitary conditions were also very good. The staff were also very patient. We wanted to get a floating board for our children, and the handsome lifeguard patiently helped us go to the warehouse to get it.
Generally speaking, every service staff is smiling, which makes people feel very comfortable. If the weather is bad, it is fun to play in the hotel, and it is also very friendly to families with children.

There are TVs in both areas of the room, so adults and children can watch their favorite programs at the same time without disturbing each other.
For dinner, we chose Jinyun Chinese Restaurant on the seventh floor of the hotel. It mainly offers Cantonese cuisine and is one of the only black pearls in Tianjin. It suits my and my family’s tastes very well.
After dinner, my father took the two babies to swim on the eighth floor. The swimming pool has a shallow water area and a deep water area. It is clean and bright, and the children had a lot of fun.
The staff at various positions in the hotel provided very good service and responded to our requests in a timely manner. The experience is very good. I will choose Four Seasons next time I come to Tianjin.
The only thing that I hope to improve is the light and curtain control buttons in the room. The labels are not very clear and the curtain buttons are not sensitive.

msg:The worst hotel I have stayed in in so many years, it made me re-recognize the Four Seasons Hotel. I called very early to say that I would check in at two o'clock, and also said that it would be ready in advance. When we arrived at 2:40, the front desk service was indifferent and said it hadn't been packed yet and it would take about 40 minutes, indicating that we were in a hurry to get out and wanted to put our luggage in the room first. When I got to the room, I found that there were construction sites on both sides. I deliberately chose an expensive room with a view, but it turned out that there were construction sites on all sides. We contacted the front desk and they changed our room to the cheapest and most common double room. What's the price difference? There was no explanation. Finally, I contacted the manager again and was transferred back to another room with a view of the large construction site. It’s so cold at night that electric heaters are needed, and it’s still very cold in a five-star hotel with electric heaters on. They claimed to give welcome fruits, but the fruits were all rotten. I will never choose Four Seasons Hotel again in the future, it will ruin my own brand.

msg:This is the first time I review a local hotel. I don’t want to talk about the shortcomings, only the advantages.
High cost performance, 1000+ views of the four seasons, online scenery
The location is good. It is in the center of Tianjin city center. It is very friendly for foreign tourists to visit the Five Avenues. It is convenient to go anywhere in the city.
The service staff in the executive lounge are of high standard, the buffet dinner dishes are online, there is nothing unpalatable, and the environment is warm and comfortable
The breakfast bread, coffee and local specialties on the 9th floor are highly recommended. There are pancakes, fruit, crispy rice dishes, tofu puffs, and rolls. The taste is above average. The experience for foreign tourists is enough. My suggestion is to put one next to the crispy rice dishes and tofu puffs. There is a warning sign, what kind of ingredients are recommended to be added, and the temperature of the marinade should be higher.

msg:Before checking in, I read online reviews and found that Tianjin Four Seasons was tepid, and the photos didn’t show off its quality. However, the actual experience was that the product was strong and cost-effective. Let’s talk about three advantages first: First, the room is large in size and reasonably laid out. The 48-square-meter guest room is very spacious, not as small as it looks in the photo, and the floor height is very high, which is particularly pleasing to the eye. The bathroom with two-way doors adds a sense of transparency and spatial hierarchy to the guest room. There are two rows of display cabinets with exhibits inside. Not even the basic rooms of luxury hotels have such decorations. Second, the materials used are solid, the details are exquisite, the supplies are high-end and easy to use, and they are completely worthy of the Four Seasons brand. The real thing is much better than the photo. Third, the decoration style draws on the best of others, allowing you to experience multiple styles in one stay. Let me talk about three shortcomings: First, the noise on the lower floors is loud. The environmental sound insulation is not good, and the sound insulation in the corridor is not good either. Second, the carpet was dirty and had large stains. Third, the hotel lobby is slightly low-grade and does not fully meet the positioning of a luxury brand.

msg:I have heard about the name of Four Seasons for a long time, but I have never been able to come due to lack of time. I happened to have nothing to do this weekend, so I came to Four Seasons and started a three-day vacation trip. Let's talk about the facilities first. The facilities are very complete and clean. Although there are few aging and missing items, they are innocuous. To my surprise, the room was equipped with a Bluetooth speaker, iPad, and even a coffee machine. The bed is very soft. I slept quite comfortably here for a few days. The bathtub is very comfortable. It is the kind of deep soaking bathtub where the whole person is immersed in the water. Not to mention how comfortable it is.
The other facilities of the hotel are very complete, including sky gardens, multiple restaurants, bars, etc. Due to time constraints, I couldn't go all of them. Among them, the Sky Garden is worth mentioning. It is like a dream and is very pleasant. It is recommended to go there at night, have a glass of wine, watch the lights of thousands of houses and the busy traffic, and feel that time has slowed down.
Secondly, let’s talk about the service. The waiter was very smart (used in a complimentary sense). I went out to have dinner with friends in the evening and came back late. As soon as I walked in, I was very surprised. They had already laid out everything, as if they were waiting for me to come back. They were very gentle and considerate. .
Let’s talk about food. The Chinese restaurant is the famous Black Pearl Restaurant, and the food is not disappointing. The Cantonese refreshments are very authentic and delicious. Tea is a very interesting part, there is a dedicated person making it right now, and the tea sets are also very particular. There is also a Western restaurant on the 9th floor. The food is very delicious and rich, and the service is also very good. There is a bartender in the sky garden, and his skills are quite good. (This time it should be someone from Shanghai or Jiangnan)
Finally, let’s talk about the location. It is very advantageous. It is adjacent to Isetan and there are many delicious food around. (Thanks to the introduction by a friend who knows about food, I was able to make better use of the surrounding food resources this time.) The night view here is also very moving (outside the window) (The construction site has some failures), especially when you look at it while taking a bath, it is very emotional and feels like a pure land standing in the middle of the busy city.
Generally speaking, if given the opportunity, I would choose Four Seasons because time in Four Seasons is like a dream. Very comfortable and comfortable, so the price/performance ratio is very high. It is indeed a popular high-end hotel (there was no room when I arrived on the first day😂)
Finally, I wish Four Seasons Hotel a prosperous business.

Positive reviews:
1. The swimming pool is great, the facilities are new and the service is very good. I remind everyone to bring your own swimming cap. The on-site price of 50/piece is still not cheap; the children's swimsuits are soft and comfortable;
2. The breakfast room is great, with a large ceiling space. Although the food in the north is not as refined as in the south, the service is still fully in line with the Four Seasons standards.
3. The front desk and doorman services are very warm-hearted and detailed. They help with luggage and call a taxi. They are indeed in place. Full marks.
4. The geographical location is excellent. Chifeng Road is full of small shops and buildings all the way, and then there is Joy City and some business districts on one side. It meets all the needs of taking a city walk with children, eating and playing.
5. The bedding is very good. The child doesn’t want to move as soon as he lies down. Sure enough, enjoyment is innate, hahaha
6. The price-performance ratio is extremely high. The Four Seasons Hotel in Hangzhou is the most expensive hotel, costing 4,500+ in the off-season. The Four Seasons in Tianjin is considered a skyline hotel in the city, but the price-performance ratio is indeed much higher, and the experience is perfect 💯

msg:When I checked in at the front desk, I was lucky enough to meet a smiling and enthusiastic young lady, but I didn't remember her name. To be honest, the praises in the reviews were all fake. It is rare for a five-star hotel to encounter a lively and enthusiastic front desk. This is my first good impression of this hotel.
The overall facilities and environment of the hotel are not bad. The disadvantage is that the surrounding roads are small and traffic jams are very heavy. The hotel lobby is on the second floor, which is also a very strange design. You have to go out of the door and go down the escalator to go out. The talented designer should have his own reasons, or the concept that all guests are picked up and dropped off by car.
This time I chose a suite and came with afternoon tea in the executive lounge. As a result, something unpleasant happened. Although the staff apologized and tried to make up for it afterwards, I still have to mention that the afternoon tea in the executive lounge except for the cookies on the counter. , minimalist style fruits, nothing included, they said they would give us a set of afternoon tea snacks, but then they didn’t tell us that they were freshly made, so we were asked to wait for at least 30 minutes. After urging, we still waited, and later we couldn’t wait and went back to the room. . This operation makes people feel that it is better not to send afternoon tea. It is easier for us to just have a cup of coffee and leave. As for the standard of executive lounge, please learn from Shangri-La. Since it is a gift, give it generously. In the name of freshly made, isn't it just to reduce costs?
The only thing I have to complain about in the room is the curtains. I would like to ask the room manager, if your curtains are made like this and let two lights through, will you accept it? Either scold the designer or refuse to pay for the curtains.
Five-star hotels are expensive, so they should provide corresponding software and hardware. I still gave it five stars for this experience, but I still feel it's lacking. I hope you can improve it and don't let future guests down.

msg:Facilities: Average. The buttons in the room are not very easy to use. You need to press a few more times.
Hygiene: Hygiene is not a big problem and is pretty good.
Environment: There is a certain difference between the ceiling in Tianjin and the four seasons in Beijing and Shanghai. Tianjin’s CBD is also very convenient to go out.
Service: The service attitude is very good. The bar on the 9th floor is very good at handling the most annoying things in the most polite language. Bringing a baby is basically like traveling all over our motherland. From Intercontinental to Banyan Tree, from Wanda to Hilton, no bar refuses children entry during holidays. I understand that Four Seasons refuses entry to children. After all, we must respect hotel regulations and laws and regulations. After my wife and children returned to the guest room, I was on the 9th floor preparing to have a drink. During this period, another person from Beijing came with his children, but he was rejected and they left. But the next time I brought the children, I was warmly received by 3 adults and 2 children happily sat down to watch the show and play... I asked the waiter and the waiter said that he reported it to the manager. After the manager came, he enthusiastically poured water for them. Hospitality...the warmth experienced is so rare.
       When I first arrived, there were no children. After a while, the manager warmly entertained me and showed me a video.

First of all, when I checked in, not only did I upgrade the room, but because of the large number of us, the hotel also provided an extra bed for free, which invisibly saved us at least 400 yuan. Secondly, the room is huge, with a good view, all the amenities are of high quality, and the bed is very comfortable. Again, the hotel also has Peter Rabbit-themed activities. There are very few people. One of our children has two people playing with us. This trea**ent is really amazing! In the end, as long as I carry my luggage, the waiter will take the initiative to help me, even if it is the distance from the door to the door. I will earn more money when I go home, and I will only live in Four Seasons in the future.

The check-in at the front desk was very fast. After entering the room, the service staff quickly moved the children's bed so that we could take a nap. The swimming pool on the eighth floor is spacious and bright. You can see the skyline of Tianjin from the floor-to-ceiling windows. It is a rare swimming pool with beautiful scenery. When we went swimming in the morning, there were very few people, and sometimes there were only three of us in our family. It was really fun!

msg:To be honest, Xiao Du, the girl at the front desk, communicated by phone to arrange the room from the beginning, and informed the details via WeChat. Welcome fruits were arranged in advance for the room. Her manager, Ms. Qi, was very professional and thorough in solving check-in problems. The Chinese restaurant, breakfast room, executive lounge, and doorman service are all very good. I sincerely feel that this is the standard of Four Seasons. I am also surprised that the rating is not high. It wasn’t until I encountered two similar but different things in the store depar**ent that I realized why there were so many criticisms in the comments, and that the gap between good and bad could be so huge.
Since I booked three rooms at that time, I wanted to see the direction of the room. After arriving at the hotel, I explained the reason and canceled one room. The round-faced girl who checked in had a straight face the whole time and asked me what do you want to see? Just cancel one room and I'll cancel it for you. I said no, I can just cancel on Ctrip. I want to keep the connecting room. After opening the suite and signing the purchase upgrade agreement, the problem came. I heard the girl call and said that the room was not right, so she canceled it. Turn around and tell me, please contact Ctrip and place a new order. You canceled the room and now there is no more order for you. I said that's not right. What I canceled was the one I didn't need. The suite and the connecting room I needed were reserved. This was also shown on my order. And it was you who canceled that room, not me. Don’t you know which room is connected to the suite? At this time, Ms. Qi had just finished her work and other guests came over to ask about the situation. The little round face still said that I canceled the room and there was no order and it couldn't be opened. Ms. Qi comforted me not to worry and said it didn't matter. I'll handle it. It's your room. It has been opened and reserved a long time ago. Don't worry, it will be done immediately. We will solve the order problem. The fact is that I quickly got the room card and went to the room I had reserved. Ms. Qi's professionalism and service awareness are indeed commendable. I just regarded the check-in issue as a minor incident and didn't pay much attention to it.
However, when checking out, the weird things and comments happened again. The girl with the round face was on duty again that day, so I didn't look for her. I changed to a girl with short hair. I made a pre-authorization of 6,000 when I checked in. After 5 minutes of leaving the store, I only got a refund of more than 1,500. I paid in-store purchases and upgrade fees. After some calculations, I found that I should return more than 4,000. By this time, more than 10 minutes had passed since the whole thing. I called the front desk and asked them if they had canceled the pre-authorization and the charges were wrong. Should they pay separately? The other party told me that they deducted my room fee again and found that I had paid the room fee through Ctrip. I was asked to leave the card number and bank details and wait for the finance depar**ent to return to me within 7 working days. I said first, if I don’t call you, aren’t you going to take the initiative to tell me that I made the wrong deduction? They said we were trying to think of a way, but it turned out there was nothing we could do since it had already been deducted. I said that the second Spring Festival financial break will be ➕7 working days, which means that the refund will be refunded in half a month at the earliest. The answer is yes, we can only urge the finance depar**ent to handle it as soon as possible. I said I can't go far now, so if I go back now, I can't remember the details of the bank where I opened the account. I can just refund me cash or transfer it to me via WeChat. The reply is, no, we have to go through the financial process. You can first tell us an account bank and we will try it. If you cannot transfer, contact us again. (Well, it seems that it will be my problem if I can't change it by then.) I remembered that the same problem occurred at the front desk when I checked in. At this time, I was really a little unhappy, so I said, there was a problem when I checked in, and now it's again. If something goes wrong, why should your customers be responsible for your mistakes? Let me know, we will give you a free upgrade next time you stay. I said I did not accept this processing and the half-month refund time. Please authorize Ctrip, and I will check out the room directly. The Ctrip processing process is ignored here, because it is not that smooth and there is still a gap in housing prices. It took several calls from Ctrip to the hotel to sort it out. The emphasis here is on the words of the front desk. When I said that the cost still didn’t match, the front desk said that you had also discovered it. To be honest, if the price difference is replenished to you on another order, it would be equivalent to a refund in two installments. I saw that the refund could be reached, so I said one more thing. I said that your same depar**ent made two mistakes with the same customer, and the solution was provided by the customer, so you solved the problem like this. Now comes the weird remarks, and we have already compensated you. I said stop, do you have any misunderstanding about compensation? What compensation did you give me? The refunded money is my own. The other party said that we have spent so long and found a way to coordinate Ctrip's refund for you. Well, I have to be grateful that the mistake you made can be solved. I wasted your precious time. The key is that I came up with the solution. Sorry, I don't agree with the compensation you mentioned. Please compensate me in other ways. The other party said that I would like to give you an afternoon tea in Tianjin as compensation. When I just left, I said that I would go back and take care of things before I leave. You said no, don’t worry, it will be taken care of. The whole process took more than an hour, and I was also informed during the process that I had left Tianjin. You are just kidding me by offering me an afternoon tea as compensation. You thought I was causing trouble for you, so I said that I could only give a bad review, so tell me it’s okay.

msg:The ceiling of Tianjin Hotel is still the four seasons!
This is the first time I stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel. Sure enough, the Four Seasons is the representative of luxury brands! My feeling is completely different. We checked out from Conrad and Banyan Tree. Although these two hotels are very luxurious, the feeling of Four Seasons is beyond these two.
The first is the background. The flower art and artwork of the Four Seasons Hotel can be seen everywhere, and they are all carefully selected. They are not piled up, but sublimated, and are an artistic feast.
The room, privacy and sound insulation are top-notch. Four Seasons protects the privacy of guests very much. I can feel it immediately when I live in Four Seasons. Heavy doors keep out all noise and distractions. It is also difficult to see groups of Internet celebrities and miscellaneous people in the hotel. This privacy protection Four Seasons is very OK!
No matter the service, it's not about being at home, but about making new friends. Sister Wang Jingyi, the front desk supervisor, is very kind. She showed us around the hotel, introduced Tianjin's characteristics, and helped us arrange a satisfactory room. This is very kind! Getting along with friends makes me feel the boldness of the service, rather than the "work-oriented and process-oriented" cold check-in experience. This is what I yearn for most when I stay in a hotel!
The most outstanding thing is the swimming pool. The hotel swimming pool beats everything. The landscape and changing room facilities are second to none of other hotels. In terms of sense of luxury, Four Seasons wins.
To sum it up in one sentence, come to Tianjin, live in four seasons, and the service room landscape location is like a high-level fault.

msg:It is said to be the cheapest Four Seasons in China? In fact, it’s okay, the price is also very beautiful hahahaha, the hotel is in the city center, the most prosperous area, it’s relatively close to the porcelain houses on Five Avenues, the Binjiang Road and Chifeng Road behind it are easy to visit, and the subway station is downstairs. It is also very convenient to take a taxi, and there is everything around anyway. The gate and lobby are on the second floor of the whole building. You can take the elevator up directly, and check-in is also very fast. Although the Haihe River is not visible from the high floor, it looks good, but it is too close to the office building next to it, so the curtains are not drawn I always feel insecure 😂The other side of the hotel is a construction site, you can note the orientation. Because Tianjin seems to have a requirement not to provide disposable toiletries, the hotel will arrange for aunts to deliver them as needed, including welcome fruits, which are basically delivered within half an hour. In terms of service, the standard of the four seasons is still there, and the concierge will open the door enthusiastically with the luggage. The only thing is that it feels very mechanical. It may be because of too much work and too hot weather. At that time, my aunt also helped me divide up all kinds of medicines, put them away, and pack them up😂 I didn’t ask about turning down the bed, but she also took the initiative to clean up and replenish water to prepare for bedtime. The details can be thought of before the guests. I think this is the best of the four seasons a little. In general, it is a relatively balanced and cost-effective family of Four Seasons, and it is highly recommended if you come to Tianjin

The room layout is very nice, it can be seen that a lot of care has been taken. The girlfriend is super satisfied and the proposal is a success! In addition to the welcome fruit, I also sent a red velvet cake, very happy.
The decoration of the room is textured, the bed is moderately soft and hard, and the pillows are also very suitable. The bathroom is quite big, with two sinks, clean and bright! The drinks in the executive lounge are good, and the hotel's swimming pool is also great.
Special thanks to Jessie from the reservation depar**ent. From the room layout to the follow-up discounted reservations in the executive lounge, she is all there to help, and she also kindly helped us upgrade the room type for free. Ms. Wang at the front desk is also very professional, with a great attitude, and helped us get to the elevator. I am very satisfied with my stay, and I will choose Tianjin Four Seasons again in the future.

Due to a sudden emergency, Ms. Wang Meng at the front desk and the service staff in the two lounges were troublesome, but they were very enthusiastic, very patient, and handled things in an orderly manner. Thank you very much! The hotel facilities are still very complete, and the bedding is very good. Food quality is also really good. The dishes in the Chinese restaurant are quite unique. The construction site downstairs is still under construction at night, but I don't think it's very noisy. If I have to find out the shortcomings, there is only one pack of tissues in the room, which is a bit inconvenient to use. It would be great if the toilet in the bathroom could be replaced with an automatic one like the one on the first floor.

The location is very good, mainly because of the first-class view, the Chinese restaurant is Black Pearl, and the a**osphere and service of the spa and bar gusto are also first-class. Picky guests must stay at this hotel when they come to Tianjin. The service is very professional, and the hardware and software are OK. The only problem is that the breakfast on Saturday was a bit hectic, and the various supplies didn't keep up with it. I even grabbed fried eggs this morning. The breakfast chef hopes to strengthen training or send additional staff. Seeing guests waiting for fried eggs, take the initiative to fill them up. They should not be placed inside and wait for guests to pick them up. Except for the breakfast, everything else is worth the money and I am very satisfied.

The location is located on Binjiang Road, not far from the former residences of Zhang Xueliang and Zhang Ailing, and the Internet celebrity porcelain house can also be reached on foot. The lobby is located on the second floor, next to the Tianjin International Finance Center, which is considered a superior location. The lobby is open, without special design, quite satisfactory. The room is relatively large. Although the large cloakroom has limited use, it supports the sense of luxury of the room. The bed comfort is also excellent as always. Compared with other four seasons that cost several thousand, the price of more than 1,000 is considered to be a good cost performance. The swimming pool is much more popular than many hotels, and it has nothing to do. Overall, it can be recommended as a choice for accommodation in Tianjin.

The breakfast is more refined and the variety is okay. There are not too many people eating, and the environment is relatively quiet. Sometimes there will be incomplete meals, and it is more timely to make up for meals

In general, it still maintains the standard of the four seasons! Awesome!

The decoration style of the hotel is art deco, so you can understand it naturally
I upgraded the room type when I came to the site. The lighting and night view on the high floor are good. If you are bored, you can take pictures

Service: The remarkable thing is the service, which meets the needs without disappoin**ent

Environment: The fly in the oin**ent is that there is construction downstairs, and it is buzzing in the early morning (even if it is above the 20th floor), it is recommended that friends pay attention to it when choosing a room

The sound insulation is not bad, which is acceptable. When I checked in, the lady at the front desk was also very nice, and the staff who cleaned up the room were also very nice, replenishing things in time~ I checked in quickly.
The room is large, separated from wet and dry, with a bathtub~
The only problem is that the room is too hot, even if the air conditioner is not turned on, it may be because the lighting is too good, and the pillow and bed are too soft, I rarely come out to stay in a hotel because the bed is not used to sleeping well😭
After experiencing the swimming pool on the 8th floor, the small hot spring pool has a lot of impurities, which is in stark contrast to the temperature of the swimming pool!
Finally, I would like to praise the beautiful flowers in the front lobby of the hotel! ! !

The swimming pool is clean, very close to the Porcelain House and the Former Residence of Zhang Xueliang, not far from Fifth Avenue, Italian Style Street and Tianjin Eye. The location is relatively prosperous, and the downstairs is Joy City. All in all very good. There are two small problems. The room is too hot, too hot to bear. I hope that for the sake of energy saving, the room temperature can be moderately adjusted in combination with the outdoor temperature. In addition, the sink is not friendly to young children, it is too high, I hope it can be equipped with a footstool. But the flaws do not conceal the advantages, and you can still give a high-scoring hotel, and it will be a must-choice hotel for the next time you come to downtown Tianjin.

There are only two check-in counters at the front desk. It is recommended to increase them appropriately during peak seasons.
The room is very clean and big. Although the environment looks good from a distance, it actually looks like a big construction site when you look down.
The child likes to swim, so he didn't go anywhere else on purpose. He was in the swimming pool all afternoon. The temperature was quite suitable. It was a little cold when he first entered the water, so he could just stay for a while.
Children's supplies are complete, washing, slippers, bathrobes. Especially the bathrobes and slippers are also provided in different sizes according to the age of the children, which is very considerate.
The hotel facilities are quite new and well maintained. The bathtub in the house is not big, but it is enough for two children to play.
Because it was the fifth day of the ***** New Year, the dinner was accompanied by fireworks, which was very beautiful.

However, there are surprisingly many guests staying during the Spring Festival, which may be due to the sharp rebound in consumption and tourism after the epidemic. It is obvious that the hotel is slightly understaffed and the service cannot keep up. The most satisfying thing is that you can give your baby an extra bed for free. The hotel's heated swimming pool is very good, equipped with a children's pool. Children like it very much. The location of the hotel is very close to the Fifth Avenue, and the room has a good view. The quality of the buffet breakfast in the restaurant is generally good. There is my favorite smoked salmon. Unfortunately, the bacon is a bit hard, but it was a bit late for my friends to bring their children down for breakfast, so they had to wait for a seat. The experience was a bit poor. In the evening, I went to the bar on the 9th floor to experience it. It felt pretty good, and the desserts were great. I hope the hotel can continue to improve the service and increase manpower during peak seasons and holidays!

msg:The service is very good. I called two days in advance to confirm what I need, such as bed fence, swimming ring rental, and high floor. The last two of the three items have been fulfilled, which is very good. Parent-child rooms are all twin-bed rooms. The bed in the bedroom is too high. There is no bed to keep the children from worrying about falling and sleeping. Other than that, everything is good. The swimming pool for children is very warm and comfortable. The child is very satisfied after playing twice. There is also a Lego basketball stand in the room, so you can stay for a day without leaving the hotel. Although there is no shelter on the high floors, there is no view. Occasionally at night, you can see the surrounding residents putting flowers, which is very beautiful. By the way, the parent-child room is a big room, which is a suite; in addition, the location of the hotel is very good, surrounded by shopping malls, and it is very close to the Ci House, Zhang Ailing Cafe, and Zhang Xueliang's former residence (because the hotel is so comfortable, it turned out that there is nowhere to go) No turn, save it for next time)

Located in the absolute city center, close to all major attractions, the geographical location is superior✅
The room is spacious and elevated, and the panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows have a great view on the high floor! ✅
The floor heating design in the bathroom makes it warm for children to step on the marble barefoot in winter. According to teammates, the gym and swimming pool are nice✅
The key point is that the extra bed for the child's bed is free + the single bed is 1.35m/piece, which is better than other 5⃣️🌟 hotels, and it is the first choice for families with children and children traveling in Tianjin! ✅

The room is clean and tidy, the bathroom brand is high-end and a**ospheric, and the bedding is relatively comfortable. Cleaning the room 3 times a day and replenishing drinking water and capsule coffee are very timely. All the staff I encountered were very professional, efficient, and polite, and I felt very good! There were a lot of people in the breakfast room during the Spring Festival, but the hotel arranged it in an orderly manner. Three fly in the oin**ent points: 1. Breakfast food replenishment is not timely, and the most common strawberry jam has to be asked from the staff every day. 2. An extra bed is needed, the hotel informed that there is no more, and did not provide any suggestions for solutions. 3. The lighting of the swimming pool is not worthy of the Four Seasons brand, just like a public swimming pool.

Let’s talk about the Four Seasons Hotel in Tianjin. Every anniversary, we will find a Four Seasons Hotel to celebrate the four seasons together. The Four Seasons in Tianjin is really a very bad experience that I have encountered over the years. The toiletries designed for environmental protection in You's room, and the push pump, can definitely make Newton and his old man live.
The service can't keep up, and I have to call several times to ask the room service for a humidifier and mine-free.
Let me talk about the advantages of the Chinese New Year. The location is quite advantageous. The downstairs is the Binjiang Avenue Pedestrian Street, surrounded by porcelain houses, five avenues, etc.
attractions are also near. There are not many types of breakfast, but the ingredients are good, and the quality of cheese and yogurt is remarkable.
ps: You must go to the bar on the 9th floor

The location is very good, and the service is also good. It is also in line with the positioning of a luxury hotel. The room area is not very large. There is no cloakroom, only a wardrobe. The hardware is OK. It can only be said that it is the configuration of a normal luxury hotel. Smart switches, Samsung TV, and double washbasin design, but there is no TV in the bathroom, no The smart toilet and minibar are very rich, the price is similar to that of most luxury hotels, and the free drinks are quite satisfactory. The Illy capsule coffee machine, which is often used in four seasons, is very powerful. There are many TG tea bags, and the available space in the bathroom is not very large. It's a bit cramped, the double basin design, the bedding is very comfortable, it is the most comfortable hotel I have ever stayed in, none of them, the mattress, linen and pillows feel super good, the Chinese restaurant with a black pearl is generally average, the taste It's okay, but it is inferior to Cai Yi Xuan in Beijing Four Seasons Hotel. The breakfast is average, with freshly squeezed juice, and the service has a lead. Ask if you want coffee or tea, but the taste and the product are really average. Overall, the experience is good, and I feel that the four seasons treat others as themselves.

Second, the curtains do not block the light, and they light up at 6:00 in the morning.
Third, it is best to replace the hair dryer, the wind is too small, and the quality of the low-end Philips is too poor.
In the current situation of the epidemic, I hope the hotel can cherish every guest and maintain the attitude and standard that the four seasons should have!

msg:This family trip chose the Four Seasons Hotel, the environment is clean and tidy, and the service is also excellent! In particular, Jessie from the reservation depar**ent is very attentive and patient. There are two guest rooms and one suite. Not only are three rooms connected to facilitate guests' daily living, but also two rooms are connected, which is more convenient. From the reservation of the room to the arrangement of each meal, and even the choice of pillows, it is meticulous.
On the birthday of the family, the hotel personally prepared cakes🍰 and handwritten blessings, so that guests can feel the meticulousness and warmth of the hotel. If there is a chance in the future, I will still choose to stay at the Four Seasons Hotel Tianjin!

Transportation: The navigation is very convenient and the transportation is convenient. There are many small restaurants nearby, and there are also several shopping malls at the intersections, which generally meet the basic needs.

The staff from the front desk, concierge to housekeeping are very professional and answer any questions. Trouble the hotel to help make an appoin**ent to do nucleic acid at home, everything went smoothly, and the work efficiency was 100%!
The process of receiving foreigners is very skilled, and there is no problem with the language! Impeccable👍
I brought my little baby to the hotel for her birthday, and the hotel kindly wrote a birthday card in Chinese & English, which is so heartwarming ❤️
On the whole, I am very satisfied with the accommodation experience. I will definitely choose Four Seasons next time I come to Tianjin 🌿 I look forward to seeing you next time😊
Thank you for the amazing hospitality!!

    Both the buffet and the bar are on the 9th floor. The buffet breakfast is better than the dinner. The breakfast is very rich. The seafood I ate this time for dinner doesn't feel so fresh. I shouldn't come to the dinner buffet in the future.
    The bar is on the outdoor terrace. The night view is really beautiful. Recently, a little girl played DJ, which was very exciting.
    The swimming pool is my favorite, open and bright, a 1.25 swimming pool, and a hot spring pool, very relaxing. But some bear children really lack tutoring and keep spitting in the pool, which is disgusting!
    This time, I specially chose a bathtub room with floor-to-ceiling glass windows. I take a dip at night to eliminate the fatigue of the day. There is a surround sound in the bathroom. In short, I am very satisfied with this experience!

msg:It is said that it is the top three hotels in Tianjin, with new facilities and the brand of Four Seasons, so I booked a room. The room looks high-end, but it can’t stand up to scrutiny. A drawer can’t be put back when it’s pulled out. A sliding door is frightening to push. There’s also a dangling power plug that doesn’t work, and an air conditioner that blows hot air at the same time... It's not that they don't pay attention to details at all. The English books on the bookshelf are very popular for children. On the first day of check-in, they generously gave a box of mineral water. The cute little prince's toiletries should make children's eyes shine. The young lady at the front desk It's not easy to say hello by my name the next day! But the more serious problem is the elevator and breakfast. After the second day of junior high school, the number of occupants increased sharply. The four elevators could not bear the use of guests during peak breakfast hours. The restaurant was also crowded. Waiting for a seat is not a solution. As for whether the breakfast is good or not, that is a matter of opinion, so I won't discuss it.

msg:Due to the epidemic, this year's anniversary was not able to travel, so I chose to celebrate at the hotel. I am glad that the epidemic prevention policy that can catch up with Beijing-Tianjin commuting this week has just been eased. Because I was catching up with the Tianjin Dashui on the weekend, I was afraid of being locked in the community, so I came out early and arrived at the hotel after nine o'clock. The hotel arranged a check-in for us in advance. When I checked in, I was told that I was here on the anniversary. My husband was a Beijing-Tianjin commuter and was asked to do an antigen test. I also volunteered to do it together. What about the anniversary? The form is ok. When I returned to my room after dinner, I instantly felt happy when I saw the furnished room. In the afternoon, due to the epidemic situation in Beijing bars, the sudden change in Tianjin's epidemic prevention policy really made us anxious when commuting in Beijing and Tianjin. During this special period, the husband can go back to Tianjin and have a romantic anniversary with various emotions mixed in. It is also an unforgettable experience.

The overall feeling is quiet in the middle of the noise. It is very convenient to eat and go shopping. There is a parking lot underground. His Chinese restaurant is the Black Pearl Restaurant. The dishes taste quite good, you can try it! The disadvantages are as follows: the elevator speed is not too fast, and you have to wait for a few minutes each time. The biggest drawback is that the toilet in the five-star hotel is not intelligent, and it is cold to sit on!

msg:Back to Tianjin to visit relatives, 1.31-2.2 stay at the Four Seasons Hotel, harvest a pleasant stay experience.
1. It is located next to Isetan, in the center of Tianjin, no more than 3-4 kilometers away from the main attractions and commercial centers, so it is convenient to travel.
2. At the moment of the epidemic, when checking in, the gate and the front desk patiently inquire about the itinerary, check the health code, itinerary code, and nucleic acid report, and be conscientious and responsible.
3. On the day of check-in, the air-conditioning in the room was a little weak, and the room was cold. After communicating with the hotel, the room will be exchanged in time, and the manager on duty will follow up by phone later to confirm that the problem has been solved, which reflects the professional attitude of the hotel team to solve the problem for the guests.
4. Because you need to go out on New Year's Eve and worry about not being able to take a taxi at night, communicate with the concierge if there is a car that can be arranged to pick you up to the hotel, and the response to the car arrangement and charge communication is also timely and clear. Although I didn't use the hotel service in the end, I still have to praise the efficient and professional response of the concierge.
5. All the staff in the concierge, front desk, room service depar**ent, and restaurant service staff greet the guests with smiles. They will reply in case of any problems, and communicate in a timely and clear manner. It can be seen that the entire hotel team has good training and management.
6. The hotel provides special toiletries, toothbrushes and slippers for children. There is also a small schoolbag with four seasons tree pattern, which children like very much.
7. Pork sausages are recommended for western food for breakfast, and Chinese wontons are good.

The yellow liquid sprayed on the side of the bathroom sink in the room is still there after it dries! Turn down the bed, it's very warm! The breakfast service is very attentive and the waiters are well-trained! Very satisfied with check-in and check-out at the front desk!

msg:The booking is indeed a bad review, even comparable to the old four seasons in Shanghai (the one just closed). First of all, the hotel is on the second floor. To open it up, the doorway is messy, with doors on both sides, selling houses on the left and the lobby on the right. The doorman did not comment, and the two chatted from the door, and did not come to pick up their luggage.
Because my friend came to Tianjin to play, I wanted to give it a good treat. I booked two four-season rooms with a view. They did not have the same floor, one on the 11th floor and the other on the 12th floor. As soon as I entered the door, I was shocked. The view turned out to be the messy roof of the nearby shopping mall. Then I read Ctrip's evaluation of the same room type and found that many people had encountered the same problem. I consulted the front desk and was told that the cheaper premium twin room has a better view. , The floor is higher. (In other words, expensive = poor?) The front desk also expressed confusion, but there was no alternative. Regardless of the direction or the height of the floor, there is very little value of price reciprocity.
The hotel's carpets were not cleaned. It clearly showed that it opened in 2017, but it already has a strong smell of musty carpets.
Let's talk about breakfast. It's very ordinary, and it's correct in the evaluation. There was a very big bug. The steam in the steamer area was at the highest temperature. All the dim sum was broken in one clip. Everyone who opened the basket was scalded. , The dishes were not changed in time. Tofu Nao waited for 20 minutes and there was no new arrival.
And I don’t understand, obviously the elevator utilization rate is not high, four times use is very slow (you can see the evaluation of other guests), and even worse, the elevator is still under maintenance when leaving the shop. (Understandable but very influential to the check-in experience)
Finally, the ipad in the house and the power supply on one side were out of power.
A nigh**are experience, I wanted to give my friends a perfect travel experience, but I didn't expect it to be so.
An experience that was so angry that I wanted to refund money.

msg:The hotel responded positively to the special request after booking, and informed in advance that there might be a bit of mess on the construction site downstairs. Such a response must be like, this is the standard of hospitality that a five-star hotel should have. Of course, after moving in, I found that the construction site downstairs was not a big problem. The best thing about the hotel is that it is located in the commercial center, downstairs Joy City, Isetan, subway, and of course parking is very convenient and free. In addition to the commercial area, you can also see the TV tower in the distance. It's just that the glass is slightly dirty. It may be difficult to take pictures. I believe it will be great after wiping the glass. Because I didn’t bring my toothbrushes, the hotel quickly arranged the guest room to send a disposable toothpaste toothbrush. After opening the package, the two middle-aged and old couples laughed for ten minutes...and brushed their teeth with this virgin toothbrush at night. I believe it’s just a misunderstanding. Another fly in the oin**ent is that the table in the living room is not cleaned up. It may be that the fragments of the flower mud from the roses are left on the table.

The lobby of the hotel is very beautiful, the handsome guy at the front desk is patient and kind, and answers all questions. He explained the hotel’s restaurant facilities in detail and gave us a free upgrade to the twin room, which is a panoramic room with floor-to-ceiling windows. The hotel is located in the city center, surrounded by a big shopping mall pedestrian street, not far from the attractions, within walking distance. Very satisfied with a staying experience.

There is no one that meets the standards of a five-star hotel. The hot spring pool next to the swimming pool has a particularly poor water quality and great taste! The service is also very poor! The attitude is not good. After I left the room, I drank milk tea in the lobby and refused to let me say this is take-out food. Drinking is not allowed? ? ? ?

服務：酒店前台、禮賓和餐廳小姐姐都非常的熱情，並且服務態度很好，符合五星酒店的標準。告知生日還贈送了紅酒和蛋糕。特別是餐廳和大堂酒廊小姐姐服務非常在線。
衞生：我覺得作為天津的地標性酒店不應該犯這麼低級的錯誤，房間內牀頭櫃和貴妃榻下竟然還遺留有上位住客的物品 一個小鏡子和一支祛漬筆，因為是晚上關燈後反光才看到的所以也沒再和酒店説。
設施：酒店停車場內停車位較少自駕的話不是很方便。最重要的是！作為四季酒店我覺得不應該讓住客發現床尾外沿皮破損的情況，直接皮質包圍劃開耷拉着了 好像我這兩天都是睡的一張破床。且房間內所有的電源插座包括洗手間都已經老化且鬆動 吹風機不按着的話根本不過電 床頭也衹有一側插座可以使用 另一側根本用不了。房間內温度較高 很悶這一點對於我來説也是有點接受不了。天津四季的品控相對於杭州、廣州四季品控真的是有點差了。
上一次因為入住時房間衞生差寫過一次4星評價了，沒想到第二次比第一次體驗感還要差 所以以後也不會再去選擇天津四季了。不過酒店內津韻餐廳不錯 以後還會再去的。

衞生不是特別好， 好多細節沒有弄， 比如電話網上的一層灰塵； 浴缸裡頭發， 角落裡的不乾淨。 洗手間馬桶也舊; 肥皂需要打電話給前台要才給。 
給了歡迎水果，但是給了兩個沒有削皮的蘋果， 給個麪包刀怎麼吃？ 就很多細節感覺都沒有做好。 

床還可以 挺舒服的； 椅子沙發都挺好，房間裏辦公
很舒服。 大廳裏的大聖誕樹挺美。

服務：禮賓和工作人員特別有愛！看着兩個外地人穿的可少！在天津呼嘯的大風裡拿外賣！喊我們不要出去！他們幫我們拿進來😂！而且剛好碰到大降温！


環境：喜歡酒店的很多室內裝飾細節！沒什麼機會出去逛！但是看地圖附近東西很多！去哪裡都方便！

衞生：細節差一丟丟！淋浴間的門有水印記（￣∇￣）！看起來很影響觀感！
但是布草地毯床品細節都還可以！

早餐:這個就很一般…🥲中點基本半成品全覆蓋…整體偏西式…茶還不錯！咖啡真是太太太太太難喝！
另外早上餐廳温度還比較低誒！

msg:對四季品牌有一定了解和期待才訂的，但是結果是天津四季是所有住過的五星級酒店裡麪性價比最低的，舉個例子，洲際旗下的五星，2千六七這個價位，房間的迷你吧是免費的，每天還補充；馬哥孛羅或者香格里拉是會給行政酒廊待遇的，然而四季這兩點都沒有，歡迎水果就三個橘子。。。而且我們入住的房間衞生間門有問題合不攏導致整個房間透光，第一晚凌晨四點半到五點之間還被不知哪來的巨大噪音吵醒，而且這個噪音一直持續了20多分鐘——此時我才明白為啥房間居然配備了慢回彈耳塞！事後酒店的解釋是旁邊的工地併為我們免費升級了套房，但是還是嚴重影響了我們這次五一假期出遊的心情！有問題的房間還高價售賣可以想見酒店的管理
早餐也很一般，中式熱菜很少，西點相對多點。運氣不好還得排隊等位。我們在電梯遇到別的住客也是在羣嘲早餐配不上星級。我個人的感覺是他們早餐區域太小了容不下太多人同時就餐，所以餐品種類少點差點就不會有人一直吃，不然的話，為啥酒店的中餐廳是黑珍珠級別，單人平均消費500，早餐卻沒啥中式餐品可吃？
衞生方面，開水壺壺蓋上一層灰驚到我了，但是別的地方都還行。酒店電梯運力不足，經常等很久。
其他比較好的方面也就是服務了，算是比較熱情主動的，客房服務響應速度也很快。酒店位置也不錯，旁邊就是和平路夜市和瓷房子，五大道離得不遠，去海河邊上散步騎個共享單車過去也很快

餐飲方面有點遜色，特別是西餐廳的自助餐，品種少、菜品呈現的色相一般、價格與菜品不成正比。中餐廳以粵菜為特色，但有的菜品偏離了粵菜的味道（菜品的搭配、菜品的用料）。
客房中使用的坐便器很老式了。
客房中環境做的很乾凈，沖淋房內沒有一點污漬痕跡，玻璃明亮，地上的角落裡也很乾凈。
很好的二天體驗，很滿意的二天。

缺點：1、酒店電梯壞了。2、酒店沒有纖維枕頭。3、客房服務員不知道什麼是香檳杯，堅持説用葡萄酒杯就可以。4、浴室裏沒有浴鹽，浴室裏有別人的頭髮。5、從客房要了刀叉時，他們帶了一次性餐具。6、週一酒吧不開門。

總分：2/3。

衞生：衞生挺好的，工作人員打掃衞生也很積極。
服務：服務好，散落在沙發上的衣物還順手幫忙疊了一下。

2.房間19樓，270度景觀，晚上入住，cbd 景觀很打眼，對面的樓體燈光確實很眩。就是有點近，需要注意遮擋私隱。酒店的設施（洗手盆）不新但是很乾凈。最貼心的是地面都是地暖，地磚的防滑性很好。房間空間大，挑高好，很舒適。夜床服務很好，還提供了冰桶。mini 吧雖然收費，但是產品很齊全。床品不用説了，高檔酒店的都很舒服。這個景觀浴缸的房型，採光太好了，對於女士來説早上化粧太友好了。另外要説一下，四季酒店的裝修風格色調搭配都是很高雅的。
3.早餐餐廳，整體安靜，入口私密性也很好，太喜歡這個調高了，心情都沉靜了。靠窗，能看到空中花園，今天天氣不錯，景觀就更好看了。服務員帶位，還保留着服務員送茶和咖啡的傳統。很好。餐品有天津特色，豆腐腦，鍋巴菜都是特色。個人認為，餐品種類無需特別特別多，精緻好吃最重要。

msg:攜程訂房已經提前付過房費，但還是需要收5000按金，最重要不是第一次住，但每次標準不同，已經全額付完房費還得收這麼多按金，真是活久見。
預定說明需要住一周，訂房備註毛巾用品乾淨，結果第一天入住毛巾確實可以，第二天就清潔房間換的毛巾非常髒，已經耗損的很薄殘舊，還不乾淨，脫了衣服準備洗澡才發現，非常鬱悶打去客房部要求專門換，本來就挺累還得折騰。
第三天發現打掃房間很離譜，貌似有整理房間，但洗手間的地確沒有清潔，一地頭髮赫然在目，可想而知這管理和清潔。
第四天外面辦完事回來，看見房間門打開，赫然發現一個工作人員在我房間，然後充滿留下一句我幫您檢查一下房間衛生，我沒來得及回一句人就走了。
記不住是哪一天回來，房間門上掛著一個紙袋，打開一看，裡面是一些水果和一盒小點心，然後一張卡片，說明道歉之類的意思，但不知是哪一件事道歉，看看水果是壞的。。非常無語

msg:2019年來天津住過一次，2023年第二次住。不推薦。酒店反饋響應天津市環保政策要求，酒店房間不主動提供牙刷牙膏等洗漱用品。酒店並未提前告知，辦理入住時才知道，需要入住客人自行領取洗漱用品。在電梯裏遇到一些同樣手拿牙刷牙膏的入住客人，略顯尷尬，像極了公共洗浴會所。這種操作與酒店的品牌不太相符。不會再選擇這裏入住。

房間晚上很熱，工作人員回覆是沒辦法，空調是固定的，最後解決方案是給一個空調扇，當我打算繼續瞭解下還有什麼辦法時，對方顯然已經想結束通話了。

後來，空調扇送來了，但是，推進門轉頭就走了，哈哈，這還挺意外的。即使在低一級別酒店，至少也會給打開，並告知一下如何使用。

酒店人員熱情，對小朋友非常友好，有圖畫遊戲和糖果。
客服人員經過了良好的培訓，提供小朋友的毯子。游泳池有小童的温水池，工作人員耐心提供服務。泳池的花灑很沖，對比之下房間的花灑有些堵了。夜景非常美。
下次來天津還會首選四季，對小朋友非常友好。

msg:硬件設施很不錯。拐角房房間面積大。因為是拐角房，全落地玻璃，可以看到很不錯的城市景觀。窗簾是電動窗簾，浴室是雙台盆設計，靠窗有大浴缸。但是馬桶是普通馬桶，而不是智能馬桶，這點減分。歡迎水果很寒酸，一個橘子兩個蘋果，連普通的三四星酒店都不如。浴袍不錯，拖鞋比較單薄。游泳池和健身房非常贊。很寬敞。游泳池邊上有一個大泡池，大泡池面對落地玻璃可以看到天津的城市天際線。更衣間裏也有桑拿和泡池。要注意游泳池的更衣櫃是密碼鎖，不是前台給電子鎖，自己要記住櫃子的號碼，否則游泳回來忘了自己櫃子的號碼就麻煩了。大堂的大吊燈和兩排竹林也相當華貴。酒店樓層在1-26層，高度不夠，所以窗外的景觀不算太出色，不如隔壁的威斯汀。


比起硬件，服務很一般。首先開夜床服務幾乎不及格。開夜床衹是放了兩瓶水在床頭，然後把窗簾拉上就沒了。沒有擺水杯，沒有擺拖鞋，散落的電線插頭也沒有整理，也沒有把被子掀開一個角，完全不懂這樣開夜床的意義在哪兒。其次送東西比較慢。要求送一桶食用冰，打了兩次電話，等了40分鐘才送過來。酒店不配備牙膏牙刷刮鬍刀什麼的，説是天津的規定，需要的話找前台拿。可是住其他的天津酒店並沒有類似的規定。然後頗為尷尬的是酒店給我們的這些衞浴用品，沒有袋子裝，讓我們自己裝包裏。四季這樣的服務是説不過去的。最後四季酒店似乎衹認錢。其他酒店集團，大床房換成雙床房都是免費的，這裏要加收200多，這個做法雖然沒有問題，但很難培養出用户忠誠度吧。


周邊：酒店後面就是濱江道步行街，各種購物中心。步行街北端的恆隆廣場，有一個歷史建築改造成的網紅星巴克（恆隆廣場星巴克旗艦店），很有特色。步行街南端是天主教天津教區西開總堂，也非常漂亮。
酒店另外一側就是五大道，各種歷史建築改造成的

msg:作為天津奢華酒店三巨頭之一，天津四季真的沒讓我失望。
在我預訂之後，因為我來過紀念日，所以他們派專人聯繫我，給我佈置房間。
值班經理Stella人也非常nice，為了讓我的入住體驗更棒，送了我全套行政待遇，並幫我升級了房間。
值得一提的是，四季送了一套下午茶，質量非常高。happyhour也變成了全日制餐廳自助。在我到達餐廳的時候，他們會根據我的飲食禁忌給我做出提示。我覺得這種服務真的很貼心。
而客房響應速度也很快，在房間的平板電腦上提出需求以後，基本上10分鐘之內就會幫忙解決，效率很高。我非常喜歡這種高效温暖的服務。
在酒店行業，四季是一個特殊的存在。沒有常旅客計劃，衹為讓每一位旅客賓至如歸。希望天津四季越來越好，也希望下次我能體驗到更好的服務。

🚗 交通：位於市中心很方便。
🧹衞生：打掃及時。
