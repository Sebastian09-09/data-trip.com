Next door to a mall with many food options as well. Hotel is slightly dated and definitely needs more lighting in the room and corridors.  Room was a junior suite with great views of People Square.

It‚Äôs at exit 5 or exit 19 of Peopls‚Äôs Square  metro station, and next to the beginning of the Nanjiang Road Walkway leading to The Bund. Linked to Êñ∞‰∏ñÁïåÂüé shopping mall with lots of restaurants, a cinema and Madame Tussaud museum. Services are great- must compliment the staff. Rooms esp the mid to lower floors ones are a bit torn out. The newer renovated ones (superior rooms) are located on the upper floors and they are far better. Overall, great value for money.

msg:Our stay at the Radisson Blu was so disappointing that we both made notes but have waited to post the review so that some of the frustration could subside. We‚Äôve stayed at the Radisson multiple times as it‚Äôs been our hotel of choice for business and pleasure for many (15+) years. This stay was specifically for business.

Upon check-in we were told that our room had no window, even for almost 900 CNY that we paid on Trip. And that payment was only a guarantee. Fine. So, we agreed to pay an additional 100 CNY to have a window.

Then, we were also told that we needed to pay (WeChat) 1500 CNY and that would include the cost of the room rate and the deposit. No sincere explanation or apology by the person at the check-in counter, just a lot of uncomfortable laughing and ‚Äúpay now, pay now.‚Äù We felt like we were being cheated even though this was normal policy.

To be fair, the room given had an amazing view. We were very satisfied and had begun to think the worst was behind us.

We ordered room service that included wonton (dumplings) soup, a classic Caesar salad, and a margherita pizza. The wonton soup was great, but the margherita pizza was barely passable, and the classic Caesar salad was an abomination. Hands down, it was the worst Caesar salad we had ever had. Tiny bacon bits, smelly yellow oil, and old lettuce. We ate two bites and quickly placed it outside in the hallway where it sat until 10:00am the next day. Note: you can only order premium (expensive) bottled water and we were told that they couldn‚Äôt give us any more ‚Äúregular‚Äù bottled water even if we said we‚Äôd pay for it.

At night, the staff at the fitness center acted as if we were disturbing them when we asked basic questions. A total lack of hospitality that should be on display at a 5-star hotel. We really began to dislike our experience at this point because it became quite evident that nobody really cared. To again be fair, however, the male staff who was on duty in the next morning, was sincere and polite. A welcoming contrast from the evening before.

But then at brunch, the three young men who were running the egg and omelet station were horribly loud and rude. Like everything was a big joke to them ‚Äì and it got to the point where we just walked away even after we had tried to order.

After brunch, probably the biggest disappointment was that we found out that the Business Center was closed. We had scheduled an important meeting at the hotel and needed to print and prepare some items. We were told that we could only print if we emailed the documents to a hotel email. This was not going to happen so we created a little fuss and a polite manager suddenly appeared and handled everything. That was nice. But the damage was done.

After this situation, we made the decision that this would be our last time staying at the Radisson.

Lastly, after more than 24 hours, the guarantee was only refunded after we called and spoke to a customer service representative at Trip who was very helpful.

Even though we had requested a room with a walk in shower as my husband has mobility issues due to a knee injury there was only a bath in the bathroom.  Because we had indicated that we did not wish to use the minibar , there was no access to a fridge in the room and we were only given one small bottle of water each.  We stayed for 5 nights at the nearby Park Hotel earlier in the month and it was much better- and less money!

The carpet looks rather filthy. Although meant to be for families, only 2 breakfasts are included. If you need an extra bed for a fifth person, they will charge you. There were not enough breakfast tables so you had to wait, and one morning the coffee machines did not work because of an electricity issue. All in all a pretty outdated and overprized hotel. Only positive thing is the location.

msg:Exceptionally well located hotel, a little old but still in very good shape. large place, so staff was kept pretty busy. Friendly concierge desk, though their rates for a car were quite overpriced relative to didi or cab from out front. Paid a half-day's rate to extend my stay to 6pm due to food sickness the previous night (did not try the hotel restaurants, so it definitely wasn't hotel related); would have preferred to have avoided the extra charge, but overall I felt the hotel was good value for money. 

for anyone interested/needing urgent medical care, I had a good experience at Shanghai East International ER, which I visited over the hotel's recommended closer alternative because I gambled that the more distant hospitals' international clientele would ensure they had a drug on hand that had quickly cleared up similar symptoms before. happily I won that bed. roads were clear at 1am so it was quick to reach despite the distance. registration and a consult with the internist on staff that night were ÔºúUSD5, and the medication was USD10. we were in and out in 20 minutes.

I requested Judy to upgrade me from the superior room to Junior Suit and give me my old room on the 29th floor as it would be difficult for me to pack my bag again and shift to another room.
She understood my problem and helped me to upgrade without any hassle.
But I was disappointed with the variety of breakfast. 98% menu was the same for all five days.

Out of the window there was quite bad, but I didn‚Äôt care. 

And be aware: there is not a single usb plug in the room, I asked to get a plug, but was told I have to pay a deposit in cash - no digital payments accepted üôÑ

Traditionally designed with modern amenities and spacious bathroom. There‚Äôs a lovely swimming pool with lanes, best used during quiet hours of the morning before sampling a great selection of dishes in the restaurant for breakfast. Fantastic location for access to central Shanghai.

Each time I groggily explained that there colleague was not there, upon the fourth call, I called the duty manager and was shocked to find out that she was the one actually making/ connecting the call for these men. This was 2-4am, each call a new random man. The first call was fine, but to make 4 calls, did she not think to confirm if I knew these men first, and after 4 consecutive calls to the same room not going well, with them asking to go to my room---did she not think there was something wrong, and she should stop making the calls for these men?

I did not sleep well the rest of the night, and honestly feel  irked by the whole experience-- we were 2 girls alone in a foreign country.

One odd design feature of my bedroom was that the window was essentially blocked by the wall, so I don't really know what that was about.

The couches were old and dirty and even had a towel put over them by housekeeping to cover the stains...but it looks unprofessional.

The bathroom and bedding were clean.

The housekeeper was very nice, friendly and considerate of my sleeping child while she cleaned.

the location and relatively lower price make up for the old room.

The checkin and out staff were very angry, barking orders and shouting at everyone in line. This was the same both as I was checking in and checking out. Obviously they are stressed and dealing with a lot of cultural differences but it felt very personal. Finally, the non smoking room I was given smelled like it had just been smoked in for 30 years.  The staircase just behind the room seems to be the smoking area for other guests.

But, in this hotel, the reception staff just don't like foreigners and they treat us very badly, they are rude, boorish and don't make us feel welcome. Moreover, few of them speak something like English or they just don‚Äôt wanna speak English at all.

My appointment required me to have a special diet for two days, so I ordered room service and the staff acted promptly in getting me my food.  I stayed an extra day after my medical appointment and then was able to enjoy hotel facilities and the revolving restaurant at the top of the tower.  My only complaint was that being on the 27th floor was a bit lonely.  Next time, I might ask to be closer down so I can see the hustle and bustle of life in Shanghai.

However what stood out about this hotel is the service ‚Äî beyond excellent. Each member of staff we interacted with was polite, courteous and helpful. Duty Managers Mr. Jeff and Ms. Rose were absolutely wonderful and went above and beyond to help us handle a very difficult situation. Personally very grateful to them.

The room was very clean, beautiful and quite spacious.  
We did not enjoy breakfast at the hotel as our appointment was quite early, but we did get some coffee sachets in the room which we used.
The hotel is in the CBD and extremely close to the Shanghai wax museum!  A very good experience!

The bathroom shower would need a hose at least, as it's not comfortable to shower a kid in there otherwise. The staff is generally attentive and polite, although at night one attendant at the lobby kept looking & playing with his phone while I was asking a question... The restaurant breakfast buffet is pretty varied and for lunch & dinner as well. We did go upstairs to the 45th floor for lunch and dinner for my b-day, but maybe because it's CNY they had shortage of some food items. Also, I think the food is pricey, or it's charged based on the hotel's location, but the food is pretty regular with regards to any typical restaurant in Sh. I'd still go up there for the great city views. The hotel connects with a shopping mall. All in all, we had a good time there.

I was directed to my room, I was however not happy with the feeling of my first room- I called reception and she was very quick to give me another room even though it was so late. I am very grateful for this. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the fact that she didn‚Äôt help to show me where the room was so I spent a long time trying to figure out how to get to the room (I understand the time was very late) - thankfully a lovely security guard saw my frustration and guided me exactly to where I needed to go. The second room was lovely, with a lovely view. In the morning I went to breakfast and ate overlooking the city near the window- this was a peaceful way to start my first morning in Shanghai. I was warmly greeted by a foreigner chef who offered to make me anything I liked (even though the choice of buffet was very large). This kind of service is great- the service overall though wasn‚Äôt bad but wasn‚Äôt necessarily the best I‚Äôve experienced with staying at a Radisson, but having said that whenever I did go out of my way I to speak with someone they did warmly helped me. This is other than the security and chef. They were awesome!

msg:Generally a nice hotel. Great location on the side of People's Square. The rotating restaurant upstairs has incredible views of the city, but is priced a bit high for what you get. I had the steak, and the chef was able to actually make it medium rare, but it was a thin cut of meat. 
You can either have a room that is high or a room with a bathtub. Having to make that decision was tough. I got the high room so I had a nice view... But a bathtub would have also been nice. The pool was nice. Not too big, but was able to swim. If you look at pictures of the pool, you see what looks like a round jacuzzi. It's not. Slightly warmer than the pool, but not a hot tub.
For me, the hotel was nice. Not luxury, not cheap. A fair middle ground. I think with a few upgrades, they could make it better, but for the price, I was satisfied.

msg:The fact that there is a minibar is very nice, however, it could not be any more overpriced. The price of a tonic water or soda was 30RMB ($4.70USD) which is a ridiculous price considering it's easy and convenient to pay less by simply getting it delivered. Also charging 50RMB ($7.80USD) for Evian water was ridiculous. Of course both of these were entirely optional, but it seems so pointless to offer these services at such an exorbitant price point. 

We also came for the New Year buffet which was over 200RMB for all-you-can eat. The food was horrendous. It was very clear that they tried to make the food as cheap as possible as the hot plates had lots of repeat dishes of spaghetti and potatoes. It was incredibly disappointing for a final meal of 2021. Nevertheless, the bar upstairs was excellent. We had a great time there - the drinks and snacks were great and you can't beat the view and atmosphere of the place.

Hotel staff were also excellent. There was no ice machine on the floor, but whenever I would call for ice, there would be someone at the door within 5 minutes.

The room appeared to be mostly clean, but there was one mirror that surely hadn't been dusted for some time and there was dust on the kettle. The shower head looked scary, should probably be changed out. The bed was low to the floor and the pillows were flat with no life to them. I would stay again, but there are other options in the vicinity that I'd try first before making it my go to hotel. My room was listed as superior, but it was not.

The breakfast was the same usual western buffet you would get from most franchise hotels. The hotel room was of satisfactory standards. My favourite moment during my stay was enjoying the facilities such as the swimming pool, sauna, and warm bath. The gym was also quite useful and the service on offer in that area was very good. All of the staff spoke in English and they were very polite. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and I would go back just to enjoy the facilities.

The hotel is beautiful but when you get inside the rooms the decor is very outdated. The restaurant for breakfast is nice but extremely busy and the food provided doesn‚Äôt match that of a 5* international brand hotel. I was first given a room with no window, why would anyone going to a 5* hotel want a room with no window?? Went to reception and had to pay to change rooms, 200rmb per night. Ridiculous when the room I was changed too cost only 50rmb more per night than what I had paid. So why did I 4X the price. I felt robbed. For the price I feel there are better 5* star hotels in this area.

So easy to navigate anywhere, right across from the People's Square metro station, lovely rooms, good food, rotating restaurant and bar, friendly service, what else could you ask for? My only tiny complaint is that they only give you 2 small bottles of water for the day, which isn't enough for evening and morning. Next time I will request more water immediately so that I don't wake up thirsty! But I will always choose the Radisson in Shanghai.

1- there's no morning call
2- ask the operator questions they refuse to answer you. they will even yell at you.

I complained. and the manager Jeff said because the operator has many phone calls everyday so her temper is bad. is that what you say to customers? 

I thought hotel is supposed to be a customer service. but this hotel isn't. but good price for 2 rooms. but the tv. haha it's very blurry. 

this hotel should be rate 3.5 stars. guarantee not a 5 star hotel. will never be back.

Washcloths are not provided. The deposit is ¬•500/night which can add up to quite a lot depending on the length of stay. I loved the staff's friendliness and willingness to help.

We had a room that had 2 rooms (living room and bedroom) and 2 bathrooms. The bed is very comfortable, you can sleep well. There is breakfast from 7:30 to 10:30.

On the top floor there is a panoramic restaurant with a gorgeous view!!! I advise you to go there. As well as a cafe, a swimming pool and luxurious hotel interiors.

I'll definitely come back here. I really liked everything, the only thing is that the renovation in the rooms is not so fresh - but this is forgivable.

The front desk staff are amiable and patient. It makes people feel at home. The room is tidy and the bedding is clean. The lighting and ventilation are good, and the view outside the window is wide and pleasing to the eye. The daily necessities are neatly arranged and easy to use.

And there is an entrance to a tunnel through which you can get in a trailer to the other side of the river to the Pearl Tower.
Breakfast is quite good, there is Chinese and European food, even oa**eal (without salt/sugar) and very tasty ice cream, yogurt, fruit, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãcheese, sausages, coffee machines. The only meats are bacon and sausages (not very tasty).
In the revolving restaurant on the 45th floor during the day you can drink tea with a selection of pastries and admire the city.
The room is quite spacious, there is a table, an armchair, the window can be opened for ventilation, the sockets fit our plugs. In the bathroom there are bottles of shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, a dental kit, and a hairdryer.
Large swimming pool (a cap is required, they may give you one, but we brought our own), jacuzzi. The showers have a sauna and a hammam cabin, but it was always cold. Showers are in poor condition, doors are broken, not very clean. The men's showers also have small pools with cold and warm water.

Crossing the road is Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street. It takes 15 minutes to walk to the Bund. It is very convenient to go to any tourist attraction. Jessica at the front desk was very enthusiastic and patiently understood the needs. She upgraded to a superior suite with a view of the Pearl Tower. The room was large, clean and comfortable. I unexpectedly saw the sunset and sunrise, which was very beautiful. The water temperature of the swimming pool was moderate. The children went swimming every day and loved it. A very satisfactory stay, highly recommended, and I will definitely stay again next time I go to Shanghai.

This time, the clients were visiting China. We specially booked a family room in order to have a spacious room for meetings. Since the room was under repair when we arrived at the hotel, the front desk manager Oliver took the trouble to give us many options and took us to see them one by one. Finally, we were satisfied with our stay and successfully completed the meeting. Feeling very satisfied!

msg:The location is very good. When you go out and cross the road, you are at the sightseeing bus stop. Less than a hundred meters away is the subway station. There are 3 subway lines. Going east through **** is the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street.
Room facilities: The cheapest room I booked. This is probably the smallest and most inconvenient hotel room I have ever stayed in. There is an aisle in the room. It is a bit difficult to walk from the bed after closing the curtains. The furniture and facilities are a bit old, the hotel is very frugal, and the hand towels have a hole in them and are still in use. But anyway, I don‚Äôt plan to stay in the hotel except for sleeping, so the location is good and convenient for traveling.
Service: Apart from check-in and check-out, I didn't use any other services. When I checked in, I queued for at least half an hour and there were quite a lot of people. There is only one room card. It is very inconvenient to travel separately. It is recommended to give one more room card.
Breakfast: The room booked does not include meals, I don‚Äôt know how it is.
Soundproofing: The hotel feels quite quiet. I was tired from walking during the day and slept well at night.
Cost-effectiveness: The overall cost-effectiveness is quite high. It is very suitable for traveling by bus. After visiting the pedestrian street, you can walk back to the hotel.

msg:In fact, I and my family have stayed at this hotel many times. The location is good and the transportation is convenient, and there are many restaurants on Huanghe Road nearby. Overall, I am satisfied, but this time I encountered that the front desk was not flexible enough in handling things and needs to be improved. When my family comes back from a trip, I take an early flight and arrive at the hotel at six o'clock. I can ask the front desk if I can check in early or pay a certain price difference. As a result, the front desk told me that I needed to pay 600 yuan because their room would not be available until at least 15:00. When I checked, the house price that day was only 810 yuan. I thought about paying 400 yuan, but after all, there were elderly people. I almost booked a room for 600 yuan. As a result, the front desk refused to reduce the price due to high occupancy rate. I had to go there at six o'clock to walk around and wait for my room to be checked out. Thinking that this is the case, the hotel will at least arrange to provide rooms as soon as possible. I don't know whether it is because there was no note when the shift was handed over, or because I didn't make up for the check-in to earn a reward. My family was afraid that they still couldn't come over, so they stayed out until two o'clock to come over to handle the matter. Check in. As a result, I was told that the room would not be available until three o'clock and that it was being cleaned now. I am really speechless for such a service, so I have to give this my first negative review on Ctrip.

msg:The hotel should be regarded as a landmark in Shanghai, and its flying saucer-shaped revolving restaurant is very recognizable. The hotel's superior suites have an extra triangular study room than the superior rooms, which also means an extra view. It's quite comfortable and I like it very much. I was given a room on the 36th floor facing east and north. The scenery is my favorite. You can have a panoramic view of all the landmark buildings in Lujiazui (Oriental Pearl Tower, Three-piece Suite, etc.), and the night view and sunrise are amazing! The breakfast on the first floor has many things and is rich. The revolving restaurant on the 45th floor is great, with a much higher viewing angle than the guest room floor. The hotel was renovated in 2018, but the interior decoration of the hotel is still very old-fashioned. I personally don't like this decoration style. The executive lounge was a bit disappointing. In the evening, the lady carefully brought fruits and drinks, but the buffet food had very little variety. The morning was even more interesting. I went there at 8:00, and there was no one in the executive lounge. There was only a breakfast buffet that had been there for who knows how long, and a TV that played English programs softly. The sun shone in through the window, and the a**osphere was full. It feels weird. Finally, we went to the 1st floor for breakfast.

He was warm, friendly, patient, and responsible. Even after get off work, he was very caring and actively helped to follow up. He communicated and provided business guidance directly with the other party many times with his skilled professional knowledge, and finally provided timely services.

Advantages: Very large, very quiet, and excellent sound insulation!
shortcoming:
1. No windows,
2. It‚Äôs cold. The air conditioner was turned on all night and the temperature was only 16 degrees! Moreover, the air outlet is facing the bed, so there is a cold wind at night!
3. The equipment is very old and quite old. There are no plugs at the bedside to charge mobile phones, and the audio equipment on the bedside table still has the same interface as 10 years ago. It is better to remove this kind of equipment.
4. The TV is very old and I have no desire to turn it on. There are not many international channels!
5. The breakfast was so bad, it was the first time I had such a bad breakfast in a 5-star hotel! There seem to be a lot of styles, but none of them look appetizing. The noodles at the noodle stall and the soup base for the wontons were too average. There was a homemade yogurt, but I picked it up and put it in a thin layer in a huge bowl. I didn‚Äôt know it but thought it was someone else‚Äôs leftovers. It‚Äôs incredible!

It was extremely cold at around 2 o'clock in the night, and I couldn't find a second quilt. I called dutymanager to arrange a quilt and electric heater for me. Calling room service never gets through.
After turning on the heater, the room started to warm up and I could sleep. However, the next day I started to have a stuffy nose and felt drowsy because I didn't sleep well, which affected my work the next day. The customer thought I had a cold and asked me if I had a fever. In the attached photo, you can see that the temperature in the room was less than 20 degrees. The next day I went downstairs to the front desk to complain. The manager explained to me that the sudden drop in temperature had not caused the heat to rise from the ground floor. Let me ask you, does your hotel use a coal stove for heating? Does it have to be heated slowly from the ground floor to the upper floors? I stayed for two nights and checked out on the third day. The temperature in the small study room of the suite was still less than 20 degrees. Fortunately, there is an electric heater in the bedroom, so sleeping is no problem.

This hotel is located near New World Mall. Although it is very easy to find, because I never noticed it when I passed by it before, its presence is not as big as other five-star and luxury hotels.
You can stay in his suite for the price of a regular room in other high-end hotels, which is not very cost-effective at this location and time. Although the hotel facilities and equipment are a bit old, they are still very well maintained. Maybe it's because it has always been positioned as a foreign-related hotel, and there are a lot of foreigners here. The breakfast is amazing, with a lot of Chinese dishes, which can satisfy Chinese stomachs and also allow foreign friends to taste the deliciousness of Chinese food.

I just received a call to ask. Boxed breakfast Because in the morning I had to leave at 6 a.m. and the person answering the phone spoke in an annoyed way. Sigh again.

As for the room, it is considered clean. But there aren't many amenities (it's in a Superior room). The coffee at the bar is a normal Nescafe bag on the 33rd floor, but there's a smell of cigarette smoke floating in. What does that mean?
Breakfast is very basic. Not worth over a hundred yuan.

The location is at the head of People's Square Road, next to the large depar**ent store New World and Madame Cuso (can walk through).

If I give it another go, I won't go. Not worth it

However, the front desk staff solved the problem as soon as possible and changed the room, which is very commendable. All the facilities in the room are complete. Although the hotel has been built for many years and was renovated a few years ago, it is not old-fashioned at all. Moreover, the location is very close to the exit of People's Square Subway Station. You can also go to Nanjing Pedestrian Street through the tunnel entrance opposite Exit 7 of People's Square Subway Station without having to cross the road, which is very convenient. The hotel's breakfast buffet has a wide variety of food, both Chinese and Western. The boiled ramen is delicious, and the pan-fried pumpkin pancake stuffed with red bean paste is one of my favorite foods.

I checked in late on the first day, and there were only rooms with old-style decoration on the lower floors. Most of the windows faced the wall.
The next day, I went to the front desk lady to help adjust the room. I would like to especially praise Cathy. She is patient, meticulous and thoughtful.
I said I hoped to have a room with a view of the sunrise, and I was immediately assigned to a room on the 2201st floor that could overlook the Bund and the three-piece suite.
I have stayed in the hotel many times, and she was the first service staff to let me know that the 20th floor and above are all decorated in a modern style. She also explained thoughtfully that the hotel has a large passenger flow. The same price and room type, but the room may be on a larger floor and decoration style. reason.

The hotel's breakfast has both Chinese and Western options, with a variety of choices. You can directly overlook Nanjing West Road and People's Park. I especially like to go early and choose a seat by the window to enjoy the scenery while eating.
I will stay at Radisson Blu next time and share some pictures of the hotel.

Remember to make a reservation a few days in advance for the revolving restaurant on the 45th floor.

However, there is no hand-held shower in the bathroom, so children cannot take a bath, and the water pressure is very low. Taking a bath feels very strenuous. A five-star hotel shouldn't be so picky, so I changed hotels after staying for two days. The TV is older and cannot cast the screen.

One small point is that the parking lot is the New World Parking Building known as the "Shanghai Hell Parking Lot", which is a test of driving skills...
When I left, the hotel gave me a parking coupon. I thought it was for free parking. When I left the parking lot, I was told that it was a coupon for 40% off the parking fee...

After comparing various sources on the platform, I chose the Radisson Blu New World based on its location and cost-effectiveness. Facts have proved that this is a very correct choice! On the day of arrival, Cathy and Lynn at the front desk received the check-in. They were very professional and caring, because some children specially upgraded the 34th floor luxury business suite, and the invincible view is amazing! The 60-square-meter suite has two bathrooms. The room is spacious and bright, and the basic facilities are complete. The special capsule coffee machine is also immediately satisfied. The children's toiletries are specially provided. The cleaning is timely, and the room depar**ent can also meet various small requirements. The breakfast is rich, because there are many foreign guests, and the food is more Western-style, but there are also local specialties such as freshly cooked noodles and wontons. Outside the window is the green trees of People's Square Park, which satisfy both adults and children. Needless to say, the location is just across Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street from People's Square, and next to New World Depar**ent Store. It's really convenient for traveling! It must be strongly praised, and I will definitely choose Radisson Blu Hotel New World again!

The hotel is located in the center of Shanghai - People's Square, with an excellent location. From the hotel's garden view room, you can overlook the green People's Square, which is very eye-catching. In addition, there is a red double-decker Big Bus starting station at the door. It is a unique experience to visit Shanghai on a sunny day. Of course, for ladies who love shopping This is also the best choice, because the hotel lobby level is directly connected to the New World Depar**ent Store, so you can buy, buy, eat, play, and have everything. In addition, Nanjing West Road is only 100 meters away from the hotel. In addition, Nanjing West Road is the Bund at the end, which also ensures that you will have a great time shopping, eating, and playing.

Although the hotel is a bit old, and compared to the newly opened five-star hotels in recent years, the hardware is indeed a little inferior, but the design and decoration are not out of date so far. From the software point of view, the waiters are all friendly, and Foreign employees serve in the lobby and restaurant, and the hotel is also staffed by Virgin Atlantic airlines, which fully demonstrates the high degree of internationalization of the hotel.

The hotel's breakfast is absolutely rich, and has everything you should expect from a five-star hotel. It also provides a variety of cheese to choose from. My favorite is its noodles, and the toppings of pickled vegetables and shredded pork are really fresh!

Worth! Worth! Worth!

The hotel facilities are a bit old. The room we booked is 80 square meters and has a living room to receive guests. There will be welcome fruits, oranges üçä and bananas üçå of good quality.
The bathroom mirrorsü™ûare all electrically heated, making the bathroom warm. The shower head has a fixed height, but the water outlet is not very friendly. Water stains seriously block the outlet holes, and the water temperature is unstable during peak bathing hours.
The bedroom is large in size and faces southeast, with direct sunlight from morning to noon. The indoor air conditioner is overheated, which is not very friendly to friends from the south who like ventilation. The large glass windows cannot be opened. It is very hot in the room when the air conditioner is turned on. When the air conditioner is turned off, there is no air circulation and the room feels stuffy. The air conditioner is locked and can only turn on heating but not ventilation.
Overall evaluation, in this location, the price still has some advantages. The hotel service is also good. There are no tea bags or coffee in the room. I guess you can get them by asking the front desk.

But the garden view suite I booked did not have a garden view, and the price of the city view room is different. When I just checked in and had a lunch break, the doorbell rang and I asked if the room had been cleaned? Didn't you confirm it when you handed over the room? At eight o'clock the next morning, the waiter rang the doorbell again and told me that a bottle of water was missing from the room, but in fact it was not missing and I didn't let it be delivered...
Breakfast coffee can be taken away, which is good.

In this case, they take a deposit of 1500 yuan. For what?!!! They cleaned up cleanly, but this did not save the general feeling of being killed. The bathroom smelled damp.

The view was very good. The room was neither big nor small. It was quite satisfactory. The equipment was a bit old. The first time I was on the 7th floor, I felt very strange as soon as I got off the elevator. There were bursts of wind in the elevator room. The hotel corridor was circular, with poor visibility and dim lighting. The room is a small suite. As soon as you enter the door, you will see an irregular-shaped study room with a pair of Peking Opera facial makeup full of staring eyes hanging on the wall? painting, that painting is facing the bed inside. The door requires a strong click to lock. The kids and husband both said it was so scary after the first night that they didn't want to stay. It is recommended that everyone choose a higher floor when booking this hotel.

It's a pity that the shower is fixed and inconvenient!

shortcoming:
1 The common problem of old hotels is that the room facilities are slightly outdated. Of the four bottles of mineral water provided for free on the bar counter, it was found that one bottle had obviously been opened and had been taken a few sips, but I didn‚Äôt see it during the ward round, what a pity!
1 For breakfast, ask the master to fry eggs on one side. The new apprentices can‚Äôt understand it. Fortunately, the master chef appeared on the spot to teach [naughty]

You can arrange the room card first and put the suitcase in it. Fortunately, the consignment depar**ent took it in. I went out to find a friend for business. . When I came back at night, I went to the swimming pool and swam a few laps. The water quality was clean and the water temperature was suitable. It's near the park, and you can run to the Bund in the morning. very nice.

Fortunately, the front desk helped me upgrade to a suite. The most, most, most, most grateful thing is that Jeff helped me transfer to two adjacent suites on the 37th floor the next morning, and I would also like to thank the supervisor Justin.

When we came back after waiting for more than an hour, the room was not tidied up. We were asked to wait at the front desk without a single apology or any follow-up explanation. The hotel facilities are also very old and rough. They are basically at the level of an express hotel. They are very poor and will not come back again.

msg:The negative review of this stay was recorded at the check-out site, and my relevant complaints were not properly reviewed.
1. There are only two service staff in line at the front desk when entering and exiting. How can the shift schedule be calculated based on the occupancy rate of the day? There has been no improvement after previous comments.
2. We have arranged 2912 rooms. We are all regular customers who have stayed there more than 20 times. Why would you arrange the smelliest room in the hotel? Many rooms have smells, but the strong smell hits your nostrils as soon as you open the door.
3. What does it mean that your waiter came in after ringing the doorbell at 10:30 the next morning? Is it fun for me to stare at you without any clothes on? I have adjusted my own monitoring and figured out how to deal with it. What if the host and guest are girls?
4. The flushing water in the hotel toilet is broken. You have to lift it up hard, otherwise it will keep flowing.
5. Hot and cold water in bathing is also a common problem.
6 Keep urging you to check out? Then why didn't you tell me to check out at 12 o'clock when you checked in? It's funny that I checked in more than 20 times before, but no one came to remind me? When the epidemic subsides, will you forget about the people who supported your business during difficult times? As a person, you must know how to be grateful, and this is especially true in management. Short-sightedness will only make you smaller.
These will also be complained to Ctrip customer service. How can we cultivate merchants on the platform? I really don‚Äôt see any other hope except that the location is convenient for business trips.

But I have to mention the bad points. After all, I dispelled a lot of good impressions above: the facilities are a bit old, the room will accumulate water in the shower, and I can‚Äôt do it overnight, and I can‚Äôt bring my own plastic slippers; I received it inexplicably the next day Minibar consumption orders, and customer service reflected that there may be mistakes in the minibar, and I also emphasized it to the staff when I checked out. In the end, the deposit was deducted without any explanation or contact. The experience was extremely poor.

msg:For the New World Radisson Blu, it is more appropriate to use the evaluation of "love at first sight, goodbye as before", and it is the most comfortable, comfortable and convenient hotel I have stayed in Shanghai so far.

‚òÖComprehensive recommendation: When I checked in at the front desk, I met Justin, a warm, cheerful and careful manager. Since I brought my parents and children here this time, Justin made a very considerate and thoughtful arrangement, and the whole family was super satisfied. Whenever I come to Shanghai in the future, I will definitely continue to choose this place.

‚ôõExperience time: At the beginning of March, the first wave of warming up, I brought my parents and children to Shanghai as a family of five. I stayed in four hotels during the whole journey, and the New World Radisson is the comprehensive No.1.

‚óèTransportation: Recommended with full marks, the subway station People‚Äôs Square and Nanjing Road are just downstairs, and across the road is my son‚Äôs favorite m&m chocolate, several shopping malls including New World Depar**ent Store and No. 1 Depar**ent Store. There are many delicious foods. Radisson Blu New World is the most convenient place to live and go, without any shortcomings.

‚óÜEnvironment: The maintenance is very good, although it is not very luxurious, or the appearance of Lujiazui is high-end, but it is very warm everywhere, everything is just right, simple and generous, low-key and heavy. The rooms are also very good. There are rooms facing the Oriental Pearl Tower. The swimming pool has a transparent glass roof, and the afternoon sun shines down, which is very pleasant.

‚óãFood: The breakfast is very rich. According to everyone‚Äôs comments, the Chinese restaurant is great, but there are too many delicious ones on Nanjing Road, so I didn‚Äôt experience it this time.

‚ñ†Service: I brought my parents to Shanghai. I stayed at the Pudong Regent the day before. The service was unbearably cold. Fortunately, I only booked one night at the Regent. After moving to the New World Radisson, all the haze was swept away. null. All the service staff are very enthusiastic, especially Justin, who has a cheerful a**osphere and makes everyone feel very comfortable.

‚ô•Cost-effective: Treasure-level recommendation, the first choice when coming to Shanghai in the future. Thanks again to Justin and his colleagues for their considerate service. I wish Radisson Blu New World better and better. See you soon!

When we woke up, we found a huge roar in the living room, the glass was vibrating, and it was still ringing after waiting for more than an hour. I suspected that we were assigned. Device layer. Then I called and asked to change rooms.
The room is quite large and convenient for traveling.

There is a boss desk that is just convenient for me to work on my laptop, and there is also a bathtub for soaking. Going down from the hotel, there is a passage leading to the 9th floor of New World Shopping Mall without going out. It is very convenient to eat. There is a subway at the door, and what is even more surprising is that after going out, turn right and there is a butterfly cake sold by the International Hotel. Generally, the queue is very long, but it is convenient to live here and you can buy it before closing at 8 pm, so you don't have to wait for a long time.

The lights in the bathroom are turned off at night, but there are still noises. The location of the hotel is good. It's also good to go to the Bund on Nanjing East Road. The service is standard.

The old-fashioned hotels in the central city have maintained a good level of software and hardware, and the high-end suites booked have a wide view and can overlook Lujiazui. More importantly, it is very close to several major museums, within walking distance, convenient and worry-free. By the way, I would also like to praise the hotel swimming pool. The space is open and the water temperature is suitable, especially suitable for children to swim in the water.

It is three kilometers to Shanghai Railway Station, and I will stay here again when I go to Shanghai in the future.

In the information age where our country develops with high-speed network. It is not possible to check in with an electronic ID card. The receptionist at the front desk said that he could only go to the Nanjing Road Police Station and apply for an ID card to check in. Run the hotel right by how regulated it is. After 8:30 in the evening, I took a taxi to the police station... ~ After finishing the formalities and checking in, the front desk clerk refuted my complaint. "You can complain because he answered the phone. So arrogant!!" The hotel's standardized management comes from some irrationality of the hotel itself. Toothbrushes are not provided. This kind of service matching is really not suitable for a place with such an international face on Nanjing Road. All kinds of international flight friends shuttle in this hotel. The service to Chinese people is that bad. Amazing, amazing! "A Tale of Ice Cream" comes to mind.

Arriving at ten o'clock in the evening, the four front desk staff got together, and no one paid any attention to check in. I asked: Can the four of you handle it separately? I have been waiting for a while. One of the girls didn't even look at me, and said angrily: We are changing shifts, I will hand them over to the two of them now and we will get off work. Okay, do you want to be so angry before get off work?
I called the guest room and asked: Is there any extra single quilt, there is no one for children in the room. The customer service said: There is no single person, they are all the same. Then it just hangs up with a bang. Is this me interrupting your rest? Hang up without saying a word.
The suite I stayed in this time is large in size and has two bathrooms, which is very suitable for families. But the roof noise in the living room is very loud. I wonder if it is the air conditioner or the computer room upstairs? It's a pity that such a good office location. The bedroom is relatively quiet and does not affect rest.

After staying for 2 days, when I had breakfast the next morning When I swiped the room card, there was no one there. I shouted, "Is there someone there?" No one paid attention to me, so I took my child in. Then a man ran out from behind and told me to swipe the room card. I said, "You're not there." I shouted, but no one was there. Reason, the man said that he had to swipe the room card even if he was not here, and his tone was not good. I don‚Äôt know if I was too pretentious or something else.

At that time, the front desk had been operating with the computer for a long time, and told us that the two orders were all done. It has been merged; as a result, on the second-to-last day, the room card could no longer enter the room, and I went to the front desk to negotiate again, because the two orders were not merged. This experience was very bad. If we didn‚Äôt inform the hotel, it would be understandable.

Some of the staff at the front desk have a good attitude, while others are a bit sloppy.

msg:Bringing children during the Spring Festival, it‚Äôs really not good to live in Atour first, so I moved the station, gave it a try, chose to stay for one night first, and fell in love with it, staying for 3 nights in a row, it is worth recommending. The location of the hotel is very good. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel. You can take a double-decker sightseeing bus here. You can walk to the subway station in 3 minutes. The hotel is connected to New World Depar**ent Store. Madame Tussauds is on the upper floor of New World. Nanjing Road is just It is very convenient to go shopping at the opposite door. Let‚Äôs talk about the room. Compared with the newly built hotels in the past few years, the hotel facilities may be a little less technological, but the overall maintenance is still in place, clean and hygienic. Through a few small things, I felt the hotel's attentiveness and meticulous service. On the first day, the floor I lived in was relatively low, and I didn't pay attention when I came back after going out to play. I continued to stay the next day. Although the housing supply was tight during the Spring Festival, the front desk offered to suggest changing rooms for us so that we could see a better night view of Shanghai. When I returned to the hotel in the evening, I found that the room outside the elevator door was open and I could see the Oriental Pearl Tower. The night view was magnificent. At that time, I thought it was because the waiter forgot to close the door after cleaning. I sneaked in and took a look and came out quickly. I passed by after a while and found that the door was still open. It was open, and it happened that a waiter passed by and asked. In order to facilitate the guests to enjoy the best night view, the hotel specially selected the best viewing room for opening. This is the exquisite service! There is a location, there is a trustworthy price ratio, and there are services worth recommending.

msg:shortcoming:
1. The hotel room is relatively old and damp. The carpet in the room is fluffy and smells after being left for too long. Even after leaving the window open for two days, it still doesn't work.
2. The design of the hotel room layout is unreasonable. There is a living room at the entrance, which is too small and cannot be used for activities. Because it is separated from the bedroom, the bedroom and the living room are very compact and cannot be used for activities, so the design of the living room is relatively useless.
3. I booked a twin room and was given a double room. I called the switchboard 4 times and no one answered the phone when I went to the front desk. In the end, I had to go downstairs and change rooms. Later, when I called, I found that it was difficult to get through to the front desk.
4. I didn‚Äôt expect that a bottle of water would cost 50 yuan.
advantage:
1. It is very close to the subway station and convenient to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street.
2. The hotel lobby is quite beautiful.

It is very close to Nanjing East Road and the Bund. The hotel is next to New World City, and the internal passage can be passed. It is super convenient for shopping and eating. The subway entrance is also within easy reach. Line 1.2.8 is available. It is only 3 stops away from Shanghai Railway Station. It is really super convenient.

msg:Let me start by saying that the location is good, the hotel facilities are a bit old, the sanitation is basically OK, and the breakfast is rich. The hotel stipulates check-out at 12 o'clock and check-in at 3 p.m. If you check in at 3 o'clock, you may not be able to check in. The front desk will tell you to clean, and you have to clean the room. The biggest problem is the hotel deposit. Many hotels now do not charge deposits, and the room fee has already been paid on the booking platform. I checked into the hotel on July 3rd and received a 500 deposit. I checked out on the morning of July 4th. The hotel told me that it was OK and they would refund the money immediately. On July 9th, I accidentally checked Alipay and there was no refund of the deposit. I called the front desk to question. A woman was very rude and perfunctory. She said that it was the responsibility of the finance depar**ent and that she had to go to the finance office to find the accountant and so on before she would answer me. , if you have no choice, just wait. As a result, the deposit was refunded in seconds before the call ended. What's this? If you don't ask, you won't withdraw. If you ask, you will withdraw immediately. Remind everyone who paid a deposit to see if it has been refunded to youüòä

msg:1. There are many tenants on Saturdays and there are long queues. There are only two staff at the front desk, and the efficiency is slow and the queues take a long time.
2. The order was written to check in at 3pm. I arrived at 4pm and told me that the room was not cleaned yet. Please let me come back in half an hour to get the room card. I went to have afternoon tea and then lined up at the front desk at 5pm and told me that the room was still not cleaned. Please let me know. I left my phone number and said they would notify me as soon as possible.
3. When they still didn‚Äôt call me at 6 o‚Äôclock, I called the front desk to ask. The front desk directly transferred the call to room service. The room service said to ask the cleaning staff, and then hung up directly, blaming each other.
I went to the front desk at a little after 4.6 o'clock and asked, and they said it was ready, but didn't they say they would call me as soon as possible?
5. The check-in time was delayed for 3 hours without an apology let alone compensation. Is this the attitude and work efficiency of a 5-star hotel?

Collaboration and communication skills among employees need to be improved, just like different companies in a hotel are independent of each other. It‚Äôs understandable that you are busy on Saturdays and Sundays, but should you let consumers and customers understand you? What's more, there was no apology or compensation, and the guest was made to wait for 3 hours to check in because the room was not cleaned properly? Unheard of, won't come again

1. Although the location is good, the attitude of the service staff is poor
First of all, it took nearly 40 minutes to check in, and I stayed in the hotel until 3:40 in line;
2. The attitude of the service staff in the concierge depar**ent is very bad. Although I lost the luggage tag, I copied the copy of the ID card without the permission of the guest and asked us to sign it;
3. I called the mayor's hotline later, but I didn't expect this hotel to be reduced to this level. I won't come again next time. The Holiday Inn diagonally opposite is much better than this one. I strongly don't recommend everyone to come! ! ! Avoid pits! ! !

I said I wanted a higher room, so he arranged it for me. In the small suite with city view on the 37th floor, a cup of coffee voucher from the hotel's coffee garden is also given for check-in. A little surprise! I added WeChat and said that you can contact him if you have any questions during your stay. I feel that the front desk service has been upgraded to the butler service of a diamond-level hotel, and the auntie in the room service is also very warm and friendly! So I chose to stay another day the next day! However, the hardware facilities of the hotel are still a bit old, and there is no doorman or concierge service in the lobby, which is a bit below the standard of a five-star hotel! Fortunately, combined with the location and price, it should be regarded as a five-star hotel with relatively high cost performance!

Recently, I stayed at the Radisson Hotel New World for one night. I was very impressed with the dining, especially the buffet dinner at the coffee garden.

There are a wide variety of dishes, and the service is attentive and thoughtful. Each person has two hairy crabs. The crab roe is thick and plump, and the meat is delicious and tender. You can eat oysters, seafood, Chinese hot and cold dishes, etc. The taste is rich and thrifty.

The breakfast is also rich and colorful, with good color and taste.

The Xuanjing restaurant on the 45th floor also saw a different scenery.

The location here is superior, and it is an excellent place to rest in the midst of hustle and bustle!

We also arranged a room for us across the street looking at the opposite mall, and the elevator is located outside the room. There is no view below the 15th floor of the street view room of this hotel, so don't be fooled by the window view photos. The customer service of those hotels may be busy during the National Day, so there is no smile on their faces, and they don't say a word. During the National Day, the main road outside the hotel was also closed at certain times, making it inconvenient to take a taxi, and the subway entrance was also closed. It's a big time and a big festival, and the hotel in this location is not easy to consider.

After entering, I smelled first. And the interior is very old, so I had to change the big bed on the 19th floor, but I don't want to change it anymore. I go to the minibar to find something to drink. The most basic drinks are charged. Ator, I even get afternoon tea when I book a suite. It's not worth the nearly 900 yuan of accommodation. The room is small, the TV is old, and the bed The head also has no place to charge. I couldn't put the water in the bath tub, and then I asked room service to renovate it. The experience was too bad! The actual check-in does not match the promotional image at all!
I went to have breakfast in the morning, but there were not many people at 7:30. When we left at 8:00, there was already a long line for breakfast, and it was too crowded to get out, hey.
The saddest thing happened. The car was scratched when I left. This narrow alley is narrower than the corner of the stairs at home, and there is actually a seventh floor. It‚Äôs okay to scratch. When I paid the parking fee, the uncle said that my coupon was not theirs, and I waited for a while to see their research. There is no way I can call the front desk myself, and then they use my mobile phone to research, later There was no apology from the front desk, and I paid 72 yuan for the parking fee even if I had a coupon! commit a sin!

Unexpectedly, my family was very satisfied after three days. On the day of check-in, the handsome guy with Niko's badge at the front desk gave me two luxury suites on the spot to upgrade to the luxury suite on the 38th floor of the high-rise. The layout, views and environment are very good and the corridors are very quiet. Another Justin waiter at the front desk made my 70-year-old mother keep complimenting the service of the old five-star hotel. When he learned that we wanted to replace the senior suite with a city view with a garden view, he personally took the hotel with him when the occupancy was not at peak. We went to see the room first and then decided. Although my mother gave up after reading it, she was not very satisfied, but she was very grateful to him for saving the old man the needless suffering of carrying large and small bags. The room service is also very good. The baby needs drinking water to prepare milk powder. Basically, a call will be delivered soon, even if it is late at night. The taste of the breakfast food is worthy of the price, and the choices are quite rich. During the peak period of 10/1 meal, the waiting time arrangement is very timely, and they will assist in arranging seats with family members. After three days, the family is very satisfied with the service, cost-effectiveness and travel convenience of the old-fashioned five-star hotel, and will consider staying again in the future!

Afterwards, I had to let the hotel operate to give me a refund for the guest. I communicated on Friday and told me that the refund will be available next Monday. I will contact me again on Monday and tell me that it will take 15 days before I can get a refund! ! !

In addition, due to the need for invoicing and the holiday approaching, Justin said that he can provide invoicing information in advance, so that a special ticket can be issued before check-out, which greatly improves the check-out speed.

Under the window is the light show of the beautiful European-style tower in New World City. Opposite the hotel is the beautiful People‚Äôs Park. You can change here by subway. It's very convenient to take the bus. This is the second time I stayed at the Radisson Hotel, and I went to the top-floor revolving sightseeing restaurant for dinner. It felt amazing! It takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes to go around the restaurant to avoid the fatigue of hiking and enjoy the dimly lit night view. It is recommended that you come to the restaurant on weekdays to have ample seats.

There is no welcome fruit and no one to help you with your luggage, not to mention the personal butler. The heated food hall is asked to go to the 45th floor and then to the next floor. The air conditioner in one room was turned on to 30 degrees and I was shivering one night. The temperature couldn't go up at all. The other room turned on 22 degrees and I was sweating and the temperature couldn't go down. There was no coffee machine or breakfast. I personally like to eat small wontons in a row. It‚Äôs not okay if you don‚Äôt have the taste of pasta for two days.

The problem that came to light on the second day was that the room card had expired before the CO time. After going to the 35F Executive Lounge and being processed by the staff, I could still use the elevator to go to the guest room floor but could not enter the room. I asked the front desk for help in sending the room card upstairs. After waiting for more than 15 minutes without seeing any staff, DM-Sunny's explanation for the complaint seemed feeble. Since it was a known problem, why not solve it and put the first responsibility on the new employee? I never thought I would have such a bad experience at CO.

There were no tissue containers on the table in the restaurant, and the table for four only put tableware for two people. I asked a few waiters passing by where the chopsticks were, but they were all deaf and ignored.
After two laps, I really didn't want to eat, and finally eat a 2 yuan tea egg to satisfy my hunger. 300 yuan for breakfast is a lesson, next to New World City, Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, 300 yuan is better than this! As a star hotel in a landmark location in Shanghai, the room rate of more than 800 is such a service standard, which is too detrimental to the image of Shanghai!

The fly in the oin**ent is that there are not many varieties of breakfast. Others are very good and worth recommending!

msg:Staying for four days and three nights, the overall accommodation facilities exceeded expectations. I brought a child and an extra bed, and it was not very crowded. This time, if you live on the 31st floor, you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower a few stops away. It is located on the west side of Nanjing Road. It is also very close to the World Trade Center. It is very convenient to walk around. Turn around in 2 hours; there is a nucleic acid testing booth downstairs, and the normalized detection of the epidemic is also very convenient. When you go out and wait for the bus, you will do nucleic acid; the International Hotel next to it has opened a cake shop on the side of the alley. Butterfly cake is very delicious, I suggest to try it, and my brother said that the International Hotel was a landmark in the center of Shanghai in the past, so we lived next to us and lived in the center to see Shanghai; there is a city next to the nucleic acid testing booth downstairs On the up and down points of the sightseeing line, I took a double-decker bus to visit some scenic spots. You can get on and off at any time. It is valid within one day. The fare seems to be 30. My understanding is that the bus goes directly to the scenic spot. 30 is a one-day pass. Is it appropriate? It's a matter of opinion, the peace of mind is true... Whether it is the hotel or the staff I met along the way, they are still enthusiastic, so I really have a leisurely time, and I don't feel tired because of the journey.

I bought pizza outside and came back for extra meals. The restaurant can also help to heat it up, and the service attitude is really good, not arrogant or arrogant. I can feel that everyone has a good understanding of their own work, so I will have a chance next time. If you go to Shanghai, you still have to live here.

The only small regret: I came back to take a nap one day at noon, and the door was opened from the outside. I was still a little dazed when I was half asleep, and then I heard the voice of "Hey, I'm sorry". It turned out to be the cleaning auntie. It's understandable, but I still can't accept the fact that someone opened the door without even calling to confirm whether someone is there. He said that he would clean up later, but I guess the aunt was not very happy to be told how to do things. I seem to see the aunt's eyes are obviously unhappy, but I have no evidence to prove it.

So I pressed the "clean up now" button before going out at about 4 pm, thinking that it was a response to the cleaning time at noon. When I came back at about 10 pm and found that the house was not cleaned, the button was still on, and I called now. The front desk asked someone to collect garbage and change towels, and the mood was still somewhat affected.

msg:Every time I stayed in the past, I thought it was pretty good. The environment and facilities are relatively old. The most important thing is that I met the person who claimed to be the manager on duty on January 24, 2023. He had a bad attitude. Yesterday, he reported the room for repair. The maintenance personnel of the hotel said that it could not be repaired temporarily and changed to another room for washing. After a while, the person called the manager on duty called our two rooms and said that someone was sleeping in the temporary washing room... The attitude is bad, let us not occupy the two rooms Hurry up and let them sell one, and let the children not sleep in the room! Isn't it kind of funny that we're going to put the kids to bed again? We just wanted to find a normal room to wash and did not sleep in another room for washing. The so-called manager on duty questioned us with a bad attitude? It's extremely bad, and they said they won't charge us to clean the room? How can you be a duty manager by dealing with problems like this? May I ask how your speaking attitude is suitable for this hotel? The recording should be sent to everyone to hear how arrogant you are speaking today! Impressive! Who gave you the right to treat customers like this!

msg:I have stayed in the hotel so many times and it has always received five-star praise. I have never given a low score, but this time I really want to talk about it. I was very happy to stay in the hotel at the beginning. After all, I took the whole family out to play. The location of the hotel is okay, and the price is high, but the attitude of the service staff is really unacceptable. The lobby is okay, and the breakfast restaurant has egg pancakes and noodles. The attitude of the two service staff is really not flattering. One is that they love to talk to each other and get impatient before asking a few questions. The other is that they worship foreigners. I stood in front of the egg pancake stand and asked if there was any, and said no directly. I haven‚Äôt come to a foreigner, so I started to make it directly. What era is it now? The following noodles are bullying and fearing hard, because the soup is gone. They asked me to pick up boiling water for the soup, and I endured it. Where is the warm water? , just impatiently said that it is enough to go straight. I stared and stopped talking. Is this how you treat guests in a five-star hotel? I have been to so many places in China, big and small, and I feel like this place in Shanghai A small number of people worship foreigners, bully the weak and fear the strong, and are arrogant. They always feel that other places are in the countryside. If there is any impatience, I will continue to complain. I really regret not taking a photo of these two.

msg:During the Spring Festival this year, I can't go out to Shanghai, so I can only choose to spend the festival in the city. After much deliberation, go to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street to feel the festive a**osphere. After comparing and choosing on Ctrip for a long time, I found that this long-sought hotel Ctrip also has a two-night package, so I am happy to go.
üöó Transportation:
It is very convenient. It is just at the exit of People's Square Station of the subway. If you don't go to the ground, you can navigate the New World City completely according to the underground passage.
üßπHygiene:
Old-fashioned five-star hotel, the sanitation is naturally good, the room is very clean, but the facilities are a bit old, the room carpet, door lock and so on, some damaged.
üçÉ Environment:
The lobby is not very good, and it is a little messy. It may be near Nanjing Road, and it is a New World City commercial building. The flow of people is very large and it is a bit noisy. Especially the dining environment of the coffee garden on the first floor is really bad.
üîîService:
This time we chose the two-night small suite package, which included one night's buffet dinner for two, and booked it in advance, but there were still problems with the meal that night. One was that the reserved seat was not reserved, and the second was that there was no room for dinner at six o'clock. What can be eaten, obviously the store is not ready to deal with the peak passenger flow during the holidays. After negotiation, we could only give up the meal that night and use the relevant rights and interests on another day, but it had an impact on our original itinerary.
Room:
The exquisite small suite is actually very tasteless, because the building is a circular factor, and many rooms in the hotel are fan-shaped, so the so-called suite is to put the tables, chairs and sofas originally placed in the rectangular room into the semi-circular arc. Since one of the originally scheduled two small suites has always had a sewer smell, the store owner finally helped me upgrade a family suite, which finally made up for a lot of regrets, which is also worthy of praise.
Overall, the location of the hotel is very good, the transportation is convenient, and the brand image of Radisson is also good. If the price is reasonable, it is recommended to stay.

Forget it if you don‚Äôt accept cash, what does it mean to ask the waiter to empty the small refrigerator because you didn‚Äôt use your mobile phone to pay the deposit? ? I'm curious about what kind of front desk your hotel uses**.

msg:The hotel is old and reasonable, but on the first night there was a leak from the ceiling above the bathtub. I was forced to change rooms on the second night, and the food and beverage received a bad review. The watermelon juice was sour, so I asked the waiter to change it. It was still sour. The waiter took a sip of it. The customer vomited immediately and even accidentally took two sips. He was speechless and the overall service of the hotel was not good. He was indifferent and indifferent if nothing happened. If something happened, he immediately changed his face and was enthusiastic. This is not the service status of Hong Kong brands.

msg:Old-fashioned five-star hotel, I can't go out on vacation. I accidentally found that the swimming pool temperature of this hotel is 2-4 degrees higher than other hotels. It's really great. It is very suitable for children to swim and play in the winter. So I walked away and bought a set meal with dinner buffet. But the buffet dinner is really indescribable (it claims to be a buffet with a price of more than 300 per person for non-hotel guests. It is too bad. All in all, the ingredients are not fresh and make do with it. For example, steamed oysters with garlic, fried pomfret, etc. Hot pot is also It's the basic model, you can eat whatever you want, no requirements, no problem)
Hygiene: The overall hygiene is good, but one of our beds was full of small pieces of hair, and I lost my mood all of a sudden. The back is the hotel to quickly solve the problem, and forget it. My daughter is allergic, so we all bring a blanket with or without hair.
Environment: I don't have to say this, downstairs is People's Square, Nanjing East Road, what you want!
Service: mediocre. 5 star review
Facilities: After all, it's an old-fashioned hotel, and the facilities are a little outdated, but at such a beautiful price, as long as the hygiene and service are online, others can be ignored. However, my husband fell asleep in the sauna roomüò≠üò≠üò≠, the injury is not clear, it is not a scratch, the wound is deep, and I almost hurt my eyes. Everyone must be careful about slipping. The hotel didn't do anything other than two Band-Aids, which is a bit disappointing.
Will come again next time, just for your swimming pool.

The Radisson Blu Hotel, New World, booked on Ctrip for 3 days and 2 nights, is located one road from the pedestrian street in the city center, not far from Yu Garden, and not until 2 or 2 o'clock in the new year. I waited for a while at the peak of check-in, the receptionist was not bad and gave a 31st floor with a good view, the package includes breakfast and two buffet dinners, and the 45th floor revolving restaurant experience coupon was given, and the peak was passed at 8:30 the next day. There are few people in the restaurant, and the scenery on both sides of the Pujiang River is so beautiful. It can be considered for family dinners in the future. A recommended hotel is good

The location of this hotel is very good, next to the New World Depar**ent Store. The hotel has a direct connecting door, which is very convenient. I am very fortunate to book this hotel and I am very happy for the New Year. There is also the scenery outside the window where you can see the Oriental Pearl and the three-piece suit, which is very beautiful at night.

The house is old, but it is clean and tidy, and it has been upgraded to a junior suite with a jacuzzi. I am very satisfied. The only thing is the variety of breakfast. If it is less, it may be that the occupancy rate is not high during the epidemic to save costs. Overall, the price of more than 600 is still very cost-effective, and it is a good choice for home travel. In addition, the opposite is the nucleic acid point, which is very convenient. Hotel service is good, especially Faye and Anne. Will consider here on my next trip.

üöó Transportation: The transportation is very convenient. It is good to get out of People's Square Station of Metro Line 1 and Line 8, and it is only about 2 kilometers to walk to the Bund.

üçÉEnvironment: The room is small and comfortable, and it is very comfortable to be alone. The window has a good view and there is no obstruction. On Nanjing Road, what can I say, shopping is super convenient, go out and turn right at the International Hotel Butterfly Crisp, turn left on Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, there are all kinds of old brands üëç

üîîService: The waiters from the front desk to the restaurant are very friendly. For these meal coupons, the front desk patiently explained clearly and did their best.

Having said that, there are not many choices for the buffet breakfast, and the dinner is even less delicious. Although there is meat, the blood of half-cooked beef and mutton has a meaty smell. It could only eat some dry grilled fish, and it also ended up with the chef sprinkling too much cumin powder and pepper noodles. The small hot pot for dinner has its own characteristics. The waiter will take the initiative to ask if you want it, but the firepower is too small, and you have to wait for a long time to cook an order, so you give up üòÖ

All in all, it's ok, 2 nights accommodation with some meals, not too demanding, can make a living.

üÖøÔ∏è Parking:
Bear the brunt of Tucao! It was my first experience that the hotel did not include parking. I made a phone call and asked the front desk to get a parking coupon, which cost 9 yuan/hour (15 yuan if I didn't stay in the hotel), and then I had to walk...

Location traffic:
This is not to be said! Take Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street to the left, Daguang Cinema to the right... Oh no, West Nanjing Road Taikoo Hui & Jing'an Temple. Downstairs on the Yellow River Road, I never expected to go downstairs three minutes to buy a soft egg cake that is the most cost-effective in Shanghai.

Room Facilities:
I still like the small living room, the built-in basically conforms to the five-star configuration, and it has everything it should have. But the shower doesn't have a hand showerüöø It's not right! This is something I have never encountered before! And it's not acceptable!

swimming pool:
Because I have the right to check out until 14:00, I originally wanted to go after lunch üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, but I ate too much and felt that it was too late to digest and finally I had to give up, which is a pity. I visited in advance and saw that the water depth is 1.2 to 1.8. 1.8 is relatively rare in star-rated hotels. I would like to try it next time. There is a magical point here. When I went to visit in the morning, I casually asked the location of the changing room at the front desk of the swimming pool, and even told me to change my clothes in the room. At that time, when my brain was blocked, I acquiesced [covering my face]. Later, I thought it was wrong. Is there no dressing room? After reading the hotel reviews, it is obvious that there are, so what is the operation of this wave of answers? I didn't express clearly. The concubine said that he did not understand


Serve:
The switchboard is never answered, everything else is fine.

Cost-effective:
For less than 600 yuan, what kind of bike do you really want in this location?

Our family suite is more than 100 square meters, 2 bedrooms, a hall, a water bar and a large dining table for 8 people in the hall, which is more in line with the needs of our script. The bedroom windows are fully enclosed, but the view is particularly good. I can see the Raffles Street, the room is under the sign of New World, and the price is relatively affordable, but the room facilities are relatively outdated, all family suites are on the top floor, so it is relatively quiet, the breakfast area is also very nice, and many foreigners stay This hotel.

Perhaps due to the impact of the epidemic, the level of food and beverages has dropped significantly. Not only are there fewer varieties, but the quality is also very poor. The salmon is dark red in color. It may be imported from Russia or North Korea. Bacon is made of crushed meat. Many steamed cakes are not visible at first glance.

The scenery outside the window is very good. Facing east, you can see the North Bund and the main buildings of Lujiazui. The scenery outside the window during the day and night is quite shocking. Watching the scenery and drinking tea on the sofa in front of me are very leisurely. I booked in advance at the Rotating View Restaurant on the 45th floor of the hotel to eat western food, and felt the 360-degree view of the city in the magic city. Since the package includes soft drinks at the Starry Sky Bar on the 47th floor, I went there for a while. After a good rest, go to New World downstairs and the nearby Nanjing Road for a stroll. It's really convenient to buy, eat, and eat. Radisson Hotel New World is pretty good.

Just across from Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, downstairs is the New World Shopping Mall and the Wax Museum; we are within walking distance of the Bund, Shanghai Museum, and Cadillac Shanghai Concert Hall; the service attitude of Alisa at the front desk left me with a very sea-like impression, because I brought My parents and aunts played together. They were too busy alone, and they were not familiar with the operation of the Shanghai epidemic. Alisa served with a smile throughout the whole process and was patient and patient, which left a good impression on my Shanghai trip. The view room is also very good, with a large area, separate dry and wet, with bathtub, high water pressure, no common problems of old hotels; you can see the Oriental Pearl and Nanjing Road, and you can also directly access the 42nd floor revolving restaurant and star bar. Since the revolving restaurant needs to be positioned one month in advance, it can only be left in the future. Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio is very high, that is, the buffet breakfast and dinner are relatively poor, which is not so good in the five-star hotels I have stayed in. I hope that I can see improvement next time I stay.

msg:The hotel is located at the intersection of Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street and People's Square, and is a good place to visit Nanjing Road and the Bund. The front desk service attitude is good, we have arranged a twin room on the 11th floor, can see the Shanghai city sunset üåÖ, although the bedroom area is not big, but 1.2 meters of the twin bed is very close, the mattress can be merged with a 2.4 meters of bed with a little movement, a family of three can sleep comfortably, This is very suitable for the needs of parents and children. Book a hotel package and use a drink voucher to go to the 45th floor revolving restaurant to enjoy the night view of Shanghai and enjoy a good time with 360 degree vision. The next morning, we went to the swimming pool on the 8th floor to experience it. The water feels good, clear and transparent, 29‚ÑÉ heated water is very suitable for swimming and fitness. The breakfast variety of the hotel is very rich, and we have buffet dinners including crayfish, seafood and steak. Liping Hotel did not disappoint us and will stay next time we come to Shanghai.

The toilet design is more scientific, the toilet is very clean and feels good to use
üîîService: Breakfast meets mid-to-high-end five-star hotels
Lunch is more average, but it can be compared to the price
The room view is very good, thanks to Connie for the arrangement
However, the Oriental Pearl Tower is still slightly smaller, but all three-piece suits can be seen. There is no problem with the price/performance ratio.
üöó Transportation: Near People's Square Metro Station Exit 7 is less than three minutes walk away and about three minutes from Nanjing Road
üçÉEnvironment: The waiter's enthusiasm is not enough, a bit stiff can be improved
[Fitness room] The swimming pool is small, there is a temperature difference between hot and cold, and there is a glue opening on the ground, and the bottom of the pool is gray
Corresponding to this price is generally good, and there is room for improvement compared with the Hilton at the same price

Basically, they treat the guests as nothing, and just brag and flirt. Is it because the salary is not paid?

The waiter at the front desk was very active and enthusiastic when checking in, and the aunt who cleaned the room was very serious and kind. Hotel parking is chargeable, 72/day, can only take a taxi. The buffet and breakfast included in the package can only be served in the coffee garden. The revolving restaurant on the 45th floor can only be clocked in at your own expense (you must book one day in advance), but thanks to a receptionist at the revolving restaurant for promptly notifying us and arranging a window seat after someone canceled the reservation. The set meal also sent 2 cups of take-out coffee, in fact, don't send it, the quality is too bad, there is no coffee taste at all, and 2 disposable cups are wasted. In addition, the other waiters are just like state-owned enterprises, and they are not friendly at all. The starry sky bar is also very general, not as good as the revolving restaurant. Nice swimming pool and sauna. Shanghai people living in Shanghai hotels always feel that the service needs to be improved

msg:At that time, I chose the hotel to stay close to the outside world, so I chose the Radisson Hotel. This staying experience made me very disappointed. I did not feel the service after staying at this hotel as a guest. After I checked in that day, I found a problem and called the switchboard. Wait for one. No one came when they were young, so I called them a second time and transferred the call to other places.
1. The room is not equipped with a small square. Is there any reason why you are afraid that the guests will be taken away? It feels like a local hotel, not an international brand hotel, and does not want a metropolitan hotel.
2. Go into the room and find that there is trash left by the last guest in the trash can.
3. The refrigerator is not cooling. It is said that the refrigerator is at a constant temperature. If it is not cold, how to keep the temperature at a constant temperature?
4. The weather in Shanghai was very hot on that day. When I returned to my room to take a shower, the floor could not leak water. Almost all the water overflowed and I couldn't take a shower. Because it is too late that day, I call the service center for repairs, and I will change the room tomorrow;
During the two days I stayed, no hotel staff came to visit me and deal with complaints. All complaints were simply answered after I found them. It was not professional at all. When I came back the next day, I called them and told them to change. The front desk didn't know the room. After reconfirming, I called me to get the key at the front desk. I couldn't feel the service. I changed the room. The handle of the shower room was broken. I dropped to the floor when I took a shower. I left after staying for one day. I considered too much trouble. I continued to live in this hotel. Hey, this is a very unpleasant travel experience.

Ask the waiter to solve the problem, and some look very impatient.

Three days and two nights, the overall experience is still great~ After crossing the road is Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, you can also directly lead to the mall~ The weather is not
When it's good, you can pass directly from the underground of the mall~
There seems to be a swimming pool on the 8th floor~ I saw children holding a swimming ring~ There was no code before~ It's a pity not to bring a swimsuit~
It‚Äôs worth staying in Laimodu with a baby~ It's well connected, and it's close to the places where we checked in~ It's walkable and the subway taxi is not expensive (if you are not afraid of traffic jams)

From entering the hotel to checking out, there is no one to help you carry your luggage or take care of you. I am alone with two babies and two large luggages. When the service staff did not see it, the reception staff at the door pretended not to see it, let alone the inside. Then the man who checked in was also indifferent, he just gave you the card and didn't tell you to go over there. From the elevator, where is the breakfast? Do I owe you the room fee or you? I looked down on our outsiders, and then took the baby to drag the luggage and did the elevator a few times before entering the room smoothly. As soon as I entered the room, a moldy smell came out, and the quilt felt like it could be twisted out of the water, so I called the front desk. After a while, an uncle cleaner came. This is the most patient and smiling person in this hotel. As soon as he entered the door, he explained that it was the weather, and then he took the quilt to me and dried it. Ze Anzhi, she didn't want to toss with her baby anymore. As for the facilities inside, it‚Äôs not convenient to stand in the bathtub and take a shower. Then it‚Äôs not soundproof. You can hear the conversation in the next room at night. You can also hear the toilet upstairs, and what is the picture. Ghost, I saw it as soon as I entered the door, and it was facing the head of the bed. That is to say, when I opened my eyes, I saw countless heads looking at you and sleeping at you. Fortunately, the kids didn't see it, otherwise they must be scared. As for breakfast, we can only say that we are full. We went almost at 10 o'clock in the evening, and many of them were gone, and they would not be added. Anyway, we were full. Finally, the topography of this hotel is still good, the subway is opposite, and there are all shopping nearby. In fact, this has the advantage that the service is not flattering. The hotel management should really manage it, after all, people in big cities It needs more quality to reflect the beauty of this entire city.

On the phone, I heard a conversation with the delivery person, which was unreasonable and had a very bad attitude. We had to rush downstairs to get the food before we were ready. In addition, the security guards were also very confused about the epidemic prevention procedures for entry and exit. Most security guards did not ask for it. Itinerary code and health code, but if there is a security guard, they must provide the code, otherwise they will be blocked at the hotel entrance and not allowed to enter. At least the requirements should be unified internally. I spent money to find anger. It was a speechless stay...

msg:The location is close to the subway and it is convenient to take a taxi. But there may be some traffic jams in People's Square. It takes about half an hour to take a taxi in the morning, midnight and evening for about 4 kilometers on a working day.

The hotel room faces north and there is no sunlight. The room only has 2 small bottles of water (regular brand), the bottles are very small. Surely not enough to drink. Then you need to consume 58 yuan to drink the Evian provided in the room. I think this setting is not suitable for five-star hotels.

The point is that the male waiters wearing glasses and the male lobby managers at the front desk of the hotel are of low quality and attitude, and do not have the professional level of the five-star hotel staff (I don't know if the hotel is recruiting or training problems). The room telephone operator is also perfunctory. Staying here on a business trip is for convenience and worry, not for the inexplicable expression of the waiter who doesn't know where he is from. There are many other options around this price, and I will never go to the level again. Those traveling alone or on business are advised to consider carefully.

msg:On the second day in Shanghai, I chose the New World Radisson Hotel (Because I frequently visit lalaport on the first day, I live in 2 places). Fortunately, the hotel was upgraded to a small suite, and there was a small business suite to enter the bedroom. The small sofa next to the bedroom window is amazing. When the sun shines in the afternoon, it is really peaceful to lie on it. The toilet is separated from wet and dry, and there is also bath salt next to the bathtub. I really want to give a five-star praise üëç

It is suitable for family travel. In the evening, you can walk along Nanjing Road for 20 minutes to the Bund to enjoy the invincible scenery of the Bund, which is very cost-effective.

This is my first time in Shanghai and I have never seen the world. A hotel like this can still be awarded five stars! There is only one fixed shower head in the shower room. It is very troublesome for the child to wash his hair. I can only hold him and wash it with the faucet in the bathtub.

msg:I booked a windowless room. Since I was a member who matched the Hilton Diamond Card, the front desk helped to upgrade the room with windows, 7002. It is on the same floor as the foot massager. Entering the room gives people the feeling of mildew and damp on the carpet. It is estimated that the mattress has completely collapsed after too long. It is recommended not to choose whoever likes a rigid bed. The bathroom is too low, a bathtub with a sense of age, the space is too small, and the water is blocked by the water in the bathtub when taking a bath. It's really indescribable. Of course, the location of this hotel does not say that it is very good next to the New World City and the pedestrian street. It is estimated that the location is superior, the room is not recommended, at least the room type I live in is not recommended. I won‚Äôt comment if I didn‚Äôt eat breakfast.

When I walked in and washed my hands, I saw hair on the towel. I immediately felt uncomfortable. I am very concerned about the hygienic condition of the hotel. Thank you. I called the front desk, and the front desk supervisor brought three towels and changed them. I was very dissatisfied with this solution. The room costing nearly 1,000 yuan was not worth it. I will not come back again.

I will definitely not stay here again in the future, and I will remind my friends and relatives never to stay in a hotel like this without service quality and awareness when going to Shanghai!

msg:Although it is an exquisite small suite, the room is not big. In fact, it is called a small suite because of the partition. If you want a better location, you should go to the front desk and be told that you need to pay more. The most annoying thing is that you will need to pay when other guests check in next time. Special attention must be paid to the insurance when you are in the room and to take your valuables with you when you leave the room, because the waiter will open the door and come in at any time. During my stay, I heard a knock on the door and when I was about to get dressed and open the door, I didn't have time to get dressed. The door to my room had already been opened. I was really angry at the time. When I asked her why, she didn‚Äôt know she had a problem. She said she came to check if the drinks had been used. I wanted to ask why she came to check if she hadn‚Äôt checked out. I shouldn‚Äôt have checked out. Did you just check it? I reported the problem to the front desk, and I was pleased that the front desk's attitude was very good. However, I was asked to have their lobby manager call me back to deal with the results. I have been checking out for a week and there has been no sound. I am really disappointed.

Moreover, I had already taken out the things for my two children, so I was too lazy to change rooms. I endured it. one night. The service was basically non-existent. While the two concierges were chatting in the lobby, I politely asked for directions. They immediately looked cold and pointed in the direction with a wave of their hand. **BoomüëçThe next day I switched to Amy's opposite and experienced what five-star service is.

On the 31st floor, you can have a panoramic view of People's Square. The night view is also beautiful at night. The bed is very comfortable and I sleep soundly.
We took a flight at around 11pm and arrived at the business lounge on the 35th floor at 6pm. There were delicious food and drinks. Adam is definitely a cute and enthusiastic little brother. I recommend him! Thanks!
See you next time on your trip to Shanghai!
