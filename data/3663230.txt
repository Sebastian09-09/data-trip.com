msg:Overall, it was a very comfortable stay. It had a private pool and hot spring. It was great. I could bask in the sun and do some exercise every day. The butler Sky service was very good. One review said that the breakfast was not very tasty although it was very rich. It is suggested that the taste can be improved. Afternoon tea is only given once, I thought it was provided every dayü´¢It would be better if there was a TV in the room, and the TV in the living room would be more first-class if it could have phone projection, and the equipment could be improved.

msg:If you want to stay away from the hustle and bustle and cultivate yourself, then Banling Haiyun Hot Spring Resort Hotel is the best choice. The hotel is full of single-family villas. I booked a 2-bedroom villa. Because it is off-season, the hotel took the initiative to upgrade it to a 3-bedroom villa. The hotel will contact the guests and add the housekeeper WeChat one day before the guests depart to fully understand the guests' needs and preferences so as to prepare in advance. When you arrive at the hotel, the shuttle bus will take the guests to the villa, and the housekeeper will introduce the facilities in the room. The villas all have their own private swimming pools. Unlike other villas, the private swimming pools of this hotel villa are particularly large, and the poolside is equipped with a Banling Tianre Hot Spring Pool. The swimming pool is automatically circulated and filtered, which is relatively clean. There are only a few tidbits floating on the water surface. These tidbits will sink to the bottom of the pool after a while, and the pool maintenance can be ****** away at any time. Talking about the three-bedroom villa, in fact, there are four bedrooms with guest rooms, and the three of us can't live in one room each. The air conditioning in the villa is very good, which is worthy of praise. It cools quickly and has basically no noise. The bathroom experience is also OK. Basically, they are all smart toilets, the bathtub is very new, and there are aromatherapy and sea salt. The villa has its own elevator, which is friendly to knee inconvenience or luggage handling. All electric curtains in the upper and lower living rooms. The guest room linens are comfortable, especially the quilts are light and soft, the mini bar is replenished daily for free, and purified water is unlimited. Because of the off-season, the hotel canceled the self-service and replaced it with meal delivery. Meals are delivered to the kitchen at the agreed time every day, and the table is set up, and the tableware and meals are placed. The breakfast is rich and large, and there is absolutely no problem with fullness. The kitchen has a full set of steamers, ovens, refrigerators and coffee machines. Special thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Liang, who is serious, responsible and experienced. At any time, even in the middle of the night or early in the morning, as long as there is something, WeChat sends him a reply in seconds, which is really touching. I took my parents and three people here to spend a quiet and leisurely week. Although some of the hotel's hardware facilities are old and need to be renovated, the flaws do not cover the merits, and the advantages completely cover the disadvantages. In addition, the three of us felt that the hotel breakfast needs to be improved after a week. The quantity is large, but it is extensive. It is basically the same every day. The ingredients are too popular. Except for poached eggs and lettuce salad, they are basically carbon water. It is full, but the quality is not high. For example, soy milk is basically watery, milk and juice look very cheap, and Chinese dim sum are all frozen foods. Maybe we have higher requirements for breakfast, which only represents our personal feelings.

Sky housekeeper is very warm-hearted. From check-in to the careful preparation of breakfast and airport delivery, he is very careful and serious. He also drove the shuttle bus to take the elderly around the park, patiently explaining while driving. The room type has also been upgraded from two bedrooms to three bedrooms;

The biggest feature of the hotel is the hot spring. The service attitude of the staff is excellent. As long as there is a need, they will come to the hot spring immediately

If you want to experience a slow life, this is definitely the best choice

The hotel butler SKY is also very responsible, from preparing cold drinks to the store and daily breakfast, hot springs, travel, Yachting and play can be arranged immediately, it is really the best choice for coming to Sanya. Before leaving, they were still very enthusiastic about providing drop-off service.

The afternoon tea and fruits were also very good. The pick-up and drop-off service was in place. It is also possible for 7 people to live in a 6-bedroom apar**ent.

msg:The overall feeling is okay, after all, the price/performance ratio is very good. And because of the off-season, they also took the initiative to upgrade me to a three-bedroom apar**ent. There are 2 double-bed rooms and 1 twin-bed room, all with their own private bathrooms, a nanny's room and a shared bathroom, plus 2 living rooms and a kitchen. The outdoor swimming pool and hot spring are enough to accommodate 3 families. The afternoon tea meal ordered was very good. My butler Sun Peng's service is also nice.

But if you go out for fun, don't go back to the hotel in the middle of the night. For example, at 1 o'clock, there is no one at the front desk and there is no shuttle bus. You need to walk to the villa by yourself. Because the hotel is a certain distance from places to visit, including eating, the closest area is the Coconut Dream Corridor area, which takes half an hour one way. To take a taxi, you have to call Didi 10 minutes in advance, so the breakfast is average but you can still eat it.

Because it is an outdoor swimming pool and hot spring, and is surrounded by green plants, it is normal to have leaves and floating insects, and the hotel can clean it every day. But the privacy is average. You can see the outside of our place from the second floor next door, so it's not absolutely private.

The stay was quite satisfactory. Thanks!

msg:This is my first negative review on the entire Internet this year. If everyone (or the merchant) thinks it is inappropriate, I can delete it.
1. The air conditioner in the room leaks, affecting normal sleep. Because the air conditioner is leaking, the air conditioner circuit on the second floor is short-circuited. The air conditioner cannot be used in other rooms. It will be very hot at night (in the first half of the night).
2. There is a large bug inside the dining room lamp on the first floor. Is it probably a beetle? It still looks quite scary.
3. The audio-visual system in the ba*****t cannot be used. It is a home theater. It looks luxurious but cannot be used.
4. There is no washing machine. There is no washing machine in the villa, which is a bit strange.
5. The remote control of the smart toilet (Kohler) works well and badly, but some of the buttons (for the butt) cannot release water, which is very embarrassing.

The electrician maintenance master was very responsible and had a good attitude. He said he could coordinate a room change (thank you very much). But it was too late and the elders were too tired and unwilling to change. I still have to thank the electrician, one of the few highlights of the hotel.

I never expected that the pool for guests to soak and swim in could be so dirty. The sanitary conditions in the room are also very dirty. It is difficult to understand whether the sanitary work is done. The hotel service and communication skills are also very poor. There is no service at all. It is the worst hotel to be cheated! ! !

The quality of other service staff in the hotel is also very high, which makes people think of the little blacks in those high-end hotels in the Maldives. During the epidemic, I couldn't go out, and the lunch box provided by the hotel was also very delicious and not expensive. In short, the hotel is very recommended, and I hope the hotel can learn from each other and do better!

msg:This is my second stay at this hotel, here is my experience:
‚≠êÔ∏èAdvantages:
1. The price-performance ratio is invincible. In a villa hotel like Sanya, it also has a private swimming pool and hot spring. This price is really rare. Therefore, if you are traveling as a family, you need more than two bedrooms, and you want to stay in a hotel with spacious rooms and high privacy, this hotel is the best place to stay.
2. A welcome fruit, plus an afternoon tea, are all free during the stay in the mini bar, and breakfast is provided from 7:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. directly to the room, which is very suitable for lazy people who want to sleep until they wake up naturally Star
3. The toiletries are very good, it's L'Occitane, it's very easy to use. The room is equipped with an iPad and stereo, and there is an elevator, so even with heavy luggage, it is very convenient to go up and downstairs
‚≠êÔ∏è Disadvantages:
1. The biggest disadvantage of the hotel is that it is not facing the sea, so if you have high requirements for sea views, you can directly ignore the hotel
2. There are few entertainment activities in the hotel, and the public facilities are not complete, which means that there are no other fun public areas in the hotel except the villa itself.
3. The hotel facilities are a little old. The last time I stayed was 19 years. At that time, I was shocked when I entered the room. I felt that the hotel room was too beautiful, but this time I felt that it was obviously aging.
4. Deterioration of service quality. The last time I stayed, the one-to-one butler service experience was very good, but this time I stayed, the presence of the butler was very low, except that I saw the butler for a short time on the day of check-in, and I never showed up after that, nor did I add my WeChat. On the day of check-out, I asked for breakfast to be delivered to my room at 7:00, because I have to check out later and have other arrangements, but breakfast was not delivered until 7:40. I called the front desk, but the front desk pushed everything to the housekeeper and asked me to contact the housekeeper directly ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èButler service is to bring convenience to the guests, not to add a procedure.

In general, if you are a couple or alone, I do not recommend this hotel. Although the room is large, there are too few entertainment facilities and the location is too remote. But if it is a family or a few families traveling, I recommend this hotel first, the price is very high

msg:üçÉEnvironment: Before the epidemic, I always went on vacation abroad. In the past two years, I was the first choice for domestic vacations. Don‚Äôt consider the packages and prices. Traveling with family is especially suitable for parents and children.
üîîService: The housekeeper Xiao Sun is very warm and thoughtful, reminds me of TAN in Anantara. The cleaners and various brothers are also very friendly and will meet our requirements as much as possible
üöó Transportation: The first time I stayed here in Jiyang, I booked because it was close to Anaya. It was very convenient to go to the music festival on the first day. It was a little far from the city, and it didn‚Äôt matter if I had a car.
Next time I come to Sanya with my family, I will stay for a few days. It is a good choice to relax and relieve fatigue. The price is very high! We can also cook. We have many local friends, and many people come to the party. The housekeeper Xiaosun also provides us with a lot of convenience üòÑüòÑüòÑ

From before the trip to the whole service, it is seamless and comfortable. There are also small gifts for children. It's great that the hotel's hot spring can satisfy children's swimming wishes in this season in Sanya. The greening and lighting inside the hotel are actually more attentive, which will give this hotel a higher grade. In fact, the furniture and bathroom facilities in the villa can be seen to be in line with the luxury positioning, and the sanitation is also good. However, the location of the hotel is relatively biased. If you want to go out to eat, it is best to drive by yourself; if the whole family travels and does not want too many people to disturb, this is a good choice.

Although the hotel does not have much fun facilities, quiet and not crowded is my preferred vacation mode. At the same time, I especially like the housekeeper Sun Peng and Sun. Both times he arranged the reception, and the response was very quick, and he took care of what the customer wanted. There are also the staff who came to clean the room. Although the villa is very large, they cleaned very carefully. I mentioned that the coffee machine is a bit difficult to use. Among them, the staff immediately took the initiative to make two cups of coffee for me. Service awareness and attitude They are all very good. The only flaw is the restaurant's service.

Fortunately, the hotel has been actively helping to coordinate and deal with it, and the attitude is quite good. I gave the housekeeper Xiao Xu a thumbs up, and he responded promptly. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the kitchenware requires an additional charge. There are relatively few takeaways available around the hotel. The hotel restaurant was only open during our stay, and the dishes were relatively limited. The overall environment and comfort are nothing to say. You can park at the entrance of the villa, and it is very convenient for self-driving.

But the breakfast at this hotel is really no different from the express hotel, and the taste is really very average. The hotel is in a mountain col. The vegetation coverage is very high, the negative ion content is very high, and the air is very good. In my opinion, this hotel is very suitable for the elderly and suitable for health preservation, because it is very, very quiet! There are basically no public entertainment facilities in the hotel. If you are a family member, please rent a car to the hotel by yourself. Otherwise, it is still not convenient to play in the city in the daily travel area. The interior of the hotel room is very good, but the details do not allow careful scrutiny. The door frame of the room is rotten. Even if the air conditioner is turned to 16 degrees and repaired twice, the interior is still very boring. The seats in the restaurant are really dirty. Every time I sit down, I need to put a paper towel on the chair before I dare to sit. The refrigerator is not very clean. The sliding door of the bathroom of the pool room on the first floor was half torn down, so that the bathroom door could not be closed! In general, apart from the service, this hotel is totally sorry for the high score of 4.9! My evaluation is very objective, only for the reference of guests who need to book this hotel!

msg:To be honest, the first time I stayed, I was surprised. The hotel is located halfway up the mountain and not close to the sea, but the swimming pool in the room is enough for children and the family to play happily. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is also very rich, and we have been upgraded 3 In the bedroom suite, the children said that the room was too big to be lost. What‚Äôs more important is the hotel‚Äôs service. All the staff are very friendly and make the guests feel at home, especially the housekeeper Xiao Xu. From the day before check-in, he started to track the itinerary on WeChat. WeChat responded to all kinds of problems during the stay. The eight-year-old son repeated it. Emphasize, we must give butler Xiao Xu a five-star praise! Will come again next year
