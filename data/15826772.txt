msg:Fantastic 2-night stay at the Naked Castle.  Perfect for a short getaway from surrounding big cities.  Beautiful views from the cliffside suite. I prefer the cliffside suite vs. the 5 different themed castle room due to the large open layout of the suite and better views of the mountain. Staffs are super nice and friendly.  Buffet breakfast (next to the pool) is good and the restaurant at the castle is great! Not a huge amount of amenities but that's ok since the purpose of going there is to relax.  Used half a day to check out the nearby Mo Gan Shan scenic areas. If you don't drive yourself, getting in and out with taxi requires a little bit of planning.  Side of the property has two direct hiking trails to the nearby Mo Gan Shan scenic area (easy hike) and Yu Cun (very challenging).  Pro tip: make sure to bring anti-mosquito/bugs bite lotion/cream and also anti-itch lotion.

Special shout-out to Johnson, who really took care of us during our stay and the restaurant staff at the castle for their excellent service!

He sent us the hotel location, the activity schedule in the hotel in the past few days, and the surrounding travel guide. After arriving at the hotel parking lot on the first day, a special car was arranged to pick us up at the front desk to check in. It is very convenient! During the few days of stay, they will take the initiative to ask if there are any other needs, and will also take the initiative to tell us how to go to the breakfast restaurant. The details are very warm and thoughtful! 

🎨There are a variety of rich activities in the hotel, which are different every day. This time I participated in pottery painting, pottery making, outdoor sketching, and pumpkin pie making courses. The teachers I met, Ella and Vicky, are also very considerate. There are some courses I want to participate in that will be left for next time! 

✨Every staff member is very friendly and polite, responsive, and not very timely! 

In addition, the scenery is really beautiful, and the air is super good~ Green and good mood 💚💚💚 Treasure Hotel In short, it is highly recommended! ! !

msg:For my wife and I’s two-year wedding anniversary, we chose the wild luxury hotel “Moganshan Naked Castle”! There are many types of rooms, and it turns out that the choice is worth the money. We spent a pleasant three days and two nights! 
After booking the hotel, Shirley, the front desk manager of Naked Castle, added my WeChat and provided thoughtful and meticulous butler service. When she learned that it was my and my wife’s wedding anniversary, she also gave me a beautiful cake, which was a surprise! It deepened my good impression of the hotel at once! ! Thank you again! Thank you~ Because Shirley introduced the hotel APP of Naked Castle in detail before checking in, it was easy to get the hotel car and catering reservations after checking in. 
Naked Castle provides a variety of experience activities for guests staying in every day. For example, yoga, pumpkin pie making, ceramic making, Scottish handcrafting, etc. There are many activities that you can participate in, but the number of people is limited, first come first served! Thanks to Abby and Ella, two little teachers, for their patient guidance for us who are new to handcrafting, painting, and pottery, and they can also provide help and be responsible and competent! (The finished product is shown in the picture, be bold and confident) 
Naked Castle is a very good family parent-child and couple summer resort hotel! The scenery is very photogenic! The Chayou Courtyard we chose also has an independent hot spring bath. If possible, we don’t have to leave the hotel to take care of the activities every day. In addition, if you want to visit naked Castle’s "brother" naked Stables Hotel, you can also make an appointment through the front desk. It is equally exciting! Looking forward to meeting naked Castle again!

msg:I have heard of Moganshan for a long time. I have been a little tired from work recently and wanted to relax in a different place. So I just went and chose the top hotel in Moganshan on Ctrip. Naked Castle directly covers a hilltop and is surrounded by mountains. The view from the window is very beautiful. It was foggy these two days, and the mountains were misty and rainy. The big bathtub in this room is also great.
Swimming in the infinity pool is also good. You can enjoy the scenery while swimming. The water temperature is suitable.
I have stayed in many hotels with housekeepers. The last time in Liyang was very good. This time in Naked Castle was also very good. The housekeeper Xiao Chen, Chen Li, contacted me very politely and considerately before I arrived. She responded to my requests. It was very comfortable to talk to her and chat with her. She also sent me the sunrise video she took, which was really beautiful.
The hotel has activities every hour, and I participated in some of them. It was pretty good. I was the only one visiting the castle. The castle's guide Xiao Feng, Feng Guijun, took the initiative to help me take a lot of photos, and taught me how to pose. Many of the scenes used some foregrounds, which was professional and great.
The next day, I took the hotel bus to Naked Stables and took a look around. I felt that the cliff view room at Naked Stables was the best.
The hotel has a fixed commuter bus every day, but not many. Naked Stables has a test ride Land Rover at 9 o'clock in the morning. It's a pity that I can't go there without commuting at this time. Another thing is that I don't know why there is a piece of glass on the door of the hotel room, which is light-transmissive. So I woke up early in the morning and woke up at dawn.
The breakfast was also good.
The most unexpected thing was that I saw two eagles on the balcony in the morning, very close, and Xiao Chen said that I would have good luck.
Overall, it was a great experience.

Service: I must give a big thumbs up to the housekeeper Xiao Yang. I noted that the housekeeper Xiao Yang called us immediately to arrange a more romantic room, the Rose Cottage, and there was also a honeymoon cake. Any problems during the check-in stage were solved immediately, which really touched me. Manually add a chicken leg 🍗, I will come again next time, thank you 🙏

Although I almost vomited when I went up the mountain road, I really liked it after arriving at the destination! I knew this place because of the variety show, and it was really worth it after I came here! The real thing is very consistent with the video! The service is super five-star, and the facilities and activities are also very good. I, a clumsy party, also successfully got the skills of kneading clay and making pumpkin pie with the help of the baking master and the pottery sisters Ella and Abby, and they are all very gentle and patient! Although this trip was short, it can be regarded as very successful. I also met a couple holding a wedding here, and followed the joy. And before leaving, the hotel also gave them their own fried tea. Next time I come, I will call my friends to have fun together! Thank you naked Castle for the surprise!

The housekeeper added WeChat the day before check-in and gave me some tips for check-in. We arrived early the next day and there was a vacancy, so we were given a room early. However, after check-in, we found that the view of the B2 room had to go to the front of the terrace to fully see the view. I contacted the housekeeper Chengzi and he quickly adjusted the room for us. In fact, I still prefer the cliff view suite, which is transparent and bright! The Chinese restaurant in the hotel tastes good. I personally think that the breakfast is not very rich in variety and the quality is not very high-end. After all, the room rate of about 4,000 per night is not cheap. In addition, the hair dryer is not a Dyson, which also makes me a little disappointed. However, the service really deserves full marks. Whether it is the housekeeper, the front desk, or the Chinese restaurant waiter, they are really very friendly and considerate!

There were signposts all along the winding mountain road, which gave me a real-life scenario.
We had a more casual schedule, and although it was rainy, it was still a different experience. We learned about the century-old history of the castle in Naked Castle, had dinner in the Chinese restaurant, and participated in the activities of the hotel's activity village. I would like to praise the housekeeper Shirley for arranging the anniversary decoration in advance, sending cakes and souvenirs, and being particularly proactive in solving problems during our stay. I will look for her next time!

msg:This naked trip was worthwhile! Although the view was hazy due to the rain on the first day, and the cliff view room had a poor view, the enriching activities in the castle were very suitable for couples and parents-children. Pumpkin pie making, pottery learning, bamboo basket weaving, and essential oil handmade soap gave me a full experience. There was also a movie screening after dinner in the evening, which was really good. The service awareness of the service staff in the resort was also very positive. Basically, when they saw us walking on the road, they would take the initiative to ask if a shuttle bus was needed. The next day, the weather was beautiful. The green mountains and clouds after sunrise were more amazing in person than the tweets on Xiaohongshu. The castle + light mist was like a fairyland. Finally, I would like to recommend Johnson, the head of the housekeeping depar**ent, who made detailed arrangements in all aspects from the beginning of his stay. He was very caring and heartwarming, which made the family travel experience exceed expectations👍

Fortunately, Shirley helped us connect with her. She gave us a very detailed introduction and thoughtful arrangements, upgraded our room for free, and arranged anniversary decorations and cakes for us! During the stay, all the good things became within reach. Every staff member was very friendly and polite, and we felt at home! Shirley also gave us hotel souvenirs before leaving!

The weather was sunny on the first day, and we felt the feeling of "seeing all the mountains". It rained a little on the second day, and the whole mountain was filled with fairy air, which was unique. We participated in the hotel's tea picking activity, and our hands were stained with the fragrance of Longjing tea. This stay was short, and if we have time, we are willing to come back to experience the scenery in other seasons. Thank you Shirley for your careful arrangement. The room was very good, clean, and the bedding was comfortable.

On rainy days, the mountains are shrouded in clouds and mist, like a fairyland, and every step is on a poetic painting. On sunny days, the sun shines all over the earth, everything is shining, and every scenery is refreshing.
Here, there is no hustle and bustle, only tranquility and beauty. I am intoxicated in this tranquility and beauty, as if I have found the home of my soul. Every stay makes me feel extremely comfortable and at ease, and I really experience the unique charm of the mountains. The room is very good, and the service is even better. The front desk butler Xiao Chen is very warm and thoughtful, and the communication is smooth from the reception to the whole process. The children are very happy.

Each staying guest will be assigned a personal butler to serve him. During this stay, I am very grateful to the manager Chen Li and the housekeeper Lisa for their warm service and helping us upgrade to a cliff-view room. The balcony of the cliff view room is great. You can look at the mountains, breathe in oxygen, count the stars, and wait for the sunset.
Each of the unique cliff-view suites is located on the edge of the cliff. Standing on the panoramic balcony, you can enjoy the stunning scenery of the green mountains and lush forests. The unique bathtub configuration allows you to enjoy the beautiful view of the mountains while taking a bath.
naked Castle is located at the highest point of the entire naked valley resort. It is a spiral building complex, allowing visitors to stand at the highest point of naked Castle to overlook the beautiful scenery of the entire Mogan Mountain and feel the gentleness of the mountains in the south. . This unique design not only adds to the beauty of Naked Castle, but also provides excellent views and a comfortable stay.
In a quiet space, inspired by nature, with unique creative design, quality life is integrated into every detail. Only those who are in it can feel a more comfortable space!

The hotel has a very rich arrangement of activities, allowing people to feel every moment is not wasted.
The hotel is perfectly matched with the mountains and fields. The basic room type is very small, and the shower water is very, very small. It is not recommended for parents and children to choose this room type, but most of the time you forget yourself between the mountains and rivers, which will weaken the overall feeling of the room.
Special thanks to the housekeeper Shirley for her meticulousness!

msg:The hotel is on the top of a mountain next to Mogan Mountain. It is not in the Mogan Mountain scenic area. Only guests can enter. There are no miscellaneous people, so it is very quiet and comfortable. It was rainy and foggy when we checked in, like entering a fairyland. Although there are battery cars to pick us up, we are willing to use our feet to carefully measure and feel the beauty of every place, which feels great. The housekeeper Shirley contacted and added WeChat one day in advance. She answered all questions and provided considerate and meticulous service. The staff would take the initiative to greet us, and the service was good.
We lived in a single-family courtyard with a hot spring pool in the yard. It was so comfortable to soak in the rain and fog. The outdoor swimming pool was also great. When the ground temperature was only about 20 degrees, the water temperature could still maintain a comfortable temperature of 28 degrees for swimming. It can be seen that they have put a lot of thought into it!
The only thing that needs to be improved is the catering, which is still a little behind the naked heart valley at the foot of the mountain.
Overall, it was worth the trip!

msg:This time, I took advantage of the Qingming Festival holiday to travel with my mother and chose the long-planned naked Castle. I will write down my feelings from the following aspects for your reference:

About check-in:
The hotel called one day in advance to record the license plate number. The process of entering the naked Castle was very smooth. From parking to the front desk, there was also a shuttle bus to pick up and drop off. The driver was also very enthusiastic to help with the luggage. The housekeeper Shirley also added WeChat one day in advance and gave relevant navigation instructions. After arriving, Shirley helped us arrange a room upgrade, and the whole service was super good.

About the room:
The room is large enough and the hygiene is also very good. When you open the curtains, you can see the misty scenery of Mogan Mountain, which is simply beautiful. My favorite thing is to curl up on the sofa, drink the yellow bud tea provided by the hotel, and watch the drizzle outside the window.

Hotel activities:
The hotel offers a variety of free activities every day, which run through the whole day and will never be boring.
On the morning of the second day of our stay, we participated in the "handmade soap making" in the spa. Miss Alice patiently explained the production process and precautions. Because it was spring, I chose a Spring style, and the finished product was also very good (Figure 1).
In the afternoon of the same day, we participated in bamboo weaving. As two beginners, we made two relatively practical small fans. Thomas also made two birds for us, which was very smart.
In the evening, pizza making, I experienced making mini pizzas. I put a little too much sauce, which was a little salty, but the overall taste was good, which directly solved our dinner problem.
Before leaving on the last day, I participated in the "ceramic making". Miss Lusi was super nice. She taught me how to make it step by step and patiently helped to adjust it. For me, a novice player who experienced pottery for the first time, I was very satisfied with this finished product (Figure 2).

About meals:
The hotel is an independent resort. Although there will be farmhouses 15 minutes away by car, believe me, you will not think of it after entering. The hotel's buffet breakfast is really full every day, with a variety of styles and demeanor, and the service attitude of the restaurant's chefs and staff is also superb. On the first night, we also experienced the hotel's Chinese restaurant, the taste is beyond words, highly recommended.

Finally, I want to talk about the scenery. It can be said that walking in the hotel is full of surprises. From the room to the castle, all you need to take a big photo is a photographer📷.

I am also very grateful to Yu Shuang for taking me to make pottery. She was very patient throughout the whole process and helped me to improve it in the end. I look forward to the final work! The housekeeper Sydney Shiery is also great and will give us appropriate suggestions. We had a lot of fun in two days. When we left, there was also Shi Liu 🐕 to play with. It was great

Service: The housekeeper Xiao Yang and the front desk Chen Li took good care of me from before check-in to check-in and during the stay. The room arrangements and dining reservations were very good.
Catering: The breakfast was average, the tea eggs were not heated, and the fried rice noodles were a bit salty. However, after reaction, the restaurant manager immediately made rectifications. The Chinese restaurant service and dishes are full marks.
Cleanliness: The aunt was very serious about cleaning. She knew there were children and even gave me an extra quilt.

The hotel is very big and there are many activities to participate in. It is very convenient to go to the Mogan Mountain Scenic Area. I chose to go there in one day. We went to Naked Stables for dinner and lunch, and the baby also went for a horse ride in Naked Stables. It was a perfect time for walking the baby. Finally, I would like to thank the butlers Xiao Yang and Chen Li for their excellent and considerate service.

The castle hotel has beautiful views and is highly recommended. Fortress Chinese Restaurant is delicious and cost-effective. I didn’t order the set meal this time. Every dish was very good👍 There isn’t much in the Western breakfast, but it tastes good and the ingredients are fresh. The female employee in the activity room, I don’t know her name, thank you very much for helping me take care of the puppy so that our family of three can have breakfast in peace. There was some unpleasantness at Naked Leaf SPA, but fortunately it was resolved with the coordination of Xiao Chen. The pinnacle of Mogan Mountain, you can stay away from the hustle and bustle and enjoy the delicious food and beautiful scenery on vacation. It is worth coming back next time. I hope to meet these outstanding old employees.

msg:For the first time in the New Year, I chose to escape Shanghai to celebrate the New Year.
I chose Naked Castle, which I have collected for a long time, and I didn’t expect it to be pet-friendly. This really won my heart.

Facilities: I booked a cliff suite for four nights. The room is very large and has many smart facilities, including a humidifier and TV screen projection. After all, it is a resort hotel, and the main goal is to have a first-class environment.

Service: Xiaoyu, the hotel butler, added WeChat right after booking the room. We provide 1v1 service and will patiently answer any questions. When we arrived at the hotel parking lot, we waited for the hotel shuttle bus to take us to the front desk. The guy at the front desk politely and patiently explained the hotel facilities and various recreational activities during the Spring Festival. Because the stay is relatively long, pet services (pet food/water basin and toys) are also provided as a gift.

Hygiene: Because we have pets, my sister and brother who clean the house close the door every day and do it gently to avoid scaring the little ones. Everyone is very pet friendly. Although it is a good hotel for pets, there are many adopted cats and dogs, but the hygiene is very good and everything is clean.

There are many hotel activities during the Spring Festival, which both adults and children can participate in, which is very interesting. The only drawback is that there are too few restaurants in the hotel. There are only two Chinese and Western restaurants, but the dishes are very cost-effective, especially the Chinese food, which lasted for three or four days.

msg:I stayed at naked Castle on the last day of the Spring Festival. I originally booked a rural retreat, but the store generously upgraded me to a cliff-view suite. The room was very large and the view was very broad. The resort has beautiful scenery and entertainment areas for relaxation. The protagonist is naturally the naked castle with a history of more than 100 years. The castle has a sense of age and is beautifully decorated. The Chinese restaurant in the castle is also good. I had a good experience staying at the hotel before the start of construction.

Special thanks to my butler Kiwi, who is very professional and thoughtful. Considering that our family checked in very late with our baby, he took the initiative to help me delay check-out so that we could have a better rest. It was great! Of course we saw a lot of stars in the night sky at night, great! Before we arrived, they were very friendly and introduced us to naked Castle, answered questions and recommended some tour routes, which was great! I can understand the reason why the price of Naked Castle is relatively high. It seems that the entire mountain is developed by them. The privacy experience is very good. The security guard at the foot of the mountain lets me go. I drive for a while to the front of the lobby, and then there is a connection. The car took another ride up to the mountains. The scenery was very good, the air was fresh, and the mountains looked so picturesque. I will come again next time!

The Chinese food at Fortress House is so delicious. Steamed fish with bamboo shoots, braised pork, and smoked fish are all extremely delicious. I can’t count how many times I’ve ordered these dishes here.

msg:This hotel is located halfway up the mountain. You have to drive slowly up and down the mountain. Fortunately, our butler helped us arrange a room close to the castle. It is only a few minutes' walk away. The butler's service is warm and thoughtful, and the castle environment is elegant and charming. The food is delicious. The only thing lacking in facilities is that there is no TV in the room. If you visit Deqing again in the future, REN will book this hotel to stay.

Living in a medieval European castle, you can also experience life in a princess diary. Special thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Yang for his meticulous service. During our stay, he was able to respond promptly and quickly solve all our needs. I also want to thank the hotel manager Chen.

msg:Returning to nature, returning to our roots, we have been admiring the concept of nakedness for a long time. This time I spent an unforgettable two days and two nights at Naked Castle. In my mind, it ranks among the top five resorts or hotels that I have experienced all over the world. Not to mention the geographical location and various hardware facilities, it occupies an exclusive corner of Fortress Mountain, traverses the Jianggong Road hiking route, connects Jianchi and Yinshan Street through Baibuling to the north, and crosses the forest road to the east to Yucun Square. Experience everything from a country house to a cliff-view suite, or a luxurious courtyard or castle theme. The housekeeper Xiao Chen helped arrange a room upgrade based on the room status. The next day, because there were not enough shuttle buses to Naked Valley, he enthusiastically helped arrange a private car transfer. The vacation package activities were all properly booked in advance. Special thumbs up 👍 The breakfast variety is not included. There are many but the ingredients are fresh and delicious. We tried Western food at Naked Food, Chinese food at Fortress House, and even ordered room service. They were all pretty good 👍 (except that the Chinese beef was too salty). I haven’t picked up a paintbrush for more than ten years, so I picked up my old skills again and spent two hours in the handicraft workshop to complete the T-shirt painting🎨. Let’s see how it looks when worn in the future hahaha! Before leaving, I carried a bunch of things in my bag, including wine, snacks, souvenir coffee cups, etc. The hotel was also very attentive to the service experience.

msg:On the occasion of the tenth wedding anniversary, I finally came to the Naked Castle that I had longed for. The hotel is located on the top of the mountains, which has a strong visual impact. It is also blessed by a century of history, which adds to the heritage. It’s perfect to catch up with the best viewing period of red leaves. What I like most about the location of the room is the castle's stone balcony, which has a unique charm. You can have an unobstructed view of the mountains, reservoirs, and the city below. You can even watch the sunrise and sunset, the full moon, the stars, and the flowing clouds without leaving the house. The hotel's facilities and design are very attentive, and there are movies everywhere, especially with the warm sunshine in winter, the a**osphere is full. The breakfast was very exquisite, the Chinese restaurant was unique, and we also went to Naked Valley Western Restaurant in the middle, which is highly recommended. There are also many recreational activities, including a heated swimming pool, billiards, table football, darts, etc. The butler service is very good, especially thanks to Xiao Qi for his timely response and meticulous arrangements. I'm glad I chose naked Castle and I'm very happy to have spent three days and two nights here.

When he learned that I was traveling for a birthday celebration, he thoughtfully upgraded the room, made it beautifully decorated, and presented me with a small cake. It was so heartwarming. The hotel rooms are comfortably furnished, have a natural feel, and the bedding is first-rate, giving people an excellent sleeping experience. Naked Castle is great, but it’s not easy to build it as it is. Here, you can not only see beautiful scenery, but also touch history and culture, taste delicious food, participate in swimming, table tennis, darts and other activities, and experience the meticulous and thoughtful service of the friends. It is really a happy trip! Highly recommend if you have the opportunity to stay, it’s worth it!

It was already around 19:00 when we arrived on the first day, and the road up the mountain was a bit difficult. When we arrived in the room, the welcome fruits and children's utensils were all ready! The sun is shining brightly in the morning. Sitting by the naked floor-to-ceiling windows, enjoying a delicious breakfast, watching the beautiful scenery, and relaxing physically and mentally! After breakfast, we visited the castle. The children said this castle was better than they imagined! I also had a lot of fun with Scottish crafts and archery in the afternoon! We happened to happen upon the Chris**as light-up event. We all put on Chris**as headdresses and scarves under the castle, roasted marshmallows, ate cakes, drank ginger tea, and listened to the children singing Chris**as carols live. The winter a**osphere was full~ Kua Kua Hotel's service is really responsive to everything. If you call for room service, it will be delivered as soon as possible. If you are really busy and need to wait, we will call you back to inform you of the situation and the possible waiting period. The hotel's shuttle bus is also the fastest responding hotel I have ever stayed in. At the end of check out, I asked for a souvenir as a souvenir.

Naked Castle is great for couples or families. It was really fun to bring the children to experience this time. When checking out, the children were reluctant to leave.

Naked Castle, a hotel with such a legendary story! Inherited from 1910 to the present! Going up and down the mountain is a completely different experience from Naked Valley. Watching the sunrise and sunset on the mountain makes time seem to slow down! There are many activities in the castle for three days and two nights. Riding your own car in the castle is a unique style. Unfortunately, the time is too short and the journey has ended before I have fully enjoyed it! Special thanks to our housekeeper, Patti Xiaoyu, for her meticulous care and answers from the moment we checked in! The various recommendations and services made me feel like I was at home!

msg:After repeated comparisons, I chose Castle between naked valley and naked castle.
In addition to the appeal of a century-old castle
The main reason is the preference in room type.
Our family of 4 is more suitable for the neighboring house of the Cliff Suite.
There are two rooms in one building next to each other, a bit like stacked villas.
They can maintain their independence while still shouting to each other at the door, haha

Overall, the services and facilities are good.
What I especially like about the coffee machine is that the coffee beans are freshly ground and brewed☕️
All toiletries are also equipped with the concept of environmental protection ♻️
The toiletries formulated with essential oils are impeccable.
I like stone containers 💕
The overall quality is good. The curtains can be raised and lowered automatically with one click.
The charger is also a modern facility with USB👌
The only thing that doesn't match the level of the room is the hair dryer.
Should I switch to a Dyson?

Another little suggestion:
Will there be fences at the back two locations of the shuttle bus?
The slope is steep and it's really easy to fall.

In addition, special praise should be given to the little brother who guided us on the castle and the flower walk up and down. In such a hot weather, he was enthusiastic, professional, considerate and conscientious. There was no trace of perfunctory or procedural procedures. He was full of optimism and positive energy. I really need encouragement. !
I just forgot to ask him his name and he went to work for the next tourist^
Thank you to the little brother in charge of 2403 and 2405 in the activity center.

It is highly integrated with nature and returns to the natural freedom of the heart. From hardware to services, Naked Castle has demonstrated this concept vividly. The design of rooms, gardens, activities, etc., as well as catering options, have tried their best to respect and integrate nature in every detail, including service staff. The feeling of saying hello when we meet is natural and unpretentious. No matter how busy you are, you will be reminded consciously or unconsciously to relax, accept and enjoy the beauty that nature brings to us.

Special thanks to Room Director Johnson for his warm and sincere care, which made our vacation a very good memory!

msg:I have always admired the famous name of Naked Castle. Taking advantage of Ctrip’s 919 event, more than 2,400 people (after booking) purchased a basic room type for two nights. At that time, I was interested in the two-night free activity, but the actual experience was tasteless...
The basic room type is "countryside residence" with simple and unpretentious decoration. Compared with other B&Bs, it has no advantage and is even overtaken. The room is not as small as expected, but it is also a little cramped. What I didn't expect is that the double bed is actually a double bed, only one meter wide... It is highly recommended here. Replace the twin bed with one that is more than 1.2 meters wide!
The castle stands on the top of the mountain, dominating the crowd. The kids said it looked like the Neuschwanstein Castle that appeared in Disney's Over the Horizon! The interior decoration style is full of wild luxury. Other public activity areas are also very outstanding, with a sense of design and a return to nature. A girl who is perfect for taking pictures! !
I ate at both Chinese and Western restaurants, and the Chinese restaurant was OK; but the food at the Western restaurant was as bland as boiled water. What’s more interesting is that when I bought an ice cream at the castle, there was actually a service fee and tax!
If you don’t want to eat in the hotel, you can also drive to Yucun, which takes 18 minutes one way. There is a lot of choice and the price is much higher.
It's a pity that the service level of the staff is uneven, which makes people feel half excellent and half happy. I reported it to the front desk when I checked out. I hope it will get better in the future.

Outside the balcony is the green mountains and green waters. It is very comfortable and the scenery is beautiful! The room is very big and feels great, and the service is also very good! My parents are very satisfied with their stay!

msg:A family trip with kids. The package purchased through Ctrip has been rescheduled due to the typhoon. The hotel service attitude is very good. We were given a room upgrade. Upgraded from pastoral to cliff dwelling. It's about 20 meters walk from the infinity pool and activity center. Quite considerate.

On the first night, we ordered Chinese food at Fortress House. As soon as I arrived and looked around, I saw a rainbow full of bows. Very spectacular (see Figure 1). The outdoor swimming pool has a constant temperature of 27 degrees. It will be closed at night without a lifeguard. I didn't wear a swimsuit and went to the reception store to buy it. Went for a swim with the kids. It feels cool. The water depth is 1.2 meters, which is a very safe depth. (But be sure to wear sunscreen!)

The weather cleared up the next day, and the castle took on a completely different beauty under the blue sky. Have breakfast at the Cliff Restaurant (Naked Taste), which is also the hotel’s Western restaurant (Picture 14). It tastes good and delicate. The package comes with a picnic basket (picture 12): it includes pastries, fruits, appetizers and South African red wine (because the hotel boss is a South African), which reminds me of the Pride of Africa train.

Signed up for the hike. A group of more than 20 people and a tour guide led a tour of the castle (Pictures 10, 11, 15, 16) and walked across the canopy lawn (Pictures 7 and 8). Can have a picnic. The uphill and downhill slopes are steep and require a certain amount of physical fitness, good knees, and a pair of non-slip shoes.

In the afternoon, we made an appoin**ent for archery and drove to "Naked Valley". The hotel has a shuttle bus. There is no appoin**ent for a Land Rover test drive. Still having fun on the lawn.

On the morning of the third day, there was hand-making. Scotsman. It’s also quite interesting (also part of the package). We were also given a set of souvenirs when we checked out. Very thoughtful.

The hotel has a wide range of activities, some are included in the package, and some are at your own expense. But in short, you need to make a reservation in advance. The hotel staff are very warm and helpful. By the way, the hotel is pet-friendly. Saw several guests' dogs. There is also a dog in the hotel reception center. They still wanted to follow us, but they all jumped in the car and were asked to leave:)

msg:The hotel service is quite attentive, and the shuttle bus and service staff are very simple and friendly (they understand everything, and the greetings are not fake at first glance). The environment is very good and the price is acceptable for the environment. During the three-day and two-night holiday, dinners on both nights were eaten at the hotel. The price is acceptable for dining on the top of the mountain. The dishes are also unexpected, at least for the price. We were satisfied and went to have afternoon tea on the afternoon of the second day. Here is a reminder (afternoon tea in the castle is a set meal, but on the afternoon of the first day because there was a wedding in the evening, the entire large living room and library should be used for afternoon tea. Let the relatives and friends attending the wedding sit or half lie on the sofa. There is no place for me to have afternoon tea. Looking at the eyes of each of them looking at me, an outsider, we silently exited; in the Western restaurant, I can order any cake in the afternoon. Coffee drinks or some Western pastries), the environment of the Western restaurant is also good, there were only two of us in the afternoon, it is highly recommended. In terms of hygiene, boutique B&Bs or resorts cannot be expected to be as good as five-star hotels (not to mention that some five-star hotels are not up to standard), but I was satisfied with the hygiene of the room I stayed in, and the cleaning staff were also Very diligent). We are very satisfied with this vacation and would recommend it to our friends. A little suggestion: It is best to give two room cards to guests when checking in, because there are several places in the resort where you need to swipe the door card to enter and exit the Mogan Mountain Scenic Area or hike other attractions. Even guests in one room can Maybe we can split up and it would be much more convenient for everyone to bring their own card.

The last time I came was in the fall of 2021. During the epidemic, although the scenery, accommodation, and services were superb, many activities were not available. I came back this time and did pottery, bowling, wine tasting, and dug bamboo shoots. Mr. Tao Yi Lu’s warm reception and professional guidance enabled us to experience relaxation and healing while enjoying the sense of accomplishment of making pottery with our own hands during the process of learning pottery. The bar manager Robert invited us to taste four Chinese and foreign wines, and not only introduced each in detail He also shared the characteristics of wine growing and the methods and essence of wine tasting, which benefited people a lot. A variety of unique and seasonal activities add color to travel and leave beautiful memories.
I would also like to express my special thanks to Mr. Xiao Chen from guest service. He called in advance to confirm the itinerary, introduced various activities, warmly reminded us of precautions, and arranged a room upgrade for us, which made us feel warmer.
We will come back to Naked Castle, a beautiful and warm place.

The reservation was successful, and I received a call from Chen Xia at the hotel front desk. She immediately added WeChat and informed her of the check-in details. Because we were in a hurry, we forgot to bring the puppy leash, and tried to ask her if there was a solution. She enthusiastically lent us her own dog leash, which solved our urgent need and made us feel warm on the road. When we arrived at the front desk , we met the smiling Chen Xia, who told us the layout of the resort in a very auspicious manner and helped us book dinner, so considerate! During our stay, we encountered attentive and considerate services, quick shuttle buses, delicious mountain meals, historic castles, sweeping views of bamboo forests, and the fragrance of tea all over the mountains and plains. All of this made us feel... The beauty of going to Naked Castle is, yes, in the resort environment where man and nature are very harmonious, we are truly naked, relaxed and happy!

msg:The ceiling of Moganshan accommodation🏰🏰🏰Naked Castle

     Before you stay, you may have some doubts as to whether 5,000+ per night is worth it, but after you stay, you will feel that it is very worth it. I bought Ctrip’s accommodation package, which costs 5,400+. It’s really worth it. I highly recommend it! ! !
      At noon on August 28, we set off from Kaiyuan Senbo and arrived at the Moganshan Huzhou Land Rover Experience Center (next to Naked Valley) before 13:00. According to the staff, the Land Rover Huzhou Experience Center is currently the largest in Asia and is recognized as the world’s largest. One of the best Land Rover experience centers, embracing tea fields and bamboo seas, steep slopes and dense rock forests, there are 7 all-terrain challenge routes: Tea Horse Road, Tanggula Mountain Road, Bamboo Sea Mystery Trail, Forest Ruts, South America Loop, Silk Road, Peak vertical line. Under the guidance of professional Land Rover instructors, we were fortunate enough to experience the highest-level Land Rover models and enjoy a queen-level driving adventure. We must praise our instructor here. He is very patient, meticulous and considerate, and his driving skills are also very good. In the 2-hour experience time, he taught us various adventure techniques and absolutely beat all kinds of adventure vehicles. My husband and I were also awarded certificates of qualification for the entire road section, which was very worthwhile!
       2 hours later, when the rain stopped, we drove to naked Castle🅿️. naked Castle’s pick-up technology is definitely the fastest. As soon as we parked the car, the shuttle bus had already arrived, and it was one car. We only accept one group of guests and provide full service. The person who received us at that time was Manager Chen. He was very nice and enthusiastic. He introduced us to many popular attractions and helped us carry our luggage, which made us feel very warm.
        In addition, the housekeeper Zhang who served us this time was also super enthusiastic and a very beautiful girl. She added me as a WeChat friend the day before check-in and shared many things to note with me. This time we stayed in a cliff view room. I proposed to live on the second floor, which has a good view. Our dear Butler Zhang helped me make the arrangements.
        When you open the door, you will see a very beautiful scenery, and experience why Naked Castle is said to be the ceiling of Mogan Mountain. This feeling of being in the clouds, overlooking the beautiful scenery of Mogan Mountain, is really amazing!
        After checking in and putting down our luggage, we went to the castle and had naked Castle afternoon tea, which is very popular on the Internet. How can I put it, if you are taking pictures, it is definitely very beautiful, but when it comes to eating, it is really average, except for the fresh fruit. , the cake’s value for money is actually really average. But sitting in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows and taking photos is absolutely amazing. It’s very, very beautiful. Hahaha, I took a lot of photos.
        Later, we checked in to the infinity pool. Because it was very windy that day, we went to swim in the infinity pool the next day. It happened to be in the off-season. My husband and my child were the only ones in the entire pool. It felt like it was really the ceiling of the infinity pool. Overlooking the panoramic view of Mogan Mountain, it feels like being in the swimming pool, as if the whole world belongs to you, it's so beautiful. Definitely worth checking in.
         Then we came to Naked Food for dinner, hahahaha, it felt like we were eating all the time. We told Butler Zhang in advance and asked her to arrange a Western food location with the best view. I have to say, naked Western food and the environment, It's really good, the food is delicious, and the scenery is amazing. You can see the infinity pool and the cliff view at the same time. It's an absolute check-in spot for photographers.
        In the evening, at the suggestion of Butler Zhang, we visited Yucun. What can I say, there are a lot of delicious food in Yucun. I recommend Mogan Story. Their beef ****y is very sweet and I can show off a pack of it at once.
         The bed in naked Castle's double room is also very comfortable. The room is separated from dry and wet areas. The dressing table is very large. It also comes with a coffee machine for grinding coffee. The overall design feels reasonable and comfortable. I have to criticize. If so, the hair dryer is not a Dyson, hahahaha, but the wind from the Panasonic is strong enough, so it’s actually not a big problem. The bathtub in the room faces the cliff view. You can wear a swimsuit and soak in the warm water. It is very relaxing for health. I like this big bathtub very much. There are tables and chairs on the balcony where you can lie down and not think about anything. It is pure relaxation and very comfortable.
        In the evening, I wanted to give special praise to Manager Chen who was working the night shift. At that time, I told Butler Zhang that I was suddenly hungry and wanted to eat instant noodles. Unexpectedly, after communicating with Butler Zhang, Manager Chen actually gave me his own new instant noodles that were working the night shift. Come to me, it is really unexpected, so touched.
        The next day we participated in Naked Castle story telling, archery, swimming and other activities. The coach who taught us archery and the young man who explained it were also very polite and patient. Both teaching and lecturing were excellent. Due to time constraints, we delayed our departure. Room, butler Zhang is also very polite, and the arrangements are in place, unlike some hotels that rush people.
        In naked Castle, it is really good to let go of everything and just enjoy, everything is arranged just right. If I have the chance, I will definitely stay at Naked Castle again.

It is 1.2 meters deep for adults and 0.6 meters deep, which is very friendly to babies. My baby is 28 months old and is in it. Have a great time! The taste of naked breakfast is average, but it is better than the environment. With the cliff view outside the window, it doesn’t matter what you eat anymore!
I went to visit Naked Valley on the last day. Personally, I prefer the Castle. After all, on the top of the mountain, the view is very broad!

msg:Living in Tianyuan Xiaoju, I don’t know if it’s because I bought a room at a special price, so the hotel has lowered its service standards. I arrived late on the first night and there was a heavy smell of rotten wood after entering the room. The room was very damp, but I gave up because it was too late. The next day, there were bees in the room and a lot of small mosquitoes on the bed. The hotel could only provide the service of changing the sheets, but could not change the room. In the end, the bees were driven out by themselves. It can be said that having such a living experience in a five-star hotel is terrible. In addition, the service attitude of the hotel was not very satisfactory. In the end, I wanted to delay check-out until 2 o'clock because I couldn't finish packing my things. However, I was rejected because it was full. I have never had the experience of living in a five-star hotel where I was rejected in various ways. Finally, I have to say that the outdoor environment and overall facilities are very good, matching the concept of wild luxury.

First of all, I would like to praise naked Castle’s service, it is worthy of this star rating and its status in the world. Manager Chen Li, the housekeeper, has been actively helping to coordinate and collect our needs since the day before. There are elderly people at home, so he helped us change to a cliff-view suite on the second floor where we can watch the sunrise. Respond to requests, respond within one minute, very considerate and user-friendly. The shuttle bus within the hotel is on call, which is very convenient and feels exclusive.

Room view:
The Cliff View Suite lives up to its name. It overlooks the entire Mogan Mountain scenery and several mountain lakes. The blue sky, white clouds, green mountains and blue lakes are very eye-catching. The rainy and misty weather on the second day also had a different flavor.

swimming pool:
This is the unforgettable core part, like a blue gem 💎 suspended in mid-air. The transparent swimming pool is built on the edge of the cliff. From the swimming pool, you can see the mountain view in front, which is very suitable for taking photos of Internet celebrities. The water quality, temperature, and pH are also marked, and the towels, bathrobes, and recliners are all managed and registered by special personnel, and the whole process is also very reasonable.

Dining room:
That night we had Chinese food at the Fort Tower. The price is similar to that of high-end restaurants in Shanghai. The taste is quite satisfactory, but the fresh bamboo shoots and vegetables are quite special. The service is indeed poor and there is room for improvement.
Naked Heart restaurant for breakfast, the scenery is superb, and the best place to take pictures.

Castle:
A historical building built in 1910, the profound sense of cultural heritage is more completely reflected in the castle. Sit in the living room on the first floor and order a cup of coffee and English black tea, which gives you a sense of time travel. From the terrace on the second floor, you can watch the stars and overlook Hangzhou at night, which is worth a visit.
I recommend everyone to come, it’s worth it.

Environment: The environment is very beautiful, whether it is in the castle or wherever the shuttle bus goes, it is very beautiful

Service: Service is what I think is most worth mentioning. Compared with another well-known hotel I visited at the same time, the service provided by Butler Xiao Chen was much more considerate and considerate. Smooth communication, reasonable arrangements, and thoughtful suggestions and arrangements for activities, which made me feel that this trip was worth the money.

msg:Before coming here, I looked at naked Castle and naked Valley. Although the Internet said that the latter is suitable for bringing children, I was attracted by the scenery of naked Castle and chose the former. I am interested in the Cliff Suite. There is a package deal on Ctrip, it’s great! Draw! Calculate! From the parking lot to the lobby, room or restaurant, you need to be picked up by the hotel's shuttle bus. The mountain road is a bit shaking and your legs will be tired. The taxi service is very fast and the ride is very comfortable. There is a small breeze and the butler will drive. It is also very stable and slow, and the training is very professional~ Before coming, I made a note that I would like the view to be better, the room to be clean, and the butler to arrange everything properly. The one who was assigned this time was their manager, whose surname was Chen. He contacted us by phone one day in advance, added WeChat, and gave us some documents for reference. He was very warm and thoughtful! Also very attentive. If you have anything to do, you can tell her on WeChat and everything will basically be arranged. There are some hotel activities in the package that need to be booked in advance. Unfortunately, our family has no plan and they are all decided on the spur of the moment. But basically it went smoothly and the hotel staff coordinated everything. There are two restaurants in the hotel, one Chinese and one Western. I personally recommend the Chinese restaurant, which is in the castle. The service is pretty good and the food is okay. After the meal, we went to Yu Village down the mountain to eat, go shopping, and eat local dishes. Overall, it felt pretty good and worth a visit. Thank you again to Manager Chen and the manager of the activity center (she was super awesome for participating in the handicraft activity). Be patient, nice~)

msg:It can be said that naked Valley and naked Castle took all my happiness during my trip to Mogan Mountain! The taste of Naked Heart Zhonglu is not overwhelming, but the French pudding is more exquisite. The Naked Leaf Spa trea**ent is very long and saves me, a lazy person, from the tedious steps of cleansing my face. You can enjoy the scenery, soak in the pool, and take photos in the room. You can also go out of the room to play activities, get close to the pony Mocha, and check in to the cliff swimming pool. It is recommended not to go to the surrounding Yu Village and Yiyuan Farm. Yu Village is so small that it only takes 5 minutes to complete a circle [face covering]. The 88 yuan ticket for Yiyuan Farm is just a scam for "underage" lambs, and the adult cows are too lazy to pay attention to you! It’s really not as engaging as the free ponies feeding event in Naked Valley.

There are too many room types in the hotel, all on the hillside, with shuttle bus and butler service. Excellent service.

If you want to pick faults, the Chinese restaurant is expensive, so I give it four stars; the afternoon tea is okay; the dinner is at the western restaurant, which is called French cuisine, so I can only give it three stars. The breakfast is so-so, no surprises or joys, no favorite food, bread and cakes look unappetizing.

The infinity swimming pool is heated and is too small. It is enough for me to live in this place for one day.

The upstairs guest room and the downstairs living room activity area are suitable for gatherings of relatives and friends. Due to the family's birthday, the manager Xiao Chen also arranged the room in advance and prepared cakes and birthday noodles. The old man's legs and feet are inconvenient, but the shuttle bus arrangement was very timely. The food in the Chinese restaurant was also appreciated by the family. All the staff I met were very warm and thoughtful, making it a perfect experience.

msg:Taking the elderly and children on a trip during the staggered peak period, I deliberately chose naked Castle Moganshan with beautiful scenery and fresh air for vacation. The day before the arrival, the housekeeper contacted to remind the precautions, inform the route and provide suggestions for the itinerary and items to visit This time, the housekeeper, Xiao Chen, also upgraded the Cliff Suite for free. Even if you stay in the room, you can see beautiful scenery even if you don’t go out to play, and you will be greeted by fresh air. The Castle Chinese Restaurant is very recommended. The dishes in it are in terms of the restaurants in many tourist attractions I have been to. The food here is very good. We stayed for four days, and we ate there for lunch and dinner every day. After eating Meals can be sent back to the room by the shuttle bus, or you can walk while enjoying the scenery and exercising. The shuttle bus inside is very convenient, even if it is a dozen steps away, you can arrange a shuttle bus😀, which is very suitable for the elderly to visit. Finally, I would like to give special thanks to my housekeeper, Xiao Chen. In the past few days, not only has he arranged all our play requests carefully and considerately, but the information has been replied in almost seconds, even after work. The child had a cold and fever on the third day, and I went down the mountain because I didn’t come by car. It was a bit troublesome to buy medicine. The housekeeper Xiao Chen gave us his own antipyretic medicine, which really solved a big problem for me. Otherwise, it would be even more troublesome for the child to have a fever in the middle of the night. Thank you very much! 🙏In short, this is a very satisfying vacation with food, accommodation and transportation!

The housekeeper, Xiao Cai, added WeChat one day in advance, and carefully informed the hotel's address, recommended attractions and food around. In addition, the most gratifying thing is that the room was upgraded to a cliff view suite for free, and enjoyed the beautiful scenery of the top of Mogan Mountain for two days. During the stay, the butler has always provided services enthusiastically and responsibly, and prepared exquisite souvenirs before leaving. Give naked Castle a big thumbs up for its meticulous service! There is no need to comment on the hardware facilities of the hotel, the experience is great!

On the first day, take a break
Arranged to visit the whole castle 🏰
The manager gave us a detailed introduction to the time when the owner of the castle was built
And the story of how the founder of the naked Group discovered and developed this primitive mountain forest ~ very interesting
The interior decoration of the castle is very art deco style, which is very in line with my aesthetics~ It should be very romantic to hold a wedding here~

This time I was also fortunate to visit 5 suites with different themes. It was very interesting. Each suite has its own theme! You can live in a different room next time~

The dinner was arranged in the Chinese restaurant of the Fortress Building in the castle. I ordered some dishes casually, and the taste was very good~

On the second day, outdoor activities such as hiking, archery, bowling and mountain biking were arranged, but due to the heavy rain ~, they were unfortunately canceled
~It’s okay, I’ll try again next time~

The infinity pool is indeed very attractive! It's a pity that the children are sick and can't go into the water ~ it is also a must-experience activity next time ~
Finally, I arranged indoor activities for the children to make stone-ground tofu and bake~
The children are very happy!

I ordered lunch at the naked heart western restaurant, and the taste is also very good~
Tell me a little detail~
That is, they provide a lot of vegetarian and vegetable foods, such as fried vegetables with plant meat, and plant meat hamburgers ~ I feel that they are very consistent with their naked naked heart and return to nature. They pay attention to ingredients and nutritional balance and are conducive to nature and environmental protection ~

The toiletries in the room are also essential oil aromatherapy products, because I like natural products, so everything here is very satisfactory. The only thing is that the time is tight and I can’t stay for a few more days~

Finally, I look forward to the next naked trip~

Because I came to Moganshan to celebrate my boyfriend’s birthday, I chose the best Naked Castle in Moganshan. The first time I came, there were many surprises. On the day of check-in, our bed was already decorated with beautiful plants "Happy Birthday". I am very moved and thank the hotel for its hard work. The restaurant of the hotel prepared a birthday cake for us, and also helped me prepare a surprise for my boyfriend and sing birthday songs, which was very warm. And the western food of Naked Heart is very orthodox!

Living here in naked Castle has complete entertainment facilities. The room manager Crystal helped us arrange is very close to the swimming pool, which is very caring. With warm and thoughtful service throughout, naked Castle is worth the price! The scenery, service, and the combination of nature and high-end homestay are very suitable for families or couples.

msg:If you go to Moganshan, you must stay at naked Castle.
Its predecessor was the castle built by Scottish missionary doctor Mei Tenggen. Located on the top of Mogan Mountain at an altitude of 800 meters, it overlooks the panorama of Mogan Mountain.
The European-style castle on the top of the mountain is the landmark of naked Castle. When you check in, the front desk will give you a map. There are many online celebrity check-in points throughout the hotel, which is very fun.
Picture 1 was taken overlooking the hotel from Mogan Mountain.
Figure 2 is the hotel reception center. After arriving at the hotel, a car will come and pick up the guests to the reception center for check-in. The day before check-in, there will be a young lady who calls. After adding Mia, the lady at the front desk, to WeChat, you can use WeChat while you are in the hotel, and you can make arrangements at any time, which is very convenient. It is equivalent to one-on-one service of butler.
Figure 3 is the interior of the room. Many welcome snacks and drinks are free.
Figure 4 The exterior of the room. The winding path leads to a secluded place, and the scenery is very beautiful.
Figure 5 shows various internet celebrity attractions in the hotel, including Naked Heart Autumn Dry. The small mountain road at the naked swing can lead directly to Mogan Mountain, and it takes about 400 steps to get there. But Moganshan tickets still need to be bought. Someone checks the ticket at the exit of the steps.
Figure 6 shows the swimming pool and naked heart restaurant. Naked Heart Restaurant is the place to have breakfast. Western food is also usually provided. There is also a fort restaurant on the roof of the castle, and meals must be reserved in advance.
Figures seven and eight are all inside the castle. After turning on the lights at night, the path leading to the castle is romantic and beautiful. After dinner, you can enjoy the sunset at the castle.

The resort has everything you need, entertainment facilities, tea-picking activities, basically you don’t need to go out to visit the scenic spots!

msg:Came with high expectations, but the experience was very average. The front desk service is average, there is no butler service, all needs are contacted by phone, and the phone in the room cannot be called, so we have to contact our mobile phone. The room in Tianyuan Xiaoju is compact, and a family of three could barely fit in and didn't sleep well. I am reminded to check the makeup mirror in the bathroom in our room. It is suspected that there is a leakage of electricity. There is slight numbness and electric current when touching the mirror. We communicated on the phone once before checking in and asked for our license plate number, but we were stopped at the first checkpoint into the mountain. We said that the license plate should have been reported in advance, but the little brother still said angrily that we had to check it. Let’s talk about catering. The Chinese food in Fortress House has service charges and taxes. A can of coconut water costs 35 yuan. Although the environment here is not good, I was still surprised haha. If the room rate includes breakfast, let's go for breakfast. If it doesn't, the price of more than 180 per person is not worth it. All in all, it was a short trip with a bad experience. I arrived at 7 o'clock on the night of check-in and checked out at 10 o'clock the next day. I didn't expect much.

The thirteen little brother at the front desk enthusiastically helped us upgrade the room, and helped us to book a table during our stay, and provided us with tour guides. We also gave a pair of mugs when we left the store. We chose the color that the children like. , is very considerate. The design of the hotel's castle is impressive, and there is an introduction to the historical origin on the basement floor, which makes it easy to live. The view from the Cliff View Room is beautiful, drink tea to watch the sunset, and take blockbuster movies casually. The hotel is also very convenient to go to the Moganshan scenic spot. You can walk through an iron gate and walk up the stone steps to the ferry station in the scenic spot. No one checks the ticket in the off-season. The ticket I booked online was refunded... Personally, I think the fly in the oin**ent is There is only 1 Chinese restaurant and 1 Western restaurant. The Western food at night only provides French set menus. Many dishes are cooked with wine, so I can only bring children to Chinese food for dinner. The food is served slowly, but the taste is good. I would like to thank all the staff I came into contact with during the stay. They are enthusiastic and patient. They especially respect the children. They can respond positively to the children's thoughts and will not ignore them as talking to themselves. I am very touched.

There was a dedicated person (Miss Mia) who assisted us from going up the mountain to reception to accommodation. It was very worry-free . The hotel is built on the top of the mountain, facing the abyss, with a wide view, combined with the rustling bamboo sea on the mountain, it makes people feel calm.
The castle is also very interesting, and the service staff is very thoughtful. The activities of the spring package are replaced by other services that I don't need. The afternoon tea was very rich, and there were gifts at the hotel before leaving, which was also a surprise.
All in all, the experience is great, I highly recommend it, and I am very grateful to Ms. Mia, the housekeeper!

Watching the sunrise and sunset, sitting on the balcony and blowing the mountain breeze, it feels great to watch the mountains and mountains! There are also archery played by children, lawn bowling, feeding rabbits and experiencing stone-ground tofu are very interesting! The dinner at the Fort Tower is okay, but the breakfast is very average! The wontons are hard and raw, the coffee tastes mediocre, the fruit is rotten, and I haven’t replenished it in time. The children couldn’t get a piece of watermelon. The venue is very small and crowded, there are few varieties, the quality is average, and the taste is average. The prices don't match, the table is small, and no one comes to collect the used plates. The room facilities are also old and can't be compared with many new hotels! Finally, some staff in the hotel seem to have forgotten that guests are buying accommodation and services, and providing high-quality services is the foundation of hotel management, but they just persist in asking for five-star praise, completely disregarding the feelings of guests, which makes people feel uncomfortable Feel bad! In short, naked Castle's location and scenery are indeed very advantageous, and the holiday a**osphere is also very good, but the breakfast and service need to be improved!

After I reported my name, I was allowed to enter. This is very good, not casual Let it go, which is also a safety guarantee for our guests. After a meeting, we went to the parking lot of naked Castle. It is very user-friendly. There are 4 free charging piles, which are very helpful for our tram customers. The security guard at the parking lot arranged for the hotel car to pick us up the mountain to check in. This is also very good. When we arrive, the car will come to pick us up directly. We won’t make us wait for a long time in the cold weather. Then we went to the reception desk in the lobby. We were greeted by The little girl Chen Li, a very beautiful girl, is very polite and has a very good attitude. I learned that we have reserved 2 rooms, one of which is a rural room far away from the cliff. She thoughtfully upgraded my door for free. The cliff room made me feel very happy and lucky. Next, I carefully introduced some dining times and activities of the hotel to us. It was very considerate. After checking in, I waited directly at the door of the car and took us to the room. The scenery along the way It's really beautiful. I'm really happy to open the door when I arrive at the room. It's very comfortable and clean. The mountain is just outside the balcony. My wife is so beautiful. When we have enough time in the afternoon, we will go to take pictures near the castle. All the waiters here are smiling and greeted warmly (Hello) No matter where you go, even if you go the wrong way, there are waiters who will give you directions and help you enthusiastically. There are swimming, billiards, yoga and other activities in the hotel, so you won't feel bored. Dinner is Western food at Naked Western restaurant. I thought the taste was similar to the outside, but I didn’t expect that this place combines the double standard of Jingmei’s delicious taste👍. On the day of the final check-out, the little girl Chen Li helped me. After checking out, I learned that someone among us gave a small gift for his birthday that day. It was really thoughtful, and we will come again next time when it is hot! 🌹🌹🌹🌹

On the terrace of the fort, you can have an afternoon tea with friends leisurely, and it is also an excellent place to watch the sunrise and sunset, and the hotel front desk will remind you of the specific time of sunrise and sunset every day.

The hotel's service staff is very nice, and the guests' requests are basically responsive.
I went there almost during the Chinese New Year, and the whole hotel can be said to be overcrowded, even the breakfast line had to be lined up, so you can imagine how many people there were.
Finally, I would like to say that I originally went for the internet celebrity lady, but as a result, the entire hotel has become a parent-child hotel, and not just one child, but two children.
The hotel is indeed very popular, my wife took countless photos, and the circle of friends also attracted countless likes.
The price of the hotel is still a bit expensive, the budget is enough, it is worth a visit.

The three of us really traveled to every corner, responsible Said, it's really fun, delicious, beautiful scenery, and comfortable, and the housekeeper is also very caring. If there is something to contact him, he is responsible for helping me even if he is not at work. He is so responsible, must praise, ten stars praise

msg:The experience is really great~ I took two children to spend a fulfilling and happy two days and one night. The procedures at the front desk were professional and fast, and the service staff in the park were thoughtful and enthusiastic. I made reservations for various amu*****t projects, one by one. , The children played too happily.

The Cliff View Suite has been upgraded, and the view is so beautiful, as soon as you enter the room, you will be enchanted by the whole beauty, all designed with large panoramic windows. There is also heating in the house, and the whole is warm. I was worried that the mountain would be humid, but after the heating, the humidity is just right, which is very suitable for children~
The breakfast at the hotel is also quite satisfactory. One bright spot is that the baked food is quite good. Other hotels often eat it with a dry taste that feels like it has been left for a long time, but the small desserts here should be crispy and waxy. Not much, but the quality is better, and the food is super full~

msg:The environment is very good, the service is very warm and sincere.

The shortcomings are mainly in the facilities:
1. For the price of the hotel, the bed is relatively hard and not comfortable enough;
2. On the night before arrival, there was no hot water until 21:30. The front desk reported that it was caused by too many people staying;
3. The food is not rich enough. Buffet prices are on the high side. The price of room delivery is high and there are few dishes. Many dishes are spicy, which is not conducive to children or people who are still recovering from the new crown.

Generally speaking, the facilities need to be improved, and some problems are too low-level (such as hot water supply for a long time), so that they are very inferior, especially considering that the housing price is not cheap.

There is no problem with the environment and service, which is an advantage. The architectural style of the hotel is very good, and it has a high degree of integration with the environment, which is unconventional. The Mogan Mountain Scenic Area is within walking distance, and there are hiking routes around it, making it more convenient to visit and play.

I booked the Cliff Residence Suite, the scenery is nothing to say, it would be better if I come in summer and autumn. The facilities are old, and the heating in winter is a bit poor, and the water temperature is not enough for bathing. The castle room was upgraded the next day. The room is indeed more luxurious, unfortunately, the temperature of the water supply is still not enough.
The Chinese restaurant in the Paotai Building, except for the price is a bit more expensive, there is nothing wrong with it.
The variety of breakfast is quite rich,
The outdoor infinity pool doesn't feel cold at all in the cold winter.

When you arrive at the hotel, the staff will guide you to park the car, and then arrange a shuttle bus to take you to check-in. The lady at the front desk introduced the general situation and facilities of the hotel in detail, and also gave you a map as a souvenir. The mountain road is trembling, and the shuttle bus is small My brother drove very smoothly and helped carry the luggage to the room. After settling in, I wandered around the hotel. Every staff member I met could feel their enthusiasm and dedication to service. Fortunately, the weather during the stay was very good. I saw the sunset and sunrise in the room. If it snows, watching the snow in the mountains from the balcony should be an even more memorable experience.

The phone calls from the front desk and the activity center before the reservation were quite indifferent, and they almost persuaded me to leave, so it needs to be strengthened~

When you come to Moganshan, you must stay in the naked castle, start the castle dream trip, you must stay in the cliff view room, and talk about the hotel's service, of course, it is very good, read the comments before you come. I was still worried, but found that the service was great and the waiters were very enthusiastic. Secondly, let’s talk about the food and beverages, and praise the Chinese restaurant in Fortress. In the castle, the taste is very good. I recommend Snowflake beef. I don’t know why the food is eaten, but it is quite in line with the taste of Jiangnan people like us, and it is recommended. The Western restaurant Naked Taste is our breakfast. There are many kinds of breakfast. It is the breakfast standard of a star-rated hotel. It is ok. The main feature is the beautiful scenery of naked taste. The swimming pool, the infinity swimming pool that is boasting, looks good no matter how you take it, it is a blockbuster. The constant temperature does not feel cold, and it is recommended. The toiletries in the room are also complete. The cliff view room with a balcony and a bathtub is very good. The videos and photos are very good, and the fairies like it. The comfort is also good, and it is suitable to come here to meditate. Anyway, I love it very much, it is worth coming, it is much better than the so-called Internet celebrity homestay.

The naked castle is still very suitable for viewing. The mountains in the distance overlap, reflecting the sunset and the golden clouds. The whole thing is refreshing!
Service attitude is very good! Basically what you need!
No downsides other than being expensive.
Some events and buffets are only available on Friday and Saturday when there are many people, so the price will be higher…
Because it is a family, you can go to the valley to play in the fort.
The overall experience is still very good! Suitable for next time!

Turn on the heating and open a window to soak in comfort. The castle is very beautiful inside and outside, and I can't think of other words except beautiful and comfortable T_T. There will be a shuttle bus between the naked castle and the valley. I went to the valley to ride a horse, and there is a small pony that children can ride, which is very cute. After coming back, I will go to the heated swimming pool to see the distant scenery. There is a dressing room and shower room next to it, which is very convenient. The swimming pool is really good for girls! There are also archery, spa, etc. I haven't experienced yet. In short, this stay is very pleasant! Recommend everyone to come.

I booked a 9,000-odd owner’s suite and went to the front desk to check in. I suddenly said that dogs are not allowed in our room type. During the communication with the front desk, the service staff’s attitude was very poor and they didn’t deal with the problem. I went out of my way to make me change the room. It’s very poor. The poor-quality cliff-view suite outside said that the time was adjusted and I was asked to help the master suite take pictures? ? ? Isn't that humiliating? We have been waiting at the front desk for a long time and have not dealt with it. The micro expressions of the front desk staff are disgusting! The manager came forward and checked in with our pets to book a room type under our reasonable insistence (but dogs are not allowed to appear in the dining and swimming areas)
        Entering the room, the decoration cabinets in the room are all dusty. The room service phone was not called during the check-in period. They explained that the line was busy, and then said that the network was disconnected. There are pet dogs in the restaurant and nearby. This is the reason why their hotel front desk showed a **** face when we checked in and tried to prevent us from bringing dogs in. In the end, the road to the hotel has too many curves and our dog is motion sick. After driving, the first floor of the hotel castle room is full of various wedding banquet contracts, which makes the hotel noisy and chaotic, and the check-in experience is extremely poor! ! I have stayed in so many hotels and I have never written a bad review for any hotel. This time it is too disgusting. I suggest everyone to avoid lightning and avoid pitfalls. Don’t spend money and make mistakes, which will affect your holiday mood! ****

The hotel facilities are a little old, although I already feel that the boss is trying to do a good job, but I feel that we can work harder! Various service items are gimmicky, but they are actually a bit tasteless

Advantages: clean, delicious food, room can be ordered (secondary reason for praise) few people, good scenery, pet friendly and friendly (this is the main reason for praise!) The staff of naked Valley collectively praised! Passionate and professional! All the customer service staff of naked Valley naked Fort are fluent in spoken language and friendly to the crooked nuts!
Disadvantages: The battery car is a bit slow, the swimming pool is small, the environment is average, the facilities are outdated and need to be replaced, the staff of the naked castle is loud, a little tired and impatient, the room service staff is a bit confused, not familiar with us, trees under the castle Time to prune!

To sum it up in one sentence: as long as it is not a holiday!

16 He Chuanchuan has a fat body, it can be seen that the boss is caring +1

msg:The experience is too bad. To describe it as too bad is to give face. Friends who have never been there, I sincerely recommend not to go, as it will be a surprise. The service attitude of the hotel is poor. I booked a cliff suite for one night. The room facilities are old. The toilet smells like a spilled sewer bucket. The shower head in the shower is moldy. The sound insulation of the room is separated by wooden boards. I can hear the sound coming from next door. It is clear that there is no private space at all. The roof will make clanking noises from time to time. The cleaning lady next door comes to clean the door early in the morning. The noisy noise makes it impossible to have a good rest. This is how the room costs more than 4,000 yuan a night. experience? We are going on vacation, not for military training. The floor in the room was also loose and creaked when I walked lightly. The bathtub was dirty and the paint was peeling off. Let's talk about the service attitude. The hotel's attitude is to give you souvenirs. We can't solve the other problems. Anyway, you have already checked in. It feels like a forced sale. Anyway, after you paid for the room, the deposit was also deducted, which is more than 4,000 yuan. The night's room charge was for a public restroom. There was only a wooden board between rooms 2507 and 2508, which was scary. Are you embarrassed to sell it so expensively? What a scam. After the housekeeper came to the room and confirmed these problems, he asked us to go to the front desk to solve the problem. He said that he had told Manager Chen about this situation and would give you a satisfactory answer. When we arrived at the front desk, the staff said that the manager was in a meeting. Just leave us alone and continue to receive other guests. What problem did you ask us to solve during the meeting? After waiting for half an hour, no one came out to solve the problem. We were asked to find Ctrip. In order to earn the room fee, we really didn’t need word of mouth. I went to Naked Heart Restaurant for the scenery. I arrived at around six o'clock. I couldn't see the scenery outside at all. I could only see myself reflected in the glass. I was really drunk. It's all a gimmick. There is a 10% service charge. A steak costs more than 500 🥩The meat is tender. What kind of steak did you sell to us? ? The quality was not as good as Hema's steak. I called the chef and they said that because they were in the mountains, the steaks were all frozen. What was the reason for this? Where is the conscience of you naked Castle merchants? ? ? I sincerely recommend that friends don’t go into this trap. The room costing more than 4,000 per night is the same as that of an express hotel. I don’t know where your good reviews come from!

msg:When I came to Moganshan in leisure, I came across naked Castle by chance and went there with pleasure. Along the road, there are many secluded scorpions, the insects are singing sweetly, and the mountain road is winding, so you need to move slowly. The cliffside huts are scattered on the roadside, clean and comfortable. The wooden table, wooden bed and wooden chair are completely integrated with the environment. When you stay, you will put your heart here...
Go out in simple clothes, bathe in the fragrance of sweet-scented osmanthus, watch the tenderness of the ancient castle, taste the delicious tea, and relax in the infinity pool along the way, which is extremely comfortable. The service is never intrusive and ubiquitous. When you swim ashore, the hot towel handed over will warm your heart and lungs.
When you are tired, come here to relax and feel the beauty of the world~

Staying in the Mid-Autumn Festival, the bright moon is full of stars at night, which is shocking. The landmark building, the ancient castle, is very distinctive. It is both a symbol and a viewing platform. It is worth emphasizing the service. Although the travel basically depends on the battery car, the efficiency of the housekeeper is still very high. The service from the front desk restaurant to the fortress is meticulous and friendly. The girl Song Song, whom I contacted in the early stage, is quite reassuring to do things. Later, he also helped to introduce our family to the history of the castle, which was great. In addition, naked Fort and naked valley can be visited interactively, and there is a commuter car, which is a good additional benefit.

The mountain view and the castle view are good. The cliff view suite has a good view from the window and a large area of mountain view.
Service: The reception attitude of the hotel staff is good, polite and friendly. The lady in the western restaurant also taught how to take swimming pool photos, which is very enthusiastic.
Facilities: The deduction is mainly for eating, which is really low cost performance and not delicious. I didn't experience some of the small items in the package, and the lady replaced it with others, thank you very much.
The effect of the infinity pool is good, although the pool is not big, but after all, it is ok to match the mountain view on the mountain.
Hygiene: The hygiene of the room is OK.
Overall, the price/performance ratio is not high, it should be a one-time experience for me. If you haven't been there, you can go and take pictures.

msg:The environment is really good, winding all the way up, and the scenery on both sides is very beautiful. After seeing it on the spot, I replaced the small courtyard with a cliff view, just to have a glimpse of the beautiful scenery. Although the service is responsive, the shuttle bus is really very, very slow, and it is better to walk a few steps by yourself when you wait. There are two kinds of food, Chinese food and Western food. The standard of Chinese food is generally not worthy of the price of the food. The standard of Western food is medium and high but there are few types. I don't want to go out on a typhoon day and stay in the hotel to eat. I am not very satisfied. Finally, when it comes to the most unsatisfactory hygiene, we came with a baby. The baby chairs in the restaurant are the dirtiest I have ever seen. When cleaning, the chairs in the two dining rooms actually have something similar to oil stains from food. The children's play room is not bad, enough to play, but there are more hairy and other dirty things on the ground. I don't know how often to clean it? In general, it's okay for couples to travel or take the elderly at home to watch the scenery, but it is not recommended if you take a baby.

Therefore, this summer, I decided to go for a light-luxury surrounding tour. Although there were some twists and turns at the start, as the car approached Moganshan, the instrument panel showed the falling outdoor temperature (10 degrees lower than Shanghai), and the mood became more cheerful. The castle built on the top of Mogan Mountain not only has a mysterious and exotic style, but also has a unique geographical location surrounded by green mountains and green waters. The chic cliff restaurant, the infinity heated swimming pool, the romantic European-style castle, the comfortable cliff-view suites, the sumptuous Chinese and Western delicacies, and the considerate butler service make "naked castle" the most popular resort in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. "Naked Heart" means to regain the passion and simplicity of the original heart, return to nature, enjoy family and friendship, and regain the balance of body and mind in simple happiness. Isn't that what travel is all about?

msg:If you are lucky enough to read this review, I suggest you choose another hotel. The service and facilities are not worthy of his price.
There are 4 families in our group, including two children. It took three years for the epidemic to finally make an appoin**ent. When everyone is free, we came to Moganshan once. We chose naked Castle after thousands of choices. Looking at the promotional photos of the hotel, Looking at the four-bedroom villa, I felt that it was a detached house with a very good view from the window, so I decided to make a reservation. When we arrived at the hotel, the hotel was very considerate and told us that we were upgraded to a five-bedroom villa because we were traveling with two children. We were very happy at the time and felt that the hotel was very humane. ignorance. This room type is called Mulan Courtyard. Friends who hope to see it stay carefully. After we got to the room, we were very disappointed. This room is on the same main road as another room. There is no yard in front of the door. There is a corridor leading to the back. There is no sun at all in the small courtyard. There are 5 rooms and 2 are outside, one of which cannot be exposed to the sun at all, and the other one can only be reached through the courtyard. At that time, there was no other way except disappoin**ent. Almost, I just felt that more than 10,000 yuan a night was not worth it. When I was about to wash up at night, I realized how poor the shower equipment in the room was. The water from the shower was as small as tears, there were hairs on the wall, the ceiling was cracked, and the living room was smelly. The stench, the sewer blockage and the smell, and the engineering depar**ent came several times, telling us that it must not be fixed tonight. At this time, we suggested to the hotel that we should change back to a 4-bedroom villa. This is the key point. , it turns out that the 4-bedroom villas in the hotel are oversold. There are no 4-bedroom villas anymore, and the hotel manager is no longer there. The manager on duty told us that it would be too much for one night to change to a 3-bedroom villa. Room 4 will only be available tomorrow. After negotiating all night, finally on the second day, we were given back to the original 4 room called Gaoshan Courtyard. We were surprised when we got to room 4. The view in front of the window was much better. The room facilities are also much better. Most of the whole trip was spent changing rooms, waiting for the room, and it was not until 3 pm the next day that we officially settled in the room we originally booked, and we had to check out at noon on the third day. Although the hotel has made up for the first day's room rate, the wasted time and the unpleasantness of the trip cannot be made up for by the hotel. Here is a reminder to friends who can read this article, not all hotel upgrades are well-intentioned.
Hygiene: very poor, there is hair in the bathroom, and the floor is dusty.
Environment: Depends on the room, Mulan Courtyard is a mess, don't stay here. The restaurant is also very old. In addition to taking pictures, you can tell how old it is at a glance.
Facilities: facilities are very old
Service: The waiters all feel like interns, and there is no manager on duty. If you have any questions, ask the waiter, saying that they have all gone to eat, but no one handles it. Simply speechless. Waiting for half an hour for the shuttle bus is commonplace. Those who can walk can walk by themselves. When returning to the room from the parking lot, you have to wait for the bus, which lasts for half an hour.

I can only stand on my feet and don't want to leave the office. What's more speechless is that it is 108,000 miles away from the castle. Called a car and waited for 40 minutes. It was not easy to go down the mountain. For dinner, I had to queue for two hours at the castle. Because the next table that didn’t order expensive was finished, we didn’t cook our food. Others watched while we were eating. , I feel very disgusted and embarrassed, the service didn't greet us, it was disgusting, I kept crying with a child, and finally I paid a 10% service fee and 10% tax for a meat bill. Fei, I really want to ask the company, the tax agency, the dog stuff service, the most annoying experience, there is no cost-effectiveness to speak of, and a big moth flew at night and said to call someone to catch us. In the end, is there anyone who will take care of us,  … I don't want to talk about a series of questions.

She is more than a dozen or 20 times 😂 really very patient and thoughtful. Other staff members are also full of details wherever they go🤭🤭🤭 Secondly, the environment is really fried chicken! ! The castle and themed room that I miss in my heart are really the same as the online pictures 🤭 I took hundreds of photos when the super film was released 🥰 It’s just that the time is a bit rushed, and many places and projects have not had time to check in next time. The feeling of green eyes is really great. When we checked in, the weather was not good. It just rained. I was still thinking about whether it would be bad to take pictures or experience the infinity pool. As a result, Tiangong was so beautiful that it didn’t go down after arriving at the hotel. happy Great satisfaction 🤭 It's really too hasty. Next time, I must check in slowly and try to take a lot of photos. Finally, thank you again for all the staff including Xiao Chen. 🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️🧚🏻‍♀️

msg:Family stay. A group of 4 of us originally booked a two-bedroom courtyard for 8,000 per night for two nights. When we checked in, probably because of the epidemic, we only had another one to stay on that day, and we were upgraded to a 1w3/night three-bedroom courtyard. It was a surprise.
Because of the comfortable stay and the desire to visit the mountain scenery, we stayed for another night. We stayed here for four days and three nights in total. With a very leisurely and slow lifestyle, the vacation index was full.

Room facilities: The two-story building and the three rooms are similar in layout. The room area is not large, but the living room, kitchen and activity room on the first floor have a total interior area of more than 250 square meters, which is also very spacious and comfortable. In the yard, in addition to the long table, round table, chairs and barbecue, there is also a flowing outdoor hot spring pool unexpectedly, which must be soaked every night, awesome~
The details of the decoration style are very tasteful. I like the fireplace in the living room very much. The next day I played with it because of the sudden cooling, which was very pleasant.
The only thing I'm not satisfied with is that the toiletries provided in the room are relatively general. At this price, the supplies are too cheap.

Service: After experiencing the whole stay in the hotel, the service is probably the place that needs to be complained the most. When I checked in at the front desk, I felt that the waiter's response was stiff and dull, and the details were not in place. The quality of the room cleaning staff was ok, but the first day cleaning was a bit flawed (forgot to add tea bags). But overall, it is still responsive, barely within the acceptable range.

Breakfast: Breakfast is served at Naked Western Restaurant. Due to the epidemic, it is currently in a semi-self-service form (hot food order + cold food self-service). We also had dinner at this restaurant during our stay, the portion is not much, but the taste is very 🉑. Then the waiter in the restaurant is not bad in comparison~

Location: The hotel is located on Baotou, one of the hills of Mogan Mountain. The scenery is amazing. We can see a bamboo sea from the Weisock courtyard where we live, and next to it is the path leading to Baibuling and Moganshan Scenic Area. Almost every day, I go to the mountains for a walk and visit the scenic spots. During the few days I stayed, it happened to be rainy and sunny, and the various scenery was still unfinished.

The overall experience is very good, and I will most likely stay here again in the future~

Lareina Li Tingting at the front desk of naked Castle contacted me before I checked in. All kinds of patient and enthusiastic services are comparable to butler style The service made me continue to live again immediately. I was really moved to experience this kind of high-quality service. I didn't expect that there would be no such service in many international chain five-star hotels, and I can really feel it here. This makes me very satisfied with the training and management system of Naked Castle Resort Hotel, I really feel at home

Pushing open the window, the field of vision is extremely wide, and I can see the undulating mountains in the distance.
It has super five-star service and the ultimate luxury vacation experience. From the moment of booking, there is a room manager who serves me throughout the whole process. Hoody is the one who serves me, who is online 24 hours a day, super caring and comprehensive. There is floor heating in the room, and I am in a good mood while drinking afternoon tea on the balcony and enjoying the beautiful mountain view. Although it is winter, the cliff infinity pool is still at a constant temperature of 26 degrees, so you can take a dip in the water. The Fortress Chinese Restaurant in the castle offers Cantonese and Hangzhou dishes for dinner. Although the price is expensive, it tastes good. Anyway, I will come here again next time for vacation!

The next day, the snow closed the mountain, so I could see the momentum and magnificence of the castle in the snow. The landscape restaurant and the heated infinity pool are also very well designed, maximizing the integration of the building into the mountains and forests, and every place reveals the careful thought of vacation. The staff is also very dedicated. During the Chinese New Year, the Chinese restaurant also provides zero-point, not compulsory set menus, which reflects the full preparation of the restaurant. The secret room suite in the appointed castle, a large terrace on the cliff allows the children to enjoy two days of snow fun. One suggestion: it would be better if the toilet could be replaced with an automatic flush.

msg:After considering the reasons for the epidemic, the elderly and children, and the weather, I chose the Moganshan naked castle, which will not be boring even in the hotel. Winter is the off-season in Moganshan, but the hotel occupancy rate is still quite high. Although the rainy days made the famous beauty of naked Castle fleeting in the rainy and foggy weather, and many outdoor activities could not be carried out, the types and number of naked indoor activities were abundant, and there was no shortage of food in Internet celebrity western restaurants and Chinese restaurants. , The standard is high, the old castle suite is warm and comfortable, and fruit and red wine are also presented. On the second day of the stay, there was a heavy snowfall in the ancient castle. Snowmen and snowball fights allowed the children in the south to experience the joy of the north again. When checking out, the shuttle bus was temporarily unavailable due to snow on the road. The little housekeepers carried their luggage in the snow, and the snow-sweeping staff escorted the old man down the mountain all the way. Therefore, the off-season tourism and bad weather can still give guests a warm, comfortable and pleasant stay experience, which shows the high management level of the hotel. I heard that the most beautiful seasons of the castle are spring and autumn. I hope that the next time I will come again, it will be a sunny day and enjoy the beauty of the top of the mountain.

Before departure, we will help us confirm whether we need nucleic acid, reserve a parking space, and upgrade to a cliff view suite, which not only enjoys a good view, but also greatly improves the living comfort.
I learned that the manager of the small gathering for my friend's anniversary also arranged arrangements and desserts. The next day my friend had a sour stomach after drinking and sent freshly boiled white porridge. Knowing that our girls love to take pictures, they also specially arranged rose petals.
It was a worthwhile trip, and I would like to thank Manager Song Cong for adding a lot to this trip. I look forward to going to Naked Castle to experience the spring in the next year.
🚗 Transportation: It is very convenient to park by car, and the hotel has reserved a parking space.
🍃Environment: Wonderful as always.

The naked Fort implements scenic management. Self-driving vehicles must be parked in the parking lot and then picked up by special battery cars. It is especially worth mentioning that the duty manager Chen Li, please contact us in advance to understand our itinerary, Needs, take the initiative to help us design the itinerary, recommend good places around, the service is very considerate. The breakfast is very rich, the dishes are not inferior to the first-tier hotels, and the dishes of the Chinese restaurant in Fortress Building are also very delicious. In addition to the excellent natural environment, naked Castle also has historical and cultural heritage. Apart from leisure and vacation, it is like taking a vivid history lesson. It is worth improving that the hot water in the shower room is relatively small, it is not convenient to take a bath, the faucet design of the washbasin is unreasonable, and it is recommended to add a place to put a mobile phone in the bathroom. Although there are regrets in this trip, I am quite satisfied overall. I will have the opportunity to find a good weather to come back in midsummer.

Arrived 2 hours from Shanghai by car. This time I stayed in the cliff view room. The room was clean and tidy. Think, let the impetuous heart return to calm.

Now in the off-season, wherever you go, it's like a private venue. The western restaurant is under renovation. You can eat in the Chinese restaurant in the Fortress Building. You can enjoy playing table tennis, billiards, and darts in the entertainment room. You don't need to go down the mountain.

Meals: I have stayed in many hotels. The restaurant of the hotel is self-evident. During my stay, I have eaten at Goldfish Mama, Ohua's store, etc., and I feel that there is no special feature. I ate two meals in the Fortress Building. Low, and the amount is quite large, as a Fujianese, the mouth is quite picky, the taste is very good, foodie

Highlights:
The hotel service is on call, and the round-the-clock butler @Miss Chen Li is attentive. She added WeChat when registering at the front desk. She solved the problem in time during the check-in, which was not encountered in other hotels. Give her a thumbs up! ! ! The hotel is located on the mountain and there is an electric trolley to pick up and drop off. When I left, I also gave a mug as a souvenir. There are many hotels and famous hotels in Moganshan. The naked Fort is a hotel worth bringing family and friends to stay again. I look forward to meeting you next time!

The scenery is superb, just look at the photos, I will focus on the service experience of this hotel: a beautiful housekeeper named Chen at naked Castle called and added WeChat one day in advance to inform them of the check-in and epidemic prevention requirements during the epidemic. And I was very considerate to offer room upgrades. The price of 3,000 was directly increased to more than 5,000 cliff view suites. According to the fashionable algorithm, I spent 3,000 and the hotel gave more than 2,000. This does not mean that I basically don’t spend money. NS! ? 🤣🤣🤣 The butler gave detailed tour suggestions. He made the arrangements for the two days and one night clearly, and during the subsequent stay, the butler has been actively asking me if I have anything to solve. It is really intimate. NS! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 The other service staff of the hotel are also serious, responsible and polite, which reflects the service standard of this class of hotel! After checking out, the butler suggested that I go to Naked Valley for a visit, so I registered the car number and went there.

Whether you are lying on the bed, standing on the balcony, or sitting in the restaurant, you can see the mountains of Mogan Mountain. The best view belongs to the naked castle!
Except for the more expensive, there is nothing else to fault, but the price is one or two thousand more than ordinary homestays. It should be said that naked Castle's pricing is already very conscientious. After all, the operating cost is far more than that of ordinary homestays by countless times. .
What I want to admire is the cultural heritage of Naked Castle. As the Moganshan No. 1 of the year, it is really worthy of NO1 👍

When she learned that it was my birthday, she also upgraded the room for me for free. The dinner prepared cakes and longevity noodles for me. I prepared a rose bath for me. I must like it. I was really shocked when I walked into the naked castle. Any one shot is a beautiful oil painting, especially the outdoor heated swimming pool with a view of the mountain scenery, which is refreshing. The staff in the activity center also provided hot black tea for our swimming guests. How could I be willing to leave with such beautiful scenery and hotel services, I immediately decided to stay one more day, and the housekeeper, Ms. Chen Li, helped me to coordinate and arrange everything. The experience of staying in is that there is a butler follow-up service throughout the whole process, and the warm weather reminders are carefully arranged. It is a great experience. Naked Castle is still the first choice for Moganshan in the future.

msg:The naked castle on the top of Mount Mogan is a good place for meditation, oxygen inhalation, and a few days of leisure.
In all fairness, a hotel in a deep mountain and an old forest cannot have the same requirements as a hotel in a big city. As far as the hotels on the hills and cliffs are concerned, naked Castle does a very good job. Compared with the Bird's Nest or equivalent hotel I have ever stayed in, it is much better in terms of design, management, and service.
No matter the hotel lobby, the western food Chinese restaurant and the entertainment hall, they are all tastefully designed, with the taste of European castles, like being in Europe, romantic and classical with history.
Special praise for the good service of the butler Aven. From the beginning of my booking, I added me on WeChat, told me how to go, and introduced the hotel's service facilities and so on. After I checked in, Avent knew that it was cold today, we turned on the heating and dried it, and sent a humidifier specially. What was particularly pleasantly surprised was that the hotel upgraded the cliff room for us, which made our journey an extra surprise.

Miss Angela gave a detailed and professional introduction to the naked vacation series. Let me put naked vacation on the agenda. On the top of the Mogan Mountain, take a dip in the heated infinity pool, enjoy a glass of champagne on the balcony of the suite, and enjoy the ultimate beauty in the suite’s large bathtub. In naked food, Mr. Lou, the restaurant manager, provides almost perfect service, and naked meals are exquisite. Miss Lucy and Brother Henry Yang in the activity center gave us family-like service, making us feel like we are going home. The front desk lady's communication during the stay and the souvenir of Manager Chen's check out. Is the reason to stay again.

The hardware and software of the hotel are very happy and super first-class, welcome, reception, luggage service, catering service, room service , The services of other experiential activities and check-out services are all perfect, with basically no deductions. Through this staying experience, I already have a good impression of the naked series of hotels. I am especially grateful to Manager Chen Li for his warm reception and help.

msg:Huzhou should be a great choice for self-driving tours in the surrounding area. A resort hotel that I collected very early, it is really comfortable to travel at the wrong peak.
🚗 Transportation:
This place is very suitable for self-driving travel. The navigation is very accurate and you can directly locate the hotel parking lot, which is the eighteenth bend of the mountain road. You must pay attention to safety when driving. There are more blind spots and you must pay attention to the traffic from the opposite side. The hotel has a gate entrance, after passing here, you need to drive up for a while to reach the end 🏁

🔔Service:
The service Xiaochen at the front desk is very nice and caring. When making a reservation, he told Jimei that the young lady at the hotel has a very nice voice haha. The hotel rooms are scattered, and there will be a shuttle bus to pick up and drop off, which is very convenient. The hotel depar**ent actually has a lot of things, and I really have to praise it. No matter the restaurant, shuttle bus or other employees I meet, they are very enthusiastic and have a very comfortable service experience.

🍃Environment:
The viewing angle of the guest room is very good, the area is relatively large, you can clearly see the beautiful scenery outside the window when lying on the sofa. The castle is very historical. There is an introduction to the history of the castle, so you can take a good look.

🍝Dining:
The hotel is in Shantou, and the prices are still relatively high. For meals, there are Chinese restaurants and western restaurants. The western restaurant is also a place for breakfast, and the Chinese restaurant is in the old castle. The breakfast is very rich and the taste is good. The western food I eat in the evening, thin-crust pizza is my favorite. Hainanese chicken rice is very distinctive and the chicken is tender.
A day and night holiday experience is still very good, away from the hustle and bustle of the city, come here to relax and inhale oxygen, free your brain, and have the opportunity to bring your parents to feel it.

In particular, Manager Chen Li gave me a lot of travel advice from the time I booked the room, especially when I arrived late on the day. He called us many times to ask where we were. Let us pay attention to the safety of the mountain road, which made people feel very warm. After arriving at the hotel, arranged for us to stay in Jasmine's house. In the morning, we drew up the curtains together, and the scenery of Mogan Mountain was unobstructed.
Looking forward to meeting naked Castle again!

msg:Let me talk about the uncomfortable place first:
The early bird rate was booked on 9/14. Due to Typhoon Chanthu’s impact on Shanghai and Zhejiang on the 14th, schools in Shanghai are also closed. If I drive there as planned, the risk factor is quite high. Through Ctrip and the hotel negotiated to delay the check-in to 9/16, the communication process was quite difficult, because the reservation was a non-returnable product, which was very passive. I don’t want to refund the order, I just want to delay it for free. It’s a good thing to say. The hotel reservation depar**ent is very good, either according to the contract or placing a new order before canceling the old order. Everyone knows how to place an order again, and the price is different. No way, I can only re-order, which is quite confusing.

Good thing:
There is no need to say the overall environment, the scenery on the mountain is very charming, the layout function of each place is different, the layout is harmonious, and it is beautiful. Although the room facilities are not new, the stay is very comfortable. I also have to thank the former Aven for upgrading me to the cliff-view room. Her service is very attentive. She added WeChat before departure to remind me to remind me that my previous unpleasantness disappeared. . Unfortunately, during the three days I stayed in the hotel, she rested and didn't see me, which was a little regrettable. She keeps in touch with me even if she is resting. She asks and asks warmly, and answers every question, which is touching.
After eating one lunch and two dinners at naked Castle, Ye Chenchen, a western restaurant, was very cute. He took pictures of us from different angles and took the trouble to shoot. The whole process was full of smiles and told us stories about naked Castle. It was a material food. A double feast of spiritual food.
The SAM who drives the battery car is very amiable, and the little handsome guy next door rushes to the foot 😀 I don't know if it is a coincidence or fate. I have ridden the battery car ten times in three days. He drove it for us a few times except for one time. Every time we talked about reluctance to get off the bus 😄 The most heartwarming thing is that when we checked out, we opened the door and saw that he came to pick him up again, so he asked him, he said that he heard the check-out room number reported by the front desk Later, he knew it was us, so he came over. Asked him if he would still be doing an internship here in October, he said that he should be there, and I said I will come again in October.
The last two photos were taken in naked Vale. After entering the gate, Antony drove us around in a battery car. He also showed us several types of rooms and gave a detailed introduction to naked Vale. We were in the valley. Take a walk by the small lake and walk around in a circle. Antony just passed by and helped us to the parking lot next to the hotel's front desk.

In summary, all aspects of the hotel, especially soft services, are worth the price of the hotel. I hope that the reservation depar**ent staff, although they are behind, strengthen their sense of service, and look farther. Don’t just focus on revenue. A good experience will definitely be better. Great feedback.

Western restaurants were unpalatable and not recommended. Chinese food was average. Since the hotel is on the top of the mountain, I can only eat at the hotel. Many people buy tickets to check in. It is a bit of a complaint. For the room type of more than five thousand one night, many activities require additional money to participate. The charges for visiting and playing outside are understandable, and it should be free for in-store guests.

The decoration of the hotel is quite distinctive, simple and natural, the facilities are generally a bit old and the service is very good, and every staff is very kind and polite. The hotel’s catering is very good. There is nothing wrong with it except expensive. Booking a barbecue package in the villa is a cost-effective meal. It’s a great meal.

The duty manager Chen Li and the butler ford are very caring, warm and courteous. They introduced us to various parent-child activities of naked Castle during the pick-up and drop-off of the battery car. They can also visit naked Valley. The children have a great time.
Especially the breakfast, very rich, sitting next to the cliff to eat, the scenery is good.

The observation deck of the hotel overlooks the mountains and lakes, as well as the city lights shaded by the forest below the mountain. These few days are the rainy season, but the rain comes in waves and does not affect outdoor activities. The hotel is in the shape of a castle, the design and construction are very exquisite, the interior decoration design is full of sense, there are both historical and cultural and natural landscapes, I like it very much, and it is worthwhile to visit.

🚗 Transportation: The eighteen bends on the mountain road can be said to be particularly inconvenient when going down the mountain.
🧹Hygiene: Is it because of the hotel in the mountainous area? It’s really not good. My skin was directly allergic the night I returned home.
🍃Environment: The castle is quite beautiful, but the maintenance is average and the room service is not good. How dare you pay more than Bulgari? I won’t come here again.

Stay worry-free, the lady at the front desk will help upgrade the cliff-view room, so lucky 4. It is convenient to walk.

The mountains are endlessly beautiful, from sunrise to sunset, you can shoot blockbusters at will. The castle itself is also quite gorgeous, and has a strong sense of history. The service should focus on praising the catering manager and executive chef. After we put forward some opinions on breakfast, we will pay a return visit to me as soon as possible, and attach great importance to the suggestions and experience of the guests! Will recommend to friends in the future! Feel at home!

第二天到達酒店後由於下雨，不能户外活動，但是度假村內各類活動仍然豐富。我們體驗了陶藝和彩繪，裸心小館的Ella和Abby耐心得指導我家的兩個小朋友做陶藝，玩得很開心。還去城堡二樓的炮台樓體驗南瓜派製作，晚飯也在炮台樓，味道不錯。晚上還有電影之夜，雖然有淅淅瀝瀝的細雨，但是絲毫不影響遊玩的興致。
第二天天好後我們去了酒店後的射箭活動，那附近可以直達莫幹山景區，喜愛爬山徒步的朋友在此住宿也是十分方便的。六一小童節當天還為小朋友們舉行了六一派對，做香囊切蛋糕，真的很開心，不虛此行。

整體服務都比較貼心，接泊車隨叫隨到；有需求找管家，回覆速度很快。可以説服務能對得起這個價位。

msg:之前買的套餐來待兩晚，環境沒得説，很美，開車過來也很方便，可以在下面庾村吃了午飯遊覽一圈再上來，房間不行，我沒有被升級，田園小居真的房間小，逼仄，也沒什麼景，3星水準，一進來我都要打退堂鼓了，城堡裏面挺有趣，餐廳要加16%，但味道還是不錯的，不點特別貴的，人均400多，早餐景色好，選擇也挺多，可以做手工玩玩，服務很難評，既有不怎麼讓人愉快的，也有特別好的，網上的管家有點費勁。嚮導啊，酒吧啊，餐廳啊都挺好。總得來説還算不錯，可以住兩晚，換個房。

msg:非常非常差，強烈不推薦去，花了冤枉錢！
1.酒店引導服務各方面不配套，看似花了大價格，實際前台、管家日常服務一塌糊塗，沒人管，看似附加活動很多，實際都沒有；
2.酒店定價不合理，餐費定價極高，相應品質普通，體驗感很差，價不配位；
3.對客人去遊玩莫幹山連基本的引導都沒有，長輩在門口問保安去莫幹山的路的時候，被保安誤導，推薦了黃牛，長輩誤以為是酒店的服務，實際多次錯誤引導，導致莫幹山體驗非常差。以致於長輩提出莫幹山太差，之後不會再去！
我之前在其他時間去過莫幹山，體驗沒有這麼差過，走過路過千萬要錯過這家酒店，不然你就會像我一樣，悔不當初！

1）作為這個價位的度假村，既然開設了充電樁建議一排都免費而不是就留2個免費充電樁而且還是慢充，更何況你收費的也是慢充還1.6元一度電。
2）早餐自助麪檔你點了餐不能走，得守着你的麪食不然一轉身就被人拿走了，值得一提總廚很有服務意識，見到我的煎蛋被拿走了立馬做了送到我位置上，但是否後期管理上可以更人性化點。

前台接待應該是位實習生，業務不太熟悉，十問九不知，要加強培訓，前台是酒店給客人的第一印象，有點掉分。接駁車基本來得很快，除了最後一天在活動中心等了二十多分鐘，説是退房高峯，實際活動中心門口停了三四部空的接駁車，有穿着制服酒店的人自己開了一輛接駁車，活動中心的工作人員讓她帶我們一下，明顯感覺她不樂意，嘴裏説著什麼，最後正好接駁車來了沒讓她載。
另外洗漱沐浴用品，吹風機，馬桶建議升級一下，這些和目前酒店的房價實在不配。

msg:打卡了聞名已久的裸心堡，免費升級了崖景房，走的時候還送了定製小茶缸，管家Shirley全程安排很貼心。陽台風景很好，心曠神怡，下沉式小客廳待着也很舒服。房間略顯空曠了一些，可能是故意追求“裸心”效果，不是野奢酒店那種奢。迷你吧東西貴了一點，已然這麼高的房價了，完全可以漲點把迷你吧免費了，體驗會更好。早餐廳因為大玻璃窗陽光直射空調又開很足，很熱。趕上了買一晚送一晚，如果是原價的話，還是有點貴了。

msg:江浙滬自駕其實還可以。客房的阿姨打掃都挺好的。
衹要不滿意的是，在入住前一天有打電話來問房間的一些偏好，我説想要景觀好一點的。安靜一點的。結果第二天入住給我安排了個一樓的入口處，衹能望到窗口的兩個矮綠植，以及人來人走的住客跟員工。且房間內沒有紗簾，如果拉上窗簾，整體室內燈光十分昏暗。然後打客房電話詢問，被告知就是沒有紗簾，且無房間可換，如果不想這樣可以自費升房，打完折980一晚。跟同住人溝通了一下，就不需要升房了。於是沒有解決辦法，就直接掛斷電話拉上窗簾，睡覺了。也不想在度假區內消費了。午睡的時候麼有打電話過來，吵醒了説有房間了，過半個小時可以換到樓上。然後午睡吵醒了頭很痛。換了房間之後，窗子是壞的，關不上，飛進來好多蟲子。前後換了三個人來看修，最後訴求衹需要關上就行。我們不打開了。房間內抓掉了四衹蟲子。第一天的入住確實不怎麼愉快。接下來就正常躺了兩天走了。喊小車還是挺快的。
不過不會考慮再來了。

差強人意，價格沒有跟上服務的地方:大堂的服務員都是看上去剛畢業的學生，人雖然多，但感覺都是沒有經過正統高星級培訓過。細節或者服務沒有跟上，沒有洲際，珀爾曼之類的專業。連四星都達不到。
服務主要以加微信私信為主，個人感覺這個當時比較low，像民宿一樣的服務方式。

1.管家服務：到店前會有很多人的來電，有前台、有什麼瑜伽等等，請問不能一個管家管到底麼？套餐裏有些項目沒有了也沒有任何提示，比如路虎越野體驗，我問了才會説…衹能説管家的服務水平比實習生還差一點
2.用餐：性價比就不説了，畢竟在高山上，各種成本核算，衹是用餐的品類選擇太少，早餐288一位，一個房間2份，帶孩子需補差…其實住過很多度假酒店，小於12的孩子很多餐廳都是免費的…
3.房間：衹有入住水果，個別還是爛的…第二天沒有補充…對於度假酒店這個真不夠貼心！房間的床是1m寬…不小心就摔下去了…
4.城堡介紹裏的實習生連個麥都捨不得配，講解不知所以…對城堡歷史一知半解…
先這麼多吧……總之，不會再去第二次

再説到房間之外的整體環境，城堡內的大廳和酒吧（lobby）提供的是完全的歐美體驗，露台作為能夠用來觀看日出，而城堡外的“小鎮”又有很多的趣味，特別是泳池和活動室。
中餐廳沒有品嚐，但是西餐廳的水平是非常在線的，如果想要體驗的話一定要預訂窗邊的位置，景色非常棒。
也許一些遊客會因裸心堡的價格卻步，我在到訪之前也對此頗有微詞，但實際體驗下來之後我認為這趟旅行是值這個價格的。推薦各位在中午到達，然後放鬆的在城堡裏住一晚上，享受一天西式古典的生活。

msg:住了兩天，客觀評價
入住從田園小居被免費升級了懸崖房，以為是愉快兩天的開始，結果是被折磨的開始，房子架構在盤山路邊上，應該是鋼結構建的，完全不隔音，剛入住躺下想小睡一會，樓上的人來回奔跑整個樓板都在震動噪音巨大，跟管家反應後樓上安靜下來，但是發現正常的走路聲樓下都一清二楚，沒任何辦法，總不能讓別人不要走動，這是設計上的缺陷。
其次是吃飯方面，酒店內有一箇中西餐廳，入住當天到城堡吃了一頓簡單的中餐，中規中矩，不驚艷也不算難吃，接下來想吃其他的衹能坐車下山找吃的或者客房送餐，120多一碗的牛肉麪怎麼形容呢，其實五星酒店基本都是這個價格，但是能不能好好學學人家是怎麼做的呢，一碗麪裏就那麼幾顆牛肉粒，像泡發的牛肉乾，完全無任何擺盤，賣相不如大街上20一碗的牛肉麪，但是不吃又不行，因為沒其他別的可吃。還有我那35一杯，準確説加完服務費和税費應該是40一杯的美式也是一言難盡，餐飲水平好好增強一下吧。
然後就是設施問題，第一天空調沒任何問題，第二晚睡着直接被熱醒，空調壞了開始吹熱風，打完電話大概半小時左右修好，睡到後半夜空調又無冷風，但是好在不吹熱風，也懶得打電話在折騰。
還有一個入口停車場報備問題，真的很麻煩，每次報備完進大門保安會問，也不看任何訊息，感覺很雞肋，一會成功一會又沒報備成功，大熱天在停車場等車真的是折磨。

總結下，玩了兩天確實沒有讓人感覺到度假的樂趣和放鬆，實在要來，最多住一天足矣。

最後説下這兩天唯一滿意的點，加了管家微信，服務反應比較快，基本很快都能處理完需求。

msg:作為民宿的天花板，裸心堡景觀無敵，風景獨好，可以走捷徑直接進入莫幹山景區，中餐廳很好吃，房間有特色，蚊蟲不多的，下次想去住崖景房。印象最深的還是管家服務。入住前管家陳水晶瞭解到我帶了兩個孩子主動幫我升級房間，小孩説想吃火鍋，管家也安排人從山下送上來，我想喝星巴克，山上星巴克不送，她就上班的路上幫我們從山下拎了四杯送到房間，我想拍照她有空就全程陪同，打不到七座也是管家幫我問的本地人，解決了我們所有麻煩。退房後因為落下了東西，工作人員lisa自己幫我送到了縣城。連住兩天是一次很完美的體驗。缺點是別墅採光不好，燈有點昏暗，設施沒有那麼新，不過也不至於陳舊，西餐廳工作人員很冷漠，反正吃了兩天沒看到一個笑臉，沒幾個客人請他們幫忙倒杯咖啡不情不願，等了十幾分鍾，然後小孩玩的東西少一點，適合拍照和休閑。

經理Shirley從未入住聯繫我，到入住，再到退房，都非常貼心地解決我需要的問題，很是感謝！
唯一遺憾的是這次沒有住在大城堡裏，預判錯了裸心堡真的好大，全程都需要小哥哥們的擺渡車才能在不受冷的情況下出行，下次一定住主題房！

msg:今天剛回，按前台建議還是評價下，希望越來越好
【滿意】：硬件，位置和環境，都很好。上海過來3小時左右，挺適合短途休整，放空。
【需要完善的】按入住後順序來吧
1電瓶車小哥：不問3遍，不回話。回話也是不知道。--建議培訓下：從這個山叫莫幹山，這個酒店的來歷等
2晚餐：
1）晚上城堡一樓：最好增加引導的人，晚上沒人，不好找.進門了有幾個小哥，都閑着啊。
2）中餐廳：也就10桌，每次來一半都是空的，為什麼都要預約。用餐完了，還是一半空。--建議：根據入住率，臨時增加廚師
3早餐：
在西餐廳。服務人員不少，用心工作啊，顧客不是聽你們元旦年終總結的嘮嗑。確保飯菜熱度，確保有餐具。
4房間：山上乾燥，每房間放大桶水吧。或再增加點費用，飲品免費掉，樣樣收費感受不好。
5日常活動：走到哪，都先問房卡號。對顧客信任些，就這幾個人，有監控的。或在小門增加個門衞，沒有人翻牆過來的。
6打掃衞生：先敲門再進來。不要當天退房就這麼著急。
7其他：除了第二天去莫幹山路上碰到的清潔阿姨，看不到任何人有笑容。有個禮貌的微笑，是對自己工作的尊重。
【總結】
好地方，管理需完善。消費升級任重道遠，特別是軟性的管理和服務。祝越來越好吧！

msg:團購來的，總體來講還是很不錯的體驗。
優點：
1.服務沒得説，在經歷過的所有住酒店體驗中，這裏算是數一數二的，從入住前一天開始就全方位的對接好需求，入住後各種需求有求必應，服務人員非常真誠耐心，超乎期待。
2.娛樂很豐富，各種項目可以體驗，想爬山徒步出門就有成熟的線路，想躺平就隨便找個地方都很舒服。
3.風景無敵，四面環山，空氣極好，日落絕美。度假村內也處處都很精緻。
4.客房的床很舒服，雖然是最便宜的田園小居，但床品的質量和備品的質量絲毫不打折扣。房間安靜，睡眠質量很好。
缺點：一定要挑點缺點的話，
1.裝修（硬裝）簡陋了點，過於樸實無華，就和經濟型酒店差不多，雖然是最便宜的房型，而且在山裡走原始的小木屋路線沒啥不妥，但哪怕有個小陽台也好啊！
2.酒店裡連自動販賣機的可樂和雪碧都要賣到一聽28塊錢，這未免有點太景區收費標準了，覺得不太合理。
3.團購項目裏面是寫着有伴手禮的，但是實際並沒有，前台收了房卡就一秒鐘結束退房可以走人了，這稍微有點爛尾…

msg:服務：酒店服務很不錯，配有專屬管家，我的管家是陳利，很貼心負責，都下班了，還一直給我提醒、預訂接駁車什麼的

環境：森林中的古堡，很具有歷史感，可以算莫幹山的TOP1了。古堡很的裝飾就比較一般了，不太有真歷史感

住宿：説實話，不是很優秀的那種，主要還是奔着古堡來的

娛樂：推薦竹林射箭，很有意思，要是能多玩會就好了。無邊泳池不錯，還有桌球、桌上足球、飛鏢什麼的，可以玩的挺多的

環境： 環境沒話説，消費的就是景色啦。
服務： 略有欠缺，裸心堡上坡度很陡的，停車場出來全靠接駁車。但是接駁車看起來又很忙，想讓接駁車陪着轉悠一下是不大可能的。前台checkin大廳有一款孩子很愛吃的餅乾，但是每次都衹有幾片。不至於吧… 大幾千一晚房費你們不能這麼摳搜吧。前台辦入住的服務很不錯，有一個小夥人很nice。
設施： 設施太老舊了，娛樂場所幾乎沒有。 室外泳池温服也比較低，沒有享受到。房間馬桶太老了，冬天應該會很冷。
餐飲：住裸心堡基本上衹能在裏面用餐了。出來下山轉車至少來回一小時很白方便的。中餐口味還不錯的、早餐品質也很好。就是額外16%服務費有點太高了。不理解中國人搞什麼服務費。

但唯有不足的是沒有洗衣房，且房間內的洗漱用品與房價不匹配。牙膏衹是高露潔。
洗髮液沐浴露等品牌不詳。

但服務態度非常好。軟服務也很到位，最讓人驚喜的是瑜伽課，瑜伽老師micki fan非常用心，建議大家一定要多去試一試！在山間做瑜伽是一種特殊的感覺，吹着山風，很放鬆！

msg:優點: 
裸心堡在山裡，一幢幢小屋比較分散，管理難度較大。能做到電瓶車隨叫隨到，前台有問必答，打掃阿姨熱情客氣，確屬不易。
裸心堡拍照好看

缺點: 
開業至今已有一定年數，設施有點舊，牆壁和台盆的硅膠都已發黑
山裡的原因，被子潮潮的
沒有評論裏説的管家提前聯繫，也沒有享受到房間升級或者贈送任何伴手禮。可能我的房價便宜？
懸崖套房結構原因，晚上較吵，樓上的走路聲説話聲，道路上電瓶車開過的聲音都挺打擾休息的

總之，體驗一次足夠了。以後如果再去，可能會首選郡安裏或者索性考慮開元森泊

訂酒店前對比了裸心堡&裸心谷，都説相對裸心堡的服務會更好些，體驗下來果真如此，服務簡直太好了，熱情周到，入住的第二天，前廳經理Sam還給我們升級了房型，體驗了一晚城堡的套房，無論是崖景房還是城堡裏的阿拉伯風情的癮室都很不錯，各有千秋！
酒店餐飲方面，自助早餐除了品種有點少，味道都不錯，由於不高興出去晚餐也是在城堡的中餐廳享用的，每個菜都很有特色。特別值得一提的酒吧的小吳經理，特別熱情，會分享給我們酒的一些知識，會讓我們品嚐他精心製作的咖啡，我們提的任何問題都能解決！
此行最大的感覺就是我在這裏不想走了，特別愜意，輕鬆，自在！

但仍然有美中不足：希望在旺季適當增加活動中心的工作人員數量，以增加旺季各項活動安排時間，以免活動與活動之間時間安排出現重疊或者間隔時間太長，讓我出來度假都需要給自己安排時間表然後預約，趕活動就像趕着去上課未免離譜!
套餐裏的伴手禮忘記給我安排了，後來我自己想起來了給前台打電話給寄到我家了，主要是比較好奇伴手禮是啥（不知道是不是前台太忙了，我退完房想起來套餐裏伴手禮沒有給我的時候打電話過去第一個電話是説要問一下去，後來沒等到回覆再打過去前台的語氣就不太好了，讓人感覺比較不適，好像我做錯了什麼惹她不快了?）

在抵達前，酒店管家陳利加了我wx，還驚喜得給予升級房型到懸崖房，房間內打開窗就能看到連綿的山海，太美了～小陳服務意識特別好，checkin時候，來打招呼，幫忙搬行李。讓她叫車去餐廳，也是讓我在房間等候，車快到了會通知出去，避免外面吹風。為客人考慮得很細緻。
看得出酒店建造的時候，設計師花費了不少心思，處處盡顯城堡的感覺，比Disney酒店還值得入住！
唯一缺點就是酒店時間久了，有些房內設施老舊了，這是避免不了的了。

msg:莫幹山裸心堡是一個沒有私家車無法到達的去處，進門後還有一段不短的距離。我們是自駕過去的，是否會有酒店的車可以到山下接送，不知。入住後管家會貼心的介紹了幾個娛樂項目，包括進入莫幹山景區的百步嶺短程徒步。從16號門出去就是網紅打卡點，裸心堡鞦韆。難怪網紅，坐在鞦韆上，背後綠水青山，城堡隱約其中，頗有童話意境，恍惚間城堡中住着樂佩devil。鞦韆的左手是一條有些難度係數的徒步道路，鞦韆的右手是一條有少許彎曲人工鋪設的石塊台階，兩條路殊途同歸。最終都會到達山頂。毛主席下榻處，蘆花盪公園，劍池等等。這裏需要特別表揚一下我們的小管家，沒有管家的提醒幾乎花了冤枉錢，因為莫幹山大部分景區都是免費的，僅僅個別需要收費，在劍池門口被忽悠着購票，諮詢了管家，管家對景區做了基本介紹後，又告知大部分遊客的選擇，幫我們避免了花冤枉錢。裸心堡的服務讓我感覺自在温暖，早飯過後與一衹狗子🐶相遇，狗子自然地與人同行着，表現出對人的親暱，管家怕我們害怕過來圈住狗子，並解釋着，因為早上客人還沒有起床活動，這會兒人少，解開狗子的鏈子，讓它在院子裏活動一會兒，它叫16，對噠數字16。它和客人一起從16號門進入酒店，酒店等了很久沒人認領，於是就集體收養了16，😄16很乖，也與人親近。這種自然親近與體貼的氛圍讓站在霧氣繚繞，温暖濕潤空氣中人更加鬆弛，卸去一身疲憊。
還有一個活動值得推薦，路虎越野體驗。我本身就是一個運動愛好者，不論真熱愛假熱愛，反正平時有些運動[機智]。在至少50cm水深的地方穩穩行進似乎沒那麼可怕，但是在起伏山丘中兩個輪子着地，兩個輪子懸空，車身左右劇烈擺動，左前輪或右前輪着地的一瞬間清晰的感覺自己的心臟跟着一起放回原處了，爬上一個20度的坡道後，看不到腳下，應該叫看不到輪下的路，憑藉自己的感覺決定繼續油門，或是踩下剎車。真是開車20年以來的另類體驗，刺激。繼續攢錢，攢夠銀子再來一遍
