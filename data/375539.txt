It was our anniversary, and George in the terrace bar was fantastic. He brought us to the sassoon balcony for photos and later presented us with one of the photos in a frame.We also had a fascinating hotel tour, lead by the charming Vivi. The gold lounge was very comfortable and the food tasty. Can't wait to return.

msg:We booked a little staycation for our wedding anniversary. We had a Gold room on the 6th floor with access to the executive lounge. The afternoon tea set was cute and tasty. The happy hour drinks selection was limited, and the buffet was a bit disappointing.  It was japanese cuisine but it was a little strange, especially the fruit sushi instead of sushi with fish...  Sadly, there were no desserts available besides the weird fruit sushi. 

 It was quite bad timing for us because the Shanghai marathon was this weekend and they closed the streets at night around the hotel which made it difficult to enter in the evening. They also closed the rooftop because of the marathon which was disappointing because we booked the hotel to enjoy the view. At night time we heard a lot of sound testing for the marathon stage that kept us awake. In the early morning there was again a lot of noise because of the marathon. I wish the hotel would have mentioned this and offered to change our room, while I was booking. I called the hotel booking department two times to make the reservation but they did not menthon this. Also when we were checking in they did not mention it until we told them we would be going out late in the evening. I expect better service and information from a time honored hotel especially when I'm checking in at the executive reception. 

Another key feature we missed out on this weekend was the long running jazz band in the jazz bar which is anothee iconic reason for going to the hotel. Be warned that the jazz band is not playing these days and they do not know when they will return. 

Overall the room was clean and nice. The bathtub and furniture in the room had a nice feeling to them. However, the pillows were too squishy and did not offer any neck support.

They went out of their way to make our stay and the occasion special for us, and we felt everything at this hotel was absolutely top notch! 

The Fairmont is a big step up from other luxury hotels in Shanghai.   The service throughout the premises is the most attentive and friendly we have seen at a big hotel in China, and the prime location, decor, and well-known history are added bonuses.   We enjoyed a drink and watching the oldest jazz band at the bar downstairs, and had a nice dinner at Dragon Phoenix.  We appreciated that you can enjoy a lively bar and a nice dinner without leaving the hotel; usually it‚Äôs difficult to get one of these during your stay.  

We have stayed at other reputable hotels in Shanghai since the pandemic began, but we often find the facilities to be limited, the rooms slightly worn, and the food and service mediocre.   However, the food both in the lounge and at the breakfast buffet was very fresh and varied during our stay at the Fairmont, and the room appeared to be meticulously maintained.  If you are wanting a true 5-star experience, this hotel will definitely not disappoint. Thank you again for the memorable experience!

The room was extremely comfortable and relaxing. The bed especially. We had pre drinks on the terrace on the 9th floor overlooking the bund then dinner at the Cathay Room. Followed by evening cocktails downstairs in the Jazz lounge with friends watching the famous and oldest band. They even played a happy birthday song. Prices for restaurant and cocktails were steep but to expected at a venue like this. Take some time to explore the hotel and the floors. We didn‚Äôt get to experience a spa treatment but had a tour through the spa lounge. It looked amazing.

msg:Bring your parents to experience the legendary Peace Hotel, which is full of experience. When you walk to the door of the hotel, there are service staff who greet you warmly and help you take the luggage. The check-in lady Apple is also very nice. After getting the room card, the handsome guy in the concierge department is also very helpful and helps us deliver the luggage to the room (I can't remember the spelling of his name, and I forgot to take a photo at the time. It seems to be Annie, a boy. Please thank him for me when you see him. Please) Walking in the hotel, every staff member will greet you warmly. There are people in the elevator room to help press the elevator and point the way. It's very considerate. I tasted afternoon tea on the day of check-in and enjoyed the scenery on both sides of the Huangpu River on the ninth floor. The view was great. Then I visited the museum and felt the legendary experience of the century-old hotel. In the evening, the room attendant will provide a turndown service (the first time I have experienced a hotel that really provides a turndown service). The breakfast is really beyond my expectations. The breakfast of more than 300 per person is really worth the money. There are a wide variety of Chinese and Western food, as well as many Shanghai-style pot stickers, xiaolongbao, soup noodles, and many kinds of stir-fried dishes, which are genuine and affordable. The service staff are enthusiastic and professional, and will take the initiative to ask for coffee or tea when they sit down. There was a boy and a girl serving us all the time that day. They were both very enthusiastic and professional. I cooked a bowl of noodles and brought it back. When I was about to get a soup spoon, the girl handed it to me directly. It was really considerate. When I checked out, I met the brother who delivered my luggage when I checked in. He was very considerate to help me with my luggage and asked if I needed to store it. After checking out, Jack from the concierge helped us to make an appointment for a car very patiently, told us that there was no traffic jam now, so we didn‚Äôt have to worry, and reminded us that there might be a lot of people at the station, so we should pay attention to safety. Finally, the concierge at the door of the hotel kept helping us to deliver our luggage to the car and reminded us to pay attention to safety. It was a very pleasant stay experience! Superb! Highly recommended!

msg:Describe the process of checking in. Because of the flowers, I checked in this night. Otherwise, I would choose the Peninsula Hotel next door. Two people booked a double room. We checked in at about 1:40 pm. We were told that the room was not cleaned and we could only check in at 3 o'clock. Because a friend from Shanghai had an appoin**ent to talk, I discussed with the front desk whether I could get a cleaned room first. The front desk told me that only suites were available and it would cost more than 2,700 yuan to upgrade. After the upgrade, I stayed in this suite that cost more than 6,000 yuan a night on Ctrip. As a senior hotel expert, I advise everyone not to waste money on a hotel that I personally think is not worth it because of curiosity. I personally think it is a four-star hotel regardless of hard or soft prices. Look at the photos. If the air conditioner is turned off in the room, there is a musty smell and all the facilities are old. The most interesting thing is that all the drinks in the refrigerator are paid, but they were not told. The payment slip is placed in a very high place and cannot be seen at all. The professional quality of some executives of the hotel is still good. When we checked out, they said they would give us a gift, but the point is that it was not implemented. This room rate (actually paid more than 5,000) does not match the overall situation. I do not recommend staying there. I prefer the Peninsula Hotel next door. Also, the front desk asked for an extra bed for free, which I was very grateful for. Otherwise, I couldn't have had a better experience.

msg:The Peace Hotel's renewed popularity has something to do with the TV series "Flowering Flowers", but in fact, before that, this hotel was already a check-in point on Nanjing Road. There are wedding photos taken almost every day at the north gate where you get off the bus, and there are also many tourists taking photos at other gates.
This time, I chose the most common Fairmont bed, intending to take my baby to experience the style of old Shanghai, but the room type was upgraded. One of the two afternoon teas was wasted.
The sleeping area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room is not very special, it is a bit small, and there is nothing to see outside the window, but the bathroom area is quite special. In addition, what opened my eyes for more than 30 years of life was that there were two doors between my room and the other room where my parents-in-law lived, and the two kids had a great time.
Compared with the lobby of the Peace Hotel, I prefer its 9th floor western restaurant and pedestrian passage.
In addition, their service should be praised. The hotel is the one that pays the most attention to details among the 3,000/night hotels I have stayed in this time. They will come to clean the house after we go out. It seems that none of the non-resort five-star hotels I have stayed in before will do this. The service staff are carefully selected, with similar height and appearance, and they look like southerners who are from the north. Overall, they are much more energetic than Wanda.
My Didi driver also worked there. No wonder, it is under Jinjiang International and has a foreign management team.
In summary, Peace Hotel has a special fragrance and a special sense of calmness as soon as you enter the door. The number of foreign guests here far exceeds that of the other two five-star hotels.

msg:The Peace Hotel that I had been thinking about for several years finally arrived as promised. I had always stood on the Bund and watched it from afar when I came to Shanghai several times before. This time, I walked through the revolving door and walked into the hotel. Needless to say, it was magnificent, and the quality of service complemented it. I couldn't wait to shuttle back and forth in front of the unique decorations of the building to take pictures. A beautiful waitress from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, took pictures for us enthusiastically. It was a pity that I didn't take a picture with her. I will make up for it next time if I have the chance.
I once saw a passage like this: China's 2000-year history can be seen in Xi'an, 1000-year history can be seen in Beijing, 100-year history can be seen in Shanghai, and Shanghai history can be seen in the Peace Hotel. What has the hotel experienced in its nearly 100-year history? I accidentally found a book "Becoming the Peace Hotel", and the answer is here!

msg:After "Flower", it is still moving. Unlike many Internet celebrity hotels, which are in a mess after becoming popular, the service of Peace Hotel is still top-notch. From getting off the car to checking in at the front desk, to the professional butler carrying the luggage to welcome us all the way to the guest room. The ubiquitous service staff re-experienced the services that a top luxury hotel should have in the crowded Bund. This is still a hotel with a century-old history that best represents Shanghai. Before departure, I saw the reservation photos and my heart was always beating. This century-old hotel gave people a too retro and old-fashioned attitude. But when you are in it, you will find that "Flower" under the lens of Wong Kar-wai is the best annotation of Peace Hotel. From the single-pass cast iron revolving door to the glass dome of the octagonal atrium, from the iconic green pure copper spire to the straight facade of the simple granite. The Art Deco luxury style is vividly reflected. In addition to the super high aesthetics of the design of the first building in the Far East, the careful maintenance of all staff can make this still usable historical building not stay in the museum, but a unique experience for people to participate in. It's worth coming again and again!

msg:The hotel also dealt with the various incidents during check-in and stay appropriately. The following evaluation is a true feeling without any personal emotions. A family of three checked in at Peace Hotel at around 1pm on May 2. During the check-in, the staff recommended that we upgrade to a street view suite at an additional price. Considering that it would be nice to see the brightly lit pedestrian street at night, we agreed. After confirmation, we found that the upgraded suite was a king-size bed room. After communication, we added a bed for free. We also discussed matters such as the child's breakfast. So far, everything is OK. Because we haven't had lunch yet, after checking in, we went to the room to put down our things and went out for lunch. During the period, we didn't have time to go back to the room and went directly to the Oriental Pearl Tower. At more than 8pm, we came back from the Oriental Pearl Tower exhausted and found that the bed in the room had not been added. At this time, I was already furious and notified the concierge. While waiting, I opened the curtains and was stunned. You can refer to the pictures. The so-called street view is looking at the building opposite and the air conditioner outside. I lowered my head to see the street. I hit my head on the window, which hurt me. The room manager brought workers to add a bed. He apologized repeatedly for the omission of adding a bed, but he didn't feel wrong about the street view. He emphasized that their street view was like this, and said that the upgraded suite was a suite with a different area. But if my point was the suite, I would book a suite at the beginning. I am willing to spend money to upgrade the view. If I knew that the street view you said to spend 2,000 yuan to upgrade was like this, I think I would refuse without hesitation. Do you dare to recommend your street view to guests next time with this picture? P.S. On the way back, the hotel manager called to waive half of the upgrade fee. Even at this point, the customer manager apologized for not adding a bed in time, and didn't mention the so-called street view. This review is also a friendly reminder to future guests to avoid pitfalls when upgrading street view rooms.

msg:After watching "Flowers", I wanted to experience the Peace Hotel. When I stepped into the hotel lobby, I felt the strong old Shanghai style, which was very historical and gave me the feeling that time and history had really settled. I booked a Fairmont suite, which was decorated in a French style and had a direct view of Nanjing Road. On the second night, the hotel upgraded me to a German suite for free, which had a direct view of the Oriental Pearl Tower on the Bund. The view was amazing. The stay experience at the Peace Hotel was very good. The hotel staff had rich service experience and were very attentive. Although the hotel facilities were a bit old and the suites were large, so the sanitary corners were not in place, everything else was very good. The food was also delicious ~ the Dragon and Phoenix Hall tasted good. A very good and special stay experience.

msg:With a history of 100 years, the hotel that best represents Shanghai.

I was impressed by the Peace Hotel before "Flower". There are many luxury hotels in Shanghai, but there are not many hotels with such a rich history.

Located in the core area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Bund, facing the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, it is indeed a sense of superiority to enter the hotel door among the crowd of people taking pictures.

The hotel is full of the imprint of old Shanghai. Although the rooms are old, they are well maintained. Unfortunately, there is no smart toilet.

The breakfast was a bit disappointing. There were many people during the Qingming Festival holiday, and the dishes were not rich. The quality of the basic room of 3,000 yuan should not be so, and even the steamed buns have not been replenished. However, the restaurant staff is very insightful and collects the plates very quickly.

The quality of the afternoon tea on the ninth floor is good. After all, the price is there, and the Bund view is also great.

Here, it is not only a hotel, but also the feelings of old Shanghai, which is worth experiencing!

msg:Travel through time and space with the flowers and feel the prosperity and history
‚ñ™Ô∏èPeace Hotel As one of the landmarks of Shanghai, Peace Hotel is not only a luxurious hotel, but also a living history.
Step into a time and space where prosperity and history are intertwined.
‚ñ™Ô∏èIn the lobby, the antique bronze chandeliers cast soft light, which is confusing, and the historical photos and paintings on the walls whisper the history. Every stop is for a dialogue with history, and every turn is the closest contact with the historical people of the past.
‚ñ™Ô∏èIts history can be traced back to 1929, when it was called Chinachem Hotel. It was conceived and founded by Jewish businessman Victor Sassoon, and its construction cost exceeded 2.48 million taels of silver. It is the first building in Shanghai with more than 10 floors and is known as the "First Building in the Far East".
‚ñ™Ô∏èMany celebrities have left their footprints here. Mr. Lu Xun once walked upstairs here to meet the British Sir Malan; Chaplin once stayed here and left a beautiful memory of his love; the British playwright Sir Robert Kahoul wrote his most famous play "" in room 314. personal life". It has hosted famous figures at home and abroad many times and witnessed countless historical moments.
‚ñ™Ô∏èThe design and tone of the room make people feel the rich Shanghai style. The winding entrance hall, private bedroom space, writing desk and round mirror, textured sofa and TV cabinet, every detail reveals Chinese sophistication and delicacy. The Peace Hotel logo embroidered on the bathrobe is an unforgettable reminder of this historical mark.

From the moment I stepped out of the car, the doorman would ask If you stay at the hotel, they will take your luggage directly to the check-in lobby for handover, and the check-in staff in the lobby will also have a very good attitude. The rooms are also very satisfactory. Then every time you get on and off the elevator, you will receive good guidance and greetings, which makes you feel more friendly.
There are also many choices for breakfast. In addition to freshly cooked vermicelli, rice noodles, stewed wontons, noodles, etc., there are also more oden dishes than last year, and the stir-fried dishes are different every day, which is very good. Very satisfied with breakfast.
If there is an emergency, we will respond immediately and resolve it satisfactorily. Overall, I am very satisfied. I will come back in the second half of the year and stay at the Peace Hotel.

msg:As an old store with a history of nearly a hundred years, you can earn money when you move in. It really won't let you down. The beautiful girl MINIE who checked in at the front desk was warm, thoughtful and courteous. Not only did she inform me in detail about the check-in related matters and the time for the museum's history explanation the next day, she also personally escorted me to the elevator. I truly felt at home.
When you walk into the gorgeous and alluring Peace Hotel, its luxurious beauty will surprise you and make you feel even more warm and peaceful. I was impressed by the staff member who opened the lobby door on the night I checked in: I went in and out several times, but he took the trouble to open and close the door for me very politely, always with a smile.
The hotel is in an excellent location, right on the Bund, opposite the Oriental Pearl Tower, and next to the Wanguo Building Complex. Go out from the gate near the Wanguo Building Complex and turn right to reach the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street.
The room is grand, the breakfast is very rich, and there are many "Flowers" photo check-in spots in the store. The museum's explanation is very detailed and will give you a detailed understanding of the store's past and present life after listening to it. It is highly recommended! Not only that, the guide will also take you to the Dragon and Phoenix Hall on the eighth floor and the swimming pool on the first floor. This allows you to experience the super invincible perspective of the magnificent Bund from the window of the Dragon and Phoenix Hall without spending any money!
The only regret is that the cargo ships on the Huangpu River made a lot of noise, and I was a light sleeper. The noise prevented me from sleeping well all night.
Overall, it was a very satisfying stay. I will choose to stay here again when I come to Shanghai in the future.

msg:There is no need to go into too much detail about the excellent places. Location C on the Bund is the best experience of history and emotion.
The maintenance level of the facilities and equipment is very good. Unexpectedly, the green-glazed stairwell and wooden elevator room have become popular places to check in.
The historical exhibition hall on the second floor is very nice and you can learn a lot about history.
I was thoughtfully given a commemorative cake when I checked in on Valentine's Day, which gave me a sense of ceremony.
The breakfast is very rich and the soup dumplings are very authentic.
The swimming pool is not as important as its cleanliness.
Check-in is very slow, which is understandable during the Chinese New Year, but there are already a lot of guests queuing up at the two check-in counters, so we don't need to spend too much time introducing guests to room upgrades.
I headed to the Peace Hotel on the Green Bay Peak, but the platform was closed, and hotel guests were not allowed to go up, but the in-store travel photos were allowed up.

msg:As expected of a nearly century-old hotel, the hotel's service and reception are very professional, and the hotel's history is introduced in detail. The hotel is very good, it has its own museum, and the preserved historical objects and decorations are very precious. The breakfast is very popular, although the price Not cheap, but worth the stay.

msg:Let‚Äôs talk about the bad feeling first.
Breakfast and afternoon tea were much worse than I expected
The afternoon tea was obviously stale. The breakfast was indeed rich but the taste was just ordinary. It was neither unpleasant nor delicious.

Hygiene: Hygiene and cleanliness are very, very, very good
Environment: After all, it is the Peace Hotel and the environment is great
Service: I have nothing to say about the service. When I checked in, I carried my luggage all the way to the room and hung up my coat. The takeout I ordered in the middle of the night was also brought to the room.

The overall evaluation is that it‚Äôs good to experience it. It still feels a bit worthless to actually travel and stay.

msg:The hotel has been gilded for hundreds of years, and I feel like I have traveled back to that era. There is no need to elaborate on the location and heritage. I have stayed at Fairmont in Wuhan, so I have a good understanding of the details of the Fairmont team, from the front desk at check-in to the delivery of the room. Both the room introduction and the room introduction are very good, including the breakfast area. Although the area is not large, there is a queue during peak hours. In fact, this is understandable. Although the breakfast does not have many varieties, it is very attentive to prepare some regional characteristics. I think everyone can feel the team It was very attentive, and the bar and museum introductions were full marks. I also gave Owl a good review. The only regret was that I took pictures at the stairs. The staff on duty at the stairwell punching in was very stiff. He kept asking the room number, and deliberately asked five or six times. It is normal to forget the room number with the room card. I understand that working in a hotel is not easy, but every customer spends money to experience hotel services and humanistic enjoyment, so every employee is uncompromising and full of arrogance. , it will lead to damage to the entire brand image, and also make the entire service closed loop discouraged and unsatisfactory! I still hope to attract the attention of the hotel management team. Every employee is an indispensable part of the perfect service. The lack of a screw will bring down the brand image! I hope the Peace Hotel will get better and better!

msg:Very satisfied with my stay at Peace Hotel. This is a hotel full of history and culture. Although the facilities are not as good as those of relatively new hotels, the service level and quality are among the top three hotels I have experienced. Finally, a special thank you to Alexander. His service attitude and professionalism are amazing.

msg:The Peace Hotel itself is a kind of history, and the broadcast of Flowers made the Peace Hotel even more famous. Only guests of the hotel can enter inside. While checking in, you can slowly visit this building with rich stories. There is a small museum in the hotel, which is open for free during the Spring Festival and is equipped with explanations. The instructors can explain the hotel in detail.
I chose the room package with afternoon tea at Huamao Pavilion [Legend of the World¬∑Flower Peace], which can be described as a surprise. The terrace outside the restaurant overlooks the Bund, and the reservation-only afternoon tea is also satisfying.
The hotel service can also be praised. The waiters are warm and hospitable, will actively help carry luggage, and will also carefully introduce the hotel accommodation environment. When dining, make sure there is always water in the water glass and remove empty plates in a timely manner.
The single bed in the room is very wide, so it won't be crowded for one adult and one child. The Chinese-style layout reveals new technology in details, including Dyson hair dryers, smart toilets, bathtubs with TVs, and coffee machines, which are convenient and comfortable.
Finally, there is the location of the hotel. Needless to say, it is right outside the Bund and Nanjing Road. Standing in front of the hotel, it is a beautiful scenery.

The attitude is very good and the room is also very clean.
When I left, the concierge guy Alexander helped me carry my luggage to the second floor of the garage. It was very niceüëç
It's a pity that I didn't have breakfast because I went to bed too late. Both my parents thought the breakfast was rich and very good.
The only possible flaw is that the perfume smell on the first floor is really unpleasant for personal reasons. Hahahahaha. I feel overwhelmed.

To put it simply, the hotel's time-honored environment, historical heritage, and enthusiastic service are all satisfactory. However, during the holidays, people around you follow the herd, which somewhat affects your mood.
The view balcony on the ninth floor is highly recommended.

msg:There are many hotels on both sides of the Huangpu River. Heping is really the hotel with the best service and good catering. To put it bluntly, their service is that they are knowledgeable and understand clearly. During my stay this time, I enjoyed the hotel's free own parking lot, Gold Executive benefits, and the opportunity to arrange check-in in advance on such a busy New Year's Day. And the leisurely a**osphere at the Senior Jazz Bar at night. Originally I disliked the old rooms and never put it on my list, but now I think I will go there more often. The hardware is well maintained and the software is more pleasing to the eye. It is worth going back.
