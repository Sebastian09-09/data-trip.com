msg:A welcome sight not far from where the Airport bus drops. 12 minutes walk to the main railway station - if you like steep stairs on the underpass. Convenient walk to Dogguan Mosque site, local restaurants and City Mall.
Grandiose lobby (where you check in) is on the 21st floor. Many facilities on different floors, but most seemed shuttered and unavailable. 
Hallway and room were in excellent condition. Nice room layout and view of the city. However, shower room light would not turn off at night. Study desk was a bit wobbly.
Muslim Specialty restaurant has a high end menu but the sofas are not suited for dining, I think. Hotel's free vegetarian breakfast buffet was very tasty.

There are some shortcomings. One is that the disposable toothbrush is of poor quality and the hair falls out of my mouth when I brush my teeth; and the second day when I cleaned the room, I took away a dirty bathrobe, but I didn’t get a new one... The service needs to be more attentive; and some facilities are a bit old, and the TV cannot be projected.

When I went up at 20:08, it was not there yet, and the front desk said it started at 20:30. I was really speechless. I went out to have dinner at 21:00. 30 I went back to the hotel to check out the so-called self-service late night snack. I can only describe it as shabby. This kind of late night snack should either be avoided or made with a slightly higher quality. Not to mention simple, there is no publicity. The chopsticks have no clips, which is very unhygienic! Then there is the sensor light on the washbasin in the room or the voice-activated light. Really, don’t be too useless. The light comes on as soon as you turn over and cannot be turned off. I haven’t had a good rest all night!

It is recommended that the room card can be changed. Isn't it good to improve its own brand value? I didn't see it clearly and booked a twin bed. The front desk happily upgraded the room. It was clean and hygienic, and the hardware was pretty good! What I like most is the shower. Those who often travel and travel must know that few hotels have big showers. This one is not only big but also very powerful. It is converted to a top shower head. It is so comfortable that I took a shower several times on purpose! ! !

Sister Zhao Yaoxiang from the fifth-floor restaurant learned that I was too late to catch the bus and could not dine on site, so she agreed to pack breakfast and be flexible.

The security guard randomly blocked the traffic. I was catching a flight at noon, and the car was blocked and I couldn't find the security guard! 
2. The sanitary conditions of the room are worrying. There are hairs all over the bed, and there is a row of false eyelashes on the wall to the left of the sink! *
3. Breakfast: Is this the level of Kaiyuan? Too bad
4. The hotel receptionist, I stood in front of it and no one paid attention to me, and the two chatted by themselves
Overall evaluation: bad review, bad review, bad review!

I took my children with me and checked in on the 21st floor. The waiters were very nice and the breakfast was rich. I was very happy.
I was on the train to Lhasa the next night. The luggage was stored on the first floor of the hotel. I sent it via SF Express and they helped to collect it.
After eight days of walking on the Qinggan-Gansu Ring Road, I had a lot of clothes and I went to do laundry. The cleaning aunties were very enthusiastic. There were not enough clothes drying racks, so the front desk gave them to me.
Checking in at night, I felt that there was cold air in the room, which was very comfortable.
There is hot air in the bathing area. Very detailed and thoughtful.
Later, I lost the charging cable in the book bar on the 21st floor. I called and helped me find it. The waiters gave me pertinent suggestions on where to go. I didn’t even ask their names, but there was someone named Ma Mei in the elevator. Also very enthusiastic.
I hope this hotel will get better and better.
Next time I have the opportunity to come to Xining, I will stay here again.

msg:Poor facilities: The door lock mother slot is completely loose, making it impossible to tighten the safety bolt. The springs in the mattress were completely loose and made a squeaky sound when you sat on it. If you sit on the head of the bed, the end of the bed will rise. The name of the hotel is Kaiyuan, and the TV boot screen still shows the old name of the hotel from a few years ago.

Poor hygiene: The shower faucet is covered with scale. The ring under the toilet seat was dirty.

Poor service: The hotel's check-in is on the 21st floor of the top floor. There is a very small service desk. The two men inside, a man and a woman, don't know whether it is because they are in a bad mood or for some reason. They always have a cold face, especially when I ask to check out. Do I need to return the room card from the lower floor where I checked in to the top floor? Is there an express check-out lane? The male waiter asked me with a look of disdain: Otherwise?

It’s really hard for a hotel that claims to be luxurious to have such poor hardware, software, services, and facilities. Moreover, the above problems have been reflected in other guest reviews two years ago, but they have not been resolved until now. It’s really hard to understand. Confidence

I hope netizens who see this comment can avoid lightning

msg:It’s been a long time since I’ve reviewed a hotel. Let’s just say that we booked the hotel 2 months in advance for our trip to the Northwest Ring Road and arrived at 10:30 pm on the day of check-in! The security guard in the parking lot was very nice and guided the parking. The front desk of the hotel is on the 21st floor! When we arrived at the front desk, we were told that the room we checked in that day had not been cleaned and needed to be cleaned again. We pointed out that this was your work error and asked the hotel to upgrade. We were told that upgrades were not allowed when the room was full, and the cleaning staff had already left work. They needed to be recalled for cleaning and had to wait for an hour. above! Because there were two children traveling with me, the children were very tired, so I was very angry at the time! The front desk called their so-called manager, who also emphasized that the room was full and could not be upgraded, so he had to wait 1 to 2 hours! We called Ctrip to make a complaint. Fortunately, Ctrip acted in a timely manner and spoke very skillfully. It calmed the emotions of our colleagues and helped us communicate with the hotel to solve the problem within 15 minutes. Miraculously, the hotel had rooms again! Because I have emotions, I don’t want to complain in the room! I don’t think all negative reviews are excessive!

I had no choice but to close the door, and they weren’t even offered a room change!
The TV is also broken and no one came to fix it even when I called.
When I checked out, because my flight was at 6 o'clock, I called the front desk to ask for a late checkout, but they didn't agree!

msg:The service at this Kaiyuan restaurant is disappointing. The reservation was successfully made through Ctrip. I checked in at 11 o'clock in the middle of the night. The front desk hesitated and said there was no room. I was speechless. We drove for three hours and were extremely tired. After questioning, the other party turned out to own a house again. During the process, a guest would come over and ask the front desk to add magnets to the card, and a guest would come over and ask the front desk to swipe the card and get on the elevator. The front desk was so busy that the management chaos was evident. I finally got it done and went upstairs. There was a room next to the security door, which was a side room of the suite. There was a smell of stagnant air. I wanted to turn on the air conditioner and ventilate it. I called 0 to find customer service. The customer service said: Our store is at 8:30. Then the air conditioning system failed, and the solution was to open the windows for ventilation. I asked them if the air conditioner was faulty only in this room or in all rooms? Customer service informed me that the air conditioners in all rooms were out of order. I'm really angry: Didn't you remind me when the air conditioner broke down when I checked in? Customer Service: As you said, we reluctantly found a room for you. Me: I made a successful reservation through Ctrip, but the reservation is successful but the room is no longer available? Trouble with customers most of the night. Besides, where can’t you live if you have money? It’s not like I have to live here. The other party hung up the phone. Before seven o'clock in the morning, the safety door kept opening and closing, making a squeaking sound. I went out and saw that there was a working elevator on the other side of the safety door. It was a Shaomin cleaning lady who was dragging things in and out with a trailer. I followed She said keep it down, she stared at me, and after two seconds she said yes. But she didn't whisper, and continued to open and close the door loudly. I had no choice but to get up and clean up, after all, we were on someone else’s territory. This is the hotel with the worst service I have ever stayed in. During my trip to Qinggan, I have also stayed in B&Bs and county hotels with poor conditions, but the service attitude was good. Only this Kaiyuan hotel is disappointing.

It feels like I'm staying in a fake Kaiyuan brand hotel. Many items in the room are still labeled with the name of the previous hotel. I booked it for the Kaiyuan brand. After knowing the truth, I will never book again, so I didn’t want to stay there after only one day. Bath towels and towels are actually placed in the shower room.

msg:First of all, don’t be misled by Kaiyuan. The invoicing record is Haidiya. The hotel management and hardware facilities cannot be compared with Kaiyuan. In fact, it is just an ordinary hotel.
Let’s talk about the shortcomings first: 1. The room facilities are old, there is a peculiar smell when entering, and the outer windows are thickly covered with dust; 2. If you order food in the hotel, the price is basically twice that of the outside. A bowl of rice costs 8 yuan, and fried meat with green peppers is 78 yuan.
Let me talk about the advantages: 1. The room and bathroom are very large; 2. The location is good, there is Xining Tourist Night Market nearby, which contains many northwest specialties.
In short, under the name of Kaiyuan, it provides general hotel services and charges five-star hotel room fees, misleading consumers. This marketing model is really disappointing. . .

I didn't feel anything at the time. Then when I was picking up the takeaway, I found that the door to my room couldn't be closed! ! ! I repeatedly confirmed that either I couldn't close it, or the door was broken! This configuration is a five star hotel.
       When I finally boiled water, I found that there was no basic layout. I wanted to plug in the computer power cord, but it was difficult to plug in the kettle. I can't plug the kettle into the bedside... I went in and looked at the sanitation. Okay, but I walked around in slippers (normal range of motion) and you see what I stepped on...
       Finally, I want to complain that I specially booked a room with breakfast for the so-called five-star breakfast, but I was very disappointed!
       The overall evaluation is just over 3 stars for the room, so don’t expect it!

msg:I was traveling as a group of three and booked a family quadruple room in an apar**ent. The person who checked in gave me a double bed room. When I called to ask, he tried to fool me and told me that I was given a quadruple room in an apar**ent. The quadruple room in the apar**ent had three beds. I knew something was wrong at first glance, and I still wanted to get away with it. Seeing that they couldn't deceive me, the staff said that there were no more quadruple rooms in the apar**ent. They made various excuses and said that the reservation depar**ent had made a mistake. If the reservation depar**ent really made a mistake, why did I insist that I was given an apar**ent with a quadruple room when I called? This kind of dishonest hotel can actually be listed on Ctrip's high-quality merchants. It has ruined both its own brand and Ctrip's brand. The hotel gave a series of insincere solutions (for example: two extra beds in the double room for free. If I want to sleep in an extra bed, I can just book an extra bed in a standard room, which is cheaper than a quadruple room in an apar**ent. ), and finally, at my insistence, I was given another standard room. I thought I could finally sleep peacefully, but as a result, the bedding in the standard room was not changed and the water in the sink was blocked. The water in the shower room of the king bed room was blocked and the hair dryer was broken. How did such a hotel get a 5-star rating? !

大堂在21樓，我們得把車子停到B2層，然後去大堂辦理入住。
我們是老年人，出門自駕行李較多，特地帶了輛露營車，但是在西寧開元就遇到了麻煩，這麼陡的坡道，加上排水溝上的蓋板，露營車輪子較窄，要嵌近排水槽，根本無法從斜坡上進入電梯廳，衹能兩個人把車子搬上去。雖然我們已經67歲了，還好還存了一點體力。
地下停車庫無論是清潔程度，還是指示系統，根本就跟酒店的品牌配不上，客人完全是要靠自助。
我們卸下行李之後找不到電梯廳的位置，也沒有找到指示牌，就問邊上另外一輛車的人員，他們説他們也不知道電梯廳在哪裡。
最令人詬病的就是那個坡道，這個樣子如果是輪椅能上去嗎？改一下需要很多錢嗎？是笨還是懶？

msg:這是我住過最差勁的一家“開元”，一度懷疑這是不是真的開元！

首先，房間打掃馬虎，地上有毛髮和白色污物，洗手間下水慢

其次，房間不提供空調之前預訂並未告知！我們午飯時間入住被告知沒空調，安排的房間還是朝西的，西曬厲害，整個房間一股熱氣…整個房間的温度自始至終在33度左右，就連半夜1點都是32度

第三，也是最令人氣憤的，從入住到晚上我們和酒店溝通多次，得到的反饋是今天下午會開空調（投訴的客人應該不止我們一家），但要到晚上才能製冷，因為要前期準備工作…我們信了！於是我們沒有換房間，直到晚上回到房間才發現整個房間被太陽西曬後依然很熱…於是連續打電話溝通後總算送來個電扇…可悲催的是酒店壓根就在撒謊，晚上也壓根沒有空調…我們熱了一個晚上，頭痛的整晚沒有睡好…而酒店依然沒有一點歉意，甚至説沒有空調一事他們也沒辦法！你沒空調還吹什麼牛晚上會有空調…？！

總之，一個五星級的酒店為了節約成本不開空調還撒慌敷衍客人，真的是令我們非常憤慨！如果酒店不能提供空調應該在預訂時就明確告知，客人有權選擇住與不住…出現問題後對於客人的合理訴求並不是感同身受的去解決，而是毫無歉意的敷衍真的不配五星！

P S：作為攜程老客户我向來本着實事求是的態度為每個住過的酒店做真實點評
