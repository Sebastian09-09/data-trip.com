We were in the area to look for short term accommodation for our child and thoroughly enjoyed exploring the hotel and its surroundings. We had the opportunity to enjoy the gym at Chuan, evening meal at the Chinese restaurant on the 3/F and the buffet breakfast. Service at all venues was impeccable. I must add that customer service at the breakfast was excellent. The manager was very attentive and even came over to greet us and chatted briefly. The metro station was a short 5 min walk, but unfortunately it’s not undercover, so if it’s raining like the day we arrived you’ll need an umbrella. 

At the moment, there is some construction work at the hotel and when we booked it already mentioned there would be noise between 9am to 6pm. The disturbance was actually quite minimal.  Maybe it was because we were on the 13th floor so didn’t really hear any construction disturbances.

If you do come, definitely bring swimming gear as the gym overlooked the swimming pool and it looked fabulous.

msg:Didn’t expect much when we booked the hotel. Unexpectedly we got upgraded to executive room when we checked in and free breakfast was offered to four of us. This exception added to the exceptional service provided by the hotel.

The room was not a big one but very cosy and comfortable. It was clean and well equipped with all sort of accessories that we need. I am particularly fond of its hair dryer as it appeared to be completely brand new. The room was facing south so it only had a village view rather than a fantastic skyscraper view. The north facing one may be better.

The breakfast buffet was great. The place was spacious and offered a great variety of food. It would be better if the cold cut and cheese can be refilled more frequently. 

Overall our two nights stay were really pleasant and comfortable. We would definitely book this hotel again when we visit Guangzhou next time. One special thank you is to be given to Cion Hu who helped us to settle down quickly upon check in.

Room spacious, but the toilet shower floor drain stuck and cleaner not found it during cleaning after 3 nights. The front desk was helpful and friendly, named Krystal extend our check out time till 2pm. Hotel environment was cozy and comfortable with liveband at buffet restaurant and bar every night. Buffet at 4th floor was so so with high price. Chinese cuisine restaurant 3rd floor Ming Ge food was very good, forget about buffet if you have higher budget. Overall clean and comfortable stay, if there is direct underground access from hotel to train station or the opposite exhibition will be perfect, as walking outside during summer to exhibition hall entrance will take you fastest 20mins with full of sweats.

From the moment we arrived, everyone was so helpful and the free upgrade to a room with an awesome view of the exhibition centre and river just started the whole experience. Upon leaving, I was literally speechless on how our stays can be improved. But thinking more carefully, the Chinese address on the key card could be a little larger so Taxi drivers can read it as we don't speak Mandarin. We never took the metro and its around 40rmb taxi trip to beijing road and places around there which suited our needs.

She went out of her way for us especially when decorating the room for my friends birthday, it was beautiful and amazing. The executive lounge was on the roof and it had outside seating where you could see the river. The room was nice and had English movie channels. The food and drinks were outstanding a proper western buffet. The massage was delightful and a beautiful place. Almost everyone spoke English and the staff was great. The only con I had was that when did meutuan it doesn't come to the room you have to go downstairs and open a box using your phone this is my only grievance.

Unfortunately for us, the room was a little bit dusty on the top of some furniture but it’s was ok. 

During the canton fair , obviously there is a lack of employees since we have to wait more than 15 min for a Scramble egg! 

Last but not least, I saw drunk people throwing a bottle of beer on a guest while they are arguing in the lobby bar .. i’m still shocked! 

 We tried the sky bar…. No coffee after 10pm, for those who work late , you are informed 😔

Anyway, I’ll try Westin Next time…

Free standing bath tub is not commonly seen anywhere. 
Electric curtains are nice but they don't close tightly. You still have to manually put then together and seal them.  However providing the rails configuration the curtains can never overlap and sun beams come in the room in the early morning.

They helped me find a location to take a Covid test and the location to a luxury mall to shop. They have amazing art to admire that I found fascinating. The spa had a discount coupon that I had planned to use but my flight was canceled and I needed to use the time to book another hotel and flight. The 28th Interwine award ceremony was taking place so I had a chance to take a look. I took a relaxing bath in the comfortable bathtub and order room service to enjoy a delicious curry meal!

I guess the room hasn't been used for a while, I didn't want to change the room because I just wanted to sleep (I checked in close to midnight). I had a very nice experience a few months ago but this visit was not a nice experience compare to the last time.

The gorgeous lobby was filled with lingering sounds and there was a band performance. The room was tidy and clean. It is worthy of being an old star hotel. All the facilities are very international. The service was very good. Since we had high requirements for the room, the hotel staff always cooperated with us to change the room without getting tired of it. We were busy until very late, especially Jay and Yolanda, who had a very good attitude and very professional service. With a good mood, this business trip became very smooth.

Special thanks to the hotel for the small gift~ They also took the initiative to upgrade the room type, which is very lucky.
Environment: Personally, I feel that the hotel is very standard and suitable for business trips, without any unnecessary design. The button layout in the room is very user-friendly.
When you enter the room floor, you can actually smell that the hotel is old, but the hygiene and environment are kept neat and tidy. Although it is inevitable that the toilet seat is a bit icy and the hair dryer is a bit old.
It was already evening when we checked in, and it was raining heavily outside, so I chose to order in the room for dinner. The WeChat ordering app was quite convenient. The Hainanese chicken rice was delicious. The breakfast the next day tasted good too. Again, everything is in a very standard business style. It is not easy to do it well, but this hotel has done it, and the service is above the standard. The staff I met are very kind. Overall , living here is convenient and comfortable.
In addition, parking is convenient and free of charge.

As soon as I stepped into the Langham Place Guangzhou, the lobby of the hotel was spacious and bright, with exquisite decoration, which made people feel a strong artistic a**osphere. The front desk staff was warm and thoughtful, and they were patient and meticulous when checking in for us, which made me feel very cordial. My room is located on the upper floors of the hotel, with a wide view and a bustling scene of Guangzhou. The decoration in the room is simple and elegant, with complete facilities and comfortable beds, which made me feel the warmth of home. In addition, the sanitary conditions in the room are also very good. The transportation around the hotel is convenient, and it is close to major business districts and attractions in Guangzhou, which is convenient for us to travel.
In short, the Langham Place Guangzhou left a good impression on me, whether it is room quality, service level or geographical location. Here, I spent a pleasant holiday and felt the charm of the city of Guangzhou. I believe that whether it is a business trip or a leisure trip, the Langham Place Guangzhou is the best choice for a trip to Guangzhou.

msg:It was my first time to come to Guangzhou. I had stayed in Langham Place in Shanghai and Hefei, so I chose Langham Place as my first stop. However, no one helped me with my luggage when I arrived. I met Krystal’s enthusiastic guidance in 4L and left a good impression.
The doorman and security were watching when we arrived. When we left, the doorman helped load the luggage into the car.

I booked the master bedroom suite. The room size was OK and there was almost no view. There was a construction site outside. It was quite a surprise to have a small kitchen and a large refrigerator. Although I didn’t use it, I laid the foundation for it.

The service on the executive floor is satisfactory. They even taught me my room number in Cantonese, but the product is a bit simple.

The price of such a room is almost 2000, but I am still a little dissatisfied. The toilet is not smart, the hair dryer is old-fashioned and cannot be seen carefully, and all the wiring is leaking out. But the most uncomfortable thing is that I was woken up by the refrigerator in the living room and kitchen suddenly starting to operate in the middle of the night and had to get up. Close the door before going to sleep... The air conditioner outlet of the bedroom faces the bed... The shower door does not close properly and water flows outside after taking a shower. The network signal in the room is poor. In the shower room and the bathroom in the living room, only one bar is often disconnected.

There is a long queue for breakfast rice rolls but it is delicious. The swimming pool is 25*8 and there are not many people there in the morning. The experience is very good. There is no swimsuit quick-drying machine.

The black pants of the girl in 4L pink clothes are not as good-looking as other Langham black skirts.

Quick check out at the end and the deposit will be refunded quickly

Didn't have time to try Mingge

Although it was already very late, Grace still kept a smile on her face and helped us go through the formalities. She also took the initiative to ask if her companions were in good spirits when she saw that they were not in good spirits. Not feeling well allowed us to relax after our trip was delayed due to transportation.

It is very convenient to go to Zhujiang New Town CBD or Yuexiu Liwan Old Town. But more importantly, among hotels in the same price range, Langham Place has larger rooms. My favorite among them is Langham Place’s multi-facility service. You can enjoy a dry steam and a wet steam every morning after fitness, which is very important for people who need to maintain their health while traveling. In addition, Langham Place's Sichuan Spa brand is also highly recommended for both tourists and locals to experience the five-star service at a reasonable price. Sichuan's spa brand also has its own bathing and skin care system.

When we entered the lobby, the concierge greeted us very enthusiastically and took our suitcases and took us to the lobby to check in.

Just a comment. In the past, the parking service for guests staying in five-star hotels was to register for as many days as they wanted. Because every time you go out, you need to go to the front desk to register and scan the QR code to park. It is really troublesome. I hope you will consider it, especially if you have stayed continuously before. a bit inconvenient
Staying in hotels is getting better and better

msg:It was my birthday on the day of check-in. The front desk upgraded the room to a room with a better view and also gave me chocolates, fruits and 4 pieces of wife cake. The room feels very comfortable and does not feel old. The bed is very large and very comfortable. If necessary, you can call the service center to ask for different types of pillows. It is very considerate. If you order takeout, you need to go to the self-pickup locker outside the hotel, which is more inconvenient. In addition, the location of the hotel is also very inconvenient. Maybe because of the traffic jam in Guangzhou, it takes more than 15 minutes (taxi) to go to many places. The only hotel bus going to Chimelong runs twice in the morning at 8:30 and 10:00. Overall, this hotel is very good. The experience is pretty good. I recommend staying there!

The receptionist was friendly and kind, and helped me upgrade the room to the executive floor on the 21st floor. The view overlooks the river. I can also use the Langham Club on the 22nd floor, which provides free drinks, coffee and peanuts, and can also access the Internet. The environment is very good peaceful. The wireless network is very stable and fast, and there are no restrictions on foreign websites. It is very convenient for me. Although I can use my own card and two numbers to access it, I don’t have much mainland traffic, so this is quite good. The only drawback is that the parking lot is not very friendly to Hong Kong license plates. I failed to get in and out several times and needed to be handled manually. Now many places in Zhuhai can correctly identify Hong Kong license plates, and I hope the hotel can follow up on this issue. Overall, I give the hotel five stars and will stay there next time.

During my recent stay, I met Joey and Rebecca on duty, which made me fall in love with this hotel. When I checked in, when I asked the staff next to me where is the best place to have soup near the hotel, the lovely Rebecca playfully said, "Ask me, ask me, I'm from Guangzhou."

When I saw in the customer record that I had checked in multiple times and often arrived very late, I took the initiative to ask if I was satisfied with the suite I had stayed in before and if I wanted to stay in my favorite room type again... and I was told to go home. The feeling gave me enough dignity in front of my business partners!

Thanks to Joey for his business insight and Rebecca for allowing us to taste Guangzhou delicacies smoothly!

I will definitely stay at Langham Place Nanfeng next time I go to Guangzhou.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. It is opposite the Canton Fair. The lobby is on the 4th floor. It is spacious and bright. The Chinese restaurant on the third floor is very retro and beautiful. The sliced ​​duck is delicious. The breakfast on the 4th floor is also very good. I stayed in the executive river view room for a few days and it was very nice. Beautiful, but the only regret is that the twin bed is too small and the mattress is a bit uncomfortable. I have stayed in many international five-star hotels in the past and the twin beds are usually 1.35 meters long, which is a bit unsatisfactory.

I have lived in the Langham Hotel in Shenzhen for a long time. It is of the same brand. When I arrive at Langham Place in Guangzhou, I will feel a sense of familiarity.
Stable high-quality service, comfortable and clean environment, toiletries and the hotel's fragrance are my favorite, the soothing and soothing scent of ginger flower.
The wife cake presented by Check out is very delicate and can be directly used as a souvenir, which is very considerate.
Ginger milk ice cream is super delicious, thanks to Abby for her warm service, I will recommend this super cost-effective full-score hotel to everyone around me^_^

msg:I bought the 799 set meal without a price increase on May 1st. I think it is very cost-effective. When I checked in at the store, the front desk arranged room 1417. I was satisfied because I like to be quiet and see that it is far away from the end of the elevator corridor. I didn’t expect it to be a double-sided room. The glass corner room faces the river view on one side, and the building next to it on the other side, with a wide view, which immediately improves the sense of space, and the shortcomings of the small area are basically ignored. Wet and dry are separated, the facilities are complete, there are ironing equipment, and the thick and new bath towels are placed three directly, which is very considerate. It is very friendly to people like me who have to take a bath in the morning and evening, and the bath water is also very large. These are enough for me Accommodation requested. In addition, the breakfast is also very rich. The raw porridge is a must. It is not inferior to the special porridge shop. As a result, I can’t eat too much for lunch. The hotel is about three to five minutes’ walk from the subway station. There is a greenway at the door for walking and cycling , the surrounding environment is very clean.

Exhibition: It is only a few hundred meters walk from the Canton Fair venue, very convenient, the hotel building is very large (I thought it was just a small house)😝
Lobby: Go up to the fourth floor and come to the lobby. The young lady in the pink fragrance at the front desk guides you to check in. All the staff are very polite. The decoration of the lobby is very nice. Pink + flowers should be their theme, but unfortunately I forgot to take a photo 🥹
Room: clean, tidy, quiet, sound insulation effect is very good, the photo taken in the atrium looks very nice 👏🏻
Facilities: I didn't have time to go to the swimming pool and spa, but the lobby bar and terrace are really nice. As a senior musician, I still think the performances in the lobby bar are very high-end, very comfortable, and the sound does not disturb the a**osphere. Drinking a glass of whiskey on the terrace at night to relax, it is very healing
Last but not least: highly recommended! This home can rest assured!

msg:The worst hotel experience in Guangzhou
1. My friend and I booked the same room type on the same day. My friend booked through **, checked in at the hotel, and left directly after checking out. I booked through Ctrip, and I had to pay a double deposit in advance when I arrived at the hotel. The deposit was refunded after 3 working days of check-out. The key is that booking through ** is a few dollars cheaper than Ctrip.
2. The room facilities are seriously aging, the bed headboard is all cracked, and the room is old.
3. There are few types of breakfast, and the taste is unsatisfactory. The front desk said that breakfast is until 10:30, but the actual restaurant notified that it will end at 10 o'clock.
4. The hotel did not mention the various rights and interests promised by Ctrip.

There are too many people in the breakfast lobby, it would be perfect if breakfast is served in the lounge

The hotel is a British brand, and you will see some British layouts, such as the floor display at the elevator entrance, which is very characteristic. The younger brother of the hotel staff I met in the elevator also had a delicate hair comb and gold-rimmed glasses.
The size of the room is moderate, but I don't know if it is because of the low season, the small cards in the room are all dusty. In addition, the preferential price of Sichuan spa must only be between 15 o'clock and 19 o'clock, otherwise there will be a difference of one or two hundred yuan.

msg:Thinking about finding a hotel to lie down and resting in Guangzhou if I can’t leave Guangzhou during the New Year’s Eve, I specially booked a suite with executive benefits.
Let’s talk about the room first. I gave room 1915, which is a corner room. I didn’t even bother to take pictures when I entered it. It felt like a so-called suite that was abruptly separated from the ordinary corner rooms of international chain hotels. I took a look at the room type map and saw that the other common room type maps are all small, so it's better to just open up and make a larger room.
Due to the small number of people, the executive lounge is not open, so the executive reception is in the lobby. HH is a set meal. The staple food on the first night is fried dumplings and fried spring rolls. I had no desire to eat it the next day.
The room has no view at all, surrounded by tall buildings, basically facing the river view.
It can only be said that there is no harm if there is no comparison, because I came from the Aoyuan Sheraton the night before, and the room and the other party did not have a lounge. The service is really bad, but the price is not much different.
Probably the last time to visit this hotel. For this price, I personally recommend going to the Westin next door, at least the room is much more comfortable.

Buffet: The breakfast on the first floor is not rich enough. On weekends, oyster and seafood buffet dinner. Except for shellfish, seafood can be fried, and the rest are frozen, and oysters are only eaten raw. In the ongoing epidemic era, it is strongly recommended to increase the number of guests You can choose to eat steamed oysters and each guest's small hot pot, frozen seafood can be heated, and oysters can also be cooked and eaten! At that time, I tried to communicate with the staff who processed shellfish and seafood, hoping to help steam oysters in a steamer, but I was indifferently and bluntly rejected. This is a very bad experience! Because the shellfish pond actually provides steaming services, why can't oysters be steamed? Hope to improve next time!

They are put on ice after they are cooked. There are raw oysters, which can only be eaten raw, not cooked. Does it take into account that some guests are not suitable for eating raw food at all? And wouldn't it be great to let guests eat seafood on ice?

Overall, the stay is very comfortable and the environment is also very good, but the dinner was a bit disappointing. Hope to improve it, don't let people down for cost savings!

Service: I can give 5 points, thank you vicky and crystal for their very good service.

There is an open-air terrace above the executive corridor, and you can have a bird's-eye view of the river in the east of Pazhou. It is especially recommended to go to the terrace for a bird's-eye view at night. If you look at the weather forecast one night in advance, if the weather conditions permit, you can see the sunrise on the second day as long as you look towards the riverside of the terrace. The swimming pool is quite satisfactory, and the fitness place is relatively small.
Food: The snacks in the executive lounge are a little lacking, and there are fewer types. Ming Ge Chinese Restaurant's products are pretty good, except for one fried rice that is tough.
Thanks to Ctrip for helping to coordinate the check-in time, and it still reduced a lot of unnecessary friction.

msg:The hotel is adjacent to the Canton Fair Complex. It is about a 10-minute walk from Xingang East Station to the hotel. It is very convenient for green travel or self-driving. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to Huangpu Ancient Port, Padi, Canton Tower, etc. The geographical location is related to the lack of life in the surrounding area. There are fewer restaurants, convenience stores, etc.
The hotel combines modern elegance and urban charm, with a strong sense of design, novel and unique, and it is worth visiting everywhere. Although it is a hotel opened in 13 years, the overall maintenance is good. The lobby is located on the fourth floor. The front desk has a friendly service attitude. The check-in speed is fast. Disposable toiletries can be collected at the front desk. Members can check out for free. You can also ask if you can upgrade the room.
What is more satisfactory is that all functional areas are concentrated on the fourth floor, eliminating the trouble of switching between layers. The gym and indoor swimming pool are hidden in the Chuan Spa. The gym is not big, with complete equipment and newer equipment. The indoor constant temperature swimming pool has good water quality, and there are slightly more people during the summer. The Langham Club is on the 22nd floor. Guests staying in executive rooms can check in and check out here. The service is good and comfortable. They can enjoy happy hour and other exclusive services here. Chatting and blowing hair is very comfortable.
I stayed in an executive room on that day. The corridor with the back-shaped structure has quite a visual impact. The room is large, the environment is comfortable, low-key and elegant, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows provide a wide field of vision. However, the scenery of Huangpu Chung is not very good. The curtains are electric, only It can be fully turned on and off, the room facilities are all available, there are many types of pillows, the mattress is mousse, I have to say that it is very comfortable, I can sleep in seconds for those who recognize the bed, and the room has good sound insulation, and the air conditioner operates very quietly. Corridor carpets also effectively reduce noise, which is a blessing for light sleepers! But there is no socket by the bed. The washroom and shower room are large and the water pressure is sufficient, but the bathtub is slightly smaller. The shower gel, shampoo, etc. are its own brand "Chuan" SPA. The rosemary series is quite soothing, and it feels okay to use. The only downside is the washroom. There is no clothes basket, and the hooks are not enough. I don't know where to put the towels and bath towels after use. In addition, the bathroom is only separated from the outside world by glass, which is a little embarrassing.
The overall check-in experience is good, the service is in place, the guest is at home, and the price-performance ratio is high. If non-business people have a demand for the exhibition, it is quite suitable for weekend relaxation.

The little brother in the lobby on the first floor couldn't help with the luggage at all, and asked us to park in the garage and then go up to check in. After checking in, in the middle of the night, the phone rang for no reason, but no one spoke when I picked it up, which was quite scary. Later, I called the front desk and asked to find out what was going on. They said it was a mistake made by the food delivery depar**ent. I was so speechless. The solution was to ask us to unplug the phone line... Anyway, the whole experience was average, and I didn't live in a five-star hotel. Class hotel feel.

Even the two-year-old baby's birthday, I wanted to give a cake, I said it was time to look at it, and then I didn't write any more. The two male front desk staff in the executive lounge are indeed warm-hearted like their friends. Seeing the foreigner coming, his face was obviously different. Only give four stars, is to deduct the service. Hope the hotel management will take a look. Improve the appearance of the front desk staff in the executive lounge.

msg:🔔Service: The stay experience was very good. I would like to thank Ricky and Rose in the executive lounge. The two Happy Hours I went to during the stay were very conscientious, patient and sincere, and Krystal, the customer service ambassador who helped me, knew me. Proactively provide solutions upon demand.

🍃Environment: This time I stayed for two days, the front desk was upgraded to an executive room for free, giving executive treatment, I don’t know if it has been refurbished, the room is very new, the shower is Hansgrohe, there are many different pillows to choose from, I like to sleep on the side , so I chose a sponge pillow and a long pillow, but the strange thing is that the long pillow does not have a matching pillowcase, I hope it can be improved.

🧹Hygiene: The hygiene is very good, there is no scale and water marks on the bathroom hardware, the bed is also very flat without creases, there is no dust on the table shelf, the only flaw is that the spa promotion card in the bathroom is slightly outdated, I hope to check and replace it .

🚗 Transportation: Generally speaking, it is quite convenient. If it takes less than ten minutes to ride to Xingangdong subway station, it is better to be surrounded by exhibition halls, which are quiet and peaceful, and there will be no complicated feeling of people.

🍝Food and Beverage: There are plenty of choices for breakfast, including Western and Chinese hot food. The porridge, noodles, cheese and salami in the single product are all good. Vegetables and fruits can be eaten very fresh, but hot soy milk and hot food are not hot enough. Breakfast started at 6:30, and it was already cold at 8:00.

The Happy Hour in the Executive Lounge in the evening is equivalent to an a la carte buffet, but the items in the package can be added to the order. The menu on the first night of the stay is richer. On the second night, the main food pork dumplings were replaced with fried golden prawns. , and I don't know if it is the spring rolls made with breakfast. The fried food is a bit too much, and it is relatively repetitive. I hope the hotel can pay attention to the overall matching when changing the dishes.

The sea**** and mini croissants on the sushi are damp and soft, and they should have been stored for a long time. The fish and chips are not crispy enough. At least the chicken wings are hot when they are re-fried in hot oil, but the sandwiches and desserts are very good. The overall seasoning is good, but the production is poor. Although it is free, if you don't pay enough attention, it will become a deduction item.

There is also a small episode. On the second night, I thought that there was a problem with the combination of the set menu. There were too many fried foods. I asked if we could provide additional main dishes. The catering department only wanted me to pay extra to order. I wouldn't accept such a proposal. 🙂

The service of Sam and Claudia at the front desk was 100%. Seeing that I came with my child and my parents, I upgraded the room type for free and gave two beautiful roses. He also kindly pointed us to the elevator and the location for breakfast tomorrow. If your store has a staff star rating, please be sure to give Sam and Claudia a point. The room is fully equipped. The fly in the oin**ent is that there are no special supplies for children, but it is understandable. , after all, the positioning here is the exhibition hotel. Welcome fruits and macarons are not ambiguous at all. Macarons are delicious, and they are perfect with a cup of coffee to relieve tiredness! Dad spoke highly of the swimming pool. Although the fitness center is not big, the facilities are still complete. During the entire stay at the hotel, the only thing I wanted to complain about was the breakfast, which was not proportional to the price, which surprised me a bit. Looking forward to the next meeting ❤❤

It's really charcoal in the snow! From 5:30-8:00 in the evening, you can go to the Executive Lounge on the 22nd floor for snacks and drinks. We finished our work and entered around 7:00. The two of us were too tired and hungry. After a lot of snacks, I drank sparkling wine, and then the beautiful lady in the lounge made me a beautiful cocktail, and finally a glass of red wine. It was such a beautiful night. Perfect, will stay at this hotel again in the future.

Stayed for three days and gave me a free room upgrade and late check out. Asked several times how the stay was. There is also a pillow menu in the room, so attentive. There is also a complimentary afternoon tea and free parking for one day.

msg:Chinese New Year stay at Langham Place
The overall feeling is good, quiet and safe.
Location: Near the Canton Plaza, the subway Xingang East Station, but not directly on the subway, it takes 5-6 minutes to get out of the subway. It is recommended to come by car, guests can park for free.

Environment: The overall business minimalist style, the lobby is not luxurious. The lobby is on the fourth floor, and there is an internet celebrity afternoon tea set, but there are not many tables and chairs, so you should book it in advance. There are three types of tables and chairs in the lobby, but I feel that the tables and chairs are too crowded. But for business, privacy is normal.

Facilities: There is a heated swimming pool, SPA. Didn't experience this part this time.

Safety: You need to swipe the room card to enter the guest room, which is safe and secure.

Guest room: This time, the [River View King Room] has been upgraded. Although the scenery is not Linjiang, it is separated from the Canton Fair in front, and you still feel the business aura. The room has a bathtub, but the size is a single person.

Service: The front desk is very polite, and can generally meet any special small requirements, such as checking out the room status and delaying check-out for a few hours. In the guest room, I also called several times to ask for mineral water, edible ice cubes, and free shoe shine service. [Naughty]

Catering: There is afternoon tea in the lobby in the afternoon, and there is a buffet restaurant (but the category is average). The buffet breakfast is added at the time of temporary check-in, which is more expensive. If you make a reservation, you can add it in advance on some platforms in advance. The tables and chairs are also a little crowded. I feel that during the non-business season, there are not many people in the restaurant anyway, so there is no need to put them so crowded. . . . I don't understand, maybe there are a lot of people during the business exhibition?
Western restaurants and Michelin-recommended restaurants may be tried, but buffets are fine (maybe I have higher requirements for buffets)

The skybar is a good place to take pictures, but it's too cold at night. Maybe summer is a great place to drink. There were 300 minus 100 vouchers at the Spring Festival, I don't know if there will be any more in the future


Overall, suitable for business people. Usually the price is not high, if you go on a leisure vacation, you can find a place for cost-effectiveness. But not resort style.

After staying for three days, the children downstairs were so noisy that I couldn't rest well. A group of children in fancy clothes were walking in the hotel. Come and go! You have to check your room card in the last elevator, and customers will have to talk to you for a long time to keep up. The work efficiency is low, mainly because it is very troublesome to get on and off the elevator, and the security attitude is not very good. Afternoon tea and breakfast are ok. But the experience of the conference these days is really bad

The comfortable bedding is as soft as other star hotels. It is very soft and good to fall asleep.

I didn't expect that I could order food at the hotel at twelve o'clock in the middle of the night and send it to the room. Hahaha. After eating, I could ring the bell to take it away. When I checked out, the personal itinerary was a little later. The front desk extended it for half an hour for free. Thank you so much!

msg:Langham Place Nanfeng used to have a period of time when we would come to stay for a few days for dinner and vacation or something, and several years have passed in the blink of an eye. This time because of the exhibition, I feel that in general, apart from getting a little older, the front desk service is still okay. Although it feels a bit cold, it should be during peak hours and there are more guests and understand. It is worthy of praise that the front desk staff is very careful to check the health code itinerary code, so that the hotel guests are very relieved in the epidemic. In the executive room booked, there are still customers who smoke in the room unconsciously, which makes the room full of smoke, and it should have been a hotel for several years after all, and the air-conditioning is insufficient, so the call staff asked the staff to remove the smoke and repair the air-conditioning, and the response was very prompt. The room staff and maintenance staff praised it. The hotel restaurant has business lunches and can be recommended for affordable prices. The most commendable is the executive lounge, all service staff smile and serve, and the level of business is high, the environment is clean and tidy and comfortable, the food is very delicious and delicious, and the business level is higher than that of the nearby Shangri-La and Westin executive lounges. Concentrated and very satisfied. Very recommended!

It is not convenient to travel, and the decoration is too old. The price of more than 700 houses is very poor, and I found that Ctrip’s recent house prices are generally much more expensive than other platforms.

On the 12th, I showed my ID and my child’s ID to check in. However, after checking in, the front desk told me "sir, the child needs to check in". Talking is very yin and yang, as if I would not let them check in for children. In fact, when I checked in, the ID of my child and I were given to him. Did she ask me to enter the information of myself and the child into the public security system and computer by myself? From his contemptuous eyes, I read the possibility.
Overall, very poor front desk staff! For a hotel of Langham Place, this service is not as good as an express hotel, I love to guess.

As a consumer rights and interests can give a statement, no refund can, is the hotel or Trip.com lying to deceive customers? It is really surprising that there is no professional ethics in the operation of the big platform and five-star hotels!

酒店自帶的枕頭老婆反饋稍微有點高，但是有很多種備選。第二天請服務員換了枕頭。服務員幫我們換了兩個新的枕頭，都很舒服。
最後一天，因為我們行程比較晚，和前台小姐姐Nikki溝通了下，幫我們協調到了延遲退房。非常感謝。
其他，酒店地理位置不錯，過年期間打車方便。
贈送的老婆餅非常好吃，不甜不膩。
健身房24小時，設施非常齊全。游泳池沒機會體驗，等下次。
最後，我第二次掉東西到朗豪了，也是麻煩幫忙郵寄回來的。

自助早餐好食，蛋類就已經有5種
酒店房空調足夠
酒店外觀獨特，不會難搵
酒店附近近地鐵
但晚上6點後就會超寧靜
如果參觀展覽，是不錯的選擇

krystal提前一晚電話聯繫我 詢問我們的行程還有對房間的要求 由於當天飛機延誤 很晚才到酒店 給我們做了升房並且送了水果和馬卡龍 感受到了暖暖的温情！
原本的床墊有些過軟了 睡不太慣 給我們換了棕櫚墊，舒服多了。外賣也是可以打電話拜託前台機器人送上來的，整體感覺都非常好！以後再有外出，還會住這家企業酒店！

msg:酒店運營服務和管理人員素質和五星管理標準差距太大。
1） 關於酒店管理層管理準則：
我們套餐是包含春節期間提供免費小巴去長隆，8:30開車，我們八點20到達，有一位素質差的女住客直接拿包占位、導致我們現場到達的顧客無法準時乘坐。
要求酒店管理人員和司機予以解決，司機蠻橫無力，態度極差，要求我們下車。
酒店大堂經理和值班經理無能（見圖）漠視文明和規則。提前佔座這種不文明現象發生在一線廣州的五星酒店的管理規則中。
沒有運力就不要搞這種春節期間包車服務，我們從上海過來玩也不差這趟車費，酒店服務無力解決，感歎廣州不配一線城市的管理。
2）關於預訂樓層服務：我們定了兩間，有長者，方便照顧，要求前台調配到同一樓層，多次協調後還是給了兩個不同樓層。現場看到同一層很多空間，未有滿房。
3） 關於客户體驗：春節那麼重要的節日，對外給客人的體驗很差，寫春聯，福字都沒有任何工作人員指引，隨意把紅紙堆在桌台底下。
4） 關於飲食：早餐牛奶非鮮牛奶。奶粉沖一沖。太拉胯了。

有一點就是酒店的管理有疏漏，因為客人離店時送老婆餅，可能是酒店工作人員並不核對客人房間訊息就給了老婆餅，導致我取的時候，被告知我的房間已經取過了，但是我並沒有，就很尷尬。


設施：比較新，但是1004房間床頭靠近洗手間一側的電源完全沒電

衞生：很乾凈

環境：很舒適温馨，一進酒店就有一股清香，整個4樓大廳（辦理入住在4樓，1樓會有人引領）都很清香。

服務：每個人的態度都很親切，電梯口遇到的工作人員會主動打招呼

自製傳統老婆餅一盒: 味道還可以

大堂很漂亮，有一朵超大的粉玫瑰塑像，房卡也是粉粉的，非常喜歡。但是沒有別的評論説的會送一朵粉玫瑰，桑心。
房間乾淨，衞生間很大。大落地窗外面有點臟，衹可遠觀不可近聞，而且其實朝江的這麪夜景沒什麼好看的，不是很繁華。。。
離地鐵站有一點點遠，要繞會展中心一圈才能走到。
最大的優點是隔音效果特別好，入住全程沒有聽到隔壁房間和走廊的任何聲音，這點超級好評。

2.鵝絨枕由於鵝絨墊會凹陷，導致鵝絨枕鵝絨會向上跑，睡到半夜需要把枕頭裡麪的鵝絨向頸部擠壓過來，否則沒支撐，沒有找前台問是否有塑料曲線枕，曲線枕實際上更有助於睡眠的脖頸支撐，防落枕

msg:團購了一份888的週末雙人行政套票，服務包含一晚住宿+兩份自助晚餐+兩份早餐+雞尾酒Happy Hour）。
優點:衹需提前一天電話預約即可
缺點:自助晚餐幾乎與Happy hour時間重疊
[糖果]作為一間豪華型的商務酒店，設計外觀是一大亮點，環境舒適衞生，服務周到禮貌，5星
❌設施方面:馬桶蓋放下時沒有緩沖，每次沖廁時不得不“從上到下”完成整個關閉過程，否則就會被嚇一大跳，4星
[噓]自助晚餐:食物新鮮、精緻，但品種不多，海鮮類衹有即開生蠔和三文魚刺身較為搶眼，其他都是普貨，其次就是各式甜品和雪糕。比較不滿的是生蠔衹能按每人每次1隻的數量落單，且等待時間越來越久，三文魚也是衹能每人每次1小份……4星
總體，團購性價比還是不錯的，值得推薦！

但是前台的入住手續繁瑣，按金收取規定，贈送的甜品食用規定等等，讓人覺得十分落後。

房間內的設計缺陷是行李格太小，如果行李箱大於登機箱，那麼會打門。

總體來説，服務體系是需要升級了
