After the exam, my parents asked me to go have morning tea, saying that it would make up for the overuse of my brain during this period, which was really satisfying! It turns out that the fourth floor of this hotel is for morning tea, so you don’t have to walk too far, which is great!

The room in this hotel is very clean and fully meets the service and standards of a five-star hotel. The breakfast feels better than that of a Hilton hotel. Forgot to take pictures! I was very hungry at the time, so I saw a set meal in the elevator and took a photo.
I wanted to write this while eating the buffet in the morning. This hotel offers so many dishes. How can I finish them all? It seems that the occupancy rate is good.

Haha, I rarely write reviews. Their service is really good and I even called for a return visit after checking in. I will definitely choose this hotel next time I go to Foshan.

Suddenly, at around 3am, all the lights in the room came on by themselves. These are buttons. You need to use some force to press them. It is not close to the bed and it is impossible to touch them by mistake. It is not a smart one. I called to ask and they said they were repairing the air conditioner in another room. I am not sure if it has anything to do with my room. As a result, it came on by itself again at around 4am. The staff was also confused and asked me if I wanted to change rooms... At 4am, there was no need to change rooms... There were bangs and bangs around, and I couldn't rest at all.
The room was big and clean, the bed was comfortable, and the staff was very nice. It was just that the lights came on by themselves in the middle of the night, which was hard to describe... It was said that it was because of the heavy rain...

msg:The hotel is clean and tidy, the rooms are bright and spacious, and the service attitude is good, especially the staff on duty in the lobby during the day are enthusiastic and proactive. But at night, the rooms on the Dangui Road side of the hotel are a bit noisy when large vehicles pass by, especially the noise from the entertainment dance hall in the hotel until 2 o'clock in the middle of the night, which seriously affects the rest and sleep of the guests.

The little brother at the front desk greeted me warmly and provided thoughtful service. You need to swipe your card to get on the elevator, which is good and safe. Room size: The lighting in the room is very good, but it looks gloomy on rainy days recently. The facilities are complete. The sparkling wine in the room is delicious. I bought another bottle before leaving. It looks good and tastes good. Hygiene: The rooms and public areas are also very clean. The overall environment is very comfortable, highly recommended, and will come again next time

msg:I have stayed in so many famous hotels in Foshan, but I must share the a**osphere and experience of this hotel. The hotel has complete facilities, and the decoration style is more business-like, which suits the tastes of business travelers. The bedding is clean, tidy and warm. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, without peculiar smell, and daily toiletries are also fully prepared. At first, I was attracted by his family's buffet dinner. When I went there, I found out that there is a chess and card room on the 2nd floor, and there are Chinese restaurants on the 3rd and 4th floors. Taste delicious food in the western restaurant in the evening, and you can enjoy Cantonese morning tea when you wake up in the morning; the service is very good, the service staff are warm and attentive, and there is a lot of luggage. They helped carry some luggage to the room and quickly opened the room for me. The scenery in front of the hotel is also beautiful. I heard that many guests took pictures under the pink tree. High cost performance, 300+ enjoy multiple experiences, suitable for business trips, parent-child, travel... It is also convenient to visit the surrounding tourist attractions, Nanhai Film and Television City, Ip Man Memorial Hall, Xiqiao Mountain, Ancestral Temple, Lingnan Xintiandi.

msg:It was a very good hotel experience. The epidemic cannot leave the city, so I took the children to the National Art Studios to play. After looking at many hotels, I finally chose this hotel. The front desk service is good, warm and heart-warming, helping to appease the crying baby. Free water, tea bags, and coffee bags are provided in the room. The price is moderate, the bed is moderately soft and hard, and the view outside the window is not bad. The bathroom is clean and tidy. The bathroom is divided into a shower and a bathtub. The water temperature is moderate. You need bath salts and harder pillows, and they will be delivered quickly. The transportation is convenient, there is a parking lot at the door, and there is a bus stop 100 meters away. There are convenience stores, free self-service laundry rooms, and swimming pools in the hotel. Clothes returned from swimming can be washed and dried in the laundry room. There are large supermarkets, delicious restaurants nearby (pork loin is recommended), Internet celebrity check-in spots Qiushan House, and Changle Water Park. The morning tea in the Chinese restaurant is really worth recommending, with ample portions, great taste, and affordable prices. Overall cost-effective, recommended! ! !

The attitude of the front desk is very good, the room is spacious and clean. Breakfast starts at 7 o'clock. I was too late to catch the plane. At 6:40, I asked the restaurant to cook a bowl of noodles and eggs for me. Thanks to the staff.
Take a taxi to the airport for 13 yuan, which should be the starting price. It takes about 5 minutes to drive there. I think it is not far from the train station. The transportation is very convenient.

I said what to pay, and a deposit at the end! In front of the house, I told her that the door should not face the stairs and the elevator, or arrange that the opposite is the stairs! I called to ask for an exchange, but the front desk said that I could change to the ninth floor. I went to the ninth floor with my luggage on the eighth floor. After at least ten minutes, no one came up. I called the front desk and asked a man to pick it up. I said what should I do? I didn't see anyone giving the room card. He said how did you get to the ninth floor? You think it's funny. Your front desk didn't say that I would go to the ninth floor**. I said your manager? Just say I am! Still saying that I shouldn't go to the ninth floor and there is no room! Later, I called the switchboard, and the young lady gave me the room card and changed the room! Checking out is also funny. I asked how to get the deposit back without asking me the room number. She said that I would go back the same way after checking the room! After 40 minutes, I called the switchboard to ask for a refund! definitely won't live again

The front desk staff were very nice. The room is clean and tidy, which is my favorite style. The room attendants are very polite, and they will knock on the door lightly before ringing the doorbell when delivering items. Because I have the habit of exercising every morning, I consulted the waiter and said that there is a gym on the right side of the lobby.

The boss should raise the salary of the sister who is on duty on the 26th and 27th! As a colleague, I am very fortunate to have such a responsible partner, so if there is no salary increase, be careful not to be poached!
Guangdong is really hot, and the air conditioners in the guest rooms are also very powerful. I can't get up and eat breakfast, but the breakfast culture of the people of Guangdong is still properly arranged!
I hope the details can be done better! Drop the agent to give people a better check-in experience!

The self-service laundry service is also recommended. It integrates washing and drying. There is an iron in the room, so you can wear clean clothes the next day. We returned to the room after eating the buffet in the evening and saw the swimming pool downstairs. We consulted the front desk and said that the hotel guests can swim for free. It is a hotel worth recommending, and we are very satisfied.

Dining guests walk back and forth, and the middle is the only passageway for room check-in. It is relatively crowded and easy to bump into each other.

我訂的是雙人房，和閨蜜一起住，房間面積大很寬敞，床很軟很舒服，服務也很好。設施齊全，房間內有大浴缸可以泡澡，還有很大的窗户，入住酒店停車是免費，房間衞生很乾凈。
中午入住的酒店，一進房間光線真的好好，也很安靜，剛好可以午休一下。晚餐就和閨蜜在酒店內的西餐廳吃海鮮自助晚餐，海鮮種類很多，有三文魚刺身、煎牛扒，還有網紅特飲，我們還點了mojito和鮮榨西瓜汁，很贊！可以説是吃喝玩樂一應俱全~總體驗感特別好，超級推薦！下次還會選擇入住佛山富林朗悦酒店。
