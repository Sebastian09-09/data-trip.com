1. Room Wifi not very stable, especially in the evening easy to be disconnected frequently.

2. Very limited parking space, difficult for driving newbies like me. And parking is not free but roughly ¬£10 per night.

Overall still satisfied, would reconsider this hotel next time I travel to SH.

Its location within walking distance of Nanjing Road, accompanied by nearby eateries, fruit stalls, and convenient stores, added a lot of convenience to our trip. The hotel impressed us with its cleanliness and modern amenities, and our kids particularly loved the delivery robot that brought food to our spacious room. The hotel staff's helpfulness and the ease of booking DiDi rides from the hotel made our stay even more pleasant. In summary, this hotel offers a great experience with its convenience and modern amenities, making it a great choice for a comfortable stay in the area. Highly recommended!

msg:THIS IS NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL. Don't get fooled by a star rating. The hotel doesn't have the basic amenities like room service or a 24 hour restaurant. The staff is terrible and not helpful at all. In fact the concierge ended up fleecing us twice because we asked him to book taxis for us which he did at much higher price than the meter and pocketed the rest. 

The rooms are stuffy and hot. They didn't have any air-conditioning or fan in the room. They asked us to keep a tiny window open in the room to make it pleasant enough to sleep. After a lot of complaining, they brought 2 pedestal fans in the room which basically occupied too much space in an already crowded room. 

2 double beds cannot accommodate 4 people. The double beds are extremely small and can accommodate one person and maybe a baby at most. 

All in all, a terrible experience and would not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel despite it's good location.

The night light in the room is acting weirdly. It kept going on and off as if the room was *******. :/ I could not sleep at all because of the light.

msg:Pros: 
- Within 1km of the bund and right next to Suzhou river which was a great place for an evening stroll 
- fairly new and clean, though some parts of the room was a little dusty 
- there was a laundry room and the machines were clean and easy to use. Detergent provided. 
- Hair dryer was powerful 
- Bed was firm and comfortable 
- There was a cushioned seat next to the window to enjoy the view from the room 

Cons:
- hotel lobby appeared messy 
- Room did not have a properwardrobe, there was just a small open rack for you to hang a few clothings
- No safety box to store valuable items, which was strange 
- Internet was not secure and not stable, it doesn‚Äôt work every now and then
- Room offered free streaming of China shows, however during Sat night there seemed to be too many users using the app at the same time, hence we were not able to watch the shows that we wanted as ‚Äútoo many users were on the account‚Äù 
- Drainage for the bathroom basin is a bit slow 
- upon checking out, we were asked to leave a good review online without even asked how was our experience staying in the hotel‚Ä¶

The interior design is really elegant, the location is just 5 minute walk from the subway station and it's very convenient to all the restaurants and the Bund. But I might say the breakfast is not good, because the choices are few and they don't have any spoon to use and the bread are so hard, they don't have any toaster. But overall stay, is good. Just the breakfast is lacking.

msg:The location is great and the price is relatively high. The service is also good, with robots delivering food to the room. The room facilities are very average, the bed is too hard, and I think the room comfort is far from the five-star standard. I was upgraded to a room with a balcony, but this room is in the most remote location, the layout is long and narrow, and it seems small. The balcony is like a pigeon cage, worthless, and it blocks the view of the room. Such an "upgraded room" is suspicious...

First of all, the location is convenient, very close to the Bund, Nanjing Road, and People's Square. The rooms are clean and spacious. The bedding is very comfortable, giving people a comfortable stay.
When we got off the bus, the concierge guy took the initiative to help us with our luggage and provide guidance. Miss Poppy at the hotel front desk also provided excellent service. She upgraded us to a panoramic king bed room with river view for free. Ms. Yueyue also helped us check out two days later. Late check out. The hotel's staff are also well trained and very polite. They will take the initiative to say hello when they come in and out. Check-in and check-out were very fast and there was no waiting at all.
The hotel is very new, and the night view of the Oriental Pearl Tower is the most cost-effective hotel, bar none!

The room is a river view room, and you can see the Huangpu River. The night is charming, and the lights outside the window are brilliant. You can enjoy the view of the Oriental Pearl Tower while lying on the bed. Color changes.

The overall decoration style of the hotel is novel, with some Chinese elements, giving people a warm and comfortable feeling. Although the breakfast provided by the hotel is similar to that of a fast hotel, you can order for free. Although there are not many varieties, some a la carte meals taste good, such as meat and vegetable wontons.

msg:It's a bit like a splendid exterior with rotten inside.
Location: Excellent, 5 minutes walk to Nanjing West Road Pedestrian Street, and on the other side Suzhou River you can see the three-piece set. In any case, this location is impeccable. You can feel both the prosperity and the a**osphere of the city.

Service: To be honest, the attitude is five-star, but the experience and training are obviously insufficient. Everyone is trying hard to be nicer to customers. The front desk lady helped me upgrade the room type, but I couldn't figure out the operation for a long time. The manager didn't teach me patiently, and another waiter was picking his nose next to me. . . Every concierge was super enthusiastic to help with the luggage, and then let us take a picture of the brand name and give a good review. To be honest, the overall training standard is really not like a five-star hotel, and it feels slightly flawed.
Environment: This is what I am more confused about. It is obviously a new hotel, but how can it be decorated like 20 years ago. The elevator hall wants to imitate Hermes orange, but the paint surface is really shocking. There are too many sundries on the front desk, and the seats in the lobby bar are very much like the texture of a homestay. It seems to be designed with care, but it is not coordinated and lacks texture. Let's talk about the room. What annoys me most is that the hair dryer is unevenly heated and cooled, sometimes cold and sometimes hot. The main shower head is not cleaned regularly and the hotel does not have a central water purification system, which causes the shower to spray everywhere. The exhaust fan should not be installed properly, and it buzzes and vibrates when it is turned on.

The front desk helped to upgrade the room, and the service really made me feel that they are very hardworking. But it does lack some service experience of five-star hotels. I hope the boss can strengthen training and optimize some hardware and software facilities.

I promised to give a good review, 5 points for service, and 4.5 for other things. The opinions are posted in the comments.

The interior decoration is quite satisfactory and relatively intelligent. I don't know if the mattress and pillow are memory foam or latex. They are very comfortable. The air conditioning may not be turned on. It was a bit hot and I didn't sleep well. The window can overlook the Pearl Tower, Shanghai Center and the Global Times, as well as the Huangpu River. Downstairs is the Suzhou River, which intersects with the Huangpu River. It is considered a river view room. The front desk girl Tian Guo's service is very good and enthusiastic. She said she can contact her at any time if there is anything. Praise. Habitual thinking hotel has parking lot, but I made a mistake. There is only public parking. There is a self-paid underground parking lot next to the hotel, which costs 120 yuan a day. It's too cruel.

msg:What should I say, I thought it was pretty good at first. I helped carry my luggage into the room. As soon as I entered the room, I found that it was very close to the building opposite, and it was not directly opposite the Oriental Pearl Tower. I was a little disappointed, but the room was very big and bright, so I was very satisfied. , I never expected a turning point. I went to take a shower and turned on the hot air conditioner. I found that the more I turned it on, the colder it got. I called the front desk and was told that there was only a cold air conditioner! The current weather was 27 yesterday and 17 today. Finally, they gave me a heater! ! ! It made a loud whirring sound when it was turned on at night. I was woken up by the cold at 6 a.m. and then by the heat at 11 a.m. I really took it. I immediately caught a cold and my voice became ho****! ! ! I will never go there again! ! ! Really amazing! ! ! The curtains still let light in! ! !

But the check-in experience was great. The room had everything it needed. What I must praise is the hotel service. Every staff member was very welcoming and came to pick up my luggage as soon as I got off the car. Xiao Lu's service attitude is very good. The little brother at the front desk is very capable in handling business, which is great. As soon as you walk in, you can see the little brother with a smile on his face. The front desk is very warm and thoughtful, and gives comprehensive reminders.

msg:I really went there for the location and scenery. It‚Äôs very convenient to travel by subway and bus. I walked to the Bund and Nanjing Road in a short stroll. What should be complained about is all in everyone's evaluation. The elevator is okay, and you don't have to wait for a long time every time. The hygiene is really intolerable to most people. It's all dusty and not wiped at all. Even though so many people have complained about it, it still doesn't change. The hotel has also made it very unique. Don‚Äôt order breakfast, it‚Äôs super unpalatable. Xiaolongbao is quick-frozen and costs 10 yuan a bag. The small cakes are full of additives and cyclamate. Although prices are low in the Northeast, the breakfasts in ordinary fast hotels worth 200 to 300 yuan are better than here. The two streets in front of downstairs are full of breakfast and local specialty snack shops, so go out and eat. Just consider yourself satisfied with your stay. The friendly service in the lobby before leaving was helpful in storing and carrying luggage. Thank you.

msg:Our family came to Shanghai for a trip. I booked this hotel because I saw a room with a panoramic view of the Bund and the river (recommended room type 05-07 is the best‚ùóÔ∏è)
I share the following very honestly:
I read a lot of negative reviews before coming to stay, and I was still confused. Discovered after actual check-inüëáüèª
advantage:
1Ô∏è‚É£The waiter was really enthusiastic & proactive in helping us carry our luggage, etc.
2Ô∏è‚É£Room 08 does not have a bathtub (my parents lived in a river view room, but the relative view area is larger). It is recommended to have more room 05-07, both of which have pretty nice night views.
3Ô∏è‚É£Automated robot food delivery
4Ô∏è‚É£The aunt who cleans the room put a lot of water for us (just because I said we drink more water), which is very considerate‚ùóÔ∏è
5Ô∏è‚É£Walking around the Bund is really convenient and quiet!
shortcoming:
1Ô∏è‚É£The quality of the hard decoration of this hotel that has been newly opened less than three years needs to be improved (Chinese construction still has some quality issues and cut corners)
2Ô∏è‚É£I didn‚Äôt go to the gym, but I read online that it might be quite small.
3Ô∏è‚É£Breakfast is on the top floor (the breakfast staff are actually quite friendly, but the table setting and decoration are still a bit not up to expectations. I hope the background music can be changed to soft songs during breakfast time, rather than Phoenix CQ-type High song. The food content of breakfast needs to be improved. We still chose to eat out for breakfast the next day.

The following three colleagues provide really good service. I remember their names. Thank youüôè

The bathroom and room should be somewhat separated, otherwise it would be a bit awkward if they are not a couple. I would like to praise Xiao Cheng Xiaojin at the front desk, he is quite enthusiastic. Living with my elderly parents, they helped me change the pre-sale package king bed into a twin bed. Although there is no river view, it is much more convenient.

The bay window of the Huangpu River View King Room is so large that it can sleep a 1.8-meter-tall man, like me.
The breakfast room on the 18th floor offers a la carte and buffet options. It is probably because the breakfast room is relatively small and there are no open stalls, so meals are served to customers after being prepared in other areas. The views of the Huangpu River from several private rooms in the breakfast room are very good. ! give it a like!
Let‚Äôs talk about some shortcomings.
1. When the hotel receives group tourists, the front desk is very disorderly and the price is very low. It can be separated by a separation zone to improve efficiency!
2. When doing CI, the hotel asked guests to sign a statement against telecom fraud. It is estimated that the hotel requires guests to provide a disclaimer against telecom fraud. This is completely unnecessary!
Overall, Ctrip's packages are worth the money. I hope the hotel will pay attention to my two opinions!

msg:This is the first time a Ctrip Black Diamond guest has written a negative review
As a hotel with the same price as Shangri-La and recommended by Ctrip as a five-diamond hotel, the check-in experience is not as good as Home Inn, which is surprising.
When I walked into the lobby, I was forced by the waiter to fill out the anti-fraud consent form. After writing, I could only check in with this consent form. The hall is full of shoddy furniture, and subconsciously, women who have fallen into disgrace are surrounding it. The elevator space is unnervingly cramped. There are all kinds of messy notices posted randomly on the elevator entrance and door. In fact, the most important thing to pay attention to is not to post such messy graffiti. The room furniture is very in harmony with the hall as it is also of inferior quality. Obviously, toiletries, slippers and other consumables are from the same supplier as the express hotels. It should be noted that the express hotels I am comparing are the ones that cost more than 100 yuan. Lying in bed, people in the corridor seem to be talking in your ear, which shows the difference in sound insulation. The carpet in the corridor feels seriously dented when stepped on. When I opened the curtains in the morning, I didn't know which guest's clothes hanger was hanging outside the curtains.
Let‚Äôs talk about breakfast. The restaurant is located on the 18th floor and is called Hanyuan. When I walked out of the elevator, the promotional roll-up was shaky and the sides were rolled up. That night, according to Dianping reviews, Hanyuan Shanghai cuisine ranked first. When ordering, I was told that I could not order food, and the price per person starts at 800 yuan. Later, I noticed that the address of the restaurant was on the 18th floor of the hotel. I told the restaurant waiter that the hotel was too bad and the restaurant would not be good. The waiter told me categorically that we operate independently and have nothing to do with the hotel. The hotel's breakfast is served in Hanyuan. I won‚Äôt go into details about the breakfast standard, please refer to the county‚Äôs three-star rating and imagine for yourself.
Of course, it is not without its advantages. The hotel is very self-aware and knows that its hygiene level cannot meet the five-diamond requirements. Therefore, it has prepared disposable plastic bags and guides guests to put the plastic bags in the bathtub before taking a bath, just like taking a bath in a foot bath shop. Disposable plastic bags for wooden barrels.
To sum up, this is a hotel full of contradictions and interest - it is obviously ranked first in Ctrip's recommendation by relying on ** orders, but it also has the courage to "admit" that its hygiene standards cannot meet the basic requirements.
This is a common sense and very disappointing hotel. Before booking, I knew it was a hotel owned by Ctrip, and I also took into account that Ctrip can use resources to attract traffic and positive reviews. The ratings and stars may not be objective, but considering that in a location like Shanghai and a brand like Ctrip, you have to save face and it won‚Äôt be too bad. . The actual situation is that you should never underestimate the "love for your son" of a father who has a stupid son. He can still cheat to make his stupid son first in the exam.
This is a sincere review of an extremely insincere hotel. I hope it will be useful to you in choosing a hotel.

The service is even better. When checking in, the service staff was super enthusiastic and took the initiative to introduce the facilities and location. I was very happy.
What I was particularly satisfied with was Mr. Lian, who took the initiative to help carry our luggage and direct the taxi. He was particularly touched when he saw us waiting for the bus with our baby. This place must have good reviews, good reviews, good reviews
Next time I come to Shanghai, I will definitely choose Puyan and recommend it to my friends.

I confirmed with the front desk that the reservation would be renewed for another two days, so I checked out of another hotel.

It really affected my mood because I couldn‚Äôt book other hotel rooms that I had canceled before. .
However, the stay experience is still good. It is close to the Suhe Trail and is very suitable for taking a leisurely walk and watching the night view at night.

msg:location
If you go out, there are local shops (restaurants, fruit shops, etc.) 50 meters away, so you can have a quick meal. If you go 50 meters further, there is Nanjing East Road, where you can people-watch and shop. You can see a tributary of the Huangpu River from the hotel, and if you cross the bridge, there is a completely luxurious residential area, and you can easily see foreigners jogging. I really enjoyed taking a leisurely stroll along the well-maintained riverside.
I think it took about 15 minutes to walk to the Bund. It's hard to keep track of time because I see antique buildings and soldiers controlling traffic on the way. Please note that on weekends, the roads near the Bund are completely closed, so we had to walk a long way back to the hotel.

Inside the hotel
As mentioned in the previous review, the lobby is very small and unattractive. It would be better if the dining areas were separated into the 2nd and 3rd floors and there was a cafe on the 1st floor. To be honest, my first impression of the hotel was not very good, as the luggage storage area, very small restaurant, front desk, and waiting area with a few sofas were not well maintained in the narrow lobby. However, the scent coming from the lobby and hallway was so wonderful and fragrant that I kept wondering what it was.
The room was exactly like the picture, and I was satisfied with the curtains being able to open and close automatically, the fact that there was no carpet on the floor, and the large, clean bathtub.

I called several times in advance to confirm, hoping to reserve a good room for my parents. I felt like the front desk was trying to push back, but it didn't work. In addition, after reading the mixed reviews of the hotel online, I still felt a little uneasy. I took a taxi from Hongqiao Airport to the hotel. As soon as I got off the bus, someone helped me with my luggage. I felt very welcoming and heartwarming, and it relieved a lot of worries (the steps at the door are really not friendly to the elderly). After staying for a few days, I feel that the customer service is also very good and friendly to the elderly. Everyone complained about the breakfast, which was indeed not satisfactory, but the staff at the door were enthusiastic and friendly enough, which was good. The view of the Bund from the room is still very beautiful, and the Lujiazui three-piece suit can be seen in full view.

I quickly contacted Ctrip customer service within 15 minutes of placing the order, and the little brother warmly welcomed me and helped coordinate. Unfortunately, after two coordinations with Ctrip customer service, the merchant's attitude was resolved, that is, they did not agree to cancel the subscription. Ctrip customer service insisted on contacting me the next day to give me the final result, but they still disagreed.
I checked in with the mentality of giving it a try. As a result, the hotel's performance in all aspects was almost exactly the same as the previous guests' evaluations. The sanitary conditions are poor, the sheets and towels are old, the room area is not up to standard as described on Ctrip, the angle of the shower head in the bathroom cannot be adjusted, the urine stains around the toilet bowl have not been cleaned, and the smell is unpleasant. Not to mention breakfast, it was either overcooked or just a lot of pre-made dishes, which was unpalatable. Moreover, I felt that the stir-fried vegetables were not washed properly, making them boring to eat. I called the front desk to ask for 4 bottles of water to make tea, but it took more than 20 minutes to get 2 bottles after two reminders. Is this how a hotel at this price actually provides service?
All in all, I hope you will choose carefully in the future and avoid pitfalls. Anyway, I will never stay in this hotel again!

You came here to blow a fan with me in a hotel worth thousands of dollars? Do you really think your hotel windows are big and ventilated? ? ? Before you check in, you dare to say that your home does not have refrigeration and air conditioning. You are not so stingy. Just don't go high-end. It will really stifle you in the room! The robes were on the floor and the sink was dirty. These are the real details. I called after checking out after the price dropped. I didn‚Äôt receive a follow-up call.

Tianguo service was very good and helped me print it out. I like to stay at this hotel every time I go to Shanghai. It is very close to Waibaidu Bridge. You can go to the Waibaidu Bridge for a walk and it's very serviceable. The hotel has steps so you don't have to worry if you have a lot of suitcases. There are people there to help you carry them up and down the stairs.

msg:The hotel is in a good location and is very convenient for traveling. The Jing'an Light Show is just across the river. From the time I checked in to the time I left the hotel, I only saw one woman in the lobby. The others were all male waiters, and even the room cleaners were all men. Moreover, no one came to clean the room when we came back from going out. We hired someone to change the bags of several trash cans at night. When the fruit tray arrives, someone comes to put a new one every day.
The food delivery robot will deliver your order to the door of your room. This robot is really a cute "talkative". I was lucky enough to ride in the elevator with it, and it kept talking to itselfüòÅ
The room is not big, you can see the 3-piece suite and a little bit of Suzhou River
Breakfast is okay, basically everything is available. But the wontons don‚Äôt taste fresh and the wonton skin is a bit thick.

Considering that the Bund was a must-go place, I chose a place that was convenient for travel and had a good environment. When you enter the lobby, it feels a bit small, but the room is very exquisite and pays great attention to details! In addition, you can walk to the Bund, and there are also special restaurants nearby. In short, living here saves a lot of time on the journey~ Amy at the front desk knew that the child‚Äôs birthday was October 1st and specially prepared thoughtful gifts. The child was very happy.

However, if you want five-star service, I personally think it is not achieved. The feeling of the lobby Like a hotel, especially the Reception, the rooms are clean and new when you go up to them. However, there are no toothbrushes, toothpaste, combs, shower caps, etc. in the rooms. If you need them, you have to go to the cleaning cart in the corridor to get them. The cart is left there for a long time. How strange! This needs to be improved!
After pressing Do Not Disturb and no need to clean, the staff still came into the room to clean while we were out! Still needs improvement!

The service of the handsome Northeastern guy at the front desk is five stars, and he was specially selected for me. Satisfactory room... There were also many service faces who didn't pay much attention to me. They helped me to salute because I had a small child, and then to the familiar but unfamiliar handsome man at breakfast. A pair of cloth shoes and a gold chain reminded me of my own father. This is the picture. The face is kind and polite, and a big sister thoughtfully brings breakfast to my baby. It really feels like home... Finally, I hope Puyan Hotel will get better and better...

msg:Environment: The location of the hotel is indeed quite good. It is very close to the subway entrance and only a few steps away. It is not far from the Bund and a three-piece suit can be seen in the room.
Facilities: As a hotel rated 5 diamonds by Ctrip, the lobby environment and drop-off area are obviously completely substandard, even inferior to the All Seasons Hotel.
Vehicles can only be parked on the side of the road, and it is not even the exclusive drop-off area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel. On rainy days, you will be soaked in the rain, and there are extremely high multiple steps. Fortunately, the hotel waiters will help with the luggage, otherwise it would be really difficult. People are angry.
When you step into the lobby, you are greeted by a sense of small-mindedness and rusticity. Only two front desks are a bit too little for this hotel! And the lobby bar is also very rustic, especially the cheap little blackboard.

Facilities: After checking in, after walking behind the screen, there are only two elevators, and the speed is really a bit slow. You can't see which floor you are on and which one you are on. Do you want to play a guessing game?

The entire corridor is narrow and the floor height is not very high. Opening the door, you can actually insert a card to get power... Is it so difficult to install a body sensor? At this price, it is still a newly renovated hotel.
Let‚Äôs talk about the advantages first:
1: The degree of intelligence is high, and the curtain lighting control is clear! The TV can cast the screen and watch iQiyi
2: The view is really good, I especially like the two bay windows in the room.
3: Good sound insulation! Basically no noise was heard
4: The air conditioner is quiet
5: There are enough robots, so you don‚Äôt have to go downstairs to get takeaways yourself.
6: The hotel‚Äôs concierge is very enthusiastic and will take the initiative to say hello and carry luggage.
7: Room service responds quickly
Next, let‚Äôs talk about the specific shortcomings of the room:
1: There is no door to the washing area. This is really inconvenient for business trips or living with elders!
2: No dirty towel basket
3: The lights in the wash area are too dim! There is almost only one light, and the light on this mirror is also very dim
4: The toilet door conflicts with the bathroom floor mat, which often results in the dustproof ***** of the toilet door being taken off.
5: There is no TV cabinet, so there are less places to put things.
6: The bathtub has no texture.
7: It was the first time I discovered that the bathrobe in the hotel was not hanging, but placed in the packaging bag.
8: The paint on the hangers is mottled, which is totally inappropriate for a hotel that has only been open for a few years!
9: The sheets are a little damp, and the quality of the linen is relatively poor.
10: The texture of the bath towel is a bit worse

Then it has been raining for the past few days and there is no wind outside. The sound insulation is very good and I slept well. There are also robots delivering food, so you can indulge in ordering takeout. When we took a taxi to the hotel, we had to take the stairs.

However, the surrounding environment of the hotel is generally old buildings, and the breakfast time is short and there is relatively little food available. The hotel service is not bad!

Service: The front desk service is average, and the concierge service is very good. They help with luggage when getting in and out of the car.
The hotel lobby is not big, and the room space is not very big. The room is not very soundproof. You can hear the sound of doors closing in other rooms in the corridor. The air conditioner is automatic. You can be woken up by the sound of the air conditioner when you sleep at night. The breakfast is average and there are few types. It is a bit like the breakfast in an express hotel. Some varieties need to be ordered separately. The takeaway robot ordered is delivered directly to the door of the room. There are only two elevators, which are a bit slow and small. You need to swipe your card to enter the elevator. There is only one room card, which is a disadvantage. Everyone in the same room has to go out together, otherwise it will be troublesome to get in and out. The overall feeling is average, and I didn't enjoy the five-star service after spending the money of a five-star hotel.

The hotel was newly built in 2021. The environment is simple and low-key. It‚Äôs a good choice for families who want to live in a five-star hotel but don‚Äôt require luxury. It‚Äôs close to the Bund. It‚Äôs a 20-minute walk to the Huangpu River at night. The scenery is very good. You can just see the three-piece apar**ent in Lujiazui on the opposite side; it‚Äôs about 2 minutes away from the subway , Line 10 is close, suitable for the place I want to go, so I recommend staying here. The warm service at the front desk of the hotel and the timely response make staying here feel at ease. It's just that the hotel's restaurant is not managed by the hotel except for breakfast. It is outsourced. It is not as good as the traditional five-star hotel's supporting services. If you have high requirements, don't choose this place.

Since there were no double rooms, we booked 2 single rooms, repeatedly emphasizing that we arranged them on the same floor. At that time, the front desk agreed, and the next day we went outside to play, the front desk called me and said that the room had been changed for me, and asked me to go to the front desk to get the room card when I came back. At this time, I had to reconfirm whether I was on the same floor Floor, the staff who contacted me at the front desk said yes. When I arrived, it was said that it was not on the same floor. At that time, I said why I didn‚Äôt keep the one on the same floor. The front desk said that the one on the same floor was open. I said I wanted to complain to you, so I proposed to transfer to the same floor. The front desk said that there were only 5 people. It's on the first floor. I checked whether the room on the 5th floor was the same as the one I lived in before. The front desk said it was exactly the same, so I agreed. After I went in, I was very disappointed. When I opened the window, I saw a stinky ditch and a bay window sill There was hair all over my face. At this time, the front desk called me and said that I could change to the 2 rooms I stayed in the previous day. I said yes, and the other party said to help me apply to the manager on duty. After 2 minutes, I called again. They told me that I need to make up the price difference of 500 yuan. I disagreed. The front desk came to the room and heard that I did not want to make up the price difference. He immediately said that there was no double room. I asked him to call the manager. He talked to me in a deceitful tone, and even said that their business is very good, there is no room to adjust, you can return if you are not satisfied, I would like to ask, we foreign tourists, where to find a room at that point, as consumers, we have no enjoyment For my own legal rights, before I checked out today, I called the front desk and told us to send 3 bottles of water to our room, but I never delivered them. When I checked out at the front desk, I asked if the hotel would not provide water after I checked out , The front desk just said one sentence, I forgot, I was really speechless. When issuing the invoice, the front desk staff took my mobile phone and took a picture, and then issued the wrong title of my invoice. Let me ask, the hotel works Has the staff been trained? It was a really bad experience. We can accept a higher room rate. If God told me that I could make up the difference the next day if I had a double room, I would also accept it. But, no, this hotel is not worth recommending.

The restaurant on the 18th floor of the hotel is a glass window added to the roof of the top floor. The glass window is next to the sewer ventilation pipe from the first floor to the top. It is a bit disgusting to eat.

1. The location of the hotel is very good, close to the Bund, pedestrian street, to meet the needs
2. The night view is very beautiful, you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower
3. The toiletries smell very good, and there are disposable bathtub covers for bathing

Let's talk about the shortcomings
1. The rooms and hotel facilities are generally old and cost-effective
2. It is said to be a hotel, but in fact many of them are outsourced. The restaurants are not operated by the hotel, and the meals cannot be described. What impresses me the most is that there is a small water bar in the lobby, and guests waiting for the bus can't sit down for a while.
3. The lobby is very small and not grand enough. My first impression was that I went wrong. Which office building should this be?
4. The booking system and prices were confusing. I added more than 1,000 yuan to the store to upgrade to a room with a river view. Later, I found that other platforms booked at a similar price to my original room type.

Opposite the room is the landmark building: the Oriental Pearl Tower and a three-piece suit. Sitting on the bay window at night, you can have a panoramic view of the night view. It's so beautiful!
The hotel environment is good, the facilities are superb, and there is a small robot to serve you when ordering food. After playing tired, take a bath in the big bathtub at night, not to mention how refreshing you areüòç. The hotel service is super good, all the waiters will greet you politely and warmly when they meet you, it really feels like home!
If I have the opportunity to go to Shanghai again, I will choose this place again. I strongly recommend itü•∞

msg:Say it one by one, every one of it is true

Hygiene: Check out the men's restroom in the lobby in the evening. To be honest, it's really not very usable.

Environment: The overall environment is clean, but since the view of the Bund is the selling point, the outer glass has not been cleaned for a long time.
Service: After checking in, I came in after 12 o'clock at night. The room card I was given could not open the room door. I tried many times in succession. I suspected that I had made the wrong call, and I was afraid that someone else's room might disturb others. I made sure that I had read it correctly many times. I called the front desk and waited at the elevator entrance with my luggage. The room door that the attendant brought with me still couldn't open the room door. Finally, The door to the room was opened using the master card. When he unlocked the door, I said a few words, hoping for an explanation, but the waiter didn't apologize or explain at all. When I went down the next day, the front desk told me that the lock of the room was broken. Why did they give me a room with a broken lock? Didn't they report it in advance?

I told the front desk to fix the lock, and when I came back in the evening I asked the front desk for a new card. The front desk said that if you try this card, you're not sure if it's fixed. If it's not fixed, you're going to ask me to come down again. Fortunately, it was repaired in the end, but I can only say that the check-in experience was extremely poor because of this lock! Never encountered it before!

In addition, when cleaning up the room, I threw away the very conspicuous contact lens case on the sink that was placed with the cosmetics. If I hadn't brought an extra one, I wouldn't have known where to put the contact lenses that night. I had never encountered this in so many hotels.

Facilities: Let‚Äôs not talk about the service. There are only two elevators which are very slow. The highlight is that there are 4 robots that deliver food upstairs.

In addition, the room was arranged on the 10th floor when we checked in. The scenery is good and you can see the night view.
The breakfast is rich, and the children are very satisfied.

[Scenery] The view is great, you can watch the night view of the Pujiang River while sleeping on the bed at night, Wuhu is pleasant!
[Bathroom] It is very large, and the toilet is not crowded when three people are in the same toilet. The hotel has a disposable bath bag, and I also brought a bath bag and a bath ball üòÇ But bathing is a bit boring, and there is no small TV to watch~ The mirror as big as the toilet thought it was a smart mirror, but it was just a light belt The ordinary mirror üòÇThe shower room is also very large and comfortable~
[Soundproofing] There should be people in the rooms around me, so I don't feel noisy at night. The sound insulation of the windows is also very goodüëç
[Bed] A lot of hotel mattresses have a common problem. They get sunken after a long time of use, but Pu Yan doesn't. It's so friendly to people with bad waist like me. The pillows are also very comfortable. I slept for two nights with super quality sleep! (‚ûïAfternoon nap hehe)
„ÄêMinibar„ÄëFree of charge every day, no worries about drinking water ~ Welcome fruit was given for two days in a row ~
A suggestion, room slippers, the soles can be made thicker, after all, the room is full of floors, and the soles are too thin to walk, hh is a bit tired.
Then I don‚Äôt know how to live in a suite for 4 people, why only 2 breakfasts are included, fine, maybe I know I have to go to work in the morning and it‚Äôs too late~
On the last day, my mother took my grandma to check out. Thanks to Director Zhou Xikang in the lobby, who has been helping them with their luggage~Ôøº
The overall experience of the two days is very satisfactory, and I may come to live again in the future~

The scenery outside the window of the room is Suzhou Creek + night view of the Bund üåÉ, very beautiful. In the morning, walk along the Suzhou Creek Walk all the way to the Bund, and you can walk past many classic buildings along the way.

The overall hotel has a dark style, the rooms are large and clean, the facilities are new, and the beds are also very clean. The toilet is smart, the water pressure in the bathroom is great, and there are folding shelves in the bathroom to hang towels, which is really thoughtful. If you order takeout, it will be delivered to your door by a robot, which is also great. Overall, the hotel is very new and the service is good. The only drawback is that the hotel lobby is a little noisy. Apart from this, there is nothing wrong with it.

It's very hot at night. It's getting warmer these days. The room is very cramped.
Just open the window
I opened the window and it was noisy. I couldn't sleep well.
The location is excellent and convenient
But for 1000+ a night, the price/performance ratio is not high.
Check-in lobby staff was cold

The waiter named Xiaojin was very enthusiastic and helped with luggage.

Such an expensive hotel, the service makes me feel very bad. When I checked in, I was told that I could check in at 2 o'clock, but after waiting and waiting, I didn't check in until almost 3 o'clock. After checking out, I had to issue a special ticket, but I was told that my colleague couldn't do it because he was away. You can only let me wait or mail it to me, SF Express collects it. (Why do you want us to pay if you can't issue invoices in time?) The front desk service is so bad. Isn't invoicing a skill that the front desk should have? The breakfast waiter also had a very bad attitude. I didn't hear that I had to swipe the room card and asked again, but I felt that the tone was very bad, and if I ordered three things, I would get two for free. I stayed in three rooms for three consecutive days and the experience was terrible.

If you are not satisfied, you can cancel the check-out, and let the check-out be at ten o'clock in the evening, haha.
I took a step back and negotiated to change the room the next day. The front desk called downstairs and told me to change the room type on the next day in advance. The result was to follow the hotel‚Äôs official account to register as a member and place a new order from the hotel platform. The most important thing is the price It has been raised by nearly double. There is no way to complain about this kind of hotel. The hygiene is not bad. The breakfast is not flattering. Every day is cabbage, cabbage, noodles, wontons and steamed buns. The taste is average.

The river view room in this hotel is very average. You can see the three-piece suite, but it is too far away and not in the right position.
The 12th floor is very close to the road, and the sound of vehicles passing on the road is a bit loud. I wanted to change to a higher floor, but after waiting for a long time, the front desk didn't solve it.
The bath water was already cold around 11 o'clock. Even calling the front desk could not solve the problem. It was still hot when I woke up the next morning. The sensor light under the bedside table kept automatically turning on at night, but the master came and canceled the sensor in the middle of the night.
I turned on the air conditioner, and the air conditioner fan blades kept making a whirring sound all night.
Breakfast content is okay. The staff who carried luggage at the door were very helpful.

msg:The location is good, the facilities and equipment are very new, and the room is very clean. The entrance and lobby don't feel like a five-star hotel, they are relatively modest. There is a step at the entrance. I like the concierge for helping to carry luggage on the steps when checking in and checking out. It‚Äôs just that the staff on duty at the front desk and the security guard in the lobby really give people a bad impression. Their speech is very blunt, and they can even be said to be bossy. Whether it‚Äôs when checking in or when checking out and storing luggage, it makes people feel very uncomfortable. The same You can choose other better brands for the room rate. I hope the hotel will strengthen the training and management of service awareness. After all, the location of the hotel is indeed an advantage

There are very few places to put things in the room with two large beds, and the design is particularly inhumane. The worst thing is that I saw two bugs in the steamer drawer of the breakfast steamed buns. The waiter calmly said that you should take a photo and complain. It seems that they are really used to this kind of scene. We had no choice but to check out early after two days of booking. The adults and children had to move their luggage and change hotels in the morning. Not to mention whether the price is affordable, I'm really sorry for such a location!

It‚Äôs not crowded for one big and one small. The room is quite satisfactory. There are free drinks in the small refrigerator
            There are no toiletries in the room. The front desk did not ask if you need toiletries. After washing at night, I found that the room was not available. Then I called for consultation and needed to go to the room next to the elevator entrance to pick up the toiletries. The door could not be opened, so I had to call again. Ask the waiter to send it off. The most fancy thing is that the balcony is completely gray. The balcony is not part of the room. I guess it hasn‚Äôt been wiped off. The dust is not like this for a day or two
     After checking out, I sat in the lobby and waited for the car. A little brother came and gave us two blind boxes. There was still a pleasant surprise. Within a minute, the little brother started to sell himself and asked me how was the experience of booking a room? I really doubt how the online reviews are so high. I waited for my car to come and I carried my luggage down the stairs. My brother was very enthusiastic about carrying his luggage and behaving in a confusing manner. I started to sell myself and comment on things again, so I just casually replied that I don‚Äôt want to comment. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve encountered such behavior when I live in a hotel. I don‚Äôt understand.

After finding this discount package, the total price for two days and one night plus breakfast was 1399, which was a very affordable price. The hotel is close to the subway station, and it takes less than 10 minutes to walk to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street and the Bund. During our stay, we felt the kindness of the guest room aunt, which made us feel very warm in Shanghai, a strange city. After checking out, we rushed to Hongqiao Airport and suddenly discovered that our ID card was missing. We immediately called the hotel front desk. Xiao Lu also immediately added us on WeChat. The service was very good. Although it was just a false alarm, it left a good impression on us. . This hotel is still our best choice next time we come to the Bund.

During the check-in period, I used the landline in the room to call the main station, but no one answered the call twice, and finally dialed the front desk with my mobile phone.
Because I lived alone + the room anti-lock device was broken, so I asked if I could change the room or fix it. The front desk replied impatiently that all the rooms in the hotel were broken, and it was the same. The tone was really annoying. If there is any special reason why you can't use the anti-lock to explain it well, the service staff of the 5-star hotel don't have the attitude to speak well?

I can still rate the three-star service because the attitude of other staff is quite good. I can only say that it is recommended that the hotel strengthen training.

Do you really want to say that these 4.7 points are obtained by brushing it?
If you can't meet the five-star standard, don't label it with five stars to guide consumers. Have you ever seen any five-star hotel like yours? Please benchmark all seasons.
The deluxe king bed room is like a high-end version of an express hotel, okay. Two small elevators. The deluxe double room is very, very small. Secondly, it can be said that the service level of the entire hotel cannot keep up at all. From the waiters to the cleaning, it is not at the level of a professional hotel.
Let‚Äôs talk about the breakfast, it‚Äôs so drunk. Which five-star hotel has breakfast like yours? Is there anything to eat?
Please call 12315 to check yourself.
Apart from the convenient location, there is nothing convenient about it. On the night of One Thousand and Eighty-One, are all the customers being treated as grievances? Is the version wrong or the goods good?

msg:1. This hotel is strongly not recommended. Highly not recommended.
2. The hotel is a five-star hotel. The hotel's breakfast is as shown in the figure. We were traveling with our children, so we wanted to have breakfast at the hotel, but the breakfast at the hotel was really dirty and unhygienic, and the table mats were not changed, and they were used directly by the next guest. For 3 days in a row, I went up to eat at 9 o'clock. The dishes are all leftovers, so I don‚Äôt make up for it. Most of the dishes are spicy, and the juices are poured uniformly. Figure 9 sees the beverage used. I couldn't take it anymore, so I ordered a takeaway breakfast myself the next day. I suspect the hotel restaurant is outsourced to others with no management at all.
2. I am a customer who booked 3 consecutive nights in advance before the Spring Festival. 3900 yuan for 3 nights, but two days after I checked in, it was shown that the price of the hotel was cheaper than what I booked at the time. The hotel replied that the room rate would fluctuate to prevaricate me. At that time, I booked this hotel because I searched near the Bund, so this hotel was displayed. 1,300 yuan per night. This hotel is a little far from the Bund. After staying in it, it looked like this. Once I entered, I felt cheated. Then why didn‚Äôt I choose a five-star hotel with a well-known brand, such as Shangri-La 1400 for one night. What a pity.
3. No place for parent-child activities
4. The advantage that can be mentioned is that the hotel has a robot, and the robot can deliver it to the room when ordering food. The hotel hardware is new, except for the restaurant on the 18th floor. Possibly due to renovations in 2021.
5. Finally, I would like to thank the concierge Xie Hui for helping me with my luggage and giving him a good review.

Pros: It‚Äôs very environmentally friendly. I really like the design of robots delivering express food. The shared washing machine is also very clean and the laundry counter is also very clean and tidy. The guy who helps with luggage is very good. The toilets in the room are all automatic.

Disadvantages: The view is really mediocre. It has nothing to do with the Bund. The drawers in the room can‚Äôt be opened, and you can‚Äôt put your own things. There is no door to the sink and bathtub in the room. It‚Äôs not very friendly if two friends stay

The overall service at the front desk can also be super good or bad. On the day of check-in, the front desk greeted me and I stood in front of me, but when the phone called, I kept chatting and didn‚Äôt even look at me until the colleague next door. Just finish the guest on hand to greet me, she didn't respond after I left, I hope you can strengthen the training

Overall it is recommended

msg:I have stayed at the hotel so many times and I have never given a bad review. I really couldn't help it this time. Our flight was delayed in the evening and we arrived at the hotel at 11pm. Before arriving, the hotel called us and asked us if we were sure to check in. They also called us after we confirmed our check-in. I reserved a room, because I booked two rooms, so I hope it is more convenient to be on the same floor. When I checked in at the hotel front desk, the front desk immediately asked you to buy a 199 yuan coupon to upgrade the room. Then I said that both rooms should be upgraded together, but the front desk said I could only upgrade one room, so I didn't upgrade. Then I found out after giving us the room card that it was not on the same floor and that one room had been upgraded. Only then did I realize that I had been deceived. It didn't mean that we were not assigned to the same floor. I was angry because we went there. We arrived late and the room may be tight, but we booked the room on Ctrip a few days in advance. The most annoying thing is that the front desk didn't know if there was a mission or could they trick us into buying coupons to upgrade the room, and they put themselves The mistake turned into us paying money and getting benefits. The next day I left for work at 8 a.m. and returned to the hotel room at 4 p.m., but it had not been cleaned yet. At 6 p.m., the housekeeper rushed in in a panic and said that we were going to get off work so that you could change your things, and then the floor was not mopped or swept. He left without making the bed.

msg:I really can't understand how there is such a bad hotel. When I booked, it said it had a view of the Suzhou River. As a result, the view in the room was as shown in the picture, and there was no bay window. The only piece of Suzhou River was blocked by a wall at the corner. I called the front desk and he said that the family rooms are all on the fifth floor, so there is nothing he can do. Oh, the family room is for the people in the opposite building to take a bath and cook.
Then after twelve o'clock, when I was asleep, the air conditioner suddenly started leaking, as if it was raining, and the master came to fix it for half an hour. Auntie came to wipe the floor again and didn't sleep until one o'clock.
The next day, I asked for the hotel check-out fee through Ctrip, and the direct feedback said that water leakage from the air conditioner is normal and non-refundable. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve lived in a hotel for more than ten years and I know that water leakage from the air conditioner is a normal phenomenon. Then tell me what is not a normal phenomenon. Sadako crawling out of the TV is an abnormal phenomenon, right?

Facilities: The facilities are relatively complete and clean. But the shampoo is too bad, the whole hair is frizzy after washing.
Parking: Parking is really incomprehensible. The hotel is relatively good, but there is a fee for parking. It is really speechless. After parking for a day, I charged 80 for parking. This is really a bad review‚Äº Ô∏è

The price of 1491 is really not cheap. Even the Bund view, I think this view can only be regarded as a side view of the river. Forget it, the room is really pitifully small, and the room at this price is really about the same size as the Home Inn room next door.
In addition, the front desk of this hotel cannot be called. I wanted a toothbrush and called for a long time, but no one answered, so I went down to get it myself. The next morning, no one answered the call. I really don't know what the meaning of this call is.
The breakfast in the back is really at the level of a budget hotel, with no more than ten dishes. With a price of 1491, I really almost thought that I was scammed, I was wrong, I should download the anti-fraud app.
However, the welcome staff of the hotel are still very warm and responsible, one of the few bright spots. In short, if you want a five-star level, this is definitely not an ideal choice. The Bund is convenient and recommends Quanji and Home Inns next to it.

What's so strange is that I was able to give the wrong room card twice. When I checked in at the front desk, I gave the wrong room type card. After changing the room, I gave the wrong card and couldn't get in. The phone next to the elevator is fake and I can't get through the phone at the front desk. It's so speechless...

msg:I came to Shanghai on business and stayed in such a hotel for thousands of dollars, I was really very, very annoyed and had nothing to say! I advise everyone to choose well during the epidemic, don't delay things, and don't be quarantined when you go home

1 There is a problem with the air conditioner in the whole hotel. It can't be cooled on such a hot day. I called the front desk, and I was very prepared to say that it would be cool if you opened the window. Isn't it ridiculous. It seems that this problem is not a one-day problem of the air conditioner, but a long-term problem of the hotel that has not been repaired. Let me open the window. I live in a thousand yuan hotel and let me open the window without air conditioning. The opposite is still a residential area. Am I naked to show the opposite community?

2 Through communication, the little girl at the front desk said that you can send an electric fan. It seems that the air conditioner is broken. The real city hotel has long been aware of the fact, but did not mention it when checking in! Isn't this deliberately tricking our customers?

3 The size of the fan sent is as shown in the picture, which is about the same size as the remote control of a TV series. ?

4 The temperature difference between day and night is large, so I didn't sleep well all night and couldn't close the windows. It was twenty degrees during the day, and only a few degrees at night. When I woke up the next day, I started taking medicine. I am going to hang water today. I advise everyone, during the epidemic, stay in a good hotel, do not cause unnecessary illness and fever, and as a result, work and travel are forced to be quarantined

The parking lot is 5,000 yuan, and the front desk service is unhelpful for my large and small bags. It is better to live in Lang Ting and the like. By the way, it was said that there was a parking lot, but I was parked for 11 hours and charged me 80. Does this mean that the hotel has a parking lot?

6 The service of the little girl at the front desk can also be warm, and the others are indifferent.

Before I went to see the reviews, they said that the breakfast was not good. The field trip this morning did not match the overall level of the hotel. The lights were dim, and there were a few tables, mostly Chinese food. It would be perfect if the breakfast could be improved! After all, the location of the hotel is very advantageous!

msg:It's outrageous. I will never come back. But I will also objectively talk about the situation of this first bad review in nearly 10 years.

Outrageous shortcomings:
1. First of all, the hotel gate, after two circles, I found that there were only two flights of stairs. I am a photographer, and my suitcase is extremely heavy. I went in and called the receptionist to help me move it. I was so unhappy. As a result, I was asked to fill out a bunch of forms, and the attitude was very bad.
2. When I arrived at the front desk, I didn't mention how messy the hall was, how many small things there were, and how messy. The front desk was also okay. I was convinced by the pretentiousness of playing songs and shaking my head. I was given a room card, but I didn't give it to me when I asked for another one. I was told to come back tomorrow.
3. I went into the room and called the front desk, but they never answered. Ctrip also didn't answer. They answered depending on their mood. My throat was dry, and it was difficult to ask for a few more bottles of water.
4. When I came back from business talks at night, the receptionist was much more arrogant than the one at the epidemic prevention station. There was no courtesy at all. You, please fix this for me, show me that, this, this, you, **, really **, really, I am convinced.

I really won‚Äôt mention the rest of the facilities. Forget it, it‚Äôs all in the past. The seller‚Äôs show and the buyer‚Äôs show, really, **

There are also good aspects.
1. There is breakfast on the top floor. I have stayed in many five-star hotels, but I have never seen such a small one. Don‚Äôt mention hot noodles, wontons, and freshly made things. It feels like there are few at home, and there is no toaster. What is there?
But to be honest, there are few things, and the taste is OK, which is an advantage
2. The room I booked is expensive, 1500, and it has a small courtyard. The small courtyard is OK, the lights are a bit scary, but it is really an advantage

No, I haven't written a bad review in more than ten years, your place is really **, really, I have never seen it, I am shocked, the pretentious front desk staff who shakes their heads, the front desk staff who doesn't answer the phone, the ** receptionist, the service that is nothing, your price is really **, I wish you a prosperous business!!!

msg:The review came half a month late. Every time I check into a hotel, I always read the bad reviews of the hotel. When I first looked at this hotel, I was a little worried about the cleanliness of the rooms. The appearance of the hotel does not look like a five-star hotel. , but overall for me, the CP value is high. When the car arrived at the door, a gentleman named Zhou Xikang took the initiative to help me with my luggage. I have seen him in the Ctrip review, so I recognized him.

Due to the epidemic during the stay, the hotel's security management is still very good, and everything should be done well. I stayed in room 1605 at the beginning. The room was more beautiful and clean than I thought when I entered the room. I am very, very satisfied with the view of this room. The window is suitable for taking pictures on the Internet. Even if it was hot, my husband and I slept all night and couldn't sleep well at all. The next morning, I couldn't stand the heat. I called the front desk, and a manager, Miss Carrie, came to help us and helped us get upgraded to the Bund View Junior Suite. , in 1001, the room is doubled in size and the air conditioner is cool. Miss Carrie also gave us a small gift, but to be honest, I still prefer 1605, the scenery is really beautiful, I hope the air conditioner will be repaired soon, don't waste this room house.

In terms of take-out, I like hotels that have robots to help deliver take-out, so we can just lie down and wait to eat.

On the whole, I will choose this place next time I come. The price is not expensive, it is clean, the scenery is beautiful, the takeaway does not need to be picked up by myself, and the location is convenient. I hope it can continue to be optimized.

The hotel also let me check in and immediately do the nucleic acid. I really want to complain about the uncle in the parking lot, or he will not let me in. Be sure to wait for results within 48 hours before sending in. As a result, the parking lot was nowhere to be found.

Hygiene: very good, the place visible to the naked eye is very clean, the auntie who cleans the room is very enthusiastic ‚ù§Ô∏è

Environment: The hotel room is automatically covered, the ink painting style is very comfortable, the main lake and river rooms, you can really see hahahaha

Service: The service staff from entering the door to checking in are very polite and polite, but I have to mention it as a five-star wine
Breakfast is really not good ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå, the breakfast time is 7.00-10.00, and it arrives at 9.30. First of all, there are not many varieties and the taste is average. It may be because the speed of cleaning up the table and plates is very slow, waiting there. It took a while to get something on the plate, and the food was uncontrollable! I took a piece of bread and I don't know what is the gray mold and mildew on it. After feedback to the service staff, they told me that it was the sesame that the chef accidentally got on it (I feel like you are fooling me üçâ)

Generally speaking, the general environment is still very good, but there are many small problems in the details. The scenery outside the window may be her plus point. If not, it feels a little far from the five-star.

I saw that there is a parking lot downstairs of the hotel. It is very convenient to secretly rejoice. Just in the past day, I was slapped hard by reality, and I first told that the parking lot belongs to the property management. The parking fee is 80 yuan a day, then we have to stay for two nights, which is 160, okay... You said that the urban area is very expensive, and the fee is barely reasonable, but after driving in, you find that this can be considered a parking lot? The garbage dump is also cleaner than here... I don't say anything, the picture above, and finally complained about the hotel management. It is clear that the package includes good night milk tea and welcome fruit. Although we don't eat it, we don't give it at all. It's very popular, just because it's a purchased package, think we don't deserve it? On the second night, I went to the front desk to ask for it, and said that this is only available on the first day... That's right! Of course, I know that there is only one offer, so do you offer it? It was an extremely speechless experience. After checking out, we found that we forgot to take our umbrella. Call the hotel to help us with express delivery. We will take care of the freight ourselves. I'm so grateful that we must give a good review. I just want to say, good service, even if you don't make such a request, others will be willing to affirm it, but for your management model, I can only express disappoin**ent.

It is still very close to the Pudong business district and the Huangpu District business district. Taxi is the starting price, and it is also very close to go downstairs at night for a walk. The overall feeling of staying here is ok. The deluxe double bed room I booked was directly upgraded to the river view room at the front desk, which is very nice. The sanitation of the room is pretty good, but it can be done better in terms of sound insulation. It may be because of the river view room that the traffic outside is slightly louder. Others are basically done well, looking forward to the next stay.

When I mentioned how a five-star hotel still provides such service, the front desk of the hotel even said, "We are a four-star hotel, and it is not allowed on Ctrip." Shock. The staff didn't speak a word of English, not even the English of the room number. The hotel room card was swiped twice and it failed. There are few types of breakfast, the so-called western food only has a few slices of cold bread in one corner.

The reason why I like this hotel is that it is very new and the facilities are very good; the second is that it has an invincible night view. Of course, the location is also unique.
The standard room we originally booked, after learning that we wanted to see the river view, Manager Yu specially upgraded us to the river view room, which saved 400 yuan directly!
So, this is a very satisfying stay experience. If there is a recommendation, it is to have an emergency medical kit, especially a thermometer.

Secondly, after staying in so many hotels, the garage is the smallest and dirtiest. That panorama image represents the size of the entire garage. In addition, this is the only hotel I have stayed in, and parking is charged. 80 a night, yes, you heard that right, 80 a night. Of course it's not a problem, who made us book it, and it's not a garage, is it? The most disgusting thing is that the hotel started to be renovated at nine in the morning! ! ! ! ! ! Nine o'clock, nine o'clock in the morning! ! ! ! Excuse me? What is the hotel used for? If you don't know, let me popularize it for you, the hotel is a place to rest for the majority of customers and consumers. You advertise yourself as a high-end hotel, but your management level is so low? I stayed on the 16th floor. The elevator did not show that there was a 17th floor, which is the top floor, and the 18th floor was decorated. Excuse me, your hotel manager, you are decorating the 18th floor, at least the lower three or four floors cannot be used for guests, do you not understand this reason? In the early morning, the electric drill began to "wake up service", it was really drunk! And even if you don't understand this truth, then it's not suitable for you to decorate in the two days of 2.14-2.15! Valentine's Day and Lantern Festival, you also let people have a happy festival! ? ? ? ? ? Very dissatisfied with this stay, very unpleasant! ! ! ! ! Call the front desk and get the answer: we let them renovate at 12 noon, and give your room a delay to check out at 6 pm! Hahahaha, are you saying it's funny? Just let me listen to their electric drill from twelve o'clock at noon until their renovation workers get off work and check out, does that mean? ? ? ? ? Of course, there is one thing to say, their decorators are still very responsible, starting work on time at 12 noon! ! !

msg:Excellent! This river view is so cool to take pictures.
The service attitude is also very good. Xiao Zhou, the service at the door, is very enthusiastic to help us carry our luggage as soon as we arrive. Because it was my birthday when we checked in, anthony also upgraded us to the top-floor river view room for free. In a good mood.
It can be seen that this hotel is very new and the location is also great. There is a street downstairs for breakfast, and two more steps are Nanjing East Road Pedestrian Street. For those who are not good, there are also down-to-earth Shanghai breakfast stalls for you to choose.

The only regret is...the room's exterior window glass is dirty...photograph minus points

will come next time

The room is quite large, but the superior twin room does not have a bathtub, and the location of the desk in the room is not reasonable. It is recommended to rearrange it. The TV is very big, but the network is unstable. Watching the TV always freezes. After applying for a repair once, it starts to freeze again after half an hour. The bath water was hot and cold, and the amount of water was not small.

The floor was full of dust and garbage. There were fleas on the bed, and we slept until it was itchy all over our face, allergies, redness, swelling, rashes, and red spots on our legs. The next day, the front desk staff came over and saw that the room was dirty and filthy, and this hotel can be said to have no sound insulation at all! I can hear people walking by the door, let alone talk. People who come to this hotel are really cautious.

msg:I saw this hotel when I went to the Bund last week. The exterior looks quite retro. I checked it out and found out that it was Ctrip's own hotel, so it could not be found on other third-party platforms.
It was already past 8 pm when I arrived at the hotel. I asked Anton at the front desk if he could help me upgrade. He told me that there was only a king-size bed in the upgraded room type and I needed to find Ctrip to change the order first. He taught me the operation very patiently throughout the process and finally gave me a delicate suite, so I was in a good mood from the beginning of my stay. When I checked out, I was not a member of Licheng, but I still extended it to 2 o'clock. When I checked out, it was 2:30, and the front desk lady didn't say anything, which was quite humane.
The whole hotel is different from the exterior. The interior is very new, with gray and orange colors, very youthful. There is no meal provided, but the little robot will deliver the takeaway upstairs, which is much more comfortable than going downstairs to get it yourself. The full-length mirror with white light in Figure 1 is very friendly to girls' makeup. I stay in hotels frequently, but the bathroom lighting in the hotels I encountered during this period has problems, so I have to go to the terrace to put on makeup in the middle of winter, but this full-length mirror of Pu Yan makes up for the lack of bathroom lighting.
If I have to say the disadvantages, the bed is super big but a little soft for me, and the second point is that the windows need to be cleaned.
Geographically, it is very close to Nanjing East Road. If you have friends visiting Shanghai, the price-performance ratio is still very high.

msg:There are serious problems with the hotel's hygiene! ! There are even leftover condoms! ! ! Pillows with blood stains! ! ! There is no limit to shirking responsibility. I will never go there again in my life! ! ! 

Regarding this incident, I would like to express the following views

1. If the hotel thinks that we are deliberately blackmailing, you can call the police. Now we all have real-name authentication. I have settled in Shanghai for a long time and am always available

2. The shower room and bed sheets and pillowcases are areas that must be cleaned every day. Such obvious garbage and stains have not been cleaned. Can this indirectly prove that there are serious problems with the hotel's hygiene and cleaning? Is there even cleaning? I remain skeptical, otherwise how to explain the blood stains on the pillow and the condoms in the shower room?

3. Is the training process of hotel service staff standardized? Are they qualified before taking up their posts?

First of all, I declare that I am not a tourist. The incident started when I agreed with my bestie to play in the Bund. It was a bit far from home, so I booked this hotel. I checked in at 5pm on September 30th, and stayed in the hotel with my bestie until 11:30pm, then left the hotel to play, and returned to the hotel to rest at 3am on October 1st. During this period, no men entered the room, and no one of the opposite sex entered the room. When I came back to take a shower at 3am, I found that there was a condom at the drain of the shower room! ! ! And it can be seen that it has been used! ! ! 

I took a photo immediately to keep evidence, and also contacted the hotel customer service. A male waiter came up to clean the condom, but did not change us to a clean room. He just said that the room manager would come to deal with it at 11am. We continued to sleep in this room because it was already very late, almost 4am, and the hotel waiter had a good attitude to admit his mistake, and did not ask for a change of room. At this time, we found blood stains on the pillowcase! ! Even so, we endured it, after all, there were some problems with the public environment. 
Who knew that our kind treatment would be followed by the subsequent brazen ** unlimited shirking of responsibility! ! 

Because it was the first time we encountered such a thing, we were afraid of being treated unfairly, so we asked my boyfriend to come to the hotel to find us at around 8:30 in the morning to help us deal with it. At 11 o'clock in the morning, a young man who claimed to be a room manager came to negotiate with us (but we saw him on the first floor helping guests check in and issue invoices)

The room manager's words were quite **, and the conversation was recorded throughout. After communicating with him, what he conveyed to us was: "It may not be the hotel's fault. The manager will check the room again after cleaning, but they can refund 30% of the room fee first to see how we react. If we are tough, then a full refund is also possible."

From the mouth of this room manager, there was no sense of a hotel's attitude of sincerely admitting mistakes when there were serious problems with hygiene, nor was there any behavior of handling this matter properly. Just because we girls might be easy to talk to, he sent a front desk check-in waiter to test how much so-called compensation we wanted? ? Although the room fee was fully refunded in the end, the hotel's bad environment and bad service will not be forgiven, and will never stay there! !

It is inconvenient to go up and down if you carry heavy luggage. The staff should be trained to take the initiative to help with the luggage. The check-in went well, and I was upgraded to a small suite. I can see the Suzhou River. The room facilities are okay. The bathroom is large. I like it very much. The Cantonese cuisine on the 18th floor is especially recommended. The dishes taste really good. You can watch while eating Jing, but it‚Äôs a bit expensive, about 500 per capita. I didn‚Äôt order the soup for the three of us, and it‚Äôs more than 300 per capita, which is pretty good.

The road is only a few minutes away. Daimaru Depar**ent Store can be seen in the room. The only downside may be the washing machine room. There is no way to wash during peak hours, and there are still people jumping in the queue when the clothes in the line are placed in the basket above the washing machine. This may be the only flaw.

I said that I could see the landscape, but it was actually a small river with yellow and dirty water. No one came in to help with luggage, and the security felt that I was a transparent person. The lobby is very dark, and check-in didn't say anything hastily. I found the elevator and went upstairs, and the room was even darker. Hygiene can only be described in a word. The outside of the kettle seems to have not been wiped for a long time, and the tea cup has tea stains. The bathroom mirrors are all water stains, and there are things left by the last guest on the countertops. The most weird thing is that even if you find hair in the bathroom, there is even hair on the plate where the teacup is placed! I really don‚Äôt know how the sanitation is cleaned, so just take out such a room for the guests? ! Too rubbish!

Compared with other hotels, Puyan‚Äôs price-performance ratio is really nothing to say, the service is warm and considerate, the location is good, and the price is excellent, which is perfect! ! ! If you go on a business trip again, the Bund Puyan will be your first choice, and I will also recommend it to my friends!

msg:This hotel really has no advantages except that the newly opened facilities this year are relatively new. The experience is really bad. Let me talk about the parking space first. We stayed for two nights and booked two rooms. The hotel does not even have its own parking lot. I parked in the parking lot next door. After playing for a day, I had to wait for a parking space. I waited almost an hour to get a parking space on both nights. I was really tired. There was no parking space at the hotel. I was talking about the concierge at the hotel entrance. We were two. A girl with a large suitcase arrived at the door and found that there was not even a concierge reception at the door. The key was to go up a long flight of stairs and there was no way to drag luggage. It really had to be carried by human hands. It was raining and I was really embarrassed. When we sat down for breakfast the next day, the waiter was clearing the table and asked if we could sit down. When we got it, we sat down and prepared to eat. We saw that there were dining mats on other tables. And the knife and fork, tell the waiter to help us prepare it, because the knife and fork are not placed at the tableware collection, if the waiter does not put the knife and fork on the table, we can not find the position of the knife and fork, the result is the meal has reached the fruit after the meal We didn‚Äôt get the time, we could only eat the fruit with chopsticks, and then asked the waiter to help us pick up the fork. After a response, the descendants disappeared. We didn‚Äôt bring the tableware, so we could only ask another waiter for the tableware. , The result is the result! ! ! ! The waiter saw that we were dining with two of us, but only took a fork and was speechless. He returned to the room and found that there was a water leak. Calling the front desk would never be able to get through. Obviously, the phone was connected, but there was no one. After answering the phone, when I checked out on the last day, I was wearing a suit at the front desk. The person who seemed to be in charge reacted to the feelings and situation of staying in the past few days, but after listening to them, there was no reaction at all, and I gave me a smile. I invoiced the person next door directly, okay, I‚Äôve been talking too much. On the day of check-out, there was still a heavy rain. We took our luggage and stared at the rainstorm and went to the parking lot next door to pick up the car, because the luggage was heavy and the suitcase was large. There is no way to open the umbrella when you are on the stairs, and the whole body will be wet for a while. The above descriptions are facts. Please be cautious when you check in! ! ! !

msg:It was a very, very good stay. I was a little nervous before I made the choice. I read the reviews and some people said bad things. Now it seems that the reviews are malicious. Considering the excellent location and very close to my office, I decided to choose this hotel! I have experienced it myself! Sure enough, my choice was correct!
1. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic and proactive, especially the young man serving in the lobby. His smile is contagious, he is very kind, and his service is attentive.
2. Not to mention the geographical location, Nanjing East Road, the Bund, the Oriental Pearl Tower, Yu Garden, and Shanghai's landmark buildings are all nearby, making it super convenient for eating, shopping and shopping.
3. The decoration style of the hotel gives people a very grand and calm feeling! The executive floor is quiet and spacious, suitable for meeting with friends! Drink coffee and chat
4. The breakfast variety is also relatively rich and the taste is good.
5. Since it is a newly opened hotel, the facilities and equipment in the room are relatively good, and the room is clean and tidy, and very comfortable!
(I accidentally discovered several ** Internet celebrity stores near the hotel)
Very worth recommending to colleagues and friends! I will choose this hotel next time I come to Shanghai! Like, like, like, like [strong][strong]

msg:Never stayed in such a bad hotel. Even Samsung's service is inferior. First of all, the hotel has a taste of decoration. Very unhealthy. Second, there is no breakfast at all. A 150/2 breakfast for a room is a rotten banana, a boiled egg and a croissant. Third, the hotel parking lot is all soil and building materials. There are scaffolding in the lobby and decorators can be seen everywhere. There is no executive floor, no coffee shop. The waiter's service is very unprofessional, and I feel like I was looking for it directly on the road. No training at all. Will never stay in this hotel again! Very disappointed!

msg:When checking in, the front desk said that there is no room, so that the member can upgrade the room type. This is to induce consumption; besides, after checking in, I clearly stated that there is no need to clean, and the hotel will leave everything on the table without my consent for two hours. I took it away, but the paper towels are gone, but I don‚Äôt know how to change them; in the end, the rain is so heavy today, and there is no doorman at the door to pick up and drop off an umbrella and help guests with their luggage. In summary, I hope this hotel is worthy of its name, and don't do the worst service under the banner of 5 stars.
