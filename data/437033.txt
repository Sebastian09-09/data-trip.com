The front desk clerk has a good attitude and the security guard is polite and has a sweet smile! The seafood and delicacies for dinner were just... before I could take a photo, they were all taken away by the guests... The breakfast was very good and rich, so I made up for it! As for spa trea**ents, there are a few swimming pools open. According to my children, only 8 swimming pools are open. There is a children's playground, and the children have a lot of fun! Nearby are the Sleeping Buddha and Kong Sheng Garden in the Forest Park, as well as the crocodile pool to see animals, monkeys, peacocks and other animals. It is worth bringing your children to play!

msg:As soon as I entered the waterfront room, there was a musty smell. After checking in, I called the front desk to arrange for the waiter to deal with it and then went out to the hot spring, but it was not dealt with until I went back at night.
The facilities in the hot spring changing and bathing areas are relatively old. There are not many open hot spring pools, and the facilities are old. The water quality is also relatively poor, especially the large swimming pool below, the water quality is particularly poor.
After returning to the room at night, I found that the bedding on the bed also had a musty smell. I notified the room service to change it. No one dealt with it the first time. It was not until the second call that someone came to change it. I asked to replace the aromatherapy that was already empty in the room, but I was told that it was gone.
Due to the influence of the musty smell, I did not sleep well at night. The source of the musty smell was discovered during the day of the next day. It turned out that there was a large piece of mold on the head of the bed. See the picture (￣～￣)

The children have a lot of fun. The most convenient is that the waterfront room has a direct balcony. It is really fun when it rains. The price-performance ratio is quite high, but the breakfast is a bit poor. The breakfast varieties of star-rated hotels are pitifully few. The point is that you have to walk a long way to the restaurant. The front desk service is also average. The overall evaluation is that the hardware is OK and the software is average. I didn't feel the enthusiasm of the star-rated hotel waiters, haha

msg:The soup house is an old facility, a bit like the ba*****t of an unfinished building. But this is not the most important thing. What is important is that the service attitude is extremely poor and perfunctory. I will explain it in three points below.
1: The order description for the hot spring house includes the waterfall pool. However, I went to the entrance of the waterfall pool and could not swipe the hot spring house's room card. I went to the front desk for help. First, the front desk asked me where I came from. I said the hot spring house. Then he gave me a blank face, I didn't know what he meant, and then he said, find someone to open the door for you. I was confused, why should I find you at the front desk if I can find someone? After dawdling for a long time, I could see that he was very busy, so I found someone to help me deal with it, and the matter was settled.
2. I wanted to go back and take a dip after dinner. Due to the old facilities, the lights in the hot spring pool would not be turned on. I called the front desk, and the front desk said there was nothing they could do. The maintenance guys were off work. I said, you have to solve it for me. Well, then they sent someone over very perfunctorily. As soon as the young man came in, he said, I can't help you, I can only give you a look. I asked you how long you haven't used it here, and he said it's been more than a year. After fiddling with it, the light is there and it's not very dark. It's solved, but the attitude is really uncomfortable.
3. When I got up at 9:30 the next day, I asked someone to stop the water. An aunt came and took a look and said that the water should be drained quickly first. If it was not urgent, she asked me to wait. I said yes, and then went to sleep and go back to the cage. I woke up at 10:30 and found that the water was neither drained nor stored. I was confused again. I had to check out if I asked someone to come, so I had to forget it.
I have never experienced someone being cursed at three times while staying in a hotel. I hope the hotel will make rectifications.

From early in the day until late in the evening, in the park next to me, the old man sang amplified and screamed, which was very annoying. It’s not a relaxing place to stay. Feedback When I called the front desk, the response was very bland and the experience was very poor!

温泉池子很大，水温也夠熱，真是不錯。
服務員很熱情，水療館的美女特別周到。
希望水療館和湯屋大老闆能升級設施，入住時間要靈活，客人早到了，有房就給吧！不會虧錢，開門做生意就是賺口碑，不要太吝嗇。這麼優秀的硬件，趁着大健康醫療的方向，好好改造和升級温泉區設施，大方和捨得點，錢自然會向你飛來，撿都撿不完那種。

二、房間門不是平時我們所住的酒店房門，是玻璃加木塊間隔做的，如果不是門後要掛一塊布來遮擋，那麼一眼就能看到房間裏面。
三、床單破舊，像招待所的設施，衣櫃備用棉被舊的呈黑色。
四、後面泡池、地面滿是落葉，放着的椅子桌子都是灰塵。
五、從大堂進到房間，九曲十八彎，其中有一條走廊光線又不足，黑乎乎的。
六、後來確實忍受不了，晚上九點退房走了。
