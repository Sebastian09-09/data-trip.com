The room was delicates and They keep replenishing water and keep you hydrated.
Many thanks for Charles who communicated and arrange shuttle, share tips here for us before the journey, due to language barrier, we were really concerned about it, the check in service of Linda was very considered. She provided us the activity package and we have been enjoy it for those day. Winni was kind enough to meet our needs. But the facilities was old so it needs lots of maintenance works on it.
Last but not the least. Thank you all for the hospitality service and make our journey feel like home

My husband's swimming slippers were taken away by someone else. The staff in the swimming pool area took the initiative to get my husband's slippers. The details are very good, and the service level is very good at foreign resorts. My husband and I are very satisfied.

msg:A very satisfying stay. The staff in every link, from the concierge, front desk, cleaning to the restaurant, gym, and spa, are very professional and have a good attitude. 
Stayed in the off-season. No experience related to skiing, but the gym is open 24 hours a day. There are two large indoor and outdoor hot spring pools. The 25-meter swimming pool is very good. The management is responsible and friendly. 
Breakfast starts at 6:30, which is convenient for getting up early to go to the West Scenic Area of ‚Äã‚ÄãChangbai Mountain. There are not many varieties but enough. The main dishes made in the open stall are delicious and the products are very good. Overall, the requirements for the Park Hyatt brand can only be given to the standard. The advantage is the orderly management and overall service attitude when there are many people. 
There is a wooden plank road behind the hotel, which is very convenient to go to the resort commercial street and hike up the mountain. 
Stay in the off-season. There are not many activities in the resort, but there is a cable car to see the scenery. Combined with the wooden plank road and the walking path, two or three hours of hiking in the mountains can also kill time. There is a round-trip bus to the West Scenic Area of ‚Äã‚ÄãChangbai Mountain. 
Finally, there are a few small suggestions: 
The breakfast pastry area is not well kept. Each bread needs to be reheated in the oven. 
A set of tables and chairs can be placed on the balcony of the guest room. It is practical in non-winter. I took out the wooden chairs from the house and sat on the balcony every day these two days, and moved them back when I was working. Overall, it was an experience beyond my expectations. I would like to thank all the hotel staff who I met during these two days.

msg:The worst Park Hyatt I have ever stayed at.
The loud humidifier noise on the first night may be an isolated phenomenon. Just replace it on the second day and it will be ok.
The decoration is old-fashioned, the maintenance is difficult to comment on, and the details are embarrassing. There are no USB sockets, the sockets are not tight, the seams in the floor are 50% larger than the gap between my teeth, the cheap art paint walls are dirty, and the small wall-mounted TV is something I haven't seen in a luxury hotel in a long time. , ok your hotel was renovated relatively early and you have your own design concept, I can figure it out too.
In the villa area where we live, we have to brave the cold weather to have breakfast, ski, and bathe in the hot springs. The balcony has no view, which can be said to be no advantage in a resort area.
The boy at the door opened the door for us and looked at my girlfriend up and down without any scruples. Her snow suit looked so good, right?
I love drinking coffee. Picture 6 shows the inner wall of a takeaway coffee cup in the room. This is the main reason why I gave a bad review. It is dirty and unacceptable.
Escape quickly on the third night.
This negative review only reflects what I saw and felt after staying here for two days.

msg:Almost disfigured,
Facilities: The facilities are really bad. The paint on the shower head fell off and blocked your hands. When I took a shower yesterday, I touched my face and my face started to bleed. The toilet couldn't be flushed clean either. 3800 a night is for such a facility. Disappointing!
Hygiene: Hygiene is pretty good
Environment: The environment is quite satisfactory. It is a little far away from the ski resort. If you wear snowshoes, it will be hard. It is recommended to stay at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, which is very close and directly close to the ski resort. It slides right out.
Service: The front desk service attitude is not as good as Guangzhou three-starü§∑üèª‚ôÄÔ∏è. However, the manager in charge of the swimming pool and SAP is pretty good, just him.
Then I discovered that the prices on other platforms are much lower than Ctrip, such as Xiaohongshu. There are no takeaways here. It‚Äôs inconvenient to eat some fruit. I called the front desk to ask if they could deliver a piece of fruit. The front desk‚Äôs attitude was very contemptuous and felt that we were greedy for this fruit.

If you are tired of eating dinner in the hotel, the hotel will ask about the taste and recommend corresponding restaurants. Luneng Switzerland is really disappointing, so after arriving at the Park Hyatt, I feel that this is the standard that a hotel should have. It is very convenient to go to the ski resort, and the rental of ski equipment can basically be done as soon as you arrive, so there is no need to wait. Overall, I am very satisfied. Next time I go to Changbai Mountain, I will go directly to the Park Hyatt.

msg:I booked one night on Ctrip before departure, and booked four nights with the local agent on the night of check-in, staying in Park Hyatt for a total of six days and five nights. First of all, I contacted Xiao Zhang from the hotel concierge before my trip started. The whole process was very pleasant. From the arrangement of the itinerary to our later questions and needs, no matter what time we called, they were handled and solved in a timely manner, and they were very diligent. The girl at the front desk who checked in on the night of the 18th was warm and thoughtful, and she also took us to choose a room. After learning that I would renew the suite for four days later, the king-size bed room we stayed in that night was also upgraded to a suite. The hotel did not charge any extra fees for the extra bed we were given. The hotel has only one restaurant. Although the dishes are average, the service girl has a very good working attitude. In general, I can feel the enthusiasm and cheerfulness of the people in Northeast China. As a Shandong person, I feel very kind. Although the breakfast, hardware facilities, etc. are not satisfactory, if nothing unexpected happens, I will still give a five-point praise recommendation. However, there was an accident in the middle that made me extremely angry, so I had to give the first bad review of a hotel in my life.

Because I did not book the last four days on Ctrip, but found other agents to book. So on the 19th, which was the second night of my stay, I called the front desk in my room to ask if the agency had paid the room fee for my stay. The person who claimed to be the manager on duty that night, Cohen or Korn, with the employee number *******, (I learned later that he was a male with fair skin and a short stature) replied that I had not found it and had not paid. My immediate reaction was to ask him, since the agency had not paid the room fee, how could the hotel let us continue to stay in the room? The answer I got was that it showed that I had a front desk deposit of 10,000 yuan. If the agency had not paid, the room fee would be deducted from my deposit first. I said that was wrong, because I had already paid the room fee to the agency, and my front desk deposit was to pay for miscellaneous expenses other than meals, service fees, etc. When I checked in, I clearly stated that my deposit had nothing to do with the room fee. My logic was to assume that the information the hotel said was accurate, so my first reaction at the time was that I was deceived by the booking agency. But I still went to the front desk to confirm the accuracy of the information again. The dramatic thing was that after arriving at the front desk, the information given by the manager was completely different from before: it was not that it had not been paid, but that the payment had not been completed, and whether the payment was completed or not, it would not affect our check-out. In addition, my 10,000 deposit is not used for the settlement of the room fee. That is, the information given to me by this manager during the previous call with me was all wrong. In fact, the matter should have ended here. I think it is a very normal thing. At most, it is a little information gap. The wrong information was given to the customer before approval. The staff said: I just made a mistake! Or a little more professional, explain: I am not very clear about the previous situation. After hanging up the phone, I immediately contacted my colleague to understand. I just told you wrong, I am really sorry! That's it. But in my communication at the front desk, the way this staff handled it caught me off guard. From the first sentence, the voice was very high, irritable, excited, and completely out of control, which was completely different from the phone. I don't know whether it was because I went downstairs to the front desk to ask about this behavior that made him feel offended, or whether he was always so strong in front of other colleagues, or always so preemptive in handling customer complaints, or whether he was an inferiority complex personality, self-protection after realizing that he had made a mistake, I don't know. But what I know is that this staff member kept silent about his own problems and didn't listen to what I was saying. Under his extremely unprofessional business level and extremely disrespectful attitude towards customers, he successfully transformed the problems and conflicts between me and the agent into conflicts between me and the hotel.
I have seen people with strong ability but poor attitude, I have also seen people with poor ability but good attitude, but I have never seen people with poor ability and poor attitude. This staff member is not my employee, and I have no obligation to educate and train him, but as a customer, I have the right to express dissatisfaction and anger. I spent more than 30,000 yuan on five nights to take my children out to play, not to meet such a rookie in the workplace, a novice. This level of quality can be a foreman manager, which shows that the hotel has failed to supervise the use of people! In this incident, a leadership position, even a grassroots leader, had such an attitude, which directly led to the customer's inability to complain to other on-site personnel at the time, which is why I gave a bad review here. After this incident, I met this staff member once at the front desk. Without any honorifics, he asked me directly, what's wrong? I met him once in the lobby. He was talking and laughing before calling me, but he immediately turned cold after seeing me. I was really surprised by your hotel brand and the selection of personnel.
If the hotel management can see this comment, here are some suggestions for you
1. The information should be as accurate as possible, and the information verification work should be done before communicating with customers. If it is unclear or there are special circumstances, there is no need to answer immediately, but give the customer a time node and give a reply before the time.
2. Before solving reasonable customer problems, the service industry should never have subjective emotions, listen more and talk less. Even if you have emotions and personality, you will gain the understanding and respect of others only on the basis of your efficient and professional solution of the problem. If you don't do your job well, and you keep emphasizing subjectivity, it will only make people feel very low.
3. All groups or enterprises are a collective. As long as you are in your position, you represent your company and brand rather than an individual. It doesn't mean that I have contacted your colleagues before, and you have no obligation to ignore this matter. You are kind enough to help me by handling it, and I will be grateful to you. When facing customers, there is no Zhang San Li Si. It is your hotel's business. All employees within the scope of ownership and responsibility have the obligation to handle and solve it. This is the most basic professional quality.
4. People have high and low abilities, which can be cultivated, but their character cannot be changed. In the service industry, you cannot eat with a bowl in hand and then curse your mother when you put it down. Whether a person is responsible, whether he has the courage to admit his own problems and mistakes, whether he actively solves problems or shirks responsibility cannot be changed through acquired training. Some people with character defects are not suitable for service work. Although I was very angry, it also increased my knowledge. I will share this experience with my employees and colleagues as a case of failed customer complaint handling and a typical case of ineffective communication. From this point of view, I want to thank the staff member who calls himself ******* and Park Hyatt Hotel.

msg:I am sincere in my evaluation. The service is sorry for the Park Hyatt brand. I have stayed in many Park Hyatt hotels in first-tier cities and the service is very caring. The service at the Changbaishan Park Hyatt was cold from beginning to end and I did not feel enthusiastic. In other aspects, it was okay. Another bad thing is that the igloo is too far away from the ski resort, not as close as the Hyatt. Wearing equipment to the ski resort is already exhausting, let alone having to continue walking back with heavy equipment. The hotel is not a real hot pool. For hot springs, the hotel provides tickets for the real hot springs in the resort, but you need to take a shuttle bus outside the hotel. The real hot springs hotel is the kind where you can bathe in hotels in the entire resort. It doesn't feel very convenient. You need to take a bath in the real hot springs. If you go to Beipo, I recommend Crowne Plaza Beipo.

msg:The hotel is located in the most remote corner of the resort (what they call privacy). Although it has an independent igloo, it is too far from the junior trail and gentleman trail. It is very inconvenient for skiers and snowboarders, who must wear hard clothing. Boots, carrying heavy skis, walking unsteadily for at least 15 minutes. When you go to walk on that road after skiing for a day, and it is still uphill, it is self-evidently tiring, and your feet will get blisters. The key thing is that no one at the hotel told us this, and no one suggested that novice skiers rent ski equipment from other igloos just a step away from the beginner trails. The service was terrible. The facilities in the room are also old, the balcony door handle is broken, and the cover of the door card sensor falls off when touched. All in all, whether it is worth the price of 6,600 is a matter of opinion.

Service: Poor, not up to the mark.
Facilities: old

Your own independent snow house is only available during the day. For night skiing, you need to walk to the Hyatt Snow House by yourself. Beginners are recommended to make an appoin**ent with a coach, otherwise it will be difficult to skate and you will easily get injured. Overall, it is recommended.

The housekeeper Lilian came to me early in the morning and asked me all kinds of attentive questions. The main building was specially arranged according to my wishes. The balcony has a beautiful view and is very close to the Internet celebrity hot springs and cabins. We also helped solve some problems caused by the large number of people during the snow season. The facilities are a bit old and there are no smart toilets yet, but the rest is pretty good. I stayed for 3 days and 2 nights. In fact, there is a cool plank road at the back door to walk to the center of the town for 10 minutes, which is great ~ I will probably come back in the summer.

msg:This time I came to Changbai Mountain mainly to stay at the Park Hyatt, which was already booked in November.

It is indeed the best hotel in Wanda Resort. The design is full of high-end feel. The bathroom is so big, you can take a shower and take a bath, and the double basin design is so smart.

The service requirements can basically be met, except that it was late at night, at 11:30, and the doorbell was pressed twice by mistake, saying that something was delivered...

The breakfast variety is a bit limited, so you can eat whatever you want.

When we came to Wanda Resort, we stayed in the first three hotels, and we still had to stay at the Park Hyatt.

msg:The 55-square-meter one was a bit small. I upgraded to a suite that day, but what was said inside was that it was definitely not a match for more than 7,000 yuan a night. One of the curtains in the bedroom was broken! It couldn't be closed at all, and you could see inside from the outside. The sewerage in the bathroom was very poor, and dirt came up in the washbasin every night. One day, a small bug came up, and small beetles kept appearing in various places. It's quite a distance from anywhere, and it says it has its own igloo. In fact, to go skiing, you still have to walk for five or six minutes holding the skis. It's okay to walk down, but it's really terrible to walk up after skiing. Then I booked an afternoon tea in a wooden house for 980, which included a few small desserts, a bottle of champagne, and the windows above the wooden house were sealed... The waiter also specifically told me not to go up there.
. All in all, it's a very average experience and one of the worst value for money.
The only advantage is that the breakfast is okay.

The restaurant is also very good. I ordered the afternoon tea at the wrong time, but they were able to help adjust it to meet my needs!
Because I had 2 children and needed 2 extra beds, the hotel was able to help quickly and made my stay very comfortable! Come again next time~

msg:Service: I contacted the airport pick-up service number in advance and the other person told us the color of the car and asked us to sit in the parking lot. However, no one contacted us after we got off the plane. We got on the next bus and were told that we were not on the list. People who had to wait in the car for the next flight wasted nearly an hour
Room: The floor heating is great. It‚Äôs too friendly for southerners. It‚Äôs just right to wear short-sleeved clothes indoors. I also like the decoration style. It‚Äôs a pity that I didn‚Äôt wait for a room with a balcony.

Breakfast: delicious! I especially like the cucumber juice and noodles + tomato and egg custard. I got up early to go rafting, came back to have breakfast, and then went skiing happily. Everything was just right.


Environment: I particularly like its hot springs. They are very popular. There are almost no people bathing in them and there is no crowding.

msg:The stay experience is really hard to describe
1: Before checking in, I had to contact the guest to ask if I could pick him up from the airport, so someone could arrange to pick him up instead of contacting the guest to ask.
2: When picking up the airport, I called the driver and asked him if he could help him carry the luggage at the door. The 4 boxes were too heavy. The driver said that he couldn‚Äôt move and get on. I found that the main driver, the co-pilot and a hotel staff couldn‚Äôt take out one of them. Can you help me carry the box?
3: On the first night of my stay, I was woken up at two or three in the morning. A man and a woman were quarreling in the corridor. The woman cried and made a fuss for half an hour. No one paid attention because they lived in a villa area and there was no management staff in the entire villa. Is this reasonable? No one paid attention to the noise. When I woke up the next day and went out, I found that all the vases on the floor had been smashed. There was a pile of dirty things on the floor and no one took care of it? Really speechless
4: The heating in the hotel is too hot. I really didn‚Äôt sleep for more than three or four hours after staying for three nights. I kept waking up because of the heat. I ran to the sofa to sleep. I couldn‚Äôt adjust the temperature of the heating. Even if I turned it off, it was still hot.
5: The conditioner was gone on the first night and was still missing when I used it on the second night. Won‚Äôt the hotel management replenish it? Didn't you check after the previous guest left? Cleaning the room every day and not checking? I had to call customer service again before someone could replenish it. It‚Äôs really outrageous.
6: The minibar is just a few bottles of soda, and the first round of stay is free, and you don‚Äôt have to make up for it in the next few days. It‚Äôs nearly 6,000 per night and you can‚Äôt even give up a few bottles of soda. According to this statement, then I might as well book separately every night?

Tell me what you like:
1: The scenery is really beautiful
2: The breakfast is delicious, with many varieties and delicious taste.
3: The service attitude of the concierge and front desk was very good. The concierge helped me move my luggage throughout the whole process (in the hotel). If the express delivery was missed, it also helped me reissue it.

msg:As a southerner who comes to Changbai Mountain for the first time, I highly recommend the Park Hyatt. After comparing all the hotels on the west slope before booking, I finally chose this one. It exceeded my expectations. The Park Hyatt in Wanda Park is here. The positioning of a group is luxury, while Westin and W Hao are luxury. The difference is that the Park Hyatt is the best in terms of privacy. It feels like a bit of wild luxury. Even if you live in an ordinary room, under a group The K-hyatt next door may be more suitable for ski enthusiasts. The Park Hyatt has ten square meters more apar**ents than the Hyatt, but it depends on whether you like dark or light colors. The Park Hyatt has larger rooms and smaller public areas, and the Hyatt Just the opposite, but the ski house is good, 200 meters closer to the ski resort. Since our flight back is late at night every day, the staff at the front desk of the Park Hyatt this time even delayed our check-out until 3 o'clock. And I also gave a small gift. The breakfast in the hotel is rich and the ingredients are very good. You can try their cheese cheese. It is absolutely yyds. If you want to eat, walk about 600 meters to the Wanda Town Park Hyatt. The food is also very good. We ate a lot I also ordered a bottle of red wine for a price of more than one. I highly recommend it. The mini bar that comes with the room is also very rich. Nestle capsule coffee, various types of tea, ice sparkling water and carbonated drinks are available at any time. Room service provides ice and meal delivery in the room. Comments Please don‚Äôt mind if the writing is unprofessional and a bit messy. I hope it can help you. Finally, I would like to mention that their airport pick-up and drop-off service is great and you can also make an appoin**ent to take photos of your puppyüì∑

Special thanks to winni and fanny at the front desk for their warm reception

The service was also good. We were not able to check in on the day we arrived. We were recommended to go skiing first. At noon, we ordered a Pizza Hut takeaway in the lobby. At almost three o'clock, they called us to inform us that we could check in.
The facilities are not the best, maybe because they are a bit old. The toilet is not smart, and the water pumping condition is not particularly good. I generally don‚Äôt know the brand of the hair dryer, but I really like the smell of the skin care lotion. It smells super good.
Breakfast is a bit more Western style. If you like ham, bacon, oa**eal, and bread, it doesn‚Äôt matter.

I missed many benefits activities because I climbed the west slope. The three big dogs are Pearl. Richard Ruby got up immediately to get off work when he heard that the photoshoot was finished. It is very smart; the hotel's own outdoor swimming pool is also great. It can basically be reserved in the off-season. When checking in, the hotel service was very good, especially to Summer and Jeniffer who helped with late check-out, and to colleagues who helped pick up and drop off at the scenic spot. Thank you and praise!

The bedding in the room is particularly comfortable, and I slept very well after soaking in the hot spring.

The location and environment of the hotel are very good, and the Northeast cuisine in the restaurant is really delicious. The service staff has the unique enthusiasm and sense of family in Northeast China. Ms. Envy at the front desk and a round-faced brother at the concierge were particularly helpful, and everything was arranged properly. This is a lot more points than Park Hyatt in the south.

A place worth visiting all year round.

Booked the hotel and made an appoin**ent for pick-up
The driver is waiting at the airport in advance
Arrive at the hotel at noon, check in without queuing
Staggered the peak season of summer, there are not many guests recently
The little sister at the front desk upgraded the room
At the same time, I am very patient to register all the rights and interests.
It also details the hotel's facilities and opening hours
The little brother in the concierge is also actively helping with luggage
I usually say hello when I go in and out.
The room is cleaned every day
Calling room service is also the first response
Stayed for three nights, no need to queue for breakfast every day
Although there are not many choices, some dishes are worth recommending
The Swiss Frozen Oa**eal is delicious! !
Although the location of Park Hyatt is not in the center of the resort
But it's rarely very quiet
It is also very convenient to go out the back door and walk along the wooden plank road
The air on the mountain is very fresh
Worthy of being No.1 in Wanda Resort
Looking forward to next winter to ski

msg:Come to Changbai Mountain to escape the heat in summer. Park Hyatt Hotel is the most high-end brand in Changbai Mountain, and the experience after checking in is also very good. Except that the decoration of the room is relatively old, so when the floor is stepped on, the machine will ring. This affects the experience too much, and it somewhat damages the brand image. The group should report and apply for renovation. There are many kinds of breakfast in the hotel, and the variety changes every day, which is very good. The dining environment is also very good, the waiters are very alert, and the dishes are collected quickly, but the restaurant coffee does not have decaf coffee. It is recommended to increase decaf coffee beans to satisfy different groups of people. But the toiletries le labo was amazing and the shampoo worked really well. As far as service is concerned, after all, the training and management of hotels in mountainous areas are not as good as in other regions of the brand, but fortunately, I met Ms. Yueyue at the front desk, Jiang Junfeng from the concierge department, and three big star ****-shoveling uncles, which saved a lot of experience. Whenever there is a problem, I will try my best to help you solve it. Uncle **** shoveler is very hospitable. Especially during the stay at the hotel, Xiaojiang has been asking Xiaojiang to arrange activities and use the car. Xiaojiang is very responsible. He takes the initiative to take the luggage, helps press the elevator, and chats with him while waiting for the car. He will record the license plate and phone number when calling the car to ensure the safety of the guests. , a strong sense of service. As a high-end hotel brand, it should have a sense of service that makes guests feel at home, and implement the brand spirit in the hearts of hoteliers in every region. I hope that when we meet again in winter, the experience will be even better.

Service: The service varies, and some of them are felt from the heart. The waiters in the restaurant are okay when they serve you. From many angles, the waiters turn their backs to the customers, which is a bit uncomfortable.

msg:One week in advance, I decided to go to Changbai Mountain and chose the No. 1 Park Hyatt. I was pleasantly surprised by the accommodation experience. I had a phone consultation before check-in. Ms. Leah gave very patient and considerate answers and services. Comparing my heart, the hotel feels very European and Chinese-style retro , It seems that it has been a while since the decoration, but all kinds of equipment are complete and warm. There are not too many varieties of breakfast, but it is no problem to meet the needs. It just feels that there are some desserts missing. What I especially want to praise is the service. Exquisite, thoughtful and patient. I am very impressed with a little brother named HALLEY who is very chatty and enthusiastic. The hotel restaurant is very good. If you don‚Äôt want to step on the thunder, it is a good choice. I will choose Park Hyatt next time I go! Five-star recommendationüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü

After receiving the certificate, I arranged the honeymoon decoration and upgraded the suite. The 110 square meters can be said to be very nice. The scenery outside the door is facing the snow field. Although I was sent to the Halla Mountain Hot Spring, I am too lazy to go downstairs. My own hot spring is pretty good, and I even got a double breakfast. The service attitude is very good. When I got to the room, I called to ask if I want to be sent to the airport. There is beer, Coke, Sprite in the refrigerator, and there are ice cubes on the table, 666 , it can be said that all aspects are quite thoughtful, I will come again next time! üëç

You need to order meals in this season. Due to the off-season of skiing, the hot spring facilities in the hotel are sufficient. You don‚Äôt need to consider the surrounding area and it is very convenient, including swimming pools. The water quality is clean and clear. The staff is very considerate. At night, you can find staff to warm up the hot spring. The hotel equipment is still of lelabo22. The quality is guaranteed. The overall holiday a**osphere is very good. In addition, KFC, McDonald‚Äôs and Pizza Hut in the commercial area of the small town are open during the day, which is very suitable for those who want a comfortable and clean vacation environment comfortable young people come

But after I checked in, I learned that the outdoor pool that comes with it will not be open starting from 10/8. I can only go outside to take a dip in Hallasan Hot Spring. Due to the weather, it is not possible to pick up and drop off directly at the door.
It's very inconvenient. When I booked in October, I specifically asked about this pool. I can only say that the service is not good enough.
The front desk of the hotel is relatively cold and not as enthusiastic as the guy who took the luggage.

The hotel has its own snow house, which can slide in and out directly, which is very convenient. On the second night of our stay, it was snowing heavily, and the southerners were so happy~~~ The breakfast was rich and delicious, with a lot of varieties. If you go out to eat, the hotel will also considerately arrange a free car pick-up. By the way, you can also take the initiative to contact the pick-up and drop-off airport.
Those three Alaskans are so cute, they made appoin**ents twice, and they posed for pictures.
In short, the various services of Park Hyatt Hotel made this trip to Changbai Mountain even more memorable, highly recommended, and see you next timeüëã

msg:To be honest, it has not been renovated in the 10 years since it opened, and many facilities are too old. When I entered the door, I found that the wardrobe could not be closed at all, and the water could not be drained after taking a bath, and the knobs were broken. The main entrance of the hotel is too inconspicuous. I almost thought I went wrong. The villa-style layout is actually inconvenient during the snow season. You need to make a short-term parking for a battery car. The experience is really sorry for the price.
The only thing that needs to be praised is Sun Haoxi, the manager of the concierge depar**ent. Because there is no appoin**ent for a ski instructor, I asked someone to contact one temporarily, but the one I found is really unreliable. Services less than one hour will be charged for half a day. As a local, Manager Sun helped coordinate for a long time, and also introduced discounts for ski photography and free snowmobile items through his own relationship, so as not to make this skiing so bad, and it truly reflects the five-star service quality of Park Hyatt

This should be the best hotel in Changbai Mountain, I really can't understand it after checking in
1. The quality of the desktop paper is so poor that it cannot be drawn out, so I have to use the paper I brought with me in the car
2. The bath towels are so old that they are black, why this kind of consumables are not replaced, the hardware is also understandable
3. The quality of breakfast can't match the price of more than 3700 (this is not too busy season)
4. Hygienic issues are the most unacceptable to me
I stayed for one more day. At 11:00 in the morning, I called and went downstairs to communicate with the front desk. Please help vacuum and clean the room. When I came back at three o'clock, the room was not cleaned.
After I came back at night, the oil on the table was not cleaned
All the dust and hair on the bed intact
5. Tell Ctrip that the fruit was not delivered on the first day of check-in. They said that they have explained it well, but they still haven't. This is not important. The important thing is that I don't know what such a good hotel cares about now.

There is heating in the room, but the air conditioner has no warm air, and I woke up several times at night. There is no change card at the head of the bed, and the sheets and quilts are not changed by default. It is more convenient to have a separate ski house. It should be pointed out that the snowboard rack area outside the ski house door is written as a monitoring area. The boards that were stored for only one night were stolen the next day. I went to the hotel to look for monitoring, and was told that the storage location happened to be in a dead corner of monitoring, and the final solution was to call the police. Combined with the feedback from other losers on Xiaohongshu, things seem very strange. Overall: The price/performance ratio is not high.

msg:I have stayed at Park Hyatt many times and this is the first time I write a review. My daughter was under 12 years old when I first checked in, and now she is 18 years old. During the time when I came to Changbai Mountain, I almost stayed at Park Hyatt. To be honest, the hotel facilities are a bit old, but skiing is still the most convenient one in Changbai Mountain Wanda Resort. It is basically impossible to ski out if you have your own ski house, but if you can go to the intermediate road, ski in is still very convenient , especially coming down from the big white tiger. I didn't have this ability last year, but my skiing skills have improved a lot this year. The big white tiger is no longer a problem. After three days of refreshing skating this time, my daughter still feels that she still has more to say. Looking forward to the next time. In terms of service, I also feel very warm. On the night of check-in, the front desk staff felt at home. They not only met the requirements for staying in the main building, but also quickly handled late check-out (Ctrip benefits). Was in a bit of a rush to organize as I was skiing on the morning of check out and left a pair of glasses in the room. I can only trouble the front desk to open the card and go back to the room to look for it. The front desk staff is not impatient, but unfortunately I didn't find the glasses when I went back to the room. Later, Xiao Wang (Na), the room service staff, found my glasses under the quilt. Overall the hotel service is excellent, including the restaurant staff. There should be a chance to stay again.

msg:The package I bought on the 99th Festival, I made an appoin**ent to stay after the Spring Festival, and I didn‚Äôt make up the difference. It is 2600 a night including breakfast, which is not cheap. Park Hyatt is indeed the best hotel in Changbai Mountain, others are even worse, but the quality of service is still far from the price, and some problems are unbearable for hotels of this level.
Front desk service is good, no problem. The concierge feels like they are chatting all the time. This Park Hyatt design means that you need to walk through the snow to get to the villa. If you have a lot of luggage, you have to drag it with the concierge. I don‚Äôt want to go through it again. When the room is not good, the concierge tells us not to It is not safe to store computers. Should we go skiing with our computers on our backs? A few days later we were going to Zaizhihe in Erdaobaihe, the concierge promised to help us find a taxi with a meter, but on the second day we could only charter a car, and on the third day there was no further information, so I had to silently postpone the self-driving...
The room is very dark, like every Park Hyatt. This one doesn‚Äôt even have a writing desk, and there‚Äôs no turn-down bed. Every day, the cleaning staff knocks on the door and asks if you want ice cubes. I really don‚Äôt understand it at minus 20 degrees. Is this just a turn-down bed? ? The welcome fruit is an apple, a pear, and an orange. Alas, there is no independent radiator in the room, and there is partial floor heating next to the bathtub, so it is impossible to dry masks and gloves. Although the furnishings and soft furnishings seem to be of good quality, they are not as good as Luneng next door. Switzerland is more suitable for skiing.
The breakfast was even more speechless. The first day was okay, and I saw a few slices of smoked salmon. The second day, there were no empty plates. The peak season has passed. It‚Äôs already February, and a group of guests stood at 10 o‚Äôclock to wait for empty plates , As a result, all the food was taken out at 10:30 a.m., so speechless... Can't you properly organize a la carte if the self-service is like this? You are Park Hyatt...
Skiing and hot springs...ski out, it should be considered as Hyatt, the cable car station is at the door of the house, Park Hyatt has to carry a board to climb a short uphill, and then slide across the magic carpet of the crowds, it is not friendly to novices and beginners, I My baby and I were on the cable car and saw a young couple who went out together were still circling in situ. There was no problem with skiing in, and we could slide back to the hotel on both Gentleman Road and Baihu Road.

The hot springs are scary... I saw this pool from the cable car. It was so popular and photogenic. As a result, there were three steps in the depth of the water, unattended (relying on monitoring), without any signs, and the shallowest part was only a few centimeters. I saw several men in the evening. Sliding phone dropped in water...
The biggest advantage: Like other hyatts, the food is good, not amazing, but compared to most restaurants inside and outside the town, the price/performance ratio and taste are all better. The three of us couldn't finish the 500-plus set meal. It should be okay to go in the off-season.

When the building is full during the Spring Festival, you rarely meet others when you shuttle in the building. It has its own hot spring, which is worth experiencing.

msg:The hotel is beautiful, the service is very good, the dog is very good‚ú®
We stayed at Park Hyatt for the Spring Festival, checked in on the 30th day of the year, and checked out yesterday on the second day of junior high school. Park Hyatt gave us a particularly warm and beautiful holiday experience~

Environment: Park Hyatt is on the mountain, relatively less crowded and quiet. There are trails, small forests and ziplines outside the back door. It is covered with snow and is very beautiful~ The snow house is also very convenient, clean and tidy, and there is no situation where the board cannot be borrowed. We picked up veneers at the Westin snow house today and were told to go to the town after we borrowed them...

Facilities: The heating is very good, the temperature dropped yesterday, but as soon as you enter the hotel gate, you will be warmed up immediately! The room is also very warm~ I didn‚Äôt think it was very special in Park Hyatt until I moved to Sheraton yesterday, and the lobby directly gave me diarrhea from the cold. I miss Park Hyatt very much... The hotel‚Äôs hot spring is also very good, the water temperature is very suitable, as long as It‚Äôs not cold to jump into the water. You must experience the snow hot springs. After skiing, your legs are sore. Soaking in a hot spring is warm and comfortable. My husband likes the sauna very much, especially when he is cold when going out to play. Steaming is really good for the whole body comfortable!

Service: The doorman of the hotel will take the initiative to help deliver the luggage. What is missing in the room is delivered in a timely manner. I have to complain about Sheraton again and asked to send a quilt. After waiting for half an hour, it didn't arrive. Ask again? Gone! Park Hyatt will never have this kind of thing happen. The spare parts are also very easy to use, especially the body lotion. Changbai Mountain is very dry here. After using up the hand cream I brought with me, I rely on Park Hyatt‚Äôs body lotion. The room service responds very promptly, and the body lotion is enough. great! The uncle who takes care of the dogs is also very nice. If you have any requests, tell him, he will try his best to cooperate and help take pictures~ In addition, after moving to the Sheraton yesterday, I found that the scarf was missing. I called Park Hyatt to inquire, and I will reply in a few minutes I found it, and asked me whether to pick it up or send it by mail~~In short, Park Hyatt‚Äôs service response is very timely, which I really like and enjoy~~

Another thing to add is that I like Park Hyatt's breakfast very much! Although there are not many types, they are all exquisite~ The beef ramen is delicious, and the uncle who cooks the noodles is also very cute. He will bring it to me in time when the noodles are ready; the auntie who makes fried eggs is super skilled, no matter what you want It can fry for you, oil-free, soft-boiled...I only want egg whites and not egg yolksüòÇThere is also freshly squeezed juice for breakfast, I like watermelon juice, and celery juice is surprisingly delicious~~
 
I like Park Hyatt. If I come to Changbai Mountain again, I will choose Park Hyatt again!

msg:The hotel is quiet and elegant, the breakfast is rich, and the service staff are very friendly. It may be due to the terrain, the overall building is relatively narrow and winding (resulting in a belt-like restaurant shape) and it takes a long way to go to the ski house. It is a bright spot that the ski house can provide lockers for free, which saves the need to move ski equipment. By the way, I forgot the thermos cup in the car when I took the hotel bus for free drop-off. I called the hotel customer service, and the customer service immediately contacted the driver and sent me to the airport hall. Thank you very much. The rattle is very loud, it is probably aging, and it does not match the high-end image of Park Hyatt.

Living in the main building is very well heated. Watching the sunrise in the morning and watching the fireworks in the evening, I am tired of soaking in the hot spring. Downstairs of the hotel is a snow house, which is very convenient to slide in and out. The service of Park Hyatt Changbaishan Hotel is very good, and the front desk staff are very enthusiastic. Facilities are a bit old, acceptable.

When you get tired from playing in the snow, you can go to the hot springs. It is very convenient to take the children there. You don‚Äôt have to run around, and the children are very happy! The hotel also gave away the water world and another snow play, there is no time to play hahaha, too much fun!

msg:I lived in Westin a few days ago, and Park Hyatt in the back. The service attitude clearly wins Westin. Park Hyatt is really so-so. Especially breakfast. My daughter goes skiing at eight o'clock, and we have breakfast after seven o'clock. There are no morning tea snacks. Let's ask when it will be available. The answer was that the chef was too busy, and someone steamed it when he was free. I don't think that's the right attitude. The hot spring is indeed the only one among so many hotels that has its own hot spring. No other hotel has it, the biggest advantage of Park Hyatt. It is also very convenient to have your own ski house. The attitude of the front office staff who checked us in was very good, I like this. Our room had a nice view of the ski slopes and hot springs.

The experience of waking up early and rushing into the biting cold wind to eat breakfast is also very bad. And the room is facing north, without a ray of sunlight coming in, it is cold and gloomy. On the last night, after a struggle, I got a small electric heater. When checking out, she reported these situations to the front desk, and she found many reasons. Spend money to buy guilt.

The key is that there are few people and it is hygienic. The shower area is also very clean and has no peculiar smell. Don‚Äôt go to Halla Mountain when you live in Park Hyatt. Halla Mountain is full of bells and whistles, but the water quality is very dirty. National Day is the same as dumplings. You have to wait in line to take a bath. It is interesting to take the cable car to play the slides and pulleys in the morning, but it is necessary to queue up early on holidays, otherwise it will take too much time. The resort area in autumn is still particularly beautiful. There is a plank road behind Park Hyatt to go up the mountain (the end point is the Zhengxi slide) and you can exercise on foot. You can make an appoin**ent with the front desk to meet and take photos with the dog every day. The family of three is very cute, which is also a major feature of the hotel.

At present, the hotel can take the cableway to overlook the distant snow-capped mountains, play speed skating, and book an interactive group photo with the three Alaskans in the hotel.
The hotel has its own outdoor and indoor hot springs, but Boyue's hot springs are not natural, but they are also very comfortable. During the stay, I will send you a Hallasan hot spring, because we didn't see the time and missed it, but it doesn't matter. I think honeymoon travel, Relaxation is the best, there is no need to rush the itinerary, if you have the opportunity to come again, or stay in Boyue

The front desk of the hotel has been upgraded to a suite with a large terrace. It is unobstructed at first glance, and the beautiful scenery is unobstructed. The landscape map is placed in the picture. It is really beautiful, and it is probably even more invincible in the snow season.
The service is very good and attentive. David at the front desk of the hotel saw us bring a bottle of beer to the room and asked if we needed to send ice cubes. When leaving the hotel, the lady at the front desk gave the child a super cute little squirrel doll.
Now during the off-season, the hotel's breakfast is semi-self-service. Except for some cold dishes, the hot food is made to order and is very fresh.
If you do nucleic acid in the resort area before 3:00 p.m., you will get the results that night. After 3:00 p.m., the results will not be released until 12:00 p.m. the next day (it is suspected that it will only be sent down the mountain once a day). The hotel did not pay attention to reminding, when everyone came to play Pay attention to yourself.

For the first time, I went to the Northeast to experience a one-stop vacation trip.
Hit, the off-season is even a bit chilly. But also enjoy
Tranquil autumn and better travel experience~
hvatt really occupies the best location in the resort, and Park Hyatt's services are
Although online, the front desk patiently helped me to answer within three days.
500 questions, haha~~ If you live in the main building, go to the swimming pool.
Convenient, the villa area is cleaner. Have fun with the dogs
Hvatt's big star is one of the off-season benefits!
There are many choices of food and play in the resort area, and the favorite is still in the hotel
Take a walk on the nearby hills and watch the clouds, the weather in early autumn is really pleasant
!
Looking forward to seeing you in this snow season!

msg:When I lived in Hyatt Regency Changbai Mountain 6 years ago, I thought that I would definitely come back to Park Hyatt.
After a lapse of six years, this is the third Park Hyatt I have checked in, and it is the Park Hyatt I personally think I am most satisfied with.
Someone contacted the day before check-in and asked if you need to pick up the plane, whether you have a baby, and the approximate arrival time. If you are driving by yourself, you must pay attention to safety when building roads at the entrance of the town.
There were not many people at check-in, the lady at the front desk was very efficient, and the rights and interests of the town were also bound up, no matter how small or small.
Changbai Mountain in midsummer is very cool, and the room is very cool without air conditioning. Our room is in the main building, facing the woods outside the window, which is very private and quiet.
The room is very big, it is still the design of two doors, the sense of design is very strong. However, the fly in the oin**ent is that the solid wood furniture and the floor in the room are deformed, the problem of the floor is particularly prominent, it is creaky when stepped on, and the noise is very loud.
Toiletries are lelabo 22 and the citrus smell is nice too.
Room service is responsive and responsive.
The dinner in the Yue Hall is very appetizing and satisfies the northeastern stomach. There are small changes in the style of the two-day set menu, and we have not considered going to the town to eat. There are not many kinds of breakfast, but the taste is very good. The elder sister of the noodle stall will bring the noodles to the table when they are cooked. The other service staff are very quick and quick, and their attitudes are very enthusiastic. Problem solving is very timely.
There is a glasses-wearing sister and a little brother in the spa who are very enthusiastic. We want to see the bubble pool first, and they will be very enthusiastic to introduce us and show us.
The cleaning in the room is also very reassuring. Every day I go back to the room, I can smell the smell of disinfectant. Even the cigarette butts on the balcony of the family members are cleaned up, and the details are satisfactory.
Rua dog time met with three big stars, the breeder elder brother felt that he treated them as his own children, showed us what they looked like when they were young and interesting videos, and took the trouble to take pictures for us.

This time, Park Hyatt in my hometown did not disappoint at all. The communication during the whole process was very, very smooth, and I felt like home. I think it can represent the highest service level of luxury hotels in Northeast China. Of course, the aging of the hardware in the room is also a problem, and I hope it can be properly solved.

After contacting Halley, the concierge staff, in advance, a special car came to the airport to pick us up when we got off the plane. It was just noon when we landed. The Chinese food at the hotel at noon was not bad. The price is probably not much different from the outside.
In the afternoon, I was planning to go rafting and I was still thinking about how to go. After asking the hotel, I also helped us arrange a car transfer. Because it was the first time, I didn't know much about each slope, so I asked Halley, and the little brother also introduced each slope to us. In the end, because time was tight, we chose Xipo.
In general, the hotel's quality service is guaranteed, and the toiletries are good. It's le labo. It focuses on the praise of Halley's service. It saves us a lot of time. Winter will come again!

It's a very comfortable stay uncomfortable. 2. The management of the hot spring locker room in the hotel is extremely chaotic and cannot guarantee the privacy and safety of guests. My wife went to the hot springs twice. For the first time, a male employee walked into the women's locker room and asked if anyone was there. Fortunately, my wife responded in a timely manner so that no one was seen. How could a male employee go straight into the female guest area? The second time, a parent brought a seven or eight-year-old boy into the women's locker room. The female guests were all naked to change and wash. During the period, a female employee came in to clean up, but they didn't stop them, so they pretended not to see them. In the end, my wife took everyone's privacy into consideration and reminded the parents to "invite" the boy out. Seven or eight-year-old boys are tall, and already have gender awareness, so they can't be ignored just because they are children, right? ? ? The hotel can't even protect the most basic privacy of guests, there is no sense of security at all, and the staff lacks training. Do you know the difference between men and women? In short, it feels very unpleasant to stay here, and there is a high probability that I will never think about it again.

msg:#Snow Season Covering Board Tour#Changbai Mountain Park Hyatt Hotel
This year is the 6th snow season I have been in contact with after skiing. Since I stayed at the Park Hyatt Changbai Mountain when the snow season was closed in 2020, I can finally visit Park Hyatt, the top 1 hotel in Changbai Mountain, again this year!
Park Hyatt has a ski in/ski out igloo that is really close at hand, and has also experienced the ski equipment hall in a ski town. Park Hyatt's igloo is bright, spacious, private and quiet. It is definitely the Hermes in the igloo. . Ski out is a white tiger rope that can be just warmed up. When you come back after a day of skating, you can put all the equipment in the large locker and go back to the room easily. In the evening, take a dip in the exclusive hot spring to relieve the soreness. Such a skiing experience is really heartwarming.

msg:It is probably the most expensive and worst Park Hyatt in China. The facilities are seriously aging. At 2:00 p.m., they said that there was no room and they called us immediately. Just say it's alright. At the beginning, the lights in Villa 9 were all turned on, but I couldn't see what was in the room. I called the front desk several times and said that someone would be dispatched to adjust and repair it later. I didn't apologize, and I was very rude. Ask what do I want? Shouldn't the hotel apologize and take the initiative to provide a plan! I still want to fool me. The lighting is like this. At my insistence, I asked to change rooms. After I changed to the main building, the lighting turned out to be normal. Even the items in the Mini bar were different... The welcome fruits in the package were not placed in advance at all. I asked for it on the phone, and then I changed the room and didn't make it up. The next day after skiing, I went back to my room, I was so tired that I wanted to lie down, but I found that the door was open, and there was a stinky master repairing the lights. Shouldn‚Äôt the lights be repaired after checking them out? I didn't report for repairs. The people from House keeping just knocked on the door and entered the room by themselves. It would be terrible to think about taking a shower or something. , The road to the ski field is the longest, and it is said that you can Ski in Ski out in your own ski house, but in fact, the road at the entrance is an intermediate road down a steep slope of 15 degrees. It takes 7-8 minutes to walk into the snow field with snow gear. Breakfast is also ordinary, Sever coffee and tea only have a cup without a saucer below, so funny.

3/ Ski house: The hotel has its own ski house. You can borrow ski equipment and clothes. The clothes, snow boots and skateboards are all new, very good, and very suitable for beginners. On my Changbai Mountain app, coaches of all levels can be easily booked. When you go out from the ski house, you can get to the ski field, and you can slide in and out. Like üëç
4/ Catering: The hotel‚Äôs Yuet Hall has a breakfast buffet in the morning. Various choices are good. Dinner was in the Yuet Hall. Northeastern dishes are delicious with blueberry pot and meat.

The environment is quiet and surrounded by green plants. The hotel is divided into the main building and various villas, giving it the feeling of a resort. nice environment.

The room should be the most spacious in the resort area. The room has mountain or garden views, which is better than other hotels. The hotel was built in 2012. The main building of the hotel is well maintained but the rooms are a bit old. Part of the wooden floor is a bit squeaky when stepping on it, and the wooden furniture also shows signs of age. It's almost ten years, it's time to think about decorating.

The hotel is well-equipped with a gym, swimming pool and spa. The separate trea**ent room has a large space with a shower and toilet. Master Johnny‚Äôs massage is very good. It relieved my sore muscles after a day of walking. Although there is only one all-day dining restaurant, you can also eat at the Chinese, Western and Korean restaurants in the nearby Hyatt Hotel.

üßπHygiene: The room is cleaned very well. I don‚Äôt know if the housekeeping aunt is not awake. The bed sheets on the first day actually have two small holes visible to the naked eye... The only deduction item has been changed after reporting to the front desk. .

üöó Transportation: Take the hotel‚Äôs free shuttle bus from Baishan Airport to the hotel in about 20 minutes, which is very fast and convenient. Like hotels in other resorts, you can only book a car to go to Changbai Mountain Scenic Area Nanbei Beibei, which takes about one and a half hours to two hours. There is a shuttle bus from Xibei Hotel every morning.

üîîService: Park Hyatt‚Äôs service is very good, even better than average five-star hotels. It can be said that the hotel's service makes its relatively old facilities and rooms raise a lot of scores. Regardless of the reception, catering and concierge services, the quality is very high, the attitude is cordial and friendly, and they can try their best to help guests solve problems and provide advice. I feel that there is nothing they can't do. It should be the most successful place in this Park Hyatt. Thanks to Charles at the front desk, Hawk and Julie from the food and beverage depar**ent, for making me feel like VIP service!

I went The person in charge of the spa is watching the video saying that the weather is not good and it‚Äôs too cold to watch, but isn‚Äôt the stargazing indoors?

Besides, there are not many types of breakfast, but the bacon is hard to eat. I had a dinner at the Yue Ting. The service staff directly put the order card on the table and ran to work on other things. I had a good meal and ordered a supper the next day because it was just after 9:30, I wanted to try to ask if I could order dinner because it is okay if the chef does not have the ingredients after work, but the staff is direct **** me, let me look at the dishes that I can order, and there are still many questions, I don‚Äôt want to vomit one by one
The Hyatt in Changchun and Grand Hyatt in Dalian are ranked lower than Park Hyatt in Changbai Mountain, but they are much better than Park Hyatt in everything from catering to facilities and services. Finally, what I want to say is that it is one of the best in the province. Boutique designer hotels occupies the unique geographical scenery of Changbai Mountain. Travel advantages. Don't beat a good card. Luxury hotels must be worthy of this price and reputation. Don't discount because of the off-season and peak seasons. In the hearts of the guests, the passenger flow may be divided into low and peak seasons, but the service of the hotel should not be High and low

msg:The location of the hotel is far away, the hardware facilities are average, and it can even be said to be old. Both the shower and the floor should be eliminated. but! The service is really good! I was really disappointed when I first entered the hotel. But I found the bright spot after staying. Paochi and Gouzi and services are really worth the money. So I will choose to stay if I have the opportunity! Give us a thumbs up to the big brother who walked the dog with us, and repelled us all the mosquitoes. Must give him processing capital! The service is great! Oh, and the breakfast is average, there are not many types of a la carte and nothing particularly amazing. Also, it‚Äôs time to clean up the outdoor bubble pool, which contains a lot of debris.

msg:Last night, the only international super five-star hotel brand in the entire Wanda Resort, the rooms and brands of Park Hyatt are too fragrant~
The cleaning brand is a full set of lelabo, which smells super good! I like it very much~
There are many rights to stay in the hotel, soaking in hot springs (both indoors and outdoors) and archery view
Star... During this period, there are not too many tourists living in the store affected by the epidemic, so the entertainment activities are still very comfortable and refreshing. There is also a lovely three-dog Alaska in the store, super cute and super Buddha, you can make an appoin**ent to play-
The front desk service of the hotel is super good, and the service is also timely when there is a problem!
The downside is that some of the facilities are a bit old, and the wooden floor of the hotel can make sound. Because the toilet is replaced with a smart toilet, it is time to update the hardware.
The overall living experience is very good~ Mainly because it is too grassy for this brand
Will be our preferred place of residence next time

msg:Really disappointed.
        First of all, when we came to pick them up, it was a small broken car, which didn't have so many seats at all, and it was crowded with the driver, the pick-up person, and two people in the room. When I came up to check in, the front desk gave me a very dark room in the annex building. After staying for one night, I felt that I couldn't bear it, so I changed to a bright room. There is also welcome fruit, don't give it away.
        The igloo is even worse, the service attitude is extremely bad, and the shoes and snowboards of the right size are not given to the guests. You tell them that this size is not good, and they whisper, can you make a difference? You really have to be careful, if you wear the wrong size of shoes, it is easy to sprain your feet. They didn't apologize until we got into a fight with them.
        The last is the guest room. I took off the bracelet when I took a shower and put it in the shower. I found it after I checked out. I called and told you that there was no one. I insisted that you put it somewhere else. The room supervisor said to confirm and call me back. , and never called again.
        I don't want to make trouble for myself, I really don't live in Park Hyatt, really, I don't deserve to say that I am Park Hyatt. On the hot spring side, there is only one lazy and broken hair dryer with a sticky handle. The only two points go to the concierge. The people in the concierge are very enthusiastic. For the rest, forget it.

msg:The hotel has been upgraded to the main building suite for free. As a senior business traveler who has stayed in all brand hotels, he still has a deep feeling about the Changbaishan Park Hyatt Hotel, and the service and catering still maintain the consistent high quality of Park Hyatt. Because it is in the forest area, wind erosion is more serious on the facade of the building. Because the three-day schedule is too full, there is no time to experience all the tickets presented. However, if you pursue high quality in the Changbai Mountain Scenic Area, it is recommended to choose Park Hyatt.

msg:The breakfast is not bad, the variety is not too much, the quality is not bad, the bacon is hard to bite, I guess it has been heated for too long, it is estimated that there are too few people in the off-season and it is difficult to be a cook. Overall service
It‚Äôs all okay. The concierge is not very interesting. I made an appoin**ent to pick up the airport and said that someone would contact me. After landing, I saw all kinds of people holding the hotel pick-up sign at the exit. I didn‚Äôt see the Park Hyatt Hotel. After inquiring, I found the parking lot by myself and found the airport shuttle bus from Park Hyatt Hotel. The driver showed me the list on the phone. There was no my name. The driver enthusiastically let me get in the car. Checking in to the hotel went smoothly. The floor of the hotel is indeed well-deserved, with its own anti-theft security function. It makes a creaking noise when stepping on it. It is not an ordinary noise. If there is an uninvited guest, there is absolutely nowhere to hide. How do they achieve this function? Table tennis and archery are free, and there are astronomical telescopes for guests to see the stars at night (you can see the moon), and the quality of the waiters in charge of this activity area is still very high. You can also make an appoin**ent to walk the dog, three docile giant huskies. The swimming pool and hot spring room facilities are good, and the service is also good. The overall service is not bad, which is considered to be five-star, but the gap with Park Hyatt in first-tier cities is still very large. The wild ones are pretty good. Before leaving, the niche in charge of welcoming guests at the gate of the concierge depar**ent was almost meaningless. First, the commanding parking was lacking in politeness and kindness, and it was a bit coaxing. He doesn't help guests with things either, and standing at the door is a bit silly. The location is in the innermost part of the resort, but the whole resort is not too big, and the distance is not a problem.

The hotel has a good environment. There are many items such as archery, badminton, swimming and hot springs. The water park, hot springs, cable cars and bicycles are also good every day.

The hotel's service is very good, Liu Jiajia from the special restaurant is very warm and thoughtful!

msg:The hotel is located in a relatively secluded Banpo in Wanda Resort, suitable for those who enjoy a quiet vacation. It is a 5-minute walk from Wanda Town. The hotel‚Äôs children‚Äôs facilities are suitable for children of all ages from 2 to 12 years old. The outdoor indoor hot springs in the swimming pool are very good. It is recommended to get up early to watch the sunrise and enjoy the tranquility of the hotel and resort in the morning. The fruit ice cubes were ready when I entered the room. Before I left, the ID card was missed in the room. The staff made a lot of phone calls before contacting me to express my thanks. If there are only two days, friends who go to the west slope of Changbai Mountain will depend on the weather. If it is sunny, choose to go up the mountain on the first day and enjoy the hotel and water park on the second day. There is no need to take the shuttle bus from the hotel to the water park, because it is very close. After 5 minutes on foot, you will wait for the shuttle bus to pick you up at 8 o'clock. It will depart from the water park at 9 o'clock. You have to wait an hour at the water park site. The complimentary cable car is recommended to sit in the evening. The fog is less and the visibility is high. The view of Changbai Mountain is beautiful. Of course, you can also see the hotel room, but the height is different. Tickets for the water park are free, but the cabinet is charged, 30 boxes, a family of three boxes and a rental life buoy 40. It cost 100. No food is allowed in it, but there is no requirement for water. You must bring enough. The room is a bit boring.
