msg:This might as well have been a spa hotel. It was calm, secluded and was very relaxing. The hot pool was great and I had it to myself and the pool was warm with such incredible views. They even give you rides there and back (2 minute journeys). The staff were very helpful and accommodating too. It is a little out of the way but I like that and the location in between the mountains is very calming and unique. Breakfast was not bad and the afternoon tea, i liked though it would be nice if it was different on some days. The room itself was spacious and large with a very comfortable bed. Thoroughly recommend this hotel.

msg:Very pleasant stay. We booked this hotel last-minute off-season and enjoyed the hot springs all by ourselves. Great views on the mountain, very friendly staff. The breakfast is a bit thin on the western food parts but rich with Chinese food although the choice is limited. In the afternoon you get a selection of sweets with tea or coffee. The rooms are are large and clean. One of our two toilets (we booked a family room for up to 5) was so small that adults could hardly sit down - construction mistake because there would have been enough space. All in all a clear recommendation.

msg:This place falsely advertises and has serious issues with their water quality. 

Our bath water was YELLOW (see photo) and they claimed this is normal during rainy season, even though it didn't rain when we were there. 

1. They only have 2 out of 5 hot spring pools open 
2. Even though breakfast is included, they didn't have a full buffet because there wasn't enough guests so we had a very limited breakfast 
3. The hotel is centrally controlled for the entire building so the air conditioning in our room doesn't work. It got so hot at night because they ran the heat on high, we couldn't sleep. 

I complained about all of this and they gave me a 10% discount and they didn't fix anything. They just made excuses for everything. It's hilariously bad. I hope the hotel gets shut down

We had to wait for checking in, but it was not bad to wait while enjoying fruits and green tea, during their tea time in the afternoon. The breakfast was decent too! The staff attitude and service is pretty good and the amenities are superb! I do have a few suggestions though to make it more expat friendly. There should be direct access to the pool, and international credit cards should be accepted.

The view from our balcony was stunning, we were surrounded by mountains and fresh air. The hotel is a little further from west street that I thought (about 10-15 mins by car) but it was worth it. The hotel area is peaceful and quiet and had really lovely pools for the kids to swim in. I would choose to stay here again over being closer to the city. We felt so relaxed here! 

The breakfast in the hotel is simple but it’s delicious! Try the rice noodles cooked fresh when you order. The staff were always willing to help and they also served afternoon tea each day which was really enjoyable. We ate at the hotel restaurant on the first night and the food was so delicious. Beer fish and rice noodles were among the favourites.

I would stay again happily and I was so sad to leave the resort.

msg:Let me talk about the good things first: the hotel has a great view, located between mountains and water, which is really suitable for daydreaming. There were even quite a few surprises when I just checked in. The room was large, there was an infinity pool and hot spring, and there was a shuttle bus for pick-up.

Let's talk about the bad things: At night, many unsatisfactory points came out. 
First of all, the water in the bathtub was yellow. Although I asked the front desk, they said it was the water in the water pipe and it would be fine if I let it sit for a while, and then I let it sit for at least half an hour before it looked normal.
In addition, there were stains on the towels. Although they explained that they were scalded by disinfection, I think it's not right for a hotel at this price not to pay attention to these details.
Finally, the most unbearable thing for me was that the air conditioner was set to cool but the hot air was out, which made it difficult to fall asleep at night. I asked the customer service but the problem was not solved. Finally, I had no choice but to turn off the air conditioner and open the balcony door, but I was bitten by mosquitoes and couldn't fall asleep, resulting in a sleepless night.

The hotel is located in the Moon River Scenic Area of ​​Shili Gallery. From a distance, the whole hotel looks like a resort. The rooms have an elegant environment and complete facilities.
After all, the main focus is light luxury and the service is particularly thoughtful.
What surprised me the most was
The current season is completely suitable here.
If you like swimming in the summer, you must go to the infinity pool to take photos and check in!
I went to the 180-degree constant temperature hot spring at night
In winter, soaking in hot springs while admiring the lights and night view is the ultimate enjoyment.
It deserves to be called a "daze" hotel
In the summer, you can soak in the swimming pool and look at the distant mountains and rivers. In the winter, you can soak in the hot springs.
When you come here, you will automatically switch to daze mode.
It’s so happy just to waste time here like this

The whole family unanimously agreed that Yangshuo has the best value for money (the prices of these B&Bs in Yangshuo are too high during the holidays, and the value for money of this one is close to that of Shangri-La, Guilin).
The hotel facilities are relatively new. Although the location is not in the center of Yangshuo, it is very leisurely and has mountain views.
We don’t like to do travel photography, so we just feel good about cycling at the foot of the nearby mountains.
The breakfast is relatively simple in the style of a B&B, but I think it's okay.
The hot spring is really good, much better than the so-called indoor private hot springs (which are actually just dug out a bathtub). Halfway up the mountain, there is at least a small open-air hot spring with a view, which is suitable for a family to soak alone. The condition of the bathroom next to it is also up to standard.
The service was very good. They took the trouble to meet our requests and helped us find items we left behind in the soup pool twice.
If you like this small and beautiful B&B style, I highly recommend it.

The mountains are so peaceful, and so is my heart.
Walking in the mist of early winter, you can see deep and shallow green in your eyes, and the free and unfettered wind in your ears. The bamboo forest in the distance disappears into the mountains, and you feel like a dream in a trance.

You can walk aimlessly, you can stop and admire, you can sit with the plants and trees, talk to the river, and occasionally lament that time passes so slowly, and even the air in the mountains is very quiet and long.

This time I came to Yangshuo Daxuankong Hot Spring Hotel. The guest room was

msg:When I came here, I really calmed down. I was busy enjoying the photos and there were very few photos. Let’s just take a look at them. The room was clean and tidy, and it was very comfortable to live in. The service here is very good. If you don’t have a good guide when you come to Yangshuo for the first time, you can ask the hotel Recommended by staff, they are all conscientious recommendations, and I am very satisfied with the fact that there are discounts for purchasing tickets in the hotel for various scenic spots. There is also a pick-up or drop-off service within 13 kilometers, especially the elder brother who sent me to Ruyi Mountain. Temporary work requires ID photos to be taken. On Sundays, all ID photos here are closed. My brother took me to 4 places before I found a place where I could take photos. I really want to thank the driver. I forgot to ask his name. All in all, he is a handsome person and does a good job. Thank you. I also gave you a souvenir when I checked out. It was really thoughtful. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Yangshuo. It is really comfortable. Finally, I give you a hotel I would like to make a small suggestion. I don’t know what other rooms are like. There is no dressing mirror in my room. Girls and brothers who go out to play still like to look in the mirror before going out. It is recommended to arrange a dressing mirror. Perfect.

msg:The hotel is very large and is built close to the mountains and rivers. At a glance, you can see the rolling mountains of Guangxi, the winding Yulong River and the golden rice fields. It is really beautiful!
Take the hotel's sightseeing car to the outdoor swimming pool halfway up the mountain, where you can have an unobstructed view of the surrounding scenery in the oversized infinity pool. Below the swimming pool are small hot spring pools. After a day of running around, I came here to soak in the hot springs, and all the fatigue was swept away.
The facilities in the hotel room are also very complete, with all kinds of toiletries available, and the separation of the bath and toilet is really thoughtful. As soon as the room is opened, there is a fragrant smell.
It also provides free pick-up and drop-off service, making the whole journey comfortable. When you are tired, you can take the hotel car back to the hotel to sleep. Don’t be too happy!

msg:I was very much looking forward to staying at the hotel, but I was a little disappointed after actually arriving.
1. The facilities in the room feel very old and there is always a smell. Moreover, the small courtyard faces the road outside, and you can see the cars and pedestrians on the road. To be honest, it is difficult to guarantee safety and privacy.
2. The air conditioner is still broken on the day of check-in. Please contact the front desk for help in repairing it. Very speechless!
3. Staying for two nights, a buffet was provided for breakfast on the first day. Although it was not very delicious, it was considered a buffet. The next day, they actually said that because there were too few people staying, they would no longer provide self-service and would only provide set meals. . I have never encountered this kind of thing in all these years of staying in a hotel. They say they provide a buffet, but can they change the set meal because there are less people? At least it’s a hotel worth over a thousand dollars!
4. Only a few hot springs are open, but it is the off-season, which is understandable.


Although there are many dissatisfaction points, the hotel's environment is, for one thing, good. You can take photos and check in. The front desk service is also very enthusiastic. We added WeChat communication in advance and basically responded to all requests. However, I can only say that except for the environment and the service of the front desk staff, I feel that nothing is worthy of the price of more than 1,000! ! The family members living together are basically not very satisfied! ! 🙃

The breakfast is good, with basically everything you need, and afternoon tea is also available.

☆Transportation: From the high-speed rail to Yangshuo Station, the hotel provides free shuttle service to West Street once. It is very convenient to take a taxi from West Street back to the hotel.
☆Environmental facilities: Surrounded by mountains, fields and green water, the environment is unparalleled! The room layout and bedding are also very good, and the experience is great!
☆Meals: Afternoon tea is provided upon check-in. Breakfast is relatively simple, but enough for traveling; I had dinner in the restaurant once, which was good value for money.
☆Service: It was off-season when I went there, so it was nothing, but the attitude of the front desk and other service staff was very good. There was a free shuttle bus to and from the hot springs, restaurants, and swimming pools on call.
In short, it is worth recommending whether it is a parent-child trip, a family trip, or a couple's vacation. Of course, there are too many B&Bs and hotels to choose from in Yangshuo. If you have enough time and budget, you can compare and choose.

The prices at the hotel restaurant were also very affordable. The laundry room also had various drying equipment and a hair dryer. Xiaomi's product is very easy to use, but I suggest you change the shampoo and conditioner. The quality is too poor, and my hair is dry after washing.

First of all, service, answering every question, satisfying everything that can be satisfied, every employee serves with a smile, there are dryers and washing machines, and the service of calling a car when you go out. Secondly the swimming pool! It’s really a big place, a place where mother’s hands are free, and the pool is very clean. I order a cup of coffee and buy a snack next to it, and the children are playing in the pool to their heart’s content. It’s very impressive! There is a place to change and wash clothes and there is a bubble pool under it. The hotel is just like a scenic spot. The scenery is beautiful, and there is light music to set off the environment. We went to Qianguqing and used a free delivery service. When I came back, I called Didi. The Didi navigation was wrong. If I had known it earlier, I would have asked the hotel to pick it up. In short, it is highly recommended to stay here again when you come to Yangshuo in the future!

The environment is very good, but it is a bit remote. There is a small road to go from the main road. At first, I didn't think there was a hotel here. When I turned the corner, it felt like flowers blooming on the willow bank. However, I have to complain about the tram service for the infinity pool. When I arrived, I didn’t even come in to say hello. No one in the room knew that the tram was coming, and by the time they reacted, the tram had already left. Although the infinity pool is beautiful, the water is really unclean. There are too many suspended flocs and it feels like there is something wrong with the filtration system.

msg:On the way to the hotel by car, I sighed the picturesque scenery of Yangshuo. The location of the hotel is really unique. The infinity pool on the mountainside is in line with the hotel name "find yourself, stay here". It can only be described as beautiful. Book The family suite room is very large, and there is no problem for four adults to live there. It would be more perfect if there is an extra toilet. Finally, I would like to thank the hotel staff for their meticulous service, which is the most impressive part of my trip.

The open-air infinity pool in the middle of the mountain is amazing. The waiters in the whole hotel are very warm and polite, and they can solve the needs immediately. There is also a battery car in the hotel. You can pick up and drop off the reservation to the restaurant or swimming pool at any time. It is very convenient for guests with children and the elderly. The restaurant in the middle of the mountain is very quiet. We ate twice in a row.

Later, because I read several bad reviews from Ctrip, I decided to try to live on the first floor, which is more economical. After I went in, I regretted that I didn't pay a little more to live well! It’s not bad to come out and play for a few hundred in order to see the most beautiful scenery! So here to tell everyone this hotel is worth it! Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle pick-up! very clean! The scenery is very beautiful! The service attitude is very good! Will come again next time! Please keep it up!

msg:Hotel hardware is still possible. There is a very good swimming pool! But the service is really not online! There is only one round table in the lobby of the hotel restaurant. Ten of us had dinner at the round table in the lobby on the first day. Both value for money and taste are okay. I want to continue to dine at the round table in the lobby the next night, but the round table has already been booked. The waiter offered to sit at the long table. I said that there are so many people in Chinese food and the long table is not convenient for serving food. I decided to eat elsewhere. When I came out, I found that there was a box with a round table! So he went in and said let's take a box. The waiter said that the minimum consumption of the box is 1,500 yuan! (It is illegal to set a minimum consumption for a restaurant box). I said that our 6 majors and 4 minors will definitely not be able to spend, and your boxes are also empty! Just talk to your leaders. But the waiter came to say that this is the minimum consumption stipulated by our leader! ! (Waste of food and beverages is now prohibited. Order as much as you eat. Isn’t it a waste if you order too much and can’t finish it?) In the end, we really can’t afford it! I can only walk away in despair. Is this the hotel's attitude towards guests who want to stay in the hotel? ? Also, if you want a low pillow, call and have it delivered. The front desk said to look for it. But it didn't arrive in half a day! After a while, I went to the front desk and asked for a lower pillow. The waiter said no. (There are no spare pillows in the hotel? Even if there are none, there are other rooms! The occupancy rate of the room is at most half of the day) The training of hotel staff is obviously not in place! ! If you can't afford the 1200+ house price with such a service!

The thickness of the quilt is very important. Most hotel quilts are very thick. This one is just right. Wherever you go to play, the hotel will send a car to pick you up, which is very convenient. The swimming pool is the absolute best, and it was decided here because of the swimming pool. The only downside is the restaurant, which has few dishes, average taste, and average service.

The first is the service. After booking the hotel, the housekeeper will add WeChat. I often have some questions, and they will reply to me in a timely manner, including helping me book tickets. The hotel also has a shuttle bus to the bamboo raft point, which is very convenient.
The second is the swimming pool in the hotel, which is really amazing. When we arrived, it rained heavily in the evening. After the rain, we wanted to go for a swim. As a result, the sunset I saw was really beautiful. I feel that this trip is worth it for this sunset. There is also a hot spring under the swimming pool. I didn't go to see it when I was tired from swimming. I heard from friends that it was also good.
Finally, I gave a small gift when I left the store, I was super happy.

Environment: It will arrive soon after getting off the expressway, a little distance from West Street, but we are traveling by car, so it doesn't matter. The hotel is located on the side of the mountain, and the surrounding area is not very busy and noisy. I heard from the front desk that the hotel currently has 38 rooms, so there will not be many people when it is full.
Hygiene: Parent-child travel must be clean and hygienic. The scale of Dazed is not that of a large chain luxury hotel, but the hygiene is good.
Service: The service response is fast, the front desk, the driver, and the restaurant are very enthusiastic, and the experience is good. There are not many types of buffet breakfast, and it is not the main rich one. Even if you add food, it is not very expensive. The Banshan restaurant tastes good, and we will settle there for the first meal when we arrive.

The room on the 3rd floor of Building 2 that was just allocated was very close to the river and the water was noisy. The staff changed it to a house on the 2nd floor near the road, which is quiet and has a good view.
The hotel's swimming pool is especially commendable. The water in the open-air swimming pool is clean, and the temperature is very suitable for swimming in the afternoon. The hotel's breakfast is not particularly rich, but it is no problem to ensure that you are full. The service staff are generally warm and friendly, and help with luggage. Hotel parking is also more convenient, suitable for self-driving, but for tourists who do not drive, the location may be slightly off, not so convenient.
I hope that I can arrange a good room when I come to live next time.

The infinity pool is very popular among children, and there are several small ones next to it. Hot spring, when the sun is not so hot after taking a nap, it is so comfortable to swim in the water.
The hotel can also help to book helicopter tickets, which are more cost-effective. Finally, I experienced the excitement of low-altitude flight. Outside the hotel is a pier for sitting on bamboo rafts. It is more suitable to take children to sit on this kind of big bamboo raft, and experience the feeling of floating in the mountains and rivers. The boa**an was very enthusiastic and helped us take pictures along the way.
It is recommended that friends who travel to Guilin come to Yangshuo directly. If you don’t like too busy, choose a homestay farther away. It is very convenient to take a taxi, and you can also rent a battery car.
In short, the few days in Yangshuo were very leisurely. I didn't rush or check in various attractions. I took a vacation at my own pace. I recommend this hotel.

When you check in, you are shocked. It is full of details, except for the basic facilities of the hotel. Perfect, very clean, so clean that there is no rubbish on the road when going to the sky pool, and the small river next to the restaurant where we eat is also carefully taken care of. It is especially recommended to eat in the hotel, because it is very delicious, and the environment is comfortable and cheap. , we had lunch late, and there were several tables of girls chatting and drinking, because the environment inside is really good, no matter where you sit, you are pleasing to the eye, and the ingredients are fresh, the tableware is set, etc., the details are meticulous It makes you feel perfect, there is no need to describe the scenery, just looking at the photos will make people fall in love with it! When leaving the store, there are also thoughtful small gifts of special products, which are delicious, with a five-star review. Next time you travel to Guilin, you must stay there again👍👍👍

Active service, the battery car master even praised me and my friends as shy, but I feel that they are all enthusiastic from the heart, not forced to operate. The environment is very comfortable, and one day's stay is not enough. Although the variety of breakfast is not too much, it has everything you need. The Chinese food is delicious (but the crunchy fruit of Camellia oleifera seems a little wet and soft), and the western cakes are probably not made by myself, so it is average. A friend bought a bottle of sweet-scented osmanthus tea when he left. It's not too far to West Street, there is a car to take you out, and it's convenient to take a taxi when you come back. I went to Xiaohui Hot Spring, it was too hot, mainly for taking pictures. The swimming pool is very good.

msg:Hotel in the scenic area. As soon as you enter the door, you feel that the appearance is ordinary, but the details of the internal facilities are well done, and the service staff are also enthusiastic. Suitable for a leisurely vacation, if you want to check in to other attractions, there will be a short distance. The variety of breakfast is relatively small, and the restaurant dishes for dinner are relatively average.

The scenery on the mountain is very good, the swimming pool takes pictures and checks in, and the hot spring water is clean. There is an exquisite afternoon tea in the afternoon, and the hotel service is very good and considerate. Very satisfactory accommodation experience!

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first: there is a 270-degree invincible landscape on the top of the mountain platform, there are hot springs that take into account both privacy and scenery, there is the comfort of sitting on a rocking chair on the balcony, there is perfect hot water that you don’t want to come out after taking a bath, and there is very delicious Guilin Rice noodles, and a service that responds quickly;
Let’s talk about the areas that need improvement: the restaurant’s service speed and food quality are relatively average, which is too inconsistent with the price; several top sprays in the shower room of the hot spring are broken, and the water is not hot and not strong.
Finally, there is another objective situation: the location of the hotel is relatively secluded, and it is recommended to come here by car, otherwise it will be difficult to call Didi. Because I had to rush to the Jinlongqiao Wharf early in the morning to buy rafting tickets, I experienced the desperate situation of being unable to get a car for 45 consecutive minutes. In the end, I had to ask the hotel to find a cooperative team to solve the problem, although the price was twice as expensive as the normal Didi.

The hardware maintenance is very good, the sanitation is also very good, the service is professional and enthusiastic, free afternoon tea is provided every day, and there is also a special car to pick up and drop off various attractions. The coffee shop in the middle of the mountain has a first-class view, which is especially suitable for daze. It is better to suggest that the room is equipped with a capsule coffee machine. Overall, it is a very comfortable stay experience, and it can be the first choice for Yangshuo hotels!

msg:I am very glad that I chose a regular hotel for this trip to Yangshuo - the Dazed Hotel, and did not choose the so-called Internet celebrity homestay!
First of all, when the hotel is booked, the staff will add WeChat and tell some precautions. During this period, because I booked at the wrong time (don't learn from me! Be sure to confirm the check-in date again and again), there may be vacancies, so I changed the check-in date for free! It’s a great feeling if you haven’t checked in yet!
Secondly, the location of the hotel is at the end of Shili Gallery, away from the hustle and bustle. The building complex of the hotel almost covers a hill. There were not many people when we checked in, and there was a comfortable feeling of enjoying the mountains and rivers alone. A treasure hotel for sure.
Then, because there are old people and children, there are big and small bags. Communication before and after check-in, pick-up, and luggage were very smooth. The young lady at the reception and the little brothers who drove the sightseeing bus and picked up the luggage were very nice. When my parents have to take care of their children and have no time to go to afternoon tea, the staff can help get the room. The service can be called a five-star service~
Although the hotel lobby and small courtyard do not have the luxury of a five-star hotel, the view of the hotel pool was really amazing when I first saw it. A pat pat. There is also a hot spring pool next to it, where you can enjoy the beautiful landscape while soaking in the hot spring.
The hotel room is big enough, clean and tidy! Baby cots can be reserved in advance, which is more friendly to families with babies. But it would be better if there is a baby bathtub. From the balcony of the room, you can see the distant mountains and a branch of the Yulong River. If you get up early, you can watch the green hills shrouded in morning mist on the balcony, ducklings swimming in the river and happy crowds kayaking. Next to Longtan Wharf, you can take a bamboo raft for eight people (although we didn't take it).
Our family ate two meals in the restaurant of the hotel. Dianping has a set menu to choose from, and we can order some dishes a la carte, which is very cost-effective. Beer fish, beer duck, rice snail stuffing, bamboo tube chicken are all delicious 😋
In the end, of course, I think there is still room for improvement. That is breakfast, although it is a buffet breakfast but relatively basic. The featured ones are Guilin rice noodles, camellia oleifera, and mugwort cake, and there are not many other options.
Overall, I still recommend it~ This trip to Yangshuo was very tiring but very fun! Did not encounter a pit haha~

Every waiter in the hotel was very thoughtful and gave us the warmth of being at home, especially before we left, the hotel immediately called the driver who delivered the car, and when we returned to the hotel, the front desk clerk was already standing at the door to hold us items are waiting. Staying in this hotel is really NICE in all aspects, and I will stay in this hotel next time I come to Yangshuo.

msg:I took a three-day trip to Guilin with my baby and arranged two hotels, each of which did not disappoint me. Trance Hotel is the most relaxing one. The environment of the hotel is very good, the surrounding landscape is nothing to say, and it is much quieter than the classic scenic spots on the Lijiang River. If you have enough time, I really want to stay here for a few days~ The room is also relatively large, the facilities are relatively new, the cleaning is timely, and it is returned every day Update the fruit drinks in the room. Afternoon tea is also exquisite. What my baby likes most is the infinity pool and hot spring on the middle of the mountain. Soaking in it, you can see the mountains and waters outside, which is extremely relaxing. It is also my favorite, because it is the most popular, haha~ there is also the Banshan Cafe, which is definitely a plus for people like me who can’t live without coffee every day.
The hotel is very close to the Ten Mile Gallery, and it is only 5 minutes by car to the Big Banyan Tree. Going to Yinziyan is also a ticket booked by the hotel, and there are discounts~
Before leaving, I also gave a souvenir, which is the hotel I will go to again.

Looking at the mountain view, the coffee in the middle of the mountain is also very nice. The service of the hotel is very good, and the ladies at the front desk are also very enthusiastic , Lovely, the overall experience is five stars, the room has floor heating, it is very warm, and the supporting facilities are all expensive hotels.

We chose the Internet celebrity terrace room, because we brought our parents and children, and everyone wanted to live in the same room. We didn’t want to choose a parent-child room. I didn't expect the room to be super big. We added an extra bed and there was enough room for activities. There are also children's books in the room, which is very considerate. The online celebrity swimming pool is also very beautiful, with a beautiful environment. My parents said the water quality is very clean, and I would go to play every day ;Finally, the service of the hotel is very good. They help to pick up and drop off to West Street and arrange a car to pick up and drop off attractions and high-speed rail stations. The experience of staying is great

msg:I left the Daze Hotel reluctantly. The following aspects of the hotel left a good impression on me:
1. The enthusiasm of the hotel staff: When checking in/out, a young guy at the front desk of the hotel took the initiative to help with the luggage. I would like to commend him for his initiative! When we arrived at the guest room, the cleaning of the room was just finished. When I saw the room attendant, I could also say hello warmly and introduce the room equipment to us.
2. The hotel's swimming pool and other facilities are very relaxing and relaxing facilities. We also deliberately set aside a whole day of free time, not arranging sightseeing tours, and used it to soak in swimming pools and hotels. Looking back now, I am very pleased with this decision.
3. The hotel can arrange a free car service. We went to a restaurant that was farther away than the eternal love, and the hotel driver was able to send us to another place without complaint.
4. The quality of the coffee at the top of the hotel is good. At first, I didn't expect to drink professional coffee here. When I saw that the latte had latte and the taste was very good, I was full of surprises.

Small suggestion: There is no commissary. After 10 pm, if you are suddenly hungry or greedy, you will not be able to solve this problem.

msg:The appearance of the hotel looks good, the environment is good, and the area is large.
Comments on the guest room: I booked a parent-child room of 80 square meters. When I went to the site, I saw that it was a standard room of about 50 square meters. There was only a small courtyard. The weather is so hot, and the small courtyard cannot be used for people. Moreover, the privacy of the guest rooms is poor, standing on the first floor, you can see all the rooms on the whole floor. The room we were given was on the first floor, and the sound insulation was extremely poor. It was next to the elevator at the entrance, and the guests who came back many nights talked in their ears. The people upstairs walked a little heavier like an earthquake. I didn't sleep well for several nights in a row.
Comment on Afternoon Tea: No Worse! I just moved in, and I was full of hope to taste it. I found that there were only two or three types of cakes and egg rolls from the small supermarket. The tea was all cold and I couldn't eat a bite.
Comments on the restaurant: There is only a very small restaurant in the huge hotel, where you can eat everything. From the first afternoon tea, I saw a few flies flying when I went in, and it was still there every time after that; the restaurant was connected to the kitchen and added The sun is in the west, and the temperature is always high. Eating in it has always been a sauna; the most exaggerated thing is that a guest brought a pet dog in for breakfast, and the restaurant didn't care, and the dog kept running around in the crowded crowd!
Summary: I just experienced the farmhouse at the price of a five-star hotel, stepped on the big thunder, and couldn't complain!

In this weather, the air conditioner is turned off, and the balcony door is too hot to sleep. There is also a temple nearby that sets off fireworks at 6 am! Can't stand it! ! The important thing is the price. I'm sorry that the price/performance ratio of hot spring hotels is too low. The hot spring pools are small, and there are only 6 of them. There are no facilities for children! It's really not attractive to soak once more! The 5-star praise is really evaluated with conscience! ! The breakfast buffet is delicious! But the hot spring hotel close to 1000 has such facilities, there will be no second time!

When I come again this time, I finally experienced the full body of being in a daze! There is nothing to say about sanitation. I watched an aunt wipe a piece of glass for fifteen minutes. The environment is across a dam. As for the service, the full score of 5 points should be given at least 7 points. It is caring and not deliberate. It just makes you feel that everyone is proud of their hotel, and every staff member treats the place where they work as if it is their own. In terms of that feeling and facilities, I dare say their swimming pool is invincible! The whole Guilin is invincible! If you want to talk about shortcomings, when you go next time, if the heaviest dumbbell in your gym is still 10kg, I will give a bad review. Get me on the bench press! On Smith! All right? !

I personally feel that the room type of the big bed room is better than the courtyard room.

msg:Daze Hotel is one of my carefully selected hotels. Last year, the trip was cancelled due to the epidemic. This year, my children couldn’t wait to come to Yangshuo, Guilin, as soon as they were on vacation. This hotel did not disappoint me. The family room we booked has two rooms inside and outside, the inner room is a double bed room, and the outer room is a twin room plus a sofa and a desk. The room is very large. The two rooms inside and outside are estimated to be 80 to 90 square meters. Our two children are very spacious. The decoration is tasteful but not complicated, the bedding is very good, the bathroom and toiletries are well equipped and attentive, the hair dryer is from Xiaomi, and it feels good to use. Breakfast is a set menu when there are few people, and a buffet when there are many people. The only downside is that there is no juice, the child complains a little. Hygiene is good. Finally, let's talk about the Internet celebrity hanging swimming pool, which is very good. The children had a great time, and the adults couldn't help but go into the water to feel the comfort of soaking in the water and watching the beautiful scenery. However, the water is not very clear, I hope to increase the frequency of water changes. The pictures of the interior of the hotel room are omitted, basically the same as those on Ctrip, what you see is what you get. Put the view from the swimming pool and the exterior of the hotel when you first arrive at the hotel.

The hotel hardware facilities are relatively good, electric curtains, electric toilets, large and comfortable beds and rooms, the front desk is friendly, and the tea table in the lobby is also very good. Comfortable, clean bedding, close to Ruyi Peak, Moon Mountain, Yulong River rafting, and Shili Gallery attractions, which is an advantage. Disadvantages: To drive to the hotel, you have to pass through a new and old cemetery without street lights 🥹... embarrassing 😅 You know when you go out 😂 In addition, the hotel breakfast is quite light, there is no choice, you can only say that you are full, and the chef orders dinner I can't praise the level, and there are no restaurants around. If you want to eat better, you have to drive through the dark road, which is rather depressing.

🚗Location: The hotel is located at the archway at the end of Shili Gallery, 15 to 20 minutes' drive from West Street (the hotel is equipped with a private car once a day).
⚙️Hotel facilities: The hotel is designed with a new Chinese style, and the decoration is clean. There are main building and annex building plus four private villas, each building has 3 floors, and the number of residents on each floor is limited, which can ensure guests' quiet and leisure. The supporting facilities and facilities are absolutely daring It's a star hotel, why do you say that? There are a few details that really caught my heart: the elevator German Schneider, the smart toilet (every time I sit on the butt is warm), the bathroom has a warm bottom, and the ventilation is Panasonic Exhaust fans, bathing equipment, in addition to the basic accessories, the highlight is a loofah bathroom wipe. These details are well received. The hotel entertainment facilities include a gym (the equipment is very new), a children's playground, a viewing area, a tea area, a restaurant, like Swimming friends can go to the private villa to swim, and the hotel is also rushing to build an infinity pool, which is expected to be completed on National Day!
🍗Restaurant food: The hotel has a restaurant. Check-in has a breakfast buffet, free afternoon tea, and a local special drink osmanthus tea that is continuously available from day to night. But to be fair, the food should be remarkable, If you are looking for super invincible food, you may find food outside, but for me, the restaurant's service and products are acceptable.
🧑🏻‍💼Hotel services: We are definitely worried about hotel services when we travel. The staff in this hotel are smiling and hospitable. We sometimes go for lunch after a little bit, and the restaurant staff will also warmly entertain you The front desk also took the initiative to get in touch with us the day before our check-in. So the check-in for a few days is quite satisfactory.

Overall, the price is high and I am very satisfied, my friends are rushing!

Location: Along the Shili Long Corridor, Yangshuo is so big anyway, the scenery outside the window is really beautiful. Didi is very convenient.
Hygiene: clean and bright, it can be seen that the hotel management is still very serious.
Service: We booked for three nights, but the itinerary was temporarily changed. After negotiating with the front desk, we cancelled one night soon.
Meals: Breakfast is ok, normal four-star level. The content of the afternoon tea is also good.
Facilities: Gym Children's playground
The point is here. There is still room for upgrading in the later stage of the hotel, especially in terms of service, which can be refined. I feel that the staff training is still not in place. After staying for a few days, I found a hot spring pool on the mountain, facing the Yulong River. Soaking in the hot springs in the forests of Yangshuo must be good. Hope to have the opportunity to take the children to visit the old place again.

Except for the location a little bit and the breakfast quality is average, the others are absolutely unique. The hotel room is big enough, the overall environment is refreshing and comfortable, and the smart home is touching. The key is that the children's toiletries prepared for children are really good, okay? Moreover, the hotel staff are very enthusiastic, proactively contact and take the initiative to carry luggage.

Close to the room rate of 1600, take the luggage yourself
Checked in at about 16:30 that day, the self-service afternoon tea time was over, no more, and I offered two cups of milk and a small plate of biscuits. This was a good comment.
Welcome fruits: an apple, two sour oranges, a few winter dates
Breakfast: There were enough guests staying that day, and a buffet breakfast was opened, but the category was single and there was nothing to eat🙀
Facilities: The signal is only one bar poor. Wi-Fi can't be connected after a long time. The floor lamp on the balcony seems to be broken. Anyway, it doesn't light up. The ceiling fan in the bedroom seems to be a decoration and cannot be turned.
Meals: I had a meal in the restaurant that evening and ordered a farm chicken that is said to be killed for 188 yuan. I chose the white cut method. Maybe the hotel is afraid that I will cook thoroughly for diarrhea, and there will be a trace of bones between the bones. I don’t know why the chicken skin is full of transparent long fluff. This is not clean. I can only eat while plucking the hair. It is very outrageous. The pictures I took are not very visible, but they look very good under the light. Obviously, there is fluff on every piece of chicken skin
Summary: The house is quite new, nothing is wrong, it is a very new homestay, but the 270-degree view close to 1600 is not good, and it won't be a second time.

The beer fish is delicious, the restaurant is not expensive, and afternoon tea is provided. My husband likes to go for a ride on the hotel’s eDonkey, a great holiday experience. Although the surrounding attractions are average, the hotel’s accommodation experience is really good. The swimming pool hidden in the villa actually cleverly used the pattern to block the sun and explode! Great!

The overall evaluation is not bad. The hotel has upgraded the rooms for free, and the overall operating capacity of the hotel can be further improved to a five-star rating.

Room Facilities
The room facilities are hygienic, and overall they are quite good. They are Japanese style. Because they are of the single-family small apar**ent and villa type, the rooms are relatively airy and tasteless, and the facilities are relatively new but I feel that the customers are not the same. Many, it should have been a long time without people living in it.
breakfast:
The room we bought included breakfast. Breakfast was on the 1st floor of the lobby. Since we are in the off-season, there are not many pedestrians. It feels that Guilin is full of beautiful mountains, rivers and beautiful scenery.

It’s just that the location of the hotel is too biased. If you want to go out, it’s not very convenient. I rented an electric bike for 70 a day, and then I only rode for an hour without refund. It’s too bad, and the price can also be rented to others The environment is better.

After I changed my schedule and contacted the hotel, the hotel changed the check-in time for free. The service is very good 😊, and WeChat was added in advance. The hotel also provides free pick-up and drop-off service once a day during the stay, full of sincerity. Consider travel issues from the perspective of residents. The hotel is located in a small village in the Yulong River Scenic Area, with relatively high privacy. Quiet and the surrounding environment is super nice. It’s a good view when you open your eyes 😄. The hotel room layout and hardware facilities are very complete, the newly opened hotel, it is really good to be like this. Hope to maintain and continue to improve service quality. The hotel's price and service performance-price ratio are still very high. During the stay, due to my carelessness and lost the necklace, the hotel also helped to find and send it back. Thank you very much! recommend! If you suggest, feel that the restaurant can provide more dishes for guests to choose from.

環境很好離縣城有些距離，還好打車20元左右；
酒店也會盡量安排酒店的車滿足住客出行需要。
泳池是亮點。服務很周到
題外話：陽朔的啤酒魚不推薦，價格很貴（一百多一斤，一條魚300+RMB），後來聽説有旅客/普通，兩個菜單。
