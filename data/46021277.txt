msg:I didn't expect Hangzhou in December to still look like autumnüçÇ
This time I stayed at Hangzhou's top luxury hotel Vallie. The hotel in the mountains was as dreamy as a fairy tale‚ú®
The hotel is located by the Qiantang River and in the Liuhe Pagoda scenic area. There are only eight rooms in total. We made an appoin**ent for afternoon tea that day‚òïÔ∏è. The front desk lady will drive us to the restaurant in a small car. This path is very suitable for walking. The autumn colors are very strong and super beautiful!
The restaurantüà∂Ô∏è has a small garden, which is very photogenic‚úåüèªThe long table is full of autumn flowersüíêIt's really comfortable to bask in the sun and enjoy the beauty of this mountain alone!

The salty snacks for afternoon tea are all top-quality ingredients, foie gras, oysters, caviar, sea urchin, cheese, good-looking, good quality, and just the right taste! Each dessert is very exquisite, whether you are a salty party or a sweet party, you can find what you love!

After afternoon tea, we can check in at around 3 o'clock. We live in a room on the second floor. The overall decoration of the room is Chinese style. There is no TV. The Mini bar is full of drinks. The oversized bathtub is equipped with bath balls and bubble bath gel, as well as disposable bathtub covers. All toiletries are Bulgari, and the toothpaste is also Italian Marvis. The B&O audio Bluetooth connects to the phone, and the sound quality is very good. Put some lazy French chansons, shake the champagne in your hand, time flies, and relax! 

I like the bathrobes and slippers of this hotel very much. They are soft and comfortable. The bathrobes also have small hats, and the soles of the slippers are also thick. I really feel at home! There are also two sinks, which does not prevent two people from using them at the same time! 
The next day's breakfast has two options: Chinese and Western. The hotel's tea is delicious. The Chinese breakfast üà∂Ô∏è has various snacks and porridge. Drinking a bowl of hot porridge in the morning in winter warms the stomach and makes people feel energetic! Western-style pasta has two flavors üçù I chose Benedict eggs with ham, which is very good! Delicate and delicious~‚òïÔ∏è

After breakfast, I walked back to the room. The scenery along the way was so beautiful. The colors of the mountains in late autumn were distinct. The red maple leaves fell on the surface of the stream and floated slowly with the water. It was so beautiful that the camera couldn't capture one tenth of the beauty! The beautiful scenery seen with the eyes is engraved in the memory. This is the meaning of life!

msg:Suddenly I want to find a place to relax myself, do nothing, think about nothing, just lie down quietly, not reply to messages, not work, find a comfortable place to sleep until I wake up naturally... I lay there for two days, and then Work hard!
then! On the recommendation of a friend, I found a Hangzhou Vallie Hotel located on the south side of West Lake in Hangzhou, 20 minutes away from the city center, and next to the Liuhe Pagoda Park next to the Qianjiang First Bridge ~ This hotel is the one I clicked on the picture from I fell in love immediately... He almost fulfilled all my imagination!
It is worth noting that the hotel is located in a tea field next to the trail. There are four courtyards in total, each of which is surrounded by towering old trees. When you look up, you can see the trees and when you look down, you can see the flowers. The white walls and black tiles are really suitable for people like me who want to place themselves. For those of you who want to be empty, you are completely silent in the clear water and green mountains ~
By the way, the temperature in Hangzhou happened to be cooling down and it started to rain a little on the day I booked. The housekeeper was very considerate, from picking me up to check in, to getting me a free upgrade to a courtyard with a private pool because the regular room I booked had not been disinfected. Room ~ I really never thought about soaking in a hot spring alone, using the speakers in the hotel room to play my favorite melodyüé∂Looking at the drizzle and smoke in the mountains, I picked up the free red wine from the minibar, that moment... I seem to have let go of all the fatigue and stress of life, and just want time to freeze there... (Everything you can see in the minibar is provided for free)
As for the daily necessities in the hotel, I took a look at them, including a full set of Bvlgari supplies, a Dyson hair dryer, and a big-name stereo. Because I‚Äôm not digitally savvy, so‚Ä¶ I can only say it‚Äôs big-name, haha, there are many more‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶I won‚Äôt say it anymore, because I only saw the facilities provided by top luxury hotels, and I can‚Äôt name many brands.
correct! Be sure to go to the hotel's supporting restaurant, which is also in the valley. It's called "Nineteen by the Creek". I searched it and it was probably French cuisine. I don't like seafood, so I just ordered a drink and sat there in a daze~ But Because of my Internet work, I haven‚Äôt seen the daylight for a long time, so it‚Äôs a great experience~
And there‚Äôs more! I didn't want to take pictures at first, but after I came here, my mood completely changed, so I grabbed the housekeeper and took pictures for me! The housekeeper is really considerate and cooperative! And it‚Äôs beautifully shot! Thumbs up for the service (I was in a hurry to leave and forgot to ask the housekeeper‚Äôs name, otherwise I would have praised it to death)

The price personally thinks that 3000 is reasonable; 5000+ needs more and has not been achieved. The shower bag provided has expired~

The design of the hotel is also beautiful, small and beautiful. All the toiletries in the room are the same as Bulgari. The only downside was that the stools in the bathroom were wobbly, probably due to uneven bottoms. The rest of the experience is very good and very satisfied!
Picture 1 is the small courtyard of the room; Picture 2 is the yard viewed from the dressing table; Picture 3 is the food table; Picture 4 is the room (taken very casually); Picture 5 is the sofa area (still shot very casually); Picture 6 is the breakfast, which is also very good.

msg:As a B&B hotel, Vallie‚Äôs supporting facilities are relatively simple, but the food is still good. I strongly recommend M7 small row, 5 mature just right! The butler service is attentive and thoughtful, one of the biggest advantages of the hotel. Deep in the mountains and canyons, surrounded by trees, it is normal to have many mosquitoes. The housekeepers have arranged various mosquito killers in advance. Mosquito coils, mosquito mist and cooling oil are all available. You don‚Äôt have to worry too much outdoors and indoors. All the birds chirped together, high and low, very melodious. Occasionally, there was the bell of the Buddhist temple, which greatly relaxed the body and mind. Overall good! Personally, I would like to suggest that the outdoors of the room should be cleaned more, and the work between floors should be light as much as possible. Most of my friends are on vacation, so it is very important to relax. The last point is the regular cleaning and maintenance of the glass roof of the restaurant. Cleanliness and sanitation are a must for high-end restaurants. I hope that the next time you come to Vallie, it will become more attractive and pleasing to the eye. ü§ò

The restaurant is very suitable for people like us who eat more and get fat, and the food is exquisite!

I can‚Äôt bear to ask the butler from the cold and ask the warmth. The butler has been helping me with the strategy after leaving the hotel. I love it so much. I really want to play with the butler.

The breakfast is very delicious, so delicious that you want to lick the plate. The 135-square-meter executive courtyard suite feels not as large as expected. It may be that the area of the yard is included. It feels that the interior is only about 60 square meters. There is no TV. It is a resort and health hotel. The water source is spring water from Hupao Spring. The private heated pool is also spring water. Drinking at the mini bar is free. Sparkling wine, red, and white wine are free, and they will be replenished the next day. That's so cool! In short, it was a great experience.

The breakfast is quite generous and the restaurant is also suitable for taking pictures. Because there are a lot of insects on the mountain, I have been bitten by many packets, not mosquitoes, which are very poisonous insects. I plan to see a doctor today. The service is very good, but the hardware feels sorry for the price. I personally feel that I have stayed in so many hotels. More than 2000 nights will be more in line with the current configuration, quality, and more pertinent argument.
