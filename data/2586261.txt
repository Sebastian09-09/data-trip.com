msg:A truely awesome hotel smack bang in the middle of town. It looks brand new, everything really clean and staff are awesome. The room we had was really large decorated in western style, with amazing view of the swimming pool and the simatai great wall. The bed was large and extremely comfortable. The bathroom was also huge with two sinks and separate cubicles for the toilet, bath tub and separate shower. Both room and toilet were immaculately clean.

Breakfast was included as standard and was buffet with both Chinese and western options, just asweosme.

You can get free shuttle from the car park to the tourist information centre where you can check in to the hotel, and then get on another free shuttle to the hotel. You can of course walk, takes about 20 mins from the tourist information centre. There is also free luggage delivery service to and from the hotel from the car park which is super convenient.

Staying at the hotel means you get free entrance to Gubei water town, so you don't need to buy a separate ticket for that. There is also free entrance to the natural springs / spa included with the hotel stay. You will need to buy a separate ticket to visit simatai great wall though, however you do get a discount if you wish to join the night tour of the great wall.

msg:Before the summer vacation begins, I hurried to stay in the ancient town for two days. It was my first time staying in the ancient town. It was much more convenient than outside. I could quickly return to the hotel to rest when I was tired. I had stayed at the Ancient Town Hotel before, but this was my first time staying at William. The gate was a courtyard-style. The front desk was at the main room after entering. I had checked in at the visitor center, so I could directly collect the room card at the hotel front desk. The staff would give some warm reminders, and then the staff would take me to the room. After entering, there was a different world. It was a retro European style, a bit like a Disney mansion. It was quite unexpected that the room was upgraded. The view was facing the swimming pool and the street and river views. Although there were not many breakfast options, it was rich enough. When I left, it was raining and the staff took me outside. The meticulous and thoughtful service was really great, and every staff member felt very warm. Gubei Water Town is worth visiting more times

[Warm little details]: I forgot to take away a pair of socks that I washed and dried on the balcony. Two days later, I asked with a try mentality. The staff carefully packed them in a clean plastic bag and made a note, and delivered them to me immediately. I was really touched!

msg:The hotel room is very clean, the service is also very good, the food in the Chinese restaurant is a surprise, although the breakfast variety is not particularly large, but the food is fresh and tastes good. The hotel is very conveniently located, and the view on the balcony of room 316 is superb. The only drawback is that the design of the bathroom is not very convenient to use. For example, there is no place to put the mobile phone in the toilet area, and there is no wastebasket next to the sink. You have to go to the toilet area or the living room to throw paper. The place where the bath towel is hung is too far from the shower area. In the spring when it is still warm and cold, I was frozen to death when I walked over to get the bath towel after taking a shower. I hope the store can make adjus**ents as appropriate to better improve the guest's living experience.
In addition, the bathroom next to the hotel's Chinese restaurant is designed in a very stylish way, a bit like the bathroom in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As a little Harry Potter fan, my daughter likes it very much!

As a result, we wanted to check out early on the third day because of something else. We submitted applications three times but were rejected. We communicated with the front desk. The front desk only said that the network depar**ent was responsible for early check-out applications. Even if there was a price difference, we could still choose to accept a smaller refund. This kind of refusal to communicate and blunt behavior of not allowing check-out really gave us a very bad experience. I dare not book William Edgar again next time.

The hotel is very close to the parking lot and you cannot see the night view. When I checked in, I saw someone from Ctrip had upgraded it for free. I thought that if the room type was not good, I would have to pay more for an upgrade. When I arrived and looked at the room, I felt that it was too blocked. I wanted to pay more to upgrade. The third floor only has a luxurious king bed and it is not in the middle. The bedroom is not as big as this, but fortunately it is not blocked. At that time, I saw the price difference of more than 300 and wanted to upgrade. The front desk said that the price set by Ctrip was different and I could not click Ctrip. I had to call Ctrip to pay for the upgrade. I was kind enough to let the customer stay for the first time and then replenish it, but the front desk didn't want to and had to reply to me half an hour later. I wanted to say that if we upgrade to the original room, we won't move. Later, the front desk called me and said that I would add 500. I didn't agree to wait for Ctrip to call and said that the negotiation hadn't been finalized. We thought about it and asked one night. It happened to be more than 60 yuan cheaper than when I paid. Can I pay the difference? Ctrip was very helpful and said that they would pay the difference before checking out. I gave this to Ctrip on the dayüëç. The hotel facilities are okay and some software needs to be changed. For example, the refrigerator is very loud. At night, we just closed the electric door. The bathroom door swayed and it felt like it was going to be lost. Breakfast was pretty good.

There is a big tree in front of the terrace, so the view from the front is blocked, but you can see the Great Wall from the side! The room is very large, the bedding is very comfortable, and it's quiet at night. If you want to take a hot spring bath, it is recommended to ask the hotel in advance how to make a reservation. Duanjia hot spring is closed and only Yudachi is open. I checked in at four o'clock and made a reservation for the hot springs. However, the evening time slots were all full, so I could only go for a bath tomorrow morning.

msg:It was my first time to come to Shuizhen. I made a comprehensive choice and booked William. After arriving at the hotel, the front desk informed me that the room was directly upgraded to a balcony view room. The apar**ent layout is very good, with good lighting and good scenery. (It's just that the air conditioner doesn't work very well. It's a bit cold at night this season, and there's really no warm air at all.) The hotel is in a good location. I'd like to call it the No. 1 scenic spot. When you go out, turn right 100 and take the shuttle bus directly. You can go wherever you want. This is very convenient, because there is no supermarket in the scenic area, and you need to go to Lawson outside to buy things. There is no shuttle bus and it only takes 5 minutes to walk out. Everything else is good. It's just the air conditioning that's a bit of a fly in the oin**ent. Hope the hotel can improve

The hotel environment is good, the German food is delicious, the service is good, and the room is comfortable. It was really fun for the kids to watch the drones in the hotel since it was not convenient to go out at night.

The stool is not big enough to reach the end, and the water does not come out from the front, so it can't be flushed at all. I flushed it more than 20 times in the morning, and my husband flushed it more than 20 times in the evening. Sometimes it really doesn't work and we have to use mineral water bottles to flush. I am embarrassed to ask the waiter to flush it, it's really unbearable. The room is designed like a maze, the experience is really bad, even worse than those small inns.

msg:After comparing at the entrance of Water Town, it was cheaper to book on Ctrip. I wanted to book Wangjinglou Hotel (mainly because it was cheaper than this one), but I was told that it was not open, so I booked this hotel. The room I booked at the entrance could see the Great Wall and the church on the top of the mountain. When I arrived at the hotel, the front desk said that there was another room facing the water town that was better than the one I booked. I followed her suggestion and changed it. The front desk had a sincere look and a good attitude, and delivered it to the room. There are fruits in the room, which feels pretty good. There are four bottles of water in the room. If you don‚Äôt have enough, you can still ask for it. Going up to the balcony, because my room is recessed, the view is somewhat blocked by the wall of the next room, and the view is limited.
I went out for a walk and felt tired, so I came back to take a rest. As soon as I lay down for a while, I saw a small black hard-shelled insect crawling on the pillow. I got startled and beat it to death. Then I thought about it, maybe there are normal rooms with balconies. Those who come in and out may also bring in such little creatures.
There are various performances in the Water Town Square, including singing, acrobatics, musical fountain performances, and drone performances at night. There are quite a lot of activities. The houses in Water Town are also quite beautiful and very unique, especially when the lights are turned on at night. nice. Unfortunately, it is still a bit cold now, the trees have not sprouted, the flowers have not bloomed, and the cruise ships have not started operating. The advantage is that it is very quiet and you can enjoy it slowly.
When I came back in the evening, there was a midnight snack (a few small cookies) in the room, which was delicious. After turning off the lights when I went to sleep, I found that the closet door was not closed tightly. The lights inside always went out and then turned back on immediately. Coupled with the strong wind outside, it was a bit scary, and I always felt like someone was there.
Because there are not many people going now, we can't make a buffet breakfast. Breakfast is delivered to the room. There are Chinese and Western options, which is quite rich.
The food in Shuizhen is a bit expensive, a meat bun is RMB 18, and a bowl of beef brisket rice noodles is RMB 68, but after all, it is in Shuizhen, so it is normal.

I didn‚Äôt understand the origin of William Edgar‚Äôs name at first, so I was very hesitant. I saw a sign with green characters on a white background. The door is standing uncoordinatedly, and I'm worried that it's a hotel-style hotel. But as soon as I entered the hotel, I began to be surprised. It was an antique courtyard house, the interior decoration was in European style, the environment was more beautiful than the photos, and the hotel upgraded the rooms. The rooms are spacious, quiet and comfortable. When checking out, the child reluctantly said that he would stay in this room next time. We agreed to come back in 3 months~
(Popular science: William Edgar Gallo, an American traveler and member of the Royal Geographical Society in the early 20th century, interviewed officials and people along the route in China, carefully collected local documents, and recorded a large number of notes, which provided a basis for the development of the Great Wall of China and Chinese culture. He has made important contributions to international communication. This hotel is named after him.) Everyone can book with confidence and hope that William Edgar will get better and better~

The small balcony is small, but you can watch the drone show, which is great. The breakfast is good, the plate is warm, and the butter is not hard. The service is also very good, warm, professional and polite. Two capsules of coffee are free every day, and four bottles of farmer are also given away. The luggage check in the scenic spot is very good and convenient, so you don't have to worry about it. The swimming pool is estimated to be repaired next month, so you can look forward to it. In short, although the price is a little expensive, it feels worthwhile and worth going again.

4. I went there two days before 5.1. I didn‚Äôt have anything, and I came out hungry. It‚Äôs scary that there‚Äôs no one in the scenic spot during the day. The food sellers are also closed. It is good to take pictures when the lights are on at night, and only have some snacks one after another.
5. I think the stir-fried dishes in the restaurants are average, and the prices are not low.
6. In the entire scenic area, there is a drone show at 8:00 pm, which is very interesting, and the others are really boring. It's a place of leisure.

msg:William is really nice. It is the third time to live in their house in Gubei Water Town for the first time. I lived in Gubei Light once before, but I think William is better. We were originally a superior double room with balcony, but because it was fully booked, Ctrip upgraded us to a deluxe room for free.
It's nice to have a bath. Although a hot spring ticket is provided, the daughter-in-law is pregnant, so I can't feel unhygienic. It is also very comfortable to use the bathtub in the room directly. The best thing is the balcony, the night view, making a cup of tea, and seeing the Kongming Lantern drone performance directly. During the day, you can still hear the sound of Peking Opera on the big stage.
It is highly recommended, we should live in 316, the balcony angle is very good. The picture is the night view from the balcony. The video was originally recorded for a long time, and it can only be uploaded in 30s. The pixels are not good, but it is still very clear when watching the light show. I feel that the angle of our 316 balcony is very good.
And don't buy the mutton skewers in the food street! ! Unappetizing! 25 a bunch, not tasty. William and his family's master chef grilled skewers over a charcoal fire at the entrance of the hotel. 28. Although a bunch is three yuan more expensive, the taste is much better than those in the food street! !

The hotel's breakfast is not bad, with Chinese and Western hot and cold choices; the hotel's own Western restaurant is very popular, and the roast pork knuckle, big sausage, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes are all delicious.
The location of the hotel is convenient for travel. The shuttle bus will arrive at the first stop. The first hotel downhill is the hotel. The Chinese-style gate does not show the mountains and dews from the outside, and the space for entering the courtyard is getting bigger and bigger.

After taking the cable car up the mountain, I accidentally sprained my ankle on the way to Simatai Guanhuo Tower. The children helped me to get off the cable car with difficulty. At that place, after the staff of the scenic spot learned about the situation, they immediately started the baton service. The shuttle bus was ready before the cable car arrived. Seeing that I was having trouble walking down the steps, Dai Xiaoyong couldn't help but carry me on his back, and walked down three flights of steps again. After walking a long distance, he carried me to the car and accompanied me in the car. He carried me from the car and took me to the infirmary. My weight of more than 120 kilograms rested on Xiaoyong‚Äôs body, which warmed my heart. His actions touched me. As a family, we wanted to express our feelings, and Xiaoyong said that this is what we should do without taking any money. The William Hotel we stayed at was also very helpful. Four young men lifted the wheelchair up the steps and took me into the room. The waiter brought ice cubes in advance. My misfortune today made me fortunate to experience the excellent service in Cuba Water Town! Feel the warmth and beauty of the world! I would like to sincerely thank Mr. Dai Xiaoyong! Thanks to everyone involved in helping me!

msg:The imperial house where I lived with my parents last time, Japanese style with private soup. This time with only two roommates, I chose William. Experience a different style. It's a sensible choice for the price! Friends who come to Gubei, strongly recommend!
üå∏ Room facilities:
My basic requirements for accommodation: 1. Clean 2. Large room. William is very fit. The room area is about 55 square meters, the bed and bathroom are very clean. There is also a sofa seating area. The bathroom is super large and bright, with good ventilation and light. There is also a small cloakroom. The functional division of the entire area is very clear and not cramped. The capsule coffee was sent, and the taste was still good.
üå∏Location Traffic:
In the central location of Gubei Water Town, it is very convenient to go to the Great Wall, snack street, and hot springs. But it's very quiet at night, and it's definitely a quiet place in the middle of the noise!
üå∏Breakfast:
The breakfast is quite rich, and there are many kinds. Maybe because of the name of the hotel, it attracts many foreign tourists. Restocking is fast hahaha, almost no empty dishes.
üå∏ Swimming pool:
not open in winter
üå∏Services:
Very caring, and also very polite, will say hello when entering and leaving. After checking in, the front desk and the concierge also helped to carry the luggage upstairs. Almost the same as western hotel service.
üå∏ Value for money:
very high. First of all, I don't like the inn style in Gubei. They are cheaper, but the interior decoration is strange and strange. I can't accept the accommodation with colorful bed sheets. . . And stay at the hotel and get: Gubei tickets, hot spring tickets, night tour of the Great Wall cableway, 40 yuan per person, 30 yuan per person for massage in the hot spring hall (198 yuan to enjoy the discount).
üå∏tips:
The double bed booked is a little narrow, one meter wide. I hope this can be improved, after all, the room is big enough!

msg:Thousands of choices, I chose William myself, I didn't read the guide and didn't read the reviews üòÅ It turns out that it didn't disappoint us! It was the birthday of my teammates on the day of check-in. Special thanks to the front desk mm who was on duty around 12 o'clock that day. They helped us upgrade the room and arranged it silently. When I returned to the room at night, I found the third little surpriseüòú
    Personally, I think William is a small, but very boutique hotel. The room and bathroom are large, and the wet and dry separation of the bathroom does not affect each other. Although the room facilities are not very new, they are well maintained. I carefully observed the gaps. , all packed very clean!
   The sound insulation of the room is good, and the view of the balcony room is also good. Although the view is not wide enough due to the limited floor, it is facing the church on the top of the mountain, and you can see the ups and downs of the ancient town.
   The breakfast restaurant is very distinctive and the lighting is good! Breakfast is also more refined
  Overall, it's worth the price! Although it is not large, it has all the internal organs!

msg:Due to the epidemic, I was unable to go to Sanya this year. I took four elderly people on vacation in the suburbs of Beijing. It was very convenient to live in the scenic area. The elderly like to walk and simply climb mountains. The location of the hotel is very suitable;

Service quality: Check-in in scenic spots, shuttle bus and other services are good, which is actually quite rare in the north. It can be felt that the investor wants to make Gubei a five-star Beijing suburban resort, but when staying in a hotel, the door Tong was a little surprised when he saw that the old man carrying the suitcase up the steps did not help the first time, but he still hoped that the hotel training would be in place;

Cleanliness: Overall good, no obvious cleaning problems were found;

Catering level: Because there is still a lot of food in the scenic area, I did not choose to have dinner in the hotel, but the breakfast is also good;

On the whole, it is a good review, but I stayed at the Bay Half Mountain Hotel in Miyun in the next two days. Although the price is indeed half the difference, maybe the service standard of the bay is too high. In comparison, William is not outstanding, but I still thank the hotel. Reception, there will be opportunities to visit.

Not very enthusiastic and a little weird. When I was having breakfast in the restaurant, I was told to get up to get breakfast and have to wear a mask and sit down to eat before picking it! This is too funny. A breakfast restaurant is not very big, and it is less than 100 square meters. Do you have to wear a mask when you take the buffet? If you sit two meters away from the buffet, you don't need to wear a mask, otherwise, don't have a dine-in meal and pack it up one by one. Can't we go back to our room to eat by ourselves? Before leaving, I paid the room card and left again. I called back and said that there was a can of Coke and a Sprite missing in the refrigerator, and asked us to pay, but we didn't drink it. The waiter who brought our own drinks said that it was alright, so we just checked it out, quite speechless.

We discussed with the front desk that we can check out later, and finally said that we would delay it by half an hour at most. , The sanitation of the hotel is very average, the facilities are a bit old, the inside of the bathtub looks like it has been used by others and has not been cleaned, and there is mud. The good thing is that you can ask for mineral water, there is a baby cot, and at night, you will be given ice cubes, fruit knives and other guest rooms The service is also very good, but it is not humane enough. I hope that families with babies can be given more care and hygiene should be strengthened.

After you check in, you will be surprised to find that all the interiors and furniture have European retro style, which is very quiet and comfortable. The checked luggage is delivered to the room, and every service staff encountered greets and is very considerate and patient. Awesome! ! !

msg:I have been to Gubei Water Town many times, every time I choose a different hotel and try it out. This time I chose William, mainly because I can see the drone from the balcony of one of William's rooms. It was really amazing to live in, I really like the style of this courtyard. This time I went to the newly added kebabs at William's door, and it smelled very good. I ate it twice, and the second time because of the crowds, I said I would return to the room first and then come to fetch it. Unexpectedly, the hotel attendant delivered it directly. Very good attitude! At noon on the last day, I ate in the Chinese restaurant. The taste was good and the attitude of the service staff was good. Very happy staying this time, will come again next time

msg:The room is big enough, the service is great, and the swimming pool is great, mainly looking at the swimming pool. Breakfast is small but exquisite, and the location is very good. The most disappointing point is the uncomfortable bed, the superior twin room, the bed is very narrow! The quilt is also uncomfortable, and the height of the two beds is different. It should be the mattress. It is important to get a good night's sleep after a day of tiredness!

The scenery of the swimming pool room on the first floor is not that you can watch the drone show at night without going out.

The room is very large and you can directly see the swimming pool, the swimming pool is very good, and the breakfast is also a five-star standard.

When I was cleaning, I found that the guest had dropped something. Shouldn't I contact the hotel by phone? If you don't hit me, I'll look for you, but why are you so evasive?

msg:Drive for two and a half hours to the p1 parking lot and take the shuttle bus to the hotel to check in. The hotel service staff took the initiative to help take the luggage to the room, explain some matters, and have a good and enthusiastic attitude. The restaurant buffet breakfast is delicious. The location of the hotel is good and it is very convenient to take the shuttle bus! We are an old couple and a young couple who booked two rooms. The children stayed in a double room, and we stayed in a two-bed room. The children‚Äôs room was upgraded to a balcony room, which was great. On the balcony, below is the hotel swimming pool, looking up at the town scenery. We stayed in the innermost room at the back. The room was large and had poor visibility, and it was far away from the child's room. Just call the hotel first when making a reservation.

msg:Go to Gubei Water Town and climb the Simatai Great Wall. I feel that living in Water Town is the most suitable choice.
We took the Dongzhimen Gubei special line to Water Town. The luggage center opposite the parking lot went through the formalities. The luggage will be delivered to the hotel. Then we walked to the Water Town Service Center to check in. I took the admission ticket and entered the water town. Free shuttle battery car to the hotel site, get off the car and walk 20 meters to the hotel. The receptionist of the hotel is already waiting at the door. After getting the room card at the front desk, the waiter sent us to the room. He said that we would get lost if we walked on our own. Stayed for two nights and still bewildered. The luggage was delivered to the room after a while.
The room is very large, and you can see the small town, the cafe on the top of the mountain and the Great Wall in the distance from the window. There are three separate toilets and a bathtub. There is a small terrace next to the toilet, where you can open the door and go out to take pictures of the Great Wall. There is direct drinking water in the room. The water in the reservoir is filtered and then connected to the room. I am not used to drinking raw water. I still boiled it to drink. The water is quite sweet.
The hotel is located in the center of the water town, it is very convenient to go out, there are several bridges to go out, it is also the best location for taking pictures.
The breakfast is rich in variety, just choose according to your own taste.
There is an elevator in the hotel, but due to structural problems, there are still some steps. If you have any mobility problems, it is best to call and consult first.
Private cars are all parked in the parking lot outside the scenic area. In the water town, you can only walk by yourself or take a shuttle battery car.
I like this hotel very much and I will stay here if I get the chance!

msg:The name of the hotel has a story, you can go to Baidu, and there is also a small memorial in the story [naughty]! The water in the room adds a sense of agility, sitting in the small courtyard on the balcony and seeing the Simatai Great Wall! This is an important part of our trip for a happy and complete trip, the beautiful scenery of the ancient town during the day, and the comfort of staying at night [happy]. The bathroom is separated from washing, rinsing, defecation, and bathing. The design of the two-handed table is very intimate. The room feels more spacious than the 45 square meters I have lived in. It may be an extension of the design of the balcony courtyard [naughty]. In addition to the hardware, the service is also very good. The room includes a hot spring package. When you take your parents there, the driver of the battery car deliberately sends you an extra trip. The ring and charger are found in the end of the room. The hotel breakfast is also good, the ingredients are very fresh, in short, a very good experience~

Because Beijing is very hot recently, the little friends have been in the swimming pool ~ the service staff also helped to find the baby bathrobe ~

Western food for breakfast is delicious ~ Chinese food is a bit salty

This is the third time I have come to Gubei Water Town. I used to live in the big hotel at the entrance, and I will stay here in the future. It is much more convenient than staying at the entrance.
