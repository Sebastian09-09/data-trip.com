msg:Once in lifetime Hotel !!

I am staying in good hotels in many countries dozens of times a year.

The Mangrove Hotel here provides a pleasant and comfortable environment within an hour of check-in.

I don't say When you come to Sanya, you have to stay at this hotel.

You have to come to Sanya in order to stay at this hotel. I was at Mangrove Tree Resort World Sanya Bay (Buddha Tower).

msg:My Chinese is not good but I could enjoy the stay by the support of the staff who speaks English, named Perou. But basically most of visitors are Chinese so if you couldn't speak Chinese at all then the stay at Sanya will be tough. The view from the room was nice but until late night the Karaoke voice from the garden came into the room, since in the garden there are several restaurants or bars. Basically I satisfied the stay at this hotel. I think the restaurant out side of hotel is better.

The hotel itself is neither old nor modern, but its service and amenities were excellent to make our stay comfortable and memorable. The room was super spacious as my child enjoyed running and playing here and there, and the view of mangrove property from the balcony is "wow".  Many thanks to Ms Perou and intern Rohan, who took good care and concern for us, will definitely stay here if I come to Sanya again.

msg:Location wise is not bad. This hotel has 6 different buildings and has different names for each tower. Think they are eco green building and hence the hotel lobby and hotel room walkway there is no air con. Some parts of the hotel amenities are under renovation at this moment which I think they are getting ready for their upcoming china national holiday. The hotel room smells woody and old. No complaint for the price that we have paid. The food street is so ghostly and nothing to eat. The water park also very pathetic. A lot of water play is not open and so run down.

Thanks for the hard work everyone , I have nothing to complain about the hotel, but the guests due to the excellent price are not as good as the hotel or staff. I had excellent deal for one night and I stayed there due a flight cancelation. It is about 20 to 30 minutes to the airport . The water park in the complex is only worth if you get a package included in the stay. 

I didn‚Äôt try breakfast but the dinner buffet is not worth. 
There are some shops inside the complex such as Nike and Adidas and might be able to o find some good deals.

The Buddha Tower doesn‚Äôt have jacuzzi in the room , but for the price , it is fine.

Overall the buildings itself could use some maintenance. The resort is very spacious and the staff was friendly. Very little of the staff spoke English so often it was hard to communicate but we managed. It had a ton of newer technology in use which was cool but was a stark juxtaposition to some of the crumbling facilities. A good place to relax for a weekend getaway or to host a big event as long as you aren't looking for something top notch or close to the beach itself.

msg:Traveling on May Day, Mangrove Forest has a package without additional charges. I didn't have high expectations before coming, after all, there were too many negative reviews online. Overall, the three-day and two-night stay exceeded expectations.
I checked in on my birthday, and the front desk upgraded me to Queen Brown. The room and bed were larger, enough for two adults and two children. They also arranged for the bakery to make a cake and send it to the room.
I added the housekeeper hebe WeChat when checking in. The attitude was very good, the response was quick, and I was responsive. I must give it a five-star rating.
The room service staff were all very good and responsive. The only dissatisfaction was that I took Xiaobao to take a nap in the hotel, and I scanned the code to order the restaurant delivery service at the bedside of the hotel. As a result, it was refunded after more than 20 minutes, and there was no phone explanation. I couldn't order takeout when the child was sleeping, so I left the child to pick up the takeout by himself. It wasn't until my husband brought Dabao back from the water park at more than three o'clock that he helped me pack lunch and eat.
The Amazon Water Park is not big, but it also takes into account the needs of big and small children. Guests staying in the hotel can enter and exit unlimited times a day with a stamp.
The breakfast is generally good, with everything that should be there. The surprise is the pancakes/tofu brain (to take care of the northern stomach), the baoluo noodles and DIY qingbuliang are also delicious.
There are many restaurants in the park, which are more expensive than outside. I tried the Thai restaurant that was very popular online, and I was quite disappointed. This level is actually the best Thai food in Sanya? Personally, I think the environment and taste are not worthy of its price.
The travel photography included makeup and clothing. I didn‚Äôt pay attention to it. I took the photos in my own clothes. Only 3 negatives were given, and the effect was not bad! I spent money to buy a set meal. If I had makeup, it would be better.
I didn‚Äôt visit the outlet store, and there were not many people.
Overall, I feel that Mangrove Forest wants to do better. The service and catering should be strengthened. I hope it will get better and better. There will be a series next time.

Entry to Amazon Witter Park. Even the barcode for the Mangrove Tree craft beer was meticulously crafted, making it a very enjoyable trip for me as a foreigner.
I was very satisfied with the food at the gourmet street in the hotel and the shopping at the shopping street.

The lounge drinks and bread at the King and Queen Hotel were cheap and of high quality.
Any trip to Hainan will definitely involve mangroves.
I highly recommend it.

msg:I booked two nights and only stayed one night because I made a mistake. I was originally going to book a Mangrove Resort Hotel near the sea, but after searching, a hotel called Mangrove Water World popped up, so I gave up on the second night. , I went to stay in the Mangrove Forest, but the decoration and service of that hotel were far worse than this one. It was purely based on the location. It only had a good environment near the sea. The interior decoration was a mess. It didn‚Äôt look like a hotel worth 700. The 300 Bodhi Hotel is better than that. The interior is very spacious, the washbasin is also large, and the environment is good. The reception was warm when I checked in, and I was upgraded to a room type. God let me accidentally enter this hotel and gave me the right choice. But I don‚Äôt believe in evil, hahaha. When I went over, I looked like a clown.

The butler service is thoughtful. It is very convenient for shopping and eating. The water world facilities are OK, but the lifeguards are indifferent. They didn't help the guests who fell into the water on the big slide. Some guests and children have poor quality and deliberately splashed water on other people's faces. When I went to the bathroom, two swimming rings were stolen. In the end, I found that they were deliberately broken and floating in the surfing pool.

msg:For the second stop of the trip, we chose the mangrove forest, which everyone said would definitely be safe. I saw mixed reviews from everyone, so I didn‚Äôt have high hopes. Personally, it‚Äôs pretty good!
Lobby: It has a Thai feel, a sense of travel and vacation~
Front desk: Yoyo's service is very good, gentle and patient, she looked after the baby and upgraded the room
Room: relatively large, relatively clean at first sight.
The bed and table and sink are clean. As for what everyone said, there are indeed water spots on the bathroom glass, toilet seat, etc., I think it is acceptable, but it is difficult to wipe off~
The balcony can see the entire park, which is great. It is very comfortable to sit and enjoy the scenery. The children are very happy to see the big planes flying around.
Parent-child activities: There are hotel swimming pools, beach water parks, amusement parks, and a big night market. There are various restaurants nearby, the price is suitable and not expensive. After lunch, I went to Coconut Dream Corridor in the evening to eat Coconut Chicken. The main store has good service.
Everything can be solved without leaving the hotel.
At the Li's Restaurant at the door, there is a bite of pig and Northeastern cuisine, which is great!
Facilities: This shampoo, body wash, and hand soap, this bottle is so difficult to use. You can‚Äôt even buy this kind of difficult-to-use bottle as a gift now. Boss, please give it a try! The overall mangrove facilities are poorly maintained and indeed severely worn, and some public areas are in poor sanitation.
Overall, it is recommended to stay here, it is very convenient and comfortable inside. I ordered 1,300 for two days, which is fine for this season. Don‚Äôt judge whether it‚Äôs suitable or not during this peak season, üòÑ, happiness is the most important thing. Frugalness depends on the people, and there are many hotels to choose from. It's not far to take a taxi to various places.

msg:1. The hotel is located in the center of Sanya, with a strong commercial a**osphere and a wide range of dining options. Convenient, affordable, and the hotel meets five-star standards in all aspects.
Combined with the price before the Spring Festival. This price is already extremely cost-effective. (Ctrip machine + wine combined 800+), self-driving can park for free, but there will be traffic in the morning and evening when going out

2. There are no shortcomings in the breakfast, but there are no highlights either.

3. The room is very large and comfortable. The edge of the bathtub was a bit broken and the curtain on one side couldn't be closed. But the bathtub is really big and cool. The water comes out very quickly, and there is a huge balcony. It also comes with a special tool for cooling clothes. The soundproofing of the room is quite good. Although the sound of planes taking off and landing at Phoenix Airport is quite loud, it is fine after closing the glass door.

4. I don‚Äôt understand why there is no small table for mobile phones in the bathroom.

5. There don‚Äôt seem to be many children playing in the Amazon jungle. The third floor is an outdoor swimming pool. There is no constant temperature pool! In winter in Sanya, it is quite cold even when going to the sea at noon, and children can easily catch colds. We brought swimsuits but had no use for them.

The biggest feeling of staying here this year is that the hotel is more user-friendly, the breakfast variety is richer, and the Amazon Water Park is more lively than before, little brother The service attitude of the ladies is also very gentle, especially the housekeeper Hebe who is nice and considerate. The hotel also prepared fruits and drinks. The children were in tears when they left the hotel and were reluctant to leave. I hope that the mangrove forest will be upgraded and better soon, and will come again. .

Hebe, the housekeeper of Bodhi Hotel, is very beautiful and the service is also very good. She thought exactly what I thought...big üâêlike it
The Mangrove Hotel is very big. It‚Äôs really an old hotel. It has food, drinks, entertainment and shopping all in one. I did some shopping by the way...Haha, it‚Äôs so fun to shop in the hotel...
The water park is a bit old, but you can have fun without delay. It is recommended to wear beach shoes and socks, and be sure to wear sunscreen. I got sunburned within 3 hours, and my skin really hurts~
The commercial street, Mijie, and the unique restaurants inside are all very good...
Went to a craft brewery, 19.9 for 2 hours of all-you-can-drink, so affordable, and there were people singing too
You don‚Äôt have to go to tourist attractions when you come to Sanya. It‚Äôs not interesting. You can just stay in a hotel, especially if you are traveling with children.

It's okay to close the windows in the room, but don't leave them open, otherwise the sound of airplanes and helicopters passing by will be loud. The swimming pool downstairs was a bit cold, so you need to rent a swimming ring. Close to the food street. There is a takeaway counter for ordering takeout, which is also convenient.

Before I checked in, the customer relations beauty Feng Jiao called to inquire about the needs and arrange a baby cot. Let us who have not stayed here feel the warmth of being valued first. There are a total of 6 hotels in Mangrove. It is a small city and very large. I took a taxi to the wrong place and couldn't find the Bodhi Hotel. The housekeeper Fengjiao specially arranged a shuttle bus to pick me up. I chose the 21st and 22nd floors for check-in. The scenery on the high floors is really good. It's very good. It is recommended to choose the upper floors, where you can directly see the whole hotel. The room is large, very transparent, and very clean. It is very safe to stay with a baby. On the first day, we took a taxi to Coconut Dream Corridor to catch the sunset. It was beautiful and worth it. The next day, there was a water park 50 meters away from the hotel. After a quick day of fun, I was still not satisfied, so I decided to continue my stay. To extend my stay, just contact Fengjiao on WeChat. There is no need for cumbersome procedures, so that customer service can be as humane as possible. I have to leave tomorrow and will come again next time!

msg:We temporarily changed our itinerary and arrived at the mangrove forest. There seems to be a total of five hotels here, Bodhi, Kapok, King Palm, Queen Palm, Palm, and a coconut grove. I don‚Äôt know if it is a mangrove. The Palm is supposed to be a family-friendly hotel, and the rooms should be family-friendly, with some things to play and some family-friendly activities. Anyway, we made a temporary change and booked Bodhi directly, which is the cheapest here. Kapok is a little more expensive, but the rooms are different. But if we don‚Äôt stay in the house and go out to play every day, it doesn‚Äôt matter. More than 400 a night, the breakfast is very good, the Lingshui sour rice noodles are so delicious. It also includes a water park. If it rains outside, you can exchange tickets for the indoor park. The butler Tang Caimao arranged by Ctrip was very nice. He helped solve various problems and responded to messages in seconds. They also upgraded us for free and provided free late check-out on the last day. The service is amazing. The room service staff Hou Huali was very nice. When we came back from playing at noon on the last day, I went downstairs to get the meal and asked the child to wait for me in the room. As a result, the child couldn't find me, so I pulled Ms. Hou to accompany her, and Ms. Hou returned the fold. Two little rabbits. Thank you so much. This time, I was traveling alone with my five-year-old baby, and I met many good people along the way, which made traveling with my baby much easier. Looking forward to seeing you again next time you stay.

The service quickly delivered it to the room. I casually told the service staff that the bamboo skewer was pricked (used to pick bamboo skewers). ), and then the service staff also brought band-aids.

I have stayed in Queen Brown, King Brown Kapok, etc. The rooms are basically large and have small refrigerators. There are many kinds of breakfast. Except that there is no washing machine in the room, I am very satisfied! During the two days we spent in the resort, we only had a special car to go out to eat seafood for dinner. There were several swimming pools where you could play in the water, and we also went to the Mangrove Water World. There were several large slides that were quite fun, and there were not many people. The coconut ** in the resort has a good environment but is not very delicious. The taste is a bit different from that of Jinminfang.

The swimming pool and water world on the third floor are very fun! I have to mention the Yuelv photography in the hotel, the efficiency is high and the shooting effect is good, leaving a good memory for the trip~
There is also the hotel doorman, Xiao Meng, who is really enthusiastic. Every time I meet, I will take the initiative to say hello, ask if the car is coming, and help carry the luggage, thank you!

The water park is more suitable for children to play. We are children and we don‚Äôt like it. It is tall and scary, so there is nothing to play. Bring your own swimming ring, there are several restaurants downstairs for dinner, and there is a snack street that is very lively at night, and the hand-made lemon tea is delicious. There is nothing to do outside. The disadvantage is that it is not close to the sea. You have to take a taxi to go to the Coconut Dream Corridor. But the advantage of being far away from the sea is that there are no tides and no mosquitoes. Overall, I think it is okay. The room service attitude is very good and gentle , focusing on a cost-effective and large enough room!

When I arrived at the hotel, the concierge helped me open the door and take my luggage. Qimeng at the front desk checked me in. The little girl was very nice and helped me print out the materials I needed. Ms. Zitong at the front desk was also very helpful. The hotel park is very large, and the environmental and entertainment facilities are not bad. It is suitable for bringing children to play. The water sports have the same facilities as Atlantis Water World, such as octopus racing, small speakers and so on. There is a cobra slide that children like very much and have played several times. The size of the room is moderate, the balcony is large, and there is a clothes rack, which is very convenient. The shower has a strong flow and the water is relatively smooth. It may be due to design reasons, the water will partially overflow, and the floor will be a bit slippery. Floor towels will be much better. The overall stay experience is still very good.
The hotel is very close to the Sanya high-speed railway station, and it is very convenient to take a taxi. In short, I am satisfied

msg:The Mangrove Forest Bodhi Hotel is the most comfortable and cost-effective hotel for my self-driving tour around the island of Hainan Island. We booked a city view room, and the lady at the front desk helped us upgrade to a deluxe garden view room when we checked in. After checking in, I found that I really should book a room with a garden view. The tropical a**osphere outside the window is so beautiful! Figures 1-4 were all taken on the balcony. There is also a plate of welcome fruit upon check-in, including my favorite lotus mist, which makes me very happy.
The biggest feature of the room is that it is large and appropriate, and the layout is reasonable. The balcony is large, the room is large, the bathtub is large, and the washroom is also large, equipped with two washbasins. The most worth mentioning is that there is a hallway separating the room from the entrance of the room, which can accommodate two suitcases, and two people can open and sort the luggage at the same time, which is not cramped. There is also a separate cloakroom in the room, and a low stool is thoughtfully arranged for guests to sit and change shoes.
If there are any deficiencies, it is that the breakfast and dining environment is really not worthy of the brand "Mangrove". The buffet restaurant in the morning has insufficient air-conditioning and no windows, which makes the guest experience poor and boring. After eating in a hurry, they don't want to stay for an extra minute. It is really a fly in the oin**ent. Also, it would be nice to have body lotion in the room. Also, since it is called Bodhi Store, I didn't see a single Buddhist portrait or decoration in the lobby or in the room, which is a bit regrettable. I think it would be better if the painting that opened the door was replaced with a portrait of Buddha.
In short, the shortcomings do not conceal the advantages. If I come to Sanya next time, I am still very happy to live in the mangrove forest again.

msg:very disappointed hotel
This time, Sanya has arranged two hotels for seven days and six nights, one is in Yalong Bay Huayu, and the other is Mangrove Bodhi in Sanya Bay.
Mangrove Bodhi has read reviews and said it is a business hotel. After all, it is a big brand, and several hotels together are not much different. With the most affordable price, you can also experience the free water park and the hotel's swimming pool.
I didn't expect to feel disgusted from the moment I checked in...
First of all, the service attitude is very indifferent. I would like to praise the ladies who clean the guest rooms. They are not very enthusiastic, at least they are in a normal tone, and they are more polite. I would like to give a special compliment to the caretaker of the swimming pool. It should be the person on duty at 6.10. He was inflating us when he heard a child fall into the water and his mother called over there. He immediately threw his phone away and jumped off without hesitation. save people! Compared with the check-in at the front desk, it is really a mess! In the end, the child broke a mouthwash cup. The guest room said that it was reported to the front desk and said that a compensation of 10 yuan was needed. We agreed, but when we checked out, the front desk said nothing, and then we couldn't get through on the phone for a long time. We couldn't think of a solution. Let's wait, I'm in a hurry to go out, and then I swiped ten yuan and told him that it's okay, if it breaks down, I should pay for it and don't ask, don't turn around and embarrass the little girl.
and then
Room view:
The lobby may not be air-conditioned, it is very hot. As soon as I entered the room, my parents were stunned and said that the ground was full of bumps and holes. I looked at it and said that it might be the decoration style of the house. Then there is nothing to say about the toilet, facing the bed, and there is no cubicle, and then there is stagnant water. Every time I take a bath or wash clothes, there is water on the floor, and it is easy to fall. Furthermore, the sound of the air conditioner is super loud, it should be too old! The sound outside the city view room is very loud, which affects sleep!
Overall, it was relatively poor. At that time, I mainly liked the brand of Mangrove, and the price was right, so I didn't compare it with other hotels. Now think about it a little regret! Friends who want to live can take a look and learn from experience...

As a result, my friend said that the mangrove forest is also very convenient to go to the airport. According to a comprehensive comparison, the mangrove forest in Sanya Bay is the best, so I came back here to book a room tonight. After arriving, I went to the food street downstairs of the hotel and ate a lot of Hainanese snacks. I‚Äôm going back tomorrow morning, and sigh, Sanya is a place that you don‚Äôt want to leave when you come, and the mangrove forest is a place where you want to live when you come!

The breakfast is still very rich. Mr. Zhang is very picky about breakfast, and he has a good evaluation of the breakfast here. There are both Chinese and Western food, and the food is served in a timely manner.
The children's amu*****t facilities are a bit old, but it doesn't prevent the children from having fun. There are a lot of floating objects in the water. I saw that the staff cleaned them up very diligently in the morning, but this can't be avoided. I went to Amazon Paradise and Adventure Kingdom, I would like to mention that the staff are very friendly. You need a QR code to enter Adventure Kingdom. We wanted to enter both the big and small ones. The staff sent two tickets without saying a word.
Let me talk about the shortcomings. The room is indeed a bit old-fashioned. The carpet is not very clean, and the bath towels are a bit torn. Just coordinate with the staff to replace them in time.
In short, this hotel is very cost-effective. If you come to Sanya with a low budget, I recommend this hotel

The water in the children's area of the water park is a bit cold, and it is not very playable below 1.2 meters;
Get off at the entrance of the hotel lobby and no one will help you with your luggage. There is no star hotel service, which needs to be improved;
Many shopping malls are closed or empty with no customers. It is recommended to introduce online celebrity shops to improve the experience according to the trend.

It is very convenient to go to Qianguqing and Sanya Bay

It is worth choosing this hotel for traveling with children. The Amazon jungle water park that comes with the hotel is also suitable for children to play, but the water temperature is slightly lower at the end of February.
The only downside is that there is noise when the airlines of Phoenix Airport pass by, and it is much better to close the door.
Overall, I am very satisfied. The coupons are worth the money, and the discounts are huge. It is indeed much more cost-effective to book online in advance. It is worth recommending.

I stayed for 5 nights, and the upstairs was noisy in the middle of the night. I can‚Äôt make calls to the front desk, and it‚Äôs also laborious to call the front desk. Either no one answers the switchboard, or I have to make several calls before answering. I‚Äôm so speechless. No one answers the room service calls. I also have breakfast on the 2nd floor of the hotel. I saw it with my own eyes. The matter, that should be the head waiter among the waiters, she is fat, she seems to be called Han Libo, the head waiter wiped the stools and the dining table with a piece of cloth, and then she happened to come to our table to clean up the bowls, by the way, why did the rag wipe the stools and the table together? Wipe the chair, she directly replied that I wash the rag every day, speechless wow...
Also, since Ctrip has a cooperative relationship with this hotel, we booked a room and wanted to change rooms. The hotel staff told the Ctrip staff to let us communicate at the front desk. It is strange that you are not a cooperative relationship? The on-duty manager of Ctrip didn't play any role in talking inside and out. The structure of handling things and speaking is too small to lead his own team.

The facilities are complete, although some are old, such as the door, there is a sound when opening the door, which is a bit difficult. Everything else is fine.
Although the water park is small and a bit old, the items that children like are very useful. The big water slide, the flying carpet slide, the wave pool, the lazy river, these few things played for two days. Children are not particularly picky, water is joy. The swimming pool is also nice. On the third floor of the hotel. Every hotel has its own swimming pool. It feels like it can be played together. Many children played for a while and ran the king's brown swimming pool. We didn't go. Listening to the children shouting, the water in the king brown swimming pool is deeper. Bodhi is 1.2 meters.
The breakfast is quite rich, in line with the hotel standard of 500 a night with breakfast. All kinds of noodles, noodles, threads, and wontons are available. There are also many kinds of snacks that children like. Others are quite satisfactory. Salad, fried rice, tofu brain, steamed corn pumpkin purple potato and so on.
I haven't had enough fun in the water park, and late check-out is very considerate. The park is very large, and shopping is also available. Overall I feel good.

Finally, after I came here, I learned from the staff‚Äôs introduction. It turns out that the six hotels in the mangrove resort, including King Palm, Queen Palm, Bodhi, and Kapok, belong to a group. The rooms are similar, and there are slight differences according to their respective themes. Please pay attention when booking .

This is the first time I have encountered this kind of operation in a hotel. After getting the power card and turning on the light, I found that the bathroom was very wet. I didn't pay attention to it at the time. I thought it was just that the person in front left late and had just cleaned it. When I took a shower, I found that the door of the bathroom could not be closed. When I went out the next day, I wanted to get the electricity card, but it was just for electricity, so I left it in the room and didn‚Äôt take it away. When I went back to the room at night, I found that the electricity card was taken away again. I found the phone in discredit, but my head still knocked After a while, I made several phone calls and finally got connected. The other party said politely: Sorry, do you need to get the power card? I asked him back: Can I say that I don't need it? Do you want me to stay in your room in the dark? On the third night, I returned to the room to get the electricity card, but the floor mat at the door of the bathroom was still taken away, and no bottle of water was delivered. Three people came to deal with it in three days. The first one, Mr. Li, who claimed to be the director of the commercial depar**ent, who was wearing work clothes, sent a power card and gave a verbal condolence and apology. After it was finished, it was still the same. The maintenance guy said that this is a design problem, and it can't be fixed after a long time. The second one was Ms. Li from the marketing depar**ent who was wearing her own clothes. She still apologized with a good attitude and said that she would report my problem and contact her immediately if there is any problem. The third one was a lady who claimed to be the manager on duty called to apologize and sent someone to deliver water, floor mats, and bath towels, and said that the result of the second processing was to extend our check-out time to 3:30. I said that I am a member of Ctrip, and it was extended to two o'clock. She said that they don't have it there, and they all check out at 12 o'clock. In the end, he sent us a breakfast as compensation. The above situations all happen around 11 o'clock every night. You are already very tired after playing for a day, and you want to wash up and go to sleep quickly, and you really don't have the energy to bother. After eating at 9 o'clock in the morning, there was nothing to eat. After eating, I went to the water park provided by the room reservation. There were not many people or many items. The mangrove forest is very large, and no one will open the door for you to take your luggage into the room when you get off the bus, and there is no battery car to pick you up in the park. All in all, this is a very bad experience, and I will never stay in this hotel again.

Sanya, which has just passed the epidemic, still seems very deserted, but the service of the hotel is very warm. In particular, the exclusive butler, Anne, added various coordination arrangements on WeChat the day before check-in, laying a solid foundation for a comfortable stay.

The water park is very fun! It‚Äôs cool to catch up with fewer people and not line up to play anything!

The park is very large, and it is also convenient to go to the water park. Guests staying in the hotel can enter and exit multiple times a day, and the children have a great time.
The water park swimming pool, the lazy river is not open, and there are not many people. Some projects have weight requirements for children, and they need to be more than 40 kg to play. Therefore, the children basically played the intermediate-level double lap slide and the rainbow slide, and did not catch up with the wave-making.

Check into the Mangrove Hotel in the hustle and bustle. We would like to thank Mr. Liang of Mangrove Hotel for actively helping tourists and the government to communicate with the government during our stay in Sanya, and striving for the opportunity for us to give priority to outlying islands. In addition, I would like to thank the hotel's Janny Hu, who took the trouble to answer my questions through WeChat before we checked into the hotel, and helped me with follow-up questions such as check-out and deposit refund after our return trip. This time, due to the epidemic, I did not really experience the various commercial and entertainment facilities of the mangroves. After the epidemic is over, I will visit Sanya again. I wish the Mangrove Hotel and the people of Sanya to get rid of this epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal work and life this morning.

Fortunately, there is a water park that children like in the park, and the Bodhi swimming pool is also very beautiful. In the next few days Due to the time limit of nucleic acid, I have been trapped all the time. Finally, the second nucleic acid result within 48 hours was released on the 5th at 4 pm. I am grateful to Miss Janny for the thoughtful delay, and I did not let the child suffer during the anxious waiting. Feeling wronged, I say goodbye to my favorite mangrove forest happily.

From the airport to the hotel, the driver and I were carrying luggage, and the doorman was standing at the door as if he didn't see it. Going to check in, the front desk should be new. I came here. I didn't introduce where the breakfast was or any information about the hotel. After I was done, I asked where the elevator was. At this time, the front desk clerk asked me what is your room number? He seemed to want to record something in the computer. I asked him at the time, did you have it in your computer? You opened the room for me and asked me what the room number is. Later, the colleague next to him helped him out of the siege. When he arrived in the room, it was very late, so he put the luggage away and took the child to dinner. After returning to the room, he washed the child and let him sleep. When the child wanted to drink water, I found that there was no mineral water in the room, let alone the welcome snack written when booking the room. No one answered the phone on the floor, and I went out to look around and found no one. Go to the front desk. The front desk tells me and the floor attendant to ask for it. I'll go and walk my grandson! I bought two bottles by myself at the door and quickly took them back for the children to drink and sleep. For breakfast the next day, there was no waiter to take the seat. When it was full, I continued to let guests in. I turned around and couldn‚Äôt find a place, so I had to stand with two buns. Eat it! This eats up fast! The shower screen in the room smelled of urine! All right! That's all! In the future, even if I arrive at the hotel late, I don't want to look for such a hotel too much! Capitalize, serve! The photo is where I know the hotel should put mineral water, but I didn't see it, and there is the breakfast room

Playing in Amazon Water Park, I was told that there is no such service when hosting, so I had no choice but to drag the baby up early in the morning and take it to the beach. When I returned to the hotel, it was close to the check-out time, and I did not enjoy any services. The water park only let the baby play for 30 minutes, and the adults did not go into the water...

As soon as I entered the room, there was a strong musty smell, and there was no free mineral water, so I still called the customer service staff to ask for it. The breakfast buffet is even worse. You have to queue up for everything. There is no staff to maintain order. It is not even as good as a big cafeteria. Not to mention the taste and appearance of the dishes. The jungle water park adventure is even more flickering. The water is as dirty as ditch water. After entering, the children think it is dirty, and one item comes out without playing.

At that time, the front desk said that due to their negligence, they had deducted the room fee for me and the guests who stayed with me at the same time. I was speechless at the time, and people who were completely irrelevant, signed the housing agreement separately and deducted the room fee of the deposit, how could they deduct the room fee of other people on my head? Then the front desk told me to find this person myself and get my room fee back? Excuse me, we just met by chance, and it's your hotel's reason why you want me to ask for the room fee? Then it was delayed until I came back from Hainan and I didn't contact me once. I found them through Ctrip at the end of July, and then an account manager contacted me and said that they would help with the refund of the deposit, but it took a month. I think this is ridiculous. It's obviously because of your hotel that I have to wait so long for my loss, and the guest who deducted the wrong payment has already supplied her share of the money to the hotel. Why didn't you help me deal with the losses I deserved? The customer service of Ctrip also promised to help me take responsibility for this matter to the end, but after that, it didn't matter. I didn't contact her, and she didn't contact her either. I. As a hotel of this size, is this really the way to deal with such a low-level error? I believe that the hotel booked by Ctrip through Ctrip's app, the guests are treated so unfairly, do you just leave it alone? Is this how Ctrip protects its guests' rights?

msg:Satisfied with the score It is not bad not to score five points, but it can be improved better. Let‚Äôs talk about it in detail below
Good place in service:
1. Directly upgrade the room type
2. Because of time constraints, the staff has a good attitude and delayed my check-out, which is really good üòä
3. When I respond to the problem, I can give a positive and quick solution
4. The ladies at the front desk looked very tired, but they all answered questions seriously
5. When I first arrived at this hotel, every staff member I met greeted me with a smile
All of the above are worthy of affirmation
Now let's talk about the areas that can be improved
1. The facilities in the room, such as the hair dryer, are too old and inconvenient to use. It is recommended to replace them. The cost is not very large, but it can improve the satisfaction of guests.
2. For some reason, the breakfast suddenly stopped a few dishes on the morning of the 17th, because it happened to be my favorite, so I was very impressed.
2. When the cleaning aunt entered the room, some details did not have the paradigm of a multi-star hotel at all. It was very casual. It is not denied that some places did a good job, such as replenishing mineral water in time. The aunt's work is very hard, if you can have more star hotels The service trace is better
Let's talk about the entertainment facilities of the hotel. We only experienced the swimming pool, and it feels normal. Others have no experience and no right to speak.
In general, the price/performance ratio of this hotel is ok. I have stayed for more than 400 yuan, and I feel satisfied.
Regarding the furniture facilities, although they are outdated, they are clean and hygienic, so I still recommend them in general.

It‚Äôs okay, but the facilities are relatively old. Two items can be played, others are broken... The row of shops across the road is a real pit, the supermarket's items are 80% premium, Lanzhou ramen is 30 a bowl, two small pieces of meat, not ramen...

msg:It is recommended to take children on vacation or choose other hotels in the mangrove forest, such as King Brown. I booked a parent-child theme room at the Mangrove Bodhi Hotel. I arrived at noon and wanted to check in. The front desk told me that there were only two parent-child themed rooms, and that I would check out at 2 pm and check in at 3 pm. It's understandable that I came early. I went out for a walk and then returned to the hotel at 1:00. There was no air conditioner or electric fan in the lobby. The front desk was told that it had not been cleaned, and was forced to change to a theme room because it was too hot to wait. The staff who cleans the room are very nice, they greet each other with a smile as soon as they meet. The service ability of the front desk is really lacking and did not help me communicate with the housekeeping depar**ent in time. In the evening, I wanted to go out to eat seafood. When I arrived at the hotel, I asked the staff in charge of luggage at the hotel to wear hotel work clothes. The boy immediately told me where it was good, and said that a friend of him could deliver it for free, so I called immediately. , his friend happened to be in the hotel basement. His friend came to the door of the hotel right away, and I said directly, you won't take me to the order you designated, I may not be able to eat, the person said no, any place is fine. Then we got into this person's car. After getting in the car, he said that the shop was opened by his brother. I said that I was just going to have a look, not necessarily to eat. Then he said about the taxi fare, and I also gave it to me. After paying his taxi fare, he got off at the location. Personally, I feel that the cooperation between the hotel staff and external staff is not very good!

msg:Originally, this hotel was just for a transition to live in Yanlord the next day.

Originally, I was only greedy for it to be cheap and not far from the airport.

After all, it is a hotel that has been open for almost 10 years, and the expectations are already very low.

But after checking in, I found it was really fragrant!

Ctrip used the Sanya consumer coupons for the Dragon Boat Festival and it was only about 170 a night
Including tickets for 2 adults and 1 breakfast and the hotel's 2 adults and 1 small water park

This resort is a bit like Galaxy Macau, consisting of 7 hotels, with a water park in the middle.

Originally booked the Bodhi Hotel, the hotel's GRO Huajian contacted in advance and said that because of the Bodhi decoration, he would help me to upgrade to the round view room of the King Palm Hotel.

The style of the room is a bit old, but it is still clean and it can be seen that it was brilliant before.

But what kind of bike do you need for 170 yuan! It's really an overpriced treasure hotel. It's no problem to transition one night or two nights! I really like the imitation wood structure design of the lobby. Looking up is super beautiful!

Satisfied with the stay! GRO Jianhua service is great! She is very enthusiastic and has a good attitude. I will look for her next time!
Xiaomei at the front desk is also very good

Many hotels in the atrium are very convenient. You can also see the Caribbean water world where children can play. The little girl at the front desk Contacted us in advance and was very enthusiastic to guide us how to drive into the parking lot to avoid going the wrong way. The surrounding area of the hotel is all good, there are various restaurants worth punching in, and it is not far from the Hailv Duty Free Shop. The setting of the hotel is a little outdated, and I personally think it can be refurbished. As long as it is not very picky, I think this hotel can be recommended

msg:This one is really super big. The whole mangrove forest is divided into several hotels, but they are all interconnected.
We booked Bodhi. Bodhi is a hotel that opened earlier. Maybe because of the off-season, the occupancy rate is not very high. The front desk helped us upgrade to a higher-level room type.
It is strongly recommended that everyone come here to live on the higher floor as possible, because standing on the balcony and looking at the entire park is really super comfortable, especially at night, sitting on the balcony and drinking a little wine and chatting for a while Very comfortable.
The hotel service will not be cold, but it is not overly enthusiastic, and the overall is quite satisfactory
And this hotel is highly recommended for families with children on vacation, because there is an Amazon forest in the hotel park, which has a playground for children to play with water, as well as some water sports for adults to play, and a wave pool to play at the same time Really makes people happy.
Don't worry about the food. There is a food street in this place. I think many local people come here to eat. For example, Starbucks KFC also has it here. If you don‚Äôt want to go out to eat, you can order takeaway. There are also many takeaways around.
And there is also a shopping mall, where you can buy clothes, such as hm, you can also buy it here.

shortcoming:
1. It is far from the sea, but it has little to do with Sanya Bay.
2. There is not even a decent swimming pool in the hotel, only a rectangular swimming pool, such as a gym, which does not match the signboard of the resort hotel, what a sense of design.
3. Many facilities in Amazon Park are closed, and there are additional expenses.

Fortunately, with the kind care of the service staff Xiao Guo, this trip to the mangroves got more unexpected joy.
Thanks again to Xiao Guo for his meticulousness and thoughtfulness, and to Mangrove Hotel for his service.
[If the hardware is not enough, the service will make up for it] But the supplement is unexpectedly excellent and unexpectedly perfect!

Their breakfast is also very good, and Hou'an noodles are very delicious. , There are also many categories. It is an old-fashioned five-star hotel. It is worth recommending. There are also a lot of food around the hotel, so it is more convenient to go anywhere!

Personally think the suite is cost-effective, only about 1400.

The travel shoot is not bad, quite mature, and has its own makeup artist and clothing to provide. Previously, the travel shoot in other hotels was to prepare clothes, makeup and hair by myself, and the exquisite makeup only cost 150 yuan, and the price/performance ratio was still OK. Hope to make a big effect later!

The supporting facilities of the hotel group are quite good, and they have everything to eat, drink and play. Haha, it is convenient for the hotel to squat.

Forgot to take pictures of the room, it is quite spacious and children can hide and seek in the room.

The consumption in the hotel is not expensive, and the food, drink and entertainment are very complete. My daughter-in-law goes shopping in the mall, and I take the kids to the water park. By the way, the travel photography of the hotel is also good, and I took some pictures for the children.

If you don't want to eat at the hotel, you can go to the nearby small restaurant, just across the road, you can eat everything you want, there are many choices.

Stayed in this hotel for more than ten days, I feel very good, I will choose Sanya in the future.

When the bus goes to Dawang, the feeling is very poor. I still have to argue about who comes first. When I got to the room, I lost two bath towels. I called the front desk and they sent them immediately. The room setting is ok and spacious. I can see the swimming pool on the second floor. Just swipe the room card in the world, you don't need to go to the hotel front desk to exchange the ticket! The water world is ok, it's a bit cold, and the children will go away when they are young. There are also exciting projects. For rafting, you can rent a lifebuoy for 50 yuan, and there is no time limit. The breakfast the next day was very rich, praise

Both rooms were not cleaned. Now I've been waiting in the aisle for an hour and a half, making numerous hotel calls, but it's useless. It wasn't until I called Sanya's complaint phone that I got a little response! Dozens of rooms on the whole floor, one person cleans! At five o'clock in the afternoon, the cleaning staff didn't even have time to eat lunch! Is this hotel squeezing labor? !
Let‚Äôs talk about hygiene first: take a look at the hygiene on this floor, is it what a resort should have? Not even an express hotel! It can be seen from the traces of the elevator entrance that it has not been swept the corridor for a long time! ! When I opened the door and saw the uncleaned room, I was so disgusted that I lost all thought of staying in it!
Let‚Äôs talk about service: I don‚Äôt care what I want, I have to get everything myself, the room attendant is useless, what is the AI housekeeper‚Äôs automatic voice when calling, and there is no response after the call is over. You have to take your own water, slippers, and bath towels. Everything is self-help, and there is no service. There is still red on the towel, I don't know if it's blood or marks, hey! Powerless to rant!
Amazon Water Park: The elderly brought their children in to play. They have no personal experience and are inconvenient to speak. It's just that my mother came back and said that many projects were not opened, and I don't know why.
Oh! correct! Another thing that makes me sick is the breakfast! ! I rely on! Really want to scold! It's really not as good as I cook noodles at home! There is nothing, and the dishes are poor. I am very responsible to say that I can't be a business hotel for business trips! Anyway, we didn't have enough to eat for two mornings, we really didn't know what to eat!
A lifetime of black hotel! My son said never to come again, too dirty! I really don't know why so many people live with children! Just for fun? ? ?

But don't issue a room card if you haven't cleaned the room, you can't see it! And all four rooms have the same problem. Seeing this, I notified the cleaning, and I waited until 9 o'clock in the evening to clean up. In just a few days of vacation, I missed a day in vain, and I didn't go anywhere! But fortunately, the Ctrip platform has been actively dealing with the problem. The platform is good, but there are serious loopholes in the management of merchants. I hope the platform will supervise more and merchants will improve!

We went up at 4:40 and found that the hotel room was dirty, messy and smelly. I went to the front desk of the hotel. The staff at the front desk of the hotel had a bad attitude. The result was like this. The front desk of the hotel said nonsense that we could only go up after 1.5 hours. All five of our family heard him say that we would go up at 4:30. As a result, he said very badly that he told us that it would take an hour and a half to return. Saying that I couldn‚Äôt live it, I couldn‚Äôt make the reservations. Then I made three more calls from the hotel management depar**ent before someone came to clean it. One hotel room was not cleaned and the guests were put in. One hotel was close to 5 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon. Even the room was not cleaned, and the reception at the front desk of the hotel was extremely bad. We are consumers and he has such an attitude towards us. A hotel receptionist has such an attitude. His boss is not good. I strongly condemn this hotel, everyone in the future. Don't just stay here.

msg:The price-performance ratio of the hotel is good, the room is big, the price is cheap, and it also includes breakfast and water world tickets, but there are several reasons for giving a bad review: 1. When I bought it on Ctrip, it clearly stated that 2 large and 2 small water world tickets, I am one The adult brought two children into the kindergarten. The child's height was 119cm after the physical examination at the end of the last semester of the school. It took only a few days for the child to be 121cm tall? ! And I have only one adult and only used one adult ticket. The attitude of the waiter at the gate is very poor! The attitude that you owe her money is really annoying! Not wanting the children to be disappointed, I bought a child ticket of 68 yuan separately to enter the venue. 2. I booked to stay for two consecutive nights. On the day of check-in, I was told that I could go to the water world for 3 days on the day of check-in, the next day and the day of check-out, but the next day I was told that there was only one chance to play in the water world! Although we only set aside one day to play in the water world, such a dishonest approach is very annoying! 3. The service attitude of the staff in the water world is very poor! Sit and brush with your phone, and don't do work! Looking at the children who couldn't get on the shore from the pool, didn't help, and looked indifferent! The children have been playing a project all the time, and it took a long time to use a hovercraft. Moreover, the children took out the hovercraft from the water by themselves, and then worked together to drag the hovercraft to the top floor. It was completely physical work! It took a long time to carry it, and it only took ten seconds to slide down. After playing a few times, I was unreasonably asked not to occupy the hovercraft! Call your own money to rent! And a lot of idle hovercraft next to the Cobra slide are unused! I was very angry and asked him why he didn't take out so many unused ones? He was speechless, the gist of it was to rent it if he needed it! I really don't know if the owner of this water world didn't pay them part-time wages or we didn't buy tickets? ! We bought tickets for two big and two small, and also bought a separate children's ticket. The result is such a service, which is really invincible! In fact, there are not many things to play in the whole water world: Cobra slide (can not play below 1.4m), pirate ship slide, small green snake slide, rainbow slide and the bath in the middle. Drifting also costs 50 yuan to rent a swimming ring to play. The playground outside is also a variety of money. In short, although the price of the hotel is not expensive, there are all kinds of spending pits outside. It‚Äôs okay to spend money happily as long as you have a good experience, but if you spend money and get angry, you will be taken advantage of! So only bad reviews! 4. The room service is very slow, always forgetting things, the cleaning is sloppy, and the water delivery is reluctant. Compared with the five-star hotel I stayed in before, the service gap is not so big. 5. There are several children's play items in the amu*****t plaza outside the water world, and the price is not cheap! Go karting for 8 minutes and 5 yuan! Each is basically 30, 4-5 minutes. Not to mention the attitude, the service staff in the entire mangrove forest did not meet a smiling face. Sanya generally has such a service attitude and quality, and it is strange that the economy can develop! Even Hainan's duty-free port policy will not be too attractive and advantageous, let's wait and see! 6. Shards of broken glass were found in the sand of Waterworld! And most of them are barefoot! No one manages, they are busy collecting money, such a service is really powerless to complain! Based on the above, I will never stay in a hotel of the Mangrove Group in the future!

msg:The most unpleasant booking on Ctrip, I would not recommend any friends to book, except for the good location, there is no advantage. Several hotels share public facilities, the management is chaotic, and they spend 470 to book a room with old furniture, it is better to live like home, dare to say yes Renovated according to the five-star standard, the underground parking lot is also uninstructed and unmanaged, and it is full of dust. China Southern Airlines flight attendants go in and out of the hotel, and breakfast is also eaten in a restaurant. Those who mind during the epidemic will remind you. We recommend everyone not to go to the water park. The rotten equipment is old, the paint is peeling off everywhere in the pool, and no one maintains it. There are charges everywhere. After buying a big ticket, it will cost 50 to rent a drifting boat. Adults bring children less than 1.2 meters in height and can't play the slides. The staff actually let them go to the door and pay for the children's refills.

For the second time, I was lucky to meet Miss Vicky Bu at the front desk, who was very nice, and gave me a lucky suggestion again. I got a garden-view double bed at the Bodhi Hotel.

msg:In order to fly to the airport early, I chose the Mangrove Bodhi Hotel in Sanya Bay, because the flight that departs at 8:20 in the morning does not require and has no time to have breakfast in the hotel. It happens that the hotel has a price without breakfast, 298 per night. The price of staying in a business hotel enjoys the services and facilities of a high-star hotel, and the price/performance ratio is very high. At dinner time, take a taxi from the hotel for more than ten yuan to the beach of Sanya Bay to watch the sunset, watch tourists living in Sanya or traveling from north to south, take photos with various fancy photos, and watch the elderly in the Northeast prepare a big Yangko at Haiyue Square. Compared with the quietness of the five-star hotels in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay, here is another feeling of smoke and fire. When the sunset sinks to the bottom of the sea, I walked slowly back to the hotel. There were many restaurants on the road, and I went to a restaurant that made Shanxi cuisine for dinner. The temperature in Sanya in this season is quite comfortable, and the air conditioner is not needed at night. The Mangrove in Sanya Bay is equivalent to a complex of hotel clusters. After checking in in the afternoon, I went for a walk. There are swimming pools, supermarkets, shopping centers, various restaurants, amu*****t parks, KFC, Starbucks, etc. I personally recommend a family trip with parents or parents to choose Yalong Bay Mangroves for a few nights. If you are a couple traveling and prefer to be private and tuned, you can consider Yalong Bay.

msg:This trip to Sanya has a limited budget, and the low price of mangroves surprised me. I booked two nights. What attracted me before was my own water park.
I ordered a Bodhi bed room and upgraded to a suite after I arrived at the store. The room is super large. Unfortunately, the opposite is the street, and the opposite is a construction site... But my original room is also facing this direction (I didn't know when I booked it).
Entering the room, the bathroom smelled of drain, which was very smelly. I immediately called the room service. The room service attitude was very good. I cleaned it first, and then called the engineering depar**ent to repair it. The engineering depar**ent said that the customer needs to leave for the repair, and finally replaced it. Room.
An ordinary day passed. I was awakened by the sound of the construction site on the opposite side at less than 7 o‚Äôclock the next day. I called the front desk and asked if I could add money to the opposite room. The front desk asked me to go to the front desk to change directly at 12 o‚Äôclock.
I went to the front desk at 12 o'clock, and changed to the opposite big bed room (there is no suite), no need to add money. Happy, I switched to a garden-view big bed room, my vision is not a little better.
The double bed room is also very big, I think the layout is better than the suite.
I got a ticket to go to the water park. To be honest, the water park is a bit small. I went to the water world of Atlantis last year, so I didn't feel anything. In addition, it may be off-season and there are almost no guests. No one is playing the project. I went in and came out at once, a bit disappointed.
The water park has a small beach, and the sand is still very comfortable.
The second night I slept much better. I slept until nine o'clock in the morning and went to the restaurant at 9:30. There was no more food. A bowl of noodles was quite delicious.
What does the Bodhi Hotel say, it's a bit lonely, there are some minor problems, but they will be solved immediately, the price is still very good, the room is super big, the service of the waiter is very good, the car will help open the door to carry the luggage, and leave the store Also gave us a cute little gift.
The hotel park is very large, the photos are pretty good, Thai style.

msg:Before I came, I read the evaluation and surroundings and I didn't expect much, because I didn't have much expectation, so it was acceptable.
Disadvantages: The location is far from the sea, and the prices of hotels without sea in Sanya are generally low. Although the hotel has shopping streets and restaurants, many of them are not open, and the ones that are open are very deserted and there are few people. The hotel's Amazon Water World facilities are old and sanitary. Only the children's water village can barely play, and many other projects are not open. The hotel attendant was very cold, and there was no one to help pick up the luggage for the few people who stayed at the lobby station. When I went out to ask for directions, I just pointed it and made a big circle in the opposite direction. He didn't know the package provided by Ctrip if he didn't tell the front desk. The water park ticket he sent gave me a night ticket, but I couldn't use it, so I went to the front desk and exchanged it for a daily ticket. It is not recommended for vacation. Three or four hundred can stay for one night, but more than five hundred is not recommended.
Advantages: Convenient eating around, you can order takeaway, close to the station, Starbucks and KFC at the gate of the park. Hotel hygiene is ok.

Needs to be improved: the bathroom water barrier is relatively low, and the bathroom door cannot be closed tightly, causing the shower water to splash outside.
