The front desk told us that there would be afternoon tea in the restaurant before five o'clock. I thought that the time had already arrived and we would not be able to receive guests. As a result, when we arrived at the restaurant, we didn't stop waiting because the time was up. We were still served patiently, which was great. Except for the price, everything else is fine. Ha ha.

After the new rain in the empty mountains, the Tangshan Mountains are like washing, refreshing and pleasant. The timing is perfect. Such beautiful scenery makes people linger and intoxicated, forgetting the world.
       Quiet, relaxing, fresh and pleasant. The SPA completely replicates the Bali style, and the technician Semy's techniques are great and worth a try. The restaurant has a full range of Chinese and Western dishes, with many choices for breakfast and dinner. The afternoon tea is also very interesting.
      From check-in to check-out, you can use WeChat to contact the housekeeper, and your requirements can basically be met, including pick-up and drop-off, meal delivery, and various service reservations.
      The hotel's architecture was designed by Indonesian designer Tan Tik Lam, and the light expression is superb. If you take a leisurely walk, you might be able to take some good photos.
      I will definitely come back when I have free time in the future, and see you soon.

msg:A pleasant stay during the Spring Festival. We went with our two elderly people and children. They all particularly liked the relaxed and cozy holiday style of Bali and left us with a wonderful experience. The villa has a large room, a big bed, a kitchen in the room, a small refrigerator in each bedroom, and a coffee machine that we can't live without. There are hot spring pools and swimming pools in the yard. The hot springs must be filled with water by the housekeeper in advance. It can be filled in less than twenty minutes. The natural hot spring water is very hot and it will take a while before you can soak in it, so you must fill it in advance, but do not put it in before. The water that comes out is very clean and does not have all kinds of dead skin and unspeakable things floating around like other public pools. You can't swim in the swimming pool in winter, so you can only take photos of the sunken shape. According to reports, this is one of the few places where natural hot spring water is directly used. Many other facilities store hot spring water in water tanks in advance and then continuously heat it for use. The hotel's service is particularly good. The front desk, battery car driver, restaurant waiter, and butler who fills the hot spring water are all very enthusiastic and proactive. They are always on hand to change bath towels and robes. When they saw the cars parked on the street outside the hotel, everyone flocked to the large public hot springs in the surrounding area. Fortunately, they chose this place during the festival. It was relaxing, quiet, and stress-free. In addition, the breakfast in the restaurant is very rich, including Chinese, Western, and Indonesian food. The complimentary afternoon tea is simple but sufficient. There is a town near the hotel with many local restaurants. On the other side is the Mine Park, which is very close. The only drawback is that the furniture is relatively old, but it is still well maintained and does not affect the accommodation experience.

msg:highly recommended. A very wonderful experience ~ I will go to Nanjing again just for this hotel.
Environment: The entire hotel is composed of villas nestled in the camphor forest. There are not many modern and noisy elements. It gives people a feeling of tranquility and comfort, which can make people calm down instantly. If you're looking for a place to truly relax, this is the place to be.
Catering: The restaurant is not big, but it provides very delicious food. Personally, I think it surpasses most five-star hotels in China. All food is cooked to order, the ingredients are fresh and exquisite, and the Chinese and Western chefs are highly skilled, creating the ultimate gourmet experience. In order to taste the delicious food in the restaurant, you can go to Nanjing. I like the service of the waiters very much. They are sincere and attentive. They really consider the guests' perspective and enthusiastically recommend and introduce them. Breakfast is free, lunch and dinner can be ordered a la carte, everything is delicious and the price is very reasonable.
Facilities: The hotel has been in existence for more than ten years. The facilities are not new, but they are clean and easy to use. The room smells comfortable, the bathrobe is very comfortable, and the towels are extremely soft. Body lotion and essential oil soap with long-lasting fragrance.
Service: Butler-style service. You can call or send the butler WeChat to have the hot spring water filled at any time. If you order takeout at ten o'clock in the evening, the butler will thoughtfully deliver it to your room. When you meet the cleaning staff and service staff in the park, they will greet you very kindly, which is natural and feels like home.
I like Xiangzhang Huaping very much, and I would like to stay at their hotels in Yangshuo and Indonesia if I have the opportunity in the future.

There are obvious deficiencies in daily maintenance in all aspects, but I am quite satisfied with the price of more than 3,000 for the room and environment alone. But the service is really not satisfactory. Although I don't pursue butler-style service, since the store says it's a butler-style service, should I also do it? Butlers don't exist, and even basic service with a smile is not possible. Except that when I checked in at the beginning, I was picked up by someone, and I stayed for two days, and there was no welcome in and out of the hotel. Nobody introduced themselves and I didn't know the names of any of the service staff. I said that when I put the complimentary afternoon tea in the room, I was coldly told that an additional service fee would be charged, which is reasonable and unexpected. The first sincere and warm greeting I can feel is the aunt who cleans on the second day of check-in. In my impression, there is only one male staff member who should be Indonesian in the front office, which I agree with. The rest give people more feeling that they are just doing their own work without enthusiasm. For a hotel positioned at this level, it is not the frame and the body that capture the hearts of the guests, but more details and flesh and blood. I hope that the store will spend more time and effort on management and personnel training.

It's just that the lights of the hot springs are relatively dim at night, and it is easy to be bitten by mosquitoes
Soaking after dark is not recommended

The next thing I have to say is that we visited the restaurant four times a day...Because we went early and didn't want to go out to find a place to eat, we ate lunch directly at the hotel...Not to mention...the taste is really unexpected Well, afternoon tea, dinner, and breakfast, our family went out to the restaurant when the time came...

Although some years old, but the various facilities are well maintained. Wake up by birdsong in the morning, watching camphor trees falling flowers is super relaxing. The staff are very enthusiastic, saying hello and saying hello along the way.
The breakfast is amazing, it is a la carte style, the plate is exquisitely presented, and it feels like eating a western meal. And the waiter reminded that if there are special requirements for lunch and dinner, the restaurant can buy ingredients in advance for exclusive cooking, and pays great attention to service.
Traveling during the May Day holiday and avoiding crowds, this is a good choice. It is estimated that summer is more popular and the swimming pool can be used. Currently only bubbles in hot spring pools are available.

Slow down the pace and soak in the hot springs, and then feel the spa from Bali. The considerate service makes you feel like you are in Bali. The breakfast was amazing. You must try the Balinese cinnamon toast. Even though the hotel was full, it was still quiet, as if only our family was on vacation. When we checked out, we heard that we couldn‚Äôt get a taxi if we were going to the Garden Expo, so we specially sent a business car to take our family to the hotel where we stayed at the next stop.

msg:40-50 minutes drive from downtown Nanjing, come to the hot springs with your parents~

Service: The hotel's service is unquestionable, from check-in to various communications are very smooth. It's just that the spa center is being upgraded during the stay, come and experience it next time!

Facilities: The hotel has been open for a long time. Considering the relatively large area of the villa suite, it is recommended to upgrade the temperature control and lighting control system in the room to a smart one for the whole house, and add more sockets, which will be more convenient for guests to use. There are four double doors in the villa, but none of them have latches/locks. The hotel is located in the suburbs and on the mountain, and guests may be worried about security issues. It is recommended that the hotel consider upgrading security measures, or explain the hotel's security facilities/measures to guests in advance. Dispel customers' doubts.

Hot spring: You need to inform the housekeeper in advance to ask the staff to release the water. The uncle who helps to release the water has a very good attitude and will carefully remind you that the water temperature is high, and you should wait until the temperature is suitable before soaking in the hot spring. The temperature in Nanjing at the end of April is still very low, so it is really comfortable to have a soup.

Meals: The restaurant products are very good. The Indonesian fried rice in the breakfast menu is a must-try, and the staff will warmly recommend it when ordering. You will be full every day when you live here. I am also very happy to live in the room closest to the restaurant, and it is very convenient to go to the lobby.
The hotel provides fresh fruit every day, Kayumanis homemade cookies are not very sweet, friendly to the elderly and dieters haha.

Summary: As expected of a well-established hot spring hotel, I am most satisfied with the service and catering. I have a comfortable stay, and the humanized service of the hotel staff also makes people feel warm. I hope you can listen to your customers' suggestions, continue to maintain a consistently high standard, serve customers better, and wish you a prosperous business.

PS: The Jiangsu Garden Expo Garden near the hotel is a treasure trove. It has just been opened for two years. It takes about 15 minutes to drive from the hotel. It is suitable for family outings and you can spend a whole day shopping. The underwater botanical garden inside is the most recommended. It is also a great choice to go back to the hotel to soak in the hot spring after shopping~

If you plan to stay during the Chinese New Year, you will have meals throughout the journey, so you don't need to worry too much. Easy parking. I arrived at the hotel at 2 o'clock and was informed that the cleaning was not complete, and I could only check in at 3 o'clock. I was a little unhappy, but the hotel gave me a free afternoon tea, which was delicious. The restaurant was warm and exposed to the sun. I enjoyed watching the lake and the birds. The hotel service is very considerate. If the child wants to change the juice, I want to change the tea, and I will refill it for us without saying a word. I will not say that one person can only drink one cup. They also thoughtfully provided a small pot of milk for my black tea, which is very enjoy.
There is an open-air hot spring in the room (you can ask the waiter to release the water at any time, the service is very considerate and timely), and the outdoor hot spring feels really good! So enjoyable, full of privacy. The temperature of the hot spring water is just right, and it is very hot and comfortable. The towel pad, everyone's slippers, and large bath towels were placed in the living room when we checked in. Then the swimming pool feels great, and I want to bring my children to try it again in summer.
The room is very comfortable to live in, the feeling of sleeping is very solid, and waking up is super satisfying, and the big living room is very happy to watch TV and brag. Enough mineral water is provided, the fruit is delicious, and drinks are free.
The downside is that there are too many doors, and it is a bit drafty. Even if the air conditioner is fully turned on, it will still feel cold after sitting for a long time. In addition, there is no smart toilet cover, and the ass is cold when you sit down.
The bath water in the bathroom is very large and very refreshing.

The dinner was highly praised (the dishes ordered at noon were all delicious)! The first time I ate all the dishes, the soft-shelled turtle was delicious, the bullfrog was also delicious, and the shrimp was also very good.

The breakfast is also very good, you can order it as you like, smoked salmon, all kinds of porridge are good, the beef noodles are quite good, and the elderly and children are very satisfied.

Looking back on these few days, it was a very good experience, and everyone felt very happy. In the room, I took a simple photo of the child with my mobile phone, and the scenery in the room is well-defined.

Service: The service is good and the housekeeper is responsive.
Environment: The environment is an independent yard that I like. The yard has the shade of osmanthus trees and the fragrance of sweet-scented osmanthus trees. I can spend a whole day in the yard reading a book and staying in a daze without going out.
Room: The room is a little dated but very clean and well maintained. Suiyuan, where I live, sometimes smells a little bit because it is close to the restaurant, but it has little effect.
Meals: Full marks for breakfast and dinner, and there is room for improvement in afternoon tea.

In general, with so many new hotels and even Banyan Trees stationed in the Garden Expo Park, I think Zhang Huaping is still the best in Tangshan, and I will continue to choose to stay next time.

msg:Said to be a two bedroom lakeside. In front of the pool is actually a small pond. There is no lake. The water is not clean. The soaked soup feels like tap water. No sulfur smell. I feel like I want to soak in a hot spring with a sulphur smell. Really few. There is no service charge except for take-out delivery to the room, others must have a service charge
I changed three hotels for 4 days and 3 nights, and only one of the hot springs smelled of sulfur.
Also, their mattresses can really be replaced with new ones.

It is really uncomfortable to get into the car in the hot summer. The second is to eat and breakfast. You need to wait for a table during peak hours, and the experience is slightly poor, but the breakfast is still very rich and the taste is good. The pastry level of afternoon tea needs to be improved; the third is the room, after all, it is a few years old, and the room facilities are slightly outdated. Try not to put food on the dining table next to the door, it is easy to attract ants, and occasionally spiders and bees are indoors. Thinking about the first floor and the wild, it is understandable; the outdoor swimming pool and hot spring pool are the highlights, and the heat is very hot. night bubbles, very comfortable. Overall, the service is still very good. In addition, the room service such as calling the battery car and delivering ice cubes is very fast.

msg:I haven't traveled far in two years, so I'll write a few more words this time.
As a resort hotel in Tangshan Hot Spring Town, Xiang Zhang Hua Ping does not need more praise to prove its level. Praise again and worry that they will raise the price, heheüòä
 During the epidemic, I couldn't leave Ning, but I wanted to enjoy life. I slept until I woke up naturally, took a bath in the hot spring, and stayed in a daze by the pool. I chose it for a long time.
If you want to escape the rolling red dust, as long as the courtyard is deep, camphor can do it; if you are tired of the hotel meals (in fact, the standard of three meals and afternoon tea snacks, camphor is very good), turn on your mobile phone, and order takeaway within half an hour. Fried chicken with milk tea, Xiangzhang front desk will deliver it to your door after receiving it.
2 nights is not enough, it's far from enough. The first night, after soaking in the hot spring, listening to the rain and wind outside the window, the next day, 4 masters came to clean the swimming pool and the courtyard; the second night, take advantage of Yunxiamei to go out in the evening Cycling for a walk, Jinwu Park listens to the uncle who has amazing lung capacity blowing the saxophone, and the summer night is also charming. When I came back, the turndown was ready, and the room under the scented candles brought me back to Koh Chang, Thailand many years ago. Lying in the ‚ô®Ô∏è pool, looking up at the splendid stars and counting the fireflies among the grass. The 24-hour private hot spring, intimate and undisturbed service, is very close to the feeling of bathing in Japan.
Last Word, Carpe diem, YOLO

The one-bedroom brother is not very sleepy and needs an extra bed. The floating afternoon tea is still more ritualistic, and the hot springs can be released during two periods of time. Dinner at the hotel was good. It is worth mentioning that the service was very good. There was a strong wind at night, and there were a lot of leaves in the morning. The housekeeper cleaned up promptly when we went to breakfast. As soon as I arrived at the front desk when I checked out, the housekeeper found that my watch and ring "add up to hundreds of thousands" were left in the room, and they brought it to me immediately, and I never found it. Really special thanks to the housekeeper. Maybe I was busy packing my luggage in the morning and forgot it! Thumbs up for your service!

The hotel is not big as a whole. There are more than 20 villas, and the greenery is full of shades. In early summer, you can feel a little cool. Especially in the morning when you wake up and walk among the trees, the sunlight casts a refreshing feeling of pleasure, which is very comfortable and comfortable.

Room Facilities:
Because the hotel opens early, I hope the hotel will strengthen some facilities, such as charging is not very convenient, and the toilet should be arranged intelligently, especially in winter, think about freezing pg.

Serve:
Every waiter will greet you warmly, respond to your needs, and feel very friendly. During the May Day period, the room is full, because yq has to provide a lot of things for check-in, but the check-in is relatively fast, which does not affect the good mood.

swimming pool:
The weather was too cold to experience it, so I soaked in the hot springs and slept well all night
It's a pity that the spa is not open. I hope to have the opportunity to experience it.

breakfast:
It is an order system. Because there is a big appetite, it is almost popular. I recommend yogurt fruit and Mediterranean set meal, and several omelettes are also good. Parents prefer Chinese and Indonesian fried rice, which are small and delicate, and will definitely be full (you don‚Äôt even need to eat lunch)

Cost-effective:
It seems that there is no price increase during the holidays this year, and I bought it in advance, so it is still very cost-effective, especially the experience of breakfast and afternoon tea. It is a hotel worth taking parents or couples to visit.

I was a little scared by this review before, but when I arrived at the hotel, everything was so quiet and beautiful, suitable for relaxation and pleasure. The hotel is very distinctive and highly private. The butler is available 24 hours a day to meet any small and trivial requirements. In summer, it takes good measures to deal with mosquito problems. In fact, there are mosquitoes in any tropical country, no wonder. Those who mind can come to the hot springs in winter. There are summer scenery features in summer. It feels great! Autumn worms and cicadas scream, gurgling water, really like a paradise. Moreover, the service staff are more caring and enthusiastic than any five-star hotel, and they never get bored. Including dishes, the dishes are exquisite and there are many choices. The catering can also be appropriately improved according to the requirements and cooked according to the taste of the guests. This is an experience I have never had before. In many cases, luxury hotels do a good job of western food, but the variety of Chinese food is hard to say. And here, all tastes can be taken into account, just a bowl of wontons are more authentic, very rare. Hygiene is also in place, very clean and comfortable, and the experience of staying in is better than that of the Lalu. Don't go to the Hanbi Building. The executive suites are expensive and worthless. The food in the room is pitiful. The cooling effect of the bedroom air conditioning is mediocre. The mosquitoes were fed all night. The friends who were traveling with us actually ate the authentic hometown food in Xiangzhang, and they were full of praise. Said to be the best experience of staying in several luxury hotels. The hot springs are available on demand, and it feels very good. Will come again later. Love this hotel. It's like talking to the sales manager about the problem in Ctrip's online review, and he promised: They will work hard. very sunny. Sure enough, the stay experience was very good! This price is really good value for money. If you don‚Äôt believe me, you can try to stay in other top-ranked luxury hotels here. The large-scale executive suites have only a few varieties of food delivered in the room, which is incomparable with this one.

The children are very satisfied. They are busy bringing their children. The photos, just these two photos, reflect a kind of quiet and peaceful time.

msg:The public area is very quiet, with verdant trees, calm and quiet. The facilities are really old, especially the view from the room is basically no. The room is quite big, the air conditioning is very good, the swimming pool is not clean, and the soup pool is dirty. It rained that day, there was no umbrella in the room, and there were only two bottles of mineral water in the huge room, so the service was not too fast to keep up. The restaurant is worthy of praise. Although the decoration of the restaurant is a bit dilapidated, the wild pond next to it is not to be seen, and there is a villa building that looks unfinished for a long time on the opposite side. The aspect is very satisfied. In terms of cost performance, this hotel is not recommended. Let's wait for the epidemic to end and go to Bali.

msg:It should be the fourth time I choose to live here. I can't go out due to the epidemic. I choose to take my child to spend two days in the hotel. The next room is very noisy in the middle of the night. , Shouting, according to regulations, fireworks are not allowed in the hotel yard, and calling the hotel to inform the hotel did not work. This experience is very poor. In addition, the restaurant service was delayed, not as good as when I came here before. I found a hair on the wonton skin after eating wontons in the morning, and informed the service staff. Overall there is room for improvement.

Since there are not many rooms in general, it doesn‚Äôt feel too crowded to be full. The outdoor public swimming pool has always been our family, and the children are very happy to play

msg:It should be the best hotel in Tangshan Hot Spring District. The hotel is small, with only 21 courtyards, and the environment is very quiet. Breakfast can be ordered at any time. It is delicious and can be eaten until after 13:00. There is afternoon tea after 13:00, so we did not eat lunch during our stay. The quality of the dinner is very good. The menu doesn't seem to have many choices, but I just ordered a few and it was amazing. If you don‚Äôt want to eat at the hotel, drive out to find a farmhouse. Black pork sausages, stewed chicken with ground pot, and yellow spicy dices are also delicious. We booked two bedrooms, a bubble pool, a hot spring, or a nap in the sun in the yard. It was very pleasant; free drinks in the refrigerator in the room and daily delivery of fruits. You must try the hotel‚Äôs homemade biscuits, which are crispy and fragrant. The service is very good. I can get the response as soon as I request it. In addition, I forgot my clothes on the delivery station. The staff took the initiative to call and express it home. Thank you very much. Go again in winter.
