The staff are helpful and professional, the rooms are comfortable and very nicely lit!  Their bar has some good beer on tap, which is not always easy to find in Xiamen. Also, if you stay on your birthday they give you some cake, which is thoughtful. I’m sure we’ll be back again many more times!

What an amazingly relaxing and enjoyable stay it was. The team members are exceptional.

Carrie especially gave wonderful advice on exploring the art districts, Bruce was swift with essential ferry information, and Jason was cheerful in sharing locations of coffee shops and parks. The Sheraton team are thoughtful and passionate, I was amazed by the warmth at this hotel.

Beautiful scenery surrounds the location and it is easy to arrive at the major destinations that many people come to Xiamen to see. The grounds, in which the hotel stands, are vibrant with plantations and trees, making the area a wonderful finishing point for evening walks. The rooms are inviting, clean and comfortable.

The facilities, overall, were much better than expected. There is a sauna, which was a surprise, I missed that detail in booking. Gym equipment is new and runs smoothly, it seems the pool is much enjoyed by families and solo people alike.

I did not eat at the hotel, but I could clearly see there is a great deal of choice on offer at the buffet breakfast.

When I revisit Xiamen I will gladly return to the Sheraton Xiamen.

msg:Sheraton Xiamen was an unexpected surprise on this trip!
Because it is an old hotel, a friend suggested that I change to another hotel. After actually staying there, I regretted not staying at the Sheraton for 4 consecutive nights! The service of the staff at the front desk and executive lounge was very good. They didn't communicate too much, but they were very considerate!
In terms of facilities, it is not as good as the recently opened hotels and is an old hotel, but it is a Sheraton after all, so even though it is old, the quality is still good!
The room has two bathrooms and a living room with good lighting. Children can do their homework here before going out to play, which is great!
When I first read reviews about the water temperature in the bathroom, it was said that the water temperature was not enough. I felt the same on the first night, but found out the next day that it was because I didn’t know how to operate it. The water temperature was actually okay. I adjusted the temperature on the right to 38°C and turned on the left to the maximum water volume. In this way, the water temperature was just right. good.
I felt a little stuffy when I first entered the room, so I asked the waiter to help open the window, and it was much better!
Finally, let’s talk about the Sheraton’s breakfast. I didn’t think it was that good during the two days I stayed. After I moved to another five-star hotel in Siming District for the next two days, I felt that the Sheraton’s breakfast was really good. There weren’t many varieties, but it should have been there. All of them!
Next time I come to Xiamen, I will definitely choose Sheraton. I hope Sheraton will make more money and renovate the old room😄

msg:I strongly complained to the male receptionist at around 8:30 pm on April 3.
I had read the guest reviews before, saying that they would arrange room number 4 first, and thought it was a coincidence. Today, I really encountered it. Without thinking, I was directly given room 1704. I raised questions (so many floors and rooms, can you give me a room without 4?), but he did not reflect on it and first argued that this was the only room on the 17th floor. After that, he solved the problem by "getting angry" and gave me room 1708.
He also questioned that the room I booked with breakfast was "wrong", meaning that I cheated. We booked hotels on the APP, so how could it be the customer's turn to cheat? If there is a chance to cheat, it is only the business that has the opportunity to cheat. I booked early, and it is very likely that I saw that the room rate at that time was higher than what I booked, and I felt that I lost money. Is this the style of a five-star hotel? ? ? ! ! ! There are other similar booking benefits, you don't ask, and never take the initiative to tell, ask a little, and tell a little, it is really a "good employee who saves money" for the hotel.
Breakfast: If you only look at the surface, it feels okay, there are many types (but it feels flashy), and the replenishment is also fast. However, when the breakfast is worth 168 yuan, it is not worth it. In addition, the canned fruit is scattered in a glass jar and then placed on ice. It ferments, has small bubbles, and tastes sour.
The hotel's buffet from Thursday to Sunday, dinner is 179. I can only suggest: if you have time to go out, you should eat outside. You will be disappointed. Many parts are similar or the same as breakfast.

In fact, problems with hotel facilities and catering do not necessarily make people feel dissatisfied. But the problem of service attitude is something that can be directly withdrawn and directly felt by residents.
Finally, I emphasize again: I strongly complain about the boy who received the front desk at around 8:30 pm on April 3! ! !

Check in and rest as soon as possible. This hotel will be my first choice for future trips.

1. There is not even the most basic data cable in the room, and there is none in the entire hotel. There is only a power bank that costs 7 yuan per hour in the lobby on the first floor.
2. The door of the bathroom can't be closed tightly, and there is a huge gap no matter how it is closed. On the first night of staying, I used the hand shower to shower the child with water, and the whole bathroom was covered with water. If you are not careful, you will slip and fall.
3. The design of the washbasin is very unreasonable. It takes a little longer to wash, and the entire countertop is covered with water. It is very difficult for children who are 1.2 meters fast to reach the faucet switch to wash.
4. In the lobby on the first floor, I don’t know whether it was the guest service depar**ent or which depar**ent of the hotel, Ms. Xu’s attitude in handling the problem was very uncomfortable, and she spoke forcefully and unreasonably.
I wanted to give my children a different sense of experience, so I came to Xiamen and stayed in several different hotels. In short, the Sheraton Xiamen Hotel is the hotel with the worst experience of staying, and it is also the hotel with the worst experience of staying in all regions of China during my business trips in recent years. , the only negative review of a hotel in so many years. If the negative review can also be rated, it must be the highest level negative review!

It is relatively close to the subway and supermarkets, making traveling and shopping more convenient.
The staff's service is very good. They can make service calls anytime if needed. Daily supplies are in stock. Check-in and check-out are very efficient. 👍🏻
The hotel's swimming pool and fitness equipment are also relatively clean. There is a cafeteria on the second floor. There is a lot of food not far downstairs, which is very convenient. Looking down from upstairs, the green plant coverage is also very high, making it more comfortable to live in.

msg:I booked it after looking at the Sheraton name, but I was 10,000 dissatisfied:
First, there was no greeter when getting off the bus, and the luggage was carried by oneself;
Second, the check-in service attitude at the front desk was not good. They directly arranged room 904, and only changed it after being refused, and said that other rooms were still being cleaned;
Third, while the front desk was processing, the sound of decoration upstairs was deafening and I couldn't hear clearly what I was saying. When I asked, it turned out that the third and fourth floors of the hotel were being decorated during the day, and it was so noisy;
Fourth, the heating in the room is too hot and the windows are closed, making it uncomfortable to stay there; you have to call customer service to open the windows for you, and you have to sign to open the windows; the room facilities are old and the experience is very poor, even to connect to wifi. Two customer service calls;
Fifth, the guest room corridor always smells of disinfectant, which is super unpleasant and makes me dizzy;
Sixth, there are few varieties of breakfast, the taste is mediocre, and the key service is not good. The noodle cook has to ask you three times before he pays attention to you. The specialty beef noodles are clearly listed on the sign. I cooked a bowl of rice noodles with clear rice. I asked the chef about the beef. Well, the master said you have to serve him the beef yourself! I said, why didn't you tell me earlier? He spoke very unpleasantly and I strongly complained to this master!
Seventh, I was asked to wait for check-out. Do I need to check the room?
Conclusion: Never choose this hotel when coming to Xiamen! too poor!

msg:I don’t know what will be held in Xiamen in the past few days, which makes the room very tight, making it difficult to book entry-level rooms in Xiamen! When I usually travel, I like to search on Ctrip 🔍. I happened to see that Sheraton Xiamen is very user-friendly and the price is very beautiful. I settled down with my partner without hesitation. I didn't expect the accidental choice, but it became a very good memory.
The young lady who checked in at the front desk was very enthusiastic, and the young man at the concierge was very friendly and helped to deliver the luggage to the room. The warmth of these staff made me feel extremely warm after being tired from the journey!
The next morning, because I had to go to the convention center to participate in the meeting, I went to eat very early. I didn't expect that the restaurant was already full at 7 o'clock in the morning! We found a place to sit in the Chinese dining area near the waiter. Although the weather was not as sunny as I imagined, the floor-to-ceiling windows looked across to an international kindergarten and elementary school. We could enjoy a rich breakfast quietly while watching To the energetic children! We really enjoyed it! breakfast! Absolute son! Marriott's is really trustworthy!
After a quick breakfast, I quickly called a car at 7:30. I thought it would take a long time to get to the conference center, but it took 20+ minutes to arrive!
I just want to say that it's too late to meet each other! I knew that I should choose this golden Sheraton Hotel when I came to Xiamen for business trips, trips, and meetings!

msg:As Ctrip's 17-year history, the first batch of diamond VIP members, I have always trusted Ctrip very much, but this time it was a mistake to book Sheraton Xiamen. I stayed in a senior suite for 3 days. Generally speaking, the performance of the hotel is poor in all aspects. Not only are the facilities relatively outdated, but also the hardware and software services are poor, and the price/performance ratio is extremely low. In a word, I spent thousands of dollars to live in a high-end suite, but the experience was poor. 1. The parking lot is small and the number is limited. Whether there is a parking space depends on luck. The hotel does not have on-site staff to help, even if you ask if you need to carry luggage? 2. It is very strange that there is no room when I check in at the store, and it is said that it is still being cleaned, not to mention that the hotel provides early check-in service. After negotiating with Ctrip customer service, I changed a room type and was told that it was an upgraded room type, but this room type belongs to The facilities are outdated, the kind that few people usually stay in, the curtains can't be drawn, the furniture is old, the drawers are not closed tightly, the lamps are broken, please see the picture; and because this room type is rarely used, the bathroom There are dirty things on the walls, please refer to the attached picture; 4. The hotel is extremely cost-effective, and the shampoos are all in large bottles like street stalls. It feels really bad, not like a star hotel; 5. There are few varieties of breakfast, and the restaurant is very It's small, messy, and the environment is not very good. The waiter is dumping garbage with big buckets around you. The scene is really ugly, so I won't post the picture. Those who don't believe it can go and see the big buckets for themselves. 6. During the renovation period, the exterior wall of the hotel was very noisy. After the protest, they only sent a fruit plate and said, our conditions are like this. To sum up, the Sheraton Xiamen Hotel is an old-fashioned hotel, with no luxurious appearance and no real connotation. Of course, I would like to express my gratitude to Ctrip's customer service. She is serious and responsible, communicates carefully, and finally overcomes the difficulties. This is the only bright spot of this order.

msg:An old money Sheraton with "story" and no "accident" 💰
I stayed in Xiamen for one night on a temporary business trip. In contrast, I chose Sheraton because it was the most cost-effective. Surprisingly, he gave me an experience that exceeded my expectations.
First of all, the service staff is very professional and reliable. From the front desk to the concierge to the guest room to the restaurant, all the service staff will remember you and provide services with your surname, making you feel that you are being cared for meticulously and respected politely. This is actually a requirement that I had never expected from Sheraton, and even some high-end hotels may not have such standard and considerate details, so although this time is short-lived, it made me feel unexpectedly warm.
Then come the guest rooms. Older hotels will inevitably leave some mottled "accidents" in the guest rooms, but fortunately, Sheraton's guest rooms only have "stories". Although the facilities are not up-to-date, it can be seen that they are carefully maintained and managed, including carpets and furniture, which are brand new and not old. The bedding is comfortable and the pillows can be obtained from the room service staff according to the needs. Even if you sleep on an unfamiliar bed, he can create a familiar sense of comfort for you.
Finally, there is one thing to praise, and that is the socket. 👍🏻Generally, the layout of sockets in such old money hotels will be limited by hardware, which cannot meet everyone’s charging needs, especially when going out, it is inevitable that you will forget this plug and which data cable. But the caring Sheraton has prepared multi-interface/three-dimensional sockets at the head of the bed to meet the charging needs of digital products with different devices and ports. It is sometimes a simple but rare thing to easily and conveniently charge at the bedside without looking for the hotel socket like hide-and-seek.
All kinds of experiences have left me with a deep impression on Sheraton. I believe that if I have the opportunity to stay for a long time, I will definitely have a different feeling. I look forward to my next stay!

msg:The facilities are outdated, the room is closed, there is not even a window for ventilation, there are not many varieties of breakfast, and the taste is average. The curtain design of the room makes it seem like a light ***** is installed after dawn, which affects sleep very much. The service attitude is very blunt. Take the children on the road. Arrived at the hotel after 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, because I forgot to bring my ID card, the hotel can't use the electronic ID card. The front desk only allows the husband and the child to go upstairs. I asked if I can settle the children first and then make up the certificate. I told them no, otherwise I would call in the middle of the night. The room reminded me and asked if I could give a pot of boiling water to make milk for the children. Answer: No boiling water! Q: Why doesn't the hotel even have a pot of boiling water? Answer: It's midnight now! (Isn’t it because it’s too late to ask for a convenience and order some boiled water?), and after a while, he said: Do you bring your own pot, bring it to us and fill it with what you drink for yourself... Love hotels don’t even have a pot No, since no service is provided in the middle of the night, why do you still accept guests, and just close the door to let the front desk staff sleep well!

1. The equipment is too old and the sound of the air conditioner is huge.
2. The smell is too strong after a long time.
3. The sound insulation effect is average
4. Before I checked out, an aunt came in to clean the room. I was taking a shower and rushed in, extremely angry.

It was originally a shelf of a luxury five-star hotel, but the mottled degree of facilities and furniture is visible to the naked eye... See pictures 7, 8, and 9. The towels in the bathroom are luxurious, but there is no brand of toiletries, so it can only be regarded as a high-end hotel, and the price is The price of an upscale hotel... .
The court yard hotel I lived in Bangkok, what will it look like in 2019, and the same in 2022, without any trace of time... I don't know how to do it... In comparison, it's a pity here.

The accommodation is still very comfortable, quiet, and the surrounding environment is also good. It takes 10 minutes to walk to SM shopping center, there are many restaurants, and the underground is Walmart... 5 minutes walk to test nucleic acid. very convenient.

msg:Worst Sheraton ever! Definitely recommend staying here! Never stay again!
The following questions will be sent to the customer service and complaint mailboxes of Sheraton and Marriott headquarters in Chinese and English by email. Hotel staff should not respond perfunctorily or whitewash here, otherwise there will be another one:
1. The room is old and poor
2. The service is very poor. I reported the problem to the front desk and lobby manager twice in two days but no one responded. The attitude is as arrogant as we are.
3. There was no service staff in the lobby bar. I waited until someone was around and asked for soda water (usually canned, so there is no need to make it on site). It was not delivered until I finished talking to my friends fifty minutes later, let alone Any lobby bar staff came and asked about it
4. There is no one to guide the corridor between the Chinese meals and the Western meals in the breakfast room. It is a mess. After having breakfast, I don’t want to go there anymore, even if it includes breakfast. I would rather eat breakfast outside.
5. The breakfast room used cheap disposable coffee cups that could not be sealed at all, causing coffee to spill all over the body, and I almost went back to the room to wash my clothes, which almost made things worse.

The landline receiver in the living room is silent and can only be hands-free, the wallpaper in the bathroom is slightly flying, which reduces the score a bit, and the hardware facilities are outdated, but it does not affect the experience.

msg:This hotel has been dark for a lifetime, and twice opened the door of my room without permission. I was taking a nap on the first day of check-in. The waiter rang the doorbell and didn’t ask if anyone was there. I was dazed before the waiter opened the door and came in. When someone went out again, I got up and asked what was going on and who opened it. At the door, the clerk said that someone had applied for repairs and it might not be this house. I just assumed that they made a mistake and endured it. The next morning, another waiter knocked on the door. Who am I asking? She asked if there were any clothes to be washed. At this time, she knew that there was someone in the house. I said no, but she opened the door directly and came in again. Even if she didn't hear the second sentence, should I ask again? What does it mean to just open the door and come in? Really served, I have never seen anything like this before.

1. 承諾達不到，説是一個小時可以入住，結果一個小時去了以後還要繼續等；
2. 房間太小，定的時候看房間是40平米，結果進去以後是個不規則的20平米小房間，兒子進去以後第一句是這個酒店也太可憐了。關鍵是不規則，很難受。在攜程的幫助下終於在換個一個規則的稍微大一點的房間。
3. 房間電話是壞的，聯繫不到前台。
4. 好的地方是床品比較舒服，位置便利。
5. 後來在離開的時候發現讓酒店幫忙拿到前台的行李箱也壞了，也不好説追究酒店什麼責任，總之就是不太順利吧。
