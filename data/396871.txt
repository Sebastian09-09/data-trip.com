When I arrived at the store, he also ran out to greet me and guided me to the elevator entrance. Thank you for your hard work!
The hotel's sanitation and facilities are very good. Here I would also like to make a small suggestion. I hope that a place for toiletries can be installed in the shower room, otherwise it is really inconvenient to bend down to get things on the ground.
It is recommended to book an executive courtesy. The selection of food and wine is very good. It is a good place for Happy Hour.
This time I was too busy, so I solved the food in the hotel. First of all, the breakfast in the hotel is good. I also tried the two restaurants in the hotel. The crab roe porridge in the Chinese restaurant must be tried

msg:I am usually very busy at work and rarely have time to travel with my parents. I finally have the opportunity to take my parents out for a walk during this May Day holiday. Due to the weather, I was unable to go to a farther place, but chose Guangzhou.

In the past, Guangzhou was always a transit station for business trips or tourism, and I never had a good time in Guangzhou, so this should be the first time I took my parents to travel in Guangzhou. This hotel is also one that I carefully selected based on the itinerary. I didn’t expect the experience from before check-in to check-out to be completely beyond my imagination!

Since the hotel knew the purpose of my trip in advance, they took the initiative to contact me the day before to upgrade the room type for me (very good!). Fancy at the front desk was patient and efficient when checking in, and I also want to give her a thumbs up! After arriving in the room, both the hardware facilities and hygiene were done very well, and the service level and quality of the hotel waiters were also beyond reproach! Of course, the most important thing is that my parents are satisfied, and I will definitely continue to choose this hotel next time I come to Guangzhou!

There are plenty of USB charging sockets in the room, which is convenient and user-friendly.
There is PILLOW MENU where you can choose the pillow that suits you.

The housekeeping staff even found out that I drink coffee every day, so they put some extra coffee capsules in the bag so that I could drink it with peace of mind😀

Although the hotel's catering is not yet complete, the scenery is almost non-existent, and the young service staff's response is a bit ****y. But you can feel the attitude of the other party trying to provide good service. In addition, the old central location just across the road from Beiyuan Restaurant can definitely be a reason to stay here again next time.

The suite we stayed in was very large, equipped with a large refrigerator, washing machine, microwave, and even an oven and range hood. It was just like an apar**ent. You could even start a meal directly after buying ingredients. There is a Hema Fresh Food next door. The room decoration is simple and bright, and the furniture is mainly walnut color.

msg:To be honest, the last hotel I chose was Hilton.
The location, environment and service are both good, but it's not particularly quiet on the street. There is a lot of traffic noise at night.
The focus is on hygiene, which is really not good. After staying here for one night, when I woke up the next day, my child’s head and neck were covered with red envelopes. At first, I thought it was mosquito bites. I told the front desk that mosquito repellent was immediately sent to me. I also asked to change the bed sheet and quilt cover on the second night, but then the swelling became bigger and bigger, and some even became suppurative. During those two days, the baby couldn't sleep well at night. He tossed and turned and tried to scratch. Later, he returned and went to the hospital to see a doctor who said it was suspicious. It was caused by mites or fleas. Because the head and face are more sensitive than the hands and feet, almost all of them were on the head. After applying the medicine, I found that there were two on the hands. Because the child's skin is already sensitive, the fingers were also swollen. , although the hotel also actively dealt with it after learning about this incident: it helped decorate the room and put a lot of dolls, and asked if we wanted to buy medicine for the child, but we refused. After checking out, they contacted us to say that they wanted to send medicine to the child. Fruit asked not to leave negative reviews, but in the end it was nothing.
I am giving a negative review because to be honest, traveling with children is tiring enough in itself. If your children suffer unnecessary suffering due to hygiene problems or other problems, then you are indeed paying for the suffering. This The sanitary conditions are sorry for my room charge of 5,000+ for two nights.

msg:Just opposite Yuexiu Park and very close to Beiyuan Restaurant. The hotel is very new, the lobby, restaurant and rooms are well decorated. It would have been a very good experience. But there was a big flaw. In room 2007, there was a strong smell in the toilet sewer. There was a peculiar smell before going to bed at night. Because we were only staying for one night, I didn't want to bother with it. I imagined that the smell might dissipate later, but the smell got worse and worse in the middle of the night. It didn't help to close the bathroom door. I slept in the smell all night. When I woke up in the morning, I immediately called the guest service center and sent an engineer to check. They said that the drain was not sealed and the smell came back, so I asked the front desk to change rooms. We have to go out next, and the whole night has passed, and I don’t know what the point of changing rooms is. Then the engineer left, and the guest service center didn't even make a return visit. After checking out, the front desk didn't mention it again. I don’t know if the engineer has reported back the problem with the 2007 room, let alone whether the hotel will continue to assign such a room to the next guest.

msg:I booked a hotel just before departure. It turned out that it was an old hotel that had been renovated, so I was a little uneasy, but after three nights, I felt very good.

Service: I received a call from the hotel soon after booking. I asked carefully what my requirements were, and added a WeChat message to inform the hotel that we had booked two rooms at the same time and hoped to arrange them on the same floor and a quiet floor. These hotels have I did it. The people who were traveling with me on the last night were a little uncomfortable and asked if they could delay check-out at one of them. The hotel quickly coordinated and helped with the delay for a long time, so that people who were unwell could get a good rest. It was really Thank you very much.

Environment: Every detail and decoration of the hotel can be seen with great care, retaining many Lingnan characteristics while still maintaining a sense of modern fashion. Unfortunately, the swimming pool is not open yet, and there is no time to visit the rooftop garden. The hotel is very clean. I didn’t even use the bedding I brought with me. I slept very comfortably. I used a Dyson hair dryer. What’s special is that the room has its own induction cooker. One night I packed soup and it got cold. I couldn't drink it, so the hotel borrowed a pot from the restaurant and I could heat it in the room, which was very convenient. I personally like the toothbrush cup in the hotel, I think I took it home haha.

Location: Opposite the hotel is the east gate to Yuexiu Park. Walking 100 meters away is the famous Beiyuan Restaurant, which is convenient for queuing and eating there is not bad. We all travel by taxi. The hotel is not far from various attractions and Internet celebrity restaurants. It’s too far. Unfortunately, I went out to have morning tea this time when I went to Guangzhou, so I didn’t order breakfast or try the hotel’s own restaurant. I’ll try it again next time I come to Guangzhou.

Overall, I am very satisfied with my stay this time. The hotel's environment and service make people feel very warm. Finally, I would like to make a small suggestion. As a star hotel, the welcome fruits in the room are a bit too simple. The minibar should also have drinks. This is better. I will choose to stay here next time I come to Guangzhou and recommend it to my friends.

The room is spacious and bright, the facilities are well-equipped and relatively new, and the bedding feels comfortable. The room is equipped with a washing machine (without dryer), and laundry beads can be requested from the room attendant. There is an induction cooker, but no kitchen supplies. There is a capsule coffee machine and 2 capsules are provided daily, but there is no coffee cup in the room, and the size of the water cup is not suitable for the coffee machine! It is an 8-9 minute walk from Metro Line 5. The porter in the lobby will take the initiative to help guests stop their cars and carry their luggage. The hotel's breakfast is great, but the price is a bit high, more than 180 per person including service charge. Overall, the hotel is good. If you want to stay in the old town in the city center, it is worth recommending!

Advantages: The service is very good, from the door to the front desk, there is nothing to fault, especially the managers Peter and Steven, they can be called kneeling service! I had oral ulcers and asked Steven about it. He also bought me some watermelon cream, which I really appreciate.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good, opposite Yuexiu Park, the transportation is relatively convenient, and there are many restaurants in the old town. The hotel facilities are similar to those of a serviced apar**ent. There are refrigerators, washing machines, and induction cookers. If you need to do laundry, please ask the front desk. The staff will also enthusiastically send you laundry beads, which is very convenient for families with babies. There is a certain distance from the bed to the door, so it is relatively quiet. When I left the store, I left my hat in the lobby. After calling me, I thanked Xiao Zhou for picking it up in time and sending it home for me. If there is anything that needs improvement, it's probably that the air conditioner outlet is a little louder. It's my personal experience, but it doesn't affect my sleep.
Thank you to the staff who called us. They have a handsome smile. The greeting boys and girls are very enthusiastic. They will remind you to put on clothes when the temperature outside is cooling down. Very heartwarming. Thank you for your service and wish you all a Happy New Year in advance! !

本次入住期間，唯一認為需要改進迎賓服務。五星酒店配備在大堂門口的門僮或保安，不應該看到客人在上下車時幫忙拿下行李嗎？兩次都是視而不見的走開了。除了這點，其他都OK

住了廣州的桔子，雅詩閣，還去了一家全季沒住，都和其他城市的同樣連鎖品牌服務差太多了，真的是沒人整頓一下廣州服務業嘛？

這家的服務還是很好的，到店當天看到公告説有裝修，前台小姐姐給了一個離裝修的頂樓較遠的房間，完全沒聽到聲音。停車也方便。還有小哥幫拿行李。
