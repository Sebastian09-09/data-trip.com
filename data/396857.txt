Because one of the hotels had a late flight departure time, we were given a delayed room. The location is also good. You can walk to the nearby Merrill Lynch, Sam's, IKEA, and movie theaters. The most important thing is that it is convenient to travel by subway.

However, the price was adjusted to more than 1,500 on Monday. The travel expenses were seriously exceeded! ! ! It’s such a scam. I decided to change hotels and will never book this hotel again.

msg:I booked a twin room. It was clearly marked as two 1.35-meter beds. After checking in, I found that the bed was very narrow. It may be a 90cm bed. Whether adults or children turn over while sleeping, they will fall off the bed to a large extent. After feedback from the hotel, the manager on duty came to negotiate with us. First, he said that there was a shortage of room types during the Spring Festival. Later, he said that this is not a 90cm bed, but a 1.1m bed. I was completely speechless? ? ? ? Can 1 meter 1 be forgiven? I think this behavior can be judged as fooling consumers.
Later, the room change moved us from the 20th floor (high-level, I can’t remember the exact 20th floor) to the 8th floor. I told me that there was no way, let me understand. I didn’t understand. Why did the hotel’s negligence require consumers to compromise? Even though the manager later proposed to give us breakfast and welcome fruit in the room, I told him that because it was the Spring Festival and the elderly also needed to rest, I moved to the 8th floor first, but I was very dissatisfied with the result this time. As a brand under the Marriott Group, the behavior of secretly changing beds to deceive consumers and the subsequent behavior of facing complaints is really embarrassing.

msg:Unfortunately, I have to write a negative review of the hotel with 0 points. While I tried to remain objective in my writing, this review is truly based on my deep personal dissatisfaction and disappoin**ent.
This hotel is located in the city center, the price is not low, and the facilities on display are also very complete. However, the actual check-in experience was unacceptable.
In terms of hygiene, I can only describe it as "terrible". The bathroom in my room was very dirty and there were even creatures that looked like cockroaches living near the wash basin. The sheets and towels not only look unclean, they feel so too.
In terms of service, I can only say that it does not match the price of this hotel at all. The attitude of the employees is cold, even aloof. When I asked for help with a problem, they simply responded without providing any substantive solutions.
As for the facilities, I can only say that some things are just decorations. During my stay, the hotel's hot water system seemed to be out of order and unable to provide hot water. Additionally, the air conditioning in my room was extremely poor and the temperature inside was too high even on cooler days.
In terms of value for money, I don't think it's worth staying here at all. While the facilities at this hotel may be better than some others, based on my personal experience, I feel the price totally outweighs the level of service.
Overall, I was very disappointed with this hotel in every aspect. I absolutely do not recommend this hotel to anyone. If I had to give an overall rating, I think I would give it a 0 because it completely exceeded my expectations. I hope the hotel will take these issues seriously and improve to provide better service to future guests.

msg:Manager Xu in the hotel lobby has an arrogant and bad attitude. I left my ID card in the hotel, and when I came back from the trip to get my ID card, I encountered:
1. Informed that the ID card has been taken away by someone else, and the whole family is traveling, who took it away? Manager Xu replied that he wanted to check the monitoring.
2. When issuing the invoice, I asked to check whether the ID card was still there. Manager Xu responded provocatively, do you want to issue an invoice or check the ID card? There are obviously 4 people doing nothing at the front desk, how is it managed.
3. After staying in the hotel for more than 10 days, the amount for one day was only issued when the invoice was issued. The guest said that the amount was less, and he even said to the guest: Why didn’t you say that you will issue all the bills, and then said that you need to verify before opening, We just have to eat first.
4. After dinner, when I came back, the manager surnamed Xu told me that the ID card was found again, and that it was put in other clothes. I just wanted to ask, what does it mean to be inconsistent? Can't the hotel even keep the guest's ID card?
5. With the ID card and invoice, the customer can go twice. The manager surnamed Xu never took the initiative to say sorry from the beginning to the end, and his attitude was very bad. He had an attitude of nothing to do with himself, and finally left and said twice "I don't own the hotel." Is Sheraton blind for a manager of this quality?

msg:I have been staying at the Sheraton Hotel all the time, but the experience of staying this time was the worst! 1. I have already paid on Ctrip, and when I arrived at the hotel at night, I was told that there are only Unicom room types, which is very unsafe for a girl to go out alone. There have been no other room types, and it took half an hour to find a room. 2. The check-in experience was very bad. It was already past 12 o'clock in the middle of the night when I checked in. The foreign friends next door kept making loud noises. 3. When I checked in the next night, I found that there was no trash can in the bathroom? Because I thought that the waiter might be negligent, I didn't call the front desk. Thinking about it, it's not easy to work now. Don't let people lose their jobs because of my complaint! Who knew that after checking out the room the next day, I received a call from the hotel in the afternoon, asking me if I saw the trash can? The meaning is so obvious that I took the trash can away! May I ask you, as a 5-star hotel, you have the liberty to make such a phone call without seeing the probe yourself and knowing all the facts. Do you think this is how you treat your guests? The waiter on the phone said, please don't make comments based on facts, and help you upgrade the room next time? Or treat yourself to a buffet. Is this your public solution and method of dealing with problems?

The security in the ba*****t is fierce, and the ba*****t is dirty, not as clean as the Marriott or Sheraton Hotel in Shenzhen. There are very few parking spaces, all with license plates on them, and no parking is allowed. I arrived at the lobby at 15:30 and checked in and told me that there was a room available for half an hour. Understandably, the same would happen in Shenzhen on weekends. The room is sanitary and clean. But there was a single stone slab pressed on the floor in the bathroom, which looked weird. After watching the concert, I found that the hair dryer couldn't hold it, and it fell off automatically when I removed it. The configuration is not as good as the hotel in Shenzhen, but after all, the price is cheap and close to the Olympic Sports Center. Basically satisfied, it can be better, after all, it is a chain hotel😂

The front desk feels inexperienced, and has always read out the full name of the guest directly instead of saying Mrs. and Mrs. Privacy, but everyone is concerned about it at the moment.
I chose to order in the room for breakfast, the taste is really average.

There were parking spaces that were not allowed to enter. They said they were full. Finally, they were allowed to enter. There were at least a dozen parking spaces. At that time, I asked the front desk and said that the parking lot staff was in an office building. The ground of their hotel said it was a temporary parking lot, but I probably stayed in this hotel for about two months before and after, but I didn’t stop once. It was either full, or even if there were parking spaces, the staff would talk to me. I said that it’s not possible to stop here, then I’m surprised. Others can stop, but I can’t. There is no way to stay in Huangpu. The hotel’s environmental sanitation is better. There is no second choice when traveling on business.

msg:The location is average, there are not many restaurants near the hotel.
The swimming pool is very small and has not reached half of the standard. More than three people in the water are obviously crowded.
The room attendant was very rude in the evening. When delivering the items to the room, he obviously looked into the room and left without saying goodbye.
The floors are low and there are no night scenes at all.
