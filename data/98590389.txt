msg:Nice & clean room with big TV screen but at low floor. 
Occupancy was low on the day and check-in staff appeared not paying notice to clients' request and didn't give out the free coupon for access to the small nearby farm despite such item had been included at booking.
Liked particularly the provision of a seating bench inside shower cubicle which seems rare in other places.
Food choices for breakfast are plenty and spacious for circulation between dining tables.

The hotel is nestled in the up-and-coming Nansha District of Guangzhou, offering a blend of modern luxury and local charm. From the moment I stepped in, the cleanliness and comfort of the hotel stood out. The rooms are well-appointed with thoughtful amenities, and the staff went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable. The swimming pool is great, complemented by a beautiful garden and terrace. There are also lots of great places for cycling and walking alongside the river estuaries, just outside the hotel.

From Leila who consulted about the check-in, the young gentleman who checked me in, the restaurant staff who took good care of the elderly in wheelchairs during breakfast, the attentive room attendant, to Sisi who asked about the check-in experience when checking out, all of them showed the service software of a five-star hotel. In terms of hardware, I fully experienced the swimming pool. There were not many people swimming every day. It was clean and comfortable.

The room is quite large and the stay is very good. The breakfast variety is also quite rich, and the waiter collects the plates in time. In addition, the environment here is very good, close to Jiaomen River, standing in the room, you can see the river view, and you feel great when you wake up. I would like to thank LEILA in particular. I called in the morning to inquire about the breakfast time and was able to clearly inform the deadline and dining location.

Check-in time is long: arrived at the hotel at 2:30, checked in at 4:00, because it was raining, we couldn't go out to play, we could only sit in the hotel lobby
There is a yard in the hotel to raise small animals, which is charged at 68/3 people. I don't think it's worth it. I didn't go in and took a photo through the glass;
Tourist attractions: Went to Million Sunflower Garden and South Waterfront Cape Park. The former is like a park with some large amusement facilities, and almost no equipment is running when it rains; the latter is a seaside corridor smaller than Seagull Island
Eating: There is no food near the hotel, and you can park anywhere, which is great; we drove the navigation to Youfang Tiandi, there are many delicious foods there, not many people, and it is quite quiet!

Marriott's products are still reliable. In order to cope with the large number of tourists during the May 1st holiday, a buffet breakfast area was specially set up on the first floor of the opposite building. Every employee is very patient and smiling to provide services to guests. There are also three projection screens in the small hall of the breakfast area. Children will not run around while eating breakfast and watching cartoons. It is very considerate.
Every time I travel, especially with children, I will choose a brand hotel, just to ensure the hygiene of service facilities. The last time I stayed at Shenzhen Qianhai JW Marriott was also a great experience. The hard-working hotel practitioners on the front line.
Uncle Mark's farm is a bit tasteless. It was finished in less than 10 minutes. It smelled big and was small. The indoor swimming pool is good, and the lifeguard is very professional. A child accidentally turned over the lifebuoy he brought with him. The lifeguard immediately jumped down and grabbed it. Witness this thrilling scene with your own eyes🤙

Disadvantages:
1) The faucet switch in the shower room was turned to the left for the handle shower, and turned to the right for the head shower. But there was no eye-catching sign, and we were soaked, which was very embarrassing;
2) When I first booked the room, I booked a breakfast-inclusive package, but not long after, Ctrip called me and said that the breakfast was a simple meal, not a buffet breakfast, and asked me to cancel the order and book another one without breakfast. But after I actually checked in, I found that there was a buffet breakfast. I don’t know why Ctrip had such an operation before;
3) There is nothing to visit outside the hotel, which is a bit regrettable

Fortunately, I applied for additional executive benefits to avoid the long queue for breakfast. Linyuan Chinese Restaurant has an elegant environment, exquisite dishes, fresh ingredients, delicious soups, and thoughtful service. The only problem is that the children's center can only be opened on weekends and holidays, which reduces the baby's happiness. The hair dryer in the room can be upgraded.

The front desk service was very good, and there are very good private dishes around. There is a greenway beside the river, and it is really comfortable to take a walk in the sea breeze in the evening. I will definitely come again next time

msg:I haven’t had such a good family hotel experience in a long time. On Friday, I made an impromptu decision to take my children to a hotel for the weekend. I specially picked one with a small zoo downstairs, and it only takes 45 minutes to get from downtown Guangzhou.
Free upgrade to a suite, facing the river view, contact the room in advance to prepare a crib, and capsule coffee. The family had a very comfortable stay.
The hotel self-service group purchase is 500+ for two people, which is good value for money.
The only thing that needs improvement is that the floor tiles in the bathroom and in front of the bathtub are slippery, and children who are active can easily fall.

When I came back in the lobby in the evening, I saw the manager on duty who greeted us warmly. He asked us which floor we were staying in and helped us carefully check which floor we were staying in before leaving. The service was great. The newly opened Huanyu City in Nansha is about 5 minutes' drive from the hotel, which is very convenient. Staying at the Nansha Marriott this time is a 100% experience!

The view from the room is very good, and you can also see the fireworks on the other side on New Year's Eve, which is an unexpected surprise. The food and beverage offerings at Fisherman's Wharf and the Executive Lounge are both good, but the variety is a bit lacking. It can only be said that it has everything it should have, but there are not many surprises. The New Year's Eve concert in the open-air garden has a great view and a**osphere, but letting children go up and make wheat balls ruins the a**osphere. It may be better to just play the music.

  Before check-in, the hotel receptionist informed me and gave me a free upgrade to a bay-view twin room and a two-day executive wine package in advance. Let us feel that Marriott has the taste of a Golden Diamond Hotel.
   When checking in at noon, the lady at the front desk was smiling and polite. She walked out of the counter and handed me my room card and ID card. She also introduced the breakfast, executive lounge, and gym floors and times in detail. If necessary, you can always call the general manager at 0. tower. I felt so happy at this moment and couldn’t help but praise the star service of the five-star hotel 👍. I deeply felt that the "courtesy" I received when I checked in was worthy of praise [strong][strong]
  The hotel only opened last year. The room facilities are fresh and bright, clean and tidy, with reasonable layout, fast air conditioning and hot water. Sit by the window and enjoy the sea view of Nansha.
  Fisherman's Wharf Chinese Restaurant has Chinese and Western delicacies with many varieties. The Western snacks taste good and the Chinese Silver Noodle Soup is of good quality. We’ll go on vacation again if we have the chance [strong][strong][smile][smile]

I originally thought that this hotel was mainly for families, but I didn’t expect that it would become my best domestic hotel experience in 2023 (the injuries I suffered at the InterContinental were healed here) ~).
💜From the meticulous call to confirm the reservation, the value-added surprise of upgraded bay view room type and complimentary breakfast, to the friendly and efficient confirmation of late check-out, the hotel service team has indeed exceeded expectations~
💜The room is simple and low-key without losing the sense of design, which meets the needs of people traveling and taking exams like me (the small coffee table behind the dining table can be used to place surveillance phones, and the distance is just perfect~) The next morning, I opened the curtains and took in an overview The view of the bay after the sky cleared was a relief that you can't experience by looking at photos~ I have to praise how clean it was, which allowed me to sleep well and almost overslept and missed the exam~
💜The hotel's supporting facilities are also fully functional, including lobby bar, gym, and buffet restaurant. I feel that STAYCATION will be very suitable~
💜The complimentary breakfast is full of thoughtfulness and exquisite categories. It is not easy to find my favorite hotel breakfast~ During the meal, I have already planned to find time to try the buffet dinner at Fisherman’s Wharf~

Overall, I would recommend my friends to stay here~ There are no fancy or frivolous things, it’s a very practical and cost-effective accommodation experience~

msg:I just want to find a beautiful vacation spot with my friends and family.
Take a leisurely stroll
Find a hotel with good quality, complete facilities and good value for money
Make parents and children happy
We have found such a destination!
Right here, we are surrounded by three major natural resources: ocean, wetland and forest.
From the exterior to the interior, Guangzhou Nansha Marriott Hotel is dominated by smart and smooth lines, echoing the unique maritime culture of Nansha!
❤️In the lobby, there is a huge sail
❤️Chinese restaurant, integrated with Cantonese opera style
You can see it everywhere: phoenix crowns, silk thread patterns on costumes, pipa strings
There is also the famous Cantonese opera actress's action of lifting her sleeves...
❤️The Western restaurant is the characteristic of local fishing culture
Water-patterned glass, fishnet metal screens, rattan furniture...
❤️The guest room is large and mainly decorated with warm warm wood colors
Equipped with large floor-to-ceiling windows, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery outside the window.
The guest room hides “black technology”
❤️Ecological smart guest room
Quiet, constant temperature, constant humidity, no wind, the bedding and pillows are very comfortable, you can lie down and fall asleep instantly
Each room is equipped with a large bathtub and separate shower area
Brand-specific bedding, high-end accessories, etc. The premium bay view room we booked faces Nansha Pearl Bay, with a wider view and wider view!

❤️The buffet dinner brings together delicious food!
Jiwei shrimp, sixty-year-old king, three-eyed crab, razor clam king...
A variety of seafood,
Thick-cut salmon, snapper, tuna, and ample sashimi
Open kitchen
Beef and mutton chops, Yangcheng honey barbecued pork, Huadu charcoal roast duck, grilled fish...
Made on site, the aroma is overflowing with oil
There are also signature Cantonese noodle soup, fried food, pizza, etc.
The dessert area is even more dazzling.
Cakes, mousses, seasonal themed fruit cakes...

️There are many varieties of breakfast, the ingredients are fresh and high-quality, there are many varieties, the products are beyond imagination, and friends of all ages praise it!

❤️I love the fitness center in the hotel!
We swam in the constant-temperature swimming pool and enjoyed the beautiful scenery of Nansha. We swam with my daughter for two hours. We also sweated on the treadmill and spinning bike in the gym and exercised happily!

❤️❤️❤️We are very lucky that the hotel upgraded us to a premium river view suite with an area of ​​80 square meters. The super large bar is equipped with a capsule coffee machine, and the super large bathroom also has a Dyson hairdryer! Taking a hot bath in a bathtub with a river view is so stress-relieving!

❤️When you stay in the "breathing house" landscape guest room, the design is modern and simple, with large areas of warm wood veneer as the main color and blue as the embellishment, making it warm and comfortable. Photos cannot capture the beauty of the real scene! The room temperature is uniform, there is no feeling of wind, and the room has constant temperature and humidity. The air is kept fresh at all times, making people's body and senses feel comfortable and relaxed.

❤️❤️❤️The seven-star service of all hotel staff makes our family feel super warm. They serve every customer with sincerity, love and heart. They are responsive to requests and are polite and feel like a spring breeze. They make people feel at home. This is the best experience for us. There is no such thing as a good hotel. Thank you to all Nansha Marriott people for their hard work! We will definitely come back often!

msg:My wife and I went to Nansha Marriott for a vacation because it was my birthday and it was a good experience.
The surrounding environment is relatively quiet and not far from the subway station.
I have stayed in many hotel brands, and the variety and varieties of the evening buffet are worth the price, and the oysters are particularly good. The breakfast buffet tastes good too.
The room equipment is quite satisfactory. What is particularly worthy of praise is the service attitude of the hotel staff, which greatly enhances my impression of the Marriott brand!

msg:It was my first time to go to Nansha, and I was very happy to meet the staff of Nansha Marriott.

Service: The front desk service attitude is very good and enthusiastic. I am very grateful to Christy Lv for her enthusiastic service and upgrading my room. I had a wonderful weekend and a wonderful hotel experience at the Marriott.

Cleanliness: Very satisfied, the room is very tidy.

Environment: The hotel is very close to the city center and travel is very convenient.

Facilities: The hotel has complete facilities, including a gym, sauna and swimming pool. The upgraded suite has one bedroom and one living room, the bedding is very comfortable, and the bathtub is very large.

The hotel's dinner buffet is very good and very cost-effective. There is one hairy crab per person and all-you-can-eat oysters. There are many kinds. The abalone rice tastes very good.

Uncle Martin's Farm Ticket: The package purchased includes Uncle Martin's Farm. There are quite a lot of small animals on the farm, and each person can feed the small animals with a blue carrot. Although the farm is relatively small, it is quite interesting and suitable for children to play.

Breakfast: The hotel breakfast is also very rich, which suits our appetite very much. It would be better if we can add some drink varieties next time.

msg:1. I “escaped” during the National Day rush and came to the Nansha Marriott. It was a very correct choice. The hotel is very new and the hotel’s services are also very online. With a two-year-old baby, I almost spent all my time exploring the hotel on the first day when I checked in, but it was okay. The itinerary is fully arranged.
2. Chinese restaurant - Linyuan's food is good and the environment is also very good. The beef fried rice is unexpectedly delicious. It would be better if the lard crumbs and cabbage heart could have less oil.
3. I would like to thank the two service staff at the front desk. The package ticket for Uncle Martin's Farm needs to be used within 24 hours. This information platform did not inform me. I went to the family more than 24 hours after extending my stay and did not know that I paid twice. I went to the front desk. Asked about the solution and it was solved very efficiently. (There is an older manager who allowed me, a former hotelier with a wine management major, to see the processing power and professionalism of professional hoteliers. Thank you)
4. The only pity is that as a guest, I couldn't eat the hotel's buffet dinner for two days, which was very popular. However, because families with children actually rely heavily on the hotel’s food and beverages, I hope that next time we can inform customers in advance when they check in to remind them to book as early as possible, so as not to be disappointed when they are told that they are fully booked after two days~~
5. Will come again! I also like the Marriott brand even more from now on! Thank you for making our National Day trip to Heahea with our children possible

The room is very spacious and has a living room. The highlight is the bathroom, which can be accessed from both sides of the bedroom. Fruit was also given, and the breakfast was another reason to recommend staying at the hotel. It was extremely rich!
The front desk staff are very enthusiastic and all of them are pretty girls! Name and praise "Emilee, Yana, Antares" for their hard work, caring for customers, and being trustworthy! Christy should be the manager. She is very professional, smiles and talks very kindly. If you meet her when you check in, she might be able to upgrade your room for you!

The breakfast products are also satisfactory, and the manager will also carefully come over to ask about the dining experience, so that the guests can feel valued. There are two suggestions for reference: First, since there is no hook in the shower room, you have to come out naked to wipe and change clothes after taking a shower. If you are not staying with a close lover, it is a bit inconvenient. The second is that some waiters at the front desk need to improve their professionalism. They should not stand up, turn their pens or interrupt at will when other waiters are assisting guests to check in.

The restaurant is not big and does not match the size of the hotel. During peak hours, you have to wait for a seat for about 30 minutes. The variety is rich, and the restaurant's warm and considerate service can make up for the dissatisfaction with waiting for a seat;
As a five-star hotel, the room facilities are no different from ordinary homestays. The toilet and shower are located on both sides of the entrance, which is very inconvenient to use. You can see the toilet while lying on the bed. It feels like sleeping in the bathroom. This kind of weird design is no one else. ;The washbasin has cracks and has not been replaced; the shower gel hanging on the wall is too high, it is inconvenient to use, the visual is low-end, and the quality is low; The most unsatisfactory thing is that the pillow has no support at all, and the neck hurts when I wake up. The quilt is hard and airtight and does not stick to the skin. quality

msg:Anyway, I spent more than 1,200 to book a room for one night. I wanted to take a shower and found that the toilet was like this. There were traces of blood stains left, it was very dirty, and it scared the children. I lost my mood. The most basic washing so. Spend the money of a five-star hotel but not enjoy the service and standard of a five-star hotel room. Then the handling attitude after the complaint is to shirk responsibility to the supplier and there is no compensation measure, and it has been dealt with for more than 48 hours. The attitude of the last room service is not bad, but I keep saying I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can't achieve the hotel management level of a five-star hotel. Really sorry for the price. Not as good as five or six hundred four stars

msg:We are traveling as a family of seven and we have communicated in advance that we need to arrange rooms on the same floor and the customer service has agreed, but it will still be a room on one floor. So what is the role of prior communication?
The front desk is as small as an express hotel, and it is better not to have instructions to the Linyuan opposite. If not, it would be clearer if I ask directly. Lin Yuan is not on the 3rd floor and it must be written on the elevator button. There is no way to go to the 3rd floor by pressing the directions.
It is inconvenient to go out to eat and buy things, and there is no geographical advantage. The farm that is the selling point is actually privately managed and requires additional charges. I don't understand the pricing and positioning of the hotel.

msg:Since it was the day before New Year's Day, we couldn't accommodate a few more guests (in fact, there were far less people than on May Day), so we were suddenly rushed to the 15th floor for breakfast. The key was that there was nothing to eat (not as good as a hotel in a third-tier city) ), the bacon was as hard as a rock, and it was gone in the blink of an eye. Finally, I ate a small hard bread and an egg, just to keep myself from being hungry! What's even more exaggerated is that the room requires 2 bottles of water, but half of them are delivered to you. The management is chaotic enough! The air conditioner was very loud and set at 21 degrees. I slept until I was sweating. It was an indescribable feeling! In short, any hotel in Nansha at this price is better than this one.

I had to pack a cup of coffee and go back to the room. Really powerless.

In terms of hygiene, it is also very clean, and every corner is kept tidy and comfortable. Regarding the environment, the scenery is very beautiful.

It is definitely not of good quality, it is dirty and needs to be improved. The swimming pool is well built, thumbs up. Linyuan Chinese restaurant tastes good, but the price is a lot higher. In addition, there are no beverages and food in the refrigerator in the room. This should not be done and needs to be improved.

It happens to be Yangcheng in spring, and the scenery outside the city is really chaotic~ But I still complain, Nansha is really far away. . I once thought that the driver brought me from the airport to Dongguan to enjoy the service 😅 I didn’t know it was still Guangzhou. Closer to home, I am very satisfied with Marriott's facilities, and it is qualified among the five-star hotels I have stayed in. The service attitude, compared to a board, the doorman here will guide you to the elevator, which is really my heart. Meals, let me say one more thing, there will be something you like! All in all, the sense of luxury is sufficient, the sense of warmth is very good, the key is, natural. Finally, I like the waiter @Cici, from check in to out, he has been very enthusiastic to help me, including where to eat, where to shop, etc., cherish such a good employee~

When booking a room, Ctrip's official website shows that floors 6 to 16 are acceptable, but it turned out to be the lowest room. I don't want to argue because it's hot and driving all the way. As a result, the room in room 603 is facing the main road, and the noise is loud at night, and the sound of the air conditioner is also loud. In addition, the route cannot be closed, so I will not stay in this hotel again in the future. You won't recommend it to your friends. This hotel is the worst hotel I've ever experienced driving from Chengdu. More than 900 per night is not worth it. That night, I quickly canceled my stay extension at the Jinmao Marriott for the next day and moved to the Sheraton Hotel.

The little brother at the front desk of the buffet was very considerate and saved a table for us. We can go to the room to watch the fireworks halfway, and then go down to eat.

As soon as I entered the door, I felt that the decoration made it feel like an apar**ent hotel. I'm sorry for the price. The curtains are still manually blocked and wireless. The Internet is not good and the screencast of the highlights is stuck 🥲. I added 200 yuan for double breakfast but there is nothing to eat. I ordered takeout and initially said that it would not be delivered and asked me to go down and get it myself. After I went down, the robot came to my door again. Communication at the front desk If there are any problems, the service quality is really excellent.

When entering the lobby on the first floor of the hotel, you have to check the guest's information and ask whether you are staying in the hotel. You also have to ask if you have a room card. After staying in so many Marriott hotels, this is the first time I have encountered this. Maybe This is related to poor communication at the local police station, and the management is a bit rigid. There were mosquito bites in the middle of the night, so I got up to swat the mosquitoes. In the second half of the night, there were dogs screaming repeatedly downstairs. I was really speechless. I hope the hotel management can show the reputation that a five-star hotel should have.

When checking in, the front desk staff was very professional and polite. When they saw our name when they got my ID card, they would use my surname to say hello again. This is a very considerate reception! The staff in the lobby are very warm and polite and will actively help the guests. For example, when they see me wanting to take the elevator, they will go to the elevator first to help me press the elevator 👍, and the little brothers at the entrance of the lobby are very handsome and polite The reception guests, the big bed room I booked, the room type equipment and style, etc. are all what I like! There are three charging methods at the charging place, which is very convenient and easy to use! The service of the customer service phone is also very thoughtful. I accidentally got blood on my finger. I used the customer service phone to ask if there is a hemostatic patch, and it was sent to my room quickly! thank you very much! The water quality of the swimming pool is very clean, the environment is very good, and the landscape is beautiful! On the left side of the entrance on the first floor of the hotel is the "Uncle Martin's Farm" ticket entry, you can feed the fish to feed the alpacas, and the food to be fed can be purchased separately or included in a package ticket. The hotel can order take-out, and you can pick up take-out from the take-out counter on the first floor. There are many restaurants around, and there is "Wanda Plaza" not far away! The overall feeling of staying is very like and satisfied, and I will stay again if I have the opportunity!

2. The service is not in place: call the front desk to ask the room to take out the trash, forget it; ask for help to make coffee in the breakfast room, forget it. Saying yes, but actually doing nothing
3. The breakfast is unpalatable, more than 100 breakfasts, the variety is like seven days
4. The environment is very average. The room is small and has no balcony. It doesn't have a high-end feeling. It is probably remodeled from the apar**ent.

msg:The newly opened Marriott, the welcome at the door will take the initiative to greet the car and take the luggage. The service in the lobby is very friendly, and the check-in is fast. The lobby manager said that he checked the room in advance, and it feels good. The size of the room is quite satisfactory. There are alpacas in the hotel garden, which is great for children surprise.
        First things first, the moving lines of the room are well designed. I like the separation of changing, bathroom, washing, and bathing. Hansgrohe's thermostat is very stable, and the water from the shower is mixed with air that is very gentle and full. Washing The level of protective products is online, and the non-slip floor is still reliable after being wet; the bed is large, and the bedding does not lose the standard of Marriott. I like the minimalist approach of the head of the bed blending into the wall.
        Not to mention bad, the previous phone call told me that there was fruit and the result was not. I am not disappointed but I feel that it is not rigorous. The laminate floor exposed in the area not covered by the floor carpet is really low. The phone is super difficult to use, and the answer button needs to be found. Good luck, there are no signs at the front desk, floors, wake-up calls, etc. Don't you need services in the room? If you want a few bottles of water to make tea, you have to go to the lobby by shouting.
        The conclusion is that you can find Marriott's genes if you should have them, and there will be no surprises if you don't have them.

我們入住的房間寬敞舒適，裝修典雅，而且非常乾淨。床鋪柔軟舒適，讓我每晚都能擁有一個好眠。浴室設施齊全，乾淨衞生，讓我感受到了家的温馨。
酒店的餐廳提供的美食種類豐富，口味地道，讓我大飽口福。早餐的選擇也很多樣化，無論是中式還是西式，都能滿足客人的口味需求。
此外，酒店的健身中心和游泳池等設施也讓我倍感驚喜。在忙碌的旅程中，能夠在這裏放鬆身心，真的是一種享受。

msg:在南沙的金茂萬豪酒店度過兩晚後，我對這家酒店留下了深刻的印象。從入住到離開，每一個環節都充滿了專業和熱情，無愧於萬豪這個國際品牌，讓我感受到了家一般的温暖。
這家酒店地理位置還蠻不錯的，酒店周圍交通便利，環境優美空氣清新，無論旅遊觀光還是商務出行，都非常方便。
辦理入住的過程也非常迅速和順利，能感覺到工作人員的專業和熱情，讓我感覺到賓至於歸，酒店是新開業不久的，房間寬敞明亮，裝修和設施設備風格現代而典雅，床鋪舒適且乾淨整潔，讓我一夜好眠。
此外，房間的景觀也非常不錯，可以欣賞到蕉門河的美景，如世外桃園一般。
酒店的餐飲服務也非常出色。無論是西式的漁人碼頭餐廳還是中式菜餚的林苑中餐廳，都美味可口，讓我非常滿足。
酒店還提供健身房和室內恆温泳池等設施，讓我在冬天裏也可以找到舒適的運動場地。
總的來説，我在廣州南沙金茂萬豪酒店度過了兩天非常愉快的時光，前台的經理Hardy和前台的實習生Vito等工作人員的服務態度，給我留下了深刻的印象。如果你計劃在南沙住宿，我會強烈推薦這家酒店。

房間裡也不錯，向著大電視的浴缸，舒適的睡床配著柔和的燈光，使人寧神安睡。

最後要讚一下自助早餐，食物應有盡有，還可以望著玻璃窗外的小橋流水享受一番。

Yana Hong幫忙申請為我們延遲至四點才退房。服務真的周到細心。
至於酒店的早餐包括泳泳池，健身房等設施就是有總比沒有的強。
酒店樓下有個小農場，讓小孩餵動物食物還是可以消耗一下時間的。

msg:硬件設施與環境很不錯！
但是：
1. 入住之前幾小時已經提前打電話給總機諮詢入住的合適時間，總機態度很好，並同時表示因假期人多暫估計需要下午兩點入住，但會特別對我的情況予以備註，儘量提前安排。可等到下午兩點去到前台被告知無房需要等待，且接待的HONG小姐表示根本沒看到什麼“特別備註”！當我當面再打電話給總機時，總機説有，HONG小姐説沒有。如此好幾分鐘，酒店的內部管理與溝通協調似乎存在較大問題。
2.本次主要安排長者家入住，當下午接車時，發現門口已停滿車龍擋住大門口，本人很自覺停到最後最遠的轉彎位，不想保安還專門過來“管理”，問及前面車龍，説是辦理入住（但司機還均不在車上）。需要一定時長辦理入住的車輛不進車庫，妨礙接送人的臨時停車，這樣的管理建議要認真總結、整改。
首次安排入住南沙萬豪，上述兩件“小事”恰恰都涉及酒店的“門面”管理，酒店高層是否應予關注呢？

最後，入住都沒有管家提前做好微信諮詢接待！我吐槽都找不到客服專員！現在管家服務在喜來登，希爾頓，雅緻，瑰麗這些都是標配了。
這家衹配商務差旅，睡一晚就走的客户！

游泳。周邊的環境也很適合帶家裡人來休閑郊遊。
但是在電話諮詢的環節裏，前台被問到一些自己不太清楚的事情上，回答顯得比較刻板:例如攜程上訂單顯然給予延遲到下午2點退房，我電話確認，前台可能不清楚有這個服務，便以堅決否定的態度回答了我，言語中甚至質疑訂房平台的真實性。當然我再前往前台落實時，這個問題很容易解決，但我覺得服務態度方面還有提高空間。

2.給我安排的角落房間很安靜很隔音，兩晚都睡的很好
3.被子，枕頭，床都很舒服
缺點：
1.早餐看似種類很多，但是感覺不怎麼走心，有很大提升空間
2.房間的紙巾用的太差，一擦就掉紙屑，換個好點的吧

msg:很多不愉快經歷，難得寫個點評。作為萬豪標準來評價這家，我衹能給箇中差評。服務上太多不足之處。從最奇葩的開始吧：

1. 當天酒店接待了商務會議團體，第二天該團體7:20叫早服務。我作為同一樓層住客，早晨7:20全家被叫早服務吵醒。這裏，設定叫早的人員難辭其咎，不負責任，我懷疑偷懶直接連號系統設定根本沒有檢查。在我電話前台確認叫早關閉後，又來了第三次叫早，血壓飆升。説可能和另一個號串號，我是不信的，前一天晚上打電話要小童洗漱的時候，對方還能準確説出我的房間號。這是這輩子住店不論快捷酒店還是本地品牌都沒遇見過的。第二天往房間裏送了個果盤➕致歉信處理，全程無電話溝通。

2. 假親子
看到這家店打的親子招牌才去的。其實是100%商務酒店+一個小會議室改建的簡陋小童樂園（如果這也能叫樂園）+ 隔壁三方合作的動物項目（98元門票）。整個酒店設計的枱麪高度都按歐洲成人標準，小盆友110完全沒法夠到洗手，且無踩腳凳提供，馬桶就更別想了。如果是帶娃的可以避坑。

4. 客房設計有個特別奇葩的地方。洗手枱背靠玻璃隔斷，台盆兩邊置物區域枱麪的背後是空的，距離隔斷有起碼30釐米間距。當中沒有任何防掉落的檔板。酒店刷牙玻璃杯啊，什麼盒子呀就貼着那個懸崖邊邊擺放，稍不不小心直接摔地上碎了，很不安全。

4. 在上一個行程時將一個小盆友的快遞寄到酒店，地址寫的酒店前台簽收。結果就是快遞到了酒店被拒收了，無人通知，無人溝通。我沒有口頭告知我肯定是有疏忽的，但是如果前台更有服務意識，起碼會查一下手機號碼是不是住户吧。哎，也不能完全怪酒店，我也有點不高興的。

唯一好印象：客房大姐態度熱情，負責酒店門口的小夥子主動開車門拿行李。反而基層人員更有服務意識。

酒店的整體硬件設施很好，很多細節體現設計上的用心和專業，如室內泳池更衣室配備了給拖鞋專門消毒的設備。整體來説，這是一次舒適的度假之旅。
