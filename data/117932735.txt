The hotel is right in Dahehui, where you can go shopping, watch performances, eat, drink and have fun in just a few steps. The hotel is decorated in Chinese style, and a smart butler bar is installed in the room. When it gets dark, you can close the curtains by yourself. When I turned down the bed, I was given milk and essential oils to help me sleep, and dropped them on the incense wood. The bed pillows are my favorite. They are soft yet elastic and fit well. I won't feel tired the next day. It is recommended to sit outside in the breakfast restaurant in the hotel, the environment is quite good.

The hotel provided free pick-up and drop-off service. Someone picked me up as soon as I got off the high-speed rail. The service was very good. The hotel environment is first-class. The parent-child room we booked is very considerate, with a special sink for children, a small toilet, etc. The pavilion on the third floor is very artistic, with small fish in it. The children like it very much. There are mythical beasts from the Classic of Mountains and Seas in front and behind the lobby. The breakfast is rich in variety and the ingredients are fresh. It is recommended. The facilities such as the gym and laundry room are very advanced. Welcome fruits and afternoon drinks are delivered every day, as well as Luoyang's special beer. The hotel waiters are very good at communication. Staying in Huamao Chunsong is the most successful choice for the trip to Luoyang. Very satisfied!

msg:I booked two rooms and stayed for three nights. It was very clean, the bed was very comfortable, and the service attitude was very good. The more I stayed, the more I liked it. In particular, there was a very honest and lovely young man in the restaurant. When I was waiting for noodles, he took the initiative to bring it to me. He asked about my taste and helped me to season the noodles. It was delicious! I really wanted to ask him to help me make another bowl the next morning, but I was really embarrassed to ask and delay his work. Thank you. Breakfast actually had sashimi, which the children love most, and the children were very happy. I also sent milk to the children in the evening. All the staff had a very good attitude, thank you. Thank you to the young man at the pick-up station, who was very cultured and told us a lot of knowledge about Luoyang. It is very convenient to go to Longmen Grottoes, Luoyang Museum, and see the Luoshen Fu.
The color matching of the staff's clothes is beautiful, and the people are also beautiful.
A small suggestion, after turning off the lights, I found that the WiFi light was also flashing, and the indicator light of the overhead projector was also very bright. Later, I blocked the WiFi, but I didn’t know how to turn off the projector light, which affected my sleep a little. It is recommended to make an indication where the toilet flushes in the bathroom.
Thanks again to all the staff, it's a very comfortable hotel.
I didn't take many photos, only one of the white dragon horse in the garden behind the lobby. The design is amazing.

msg:For me, the most important part of a trip is the hotel. A comfortable hotel can add a lot of points to the trip💋. This trip to Luoyang Special Forces was about racing against time. The hotel I chose🏨 is here It's next door to the high-speed rail station, and it's only a 3-minute walk from the "Looking for Luo Shen Fu" I want to watch. It's also a newly opened hotel, which is perfect🩷

The hotel service is really a highlight. Although it is not listed as a five-star hotel, for Xiaoqi, who has stayed in more than 100 five-star hotels, the service of Luoyang Huamao Chunsong Hotel is comparable to a seven-star hotel. Every time I go in and out When you go out, there will be service staff to welcome you in and out.

🏋🏻♂️ Gym, tea room, everything you need. Because it is a new hotel, the overall facilities are very complete. By the way, the breakfast is very rich, and there is freshly made local beef soup.

I like it and plan to stay there again with my parents next time

The Sui and Tang culture-themed designer hotel can be said to fully display the elegance of oriental aesthetics.

This time I stayed in the sky beam room 313, which comes with a bathtub, purifier and other facilities. For an office worker like me, it also comes with a power *****, which is very considerate. It is a newly opened hotel, so the facilities are super new, and turndown is available. The service also includes essential oil aromatherapy and milk, which is a surprise.

Every time I come in and out of the hotel, the staff are very enthusiastic to say hello, and the service is really online and attentive. The gym on the second floor is a place where I like to go for a run and relax in the evening, and then go back to my room to take a bath and feel comfortable. Be sure to have Luoyang's local delicacy beef soup for breakfast at the hotel, paired with shredded pancakes, it's delicious.

The hotel is located in the Dahehui commercial complex, with complete supporting facilities. You can enjoy it even if you don't go out to eat, drink and have fun. At 7pm, the "Heluo Lantern Festival" is held in the sunken square. 24 solar terms fairies hold "flower guiding sticks" to show the Chinese star palace chart. Especially romantic.

"In Search of Luo Shen Fu" is an immersive marching performance based on Heluo culture. It allows you to experience the long-lost stories of the divine capital. It is especially shocking with the addition of sound and light effects. It is a must-see performance when you come to Luoyang. Will come here again in the future.

But the catering is not good: the breakfast is relatively simple and there is nothing delicious; the dinner is convenient and can be used in the hotel. There is only a set meal, but both the content and taste are poor, which is very inconsistent with the hotel's price. It still needs to be improved to truly reach the level of a five-diamond hotel.

Located in the historic and culturally rich city of Luoyang, Luoyang Huamao Chunsong Hotel has won my sincere praise for its excellent service quality and elegant environment layout. During my stay, I deeply felt the hotel's extreme pursuit of details and warm hospitality.

First of all, the hotel is well-equipped and high-end, and the guest rooms are exquisitely designed and warm, perfectly integrating classical charm with modern comfort, allowing people to enjoy the comfort of home during their journey. The service team is professional and considerate. Whether it is front desk reception or room service, they have shown a high level of professionalism, and always take meeting customer needs as their top priority.

In terms of catering, the hotel's restaurants offer a rich variety of food choices, and every dish is delicious and memorable. In addition, the hotel has a superior geographical location, convenient transportation, and many surrounding attractions, making my trip to Luoyang more convenient and enjoyable.

In general, Luoyang Huamao Chunsong Hotel is undoubtedly a five-star choice in my mind with its first-class hardware facilities, meticulous service attitude and profound cultural heritage. I look forward to having the opportunity to enjoy this extraordinary accommodation experience here again next time.

The shortcomings are also obvious: the blue bricks in front of the lobby door are beautiful, but they are bumpy and do not consider the inconvenience of dragging the suitcase; the room is a U-shaped structure, the floor is not high, but the area is large. Because the room number indication is unclear, it is difficult to find the room and it is easy to get dizzy. In addition, it will not be officially operated until February 2024. Although it started trial operation at the end of last year and guests have been checking in one after another, the room still has a bit of smell.

The hotel has just opened, with complete facilities, exquisite design, cultural a**osphere and taste! The room is equipped with a purifier, coffee machine, flashlight, etc., and the facilities are very smart! Check-in enjoys five free drinks, snacks and fruits, sleeping milk and essential oils at night, and there is also a large bottle of Baisuishan in the room, which is delicate in the a**osphere! The buffet breakfast is rich in variety, clean and hygienic, satisfying the different tastes of the whole family!
The hotel's service is warm and thoughtful. Although it is very close to the Luoyang Longmen Station of the high-speed railway, only about 1 kilometer, it still provides pick-up and drop-off services. The hotel service staff helped with the luggage throughout the whole process. After checking in, they guided us to the room and delivered the luggage to the room! Along the way, in addition to the smiling service, they also explained to us in detail the best way to use each elevator, and even the meaning of the artworks displayed in the hotel! It eliminated the confusion and unfamiliarity of our first visit, and I couldn't help but sigh that this hotel is really good! !
Before I checked out, I had already recommended the hotel to my friends, because it was worth it!!
I think that the taste buds that have not been fully satisfied, the peonies that have not caught up with the best blooming period, the Bijefo that I didn't see due to the rush of time, and the hotel that will continue to improve, all these have laid the groundwork for me to come to this city again! So, Huamao Chunsong, see you next time!

msg:This hotel is the most amazing one I have booked. It is not only next to the high-speed rail station, but also has a very good cultural environment. It is a hotel with the theme of Sui and Tang Dynasty culture.
As soon as I came in, I felt the fashionable and luxurious hotel facilities, the beautiful scenery to stop and look at, and the attentive service attitude. My friends in the same industry all praised me for finding a good hotel.
The design of the hotel lobby gave me the intimate preparation of coming from a noisy and noisy city to a private and quiet place, and there was the first surprise of entering a beautiful world of light and shadow.
Stepping into the magnificent hotel lobby of the hotel, we were greeted with cordial greetings and hospitality. The lobby prepared free tea break service for guests.
Here you can really dance the spicy taste on your tongue. I have walked so many places and tasted many specialties from all over the country, but this time I have a special liking for the taste of Luoyang in Huamao Qingsong.
The room in the box is also very large, and the overall color tone of the whole hotel is so high-end, creating a space full of ritual sense, which makes people feel happy here.
In fact, in our journey, the hotel is not just a place to stay for the journey, but a destination that carries the expectations of life. Extend the journey to life and open a new world with spiritual sublimation.
The guest rooms of Huamao Qingsong touched my heart as soon as I entered the door, creating dreams for warmth, making dreams wonderful and blurred, making wonderful feelings full of infinite gentle romance, and turning romance into real warmth between half asleep and half awake.
The design and layout of the guest rooms and the thoughtful services are particularly humanized. It feels that he pays more attention to how to make guests outstanding and unique. The overall decoration items in the room are very exquisite, making people feel that they have found the original appearance of life.
Here I can get rid of the pressure and constraints of various work and life in the city, so that the exhausted soul can get precious comfort, and more importantly, I can find a long-lost sense of belonging and find the most beautiful self in memory.
The hotel's business services are centered on guest rooms. Most of the time we stay in the hotel is spent in the guest rooms, so the level of facilities in the guest rooms can concentrate and represent the grade of a hotel.
A trip, a touch. What did I do on this trip? This time I stayed in Huamao Qingsong Hotel to be in a daze, look at the scenery, and feel about life. Some people say that I love traveling alone, enjoying the silence and experiencing the feeling of loneliness.

When you go to Luoyang, just stay at the Huamao Chunsong Hotel near Luoyang Longmen Station. The new Chinese style is very popular with me.
The lobby and rooms are very nice to photograph, and the colors and layout are very elegant. The supplies are Jurlique, and there are a lot of drinks in the mini bar, which is quite ok.
Next door, you can shop and eat at Dahe Hui. The Aesthetics Museum is great for taking photos, and the books are stacked in an orderly manner.
You can also watch an immersive performance - "Looking for the Luo Shen Fu". What has been taken away by this long history and what has been left behind.

There are also many small details, such as sleep aromatherapy, earplugs, disposable towels, etc. These small details that are not noticed by ordinary hotels are all taken seriously, which makes me feel that I am cared for at any time, which is a plus.
The hotel's buffet breakfast is very rich, with various Chinese and Western delicacies, as well as Luoyang's local specialty beef soup, which is delicious.
The hotel's location is also very good. Luoyang Longmen Station is an 8-minute walk away, close to Luoyang Dahehui, with everything you need for eating, drinking and having fun. Whether it is a business trip or a family vacation, it is a good choice.

I used to lament that there were not many high-quality hotels in Luoyang, and the arrival of Huamao Chunsong filled the gap. The design of the lobby is mainly green and orange, which has its roots in Luoyang's history.

The performance of Luoshenfu in Dahehui is good, and there is also a shopping mall with food, drink and entertainment, which is very convenient.

For this reason alone, I will use my real name as Amway Huamao Chunsong! Another thing I like is that the hotel's breakfast time is very long, from 7:00 to 11 o'clock.

In terms of hardware, many places do not meet five-star standards. For example, there is a coffee machine and coffee cup in the room, but there is no spoon for stirring coffee. For example, there is no safe in the room. But the robot food delivery service and free drinks in the room are the highlights. The software is similar, and the attitude is very enthusiastic, but the service quality is sometimes not up to standard. For example, we went out for dinner and came back to find that someone had taken away the free drinks in the refrigerator in the room (we didn’t understand what this was, and the same thing happened in both our rooms). For example, after the service staff at the concierge was asked by me how to obtain parking tickets by scanning the QR code and entering the license plate, he said that he would go to the front desk immediately to help me find out, and then disappeared. When I finally found him after a long time, he told me to help other guests pick up their luggage. I asked him if he could help me go to the front desk and find out how to do it? He doesn't respond. Two rooms for two nights, overall the software and hardware have a lot to improve.

The names of spaces such as Qingyun Lobby, Chenwuxu all-day buffet restaurant, Yidongyijiu etc. come from Cao Zhi's "Luo Shen Fu". The interior decoration reflects an art of life and oriental aesthetics. The lobby lights are shaped like Hetu Luoshu, and the screen walls Paired with peony porcelain and bamboo slips, at first glance, you will feel astonished.
The morning buffet is rich in variety, including Luoyang's local beef soup, spicy soup, silver bars, etc. It combines Chinese and Western food to satisfy the taste buds of different tourists.
There are two sinks in the room, so you can wash with your companions without interfering with each other; you can automatically have electricity when you enter the door without inserting a card. At night, service staff come to turn you down, lay down a good night towel, light agarwood, fold the corners of the quilt, and present milk and good night cards. This unique good night ritual is very touching!
Huamao Chunsong is so beautiful, so artistic, so prosperous in the Tang Dynasty, with the accent of a thousand years of culture, the style of modern luxury, and the sentiment of quality life. It is a super five-star hotel that people will never forget.

The hotel service is very good, they helped me carry my suitcases as soon as I got off the bus. Tea was also provided when checking in. There is a bathtub in the room, which is very comfortable.
While staying in the hotel, you can also visit Dahe Hui. There is an internet celebrity library suitable for taking photos, as well as Xiaomi and Huawei stores. Tesco is very convenient for eating, drinking and shopping.
Good night milk and sleep essential oil are very thoughtful.
There is nothing to say about the hotel's software and hardware. It is also close to the high-speed rail station, which is very convenient. Next time I bring my family, I will book this one.

msg:It’s really comfortable to stay in this hotel next to Luoyang Longmen High-speed Railway Station. The color of the hotel is orange, which is my favorite color. There are many noteworthy little details, such as the thoughtful introduction map of attractions on the back of the room card holder. The drinks in the refrigerator are free, and very importantly, there is a small robot that can deliver takeaways to the room (many five-star stars cannot deliver to the room). The large bottles of Baisuishan are really hard to forget for me. , very suitable for people like me who are greedy for water. The turndown service includes milk and agarwood essential oil. It would be even better if the garbage can be disposed of easily.

The front desk staff are very warm and friendly, and the rooms are very clean. The only drawback is that you can’t reach the lobby by taking a taxi. All in all, it’s a great trip.

It can be seen that since it has just opened, all types of services are being improved, but they are all relatively enthusiastic. If the price hadn't doubled on May Day, the price/performance ratio would be pretty good. The Dahehui shopping mall is relatively deserted, and the shops are not yet full.

It is convenient to go to Luoyang Museum and Longmen Grottoes, but it is a bit far away from the old city. But fortunately it's very close to the train station, and the hotel also provides pick-up and drop-off, which is better. The quality of breakfast needs to be improved. The coffee beans are not good, and the temperature of the dishes is not enough. The hot milk ran out and was not added in time. The variety is not very rich either. If the air conditioner in the room is turned on at high winds, the sound will be quite loud.

msg:一晚上被要求三次開門，在洛陽華茂春松酒店發生的事情
於2024年6月1日，筆者（女性）和另一位女性朋友18:30到達洛陽，在酒店放下行李準備去看演唱會，在酒店待的十分鐘裏面有一位服務員來敲門，説是我們點的外賣，但是我和我朋友剛到酒店根本沒有點外賣，我們在打開門之後，他説可能送錯了，他下去核對一下。

23:00我們回到酒店洗漱後準備睡覺，12點我和朋友都睡著了。凌晨1:20接到了酒店座機打來的電話，是機器人的聲音説你們點的外賣到了請開門，但是那個時候我和我的朋友都在熟睡當中，沒人點外賣我接上電話之後，覺得可能是打錯了，於是把掛了。

七八分鐘之後，座機又一次響起，在那個安靜的房間裏尤為突出。還是機器人的聲音，説你們的外賣到了，請開門。 我立刻警覺起來，覺得怎麼會有人兩次想讓我們開門？我們也沒有點外賣。 一個晚上為什麼會發生三次讓我們開門的事件？

我和我的女性朋友商量後決定報警，在等待警察來的那40分鐘，我和朋友都非常非常害怕，緊張的在酒店裡將椅子把門抵住。在窗户外面尋找有沒有逃生的通道。在洛陽我們沒有任何一個熟人，酒店較為偏僻，非常焦慮，警察40分鐘趕來了解情況。那個時候我們才敢開門。

警察在樓下了解情況，得知機器人送錯了外賣，下午的人員也是送錯了外賣，我説為什麼會那麼巧合？三次都是我們的房間，是因為我們房間裏都是兩個年輕的女性嗎？整個晚上我和我的好朋友都難以再一次深度睡眠，還是時刻保持警覺狀態。 輾轉反側，到了早上6點趕着8點的高鐵準備離開。

早上的酒店前台沒有任何歉意。按理來説他們應該寫封道歉信，或者送早餐或者飲料，以示安慰。都沒有，我們為了安全，訂了價格更高的酒店，當晚預訂的話價格是1160元。這樣的酒店為什麼會出這樣的事情？酒店的工作人員的態度為什麼是這樣？

全文內容接觸事實，本人願意承擔法律責任。

msg:讓人很驚喜的酒店，精緻且舒適。
房間不算大，但處處都是貼心，贈送的水果、地方特色零食，還有搓澡的絲瓜絡。
裝飾也很漂亮，大膽的橙色和墨綠色搭配黑灰色大理石，很有設計感，雙洗手枱設計也很人性化，最最最貼心的一定是衞浴鏡子是有美粧燈的，給每次住酒店都不知道畫的啥粧的美女們更好的體驗。
此外還有咖啡機、夜床香薰和四種枕頭選擇等等小細節…當然床也很舒服。
早餐也不錯哦，來自早餐大省，最怕外地酒店的早餐沒得吃，這裏很豐盛，既有傳統酒店早餐選擇，也有河南地方特色美食，還有壽司、魚生。都沒有踩雷哦。
最後説一下地理位置，離高鐵站走路10分鐘吧，距離龍門石窟打車Q15-20分鐘。據親身實踐，在奧體中心Q看完演唱會，好好休整一下，這裡是絕佳選擇。

但我那個房間味道有點大，一直開着窗户味兒也沒有散去，開空氣凈化器也沒有用。

還有除了酒店住宿，説一下吃飯的感受。

牡丹燕菜138元 另外一個知名飯店（味道沒有差別）68元 量比你們大一倍啊啊啊啊啊！飯不好吃 而且吃飯的時候。至少有三個服務員。也沒有做什麼，衹是在那裡看着除了上菜的女孩。希望能提升一下菜品質量吧。而不僅僅是菜品價格高。

哦，還有就是不知道為什麼酒店外面總有鳴笛的聲音，早上7點多那會兒。還有凌晨12點多剛想睡着。非常長的鳴笛聲把我吵醒了。

以及建議你們其他平台也可以同步運營，因為大家現在搜酒店一般都去小紅薯上搜。

整體設計感是喜歡的風格 連門卡套都很有細節 服務非常棒 感覺超越很多國內外五星酒店和度假村的意識 從門僮到前台到客房服務 我們接觸的每一位員工態度都超級棒 細節到位 賓至如歸 和朋友兩人第一次來洛陽 這個酒店算是本次旅行很大的一個驚喜 也因此對洛陽留下了很棒的初印象 以後來洛陽還會選擇住在這裏 也一定會推薦給身邊的各位親友 這樣用心的酒店應該被更多人看到
