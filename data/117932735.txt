The hotel is right in Dahehui, where you can go shopping, watch performances, eat, drink and have fun in just a few steps. The hotel is decorated in Chinese style, and a smart butler bar is installed in the room. When it gets dark, you can close the curtains by yourself. When I turned down the bed, I was given milk and essential oils to help me sleep, and dropped them on the incense wood. The bed pillows are my favorite. They are soft yet elastic and fit well. I won't feel tired the next day. It is recommended to sit outside in the breakfast restaurant in the hotel, the environment is quite good.

The hotel provided free pick-up and drop-off service. Someone picked me up as soon as I got off the high-speed rail. The service was very good. The hotel environment is first-class. The parent-child room we booked is very considerate, with a special sink for children, a small toilet, etc. The pavilion on the third floor is very artistic, with small fish in it. The children like it very much. There are mythical beasts from the Classic of Mountains and Seas in front and behind the lobby. The breakfast is rich in variety and the ingredients are fresh. It is recommended. The facilities such as the gym and laundry room are very advanced. Welcome fruits and afternoon drinks are delivered every day, as well as Luoyang's special beer. The hotel waiters are very good at communication. Staying in Huamao Chunsong is the most successful choice for the trip to Luoyang. Very satisfied!

In particular, there was a very honest and lovely young man in the restaurant. When I was waiting for noodles, he took the initiative to bring it to me. He asked about my taste and helped me to season the noodles. It was delicious! I really wanted to ask him to help me make another bowl the next morning, but I was really embarrassed to ask and delay his work. Thank you. Breakfast actually had sashimi, which the children love most, and the children were very happy. I also sent milk to the children in the evening. All the staff had a very good attitude, thank you. Thank you to the young man at the pick-up station, who was very cultured and told us a lot of knowledge about Luoyang. It is very convenient to go to Longmen Grottoes, Luoyang Museum, and see the Luoshen Fu.
The color matching of the staff's clothes is beautiful, and the people are also beautiful.
A small suggestion, after turning off the lights, I found that the WiFi light was also flashing, and the indicator light of the overhead projector was also very bright. Later, I blocked the WiFi, but I didn‚Äôt know how to turn off the projector light, which affected my sleep a little. It is recommended to make an indication where the toilet flushes in the bathroom.
Thanks again to all the staff, it's a very comfortable hotel.
I didn't take many photos, only one of the white dragon horse in the garden behind the lobby. The design is amazing.

Although it is not listed as a five-star hotel, for Xiaoqi, who has stayed in more than 100 five-star hotels, the service of Luoyang Huamao Chunsong Hotel is comparable to a seven-star hotel. Every time I go in and out When you go out, there will be service staff to welcome you in and out.

The Sui and Tang culture-themed designer hotel can be said to fully display the elegance of oriental aesthetics.

This time I stayed in the sky beam room 313, which comes with a bathtub, purifier and other facilities. For an office worker like me, it also comes with a power *****, which is very considerate. It is a newly opened hotel, so the facilities are super new, and turndown is available. The service also includes essential oil aromatherapy and milk, which is a surprise.

Every time I come in and out of the hotel, the staff are very enthusiastic to say hello, and the service is really online and attentive. The gym on the second floor is a place where I like to go for a run and relax in the evening, and then go back to my room to take a bath and feel comfortable. Be sure to have Luoyang's local delicacy beef soup for breakfast at the hotel, paired with shredded pancakes, it's delicious.

The hotel is located in the Dahehui commercial complex, with complete supporting facilities. You can enjoy it even if you don't go out to eat, drink and have fun. At 7pm, the "Heluo Lantern Festival" is held in the sunken square. 24 solar terms fairies hold "flower guiding sticks" to show the Chinese star palace chart. Especially romantic.

"In Search of Luo Shen Fu" is an immersive marching performance based on Heluo culture. It allows you to experience the long-lost stories of the divine capital. It is especially shocking with the addition of sound and light effects. It is a must-see performance when you come to Luoyang. Will come here again in the future.

Located in the historic and culturally rich city of Luoyang, Luoyang Huamao Chunsong Hotel has won my sincere praise for its excellent service quality and elegant environment layout. During my stay, I deeply felt the hotel's extreme pursuit of details and warm hospitality.

First of all, the hotel is well-equipped and high-end, and the guest rooms are exquisitely designed and warm, perfectly integrating classical charm with modern comfort, allowing people to enjoy the comfort of home during their journey. The service team is professional and considerate. Whether it is front desk reception or room service, they have shown a high level of professionalism, and always take meeting customer needs as their top priority.

In terms of catering, the hotel's restaurants offer a rich variety of food choices, and every dish is delicious and memorable. In addition, the hotel has a superior geographical location, convenient transportation, and many surrounding attractions, making my trip to Luoyang more convenient and enjoyable.

In general, Luoyang Huamao Chunsong Hotel is undoubtedly a five-star choice in my mind with its first-class hardware facilities, meticulous service attitude and profound cultural heritage. I look forward to having the opportunity to enjoy this extraordinary accommodation experience here again next time.

The shortcomings are also obvious: the blue bricks in front of the lobby door are beautiful, but they are bumpy and do not consider the inconvenience of dragging the suitcase; the room is a U-shaped structure, the floor is not high, but the area is large. Because the room number indication is unclear, it is difficult to find the room and it is easy to get dizzy. In addition, it will not be officially operated until February 2024. Although it started trial operation at the end of last year and guests have been checking in one after another, the room still has a bit of smell.

The hotel has just opened, with complete facilities, exquisite design, cultural a**osphere and taste! The room is equipped with a purifier, coffee machine, flashlight, etc., and the facilities are very smart! Check-in enjoys five free drinks, snacks and fruits, sleeping milk and essential oils at night, and there is also a large bottle of Baisuishan in the room, which is delicate in the a**osphere! The buffet breakfast is rich in variety, clean and hygienic, satisfying the different tastes of the whole family!
The hotel's service is warm and thoughtful. Although it is very close to the Luoyang Longmen Station of the high-speed railway, only about 1 kilometer, it still provides pick-up and drop-off services. The hotel service staff helped with the luggage throughout the whole process. After checking in, they guided us to the room and delivered the luggage to the room! Along the way, in addition to the smiling service, they also explained to us in detail the best way to use each elevator, and even the meaning of the artworks displayed in the hotel! It eliminated the confusion and unfamiliarity of our first visit, and I couldn't help but sigh that this hotel is really good! !
Before I checked out, I had already recommended the hotel to my friends, because it was worth it!!
I think that the taste buds that have not been fully satisfied, the peonies that have not caught up with the best blooming period, the Bijefo that I didn't see due to the rush of time, and the hotel that will continue to improve, all these have laid the groundwork for me to come to this city again! So, Huamao Chunsong, see you next time!

As soon as I came in, I felt the fashionable and luxurious hotel facilities, the beautiful scenery to stop and look at, and the attentive service attitude. My friends in the same industry all praised me for finding a good hotel.
The design of the hotel lobby gave me the intimate preparation of coming from a noisy and noisy city to a private and quiet place, and there was the first surprise of entering a beautiful world of light and shadow.
Stepping into the magnificent hotel lobby of the hotel, we were greeted with cordial greetings and hospitality. The lobby prepared free tea break service for guests.
Here you can really dance the spicy taste on your tongue. I have walked so many places and tasted many specialties from all over the country, but this time I have a special liking for the taste of Luoyang in Huamao Qingsong.
The room in the box is also very large, and the overall color tone of the whole hotel is so high-end, creating a space full of ritual sense, which makes people feel happy here.
In fact, in our journey, the hotel is not just a place to stay for the journey, but a destination that carries the expectations of life. Extend the journey to life and open a new world with spiritual sublimation.
The guest rooms of Huamao Qingsong touched my heart as soon as I entered the door, creating dreams for warmth, making dreams wonderful and blurred, making wonderful feelings full of infinite gentle romance, and turning romance into real warmth between half asleep and half awake.
The design and layout of the guest rooms and the thoughtful services are particularly humanized. It feels that he pays more attention to how to make guests outstanding and unique. The overall decoration items in the room are very exquisite, making people feel that they have found the original appearance of life.
Here I can get rid of the pressure and constraints of various work and life in the city, so that the exhausted soul can get precious comfort, and more importantly, I can find a long-lost sense of belonging and find the most beautiful self in memory.
The hotel's business services are centered on guest rooms. Most of the time we stay in the hotel is spent in the guest rooms, so the level of facilities in the guest rooms can concentrate and represent the grade of a hotel.
A trip, a touch. What did I do on this trip? This time I stayed in Huamao Qingsong Hotel to be in a daze, look at the scenery, and feel about life. Some people say that I love traveling alone, enjoying the silence and experiencing the feeling of loneliness.

The lobby and rooms are very nice to photograph, and the colors and layout are very elegant. The supplies are Jurlique, and there are a lot of drinks in the mini bar, which is quite ok.
Next door, you can shop and eat at Dahe Hui. The Aesthetics Museum is great for taking photos, and the books are stacked in an orderly manner.
You can also watch an immersive performance - "Looking for the Luo Shen Fu". What has been taken away by this long history and what has been left behind.

For this reason alone, I will use my real name as Amway Huamao Chunsong! Another thing I like is that the hotel's breakfast time is very long, from 7:00 to 11 o'clock.

In terms of hardware, many places do not meet five-star standards. For example, there is a coffee machine and coffee cup in the room, but there is no spoon for stirring coffee. For example, there is no safe in the room. But the robot food delivery service and free drinks in the room are the highlights. The software is similar, and the attitude is very enthusiastic, but the service quality is sometimes not up to standard. For example, we went out for dinner and came back to find that someone had taken away the free drinks in the refrigerator in the room (we didn‚Äôt understand what this was, and the same thing happened in both our rooms). For example, after the service staff at the concierge was asked by me how to obtain parking tickets by scanning the QR code and entering the license plate, he said that he would go to the front desk immediately to help me find out, and then disappeared. When I finally found him after a long time, he told me to help other guests pick up their luggage. I asked him if he could help me go to the front desk and find out how to do it? He doesn't respond. Two rooms for two nights, overall the software and hardware have a lot to improve.

The lobby lights are shaped like Hetu Luoshu, and the screen walls Paired with peony porcelain and bamboo slips, at first glance, you will feel astonished.
The morning buffet is rich in variety, including Luoyang's local beef soup, spicy soup, silver bars, etc. It combines Chinese and Western food to satisfy the taste buds of different tourists.
There are two sinks in the room, so you can wash with your companions without interfering with each other; you can automatically have electricity when you enter the door without inserting a card. At night, service staff come to turn you down, lay down a good night towel, light agarwood, fold the corners of the quilt, and present milk and good night cards. This unique good night ritual is very touching!
Huamao Chunsong is so beautiful, so artistic, so prosperous in the Tang Dynasty, with the accent of a thousand years of culture, the style of modern luxury, and the sentiment of quality life. It is a super five-star hotel that people will never forget.

msg:This time our family went out and chose this hotel very close to the high-speed rail station. We had a great experience. We came by car and parking at the hotel was free. The hotel should be newly built, the overall environment is very good, the service attitude is also super good, and the welcome is very warm. The hotel room is very spacious, has a bathtub, and has complete supporting facilities. There are drinks in the room, free of charge. Anyway, I will go again in the future!

msg:This time I came to Luoyang with my friends, and I discovered that such a good hotel has just opened here. It has a great design and is suitable for taking pictures everywhere. The hotel service is very good, they helped me carry my suitcases as soon as I got off the bus. Tea was also provided when checking in. There is a bathtub in the room, which is very comfortable.
While staying in the hotel, you can also visit Dahe Hui. There is an internet celebrity library suitable for taking photos, as well as Xiaomi and Huawei stores. Tesco is very convenient for eating, drinking and shopping.
Good night milk and sleep essential oil are very thoughtful.
There is nothing to say about the hotel's software and hardware. It is also close to the high-speed rail station, which is very convenient. Next time I bring my family, I will book this one.

msg:It‚Äôs really comfortable to stay in this hotel next to Luoyang Longmen High-speed Railway Station. The color of the hotel is orange, which is my favorite color. There are many noteworthy little details, such as the thoughtful introduction map of attractions on the back of the room card holder. The drinks in the refrigerator are free, and very importantly, there is a small robot that can deliver takeaways to the room (many five-star stars cannot deliver to the room). The large bottles of Baisuishan are really hard to forget for me. , very suitable for people like me who are greedy for water. The turndown service includes milk and agarwood essential oil. It would be even better if the garbage can be disposed of easily.

The front desk staff are very warm and friendly, and the rooms are very clean. The only drawback is that you can‚Äôt reach the lobby by taking a taxi. All in all, it‚Äôs a great trip.

It can be seen that since it has just opened, all types of services are being improved, but they are all relatively enthusiastic. If the price hadn't doubled on May Day, the price/performance ratio would be pretty good. The Dahehui shopping mall is relatively deserted, and the shops are not yet full.

It is close to the high-speed rail station and you can hear the sound of the high-speed rail passing by at night. There is plenty of underground parking space.

msg:Booked before May Day, the average price is about 1,200 per night. The newly opened hotel is pretty good. The waiters are very enthusiastic. The hotel is located in Luoyang High-tech Zone. It is convenient to go to Luoyang Museum and Longmen Grottoes, but it is a bit far away from the old city. But fortunately it's very close to the train station, and the hotel also provides pick-up and drop-off, which is better. The quality of breakfast needs to be improved. The coffee beans are not good, and the temperature of the dishes is not enough. The hot milk ran out and was not added in time. The variety is not very rich either. If the air conditioner in the room is turned on at high winds, the sound will be quite loud.
