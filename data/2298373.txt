msg:Before booking a room, I called to inquire about related issues, but it was all voice recordings. Although I couldn't communicate with the service staff, I still chose the hotel faithfully. After arriving at the parking lot informed by the voice at noon, I checked in at the scenic spot customer service for the first time. I learned that the room would not be cleaned until around 3 pm, so I bought tickets first and got a 20% discount on tickets. I could choose a hotel near the scenic spot, not necessarily the booked hotel. The company has more than 20 hotels with similar conditions. We still insisted on checking in at the booked hotel. They said that there was a free special car to pick up from the scenic spot to the hotel, which was more than 20 minutes per trip, but the reality was that we waited for nearly 30 minutes and nothing happened. Later, after finding the bus stop and contacting by phone, it took nearly 10 minutes for the car to pick us up at the hotel and check in for the second time. Then the staff took us to the front desk of another building across the street. We checked in for the third time and got the room card. There were many people at breakfast and the environment was poor. The name and standard of the booked hotel were quite different from the actual situation. I don't know which link went wrong. In the end, the hotel promised free parking, but we had to scan the code and pay a parking fee of 20 yuan to leave the parking lot.

msg:The name of the Midnight Hotel is taken from Mao Dun's novel "Midnight". It is opposite the parking lot of Dongzha Scenic Area and very close to Dongzha Scenic Area. It is not far from Xizha Scenic Area. Belongs to Wuzhen official hotel.
On the table in the room there was a note of welcome from the general manager, as well as complimentary cakes and alcohol wipes. The bathroom and shower room are separated, which is different from most hotels. I like it very much. The room decoration is also unique, and there are also Mao Dun's books. When I checked in, I bought a coupon for 150 yuan for the east-west gate, and I swiped my face when I took the photo. In the evening, after having dinner nearby, we walked to the Xizha Scenic Area for a walk and just swiped our faces to enter. There is also a hotel shuttle bus at the entrance of the scenic spot, just use the red receipt given when you check in at the hotel. After visiting the night view in the evening, I entered again the next day and directly scanned my face. The Jiangnan water town and cultural journey are completely in line with this Wuzhen cultural tourism experience.

msg:Traveling to Wuzhen this spring, we stayed at the Midnight Hotel (the name of the hotel is obviously taken from the novel "Midnight" by the writer Mao Dun, because Mao Dun is from Wuzhen). We stayed for 2 nights and had a great experience. First, the hotel is in a good location. Opposite is the Dongzha Scenic Area, which is only a step away. When going to Xizha, the hotel has a free shuttle bus that departs every half hour, which is very convenient. The hotel also provides free sightseeing buses in the scenic area.
Second, the hotel caters well. It offers a set meal of only 168 yuan, with 6 dishes, which is enough for a family of four, and it is very delicious, especially the salt-baked white water fish, special sauce-flavored duck and sister-in-law’s tofu. My friend After eating it, I was full of praise. Breakfast is buffet style and very rich. Compared with those who spend 300 to 500 yuan per person on meals at scenic spots, this hotel can be called a conscientious enterprise.
Third, many details are admirable.
——Red serving chopsticks. We are accustomed to using serving chopsticks when dining out. Although most hotels provide them, they are of the same color, so it is easy to get confused when eating. The serving chopsticks in Midnight Hotel are red, so there is no mistake.
——A toilet seat in the bathroom. For guests who are a bit mysophobic or particularly particular, this move must be appreciated.
——Books in the guest room. For book lovers, the books displayed in the room are like meeting old friends in a foreign country. Although there are not many books, they have a common theme, which is to introduce all aspects of Wuzhen so that you can have an in-depth understanding of Wuzhen's history and culture through the scenery when traveling.
——The TV has a playback function. The hotels we stayed in ranged from luxurious to simple, and there were quite a lot of them. The TVs rarely played back the TV sets. During the trip, I often felt regretful that I couldn't watch my favorite programs. It was really surprising to find that the TV set in the Midnight Hotel could make up for this regret!
Fourth, the hotel has a good service attitude.
Special thanks to the waiters Ms. Liu and Manager Zhou for their considerate service.
I won’t introduce details like this one by one. I strongly recommend tourists to experience it by themselves. We will choose Midnight again when we come to Wuzhen.

The little brother at the front desk is very kind and answered my inquiries very carefully. But the downside is that there are too many tourists in the hotel team, so breakfast from 7:00 to 8:00 is simply too much It's a nigh**are.

The same service is just not in the scenic spot, you can also enjoy morning tea and shuttle bus, and there are unlimited times to enter and exit the scenic spot!
Tickets are also discounted, 150 tickets for the east-west gate

The location is at the gate of Dongzha, the shuttle bus will be a bit of a traffic jam, but it's very worry-free and you don't need to walk on your legs, but it will also take a little time. Overall, it’s a great alternative for the price!

The internal service is normal, the room size is reasonable, and the service is online.
It is not recommended to only consider waterfront rooms, there are no waterfront rooms.
I didn’t take pictures in the room, let’s take some pictures of Wuzhen~

During the stay, the privileges of ferry boats, battery cars and countless times of entering the park in Xizha scenic area are the same as staying in hotels in the scenic area. We also went to enjoy the morning tea guests in the scenic area at our own expense in the morning. Finally, I would like to give a big thumbs up to Ziye Hotel for its service. It's very good. Every time I go in and out, someone opens the door, and the waiters greet me with a smile. They also help us upgrade all the rooms to balcony rooms when the weekend is so busy. The room facilities are very comfortable. It's zero degrees Celsius, and the room is very well heated, especially the hot water for the shower, which is hot in seconds, and the water volume is so large that you don't want to get up once you lie down on the bed. Next time I come to Wuzhen, I will definitely stay at Ziye again!

There is a car connecting the hotel to Xizha, and you can also take the tour bus in the scenic area for free. It is also very convenient to go to Dongzha, just across the road. Highly recommended!

It is very convenient to go to the scenic spot. The east gate is just opposite, and the west gate has a dedicated shuttle bus. The best thing is that you can enter the scenic spot regardless of the number of times. It is so convenient! The breakfast is excellent, and you can enjoy 15% discount for the accommodation when you dine in the restaurant. The price of the special products you buy is also relatively reasonable, cheaper than outside... It's great, I have recommended it to my friends, and I will go there again when I have the opportunity.

msg:very good experience. For two nights in Wuzhen, I booked another hotel at first, but the experience was not good, so I temporarily changed to Midnight. No contrast no harm, Midnight is very good. Worthy of the stars.
The hardware is excellent, and the room is soundproof. The room size is large and clean. The waiters are warm and thoughtful. If you arrive at the store early in the morning and the room has not been cleaned up, you can store your luggage first and go to play. The waiter will also give reasonable suggestions. The breakfast is rich and the environment is good.
The best thing about his family is that you can buy tickets for the east gate and west gate with discounts, and you can enter and exit the west gate multiple times. excellent! And there is a shuttle bus to pick up and drop off guests.
Special praise to the male waiter (unknown name) who was on duty on the 30th, for his proactive work, pertinent suggestions, and carefulness.
I will still live here next time. and have recommended to a friend

It was a wonderful experience when I came to play on New Year’s Day. During the Chinese New Year, I brought my family back here for a new year. ***** New Year of the Rabbit!


Additional Benefits: Free 🆓
🚌Stay in a hotel under Wuzhen Tourism, although Ziye Hotel is outside the scenic area, there is a free shuttle bus to Xizha Scenic Area, and you can go as you go, if you need a car, just tell the concierge brother at the door!
🎡Because the tour bus in the scenic area stays in the hotel under Wuzhen, so it is also unlimited number of rides


Environment: Classical and atmospheric decoration in the style of the Republic of China
The bedding is comfortable and it's really a good night's sleep. The amount of water in the rain is also large, which really relieves fatigue!

Room: spacious and bright, well-equipped, strong air-conditioning, Kohler sanitary ware, this is a conscience hotel.
Traveling: The east gate of the scenic spot is within 100 meters, and there is a shuttle bus to and from the west gate.
Ticket booking: Hotel booking is cheaper than online, and it is very convenient to enter the park by swiping your face many times.
Breakfast: Absolutely above four-star standard, nearly 80 kinds of cold, hot, main, dish, western, drink.
Comprehensive evaluation: The preferred hotel in Wuzhen is the best cost-effective hotel in the past 20 years of business travel. This is also the first time I have written such a long praise, because such a good hotel must be publicized with conscience, so that more friends can live in the best quality and cheapest room in the scenic spot without stepping on the trap.

The scenic shuttle bus is very convenient, whether you are going to the scenic spot or returning from the scenic spot, you don't need to rush to call a car temporarily. You can also take the scenic tour bus for free when you stay in the hotel. It is very convenient to take the children to take the bus when you are tired from playing in Xizha.

位置：在東柵景區門口對面，離西柵有近2km的地方。
服務：有免費的西柵景區接駁車，隨時發車，但大約10多分鐘一趟，挺方便的。
門票：景區西柵單獨門票是150，東柵單獨100，聯票：190。在酒店買是聯票：150，而且進出西柵是刷臉，入住期間可多次進出。
房間：傢俱有些復古的，水流很大，瞬間就出熱水，房間還有矛盾的實體書，可供閲讀。

交通：酒店在東柵邊上，出門就是景區，自駕停車很方便，我們住的是另外一棟，需要過一個馬路。酒店門口有免費的擺渡車，方便是挺方便的，有時候需要等一會兒？

但是，因為個人喜好問題，我們年輕人並不喜歡這種古色古香的色調，但是，因為酒店是景區旗下酒店，可以在入住期間，無數次進出西柵景區，並且酒店有車接送，當然不願意等的也有公交車，還有酒店的自助餐，也是非常nice，種類極多，味道很好！
還有，酒店服務意識極強，非常熱情，酒店也非常大，我**，就是狠狠地贊！還給我免費升級了大床！
真心划算，真的推薦！

酒店還免費升級成了帶陽台的豪華標間，房間的沙發很舒服，工作人員服務也很到位，基本上有需求都可以滿足。
下次如果再來烏鎮的話還是會選擇這家酒店，值得推薦！

msg:🔔服務：子夜酒店的工作人員服務確實非常到位，在入住前有人打電話給我説2號樓要封閉消毒免費升級高級大床房，入住當天更有驚喜，早上7點多酒店的小鄒加我微信，和我落實到店時間和入住人數，我説是2人時候小鄒幫我升級豪華大床房，因為高大是1.5米的床，豪大是1.8米的床，為了讓我們更舒服就幫我再升級，非常為我們着想。還提前告訴我們疫情防控的相關訊息，我們到店小鄒出來接我們，幫忙拿行李，這服務真的槓槓的！入住後還提醒我們第二天的早餐時間。第二天要回去還細心給了兩瓶水我們路上喝，真的非常細心！
🚗 交通：酒店去景區的交通也是十分方便，去東柵就直接走過去，就在酒店的正對面，步行3分鐘就到了。去西柵景區酒店是有接送車，衹要入住都可以坐。子夜是景區外面的酒店但是一點都不輸給景區裏面的酒店，在子夜買門票西柵景區是退房前都可以無限次入園，坐景區的遊覽車，不用走太多路。自己預訂的門票是單次而且不含遊覽車和接送車呢。
🍃環境：酒店環境還是不錯的，商務型酒店，周邊有東西吃，也有車站，很方便。而且有外賣的，不偏。
🧹衞生：公共區域和房間的衞生做的不錯，整體效果都是乾淨整潔的。
下次過來烏鎮還是住他們酒店，我老公也很喜歡。強烈推薦！

msg:酒店是烏鎮旅遊局旗下官方經營的。前台、禮賓部、house keeping 的工作人員都非常有耐心，有禮貌，有求必應，有問必答。入住當天我們很早就到達酒店，前台小姐姐很好心的幫我們升等到外面不是牆壁、有景觀的房間。
由於是旅遊局旗下的酒店，我們買的東西柵聯票打8折。而且可以搭烏鎮旅遊的專屬接駁車來往酒店跟西柵景區，在入住期間還可以刷臉無數次進出西柵景區。由於可以刷臉進入西柵景區，我們在早上6點多景區大門還沒開放時就可以憑住客身份進入景區在早茶課區域的水邊吃早餐。清晨的烏鎮好安靜！好美好美！雖然我們沒睡飽、也沒看過沒吃過酒店住宿費包含的早餐，但是覺得很值得！
酒店的地理位置就在東柵景區門口斜對面，過個馬路就到了東柵，很方便。東柵小橋流水、温潤柔和，沒有那麼多現代商店，很喜歡！
房間的內裝滿新的，跟圖片一樣，民國初年的風格，屬於古典美。空調跟熱水也運轉良好。
就是有2個建議：如果衞生間區域能放個垃圾桶、洗手枱上放個面紙盒，淋浴間外面有地方掛衣服跟浴巾就好了。

🍃環境：裝潢很大氣，層高比一般酒店高。牙刷牙膏和肥皂需要問前台領

🔔服務：
接駁車：來回西柵，最晚10.30。很方便。

享受西柵內景區酒店的福利，包括門票打折和電瓶車。

醫療：爸爸在酒店吃完飯拉肚子了，給前台打電話前台説不提供葯，讓我們去醫院檢查。我們一查最近的醫院開車40多分鐘。很無語。

如果我是前台，我至少會給出兩種解決方案。給出最近葯店的位置，和給出最近的急診室。這些全都是我們自己查的，如果酒店在這方面培訓再加強一些就更好了。

總的來説性價比還是很高的。

msg:這家子夜大酒店是唯一一家位於烏鎮東柵的官方經營酒店 選擇這家酒店一開始的原因是因為購買兩日票門票能優惠不少 不過事實上這也是我們嘉興之行帶來最多驚喜的一家酒店

🚗 交通：直接導航到酒店 在工作人員指引下把車停到地下停車場就可以了 去西柵需要做酒店提供的免費擺渡車 約半小時一輛 東柵步行150米就到了 非常方便 而且門票優惠不少 

🧹客房：最帶來驚喜的肯定是酒店房間本身了 裝修風格非常的民國風 復古的風格放在烏鎮這樣一個地方簡直是完美搭配 而且設計水平很好 這個床是我媳婦特別喜歡的 總之客房是必須強力安利一下的！

🍃環境：周邊吃飯以及超市都非常多 中午我們吃的小吃 晚上回來之後發現點外賣也很多選擇 第二天白天退房後還可以在周圍小超市補給一下 總之非常方便了

🔔服務：最值的服務就是來回西柵的擺渡車了 去的時候可以等客房電話 回來時候到定點地方排隊就可以了 第二天早飯基本就是三星級酒店等級的 已經足夠滿意 最後還是忍不住説一下 這個價格能住在烏鎮官方的酒店實在是太值了！
