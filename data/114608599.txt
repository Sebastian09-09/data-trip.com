msg:During the May Day holiday, I traveled to Wuxi. There was a promotion for 888 package redemption, so I experienced the newly opened Hotel Indigo under InterContinental in Wuxi. After having experienced many four- and five-star hotels in Binhu District, I changed to this one. The price-performance ratio is very good, the color and design are very good, the large floor-to-ceiling glass windows are very nice and quiet, the purple with maple color is my favorite style, the corridor lighting and smart lighting control system are convenient and comfortable, and the bedding is very comfortable; there are several points in the service that are very good. The guest manager called one day in advance to inquire about the check-in preference and room reservation, which is the trea**ent of a top luxury hotel; I wanted to take a shower at night, but I didn't understand the water button of the shower head, and manager JAMES came to debug it at nearly 12 o'clock in the morning; the breakfast service has the greetings of a five-star hotel, and the environment and colors are also richer; I experienced basic exercises in the gym, which is not bad, and the complimentary InterContinental lobby cocktail is so-so. As the moon waxes, it wanes. I have to complain about the bedside lamp. I don't know why it is so huge. The height and diameter made me bump my forehead three or four times when I bent down to charge it. The shape and color of the plates and bowls in the restaurant must be deliberately designed, but I still can't appreciate them. They are not as good-looking and high-end as pure white porcelain with LOGO. Overall, it is good.

msg:I was very satisfied with the whole process of staying at Hotel Indigo this time. Cici at the front desk was very enthusiastic when I checked in. I raised questions about my membership number and she actively helped me answer them. Later, she also helped me solve the problem. Then the room environment is also very good, but mosquitoes are starting to appear in summer. I don't know why I didn't ask for electric mosquito liquid. It would be better if the room can have one in each room. Traveling around is also very convenient. The hotel also has free underground parking and free charging. It is really good in every aspect. Hotel Indigo also has its own style and characteristics. If I have the opportunity to come back, I will choose this hotel again. It is recommended.

The most congested May Day holiday in history. It can be called a one-day trip to the service area. Fortunately, the hotel is not bad. I rested for a night and was full of energy
There are quite a lot of attractions around the hotel, but they are all very congested. I am too lazy to go
It happened that the stadium on the opposite side of the park was playing. It was quite a**ospheric
The ecology is very good by the Taihu Lake and it is very livable🌲

msg:I heard that Wuxi built a new Indigo, so I came to experience it. I brought my mother to celebrate her birthday. The environment is very good. It is right next to the wetland park and the air is very good.

Facilities: The facilities are very new. The smell is good with windows. There is an air purifier that is always working. I saw someone on the Internet saying that they can't find tea bags and coffee bags. It is relatively secret. It is in a closet and needs to be opened by yourself. Refrigerator drinks are also included, which is very good and very user-friendly.

Hygiene: The hygiene is good. The lobby outside and the carpet indoors are relatively clean. ￼
Service: Katherine, the lady who checked in at the front desk, is very capable and the service is very good. She also brought a newcomer. The service of the new brother next to her needs to be improved.
James you, the manager who served us at the check-out, was also very quick and had a very good attitude. The service is really great. I will come again next time.
￼￼In addition, this hotel is in the new city, not in the old city, so it is more friendly to friends who drive. There is free parking downstairs, which is generally good.
￼Let's talk about breakfast. ￼Breakfast is suitable for the InterContinental across the street. ￼The service manager of InterContinental was proactive and enthusiastic, and took us to the elevator when we were still asleep. There are still many choices for breakfast. Their bread desserts and beef noodles are worth recommending. 👍

msg:I went to Wuxi on May Day. When choosing a hotel, I took into account the geographical location of Indigo and Intercontinental. It is faster and more convenient to take the Shanghai-Changzhou Expressway to Lingshan Giant Buddha. It is also very close to Yuantouzhu and Liyuan. Compared with the InterContinental next door, I always felt that the decoration of Indigo was more fashionable and youthful, so I decisively chose Indigo.
The hotel was newly opened in February, everything is new, and the design of the door is very grand. The person who checked in was the beautiful woman Katherine. The service was very considerate. Not only did she provide tips when checking in, but she also kept asking about her check-in experience afterwards.
Since it has only been open for three months, the rooms will have a woody smell, and the rooms are thoughtfully equipped with Honeywell air purifiers. The bathroom has a large bathing space, and the hair dryer is equipped with a Dyson, which is a surprise.
For breakfast the next day, although there was a short-term shortage of dining seats due to the hotel being full, the emergency response from all parties was still very fast, and it was not chaotic at all. In particular, his Xiaolong was delicious. Lose those local time-honored brands.
All the service staff's expressions are well managed, and their smiles make people feel comfortable. Finally, thank you very much Jack. I will choose Indigo again next time I go to Wuxi.

In the busy pace of life, I decided to go to Wuxi alone for a spontaneous trip. I chose a newly opened five-star hotel as my base, looking forward to finding peace and comfort in a strange city.
The moment I arrived at the hotel, the exquisite decoration, elegant a**osphere, and every detail revealed the high quality and unique charm of the hotel. What impressed me even more was the young lady who warmly welcomed me at the front desk.
Her name is Xiong Xinyue, and she is the night front desk receptionist of this hotel. Xiong Xinyue has a sweet smile and a friendly attitude, which makes me, a Shanghainese who has come to Wuxi for the Nth time, feel the warmth of home instantly. During my check-in process, she not only introduced the hotel's facilities and services in detail, but also enthusiastically recommended Wuxi's Lingshan attractions and special food to me. Her professional knowledge and enthusiasm made me look forward to the upcoming journey.
I fully experienced the hotel's facilities and services, whether it is spacious and comfortable rooms or delicious breakfast. Whether it is the thoughtful and meticulous service, I feel the hotel's professionalism and dedication, and I feel the enthusiasm of Wuxi during my trip to Wuxi. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Xiong Xinyue for her enthusiastic service. I hope I will have the opportunity to come to this city again in the future and feel the tranquility and beauty again.

Environment: Very quiet, the surrounding area is also very empty, and the lights are very beautiful at night

Service: Praise the service. Basically every employee you meet will say hello; when you pass by the door and the lobby, someone will ask if you need help at any time. It is a full experience.

After all, IHG hotels are always online in terms of service and facility quality. During my stay here, I would like to express my special thanks to Torison for his warm and thoughtful service. , and also recommended foodie routes for us, thank you! Of course, other service staff are also very considerate and enthusiastic. After all, the brand is there and the management level is there. Although it is a new area, the surrounding environment is still very good. There are few people and a high green plant coverage. It is also a kind of enjoyment to sit in the room and watch the sunset!
The room has the same Indigo design style as always, with a touch of French milk style + 🈶The vague Jiangnan light fresh water ink style, the color scheme is very comfortable, especially praise. Therefore, the water flow is large enough, the water temperature is very comfortable, and the shower in the bathtub completely inherits the intercontinental style. The layout of the hotel is good, you can enjoy bathing time~
Overall, this trip was very comfortable

The service is relatively friendly. It is my first time staying at Indigo and I am generally satisfied.

In addition, Caifenglou will never step on thunder, and InterContinental fans can always trust Caifenglou. The two stores are built next to each other. It is also magical that you can go to the InterContinental Chinese restaurant next door when staying at Indigo.

Although it is a little far, it is quiet and less crowded. The cost-effectiveness of the Indigo in Wuxi is much higher than that of Shanghai. The inexpensive price exceeds the quality of the price. First of all, the service is very good. Torison, the handsome boy at the front desk, is very enthusiastic. He greets us every time we go in and out, and remembers our names to greet us.
Back to the room, although it is newly renovated, there is an air purifier in the room that is always working, so there is almost no uncomfortable decoration smell. The bed is very comfortable, the mattress is very new and has sufficient support, and there will be no sound even if you turn over frequently. The bathroom has three separations, the bath water is very large, and the bathtub is very clean. It is very comfortable to take a bath in the hotel after watching the cherry blossoms.
In addition, you have to go to the InterContinental next door for breakfast. It is very close and a little walk. You don’t have to worry about the quality of the InterContinental breakfast. There are many delicious meals, and one day is not enough to eat all of them. I hope I can come back to play in the near future.

Many facilities are not open and you need to borrow the intercontinental hotel next door. This is understandable during the Chinese New Year. 2. Because of the new opening, the staff training was very unprofessional. Diamond members were provided with breakfast when they opened a room, but they forgot to operate it. After receiving the deposit, they were asked to pay for breakfast on site the next day. They felt very bad and later returned it; the luggage was not delivered when they checked in the room; There was an inexplicable knock on the door asking if the TV was broken, and I found that I had gone to the wrong room. 3. There are many hardware problems. The curtains opened automatically after eight o'clock in the morning; the cleaning of the bathtub was very rough, with dirt everywhere; and there was continuous noise on the phone. The experience of other details is very average and will not be listed one by one. After on-site feedback, the staff on duty handled it relatively well, but the overall experience was not good.

2. When I took a shower around 10 o'clock in the second night, the water was obviously no longer hot, which was different from the first night.
3. I had breakfast at the InterContinental next door. Although it was very close, it didn’t feel good. I had to wait for about ten minutes to have breakfast around 10 o’clock on Sunday morning.
Everything else is good.

The choice and taste of breakfast are pretty good. Parking is free, the rooms are relatively new and the services are pretty good.

However, the facilities have some shortcomings, but after all, the new opening is still being adjusted, and I hope it will get better and better in the future.

新開業的酒店，內飾都是我喜歡的。跟朋友吃飯比較晚到酒店入住，Torison, Minny, Katherine和Karry超熱情地幫我辦理入住，讓我和媽咪妹妹感覺超級棒！
第二天的自助早餐是要到隔壁intercontinental吃的，雖然人不少，但是服務人員很有禮貌有耐心～
謝謝大家讓我們的旅途更加愉快！下次再見～

msg:環境：酒店周邊環境非常好，大片綠地綠植，離太湖也不遠，開窗就是個天然氧吧。酒店內部公共區域不算大，但從設計到裝修都很符合我個人的審美，房間佈局合理，面積也足夠大，提供的洗漱用品、免費飲用水、咖啡、茶的品質也都挺不錯的，很是喜歡。

設施：因為我常年健身，對健身設備有一定要求，英迪格的健身室在酒店頂層，室內不算大，24小時刷房卡自助形式，坦白的講，設備確實有些少，尤其是龍門架的配件...當然，基礎的運動訓練是完全沒問題的。


服務：服務很好，這裏必須點贊，前台是兩位工作人員，我入住的時候趕上有其他企業會議在這裏舉辦，辦理入住的客人比較多，但還是特地先行的為我辦理了入住手續，詳細的介紹了酒店的服務設施、餐飲種類及時間安排以及周邊可以前往的商超等，針對首次入住的客人免費升級了觀景房，mini bar也免費供我本次入住使用。前台小姐姐Katherine人非常nice，有求必應，希望她可以看得到住客對她的認可，加油咯！聲明本人不是託，出差短暫停留而已。

衞生：我對這個價格的酒店衞生不是很擔心，本身也不是一個特別挑剔的人，所以我是滿意的，這個見仁見智，不多贅述。

其他：因為是洲際酒店子品牌，兩家酒店緊挨着，走路過去也就兩分鐘，美中不足的是，兩家酒店處於新開發的區域，沒有距離很近的便利店、飯店什麼的，最近的估計也要兩三公里了，所以有準備前來入住的其他朋友心裏有個準備就是了，最後英迪格的早餐品種不算豐富，room servie 的菜品品質確實非常一般，希望可以改進一下。
