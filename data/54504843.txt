Originally I was unhappy with the room, and she went out of her way to make sure we were moved to a new room promptly. She also arranged for us to have a better breakfast experience, and checked in on us to make sure we were happy with our stay. It’s this level of service quality that will bring me back to this hotel. It was highly professional and appreciated!

msg:First of all, I would like to thank Ms. Vivi, the housekeeper of JW, for helping me upgrade the suite closest to the sea. I like it very much.
It was a headache to choose a hotel in Hainan. Finally, I saw many netizens recommend this hotel in the comments of a post on a certain red book. It turned out to be a good choice. I was very surprised. The suite is very large and has two large beds, which is suitable for family travel. If you take your children out for a summer vacation, you can rest assured to choose the Marriott suite.
Hainan vacation, just lie in the hotel and watch "Joy of Life".

Service:
The front desk lady Leah has a good service attitude and handles it quickly. Several guys in the concierge department took the initiative to borrow umbrellas with a positive attitude.

Hygiene: Clean

She replies to all messages in seconds and responds to all requests. Until we checked out and the plane left Hainan, I also received Zoey's greetings after I got home. I give Zoey a thumbs up! She also upgraded the room type for free. When she learned that we were on a honeymoon trip, she also sent cakes and red wine, plus rose petals in the room.
Before coming to Sanya, I had been making a strategy, and I had a headache choosing a hotel. In the end, I chose this one. Whether it was the room, service, environment or service, it was better than I expected. The service staff on the road took the initiative to say hello.
The room is very large. I personally think it is much larger than other hotel rooms, and the furniture looks quite new.
The travel photography sent was also good. I sent 5 photos, and then I thought it was good, so I paid more for 5 photos hahaha.
The package also includes a buffet dinner at the Yacui restaurant, which is eaten in the Sheraton next door. The environment is also very good, and there are performances to watch.
Breakfast was eaten at the JW All-Day Restaurant, with a wide variety of dishes. I personally think that the Houan noodles, waffles, fruits and juices tasted great!
The hotel can walk directly to the beach, and the sand is relatively soft, so you can walk barefoot. However, the sea here is more complicated and the waves are big, so it is not suitable for swimming, but for walking on the beach.
Overall, the off-season package price is really very cost-effective, the service is also very good, and the Spanish-style building also has a holiday feeling. It is suitable for couples to travel, and there are fewer children, so it is OK!

msg:In 2015, I came to Sanya for the first time with my friends for the New Year's Eve. I stayed there at that time. It was called the Royal Begonia Luxury Collection Hotel. I liked it very much at that time and was deeply impressed. The room was decorated in a simple but stylish Spanish style, and the bedding was very comfortable. The hotel staff would smile and greet me when they met me. I felt at home. I came to Sanya several times later, but I saw on Ctrip that the hotel was closed, so I stayed in other hotels in Haitang Bay several times. This time I booked to stay in Sanya when I checked in on Ctrip. I felt a little familiar when I looked at the room type and decoration design when I checked in. After checking in, I found that the pool room downstairs on the balcony of the room was the same as the one I lived in that year. At this time, I checked the information and found that the current JW Marriott is the former Luxury Collection, which is a brand of Marriott Group. After checking in, I walked around carefully and continued the previous Spanish-style room type. The toiletries and bedding are still great, the room is clean and tidy, and the staff still greeted me politely with a smile. The housekeeper Weiwei also took good care of me and provided suggestions for the itinerary. After knowing the itinerary, he took the initiative to help the room delay. Thank you very much for the hospitality of the JW Marriott Hotel Haitang Bay. I will stay again next time I come. I hope your business will last forever!

My true feelings when I stayed there.

We drove with three adults and one child (11-month-old baby). Before checking in, the housekeeper Holly contacted me in advance and sent me the hotel introduction and matters, which met my needs for bed fences and strollers. When I arrived at the hotel, the receptionist opened the door. There was a lot of luggage. After checking in, it was sent directly to the room. The housekeeper Holly specially chose a room with a high floor and a sea view for me. Because I wanted to change rooms for personal reasons, Holly immediately accompanied me to see the room and changed rooms quickly. The elderly and the baby played in the first arranged room during the whole process.

When I checked into my favorite room, I began to observe the configuration. The details I saw were all Marriott's intentions. The toiletries were very good. If you don't plan to change hotels, you don't need to bring them separately. The bedding is very comfortable, with a baby pillow and quilt, and we slept a whole night. The hair dryer is Dyson. Speaking of this, I have to mention that when I saw the hair dryer, it is not difficult to imagine violent guests. The hotel needs to improve, and the guests should also be civilized. Enjoy good things and don't intentionally destroy them.

The breakfast was delicious and varied. After eating, I wanted to pack a small bread for my baby. The service staff immediately provided me with a box and a packing bag. We only needed one small bread, so we took one and didn't waste it.

During the stay, I thanked the housekeeper Holly for her attentive service. I will come to JW Marriott again next time!

There are endless trains to ride, and there are many choices for swimming pools. The hotel is cost-effective. There is one thing, the room needs to be checked carefully. There were small insects during the stay. Fortunately, Holly arranged a new room. I was satisfied with the stay and will stay here next time!

The restaurant was not crowded, and the reception capacity was great. There were not many people in the lobby bar, and it was very pleasant to have some snacks and read books at the bar. The facilities are complete, comfortable and beautiful! The breakfast is also very creative. I can feel that there may be many German guests here. There are actually several German specialties!

I still felt very happy that I was not forgotten. Housekeeper Holly also prepared small coconuts for us. This stay experience was very good and I will come back to experience it next time.

I could communicate with you on WeChat if I needed any help. It was a smooth check-in. There was a text restaurant introduction + picture guide for children to play before check-in, which was very convenient. I booked a pool room with a pool. The children could play directly in the room without having to go out. They had a lot of fun. I will stay here again next time.

The room was very quiet, there were relatively few people in the hotel, and the park was very beautiful. Basically, every corner was very photogenic. One small suggestion is that there is no exhaust in the bathroom, and the smell is a bit strong. I hope the hotel will pay attention to this.

After communicating with the housekeeper Holly, they immediately helped me find the jewelry. The housekeeper Holly was very patient with us. After many communications and confirmations, I finally found it in a very hidden place. I was very touched by their attentive and considerate service, which made me have a particularly good impression of JW Marriott! Calling Helen, Gina and Holly! ! !

Then let’s talk about the hotel. The entire hotel presents Spanish European architectural style and has a Mediterranean a**osphere. I like it very much. It is very suitable for a vacation for one person. It is very relaxing and not noisy with many people. We were upgraded to a room type when we checked in. We liked the room type very much and the view directly opposite the bed was very good. Also, the viewing angle on the desk is the same as on the bed, which is great. The hotel's breakfast has many varieties and tastes good.

Recommend friends to experience it:) I will choose Marriott next time I travel ♥

The European symmetrical building has a Spanish style, and the room inherits the Marriott's usual interior tone. In particular, the manager Gina fully understands the needs of the guests and provides thoughtful and enthusiastic service. This praise is well deserved.

msg:First of all, I must say that Miss Holly has a strong ability to contact and coordinate in advance to solve problems, and she will promptly comfort me with fruit plates, snacks and small plush dolls after any mistakes. However, when I arrived at the room at almost 5 o'clock without contacting in advance, I was told that I would wait in the lobby bar after an hour of cleaning. We consumed all the drinks and snacks by ourselves. I couldn't stand it until an hour before the cleaning was completed, so I sent two coconuts and fruit plates. It was really speechless. After waiting for an hour and a half, I finally entered the room... I went in two or three times to change the mini bar, and I opened the door directly to change other things. It was really insecure. After that, I didn't clean the room until the afternoon of the second day. Later, I found out that I thought I was going to change the room but I didn't change it, so the aunt didn't update the latest news. I don't blame the aunt for this. The room cleaning aunt is really nice and works quickly and seriously. I want to praise her~ I'm so tired of a series of apologies~ Really.
Let's talk about the key praises. The lobby bar is really comfortable to blow, the view is also very good, and the service is particularly good! The crowd density for breakfast is low, and drinks will be prepared in advance. The pool room is actually more private than the Ritz-Carlton, and is equipped with three types of swimming rings. The room is very large, the bed is also very wide, and the breeze blowing through the gauze curtains is very relaxing. The TV can be on demand and can be projected. There is a small BOSE speaker that can be automatically carried. It is really comfortable to sit by the pool in the room and listen to music and blow the wind. The most unexpected thing is that there are only coffee powder bags and French presses in the room! Just brew it with hot water and press it down to get a cup of very delicious coffee, which is great! The slippers are also the best on this trip, love it!

msg:The overall European style design, Barcelona courtyard style, full of elegant a**osphere. There are not many rooms in the hotel, each with its own characteristics, so there will be no shortage of people. It is definitely right to come here if you like quietness. The hotel park is very large, and the facilities of the Sheraton next door can be shared. It is very refreshing to take a walk after dinner and run in the morning and evening, and the negative oxygen ions are full. I have lived here for several times, and the check-in was very smooth, but I feel that the quality of the employees in the previous few times is relatively high, and the service awareness is also superb. The front desk concierge took the initiative to greet. This time, it seems that there are some newcomers. A manager who received me before left. I thought the service was as good as always, but it was a little bit worse. The management level of the front office manager needs to be strengthened.
Although the hotel is a bit old, the overall maintenance is okay. It is not recommended for those who are particularly picky and have extremely high requirements for hygiene. The restaurant dishes are quite satisfactory and worthy of the price level. I especially recommend the hotel villa, which is not expensive and cost-effective. If you are with friends and have sufficient budget, you can book a villa. The disadvantage of parent-child is that it is shared with Sheraton, and it will be better to add some playable facilities.

The room in jw is really big and there are relatively few guest rooms, so it doesn't feel crowded.
I live on the third floor and I feel a little bit damp on the first day. The room is equipped with a dehumidifier. After ventilation and dehumidification, it will get better the next day. The jw room is the highest on the 4th floor, so if you live in a pool room on the first floor, it may be a little more humid.
The breakfast restaurant is not big and is more Western-style. Since I personally eat more Western-style breakfast, I like it very much.
The park is actually not big and there is no transparent lawn, but the garden design is quite unique.
It is connected to the Sheraton next to it and can share facilities. So if they are connected together, it is quite big for children to play with. If there are two people in the world, there is no need to be on both sides.
My butler Lele was very considerate and arranged fruits and desserts.
I will bring my children to experience it again next time.

The hotel staff are all very nice, including the children's playground staff, photographers and train drivers. The hotel's breakfast is rich, which makes traveling alone with a baby a lot easier. A big thank you to Lele and the entire Marriott staff.

msg:It was my first time to go to Hainan and Sanya. I stayed at Westin, Hilton and Sheraton. This Marriott is my favorite. Although it is an older hotel, it is well maintained and does not feel old. The service is professional, warm and thoughtful, and the room is very large. What I like most is the overall courtyard-style environment, which is very suitable for a lie-down vacation. If I have the chance to go to Haitang Bay again, I will choose this hotel.

Room facilities: Spanish style, a swimming pool room is arranged, but the swimming pool is relatively small, so you can have fun in the public area. Most of the hotel is well maintained and is very close to the beach. Next door are the Sheraton and the two Marriott hotels, all of which are basically public areas. But there are few rooms in jw and it’s relatively quiet.

However, after checking in, my own feeling is that Marriott is worth the price. The taste is completely within the acceptable range, and the service staff has no bad attitude. From the greeter at the door to the restaurant waiters, they are all enthusiastic and patient. If you need anything in the room, it will be delivered quickly. The breakfast categories are also very rich. The hotel's The scenery is beautiful, and there is a large lawn that is very interesting, which is a bit disappointing. The hotel is very suitable for couples and people who like quiet vacations. It is not suitable for parents and children because there are really few programs for children. They have to go to the Sheraton next to them and cannot use other facilities. The service at the hotel Lele is very warm, but the room feels a bit moldy. Tastes 🤣, I don’t want to change hotels anymore, I hope I have a chance to stay here next time

msg:It was my first time to stay at JW Marriott in Haitang Bay. I booked a pool room for two nights and a garden view room for two nights. The overall experience was very good.
It is worth mentioning that before check-in, the housekeeper Holly enthusiastically opened the phone and added WeChat, and asked all kinds of needs very thoughtfully.
1. Knowing that they were two ladies, Holly made a note about the room in the middle so that it would not be too remote. She also made notes about her room preferences.
2. Since we had to change rooms in the middle, Holly let us relax and arrange the room change, so there was no trouble. We only needed to change a room card when we came back.
3. Before the trip, I asked the housekeeper about the tour. Holly patiently explained every item, and also helped contact helicopters, travel photography, airport shuttles, etc., which was super convenient!
4. The butler brought coconuts and desserts, which were macarons and chocolates. They tasted good. Girls know girls best.

Room experience:
1. Both rooms are large. The swimming pool in the swimming pool room is very clean and comfortable. The garden view room has a small balcony, which is very comfortable to blow air at night.
ps: At first I was worried about whether there would be a musty smell, but there was an air purifier in the room, so there was no smell.
2. The bathroom supplies are locked. According to the housekeeping depar**ent, they are newly replaced so that you can use them with confidence. In addition, two sets of children's bathroom supplies and bath bags are provided, which is very reassuring.
3. I forgot to pack a bottle of cleansing oil when I changed rooms. I thought it would be troublesome, but Holly helped contact the guest room and quickly found and delivered it.
4. There are so many drinks in the small refrigerator that I can't finish them all. In addition to ordinary Coke and Sprite, there are also Corona, Yuanqi Forest, and Hawthorn potato chips, etc., which are really practical.

Hotel experience:
1. There are many people at breakfast, but the staff are very active in making arrangements. Both restaurants can dine, so basically I didn’t wait for more than a minute.
2. The hotel's breakfast is not static and changes every day, so it is quite fresh for a hotel stay.
3. The wind in the lobby bar is very comfortable and the scenery is very good. I ordered two drinks on the last day. They were surprisingly delicious. Marriott members can get discounts. I had known that I would come to drink two days ago.
4. The room is cleaned in a timely manner. Wherever you go, you will encounter staff who say hello with a smile, help carry things, and ask if you need help. This is the a**osphere of vacation.
5. The hotel has many large and small swimming pools, but the space is large, so it will not feel crowded.
6. You can reach the beach by walking through the garden in front. It’s super blue and beautiful! Moreover, the beach is very large and there are not many tourists. It will not affect the scenery and take photos at all. It is very comfortable.
7. The hotel is decorated in a Spanish style, with many green plants, and the rooms are equipped with toilet water, which is also very convenient.
8. The location is very good. It is very convenient to go to the duty-free shop. It only takes five minutes. The nearby takeaway is also very convenient.

Finally, I found that the waiters at this hotel are very enthusiastic about their work, serious and motivated. Any ideas and requests will be understood and implemented hard. They are really sincere. I will stay here again next time I come to Sanya!

It took a few minutes to get to the beach by car. The sun was just right for taking pictures at 4 or 5 o'clock, and it wasn't very sunny. There were almost no people around. It was better to take pictures than Coconut Dream Corridor. After check-in, we were given a fruit plate and tea, which was good for taking pictures. There was also free flow of drinks in the minibar for the first round (I couldn't finish it at all) and free travel photos. However, you have to make a reservation in advance. The breakfast options were okay and quite delicious. There are many options. The disadvantage is that the air conditioner is not too cold. Maybe because the room is relatively large, there is no feeling of cooling down as soon as you enter the room, and the temperature is a bit high.

We took the initiative to contact us before checking in, asked for greetings, and responded to our needs in a timely manner, allowing us to enjoy considerate and distinguished service. very talented. The room was quite humid, but fortunately it was equipped with a dehumidifier, which made it much better. The overall stay experience is very good, the guest room and other staff are very friendly. The hotel has a large choice of food and beverages, and there are also group buying activities, which are very cost-effective. It is suitable for people who like to stay in the hotel for vacation. There are also many takeaways around. It's an 8-minute drive from the duty-free shop and a 7-minute drive from the food stall street. The swimming pool that comes with the hotel room is very good and clean. It is highly recommended to get up early and go to the beach to wait for a beautiful sunrise.

First of all, the environment, the facilities and equipment are very good, and the decoration style is exactly the same as the picture. I am very satisfied. Secondly, the hotel's service. Eileen praised me for being kind and enthusiastic. She arranged an extra bed and other service staff were also very kind. The room service wine was free-flowing and I felt like I couldn't finish it. What’s more, there’s no breakfast, haha, it has everything you need! All in all, I am very satisfied. The check-in experience was very good. The front desk service was very enthusiastic and asked about my needs. The overall environment is good, and the room has been arranged to the third floor. There are not many people overall, so it is relatively comfortable. You really can’t go wrong with the Marriott experience!

The room has its own swimming pool and is equipped with better toiletries. The mini refrigerator in the room can also refill drinks and wine for free. The hotel also provides buses to and from the duty-free shop and the airport, but the frequency is not very frequent.

It is a high-end area overall. There are not many people and it is not chaotic. In addition, staying in the hotel is of course very comfortable. It's very high-end overall. Whether it's the external decoration environment or the room decoration environment, the guest rooms are large and well-equipped, and the cleaning is also very clean. The most important thing is that the butler-style service is really considerate. He will ask you from time to time how your stay is and if there is anything you need help with. He is really responsive to your requests and will reply as soon as possible. I would like to sincerely thank you by my real name. My housekeeper Cora, I really want to thank you. Thank you for your thoughtful company and letting me have a wonderful vacation experience. I will never forget it.

msg:I give a negative review to the JW Marriott Hotel Haitang Bay for its food health issues and service quality issues! !
1. Food safety issues
      On January 1, 2024, the two of us had breakfast at your hotel around nine o'clock. The food we ate together included fruits, mushrooms and juice (one of us drank grape juice, and the other drank grapefruit juice). Some of the fruits were found to be a little sour when eating them, but I didn’t pay much attention to them. After finishing breakfast, the two of them did not have any other eating behavior. At the same time, both of them started to feel dizzy, nauseated and bloated at around 12 noon, and then began to suffer from diarrhea and vomiting no less than four or five times. They also had symptoms such as stomach cramps due to vomiting in the middle of the night. However, we had already taken a flight to leave Sanya that afternoon. , so I reported it to the hotel after the plane landed that night.
      Later, your hotel only gave us a feedback survey on the third day. According to the fruit storage slip provided, the fruits we consumed were stored three days ago. During this period, the fruits were properly placed and handled in compliance with regulations and whether there were overnight food items the next day. We were suspicious of the act of returning to the table. As a high-end hotel owned by your company, it is extremely inappropriate for a **** incident to occur. I am extremely disappointed with this.
2. Service quality issues
      After we developed symptoms, we promptly reported it to the relevant staff at JW Marriott Hotel Haitang Bay, but the other party has always dealt with the matter in a passive and coping manner. Basically, the whole process was that we were told about the investigation status only after we took the initiative to ask, and the so-called investigation status was only the fruit storage slip three days ago, and we asked the hotel to provide retained food samples for inspection but never received feedback. . At the same time, the staff responded to us in a tough and responsive tone during the call. At the same time, after we asked that as long as we can provide the inspection report of the food samples left on the day and there are no exceedances, we will no longer hold the responsibility, we still insist that it is the fault of our customers and refuse to cooperate with the inspection and self-certification. We are very dissatisfied with this. The price paid does not deserve such service. In the end, we did not receive a reasonable explanation, and we have not been contacted for communication since January 5th.

      I have always adhered to the principle of minimizing major issues and minimizing minor issues. However, because your company's food problems and personnel service problems are too excessive, I decided to appeal to the end. I don't want any compensation, but a sincere apology and handling results from the relevant personnel and the hotel.

Eileen's enthusiastic help and answers.
I did a guide in the early stage. Sunny at the front desk is also good. The aromatherapy in the store smells very good. The room facilities are also very modern. The breakfast is rich. It is recommended. Room facilities: Spanish style. A swimming pool room is arranged, but the swimming pool is relatively small and it is in a public area. Have fun. Most of the hotel is well maintained and is very close to the beach. Next door are the Sheraton and the two Marriott hotels, all of which are basically public areas. But there are few rooms in JW and it is relatively quiet. There is also a butler service, any problems can be solved

✈️A hotel driver will pick you up when you land in a BMW iX3, and the trea**ent is amazing!
🏨The hotel is located at Block C of Haitang Bay. There is a bus that goes directly to the duty-free shop. It’s so cool to have the year-end duty-free shop event (10 times points)!
🏖️Walking straight ahead from the hotel garden, passing multiple outdoor swimming pools, you can walk to the beach, get up early to watch the sunrise, and listen to the sea at night, it's so cool!
🗺️The hotel's room types are also luxurious, with basic rooms covering an area of ​​more than 70 square meters, and they also have mini bars and private balconies. We also gave you champagne🥂 when you checked in, so you can drink champagne while taking a bath🍾, it was very comfortable!
🏊You can also see the swimming pool room type on the first floor. The swimming pool is equipped with a sunny rainbow little white horse🦄It’s so cool!
📞The service is also very good. There were some misunderstandings in the early communication. VIP manager Eileen showed up in time, added WeChat one day in advance, and arranged various itineraries. The service was very timely. During the stay, we also gave Chris**as Eve fruits🍎 and Hainan coconuts🥥 Very considerate!

The hotel is located at Block C of Haitang Bay. Within a 10-minute drive you can reach duty-free shops, Atlantis Water World and the Haitang 68 Global Food Street next door. You can walk straight ahead from the hotel's garden to the beach. The transportation location can be said to be very convenient.
The hotel's room types are equally luxurious. You stay in a villa, and there is a mini bar and a private courtyard. The entire building is nestled in the green forest in the rooms and villas. The constant changes of light and shadow throughout the day make people feel real. It felt like I was on vacation in a Spanish manor.
Eileen added WeChat a day in advance. The service was very timely. The room was so spacious that I almost got lost. The mini bar was filled with my favorite drinks. The TV had Tencent video. The bed was so comfortable that I didn’t even want to leave the hotel for a minute - it was totally fine. The landscaping inside the hotel is great enough. After breakfast, I walked around the courtyard and felt so good!
The service is very good and the staff are very nice! Eileen, the guest service girl who received me, is kind and kind. If I ask questions very late, I will get a quick reply. Thank you~ I also gave you Chris**as cookies on Chris**as, which is very considerate.
I should choose here again next time, the price/performance ratio is super high!

msg:This is my favorite hotel in Haitang Bay. This is my second time staying here and I still enjoy my vacation here! First of all, the environment of the hotel is really nothing to say. The number of rooms is very small among the hotels in Haitang Bay. Therefore, there are few people and it is quiet, which is very suitable for relaxing! The entire hotel is in the style of a Spanish manor, which is really unique. The European-style garden looking out from the lobby bar and the sea in the distance are really healing! Ordering a cocktail in the afternoon, blowing the sea breeze and looking at the beautiful scenery, it is so pleasant! The hotel has many swimming pools, large and small, spread throughout the entire park. Now there is also a small constant-temperature pool, so you can swim at your leisure haha
The room is also outstanding, the space is very large, 60 to 70 square meters, European and American style decoration, retro style but also fresh, the photos taken are very fashionable, the hygiene is also very good, neat and clean! There are free minibar drinks, which are replenished once a day, with a rich variety. The hotel is really generous!
In terms of facilities, as an old hotel that is more than ten years old, there are some signs of age. Some parts of the public area can be seen to be in disrepair, but I think the overall maintenance is still very good. The decoration taste is online, the arched corridors are retro. The handrails, the small spliced ​​tiles on the floor, and the retro elements of the elevators are not seen in the newly opened hotels with large tiles. I personally love retro elements, so I think they are valuable. Of course, I still hope that the hotel can cherish the feathers as always and continue to maintain the hotel's hardware status. After all, the facilities and equipment will directly affect the check-in experience.
For a hotel with such a good a**osphere, it would be perfect if it could arrange some artistic elements, whether it be music, dance or exhibitions, so that guests can immerse themselves in an artistic holiday. There is room for improvement on this point.
Finally, let’s talk about the service, five five points! The first time I was deeply impressed was when I came to Sanya during the epidemic. It happened that the whole of Sanya was under lockdown and I couldn’t go home. I stayed in the hotel for a week. It was difficult for everyone during this special period, but the hotel service did not drop at all and treated the guests attentively. You can also see the hotel management coming to the restaurant to greet the guests and give small gifts to the children. Everyone felt a touch of warmth during a difficult time. This time I came to Sanya and chose this hotel again. From check-in to check-out, everything was very good. The staff in the lobby were so enthusiastic. They greeted everyone when they came in and out, and helped press the elevator to pick up things. The staff in the restaurant were also lively. Guest rooms The eldest sister was very careful in cleaning. If a button fell off, she would sew it up and send it back to me. Thumbs up 👍! Special thanks to the housekeeper for her wonderful service. The cute little girl accompanied and greeted me throughout the whole process. Check-out Lele helped arrange a late check-out and book an airport bus. The overall check-in was smooth. With such good service, I am ready to come back three times during the Spring Festival!

From the butler, concierge, to the front office, the service is very nice and proactive, making you feel at home. Before and after check-in, I received calls from the housekeeper. It can be seen that they care about the guests' feelings and opinions.
I would like to thank the housekeeper Cora for helping us upgrade to the sea view room on the top floor for free!
The room is in a back shape, large enough, brightly lit, and the bedding is comfortable. After dinner, you go back to your room, where you can taste the welcome fruits thoughtfully placed by the hotel.
The next day, because the family was temporarily scheduled for an online meeting at noon, we contacted the housekeeper Cora, who helped us delay check-out until 14:00, so that the migrant workers who were working while on vacation could have peace of mind in the room before leaving after the meeting.
Next time I come to Sanya, I will stay at JW Marriott Haitang Bay!

She really provided meticulous and personal service. On the day we left, she even gave us two coconuts as a gift. She was so considerate. It was the first time I felt the warmth of home at JW Marriott, and I would like more here. Thanks to Rena, the waiter at the all-day dining restaurant. From the moment we entered the restaurant, she has always provided very detailed service. She asked about our tastes and taboos, introduced the set menu, analyzed the various ingredients of the set meal, the matching of the main meal, etc. She has strong professional skills and always maintained That amiable smile made us feel at ease, satisfied and satisfied during our meal. Finally, we were given a fruit platter, which was so heart-warming. I give a thumbs up to these two service experts at the JW Marriott Haitang Bay Hotel, for four days and three nights. The holiday is over successfully.

Facilities: The hotel floor is not high and the facilities are fully equipped.

Environment: Spanish architectural style, the garden design is very interesting. There are multiple outdoor swimming pools that are well maintained. It is close to the coastline and has a private beach. Although Haitang Bay has strong winds and waves, the water is clear and the sand is soft, making it very suitable for walking.

Service: The service is very good. Whether it is welcome, cleaning, catering or shuttle bus, the staff are very patient. In particular, the guest supervisor Miaomiao took the initiative to contact me before check-in to inquire about my check-in needs, and even helped me upgrade my room type if conditions allowed. If I encountered a problem during my stay, after I reported it, he communicated with the depar**ent as soon as possible and offered to solve it. The plan, work efficiency and attentiveness are very high and deserve five stars. ✨

Lower your expectations first and then improve your services offline. This is a good point. I learned from it.

The beach level of Sanya Bay and Yalong Bay is incomparable. However, the ATV riding for taking photos is a scam. I suggest you use a machete to negotiate the price. The girl who greets guests at the hotel entrance is very beautiful and has a bright smile. However, she wears too much makeup. This girl Luna is very enthusiastic. The supervisor also called several times to clean up the room. The young man from Hubei was also very down-to-earth and attentive.

Although the occupancy rate is high, it is not crowded at all. Cathy, the housekeeper, contacted us the day before and learned that we were here for a birthday. She decorated the room and gave us birthday cakes and coconuts. She was very considerate and even helped me apply for a late check-out when I left. The hotel also sent 5 travel photos. The housekeeper helped us reserve a time in advance and finally took out the photos. The space in the breakfast room is very comfortable, the floor height is unusually high, and there is a garden outside, so it is very pleasant to dine. The beach outside the hotel is flat and thin, and there are few people. All in all, very satisfied😊

The JW Marriott is located in Haitang Bay, adjacent to the sea, from the room to the private beach. It only takes ten minutes to get to the duty-free shop - Haichang Dream Night City.

There are garden swimming pools with different characteristics, exquisite and gorgeous check-in points, and you can take pictures of the beautiful scenery... The hotel service is very good, especially Lele is great.

There are many restaurants in the hotel for you to choose from. Among them, Yatri Seaside Restaurant is an open-air dining environment. You can sit by the sea and feel the sea breeze blowing on your face while enjoying the wonderful exotic customs and the live performances of the circus and Paraguayan band. Next is JW Water Pavilion Restaurant, a must-visit restaurant for couples.

It is also great to choose to go diving! Eat, drink and have fun all in one place, so you don’t have to go on vacation. You will feel bored! The service at the hotel Lele is very good, but there was a sudden power outage during maintenance, which was a little affected, but the rest is good
Compared with other surrounding hotels, it is relatively small and exquisite. The check-in lobby is on the 3rd floor. When I arrived, I thought it was on the 1st floor. The restaurant is on the first floor, giving people the illusion that it is underground!
The entire architectural style of this hotel is Spanish style with stone-based elements. The entire hotel exudes a European style. Coupled with the tropical sunshine coconut trees, lying on the lounge chair by the pool gives people the illusion that time has stopped. There is a small train running through the hotel garden, allowing guests and children to enjoy sightseeing. More suitable for adults to relax on vacation!
Hotel environment:
The entire style of the hotel is Spanish style. The spiers, corridors and arches that can be seen everywhere are beautiful scenery. The concave shape is a good place to take photos. The photos taken are very romantic and will be used in the circle of friends, and the photo production rate is extremely high!

msg:Sanya in September has lost the hustle and bustle of summer. The experience is super good and the service is very nice. The breakfast is rich in variety, combining Chinese and Western styles. The shuttle bus in the park is on call and the room cleaning items are replenished in a timely manner. The water in the private swimming pool is very clear. There are also cleaning staff who regularly clean the fallen leaves and filter the pool water. The afternoon tea is very cool, the cocktails are beautiful, the violent bear production is very interesting, the minibar is also very interesting, overall, the family two-bedroom pool villa is very good, suitable for a family leisure vacation. The beach behind the Marriott is also relatively flat, the sand is soft, but the waves are relatively large, so it is not recommended. Swimming in the sea and the coconut grove lawns by the sea are very romantic. The entire hotel area is lush and lush with shadows of trees. I will come back again if I have the opportunity. It is a pity that September is the windy season with lots of rain.

On the way back from hiking at the beach during the day, I felt great playing relaxing music!

msg:Stayed for two nights in a two-bedroom suite with swimming pool and overall felt pretty good! The day before check-in, the hotel housekeeper Cora called to greet and add contact information, and sent an introduction to the hotel and surrounding travel guide, which was very considerate! Then the check-in was quick and smooth, and there were electric cars and staff in the lobby to take us and our luggage to the room (although it's not far to walk, it's nice to have a car to take us there on rainy days). The hotel has a beautiful, quiet and comfortable environment, and there is also a public swimming pool. Using it, you can also walk to the beach and enjoy the sea breeze. I'm quite satisfied with the room and accommodation. It's the standard of a resort hotel! Then the swimming pool has a lot of fallen leaves due to rain, and the staff will clean it in time. Maybe the only thing I wasn't satisfied with during my stay was that when I ordered food late at night, there were very few choices, and I was disappointed that the burgers didn't taste very good.

msg:I arrived at night and the processing speed was faster. A little brother helped bring the luggage to the room.
There was a light fragrance in the room, which smelled quite good. The lights inside have been turned on for us. As soon as we entered the door, we felt that the room was so big and bright. There are no bugs in the room and the sound insulation is very good. I live on the top floor. It is very healing to open the curtains early in the morning. There is no side sea view as mentioned in the online reviews, but it is actually much better than I expected. And the air conditioning is quite powerful, which is in line with my imagination of vacation. You can spend an afternoon in the room.
Thank you very much to Cathy, the housekeeper, for her service. She responded very quickly to all requests. If you need anything, just contact her directly. She will tell you clearly where to use the various privilege coupons on Ctrip. I also contacted him that night to help find the sunglasses that I had forgotten in Yatri and delivered them to the room in time. It's really pretty good.
It was pretty good to take a stroll around the public area. There are three swimming pools. Although I didn’t go in, there were no fallen leaves or floating objects visible to the naked eye. It's quite clean and you can walk directly to the beach. However, the waves in Haitang Bay are too strong and the wind is very strong, so you have to step on the water. The sand is still very fine.
Before I left, I also received jw shampoo and fragrance as a gift. I think I will still choose it when I come to Sanya.

Let me ask a few questions to help you sort them out.
1. The room smells musty and damp.
2. The sound insulation of the room is not good, which is really bad. Stayed two nights in a row, it was really not quiet!
3. The bedding quality is extremely poor. It’s not as soft as the Art next door. The paste is so heavy that it makes a noise when turning over. The bedding is so uncomfortable. Finally, the child was covered with a bath towel.
That being said, the service is still good. Children love fruit cake. The hair dryer is Dyson, the stereo is Boss.
Alas, the hardware is flawed.

Marriott's swimming pool is also very beautiful. If you want to play children's facilities or watch the sea, there is a special car to take you to the adjacent Sheraton at any time. The doormen and drivers are very enthusiastic. Every time I pick up takeaway, they always smile and greet. All in all, I am satisfied with everything here, and plan to stay for a few days next year. By the way, several people asked to check out early when they checked in, but because they booked a non-refundable room and the supervisor was not there, one of the girls started making trouble, overturning many very heavy chairs at the front desk, and throwing things around. Very arrogant, obviously he has no sense of contract to be so confident, I'm used to it! If she gave the hotel a bad review because of this, here, I want to say something fair for the hotel.

When I checked in again, it was obvious that the aura and a**osphere of the hotel had changed from the gloomy and gloomy a**osphere just after the epidemic to become clear and energetic. It is said that the entire Haitang Bay JW Hotel has only more than 140 rooms. As the hotel with the fewest rooms in the entire Haitang Bay, the ultra-low population density reduces a lot of noise and noise, making it more suitable for vacation and rest. The Spanish architectural style also incorporates the positive sunshine of the people of the Iberian Peninsula, the passionate characteristics of fire, leisure and conten**ent, and enjoying life are also the soul characteristics of Haitang Bay jw. The professional, meticulous and enthusiastic service of Alex in the front office also adds a bit of comfort to the leisure and vacation. JW brand positioning is not only the luxury of hardware, but also the soft details are the foundation of a luxury brand. The only regret is that the rooms must be booked in advance. There are too few rooms and they are full from time to time.

The sea and the sky are the same at a glance~ The hotel facilities are better than those in a forest in the same bay There are too many~ Lele, the vip manager who knocked on the blackboard, is meticulous and thoughtful. He specially called to remind us of the buffet dinner that we didn’t pay attention to in the package. He also helped coordinate the lunch at the western restaurant on the last day. Hele crab tastes good, and Carefully pay attention to the check-in experience, service details, etc., next time Sanya is the first choice for Marriott!

They gave us welcome fruits and coconuts. The experience was great. It takes only 5 minutes to walk to the beach. It happens that fishermen catch fish and collect their nets on the beach at night. Children can experience the process of fishermen fishing and the joy of harvesting at close range. There are a lot of sand crabs on the beach, and you can play crabs for a long time. The breakfast is also very rich and worth recommending.

msg:This trip to Haitang Bay is thanks to the thoughtful arrangement of the Marriott butler Miaomiao. Miao Miao added me on WeChat in advance to understand the needs, and make various coordination arrangements online at any time during the stay. We hit it off right away when we arrived at the hotel. We are very capable of working. We are very satisfied with the room we arranged. The room is very spacious, very clean and well-equipped. The drinks in the room and the dehumidifier are all well received. We stayed for three nights in a row, so comfortable that we couldn't bear to leave. He also took good care of us. When we first arrived in Hainan, we were not used to the climate, and we were a bit heatstroked by the "enthusiasm" in Hainan. Miaomiao immediately arranged cool coconuts to relieve the heat. Going to the duty-free shop also helps to book a bus in advance. Car pick-up and car delivery, all kinds of caring care, I will not list them one by one. Our whole family feels that we have enjoyed a one-to-one VIP customer experience. Especially the children mentioned several times that this stay was very pleasant. The facilities of this Marriott hotel are also very new, and every staff member I met greeted with a smile and was very enthusiastic. It deserves a higher evaluation from Ctrip.

msg:Haitang Bay JW Marriott's resort hotel is mainly designed in Spanish style. If it is here, it will give people the feeling of "straying into" Spain. Spires, corridors, and arches can be seen everywhere. It is a good place to see the scenery. It’s also a photo with a concave shape. The hotel Lele’s service is great, and she always cares about us
It is spacious and bright, with a private balcony, and the design style is full of modern beauty, creating a pleasant relaxation experience. The room is well-equipped, clean and hygienic, and the bed and toiletries are all available. Entrance leads to tranquility-The building of the hotel purchases "stone" as the element, a single-family building
The design encloses the beach and the coconut grove grassland, creating a quiet, comfortable, retro and luxurious Spanish-style resort for us
Prosperous when you get out - the hotel is located in the center of Haitang Bay, very close to the food court and duty-free shops. The transportation is convenient. Light-colored configuration, simple and stylish decoration design, tall floor-to-ceiling windows, low-key luxury
I really like the design of the bed facing the landscape balcony, and you can see the beautiful scenery as soon as you open your eyes; Tian swimming pool room is really popular. You can drink freely from the minibar in the room. It's really comfortable to soak in the private pool and enjoy the vacation. Looking down is the fountain. The combination of salty and sweet snacks and a glass of island holiday, it is so pleasant to have a panoramic view of the hotel while blowing the sea breeze...

There are sticky things on the toilet seat and stains on the cups. I called cleaning to re-clean. I thought it was nothing at first, but it’s okay for our hotel service staff to wash their hands in the room after cleaning. Is it necessary to get water all over the floor? If the water gets on the floor, I ask you to clean the floor again and leave when there is still water. up? The sanitation is not considered clean, and it is very angry to do this. To be honest, a JW priced at 2,000 yuan is really not as good as a Hilton priced at 1,800 Yalong, so some people say that it is cost-effective?

There is a large swimming pool, and the greenery is well done, mainly for playing. There is also a serious ***** pool, where you can really swim. The hotel is very close to the beach, the sea in Sanya is really blue
Near the beach, right by the sea, there are mushrooms made of thatch on the beach

There are also "Tomato Coconut Chicken and Spicy" three kinds of small hot pot bottoms, all of which are my favorite!!!~

I made an appoin**ent for the bed, and quickly helped to fix it.
I gave the child a bear and a travel toiletry set for the child.
Basically, the response is very fast and enthusiastic.

hotel swimming pool
There is a curtain, a good hand for sunshade. . Because there are few people, the experience is super good.
There are 1.2m and 0.9 options, the children are very happy

seaside
It's only a three-minute walk (walking from the hotel's breakfast room), not an exaggeration. really close. The sand is fine and the sea is nice and clean. Very recommended. Also because there are few people, the experience is very good.

Food
There was a dinner at the hotel, the bread was delicious, the others were average, and there was a harp playing. It's not a stepping stone, but it's not recommended either. You can take a taxi to Square 68 to eat coconut chicken, try it.
The breakfast was much better than expected, rich in variety and delicious, recommended.
Afternoon tea, I can't understand it, it's just the scenery. . (I'm not a sweet tooth)

Children's Paradise
If you have played Neilbao mini Mars, this children's playground is very ordinary. Face painting is free. The bubble blowing activity at the door is good, just ask the hotel for the arrangement. And this children's paradise is in the Sheraton next door, not Marriott Benhao.

Hotel facilities
The sound insulation is a bit bad, you can hear someone singing KTV in the toilet. But I can't hear it in bed.
The bed is very comfortable, the two-meter bed is not the kind of splicing.

Before the trip, the hotel called to confirm, and added the WeChat of the hotel's VIP manager Eileen Lele, and the beauty began. The morning before the trip, Eileen Lele informed me that I was upgraded to a premium sea view king bed room😄 After arriving, I found some minor problems in the room. After contacting Lele, the service response and problem solving were still very fast. Lele took the initiative to ask every day Do I need help or personal requirements? After experiencing the buffet breakfast, dinner set and Jing afternoon tea included in the hotel package, I personally feel that the hotel’s food and beverage quality is still guaranteed; but I also found that there are many hotel interns, almost all over the depar**ent, so There is still a big gap between service awareness and proficiency. The first impression given to the guests by the front desk and the concierge is rather passive. When they asked about the location of the restroom while dining in the restaurant, the intern girl couldn’t answer, so she needed to ask other waiters for help... Fortunately, the one-on-one service provided by the hotel’s VIP butler promptly followed up, making the check-in The overall feeling is quite comfortable. Before leaving the store, I also received a surprise (picture 5) small gift from Lele, which marked a perfect end to this solo trip.

The pizza served in the room for lunch is also delicious and fast. Dinner seafood barbecue, from the partner Sheraton Hotel, affordable. The housekeeper, Joey, was attentive and arranged a pool unicorn in advance and delivered coconut water. It is worth staying.

The swimming pool in the room is great. Although the decoration facilities are a bit outdated, But it is still very clean and tidy, and the decoration style is also very nice.

msg:The best way to travel in Sanya is to stay in a daze at the hotel ☺️ After the hotel is selected, it is basically 👌. I have been to Sanya more than a dozen times, and this is the first time to stay at the Marriott. This hotel is a European-style palace style, which pays more attention to privacy , the space is divided more finely. Surprisingly, the housekeeper Joey I met when I checked in, the room type was upgraded to a luxury pool room by four consecutive levels for free, which is amazing, with considerate service throughout the whole process, which is extra worry-free and a pleasant vacation!

Room: The houses in the villa area are spacious and bright, with private entrances. If you go out (as long as you are in the resort area), there will be a car to pick you up regardless of the distance. The decoration is also very elegant and of high quality, unlike some "upstarts" decoration style.
Service: Really considerate. When checking in, I left the contact information of the manager Eileen Lele, super super super nice! ! Answer all my questions promptly, comprehensively and patiently! ! (For Xiaobai, who is here for the first time, he is so friendly) Hearing that it is our wedding anniversary, we specially arranged honeymoon decorations~ 520 also gave us roses on the day 🌹~Lucky~
Others: If you choose the villa area, you can’t watch the sea from the room, but the comfortable environment is worth it~ After this stay, I highly recommend Marriott, the nicest, it’s really "holiday style"! ! ! There are no children crying and shouting, no crowding, no tourists punching in. It is really comfortable and a pleasant weekend~~

Garden design: This one is very good! The wind in the Mediterranean manor is very strong! As soon as you enter the garden, you feel Spain. Holiday sense: full! Catering: The products of the all-day dining restaurant are quite good, and every dish is delicious. Highly recommend the Vietnamese Beef Noodles! It is a very good resort hotel in Sanya!

msg:The staff at this Marriott hotel are very distinctive, with their lazy temperament. If you want to come to this resort hotel for a vacation, be prepared for a more resort-like attitude from the staff. It can be said that it is full of surprises. From the loan-like front desk where you forget where your luggage list is, to the restaurant usher taking you to the service desk to get a bottle of disinfectant and then walking back to the seat at the door, while you are getting your meal quickly. Take away your tableware and sit two meters away from the bar where the manager is chatting in the lobby. At noon, the room card was demagnetized and the room could not be entered. Ask customer service. Two managers came to try it out. After waiting for 20 minutes, the technician finally When you open the door, the first thing the manager asks is if you want to go out. I dare not go out until check-out. Don't increase the workload of the service staff and let them have a good vacation. It's really hard to benchmark any hotel, as these people seem to be retiring tomorrow. If it wasn't better than other Marriott hotels, I would have thought it was Marriott's corporate culture. None of the above involves the aging of hotel facilities. What is more serious is the aging of service management.

This stay has a very good impact on Marriott. Although the facilities are not the latest in this area, the rooms are well maintained in all aspects. Since the room was on the first floor, it was relatively damp, so the housekeeper thoughtfully sent two dehumidifiers and deodorized them.
A cute doll and a cleaning kit of Palma water were given to me when I checked in. I cleaned the swimming pool and changed the water before I checked in. The water quality is very clean. It is also convenient for the hotel to go to the beach. It is not recommended to go into the water in Haitang Bay, but the scenery is still very good when you walk by the beach OK The mini bar is replenished for free every day, basic soft drinks are available, as well as fruits and chips, and the buffet is also complete. Generally speaking, I am very satisfied with this stay. Especially thanks to the butler, the meticulous care shown throughout the stay is heartwarming, next time I bring my children to Sanya, I will consider staying in this hotel.

The design of the hotel, like a huge manor, has a strong Spanish style, as if in a foreign country. Along the winding stone road, through the swimming pool and green plants and flowers, you can see the wishing pool. There is an exquisite library in the lobby, which is classical and elegant.

The wooden floor is matched with white walls, and there are many Nanyang-style fans on the top. The overall look is very warm. You can lie in the big bathtub and take a bath.
Tasting red wine quietly is simply not too relaxing and too enjoyable. I love the floor-to-ceiling windows! The swaying coconut trees..., the blue sea, the scenery is really wonderful, and everything you see is beautiful!

The green garden of the hotel is connected with the Sheraton next door. The Yacui cafeteria in the middle sings and dances with magic every night on the open-air lawn. The delicious food and craft beer are worth a try. The hotel's own swimming pool is curved and has a nostalgic style, but you must go to the beach and seaside of Haitang Bay to enjoy the majestic scenery. The straight beach is flat for ten kilometers, with continuous white waves and the sound of rumbling waves day and night. All hotels are on this coast. If you like, you can walk into any hotel from the beach to experience different environments.
The overall hotel service is in place. The Rose who received us is very friendly. It is a hotel suitable for couples to spend leisure time. If you bring children, you can consider Sheraton, Shangri-La or Atlantis, which are next door and have more abundant entertainment projects. up.

msg:The temperature in Sanya this season is really wonderful. During the half-month vacation, I chose JW’s two-bedroom villa for 6 days. The price/performance ratio is quite high. The children sleep until they wake up naturally every day. The western restaurant is 7:00-11 every day. The long dining time at :00 is also the most humane part of the resort hotel. There are many small animals in the hotel 🐰🐑🦚🐢 that can be fed, and there are clown performances in the playground every day. The children have a lot of fun every day. The front desk Ms. Lele also enthusiastically asks 🈶️🈚️needs every day. She is very heartwarming. Both adults and children have received gifts 🎁 carefully prepared by the hotel. In short, except for the force majeure mosquito😂, everything else is very satisfactory. The family brings children here Vacation, if you want to free your hands, you are right to choose here! 😄

After going through the luxury collection period, some of them were refurbished and changed their brand. JW Marriott is different from Haitang Bay Hotel in recent years. It is a rare pure hotel.
The overall experience is very good. It has a very holiday a**osphere. The quality of staff and service is very good.
In addition, we have arranged a single-bedroom single-bedroom house with the best location. The overall distribution is reasonable and the design is graceful and luxurious. The swimming pool is also fully swimmable, not a decoration
Except for the musty smell that cannot be avoided because of the seaside, everything else is great
[transportation
Located in Haitang Bay, the only transportation is self-driving or Didi Chuxing. Overall, it is very convenient
[Serve
Lele's service is full marks, almost responsive
[FOOD
I tried the waterside pavilion for breakfast. The Sheraton self-service waterside pavilion, which can be hung with a tent, is very artistic. In addition, it is a rare and romantic outdoor restaurant.
Because the hotel is small in size, the breakfast room is like a lounge breakfast, but it is very delicate and rich
The Sheraton buffet next door has performances and the outdoor location is relatively ordinary. The room is more than 70 square meters. From my understanding of major hotels in Sanya, the suites of many hotels are not as good as it! The white tone of the room is French style, really What's more, there are a pair of sinks and a separate bathtub in minutes. The facilities are complete. When you check in, you will have a Parma bath set gift box. It's so amazing! Open the glass window of the room and you will see the private swimming pool. Heart, privacy is very good, especially suitable for Ge Youlai!
The food in this hotel is delicious. The buffet in the morning is of high quality. You can try the coconut chicken here at noon. , if you don’t want to eat hot pot. , the restaurant here also offers special stir-fried dishes from all over the world~ the afternoon tea is also very ok, the waffle hearts are better than the dessert shop~ all kinds of desserts are very suitable for my appetite~ I like desserts. My family members must come to taste it in the afternoon~ I have to boast that JW's buffet breakfast is served until 11 o'clock, which is too humane! Those who love to sleep late can finally have breakfast
This year, I chose JW Marriott Hotel Sanya Haitang Bay for my first seaside vacation. The predecessor of JW Marriott Resort Haitang Bay was Yu Haitang Bay, a Luxury Collection Resort. Arcades, light-colored stone walls with red pottery tiles, as well as Peacock Pavilion and Octagonal Wishing Pool, the vacation time is minutes
Crossing to the coast of Spain. And the day before the check-in, it was upgraded to a premium sea view room (high floor), which is simply too niceo
hotel room
The hotel has more than 400 exquisite and modern rooms and suites. You can look around the wonders of mountains and seas, overlook the bay that stretches for thousands of miles, and the lush tropical scenery without leaving home. Enjoy the gorgeous sunrise and sunset~
Hotel Features
Garden: There are large expanses of green grass, which is very suitable for taking pictures and making public announcements, and the production rate should not be too high.
Beach: The sand on the beach is very white and fine, there are a lot of deck chair dust on the beach, there are many sea games, and the waves are suitable for simple surfing. When there is a sun dance, the sea is very blue and beautiful.

We are going to the Universal Food City outside the hotel. The little brother at the door drives us Delivered to the gate of Sheraton, and when we came back, we called to tell us to drive us back to the hotel. The staff in the restaurant were polite, warm and thoughtful. The set meal was given with a 200 yuan food and beverage consumption credit. There is a conditional one-time deduction in the restaurant. The content of each set meal was very clear when we checked in. There was a small episode from the guests in the next room, who chatted loudly on the balcony until 0:00, and failed to inform the front desk by phone, so we had to knock on the door next door and calm down after communicating with her. Other than that, the experience was all Very good, I will choose Marriott again next time! Breakfast was great too!

I thought it was because I was demanding too much, but after I came back, my wife also said that the attitude of the staff who answered the phone was vicious. It is not worthy of the service standard of the Marriott Hotel. Where does the service depar**ent of a resort hotel have such high self-confidence? I was wondering if it was the Sheraton next door who transferred the staff? In short, I am very disappointed with the service level of Marriott. I hope you will continue to maintain your arrogance like the funny hotel butler in the movie The Richest Man in Xihong City!

It is rare to share the elevator with other people. Basically, I have never seen other guests in the corridor. Only at breakfast can I find that there are really full rooms. During the stay, Chappie's service was very good. We booked the Sheraton Buffet. Sheraton said that the seats are determined according to the order of reservations. We can't inform you when you make a reservation, but you will call to inform them the next afternoon. I waited all afternoon and didn't receive a call, so I mentioned it to Chappie on WeChat, and immediately helped us confirm the seat reservation with the Sheraton Cafeteria. Because of our taste problem, the afternoon tea was not very appetizing, and it was immediately replaced with small snacks for us. I encountered some trivial matters during the stay, and I felt the quality of Marriott in the service of the staff.

I stayed for one more night and not only helped to upgrade the room, but also gave me an extra set of toiletry set. The overall feeling of staying here is very good, except for Begonia The wind in the bay is a bit strong, and it is only a 7-minute drive from the duty-free shop. Next time I come to Marriott, I will choose Marriott✌️

The Spanish style in the hotel is romantic and beautiful! The breakfast is very rich, and there is no need to eat lunch at all! Special thanks to our butler, Lele, for his enthusiasm and thoughtfulness for satisfying my Virgo perfectionism 😜 Before checking out, I added the earl brigade to take a lot of beautiful photos on the undulating sea! Happy trip to Sanya 🎈

As soon as you enter the hotel lobby, you can immediately feel the elegant and quiet a**osphere. I really love the 1.2-1.5m deep swimming pool; the restaurant on the first floor is always open to receive guests, and it tastes good 👍The service staff at the front desk are kind and friendly.

Before checking into the hotel, we have arranged to upgrade the room type. After check-in, I also sent the toiletries of the Water of Palma. It coincided with Valentine's Day, and the hotel also sent flowers and chocolates. The sunset, the beach, and the coconut grove are all beautiful, a great experience.

msg:One sentence summary: super cost-effective top luxury hotel.
 That's right, it's cost-effective. After experiencing the hotel's hardware and software, I really think, wow, it's worth the money!

I have come to Sanya N times, each time I will choose a different hotel to stay, because I will experience different feelings. This time the check-in experience, I would like to call it the service ceiling.
If you stay in the peak season, the general hotel is not so thoughtful, and everyone understands the reason. But it won't! Two days before check-in, the exclusive butler will contact you in advance to understand your preferences and needs. I would like to thank my housekeeper, Alex Fu Xing, for being caring, caring, and caring. It’s all about you. Thank you for making my trip to Sanya a complete one.

Dining: There are not many restaurants in the hotel, but the exquisiteness is brought to the extreme, simple but brilliant. The breakfast pick-up area is very concentrated, no need to run around, the dining environment is very good, especially the outdoor is super beautiful. There are various set menus to choose from for dinner, and you can experience a feast in a top luxury hotel with a full sense of ceremony.
Environment: Western-style retro-style design, with a kind of classical beauty, no exaggerated architecture, but you can feel the high-end taste. The hotel's own beach, heated swimming pool, and garden are all standard features.
Room: The room I stayed in this time was not satisfactory, only very, very, very satisfied. The room is spacious and has its own independent swimming pool. The pool has been specially cleaned. Although the weather is cold and there is no water, the clear water quality makes me happy. The equipment is complete, and the equipment level of the hotel can be seen from the Dyson hair dryer.
Service: The most satisfying thing is the service. During the peak season, every hotel has a queue, and the check-in in the best hotel is very poor, but through reasonable planning, the experience is excellent and the check-in is fast. Free drinks in the room, welcome fruit, and Parma gift box are all surprises. Responding to needs, super praise.

The quality of the people staying in the hotel is very high. Even in the peak season, there is no overcrowding or crowded feeling. If you want to experience the joy of a luxury hotel, it is highly recommended, whether you are a couple, business, parent-child, you must come here once!
PS: The hotel has a free filming, so it’s a super film here~

The water quality is very clean and clean. The restaurant has a comfortable dining environment. The hotel is also connected to the adjacent Sheraton Hotel, and the Chinese restaurant is shared. Overall very satisfied.

msg:During the Spring Festival this year, we stayed at the JW Marriott Hotel. The hotel service was very good. We upgraded to the exclusive sea view room for free. The environment of the hotel is beautiful, just like being in a park. We rarely meet other tourists when walking in the garden. It is not easy to meet such a clean hotel in Sanya, which is crowded with people during the Spring Festival season, and it is very relaxing physically and mentally. During the period, many of our requests were met by Ms. Kathy, the front desk manager of the hotel, and she took the initiative to ask if there were any other needs. It is recommended to charter a driver. The driver is a sister from the Northeast, which is also very good, because we have brought children, especially provide a few bottles of drinking water, give small New Year gifts, and other small details are very considerate. You can see the sunrise from the balcony on the fourth floor, and the experience of watching the sea through the coconut grove is also great. It fully satisfies my husband's request to stay away from the crowds in Sanya during the Spring Festival. The photos in the hotel are very good, and my friend said it is very southern France 🙂. This time we did not go to popular attractions, and spent most of our time wandering around the hotel and playing by the sea. This hotel fits the meaning of this trip very well.

msg:Over the years, we have stayed in more than 2/3 of the hotels in Haitang Bay, and there are not many that make people want to stay here again. However, Marriott's stay this time has given many surprises, from hardware to service, it is worth mentioning. The style of the hotel is Spanish. When you enter the lobby, you really feel like you are on vacation abroad. Chappie Xiaochen, the check-in staff at the front desk, is very meticulous in service. He added WeChat to answer questions. He is very professional and empathetic! The child took a nap and delayed check-out, and he also helped with the delay, very considerate! In this regard, it is obviously better than many hotels around. Everyone has professionalism. Only by truly humanized service can we shorten the distance with guests.
The children's playground in the hotel has a heated swimming pool and a small train, and the children are very happy to play.
When I come to Haitang Bay for the first time, I will choose to live in Atlantis, but I will not go there again. It is colorful but not warm. One experience is enough, but I will come again to Marriott. I have a real vacation experience and the service is also very good In place, suitable for the whole family to come together, the family will love this.

msg:This is the first time I stayed at JW Marriott Haitang Bay. I booked a family studio suite and a twin room. The family studio suite has a bed that is slightly smaller. It is located in the living room and is not very private. There is only one room in the whole suite. The bathing place is only suitable for families~
advantage:
1. Personally, I like the garden of the hotel the most. It is the kind of garden that grows naturally and freely. Almost all the aisles are covered with green shade. It is really beautiful! The park is also very quiet, with fewer children, and it is the quietest among all the hotels I have stayed in this time (except for the noise of in-flight entertainment)
2. The room is large, comfortable to move around, and the layout is very reasonable.
3. The breakfast suite can be eaten in Yuexuan, and the dishes are also available if there are not many people.
4. Before going, the housekeeper Sunny confirmed the arrival time, and arranged check-in in the peak season without waiting.
5. The airport drop-off service is really considerate.
6. Marriott's bed and pillows are the most comfortable!
shortcoming:
1. It is indeed too humid. The room is facing north, and the laundry cannot be dried at all, and the room does have a musty smell. Trying to ventilate ➕ air conditioner ➕ dehumidifier can only slightly eliminate the musty smell (3rd floor)
2. The suite can go to Yuexuan for dinner. We only found out by accident in the last few days, and no one informed us in advance.
3. The phones in the two rooms are either broken or the room service cannot be reached, it is purely by chance to meet the waiter.

Overall, if you can bear a bit of smell, the hotel is good.

msg:This is the last hotel I stayed in Sanya this time, and it is also the hotel I am most satisfied with, from environment to sanitation to catering and especially service. The day before check-in, Alex contacted in advance to confirm the room requirements and lock the room. You can check in at any time. For us who were blacklisted and wanted to leave the previous Fairmont hotel early, we were really happy 😃 The room layout is reasonable, Spacious and comfortable. On the last day, there was a problem with the swimming pool, and Alex opened another villa to share with the two, in order to make it easier for the baby to play in the water. Besides, the Chinese restaurant tastes good, because I wanted to try different dishes every night after staying for 5 consecutive days, but the speed was too slow on the third day and I waited for an hour, the child couldn't sit still, and my father was in a hurry, and the person in charge rushed to chase all the dishes The food was delivered to the room by the waiter for free. I felt that the child would not be hungry after waiting for too long, and it was hard for the waiter to walk so far with the heavy porcelain basin and kept trying not to get angry. Other room concierge services are also on call. The Sheraton next door can take children to watch small animals, feed ducks, fish, etc...You can only participate in these at a young age. The only suggestion is that the hotel can build its own children's playground or renovate the Sheraton's children's playground, because I have a baby. There are too many children's playgrounds, and I personally feel that apart from the slides, everything else is devastated and lacks sanitation...

msg:I stayed in three hotels successively during my vacation in Sanya, and Marriott is the most comfortable one. The service is really good. The butler, Rose, is a gentle little sister. She always solves the problems raised in the first time. She upgraded the pool room for us. The children had a great time and even delayed the check-out. Marriott's garden design is very good, with various swimming pools inlaid in it, emphasizing privacy, suitable for leisure vacations. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the taste is not bad. Haitang Bay has a good view and cannot go into the sea. It is suitable for walking or booking water sports. Duty-free shops are nothing interesting, not as good as those in Haikou, and they are hyped by Internet celebrities outrageously! The same is true for the water world. Those who have been to Chimelong Water Park will feel that it is very small, and once is enough. When I went out this time, both hotels booked Marriott's brands, which exceeded my original love for InterContinental. Haitang Bay Marriott is really good, and I will come again next time.

Red ceramic tiles, arcades, peacock pavilions, stone walls, etc. can be easily photographed. Blockbuster Jane can also punch in and run the same octagonal wishing pool as men, and shoot international blockbusters in minutes!
This time, Lele added WeChat in advance and arranged a very good room. Even during the Spring Festival, there was no waiting for a room. I like JW's elegant and restrained style very much. The room is about 70 square meters. Looking around is the garden of the hotel. It's the blue sea, sitting on the balcony drinking ice and spritz. It's a good choice to be in a daze. The living room is large and you can host parties. I think it's very cost-effective!
The hotel has a number of restaurants to choose from. Among them, the Yacui Seaside Restaurant is a buffet dinner restaurant with a Malaysian style, where you can eat authentic Malaysian food. , while watching the wonderful performance, the a**osphere is great, very suitable for bringing parents and children together! Cafe
The hotel has a considerate bus pick-up and drop-off service. After dinner, there will be fruit delivered by the butler* to the room to enjoy~ Dining features
You can enjoy gourmet delicacies at JW Kitchen, an open all-day dining restaurant where you can watch chefs cook live. , you can also drink special cocktails and wines from all over the world in the JW Lounge, which is full of rich tropical a**osphere.
In addition, the hotel gym is open 24 hours a day, and there is also a spa. You can also go to experience it. The breakfast is rich, with many choices, and it lasts until 10:30. If you sleep late, you are not afraid to miss it!

He connected with me before I checked in (told me that the room would have to wait one day in advance), and I said the room was out before I came on the day of check-in, but I still had to queue up after I arrived. Waiting, Lele took the rest of the day and actively helped me communicate, and gave me free drinks and snacks (similar to Ferris wheel snacks) while waiting, and later upgraded the room type (with a private pool, not a heated pool, the weather is cold these two days, it’s useless, but The child will be happy to ride the little yellow duck on it. It should be very comfortable in summer.) There is also an extra bed and breakfast for the child for free (haha, can these be said?) I don’t know if others will be envious? The hotel's beach is average, but the hotel's park is very large. It is recommended to take a small train tour around. It has been windy recently, but it is very comfortable in the park. The trees block the wind and the sun is comfortable. When I came to Sanya, I only read bad reviews and there was no hotel I could live in. Compared with the five-star hotel rooms of the same level, the room facilities of this hotel may be a bit old-fashioned. But still recommended. Five-star praise. If only Lele’s service is as good as Lele’s.

I will definitely want to come here for the second time. The design of this JW Marriott is so classic, it is very comfortable to live in, and the staff service is also excellent, especially Lele helped solve the problem of continuing the stay, which is very good
       This time I stayed in a garden view room on the 3rd floor
The white-toned interior decoration is very simple and bright as a whole, and the outside is covered by lush vegetation. It feels like living in a secret manor, and the recent sunshine in Sanya is so sunny that you can swim in your own swimming pool
This room type is very suitable for people like me who like to stay in hotels. The environment is very good and there are not many people.
When you get off the bus, there will be a waiter to help open the door to pick up your luggage, and the luggage will be particularly proactive to help you store it without us having to take it to check in. This service is really good.
The standard room is very big, it seems that the hotel rooms start at 70 square meters. The room facilities are very good, equipped with a humidifier.
The garden is beautiful, and there are not many people on the beach. Sitting on the balcony of the room and looking at the garden view will feel very relaxing
I gave fruit and a fragrant Parma care set, which was a pleasant surprise, and I will choose it again next time.

The hotel is so crowded.

When I get up every day, I will face the coconut grove, beach, sea, sunrise and sunset. It’s not too beautiful. When I come to Sanya again, this hotel and this suite are still my favorites. The second choice! The service of the hotel is really good. Lele added WeChat when I checked in again, and followed up my check-in experience at any time. The service is really considerate and I decided to stay for 3 nights
【Supporting facilities】
The facilities of the resort hotel are really good. The minibar is free. There will be four bottles of beer and some drinks every day, and a potato chip. Comrades don’t need to buy alcohol by themselves! Full of happiness!
When you check in, you will get a set of Parma’s toiletry sample, which is extravagant, and the welcome fruit will also be delivered to the room
【About the environment】
I think the environment of the hotel in Sanya is very good. After all, it is very comfortable to lie down in the hotel. There is a large coconut grove and swimming pool
I think the swimming pool is much better than the Marriott in Bialong Bay. It is very considerate. It is shaded and walks along the coconut grove to the beach. You can have a panoramic view of the scenery.
【About food】
The food in this hotel is delicious, and the buffet in the morning is very high-grade. You can try the coconut chicken here at noon. If you don’t want to eat hot pot, the restaurant here also offers special stir-fried dishes from all over the world~

It is relatively close to Wuzhizhou Island, and the duty-free shop is also very close by taxi. The hotel overall is very good, and I will choose it next time

2 The first room we stayed in had a strong musty smell. After feedback, we adjusted to another room with a slightly smaller smell. It may depend on your luck during the peak tourist season, and you may encounter a musty room but no room to change.
3 The hotel paid a deposit of more than 2,000 yuan when checking in, which has not been refunded yet. At first it was said that it would be refunded within 48 hours, but later it was changed to 3-5 days. Then it was said that the employee had made the wrong deduction when deducting the room fee, and it would take a month before the refund could be made. I would like to remind everyone to pay more attention and check your bank statements in a timely manner.

Helen also made a welcome arrangement for us, and will also rent a small electric donkey for you~ Ms. Chappie at the front desk It's also very considerate~ Check-in is also very fast~ Overall, the experience is excellent! It's really good, and I will come again next time

The housekeeper Lele helped to borrow a whole set of tea-making tea sets to the room, and also delivered afternoon tea desserts. The service is thoughtful and enthusiastic. Like it 👍Wake up early in the morning after the rain and it was sunny. I took a yoga online class by the pool, an unforgettable experience.

msg:JW Marriott Hotel Sanya Haitang Bay
Among the many Internet celebrity hotels in Sanya, this unexpected hotel is full of surprises. First of all, the service attitude is very good, with fresh welcome fruits and a set of Hermès toiletries in each room, which is full of luxury. The jw Marriott is newly renovated. It is a light French-style building as soon as you enter the door. The corridors are very beautiful and the facilities are also very new. room type
I booked a deluxe sea view room, and Lele helped me upgrade to a sea view room on a high floor, which is especially suitable for couples. The room is also French-style, and it looks great!
Hotel Features
The water quality of the private beach that comes with the hotel is very good. It is beautiful to take pictures while walking on the beach. Whether it is the lawn or the sea, it is easy to produce pictures everywhere. You can have a good vacation in the hotel for a day without going to the scenic spots. The buffet breakfast is also rich, and the room also includes two breakfasts. In general, it is a hotel full of sincerity that is better than expected and more surprising. It is worth recommending!
Lele at the front desk was very kind to help us with late check-out, knowing that we were going to Wanning, she was very kind to help us arrange it, and I will contact her next time

The musty smell is heavy ventilation + dehumidification, and the next day is basically not too heavy. This price + minibar is free every day and completely accepted 🉑️

msg:The last two days of traveling with my parents found that we still wanted to live in Haitang Bay. On a temporary basis, we checked into the hotel we booked the day before, and we were quite satisfied with our stay. We were greeted by Chappie, a very responsible little brother. From the beginning of check-in, he patiently answered every question we had, and introduced the duty-free discounts in the room and the travel photos that my mother was interested in. And helped to upgrade the room to the 4th floor (Marriott's building is not high and has 4 floors in total, so our original room type on the 3rd floor has a poor view of the sea). During the check-in process, he patiently answered every question we had and reminded us in time The time and location of the nucleic acid test at the hotel also kindly gave us a high-value dessert afternoon tea. Our last day's itinerary was due to our flight at five or six in the afternoon. After contacting Chappie, he would help us check whether it could be delayed and help us as soon as he got to work. Late check-out until two o'clock, it's really user-friendly👍👍

1. Environment: The entire hotel is decorated in a European style, and the garden design is well integrated with tropical plants and European gardens to take pictures! The most outstanding point is that the privacy is very high. Whether it is the moving line of the garden, the swimming pool, the rest area or the restaurant, the overall feeling is very quiet, and the sense of isolation from other guests is very high. This point beats the Sheraton and Shangri-La next door. It is especially suitable for people who like quietness and privacy and want to stay away from parent-child hotels. I really chose the right one! !

2. Room: The space is quite large, retaining the European decoration style, and there is an entrance hall to ensure privacy. The sleeping area, washing area, dressing room, rest area and circulation are all designed reasonably. The sofa and bedding are quite comfortable to rest on. The cleaning is timely, the toiletries, drinking water, and the minibar are replenished in a timely manner. The disadvantages are: 1. The European-style hot and cold water switches are kept separate in the bathroom, which is a bit troublesome to use. 2. There are some omissions in the maintenance of some furniture, such as the light of the vanity mirror cannot be turned on, the bedside audio cannot be turned on, and the sound of the regular aroma diffuser is too loud

3. Breakfast: The taste is quite satisfactory. There are Chinese and Western food, fruits, vegetables, desserts and cold dishes. The variety level is in the middle of several restaurants in Haitang Bay. It is not suitable for traveling with children to eat, but our group is all adults and we also like to eat lightly and comfortably in this breakfast category. In particular, their freshly brewed black tea is really delicious!

4. Service: The person in charge of our little brother Chappie has nothing to say. Personally, I feel that the overall service needs to be improved: the main performance is that the shuttle bus is not timely, and it takes a long time to wait for a few calls, and even the staff who answered the phone couldn't verify the location for half a day. The concierge is not proficient in packing boxes, and (in the end my husband packed it himself) the pick-up car is not proficient. But I personally think it is harmless, because I actually value the privacy and non-interference of a person on vacation more than the staff who are on call everywhere.

msg:A super-budget hotel package pre-sold on Ctrip. The hotel is located in Haitang Bay. The location is very convenient. It is about 2-4 kilometers to duty-free shops and popular restaurants around. There is a food court about 50 meters away.
The check-in experience is very good, because I am a couple, I prefer quiet. When choosing a hotel, I chose this hotel. The main reason is that there are not many rooms in the hotel, so there should be fewer people. As expected, I almost didn’t meet other guests when I went in and out of the hotel. You can only see it when you have breakfast.
Next, let’s talk about the hotel’s service, which is in line with JW Marriott’s usual level. One day before the check-in, the service staff communicated by phone to confirm the expected check-in time of the day, and the room type was also upgraded for us for free. The last day was an evening flight. Specially helped us to delay check-out until 2 o'clock. On the day of check-in, I added the hotel housekeeper Amber on WeChat, so I can communicate with you at any time if you have any questions. There were some minor accidents during the check-in, and Amber was also very considerate to help communicate and deal with them. I want to give Amber a thumbs up here.
The hotel's breakfast is very rich, with a variety of varieties and good taste. The breakfast time is also relatively long, from 7:30-11:00. Those who like to get up early and sleep late will not miss it. Moreover, the service staff in the breakfast restaurant are very considerate, they collect the plates in a timely manner, and the service is particularly enthusiastic. The room was cleaned in a timely manner, and there was a lot of mineral water in the room. The minibar in the booked package can also be used for free every day, which is amazing!
I also went to the spa during my stay at the hotel. It was the most cost-effective time I have ever done in a five-star hotel. It is an independent villa with good privacy. The lady's massage technique is very professional. I chose a 1-hour essential oil body massage+ It only costs 999 for 1 hour of hydrating face, which is very cost-effective.
The design of the hotel is great, I like the European style. Every day, there are many staff resting trees, lawns, and swimming pools. Although it is the off-season, the temperature is a bit low, so I dare not go into the water, but the swimming pool is also very clean, and I can’t find a single leaf. But it is true that the beach is not as good as Yalong Bay. I rented a car and took pictures casually at the hotel. My best friend said that it felt like I was in France.
In addition, the hotel will do nucleic acid every day during the stay, which is very convenient for us, and the result time is about 9-10 hours.
This time I stayed in a sea view room, but it can only be seen from a partial angle. When I was shopping in the hotel, I saw the pool room was very good. It has an independent swimming pool and a courtyard. I plan to try it next time.

msg:If you can't go to Southeast Asia, then you can choose another way and stay at JW Marriott in Sanya.
OK: Taking advantage of the fact that Hainan has just unblocked, the whole family traveled early and checked into Marriott on the 28th. I was a little nervous, but I received a phone call from Marriott-Pony the day before, and added WeChat to facilitate follow-up communication, reminding me The weather, catering and other aspects calmed my uneasy heart. I mentioned Wuzhizhou Island and updated the opening hours for me. Nucleic acid also recommended two nearby ones, including nucleic acid testing points. When I recommend going to the duty-free shop, go later, then you can just do a nucleic acid after shopping!
Stay: I booked a 2-night pool room on Ctrip first, mainly because I was afraid of the recurrence of the epidemic, so I didn’t dare to finalize the next 4 nights. After checking in, the baby had a great time and took us to the pool after breakfast every day. , we were originally struggling to stay in Yanlord or EDITION for the next 4 nights, but we stayed for another 4 nights immediately. Xiaoma patiently explained the difference between the rooms and asked a boy from the concierge to show us. The villa area, the villa area looks good, but staying in the villa for 4 nights does not seem necessary, unless you are not going to go out, it is very comfortable to soak in the villa! So I stayed in the pool room for 2 nights and the villa for 2 nights. I came here and experienced it all. Because 929 was my husband's birthday, I arranged a room for us and prepared a very cute little cake. He thoughtfully upgraded us to a pool set for one night. We basically experienced 3 types of rooms this time, happy! The only thing that needs to be improved is that the paper towels are inconvenient to obtain. The paper towels in the suite are only in the bedroom, and there are no paper towels in the living room. . Every time I have to run to the room, I am a little tired.
Eat: On the day I first arrived, I was exhausted because of the flight at 6:00 in the morning. After settling in, lunch was served directly at the hotel's all-day dining restaurant. I didn't have any big fantasies, because I always felt that the hotel's meals were expensive. It was also unpalatable. I didn't expect that the black tiger prawn seafood cuttlefish rice I ordered was not only eye-catching, but the black tiger prawns were big and delicious, sweet and very Q-bounce. The cuttlefish rice was just right, and there were a lot of shrimp in the rice. The amount is also very large. I ordered a bowl of old Beijing fried noodles for my baby. It was a big night. The three of us ate a little each. My husband ordered a bowl of beef noodles. Big grain! If you stay, you can experience it! Oh, by the way, I can't help but mention the breakfast. It must have reached the upper-middle level. It has everything that should be there. I think the cold dishes are delicious. Generally, who eats cold dishes at the hotel buffet breakfast, hahaha, there are actually high-quality jellyfish. head! Vegetable salad must be eaten every day, very fresh! With black vinegar sauce, delicious and healthy! The noodle husband said it was average, maybe the noodles are not the same as the noodle soup that we Shanghainese like to eat. Say it's a bit crunchy.
If you want to eat seafood, you can try to go out of the hotel and turn left at the intersection, there are many seafood restaurants, you can refer to the comment network for more reference.
Play: It’s a pity to play. On the day of the typhoon, it rained intermittently and the temperature was not very high. Coupled with the impact of the epidemic, there were not many places to go, including the hotel’s children’s indoor playground, because it was in the It is in the Sheraton next door, so it is not open for the time being, and the Atlantis Water World is basically over 122 in height for children. We have not gone to it again and again. There are still 3 nights, I hope the weather will be better later~
Finally, for this stay experience, 4 out of 5 stars are given to Xiaoma. After all, the rooms and facilities of the hotel are rigid, but the service provided by Xiaoma can really be felt. After so many hotels, the first experience of Marriott under Starwood Group was given to JW Marriott in Sanya! Thank you horse~

Wandering around the hotel is basically changing the scene from step to step, and there are really movies everywhere! Catch up with other people's lawn weddings, seaside weddings, the layout is quite innovative!
The water in the swimming pool is quite clear, and there is basically no smell of disinfectant~
The washbasin area of the room is also quite good. The bathtub is the kind of high-footed bathtub that is very Roman. The hotel's own toiletries are also very good. Although I sent Hermes to wash, I also used the hotel's own. , is not inferior to Hermes at all~
The service of the hotel is particularly in place, especially Lele. I reported that the room has the unique smell of the sea view room that cannot be exposed to the sun. Lele immediately asked my colleague to send a fragrance machine and macarons in the evening. It is also very beautiful, and the fruit platter is also rich in varieties, such as imperial bananas, lotus mist, etc.~

msg:The JW Marriott Hotel in Haitang Bay is not only cost-effective, but the hotel itself is as beautiful as a scenic spot. The unique Spanish style is hard to rival in Sanya, and even the decorations by the pool are traditional European art. There are 9 swimming pools, with its own sandy beach and a large coconut grove net. The 8,000-square-meter large garden is very suitable for children to play. There are also arcades, peacock pavilion, octagonal wishing pond, central ******* scripture pavilion, spiral staircase, etc., all of which are well-made, and I can't walk when I take pictures~
The hotel restaurant is also very good, the breakfast is rich, this time it is just in time for the Halloween theme dinner, and there is a show, which is very interesting!
The hotel has complete facilities. Due to the humid weather in Sanya, it is also specially equipped with a dehumidifier, which is very user-friendly. The room attendants are also very attentive and make welcome arrangements. The room attendant also cleans very carefully and is very enthusiastic. Every time they meet, they take the initiative to say hello 🙋
The hotel also has a free nucleic acid point, which is very convenient. You can do nucleic acid without leaving the hotel. There is also a particularly user-friendly point in the lobby bathroom. Toiletries and hand cream are also provided, which are very delicate, which many hotels cannot do. the~
The hotel service is nothing to say. I received a call from the housekeeper Bonnie before I checked in, asking if there were any special requirements for the room. I prepared the room in advance, and there was no need to wait for the room. I also cared about us many times during the stay, and answered any questions. Very patient~ The service staff of the hotel are all great and enthusiastic ❤️ I really feel at home with my daughter this time on vacation! Because this trip is very rushed, otherwise I will stay for two more days~ I will definitely come back if I have the chance ^_^
The recommendation index is five stars 🌟 Quiet and quiet resort! Friends who want to travel on their honeymoon must not miss it~

The room is large and there is a partition between the bathroom and the bedroom, which makes it relatively private. The entire hotel is well greened and is in a garden. The swimming pool is also quite satisfactory. There are plenty of fruits provided in the room, and mini barre drinks are replenished for free every day. The shortcomings are also quite prominent. First of all, the entire hotel feels a bit understaffed and the lobby is a bit stingy. I called the front desk, but no one answered, probably due to lack of staff. The room had been renovated for a long time and the toilet was broken. The staff came to see it and it took three minutes to pump the water. There was also a huge Double Happiness sticker from the previous tenant in the room. I don’t know why the guest room wasn’t cleaned up. These are nothing, and basically do not cause much harm. But the air conditioning in the breakfast restaurant didn't seem to be on. It was extremely hot while I was having breakfast, and the children kept shouting that it was too hot. The worst thing was that after breakfast, my child and I both started to have stomach upsets. The child had abdominal cramps and diarrhea. We didn’t eat anything else during the meal. It was the Marriott breakfast that caused the problem. This Marriott trip was a bit disappointing.

msg:This is the third time to stay at JW Marriott, the last time I stayed by the pool,
This time I lived on the 4th floor with a sea view, because the last experience was very good
So this time is also looking forward to Marriott's journey,
Let's talk about the service first:
Due to the short trip, the Hilton who stayed in the first two days
Marriott, who stayed in the next two days, took the initiative to contact Lele, the butler of Marriott, before Hilton took a taxi.
I kindly upgraded the room type for us. The service of staying in the whole hotel is very good. The staff will take the initiative to say hello and know that we are a couple. They also made simple arrangements for us.
And also sent fruit and Hermès care travel set
My husband also thinks that the overall service of Marriott is much better
Let's talk about Lele Butler again:
The full service is online, which provides great comfort for my stay in Marriott. It is the icing on the cake. It proactively reminds me of the nucleic acid test time. When I know that I am not feeling well, I take the initiative to deliver room service, hot milk, ginger tea, and warm baby. paste
And on the last day, she also thoughtfully sent us a late check-out, which is really a big compliment for her
There is also Cassie&reece, the people are also very nice and brought us very warm service!

Finally, let's talk about the restaurant and hotel scenery
The breakfast is still relatively rich, the fruit is very fresh, there may be a little less variety, maybe there are fewer people during the epidemic
The scenery is still full, the hotel is very special and suitable for taking pictures, the swimming pool is very clean, we also took a lot of pictures
Then I also made an appoin**ent for the photo team that the hotel cooperated with. Maybe my husband is a professional videographer, so the shooting did not meet our demands. Hahaha, I can only say that I chose some.

In the last season, the waves in Haitang Bay are very large, everyone should not go into the water, pay attention to safety, but there are really no people on the beach, unlike other places where people get together,
Sanhaitang Bay Marriott Hotel is a great hotel. It is only 7-8 minutes away from the duty-free shop. It is really suitable for travel!
If you are still hesitating, come on!

msg:After thousands of choices, I decided to choose the Kouyou international chain hotel to stay in, in order to have a good service team and a comfortable check-in experience.
This was the worst and most expensive accommodation experience I had during my trip to Hainan. When I drove to the hotel, I almost moved the luggage by myself. I felt that the porter was a bit out of shape at the time, and there were only two of the three tables at check-in. It’s open, but there’s no one there, and it’s been a long time waiting in line to check in. The service staff gathered and chatted on their own, and didn’t care much about the guests. A housekeeper added WeChat in advance, and called in advance to inform the hotel that there was a baby staying and needed children’s supplies. ...But the response from the housekeeper was slow, and the children's supplies were not prepared in advance. Even the inflatable toys in the private swimming pool were out of gas, and the waiters were notified to inflate them. The room facilities were not checked in advance, and the air conditioner in the room There is a problem with the panel, which is good and bad. I was surprised that such a big hotel doesn't even have a thermometer. All that aside, it doesn't meet the standards of a five-star hotel at all, no surprises. The equipment is outdated, the staff is free and loose and the management is lax, and the price is seriously inconsistent with the standard of service facilities. Please choose carefully!

msg:This is my first time to Sanya, to accompany my daughter-in-law on her honeymoon. Fortunate to choose JW Marriott Hotel, it can be said that the trip was worthwhile. The hotel is top-notch in terms of facilities and newness. I ate 3 large pieces of sirloin steak in the restaurant, hahaha, it's super delicious. In fact, what amazes me the most is the service of JW Marriott. My housekeeper is called "Lele". Meeting her makes me happy. She takes care of me all the time and answers all my questions at the first time, which makes me very moved. I came for our honeymoon, Lele arranged a room for us with little swans, and prepared fruit and small desserts for us at night. This is the first time I have experienced such a 360-degree service. I am flattered. Can money experience it? So, come to Haitang Bay, if you don't choose JW, who else do you choose? Come on, listen to me right! Remember to look for Lele ha ha ha ha!

msg:Hotel room facilities, but with the so-called five-star hotel, the pool room I stayed in this time, I feel very good, Lele is very powerful. It is close to the seaside, there are many swimming pools with various depths, and it is also very close to the duty-free shop, three to five kilometers. I want to praise the food, it's really good, there are a lot of varieties, and it's a little different every day, there are performances at the buffet dinner. All kinds of services have questions and answers, in short, the price is quite high. 🌱Cost-effective: High 🏠Room facilities: OK 📍Location and traffic: near the duty-free shop It's hard to find, you have to go around half a circle from the door to the right

msg:A family of four generations traveled together. Originally, I booked the wrong double room. Fortunately, when the hotel butler Lele called in advance to confirm the itinerary, I remembered that Lele upgraded to a twin room without a word. grateful
A room with a swimming pool. My son doesn't have to go out and go directly into the water. He has a lot of fun. I go back and forth to the big swimming pool. I am really lazy. After swimming, I go directly to the room to take a bath and change clothes.
It is very close to the sea. The 90-year-old grandpa wants to see the sea, so he will satisfy him this time. Take two steps to the beach to watch the waves.
First seafood meal out. The last three meals were all in the hotel's Chinese restaurant, with more dishes and cooking skills than outside, plus I'm a Marriott member, and the food was discounted. I recommend the Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea dish, which is enough for five people, and the seafood is particularly good.
There are many other considerate services. The housekeeper Lele gave his son dolls, fruits, chocolates, macarons, and free drinks in the minibar. The son was very happy. The elderly are also very relieved.
Great exclusive, thanks to Butler Lele

msg:There is no one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in in Sanya. It is really the ceiling of the Sanya Hotel. I traveled off-peak on November 11. After reading many hotels on the Internet, I finally chose jw Marriott with the mentality of giving it a try. I was really pleasantly surprised. One day, I received a call from the housekeeper Bonnie, asking about the arrival time, and prepared a small surprise for us, which was very considerate. Truly a service ceiling! ! The National Day may be affected by the epidemic. There are not many people, and there is no need to queue for check-in. The lobby is also very quiet. The whole hotel gives me the feeling that I have entered an exotic Spain. You can feel the charm of exotic beauty without going abroad! The hotel has high landscaping coverage and is only a few minutes walk from the sea. The facilities and equipment of the room are also perfect. Sanya is already very humid and has been equipped with a dehumidifier. The room attendant is also very polite and cleans every day, which makes people very comfortable. Besides, the hotel restaurant is only open despite the epidemic There are two restaurants, but I like the buffet dinner of Western food that is temporarily open. The Malayan flavor is full of flavors, sweet and sour, which is in line with my taste! The traffic around the hotel is also very convenient. There is a food court next to the hotel. It is very convenient to eat and shop. It is also relatively close to the duty-free shop. All in all, this trip was really fun. JW Marriott left me with an unforgettable memory. Once again, I feel the care of Bonnie. During the stay, I will always pay attention to our feelings. If there is any epidemic prevention policy, I will share it with me at the first time. When I leave the hotel, I personally send us off. It is really worthy of praise. I will definitely choose jw Marriott next time. Sanya hotel ceiling is undoubtedly!

msg:This is a hotel I wanted to go to many years ago, when she was called The Luxury Collection. Unfortunately, the recognition of the Luxury Collection brand in China is too low. After the hotel was renovated in 2019, it was listed on JW Marriott.
This is a unique hotel on the coastline of Haitang Bay. Compared with Atlantis' 1,314 rooms, JW Marriott has only 160 rooms, a very low density. Along the entire Haitang Bay, whether it is Atlantis, Poly Rosewood, or The Addison, Kaaba Intercontinental, Grand Hyatt, and Westin, they are all tall buildings. There is only JW Marriott, there are only 4 floors in total, and many are single-family villas. If you drive by Haitang North Road, you can only see the trees, but not the houses.
The advantage of this is that the hotel guarantees excellent privacy. The disadvantage is that the view of the sea is relatively general.
Because we came from Atlantis, we have low requirements for sea view view, but hope to have good gardens and swimming pools, so we chose JW Marriott.
The entire JW Marriott Resort is a Spanish colonial style, very beautiful, and the photos are very good. There are many palm trees in the garden, and after several years of growth, they have become very lush. JW Marriott and the Sheraton next door jointly own 22 swimming pools. Guests of JW Marriott can go to Sheraton, but guests of Sheraton cannot come.
The most basic room type of the hotel is also 70 square meters, which is very big. The most important thing is the hotel service. The hotel service is also very good. Eileen called me in advance, which is very considerate. Very warm feeling. I met Manager Wu Hao during the stay and took good care of us. All in all, I will choose this hotel next time🏨

msg:I can’t go abroad after the epidemic. I have stayed in most hotels of the same grade in Haitang Bay. The hotel is really different, but Haitang Bay Marriott is too good for me. I love it, and the hotel has a strong exotic resort style. Let people switch to vacation status as soon as they enter the lobby. The public area is fully air-conditioned, and check in is also one person per table. It's not like the public area of the hotel next to the duty-free shop that I was in the previous two days. It was hot and there were many people in line.
Marriott's service and details are evident from the Hermès suits prepared in the room, the unlimited minibar, the welcome fruit plate, and the attentive care of the housekeeper.
During the sudden outbreak of the epidemic, my housekeeper, Kathy, reminded me of the latest news at any time. She also sent Godiva chocolates and roses on Qixi Festival. She was very thoughtful. Haitang Bay Marriott is the hotel I will choose to stay again when I come to Sanya.
A small suggestion: Can you improve the noodles for breakfast? It’s really average.
Confess that Haitang Bay Marriott is my favorite hotel🏖

msg:This is the third time I have come to Sanya. I have stayed at MGM and Rosewood before. I really like JW compared to the previous two. This time I stayed for 6 days and 5 nights. The environment and service of JW are really good. It is also very appetizing, especially the housekeeper Bonnie, who took care of us this time, really took care of us very well. In the past few days, the child accidentally slipped and ran too fast. The hotel handled it in a very timely manner. I called for the vehicle to and from the hospital to give us all the medical expenses. Although it was not much, I was also very pleased. In addition, the child vomited for several days because of the acclimatization, and the pony often came to care about the child's situation and gave us some advice. In the few days I stayed, I gave free macaron desserts three times. The children liked it very much. There was also a free minibar that happened to be the sparkling water and beer that I liked to drink. At the end of the check-out, I gave the child a souvenir, and the child was very satisfied. In addition, JW can go to Sheraton to play, there is a shuttle bus to pick up and drop off, but all JW customers can go to Sheraton to play various events for free, let's just say absolutely! We have been at the hotel every day for 6 days. Anyway, this experience is one word, great! In addition, there are some small shortcomings, that is, the government maintenance of the beach in Haitang Bay is not enough, there is a lack of beach chairs, and the wind and waves are too strong to go to the sea, but the photos are still very good. The hotel room has a slight musty smell, but the dehumidification opportunity is much better, but the dehumidification sound is a little loud and needs to be turned off in the middle of the night. In addition, it was very shocking that the hotel gave the Earl. I said 5 free photos. In the end, I only chose 5 photos without paying for the photos and the package. The staff who chose the photos slapped their faces and showed them to me. It was very unpleasant, so everyone should stop taking them. There are many photographers on the beach who shoot hundreds of pictures for 200 yuan. Everyone depends on their needs. If they take good pictures, it is also cost-effective.

Very good hotel, the location is also very good, very close to the duty-free shop, the hotel front desk can also be about 5% off, very good. There are many swimming pools in the hotel, which are very large, and there are plenty of swimming pools to play. The hotel is definitely a very good hotel, highly recommended. On the whole, it was a good stay experience, and I will come again. I accidentally found a treasure hotel, Spanish manor style, the hotel design is really Spanish manor style, so beautiful, many details are exquisite. It is connected to Sheraton, a subsidiary of Marriott, so some public areas such as gyms are shared on both sides. There are not many rooms, and the service really has nothing to say
I would like to commend Cassie, the front desk manager again, for being warm and patient before check-in, and the check-in process is also very pleasant. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic, the room is very large, and the check-in experience is very nice, praise!

The only downside is that the management is a bit chaotic. Maybe the summer vacation is the peak of the holiday season. It is obvious that the restaurant and room service staff have not been properly trained before taking up their jobs. Having dinner at the hotel, after two dishes were served, the bread before the meal was not served, so I urged the waiter to tell it that it was still freshly baked🤪. Professional aspects need to be improved, after all, it is an old five-star hotel, and the price is also medium and high.
I would like to express my special thanks to the housekeeper, Michael, for sending messages after 11 o'clock in the evening. He also prepared hotel special gifts for the children very intimately, and the next day when a friend found something left in the room, he could help find it and send it back in time.
I hope that the overall quality and ability of the hotel's staff can be the same as Michael's, so even if there is a small episode, the guests will still be grateful.

Walking to the JW Marriott lobby makes people feel relaxed and happy. The scenery of the hotel and the design of the lobby are exquisite.
The architecture of the hotel is a bit Spanish. I personally like this style of architecture, especially at the seaside. Opening the door is not a depressing corridor, but the sea breeze and open scenery, which is particularly transparent and comfortable.
The chocolate that Lele gave was delicious. Lele's service is super considerate and has been following up [happy]
Pingchao loves the big outdoor swimming pool. There are not many people and the water quality is very good. Some people clean the pool in the morning and evening. There is a canopy to block the sun, so you don't have to worry about sunburn. The shape of the swimming pool is beautiful, like swimming in a tropical rain forest.
The hotel's catering is also good, especially the tiramisu, which is made in Italian style. The drinks in the mini bar have always been replenished, and drinks and snacks are readily available.
Looking forward to the next trip⛅️

msg:This is the first time I chose jw Marriott in Sanya, but I was also a loyal member of Marriott. I had a good experience living in the edition before. This time I brought my mother and sister, and I felt that the manor style was more in line with their preferences, and the overall satisfaction was very high.

Environment: The green plants are very beautifully maintained, very Spanish style

Service: The service of Jessica and Lele is very considerate and their attitude is very good. In fact, I was a little depressed at the beach maintenance in Sanya Bay before, but thank you for the thoughtful service of the lady at the front desk to clear up our previous haze. I am very satisfied with this trip.

Hygiene: The room is very clean, my mother said it is the most satisfactory hotel she has ever stayed in hahaha

During my stay, it was my family's birthday. The hotel also prepared small cakes and warm decorations. The room service was convenient, timely and thoughtful. The hotel's breakfast was rich enough. On the day of check-out, I negotiated with the front desk. The very nice Miss Lele also helped me. I did a late check-out, if the five-star praise is the highest, I would give this hotel 4.99 points, because I am afraid that they will stop the process of improvement and progress because of complacency 😂😂

msg:JW Marriott in Haitang Bay must be among the hotels in Haitang Bay with the best value for money and the best quality. I don&#39;t think it is one of them. First of all, the location of the hotel is very advantageous. The central location of Haitang Bay is very close to the duty-free shop and Haitang 68 Food City. It is only a 40-minute drive from Phoenix Airport and 20 minutes from the must-go Wuzhizhou Island. It&#39;s convenient! Then there is the environment of the hotel, the western style of the southern European manor style Spanish manor design, the lush tropical gardens, all kinds of flowers and plants are blooming, and the fashionable a**osphere has a high rate of production. The hotel&#39;s wishing octagonal pool, arched corridor, and intarsia floor can take very good-looking photos, and young friends will like it. Regarding hotel facilities, Chinese food, western food and seaside buffet, as well as a noodle restaurant, have everything to choose from. The children&#39;s playground is big enough, and there is an interactive clown game every morning, which the children like very much. There is a zoo outside where you can get close to nature, feed small animals, and the small trains around the two hotels are open all day long. There are CS field battles for children on the beach. All kinds of guest utensils in the room are very practical and have a good texture. The sanitation of the hotel is also very good, the cleaning is very meticulous, the items are well organized, the aunts are very simple, and the consumption I put on the table will be confiscated. Haha, the service of the hotel is definitely the highlight of this hotel. Champagne, this time I came to Sanya to stay at Atlantis, LaCrosse and Yanlord Crown, and they did not have such a special check-in experience. The lobby is small and exquisite, you can sit and drink while checking in. It is very delicate and petty, very There is style, but the lobby is too hot haha, improve the air conditioning. We were received by Miss Kira, a very enthusiastic little girl. Cassie was arranged to serve us during the break, and the same high-quality service was provided. The staff of the hotel are more enthusiastic. They let the concierge deliver things over and over again. They are efficient and have a good attitude. Thank you and give you a thumbs up. When I left the hotel, I had a very happy chat with the hotel director Mao. I felt that their overall quality was very good, professional and enthusiastic, which made people feel very comfortable. In the end, it is cost-effective, more than 1,500 fruit snacks including breakfast, Hermes art box, free minibar, it is really worth living, I personally feel that this is an obviously underrated resort hotel haha, so everyone hurry up Let&#39;s go treasure hunting!

msg:The book bar in the lobby of the Spanish Castle Hotel, the artworks placed in the corridor, the courtyard, the rainforest... The quiet environment is very different from the noisy Atlantis nearby, literary and romantic, retro and quiet. It is the hotel with the best privacy in this trip to Sanya. Nicole, the housekeeper, contacted us the day before check-in, and according to our requirements, we were upgraded two levels to stay in the king-bed room with a swimming pool on the first floor. Due to the long wait time for check-in, a small dessert was also presented. Welcome fruits and drinks in the minibar are also very rich, and the staff will greet you politely in the corridor and lobby. It is said that it was caused by the courtyard swimming pool on the first floor) The next day's buffet breakfast found that there were flies surrounding the dishes, and these two aspects were deducted. I hope the hotel can improve. What I must praise is the Bojue travel photography service provided by the hotel. Almost all hotels in Sanya offer travel photography, but the quality of Bojue is better than the Atlantis, Haitang Bay Westin, etc. I stayed in before. Many high-quality hotels are a lot higher. The photographer Zhu Jing, who shot me, didn’t take photos casually because it was a travel photo given by the hotel. He has been communicating with me, and the light is different according to personal characteristics and angles. The scene is very patient to guide the POST, so that an ordinary old aunt of me also has a star blockbuster. You can give a 50-star praise here, and I really didn't miss this holiday, this summer!

msg:The JW Marriott Resort Hotel Haitang Bay is full of exotic style. Driving straight into the hotel from the green avenue, it feels like being in a European castle manor in the movie. After entering the lobby, the familiar smell comes again, and it is still the familiar smell of luxury brands. This is the warmest and most exotic place I have stayed in among so many five-star hotels in Sanya. With the colorful sunshine flickering in the air and the library full of cultural taste, this exotic hotel has a layer of mystery.
My favorite hotel recently is the pool room. The living room and bedroom can directly access the outdoor swimming pool. The private space is perfect for couples to vacation. The hotel room has a clear overall layout, with an independent cloakroom, a super large bathtub, an area of ​​70 square meters, and a large balcony. No matter where you are, you seem to be in a painting.
The octagonal wishing pool in front of the hotel is said to be very effective in making wishes. The spiral staircase is where blockbuster movies are shot. It is said that it is also the same check-in hotel for the celebrity Zhao Jiwei's wedding. Further down is the private garden and the public swimming pool. As long as you use some ideas, you can easily take a fashion photo. It is not an exaggeration to say that you are on vacation abroad in Europe. The waiter Kira introduced that this place was the filming location of the TV series Starry Sea before, which is absolutely worth it.
Full-time JW kitchen, Western food products are very exquisite, the environment is very good, mainly Spanish and Italian food, Wellington
steak, Tomahawk, Hainan chicken rice, a variety of varieties and many choices of tastes.
Check-in in the small space in front, check-in and specially prepared welcome drinks, is one of the few hotels in Sanya that check-in by sitting. We were received by the front desk manager Cassie, and the service was also superb, mainly because their service smiles so many services are in place, which shows that Marriott's training is in place.
The room also has welcome fruits and high-end Hermes toiletries and turndown service, all of which highlight the luxury of the hotel. In short, it is a hotel you don't want to leave when you come. I strongly recommend everyone to stay. JW Marriott is worth it.

msg:#OverallSatisfaction#High cost performance#Clean and hygienic🌴 I have lived in Yalong Bay before, this time I want to change to experience Haitang Bay. There are too many choices of coastal hotels in each bay, and this time it was also tangled for a long time! Later, I found an iron rule for choosing a hotel. I don&#39;t know which one to choose, so I chose the newly renovated one! 🕵🏻‍♂️Choose: Hotels in Haitang Bay are relatively old-fashioned. In contrast, the 🌟Marriott Resort Hotel, which was renovated in 2019, stands out~ In early June, the price of more than 11,000 booked a garden view king-size room, check When in, 🆙Upgrade the room type to the deluxe sea view room, the price/performance ratio is unparalleled🥰Experience: After staying for 1 night, the overall environment of the hotel will not feel outdated because of the renovation, and the grass and green plants in the public areas are maintained. It&#39;s in place, very good. Compared with hotels with higher unit price, Marriott&#39;s buffets are rich in variety, and the outdoor swimming pool is also very good. I still think Marriott&#39;s cost-effectiveness is too high ❤️ Welfare tip You can register as a Marriott member (free of charge) ), there are drinks in the lobby after check-in. The lady who listened to the check-in said that they were all prepared by themselves. No matter in terms of appearance or taste, they were all very good, and they tasted cold.... The minibar in the room is also free. , their minibar is not limited to Coke Sprite, as well as forgetting hawthorn, rio and vitality forest, these are too much for me who likes to drink, because the overall weather in Sanya is relatively humid, the hotel room is also specially equipped with a dehumidifier , is also awesome, very good relief from damp and musty smells. In addition, the services of Cassie and Kira at the front desk are also super caring. Next time you come to Sanya, you don&#39;t have to worry about who to choose. Just come to JW Marriott for this service and equipment.

msg:Sanya cost-effective hotel check-in to send Hermes wash set box
My favorite in Sanya for a few days is this JW Marriott Hotel Haitang Bay. I stayed for two nights and felt that it was the best hotel for the price~ and it was not particularly popular on Xiaohongshu, but I found it hahaha. good. We booked a deluxe sea view room. When we checked in, the Marriott Gold Card could upgrade the room type, but the upgrade still didn't get the pool room I wanted, so I added $ to stay in the pool room~
The whole hotel is Southeast Asian style, with a lot of green plants. From the lobby to the room, it gives people a French retro feel, which is what I like~ The room is also very large with its own swimming pool, cloakroom, bathtub and so on. When I checked in, I also gave a Hermes wash set, which is very delicate~ The guest supervisor Lele has a very considerate and thoughtful service. The hotel is very good as a whole. It is highly recommended.
The hotel also has its own beach and coconut grove, so you don't have to go to other beaches. It's really convenient, and it's nice to take pictures. The location of the hotel is also very good in Haitang Bay, which is very close to the duty-free shop and other major Internet celebrity hotels. The front desk of the hotel has an airport pick-up service and a duty-free store pick-up service if you make an appoin**ent in advance, but you have to make an appoin**ent one day in advance. We didn't catch up once, and the appoin**ent was too late. Hotel facilities and services are very good, praise! 70m² of space is spacious and comfortable, with great lighting
2m king size bed | 1 soft and comfortable, lying on the bed also see the sea
Double washbasin layout, easy to use, a must-have for this grade
The bathtub is large and European-style independent, so it is very comfortable to soak in
The Chinese restaurant of the hotel is shared with Sheraton, both of which are Caiyuexuan Chinese restaurant, which specializes in Qiong Cantonese cuisine, and the taste is quite suitable for my taste.
Don't miss the afternoon tea in the lobby bar, blow the sea breeze, soak up the sun, drink some afternoon tea and eat some snacks, very leisurely
JW all day restaurant, I like it so much. From the garden breakfast in the morning, to a variety of exquisite Spanish delicacies for lunch, and the DIY barbecue made by the chef on the spot at the last dinner, it is beautiful and delicious!
As one of the top luxury brands under the Marriott Group, JW Marriott makes customers feel very happy from the hardware to the service level. Maybe this is not the most advanced configuration, but the a**osphere of the vacation is very good, and it is very good.
This trip to Sanya, this hotel is the best experience for me. I feel that I have not made a mistake. Compared with the popular Internet celebrity hotels on Xiaohongshu, I will go to Sanya.

FOOD
"JW Kitchen" looks at the sea view and eat breakfast every day is the motivation for me to get up early. The seafood is super rich, and the small hot pot in the evening cannot be missed.
There are not many hotels in "Wushan" with Korean food restaurants with sea views. They are delicious but a little expensive, and they look good when photographed.

msg:As a hotel controller, Sanya Resort selected the JW Marriott Hotel in Haitang Bay after several comparisons. The reserved sea view room was arranged on the fourth floor. The room size was quite large at 75 square meters, and free drinks from the minibar were also abundant. , the hotel's facilities are not bad, the second day of stay, I also did a bathtub disinfection and bath to relax, and prepared Hermes toiletries for us. The front desk service is very good, the hotel room and restaurant are very close to the beach, and the breakfast is very rich Yes, there are also Hong Kong-style dim sum available. The waitress at the restaurant enthusiastically introduced the dishes produced by the special chef on the weekend. It is particularly worth mentioning that the supervisor Lele Eileen has been very considerate and praised) from the beginning to follow up our stay experience.

Because there were not many rooms in the room, Lele at the front desk took the initiative to help us upgrade the room type, and the service attitude was also very good when checking in. After check-in, fruits and snacks were provided, which made us feel at home!
The overall style of the hotel is beautiful, the aroma of the elevator is still fresh in my memory, the rooms are large and spacious, the bathtub is great, and the hotel's breakfast is also very good!

The room is big and comfortable to live in 😄
Although the decoration is a little old, the overall style is still very good, low-key and big 👍 The room is big enough 👍
The most important thing to say is that the housekeeper is super caring and the whole service is very good! Prepare all related items in advance, and also give away desserts and fruits for children. Because of the hot weather, we will also give you a big coconut🥥
The hotel staff are also great! So recommended, next time will choose to stay!

The balcony overlooks the entire campus landscape and coastline. The Danube-like swimming pool makes parent-child time more exciting. The sumptuous breakfast with both Chinese and Western food will make you sure to enjoy it. Special thanks to Bonnie, the lady at the front desk, for her warm, patient and meticulous service, which really made me feel at home. Next time I go to Haitang Bay, I will choose JW Marriott again without hesitation.

The breakfast is also very good, very rich and very delicious. There is no large swimming pool outside, and you can go directly to the beach.

However, there are also some small complaints. The beach outside the hotel is indeed a private beach, but the sea is very turbulent, and the beach is not very playable. Of course, it may also be related to the season. The floor of the hotel is not very high, the highest is the fourth floor, if the ultimate pursuit of the ultra-distance sea view, it is recommended to be cautious.
In addition, during my stay, I had trouble with the service staff several times. The front desk phone responded quickly, but it seems that the actual service operation speed is slow.

After checking in, it did not disappoint me, and I stayed too long to leave. Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely stay here #health
The hygiene of the room is very good. I will come to clean it every morning, replenish the minibar, and turn the night down at night. #Serve
The service was so good that I was embarrassed, especially Eileen Lele and Kira, the manager, who simply served with a smile and responded to every request. #location traffic
The hotel is in Haitang Bay, surrounded by high-end hotels, which is very suitable for vacation. However, Haitang Bay is a little far from the city and other attractions. If you want to visit the attractions, it is not recommended to live here. #breakfast
The breakfast is very rich and very delicious, and it is very satisfying to eat every morning. In addition, Lele at the front desk is very attentive!

msg:This is an impromptu trip. It happens that 520 is also the anniversary of the receipt of the certificate, so let's just leave. In order to satisfy the children who have been away from the island for a long time, I chose to travel by motor vehicle for the first time from Haikou to Sanya. After arriving at Sanya Station, it takes 40 minutes to take a taxi to Haitang Bay. It may not be the prime time when we arrived in the hotel lobby with only our family of three. It was the fastest check-in time in the hotel for so many times. I originally booked a parent-child room, but I accidentally discovered that the first floor of the hotel has an independent pool room. The front desk was very nice and helped us change the pool room on the first floor. The first impression when I push the door in is that the room is very big. The children are very happy to see the open-air swimming pool after the electric curtains are raised. During the three-day and two-night trip, she almost soaked in the swimming pool.
The housekeeper bonnie was great and took the initiative to add vx. He asked us all kinds of needs intimately, and received welcome fruits and Hermes bath products. The most interesting thing about this room is that our room is super invincible from the western restaurant. The children like the restaurant's pre-dinner bread very much. It is really heroic to give two big breads, and the balsamic vinegar is delicious? The mango and avocado pizza I ate for two days in a row proved to be really good. The service staff at breakfast every day are very attentive and friendly, which makes people feel comfortable. The daughter also went to tell the person in charge that she likes western restaurants very much. Expressing her preferences so that the other party can also feel your happiness is a small method I told her recently to increase the happiness index. I used it properly in this trip. As a result, the restaurant staff liked her very much, and gave her macarons during dinner. In short, it was a very good vacation, and I will choose jw next time and look forward to the next meeting.

Their rooms are also very exquisitely decorated. My favorite room style I have ever stayed in Sanya! Then I would like to thank Bonnie, the guest relations director of the hotel, for her meticulous care. She is really a 24-hour housekeeper, and she responds to any requests. As soon as she arrives at the front desk, she expresses a warm welcome. She also arranges a great airport pick-up service for my wife. After the upgrade, the room arrangement is also very good, and the sanitation is also very clean. I am really satisfied with my stay in the past two days! Will definitely come again next time and recommend it to my friends and family 😊

The layout of the room is really good. The cloakroom and bathroom are very big. You can see the sea view. The room manager Helen also made a welcome arrangement for us.
Marriott's service is still very good. The one-to-one butler is basically responsive. There are not many people in the off-season hotel, and the large swimming pool and beach are all exclusive enjoyment. The hotel design is in Spanish style, very low-key but very particular. This time I feel very good. If you don't have children, you don't need parent-child programs. In fact, Marriott is more suitable for vacation.

msg:My favorite hotel in Sanya for a few days is the iw Marriott Hotel Haitang Bay. I stayed for two nights and felt that it was the best hotel for the price~ and it was not particularly popular on Xiaohongshu, but I found it hahahaha good. We stayed in the pool room~, Lele Eileen and manager Cassie at the front desk are very attentive and attentive, and the hotel is very a**ospheric

The whole hotel is Southeast Asian style, with a lot of green plants. From the lobby to the room, it gives people a French retro feel, which is what I like~ The room is also very large with its own swimming pool, cloakroom, bathtub and so on. When I checked in, I also gave a Hermes wash set, which is very delicate~

The hotel also has its own beach and coconut grove, so you don't have to go to other beaches. It's really convenient, and it's nice to take pictures. The location of the hotel is also very good in Haitang Bay, which is very close to the duty-free shop and other major Internet celebrity hotels. The front desk of the hotel has an airport pick-up service and a duty-free store pick-up service if you make an appoin**ent in advance, but you have to make an appoin**ent one day in advance. We didn't catch up once, and the appoin**ent was too late.
This trip to Sanya, this hotel is the best experience I have, and I feel that I have not made a mistake. Compared with the popular Internet celebrity hotels on Xiaohongshu, those who go to Sanya can try this hotel.

msg:Let me first say that this hotel will never stay again, and I advise everyone to choose carefully. The service is poor, the supporting facilities are poor, and everything is 800 times worse than last year. Now I regret choosing this hotel.

Last year, I also came to Sanya during the May 1st holiday. I stayed at JW for two nights with my best friend. At that time, I stayed in several hotels, including Rosewood next door. In comparison, I felt that the service of JW was really good. For hotels in the segment, jw is the best overall and the most cost-effective. The young lady Amber who served at that time and a few others really fried chicken nice, so we specially wrote a small essay for them on the reservation website. (Picture 1)

This time I came to Sanya for vacation with my boyfriend and chose this hotel to stay again without hesitation. The result was really a "surprise".

The first is check-in, we booked the "Deluxe Pool Suite", but when we checked in, we were given a "Deluxe Pool Room", and then as soon as we walked in, I couldn't describe the smell wafting from the house, in short, it was like a room It feels like no one has lived in it for 3 years, and the musty smell that comes out cannot be dissipated for a long time after ventilation for half an hour. As soon as I entered the room for 3 minutes, I called the front desk and complained about the wrong room and the musty smell in the room that could not be accommodated. Half an hour later, I was upgraded to a one-bedroom pool villa. Do you think the matter is over? No, the bloody ones are behind.

After upgrading the villa, I went in to check the facilities of the house and found that a large pool of water stains was not cleaned at the connection between the living room and the living room outside. (As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3) The more exciting thing came later. My boyfriend and I were playing with water by the pool. The cleaning staff were male, and they came in and dragged the pool of water directly. When I knocked on the door, I clearly said to wait a moment. Before I even went to the door to open the door, he swiped his card and came in. What if he didn't wear clothes? Is this the service awareness of the service staffing of a five-star hotel? Do you have a doorbell that won't ring the doorbell? The customer responded to wait a moment, can't we wait for us to come and open the door ourselves? The villa pool room has been upgraded, but there is no housekeeper to introduce various service facilities?
I said you can't afford to upgrade, why don't we just not upgrade? I don't mind if you give me my original suite.

Then I went to have breakfast the next morning. The whole restaurant felt like the management was chaotic. I took a seat and ordered two cups of coffee when I walked in. The instructions were clear. When I placed the second order, it was delivered after about 10 minutes. .

Back to the room, I asked if there was floating afternoon tea, and then told me to make an appoin**ent one day in advance. When staying in a villa, your housekeeper does not need to give a basic introduction to the existing situation and services? Then I said that I didn't need to make an appoin**ent so long in advance when I came last year, and you didn't tell me the specific appoin**ent requirements and meal restrictions when I checked in. If I can't make an appoin**ent, I have to complain, and then suddenly I can make an appoin**ent for the floating afternoon tea on the same day? Take people for fools? Or do you just pick soft persimmons? The guests don't give feedback, and you just go in the dark like this? Staying so many jw this is really the worst experience! [sweat][sweat][sweat]

Although the hotel is not new, the room is very clean, and the Hermes gift is a bonus. The breakfast is also very good. The check-in is received by Cassie, who is very enthusiastic. He always responds to my WeChat messages as soon as possible. All problems are solved in a timely manner. Although there are very few people in the hotel, the service is really super. The restaurant can call the hotel's battery car at any time for pick-up. When I left the restaurant, I forgot something in the hotel. Cassie also helped me find it in time and mailed it to me. There are too many unforgettable memories. . . So, JW Marriott, you can always believe!

All the service staff were very friendly during the whole process from before check-in to check-out. Special thanks to the housekeeper Kira and the duty manager Amber, who helped us arrange the honeymoon room. If there was a problem during the stay, they helped us to change the room in time. They also helped us check out late, which gave us a good check-in experience.

ps: The swimming pool of the villa is very good, big and clean. It will be cleaned every day. If you live in this room type, you basically don’t need to go out. It’s very refreshing to soak in the room and watch TV and swim every day. But be sure to close the windows and doors when you go swimming, don't keep them open, if the doors and windows are left untouched, there may be scary little animals crawling in, we met once 😂😂

The customer service Lele took the initiative to contact the day before check-in, asked the requirements and arrival time very intimately, and arranged the room in advance. Since I was on a honeymoon with my wife, Lele took the initiative to help arrange the room and upgrade the room. The location of the room is also in the C position of the hotel. Naturally, it is not necessary to mention the hardware facilities. It is very good. What we did not expect is the hotel's The caring service of the staff is courteous and responsive, and every little detail is very thoughtful. On the day of check-in, a welcome fruit and a Hermes set gift box were also presented, and the daily ice bar was completely free. The customer service Lele also gave extra sweet snacks. Perfect experience, will stay in Sanya in the future. Very satisfied!

msg:Kind tips:

1. The damp smell in the room when you enter is very uncomfortable, the decoration is old, and the floor drain smells like odor and urine, which is so disgusting that it cannot be expressed in words. There are unidentified hairs of adults on the sheets, haha, it feels like staying in a cheap resort...
2. Although breakfast in Sanya is expensive and unpalatable, believe me, the breakfast in this hotel will refresh your imagination. As if you didn’t spend any money to come in and dine for free, the steaming point in the central kitchen in the back kitchen area will be deliberately not available. If you ask, it will not be available. Thumbs up for this spirit of helping the hotel save material costs👍
3. The room facilities feel like they are about to be replaced at any time. The bathroom is from Kohler, and the Hermès gift is useless. It smells of low-quality fragrance and is very cheap. I asked the front desk that the customer service number is 24 hours a day, but these days You can never get through to customer service, no one will answer,

Before checking in, I read the reviews and found out that it used to be a Luxury Collection hotel, so I changed my name to JW. I was prepared for it, but the gap with other JW hotels is really too big. Regardless of the software and hardware supporting services, this hotel can only be rated three stars. , as far as the resort level is concerned, I will not come back again in the future.

This hotel is much better than expected, definitely super five-star. The room layout is very simple and beautiful in American style. The small swimming pool is also very good. The room is warm and comfortable. It is worth mentioning that the fried chicken for breakfast is delicious. It is the best I have eaten in a five-star hotel so far. The design is very reasonable. , The breakfast is very close to the room; the whole hotel is designed in a garden, which is very suitable for vacation. It only takes five minutes to walk to the beach, there are few people and the sand is fine. In short, I will stay again next time! Bring your parents!

First of all, I received a 5-star praise from Miss Lele, the housekeeper, for her thoughtful service. I met GREADA, a waiter at a western restaurant, which was also a good service attitude and patience. 5 stars, very excellent Quality service. The food made by the chef of the restaurant is also delicious! The hotel environment is also very good, all aspects have reached the 5-star standard. Value for money, unlike the 2-star standard pit people who hang 5 stars on the intercontinental peninsula. It's OK to stay at JW Marriott next time! The manager of Brant at Yatui Restaurant also gave a good review. The buffet and performance experience were very pleasant! Kids love it 😊

After looking around for a hotel, I finally thought that if I booked a swimming pool in JW, the children could play in the water, and finally found that the water was too cold to go in! !
When I arrived at the hotel, it was already past 4:00 pm, and I was told that the room was not tidied up, and I waited for more than an hour... I was a little angry at this point, so I checked in at 3 o'clock... The last time it was finished after 5 o'clock... Fortunately, the room was big enough and clean , enough to keep the kids running around! ! Recommend this room type! ! Very spacious!
The children's entertainment room is in the Sheraton next door, and it's not too far to walk there. There is a bubble swimming pool on 3/4 every afternoon, with constant temperature... Children can play in the water~ There is also a small train, and jw hotel guests are free... There is also a playground! !

But it doesn't matter if you walk around the beach, you can go to the beach and the beach is very clean. There are nine swimming pools in the park. It is suitable for children because of the strong wind, but they didn't swim in the water, but it looks very clean. Someone has been taking care of them. The two big and two small are actually very affordable, and the breakfast is actually very good. After eating for a few days, the dishes have changed somewhat.
😍Lele😍 If you have contact information, you can consult and answer all questions inside and outside the hotel in detail. The service is very good
Overall, the hotel's comfort, convenience, service value, and price/performance ratio are quite high.

Cassie's caring service can give full marks to this stay experience. Thanks again Cassie, I will look for her next time I come back.

msg:If you want to live in Haitang Bay, JW Marriott will be the best choice, no matter from the perspective of cost performance, service attitude, hardware installation, and environmental equipment. Before check-in, someone from the reservation depar**ent called to ask about needs or preferences. When checking in, the sister Lele at the front desk was very hands-on and would answer any questions. At the same time, I also upgraded my house. Beach, sunshine, and coconut trees seem to be standard features of Sanya hotels. It is really convenient to get to the duty-free shop in three minutes by taxi. Compared with the Edition in the same location, the so-called Internet celebrities Atlanta, Rosewood, etc., the price-performance ratio is absolutely full. Thanks again to all the staff~ I hope to see you next time!

msg:The JW Marriott in Haitang Bay has a sense of vacation. The architecture is beautiful. It is very suitable for fear of the exotic beauty of the photo/corridor ring under the light and shadow. The floor tiles are beige, green, and brick red, just like the trance of Florence Cathedral. The rooms are also great and the decoration is new, the white is very fresh but full of texture. The cloakroom is spacious, the writing room is specially designed, the bedding is excellent, and the minibar is complete. Welcome fruit rich. The bathroom is equipped with double sinks, the bathtub is extremely beautiful, and the shape is classic and light. The breakfast is very highly recommended, rich and delicious and exquisitely presented. It is very good and hygienic to require guests to wear masks to take meals. The tables and chairs for breakfast are also very beautiful. The light of the morning comes in, and I enjoy a quiet breakfast. Amber at the restaurant is very attentive and enthusiastic, and Nancy at the front desk is also very professional. When checking out, he helped us to the door. The care was very thoughtful and made people feel very comfortable.

This is not the point, the point is service, breakfast, lawn buffet dinner are all very good, the experience is very good! I would like to praise Miss Kathy, the manager on duty at the front desk, she is very caring ~ help to call a car or something, the service experience is perfect! As for the damp smell in the villa, I don’t think it is too heavy, at least it won’t be choked.

🔔Service: Miss Kira at the front desk has very good service and is very caring. When I went to the duty-free shop, I lost my glasses on the bus. I was surprised to find them for me. When I checked out on the third day, I took the initiative to ask for help with late check-out.

msg:After seeing many hotels, I finally chose the JW Marriott Hotel in Haitang Bay. The overall service is very considerate. [Hug][Hug] The experience is very good. You can feel Southeast Asia without going out. The Haitang Bay Marriott Hotel is hidden in dense forests. In this garden, the sea breeze is blowing by the swimming pool at night. The privacy is very good. It is built with its own beach facing the sea, facing the sea, sweating, getting full of vitality, the sea and the sky, watching the sunrise and sunset, quietly I want to live a slow life, the beautiful lady Li Tingting at the front desk is still a fellow in the Northeast, she patiently answers every time she encounters a problem, she is beautiful and kind, adds WeChat, answers all questions, and the service gives 100 stars 🌟🌟 praise, next time I would choose here to eat buffet in the evening.

service:
Customers should have the rights (baggage must be booked one day in advance, airport transfers must be booked one day in advance, travel shots must be booked one day in advance, duty-free shops must be booked one day in advance). Lost the standard of luxury

health
There is a musty smell when entering the room. After changing the room, the sofa has the following stains, and there is a problem with the hotel management

The scenic spot is shared with Sheraton, so so, not very amazing
Without the magnificence of the Venetian Hotel in Macau, the service enthusiasm is poor. In terms of Luxury level and hotel prices, it does not match at all.

Breakfast offers Cantonese-style morning tea snacks and 2 whole coconuts are provided for free at dinner, and the dinner is very delicious , The amount is also very good, two people can not finish eating, and the young lady also provides the service of making packed airplane meals, which feels too nice.

It takes about 45 minutes to come after 4 or 5 phone calls. There was no signal all morning. The air-conditioning in the room can't work. Although I agree to change the room, I don't want to toss it because it's time for the child to go to bed. And the air vents of the air conditioners are terribly dirty. There is a negative 5 star standard!

msg:Looking at the introduction, it was a newly opened hotel in 2019. I didn’t expect to find that the facilities were so old when I arrived. Later I found out that it was the original Sheraton.
I booked it a month in advance, but I didn’t expect Marriott to adjust the price a week before departure.
When I checked in, the front desk said that the last suite was on the second floor and it was really far from the lobby. The location of the hotel is average. Only some rooms on the fourth floor can see the sea
When I arrived in the room, there was a strong musty smell. Although two air purifiers were installed, it could not cover up the musty smell in the room. The waiter on the phone came and sprayed a whole can of air freshener, which was a little better.
The room looks renovated, the walls are clean, but the floor and skirting are quite dirty
The advantages and disadvantages of the hotel are quite obvious
advantage 
Dining is a highlight, no matter the service or taste, I am very satisfied. Recommended for group purchase of western food for dinner
The swimming pool is also great. There are several large and small swimming pools and there are not many people.
shortcoming
The guest room was not cleaned after renovation, and the dressing room was full of dust from renovation and the clothes were dirty
The hotel is not careful enough about the safety of the internal environment. A snake sprang out on the road, which is really scary.
The minibar is not refilled after the hotel cleans the room

The facilities of this hotel are really too old, it is not recommended for those who want to see the sea in Sanya

Although the room is upgraded for free, it is still a double bed! Every day I go out to play and return to the hotel and find that our door is open. This is too rigorous. What should I do if any valuables are lost? I'm speechless! ! Afternoon tea, the front desk and restaurant staff have different opinions. One said that you don’t need to make an appoin**ent to eat directly, and the other said that you need to make an appoin**ent before you can eat. Hey, whoever is the one... There are very few service staff in the hotel, ask I can’t find anyone for any problem, price and service are not on the same level...not a very pleasant experience

msg:1. Advantages: The little brothers in the concierge depar**ent are enthusiastic and active, making people feel good when they just get off the car, but the next thing is speechless;
2. After arriving at the store, I was told at the front desk that I was lucky. The guest checked out early and was already cleaning and needs to wait for the cleaning. Also, Ctrip told us that we are on our honeymoon and the honeymoon room needs to be furnished, so it may take a bit longer, so far. I was very happy, and thought the hotel was very careful, so we went to the hotel to dine;
3. When I arrived at the all-day western restaurant, I told us that I could sit anywhere. I saw the empty seat next to the bed and was called by the restaurant service staff. Only cutlery and plates) asked me to change to the place where the cutlery has been placed, at the next table... Obviously, I can help to move the cutlery over, why do I need to choose a position and take me to the place directly;
4. As soon as I sat down and prepared to have a meal, I lowered my head, there were stains on the dinner plate and it was not clean, and it fell off when I picked it up with my hands, but I changed the dinner plate immediately after notification;
5. Eat a good meal, wait and wait for the phone, even waited for the call of Capella, who was staying in the day after tomorrow, and asked me carefully for the details. After answering the phone, I called the front desk to ask when the room would be ready. It turned out that I was allowed to move in, and I forgot to tell it. It was clearly said that when we checked in, let us go shopping first, and let us know immediately;
I arrived at the store more than 6.12 o’clock and gave the luggage tag to the front desk when I checked in. I didn’t deliver my luggage to the room for an hour after I checked in, and the phone was turned off without power. I kept calling and said that I would deliver it later. After calling three times, I said that I was lost. I didn’t know which one was, and I didn’t apologize. I said there were more than eleven people. When did more than eleven people become a reason for forgiveness? Many guests still stay at a premium on November, shouldn't the service be kept up?
7. When I arrived at the room, I found that the honeymoon room was not well arranged. I don’t know what I waited for so long... Actually, it is not necessary to arrange it, but it is because you actively said that you want to arrange it, but there is nothing. Ask the service staff of the dedicated line. I don’t think so, no explanation, no apology, no reason;
8. The bathtub was not cleaned the first time I checked in, and I didn't understand what was being cleaned after waiting so long? Dirty that is visible to the naked eye is not not cleaned, but not cleaned at all;
9. The electric mosquito coil has bottomed out and has not been replaced;
10. The response of the dedicated line is very slow, and the feedback is special... There is no feedback, it feels like ai, and it is extremely awkward to speak. It feels like you are embarrassed by the other side, and can't solve it.
11. The welcome fruits and the washes in the package were not delivered (but the receptionist was informed in advance that it would be late, so there was no reminder at the beginning, but it was very late, and the washes always said that they would be delivered later, and then they were told at five o'clock. I always arrive at the turndown, so why didn’t I tell at the beginning? If I tell, I won’t ask again...Why didn’t I give the guests a clear explanation? So many opportunities to make it clear;
12. Hotel staff do not greet guests when they meet, except for the concierge depar**ent (the little brothers in the concierge depar**ent are very good, and they will greet them very warmly even when they go out at night);
13. The above problems were not resolved from 12 o'clock to 5 o'clock in the afternoon, so I called the manager. The manager didn't pay much attention to the above. The apology didn't make people feel very sincere from beginning to end... and we met in the lobby later. I didn’t say hello, and talked about the mosquito repellent in the room. I told her that she was allergic to mosquito bites. She also saw that it was a bit serious. After waiting for a day, there was no sympathy, and no toilet water was even sent.
I applied with Ctrip to stay for only one day and then check out. Because I was going to the duty-free shop, I didn’t check in Capella one day in advance. I went to stay at the Addison. For those of you who want to come to honeymoon for jw Marriott’s pool room... still don’t come. No, don’t come if the price is more than 700 yuan, it is only worth the price below 700 (and from the beginning of the booking to now the price has been reduced by more than 1,000 yuan per night... shocked, but Ctrip helped me deal with the price difference)
Special thanks to Ctrip, absolutely! It really takes 3 minutes to respond to 5 minutes to solve, and the solution is always very satisfying and thoughtful. It is not Ctrip. It is estimated to be annoying.

🚗 Transportation: 15 minutes away from the duty-free shop, more than half an hour away from Wuzhizhou

msg:🍃Environment: The hotel equipment and environment are all newly renovated. The guest rooms are equipped with air purifiers. It is really good that the hotel by the sea can be almost damp-free.
🔔Service: The honeymoon trip has made room decorations in advance, welcome fruits and Hermès boxes, check-in experience is full, and there is a daily mini bar, which satisfies all the cold drinks after a day of fun to relieve the heat.
🧹Hygienic: clean and tidy, no odor, clean the guest room in the morning, and the night room will be cleaned up after the rest in the afternoon, which is worth the price.
🚗 Transportation: Finally, let's talk about transportation. It is very convenient to drive to Atlantis and duty-free shops for about 5 minutes.

msg:The JW Marriott Resort Hotel in Sanya is really beautiful in appearance. The Mediterranean style is full. The moment you enter the room, the sea breeze blows the holiday a**osphere. The interior style is simple and a**ospheric, clean and tidy on the basis of the hotel as a whole , Cassie at the front desk specially helped to upgrade the room type. Some of the fly in the oin**ent is that the room has a musty smell, but she personally helped to change the room. The sofa at the end of the bed is facing the balcony, and it feels very comfortable to sit and enjoy the scenery.
Service: The hotel service is very considerate. When you take a taxi to the front of the hotel, there will usually be a welcome help to open the door, and the staff will take the initiative to help carry heavy luggage. When the aunt was cleaning the room, the hotel also sent exquisite fruits and Hermes washing gift boxes. Cassie at the front desk added our WeChat, daily greetings, and it was super convenient to find her if you had any questions.
Surroundings: The hotel is located in Haitang Bay, near the famous Atlantis Water World, a super large duty-free shop, Houhai Resort (there are many small bars with good a**osphere by the sea), a night market with various special snacks... Just around Eat, drink and play is enough to fill our short and wonderful vacation

msg:The trip with my girlfriend happened to be in time for my birthday. The hotel worked overtime to make a cake and delivered it to the room. The lady at the front desk, Nancy, was so nice too! Helped us upgrade the room type, registered when we checked in, and arranged for the car for the past few days and 5% off at the duty-free shop. We will ask about the situation every day, and we can help with any problem. Next time you come to Marriott, you will also find a lady. The waiter at the restaurant was also very good (although I only eat in the morning), I said I wanted to eat small steamed buns, but I came with a plate of all kinds of noodles. The hotel has a very convenient bus. It takes 5 minutes to the duty-free shop and a little over an hour to the airport. In short, Marriott is worth a try!

msg:🔔Service: When I checked into JW Marriott, the concierge at the door deliberately hit me and almost injured me!!! He didn't let me check in first and then park. I wanted to refund the money and not stay, so he stopped my car!!!

In any hotel, there will not be only one concierge. Parking without guests is at least allowed to park temporarily for guests to check in first. What's more, I was carrying a 26-meter suitcase, a sports bag, a carry-on bag and packed food. The parking concierge named Chris, I asked him to help me park for a while, I couldn't leave my carry-on bag with him, and I couldn't pull over to the side and park in the shade without affecting the check-in and drive away. Because he was the only one at the entrance of the huge hotel, he had to make it difficult for me to park the car in the sun first and then walk up alone in the sun! I was unwilling to start the car and couldn't move, and he actually rushed in front of my car and blocked my car with his body while I was driving and stepping on the accelerator!

Anyone who has experienced slamming on the brakes to avoid a collision can understand it, not to mention that I almost hit someone in a six-star hotel that I booked at the price of half a month's salary per night in a safe environment! At that moment, my heart was like a roller coaster falling and I was sweating coldly! I am really glad that the brakes of the car are good. If it was the car two days ago, I would have hit it, because it was so close and I was caught off guard! My legs were weak and trembling when I got out of the car!

Two young girls came and said they were managers to help me solve the problem, and then they used free airport delivery and sandwiches to make up for my shock. There was no treatment or explanation for this extreme and mentally abnormal employee who did not listen to his orders and hit someone! But no one really understood that I was almost hit by a car by their employees in the Marriott Hotel!

msg:The hotels in Sanya are really too selective, so I struggled with choosing hotels for a long time before coming. In the end, JW Marriott in Haitang Bay was chosen mainly because this hotel has fewer rooms and fewer parent-child activities. There are so many parent-child hotels in Sanya. There is really no way to spend a good vacation in hotels full of babies.
The decoration style of the hotel is what I like, and it feels like a holiday abroad. The room is very large and comfortable. There is also a dehumidifier in the room. This is very intimate. The only thing is that the sea view room can only see the sea, which is blocked by a large green plant. Because it is the time of the epidemic, there are very few people who come to travel. The front desk service is useless, but the room service is super good! ! ! I woke up the next morning and found that the air conditioner in the room was leaking, and a large amount of water leaked on the floor. Soon after I called, the little brother of the room service arrived and said that the maintenance staff would be there immediately. In the end, the air conditioner was quickly repaired, and the ground was dragged in time. The room service brother saw that I brought my own neck pillow and was very enthusiastic to help me get the buckwheat pillow. He saw that I didn’t drink much in the minibar, and asked me which one I would like to drink? Would you like to add two more cans of coconut milk? It's really sweet! The smile is also very bright, I can feel that I am doing the service with heart!
The hotel's breakfast is also okay, but the quality of the fruit is really average.
But the design of the restaurant still likes it very much. There are many partitions. This design does not easily make the whole restaurant appear to be crowded and noisy. No matter where you sit, there will not be many people in your sight. I don’t like the restaurant of some hotels, which is a very large lobby. When there are too many people, it is really noisy.
The overall experience of staying in is good!

The next day, I felt that the service staff was more energetic, smiled and greeted me.
What I want to complain about most is the room facilities. I think Ctrip's bid is to open in 2019 and renovate in 2019, but I feel that the room facilities are still relatively old, not like a new hotel, it should be remodeled like the old hotel that other reviews said. .
There are black spots on the window screens, which are quite dirty, so the hygiene is also deducted.
It is worth mentioning that the breakfast is very good, hearty and delicious. Customer service also took the initiative to call to inquire about the check-in situation and take the initiative to check out late.

早餐吃的很滿足，游泳池很不錯，如果帶孩子，確實不太適合這家酒店，酒店內幾乎沒有小童項目，帶小朋友的不推薦！

首先，讓我感覺到賓至如歸的，Vivi非常貼心，非常細緻周到！不管需要什麼，都是以最快的速度送到房間。Vivi是我遇到的第一個會根據我離店時間，幫我延遲退房的！真的開心極了！
其次，作為一個超級喜歡酒店行的旅行愛好者，整棟181平方的別墅，綠化錯落有致，泳池清澈乾淨也完全可以放心遊！房間的床睡的很舒服，佈局很合理。再加上，室內裝修跟家裡很像，就更像在家裡一樣了。酒店內一步一景，真的非常漂亮！
最後，整體的工作人員都很好，服務意識絕佳，一看就是訓練有素，比很多新近網紅酒店好太多了。
老牌奢華酒店，當之無愧，有傳統是很重要的！
海灘邊真的很好，也是海棠灣最佳日出觀賞點 不次一定還要帶着全家人來住！

JW的花園，草坪和標誌性的許願池拍照出片很優雅精緻，這次還特意體驗了花園採摘，感受自然氣息的質樸；
餐廳：
西餐廳出品很純正，味道也不錯，推薦奶油蘑菇湯，醇厚濃郁還不膩，紅酒的性價比簡直驚艷，百元級千萬級真的都充滿驚喜…
位置交通：
離海棠灣免税店車程約五分鐘，酒店安排了接駁時段供住客來回，部分商品還有酒店專屬的合作折扣⋯ou

本來衹定了一晚，但是前一晚選擇的新開的泰康之家去了之後渾身起包，房間又小又潮，前台0服務… 馬上問了萬豪是否能當晚搬過去，管家Vivi服務特別熱情周到，瞭解情況後立馬幫忙協調鎖定房間 還給我們送水果升級海景房👍 
酒店環境：酒店剛開業的時候什麼樣子這麼多年過去現在看仍然保持非常好👍，海邊酒店實屬不易！
服務：高效周到，特別是管家Vivi加雞腿🍗
餐飲：一樓西餐廳還是一樣出品高

以後再來海棠灣萬豪是首選👍

沉浸體驗沒拍什麼照片，上一張隔壁酒店店慶的燈光表演吧😁

msg:説説這次入住體驗 ，首先入住第二天有的管家聯繫，Holly妹妹聯繫我們後才知道原來酒店衹有一個管家，那可以理解，期間holly服務還是很及時，有需要幫忙的都可以微信找她，還給我們準備了小椰子，其次不好的地方是入住三天，每天都有打電話讓送冰塊，可是每次送冰塊的速度都是半個小時到一個小時 ，效率明顯很低，再然後是因為我們訂的28號很早的飛機 ，要趕飛機 我們住的別墅 在四點打電話給禮賓安排禮賓車接到大堂退房，結果在房間等了15分鐘才有車來，感覺到有點怠慢，不過因為holly小姐姐的服務 才打算給五星，希望酒店做的越來越好

環境：有太陽的時候環境確實挺好的，我挺喜歡的，非常出片，不過大陰天的時候會差點，裝修佈局也很棒。
設施：住過兩個房型，每個房型都有點問題，不是門壞了，就是水管壞了，要麼就是浴缸用不了。酒店就沒個質檢員。
衞生：做續房衞生的時候小毛巾少了塊，我不跟阿姨講浴缸他就不會擦。
最後我再説一句，酒店內部管理怎麼怎麼樣跟我沒關係，我作為消費者，我衹在乎作為消費者的體驗感好不好。作為商家和管理者做不到和消費者共情，就別指望消費者和你們共情。

msg:以前去過亞龍灣，看網上説海棠灣是新開發的，全是五星級酒店，就從攜程上選了4.8分的JW萬豪，訂後看到有些平台有人避雷這個酒店，想着有品牌背書應該也不會差到哪裡去。

酒店園景確實蠻漂亮，整個酒店人不多，我們倆可能更喜歡熱鬧點的地方，來鬧中取靜的酒店也雖然有點不習慣但也在慢慢適應。

我們入住的3樓的房間，推開門有比較明顯的潮味，想着畢竟在海邊，一共也衹有4樓，之前看評論也有心理準備，就這樣吧。一般來説這個味道習慣就好，但不太能忍受的是，躺在床上睡覺也能聞到潮味，閉上眼感覺像在山林裏面的客棧一樣，介意的同學們避雷。

另外房間的床腳正對陽台，酒店電視在床的右前方面朝沙發而不朝床，如果想躺床上看電視需要將電視拉出來，但是拉出來也是斜對着而非正對着，跟前台溝通大部分房型都這樣，躺床上有看電視需求的同學訂這家要考慮下。建議酒店加個投影加個可以收到天花板的幕布，能很好解決這個問題。

入住的時候minibar沒有補充，説是後面補，補了薯片和飲料。下午餓了想吃個薯片，excuse me？為啥薯片是開過的，裏面的薯片都碎了。見圖片。我到現在都沒想通這是為什麼！！

最不能忍受的點在晚上睡覺前爆發了。晚上睡覺前想關衞生間的燈，關不上，按鍵無反應？？見視頻。

我打前台電話，想問問是不是我沒理解對開關按鈕的對應關係，好傢伙，直接打不通，不是沒人接，是直接打不通的那種急促的“嘟嘟嘟”。前台不是24小時值班？？衹能關上門漏點光湊合睡。

把門關上，其他燈也熄掉，睡前想起來沒吃葯，想按個總開關把房間的所有燈打開去找葯吃。excuse me，按總開關也沒反應？？見視頻。床頭兩邊的總開關都沒反應？？

我就算住快捷酒店，都沒遇到房間燈關不上，總開關沒反應的情況，這還是1500+一晚的萬豪最高定位的JW？

本來定了5天4晚，想在這裏好好度假，入住第一天實屬鬧心連夜聯繫攜程把剩下的退了趕緊跑路，哪怕臨時定第二天的酒店溢價1000我都不想呆了。

潤到了亞龍灣xx酒店，這才是我熟悉的感覺，沙灘上有躺椅遮陽傘娛樂設施，海邊有餐廳酒吧和駐唱歌手，也可以下海游泳。感謝JW把我後面幾天的退了拯救我的假期。

🏝幫父母安排的行程，3月的三亞簡直不要太合適旅行！海棠灣選擇了JW萬豪酒店，地理位置很好。酒店配套的飯店不錯，如果想吃點別的離旁邊的68商業中心環球美食街非常近，走路幾分鐘。裏面有很多比較有名的連鎖餐飲，很方便。
🏖酒店整體服務水平非常好。入住日前幾天酒店客户經理樂樂就打電話確認行程及入住時間，得知酒店是給父母定的，非常貼心的介紹酒店餐廳、設施，還贈送了果盤和椰子。每天還會微信詢問我是否有需要幫忙安排的事情，五星好評🌟
🧉早餐非常豐富！老少皆宜！
🌺房間很大，設施新，酒店很漂亮。有9個户外泳池，娛樂項目也很多。行程很愉快，適合度假。

msg:酒店是西班牙歐式園林風格，綠植林立。人少安靜私密，這一點就加分無數。位置交通：距離免税城、水世界、蜈支洲島等景點很近，周圍美食也很多！酒店管家樂樂的服務態度很好，小孕婦出行，這次真的很感謝樂樂的照顧[抱拳][抱拳]
房間設施：酒店歐式調調很高級，房間寬敞、乾淨，房間超大，吃的也好，早餐豐富，中西廚餐廳都很棒，度假feel拉滿，安靜，目前對親子項目需求沒那麼大，所以選擇JW萬豪剛剛好。
早餐：種類豐富，服務周到。
游泳池：大小泳池有很多，分佈在酒店各處，很方便，水質也不錯。

📍位置交通：交通有點不方便，但是打車就好
🍃服務：很棒
酒店整體裝修感覺是美國南方的風格，海棠灣海浪太大，酒店佈局合理，環境幽靜，裝修品味在線，服務生服務態度很好

餐廳整體比較好，早餐種類尚可，整體而言非常滿意，下次再來海棠灣還過來

歐式對稱性建築  也很有版納的風情，房間繼承了萬豪一貫的內飾，樂樂很熱情，及時幫我們解決了很多難題。
🏠房間設施：房間升級到泳池房，設施齊全
酒店房間本身很出片。但是酒店內玩樂設施相對比較少，適合喜歡安靜的人，值得推薦。

衞生：非常好！


環境：會想讓我二刷的酒店，和很多三亞其他酒店不一樣的歐式風情，晚上逛酒店真的是一種享受。離沙灘也很近，綠化很好，泳池也舒服。拍照真的超級好拍，隨便出大片的feel！

服務：前台小哥哥小姐姐真的超級nice，尤其是Peter ！必須大力表揚！因為是和父母一起來所以定了兩個房間，但是沒有提前告知所以房間不太容易安排到一起。之前被系統安排定好的中間隔開了十幾個房間有點遠然後我們就去大堂説要重新弄，Peter超級耐心的給我們安排並且調度，然後真的就住在一起了！！父母也很開心！而且還給我們升級了嗚嗚嗚嗚，像房間贈送的水果吖下午茶什麼的都事無鉅細的交代的清清楚楚，真的體驗感拉滿了！

總之這次三亞之行，萬豪真的給我了很棒的體驗和印象！下次來三亞一定會再次入住的酒店！

msg:首先，本人很少認真評論酒店，一般都是完成客户經理的工作任務，要求好評並且帶上他們的名字（極其反感這種動作）。
       其次，很少酒店能做到100分，客户願意提出問題就是願意酒店能改進，並且期待下次的相遇，如不喜歡，差評拉黑就好。説説本次旅行，海棠灣jw萬豪，三晚純親子游。
       1，酒店硬件方面，2019年開業，在海棠灣眾多酒店裡算新的，房間很大，空間用起來很舒服，除了和喜來登共享小童活動設施外，其他沒有什麼可挑剔的地方，海棠灣我也住過不少品牌，萬豪可以打90分。
       2，軟件方面，客户經理Eileen樂樂能出發前溝通好需求，並且全程跟進我入住期間的需求，有問題儘快反饋整改（此處評論是我主動好評）。在酒店內遇到的服務員都能主動被打招呼及獲得微笑，這個細節，還是能打動我，過年期間住了杭州喜來登和上海洲際，感覺到都是冷漠的高傲，不及熱帶地區的酒店熱情。客房服務，酒店每天的minibar都免費，下午會補充一次，品種很多，汽水薯片啤酒，很感慨，雖然羊毛出在羊身上，但是有打動住客的心，最後一晚我還獲得管家贈送的小甜品；入住第一天，嫌廁所有騷味，連續兩天，客服部都有持續跟進，並及時提出換房，但因為我不想折騰，最後沒有選擇換房。餐飲:早餐品種不算多，可能餐廳區域不夠大，但基本符合我的早餐需求，還有服務員推着蒸籠車，像足早茶 最喜歡沙拉，如果能配置調配的大沙拉碗就更好。如實在有不滿意的地方，就是有一天早上沙拉拿多了，不想浪費，提出能否打包剩下的，被拒絕，我知道酒店自助餐不能打包，但還是缺少一點點人性化，在判斷我不是刻意打包的情況下，能否一起節約食物？另外，缺少小童活動，酒店可以考慮改進。
      這兩年，住萬豪次數逐漸多了，以前則比較喜歡洲際和凱悦系，總體而言，這次行程又讓萬豪在我心中加分，比較滿意，兒子説下次還要入住萬豪，我覺得酒店就跑贏了。

整體服務蠻到位的，除了正常的接待幫送行李打掃衞生和補充迷你吧，服務人員都還算熱情。三樓大廳視野不錯，下午茶時間還是蠻享受的。衞生還可以，房間整潔但地面光腳踩有沙子的感覺。
自助早餐品類不多，味道差強人意，就是印象中一般酒店自助餐的樣子。
對比價格不是特別值，但一家人在海邊玩的很開心，也算是有温暖的回憶了，酒店樂樂的服務很點贊👍🏿

入住的時候給我們配了管家樂樂eileen ，度假體驗感拉滿，要什麼東西直接微信説一聲就好，超方便，什麼安排打掃、預約班車、游泳池大大小小的很多，就是有點點淺，一般都是1米2，衹有一個池子1米5，玩玩水蠻好的。和隔壁喜來登是公用設施的，那邊比較熱鬧，我們有時候會去那邊蹭泳池。健身房設施還比較全，去的人不多，很清凈。
花園裡蚊子有點多，房間裏配了花露水和液體蚊香。

位置交通：距離免税店大概十分鐘車程，還是比較近的！位置交通：沿着海棠北路沿線跟亞特蘭蒂斯中間隔了一個香格里拉。到三亞免税城直線距離大概也在三四公里。

下午五點入住後發現房間一股黴味，櫃子抽屜佈滿黴菌，浴缸發黃，電視花屏，要求換房。20分鐘後等來客房部説衹能用抹布擦擦黴，再次要求換房，半小時後收到回覆：無同房型，要麼降回到原房型，要麼忍着，沒別的辦法。由於“高效”服務響應，時間來到了下午六點後，無奈去看了原房型，空氣中瀰漫著羊騷味，於是拒絕換房並主動提議送晚餐，值班經理表示送不了，送下午茶已仁至義盡，要麼就差評吧。好的，下午茶要吃，為彌補我感受到價格與服務極其不匹配的落差，差評我也會給，為滿足酒店方給出的擺爛回覆。

服務：酒店服務很貼心，見面都會很熱情問候，管家樂樂還貼心準備了小禮物～
衞生：打掃的很勤，公區庭園 幾個大泳池都很乾凈；
環境：酒店在海棠灣一片算是非常低密度了，住了四天很安靜愜意；配套齊全，恆温泳池有點小但對三歲寶寶來説很夠了，稍走一段就是沙灘，小童樂園和希爾頓共同的相比來説有點侷促。

msg:“以自然為本，以人為本”。兼顧實際需求與設計美感的設計讓這裏更像是海邊的西班牙式莊園。踏進這裏的一瞬間，思緒就不自覺地被帶回地中海的陽光下。
位置:
酒店地處海棠灣C位，10分鐘以內的車程可抵達免税店、亞特蘭蒂斯水世界和隔壁的海棠68環球美食街。從酒店的園林一直往前走，就可以走到海灘。交通位置可以説十分方便了。環境:
酒店最深得我心的是它的園林景觀設計:園林中點綴着紅陶筒瓦的屋頂、連綿的拱廊、孔雀亭和八角許願池，還有4個不同大小的泳池 同時，偌大的莊園中，是一家不折不扣的低密度型酒店，讓人能充分享受私人度假時光。
酒店樂樂服務非常貼心，時時問候，下次還過來
客房:
酒店的房型也同樣闊綽，基礎客房的面積也在70餘平，而且還有迷你水吧與私人陽台。一樓的泳池房型還可以享受漂浮早餐和下午茶。整座樓掩映在綠林之中的房間與別墅裏，一天之中不停光影的變幻讓人真的感覺自己來到了西班牙莊園度假。
值得一提的是，酒店房間的動線設計合理，充分考慮了住客的實際需求。

酒店很貼心，在入住前一天會有eileen聯繫了我，酒店服務很周到，處處關心，還有接機和送機的接駁車（固定時間），一天好像有個4-5個班次，在入住之前我看了很多評論説JW萬豪的位置，房間都比較潮濕有黴味。房間很大，乾濕分離的，。一開窗簾引入眼簾就是泳池，泳池不大，裏有一個網紅小白馬泳遊圈，拍照很贊。酒店整體是西班牙莊園風格，大堂有人全天在彈湊（不太懂樂器，應該是西班牙豎琴），園中有很多躺椅都可以躺下，很愜意。我們住的房間離海灘走路5分鐘，由於海棠灣浪很大不能下海，但是海浪真的很美。海灘上有很多野生攝影師，我們的房間送了鉑爵旅拍5張精修和短視頻就沒找。
JW萬豪還有一個我們很喜歡的點就是不像亞特整體人不是很多，所以特別適合喜歡僻靜的人。但是很有特色，和莊園融為一體而且就是連結在一起的。早餐也很不錯，omelet和各種點心，熟食，果汁也是鮮榨的。由於酒店比較大，我和對象每次初酒店都是自己走的，要走個8分鐘左右，其實是可以在大廳直接要接駁車出去，。去免税店也有接駁車和酒店折扣。整體感覺在海棠灣在一排高奢酒店裡麪性價比算很不錯

服務：酒店的工作人員服務態度都超級超級好，尤其是我們的管家eileen ，在入住後第一時間加上了我的微信，！有需求也是第一時間回覆我們，亞特蘭蒂斯，人多，不得不説，萬豪更適合尋求安靜度假不帶孩子的人居住，整體房間不多，人也不多！每天詢問我們的需求。非常貼心。感受很棒👍，其他服務人員態度也很好，客房服務酒水暢飲，感覺根本喝不完。再就是早餐沒的説哈哈，應有盡有！總之很滿意，禮賓和前台服務都特別好

Eileen 的熱情幫助和解答。酒店地處海棠灣C位，10分鐘以內的車程可抵達免税店、亞特蘭蒂斯水世界和隔壁的海棠68環球美食街。從酒店的園林一直往前走，就可以走到海灘。交通位置可以説十分方便了。
酒店的房型也同樣闊綽，基礎客房的面積也在70餘平，而且還有迷你水吧與私人陽台，在線服務和回覆相關問題讓度假變得更加的順滑，酒店很大，很大很私密安靜，希望下次有機會繼續探索該酒店。

1月入住的，避開了過年高峯，對比隔壁亞特蘭蒂斯得喧囂，酒店很幽靜很愜意，夜景很有氛圍，很適合喜歡安靜的人呢，酒店樂樂的服務很是貼心，下次還會選擇。
邁進酒店大門，眼前是一片延伸的園林，如同世外桃源。這裡是桃花源地，盡情感受大自然的擁抱！想象一下，在酒店中漫步，穿過寧靜的園林，就能欣賞到美麗的海濱風光。這裏主打私密的海島度假，真的超讚。
JW萬豪不僅是風景優美的度假勝地，還是為你提供滿分身心體驗的天堂。站在別墅的私人陽台上，看着藍天碧水白雲，感受海風拂面；在私人泳池中暢遊，釋放心靈。

前台的的服務態度比較冷淡，在為我們的辦理入住的時候還在和另一位同事爭辯某事務是否是前台的指責？ 使我們對這裏的第一印象大打折扣，希望以後可以加強培訓吧。

酒店與海棠灣鬱鬱葱葱	的景色渾然一體，呈現了整個海岸的迷人魅力，周邊設施齊全，海上活動多豐富，拍照超級出片，酒店由美國 SRSS建築設計事務所設計	，以	“石”為設計理念，採用的紅陶筒瓦、連綿的拱廊、孔雀亭、八角許願池，將大氣時尚與東方文化相結合，很是大氣，西班牙風格，Eileen 提前加了微信，事事招呼，下次還會過來
在酒店附近，有很多好吃的小店和購物的地方。特別推薦海棠灣的沙灘，沙子細膩，海水清澈，真的是太美了!

從踏入酒店大堂的那一刻起，我們就被那份奢華與優雅深深吸引。
酒店位於迷人的海棠灣	這裏的風 如畫碧海藍天，無論是日出還是日落，都美得令人窒息
你可以盡情享受陽光和海浪。
我們當然是定的海景房， 從陽台上可以看到美麗的海景，讓人心情愉悦。傍晚時分 一起 和家人享受 是多麼愜意的一件事
海浪拍打着礁石，微風輕拂着臉頰， 彷彿所有的煩惱都被拋到了九霄雲外拍 時間彷彿靜止了，一切都變得那麼寧靜和美好
這個聖誕節，很開心哦，eileen特意準備了聖誕小餅乾給小朋友，很是貼心哦，就小朋友較多，所需品也是多的，還是希望酒店多配一些嬰兒用品，更便捷一些。孩子活動可以豐富一下

賓客主管mm、挺不錯
4層保潔人員幹活很利索
賓客服務中心人員也不錯、晚上11點左右不小心把礦泉水撒到了床上，也及時給了處理辦法
整天來説還是不錯的、尤其是酒店所有的工作人員，給我感覺挺好。

酒店安排出乎意料的好，給的優惠券是可以在免税店用的優惠券。
