msg:Excellent boutique hotel located within OCT Happy Coast. We had a spacious room with a wide balcony allowing us to take in views of the festivities over the New Year's Eve weekend. We especially loved the daily evening fruit platter sent to our room, which was an absolute delight! Thank you Bay Breeze Hotel for a wonderful stay - we really appreciate it as we're visiting Shenzhen for the first time from Singapore.

I always pay attention to the smell when just enter and this one is pleasant. Rooms are big and super clean. Service is nice but you must speak Chinese as we met none of English speaking staff. The great dislike was the breakfast. It's not a buffet and you can choose Chinese or Western breakfast. We chose Western which was tiny. Egg, toast, coffee, juice, after we finished it had to go outside to find something more

Both of them are very polite and happy to provide customers with appropriate help and solve problems.
The hotel is close to the Shenzhen Railway Station. The transportation is very convenient. The rooms are spacious and the food and drinks in the small refrigerator are free. There are restaurants, shops, large shopping malls with different characteristics around, and there are fireworks shows at night. It is also very enjoyable as a short vacation.
It would be better if the room could be better sanitized and free of bed bugs.

The hotel is located on the Happy Coast and has many famous restaurants. In the evening, you can go to the pier to enjoy the fireworks show in the stands opposite. But at twelve o'clock at night, most restaurants were closed and there was no one around. There was no way to have a late-night snack. I had to take a taxi to the nearby Baishizhou Food Street for a late-night snack. Will come again!

I watched the Water Show Theater again, because I live in Shenzhen, and it is more controllable by the hotel. We regularly go on weekend family trips. The only uncomfortable thing is that when I was about to check out today, I asked the lady in charge of cleaning the guest room for two paper bags to put in a change of clothes. The second time I asked for a bottle of mineral water When we were mixing water for the children, the housekeeping lady was cleaning up in other rooms. It was the cleaning lady at the door who told the lady inside that the customer wanted a bottle of mineral water. I heard the lady inside saying why there were so many things. My first reaction was... You said me, because I asked her for a paper bag once before. When she came out, I asked her, are you talking about me? She quickly explained that of course not, she would never talk to customers like this, she was talking about something else. Maybe I was overthinking it, but my intuitive feeling at the time was indeed not very good, but it did not affect my overall evaluation of the hotel and its overall service!

In terms of sanitary facilities in the room, I noticed that many places were covered with old dust. The air-conditioning outlet partition was missing and a bit dusty. I drove out in the second grade of junior high school and came back to the hotel door at around 8pm and asked the security guard if I could park on the ground (because I was walking in the first grade of junior high school). When I went out, I saw that the entrance to the garage closest to the hotel was closed.) I was told that it was difficult to park on the ground, so I had to park underground. I asked if the entrance to the garage was open, and the answer was that I didn't know if it was closed. I told them to drive over and check, but the sad result was that the entrance was still closed. , it was jammed all the way, there were so many people and cars, and several entrances were sealed. I asked if I would not be allowed in if I stayed at the hotel. I was told that I would wait until later when there were less people. I was blocked for more than half an hour in just one circle. I returned to the door and was a little angry. He told the security guard and then removed the ice cream bucket and put it on the ground. This sentence was unclear, and the guest almost collapsed.

The entire hotel is decorated with wood-brown Chinese style and auspicious cloud decorative patterns, which is quite stylish. The rooms are spacious and well-organized. The balcony is still collapsed, so it's good to rest on the balcony when it's cool.
The disadvantage is that some facilities have practical problems. The toilet seat has no damping and blocks the flush button. You have to put the toilet seat down every time you flush. It will fall down with a loud bang and the sound is scary at night. The sink is too narrow and water will splash out when washing your face. There are no handrails in the bathtub, making it inconvenient to get in and out.
There seemed to be all handsome guys at the front desk. The one who was sitting at the front desk was very dull when he checked in, but the one who was leaving was quite enthusiastic and would stand up to greet guests when they left.

The hotel is very charming and the details are very attentive. There is a large balcony, which is great for drinking tea. The view is wide and unobstructed. The hotel is well soundproofed, the bedding is comfortable, and the supplies are L'Occitane (a small hand cream was also thoughtfully given). Great value for money. I think it feels better than five-star hotels such as JW Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, and InterContinental in Shenzhen. There are many restaurants around and the transportation is very convenient. I will definitely stay here again next time. Cora at the front desk has good service, thumbs up.

When checking out, it took more than ten or twenty minutes, and I was reminded at least 4-5 times, and by different people. Can't the hotel's staff training be more flexible? They tell you the hotel rules as soon as you come in, and you charge fees and so on. After listening to this, do you think the guests will feel good about it? Will you change the way you speak? . . Really speechless. The so-called 5-star hotel provides 1-star customer service.
I originally wanted to give it a 5-star rating when I checked in. The hotel environment and rooms were also good. But the service experience is really poor.
The room size is also moderate and the space feels quite large. Sound insulation can be improved.

Location: Good location
Cleanliness: Good cleanliness

The service is unsatisfactory. I experienced several bad points during the two nights. For example, I chatted with my friends in the hotel lobby for a while after dinner. After my friend left, I didn't go back to my room during the lunch break. I sat down on the sofa in the lobby downstairs to rest for a while and closed my eyes. I was just a little sleepy when I was woken up by loud noises. When I opened my eyes, I saw several bookstore waitresses doing cleaning work. He was moving stools, wiping the sofa, and talking loudly. He knew that several guests were sitting and resting on the sofa in the lobby. How could he be so loud? Don’t even people with a little bit of heart behave like this? In addition, before I checked out, the cleaning lady took away the snacks and fruits I bought. How could I just take the guests' things without permission? I really feel like the service in this class of hotel is not worthy of it.

2. The remote control of the hotel TV didn’t work well. After pressing it for a long time, the service staff came and said that there was no electricity, and then asked me very unhappy, are you sure you want to watch it? Then I changed the remote.
3. When I was leaving, there was something wrong with the suitcase. I wanted to borrow a screwdriver or something, and then told me that I didn’t have any, so I didn’t say anything else. I didn’t even give it a last chance to restore my impression! !
4. When I was going to sleep, I was just about to place a pillow, and such a small animal came into view. I don’t know if it is common in the south, but I feel very uncomfortable anyway!
In short, except for the location, there is no place worthy of five stars!

The most unforgettable thing this time was when I was about to go to bed in the room at about 1am. The lights in the room turned off four times by themselves. Every time I turned them on again, they all turned off automatically after less than a minute. It was a bit strange.

msg:The hotel's service is really sorry for the price, it is recommended to choose carefully. When I checked in for the first time, I was interrupted several times and had to wait for a long time. Second, there is a charge for adding a bath product. I have stayed in so many hotels, and this is the first time I have encountered it. Third, I have to repeat for a long time to ask for a piece of paper and pen. I feel that the waiters have not been trained. . Don't think of extra care and services for bringing children. For the price of more than 1,000, it is recommended to add some money to live in Andaz. You can experience the obvious service gap. InterContinental, Marriott with the same price, and even prices lower than this one, kapok, westin, Langting are all better than this service There are many specialties. Therefore, although this hotel is listed as a five-star hotel, it is said to be a boutique and luxury hotel, but in fact the service should be at the level of an express hotel.

When we checked in, the lady at the front desk said that the hotel did not recognize the residence permit issued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and they almost refused to let us check in. I repeatedly explained that this residence permit can (already) fly, and other cities can stay in hotels. I explained it for a while. to check in.
It will be more convenient to bring your own flashlight when you enter the room. The room is dark. One of the two lights entering the door is not on, and the bedside light is not on. If you want it to be on, you can stand by the switch and keep pressing the switch. Bright

It’s more convenient for eating and shopping, even if you need a nucleic acid test. The breakfast is also exquisite and quality. Although there are not many categories, it tastes good. Disadvantages: It may be due to personal reasons. I don’t like the dark wood structure with a Southeast Asian style. The overall lighting of the hotel is not enough. The aisles and rooms are quite dark. The children are a little scared. I brought two children by myself. The children’s fear is infected... But the infrastructure used to be honest is still very careful, maybe designer style~ business is OK, bringing a baby is not recommended

There is nothing to say about the location of the hotel, the surrounding facilities are complete, the food, accommodation and play are integrated, not tired! The room is spacious and bright, clean and tidy, Hansgrohe's faucet shower, Ferragamo's bath products, in short, the matching is still very good!

早就聽説他們家的大陽台可以看到超美夜景
入住了之後簡直愛上這種大隱於市的感覺
城市中也能找到一處讓人沉靜下來的地方
現代中式的裝修風格✨透露着故事感的擺件
每個細節都做得很好
下樓五分鐘不到就是歡樂海岸啦
👉逛累了就回酒店休息不要太方便
.
跟閨蜜訂的大床房
房間格局方正，設施齊全
洗護用品都是用的歐舒丹😌還蠻精緻的
不得不説房間的大陽台我真的愛了
趕上日落的時候入住可以在陽台用個晚餐
如果需要也可以直接在房間內的小型酒櫃用酒
🌃吹着風坐在榻榻米上看夜景聊天喝酒太愜意了
.
👍🏻酒店內還有很多值得打卡、拍照的地方哦
書吧一整面牆的書，無論是觀感還是拍照都很可
坐下來安靜地看個書喝喝下午茶
一下午的時間在這裏不算浪費！
還有酒店大堂的下沉吧
到了晚上暖暖的燈光亮起✨氛圍感拉滿
吃早餐的時候發現他們的餐具都充滿了藝術感
🎨餐盤上還有畫兒呢~

缺點：服務一般。兩點多的時候辦入住，等了十幾分鍾才到我，又不是旺季又不是節假日，然後前台跟我説辦不了，還沒打掃出來。我説那是你們的錯，兩點以後入住酒店是行業慣例，我也着急要更衣收拾一下去商務洽談。前台説沒辦法，前面的客人退房晚，就是沒有房間。我説那你會給我相應費用的減免嗎？最後還是旁邊的同事給瞭解決方案。

服務很好，送了水果。室內很乾凈，陽台寬敞可以看落日，可惜夏天太曬太熱。樓下泳池看上去不錯，其他設施齊全方便。

提點意見: 室內抽濕機太吵影響休息衹好關掉。衞生間和淋浴室分開但照明燈不能單獨控制，房間總開關一按全滅全開但其他照明無法控制。浴缸前的電視是擺設，衹有幾個台還是廣告和體育。

1、環境安靜、設計風格美觀舒適，衞生乾淨整潔漂亮，房間非常大，設施全，住宿體驗太棒了；
2、就位於歡樂海岸，無論是欣賞深圳灣風景、購物餐飲或者交通都非常方便；
3、最值得一提的就是這家酒店為賓客提供的優質、熱情洋溢服務。此次入住前，家人腿部臨時受傷，酒店保安部張經理開車接送我們到附近就醫，客房服務饒珊對我們照顧無微不至，一次次的送來椅子、冰桶，在我們外出就醫期間幫忙照顧小孩，送來水果等食物安撫，讓我們身處外地遇到困難時也感受到了家人的温暖。非常感謝張經理和饒珊，以及酒店的員工們為賓客提供了非常優質的服務。

白天把包存到了前台，晚上過去取，前台告知我的東西被別人取走了。我真是一臉懵逼：你們酒店對待客人的物品都這麼隨便嗎？我的包存在這 誰想拿走就拿走？
第二天退房，我要去機場，酒店還沒找到我的行李，説是聯繫不到那個取錯行李的人？？真NB。
離開深圳 等了四天，酒店還沒聯繫我，在我打電話催促之後，説是幫我找到後寄給我？
真長見識了，推薦大家以後去這個酒店零元購。看到別人前台存了貴重物品 直接過去拿就好。反正沒人管。

另外，我入住的時間是週末，週六和週日早上7點多，震耳欲聾的裝修聲把我驚醒。我真感謝貴酒店的叫醒服務！而且這個裝修從早上7點多到晚上11點。酒店為了讓我在週末的白天也能精神飽滿，真是煞費苦心啊。我謝你們全體工作人員。👍
