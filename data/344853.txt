The view from the room is magnificent, but I personally do not like the room displacement of Hyatt. It tries to be contemporary, but it ends up to be uncomfortable. The breakfast is very rich and the food quality is top. Pool at the 24th floor is also enjoyable.

msg:I stayed at this hotel with my partners from 2009 to 2019, but when the pandemic hit, we stopped coming to China for three years. This time, I decided to come with my family, and here's what we experienced:

Terrible service: they provided the cheapest baby crib and the cheapest bedding. There's not even a children's play area, and the breakfasts have become just awful compared to what they used to be. I gave them children's pasta to cook, and they just poured boiling water over it and served it. It was horrible. We left a valuable children's plate at breakfast and when we came back the next day, it was gone, and they said they didn't have it, which means they either threw it away or stole it.
The waiters barely understand English, and only after someone senior came over were we able to explain what we needed. We were constantly stressed and decided to change hotels to one with excellent service, and I am writing this review from such a place, where the service, crib, and food are top-notch.

But the most terrible moment came at the end when we were checking out. I simply asked for help as a tourist with calling a taxi through an app, as I had a lot of luggage and wanted to order a minivan, but I didn't have any money on my WeChat. I offered to give them 100 yuan in cash if they could help call a taxi. The chief manager approached and rudely and arrogantly stated that such a service does not fall within our hotel's policy, refusing us even though we were standing there with a child in our arms asking for help.

I was appalled by his behavior and stated that this was a terrible hotel that had gone downhill, and I asked for a complaint book to write all this down, although initially, I just wanted to leave and forget everything. But in response to my request for a complaint book, he handed me a piece of paper 5 by 5 cm in size and said, "Here, write on this." When I asked what this was, he replied, "Write your complaint here," and when I asked him to provide a real complaint book, he answered that the hotel does not have one. When I asked to call the manager, he said he was the manager.

I was shocked at how arrogantly and rudely he treated the customers. I have stayed at Hyatt hotels all over the world - in China, Indonesia, Europe, Japan, Russia, but I have never encountered such service anywhere.

Sherry mumbled something in Chinese that she didn't think I understood, but I understand Chinese. This used to be the place for foreigners to go to get 5 star treatment, but lately the front desk new hires are pompous and arrogant. They do not understand what true five star service is, and the won't lift a finger to help you unless it's to take your money. This could be my last stay there. It may be suitable for Chinese, but if you are a foreigner looking for true 5 star service in China, might I recommend the Hilton. On a positive note,  the cleaning staff are very friendly and hard-working.

When I checked in, I realised I have booked it wrongly with check in date 2 days earlier. Trip.com liaised with hotel for me pro-actively to try to revise on system. 

After rounds of communication, hotel get back to me saying saying “management” didn’t allow to revise and I must pay another night if I need to stay. 

Sticking to the T&C,  I’m indeed the one who made reservation wrongly. While for the hotel in such a big group, the service providing in terms of treating clients strictly by the book with never compromising attitude is really out expectation, letting alone I’m one of the hotel members! 

Hotel experience is never about the environment only. It’s more about caring and the service provided for clients. If the management has this sense, I think they won’t solve my case with this manner. Hope the policy and the service team, management can be more client oriented.

It is in a prime location in town, near anything you need. The staff was very helpful, food was great and room service came in a short time.
The only issues I found was the bathtub is too tall to get in it, if you arent tall; plus, the room had some dust in some spots, especially at the bedside table when I first arrived. And lastly, the staff has limited English level in general, which you would expect a bit better level, at least from Front Desk considering  the hotel being an international brand and at an important business area.

msg:I would only outline three problems, although there were, in fact, many more. The first is about room hygiene, which is supposed to be one of the most critical priorities for any hotel. Basically, what happened was that I discovered there were two pieces of used notepad papers right on top of the wash pan. The very existence of these papers could not have been more obvious. I did not find them particularly troubling at first, but I soon realized the severity of this problem. It was not these papers in themselves being the problem; the scary thing is the problem behind their very existence: given that the housekeeping could not even spot these two pieces of trash that I could immediately spot once I stepped into the room, how could I believe that they had done their job to have thoroughly cleaned the room? Given that they could not even clean these two simple papers, how can I believe they had done their jobs cleaning the bath, the shower, the desk, or even the bed? I understand that there was also a chance that the housekeeping had done everything but just accidentally omitted the two pieces of paper trash. I also recognize how busy the housekeeping team was, and I was and am very grateful for their services. However, the very existence of these two pieces of trash is still quite a blow to one’s confidence in the overall hygiene of the hotel.

The second problem is a typical one among the Hyatt properties I have visited – they did not care about guests' room preferences, even if I had already notified them one day in advance. I asked my travel agency to inform the hotel about my room preferences one day before my arrival. The hotel confirmed they had taken note of that and would try to accommodate. However, the hotel not only did not make any arrangement in advance (which I will explain later how I discovered they did not), they did not even make that arrangement on the spot. How did I know they did not make the arrangement even on the spot? In the middle of the check-in process, suddenly recalling how irresponsive Hyatt hotels had been to my pre-arrival notes, I asked the lady helping me to check in whether she had seen my room preferences. Only on that spot did they browse through the system to check my preference. In other words, had I not reminded my preferences to the hotel again during check-in, the hotel would not have paid any attention to them. How can I be convinced that the hotel did spend even a little effort to accommodate my preferences, given that the check-in desk did not even know my preferences? There is only one possibility – the reservation department had already helped me reserve a room in advance that matches my preferences. However, I could quickly rule out this possibility because the check-in desk told me, “Okay, we will try to find a room that best matches your preferences among all rooms that we have now". This reveals that not even the reservation department made the arrangement; otherwise, the check-in desk would not need to make the arrangement right on the spot. Overall, I find it highly believable that Grand Hyatt initially intended to totally ignore guests' room preference, given that the reservation team did not make the arrangement nor the check-in desk have done so had I had reminded them again. I do not find a hotel that would systematically neglect guests' preferences a decent hotel. Fortunately, the lady heading the front desk could fix the problems by arranging a room I preferred at last. However, the overall experience of realizing that the hotel did not intend to acknowledge guests' preferences without the guests' continuously reminding them is bothering.

Hygiene: There is a night bed service, and the details are also good.

Environment: I booked this place for the location. Going down to APM is the fastest and most time-saving way to take the kids out, and you can also take a walk. There are all kinds of food, museums, libraries, and theaters are all around here. You can take pictures of Guangzhou Tower from any angle.

Service: Hytte's service should be the most important reason for its existence. Booking is for peace of mind. Although there was a little episode when checking in, it was solved very quickly. You can't feel how many employees there are, but the problem can be solved immediately. The biggest problem of many hotel chains is that the employees stand too much and the problem cannot be solved.

msg:The carpet in the room I was assigned to for the first time was very dirty, and the quilt was very hard and yellow. It didn't feel very clean. It was not as comfortable as the quilt in Guangdong Guest House. Later, the hotel changed to a second room and it was much better. My home I found mosquitoes in the elevator in the hotel lobby and was bitten. My face turned red. Fortunately, nothing happened the next day. It is really rare to see mosquitoes in the elevator in the lobby of a five-star hotel. However, the hotel staff were very polite and my family did not hesitate. I know how to make coffee. They made three cups of coffee for my family and friends. Thank you to the hotel staff for their friendly help and care. My family is an elderly person, so I don’t understand many things. I would like to thank the hotel staff again for their careful teaching on how to use the bathroom shower. They also use the coffee machine and are helpful and courteous. And when I saw friends visiting me in the evening, I also gave them extra desserts. Thank you again. The hotel service is first-class, but the room facilities are really old. It can be seen that the stage is made of ordinary wooden boards with white paint. The level is not similar to the facilities used in five-star hotels. It is really poor. Somewhat disappointing.
Fortunately, the hotel staff were friendly and courteous and provided first-class service, which made up for the dilapidated hotel facilities and poor room layout.

msg:The location of the hotel is relatively far from the Canton Tower, and it is a bit remote from the Canton Tower. You can only see the tower when you look at it. In terms of cost performance, there is really no need to stay in the room to view the tower. On the contrary, the hotel is in Huacheng Square, which is an excellent location for viewing and taking pictures of the busty people. The hotel is also very close to the subway. It takes only 3 stops to reach the bottom of the tower.
Therefore, I chose the right hotel when I went to Guangzhou this time. The service was good in all aspects. You can have breakfast at the top of the tower and enjoy a 360-degree view of various nearby landmarks. When I came back in the evening, customer service Xiao He also brought two boxes of sesame paste, which was very warm as it happened to be the fifteenth day of the first ***** month.
One thing I'm not too satisfied with is that the house price is so expensive that it's almost catching up with Atlantis. There are actually charges for drinks in the refrigerator. The five-star and even some four-star hotels I've stayed at are free. Scan the QR code to see the price, and it's 40. Yuan for a can of Coke, the price is outrageous. Which one point is deducted? I'll give it 5 points, but one point will be deducted for the facilities?

You need to go to the 22nd floor and transfer to the elevator to get to the room. As a nominal five-star hotel, Coke and Sprite are charged 40 yuan per can. It's out of style and the room is not well soundproofed. The leak in the bathtub is somewhat broken, the bathtub is too dirty, and the bathroom is terrible😅. For such an expensive house price, in addition to the location, you also need to be strong.

After checking out the next day, a call from a so-called manager came belatedly to apologize. In addition, even if this is not the case, the hotel facilities are old and poorly ventilated, and the room layout is extremely unreasonable. It is really a shame for the Grand Hyatt brand.

There is a subway just 200 meters downstairs, which is great. There are 8 subway lines in Guangzhou, so traveling is really convenient. Going to the high-speed rail airport is no problem. Go downstairs and walk 100 meters to Huachenghui. You can see the Canton Tower in the distance. The green walk is very comfortable. It is also close to the central business district, so shopping is no problem. The breakfast in the hotel is really good. It is worthy of a gourmet hotel. There are shrimp dumplings, wonton noodles, xiaolongbao, Chinese and Western food. It reflects the characteristics of Guangzhou. It is very important to me that it is steaming hot❗️
The room is large and the night view is beautiful. If we stay together, the cleaning is not thorough and needs improvement. It is not very convenient to go up and down the stairs. The lobby and restaurant are on the 22nd floor. There are two elevators. One is from the first floor to the 22nd floor, and the other is from the 22nd floor to the guest rooms. This means that every time you enter or exit, you have to change elevators through the 22nd floor.

After parking my car, I had to go to the first floor via the ferry staircase and then transfer to the elevator to the 22nd floor to enter the lobby. When I checked in, the receptionist didn’t even say hello. Don't speak until you have a deposit in hand. Only banknotes can make the waiter of your hotel open the gold mouth? ? ? Not to mention the deposit of 2,000 yuan. Even if breakfast is not provided, the service of Marriott Group and Intercontinental Group next door is much better than this.
The layout of the room is also strange among the hotels I have stayed in. The bathtub in the bathroom is actually square. Fortunately, the space is not too small, which may be the only remaining advantage.
I don’t know if the hotel’s air conditioning was adjusted intentionally by the hotel, but it’s only 8 degrees! ! ! Unfortunately, we only found out when we got up the next night. Then both of us had colds and high fevers. All we could say was that we thought we were unlucky.
The check-out time is also stuck at one o'clock. All the hotels I have stayed at before have not checked out until two o'clock. This hotel is special. I can only say that the Hyatt Group is awesome. I will not stay at any hotel under your group next time. It’s a hotel, no value for money at all.

msg:I took my elderly family members on a trip and booked two rooms. Generally speaking, the room facilities were okay. You can see your slim waist in one room, which is pretty good. But I don’t know why the room temperature is always at 24-26 degrees. It’s useless to adjust the air conditioner temperature to more than ten degrees. It always feels very stuffy. The old man is afraid of trouble and has always been uncomfortable. Didn't say. The other room had a very comfortable temperature.

msg:The location of the hotel is good. Huacheng Square is not far away. There are several large shopping malls nearby, which are convenient for shopping and dining. You can also walk around Huacheng Square and take photos of high-rise buildings and slim waists. You can reach the Asian Games Square in a few minutes' walk. I have stayed in the hotel several times and it is generally good. I have also reviewed it. But this time I returned to the room at night and found that the air conditioner was not heating, so I called the housekeeping depar**ent. The young man who came to fix the air conditioner was very kind. If he couldn't fix it for the time being, he took the initiative to call the front desk to help us change rooms. The suggestion given by the front desk was to move to a lower floor or put a heater. He also proactively suggested putting a heater, which was really good. But throughout the whole process, the hotel management didn't even call to inquire about the situation. I didn't expect that the management level of a hotel of this level is so cold.

msg:The room was as good as ever. It's also well maintained. It's just that the front desk service is really bad!
First of all, my three distinguished guests checked in separately, assuming that I had already paid on Ctrip. One of them checked in instantly, but the other two guests were struggling with the deposit at the front desk. Later, they did not need to pay a deposit because they needed to open the account if the account was hung up. But why didn’t my first guest have this problem and he didn’t pay a deposit? What are your front desk standards? ?
Secondly, I called and asked to check out at 2 o'clock. The girl who answered the phone said coldly and said no. No wonder people say that Grand Hyatt is very good now. Nowadays, most hotels have already checked out at least 1 o'clock. 2 o'clock is also normal. I said I was a member, and she checked for 3 minutes before saying I was an ordinary member. I said I bought your family's housing and dining membership rights for several years, so how could I be an ordinary member? If the hotel is clean every year, at least there will be records, right? The girl even said coldly that our members don’t have to pay for it. All my previous money was wasted on my relationship? In a hotel across the river, even if I haven't stayed in a hotel for a long time and haven't purchased membership rights, they can still help me delay check-out until 4 o'clock. The most uncomfortable thing is that this woman exhales into the microphone while talking. It's uncomfortable to listen to her talk. Your front desk has no training in answering the phone?
In short, Grand Hyatt is getting worse and worse!

You can walk or run downstairs: you can walk directly from the garden to the Pearl River and Haixinsha Island. This island is very beautiful and was the venue for the 2008 Asian Games. The hotel's service is also very good. The price of the hotel is also very affordable. Shopping near the hotel is also very convenient, as is eating. It is also very close to the subway station: Zhujiang New Town Station, and it is easily accessible in all directions. I often stay here when I come from Hong Kong for business, and the hotel's swimming pool and gym are also very good. Especially for people who like running, the Huacheng Huihui downstairs is simply wonderful. You can run all the way to Ersha Sports Park and run along the Pearl River. It's wonderful. Moreover, the hotel manager-Liao Yu KODY's service is very good. ￼

msg:There are many five-star hotels in Guangzhou to choose from. I booked this hotel because I liked the hotel because it will be newly renovated in 2021, so the environment and hygiene will be more assured. The decoration is my favorite style, the blue and white tones are very refreshing, and I like the plaid carpet in the room haha. The front desk check-in is located on the 22nd floor, but you don't have to drag your luggage up there. The concierge will help with it. I must praise the guy for being handsome and enthusiastic, and his service attitude is very good. It's a pity that I arrived late that day, and the rooms were full on weekends and I couldn't upgrade the room type.

What I was dissatisfied with was that the front desk said that the invoice would be sent to my email when I left the store, and I also took a photo and left the tax number. However, I did not receive it when I went back. I called the front desk and checked for a long time. I waited on the phone for a long time before I received it. I was told that the staff forgot to open it and asked me to open it on WeChat. To be honest, as a five-star hotel, such negligence is very inappropriate and I am very dissatisfied!

The front desk clerk said it was very quiet. As a result, I could hear every sound from the road in the room early the next morning. There was a sound of a car running over a metal belt, and there was demolition and decoration work on the downstairs floor starting at 10 o'clock. It was a very bad stay.

msg:The second time I stayed at this hotel, my experience was much worse than when I checked in three years ago: First, the service. Except for the concierge guy who was pretty good with a warm and professional smile, the service staff at the front desk and breakfast room had no smiles or warmth at all. It felt like I just love the attitude that I can’t live here: I asked the front desk to upgrade to a room because the room price when I made the reservation was higher than the room price that day. I wanted to stay for three more nights and it was my second time staying in this hotel. The front desk casually said that it was fully occupied. , I couldn’t upgrade, so I called up Ctrip.com, and there were many room types that could be booked. The two people at the front desk murmured for a long time that they were being upgraded to a VIP room but would not enjoy the relevant benefits. Entering the guest room, the bedside phone is broken and cannot be dialed by pressing any button; the shower head has no hot and cold markings, and there are no top shower and handheld switching markings; the iron is broken and cannot be used at all; the water in the wash basin is extremely slow and blocked. The guest room was not cleaned in a timely manner. When I returned to the room at almost 4 o'clock in the afternoon, it was not cleaned yet. The quality of the breakfast is good and the variety is rich, but the service is cold. The poached eggs are placed very far away and cannot be reached without asking the chef. The chef often turns his back to the guests and the soy sauce is sometimes missing. After having breakfast for two days, the receptionist questioned that she saw only one person having breakfast. All in all, this experience was very poor and I will no longer consider staying at this hotel in Guangzhou in the future.

It is also suitable to take a taxi to the scenic spots. The surrounding shopping malls are convenient, and there are many dining options a few hundred meters away. The express delivery box set at the entrance of the hotel is very convenient. The room is spacious and belongs to a five-star hotel chain in the CBD area with high cost performance. Walking downstairs, you can see Xiaomanyao. If you are close, you can cross the Jiangjiang with just one subway stop. The geographical location is unique.

I booked a basic twin bed, but the bed was very narrow.
The movement of the room is very confusing, as if it is migrating for the sake of migrating, which makes no sense.
All switches and sockets are below the horizontal line of sight, and you even need to squat down to find them, which is as blurry as the moving lines of migration.
I don’t know what the designer was thinking!

Sanitation: The sanitation is good, but the room smells a little damp.

Facilities: After all, it is an old hotel, and the facilities are quite satisfactory.

Environment: Most of the comments on the Internet say that the layout is relatively scattered. In fact, it is acceptable in the field. If you have a sense of partition and put your luggage in the cloakroom, you will find that the actual moving line is the cloakroom, washroom, bathroom and then around the bed. One week, finally to the toilet part. Generally speaking, it is possible, but it is not necessary haha.

Service: The service of the Regency Club is very good. I give the front desk of the Regency Club and all the staff a thumbs up. The environment is also very quiet and private, and the view is very good. The breakfast in the executive lounge is simpler than that on the 22nd floor.

The overall hotel has a strong sense of art, and it will not look outdated after ten years of opening.

After calling guest services, the master quickly came to the room to deal with it (the plug needs to be completely restarted; the master said that because there is no switch for the two lights, he can only turn off the main switch first, and then turn on the lights one by one). Other responses are also very fast, such as adding quilts, toothbrushes, etc., and the waiters are also very warm and polite. The buffet breakfast and lunch are fresh and rich. The water quality of the swimming pool is good, divided into cold, hot, and ice pools, and the hot pool has massage. All in all, the stay was a great treat. My granddaughter asked me to give this hotel a five-star review, even if there is less than one star.

msg:This time when I came to Guangzhou on May 1st, the price of hotels generally increased. Compared with the increase of Grand Hyatt Guangzhou, it is conscientious, at most about 50%. Other five-star hotels in Zhujiang New City have doubled... I stayed at Grand Hyatt Hefei before. , Very new, I was a little worried before staying in Guangzhou Grand Hyatt after reading online reviews, but after checking in, I found that the rooms and some sports facilities are well maintained, not very old. The hotel's Regency Club breakfast is also good, I recommend Eggs Benedict. Next to the hotel is Huacheng Square, and it is very convenient to travel.

msg:Overall experience is average

1: The elevator route is a bit convoluted. To check in, you must first go to the lobby on the 22nd floor and then return to the guest room on the 13th floor. Every time you go out, you have to go to the 22nd floor to transfer.

2: The layout of the room is unreasonable. It is arranged in the room at the end of the corridor. The functional areas are divided very scattered. In fact, the designer does not seem to have handled the floor plan well for the large area.

3: The level of customer service really needs to be improved because I was not very satisfied with the layout of the room at the end of the corridor. I called the front desk and asked to change to other rooms. The customer service attitude was blunt and they replied that all layouts were the same and could not be changed.
Well, this strange room type will make people sleepless until three o'clock

But should I say why you have to go upstairs to check in, and every time you go up and down, you have to take the elevator to the lobby to transfer?

The garden view room has been upgraded, and the large public garden is outside the window. Because of the birthday, the hotel sent a small cake, tied a towel, and a note without the guest's surname. Didn't even see a small fruit plate. I didn't feel much sincerity, just following the process. Anyway, the room fee is almost 1500, I feel that I will not come again.

As an executive lounge, Regency Club has really good food, surpassing many Marriott hotels.

The room facilities for more than 1,000 yuan a night are similar to those of ordinary business chain hotels. Breakfast costs more than 200 yuan. The key is that it was booked outside at around 4 a.m. The roar of the big car was so noisy that it was deafening and I couldn't sleep at all. The lobby is on the 22nd floor. The hotel is on the 4th floor. The hotel does not have its own parking lot. The key to stopping the car is to make a mess. This is not a simple hotel, it is actually a business office building with sound insulation. The effect is very poor and the hardware facilities are not good! Guangzhou gave me a very bad experience! Bad review! I will never stay at this hotel again!

msg:I have always liked Grand Hyatt in Guangzhou. Recalling when the hotel first opened, the sky lobby and the innovative room layout had a big impact on me. More than ten years have passed, and these design things are no longer fresh, but I am very pleased that the rooms are still so well maintained, the equipment is also upgraded and adjusted according to operational needs, and the breakfast is still so delicious. Continuous high-quality operation is the most valuable part of the hotel, and the hotel that knows how to treat its own facilities knows how to treat guests well.

A little unpleasant feeling is that I booked the Regency Club room this time, and arranged a room on the 16th floor instead of the Regency Club floor above the 17th floor. Even the door card does not have the authority to open the floor of the Regency Club, which feels a bit tricky.

msg:I specially chose a tower view room on New Year's Eve. The service is good and the bed is comfortable. I feel that the design of the room is not bad, the toilet is separated from the shower room; the cloakroom shower room is separated from the bedroom; it is more convenient to use with children or family members, and the two parts are very spacious. The service of the hotel staff is also very good, the guidance and response are relatively timely, and the smiles are all over the face.
Disadvantages: 1. The facilities in the old hotel are inevitably outdated; 2. There may be fewer people on New Year's Eve, and the room details are not clean enough. During the special period, I would use alcohol wipes to wipe all the common areas of the desk and coffee table, but I found that the coffee table still has chili oil marks, and the glass of the desk is also wiped yellow, yellow and black. It has been carefully wiped for a long time. 3. The most uncomfortable thing is to take a shower after 11 o'clock in the evening. After being tired all day, I increase my aunt's temperature. As a result, when the water is turned to the hottest, the fart is warm, and the kind that is still cold after washing, alas. Thinking about Chinese New Year, plus tired and sleepy, I didn't bother to respond to the hotel.

msg:This is the worst experience in a hotel of the same level that I have been on business trips for so many years. It is so frustrating...
* Please help to take the takeaway to the room and push it three times and four times. Finally, I told you to sign a promise in the communication before I can deliver it. Once, twice. If you don’t know the hotel guests, don’t fool around like this.
* Asking to clean the room is also three reminders and four please come to clean
* It is very inconvenient to go upstairs and downstairs. You have to go up to the 22nd floor before you can go to other floors
* The breakfast is also very poor and does not match the star rating of the hotel at all
* The hotel facilities are also very bad (two people need to unscrew the faucet switch in the bathroom & the board on the head of the bed in the room for the first night is shaky)

I have seen it on the check-in floor and the Regency Club before, but I thought it was because the staff elevators have never been used.

The main switch turned off the lights from time to time. I had to go out of the bathroom to turn on the lights, and then go back to the bathroom to continue taking a shower. Unexpectedly, all the lights turned off again. I wanted to go out and turn on the main switch again. After doing this more than six times, I finally slipped and hit the edge of the bathtub, and the pain was so painful that tears were also marked! I would like to explain that I am 71 years old this year, an old man! What kind of service is this? After complaining, only a young man came to say sorry frequently, and there was no post-processing! I will not book this hotel again next time!

msg:Let’s talk about the room first: I live in Room 1720. Personally, I really can’t appreciate the beauty of this room’s design. When you open the door, you can see a marble wall from the ceiling to the floor. There is only the wall, and the flushing button of the toilet needs to be ******. The small washbasin next to it reminds me of the bathroom on the high-speed rail, and the mirror of the washbasin is rotatable, but it is not easy to stop it at an angle that is convenient for use. The weather was not cloudy during my stay. It rains, so every day when you open the door and enter the room, you can always smell a little bit of damp

Let’s talk about the cafeteria: the chef who made the omelette for the first breakfast asked him for a xxx omelette, he looked up at me and didn’t say anything. I’m not sure if he heard it or not, but he gave it to me But the foreigner at the table next to me delivered the egg rolls ordered to his table by the chef himself I directly asked a man who came behind me what you want and immediately made it for him. Then a lady came and asked for a bowl of small wontons. The chef also made it for her immediately before condescending to make noodles for me. don't say a word the whole time
So I didn't go to breakfast on the third day either. It depends on my face when I have a meal. It's really rare.

This hotel was recommended by my friends in Guangzhou. I went to Shenzhen first and stayed at the Shenzhen Four Seasons Hotel. The gap is too big. There will definitely not be a next time

msg:Grand Hyatt has always been a mediocre brand. The hardware is just so-so. This Grand Hyatt in Guangzhou is the one that looks more like a budget hotel.
Service!!! Atella, the front desk, seems to be an intern, is amazing! I arrived at the hotel a few minutes before 11 o'clock, and she said that the room had not been scanned (understandable). I said that I would be in a hurry if I called, and I could wait somewhere. This girl recommended the VIP Club with a higher price, but I refused. Since then, we have been enemies, and this hotel front desk has never paid attention to me again. I asked when the latest check-in time is, but I don't know. Can I use the reserved room number to go online for a meeting first? No, can I arrange it in advance? No... After waiting for more than one o'clock, I directly contacted Ctrip to check out and not stay. The Ctrip girl was very helpful and quickly checked and told me that it was ready. I was very angry and asked Atella why she didn't inform me that the room was ready, knowing that I was anxiously waiting next to her? ! The girl lied with her eyes open-she said she just saw it.
However, when I returned to the room after the quarrel, I found that the luggage had been delivered to the room long ago, which means that she had already informed the concierge depar**ent that my room was ready, but she lied with her mouth and teeth and said she just saw it! Hotel service is a noble and delicate industry. How did such a person who has problems with basic character and habitual liars get in? Not only did he not solve the guests' problems, but he also added drama to increase the guests' difficulties. Are you here to run the hotel or to engage in palace fighting? You don't even have the basic service concept and professional beliefs, and you enter a hotel that is at least a five-star hotel to cause trouble? 
It's really a shame for the industry!

msg:The R&F Grand Hyatt Hotel, which is close to the company, has a general evaluation and a low price/performance ratio. Maybe this price is due to the good location:
About the facility:
1. There is no charging socket at the bedside, you need to probe under the bedside table and unplug the room landline wire to charge;
2. The light switches in the room are very messy, there is no master control condition, only one master switch, and the bedside lamp has only a switch, and there is no button to adjust the brightness;
3. The drainage in the bathroom is very poor, and the floor drain is very shallow. If you take a bath for a little longer, overflow will occur;
4. The B3/B4 parking lot downstairs is shared with the Infinitus Center next door, most of the parking spaces are in the Infinitus Center, and the hotel parking spaces only get more B4
About the service:
The hotel service is still good, the slippers and other things that need to be sent by the hotel are delivered in less than a minute, and the check-in is also very fast

msg:The epidemic has been boring for 2 years, think about it or go out to walk the baby. I happened to have something to go to Guangzhou, so I took the opportunity to spend a two-day holiday here.
R&F Grand Hyatt is an old five-star hotel in Zhujiang New Town. The rooms are refurbished. We have upgraded the city view room for us with children. We live quite comfortably, and the cleaning work is also in place. The room is cleaned twice a day, and the details are OK . The deepest feeling is...
1. The best thing here is to eat~eat~eat. It is extremely convenient. Huachenghui, AutoNavi, Kingstown International, IFC, and K11 are all nearby. You can basically find all the chain restaurants you can think of. Lots of local specialty stores.
The products of the hotel restaurant are also very good. There are many choices for breakfast. The most important thing is that the products are very good. Ctrip has a set meal with a semi-buffet dinner, which is actually more cost-effective than a single room reservation. I struggled for two days, thinking that three buffet meals might not be digested by my baby before giving up.
2. If the Guangzhou city characteristic tour is your purpose of this trip, Zhujiang New Town is the best choice, and R&F Grand Hyatt is the five-star with the most cost-effective. In addition to the Pearl River Night Tour, there is also a sightseeing line 2 nearby, where you can take a double-decker bus to see the night view of the Pearl River New Town.

msg:The hotel service is not 5-star, communicated in advance to celebrate the birthday, will you prepare a cake? The operator's first sentence was, if you check in today, it will be too late today, so you have to arrive one day earlier. (It was early in the morning) I said no problem, just leave the store and get it, the other party is OK. As a result, the old man went to the front desk to check out and forgot to remind the staff, and finally did not get the cake. So far, I have not received a phone call from Junyue that the cake was prepared but not delivered to me. I don't know if the person who wired at that time didn't put the demand for the interior, or the system didn't, or there was a system but it was not seen, or it was actually prepared but it was found that it had been checked out. In short, no matter any of the above situations should not be a veteran five-star can appear. disappoint others.
At the same time, the children's facilities are lacking, which is more suitable for business, or friends who buy a package to play in Guangzhou.

The underground Huacheng Hui is full of various kinds of food, which can definitely satisfy the taste buds of foodies. And it is highly recommended to stay at the Regency Club. The happy hour in the executive courtesy lounge is very rich, and it’s dinner time! Finally, the grand praise is the breakfast. There should be few five-star hotels in Guangzhou that have breakfast comparable to R&F Grand Hyatt. It is not only rich in variety, but also extremely delicate. Even the oranges are peeled and peeled👍👍

msg:The signboard of Grand Hyatt can be said to be smashed to the limit. According to the supporting facilities and service level, the house price is worth at most 400, which is not worth a cent.
1. The TV in the room is from 20 years ago, and the picture quality is good;
2. The hair dryer is at the level of 100 yuan;
3. All the towels are wired, which caused my friend to think it was a foot cloth at first;
4. The concierge is useless. No one opens the door when you get off the bus. No one guides you to the front desk when you enter the hotel. No one presses the elevator. The entire first floor is as crowded as the train station hall.
5. The design is touching. First, you have to go from the 1st floor to the 22nd floor to check in, and then change the elevator from the 22nd floor to the downstairs to check in. I really don't understand what this is.
6. Whether it's day or night, you can't see the lobby manager, nor can you find a helpful staff member. The only thing you hear when you are waiting for check-in: "Miss, line up better, don't stand crooked."… …Listen to me thank you, Shuan Q, I really thought I was lining up at the train station to buy a ticket. That is to say, the 7-day hotel is better than you.
7. Ordering take-out cannot be delivered to the room. Such a large hotel brand has no food delivery robot and no service at all. You can call to ask for take-out. Not to mention how far-fetched this reason is, they are all five-star hotels, and other hotels can deliver them. Are there any safety issues in your case? Then he: "They can send it, we don't send it", and then he is more anxious than me to hang up.
If the hotel has no money and is cutting expenses in training employees, you should close down quickly. How can R&F make such a garbage hotel? Another R&F hotel is not far from here. It’s good, you really can’t learn study? ?
In short, I still blame myself for spending money to find guilt. If I can do it all over again, I would never choose this bad place, because I have never lived in the domestic Grand Hyatt. I have experienced the ultimate service many times in the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong Island. I think Guangzhou is not bad, who knows so. Hey.
If you must say something nice:
1. Although it is on the 7th floor, the room lighting is OK.
2. The toilet is independent, and it will not affect the people who use the shower. They can do their own work.

msg:The worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. Check-in took more than an hour. There was no staff reception during this period, and I finally checked in after complaining to Ctrip. After checking in, the bathroom in the room smelled like urine. It was very inconvenient to take a bath. The bathtub was as small as a piece of tofu. The toilet space is also very small. TV picture quality is stuck in the 1990s. The sound insulation effect of the room is even worse at night, and the footsteps of passersby can be heard. The hotel breakfast is even more difficult to describe. The restaurant is very small and there are very few varieties. This kind of hotel is actually located in the city center and is known as the benchmark of five-star luxury. I really can't complain.

msg:You are here on business, I personally don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the price. The location is very good, right next to Xiaomanyao, but maybe the room type is wrong, and I don&#39;t see a moving moon view. There are many office buildings opposite, so if you want to see You can&#39;t see the one with the view. You can see a lot in the office building. In addition, I think the service is also average. When we checked in, the service staff who stayed in the customer had a general attitude. The front desk was on the 22nd floor, and the guest room was on the floor below. We are on the eighth floor and breakfast is on the 22nd floor, so the best view is at the front desk and breakfast. The view of the room is very general. The breakfast may also be due to the epidemic. I think there are many areas that are not open, so the variety is also I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s used for without a bathtub in the room. It&#39;s a small square bathtub. You can&#39;t lie down. The layout of the room is also quite strange. The center console is very confusing to wash hands. Personally, I don’t think the service and quality are worthy of this price. This hotel also charges for a few bottles of Coke and water, which I don’t really understand.

In addition to the bad scenery, we only have dim sum + soup noodles here. We can't take the dim sum by ourselves, we have to cover it in a pile In the steamer (which means that unless you open the lid of the hot steamer, you don’t know what is inside), we asked the chef to put the dim sum in the cage for us. It’s very stingy, and it’s not a whole cage but a separate one, because you will be asked if you want it. several. Then, if you want to get all the rest of the meals, you have to go around a U-shaped circle to get them. The other end has a lot better view and eats a lot more. The key is that almost all the tables are empty, and only one table is very abrupt. There was a middle-aged man sitting there, wondering if it was a VIP. The view of the room is also no, it is facing the Kingsun Building or something. Anyway, it is a big white building with a bunch of windows. I knew that I would add an extra 100 to book a garden view room. I went to the executive corridor at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, except for drinks Nothing else, not even fruit, confused.

msg:I have stayed in so many hotels, and this experience is the worst. Came here with my girlfriend specially for the anniversary and booked a room at the Regency Club, but the Regency Club is very embarrassing in terms of service quality and catering quality. Check-in not only did not give a welcome letter, but also did not introduce the basic benefits. The first time I came here, I didn’t quite understand the nature of this lounge. It turned out to be completely self-service, so from the very beginning, there was no greeting and no leadership seat. Compared with other guests, we were treated as transparent people throughout the whole process. , makes us feel very unwelcome, like a great grievance. Dinner was around seven o'clock, and there were quite a lot of people, and there were few varieties and quantities of food. What I eat is steamed dumplings, steamed buns, and no sushi salad. It looks like a convenience store style. The breakfast is relatively rich in variety, but some things are not made up, such as Qiandao sauce. . .
The room was simply furnished, and it was clearly said in advance that it was an anniversary, but the card said Happy Birthday, anyway, this is still a wish, but the cake was delivered, and the two of them only had one set of tableware, which I didn’t understand very well.
Because there is no show room, and some of the room's design is not very reasonable, so many facilities and equipment in the room are very inconvenient to use, so we have to call at 1 a.m. to ask the Guest Service how to wash the sink. I don't know if the sound insulation of the room is not good, or if someone knocked on the door, I was woken up at 6 in the morning.
Seeing that there is a five-star sign hanging on the door of the hotel, but the staff at the door are playing with mobile phones and chatting together. ? The conversation is also frowned throughout the whole process. What about the most basic service with a smile? If the pressure is too high, the hotel management needs to pay more attention to the physical and mental health of employees!
Before checking out, I tried to actively respond to the above check-in experience through the Guest Service. They said that they would pass it on to the colleagues of the Regency Club, so they handed in the room card and checked out. We also sat for a while, but no one came to give a statement.
In the end we really didn't like our IDs being handed back face up. Maybe Mandarin Oriental and other hotels have given us too much, so we have such high fantasies about your hotel. All in all this was our first and last time choosing a Hyatt hotel.

For breakfast, I want a glass of water, I agreed, but It hasn't arrived for half an hour. 3. The room card and the sign with the word "dining" are clearly placed on the breakfast table. I walked away to pick up the meal. When I came back, the seat was occupied, but the waiter was not in place at all. 4. Water This is how the plastic bags are given to the guests. (You must know that the Grand Hyatt is 5 stars) Not to mention other more episodes, both in terms of room layout and service, it is far from 5 stars. A very bad stay experience.

If I have to say the disadvantage, it is a bit inconvenient that every time I go in and out of the hotel to the street, I need to transfer the elevator twice. There is only reception service in the lobby on the first floor, and check-in is on the 22nd floor. This design is a bit mythical.

msg:This is the most unsatisfactory 5-star hotel I have stayed in so far, because this hotel is very close to where we want to work, so I chose this one. It was only later that I found out that it mainly entertains business guests, and is very unsuitable for families with children.

First of all, there is no environment in the hotel, the best view should be the front desk (the front desk is on the highest floor, all rooms must go to the front desk and then change the elevator to go downstairs), you said that the cheapest room type I booked certainly has no view , Well, I admit it, anyway, I go out most of the time, I only go back to the room when I go to bed, and the scenery doesn't matter.

But the sound insulation of the hotel is too bad. It was after 1 o'clock in the middle of the night, and there were voices from the next door and "applause" 👏! ! ! Then in the morning there was the sound of construction starting on the street outside. I thought it was at least 8 o'clock. Look at the clock, it's more than 6 o'clock, 6 o'clock, 6 o'clock! ! ! ! !

Furthermore, the room type of this room is very strange (I was too lazy to take pictures at the time, so I only took one), it was the first time I saw that the washbasin was so separated from the toilet and the bathroom, and the washbasin in the toilet was very small, guaranteed. Water splashes out when you wash your hands. Look at the wash basin in the picture (rectangular and short), the children in the corners here are especially easy to knock on.

Well, you said that I chose the wrong hotel. This is a business hotel, and we happened to bring a laptop. The design of the desk and the socket are not reasonable! !

Finally, let’s talk about the service. The front desk includes the temperature measurement staff downstairs and the concierge staff outside (it feels like they are busy selling rice dumplings). I can’t say that they are rude, but it’s the kind that doesn’t have a smiling face, and the tone and expression make people feel cold. Does not meet the 5 star standard. Also, during the stay, it happened to be Children's Day. Don't say anything about gifts, not even a single candy or a happy Children's Day. I have stayed in many five-star hotels with my children, and there will be some small gifts when I check in. Not to covet this little thing, but that's part of the service presentation, right? (Again, if I tell them, they will give children toothpaste and toothbrushes, but this toothpaste is the same as adults! The children definitely don’t like this kind of spicy toothpaste, this is my first This is the case. In the past, if I used the hotel's toothpaste, it was fruit-flavored and suitable for children.)

Anyway, this is a big thunder, reminding family guests who take children out, this hotel is not suitable or not suitable!!!

Long story short. It's my worst hotel experience so far! First of all, the room setting is weird. Secondly the room is not soundproof. You can hear people next door talking at 1am and construction noise from outside at early morning like 6am!! The hotel staff weren't friendly either. It's nothing you expect from a five star hotel. And it's certainly not a child friendly hotel! Don't choose here if you're traveling with kids!!!
Overall, I’m very disappointed with Grand Hyatt.

The lady at the front desk also helped to upgrade the garden view, and the Huachenghui has a panoramic view. Then, the passenger elevator is independent, and the privacy and security are better. It is very good and the space is very spacious.
Besides, the room has a great sense of space. There are many mirrors, and then two panoramic glass windows. The beautiful scenery of Huachenghui is unobstructed. There are automatic shading curtains and screen windows, and it will not look sunburned or anything. The bedding is also very comfortable and I had a good night's sleep.
The buffet breakfast on the second day is very rich, the taste is also very good, there are many choices, it is worthy of being a gourmet hotel. Next time I have a chance to experience wow again...ji

I don't know if the hotel is doing group buying activities on weekends, and there are a lot of tourists.
The scenery outside the hotel window is quite good, but the overall feeling of the reception at the front desk this time is that it lacks experience and lacks warm service. Further training is required.

Master, I have been hearing about Junyue's food for a long time, and this breakfast really surprised me! There are not many kinds, but the essence is still there. The downside is that the service is not attentive enough. When we checked in, we knew that we had children, but we still did not provide children's utensils for us. My children did not wear slippers after showering.

Lobby: Standard 2-3 doormen, including double green code check.

Reception: The air reception desk is set up on the 22nd floor, and the restaurants are also on this floor. To meet the preferences of the guests, I will also ask if you mind the first and last rooms and the 14th floor. The details are well done. Secondly, it also met my request to check out at 3 pm, which is very humane.

Room: Impeccable, familiar bed, familiar environment, natural sleep quality is good.

Summary: Will definitely stay at Grand Hyatt again.

I booked a large bed that was more expensive at 1,000 for the night, and it was more than 700 during the day. The layout was very good when I entered. There's a problem. It's like a 300 or 400-dollar room. The quilt felt wet all night long. I could check out at 2pm, but at 2pm the lights were flickering, much like someone else had turned them off. It was turned on and off again, going back and forth at least eight or nine times. It was really scary. I, a girl, thought someone had come in, and I was so frightened that I called out who it was several times. It was really bad. If I checked out Just call me to remind you, or just turn on the light. It turns on and off eight or nine times, which scares people out of their wits. I don’t want to stay in a hotel that costs a hundred yuan. When I checked out and entered the elevator, water leaked, which made me turn around. It took me two laps to get on the elevator. The lobby is nice and well-done, but I really have no place to stay. This is my last choice.

msg:I took my family to Guangzhou to play and chose this one in Zhujiang New Town. First of all, let’s talk about the location. I really didn’t say that you can walk to Huacheng Square and Xiaomanyao. Next to it is Gaode Landmark, which is convenient for eating and traveling.
In terms of facilities, it is not new. The decoration of the lobby and public area is quite stylish and comparable to the grade. The decoration of the room is also modern, but the design of the bathroom is a bit confusing for the elderly. Genius is habit. The hygiene of the room is ok, after all, it is not very new. Although some details cannot be looked at too closely, the whole is OK. The bed was comfortable and slept well.
It is recommended to stay here with breakfast. The buffet breakfast is very good, the ingredients are very fresh, the variety is super rich, and the restaurant has an invincible view.
The only thing to complain about is the elevator and lobby design. Drive to the ba*****t and transfer to an elevator on the first floor to the lobby on the 22nd floor, and then transfer to another elevator to go down to the guest room, which is equivalent to taking three elevators if you drive back from the outside. It is a bit inconvenient to pull the luggage and push the old man in order to go back to the room. This design is indeed a bit puzzling.
In terms of overall evaluation, the price/performance ratio is good. If you want to live in a five-star hotel near Xiaomanyao in Zhujiang New Town, it is recommended here.

When checking in, the front desk has given a room with a better view and floor according to the remarks, and I am very satisfied. The interior decoration of the hotel is too old, the rooms are also very old, the room type is really a bit strange. There are many seams in the stone in the guest room, and the repair marks are obvious. Some details are really dusty and clean. The TV is the picture quality of 20 years ago. It is no exaggeration. It is recommended to replace it with a new network TV that can be screened by mobile phones. It is said that the restaurant at this Junyue restaurant is delicious, but if you just come to live and vacation, you don’t need to choose this one, the experience is too bad. The swimming pool is on the 24th floor, with three pools, two constant temperature + one soaking pool, the water temperature of the soaking pool can scald people to death. A little disappointed, as the Grand Hyatt brand, there is no maintenance in place.

🍃Environment: Located in Zhujiang New Town, there are Chris**as trees at the entrance and at the front desk, creating a strong festive a**osphere

🔔Service: I forgot to bring the charging cable after checking in. The hotel sent someone to deliver it to the room. It was very considerate. Check-in was quick. When checking out, just put the card in the box, which is convenient!

I have to mention that the breakfast at the Grand Hyatt is really top-notch. It is the richest I have ever had among so many hotels in Zhujiang New Town. It has Guangzhou dim sum and different types of coffee, which is very good.

One thing to mention is that the water pressure in the shower in the room is not enough, the amount of hot water is small, and the waiting time to adjust the temperature is long. It is not comfortable in cold weather. I hope it will be improved in the future.

Overall, the Grand Hyatt is a very cost-effective hotel in Zhujiang New Town and is worth staying at again!

2. The hotel lobby is quite distinctive (Figure 5 is the elevator on the first floor, the lobby is on the 22nd floor, and Figure 10 is the night view seen from the lobby). But sometimes I get a little dizzy...First go from the underground garage to the first floor, change the elevator to the 22nd floor, and then change the elevator to the floor where you live...Haha
3. The room is very large (thanks to the hotel for upgrading), clean and hygienic, the windows are large and beautiful, and the sound insulation effect should be good (quiet).
4. I praise the swimming pool changing room, the environment is good, the service is good, and the water looks clean. The gym has a wide field of vision.
5. Also like breakfast, American coffee is delicious, and the juice is freshly squeezed. The porridge is thick and the toast is crispy...well, it tastes good. The most intimate is the small card on the table (Figure 3), which avoids the embarrassment of being taken away in advance when one person has a meal.
Above, I give 5 points does not mean the best, but the price is really high.

msg:The National Day holiday service is as good as always
Because we are usually busy with work, most of the scenic spots on this big holiday have many people, high prices, poor service, and traffic jams, so we chose to hide in the city and come to the Grand Hyatt Cat to pretend to be on vacation for two days. Secretly discovered that many Guangzhou people also have this idea.
Breakfast is great
There are also a lot of Junyue people. Some things are served for breakfast and they are quickly finished, but the replenishment is fast.
Had the thickest and most flavorful bonito peanut porridge👏👏👏
The ladies at Jiabin Xuan are very polite and responsive. There are not many types of refreshments. But the replenishment is timely. Enough.
Our family went to Four Seasons last year and ran into a small sir family, but according to my conscience, the Grand Hyatt breakfast is better. The Four Seasons Executive Lounge has better refreshments and a better view of the high floors.
Grand Hyatt is considered the most cost-effective 5-star hotel in Zhujiang New Town

msg:Due to the time arrangement of the elderly, this hotel stayed for three nights, but divided into two orders. It took almost half an hour when we checked in. Then we went to lunch first and then came to get the room card, but the lobby manager at the front desk was too careful. , The waiter may not make it clear to the people after the shift. The room card was made for only one day, so the card could not be swiped the next day. Everyone in the Grand Hyatt Hotel also knows that the lobby is on the 22nd floor. After changing the elevator three times, I can only run upstairs and downstairs. In addition, the service at the Regency Club is not good, there are only three bottles of water in the room, and many people in the executive lounge have nothing to eat (far inferior to the executive floors of InterContinental and Sofitel). Then there is the swimming pool is too small! Too small! Probably less than 20 meters in length? Less than 10 meters wide? I could have a 25-meter pool, but I have to have a hot water massage pool next to it, alas! If you care about the pool of a five-star hotel, it is best not to live here. Objectively speaking, the hotel is very close to Huacheng Square, a few steps away, an absolute advantage.

Forget it, the air conditioner is too cold and I want to turn off the air conditioner. As a result, the air conditioner panel buttons have problems. I can’t turn off the air conditioner or adjust the temperature, and then let the master come to fix it. It’s already over 9 o’clock by this time, and it’s been done after ten minutes of repairing. Then at 12 o’clock in the evening, I have to turn off the lights and go to bed. As a result, the bedside lights can’t be turned off. The bedside light switch was broken. The master came to see and said that he would fix it for a while. He suggested to change the room, and then changed to the large room on the 17th floor, the large suite, and the air conditioning switch in the living room of the suite. There was also a problem with this switch. Bad, what kind of hotel is this, it's horrible rubbish

But the room is really small and very old. The placement of the bed is also very strange, but it does not affect the stay. The design is relatively old, so the layout is very strange. It feels like doors everywhere.
The restaurant tastes okay, not too expensive per person
There is a sign downstairs where you can take pictures. The kids have to stand there and check in.

The service is good and worth five stars, but the hotel has been in business for a certain period of time. Although the rooms have been refurbished, some hardware facilities still have a sense of wear and tear. During the stay, there will be noise from time to time during the daytime downstairs. To inform, call to ask that there is a written notice in the guest room, but I did not find where the notice was placed. Because I planned to stay for 3 days and didn't want to be awakened by the noise on the third day, the front desk also assisted in changing rooms, but it was inadequate. It is hoped that improvements will become better!

The only downside is that there are a lot of people for breakfast, and the dining table and chairs are slightly old, especially the soft bag of that chair. It should be replaced. Overall praise

It is recommended to cancel reservations like other star hotels, and do not waste resources on a first-come, first-served basis.

3 Fruits were urged twice before they were delivered.
4When placing the order, indicate the high floor. The front desk supervisor said that he had not received Ctrip's notice and that the high floor was being renovated.

*Service: We arrived at the hotel at 11 o'clock to check in. The front desk was a handsome boy. After checking the information, he told us that the original Grand Hyatt suite could be upgraded to a deluxe suite. The area was doubled. The whole hotel, including room service, dining, reception, etc., can be said to be attentive service, and all the staff are very polite.
*Facilities: Obviously it's a bit old, but the sanitation is great, including the stalls, the ground, and so on.
The only drawback: the cleanliness is still a bit lacking, including the air conditioning. People with a sensitive nose are the easiest to feel it. I see small hairs flying all day long. I guess the hotel knows about it, so they are equipped with air purifiers. room.
*Hotel breakfast: You can purchase an extra breakfast if you add 116 yuan to the guest room. There are not many choices for breakfast, but there are all you want to eat, and the taste is very good, the products are very meticulous, and the restaurant service is very good.
In conclusion, great staying trip, will come again next time

msg:The sound insulation is very poor! ! There was a suite opposite us, and many people were partying and playing loud music in it at night. We could hear it clearly in our room! It’s understandable that it was New Year’s Eve that night and everyone was excited and happy, but if the sound insulation is so poor, it’s disturbing the public, right? From night until two or three in the morning! There was a group of people running back and forth in the corridor! I called the front desk hoping to come up and check on the situation, but no one paid any attention! Probably the hotel doesn’t want to offend the distinguished guests in the suite! !
What’s particularly funny is that the hotel bar is on the same floor as the hotel lobby. The music inside can be heard clearly in the lobby. I thought it was someone singing K~
If compared with the Park Hyatt, there are very few breakfast categories ~

Check-in and check-out are almost no friends. The bathroom is large and two-way. And there are many of my favorite floor mirrors. However, it seems that there is a common problem in the old hotel in the city center. The ventilation is not very good. The location of the bed closer to the bathroom will be a bit damp, and the air conditioner should be fully activated. The location has nothing to say. Please enjoy the cbd view of Guangzhou city center. The night view of the city and the people jogging in Huacheng Avenue Park in the morning, you will feel that you are in New York.

msg:I have studied wine management for four years, and the word-of-mouth publicity for Hyatt in the industry is good. Today, I took my parents to check in for the first time. The various hardware and software problems I encountered were enough to make me feel that my four-year major was desecrated...
I don't know if the male receptionist at the front desk is nervous or because he is really sick. His speech is extremely stuttering. He downgrades my room night level and doesn't make up the difference. It takes more than ten minutes to check in, which is very unprofessional. doesn't count. The main reason is that when I enter the room, I find that this is the smallest twin bed (1.2 meters wide) I have ever seen in a hotel. Then the furnishings in the room are very dilapidated, the leather chairs are rotten, the walls are damaged... the glass windows outside have not been cleaned for a long time. The lighting is also quite dim, the height of the room is very low and depressing, and the overall physical feeling is a bit depressing. The glass in the bathroom is completely transparent, which is embarrassing! And when I took the shower, the iron paint on it fell off piece by piece! ! Dirty! !
A room night of almost 2,000 yuan, and the rhythm of a running competition with a 200 yuan hotel.
The next day I went to eat the buffet, and I waited in line for 20 minutes outside... There was almost nothing to eat when I went in, only a few small shumai and green vegetables, many of which were gone! !
From 23 o'clock in the evening to choosing a hotel until early in the morning, I carefully compared online reviews, prices, and locations. After many evaluations, I chose Hyatt. The result is still the same, so disappointed

Okay, I walked around and went up and down the elevator several times to get two bottles of juice to drink. Then in the morning, before I woke up, the hotel waiter brought the police and the police uncle to knock on the door and said that they wanted to arrest the **girl. This is considered insightful. **Your hotel** has all the people running around, saying that takeaways are not allowed? Is this in a third- or fifth-tier small city? Can the waiter lead the way and check it casually? It’s really a long time to see you.

其次，在整體早餐和客房服務上，沒有體現五星級的服務標準，既不熱情，也不周到，整體態度是冷冰冰的

設施：酒店很新，房間佈局新穎和有創意，配置的洗漱用品也很有品味。

衞生：衞生整體感覺還不錯，保潔人員也很友好，積極主動打掃衞生。

唯一不滿意的是酒店隔音效果不是特別好，跟户型也有關係，鄰居住了兩個女生非常吵鬧，休息很不規律經常後半夜會大笑大鬧的。因為房間離得很近，聽到噪音非常清楚。

除了客人問題，整體酒店的住宿感受極佳，打車方便，步行便利，周邊各種高檔商場辦公樓近在咫尺。特別好！

總而言之這個酒店和他的價格是完全不相符的，從酒店的服務態度到酒店的設施，基本上感受不到五星級酒店標準，以後不會再來。

缺點：整個酒店設計得奇怪，大堂在22層，每次進出必須先去22層換乘其他電梯才能進出酒店，囉嗦。房間設計奇葩，盥洗室是島，一進房門就是這個島，四周走路，迷糊。床是1米的，夠用，但長度短，不是2米長的床，少見。房間每次進入都能聞到潮氣，可能我這側朝向問題。總之缺點是設計太清奇。
整體而言性價比不錯，下次來廣州還會選擇

大堂在20多樓，然後入住的坐專用電梯再往下走，有點麻煩，因為進來和去外面得坐兩次電梯，都要回到大堂中轉。
早餐在幾乎最高樓，品類多，舒服，凱悦還是不錯。
雙人床這個居然是1米的床，睡覺都不敢翻身，確實沒想到，這點非常不值得推薦。

一些細節：
1. 國慶假期期間，酒店前台辦理入住的效率較低、速度較慢，導致前台客人堆積，部分客人意見意見很大（差點發生爭吵）；
2. 早餐不能穿酒店拖鞋進入（需要穿着正常鞋子入內）；
3. 一開始在沒有提前告知本人的情況下，安排了殘疾人房間，經撥打“0”電話投訴後更換到正常房間；
4. 床品不錯，非常舒服，睡得很香；
5. 酒店早餐不錯，種類豐富，吃得很爽。

🧹衞生：雖然衞生比大部分酒店都做得到位，很多如床腳的地方都有打掃到。但還有一些細節需要提升，如：放置浴帽化粧棉的託盤上發現了一根不明毛髮！雖然這些小東西不一定每次住房的客人都會用到，但希望收拾的時候還是能留意下有沒有異物吧。

2.酒店打印超過10張收費，一張黑白的五元，説實話國內外高檔酒店住過不少，頭一次遇到這樣的。很掉價。
3.服務態度和環境設施還不錯。

酒店是2013年開的，雖然有點老舊，翻新後還是乾淨整潔的。
🔔服務：不冷不熱，但是能做到有求必應。
早餐：很豐富。但是服務態度一般，冷冰冰。

以下是通過攜程訂到的行政雙床房。訂房間前特地跟攜程打過招呼儘量安排樓層視野開闊一點的房間。結果一看，還是這樣的房間。對面樓一直都有人在施工。白天都要關窗簾。

雖然我是金鑽會員，但感覺每次通過攜程訂的房間，都是些邊角房間或是景觀非常差的房間。入住感受一點都不好！

花城滙有APM線，可以去廣州塔，天環廣場
也可以從花城滙地下商場穿過去走幾分鐘到地鐵珠江新城站，3號和5號線，去天河城，太古滙，總之不打車的情況下，坐地鐵是也很是方便的。
然後到酒店房間，畢竟年限在，所以設施還是舊了點，雙床的床不大，房間還算整潔，建議酒店還是常檢查房間裏面的門，廁所與睡房間隔的玻璃門，門腳位置的鐵框都掉下來了，很危險。酒店24樓的泳池，要多注意清潔，挺臟的，有好多沉澱物。
酒店的工作人員服務態度蠻好的。
但酒店的早餐真的品種太少，不值！

行政酒廊的食物和環境都不錯，早餐品種和營養都很滿意。
強烈推薦！！！
唯一一個小小的建議，酒店飲用水的瓶蓋很難擰開，女生是不夠力的，男士們開得也頗費勁。

房間裏面洗漱區域彎彎繞繞的，又有不少鏡子，讓人有些暈頭轉向。

msg:不太好的住宿體驗。
首先，這個酒店的前台在22樓，本身設計理念蠻好的，希望能夠在一個風景好一點的地方辦入住。但是每次出入酒店，都要先坐電梯到22樓，繞過前台，再換乘另外一組電梯，不太方便。第一次辦理入住做一點花樣挺有意思的，但是為什麼不能把通向客房的房間，也在一樓開一個入口，刷卡直接乘梯到房間呢。如果覺得不安全，也可以在樓下在做一個簡單的前台。晚上點了一個外賣，被告知必須要在一樓去拿。如果是普通酒店，疫情期間避免外人進入，出去拿沒問題。但是這個酒店明明在設計上就存在住客下樓麻煩的問題，為什麼不能提供一下送餐服務，哪怕幫忙拿到前台，或者安排一個現在很普及的送餐機器人。給人的感覺就是設計很好，但是服務的設計上完全沒有從需求出發。

第二，酒店酒吧的調酒師水平太差，非常不熟練，調出來的雞尾酒也非常淡。

第三，吃早餐在餐廳門口，告知不能穿客房的拖鞋進餐廳，理由是餐廳是地板，很滑，擔心摔倒。住過這麼多酒店，這種嚴格的要求還是第一次見到。本身理由挺好的，擔心安全問題。但是你明明有很多解決辦法啊，比如在入住確認有早餐、或者拖鞋放置的地方，口頭或者放個卡片提示不能穿拖鞋去餐廳，或者在餐廳門口準備幾雙防滑拖鞋，給穿拖鞋的住客換一下。明明有很多解決辦法，非要讓住客麻煩，還是之前的觀點，服務上完全沒有從需求出發。

msg:君悦無論從餐飲，前廳，行政酒廊，客房都保持着高品質的出品和服務標準。
前廳和行政酒廊是入住主要打交道的地方，從辦理入住手續到退房，經理susan和wolfe都熱情高效地幫客人完成了手續，提前安排好車輛出場掃碼，為客人的行動節省了大量時間。還有peggy ，Monica rennee都在自己崗位上紮實地完成手裡的工作，特別是peggy，happy hour時間一直可以看到她辛苦地奔波於各個座位，熱情敬業讓人印象深刻。
22層西餐廳無論從經理Ellen. jerry，到jason Nathan jane都將客人照顧的特別到位，能夠盡餐廳所能滿足很多客人個性化的宴請需求，在此十分特別感謝。
另外入住期間還需提及前廳的caroline，leo，eva還有幾位叫不上名字的同事，每天早上路過都能夠得到他們熱情的問候，入住期間雖然因停車場物業管理處辱罵客人事件非常不快，但在caroline的及時上報後得到了酒店妥善的解決，維護了客人的權益，在此也特別感謝
