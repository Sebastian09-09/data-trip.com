msg:Good points: the staff are very friendly and helpful. 1 of them even offer to add wechat if we need assistance with booking Didi (taxi/car) or where to go to buy things/food for baby.
Bad points: in trip.com app mentioned there's steriliser for baby, but reach hotel they don't have at all. Trip.com also mentioned welcome drink, kids toiletries etc, there's none at all provided by the hotel. Trip.com should update the details & dont mislead customers. And our room is compact (see photo), not spacious at all like the pictures displayed in the app. We were given don't know what view is that (looks like back view of the hotel that facing some residents place) at level 7. 

Hotel doesn't switch on aircon when the weather outside is cold, hence we had to call concierge to help open the window. The room feels stuffy. We start to have some itchiness & redness after wake up from bed. Please check if your bed/bedsheet is clean. Overall, we are disappointed with the room.

It is too warm (around 28 degree) versus outside temperature (around 12 degree)and unable to adjust down . Although the hotel provided a cooling machine but it is not really helpful , later they suggested to open the window which is near to the road and it is noisy.

However, I was disappointed with one of the receptionist where she was not very patient and gave us an attitude when we asked for recommendation for places to visit. She just said there was a shopping street nearby and kept frowning at us. Other than her, the rest were all very welcoming and professional. The room is exceptional too.

Lack of communication coordination 
Midnight road construction next to hotel was not informed in advanced. Be prepared for it…

Housekeeping not up to standard 
Room amenities not refilled in time until requested. Used towel and hairdryers were not tidied up

I believed people stands the core of a hotel, warm reminder not to forget about people management while upgrading solely on hotel facilities.

Breakfast is amazing with a lot of choices and fresh. Great coffee/cappuccino too.
However croissants could be better, putting them under a heating lamp all morning is a mistake.(bakery owner here)
Room was close to the square meters they said it would be.
Only negative was the dirty showers near the swimming pool where mold was on the ceilings….

The simple and probably old renovation of the hotel respects this particularity, offering a correct comfort. The isolation is not optimum but I would not expect more from any other place in the town. 
We asked for the hotel restaurants and they gave us a coupon for one out (we’ve been there, it was really nice).
The choice of breakfast (between western and Chinese) is great.
Pickup service is perfect, very fast and convenient!!!
The staff, especially Bae, is very nice and helpful. 
Our train was cancelled and they immediately took care of us, giving a new room (a suite, very beautiful and comfortable).

At the beginning, I missed the room card to go to the executive floor. On the last day, one of the room cards was used. After breakfast, it was not yet 11 o'clock, and I couldn’t swipe into the room. I jumped up and down to the front desk to fix the card. I really want to complain about the front desk’s ability to handle things. What’s the use of checking in quickly? If it’s not done well, I always have to trouble the guests to make up the card again. I can’t even say sorry for causing you trouble. It’s speechless.

Small bottled water, does it cost money even if the price is not marked, or is there some other reason? ? (I stayed at the Universal Studios Hotel the night before I came to your hotel, and I didn’t ask for a deposit to drink as much water as I wanted)

msg:I decided to take my children to visit the Forbidden City nearby. The hotel is relatively new, with complete facilities and newer facilities. It is also hygienic, has a full sense of design, and has a rich breakfast.
Seeking truth from facts, the shortcomings are also fatal. There were several small flying insects in the room. After arriving at the store after ten o'clock in the evening, I washed up and found that the window handle was broken. I spent a lot of effort to close it, and then I found that construction was still going on in the middle of the night, and the tin tin frame kept ringing. It's not suitable for people like me who have trouble sleeping. Said it was a shame. The Qingming house price of 1,499 was not cheap, but I didn’t get a good night’s sleep. Great choice for light sleepers.
Furthermore, when I urgently needed to print a child's test paper, the front desk told me that A4 paper costs NT$15 and printing a test paper costs NT$60, which is a sky-high price. . . After giving up, I was told that I went out and turned right to a printing shop where I could print, but I couldn't find it after searching for a long time. . . This is not very friendly. Does the hotel need to use printing charges to make extra money?
Heartbroken 💔

I thought the view room could see Wangfujing Street, but I could only see the dilapidated residential area outside the window. I didn't feel the service of a five-star hotel at all. The bedding and environment are neither good nor bad. I don't recommend it.

The suite I booked was given a cake. The child said it was delicious after eating it. I couldn't help but call the front desk to ask if another one could be sent. The lady agreed and sent another one 😄, thank you very much. The room is also very clean. The only drawback is that there is no air conditioning in this season. It was too hot during the Qingming Festival. Fortunately, the window can be opened. Everything else is very satisfactory. Various drinks are replenished in time. The bed is very comfortable.

I chose to have breakfast on the 11th floor. I like the quieter environment. The food selection is not as much as on the first floor, but there are fewer people. The waiter is enthusiastic and the iced latte is of a high standard. I accidentally forgot my clothes in the restaurant and called to remind me to pick them up.

The location of the hotel is very, very, very good. It is on the north side of Wangfujing Street. Going south is Wangfujing Pedestrian Street. Opposite the hotel is Line 8 subway. Going south for three stops is Qianmen, and going north for one stop is Nanluoguxiang. Opposite is the National Art Museum of China, and there is a good roast duck restaurant around. The swimming pool is a little small, but the water is clean. The gym facilities are also sufficient.

I rarely write such a long review. My family had a great time staying here.

There are three subway lines around the hotel, which are within walking distance. The transportation is convenient. You can walk to Longfu Temple and Dongsi Street. There are more famous snacks such as Zeng Shengkui and Yin San Douzhi.
The rooms are spacious and the large windows are convenient for travelers to enjoy the scenery. The only drawback is that Beijing is too dry. It would be more comfortable if there is a humidifier. The lobby design is novel and a**ospheric, and the small art gallery on the first floor is very artistic and impressive. The screen wall of the gate is very Beijing-style, and the surrounding green plants are also very elegant.
The service staff is friendly and responsive, and will actively help solve any problems. It is a pity that there is no time to experience the restaurant and fitness facilities.

Disposable products are made of good materials and are in line with environmental protection ideas. Breakfast is okay, there are nuts and some Southeast Asian side dishes.
       Some suggestions: 1. Does the shower and bath share a door or is there just no door? Not only is it cold when taking a shower, but water is splashing out. It is only suitable for couples or couples to leave it completely open, otherwise it will be quite embarrassing. 2. Where can the clothesline be stretched? Just decoration. 3. I don’t know why the window in the room cannot be opened. The air conditioner automatically senses the temperature and makes me panic. Although the waiter brought an air cooler later, the sound was so loud that I couldn’t sleep. This is enough for me not to come back again.

msg:Stayed here for 2 of the 6 nights in Beijing
The hotel is more business-oriented and not very suitable for bringing children, but it is more convenient.
There are several delicious restaurants nearby, all within walking distance.
I recommend the Roast Duck in Sheng Funian. It seems that many locals will go there late. I queued up. I went there after 5 o'clock on Tuesday and there was just room for us to finish our meal. It was already three floors inside and three floors outside. They also give away candied haws. To be honest, this is me. The most delicious candied haws I have ever tasted. Nothing I bought with money is as delicious as this...
The Laohuaishu Barbeque recommended by Guan Xiaotong is just diagonally across the road. It tastes just like this. The a**osphere is good. I was lucky. I went there after ten o'clock and there was no queue. It was only five minutes away. The queue behind me was quite long. I recommend the shredded fried pancakes...
There's also Zeng Shengkui. Let's walk there for 10 minutes. The sugar pancakes are so delicious. The beef patties and doornail meat patties are both good. My husband likes mutton soup. Lots of mutton. Highly recommended!
I have a question about the hotel. It was my first time to stay in a five-star hotel that required parking fees. The front desk said that it would be cheaper if the hotel paid 80 per day. If I went in and out directly, it would cost 200+ per day. I decisively chose 80 per day, but I didn't expect that I would have to pay 7.5 when I left. I paid because I had to catch a train... When I called the hotel for a return visit that afternoon, I raised this issue. The hotel was also surprised and said that it should be 80 before 2 pm on the check-out day. They didn't understand how the 7.5 came, but the hotel was still positive. After dealing with the matter two days later, I was given welcome fruit and upgraded the room when I checked in...

When you go out, turn right and cross the road. It's Metro Line 8. Going further forward is Zeng Sheng Kui Snacks, and further forward is Yin Sandou Juice.
When you go out, turn left and you will find Laohuji Roast Duck about 100 meters away, FamilyMart about 200 meters away, Ziguang Garden about 600 meters away, and further on you will find the center of Wangfujing Street. In this direction there is also the Four Seasons Minfu Roast Duck.
The room was very warm and there was no need to turn on the air conditioner at all. The facilities are also very new. I booked two nights with Ctrip and stayed in the hotel for another night. There is nothing wrong with it except that it is expensive.

Disadvantages: 1. The door of the shower room is a disadvantage. No matter how you pull the sliding door, you can't avoid being seen by the people who live with you while taking a shower. Therefore, this special door may be for intimate couples or lovers, or for absolute trust. Designed by a friend, otherwise you can see everything at a glance. 2. Although the breakfast has a variety of varieties, it really tastes average. Let’s focus on the Thai salad. Not to mention that the vermicelli seems to be undercooked, where is the hot and sour flavor of Thai style? The taste is so bland, almost tasteless. Other dishes are also very average. But the service is good.

msg:Well, how should I put it, I believe the hotel is good, but the 623 rooms assigned to me are very problematic. I stayed for four consecutive nights because I spent the morning visiting attractions and sleeping at night, so I just wanted to be clean and worry-free. The only thing that is really annoying is that the soundproofing is very poor. I hear the clear sound of cars on the road every night, and the ghostly howling in the wind in the middle of the night. It is very disturbing, because I have two children and two big suitcases, and my wife is wooden. My ears told me not to worry about it, so I decided to endure it without changing rooms. Even my wife couldn't bear it on the last night, so she studied the windows carefully. Good guy, the tops of the two windows were uneven and air leaked. No wonder I said that besides the noise, the temperature inside was still not warm. My wife's fever should be related to this. Always said it was cold. In the end, there was nothing I could do. Calling didn't work, and even when the engineer came, he couldn't fix it. I asked him to bring a transparent tape and put it on myself. It was much better! When I finally checked out, I asked the front desk about my problem, and the answer I got was "Okay, I understand, Mr. I paid nearly seven figures for the room. This is the first time I have encountered something like this. It’s okay. I have a good temper, so I’ll leave a negative review. This is also the first time I’ve given a negative review. Please accept it.

The hotel services are warm and thoughtful. Like the guest relations red text, which can effectively solve our requests and respond quickly. The room service aunties are also very friendly and enthusiastic. The facilities in the room are acceptable, with star-level standard configuration. The environment is also cleaned. The hotel is okay when taking children out with the most emphasis on safety and hygiene. The hotel breakfast is also ok, quite satisfactory. But there are some minor flaws: there are no waiters at the hotel entrance, and the entrance feels rather stingy. In addition, there are only 2 elevators, so the wait sometimes takes a little longer during the morning hours.

I chose average service because I really didn’t feel at home. The door into the lobby is simple, undecorated, and very stingy. After entering, no one pays attention to you at all. It’s the same as where I stayed for the first two nights. Also in stark contrast to the five-star rating, there are some services that I think hotels need to provide, and guests can choose whether they need them (for example: taking guests’ luggage, a friendly smile, and the initiative to provide services), but they are not available here. , the hotel is a place where services are provided, and what is reflected in the lobby is the guests themselves.
Hotel facilities: only heating, no air conditioning. The manager on duty said that this is the case in all hotels in Beijing. What a coincidence🙄The hotel where I stayed for the first two nights gave me a choice for guests. After I mentioned it to the hotel, the solution was indeed the room. An air cooler was put in, but everything was quiet afterwards, with no return visit at all. After all, Renke expressed strong opinions on this matter, but there was no basic return visit. Only Renke took the initiative to contact the hotel to learn about the follow-up situation.
I write this review with all my heart, hoping that the hotel's service will be better improved in the future, giving guests a value for money and a home away from home experience.
by the way, the hotel’s Jiahe dishes are really delicious…😕

msg:My mother and I came to Beijing for a trip and chose Overseas Chinese Rui Shi from a wide range of choices. Sure enough, we made the right choice! The hotel has convenient transportation and can get around quickly. (You can walk to Wangfujing Business District) The internal facilities and rooms are very new. (Personally, I prefer newly renovated hotels) There are many kinds of breakfast in the hotel in the morning. Special praise should be given to several small places. One was when my mother was looking at her cell phone during breakfast, and the waiter was very considerate and gave her a cell phone holder, which was very heartwarming. The other was when she called the front desk on the day of check-out and asked for a few more bottles of water, which were delivered to her door very quickly (and four bottles of water were given to her). bottle). It is indeed a five-star hotel, thumbs up! !

msg:I went to Beijing for business and stayed at the Overseas Chinese Building Ruish Hotel. I decided on this hotel after choosing it over and over again. It really didn’t disappoint me at all. I have mysophobia and I have to wipe it before going anywhere. The result of this inspection was that except The rack on the back of the bed is a little dirty, but the rest of the place is really spotless. Thumbs up to the housekeeping depar**ent! Breakfast was very good. The hotel environment is also very good. It is a hotel with a strong artistic a**osphere. Opposite is the Guardian Art Center. 2-3 minutes walk to the left is the Capital Theater, the legendary People's Art Theatre. Further ahead, there is a FamilyMart with rich supplies. Opposite the FamilyMart is a It is a Beijing cuisine restaurant. I saw many Beijingers having dinner next to it, which is very down-to-earth. The concierge at the door was also very nice. When he saw the car, he came up to help with the luggage. He was not as indifferent as seen in previous reviews. The receptionist helped me upgrade to a room with a view of the CBD, so it became a great pleasure to drink tea by the bedside at night and enjoy the view. I drank too much tea and ran out of bottled water. After calling, a male waiter in the guest room came with a lot of water. I was really touched. All in all, my 3 days and 2 nights at Ruishi Hotel were very comfortable, smooth and fun! I will stay at the Overseas Chinese Ruishi Hotel when I come to Beijing in the future.

msg:This hotel is the worst five star hotel I have ever stayed in bar none. The service attitude is very, very poor. Please be careful. (Streaming version: No matter which episode you watch, you can feel the ridiculous service attitude, I marked them all⚠️) But it’s really a pity to miss this series.
1. First of all, because the room air conditioner can only provide unified heating and cannot cool down, I felt that the room was too hot to sleep, so I asked them to bring me an air cooler. Before bringing it to me, they must have opened the lid to confirm whether there was water and whether it could be used. The result! ! ! ⚠️The water in the air cooler that was brought to me was green and full of green plants (pictured). I used the green water that had been stored for I don’t know how long and the dusty air cooler to blow it all night. I know I discovered it the next morning when I opened the lid and added water.
2. Since I booked two nights at once, my first requirement was that I still didn’t want to move around, so I chose to complain, hoping they could give me a good solution. But from the first customer service person who answered the phone to the second manager to the third salesperson, no one had a good attitude and no one spoke the truth. The plan the manager gave me was to give me a preferential price if I extended my stay on the third day. They couldn't give me any compensation for these two nights. I asked if I didn't extend my stay, would the matter be over? She said no, and I said what should I do? ⚠️Then the manager hesitated and couldn't answer. It's really ridiculous that such a thing happened in a five-star hotel and there was no compensation plan.
3. Then the salesperson called and said that if I renew for the third night, the price can be 200 lower than the price on the app. I asked what about my second night? I was easier to talk to on the first night and let it go if I stayed there, but if I didn’t solve the problem on the second night, you want to extend my time to the third night? ⚠️He said that this room type was not available for the second night and he could not give it to me. I said that I had just checked the app and this room type was obviously sufficient. After saying that, I called and clicked on it again, and then the sales person was silent again. I am speechless. He said that I am a sales person anyway, I just give you discounts, and don’t care about other things xxxxxx (I can’t live with you anyway, that’s what I mean) ⚠️ Then I hung up the phone and found out two minutes later that this hotel had immediately removed all room types on the app .
At this point, something that was originally a small matter has already made me very angry.
4. Then we communicated about five or six times in the end, and I said forget it for the first night, and we have to agree on the price for the remaining two nights (because I really want to stay in Beijing for one more day, but I want to save trouble and don’t want to move, and I also want to They give an explanation). ⚠️Unexpectedly, the manager called and made a joke. I asked the director of the reservation depar**ent (I forgot what the depar**ent was called specifically) and the lowest price he could give me was only 100 yuan per night cheaper than the one on the app. I said, isn't this funny? An ordinary salesperson can give me a discount of 200. You said that after asking around, you finally asked the director and the best price he got me was only 100 cheaper? Don't you check the caliber? Now she started to explain randomly again, saying that each depar**ent is different, maybe sales has its own strategy balabala... I also told her about the ridiculous conversations in sales and asking people to download all room types in the hotel on the app, ⚠️The manager said It didn’t happen, and a few minutes after the manager and I finished talking on the phone, it appeared on the app again...
5. In the end, the communication broke down. After I went to the front desk to extend my stay, the manager said to me, just charge 600 for the deposit. Anyway, I don’t think you will be charged... The tone was also very bad (this is purely There is nothing funny about looking down on people)
Summary: If you want to experience the service, don’t come here. There was only one floor manager who apologized to me. The others were really gone. I swear there was no exaggeration. Everyone in Beijing was very enthusiastic, no matter if it was one of the previous ones. The service staff of Universal Hotel are still the staff of Universal Studios, Didi drivers or waiters in every restaurant. Only the staff of this hotel have ruined the quality of hotel service staff.

The room is small, like a budget hotel, but the materials are of higher quality, so the stay is comfortable. Opposite is the National Gallery, so I took advantage of the last day to go shopping.

msg:There are problems with the design and sound insulation of the sewer pipes in the hotel. As long as someone in the next room opens the bath water, it will be as noisy as in your room. It is a very scary sound. Unfortunately for us, we were woken up by the room next door taking a bath two or three times in the middle of the night. I recorded a video but it seems difficult to post it. The room I was given faced the construction site. Construction was going on in the middle of the night. There was a lot of banging and banging. The glass was not soundproof at all. The sound of cars whizzing by on the road was clear. It was a painful night. I asked for it the next day. We changed rooms, but when we went back at night, they moved us to a smaller and worse beggar room. The hotel said it was the same room as before. The front desk was lying. We went back very late and didn't bother to talk anymore. The soundproofing was the same as the previous room. It's bad. It's just that it's not facing the road. It's a little better. Although the hotel is five-star, there is no doorman. There is no one to help with luggage or call a taxi. The breakfast taste is not good. I stayed at the Jingshan Hotel next door for the first two nights. It's not far away. The Forbidden City is closer and the service is very good. I can’t compare to this hotel because there is no bathtub in the room. My legs were tired from walking and I wanted to take a bath so I moved here. However, I slept worse than death for two nights. I went out to play during the day in a very bad state and the front desk service was also very poor. Poor, not recommended

The corridor was very noisy on the first day of my stay, and it didn't stop until about two o'clock in the middle of the night. , I had no choice but to change rooms the next day. Unexpectedly, the room upstairs was screaming loudly from one o'clock to three o'clock the next day. On the third night, the customers who stayed in the room upstairs shouted and jumped, but nothing happened. The only solution was to make a complaint call at 3 o'clock in the morning, so it was quieter. Even the sound of running water in the toilet upstairs was very loud. This hotel is not soundproof. I don't know why. I have never encountered a hotel like this.

There are many restaurants nearby, and you can eat a lot after a short walk. The hotel smells good, the standard rooms have large beds, the daily room cleaning is warm and considerate, and the waiters are generally friendly. The breakfast is rich, the ingredients are fresh, and the recommendations change daily.
Disadvantages: The room is small, the hair in the shower drain should be cleaned daily otherwise it will easily get clogged, and the attitude of some waiters needs to be improved. When we checked out, it was said that we had eaten biscuits, but in fact we didn't. It was only 6 yuan anyway. I think this is a management problem. Breakfast is too western style, hope to add more Chinese food.
Overall, this is the hotel I chose. It’s great, and its flaws do not hide its merits! !

I thought I had gone to the wrong place, so I asked the driver if he was looking for the wrong place. I looked left and right but didn't see a bellboy or receptionist. Later, I went to the front desk and asked why there was no one outside to greet me. The front desk's answer was: It's hard to recruit people here just because a bell boy went to eat... If I remember correctly, this should be a five-star hotel. This answer is a bit beyond the realm of possibility. Imagine! The room facilities are okay and there is a bathtub. In the dry weather in the north, it is very important to have a bathtub! Smoking is allowed in the hotel, and the corridors are filled with the smell of smoke. You really have to hold in your breath when you walk there, otherwise you will be fainted. Everything else is quite satisfactory. I can't say it's not bad at all, but after experiencing it, I don't want to stay again.

If you plan to go to Tiananmen/Forbidden City/Nanluoguxiang/Shichahai/Houhai, I’ll definitely consider riding there. As for bicycles, it was sunny for the eight days we came here, and the non-motorized lanes in Beijing are very wide. It was very pleasant to ride a bicycle and enjoy the breeze.

msg:For us, as foreign tourists, traveling to Beijing with our parents, this is a very satisfactory stay experience. The hotel is located opposite the National Art Museum of China Station, and it is convenient to go anywhere on Metro Line 8. The room is on a high floor, simple and elegant, and the daily hygiene is very satisfactory. The front desk, concierge, and breakfast service were great. Will, the concierge, was very helpful in arranging a taxi to Gubei Water Town, and also followed up to ensure that our trip went smoothly. Really recommend and worth staying.

msg:My parents haven’t been to Beijing for a long time. My mother’s aunt used to live near this hotel, so she is very familiar with this place. The transportation is convenient, opposite the National Art Museum of China, and within walking distance to Nanluogu Lane, Wangfujing Street and even the Forbidden City. If you want to stay in a hotel with a great environment, the Huaqiao Tower Ruishi Hotel is great in terms of value for money.
I would also like to thank Dai Dai for warmly welcoming my parents and helping the elderly with taxis, check-in, etc. My parents were very happy during the five-day trip.

msg:I have searched almost all the five-star and luxury hotels near the Forbidden City. They are basically very old hotels with very old sanitary facilities, so I am worried about the sanitary conditions. There are also a lot of complaints about the service of some old hotels. I was very depressed at one time... There are so many choices to choose from. Finally I chose this one, luckily I chose this one😁👍🏻👍🏻

Facilities: New hotel, smart facilities, very good. Although the toilet is not smart, the bathroom facilities are clean. The slippers are relatively comfortable and the soap and body lotion smell great. There is also a capsule coffee machine, which is very good.

Hygiene: Very clean. The portable sheets I brought with me were not used.

Service: The service is very good, warm and thoughtful. I arrived late due to traffic jam and even offered to upgrade my room. The bed is also quite comfortable, not so soft that it hurts my back. It can also be hardened, but not by adding wooden boards but by turning the mattress over. Check in and check out were quick. Breakfast is also good, quite rich.

Environment: It is very convenient to travel, and many places can be reached on foot. You can see the sunrise from the east-facing room, which is so beautiful. Below you can see the courtyard, which is very unique.

msg:Let’s talk about the advantages first: the location is very convenient, whether it’s the subway or the bus, the concierge Xiao Zhu is good and the service is enthusiastic, and the aunt and supervisor in charge of health on the tenth floor where I stayed are very good!
Let’s talk about the shortcomings. I stayed for six nights in total and only slept well on one night. I stayed on the tenth floor for three nights. The air conditioning was very poor and almost non-existent. It was very hot. The hotel only provided duvets, which covered the hot but not the cold. On the third day, the water in the shower was blocked. I cleaned it myself, changed rooms, and moved to the ninth floor. It was fine on the first night, but started to get worse on the second day. There were mosquitoes, and I woke up with itching bites. On the third night To make matters worse, I had no choice but to call the housekeeping depar**ent and they gave me mosquito repellent, which made me feel better. I guess there was water in the shower area on the ninth floor or something, and there were mosquitoes.
In general, it is not up to the standard of a five-star hotel. The front desk service is average and the work handover is not good. I will not choose it next time.

It turned out that the subway station was also nearby, and it was very fast to go to scenic spots when there were many people on weekends. My boyfriend was careless. It took several days after he checked out to find that he had left a short-sleeved shirt in the room and had not brought it back. He contacted the hotel guest service center and found it. Thank you sister Wu Han for helping to find it and send it back. I will choose to stay here next time. ~

Living here allows you to:

*Tiananmen Night Ride - Awesome
* 10 minutes by yellow car to the Forbidden City

Small suggestion: The hotel lobby is bright and spacious. It would be better if there are more seats for customers. After all, after calling a taxi, you can only stand at the door and wait.

msg:Will stay here next time. I feel safe and comfortable when I go back to the hotel. The location is very good, just outside the "Art Museum" exit of Metro Line 5. The bus station is also very close. Various buses, 58, 101, 109, 111... take one stop to Jingshan Park and the Forbidden City and then walk.
1. Arrive at 11 o'clock in the evening, and a waiter will help push the luggage into the room. It’s not like the message in the comments saying no one helped;
2. Many staff members are very meticulous and humane. My throat was uncomfortable and I lost my voice. A girl on duty with fair skin, student hair, and glasses gave me a cup of watermelon juice and said she would ask the waiter to bring more bottles of water to the room. I came back in the evening and saw a box of water😱. I was very grateful to this girl. I didn't pay attention to her name, and I didn't see her when I left early and came home late in the next few days. On the fourth day, the room attendant saw me and was concerned about the condition of my throat, and told me to come to her anytime if I had any questions;
3. The hotel management is very meticulous and rigorous. I went to the Jinshanling Great Wall on the second night of my stay and did not return to the hotel. The housekeeping staff probably found the luggage in the room and pretended it had not been touched. At around 9pm on the third day, hotel staff called the room to inquire about the situation, and they were very meticulous. I actually paid a 5-day deposit. Of course I wasn’t worried about running away, I was probably worried about the safety of the guests;
4. The flight leaves at 5 o'clock on the day of departure, and check-out is extended to 2 o'clock. Staff also help with printing jobs. The guy at the hotel entrance is also very nice.
5. The hotel's breakfast is also great, and the pastries are particularly good. There are some new dishes every day. Various kinds of porridge are very suitable for tourists from out of town.
I just don’t understand why there is a charge for Coke and Sprite in the refrigerator. Many hotels provide them for free. In fact, I didn’t drink it without charge. I asked customer service to add green tea bags once, and a bunch of them were put out the next day.
6. The hotel is very quiet. I wonder if the orientation of our room is better. Even though the room was full during National Day, I could barely hear anyone talking or closing doors in the corridor.
I will stay here again next time I come to Beijing.

msg:1. The deposit depends on your mood. The amount collected varies from zero to zero, which is very unprofessional.
2. The front desk said that for the sake of food safety, takeaways cannot be delivered. When I went down to get the takeaways, I found that the takeaways were placed on the open ground outside the gate. In fact, it is probably because they are afraid of affecting the hotel's style and choose to ignore the guests' feelings. Maybe we are not your customers. Group it.
3. The elevator is not very sensitive and has not been repaired after staying for many days. The sliding rail door of the indoor bathroom is broken, making it difficult to get in and out.
4. The washbasin is very small and there is no space to put the cosmetic bag. Isn’t this a designer hotel? If there is really no space, you don’t have to put the bathtub. The design is really inconvenient.
5. In such a big hotel, I asked why we didn’t have earplugs. Guess why we need earplugs?
6. When the small drinks in the refrigerator and laundry are expensive, can you improve your smart facilities? Can't figure it out

The bathroom got wet when I took a shower. The other two single beds were too thin. I have children, so I changed to a large bed. Room number!
On the second night, the toilet had the same water seepage as the bathroom, and there was a strong smell under the toilet. I originally asked room service to change the floor mat, but when I was getting ready to go to bed at 11 o'clock in the evening, there was construction going on downstairs, and there was always something digging into the ground. The noise was so loud that we couldn't sleep. We called the customer service depar**ent to inquire. The customer service didn't know and their attitude wasn't very good. It didn't solve the problem. We endured it for about 10 minutes and then called the service depar**ent to complain. The work was not completed until 12 o'clock. Finally, at about 12 o'clock, we temporarily changed to another room that the manager said was quieter. This room was very poor in terms of cleanliness. Two dead small insects could be seen at the door. ! In addition, at around 7 o'clock in the morning, there was loud noise from other construction outside, which woke us up!
As a five-star hotel, it is a place to rest and sleep, but the result is a 10-point disappoin**ent in service and environment! Not qualified for five stars at all!

msg:I didn't have particularly high expectations before coming here, but I didn't expect the check-in experience to be so good~ I was blindsided before, but this hotel is really good~

The location is less than a little more than one kilometer from Wangfujing Pedestrian Street. It's okay for a stroll, and it's more convenient to ride a car. Of course, there is a subway station when you go out, which is really convenient.

I didn't expect this hotel to be quite big, because I went to the gym and swimming pool on the fifth floor, only to find that there are so many rooms on the third and outer floors.

The room environment is also good, the bathroom has wet and dry partitions, there is a shower and a bathtub, and the toiletries are all Oulong, with grapefruit fragrance, which is really good. Even the slippers and bathrobes are very comfortable, and the bed is very comfortable.

There are drinking water and capsule coffee machines in the room, as well as sofa tables, which are suitable for leisure and office work.

The restaurant is near the elevator on the first floor, and the breakfast is quite rich, both Chinese and Western, and there are pancakes made on the spot. There are quite a lot of choices.

If you drive there, you won’t be able to park for free when you check in. Normally, it’s 15 yuan an hour during the day, and it’s cheaper at night. However, if you park for a long time, you can enter the car number at the front desk and you can get a cap of 80 yuan a day. Relatively speaking, it’s okay up.

The service at the front desk is also very good, and the staff I met in the fitness area are also very nice. The only small problem is that it is displayed on a certain platform that welcome fruit will be provided, but I haven’t seen this one~

msg:I looked at hotels for nearly a week before coming here. Because I am a bit mysophobic and a bit perfectionist, I have been constantly comparing and choosing the most suitable hotel. Finally, I chose Overseas Chinese. After staying for 6 days, I came to the conclusion that I made the right choice!
Let’s talk about a few negative reviews about the hotel: 1. There was no one at the entrance to pick up luggage. When I went to check in and check out, there were people who helped carry luggage and guided check-in and check-out, and also helped with luggage. Put the box in the taxi.
2 is that the carpet in the hotel room is old and dirty, and the hygienic condition is not good. My feeling is: the carpet does look a little old and dirty, which is normal traces of people walking and stepping on it. No other hygienic problems have been found. No, the sheets and quilts were clean and tidy. I originally brought disposable sheets and quilts, a toilet cover and a bathtub cover, but I didn't use any of them. 3. The service attitude is bad. I don't have this feeling. They served with a smile throughout the process and solved problems in a timely manner without delay. 4 is that it is unreasonable to share the same door for the bathroom and shower room. I really like this design. The dry and wet separation can save space. My house is also going to refer to this design. There is also a sliding door on the outside of the whole house. The sleeping space and bathroom are well separated without affecting the private space. 5 is the question of whether I pressed Do Not Disturb or come in for cleaning in the room. I accidentally pressed Do Not Disturb before going out, and then the hotel called me at around 3 pm to ask if I needed to clean the room. They only went in to clean the room after I agreed. . 6. The water bottle is not enough. This problem can actually be solved by just asking the waiter. It is not a big problem at all. They just put the amount of water according to the standard. You can go and ask for more bottles, and there is no charge. .
There is also a subway station right at the hotel exit, which is very convenient for going to several famous attractions. Except for Universal Studios, which takes more than 50 minutes by car, other places are less than 30 minutes by car. The location is very good and it is very convenient to travel.

All the staff in the hotel are very welcoming. They greet you at the reception and take the initiative to check in. The cleaning lady is also very enthusiastic. The room service cannot be better. Since I went out to buy water in the middle of the night on the first day, I said to put more water this time. The girl gave us eight bottles in a swish.
Speaking of the restaurant on the first floor, Jiahe's dishes are not outstanding. Among the Southeast Asian dishes, they can only be said to be quite satisfactory. However, the service is also too enthusiastic. Because of some mistakes in the taste and timing of the dishes, it should be the head waiter. In addition to giving us free drinks and knowing that I had to catch the car, I also packed coffee and cola for us. I was so embarrassed. We appreciated the kindness. We will drink cola and coffee next time.
After staying in Beijing for these days, the first thing I can feel is the attitude of the staff at Overseas Chinese Building. They put guests first. This attitude is enough to make up for any shortcomings in the hardware.
Even though I still receive requests for after-sales reviews on my way back, this time the call is not so annoying.

The hair dryer had poor contact and the socket came loose after being used for a while and the power was cut off. When leaving the hotel, an online taxi came at the door, and there was no bellboy to help put the luggage. There was an elderly person at the end. The parking attendant helped me put my luggage in the trunk.
Good experience: The service from the Golden Key guy was very enthusiastic and professional. The breakfast was great.

The people at the front desk who checked in acted as if someone owed you money. From check-in to check-out, the person at the front desk acted as if they owed her money. I thought a refund was required. Who knows if it would be better if the room was changed to another person? In addition to being close to the subway station, I will definitely not choose this hotel next time. This is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. This service is really terrible. As for the room facilities, although they are newly renovated, they are really not up to five-star standards.

msg:I plan to bring my family to Beijing. I have been selecting hotels very early. After reading the location and reviews from Ctrip, I finally chose this hotel
 It's really good. The hotel has a sense of ceremony and every detail is very well done. The most important thing is the hotel's service. From getting off the bus to taking a taxi to leave at the Great Wall, the service in the whole process is very good. I just arrived. At that time, a very thin girl at the front desk upgraded our room. Since we had a flight in the early morning, we arrived at the hotel relatively early, but we were also very tired. The girl urged the cleaning lady to rush us in advance. The room was clean and tidy. We sat in the place where we had afternoon tea and rested. We didn’t order anything to drink. I felt embarrassed at the time. I told the little brother that we should clean the room here and then we would go. Regarding the room, the little brother said sincerely and enthusiastically, "It doesn't matter. You can do it. You can sit here and rest. After the hygiene is done, the young lady immediately let us go to the room to rest. On the day of check-out, because we decided to go to the Great Wall at the last minute, so Our things were confiscated, but we were in the Summer Palace again. We played in the Summer Palace until almost 5 o'clock before returning to the hotel to pack our things. The hotel did not charge us any fees. However, when we were playing in the Summer Palace, I was very worried about renewing the hotel room because I could no longer stay. , I would be worried that I haven’t packed my things yet. The hotel staff contacted me and said that they could extend the time for me so that I can take my family to play with peace of mind. It’s a really good hotel. I often travel around for business and have stayed in so many hotels. This hotel is the only one that impressed me and I must give it a long and positive review. 😘😘😘

        First of all, the quality of the toiletries in the room is very poor. On the surface, it seems to be a sample of the brand, but the quality of the things inside is very poor. After using the shampoo and conditioner, the hair is completely tangled, which is not as good as an ordinary hotel. , the problem is that when we called one day in advance, the guest room said it was a sample of the brand, so we didn't bring any toiletries ourselves, and the experience was very bad.
        Secondly, there is serious water leakage in the shower room. The first night I was so noisy that I couldn't sleep. The second night I called someone to repair it, but they said I didn't bring the tools. The third day I came to repair it during the day, but no one came to repair it at all. It wasn't until I called again in the third night that someone came. Maintenance, this work efficiency is completely unable to match the service of a five-star hotel, and it affects sleep.
        Thirdly, although it is a hotel renovated in 2021, the facilities are very old and not smart at all. They are still in the same state as in 2008. The sound insulation effect of the room is not very good. The footsteps upstairs and the voices in the next room are very clear. .
        Finally, after we raised these issues with the room manager, they did not propose corresponding measures that were acceptable to people. Instead, they ended up taking botched measures, which made people very angry.
        In short, it is not worth staying in a hotel like this at this price. I hope everyone can avoid lightning. At this price, you can definitely stay in a hotel with better value for money and better service.

First of all, let’s talk about the good points: the location is excellent, on Wangfujing Street; the hotel lobby is artistically decorated; after check-in, there is a waiter to help carry the luggage to the door of the room; the breakfast is not bad.
Let’s talk about the dissatisfaction: the room is small and the facilities inside cannot be called five-star; the shower room only has shampoo and conditioner, no shower gel, and two bottles of shampoo. I don’t know if I put it there intentionally or I forgot it. Put shower gel; the toilet and shower room use the same sliding door. If you block the toilet, you can't block the shower room. The sliding door is very heavy and it is difficult to open the sliding door from the shower room. There is a charge for drinks in the cold drink cabinet and some snacks. .

I still have a relationship with Huaqiao. I lived here in 2012, and it was still relatively old. My friend who lived with me took away the laundry bag to put things in, and charged 30 yuan when I checked out😂. Come again this time, it has been completely new, the rooms and lobby are very stylish, and the price is much higher. This time there was another episode, the 1.5 liters of mineral water in the room, I thought it was free, but I still thought the hotel was very thoughtful, and gave a large bottle of water on such a hot day, but after checking out, I received a call saying that it was charged, 25 Yuan. I don't know if the customer took off the charge label before, and there is no charge on the bottle.
Next time I come, I will consider living in an overseas Chinese. By the way, I will visit an art center opposite and the National Art Museum of China.

It’s definitely not for ease of use, and it doesn’t seem to save a little money. Maybe it’s purely for the designer to be different, without considering the user’s experience, which is very bad. The design of the sink and the room is not completely separated, and it is not good to wash your hands after going to the bathroom at night, which will disturb the family.

msg:Take the old and the young, travel in summer vacation. About the hotel, I really struggled for a long time. Travel needs to be convenient, the safety factor should be higher, the sound insulation should be better, and it should be cleaner. In all aspects, I gave up the cooperative hotel of the unit and chose Huaqiao Ruishi.
Before the trip, the housekeeper contacted us to ask if there were any special needs, and told us that there were children, but nothing else. As a result, I arranged a room not far from the elevator and on the side, where the children's things were also prepared.
After that, it will be cleaned every day and the items will be replenished. If there is any need, please contact the housekeeping depar**ent, and it will be repaired soon.
One day I arranged for the Great Wall, and I made an appoin**ent with a chartered driver at 6:30. After passing by the restaurant and leaving the door for a few minutes, I asked casually, and the staff immediately arranged packing services. It's really great and touching.
On the last day, we arranged for the children to pack the afternoon tea in the lobby. Had a great time eating on the train.
Next time we come to Beijing, we will still choose this hotel.

There are many types of breakfast, the small wontons taste good, there are many kinds of stir-fried dishes, and the pancakes are nice. It is also very comfortable for three people to live in one room. Generally speaking, it is very good, the sound insulation effect is also very good, and the equipment is very new. Value for money!

msg:Let me talk about the location and environment first. The hotel is located in the Wangfujing area. It is only a few hundred meters away from the Wangfujing business district. The most important thing is that it is very close to the subway station and the transportation is very convenient. The room environment and sanitation are very good. The bed is moderately soft and firm, with good support and is very comfortable. Even I, who often suffer from back pain, do not feel back pain when lying on it. The eiderdown quilt is also quite comfortable, and the swimming pool and gym are very good.
Let’s talk about the service again. After taking a taxi to the hotel, the doorman took the initiative to open the door and carry the luggage. It was very pleasant. The reception staff upgraded to the executive room for free when checking in. The concierge quickly handled the luggage storage. The feeling is very, very good , but then there was a little unpleasantness due to ambiguity in communication and check-in at the reception, but the hotel quickly resolved it, and the experience was still very good. Here, I would like to give special praise to Xiao Wang, the beauty in the executive lounge on the 11th floor, who treats people very politely Friendly, very friendly, makes people feel very happy, thank you~
In the end, I have to say a little bit of inadequacy, that is, the platform for storing things in the bathroom is too small. A small platform of 10 cm square is only enough to put a few small bottles of toiletries, and there is no place to put glasses. It's still a 5-point praise, and I will stay in your hotel next time I go to Beijing.

For example, if the mineral water guest has taken out all of it, it will not be replenished... If the fruit guest eats one, there will be no second one. There is only one waiter, and people often come to chat, which quite affects the experience. The breakfast usher on the first floor has a high emotional intelligence, but there are many service staff in the restaurant, and the guests do not have the consciousness to clear the table after they leave... As a result, breakfast is eaten out of the plate A bad experience after another... What deserves praise is the room service staff, who are always available and responsive to requests... I would like to praise the guy guarding the door in the lobby on the first floor. He saw that I couldn't handle the express cabinet and took the initiative to help. He has a good sense of service. !

msg:The hotel is very enthusiastic about leaving a message, so I will give a fair evaluation.
First of all, the hotel's location and facilities are worthy of the hotel price. Room service and front desk service are very good.

Compared with several hotels of the same star rating near Wangfujing, the room is relatively small. Corridors and such are also very small. The water plug in the bathtub is a flaw. When you lie down in it, your thighs will easily hit the water plug, and the water will become less and less unknowingly. . .

After staying at Wangfujing Hilton, Park Plaza, and Rui Shi, my personal evaluation is:
Hilton Wangfujing has the best service, the most spacious rooms, the most convenient dining options, and is not as old as expected.
Ruishi is the newest, suitable for people who like new hotels, but the rooms are relatively small.
Lai Ting is slightly more affordable, but the facilities are older. There is a free self-service laundry room, which is great

In such a crowded summer vacation, I was able to clean the room and replenish supplies in time. The buffet breakfast included in the room rate is very user-friendly. Guests who are in a hurry are provided with take-out boxes, and they can take away breakfast. Many hotels do not allow take-away. This is worth it👍The hotel's double room is two meters wide , The three of us slept together and didn’t squeeze at all. The only thing I want to complain about is that the toilet and shower room share a sliding door. Even if it is a family, there is still a private space between you and your children, especially when the children are older, they will be really shy.

There was no guide to the elevator when we came out of the room. We were placed in a corner, so it would be troublesome if there was a fire alarm. What is commendable is the breakfast, which is so rich and the luggage attendant is also very good.

msg:Very poor attitude and no service at all.
I booked four rooms. After checking out, the front desk called to inform me that small towels in three rooms were missing. After I contacted my family, they said they had never used them or seen them. The hotel front desk was still reluctant and wanted me to provide the contact information of my family members to verify one by one. After I repeatedly confirmed that the towels were not taken by my family, the front desk said that if they could not find the towels, they would deduct the cost of the towels from the deposit.
First of all, towels in three rooms were lost at the same time. Shouldn't this situation be investigated and verified internally before feedback is given to guests? Your hotel actually deducted the deposit without confirming whether the towels were put into the room by the aunt the day before.
Secondly, after I firmly objected to withholding the deposit, the front desk just gave up without any apology.
The way your hotel handles problems is not like an established five-star hotel. The staff lacks training and has a bad attitude. I would not recommend it.

msg:First of all, the room is very cramped. Although it was redecorated, the original layout resulted in a relatively low floor height and the room layout is a bit compact, especially the sink is so narrow that you can't even put your things in it. Secondly, the taste of the breakfast is very, very ordinary, just like an ordinary boutique hotel. There are very few options for cooking to order. There is only one noodle stall. After staying for three nights, the side dishes have not changed a bit, only cabbage and the cheapest kind of fish balls, and This is the first time I encountered small wontons, which were boiled beforehand, pulled out and placed there. When customers order, they can be soaked in water. Can this kind of small wontons be delicious? The next morning when I was having breakfast, my husband saw the chef cooking an omelette for a foreigner alone, so he said, please help me too, but the chef said: This is for others. Then my husband said again, please give me a copy like this. The chef just looked reluctant... Is this attitude normal? Another outrageous thing is that one day after cleaning the room, there were no bath towels. Although it was a small matter, we found out that there were no bath towels when we were planning to wrap our children in bath towels after taking a bath! As a 5 star hotel I feel this should not be happening.

msg:We are a family of three who came to Beijing this time. We came from the hotel over Jinyu Hutong. Although we checked in because we were not satisfied there, Ctrip customer service canceled it for free. I praised the efficiency for being too high. After contacting customer service The refund was given within half an hour after I finished talking about the problem. Ctrip customer service contacted the hotel throughout the whole process. I went directly to the front desk to hand over the room card and it was refunded. I will still book hotels with Ctrip in the future!
Closer to home, I stayed at the Overseas Chinese Hotel at night. Fortunately, I added it to the shopping cart before. I checked that the price was the same as when I added it to the previous purchase. After returning it, I went directly to the Overseas Chinese Hotel, only one subway stop away.
Let me talk about the advantages first: 1. The location of the hotel is very close to the subway station. Just past the crosswalk is the No. 8 National Art Museum of China. Although it is only one subway station away from Jinyu Hutong, there are few people here, not noisy, and very quiet. I like this location very much The location is very convenient to go everywhere. You can walk to Wangfujing. The Forbidden City we went to the next day didn't take too much time. It's very close to the National Theatre. If you don't bring your children, you can go to see a drama with your husband. 2. The environment of the hotel is very good. You may come from Jinyu Hutong. Once you enter the lobby, you will feel that it is very big and bright. It is indeed a five-star hotel. The big bed in the room is two big and one small is enough, there is little dust, the cleaning is timely, the bedding is also very clean, the toilet is also very clean when looking at the left side, the last hotel is too dusty and visible to the naked eye, so it was replaced. New toiletries will be given every day after cleaning. There is a capsule coffee machine in the house, and the area is also very large. The family lives very comfortably. The first thing to do when you come back from a storm every day is to put water in the bath! 3. The breakfast has a five-star standard, both Chinese and Western. The noodle stalls have chaos, rice noodles, and noodles. What I look forward to most is going downstairs to have breakfast. I eat very good food every day, and I am very satisfied. 4. The reason why I didn’t choose Huaqiao before the service was because the reviews were not very good, but it turned out that I was right to choose Huaqiao. The staff is very enthusiastic. There are three computers for check-in and there is no waiting time. The breakfast service staff cleared the dishes in a timely manner. Moreover, the coffee is prepared and brought to the table. There are really no problems in the previous reviews. If I go to Beijing next time, I will still choose Huaqiao. The price/performance ratio is really high!
Question: Tell me something, actually I don’t think it’s a problem, but for the betterment of the hotel, let’s talk about it:
1. The gasket of the bathtub is often broken and leaks. On the first day, it was too late to call the room service to fix it. It had to be soaked in water. It was too wasteful, so I called the customer service to fix it the next day. The master came quickly and replaced it. It was easy to use in less than five minutes. It should be a common problem. It broke again on the fourth day, and the master came to repair it quickly and it was easy to use again. 2. The wire plug of the hair dryer is a bit loose. If you blow it by yourself, you have to raise your arms high. If you blow it to your children, you need your husband to help press the plug. On the last day, you can get the plug in the house and plug it in. There is no such problem.
Generally speaking, I am very satisfied with this hotel. My friend also said that it is fortunate that the overseas Chinese did not hesitate to change directly that day. Otherwise, I would be really depressed these days...

Really bad experience. The attitude of the hotel is also very speechless. Let me find the brand to evaluate whether it has been washed or not. Do not admit that there is a problem with dry cleaning. Integrity and service attitude make me feel a bad hotel. The picture below is the after washing picture provided to me by the hotel itself.

Dimly was about to go to sleep when she suddenly found that the light had turned on by itself. Scared me to sit up. I thought it was someone entering the door and taking a photo with a mobile phone's flashlight. It turned out that the light bulb was broken. It flashes every few minutes. In the middle of the night, the engineering staff came to deal with it. It's pretty quick. Hygiene is also OK. The main reason is that the transportation is very convenient. subway entrance. Ten minutes walk from Wangfujing. But this breakfast is really not flattering.

The hotel will call one day in advance to ask if there are any special requirements. I need to celebrate my birthday in advance, and a bottle of red wine in the room is also a small decoration. There will be a welcome card, which is very considerate, and all the coffee capsules I noted are arranged. I am afraid of the cold at night. Although the room cannot be heated, an electric heater was sent to me. The attitude of storing luggage and items the next day was very professional and enthusiastic. The room is relatively quiet, and it is very convenient to go to Wangfujing, Tiananmen, Lama Temple and other famous attractions. If I go to Beijing again in the future, I will consider this hotel first.

msg:The hotel is very satisfactory. The hotel booked two weeks in advance is quite expensive at the same time as the surrounding hotels with similar conditions.
At the beginning, I booked Atour near Chaoyangmen, but I had the nerve to ask for nearly 800...
Not to mention that the hotel environment is pretty good, the important thing is that there are subway stations and bus stations when you go out, which is super convenient!
The attitude of the staff is also quite good, and they are willing to try their best to meet the needs of customers. The air conditioner is very quiet, suitable for friends who are afraid of noise.
The toiletries are from Oulong.
My room type also has a small dressing table, which is really considerate. I have never seen a dressing table in the hotels I have stayed in.
The Jiahe restaurant downstairs is quite delicious. If you don’t want to go out for a day, you can try it.

However, there are also a few disadvantages
1. The square toilet is not easy to sit on, and it is a bit cold without a smart toilet
2. You can't go upstairs for takeaway, you can only get it at the door by yourself
3. The attitude of the front desk of the hotel is very good, but we still have to pay attention. One day we forgot our room card and asked the front desk to help open the door. The front desk gave us a new room card after checking the surname, which is quite unsafe.

Next time I come to Beijing, I will stay here again. I hope the hotel will get better and better.

I had a good impression of this hotel, and the location is also very good, so I chose this hotel this time. This time, the Overseas Chinese Hotel has been renovated, and the lobby is also very domineering , The service staff is also very enthusiastic. We arrived at the hotel on April 30 after a good tour around the world. It was almost 10 o'clock at that time. The concierge David who received us was very enthusiastic and wanted to help us with our luggage and send it to the room. He also introduced us to the delicious food nearby, and also arranged for the window ventilation of the room after we went out every day. We checked out 2 hours late, and happened to meet David when we left after 3 days of check-in, and calculated the departure time for us. This time Huaqiao Building Hotel and I felt great. Although there are people when we go out, it is really comfortable to go back to the hotel to take a bath to relieve the fatigue of the day. Hope it stays that way. Next time I come to Beijing, I will still choose Huaqiao Building Ruishi Hotel.

The pancakes are delicious, the orange juice is delicious, and the pineapple is so sweet! ⑦ Zhu Qiangqiang from the concierge depar**ent has a very good service attitude! Five-star praise~ Next time you come to Beijing or travel with friends, you will choose to recommend Huaqiao Ruishi!
📝Of course, there is also something remarkable: I don’t know why the air-conditioning system in the room does not respond when it is turned on and off. Also, the toothbrush in the room is a bit hard 😂~ and the faucet in the room is leaking when I take a shower. I suggest the master to repair it~ Of course, these will not affect the full score of Huaqiao Ruishi in my heart💯

You have to close the service when you sleep. The rooms along the street can see the National Art Museum of China and the Drum Tower, Jingshan Park and Jingshan Park in the distance. The White Tower is generally ok

msg:Very satisfied with the hotel I stayed at during National Day
1. The hotel looks very nice and is very new. The location is very convenient next to Wangfujing. Opposite is the art museum. There is also an art exhibition hall in the lobby on the first floor.
2. The room is quite large and the facilities are complete and clean. The only drawback is that the bathroom only has a sliding door (bathing is a bit inconvenient)
3. The lobby smells very good and is very impressive. I feel good every time I walk through the lobby.
4. The front desk service attitude is very good and patiently answered my questions. I accidentally picked up the wrong takeaway from someone else during my stay (because the hotel does not have a takeout counter, I hope this can be improved), but the front desk negotiated and solved the problem quickly. Thank you very much.
5. After staying for a few days, the cleaning staff saw that we drank a lot of water and put a few extra ones in when we cleaned the room. It was very considerate.
6. The breakfast restaurant nearby is very delicious. Thank you.

Staff service is also good. The only not-so-good experience is that the central air conditioner in the hotel does not currently provide cooling. As the temperature has risen in the past few days, the windows are closed and cannot be opened, so the room is rather stuffy. After calling the housekeeping depar**ent, a cooling fan was provided. It was very noisy when it was turned on, and it was a bit noisy at night. If it was not turned on, it was so hot that I couldn't sleep. It would be nice if the air conditioner could be changed flexibly according to the weather.

1. The design of the bathroom in the double bed room is very unreasonable. The bathtub and the shower room share a sliding door. The left side is closed and the right side cannot be closed. It is called an open bathroom. Do you have to be a couple to book a double room? There are also friends who travel together, and colleagues who are on business trips. It is really embarrassing that the door cannot be closed when taking a shower. If it's a customer in a similar situation definitely avoid this one.
2. The service awareness is particularly poor, and I don't know how the employees are trained. I have to be reminded several times for cleaning, and I don’t clean it up once I come here. Many places have not been cleaned and the garbage is not taken out. I call and remind me to do it. The doorknob was removed from the window of the room, and the waiter had to sign a liability waiver agreement to open it, and the waiter had to close the window to close it. We let the windows open on the first night. It was too cold the next morning, so we called them to close them. We kept making two phone calls to urge them to come, but they didn’t close the windows until we left. This kind of thing The way is really annoying. Living here is to call them every day, urging this to urge that.
3. After the epidemic is opened, takeaway can still only be placed on the table at the door, and call the front desk to deliver food that cannot be touched by customers. It's just an excuse for convenience.
Such a good location and decoration, but the service staff you accept is such an executive force. I don't know what your group's real focus is. I hope that friends who come to Beijing must avoid this hotel.

msg:very fair evaluation
I looked for a lot of hotels before coming to Beijing
The prices around Overseas Chinese are basically 2,000. Sophia and Lijun, which are farther away, are more expensive than Overseas Chinese and farther away from the Forbidden City than Overseas Chinese.
Overseas Chinese newly renovated five-star in 2021, including double breakfast double bed room 1200
It's the hotel with the highest cost performance that I've been looking for for several days
Accommodation experience: The swimming pool is free, but children’s swimming trunks are not sold. In the end, Meituan bought a set, and the children went down to play for a while
Next to the Art Museum, the Capital Theater, ten minutes' walk to Wangfujing, next to Metro Line 8, the traffic is very convenient
Service: Service attitude is good
But there is one thing I want to mention, we live on the eighth floor, and we need to sign a window opening agreement
After opening the window, lock the window and open the window again, you need to ask the attendant to assist
Thinking about not locking the windows can be closed, so I didn’t ask to lock the windows at night
As a result, there was a strong wind in Beijing at night, very strong, and the window was blown open at two o'clock in the middle of the night, shivering from the cold, and the waiter was called to lock the window in the middle of the night
It's hard to say.
The types of breakfast are okay, but if you bring a ten-year-old boy, you need to make up half of the breakfast for 84 yuan
The hotel toilet is not a smart toilet and cannot be flushed
Add a quilt at night, told that there is no quilt, and provided a bed sheet

There is indeed no clear price tag for drinking water in the bar in the room. The large bottle of Baisui Mountain is charged, and the small bottle is not charged.

Call room service for kids slippers and toothbrushes

Summary: This price, five-star, breakfast included, convenient transportation, bathtub in the room, welcome fruit, free capsule coffee, you can continue to stay next time you come to Beijing

msg:Traveling during the Chinese New Year, I am still willing to comment even now. I can see my satisfaction with the hotel👍First of all, the location of the hotel is very good, next to the Capital Theater and the National Art Museum of China. We walked to the Forbidden City and the National Museum of China, and felt the capital all the way. There are two subway stations nearby, with different lines.
The front desk, restaurant, and room service attitude of the hotel are very good. I stayed for 5 days in a row. When I checked in, there was a small episode in my reservation. The front desk was very patient and polite; there were a lot of restaurants, and the dining environment was good; the time I booked was a little bit It was late, I booked a twin room two days ago, but there was only a double bed for the next few days. Because I had a child, I contacted the guest room to send a quilt, and the waiter sent it in time to help us make it up. The bed is very big, although it is a big bed, it is enough to sleep our three southerners who are not too big.
The building is old, but it has been renovated inside, and the designer hotel is indeed very artistic. The heating in the north is really too strong. The only problem is the old building. There is still a problem with the water in the shower room, it is easy to block, and there are wet marks on the ceiling. But after all, the capital, the location, environment, and price are all very satisfactory.

msg:Come to a running account. The location of the hotel is excellent, close to the subway station of the National Art Museum of China, but there is no exit at the hotel at the four corners of the intersection. There is no welcome at the entrance of the hotel, only security guards, and the space in front of the door is cramped, resulting in confusion in the pick-up and drop-off vehicles, and there is no staff to help when getting on and off the bus. There were no vacancies when I arrived at the store earlier, so I quickly handled luggage storage. When I arrived at the store around 4 pm, the room was arranged and a baby cot was prepared according to the order notes. When you swipe your card to enter the door, what you see is a beautiful pot of green plants, but if you look closely, it is actually plastic, plastic! ! . Ctrip states that the room area is 80㎡, but there is absolutely no visual inspection. It is 65㎡. Of course, if you count the shared area, I have nothing to say. In addition, there is no oven hood in the room plan. The window of the room is facing the PuXuan Hotel. The lights are extremely beautiful at night. You can see the National Art Museum of China to the north, and you can even see several buildings of the Forbidden City from the bedroom. The view is great. The decoration style of the room is unconventional, beautiful and a**ospheric, but if it claims to be a luxury hotel, it is a bit worse. First of all, the floor is very loud, especially on the side of the bedroom near the window, with a child under two years old staying here, it is not easy for the child to walk around while sleeping. The second bathroom placed hand cream in the wrong place, and the hair conditioner was wrongly placed. The main bathroom has no loofah, no clothesline, no laundry basket, no bath salt and no handheld sprayer in the bathtub, and the location of the faucet is strangely designed. It is not at the end of the bathtub. side. The shower and toilet share a sliding door, but there is no handle inside and it is difficult to open on both sides. It’s rare to see a newly renovated luxury hotel in the north without a washlet. At least there is a heated seat, but your home doesn’t have one. Although your home is Duravit, the experience of using the toilet is 0. On the first day, there were only two bottles of water in the room. I asked the customer service for water, and told me that the room was equipped with four bottles of water and I would not give it. The problem is that you only put two bottles, and even if you put four bottles, the guest asked for water. Why don't you give it? You must know that the bottled water of fast hotels such as Quanji Hanting is unlimited these years. The volume of the TV cannot be lowered, the lowest can only be 9. In order to avoid disturbing the sleep of the children in the bedroom, the TV in the living room can only be muted. The restaurant is quite satisfactory, the standard of an ordinary hotel. For example, the apple juice is freshly squeezed for the first breakfast, and the finished product is bottled the next day. What I am most dissatisfied with is the room service. I set it to be cleaned immediately when I went out before 10:00 on the second day of check-in. When I returned to the room at 3:00 pm, it was still not cleaned. I called the housekeeping depar**ent, but no one came after 15 minutes, and there was no explanation, so I told you To coax the child to sleep, let’s not clean it first, wait until the child wakes up, but after about half an hour, the child just fell asleep and went in after ringing the doorbell twice. I only wear underwear to accompany the child to sleep in the bedroom. Your hotel Do you know how embarrassing it is? Later, I left the room after 5 o'clock and asked the housekeeping depar**ent to clean it. It was clearly told that I only needed to throw out the trash, replace towels, replenish water and drinks, and nothing else was needed. However, when I came back at night, I didn't even do what I asked for. There was a bottle of water in the room. Neither, nor did the tea bags be refilled. During the Spring Festival, it is understandable that the room is full and the service is slow, but making mistakes is not the level that a high-end hotel should have. The Felicity Hotel on the second floor of the hotel is great, and the taste and service are worthy of the price, but it is troublesome not to pay the bill.

First of all, I stayed for four consecutive nights, and the room was pressed (Do Not Disturb) every day. However, after going out and returning to the room every day, a waiter came in. In terms of cleaning, I had laid a quilt before, added toiletries, garbage and used My cups have not been cleaned, and my jewelry and valuables have not been locked up. Excuse me, who is responsible for the disappearance? What does that (do not disturb) do? Secondly, the sound insulation effect of the hotel is very poor. Children are playing in the corridor early in the morning, and the voices of everyone walking through the corridor are very clear, which seriously affects the quality of sleep.
The waiters in the hotel are not very polite, and they will not say hello or say hello when they pass by
The several situations mentioned above have been reported by phone calls and hotels, but the result is that there is no result. The so-called follow-up means that there is no such thing!

I booked a total of two rooms for five nights in a row, and called the front desk to ask for mineral water. The front desk actually said that a room is limited to 6 bottles a day! And it's 6 vials! Unheard, unseen! The clothes hangers are also picky and refusing to give more. We have two big and two small rooms in one room, and we don’t even dry our clothes when it rains. Then the bathroom and toilet doors are shared, and the toilet door is gone when taking a shower, which is embarrassing! Breakfast is 97 yuan for those over 6 years old, and other hotels generally only charge for those over 1.3 meters. Another point, because it rained a few days when I went to Beijing, and the weather was only 27 degrees, so I left with the air conditioner turned on at 27 degrees. The three children in our company all had a cold and a fever. Beijing is very good, but the hotel is really not as good as the south!

The takeaway can’t be delivered upstairs, and there is no one from the hotel to deliver it, let alone a delivery robot. I have to go downstairs to pick it up at the door, which is very speechless
There is also a charge for parking if you stay in a hotel. It is only free between 9:00 pm and 7:00 am. We spent about two or three hundred parking fees for three days, which is ridiculous. The underground parking lot is also closed. If you park your car in winter, you have to walk to the hotel entrance in the cold wind
The most speechless thing is that the cleaning lady of the hotel left the rag in our room (as shown in the picture). Is this kind of mistake really something that a hotel at this price should have? outrageous

msg:I chose this place after comparing many hotels on May 1st. The main reason is that the location is superior. At the same time, the diamond members of the hotels matched by Ctrip also have many rights and interests. I gave up the Marriott system, which is relatively cheap and also has membership. I was very disappointed in the result. Don't choose this one if you have requirements. 1. Zero points are given to the front desk, and the hotel membership can be upgraded to two room types. The front desk said that the rooms are full on May 1st, but there are vacancies for various room types on Ctrip that day, so you are talking nonsense. 2. Zero points for membership management. Hotel membership can delay check-out. If you stay for three consecutive days, you can’t postpone it on the last day. There are more vacant rooms on the last day, and you can’t even delay check-out? What kind of members are you doing? 3. In the end, the only good ones are the aunt who cleans and the little brother who helps with luggage at the door.

I had no choice but to push a bunch of luggage in until I saw someone dragging the trolley out. No one helped me when I left the hotel. Carrying the luggage on the bus was not as good as a temporary worker at the hotel. Seeing that we had a lot of luggage, she took the initiative to help with some. The front desk service was also poor, with no sense of service and a rush when talking. During this period of time in Beijing, I stayed in a five-star hotel every day. This is the only hotel that makes people really angry.

There is a nucleic acid sampling point across the road. It is a community type. A 24-hour nucleic acid testing point can issue a paper report, and friends who take a plane can be included in it.
The view of the room is very good. Thanks to aidan for contacting me in advance. Knowing that I am afraid of noise, they arranged a very quiet room for me. The view is very good. I can respond to any needs in the middle. I am very embarrassed to become my personal housekeeper during the stay. Praise her here!
There is also a clean, comfortable and delicious breakfast environment downstairs. The desserts on the first floor are very unique. It was amazing to buy one and try it!
Although it is in a lively place, the hotel is very quiet. It can be said that it is quiet in the middle of the noise. If there is a disadvantage, there is no disadvantage! 🥰

msg:Thanks in advance to Ambassador Aid for his help during the stay.

Planted this hotel a long time ago. Strategic location, newly renovated and updated, under the banner of Jinyuan. All kinds of resources attract me to live once.
Finally, in the eleventh holiday, I was able to fulfill this wish.

The most commendable is the humanistic care of the hotel. As a Hilton Diamond Card customer for more than two years, I thought that Hilton's high-level guest system has been perfected, and I can receive greetings from the hotel before and during the stay.
Surprisingly, this time overseas Chinese also received butler service.

The arrangement was requested at check-in, the room was arranged in advance and a glass of red wine was presented. And also assisted in the registration of Jingjian Healthbao, and actively assisted in appealing guidance when a pop-up window occurred after check-in.

I would like to thank Ambassador Aid for all the assistance during my stay and for couriering the leftover clothes to me after my stay.
Price: Stayed for three nights, around 2500, excluding breakfast.
Room type: As a Ctrip member, I have upgraded the room type, including bathtub and minibar.

Facilities: The gym is not big, but it is quite complete, and there is water to drink.
Room: The decoration is still a little tasteful, the spare parts are complete and the quality is good. The area is very large, about 40 or more.

There are also many bus lines on the surrounding roads. It is very close to Wangfujing, Nanluoguxiang, Drum Tower, Shichahai and Tiananmen Square.
This National Day trip coincided with the couple's birthday. The hotel has carefully arranged and sent beautiful and delicious cakes.

2- Service... There seems to be no service. The attitude of the front desk is very cold and I did not inform in advance to upgrade my room to a lower floor, which is unprecedented
3- The breakfast is very rich, the location is excellent, the subway is opposite the second ring road

I really have to complain about Ctrip and the hotel. My order was upgraded on the original basis and it was arranged on the lowest floor next door to the gym. The sound insulation and noise can be imagined. I complained to Ctrip that the hotel compensated the dinner in the executive lounge, uh. . What a lounge. There is no dinner, and the two children have to order takeaway

It is indeed a five-star hotel next to the National Art Museum of China and the Forbidden City. No matter the room or the lobby, it reflects the good taste of the hotel. The matching hardware facilities and bedding, as well as the small details such as slippers, which are especially praised, are worth recommending to stay in and experience slowly, as well as the retro-inspired soft furnishings and sculptures everywhere, giving the illusion of entering an art gallery.
 Of course, if this is the case, it may not be perfect. The little episode just arrived at the hotel has also become the perfect beginning of the stay. Lulu's service is really impeccable. At that moment, nothing disappeared, the upgraded room, the exquisite desserts and fruit plates, and the message greetings sent by Lulu, I felt suddenly very happy. I met such a professional and patient hotel manager, who can take care of customers as family and friends. , is really invaluable. I would also like to thank Yan and Steven who helped me to buy purified water at night. From their personal qualities, we can see the excellence of the team. If there are any shortcomings, it may be that the breakfast is too simple and cannot reflect the five-star quality and local characteristics. This point should be actively improved, and I look forward to tasting delicious food next time. That way I can remember not just Lulu, Yan and Steven.

First, the front desk told me to upgrade the super king bed when I checked in, but when I arrived in the room, I found that it was a double bed of the same size as the room I booked, and it was not upgraded. Second, it smelled very bad after entering the room. I contacted the waiter and came to the door and said that she couldn't smell it. She asked me to take me to other rooms and refused to take a look, and gave me a solution of spraying freshener. Then I definitely couldn't accept it. I reported it to the front desk several times, and after waiting for a long time, I was given a solution to upgrade the room type. This time the bed is indeed bigger, and the room has no smell. Third, the breakfast is more general. Overall it is recommended.

All in all, this is an extremely poor hotel, don't stay here! It's not worth more than 1,000 room fees at all👎👎👎

msg:A long-time Ctrip user, I never comment, but I have to say a few words about this hotel. I read some reviews before booking, some were positive, and some were negative. But I thought the location and price were good value for money, so I booked a premium room for two nights. I arrived at the hotel at 11 o'clock in the morning and asked the front desk if I could check in. The front desk said that I could check in at two o'clock in the afternoon. I said no problem. We would take the two children to dinner first. I left a phone number and promised that I would be notified if a room was available at or before two o'clock. As a result, we did not receive any notice or call from your hotel before we arrived at the hotel at 3:30 in the afternoon. When I checked in, I asked if I could arrange for a higher floor. I frowned and told me that you brought two children, so I would upgrade you to a room, but the floor was lower, on the fifth floor. They specifically emphasized that they upgraded me and the room was large in size. We thanked them and went upstairs to take a look. Oh, it was on the platform level. The room faced the central well. It was very dark and had no view at all. Outside the window was the fence on the platform. Then I took a look and saw that there was already a card written "Ms. Asked if there were any children's slippers and said they had been distributed today? ? I asked the room service staff if my room was a premium room, and they replied that the room type was determined by the front desk. They said it was what they said? ? The entire hotel, including the service staff at the front desk, all reveal a kind of stupid shrewdness, treating people like monkeys and treating people like **?
The most disgusting thing is that there are still urine stains on the toilet seat cover that have not been wiped off, and there is red oil and chili water on the dining table that has not been wiped off! !
It was a very unsatisfactory check-in experience. I hope you will read this article before booking a room. Don't be like me, who took the baby to Beijing for a vacation before school started and ended up feeling uncomfortable.

msg:I like the hotel very much. I stayed for 4 consecutive nights. The renovated hotel reflects the appearance of a luxury or even a luxury hotel. The spare parts are from Oulong, and the hand dryer in the bathroom on the first floor is from Dyson. I like the decoration very much, the a**osphere is low-key and not exaggerated, and the attitude of the staff is very good. The only problem I want to ask is that the bathtub is close to the toilet, and the water from the bathtub can easily be brought into the toilet, and there is a risk of slipping into the toilet, so be careful with children. There are two nucleic acid points nearby, which can be reached by walking, and the Art Museum subway station is outside the door. Across the road is the Guardian Art Center, which often has exhibitions.

The downside is that the room service needs to be strengthened. Every day I go back, I have to call for water and coffee. After the service is still ok, it was delivered immediately, overall it is worth recommending…

msg:Superb hotel!
This hotel is one that I want to review very seriously, because I like many of its designs.
Hotel facilities: The Overseas Chinese Hotel is a very old hotel. I have only passed by and never stayed in it before, because it is really too old. This stay really made me feel refreshed. In terms of facilities, the hotel rooms are refurbished from an old hotel, so the hotel cities are the same size, but the specifications are different. It seems that only the suites are adjusted for the layout. If you have the opportunity to experience them, all the facilities in the rooms are very new. , From the glass to the toiletries, from the bedside sound to the toilet, you can see the seriousness and details of the hotel. like very much. I remember very clearly, the bedding let me know the first moment I arrived at the hotel, I will be able to sleep very sweetly these two days~ The implementation proved that it did not disappoint me!
Hotel service: Hotel service is more important than hardware facilities in my opinion. Every service staff in the hotel is very humble. We are talking about humility, not humbleness. They take their work seriously. I am very satisfied with the services of the front desk and lobby manager. Then the service of the restaurant waiter is really in the details. reflect quality. Breakfast in the restaurant, even the waiters are very considerate. I won't go into details, but I'm very impressed. It makes you feel that they really hope you can eat well~ This kind of service really makes me feel much more comfortable than Haidilao!
Regarding the service, I also want to talk about the manager Fang I met by chance, because after having breakfast, I wanted to take a good look at the sculptures in the hotel. I met the manager Fang, who was very beautiful and kind, and asked me how you slept, yes How do you feel about the hotel and what needs to be improved, we chatted unknowingly. She introduced me to the hotel's design, decoration, sculptures, etc., which made me like this hotel even more. Do the details of the hotel. I really hope that every hotel has such a lobby manager who is willing to chat with you and ask how you feel, so as to improve the hotel's service. Also because of the chat, I know that the hotel uses the Beijing Eight Sceneries in many details,
Knowing that the color matching of the hotel is charming. So it really feels like a great value for money. The wine glasses and glasses in the hotel room are all my favorite brands. It's all high-end, it's better than some five-star hotels that even take away the cups in the small bar ~ let people spurn!
Hotel location: The location is really a good hotel for tourism. The museum subway is at the entrance. It takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to the Forbidden City for 1.5km. Opposite is the art gallery. 5 minutes to the left of the hotel to Wangfujing. Even so, the hotel can be considered quiet. There is no tourist crowd. like very much!
Hotel price: The price of one thousand two hundred yuan, I am satisfied with such a hotel, but it is predicted that the hotel will increase slightly in the winter and summer vacations. But after all, aren't we working hard to earn money to enjoy a better life? So I accept the price!
The hotel breakfast is very good, Southeast Asian style! In the morning, you can eat curry chicken comparable to Susu! And super delicious fish soup!
The above reviews are purely personal experience. for reference only!

It goes to Nanluoguxiang, Shichahai, Prince Gong's Mansion in the north, the Forbidden City and Beihai Park in the east, and Wangfujing and Tiananmen Square in the south. There are also cultural venues such as the National Art Museum of China and the Capital Theatre nearby. The price is moderate, there are not many people, and the environment is more comfortable.

msg:The location is good, opposite to Pu Xuan, very close to the art museum and art, and you can also walk to Wangfujing. In the evening, the mood came, and we also rode to Chang'an Avenue, the Forbidden City, and Qianmen to cool off the heat. The overall service is good, but unfortunately there are some problems with the socket next to the vanity mirror. The plug of the hair dryer always falls out, which affects the efficiency. In addition, I didn't expect the bathtub to leak water. It didn't leak out of the bathtub, but when the valve was pressed down, the water could not be stored. It could only be maintained by running water while taking a bath, which is not environmentally friendly. The area of this place is not big, and it is enough for daily use. After eating the Southeast Asian food on the first floor, I felt that it was not as good as the reviews, but it was normal. Seeing that there is a club on the top floor, it is still being renovated, and I look forward to a wave.

The front staff on duty at noon on July 15th was very enthusiastic and patient to communicate with the driver, and finally arrived at the Forbidden City smoothly. On the day of check-out, because we couldn't get back to the hotel in time, the front desk also extended the time for us, thank them very much for their service.

msg:I can only describe my stay as speechless. The curtains were broken when I first checked in. The hotel called the master to repair them. It was not the first time that the curtains were broken when I saw the marks on the wall. Because I really don’t like to be disturbed when I stay in a hotel, I waited for more than ten minutes to do it myself. It was repaired, but then I discovered that there was a problem with the water in the rain area. After taking a shower, the water had already reached the corridor door. I almost slipped and fell several times while walking. The shower only had a hand-held shower head, which was very uncomfortable for tall people. Then I discovered the toilet. The circle is not clean, it looks like it has been used by the previous tenant. No matter how good-tempered I am, I can't stand it. I really don't like to be disturbed during my stay. I just briefly talked to the front desk after checking out. The hotel equipment is very average, with lighting and new decoration. The color tone is a bit advantageous. I ordered it because I looked at the new decoration and thought it would be cleaner. The others are no different from the economical ones. Five stars is too reluctant.

msg:🚗 Transportation: Adjacent to Wangfujing Street, the bus and subway are very convenient!
🧹 Hygiene: The room is very clean, spacious and bright
🍃Environment: Entering the lobby, the environment is very good. It is worthy of being a newly renovated hotel, and it meets the five-star furnishing standard
🔔Service: The service of the front desk staff during the check-in process is very good. The two managers, Lulu and Xu Fei, also kindly told me that it is best to do nucleic acid after arriving in Beijing. Ryan, the guest relations manager, had contacted me intimately before asking about my room According to the requirements, the overall hotel equipment, facilities, and service are very good. I am very satisfied with this stay!

msg:The hotel has been selected for a long time, and the score of this hotel is very high, as expected. The day before I came to the hotel, I received Ryan, the guest manager who was specially responsible for receiving me. The location and hardware had nothing to say. The attitude of the service staff is very good, any problems can be solved in time, and the butler service is very meticulous. Maybe the hotel is still very new because it has just opened, and the facilities are more user-friendly. The aunt on the floor is very enthusiastic. The hotel sent a fruit plate and a very thoughtful little greeting card. The room feels very similar to the St. Regis decoration style I once lived in in Qingdao. The only thing is that the room may still have a little bit of smell. I am more sensitive to the smell. There was something in the afternoon, and the cute little girl Mandy specially delayed it until 3 o'clock for me. The front desk told me that the swimming pool was not open. It's a little pity, but the overall hotel facilities are good and the service is the best! Still more recommended!

msg:The service staff are all online, with a good attitude and good service. When checking in, ask if you have done a nucleic acid test recently;

There is a turn-down service in the evening, which can be regarded as a bedtime a**osphere, but when YQ is a little nervous, it is recommended to inform the guests in advance if they need it. need.

The sink is not deep enough, the water from the faucet is too close to the edge of the sink, and it is easy to touch the sink when washing hands.

Landscape bluetooth speakers, two plugs at the back, and the unplugged fork bluetooth is more convenient.

There is only one Wi-Fi in the hotel, it is recommended to divide the room or give it by mobile phone number.

There are few people in the restaurant on the first floor, but eating is very leisurely.
Try the Hong Kong restaurant on the second floor.

The location is too convenient, it is good to ride a bicycle into the hutong and go to Jingshan and Beihai.

msg:I was busy with work after the holiday, and it was not until the night before Valentine's Day that I discussed with my wife to choose a hotel near my unit to spend this holiday. The nearby hotels retrieved by Ctrip were either too expensive or rather rustic, not in line with the tune of Western festivals. Fortunately, I found this old hotel that has just been renovated and opened.

Because I am a Ctrip Platinum Card, the exclusive gift package not only includes late check-out, but also 4 hours early opening of the room, so I made an appoin**ent with my wife to come to open the room in the morning, and we can eat together near the unit at noon. In the morning, we received a call from hotel manager Ryan, informing us that the room is ready and the welcome fruit is ready. It seems that the hotel is very considerate.

This time I feel that the hotel pays great attention to the artistic a**osphere. The theme of the lobby is all kinds of bronze horses, which have the aesthetic characteristics of the Tang Dynasty. Different corners are decorated with old-fashioned suitcases, which enrich the visual effect. The artistic a**osphere is very suitable for future customers. After all, the hotel is located in Guardian The auction is directly opposite, and it is estimated that the people participating in the auction have convenient accommodation, moderate prices and good taste.

The staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic. The doorman will take the initiative to help open the door, give directions and ask for a car. He can also remember who is the resident here, and he will not repeatedly ask for the health code. It may be that the initial occupancy rate is not high. Any employee will greet you very friendly and help you press the elevator. A little detail will make the guests very comfortable, so you must insist.

The room we stayed in was not big and could not reach a five-star area, but the children were exquisite, the toiletries were of good quality, and the towels and bathrobes were very comfortable. The bed in the double room is 2 meters wide, which can avoid mutual influence at night, but the mattress is slightly hard, which cannot reach the level of high-end international chains. The room is equipped with a humidifier, but it has not been filled with water in advance, and the user needs to pick it up by himself. It can be turned on in advance in the future.

唯一就是沒有送餐機器人，在北京點外賣還是有必要的，因為好多飯店排隊太誇張了，沒有送餐機器人每趟下去拿還是有點麻煩。

1.交通便利 地鐵口可以説是近在咫尺 B口在酒店側面 D口在對面 都超級近距離 斜對面還有公交車站 111路可以到景山公園和北海 我們帶着孩子去動物園也是坐的111路 交通實在是很方便
疲憊的旅行途中 選擇一個交通方便的酒店真的很明智
2.服務 剛到酒店門口就有員工主動過來拿行李 
看見我們帶了小朋友前台還給升級了房間 床也很舒服 2米的床一家三口可以睡得很舒服了 出門前房間按下打掃鍵 阿姨也會過來打掃
退房時落下了藍牙耳機 也主動聯繫我們
整體來説都非常滿意 下次去北京還是會選擇華僑

酒店的裝修風格有點模仿（瑰麗）酒店的深色風格，但是房間設施不好，地毯特別的臟，有明顯污跡，一直提醒小孩不要光腳踩。
到達當天必須下午 2 點之後才入住，看見不少客人在沙發區等候，也沒有座位了。
早餐的品類特別少，連住四天基本上是一碗米粉和一杯咖啡，幾片水果。

客房比較擁擠，跟快捷酒店比的話大概就是多了個浴缸吧…因為洗漱台真的很窄放不下多少東西。為了省空間廁所和淋浴間共用一個趟門，多少有點不方便。
帶孩子的家庭需要注意一下早餐，一家三口、孩子還沒到需要單獨一個床位的年齡、但又超過6歲，如果訂了含早想帶着孩子一起用餐是不行的。必須要額外買半價票96.6。而且經理在落座後就會馬上問“孩子幾歲了”，但並不會事先主動告訴你他們的收費門檻，入住的時候前台也沒有告知，就是打家長一個措手不及的感覺。住過不少四星五星，還是頭一次遇到這種…挺無語的。
另外一個就是外賣接收點在門外，雖然有個外賣櫃但如果櫃子沒有位置的話，外賣就衹能露天放着。冬天就約等於把熱乎的東西丟進冰櫃了。
酒店離王府井、東華門、天安門廣場其實蠻遠的，屬於那種打車起步價但走路半小時的位置，周邊吃飯的地方不多，要多走幾步。

大堂的雕塑也很喜歡！

去景點非常方便，都很近。地鐵站衹要穿過一個紅綠燈就到了（馬路對面）。

十字路口斜對面就是中國美術館，走過去十分鐘，超級推薦去看看美術書上的作品的真跡！

如果再去北京還會選擇這裏！

酒店每一位服務員都特別親切，打掃衞生的大姐做的很乾凈，看我們帶着孩子，天氣最熱的一天送了我們6瓶水。衞生也非常及時，還幫我疊衣服。
要強烈表揚一樓餐廳的美女，我第二天在午門崴腳，美女看我跛着回來，專門送來冰塊，在我離店的時候，前台小哥都還在關心我腳好了沒有。
酒店外觀漂亮，有韻味，內裏剛剛裝修，很有藝術氣息，不虧在美術館對面。
最後要贊👍一下酒店地理位置。北京是真堵，酒店離8號線1分鐘路程，太讚了。有朋友來，我一點會推薦華僑。

酒店禮賓部小朱，為人非常的熱情幾乎對於客人的要求是有求必應，無所不能。他個人對於北京的瞭解特別的深厚，介紹了我們不可錯過，必”打卡‘’的景點好讓我們在短短的5天內把北京給看透透。贊👍 

下次還我們還要入住‘’北京華僑大廈睿世酒店‘’這是一個值得推薦的酒店。

msg:首先，先説優點：房間設施方便 自動窗簾窗紗和單獨分開的洗漱台和化粧區域。設施很新。客房服務OK。

其次，缺點是我覺得一個高端酒店不該犯的一些錯誤；1. 外賣到了，我穿着睡衣不方便下去拿，打客房服務 居然跟我説不提供此服務 需要客人自己下去拿，外賣櫃在外面，沒有暖氣。2. 化粧鏡 燈帶設計不符，衹有一側有燈帶另一側是暗的，我每次衹能靠着右側藉著燈化粧，可能酒店也知道這個設計不好 提供了一個小的化粧鏡，但是沒有裝電池，低級錯誤。3. 健身房沒有開，北京傍晚比較冷 我沒有帶足夠的衣服出門鍛鍊，以為健身房是開的 但是到了才告訴我在檢修。

希望酒店改正，下回我會選擇體驗別的酒店。

服務：第一天13點到店辦入住，沒有房間，説是給免費升了房型，也要等，但是會先給房間號，然後寄存一下行李，就可以先出去玩了。
前台小姐姐很禮貌有耐心，感覺很好，出門前問迎賓的小哥哥附近哪裡買水，高温天的直接給拿了兩瓶，然後告訴我附近哪裡有超市，很到位，給個贊👍

環境：整個酒店內部是很新，裝修現代化，大堂簡約又大氣，進入房間卻很温馨，一下子放鬆了，隔音也還可以，除了隔壁開門關門會有點聲音，不會有其他噪音

衞生：還是挺乾淨的，每天也會來認真整理打掃，小童洗漱用品衹有拖鞋和牙刷，建議來住的朋友自備一下其他東西，大人的是歐瓏的，香味可以的


設施：有音響，冰箱容量也夠用了，空調可以根據自己的習慣調節，馬桶不是智能的，浴缸足夠大，去長城淋了大雨回來泡澡沒有感冒

這次帶孩子來的，下次帶家裡長者來應該還會選這裏

2、行李箱密碼鎖突然卡住，怎麼都打不開，電話聯繫了前台，感謝“李茂正師傅”快速地解決了我的燃眉之急，巧妙地保住了我的箱子！
3、行程突然有變需要5:30早起，趕不上早餐，告知酒店後，貼心地幫忙準備了早點，並且種類豐富！

房間大小適中，乾淨整潔，雙床房很舒適，床品也不錯，衹是大多數酒店枕頭都很軟不太習慣。早上房間打掃很及時，下樓吃個早飯，回來阿姨已經把房間打掃好了👍🏻
早餐中西樣式比較齊全，口味不錯，服務員會引導安排座位👍🏻
前台幾位美女帥哥服務熱情，動作麻利，入住和退房開票、退按金等操作流利，無需等待👍🏻
交通便利是一大優勢，出門路口即是8號線美術館站，京城大小景點幾乎全部覆蓋，換乘方便。騎車也可到王府井、天安門，初秋的早晚都很涼爽，騎車出行自在又舒服。
酒店總體評價五星⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐推薦大家入住體驗✌🏻️✌🏻️✌🏻️

msg:首先位置很棒，隔一條馬路就是8號線美術館地鐵站，怕北京出行打車回堵，所以出門搭地鐵很方便。一樓大堂比較高大上，房間乾淨整潔，自帶了床單，雖然叮囑了前台不用每天更換床上用品，但是阿姨每天都會進入打掃衞生，收拾的也很整齊。以為早餐會有北京炸醬麪之類的，結果沒有，每天變化不多，基本和其他酒店差不多。沒有洗衣房，衣服需要送到外面洗，比較不方便。在外面玩的很累就回酒店點了幾次外賣，外賣衹送到前台，不給送到房間，需要自己下樓取，這一點甚至不如一些快捷酒店，會有機器人送到門口。有一天下雨，鞋子打濕了就打電話問前台有沒有幹鞋器，總之就是態度很好，要什麼就是沒有。感覺服務這塊還是欠缺一些。

2.內在不行呀，房間細節較為一般，然後浴室不大還放一個這麼大的浴缸浪費空間，感覺很雞肋。
3.隔音很差，走廊外面有人説話路過房間都能聽得很大聲。隔壁房聽歌唱歌也很吵。
服務：1.門口的服務生會主動開門且主動幫拿行李，這個是肯定的。
2.到店前一天會有客服資訊，這個服務也是值得稱讚。
3.可是店裡的客房就真的跟不上了，客房服務接線員態度惡劣，打電話客人還沒説完就給你掛掉了……很不耐煩。
4.還有一個很扣分的地方，辦理入住時酒店方主動説攜程金鑽會員給你升級房間還給你送迷你吧暢飲，然而到達房間給前台再打電話確認迷你吧是否收費，卻給我説衹能喝可樂雪碧那些，氣泡水巧克力那些貴的商品不送。就覺得好搞笑了，送不起可以不送呀😂吝嗇又裝大方。
所以，我覺得酒店地理位置很優越不可否認。但是對比上酒店的價格，房間這樣的服務和設施配套是不太理想。這家酒店有優點也有缺點，就大家自己衡量一下吧。

服務：酒店大堂等待座位較少，基本都是消費位。辦理退房很慢，查房完畢且已沒有其他客人時也不主動告知，還要自己主動再過去問現在可不可以繼續辦理退房了。
環境：地理位置優越，距離地鐵口就一個馬路的距離。周邊安靜不會吵，衹是房間私密性差些，由於大廈造型像沙發內扣的形態，不拉窗簾時能看到旁邊房間的窗前情況。

值得一提的是酒店工作人員都非常熱成，服務特別周到。在我離店後由於個人原因出現一些狀況，大堂的工作人員Gary耐心幫我決絕，非常感謝他！下次去北京還會選擇這裏💖

最奇葩的服務，着急要一份文件，去前台打印，一張A4紙要20元，我説這麼貴啊，接待我們的員工説“如果不想打就去酒店對面廣告店那裡也可以。”很有禮貌的一句迴應。這不是着急嗎就沒工夫再出去了。接着拿出了他個人收款碼收了我20元。
在三亞上網課時打了好多試卷酒店都沒提出收費，這個比較之下讓我覺得服務拉垮。

msg:入住體驗：這個酒店屬於老樓翻新，北京多數五星酒店都較老，但內部裝修不錯還比較新，給我們開始安排的房間隔壁是工作間很吵，白天一直有工作人員説話開門非常吵不隔音，在與前台溝通後很快給我們調換了房間，工作人員帶我們確認房間，態度很好值得點贊。存在問題：12:30房間不能辦理入住，直到14:30後才入住，讓客人等太久！整個樓道比較窄，時常看到幾個阿姨推着幾個整理車把樓道堵着，這點希望改進！

硬件也不錯，備品是歐瓏。
但酒店工作人員服務較差，是大減分項！check in時無人引導和幫忙開門、拿行李，基本的訊息比如早餐時間、電梯在哪裡等都是問一句答一句。打電話多要一小袋化粧棉，居然説酒店沒有這個東西，請問你們備品裏的化粧棉是哪裡來的？！而且比較“功利心”，讓人很不舒服！
1.前台一位女性工作人員幫忙打印資料後告知本來要收費10元一張，給我免費，讓寫評價時點名表揚她。2.退房時在房間遺漏了手錶，請酒店幫忙尋找和保管，回去拿手錶時，一位男性工作人員也讓寫評價點名表揚他。
請問酒店是有點名表揚KPI嗎？！本來是兩件加分的事，如果那兩位工作人員不那麼功利要求點名表揚，我反而會主動寫好評。

很多細節需要提升：
1.入住第一天下水道堵住+枕頭莫名黑色水漬
2.第二天洗浴用品沒用完的全部收走也沒給補新的
3.床上的衣服不會疊，隨手扔在床/枕頭上
4.酒店剛進房間會有一些木頭的裝修味
不過還好打電話還會處理。希望以後多注意吧。

衹有幾個小問題:
①房間地板踩上去會嘎吱響，夜裡擔心吵醒家人
②入住當天淋浴房地墊拿起來發現是濕的
③垃圾桶不套垃圾袋，不知是否出於環保考慮。但衞生間沒垃圾袋着實讓人扔不下去手，好奇沒有垃圾袋的情況下如何能保證衞生。

1.正式入住後，房間被罩下面有一坨黑色的東西，打電話叫前台換個被罩就行，短髮的保潔人員進來後説這是你的黑褲子蹭的吧，説著拿手把我褲子往床單上蹭，發現沒有後還一直再説，我都愣住了，隨後戴眼鏡的一個男主管進來送水説不好意思，我們其實壓根什麼事沒有就想臟了換個被罩就這麼簡單，結果這位保潔大姐還一直再跟這個男主管説是她褲子蹭的，我估計是怕人説她扣她錢，想想算了也不容易，換被罩的時候我母親好心問，我幫你一起換吧，這大姐沒好氣的説不用，走的時候連門都不帶關的；2.在12.5凌晨5：30的時候我發現出現彈窗1了，非常着急因為要帶母親看病，下樓去找前台想尋求幫助，一位短髮戴眼鏡的女工作人員全程跟我説的最多的話就是沒法報社區，以及報了沒用這些話，並且讓我自己申訴解決，以及説昨天已經告知你了肯定會彈窗，我也住過北京市其他五星級酒店，以前也出現過彈窗這種問題，酒店也都非常熱心的幫忙解決，怎麼到貴酒店這兒了就什麼都不行呢，後來我氣不過開始聯繫攜程尋求幫助，結果攜程出現以後，九點多就有經理幫忙開始聯繫解決，我想跟貴酒店説的是有時候申訴或者不申訴結果可能是一致的，但有的特殊情況是能處理的，但是你連申訴的舉動都不願意幫客户解決，這是態度問題。這位工作人員應該感激全國放開了，彈窗過兩天自動解除了，否則我絕對是要投訴你的。就你這個服務態度，換一個比我厲害的估計你也受不了。
3.在彈窗的這幾天中，酒店前台打來電話告知我中餐廳可以堂食了，我以為我們這種彈窗的也可以，就帶着母親去到了中餐廳，去中餐廳要掃碼， 我説我是住店客人 ，但是彈窗了 ，門口的小姑娘説那您稍等一下我問一下，跑進去問他們同事了， 你們同事聲音非常大的回覆， 彈窗了不隔離了嗎 接待不了，非常嫌棄的語氣讓你們同事出來跟我們説 ，讓我點外賣，她可能以為我聽不清，但是你們的門是開着的，這位回覆我的同事，我想説你作為北京當地五星酒店的工作人員連最基本的防疫常識及服務常識都沒有，不是所有彈窗都要被隔離，也不是因為我們陽性所以出現彈窗，我們可以不吃，你完全可以好好説，你們打電話叫客户來用餐不也是掙錢的嗎，你們就這麼對待客户嗎？我反應問題以後，閆經理帶着中餐廳經理來道歉，並送個果盤，説實話，入住這八天，要不閆經理幫忙協調溝通解決，我真是不想給你好臉，誰稀罕你的破果盤，還難吃，有這功夫提高一下自己的職業素養，比送果盤有用多了。
4.入住期間的核酸都是閆經理幫忙協調溝通，解決我們很多問題，希望你們的同事都向閆經理學習，客户有需求幫忙解決，熱心耐心 ，旅客自然會給好評，下次也會入住。
5.酒店地理位置不錯，裝修也好，床品不錯舒服，早餐也挺好吃，除了個別從業人員服務差，其餘挺好。

所有人員的服務都很積極主動，會提前聯繫，詢問入住需求，因為要過生日還提前幫忙佈置了房間，@Gray小哥還提前加了微信，瞭解具體需求，忙前忙後，真是人帥服務熱情周到。
總體是一家情侶，旅遊，度假首選的酒店。

msg:早就關注了這個新開酒店然後終於開業了首先講講服務

🔔服務：
真的沒話説
提前電聯然後wx一直在給我提供幫助
入住賀卡和歡迎水果
吧枱的水345ml那麼小一瓶我要了十幾給我了真棒

✨房間設施：
1.我一開始是衝著那個盆栽覺得特靈
到了才發現人家是假的…😂
2.房間不是很大然後雙床加寬了讓房間感覺更侷促
3.室內的中央空調不能調所以温度是控制死的…
4.浴缸放水後後麪的洗漱台會積水恰恰枱子上還放了浴巾…
4.新入住抽紙抽了3-5次吧就沒有了…
5.沒有吧枱的餐飲手冊和房內的軟飲零食的售價介紹
小姐姐説在電視上掃碼點餐但是也不是我要的小菜單
6.電視聲音巨小…也沒有通到浴室的音響…
哦倒是有一個小音響 山水的衹能説一般…
7.洗面台的大小也很侷促放了這就放不了那了
8.馬桶雖然很貴但耐不住冬天坐上去還是會令人抖一激靈不是…有個枱子放物品這點我喜歡
9.垃圾桶我能理解為了顏值而不套袋子但是要很麻煩的清潔我強迫症真的有點為阿姨擔心…
10.屋子裡還是有新裝氣味 雖然感謝客房服務為我們拿來凈化器但是真的睡覺的時候也不能開因為真的吵…
11.衞生間和洗漱洗浴區域的推拉門也許因為新裝修特別難推也許是想使空間變大這樣的裝修但是也很一般
12.洗漱用品説實話不是很好用提供的倒還算全面
13.外賣不送沒有機器人讓自己下樓取遇到個小姐姐幫我取了但假如我沒遇到呢……
細節控對不住啦

🥛早餐：
看着挺多 實則一般 沒啥吃頭

🧹衞生：
吧枱上面落灰了親該擦擦了

🌅房間景觀：
看了東邊 北邊 南邊 西邊 
最後選了北邊…可選項中算是視野較開闊了…

🏊‍♀️游泳池：
沒裝修好沒開

🏋🏻‍♀️健身房：
有但沒去過

對了我權益有升房但是沒升是因為沒裝修好？希望我下次光臨給我升？我也許不回去了……

服務很好，免費升級了房型，還送了種類不少的歡迎水果，註冊一下酒店會員迷你吧免費，都挺貼心的。
房間結構設計感很強，浴室有特色，還有房間中鏡子的運用，需要住客慢慢感受。
床和枕頭軟硬適中，個人比較喜歡。洗護飲品用的歐龍，浴袍挺有意思，帶帽子，方便洗後幹發，避免着涼。
美中不足，停車場衹有地上，車位不多，而且比較貴，15元一小時，還沒有發票。

衞生及設施：酒店整體乾淨整潔，床單毛巾等用品服務人員都有及時更換，洗漱用品配備的十分全面。房間裏可以連藍牙音響 真的很加分，還有各種充電設備，後來還在房間裏看到了瑜伽墊哈哈，可以隨時鍛鍊。酒店的健身房也是24小時的，非常方便。

🔔服務：如果體驗感10分的話 9分都來自於酒店的服務人員。Vicky小姐姐從下單起就及時聯繫，入住的時候還送了歡迎果盤，很貼心。後來Cenciyia還給減免了停車費，各種服務真的很到位。

交通：在地鐵8號線美術館站，出站就到，衹需要2站到王府井可換乘1號線，酒店附近300米有一個核酸點，非常方便！

衞生：五星級酒店的乾淨程度沒話説，房間也會每天打掃，住得放心。

環境：酒店大堂大氣，沉穩，房間也不小，在王府井大街上，能找到1.35米的雙床房，還是五星酒店，價格還這麼划算，我已經推薦給朋友了！

服務：從進門的迎賓到前台，到餐廳，客房服務，無時不刻感受到温暖。服務非常棒！

小tips：可能是因為剛剛新裝開業，服務人員要好評有點兒過於積極了，甚至可以幫客人編輯好評……可以理解，但不建議。可以適當提醒客人一次，但網上線下都説了好幾次，難免會給客人完成不適感，適得其反。各位要對你們的酒店有信心，確實很優秀，這段好評也是我自己編輯的，有感而發才更真實有價值。望調整保持。

✨環境滿分：整體感覺裝修風格低調奢華很顯品味，房間打掃的很乾凈，床品和備品手感舒適質感極佳，不到一千的價格物超所值。
可惜行程比較匆忙忘記拍照，下次去王府井活動還會預訂這家酒店。

msg:實話實説，位置確實不錯，酒店設計也用了心思，所到之處都值得品味，就是走廊裏裝修的味道還是挺大的。某書上安利説可以看到故宮火速訂了房，結果到了酒店説能看到故宮的高樓層還沒開放，所以為了看故宮的姐妹移步吧。
服務：這是給差評的最重要原因，最直觀的感覺就是在處理客户關係上的方式真的讓人不舒服，“有一種你看啊我在為你服務啊，我們服務很好哦”真的很刻意很不自然，也並沒有感受到什麼切實的服務。
入住前一天有打電話過來問大概幾點到酒店，我説大概上午八點半左右，給你一種來了就可以辦理入住的錯覺，我們下了高鐵到達酒店，因為沒打掃好不能入住，房態無法控制這個可以理解，八點半也確實是提前入住了，那你打這個電話的目的是什麼呢？閑聊嗎？如果客房都是滿的無法確定入住時間，已經致電了可以告訴我晚點再來或者提醒我合理安排一下，因為剛下高鐵想着進房間收拾一下再出發去玩，就在酒店吃了早餐，我表達了可以單獨付費吃早餐，前台還在跟我確定房間號，我連入住都沒入住怎麼知道房間號。

服務：我們四個人定了兩間房，第一天訂的都是含早的，開房的時候就表示第二天要續住，並且除了第一天房費以外還付了4000元按金，第二天看完升旗回來吃早餐已經落座開吃以後説我們又不含早了，我去前台問，發現另一個房間的小夥伴又單獨付了兩間房的錢，前台也沒跟他説我已經付過按金了，他定的比第一天貴而且又不含早了，問了小夥伴説她表示同樣的房型續住然後前台用他的手機操作的，此時前台跟我對話的意思是我不知道你定的就是不含早，我也沒懂我早餐怎麼就沒有了？我4000元按金和説好的續住怎麼就沒有了？因為三位小夥伴已經在裏面吃上飯了，再一個大早上去看升旗已經很累了，懶得掰扯就説那自費早餐，前台説實在不好意思那你在**付三個人的錢就可以了，我説可以。因為吃早餐時間比較早餐廳裏衹有我們四個人，從始至終都是我們四個，這位經理也是走到我們四個人的桌邊説我們房間不含早，我當時理解的就是：不好意思，因為他們部門銜接的問題優惠一個人。結果核銷完券碼，這位又走到我們四個人面前説你們是四位嗎？剛才付的是三個人錢。我就很惱火了，我表示本來就是你們訂房的失誤我們也一直是四個人在一起，你讓我付三個人錢，現在又搞得好像我們幾個人是來蹭飯一樣的，一開始我進餐廳的時候我報了房間號你沒説我今天不含早，我吃上了你跟我説我不含早，你讓付三個人的錢，現在又説我少付了一個人，我真是莫名其妙了，結果經理又表示：“哦那不好意思那就這樣吧，那這份早餐就算是送你們的了。”所以你們的早餐到底是怎麼回事？怎麼弄我才能消停吃個早餐？酒店的早餐也沒有多好吃，麥當勞肯德基鹵煮炒肝豆漿油條外賣也挺香，在酒店吃就是圖個方便，裡外裏整不明白還生一肚子氣。

服務：從我們第一天來就一直有位女士拿着一堆東西坐在前台回酒店的必經之路上，在樓下喝東西的時候也能聽見他們在吵，也不知道什麼情況，進進出出還碰見兩三次警察。

因為怕乾燥，酒店格外給安排了加濕器，不過效果上沒有水霧加濕器效果好，聲音有點大，介意的話需要自己準備一個。餐飲方面早餐中式蔬菜樣式少，西式居多，不同口味的人基本可以滿足。完全不影響對酒店的認可，因為好評太多了。
