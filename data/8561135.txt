msg:The hotel service ceiling I have stayed in so far, the manor has a large area and low density of guests, good privacy, and is suitable for a secluded vacation. The housekeeper replied to WeChat in seconds, and the communication was pleasant.
I took my baby to experience the starry sky bubble room. The advantages and disadvantages of the house material are obvious. There are two vertical air conditioners + floor heating in winter, which is not cold. The supplies include bath balls, bathtub covers and facial masks. It comes with a night bed and a good night cocktail. Each starry sky room has an independent small yard, which is also separated by hedges for privacy reasons.
The dog Amu has a great personality. He kept giving way to the two-year-old human cub during the Frisbee. I thought the baby was just running and jumping here, but I didn’t expect that the interaction with Amu was very happy.
The breakfast is also very exquisite. The style will be confirmed one day in advance. The plating and taste are great, which also makes me look forward to the catering service of the manor.
I spent a very relaxing weekend. If I have the opportunity, I will come back for a second look and experience other manors of the anadu brand.

msg:🏠Room/Environment:
On the first night, I stayed in the Starry Sky Bubble House, which was novel but not comfortable enough; the advantages were that it was interesting and had a large yard, and it was very comfortable to sit outside when the weather was good. The disadvantage was that it was unstoppably hot and bright in the morning, and those who could sleep until after 6:30 were all great people...
On the second night, I changed to another room and experienced Yingtian, wow~ If it is full marks 💯, then it is 💯. The room has a reasonable flow and very good hardware; it has a full sense of design, and the most difficult thing is to have a foundation. And there is a super big bed, full of happiness! If I have to say the disadvantages... Can you consider adding a wall-mounted shelf in the shower room? 🤦♀️There is no place to put shower gel.
🍜Food:
The Chinese lunch and dinner we reserved tasted very authentic (typical Zhejiang cuisine). At first, I thought the price of 280/person was a bit expensive (mainly because I didn’t have a big appetite), but after eating a meal, I knew how cost-effective it was... It is recommended that people with a small appetite do not take the entire recipe... You can appropriately reduce one or two dishes, otherwise it will be a waste.
As for breakfast, it is also completely unfinished! There are four types: two Chinese and two Western, all delicious, feel free to choose. But my favorite is the eel noodles. Although it is very heavy to eat this early in the morning, it is really delicious! 
🎮Play: 
The VR in the room is fun! My son couldn't stop playing in the dinosaur museum. Archery is not for children, and I was a little reluctant to draw the bow; there are not many entertainment activities, and Amu caught the frisbee as he wished, hahahahaha, happy. 
For the surrounding area, I recommend Yuanxiang Town, where you can play with your children for most of the day. There are not many people on holidays such as Qingming Festival. There is no queue for rafting in the morning, and the experience is very good! 
💇Service: 
How to say... blow it up... it's exaggerated. Before checking in, you will be pulled into a group of six people, except for you, all are staff and housekeepers. Ready all day, the response speed is within 15s... response to every request. Personally, it feels like a manor-style private customization. This room fee is paid willingly... 
In short, it is highly recommended, the ceiling in the B&B.

We booked Peace Manor before, but unfortunately it didn't accept children at that time and had to cancel. This time we tried the Starry Sky Bubble House first, which was quite special and the overall feeling was also very good. The butler service was still in place as always, and the Chinese dinner was also very delicious. Next time we will try Western food. It is pet-friendly and there are Border Collies to play Frisbee with you. The archery facilities are also very professional, and the gym is also very special. It is an excellent choice to book it for company team building.

In order to take photos of the ginkgo in late autumn, I continued to come to Changxing and decisively chose Peace Manor. The internal layout, style, and configuration of the two manors are almost the same. They provide reassuring accommodation services, free fruits, drinks, snacks, and goodnight drinks. The housekeeper is very considerate and just the right level of comfort. I had three dinners in the manor, which were very fresh and tasted good. When I left, I was given a souvenir of tea. The two small cans given by Olive Manor last time are still lying in my basket🤣

This was the first time that Peace Manor was open to children. I was a little nervous at first. I wondered if the children would find it boring. I didn’t expect that climbing, rowing, and Frisbee were so fun. There were also special people to accompany you. Adults could chat, drink, and dine in the manor without worrying about anything. They would help you add water when you were thirsty and spray mosquito repellent outdoors. You don’t have to worry about anything. This is a paradise for vacation! I heard that a new project was opened on Mosan Island. I will come again during the Chinese New Year. I look forward to getting better and better!

Usually, the work pressure is relatively high, but I like that kind of leisurely life. The manor meets all my ideas and is also very suitable for my living habits. I will go there often in the future. It is a good place to relax myself. I have the opportunity to experience the Olive Manor again

msg:I drove back to Shanghai from Jiangxi. I didn't want to be too tired, so I chose this hotel on the way back to rest for a day before returning. I booked a starry sky bubble house to experience it. You can see the stars when the lights are turned off at night, but it was too hot during the day the next day. The hotel has a butler service and is very kind to the guests. It happened that the roses picked by the butler were dried, so he immediately made a pot for us to taste. The feeling of staying in the bubble house is that you can feel close contact with nature, because it is generally transparent, but it is not suitable for hot weather. Next time when the weather is cooler, I will bring my children to experience it

msg:I went there for the 5-point reviews and the so-called high level of the chef. The bubble house is quite creative, but the window cannot be opened, it is too stuffy, it is very close to the road next to it, and the blower has to be turned on 24 hours a day, which is a bit noisy. I decisively added 1,500 yuan to upgrade to a room on the second floor. The hotel environment is still good. The dinner at the hotel was Western food, 1,280 per person, which was too unpalatable. I was fooled by some people's reviews, and it was also a matter of my own judgment. How could there be delicious Western food in the picturesque mountains? The hotel owner thought that the chef who had cooked Chinese food all his life in the village would focus on Western food. It's okay if it's not delicious, the price is catching up with the level of high-end restaurants in Shanghai. The price is expensive, but the ingredients are not worth the price at all, it's too rip-off, and it's also called Australian m9 Wagyu, speechless, it's all tendons. The quantity is also very small, and I had to add a portion of dumplings 😂 I advise everyone not to be ripped off by that Western food.

Environment: It is really better to come and experience it in person than to see it on the APP. The whole homestay is surrounded by mountains, the air is fresh, and the environment is beautiful.

Facilities: The starry sky bubble house is very unique, with air conditioning and floor heating, and it will not be cold in winter. It is equipped with rain showers and massage bathtubs. It is very comfortable to take a hot bath in winter. The only thing to note is to wear earplugs when sleeping at night😂

Service: Because it is a high-end homestay, a special housekeeper is specially arranged. Every staff member of the homestay is very friendly and the service is also great. You can book lunch or dinner in advance before departure. There are also cocktails or hot milk before going to bed at night. There are also many breakfast options, and they taste delicious

Coupled with the check-in experience and the beauty of the manor, I am already thinking about the time to come again next time. We originally planned for Leafing, and they helped us upgrade to listening bamboo before we came. There are afternoon tea, breakfast, and dinner packages. You don’t need to think about what to eat, and the key taste is also very good. Every scene in the manor was photographed for an hour while holding an umbrella in the rain. The supplies in the room are all available, all kinds of drinks and water, and the aromatherapy smells very good. Suggestion: I hope that the delayed check-out time can be humanized, and the light meals can be enriched. Our butler was Rei.

因為Anadu和平莊園，認識了一個叫長興-和平的地方，這裏隱居避世，安靜常寧，有毛孩子相伴，有鮮花作配，住進泡泡屋，夜幕降臨，抬頭便是星空✨ 

【服務】我們的私人管家八佰在我們到達前兩天就與我們取得聯繫，我們到達後更是熱情互動，每個細節都服務周到，讓我們有一種賓至如歸的感覺💕Check-in的時候，莊園管家讓我們品嚐了玫瑰茶和新鮮水果，並預約定製了第二天的早餐搭配。晚上八佰給我們一人遞上一杯熱牛奶，消除一天的疲憊🥛離店叫不到車，管家小姐姐不僅幫我們叫車，還送我們到距離莊園5公里的鎮上，八佰把我們送到莊園門口才離開，非常貼心！

【住宿】我們住在泡泡房🫧屋內環境整潔，全屋智能家電，兩個落地空調再也不怕早晚的温差。床的四周有帷幔，不怕早上刺眼的陽光，帶按摩功能的浴缸也是酒店少有的。BTW，這裏的果盤真的很好吃！🍇

【娛樂】五月是大馬士革玫瑰盛開的季節，清晨被陽光喚醒，采一筐玫瑰，體驗製作鮮花純露的樂趣。等待間隙，點一支香，伴着鳥鳴和禪意的音樂寫毛筆字。品嚐4-5月特有的大馬士革玫瑰茶🍵除此之外，莊園裡還能射箭、壓花、擼毛孩子們。這裏一步一景，無邊泳池、泡泡屋、餐廳&大堂、草坪&花園都能拍到人生照片📷

【餐食】這裏用餐採用提前預約制，食物有幾種套餐選擇，怎麼選都不會踩雷。入住當天的晚餐我們很驚喜地在酒店吃到到接地氣的美食，雞湯有家的味道，白灼蝦鮮甜，黑米飯的做法相當獨特；中式早餐的鱔絲麪讓我們讚不絕口，西式早餐的搭配也營養健康🥗每個餐桌上都有當日新鮮採摘的玫瑰和芍葯，在巨大的落地窗旁看着窗外滿眼的綠色，這樣的用餐環境是城市裡千金難求的。

泡泡屋體驗：原本擔心泡泡屋會悶因為是全封閉的，結果裏面非常涼爽，到晚上甚至很冷，不過後來了解到這是為了抗衡白天太陽熱量，第一晚關了結果第二天一早被熱醒，後來有經驗就不關空調了。每天早上七點左右就有工作人員拉上遮陽罩，會有點吵，但是民宿貼心準備了耳塞和眼罩，管家也會提前告知，所以並不會有太大影響
餐飲體驗：住進這裏就是真的與世隔絕，附近沒有餐廳，即使有吃完晚餐你要做好準備走過很長一段伸手不見五指的山路。不過我就是奔着與世隔絕來的，第二天抱着試一試的心態預訂了晚餐，結果把我和我老公都經驗到了！這廚藝真是完全不輸豪華五星級酒店大廚，味道鮮美，擺盤精緻，量也足，人均雖略高，但是也很值了
民宿的環境：真的很適合想要遠離塵世喧囂，靜下心來感受下鄉村的心曠神怡，還可以看書寫寫書法，再逗逗喵星人！民宿的布偶真的太！太！太！可愛了，每天起床個回到民宿第一時間就是去看貓！
希望下次換個季節再去看看Anadu的美景，品品美食，逗逗貓～

msg:這個酒店最大的問題就是周邊啥都沒有，連吃飯的地方都沒有，衹能在酒店呆著，吃酒店提供的餐飲。呆一晚還湊合，再多就很無聊了。

説是酒店，其實是民宿，房間不多。泡泡屋是特色，但是夏天去很熱，房間裏面也呆不牢。為解決這個問題，白天酒店會用布蓋住，不過這樣也失去了泡泡屋的意義。

沒地方可去，沒地方可玩，也衹適合網紅拍片了。性價比不高，不推薦

msg:二年前關注Anadu，是因為它的一個規則：不接待小童。對我這種有熊孩子恐懼症的人來説毫無意外有了興趣，其實國外一些精品酒店也都有這個規則，衹不過國內還是第一次看到。
選了一個夏日炎炎正好出伏的日子出行，一切都同我原先設想的一致，私密、安靜、人少景美（碩大的莊園除了外面分散的幾個獨立星空泡泡屋，其實主樓就3套房，後面小樓2套房，其他都是大片景觀空間）管家服務從入住到離開始終細緻入微，温暖周到，房間含早晚餐，早餐可按自己的喜好選不同類型的套餐品種，晚餐品種豐富又美味，份量也很足，食材新鮮，品質上佳，而且管家也會貼心的先詢問每個人的喜好及忌口，約定每位客人的用餐時間，這些都是讓人感覺温暖窩心的細節。
二晚的行程讓有些浮躁的心終於有了平和，放鬆的空間，夕陽下，在露台上吹着晚風看着對面山頂巨大的風車發呆，原來這個世界還是這樣安靜而美好。

實踐着夢幻理想的泡泡屋（兩個門不能一起開，泡泡會癟）居住體驗比想象的好，360度環繞立體聲音效也很奇妙
P.S. 無人機意外卡在二三十米的樹冠上了，4個園丁自由人齊心協力藉助升降梯🪜和兩節竹竿捆綁加長（我在下面等着拿桌布兜着[捂臉]），居然成功獲得解救，真是解決問題能力一流[嘿哈]

msg:服務滿分！！謝謝管家carl（還有另一位忘記問姓名的也是管家嗎？），服務可以説是有求必應、不厭其煩、恰到好處的熱情……甚至超過很多以前住過的帶管家服務的五、七星酒店。回來再想想有些不好意思，讓你們大熱天滿頭大汗的來回安排……還有一個就是拒絕14歲以下小童簡直太棒了，國內應該沒有這樣的酒店、都是利益至上難以捨棄親子這方面，👍老闆的定位。喜歡私密寧靜、恐熊孩子的人羣去長興旅遊的唯一最佳選擇。還有寵物友好這個也深得我心，可惜我家狗不在了，早點有這樣的酒店我狗應該每個月都會去小住散心。中餐口味滿分，我家人口味非常挑剔，也能讚不絕口，可見廚師水平～
