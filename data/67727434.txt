In addition, on the day of check-in, there happened to be a group of people having a class reunion, and they were still noisy in the middle of the night. In addition, the sound insulation of the hotel room was average, so it was quite annoying.

The waiter called me early to ask about my check-in time (and said to turn on the air conditioner early). It was so heartwarming. However, I had to go out to climb the mountain early the next day and didn’t have time to walk around. I will choose Anlan Island again if I have the chance. It’s a good place for a quiet and relaxing time!

msg:The hotel environment is still very good. There are two rows of dense bamboos at the entrance, which makes people feel particularly comfortable. It is surrounded by water on three sides, and there are stairs to walk to the water's edge. That feeling is so good! There is also a large infinity pool and open-air bar next to it. If you come here in summer, it must be very happy! But it is really shivering in winter. As for the hotel room, I think the sofa is really too hard! I thought it was a normal sofa, and it hurt so much when I sat down (＞﹏＜), and then the air conditioner was not particularly hot. It may also be that the temperature dropped in those two days. Anyway, I didn't feel particularly warm. There is also breakfast. There is really nothing to eat, not even basic noodles and wontons, because I don't like to drink porridge, and the temperature dropped in those two days, which really made me feel that I didn't feel hot in the morning. But the dinner is still good, the taste is good, and the service staff is also very enthusiastic. The service fee is added during the Chinese New Year. I can only say that I can understand it.

環境無可挑剔，早晨就見到渡假屋的服務人員在池子裏撈落葉，客房部的阿姨們樸實又可愛，我們訂了聯排水屋，帶了一個寶寶，在我們入住前酒店就給了一間可以加床的房間，第一個晚上我們去看了印象大紅袍，傾盆大雨，還沒回到酒店，服務人員就發來訊息表示給我們準備了熱薑茶，早餐送到房間，每天的菜式都有微微變化，絕對是渡假上等的選擇啦！
酒店離三姑景區15分鐘車程，鬧中取靜的島嶼上，非常的悠閑，適合所有類型的旅行！

1. 地方有點怪，進出兩邊都是橋，晚上開車，黑燈瞎火很難找。

3. 入住的時候很熱情，專門出來幫忙拿東西。走的時候很冷漠，幾個人看着我們大包小包也不動一下，還追問我們結賬沒有。
4. 附近沒有商店，餐廳，想自己解決吃飯和零食，難得要命
5. 油漆和新裝修的味道很重
6，價格是五星的，服務和態度是二星。

安瀾島酒店有些隱於市的感覺，
位於不喧囂的江邊，很安靜；大環境很棒。
房間設施也非常好。乾淨整潔。
服務很貼心。對客人很周到。
對客人的要求都盡心盡力解決和滿足。
酒店的茶室提供給客人使用，可以自行泡酒店提供的巖茶。高樅水仙蠻不錯的。
性價比蠻高的度假酒店。

msg:環境不錯，有水有風景，但酒店位置坐落於農村，服務人員可能也來自周邊，所以帶有強烈的農家樂風格。給我們的酒杯明明很臟，但堅持説乾淨，結果我們自己洗了半小時才能用（因為沒有洗潔精）。再者，也許基於能省點就省點吧，很多地方燈都不亮堂，大概認為人不多沒必要吧，但這就是農家樂思想。

酒店免費供應的安瀾茶也不錯，值的品嚐！另買了2盒，性價比高！

前台服務態度很好！

如果説不足的話，顯然是早餐！（早餐衹有經濟型快捷酒店的水平），完全配不上酒店的等級與價位！因為這個價位都可以住悦華，大紅袍山莊了！
