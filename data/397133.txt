This was disappointing as it was one of tbe reasons we had booked that hotel. Not only did they rectify the fridge within an hour/( minutes?), they also sent up a lovely tray with local treats and  they offered us breakfast on the house. We could n't  get the spa experience, but felt the manager, Frank, did his very best to make our visit special, and we were so appreciative. We would definitely book again, but know to check a few things beforehand in case the website is not up to date. At any rate, StRegis stands by its service and the manager was excellent. Kudos to Frank Wang!

msg:Disappointing. 
1. Was greeted poorly upon arrival by front desk staff who not only spoke close to no English but had terrible attitudes. 2. We were initially ignored when we said we wanted to check in and were only attended to, albeit rather rudely, when we repeated ourselves.
3. It totally spoiled our first impression of The St. Regis as we expected at the very least, basic courtesy at check in from an establishment which brands itself as a "luxury hotel" 
4. The front desk staff's command of English was so poor that they told us check out time was at 8pm, only corrected after we clarified. The staff was also unable to confirm if payment was made, and we had to type it out on our phones to verify that payment will be deducted from a deposit. 
5. None of the other usual information (eg. Wifi details, pool/gym opening hours was relayed to us). 
6. Poor cleanliness at some areas: Additionally, plates at breakfast were dirty (brown liquid stains on them) and there was litter in the elevators. 
7. Management really ought to invest in training the staff better.
8. On our part, we really would not recommend visitors to Tianjin to stay at The St. Regis. Your money would be better spent elsewhere.

msg:Checked in on a Friday afternoon. Chevk in process was a little convoluted as there is only one keypad for international cards that require a pass code. I find this strange for an international hotel chain. 
The room was clean. The furniture a little dated as well as the air conditioning system. Sadly, not many sockets available near to a mirror and no "beauty/ make up station" making getting ready a difficult task. But there is a huge desk in the room instead, to hold a telephone and a room overview (there is not much useful information in this document, for example no room service menu or spa menu). 
The air conditioning unit did not work in my room, staff tried to convince me that it was because of ever changing reasons including "the direction your room faces is the reason the room is warmer" and "it works but you can't change the temperature to colder as its controlled by a central system so all the rooms are the same". I was initially offered to change room or have maintenance check. I chose maintenance in the first instance as i believed it was a setting on the AC box that had a glitch. After waiting for maintenance for around 2 hours there was nothing they were able to do. Only when I mentioned my stay at St Regis in Chengdu a few nights earlier where mt AC unit worked perfectly at 18°C was I taken seriously. The staff generally were very helpful in finding me a different room with AC that worked which I'm very thankful for as I would not have been able to sleep in the first room with no AC. 
I would stay again, mostly due its good location and the pleasant staff. Also, I would stay in hope that my stay would be smoother so I could enjoy my stay.

Everything a disaster! I feel strange such a service for guests in a 5 star hotel? 
Even if there are some events first your announce before booking, second you make proper measures such a event won’t bother guests whom are staying there! Management definitely failed. By far worse stay in any 5 star hotel!

Facilities: The south gate of the hotel leads directly to Haihe River. There are also convenient scenic seats at the entrance. It is quite comfortable to sit here. The bathroom is relatively large, and it is difficult to switch the shower head. There are relatively few TV channels. The buffet restaurant is not large, and there are not many types of breakfast. I think the taste is okay.

Other public facilities are not evaluated without experience.

Service: The hotel Butler called one day in advance to inquire about the check-in requirements; the front desk service was very good, and the information around the hotel was introduced enthusiastically. The room was arranged after arriving at the store in advance and the waiting time was not long.

The overall check-in experience is OK for the price, but it feels a bit lacking for the St. Regis brand.

The hotel, with its ultimate luxury and quality, has created a refreshing environment for guests, making every detail exude elegance and comfort. Staying on the 12th floor with a 90-degree view, the lights are dim at night and the scenery is pleasant, which makes people feel happy! Especially the front desk lady Tracy, who is gentle and polite and has a strong sense of service. She enthusiastically guided my old mother and me to the elevator entrance, and told the hotel about the relevant districts and the Haihe River viewing area, showing professionalism! The bedding is also very comfortable, and a fruit plate is also given. The sense of detail is very good, and the environment and sanitation are also very clean. A wonderful experience! The country is developing stronger and stronger, and domestic hotels are also thriving, and the service environment is not inferior to the international one! I will recommend it to my relatives and friends! May the hotel business prosper! Star-level leap, to a higher level! Thank you Tracy, thank you hotel🥂🥂

Breakfast has multi-grain seasoned oatmeal, the quality and appearance of the breakfast room are great. It must be nice to sit by the Haihe River for breakfast when the weather is good.
The St. Regis brand still has the persistence of an old hotel. There is still a saber champagne event at 6 or 7 in the evening. I went to have a glass of wine and had a good time.
In short, it is recommended and will come again!

msg:The best choice for traveling with kids! The location is great, the butler service is very considerate. After arriving at the hotel, we upgraded to a parent-child suite, which is very good. Children can see the night view of the Haihe River, cruise ships, Ferris wheel, Dagu Bridge, Jiefang Bridge, etc. without going out. Both adults and children like the Octonauts in the room. During the May Day holiday, we also caught up with the music festival, which was very exciting! After leaving the hotel restaurant, you will reach the Haihe River. It is very comfortable to stroll along the Haihe River at night and in the morning!

I will choose St. Regis again next time when I bring my kids.

Attentive service. I only had simple luggage and the butler helped me to take it upstairs.
The room temperature is suitable. People who are afraid of heat are really afraid of the high temperature on the upper floors. The mattress is comfortable. Some facilities are a little old, but it doesn't matter.
The breakfast is rich in variety and the coffee is delicious. The service staff is very conscious.

Geographical location: The Italian-style street is on the other side of the river. With the hotel as the center, the Ancient Culture Street, Jinwan Square, Wudadao and other scenic spots are all about three kilometers away.
Guest room facilities: Although the guest rooms have a sense of age, they are cleaned very cleanly and have a night bed service. The guest room supplies and drinking water are also very sufficient. Thanks to the hotel's arrangement, I upgraded to the Supreme River View Room. Not only is the room area large, but you can also enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Haihe River while lying on the bed (I also saw the Internet celebrity grandfather diving and swimming).
Hotel service: The housekeeper contacted in advance to understand the check-in time and needs, and the check-in gift prepared was also very attentive. Room coffee and milk are available 24 hours a day. Every service staff I met in the hotel is enthusiastic and professional.
Next time I come to Tianjin, I will continue to choose St. Regis!

msg:The hotel is by the Haihe River. It was very pleasant to take the children for a walk by the river after dinner. The appearance of the hotel is a bit like a large mirror frame in the United Arab Emirates, with a strong sense of art.
The housekeeper was enthusiastic and gave away fruits. When the child said he wanted to eat watermelon, the housekeeper specially gave him a happy time meal voucher (because he ate the buffet late at the hotel and finally didn't go). Thank you for the housekeeper.
The hotel's dedicated parking lot is at B3, and the signs are very clear.
The hotel forgot to put tea bags, and the waiter specially made 4 cups and sent them to the room.
There are many varieties of breakfast, which also highlights the characteristics of Tianjin.
The child has been talking about staying at St. Regis for many days after returning, because the housekeeper is a beautiful aunt.

msg:The facilities in the room are relatively old, the shower head is very tight and cannot be used at all, the toilet seat is very old and does not look clean, and the bath towels are not updated enough, resulting in a lot of lint, which is not in line with St. Regis' positioning! The room check-in request at the front desk was not consistent with the information communicated in advance by the housekeeper. The housekeeper service was in name only and I could not feel the service enthusiasm that I should have. It was quite satisfactory! The service at the buffet manager level is very professional, while the ordinary waiters are relatively lazy. When you ask him questions, you think he is a deaf-mute at first, but later you find out that he is a normal person! The chef seems to use gloves to handle food very cleanly. The key is to wear gloves to clean up his mask and handle other non-food items. It is very unprofessional! Either a fork or chopsticks are missing from the cutlery set! The bartender answered questions in a nonchalant manner! The location of the hotel is really good, the surrounding environment is good, and it is very close to the Italian Style Street! The stools at the bottom of the buffet table are not hygienic and are oily! It seems that ordinary employees do not have enough sense of responsibility in various positions! Generally speaking, it does not meet the positioning of St. Regis!

Advantages: large room, thoughtful service, polite staff, good swimming pool temperature, very clean.
Disadvantages are that it is a little old, the configuration is a little low-grade, and there are no welcome fruits and snacks.
In short, St. Regis is a hotel with high cost performance and the building is also very grand. I hope it will get better and better. Thanks to every staff member.

After that, they arranged the room for us very carefully. As soon as we entered the lobby, we saw the fountain and crystal lanterns. It’s very nice. Since this is my first time in Tianjin, the butlers have been very patient in providing us with services. Thank you to the butlers. The service attitude is really good, professional and enthusiastic. We also had breakfast. It tasted good and the variety was very rich. We were invited to participate in the evening. After the nightfall ceremony, the sense of ritual was still very full. When I returned to the room in the evening, I was given a small cake for my girlfriend and I to eat together. But I think the only drawback is that my girlfriend had a stomachache. I asked for hot milk and she got two. I don’t know if the cups are the same so that we can distinguish them. I asked for Earl Gray tea and vanilla tea in the afternoon. I thought I would get two cups of tea, but it turned out to be two cups. But overall it was very good, very good.

For example, there is no coffee machine in the room but a French press. But with this location and price, you can't ask for too much. The service at the front desk is very good, much better than the previous St. Regis Qingdao. The breakfast itself is quite satisfactory, and also has Tianjin characteristics, such as steamed buns and pancakes. It happened to be the Lantern Festival in a few days, and the waiter was delivering rice dumplings from table to table, which was very good.
The most central place is very close to Binjiang Road and the train station. Adults can walk there, but forget it if you bring the elderly.
The night view is beautiful at night. There is a happy hour, but it is relatively short, only until 8 o'clock. If someone invites you to dinner in the evening, you will not be able to use it.

The floor attendants are very serious about cleaning, proactively asking guests for their needs and responding to them. In terms of catering: I had the lunch buffet and breakfast the next day in the hotel’s western restaurant. Let’s talk about lunch first. The room booked by Ctrip includes a 50% discount on the lunch buffet, which is very good. The buffet lunch menu is very rich, including salmon, steak, grilled sausage, salad bar, various hot dishes, dessert table, drinks, freshly squeezed juices and fresh fruits, etc. are all very good. Especially the cold dishes part of the buffet is the biggest highlight of the entire buffet. First of all, the exquisite and fresh salads and various side dishes, then the fresh and shiny salmon, and the delicious natto bibimbap are all worthy of praise👍 🏻The hotel's breakfast buffet is rich in variety, and the egg rolls are pretty good. In addition, there are many local Tianjin snacks, such as pancakes and fruit, fried cakes, bran pancakes, tofu curd, etc. The catering service is also commendable, warm, proactive and professional.

In response to the demand for a good view, he arranged a room on a high floor with a good view for free. He also made the best arrangements for late check-out requests; he responded to every request! After check-in, we also arranged extra late-night snacks and attached a handwritten greeting card. It was very considerate and thoughtful!

She knew it was my friend’s birthday and made a birthday decoration. It was a very considerate arrangement. , the view is broad, thank you to the housekeeper Sophia for helping me during my stay. Everything else is very good. The only drawback is that we made a reservation for afternoon tea one day in advance, but we had to wait for a long time when we arrived, and the service attitude was not good. .

msg:Needless to say, the location is convenient. But in other aspects, it is far from the St. Regis standard. I am very disappointed. Marriott's is not even as good as Courtyard. A few points are as follows, I hope they can be better:
1. The guest room is old, the sofa leather is cracked and chipped, and the bedside tables are all worn out;
2. The shower room ditch is seriously stained;
3. Even if the air conditioner is turned on to the highest temperature, it is still relatively cold;
4. The hot water is not hot, it heats slowly, and even when the heat is adjusted to the highest level, there is only warm water;
5. The guest room corridor smells of pesticide;
6. There was nothing in the 200-yuan breakfast. It was all eaten an hour before the end of the meal. There was no replenishment. There was no variety. There was not a drop of milk and no one added it. The table was not cleared. The hygiene was not good enough;
7. The supplies in the room are not of high quality, let alone St. Regis standards. The drinking water is from Jingtian, and the toiletries are of no brand;
8. The ba*****t is old and the instructions are unclear;
9. If you book with Ctrip, you won’t be given points. It’s said to be a great discount and you won’t be given points;
10. The so-called butler service, there is no one to greet you when you enter the door, and there is no doorman to help pick up the boxes.

msg:This trip to Tianjin is a very special one for us. Because ￼We are unfortunate and lucky because we chose the right hotel with the best service, ST. Regis. On a cold afternoon on 26/12/2023, we left the ST. Regis￼ hotel where we just stayed in a happy mood when we went out for fun. Unfortunately my wife fell and was injured outside the door. Fortunately, we received careful arrangements from Miss Kong Yue, the lobby manager. She first arranged for their excellent hotel employee Adien to accompany us to Tianjin Hospital for trea**ent, and then also took care of a pair of children we left in the hotel. After we received trea**ent and returned to the hotel, she had already discussed with his supervisor the arrangements for our departure from the hotel the next day. In addition to arranging a special car, they also sent hotel staff to accompany us to Tianjin Station so that we could return to Beijing safely. Their arrangements are very user-friendly and they consider customers at all times. They are really excellent hotels and hotel employees. I would like to thank them again for their help. If I plan to travel again, I will give ST. Regis Hotel as the first hotel to stay in😊

msg:Choosing the St. Regis Haihe River View Room for New Year's Eve was a wise choice. I stayed on the 9th floor of the East Wing and had a good view. I could see the fireworks in both directions of Jiefang Bridge and Tianjin Eye🎆. There were New Year's Eve events at the bar in the evening. I had some wine, a light meal, and some bartending performances. The breakfast buffet was of good quality, but there wasn’t enough dining space. When I finished eating, there were a lot of people queuing up.

Facilities: The overall style is still very modern. It has been a little bit old since it was opened for a long time. For example, the bathroom floor is water stained, the TV cannot cast the screen, and the air conditioner is a bit loud.

The concierge took the initiative to take the luggage, even though we really had very little luggage. Overall, it is what St. Regis should be, and I was not disappointed. It’s the New Year, so you can actually prepare some small gifts for the children~
There are regular activities in the lobby. I caught up with the dough maker and made flowers for the children. The water in the swimming pool is a bit cold from 10 o'clock to 10 o'clock. The children's pool is small but very warm. There is a dry steam in the locker room and a large soaking pool.
The hotel room facilities are indeed outdated in some places. However, the entrance design has good privacy and the room size is okay.
The breakfast is okay, but the variety of cakes and breads is a bit lacking. The pancakes and fruits are not very interesting if they are not freshly made. If you go late, the long queue may not be a good experience.

msg:question:
1) The housekeeper didn’t deliver it to the room. Maybe he arrived too late that night? It’s understandable, since I didn’t bring any luggage, I didn’t have any requirements.
2) The manager of the afternoon tea lounge seemed to have a bad temper. He had a dark face throughout the whole process, and I even saw him scolding the waiter (she must be a new employee, but he was scolded for not doing a good job).
3) I arrived quite late on the first day, probably around 8pm, so it’s understandable that I didn’t turn down the bed. There should be something there the next day, but it didn’t happen either.
But it's not a big problem that there is no turndown service, I just think this service should be provided.
advantage:
1) However, the front desk is very good. The Ctrip order includes free afternoon tea. According to the rules, it can only be used on the day of check-in. However, I said that the order was just placed today, and they were very nice and transferred it to the afternoon of the next day.
2) When I took a shower during my stay, I found that the bottle of shower gel was empty. I called and it was delivered immediately. The response was very fast and efficient. Then I returned to the room the next day and found that Ms. Echo had specially given me a gift and called me to express my condolences. I would like to express my special thanks. Next time you use membership to book a room and receive a questionnaire, please praise it!

However, the overall advantages far outweigh these minor problems. Everything else is fine. The check-in experience was OK.

There are about ten colored pencils, picture books, and children's books specially prepared for children. The scenery outside the window is very good, and you can go far away. I saw the bridge where people were jumping off the water. It’s a pity that I don’t do it now, but there are sporadic people swimming. It’s very close to the Ancient Culture Street and the Italian Style Street. It’s just a few hundred meters away from the South Square of Tianjin Station.
The only drawback is that it is not convenient to see the night view. There is a big spotlight outside the window that shines into the room, which is very dazzling when looking outside.

msg:Not to mention the good points, it is the basic requirement for a hotel of this level. There are two things that affect the experience during this stay:
1. Queue for breakfast. This is the first time I encountered a hotel where I had to queue up for breakfast. We arrived at 9:30 and waited in line for about 20 minutes. Said it was because the room was fully occupied. But isn’t it basic for the hotel to plan the maximum capacity of the restaurant when it is full? Not to mention it's not peak season. The reception capacity needs to be strengthened urgently. At the same time, due to the large number of people, there were not enough tableware, and the temporary spoons were dirty... and other problems.
2. Not informed that happy hour is included when checking in. When checking in, I still heard someone telling the guests that they had a happy hour and could enjoy a light meal in the evening. After I got to the room and clicked on the order, I discovered that my package was actually included. I took the initiative to call and inquire before confirming it. If you didn't hear it, you missed it.

It seems to be a relatively old hotel, with complete facilities, the decoration style is not particularly fashionable, and the service staff's attitude is quite good! The housekeeping of the guest rooms is very smooth and quiet. A fruit platter was given in the evening.

There are many varieties of breakfast, and there are many Tianjin specialties that you can try. The braised noodles are delicious, but the crispy rice dishes are not used to it.

The only three disadvantages: 1. The bedside socket is far away from the bed, and the mobile phone cord is short, making it difficult to charge while lying on the bed. 2. The shower head in the shower room is a bit loose and might startle you if it falls suddenly. Moreover, the distance between the shower head and the shower switch is quite far and I am not used to it. 3. The check-in queue takes a long time.

msg:It was originally a blind booking, but the experience turned out to be surprisingly good. From the doorman to the restaurant waiters and the room staff, all the services were very good! ! Enthusiastic and professional, the hotel breakfast is also delicious. Behind the hotel is the Haihe River, where you can enjoy the beautiful scenery. Parking is also very convenient and check-in and check-out are quick.
Special thanks to the service staff on duty in the housekeeping depar**ent yesterday. My lover drank too much at the class reunion last night, so I asked the housekeeper if he could bring some honey. It was already past 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, and I knew that the restaurants were closed, so I didn't hold out much hope, but later After a while, it was delivered to me, I was very touched! Thanks!

msg:Very disappointed! ! Not recommended, feels bad.
Stayed at St. Regis during the Mid-Autumn Festival. This is my first time staying at St. Regis in Tianjin. It’s really hard to put into words.
Let’s talk about the good aspects first. The service is really good. I booked a superior king-bed room with river view. The person who checked in was very nice. He thought it was my first time to stay and upgraded me to a suite on the 12th floor. He also gave me a box of mooncakes. To be honest, it was a bit... Exceeded my expectations, very happy. But I really didn’t expect it! This famous St. Regis, the environment in the suite is really not good. First, dirty! There are a lot of manholes on the roof of a suite, five or six of them. The key is that they are very dirty, and they are all covered with black fingerprints. When you sit on the sofa or lie on the bed, you look up and see if they are blocked or not! Secondly, the facilities in the house are old and not well maintained. You can see that the bed headboard has been worn off and it is not repaired. This is Reggie
All in all, the price is very expensive, but it’s really not that good. I’m very disappointed! !

When booking other hotels online, Ctrip recommended it. After the child saw it, he changed his appoin**ent and went to the theme room. When he arrived at the hotel at almost 6 p.m., the room was not ready. After waiting for an hour, the child could not eat on time and became irritable. When I asked the reception how long it would take to check in, I actually replied: The guest room office has not been contacted. It was a ridiculous answer. However, I did not compromise this time and insisted on giving an exact answer or checking out. Seeing the tough attitude at this moment, the reception staff hid one after another. No one was waiting in the office. The manager on duty only came out after knocking on the office door. Is this Marriott? Or selling sheep's head as dog meat?
Let’s talk about quality! !
As a parent-child room, at least prepare pure cotton items. The themed covers must not be touched at all. This season, static electricity⚡️ is prickling.
health!
There is a large amount of dirt on the bathroom floor, all of which are the focus of traveling with children.
To sum up, the location is still okay. Adults can consider it, but be cautious when bringing children.

I came to Tianjin to watch Jay Chou's concert and decided to choose St. Regis. It is very convenient to Tianjin Station and the subway, so it is convenient to travel.
I was upgraded to a room with a view of the Haihe River. The butler Chloe's service was very considerate and she also gave me a welcome fruit meal voucher.
Breakfast variety is also very rich

msg:Watch Jay Chou's concert. Live at St. Regis. I feel very good. I always like to book St. Regis when I go out. I like the service and butler service very much. My housekeeper sister is really kind. I am a pregnant woman and she provides me with all kinds of conveniences. If I like sour food, she will immediately bring me more oranges. If the pillow is uncomfortable, she will immediately change it for me. She is really the best housekeeper girl I have ever met, Chioe. Even my mother said she is such a gentle girl.
The most annoying thing is happy hour. Because we were staying at the hotel, we were given free alcohol-free bar experience coupons, but the fact is that I am also a Marriott member. After taking a walk by the Haihe River in the evening, I felt hot and went to the bar on the first floor to have a drink and rest, then went back upstairs to rest.
As a result, with so many St. Regis across the country, we found something strange. The lady making drinks, instead of saying "You can go to the seat to order", after seeing the coupon, she ignored it at all, as if "You are here to Free coupons." She came over to me to look at the menu (we stood in front of the bar the whole time) and said, "Here are soft drinks." My husband took one look at it and said, how about a milkshake, for hot weather? She had gone to the side to make other drinks and overheard us saying "You can't order milkshakes". You're laughing so hard, what are you talking about? First of all, even if I am not a member, I can order drinks other than alcohol. Secondly, don’t you know what politeness is? Taking a hundred steps back, I am also a member myself.
I said: My butler said I can order it. She said: Who is your housekeeper? I am very impatient that Reggie still has such a service. I was also angry and said, "It's on the coupon, don't you see it for yourself?" What is your attitude? You can confirm with her. She glanced and said nothing. Did I say I could order? Have you confirmed it? She said: You look first. I said: I've finished reading it! She added: You can sit down and order. After we sat down, a young man came to take our order. The woman just rolled her eyes the whole time.
I went to the front desk to report this. The girl at the bar actually confused right and wrong, saying that she said no because I ordered a drink. How dare you say that? I am a pregnant woman with a bulging belly. What kind of wine should I order? Can you also find out who you are lying to? The other people around me all said, "How could a pregnant woman ask you to order a drink..."
Everything else about St. Regis is very good, and I also think Tianjin St. Regis is pretty good. The room facilities may be a little old, but the housekeeping service is as good as the rest of the country. But this girl in the bar on the first floor is really annoying. There are so many guests coming and going. Just because you are at St. Regis does not mean that you are the one who runs St. Regis. You can lie and look down on others at will? The most important thing in the service industry is nothing more than service and mutual respect.
This service is rated five points, full points for my housekeeper sister, and 0 points for the unpleasant experience...

       I suddenly wanted to go out for a walk, and booked train tickets and hotels with the Ctrip APP, which was very convenient.
       The check-in process was very fast. The hotel package I bought included a bottle of sparkling wine, a 200 yuan bar coupon, and welcome fruit.
       The room was booked as a panorama room, and the scenery is amazing.
       Miss Ava carefully chilled the wine in advance and delivered it to the bar at the appointed time.
       When reporting the room number for breakfast, the service staff can say my last name, which makes people feel very cordial. I like this restaurant the most, you can DIY your own sandwiches, the bread is soft, so delicious!
       There are outdoor seats in the bar. Sitting on the shore, you can watch the cruise ships going from south to north. The night view is beautiful, and there are singers singing.
        The location of the hotel is excellent, opposite to Hang Lung Plaza, backed by the Haihe River, very close to the train station and Italian Style Street.
        The hotel service is impeccable, and each post responds to any questions in a timely manner and is well-trained.

You can see a beautiful night view from the room. The service is very good. I booked a twin room with two babies and gave 4 breakfasts in total. The room is a bit old as a whole, but the grade and service are still online, especially the beautiful butler chole, the service is very considerate. The next step of the hotel is the Haihe River. I like to sit on the Haihe River at night and enjoy the breeze. I like breakfast very much. There are pancakes, Gaba dishes, and Tianjin specialties, and they taste very good. There are also eggs Benedict, and there are many types of small breads. Staying for two nights, I am always satisfied. If I go next time, I will definitely choose St. Regis.

It cannot be said to be delicious, but it is not too bad. The shortcomings are also obvious: 1. It is old and the room is obviously damaged. 2. The room service can't keep up. I asked for a bathrobe and it didn't arrive in two days. I'm very polite, okay, no problem. There is just no content. The overall temperature of the swimming pool should be higher, and the water will freeze to death. Not as warm as the locker room.

msg:Because of the good impression of Qingdao St. Regis, I still chose St. Regis when I was playing in Tianjin. How should I say it, I almost mean it~~

First of all, the location is very good, the city center, on the edge of the Haihe River, near Tianjin Station, and the Italian Style Street is within easy reach. It is also convenient to walk from the subway, 8-10 minutes. You can walk to Zhang Xueliang's former residence, Zhang Garden and other scenic spots. The Hang Lung is opposite, which is very convenient.

There is no major problem with the hardware, except that there is only one usb port in the guest room and it cannot be charged. o(╯□╰)o the phone cannot be connected, and it was repaired after reporting it on the first day.

The service is good and bad. On the good side, one is that the male receptionist at check-in was very good, and he checked in early and returned it to the top floor. The second is to meet people from the engineering depar**ent or the manager on duty on the guest room floor, and greet them politely.

The bug is that, first, there is no courtesy if you don’t check in on your birthday, and you don’t even ask. When I left the hotel that day, I asked if there was a birthday gift. The female front desk replied to the registered Marriott member Barabara, and Ctrip guests only had welcome fruit. With a question mark on his face, forget it. It’s the first time to celebrate a birthday in a hotel. It’s unbelievable that a five-star hotel doesn’t even have a small slice of cake. The second is to ask the front desk to borrow a charger. The young female front desk said no, and asked me to scan the code to borrow a power bank. Uh, do I need to ask you about the power bank, where is it not? In an instant, this is the next step! Power bank charging is different from charger charging. The former is for emergency use, while the latter is for practical use. And I stayed for three days, do I scan the power bank every day? This service, this consciousness, service is just one word. Shouldn't hotels try their best to meet the legitimate needs of their customers? Taking a step back, the hotel does not provide it. Can the waiter help you find a way to borrow one? For the next three days, I could only use my computer to charge my phone through the USB port, and I was also drunk...

It is recommended to strengthen the training of front desk staff! There are many five-star hotels. If you want to keep guests, the service is really better.

msg:Service: very poor, there is no concierge from the moment you enter the door, there are two computers when you check in, one of the front desk (female, fatter) is empty, and the other side is in line, and you don't take the initiative to check in, you ask yourself if you can do it. It's better not to send welcome fruit, it's all broken.
With children, the front desk asked to buy breakfast. I stayed at several Marriott hotels this year. This is the first one to ask children to buy breakfast. I saw in Ctrip reviews that they gave breakfast to adults, but asked children to buy breakfast. The pattern is small.
The location of the hotel is very good. The Haihe River is just outside the door. It is suitable for walking. Even in summer, it is cool. The afternoon tea provided is also very delicious. However, the service in the lounge is extremely poor, very slow, and the answers to questions are unprofessional.
Breakfast: There are many varieties, the taste is average, and the pancakes are okay.

From the moment of check-in, the front desk staff gave the impression that their professional ability is too poor, the check-in process is extremely slow, they are indifferent to the guests, and the guests' inquiries are basically not answered The answer is that the breakfast is flashy and there are many things to see, but there is basically nothing to eat. The service and attitude of the waiters in the restaurant are extremely poor. The tableware was not washed at all and brought to the table for us. When asked, she confidently said that the cleaning was over. Room 527 next door to us was still being renovated until late at night, and it was reported many times that no one was managing it. In addition, our room is two guest rooms converted from the original suite. There are two interconnected doors but the doors cannot be locked, which is not safe for both guests. The hotel explained that there is no problem if the guests do not open the door at the same time. We have encountered similar situations before. The door is locked by the hotel and guests cannot open it at will, but the St. Regis transfers the responsibility of the hotel to the guests. It is completely irresponsible for the safety of the guests staying in the hotel

It's just that the smell of the newly replaced soap is unacceptable, it's not a popular fragrance, and the bath products have also been replaced with recycled ones, not disposable ones. It is said that this is an environmental protection measure of the Marriott Group. I think bathing is very important, and some five-star hotels still retain disposable high-quality bath products. The overall feeling is that this hotel does not meet the five-star standard except for its good location.

After the butler Chloe patiently explained and communicated, I suggested that I experience the panoramic room with an invincible view. The butler also presented welcome fruit, which is very considerate in the hot summer. The hotel's breakfast is also very good, and the pancakes and fruits taste very authentic. The downside is that the hotel equipment is a bit old. It is recommended that the TV can be upgraded, but the underground garage is convenient for parking, the parking space is spacious, and the hotel has its own parking area.

This time there is also a free cruise ticket, which requires a fixed time and a pier. I communicated with the pier staff one hour earlier, and there were not many people. When I came out, I saw a lot of people queuing up for the next scheduled time. There are many kinds of breakfast, and there are also local special snacks in Tianjin. It is very convenient to eat in the hotel. The bread and cakes of Western food are especially delicious. The disadvantage is that the button of the light is not very clear. It takes a long time to study each time to turn on the light. The air conditioner is too loud, and the wifi is always intermittent. The facilities are probably a bit old and not very smart.

Because I was traveling with my mother, I paid more attention to the experience of my family. I called on the high-speed rail and told me. For some accommodation requests, the phone call was interrupted due to signal problems, and the hotel manager will reply to the call again in time to check the request, which is very responsible. 1. There were some small episodes after arriving at the store, which affected the accommodation experience at the moment. I will consider staying in other hotels. It may be because St. Regis has been in business for a long time, and the facilities have been changed or deleted. After communication, the manager is very Attention, Manager Leng Nan attaches great importance to customer feedback, notified the manager of the room depar**ent to cooperate with the adjus**ent and made timely rectification. It can be seen that the St. Regis brand carefully selects employees, and solves the problem in the shortest time and appeases the customer. I was dissatisfied, and found that when I continued to buy coffee to take away, I personally presented a takeaway cup of coffee to me in time. In fact, what I need for travel and play is a comfortable mood. I went back to the hotel with my mother that night, and everything was restored. The room is very comfortable, with fruit plate and other small gifts. Manager Leng Nan personally wrote an apology card and left a message. I am very grateful to Manager Leng Nan for his dedication to each guest and his sense of responsibility in solving problems. I will continue to choose to stay here in the future. 2. The scenery can only be said to be the top 1 hotel in Tianjin. Needless to say, the geographical advantage is that the hotel lobby is adjacent to the Haihe River. Whether in the room or in the lobby lounge, day or night, it is very chill to sit outside and have a drink. It is a comfortable place , the only choice to go to Tianjin. Ps: Manager Leng Nan is a very beautiful young lady~ Thank you for her.

The unique hollow cube design of the hotel ingeniously echoes the concept of "Jinmen" and has its own characteristics. It has become a pure and unique landscape in downtown Tianjin.

The biggest feature and advantage of the hotel is that it is adjacent to the picturesque Haihe River, especially the most beautiful scenery at night. The Tianjin Eye, the bridge across the river, and the colorful cruise ships have a panoramic view, which is so beautiful!

A 5-minute walk from the south gate of the hotel is a shopping mall, leisure and entertainment complex, and many time-honored restaurants, which are convenient for dining.

The room area is large, the hardware facilities are complete, and the heritage is full. The bed and pillows are very comfortable, and I am also impressed by the warm reception and thoughtful service of each employee.

There are many types of breakfast, and the ingredients are high-grade (freshly squeezed juice, various cheeses, smoked salmon, and various special Chinese breakfasts). The dining environment is good (you can sit outdoors and enjoy the sea and river view), which meets the standard that St. Regis should have, praise!

Finally, I would like to thank the center manager, Star Beauty, for providing thoughtful service and caring care for me and my family, and left a deep impression and good memory for the first trip with my parents!

This hotel is the best choice for business and parent-child travel in Tianjin, and it is also the best choice for watching the sea and river views! highly recommended!

The novice parents were afraid that they might not be able to handle it, so they had thick hair with their grandparents. The requirements for hotels with elderly children are particularly high. After doing a lot of homework, they finally chose I stayed at the St. Regis Tianjin, although I only stayed for two days and one night, but I left too many good memories💗
Hotel location: The hotel is built on the edge of the Haihe River. You can have a panoramic view of the Haihe River in the morning and evening without leaving your home. Of course, how can you not go out in such a beautiful place? Even if you bring a tow bottle, you are not afraid because the back door is along the coast of the Haihe River. Opposite the hotel is Hang Lung Plaza. Within ten minutes’ walk, you can reach the Porcelain House, Quanyechang, Zhang Zizhong’s Former Residence and other attractions. While the baby was sleeping, my baby’s father and I rode shared bicycles to Tianjin Eye🎡
Hotel environment: Before departure, considering that most of the time of this trip may be spent in the hotel, I chose the St. Regis Hotel with butler service. From the moment I entered the door, I felt the enthusiasm and warmth of every hotel employee, and all requests were met. Satisfied🈵️Although the baby is still young, I insisted on booking a children's themed room for him. Facts have proved that my choice was right, the baby forgot to sleep after playing so much💤
Hotel dining: I like to try the hotel's buffet breakfast, and St. Regis's did not disappoint me. The western restaurant on the first floor has a buffet in the morning, lunch and evening, and there is a side bar on the first floor. This is recommended by the head. Whether it is a sunny morning, a warm and lazy afternoon or a romantic evening, the side bar is definitely a holiday favorite. It is the best choice for people. If I have a chance, I will definitely sit by the Haihe River, eat a small barbecue and drink a little wine🍷 to enjoy a pleasant time.

The rating in my heart keeps rising. The hotel service is also good, I gave my daughter balloon butterfly wings, the child is so happy.

On the day I checked in, I asked if there were other protective measures, and the hotel got me the last bed circumference temporarily. Although there is only one side, it is OK to block the other side with a recliner. In addition, I feel that the hotel should have temporarily upgraded us to a suite. Below the large floor-to-ceiling windows is the very center of the Haihe River. You can see very beautiful cruise ships, Ferris wheel, and bungalows on the north bank of the river. The two children like it very much and often watch the scenery in front of the window.
The hotel's breakfast is very good, even a little treasure can easily feed it to its full; the swimming pool is very good and I took the children to play twice; the transportation is very convenient, and there are several modern shopping malls at the door: other services of the hotel are also very good, I Before departure on the same day, I asked the hotel if it could add a bed surround, and the hotel also won a side. This tour is satisfying!
ps: Although it is impossible for the hotel to upgrade the room type every time, this hotel is indeed worth the money, even more than the money

It is relatively close to the scenic spots, and you can walk there. If you take a taxi, it will be congested during holidays

The breakfast is average, the style is relatively simple, and the yogurt is not bad

There are many problems in the room. The reaction is very full when the temperature of the hot and cold water is adjusted, and there is a strong sense of delay and the experience will be hot and cold. The sink is too high and uncomfortable for European heights; the TV opposite the bathtub is broken and cannot be used; buckwheat The pillow is uncomfortable; there is no non-slip mat; there is no shoe towel... I heard that it is the cheapest St. Regis in the world😮😮😮

I gave a small gift after commenting 🎁 I hope it can be improved in the future to make customers feel that it is worth the money

Bo Ruiji has a history of more than 100 years. The brand is first-class and the environment is also first-class. The service is very average , I ordered a meal in the room and it was delivered covered with a plastic sheet, unlike the service of a star hotel, it feels like a roadside picnic to deliver meals to migrant workers

msg:The St. Regis Tianjin Financial Street Hotel is a very good five-star hotel with a good location and restaurants. I have stayed here before, but this time I found that the service at the front desk, which is the facade of the hotel, is very poor. They are blunt and indifferent to the guests, especially when When the guest said that he encountered difficulties and needed help, the waiter said he could do nothing. When the guest said he wanted to appeal to the relevant depar**ents of the hotel, the waiter simply said: "If you want to file a complaint, feel free...", because the waiter did not Wearing a sign, the guest asked his name, and the person simply gave the guest an English name. After the guest asked his colleagues, he found out that the waiter's last name was "*". Is this still the world-famous St. Regis Hotel owned by Marriott? ? Is this St. Regis standard service? ? Guests are deeply ashamed for St. Regis, and would rather not come to the St. Regis Hotel.
As a waiter in a high-end hotel, you must deeply understand that no matter how high-end the hotel you work in, it cannot withstand your willfulness and corruption. It is your personal business to give up on yourself. Don’t use the hotel as an endorsement, and don’t tarnish the noble reputation of the hotel.
Even so, I will continue to stay at the St. Regis next time, because the hotel is a good hotel but the people are not good enough. The hotel can be cleaned, and the people should be able to educate well.

I had no choice but to find Ctrip's customer service, and it was resolved quickly. I like it👍The location of the hotel is excellent. The commercial street is opposite the front door. It is very convenient for shopping and eating. It is just outside the back door. By the sea and the river, the scenery is pleasant and full of vacation feeling. It's just that the front desk was too slow to go through the formalities. It took about an hour for one family to go through the procedures. Later, the manager called twice to apologize and gave some compensation. Seeing the sincerity, I sincerely hope that there will be a change in the next check-in.

As a five-star hotel, the toilet and shower facilities have been running for a long time, and the toilet flushes can splash out. The cold and hot water in the shower room is very slow, and it took a long time to adjust.
The most unacceptable thing is that the heating cannot be adjusted by itself. It is kept at 25 degrees all night and cannot be turned off or adjusted. The explanation given is that the heating is controlled by the entire floor. If a guest complains that it is cold, the entire floor will be set. It's 25 degrees, it's really hot to death.
3. The toiletries do not meet the five-star standard. The feeling is very bad. The shampoo has a bad smell, it is not easy to use, and it does not foam. The texture of the bathrobe is not good. old
Generally speaking, the room fee is 1000, and the night view is 800. Oh, the glass of the night view is not clean
In the sky garden on the 18th floor, there are no fake flowers and the door does not open

After checking in, he took us into the room and told me that we could give the children a cup of hot milk and coffee. In the evening, Ela personally delivered milk and a rich fruit plate to us. I didn't expect such a pleasant surprise for a temporary stay for one night!

There are some stationery in the drawer on the desk: pencils, erasers, dovetail clips, paper clips, highlighters. There are also office supplies, such as: blank paper, envelopes, postcards, etc. 💮
As soon as I entered the hotel, I was shocked when I checked in. I was given a glass of champagne, which was just opened with a knife (the service is really good)

Hygiene: Very good, not as embarrassing as it is said on the Internet, great support. The black theme color is also very good, very elegant and temperamental!

Environment: The environment in the hotel is good. When I first entered, it didn't feel old at all, but it felt very new!
Not only the environment in the hotel is good, even the location of the hotel is very good, opposite to the pedestrian street. The scenery is good, it is really amazing to look out.
The steps in front of the hotel are very ingeniously designed, about one meter wide, whenever you see the white line, you have to go down the steps!

Service: This is a flaw. After spending so much money, the customers are ignored! But I can bear it!

What follows is some personal experience
The shower gel in the room is scrub, which is better than other hotels, and it is very beautiful when squeezed out! Moisturizer and other 🎛🕯🖼 are from France 🇫🇷, you can go and have a look. However, there is no anti-slip mat in the shower room, but the design is so good, I can't give a bad review. The bed is two meters long! Falling asleep 💤 very comfortable.

Awesome! Keep going! support 😁

The housekeeper, Cloie, is a very nice young man with youthful vigor and active service awareness. He also understands the city's situation and can respond to inquiries from guests very well. The boys at the front desk at the gym need more training or know what it is they love to do, and it's impossible to do well at a job they don't like. The higher the level of customers, the higher the level of the hotel. If the service awareness cannot keep up, the level of the hotel will be lowered, and the added value brought by high-quality business guests cannot be reflected in you.
The gym and swimming pool are underground, which is indeed a bug.

However, what I see and feel is just a relatively ordinary star-rated hotel, without any outstanding features. The lobby is small, the decoration is very general, and the types of breakfast are very limited, not as good as the previous four-star hotels.
Of course, it also has advantages: the location is good, the Haihe River is just outside the door, I think the night view will be more beautiful in summer, the service is very good, and the staff are of high quality.

msg:The location is very good, it is located by the Haihe River, in the city center, just stroll along the beautiful Haihe River from Tianjin Station. The prestigious St. Regis service is always online. Chloe at the front desk checked in for us. She was efficient and friendly, making people feel at home, and even arranged a high-floor room with a view of the Haihe River if the room availability allowed.
St. Regis Tianjin Financial Street brought me and my classmates a wonderful New Year's Eve experience! Next time you come to Tianjin, you must book St. Regis again! I wish the hotel a prosperous business and a wealth of wealth in the new year! grateful!

In the end, the check-out front desk was busy. The housekeeper, Leng Nan, helped to check out the room, and quickly helped with the deduction of the hotel's parking fee. He was very enthusiastic and efficient.

I always bring my baby here for afternoon tea. My little brother likes to run by the Haihe River~ I had my birthday in the riverside restaurant one year. After thinking about it, I really haven’t lived there~ So, I booked it for Halloween this year. Come and relax here.

From check-in to carrying the bag into the room, the housekeeper Chloe gave a detailed explanation all the way, introducing the room, the cartoon characters in the parent-child room, the water bar... I also prepared milk for the children at night, which is very caring ❤️

Due to the epidemic 🏊‍♀️The swimming pool is temporarily closed, which is a little regrettable. After the epidemic is over, I'm ready to go again with the kids~

First of all, when we arrived at the hotel by car, there was no welcome guide at the door, and the entrance to the ba*****t was very difficult to find. After driving around the hotel twice, we found the entrance to the underground garage by calling the front desk of the hotel. Secondly, when we checked in, When other employees were idle, the lobby manager was also there, and made me wait in line for more than 10 minutes; third, after checking into the room, I found that there was no refrigerator in the room. When I asked the lobby manager, he told My other room has a refrigerator, so you can change me to another room, so why did you give me a room without a refrigerator when I checked in? Yes, it was the lobby manager who "personally" checked me in; when I finally left the hotel to check out, I didn't take the initiative to ask me if I had a car and the license plate number, and I called the front desk to lift the lever to exit. In short, for a hotel with very, very, very poor service, don't hang the St. Regis brand. After all, St. Regis is known as a butler service.

When visiting relatives in Tianjin, I changed from Four Seasons to St. Regis. Four Seasons is a very bright and comfortable experience. St. Regis has a trendy smell when entering the door (this It is the most intolerable.) Others turn a blind eye. I put my facial cleanser on the shelf in the bathroom and I remember it clearly. When I passed by the bathroom, I found that a piece of clothing was not picked up smoothly. Secondly, after packing my luggage, I directly deposited it at the front desk without handling it. I picked up my luggage and flew back to Guangzhou at night. There is no need to post a long post here because of the four or five hundred dollars, but Regis said that he could not find it. I asked if the cleaning aunt took it or not accidentally thrown it away. Regis said that our colleagues would not do it. If something like this happened, I would help you to ask, and after a short inquiry, Reggie said that she could not find it. That's how Tianjin St. Regis handled it.

The bathroom area is very large, and the dry and wet are separated, but I don't know why the water speed can't keep up with the water output speed of the shower, and the shower room is not designed to be waterproof. .
The lunch buffet was at the riverside restaurant. I went early and there were not many people. Before me, there were two guests talking to the restaurant front desk clerk, and then the waiter took them into the restaurant and put me aside. During this period, no other staff was arranged to check the room number and arrange seats with me. It took me five minutes, but I had no choice but to go to the restaurant for dinner, which gave me a very unprofessional feeling.
Other aspects are not bad, the butler service is in place, the bar is next to the Haihe River, it is a good experience to drink some wine in the evening 👍

The facilities are extremely old:
1. The socket in the bathroom is broken, unable to dry hair
2. The TV cannot connect to the stereo
3. The TV in the bathroom is broken and cannot be displayed
4. When I first moved in, the ceiling wires made a loud noise under the blowing of the air conditioner. The maintenance master slapped the ceiling hard and repaired it.

The service is also very confusing. Those who don't know think I live in an express hotel:
1. The check-in queue time is more than 10 minutes, and the check-out time is more than 10 minutes
2. When parking at the hotel, you must report every time you go out, otherwise you will not be able to park for free
3. After breakfast, tell us that there are no seats in the restaurant, let us sit at the bar outside

It may be the worst St. Regis experience in China. There are too many better choices in Tianjin at this price

First of all, I didn't expect that the mineral water is pure water music (I didn't say that pure water music is not good), and secondly, the toiletries are not as branded as other St. Regis, and the toothbrush is not in the bathroom, but hidden in the secret compar**ent of the door.
Secondly, the bedding was really not very clean, and my friend slept all night and found that there were small red rashes on the back.
I have always liked the St. Regis decor, but this St. Regis is very poor, with old furniture and not very clean carpets. The bathroom is big, but the bathtub is still stained.
The only thing that deserves praise is that the reception at the front desk is better, but the housekeeper hung up the phone before he finished talking on the phone. Although he knew it was not intentional, it was really not right.
Overall, this price point to choose other hotels may be better.

msg:Celebrating the 5th wedding anniversary with my wife, I chose to spend it at the St. Regis Hotel due to the epidemic. The surrounding environment of the hotel is good. The hotel has specially upgraded the room and can see the panoramic view of the Haihe River. The scenery is very good. The room was also arranged for us, which was very considerate. Finally, I would like to thank the hotel steward Zora for the blessing card and the small gift. We like it very much. Kudos to the hotel staff 👍. Very good hotel stay experience. Recommended to stay.

msg:The overall is still passable, the night shift front desk is unprofessional and made an oolong, because it is necessary to work at night, I specifically called in advance to ask the gym time. It is 24 hours to ask again after checking in at night. After going downstairs at the back, the sign was unclear, which led to the failure to exercise. I asked the front desk but took the pool schedule and was told that the room is not open 24 hours and there is no apology. Originally booked 2 nights, checked out early and changed to Westin. Ps: The leather furniture in the room is obviously aging, which is not in line with the positioning of St. Regis. Day service is very good.

msg:The first time I stayed at St. Regis, I found that it really gave me a very different feeling. It is very magnificent. If you anthropomorphize Regis, it will feel like a member of the royal family, solemn and elegant. Moreover, the location is very good, it has the characteristics of Tianjin, and the scenery is very good. It is highly recommended that you live in a river view room, you can see both the city view and the river view, especially at night, the scenery is beautiful. The service is very attentive. As soon as you enter the door, you can feel that you are valued. From entering the door, the concierge helps to pull the luggage, to the front desk to check in, and then to the butler to take the elevator personally, which makes me feel warm. Thank you very much for Tina's enthusiastic service at the front desk and the small gift from the manager of the butler service center, star, which makes the stay feel like home and gives us a sense of intimacy. Moreover, it is different from the front desk service of other hotels. It is very patient and very patient. Gentle and professional. The layout of the room is also very nice. The overall feeling is that I really want to enter a small palace of my own, which is comfortable and a**ospheric. There are also many types of breakfast. Although due to the epidemic, you can still feel that the service staff are trying their best to let the guests eat more delicious breakfast. Although it is the first time to stay at St. Regis, many people around me have already stayed there. They feel that St. Regis is a hotel with classic features, especially with housekeeping features that no other hotel has ever seen. It is worth a try. What is called "the gentleman in the hotel", I think it is probably St. Regis.

msg:Let me share with you a little story about staying at Tianjin St Regis Financial Street Hotel from October 22-25 this year. Let me tell you first, I booked a room on Ctrip, and a superior city-view double room (the room may not be well located) Well, Haihe only saw a corner 🦶) On the day of check-in, everything was normal, check-in at the front desk, cash deposit of one thousand, after everything is done, I went to see my girlfriend. In the next two days, I renewed the lease for another day. When I went to the front desk to go through the procedures the next day, the front desk guy asked me for a 1k deposit again. Why is this? (I told him that I had renewed my subscription on Ctrip, and the fee was paid, and then he told me that there is no way to confirm my payment??? Need to wait for confirmation??? Then I have to pay the deposit again, I just watch this Brother talked nonsense to me, I won’t expose it, I told him, you will confirm it for me now, and then tell me the finances go to work at 9:30, and I can’t confirm it now) I’m very speechless, I paid an extra 1k deposit, and wait for me After checking out on the 25th, the deposit should be refunded 2k and returned to me 1162.81💰, why, I obviously paid on Ctrip, and the invoice can be printed out! I called the hotel front desk the same day to confirm and told me to refund me within three to five working days. After about a week, I found that the refund was still not received. I called the hotel front desk again to ask about the situation. The same result, tell me that I need to wait, the refund is going through the process, it will take a few working days, a dignified five-star hotel, is it so difficult to refund 800 yuan? ! [黑 sweet potato question mark R][黑 sweet potato question mark R][黑… Okay okay, I directly called 12315 to file a complaint, and I received a refund in the evening 🌆 the following day. I really don’t understand, a five-star hotel, it’s really good to slap your face in such a thing!

This Tianjin St. Regis Financial Street Hotel is disgusting to me. I will never stay in such a disgusting hotel again in my life. Disappointed R])

msg:Take the children to Tianjin to play. The children did not want to go, so they booked two rooms temporarily that night. The hotel service is still very nice, that is, the hotel design is divided into two wings, and there is no intercommunication between them. If you don’t live with friends, it’s not convenient to go up and down. (Because of the eleventh holiday we were divided into the east and west wings)
Hejing is good at night, but it would be perfect if the weather is good. The breakfast of the hotel was 198 people. The Tianjin pancake that I was looking forward to was actually put in fermented bean curd sauce, and almost died. Suggest improvements. It is specially bar drinking, and the waiter Amway Amway St. Regis's photos bloody romantic. The color is good, but if you don't like tomato juice, don't try it. The cocktail bartenders are average, after all, the price of 120 cups is still a bit disappointing. Nice room, average catering, not big gym

The minibar in the room is charged. There are two bottles of coke and juice. But for more than 900 rooms, Even a few bottles of water are charged one by one. This is very bad for the guests. In addition, I believe that the guests staying in this hotel are looking at the night view of the Haihe River, but this time the check-in point is particularly disappointing. There are spotlights outside to hit the building, and you can’t see anything at night. You can look at the picture below. In addition, it’s awkward during the stay. The bathroom windows are floor-to-ceiling. It should be emphasized that we will stay at night because it is dark outside. , I didn’t pay attention at all without hanging the curtains, but the lights were on in the bathroom. Everyone can imagine this privacy. . . I think the hotel needs to at least close the curtains before moving in, or give a reminder, who would have thought that the bathroom wall is made of glass, and it is only the next day to see the glass, so I feel very bad about it, everyone Pay attention when staying in the next time, the overall experience of staying in general, low cost

I specifically told the staff to ask for a room with a high floor view. After going up, the window directly faces a building, speechless, change The room continued for more than 30 minutes.
Hotel customer service: answer the phone promptly, the service attitude is super good, the voice is sweet, and the absolute brand service.
Room service: The elder sister of the room attendant is sincere and will apologize if the items are delivered late. If you see the guests in the public area, they will greet you with full marks.
Hotel guest rooms: The indoor space is reasonable, the TV signal is too bad, the TV is SONY, the DND system and the sound system are big names, but they can't be used, the furnishings!
Hotel bathroom: The design of the countertop is unreasonable, it is too high, and the width prevents the guests from using the basin normally, unless they are foreigners, the people are too big! The hot water in the shower room is slow and needs to be adjusted.
Comprehensive evaluation: Five-star buildings, branded hardware equipment, and room facilities and equipment management should be strengthened. Customer service staff and room attendants like it, which adds a lot of points to the hotel. Hotel service staff is not easy to work, 5 points praise encouragement!

msg:春節帶着母親和娃出行，定了兩間，酒店的位置非常好，過馬路就是天津金街，臨着海河岸，晚上步行海河岸邊到意大利風情區，景色還是不錯滴，白天步行到瓷房子、張學良故居等位置都很近不需開車省了找車位的麻煩，還可以逛逛恆隆廣場等偶遇新年舞獅，很開心
房間：面積夠大，設施不錯
餐食：因為打算品嚐天津早餐，所以沒有預訂餐飲，但是還是後悔了，因為天津好的早餐根本吃不上，還不抵在酒店吃了
床品：四個枕頭一邊高，跟酒店要了蕎麥皮枕
服務：送了果盤還有點心盤，孩子很喜歡
不足：房間温度太高，關了空調也很熱，而且抽紙太少，房間內沒有很不方便

msg:第一次選擇瑞吉酒店，沒想到如此失望。
1.訂了兩間河景房，正常下午三點可辦理入住。但我們下午三點衹能入住一個房間。另一房間什麼時間可以入住不詳。反覆催促三次後，終於在下午五點十分左右送來了另一個房間的門卡。問值班經理，告知過年上班人少，每天都會出現這樣的情況。
2.一個房間浴室噴頭嚴重老化，不能固定，家人洗澡噴頭自行脱落砸了頭，還好沒有什麼嚴重後果。自己想辦法固定才勉強湊合著洗了澡。浴室上方老化嚴重，隨時可以掉落東西。
3.值班經理態度都很好。但是管理成這樣的五星級酒店，也是第一次遇到。
以後再也不會選擇瑞吉酒店。

衞生：衞生情況還不錯吧，算是中規中矩了
環境：還可以
服務：不錯，孩子的勺子不小心遺留在餐廳了，餐廳幫忙找了一天！
到了第一天的晚餐選了自助，但是作為五星級酒店菜品不理想，種類少就算了，味道很一般，對不起小300的價格，感覺有點坑。早餐還可以吧，中規中矩，沒有特點。酒店由於是高層不能開窗也就沒有窗户特別悶，換氣有待改善！唯一讓我很不滿意的就是高級河景房居然是半河半城景，那應該直接寫明的，有點被騙的感覺。這個價格其實我們可以有其他選擇。而且居然衹能延半小時退房，帶着孩子出門選擇好酒店就是花大價錢住的舒服從容，結果12點半把電視直接給我們停了，也是第一次見！

msg:天津的瑞吉酒店，居住品質有點兒一般。這次預訂的是埃及萌神主題親子房，和大英博物館聯名的主題，有一些玩偶和繪本，可惜都不能帶走，大堂的環境和服務人員還是很好的，但是酒店裡的設施比較尷尬，衹有一個主游泳池，沒有小童池和按摩池，想做個SPA，被告知沒有水療中心，房間裏的馬桶圈有磨損，看起來很舊，馬桶一直在漏水，雖然不影響休息，但是想着這麼多水被白白浪費了就很鬧心，報修了以後衹好了一個上午，下午又開始漏水，看着大堂裏天津市政府給頒的節水單位牌子心裏衹歎氣，小童活動就在大堂過道里，一張桌子兩張椅子，但凡多點兒孩子都坐不下，聊勝於無吧。早餐更是一般，想喝個熱牛奶，牛奶桶堵了，本來就不大的區域，菜品能重複兩次以上，轉了一圈沒啥可吃的。晚上餓了，想點個客房送餐，還得打電話送餐單過來，等了40分鐘，送來個油膩膩的菜單，一股葱油味兒，瞬間不想吃了。總之，這個酒店地理位置還不錯，挨着海河，步行可到意大利風情街，海河夜景也可以，但是要想着泡酒店旅遊就算了，總體不推薦。

而且 我説因為孩子要睡覺 能不能提前一點收拾出來 我們十二點左右到了 就已經都可以入住了！實名錶揚瑞吉。

環境：地理位置簡直無敵！酒店就走海河邊 大堂穿過去就是了。地理位置超級好啊 步行五分鐘到恆隆廣場  離天河城也不算遠。十五分鐘到意大利風情街。


設施：對於老酒店來説 已經不錯了
衞生：真的誇一下衞生 主題房的抱枕都是乾乾淨淨的。很舒服的感覺

msg:好的地方：地理位置很好，出門就是海河邊。服務效率比較高，基本符合瑞吉服務標準。酒店建築設計也很有特點。
差的地方：設施太差了。老酒店重在維護，衹要維護得好，舊一點沒關係，甚至還更顯底藴，比如北京和成都的瑞吉都不新了，但維護都很好。但是天津這家瑞吉絕對不是舊的問題，而是破，已經破到影響基本居住體驗了。舉幾個例子：1. 坐便水箱和花灑均是漏水了。2. 房間玻璃很臟，甚至影響視線。3. 房屋裡空氣不清新。4.浴袍磨損嚴重。
更不可思議的是早餐…………排隊很久，門口服務員説今天客人真多。客人多不是藉口，多少算多？如果客人多也要抱怨，那就請量化多的標準並在客人辦理入住的時候告知客人第二天達到了人多的標準，會排很長的隊並詢問客人是否可以取消早餐並補償或者打折或者送早餐到房間，不能把責任推給客人多。收錢的時候為什麼不嫌人多？進入早餐廳後，被領位帶到的位置沒有收拾，領位讓我們站在那裡等，先不要去取餐。這種餐廳管理還是第一次遇到，太沒秩序了，這才是造成等位的根本原因，管理不善。早餐也非常難吃，選擇少並且難吃，連卡布奇諾都做不了，衹能提供沒事，水果不去皮……

正門可以直接過馬路去對面去恆隆，吃飯買東西都方便。恆隆旁邊是步行街，多走幾步就是天河城，那一片都是商場。
房間裝修稍微有點暗沉，就是以前主流風格。暖氣很足甚至感覺熱，冬天去需要備一套薄睡衣甚至可以短袖短褲。沒有帶也可以問客房服務要個風扇。比其他酒店要做得好的是瓶裝水備得很足。
早餐偏西式，很驚喜有貝果（雖然因為天氣原因貝果吃着有點硬），有鮮榨果汁。但是總體來講品類不算非常豐富。
個人覺得餐廳“正在用餐”的牌子太小了，如果人多需要安排在大堂酒吧用餐的話，已被安排的桌子很容易被忽略被佔座。

msg:硬件：房間設施確實相對老舊，比如沒有自動馬桶蓋，冬天坐上去還挺冷的；房間的沙發掉皮了；空調有聲音；浴室的水需要放放一會兒才能出熱水，冷熱水控制不敏感；房間隔音效果不太好。

軟件：服務態度很好。服務員都很有禮貌，也都是笑臉相迎。但是服務水準真跟不上。比如第一天入住給客房服務打電話，因為房間有小朋友，需要多加一雙拖鞋、牙刷和浴巾，結果打了兩次電話，我們出去轉了一圈吃了晚飯回來了，還沒送到…再比如，早上用餐，遇到節假日其實酒店應該都有預案的，尤其新年這種客人多的情況，況且這家酒店開了這麼多年了。早餐區座位不夠在咖啡吧隔了一塊區域出來，這也能理解。但是服務員基本都是打亂仗的感覺，桌子沒有及時收拾、餐區和接待區溝通有點gap，把我帶到這個區域沒有座位了又帶到另一個很遠的地方，最後還是我自己看到空座位要求坐過去…

總之，拋開硬件不説，軟件方面還是不少可以提升的空間。距離以管家式服務著稱的瑞吉酒店標準還是很有差距的。

1.最為天津市區的五星級酒店，服務是沒得説，但是也不比其他五星級要好，比較中規中矩
2. 設備比較差，首先，停車場在地下三層，沒有充電樁，很不方便，如果充電，需要去地下一層，地下一層不歸酒店管，酒店説可以負責停車費，但是流程很複雜，需求先從地下三層出車庫 再進地下一層，否則可能停車費不能負責
3.這個五星級酒店的衞生紙很差，感覺和快捷酒店一個檔次 和其他五星級差距太大，比如和麗思卡爾頓，或者凱悦相比，都差太遠了
4.早餐看似很多，其實沒什麼特色，也很中規中矩
所以這個五星級感覺確實很一般，很大優勢就是地理位置好，在市中心

msg:優點且唯一的優點是地理位置好，晚上去看海河夜景很方便，至意式風情區也步行可到。
硬件極差，淋浴間地磚至少有兩塊嚴重鬆動，大花灑與手持花灑之間切換也壞，衹能用手持花灑。
服務幾乎沒有，傳説中的管家衹存在於一張墊水果盤的明信片上，如果不是因為房間太悶，我拿出來扇扇風還發現不了。
重點説一下前台，辦理入住的這位女士極不專業，不介紹早餐不介紹歡樂時光，倒是不耽誤和旁邊另一位員工當著客人的麪説小話。為了節省第二天的退房時間，特地關照把發票提前開好，還強調了名字不要開錯，然而第二天退房的時候，才發現根本沒開，一堆人在那兒折騰，最後跟我説要不你重新排隊吧，這裏要感謝一位戴眼鏡的先生，感覺衹有他一個人能夠先幫客人解決問題。

高級河景房面積不算小，窗邊有貴妃榻，非常適合躺着欣賞海河的夜景。
強烈推薦一樓的蔚藍海餐廳，五星級酒店裡難得有西餐做得如此出色的餐廳，服務員態度也特別好，真的非常非常滿意。
從酒店一樓酒吧可以直接到海河邊，晚上坐在那裡就很閑適。酒店大堂有專門放外賣的架子，想喝點什麼吃點什麼都可以叫外賣，方便的時候下樓取就行，很適合懶得專程為了某個吃的特地跑一趟的人。

太**了，明明説房間不能換，我既然提前付了8和9的房間不讓換到其他日期，我9日來為啥不讓住，説客房不乾淨，賣給別人了……  8日的客房不經我允許就賣給其他人嘛

msg:我給差評。下面是理由。一，圖片是兩個床中間的桌子，破皮了，很舊。而我是花了每晚1123元的價格。二，入住時我告訴前台，我睡覺淺，需要一個離電梯遠的房間。結果房間就在一出電梯的位置，我不得不找前台經理換。三，酒店房間雖然有窗，但是都不能打開，即不能換外面空氣，衹能靠空調。我是三月十日入住，但是天津最高氣温是26度，房間裏面很悶，打開空調後衹有制熱一個選擇，空調打開後室温越來越高，而酒店客服告訴我他們目前還是供暖期，不能製冷，衹能換氣。讓我打開房門旁邊有個通到走廊的小洞來降温。晚上在室温25度的情況下，蓋着酒店的羽絨被，我一晚上沒怎麼睡，一直在出汗。綜上原因，差評。

msg:來之前選了好久決定住這裏，因為帶着寶寶出來玩，就想着住個環境好點的酒店，但是這次的體驗不是特別好，幾個槽點寫下來幫助其他朋友避坑
首先説房間內的minibar是收費的！我以為這個價位這個檔次的酒店都會有首次免費，但這裏不是，我們後來把飲料都帶走了，退房的時候也沒有服務員提醒我們，等到晚上六點多酒店給我打電話説minibar消費了160塊（一瓶礦泉水，兩瓶果汁，兩聽可樂），要從按金里扣，結果就衹退了我剩餘的按金，我問他房間為什麼沒有價目表，讓我以為是免費的，他説電視裏有他們付費項目的廣告，那裡麪 寫了價格…這解釋就還挺無語的
第二點，在房間裏打客房服務要被子和嬰兒床，打三次兩次都沒人接，而且客房服務速度非常慢，讓我差點以為他們給忘記了
第三點，床邊插座沒有usb插口，充電的話需要帶一個轉換接頭，
第四點，床墊非常軟，如果兩個人睡在一張床上，一個人翻身另外一個人能明顯感覺晃動，睡覺輕的可能會被吵醒
第五點，馬桶圈一定要輕拿輕放，如果中途鬆手，馬桶圈放下的時候聲音非常大，第一次上廁所沒經驗把自己嚇一跳，而且不是智能馬桶
印象比較深的就這幾點吧，酒店位置沒得説還是非常好的

酒店的位置真是超級方便，出門對面就是恆隆廣場~往衚衕裏走走還有看着不錯的餐廳~後面就是海河，夜景超級美~就算不座遊船就沿着海河邊上溜達感覺都很舒服~
相對來説酒店設施還是差了些，沒有智能馬桶。

Chloe給孩子提供了小童牙刷，小朋友太喜歡了，早晨居然自己起來刷牙，要求用小姐姐送的牙刷。
瑞吉的風景絕佳，位置也好。咖啡廳出去就是海河，早晨出去遛遛心曠神怡。
離大商場一條馬路之隔，過去吃喝玩樂應有盡有。
總之體驗感很好，下次來天津還住這裏。

瑞吉主打butler式服務，但在這家店除了值班經理讓我看到了服務，其他真的都沒有。建議員工看看你們的員工手冊，到底你們的企業文化是什麼，你們的優勢是什麼。

但是酒店設施太老了，電視屏幕都是雪花，我們定的兩個房間，一個提供了酒店logo的紙袋子和洗衣袋，一個沒有，説明打掃衞生的阿姨也丟三落四。前台辦入住時，有一個房間在本應入住的15:00沒有打掃出來，我們衹能所有人先擠在一個房間裏，然後冒着大雨去外面吃飯溜達，7點多回酒店才拿到房卡。酒店在15:00不能讓我們按時入住的情況下，既沒人提出換房型（哪怕加點錢）先入住的方案，也沒有前台人員給我們打電話及時通知房間已收拾好可以入住，更沒人為酒店的違約行為主動提出任何補償，衹説第二天可以讓我晚退房，但是我第二天有其他的旅行安排，這個方案有什麼意義？從頭到尾一點都看不出來為客人所想的態度，實在不配瑞吉的品牌。最後我們向酒店投訴，值班經理態度蠻好，出面還算妥善地解決了這個問題，但本次經歷實在是令人失望。

對早餐的服務和食材感到失望，種類較之香格里拉，holiday inn甚至相比起來都十分有限，食材也不是很新鮮，特別是甜點和麪包，感覺像批發來的，麪條並不是現點現煮，而是煮出來好幾碗放那裡，試問後來拿的客人口感能好嗎？也就是煎餅和炸糕差強人意，早餐質量應該好好改善了

五一期間酒店還設計了親子活動,小盆友製作風箏,畫草帽等；
來的第一晚被邀請參加香檳開瓶儀式;入住儀式滿滿；
大堂的香草茶很棒,其實就是南非國寶線葉金雀花,沒有咖啡因,住店客人不論是長者還是小朋友都可以喝,給酒店點贊,茶品精選的很到位；
早餐味道不錯,還有實在餐位,妥妥的sunshineBrunch,早餐還設計了地道的天津味道,煎餅果子,嘎巴菜,炸糕,老豆腐腦,天津包子,牛肉餅等等。

其次管家服務形同虛設，根本不作為，酒店點餐圖與實物也不相符。
服務人員倒是符合普通五星的標準。
總之，十分不建議入住天津瑞吉。

首先是裝修，真的真的有種二十年前ktv的感覺，關鍵一進樓道就有股怪味，當時有點懷疑這是一個假瑞吉。
再説服務，要啥沒啥，要個蕎麥枕—沒有。加床被子—沒有。以至於一家三口用一床大被子，一晚上都不敢翻身，一翻身就沒有被子蓋了，第二天妥妥的落枕了！
早餐非常普通不説，人多沒秩序（第二天入住的酒店人也多，但是管理真的很貼心）。最奇葩的是離店24小時後又收到電話説得補交孩子早餐費，服務員掛錯帳單了，要不就得服務員自己買單，我也是無語了。讓服務員買單我內心當然過意不去了，妥妥的把錢轉過去了！
總而言之，家庭出行真心不建議選天津瑞吉，給愉快的天津之行大打折扣！人多真的不是藉口，好在後麪的酒店彌補了這次不快！

msg:如果這是個比快捷酒店還低的那種開在醫院啊，學校啊周邊的小旅店，我估計我能給三星一般不過不失，但是你是瑞吉啊，我住過五星酒店不計其數，也難免有不盡如人意的，但我不會去點評，畢竟經營不易，但這家店不僅對不起萬豪的招牌，更黑五星酒店丟臉，首先，沒有門僮衹有穿着軍大衣的保安，晚上到酒店11點了，説停車場關閉，問停那，告訴説不怕貼條可以停街邊，你酒店硬件設施有問題，你們應該是想辦法解決，而不是將問題推出去，這種門僮估計停車場大爺都比他客氣吧。再説入住，先不説快慢，先來後到順序有嗎，辦入住時一個住店客人下來説電話打不通衹好下來，然後辦入住的去接待他，這説前台人員服務人手不夠。進入房間非常大的味道，要了空氣清新機，在轟隆聲中一晚上也沒把味道排完，然後房間洗漱用品，快捷酒店都不如的那種散裝洗髮液，一股刺鼻的化學品味道，本來要入睡，感覺有人在説話，然後隔壁開始此起彼伏的叫聲，原來我的房間和隔壁房間不是一堵牆，而是一道門，這要有隔音那就見鬼了，就在12月24日我住的長沙瑞吉，真的是雲泥之分，即使那種快捷酒店也比這裏好上千倍，能夠把所有環節都做到極差的酒店，這個是唯一得一家，我仔細回憶了我還覺得不好的酒店，竟然沒有，哎，我本來不想給分的，但是最低衹能給一分，哎，這一分就算是這酒店安全可能還可以，畢竟全身而退吧
