The next day, we had something to do and needed to cancel one night. After communication, the hotel refunded us, which was very humane and gave us breakfast. It can be said that it was a home-like service!
The hotel is located in the city center, but it is quiet in the bustling city. It is the best choice for visiting Shantou. The hardware may be a little older than the new hotel, but good service is the core of the hotel and the essence of long-term operation! If I come again next time, I will still choose this 100% satisfactory hotel.

Compared with the hotels I have stayed in before, it is the top in terms of environment, hygiene, and service attitude. I am also from Chaoshan, so I feel very friendly. This is also my first time to experience a parent-child theme room. My baby is very happy. The toys and facilities are very new. The immersive experience of the submarine team is full marks💯!! The hotel's caring butler service, prepared sugar water and olives to welcome us on the first day of check-in. Some of us were scalded, and the butler immediately arranged for scald ointment for us. Every takeaway was delivered to us by a robot, and small gifts were also given to the children. We checked out on the last day and helped us dry our clothes for free. Your needs can basically be met. Who would not love such hotel services? ? I will only stay at Sheraton when I go back to my mother's house next time❤️❤️

The front desk helped us upgrade to a sea view room. The room was large and clean, and the surrounding area was not too noisy. The cleaning lady leaves a disposable bathtub bag every day, which is super considerate, so the children can happily take a bath before going to bed.
After delivering the takeout to the takeout counter, call the front desk and the little robot will help deliver it.
It is very convenient to walk 200 meters to Vientiane City and Suning Plaza. I had gastroenteritis on the last night, so I asked the staff to pick up medicine at three or four o'clock in the night. Thank you for your hard work~ Knowing that I had been vomiting all night, the hotel also sent millet porridge, extended the check-out time, and helped prepare bread when I left. and drinking water, thank you very much ~

msg:Very satisfied with my stay at the Sheraton Hotel as always. The hotel front desk service was very enthusiastic and upgraded the room type for us. ZOE especially enthusiastically introduced the situation and asked about our needs. He also proactively provided us with tourist maps of Shantou Old Town and introduction to local snacks. He would take the initiative to say hello every time we met in the lobby. , asked if I need help, thank you very much ZOE. The room is very clean and hygienic, the bedding and towels are very comfortable, and the facilities are easy to use, especially the shower, which is very useful and has hot water. It is very comfortable to take a hot bath after a long trip. The hotel is not far from the old city. I took a taxi to visit Xidi Park, the small park old town and the food street, and tasted local snacks. It was a good accommodation experience.

Although the beautiful girl who helped renew the room is unknown, her service attitude is also great! The service of the handsome guy in the lobby bar is also great.

There are also heart-warming red dates and white fungus soup and small cakes in the room, which are also equipped with matches for heating. When I first booked the hotel, I considered whether the hotel would be old due to its age. However, when I arrived, I realized that I was completely over-concerned. The lobby is well maintained, gorgeous, clean, without pungent perfume smell, and has the standard of an old five-star hotel lobby.
The location is very good, very close to Vientiane City. I walked there as soon as I arrived in the evening. Great breakfast.
Drink coupons for the lobby bar at 23° North Latitude: not bad, only available in special summer season

msg:The hotel is located in a prime location and is very lively. It is within walking distance to Longyan South Road Food Street. The lobby has the splendid style of an international brand hotel chain. It is very festive during the Chinese New Year. There is a free drink bar in the lobby, and the rooms also have free drinks on the first day of stay. Desserts and Kung Fu tea are particularly delicious. The room is very big, so there is a lot of walking for the big ones😝. The sanitary area is also very large and overall comfortable. The disadvantage is that the water from the faucet falls straight into the downpipe and the sound is very loud. The elevator is a bit slow and the waiting time is long. The guy who served the room was probably new and didn't respond very quickly. When I came in advance, I told him that there were three people staying. However, the next day, there were only utensils for two people. There were mosquitoes in the room. I tried to insert liquid mosquito coils, but found that there were some. The socket is not that easy to plug into. Overall, I am satisfied and comfortable.

msg:1. The room smells musty and sour, and it irritates the nose. After moving two air purifiers, they are still broken. The air quality is 159 red line. The bedding is covered with a layer of dust. The return of the south wind accounts for a small part of the reason, but it is not the main reason. It is also a problem that can be solved after human intervention.

2. After coordinating to change the room, from a double to a large double, the smell is a little better, not irritating, but still there. The air purifier is still broken and noisy.

3. After changing the room, I found hair and black spots on the bedding, pillows and bed before going to bed. Because it was around 2 o'clock in the morning, I didn't change the room and slept with a bath towel.

4. There was a negotiation to check out later, and the hotel agreed, but we still checked out at noon in the morning. The hotel also kept apologizing. I hope it can be To solve the problem, not to give a bad review, but the public relations ability is poor, and the proposed solution makes people feel uncomfortable. It is not the attitude that an old brand should have when encountering problems. First of all, we don’t want anything, we just want you to make a good rectification and live up to your reputation. You keep chasing us to solve our problems, which takes up time and emotions. We clearly stated that there is no need to solve it, just make a good rectification. There is no way to solve it. This night has passed, but the hotel has been calling and hopes not to give a bad review. I heard the solution twice, and both gave a little discount. I was really ridiculous by this solution. I didn’t feel the sincerity and attitude of solving the problem, and I didn’t say how to rectify it in the future. This is not the management and public relations ability that an old brand, one of the top hotels in Shantou, should have.

I will not stay again. I hope that Sheraton Shantou Hotel can take this problem seriously and make adjus**ents to provide high-quality services and experience to customers staying there, and don’t destroy its reputation.

msg:During the New Year family trip, we came to Shantou for the second time. Choose Sheraton. Since I carefully selected from various platforms before traveling, I spent a lot of time comparing them. In the end, no hotel was satisfactory. So I stayed at the Sheraton with "anxiety." This proved to be a perfect stay. I ordered a pick-up and drop-off service. Both drivers were very nice. The one who picked us up at the airport also wore a uniform and held up a welcome sign. Check in was also quick. Because I am a member, I have upgraded my administrative benefits. Room service is also good. Every day when we meet by chance in the corridor, we always take the initiative to say hello and ask when it is convenient to clean the room. Room service is also good. The child sleeps in alone. I called the front desk to help deliver the food. The child's phone watch is also turned off. The delivery person probably knocked for a long time before the child opened the door. It’s almost 11:00. 🥹Thank you🙏. The staff in the executive lounge on the 23rd floor are very nice. The young man and young woman are all handsome and elegant. Whether it's a surprise gift for us on Valentine's Day or daily services, we're always here to help. Unfortunately, my memory is not very good, so the English names of several employees are a bit blurry. Thanks again 🙏! The coffee bar in the lobby on the first floor is also good. Come for a drink every day. It's not coffee, it's beer. Haha The location of the hotel is also good, very close to Suning Plaza and Wanxianghui shopping mall. There is also a coffee shop next to it. What kind of gathering? Forgot the name again. In front of the hotel lobby are parks and public sports fields. Basketball, football, and badminton courts are all available. Unfortunately, my son's and I's equipment was couriered home in advance. There are too many people in the old town, so I took my parents to visit the old place like a quick tour.
Enjoy minibar benefits:
The Chinese restaurant on the second floor is also good. The grouper fish porridge soup is delicious. It seems to be a black pearl. Book in advance, there are not many people.
During the holidays, additional charges are normal, but service attitude and quality are not compromised.
Will come again if given the chance!

They also gave us the hotel's buffet breakfast and drink coupons for the lobby bar. The room facilities are comfortable and clean, and the hotel has dedicated underground parking spaces, which is very convenient for guests traveling by car. It turns out that the reason why we didn't book the hotel's breakfast buffet is that it's not far from the hotel (a few minutes' walk) to Shantou Longyan South Road, a street full of food and drink. But the hotel's buffet breakfast is still very good. The front desk also provided information on the time and location of Spring Festival celebrations during the Spring Festival in Shantou, as well as Shantou’s specialty food locations, phone numbers and other information. It was so thoughtful! It is convenient for guests to explore Shantou.

msg:During this trip before the Spring Festival, the two families chose to stay at the Shantou Sheraton Hotel and were generally satisfied.
First of all, the hotel is strategically located with abundant commerce around it. It is also a step away from Suning Plaza and Vientiane City is just across the road. The south gate of the hotel faces Times Square and is not far from the seaside. As Times Square is building an intercity railway, it will be more convenient to travel to Jieyang, Chaozhou and Jieyang Airport in the future. The straight-line distance from the hotel to the food street is less than one kilometer. The No. 105 bus you plan to take to the island is also opposite Times Square.
Secondly, in the face of large passenger flow, the hotel's overall service is very standardized. In addition to upgrading two rooms on the day of check-in, it can also be on call when dealing with emergencies, especially for blocked drains in rooms and bathrooms. The handling of the sliding door sinking was very professional. The front desk also paid us a return visit in a timely manner and also provided us with breakfast at the hotel. Of course, the hotel's breakfast is also very rich, and the dishes are adjusted every day.
Furthermore, the sanitation work is well implemented, and the floor service staff can clean the bathroom in advance according to our needs, which is very good.
The hotel also handles conferences and wedding banquets, which are held every day during your stay. It can be seen that the hotel is just organized and well-trained, and does not affect other guests.
In short, Sheraton Hotel is a good choice when traveling to Shantou.

Facilities: The hotel room has a 2-meter large bed, which is relatively comfortable to sleep on.
Environment: I arrived in Shantou a few years ago, and the entire hotel has a strong New Year a**osphere.
Service: The hotel service is still very good. They took the initiative to call me to inform me that there were guests on the same floor who were going to welcome their bride that night and it might be noisy. I asked if I needed to reserve another floor to change rooms because we had to rush early the next morning. There was no hassle of changing rooms after the flight, and the hotel even offered breakfast for the second day.

Breakfast has a complete range of Chinese and Western dishes, and the freshly cooked rice noodle soup is delicious. The room was cleaned in a timely manner and the service was very good. The room faces the library and the parking lot. There will be the sound of construction vehicles at night and early in the morning, and from time to time there will be the roar of heavy objects falling to the ground. Traveling during the day will not have much impact, but it will wake you up at night and affect your sleep. After staying for three days, the first I was given a white fungus soup one night after I checked in. On the third night, I called the customer service to give feedback on the accommodation. After I told them about the situation, the customer service said that it might be due to drilling work and they could arrange to change rooms. I thought it was a bit troublesome and my mother had already taken a rest. Not wanting to go through all the trouble, the hotel gave us two portions of white fungus soup. Now that I think about it, I should have asked to change rooms after I found out on the first day, so that I would be more comfortable later on. The main reason was that I was afraid of trouble, and the hotel was pretty good.

Someone called us the day before we checked in to ask how old our children were (because we booked a family room). They can prepare toiletries for us, and the front desk is also very nice. They ask you if there is anything you need help with every day. The beauties are very considerate. Another thing is that we were traveling from Chaozhou to Shantou. The Chaozhou driver was not familiar with this hotel and parked outside the hotel. The service staff at the door immediately ran down to help us carry our boxes. When we left, we got out of the elevator and someone was there immediately. It was nice of me to help you carry the box. Anyway, the service is the best. Besides, the hotel room is very big. It is more than 10 meters and nearly 20 meters from the door to the window. There is a 4 or 5 square meter cloakroom. I like it to be as good as at home. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry. You will also receive an exquisite dessert on the day of check-in.

The concierge contacted me many times to apologize, and also took the initiative to send a double breakfast. Especially when the child suffered from acute gastroenteritis the day before he came back, the concierge and service staff went out of their way to help solve the problem. They cleaned the room many times. Seeing that the child was not feeling well, they took the initiative to bring white porridge and delicious side dishes in the evening. He felt at home. Thank you very much! ! Next time I have the opportunity to come to Shantou, I will choose this hotel again! ! Worth recommending👍👍

The location is also very good. It is just a few steps away from Wanxianghui in the center of the city. Overall, it is still good. Highly recommended and very comfortable, but the drink coupons provided in the lobby bar are a bit average. Other services and check-in experience are still very good.

Hygiene: The entire hotel feels clean and tidy, the rooms are comfortable, and the bedding is very good, in line with the standards of international hotel chains
Facilities: All the facilities expected of an international chain hotel are available. The breakfast is rich, the ingredients are fresh, and the special Chaoshan delicacies and snacks are very delicious. The restaurant is spacious enough that you can sit by the window and watch people doing Tai Chi in the yard while eating. It's very enjoyable.
Environment: The hotel is in a very good location, very close to Suning Plaza in Vientiane City, and the food and transportation are very convenient. But it’s not too noisy, and it’s a quiet location amidst the noise.

This kind of room is rare in hotels, but I actually booked it at the Shantou Star Hotel Sheraton. It was a great surprise. Customer service contacted me before and after checking in to inquire about my needs. It's not as cold as a star-rated hotel. The fitness center sells swimming caps and the service is very good. The breakfast is rich and has Chaoshan characteristics. The three coffee machines are the highlight. All in all, I am very satisfied. The price will fluctuate if you extend your stay for a weekend, so try to avoid it in the future🙅🙅

msg:At first, because of the Shantou Marathon, I originally wanted to find a cheaper hotel, but in the end I had to choose the Sheraton Hotel. When I checked in on 22/12/23, Jason was kind enough to upgrade two rooms for me to the executive floor. Since I’m not used to local food, I wasn’t actually full after dinner. But when I got back to the hotel, it was already around 10 p.m. Fortunately, Clara and Alma on the executive floor brought cookies and milk to my son and me even if we weren’t full. Feeling hungry.
I have purchased a breakfast buffet for breakfast, which can be eaten on the executive floor. However, the disadvantage is that there are fewer choices. Because I ordered noodles, basically fried garlic and chopped green onions and sesame oil were not available, so I ended up having to get the buffet on the ground floor. There will be more varieties, but The queue to get food was a bit confusing. In the morning, there was porridge, but because there were too many people, the order cut off at 8:15. The worst thing was that the porridge I ordered was not available, so the staff asked him to give me a second pot, and it was hot. There was no staff to refill the milk, but the situation improved the next day because there were less people. As a 5-star hotel, you should pay attention.

There are 2 rooms, and the other one I had was a sea view room on the executive floor. In addition to the sea view, the hotel facilities may also be older. The wardrobe is very thin and there is not enough space to put clothes. There was a female staff member that night who spoke Cantonese and understood what I was looking for. They came to buy me a clothes rack to solve the problem of my wardrobe being thin. On the second night, I don’t know why, no matter how I adjusted the room temperature to 18 degrees, the room was still very hot. I asked the female staff who can speak fluent Cantonese and said that there was no solution because of the central air-conditioning. She adjusted it again, but she didn't walk away because she couldn't help me. She responded quickly and found a floor fan for me, and asked me if I wanted to open the window. Although the hotel facilities are old, I can definitely feel the attentiveness of the staff.
I had a bad feeling about checking out at the end. The hotel did not arrange a queue for check in and check out. It took me about 10-15 minutes. There were also 3 queues reserved for check in or check out guests. I think the hotel did not arrange this. It needs improvement, but overall I have a very good impression of the hotel. I will choose it next time when I go back to my hometown to visit relatives.

msg:It's a pity that there is no water~

I have been in Shantou for a few days and stayed here for a short time. I really felt the friendliness of every clerk~ The important thing is that Wu Jiachun, who helped me check in, and the manager on duty (who seems to be named Zhang?) who contacted me later, were all super. Nice, it was a very pleasant stay experience~

The location of the hotel is also very convenient. It only takes five minutes to walk to shopping malls such as Vientiane City. It is also very convenient to the food street where snacks gather, including the small park a little further away. There are shared electric vehicles at the door. Taking a taxi costs about ten yuan, which is very convenient.

The environment in the room is also good. Although it is not too close to the seaside, there are rooms with sea views. You can also see their open-air swimming pool through the window. Unfortunately, I was not able to go into the water this time. The swimming pool is also very beautiful~

The room is very comfortable, with shower and bathtub, and hot water is very good~

The breakfast at the hotel also has quite a variety of varieties, including some local specialties such as rice cakes and raw porridge. Even if you are attending a meeting out of town and don’t have time to eat local snacks, you can still experience it here~

Before leaving, the staff called me to ask for feedback. They also paid special attention to the feedback. The service was really great~

2. The hotel environment is very good. Although it has been open for a long time, the room is generally well maintained. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and it is cleaned very well every day.

3. When checking in and checking out, the front desk service attitude was very good. I was fortunate enough to upgrade the room this time, nice!

If I travel to Chaoshan next time, I will continue to choose Sheraton.

The location is excellent, yet quiet in the midst of the hustle and bustle. The breakfast is very good, and you can basically taste Shantou specialties. The service was even better. Because I didn't like the executive floor room I was initially assigned (because it was close to the elevator), so I chose a room on the common floor facing the sun. The hotel called me several times to remind me that I could still enjoy the executive lounge benefits. I said the room needed to be replenished with water, so I just sent that amount at one time. The hand-drawn map is also very thoughtful. All in all, extremely considerate service, I will definitely come again

Facilities: The hotel facilities are very complete and the completeness rate is also very high. The carpet is also very comfortable. The bathroom floor mats are also very comfortable.

Hygiene: Hygiene is very clean. Although the hotel has not been renovated in recent years, it is well maintained without any peculiar smell. (¯▽¯)👍

Environment: The surrounding scenery is very good and the view is wide. Originally, I thought the hotel was located in a bustling area of ​​the city center, but I didn't expect it to be very quiet. However, I wanted to go shopping and just a few steps downstairs was Vientiane City. very convenient.

Service: The service is very considerate. Wherever I go, I will greet the staff proactively. When checking in, I also asked carefully if I had any travel plans, and provided a map and guide, which was very considerate and saved a lot of trouble for the next trip.
Breakfast: The breakfast variety is pretty good. What's more distinctive is the local rice noodles (probably hahaha) and porridge, both of which are great.
The lobby door is not an automatic door, but the service staff will take the initiative to open the door and pick up the luggage. The service is indeed in place.
A little suggestion: There are a little few charging piles in the hotel. In addition, there are parking spaces for hotel guests in the ba*****t, but many of them are ground-locked and cannot be parked. It takes a while to find a parking space.
Double executive lounge benefits: The service in the executive lounge is also very good, the scenery is good and the field of vision is wide, and the proactive guidance on travel strategies is very enthusiastic, and the drinks and meals are also very good.
Lobby bar drink coupon: The coffee in the lobby is good. Even if you don't use the coupon, a cup of coffee is only 9.9 yuan, which is very affordable.

Thank you to the check-in lady for carefully writing various time periods on the room card. She was thoughtful and considerate.
Upon entering the room, I received a thoughtful note and a small gift from Liu Shuang, the housekeeping manager.
Special thanks to Eleven Ye, the waiter at the executive lounge, for her friendly smile and considerate service. In addition to giving us a beautiful map and nearby famous restaurant addresses, she also explained the traffic conditions in detail and gave us suggestions👍
In addition, the hotel also gave me a birthday cake and small gifts. I was very happy and had an unforgettable birthday holiday!

msg:This time I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel for a week, and I couldn't express my feelings. Both the front desk and the room service were very good. Especially Jiayi, Yueying, Wannan, and Yuyao from the executive lounge. They patiently and meticulously asked what help they needed every breakfast. After busy work, coffee, milk, and juice were delivered to the table, and they took the initiative to introduce dishes and desserts. It was my husband's birthday. Delicious cakes and small gifts were also specially prepared, and Chaoshan tourist hotspots and food maps were introduced in detail. We will choose the Sheraton executive room next time we come to Shantou. It is indeed worth the money.

One is maintenance. Although the hotel has been renovated for almost ten years, it is a bit old, but the facilities and equipment are very well maintained, especially the elevator🛗. The second is detail processing. The warm air in front of the bathroom mirror not only prevents the mirror from fogging, but also ensures that the bathroom is dry and comfortable. The coffee and milk containers on the breakfast table in the western restaurant are carefully wrapped in plastic wrap, which is both hygienic and respectful to the guests. Third, the quality of breakfast products is very high. Chinese, Western, Japanese and Chaoshan local characteristics are all available. The raw porridge is amazing. Fourth, service with a smile and honorific service can be seen everywhere. All in all a very good experience.

Maybe because of the typhoon, there were many "eat snacks" that basically didn't have to queue up. It was very refreshing. Sheraton also gave a surprise and upgraded the sea view for free. Although the decoration of the room took a long time, it was well maintained. The whole room has a strong old money style. It can be seen that it was probably the top spot in Shantou when it first opened. The hotel is strategically located, next to Suning and Vientiane City. There are many food check-in spots next to it. Although it is a bit far from the small park, it is very close to the food. The hotel is clean and tidy, with complete facilities, free parking and friendly service. Come back next time I will definitely stay here again when visiting Shantou Citywalk.

msg:Location: The location is excellent, very close to Longyan South Road on foot, and not far from various attractions such as small parks.

Room configuration: I booked a double bed room, which can be regarded as a five-star hotel. There is no tea bag... and the room is very small, compact and crowded, and the price/performance ratio is a bit low.

Sanitation status: The overall sanitation and cleaning are relatively meticulous. I am a clean freak, and I have basically found no dead spots. It is not easy for an old hotel that has been in operation for so many years to maintain this hygienic environment.

Service attitude: This is what I criticized the most. When I first checked in, I asked the front desk if I needed to pay for the upgrade of the sea view room. I helped to upgrade, and then operated for a long time. For some reason, a male waiter communicated next to it, and it became impossible to upgrade. There were still rooms, but told us that there were no rooms. In fact, it is not necessary. If you need to add money, I can accept it, just let me know. Then the male waiter said that if there is a room in the next few days, he will tell me (I stayed for 4 days in total) to change it for me, and then there is no more news.
Secondly: During the check-in process, I called the front desk to inquire about the opening and closing time of the swimming pool. I was also very impatient and didn't understand the reason...
Finally: When checking out, because each hotel is different, after returning the room card, I am not sure whether to check the room, so I wait at the front desk. After waiting for a while, the front desk said "Return the card and you can go...", then I It's been a long time since the card was returned, why didn't you say it, why didn't you say it when the card was returned, I was standing in front of him! It took a long time to say it, and the tone of "you don't know if you can leave after returning the card", really makes people speechless.
I heard that Marriott is going to open in Shantou. If the location is good, I really don't want to choose this place.

msg:Ms. Wu*chun at the front desk is very nice. Not only did she patiently introduce us to places to eat and drink in detail, she also helped us upgrade our room to a sea view room. The service attitude is super good. Let me have a good impression of this place in Shantou. The room was a double bed room with sea view, the sanitation was very good, the room was relatively spacious, and the view was also very good. The overall feeling of visiting Shantou this time is very good. There is a convenient small battery for going out, and you can also take a Didi taxi, which is cheap and convenient. The hotel's Haagen-Dazs is also good, cheaper than outside counters. In summer, the family goes back to the hotel after going out and eats a cold ice cream, happy! If you can consider that there is a gas station for enjoying the shade when you go out, and give some anti-mosquito stickers, small fans, lollipops, stickers, etc. to the children staying at home, I feel that this humanistic service is more in place. Although the hotel service is already good, but it would be perfect if it can better care for the mood and happiness of the children traveling with their parents.

Since I booked a city-view room on the Marriott Member App for one night and then made up for another night on Ctrip, the double-bed room at the agreed location was gone, so I was too lazy to talk to him. When I got to the room, a switchboard supervisor surnamed Xiao knew my situation and was a Marriott member and upgraded me to a suite for free. Thank you very much for giving me 5 stars, the location of the hotel is 5 stars, and the hotel room service is 5 stars. It is also close to Nan'ao Island, but it is recommended to rent a car locally. The hotel has an underground garage.

The hotel itself is in a quiet corner, but it's very convenient to walk a few minutes to the main street lined with restaurants.

msg:On the ninth day of the new year, my family traveled to Shantou and stayed at the Sheraton. I called the store the night before to confirm that we checked in at 3 pm, but we arrived at the hotel on time at 3 pm. The room has not been cleaned yet, because I still want to go out to play, so I can only put the luggage on it first, and the auntie continues to clean up~ We have a car full of people, old and young, and we are tired after a long day of driving. We wanted to take a rest We went to play in half an hour, an hour later, because the sanitation was not cleaned well, so we had to go out to play first, so we stayed very tired that night. I hope the store service can keep up. After all, such a large chain enterprise, service is the most important

Went out to play with friends, local friends recommended Sheraton Shantou, very satisfied!
Especially the service of the hotel is very good. Alma, who helped me check in, was very enthusiastic and introduced me to the hotel's facilities.
The room is large, the bathroom is large and clean! There is a shower and a bathtub, with wet and dry separation
There are a lot of small shops where you can check in and eat. It takes a few minutes to ride an electric car at the door. It is not far from the small park and the Vientiane City.
Very recommended to stay, the best hotel in Shantou.

msg:I was destroyed at two points: the first was the Western-style buffet lunch. This was the worst buffet I have ever had in a five-star hotel in my life so far. It can be described as tragic. The photo was taken by me with lighting and angle. ...you can probably see the smell of fat from this steak! Have you seen Malatang? Same taste! The sushi is made of machine-cut rice that is as hard as a small stone. The salmon is so rotten ~ like leftover swill... The dessert is so good that it makes my teeth hurt! Then when I checked in, I was told that there was no service. If I wanted to clean it, I had to change rooms... I looked at a few of my boxes... I silently decided to clean it myself... So every day I had to wash the bathtub, load the garbage, wipe the table, and pick up the hair in the bathroom... After finishing the series, I feel like I am just here to do a job... I am so sorry for the Sheraton brand! In special times, we understand that cleaning can be done quickly and with good protection! But what’s the point of letting guests be self-reliant? We are tired from traveling! And the buffet is really intolerable! The cooking oil is obviously stale! In the end, I had diarrhea for a day...I was dehydrated...luckily I brought berberine to save myself! Of course, I have to clean the toilet myself... When I checked out, I was in a hurry to catch a flight, so I didn't say anything and I didn't bother to say it... What else can I ask for after all the trouble... I hope to improve in the future to match this brand and price!

Of course, I could change it, but the smell in the other room was so strong that I called someone to come and do it. It also smelled really bad! Then the hotel said they didn’t have any rooms and didn’t care! Then in the first room, when we first checked in, we didn't do anything. There was already a pair of opened slippers on the floor and a bag of opened candies on the bedside table. None of this belongs to us! The overall experience is relatively poor! I feel like the hotel won't be very proactive in helping you if you have a problem.

The customer service phone is basically answered with one ring, and the processing speed is very fast. In particular, the switchboard manager, Xiao Shen, handles problems with human nature, fast, and has a very good attitude. On the last day, my child was sick. I called the switchboard and asked for a cup of hot milk and hot water, and then I helped deliver the medicine I bought to the room. Manager Xiao Shen took the initiative to ask if the child was sick, and offered to send us a white porridge to the room. The problem was really handled from the perspective of the customer. All the waiters in the hotel were very enthusiastic. When we left, we saw that we had brought our children and gave souvenirs of small dolls. I have stayed in too many hotels, although Sheraton Logan is not the best hardware, but the service can be said to be the best. In addition, the Chinese restaurant on the second floor is also good and cheap. If there is a chance to come to Shantou in the future, I will definitely choose to stay again.

When you come to Shantou to rent a car, you must not rent a car from Wuzhou Car Rental, No. 30 Huanghe Road, Wuzhou Auto City, it is a black shop, everyone must not be fooled. I rented a commercial vehicle from August 8 to August 11 at 11 o'clock. The license plate is *******, and the mobile phone number of the brother who delivered the car is *********. He contacted me and said that if I wanted to renew the lease, I could just place an order on Ctrip to renew the lease. As a result, the signal on Nan'ao Island was very poor. I contacted 2929 and said that we wanted to renew the lease. He said casually that it was no problem. As a result, when I left Nan'ao Island and there was a signal, I could no longer renew the lease because the vehicle had been rented out. When we arrived in the city, it was already past two o'clock, and the merchant said that we must return the car at three o'clock. We were late, so we said we would renew the lease until 4 o'clock. The guy from 2929 said he would come to pick us up, but he didn't come to pick us up when we arrived at the designated location. He asked us to go to the store. After we arrived at the store, we two girls were not allowed to leave. The lady boss said that 2929 had never said she agreed to renew the lease, and forced us to pay more than 6,000 yuan in liquidated damages. In the end, because we were in a hurry and really didn't want to argue with the ugly-faced lady boss, we were allowed to leave after we paid 3,450 yuan (3,000 via WeChat, 450 in cash). I was stupid at the time and forgot to call the police. Don't be fooled.

I asked if we can park BMW or Mercedes-Benz. He said sorry, we can't park. Later, I saw a Honda parked (my friend and I have Lexus, BMW and Ideal). I thought about it and went to the underground parking lot. I went up to the front desk to get the room at 1 o'clock. The front desk said that it hadn't been cleaned yet. I said it didn't matter and I would go to eat. Then I came to get the room at 3 o'clock. I went to the front desk and said sorry, it had been cleaned and I had to wait. I went to talk to them. It was still not ready. A group of more than 10 children were standing and waiting. She said that it takes an hour for our hotel to clean a room. There is only one person on the floor. It's not that easy. I waited for more than 30 minutes. I went to the room to change clothes and swim. A group of children went down. When I got to the swimming pool, my son and daughter didn't wear swimming caps (the children were excited to see the water). The hotel staff shouted at them two or three times. It's just a cap? The tone of voice was like **? Well, there is not much space to find a smoking place in a big game pool on the fifth floor. Don’t say that your Sheraton Hotel is great, you can also smoke in the public areas of Macau. Well, I went to have dinner and came back. I went to the lobby door and saw that the middle and the sides were full of small Hondas, Volkswagens, and trams. I want to ask if my ten-year-old Lexus is looked down upon by people? Or did the security guard smoke because I didn’t give him cigarettes? Or do I have to give a red envelope to park? I am impressed by this amazing hotel. The next day I woke up and saw a family of three playing in the game pool without hats. No one cared or said anything? I am just a small customer, and I have offended your big five-star hotel? All the sockets in the room have to be pushed in with force. That’s it. I can’t afford to stay in your big hotel anymore. And to all the Lexus car owners, I am so despised.

1. I was very tired when I arrived at the store late at night. I stopped when I saw that there was a parking lot on the ground, and there was no prompt that only temporary parking was allowed. The people who came up to talk things temporarily can stop), let us park in the underground parking lot, the attitude is very unfriendly, and we also noticed a big G and a BMW parked firmly (even the next morning) ), they just want us to move it, so now we have to drive out the luxury car at home to stay in a five-star hotel?
2. The underground parking lot of the hotel is also very silent. The guest can enter by swiping the room card or face. As a result, the two methods cannot be opened. Every time you enter, you must contact the management center to open the door;
3. The hotel staff generally have no business etiquette. After checking in, the little brother who helped pull the luggage was reluctant, swiped the room card for the renewal of the stay and returned his face, and he would not take the initiative to see the staff at various locations in the hotel. Say hello, if it wasn't because it was too much trouble to change the hotel, and the subsequent bookings could not be cancelled, I would really change a hotel;
4. The socket in the room is a traditional zero-line with a lock. All we bring are two-pin plugs that cannot be used directly. The drain valve that goes back to the bathtub has not been put back, and there is no turndown service;
If you want to charge the price of a five-star hotel, please go to see how the service of your peers is done first.

As a veteran hotel, Sheraton is naturally the first recommendation for a trip to Shantou in every city. I would have worried about the 14-year renovation. Will it be too old? After I arrived, I found that I thought too much. The decoration is still very new. The location is eye-catching and easy to find. It is very close to delicious places. The room is clean and tidy. The staff at the front desk was very kind and patient when I checked in at the hotel at night. It happened that it was not a holiday. The front desk kindly helped us upgrade our sea view room. Because it was facing the sea, it felt a little damp, and he immediately changed the room for us. Really Very good~ It looks more luxurious in the daytime. It is indeed an old five-star hotel and there is a large swimming pool to play in.

My son forgot the big bath towel and called me that day.
I feel very moved.
Last year I lived in Shanghai Ruijin Intercontinental. I forgot a white dress and called to ask for help, but I said no. Of course, I couldn't find it in the entire suitcase. There was a comparison, so I was moved.
The swimming pool is good, I have used it for two days, it would be better if it was more standard

The service lady standing at the door has been playing with her mobile phone. When she saw us pushing our luggage through the door, no one opened the door. So she was just playing with her mobile phone at the door?
When the concierge sees a guest pushing his luggage, he avoids it. What kind of hotel is this? Worst hotel I have ever seen!

msg:In addition to the good location of this hotel, which is very close to the Vientiane City, the breakfast is not bad and the parking is very convenient. Others let me down! This is the worst Sheraton five-star hotel I've ever stayed in. I don't know if the builder and decoration company fooled Longguang? Or did Longguang black out the big name Sheraton? Or they are in unison, anyway, the customer experience does not meet the standard of a five-star hotel at all! A few questions: 1. The sockets in the room are fake and inferior, and the plugs of the kettle do not match the sockets. It can be seen that the customer had to force the plugs. As a result, the traces around the sockets are very heavy (see the picture). In fact, a converter can be added. , unfortunately not! 2. The executive room I live in has such a bad sofa. I have never encountered it before (see picture)! 3. The side cabinet of the desk turned out to be a fake, the drawer can't be opened, yes it's fake, it really opened my eyes! (See picture), the overall furniture of the room is at most Samsung level! 4. To see such an unkind reminder (see picture), regardless of whether the hotel is eligible to impose fines on customers, this statement is completely inconsistent with the sacred law of "customer first" in five-star hotels! The price/performance ratio of this hotel is poor. Did I live in a fake Sheraton, but its price is completely achieved! Totally do not recommend this hotel! ! !

Simply book a Sheraton! I want to have a better ritual experience! The lady at the front desk has a friendly attitude and professional work. The check-in and check-out process is very smooth. Mineral water needs to be delivered in the middle. The service is also in place, and the speed is smooth👍
🌟＜Location, Food Preferred Center＞Located in the city center, the transportation is very convenient, surrounded by Vientiane, Suning, Qunguang shopping malls, referred to as Food Yiyi (Longyan Road Internet celebrity Xiaowuchangfen! Leverage!) Very lively 🧐 Two people After eating, I went to Lin Baixin for a walk at the back of the hotel. The weather is really not too comfortable☁️～
🌟＜Environmental Sanitation＞ The hotel lobby and room environment are really clean! Very comfortable stay! The dining area is clearly marked, and the floor of the room is chosen to be higher, and it can also face the first-line sea view. The room size is suitable for sisters, couples, and a family of three. It is spacious and bright. The maintenance of the room type in the main building is very good. Overall, the price/performance ratio of the package is good. Occasionally, the holiday hotel will hold an event price. I want to come again next time! ! It's perfect for a relaxing vacation.
🌟＜Facilities＞The hotel's facilities are very complete, free Wi-Fi, sitting sofa 🛋️, manual curtains 🪟, oversized bathtub 🛁 good dry and wet separation, 2-meter bed 🛏️, and there is also a special fitness area, outdoor Swimming area 🏊‍♀️, sauna 🧖‍♀️ and washing area 👔! Just don't be too kind! ! 😌

It is located in the center of the city, and it is very convenient to go in and out. You can walk to the city of Vientiane on foot. From check-in to check-out in the hotel lobby, you can feel the sincere service. Haha, it is very gentle to call and consult. Even the uncle who parked the car is very gentle and patient, which makes me feel so warm. The floor view is good, and I can see the sea in the distance. Fruits are also prepared. Now the epidemic situation has also prepared masks and sterilizing wipes. Details. The buffet breakfast has Chaoshan-style kway teow soup haha. We all had a good meal. This time we stayed here and felt the enthusiasm of Chaoshan people and the five-star service of the hotel. There are too many delicacies here. .

The waiter did not clean it thoroughly because the table was dark and the oil stains on the table were left intact. I booked an executive room and checked in. I was told that the executive lounge was not available and I could order food in the room. I was given a free menu. I ordered a few snacks and left them there intact. It felt like a buffet. The remaining fries were like pimp soup and it was cold. There was basically no response from the concierge to the front desk. Familiar with business invoicing, the concierge girl stored luggage for half an hour and said she was new and didn’t know how to go through the formalities. The standard of a five-star business hotel is that I won’t stay here again.

The service is okay, but we left something and didn't call me. The location of the hotel is very convenient, and eating around is also very convenient.

As the flight time is close to the evening, Sara, the front desk manager, at our request, thoughtfully delayed our check-out time by a few hours for free. So heart-warming! The fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel equipment is a bit outdated

msg:The hotel is very clean and comfortable, and the decoration is not as earthy as their own pictures. It is the best hotel in the area, much cleaner than the neighboring Harbour Plaza. The first night I saw the pictures and thought the decoration was too earthy, so I didn't choose Sheraton and went to Haiyi, but when I went there, I found that Haiyi was still not clean enough. I came to Sheraton on the second night. It was not soiled to the naked eye. The front desk service was very good, very clean, very satisfied, and not expensive at this price. And the location is good, a few minutes walk to the best shopping mall in Shantou👍 great

位置絕佳，樓下是熱門商圈，距離龍眼路小吃街步行可達，酒店還會提供一份美食指南。
傳統老牌酒店，房間大，海景房視野開闊，設施雖然沒有新興酒店那麼多智能噱頭，但是我個人更喜歡這種穩重的風格，尤其隔音好，環境安靜。
房間居然準備了功夫茶具和法壓壺，這太有意思了。
服務非常好，由於帶着長者和輪椅，每次打車出去回來，都有人幫忙開車門拿東西，特別感謝。

服務佳，在辦理入住時，有禮賓主動開車門，前台熱情，整個過程非常迅速。在離店時，交還房卡後很快就返回按金，效率很高。特別是小沈，工作細緻入微。
客房是中規中矩的古典設計，燈光與裝飾都以暗色調為主；
早餐是中西式自助餐品豐富；
總的來説，汕頭龍光喜來登酒店是一家值得推薦的豪華酒店，服務周到，設施完善。

最後，酒店的位置一流，軟硬件均是汕頭數一數二，房間整潔乾淨，窗外景色秀美開闊。如果要汕頭停留，龍光喜來登是你的不二選擇！

msg:酒店整體還是挺好的，前台工作人員和客房服務人員也很專業熱情～但是餐廳服務就差了一點，也許是早餐用餐客人多吧。早餐雖然是自助式，那是不是也該有工作人員引導到餐位，自助式早餐不可以打包這確實規定，但是如果客人用餐的時候拿了水果（衹拿了兩樣水果，一樣一個，但是由於太涼了，拿出去吃不可以嗎？）是不是可以做點人性化的變通？其他五星級酒店也住過，文華東方，麗思卡爾頓，一般會給住店客人拿餐盒帶到客服。可是貴店工作人員告知，就必須在餐廳吃，哪怕吃不完浪費，也別帶走。🙂而且態度也不怎麼好，可是桌子上還擺着不要浪費的提示。本來不想吐槽，但是貴店還希望給出好評。下次來不會選擇會貴店了。

衞生：酒店房間的衞生也打掃的很乾凈，每次我們出門回來，阿姨都把房間打掃的乾乾淨淨，連我們自己的物件都歸置的很整齊👍👍👍

設施：這也是我們此次最想吐槽的地方，酒店設施太陳舊了，衣櫃的門沒關緊的話，就一直嘎嘎響.裏面的wifi離線就必須重新連結，真是第一次碰到😂😂😂這樣設施的酒店，價錢也不算便宜，除了地理位置優越之外，真的，憑着酒店所有服務人員齊心協力，温暖的服務得了這5星好評，不容易啊他們👍👍👍

ps：南澳島真的很美。由於房間的照片都有娃在的，為了避免暴露私隱衹能放風景圖了。

室外游泳池是需要戴泳帽的，大小朋友都是30元，游泳圈可以單次租用20元，游泳池有點小，但夏天小朋友玩水就玩得很開心了
地理位置也很優越，汕頭站搭車15-20分鐘，鄰近萬象廣場，到小公園也是15-20分鐘左右
再來汕頭也會再次入住的

ps：謝謝酒店曾送小朋友的刮刮彩色畫，不過這個畫刮下來的黑色的屑屑真的好難清理。有的弄到裏酒店的地毯上，我們試着收集了但太難了。而且真的安全嗎？小朋友玩完，手都是黑黑的。

     酒店通過攜程預訂，也是一再篩選，本人住過全國各地太多五星級酒店，但汕頭龍光喜來登酒店不愧是汕頭口碑星級酒店。房間寬敞明亮，整潔衞生，物品齊全，床鋪特別舒服，軟而不塌，挺而不擱。衞生間挺大，馬桶間、淋浴間、浴盆各自獨立。淋浴間有頂式淋蓬頭，水壓超大，洗浴非常舒服。驚歎贊歎的是早餐廳，除了五星級酒店該有的全部各式中西餐點，最誘人的是“潮汕美食”檔，切好的新鮮肉類隨便自己選取，想吃啥夾啥，想吃多少夾多少，再選取各類封面，女師傅們為你煮好，我看所有客人都是一大碗。太好吃了。這裏不來，終生遺憾。汕頭龍光喜來登，我為你點贊！為你鼓掌。一定再來。這一趟出行還有五個地方五個五星級酒店，有比較就會有鑒別。我都會以汕頭龍光喜來登做標桿，來判定酒店質量及性價比。

msg:汕頭喜來登酒店是汕頭唯一一家萬豪旗下五星酒店，酒店位置非常優越，大堂上方的水晶燈很耀眼。設施齊全，接觸到的每位工作人員都十分友好，熱情。各方面不失五星級水準。入住的房間乾淨整潔，客房阿姐好不熱情。總機的服務很優秀，總機沈經理給我留下了很好的印象。給她點贊。

msg:我想盡量寫得客觀些。
大家也知道，汕頭幾乎沒有豪華品牌的酒店。
喜來登的這個也是龍光貼牌的。
硬件真的很好，五星是配得上的。軟件很糟。下地庫後，酒店的連接門廳很小，不易找到。並且停車指示牌存在明顯的自悖和誤導。停到所謂規定的C區，沒有任何指示牌可以依靠。
我把這些反饋給當晚值班經理（張小姐，我掃了一眼名卡，Knister Zhang，張璇；英文名把握80%，中文名把握50%），是她安撫了我的情緒，並主動識別出我太太是萬豪金卡會員，給升了房，加了早餐。安慰了客户的心寒！
我一直想找機會感謝這位張小姐，但後來行程匆匆，所以把對龍光喜來登這一段的表揚，貼在這裏。供參考！

酒店地理位置應該是位於汕頭最熱鬧的地方了，邊上萬象城、蘇寧、萬達商場出門即可到達。離各個網紅美食的飯店也很近。可惜這兩天有疫情，沒敢瞎兜。

最值得一提的是客服中心露娜，在得知我們的航班是傍晚18:00，幫我向他們經理申請，把退房時間延後到了16:00，以避免外出，減少接觸風險。

感謝露娜的幫忙！

msg:去汕頭吃喝，問了幾個朋友，推薦住萬象城附近，於是選擇了喜來登。

服務：首先，服務很好。前台的小哥哥、小姐姐會耐心、輕柔的回答你的問題，滿足你的需求。也會貼心的問你需不需要進行美食推薦。很棒。

設施：中規中矩。

環境：房間不算大，洗手間的空間較小，燈光較暗。另外，吹風機可以適當進行調整了。
