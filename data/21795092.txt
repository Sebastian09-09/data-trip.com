msg:Our room was a very comfortable Duplex. Breakfast was a spread. Location is convenient and close to several photo taking spots and the main tourist attraction - Dali ancient city. Service at this hotel is the most fantastic, one of the friendliest service staff we have met. On one occasion, they even assisted with the transferring of our laundry from the washer to the dryer - we didn’t had to wait to DIY and just went to bed, collected them at the reception then following morning - which was a very delightful experience for us. The hotel gym is also extremely well equipped if you need a workout to acclimatise to the higher altitude. Overall a very enjoyable stay for three of us.

msg:Awesome stay at Luchun - one of our best stay in China! Although they are not located within the ancient city but they have free rides over! The service is great, special call out to the drivers who were friendly and drove us around! Also special thanks to the staff 小管家 (慕雅和KIKI和初一) who were very responsive to our request on wechat, deliverying fruits, milk and additional items required. The breakfast was yummy too!! Definitely great stay. 

One part that can be improved is also on the bathroom amenities, there wasnt any place to hang clothes and it was quite hassle. The bathroom doors also quite see through so might wanna think twice for mixed gender groups.

Our room has view to the lake, so it's pretty nice.  Breakfast has good variety, but each day the food type is about the same , so by 3rd day I get a bit bored.  Service is excellent.  Overall, it's a well run hotel, good for kids as they have it's own garden, sometimes also release some rabbits for the kids to feed them.

The hotel provides free ethnic costumes that can be used for taking photos in the hotel. There are bathroom slippers and disposable toilet mats, which are very considerate.

By the way, the rice noodles for breakfast are highly recommended and delicious.

The room is quite normal. I like the recliner facing the window very much. It is very suitable for reading and watching the sky. I like it very much. The most reluctant thing before leaving is this big recliner.

The most worth mentioning is the service. There is a pick-up service. There is also a pick-up service to the ancient city every day. I came to Dali and realized how troublesome it is to take a taxi. How convenient it is to have a pick-up service.

The housekeepers (July, Chuyi, Xiaoyu) are also very considerate. Add WeChat in advance, and the service is very close. It is responsive to every request, but it doesn’t feel stiff and comfortable. The staff who are always ready to provide services in the lobby usually look like they like this job. This should be the first reason why the service can make people comfortable.

Next time you come, you can still stay here. It is very safe.

First: The location of the hotel is very good, very close to the ancient city of Dali, and the hotel also has a free pick-up service! The time is about nine o'clock in the evening. The hotel car is still very clean. And there is a food street next to the hotel, with super many delicious foods! The price is also relatively fair and reasonable.

Second: The hotel room has wooden floors, so you can tell at a glance whether the floor is dirty or not. When I opened the door, I was also amazed. It was very clean. It was the kind of warm solid wood furniture without any odor.

Third: There is a laundry room with drying in the hotel, and it is free. Laundry detergent is also provided (big brands can be used with confidence). This kills many hotels in seconds.

Fourth: The service attitude of the hotel staff is super good! Call to send something, it is also very fast and not indecisive. The hotel will give a pick-up/drop-off service once, as well as a succulent afternoon tea. The desserts for the afternoon tea are really delicious, and the coffee is also delicious.

Fifth: The hotel environment is very beautiful! The succulent garden is really suitable for taking various beautiful photos. Free ethnic costumes for taking photos!

Sixth: The hotel has rabbits, super cute rabbits, you can touch them at will. But if you don't feed the rabbits, they won't let you touch them. You can go to the hotel front desk to ask for vegetable leaves to feed the rabbits, which are also free.

In summary, the hotel environment is very good for taking photos. The service attitude is also impeccable. The location is also excellent. There are also super cute rabbits to touch!

msg:If the full score is 100, I would give it 150. It’s really great. I am very picky when choosing a hotel. I carefully selected a hotel in Dali before coming here. Because I didn’t want to live on the edge of Erhai Lake (if I had to stay in a sea-view room, which is another matter, I think the price is not worth it), I chose this one. Home is better than imagined! The first is that the service is good, sincerely. The smiles on the faces of every hotel staff and the gestures they make towards guests are all from the heart. The WeChat little housekeepers Qiyue and Jack asked me how I felt during the whole process, and even asked me the date of my flight before I arrived. On call, the room was prepared for me in advance. The rules are very clear and are completely considered from the customer's perspective. You can choose a round-trip transfer. I chose the high-speed train when I left the hotel in the morning. Because it was less than 7 o'clock, the hotel specially prepared dry milk and eggs for me and gave them to me when I left. A box of flower cakes. I asked if I would like hot milk every night, and even gave me coffee and a fruit basket on the first day. The hotel has a cooperative fleet of Erhai chartered cars. It is the hotel's own. The handsome Bai guy Li Shuai is particularly respectful. When I checked in and took a taxi on the first day, he paid special attention to my route and paid attention to safety. On the day of the chartered car, I was slow because I was traveling with an old man. It took eight It took half an hour, which was longer than the normal charter time. Master Li Shuai had no complaints and did not increase the price. Before getting on the bus, he would ask whether we preferred the culture or the scenery, and he would adjust the route at any time according to our needs. This level of service is beyond praise. The second is the hotel facilities and exquisiteness, which are exactly the same as the photos posted by netizens online, or even better than those in the photos. The double room I booked was super large, and the fact that the bathroom had a window for ventilation made it beat all five-star hotels. There are two wash basins, and disposable face towels are provided very carefully. The slippers for bathing are also sterilized. The automatic bed curtains, mattresses and pillows are very comfortable, and the night light system is advanced. In addition, what is very unique is that the two buildings in my building have an independent small courtyard. The other buildings are also very elegantly designed. The hotel is not small in size, the buffet in the lobby is great, and coffee is available at any time. Third, the location. I really like the location of the hotel. It is less than 3 kilometers away from the ancient city and the Erhai Lake is not far away. There are several universities nearby that add a romantic feeling to the hotel. Especially there is a downhill road next to it, with peach blossoms blooming all over the street (next to the Shanshuijian villa area), overlooking the Erhai Lake and Cangshan Mountain in the background. In the afternoon, the road is full of young men and women taking photos in the street. This is a street where Internet celebrities have opened up. It is so beautiful. , see photos for details. There are many places to eat around, and they are relatively affordable. All in all, this is a very satisfying accommodation experience for me. The most important thing in travel is accommodation. My good impression of Dali also comes from the good impression the hotel gave me.

msg:I came to Dali with my sister and chose this hotel. The hotel provides free pick-up and drop-off service! It's really considerate. As soon as I arrived at the hotel door, a little brother came to help me with the suitcase. The service attitude was super good. There was also good night milk at night🥛
The hotel style is Chinese light luxury style. There is free breakfast from 7.30-10:00 in the morning! It tastes super good😍 There is a super large garden on the first floor, like Alice Wonderland, with a lot of green plants🌳🌺💐~ It's super photogenic to take pictures with the little rabbit🐰. Free ethnic costumes are also provided for taking pictures
The hotel room is fully equipped, very clean and hygienic, and there is no noise at night! ! The rest is very comfortable. It is very convenient to pick up and drop off at the Dali Ancient Town! I am very satisfied with the whole process! Recommended to stay!

I have been to many cities and stayed in many hotels. During this trip to Dali, I chose Luchun, which is very warm. The warmth of the sun, the warmth of the locals, the warmth of the hotel, and the warmth of the little housekeepers Qiyue and Xiaoyu!
The hotel gives people a particularly warm feeling. The location of the hotel is good. Dali is very beautiful this season. The cherry blossoms on the famous road next to the hotel are in bloom and it is particularly beautiful to take pictures. It is very convenient to travel by highway. It only takes a few minutes to go to Dali Ancient Town. The hotel has a comfortable environment and a beautiful small courtyard. You can usually drink coffee and chat in the courtyard and enjoy your afternoon time.
The hotel room is simply furnished but fully equipped. Disposable face towels are thoughtfully prepared, which is a plus!
The hotel butler's service is enthusiastic. I was really cared for in Luchun. I would like to praise the hotel staff. I will choose Luchun again if I have the opportunity to come to Dali in the future!

The hotel handles many small details very well, including disposable face towels, good night milk, children's toiletries, and delicious welcome fruits. The rice noodles for breakfast are the most suitable to my taste that I have eaten in Dali these days. They are delicious. An important point: if you think the pillow is too high, the hotel provides latex pillows. The height is more suitable for children, which is really friendly to children's sleep. I would like to make two small suggestions: 1. You can prepare a disposable bath bag for the room bathtub. 2. Consider changing the bedding to a batch that doesn’t make too much noise when turned. Finally, I would like to give a thumbs up to the service of the little butler Mu Ya.

Although the location is a little far from the ancient city, the hotel provides pick-up and drop-off to the ancient city, and it is a separate pick-up and drop-off, so there is no need to wait for each other. The free airport pick-up can also be changed to a drop-off, which is very humane and convenient. The overall service is very online. Everyone in the hotel will be answered if you ask, and will take the initiative to help you solve the problem. Before check-in, the housekeeper will contact in advance, come out to help take the luggage, and deliver it to the room. The service is really perfect and just right. Thanks to the housekeeper (Amy/Jack/Chuyi), I have a very good stay experience in Dali. The small garden is full of succulents, and the layout is very childlike, and I feel the care.

The hotel is at the foot of Cangshan Mountain, so travel is very convenient (Didi to Dali Ancient City is about 9 yuan, which is cheap, and the hotel also provides free pick-up and drop-off services to Dali Ancient City). All staff at the hotel are very helpful and make you feel like you own the hotel. I brought my children with me, and the hotel thoughtfully upgraded the parent-child room (see the picture, the environment outside the room is very warm, the room is clean and smart, the bathroom is spacious, and it has Xiaoai intelligent voice control).
The butler also upgraded me for free the next day, thank you very much!

The yard is full of succulents, which shows that a lot of care has been taken. The room is not big, but the design is very reasonable and practical!
Hygiene is also done well, disposable face towels are a bonus, and hand-washed clothes can be taken downstairs to dry, which is much more convenient for long-distance travel!
I stayed in eight or nine hotels along the way. The children liked this one the most. Compared with the more than a thousand B&Bs in Haixi, it was really worth it! It’s even the best family hotel in Yangshuo. Children are given slippers and dental kits when they check in. They can feed little rabbits in the yard and they can run around on their own, freeing up parents!

The room facilities are complete, the environment is clean and sanitary, the service staff is enthusiastic, and they will help with luggage. There is also afternoon tea, which is rich and delicious. There are many beautiful succulents in the succulent garden, which are well taken care of, and there are also small animals. If I come to Dali again next time, I will definitely stay here again. The weather in Dali is really dry. It would be perfect if there was a humidifier in the room.

I was afraid that I would bring the wrong clothes, so I would like to express my special thanks to the housekeeper (July) who has been very patient in telling me.

The combination of leisure and entertainment is very good. I personally have the habit of working out in the morning. When I get down in the morning, I ask the front desk to help turn on the lights in the gym. The gym is very good. Clean and big!
Hygiene: Every corner of the hotel looks clean and well-organized. Not to mention the hygiene of the room. As soon as I entered the door, I smelled a light fragrance, which was very pleasant. Personally, I am used to looking at every corner when I enter the door. I was not disappointed and I couldn't find any problems. clean
Environment: I have to praise the little Switzerland at the foot of Cangshan Mountain. It is no exaggeration to say that the succulents in the garden are really super healing. There is a "brook" with a small bridge and the feeling of flowing water. When you look up, you can see Cangshan Mountain. Recently, there is a little snow on the top of Cangshan Mountain. The beauty is all about the scenery. I really don’t want to leave when I come here.
Service: Most of the employees in the hotel are locals. To be honest, they are really super enthusiastic. Our little housekeeper contacted me just after placing the order on the first day of junior high school to tell me about the services included. He also added WeChat to intimately inform the check-in instructions, including the weather conditions in Dali. They will send us a small hand-drawn map to let me know about Dali in advance. They are more like friends. At the door of the hotel, there are waiters rushing out to pick up the luggage. I am surprised that the hotel industry is now like this? Hahaha, including the daily pick-up and drop-off in the ancient city, everything can be arranged very quickly. Having said all that, I just hope that everyone can see this Baozan Hotel. See you next time.

msg:The hotel I saw online, all reviews said it was good for families with children, and the breakfast was rich, so I came~ Check-in: The butler who just placed the order started contacting me in July to inform me of precautions and travel guide. Booking 1 There was a king-size bed room, and we were upgraded to a sea-view room when we arrived at the hotel. We could see the distance and have space for the children to play, so we decided to stay for one more night. I stayed in Dali for 2 days. It is really a comfortable city, and staying in the hotel is convenient and comfortable. I extended my stay for another night, totaling 3 nights.
Location: The hotel is at the foot of Cangshan Mountain. You can see Cangshan Mountain when you look up. There is a landscape trail across the road. The environment is pleasant and the surrounding area is very convenient for eating and shopping. In addition to driving when you want to go to distant scenic spots, there is a scheduled pick-up and drop-off in the ancient city every day. Contact us directly. Just be a housekeeper
Service: Gentle greetings when entering and leaving the house. When the housekeeper sees the children running around in July, she will also tell the children to run slower and stop falling. It feels like the little sister next door. When I saw that there were children when I checked in, I immediately gave a set of children's toiletries + children's shampoo and shower gel + children's slippers. It was so considerate and it felt great to be taken seriously. The child is only 3 years old, and I asked the housekeeper for a small stool for the child to step on in July.
Hygiene: Must praise, very clean. Just imagine the clean reflective look~ hahaha.
Breakfast: The restaurant is not big, but the variety is enough and the food is exquisite. The waiters in charge of the dining area were very enthusiastic and eager to come buy my things, hahaha~ They also took the initiative to help me with breakfast if I needed any help. They even helped me make coffee for my check-in experience.
I stayed for 3 nights and didn’t take any photos because it looked similar to the official photos. Although it’s not a new hotel, the facilities are well maintained. The bathroom countertops and floor stones are not cheap. They are durable and high-end. The key price is very reasonable.

msg:Unexpectedly, the hotel I most wanted to recommend during this trip to Dali was actually this hotel. After searching for a long time on Ctrip, I was attracted by the title of a family hotel and booked it for two nights. When I was still in Simao, the hotel housekeeper took the initiative to add me on WeChat to express my love. Mihe July ❤️The hotel is located near Dali University and 100 meters away from the Internet celebrity highway. The housekeeper will ask in advance if you need free pick-up and drop-off. You can also get a free round trip to the ancient city once a day. The bus just stopped at the roadside and the staff rushed over to help carry your luggage. There are facilities in the hotel. Free afternoon tea can be enjoyed in the succulent garden or can be delivered to the room by the butler. There are two cute and soft rabbits in the garden. There is also a children's playground, gym and billiards room. Drinks and separate toiletries for children are placed in the room yesterday. I booked a parent-child comfort room, which I think is the most cost-effective option. However, because my mother and I have different schedules and interfere with each other, I changed to a tatami parent-child room today. The room is too big. I live in a tatami room with Lao Qi, and my parents live next door, completely independent from each other. You can have a good sleep without disturbing the night. The breakfast tastes good. The key is that every staff member in the hotel is very warm. I read the reviews before and said that the Haidilao style service is really worthy of the name. I will still choose it next time I come to Dali! Recommend to friends [love]

msg:This hotel was the perfect ending to our trip to Dali. It was really the most comfortable hotel we stayed in in Dali.
1. First of all, what I want to praise the most is the service of this hotel. As soon as we parked the car, many young brothers and sisters rushed out to help me carry my luggage. The one who rushed at the front was the smallest girl, hahahaha , and the follow-up service was also meticulous. Even the little brother who helped us with our luggage after leaving the store would also thoughtfully remind us to pay more attention to the weather and drink more water.
2. Secondly, the environment and facilities of this hotel are also very considerate. There is a small garden with an environment comparable to a park. The little rabbits in the garden are also super cute, but every time I go to find the little rabbit, I have to trouble the hotel guy. There are rabbits in the garden, as well as a billiards room and a gym. The sharp corners in the room are also well protected.
3. In addition to breakfast in the morning, the hotel also provides simple meals for lunch and dinner. The butler introduced a small set meal, but the set meal also includes fruit desserts. The delicious taste and super discounted price are really cost-effective. , I even finished my meal without going to the two food streets around the hotel.
4 The hotel also has a free laundry room, which is located in the garden. I just asked the housekeeper if there was a place to wash clothes, and the housekeeper took me there. There are washing machines and dryers, which are self-assembled. I was a little worried and checked it out, it was quite clean.
5. The location of the hotel is okay. It is close to and far from the scenic spots. The most convenient one is close to Cangshan Mountain. You can take pictures of beautiful mountain views from the third floor of other buildings. This saves us from hiking, hahahaha~

The hotel's breakfast is also delicious and the mushroom soup noodles are particularly recommended. I only place an order in July. Contact us 24 hours a day online. Very baby-friendly. I was given a small toy as a gift. If I come back next time, I will definitely choose this hotel.

msg:Yesterday's rain and snow were replaced by today's clear sky. The snow on Cangshan Mountain reflects the blue of the sky. The sun shines on Cangshan Mountain, and the white snow on Cangshan Mountain turns golden.
        Although I came to Dali in the cold winter, it was still very dry and my throat and nose felt itchy, but seeing this scenery was worth it!
        The hotel is just at the foot of Cangshan Mountain. You can see Cangshan Mountain from the door. The Internet Celebrity Highway is about 80 meters to the right of the hotel. It is a good place to take photos and check in to view the Erhai Lake from a distance.
       The road on the left hand side of the hotel is also very beautiful for a walk during the day. There are few residents and it is full of trees. It feels good to run. But the scenery here may be better for watching the sunrise over Erhai Lake. There are fewer obstructions and fewer cars.
        When we checked into the hotel, the housekeepers came to help us with our luggage. The warm service made us feel very warm in the cold season. 🈶Hot ginger tea and 24-hour self-service coffee☕️. The hotel yard was full of plants. There are succulents and little rabbits. There is also a children's paradise on the first floor with table tennis and billiards, which is great.
        The butler (Muya) is very attentive and warm. He sent me the travel guide early. [Strong] The rice noodles for breakfast are highly recommended. They taste delicious. The hotel also has national costumes that you can borrow for free. I feel like I can spend a whole day in the hotel. . Highly recommended for guests who like beautiful scenery!

msg:Overall very good
Before check-in, I added WeChat with the housekeeper. On the first day of my stay at the hotel, I warmly arranged a pick-up. The little housekeeper "July" of the hotel was very enthusiastic to help with the check-in. The overall environment of the hotel is very nice. There are many succulents planted. The rooms are clean, bright and bright, and the supplies are complete and comfortable. It was still there in the afternoon. We arranged coffee, fruit coffee and the quality was very good online. We also arranged milk before going to bed in the evening.
Early the next morning, "July" thoughtfully sent us weather forecasts and travel precautions. We chartered a hotel car to travel around the sea for a day. The driver explained enthusiastically and thoughtfully all the way. The overall feeling of the hotel should not be too good. It is definitely the best choice near the ancient city👍

You fell in love with it as soon as you came. The hotel you stayed in is also very beautiful, with beautiful environment and scenery. Pleasant, you can see the small garden as soon as you enter the lobby. I like it very much. They say that Dali has special humanities. Sure enough, the attitude of the service staff is very satisfactory. Jack's service made me feel at home. He patiently answered questions. The hotel facilities are well-equipped and the price-performance ratio is super high. It’s particularly worth it. The public area cleaned by the hotel aunt is also very clean. It makes you feel comfortable when you look at it. The hotel room is also very clean and tidy! Breakfast is a buffet and is particularly rich. The mushroom soup noodles are excellent. Looking forward to seeing you next time!

msg:It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most satisfying hotel in Yunnan so far. How can I put it? I feel that the magnetic field is particularly suitable. Next, I will praise them:
As soon as I placed the order, I was contacted by the butler. After adding WeChat, he will send you detailed information about things you need to pay attention to when traveling to Dali and introduction to attractions. I haven't arrived yet, but I feel the thoughtfulness and attentiveness of the hotel butler.
Good impression 2. When I arrived at the hotel entrance, there was a waiter rushing out to pick up my luggage. It was no exaggeration. I felt that every staff member was full of passion. I checked in at the front desk and had a cup of warm ginger tea, which warmed my heart and stomach.
Good impression 3. The layout of the hotel is very warm. The garden is full of succulents. It can be seen that the hotel is built with care. Every succulent is full of vitality. There are also 2 very cute little rabbits in the garden. It is really healing.
Good impression 4. The room is clean and tidy. I am a person who has very high requirements for hygiene, but there is nothing wrong with their home. The light freshness when entering makes people very comfortable.
Good impression 5. My little housekeeper is available online 24 hours a day in July. Through the screen, I can feel that she is a very warm little girl. She is indeed a very powerful little girl. She will care about us at any time and always remind us to wear more clothes. It’s great to have food delivered to your room even if you don’t want to get up in the morning!
If I come to Dali again next time, this hotel will still be my must-choice. Personally, you can rest assured~

The hotel is located at the foot of Cangshan Mountain in Dali. Although it is not inside the ancient city, it has convenient transportation and is convenient for travel. Next to the hotel is the Internet celebrity highway. It's really beautiful to be able to see the Erhai Lake from one road. The service staff of the hotel are full of enthusiasm. The butler will call in advance and introduce Dali's travel guide and the hotel's equipment and facilities in advance. After checking in, the butler will warmly go out to greet us and take us to the room to rest. Thank you. The attentive service of the butler (Xiaoyu) gives the little butler a five-star rating for his warm and thoughtful service!

msg:Because I have high requirements for hygiene, I basically book a hotel when I go out for fun. I was a little hesitant after reading the reviews before booking. I was very satisfied when I arrived. The hotel lobby, garden and room decoration are unique. The sanitary napkins are beautiful and clean. In addition to normal hotel supplies, they also prepared Disposable bathtub covers, toilet seat covers, facial towels, toothbrush cups, it can be said that we understand the pain points of today's tourists very well. You can see the sunrise over Erhai Lake from the room, Cangshan Mountain from the corridor, and the beautiful yard. The breakfast is rich in variety. If you choose a seat by the window, you can eat and watch the rabbits at the same time. Therefore, we only booked one night to try it out at first, and then extended our stay for two nights.
The location of the hotel is also convenient, next to the Internet celebrity highway, and it is also convenient to take a taxi from the ancient city of Dali, and the hotel also provides pick-up and drop-off services from the ancient city!
Besides, the hotel service is also amazing. As soon as I made the reservation, the hotel staff called me to confirm. I added the hotel butler on WeChat and communicated in advance about the check-in time and pick-up issues. When I arrived at the hotel to check in, several staff members warmly greeted me and provided hot towels and ginger tea. It can be said that We feel at home~ I would also like to express my special thanks to the housekeepers Qiyue and Xiaoyu, who helped us with our luggage, proactively provided breakfast reminders, good night milk and other heart-warming services throughout the process. They actively helped us solve our problems and were very serious and responsible! In short, this hotel has both the humanistic and caring services of a B&B and the sanitary facilities standards of a hotel. Personally, I feel that overall it is even better than a five-star hotel such as the Mandarin Oriental. I am very satisfied!

Breakfast: The breakfast is great. You don’t have to worry about eating with your baby.
It is very considerate to have a special car to pick you up at the airport or station, especially since I have a baby and it is very inconvenient to carry luggage. The hotel driver, Master Gao, also specially helped us carry the stroller, and the service was very good. The people in Dali are very nice. I will come back next time.

In November, I placed an order with Ctrip, and the hotel steward immediately contacted us. Over the next month or so, I consulted the steward with questions about Dali, and they all responded promptly and patiently. Finally, December 24th arrived. We made an appoin**ent with the housekeeper for the airport pick-up service in advance. As soon as we got off the plane, we took the car arranged by the hotel and arrived at the hotel directly!

As soon as we entered the hotel, check-in was very fast. The considerate staff immediately served brown sugar ginger tea, and the luggage was delivered to the door of the room by the staff! The design of the hotel is so elegant, retaining the architectural features of the Bai people, with green tiles and white walls, a succulent garden in the middle, a small bridge and flowing water, and two cute little rabbits, Fatty and Bailiu. My daughter said she wanted to feed the rabbits. , the young lady went to the kitchen to get vegetables for the baby, she was really happy!

Opening the room door, the room is large, fully equipped, the bed is clean, disposable towels, disposable toilet covers are prepared, there are no hidden costs, the staff said that all items in the room are provided free of charge. It happened to be my husband's birthday, so the room was decorated for the birthday and small gifts were given. It is worth mentioning that the breakfast is also delicious!

The hotel provides free pick-up and drop-off services to the ancient city. If you want to go elsewhere, you can hire their driver and vehicle at your own expense. The price is very reasonable and the driver is very reliable. We went to Cangshan, Xizhou, and Zhoucheng the next day. The driver Wang Changming not only introduced us a lot of humanistic knowledge, but also took us to eat authentic food. His driving skills were also very smooth. In short, he received a five-star rating!

Thank you Luchun for letting us have more beautiful memories of Dali, and we look forward to our next meeting.

msg:This hotel is really a big surprise when I come to Dali this time
The environment is unique, full of succulent plants, and there are two little rabbits jumping around. The hotel staff are very considerate and friendly. They will ask you if you slept well in the morning and give you hot tea. The room is very clean and the daily necessities are OK. The most important thing is the bed, which is dry, smellless and very comfortable.
The most important thing is that the hotel provides free airport pick-up and drop-off as well as chartered car services to Dali Ancient Town. Although you have to pay for further scenic spots, the price is definitely reasonable.
Master Wang Changming, whom we have been making appoin**ents with for the past few days, is very enthusiastic! During the drive, he kept introducing us to Dali's scenery, culture, and history. He was simply an all-around driver. They also constantly remind us to pay attention to which pitfalls we should not step on!
This hotel is really great!

It was very convenient to get off the car and see the hotel lobby without having to walk much. The hotel has a unique style, with small bridges and flowing water, and green plants. It may be because it is the Year of the Rabbit. The hotel also has several cute little rabbits, which add a lot of life to the yard and are very popular with children. The hotel's quality control and service are also very attentive, from the comfort of the bed, the selection of toiletries, the air conditioning in the whole house, the one-on-one service of the butler, the welcome fruit, good night milk and other details are all in place. I would like to praise the service of the little butler Xiaoyu. Next time I come to Dali, I will definitely choose Luchun Hotel!

Special thanks to the little housekeeper Amy, after checking in She received a warm reception and felt like she had magic and could solve any problem.
It is recommended to stay at his house when visiting Dali! The environment is good, the service is good, and I slept very well! I like their service so much.

Due to problems at Dali Airport, their flight was diverted to Chongqing that day and then canceled. The hotel extended our flight for free that night without any hesitation. Then the hotel arranged a pick-up the next day. I really have to say that the hotel's service is really great. Without describing it in detail, it just feels like a butler at a high-end resort in Madai. Whether it is guiding you to check in, introducing facilities, afternoon tea, good night hot milk, ordering meals at the hotel, leaving souvenirs, or picking up and dropping off in the ancient city. All very thoughtful!
6 stars recommended to friends who want to stay in the ancient city!

Excellent value for money and excellent service! After staying for two days, I extended my stay for another day (because I originally planned to stay in Shuanglang for one day, but I was afraid of stepping on the trap there. PS: I suggest the boss to open a branch in Shuanglang. With such hygiene and service, it will definitely become a hit. !) I will introduce friends to stay there, and I will definitely choose it again next time I go there.

Facilities: complete and reasonable

The price was very affordable and it was really suitable for traveling with a baby. Not tired at all and had a lot of fun. The hotel also picks up and drops off guests to the ancient city of Dali every day, and the airport pick-up and drop-off service surpasses 90% of hotels.

Facilities: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Gym, swimming pool, table tennis, free national costume shooting, reading corner
I will definitely choose here again next time I come to Yunnan

msg:I have to say, this is Haidilao among hotels! ! ! first rate service! Impeccable! All I can say is that it really thinks about what you want and provides what you need! Disposable towels, bathtub covers, toilet covers, and disposable cups can be used for drinking water and brushing teeth. The disposable toothbrushes provided are of particularly good quality! And no matter what needs you have after arriving at the store, the little housekeepers Qiyue and Xiaoyuer will do their best to satisfy you! Every service staff I met in the hotel was warm and friendly! The housekeeper will contact you as soon as you book a room and provide all kinds of information thoughtfully. The breakfast has a complete variety and tastes very good. The child's favorite is the Succulent Garden. We walk in the garden every day. After returning to Dali from Nuodeng, we stayed in Haidong. The child even asked why we didn't go back to the Succulent Garden Hotel. The pick-up from the station and the ancient city pick-up also brought us a lot. convenience. All in all there are no shortcomings. I will definitely recommend this hotel to everyone I know!

msg:In fact, I don’t have the habit of writing reviews, but this hotel must be evaluated, and I want to give some reference to friends who come to Dali to book a hotel. Before coming to Dali, I had been hesitating whether to live on the edge of Erhai Lake or closer to the ancient city. After arriving at the hotel, I was glad to choose this location. The hotel has a beautiful environment. There are a lot of succulents planted in the yard. It is a good distance from the ancient city. The hotel also offers free pick-up and drop-off, which is very convenient. There is a halal food street on the right side of the hotel, which is also an Internet celebrity street. Come and check in and take photos. There are more people. The key point is that the hotel service is very good. During my stay, Jack and the housekeeper Ye Zi were very warm and thoughtful. They took the initiative to ask about my needs and responded quickly after informing me on WeChat. Thank you to them for making me feel like I was home when I checked in. I will choose to stay here next time I come to Dali.

msg:I'm so lucky to stay in this hotel on my first day in Dali! It's not in vain. I chose again and again. The hotel's architectural style and decoration design are very unique. The room is clean and tidy, and the bedding is very comfortable (because this is too important to me). The environment is very beautiful and I like the garden in the hotel. The lush greenery and large pots of succulent plants are very eye-catching. The cabins in the garden also provide ethnic costumes for ladies to take various beautiful photos, which is full of experience. Whether it is day or night, any shot can be compared to a blockbuster. Of beautiful photos, the most noteworthy thing is the hotel’s service! The butler service is very attentive. As soon as we got off the bus, we saw young girls and boys flocking to the store. The luggage in the trunk and the bags in our hands were quickly moved to the lobby. After checking in, we were introduced to the whole process. The hotel's butlers, especially the "Peach" butler, were very considerate when delivering the luggage to the room.
Next time I come to Dali, I will definitely choose Luchun! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

First of all, the hotel has a pick-up service, and the driver’s service couldn’t be better!
Then, when we arrived at the hotel, the staff helped me carry my luggage throughout the entire process. Since I had two children with me, I was very grateful for this! Special thanks to the little housekeepers Kiki and Xiaoyu. If you need anything, you can get it done with just one WeChat. They are efficient and high-quality, and their attitude is so good that people are deeply touched!
Third, the hotel has a wave pool, which is suitable for family travel. It has a gym, a swimming pool, a free washing machine and a place to dry clothes, which is very convenient!
Fourth, the yard is decorated very warmly, and the pots of succulent plants show a lot of care!
Thank you Luchun, the housekeeper and all the staff for leaving us with a wonderful impression of Dali!
The wind, flowers, snow and moon are not as good as you!
Cangshan Mountain and Erhai Lake are more beautiful because of you!

Before check-in, the butlers Amy and Xiaoyu will add WeChat for follow-up contact and the hotel will send hot towels immediately when checking in. Before going to bed with hot tea, I will call and ask if I need hot milk. It gives me a very warm feeling. The location of the hotel is relatively quiet. There is shuttle service to the ancient city. The breakfast is made with more care. The rice noodles are as delicious as those made at home. I will come again next time.

msg:First of all, I have to say that the service of the hotel and the butler is absolutely five-star. It seems that the warmth and thoughtfulness can no longer be described. It can be said that they are responsive to every request and considerate. They welcomed us with hot tea every time we entered the hotel, picked us up from another hotel for free, and took the initiative to move all our large and small bags to the room on the third floor. They also sent someone to carry our luggage downstairs when we checked out. , I hope guests don’t have to do it themselves. Especially when we left, it happened to be raining and cooling down in Dali. An old man had a cold and fever. The hotel even gave us a fur shawl to wrap the old man in to keep warm. In the afternoon, free coffee and fruit plate and afternoon tea can be delivered to the room. In the evening, hot milk is also provided, of course, for free.
There are no consumer items in the hotel room, everything is free.
The garden is very beautifully arranged. It is a small succulent kingdom. It is beautiful to take pictures everywhere. It also provides free national costumes for taking pictures.
There is a professional gym downstairs in the hotel with complete facilities and good news for heavy weights. There is also a children's playground.
It's quite a distance from the ancient city, but free pick-up and drop-off is available, and there are no traffic jams on the road where the hotel is located, so the transportation is quite convenient.
In short, we are very satisfied with our stay experience, and we would like to give a big thumbs up to the service of the hotel and the butler!

Environment: Very pleasant. It’s great to make tea in the small courtyard!
Service: The little housekeepers Qiyue and Xiaoyu did their best and provided us with meticulous service within three days of our stay. All the hotel staff are warm and friendly, making you feel at home.
Breakfast: I ate a lot of rice noodles, which tasted amazing. Remember to add peppercorn oil and vinegar🤣
Dali Ancient City designated pick-up service: The hotel provides a daily pick-up service in the ancient city, which is great! Because it rained during the few days we stayed, the housekeeper and the front desk were worried that we would get wet, so they reminded us and provided umbrellas.
Airport or station pick-up: One-way drop-off service is provided, which is very considerate.
Finally, this may be the most satisfying hotel in our trip to Yunnan. I highly recommend it. Thank you to all the hotel staff for your hard work. We will stay here again in the future.

When I left, as soon as I walked out, the nearby staff saw me and immediately came over to help pick up my luggage and send it to the garage. There is no choice in the room. It is clean and comfortable. Compared with other hotels, there are more furniture but it does not feel complicated. Instead, it looks very comfortable and feels like home. The garden outside is also very beautiful and quiet. If you come early, you can drink tea with your family and chat. It will be very comfortable. Unfortunately, we arrived after 10 o'clock in the evening and left early the next morning. We didn't eat breakfast and had no time. Experience it carefully. If I had to pick one fault, it would be that the TV in the room is too small and old-fashioned, which does not match the overall temperament of the room. It is recommended to change it to at least 65 inches or use a projector, although almost no one watches the TV now, whether in hotels or at home. , but there must be such a thing. I sell TVs. If you need anything, you can contact me.

The roads in Dali Ancient City are congested during holidays. It is very convenient for the hotel to avoid the congestion and go to various scenic spots by hailing a taxi. 50 meters to the right of the hotel is the Internet Celebrity Highway. There are many restaurants opposite Dali University. There is also a halal food street down the road. It is a 10-minute taxi ride from Dali Ancient City. The distance between the car and the hotel is free. There is a free round-trip shuttle service every day. The housekeeper and staff, including the driver, are all very friendly. The room is very big and we can see the Erhai Lake from the room we stayed in. A bed rail was added to the baby's bed, and check-out was delayed.

Although the location advantage is small, the hotel provides free shuttle service to the ancient city once a day, and there are battery cars at the door of the hotel that can be used directly by scanning the QR code. The housekeepers on WeChat are responsive to all requests and the service is excellent. I stayed for two nights and were served by Mu Ya and the housekeepers from the first grade of junior high school. They were both excellent. There is coffee and fruit plate when you check in, good night milk and a bathtub cover are provided at night. After dinner, I sat in the yard and looked at my mobile phone. It was really relaxing. If it rains and I don’t go out, I think it’s perfect to stay in this hotel😍. There were also succulents all over the yard, and we were given succulent and flower cakes as souvenirs when we left. The service was so good, no wonder it’s a hotel on Ctrip’s rankings! It is especially recommended for friends who come to Dali for the first time to stay here.

The little housekeeper called me and added me before I checked in. He was very considerate and informed me of precautions and travel needs. He was considerate and kind🥰
There are a lot of succulents in Dali. Unexpectedly, Luchun Hotel turned out to be a succulent garden. We had a lot of fun taking photos in the garden.
The only regret is that I didn’t book a room with a view of Erhai Lake. I had already checked in for the day. When I woke up in the morning, I wanted to watch the sunrise in the room, but I was too lazy to go out. When I come back next time, I must experience watching the sunrise in the room!

The fleet the hotel cooperates with is also very good. The driver is familiar with the local road conditions and saves time. Chartering a car is convenient and affordable. I rented a car with the elderly and children for 2 days. I saw a lot of beautiful scenery, listened to a lot of stories, and avoided a lot of pitfalls. Especially recommended for those with children!

All the waiters are very enthusiastic, especially my housekeeper (Amy) who made me feel very considerate. She gave me good night milk during my stay. There was a fruit basket and a souvenir after leaving the hotel. I was very happy to stay. The food nearby is also very convenient. The breakfast at the hotel is also delicious! Will come next time

They always pay attention to the needs of the guests during breakfast, and they are definitely not making soy sauce. There was a female employee who had been standing there during breakfast and was responsible for registering room numbers. She forgot a name. It was a two-letter name. She was not tall. I wanted to praise her for always paying attention to the needs of the guests.
The hotel also has good night milk before going to bed at night. I am particularly amazed at the service of the housekeeper. The housekeeper Mu Ya is simply an all-around little warrior. She is the one who checks in at the front desk. She is the one who calls the front desk to solve problems with bathroom hygiene. She is the one who delivers milk in the evening. She is the chef who cooked rice noodles at breakfast. , she was the one who helped carry our luggage when we checked out. After moving our luggage, we found that she immediately turned into a chef and cooked rice noodles for the guests👍

msg:The hotel is a courtyard of the Bai nationality. It consists of a lobby and 4 buildings. The buildings can communicate with each other. The middle seat is a large courtyard. You can sit in the courtyard, drink tea, chat and relax, surrounded by all kinds of succulents. The flowerpots are all in the shape of cute animals, which are very cute. The traditional costumes in the wooden house in the middle are very clean, and you can borrow them for free to take pictures, and my daughter likes this.
The hotel is located near the ancient city of Dali. There is a traffic jam in the ancient city and parking is not easy. You can ask the driver to send you to the ancient city before 9:00 p.m.
The hotel is backed by Cangshan Mountain. Standing at the door of the room, you can see Cangshan Mountain with white cloud shawls. Quiet in the middle of the noise, turn right out of the hotel gate and walk for two minutes to the Internet celebrity Cang'er Avenue connecting Cangshan Mountain and Erhai Lake. You can walk in the morning to watch the sunrise. The sunrise time is around 6:30.
Going forward is Dali University, and there are various snacks opposite the university.
The service of the hotel is very good. After parking the car, there is a call button in the garage. When you press it, the little brothers and sisters will come to help with the luggage. After checking in, push them all the way to the room, settle down and then leave. After a while, welcome fruit and yogurt will be delivered. When I meet any waiter, aunt who cleans the room, or the aunt who sweeps the floor, she always makes way for us by the side of the corridor, and greets us with a smile no matter how busy she is, which has reached or even exceeded the five-star level.
The freshly cooked shredded bait for breakfast is very soft and glutinous, especially delicious. Deng Chuan milk is very delicious. Mothers and children like to eat fried pasta and local pork.
There are hair ropes, sewing kits, sunscreen, powder, elastin and other small daily necessities at the front desk, which are convenient for guests who are short of things when they go out.
There were also a few small twists and turns during the stay. Thanks to the little housekeepers, July and Amy, who helped us solve them in time. When we left, he also gave us a souvenir, warmly saw us off, cared whether we had enough water on the road, and was full of love. Next time we come to Dali, Luchun will be our first choice.

msg:The most impressive thing is that their service is really good. There is a butler who provides 24-hour service on WeChat. He will proactively contact you about the pick-up time before check-in. When you arrive at the hotel, you will be warmly greeted at the door and the staff will carry your luggage throughout the process. Delivered to room. In the evening, the butler will ask the guests if they need hot milk and will deliver the milk to their door. We bought local watermelons and pomegranates ourselves and originally planned to ask the hotel to borrow a fruit knife to cut them, but the hotel took the initiative to cut them for us and bring them to the room. In short, the hotel can satisfy you well with all your reasonable needs.
Talking about the hotel's environment, the entire design is very atmospheric, especially the garden, which is very suitable for sitting in the yard and dazing. We traveled independently and booked a tatami room. The room was large and spacious, suitable for a family of three or four.
The hotel's breakfast is very rich, with a variety of staple dishes, various desserts, and freshly cooked rice noodles, which taste great!
The bad thing is that the room design is a bit strange. The bathroom is open and there is only a low wall between the big bed. In addition, the cleaning under the bed and some blind spots was a bit lacking. I flew a drone in the bedroom, and a lot of dust flew out, which is the kind of hair ball dust that has accumulated for a long time. However, I contacted the front desk and they cleaned it immediately.
Another important thing is that the next intersection of the hotel is the famous Internet celebrity Cang'er Road. Taking pictures from the top down is stunning, so don't miss it.

There are gifts when you leave the store, and various considerate services at the front desk, such as sunscreen and daily necessities rental, all of which reflect the hotel's thoughtful and careful service! The breakfast is great, with a variety of varieties, and the accommodation is very cost-effective. There are also billiard halls, children's playgrounds and equipment, it is a small resort. It is worth recommending and coming again next time.

msg:The hotel is opposite the university. The hotel has a small facade and an underground parking space (the underground parking lot is a bit small, and there is a passage for entering and exiting. It is difficult to turn around when the car is too big). You can see the Erhai Lake from the window of the room, and you can watch the beautiful sunrise without going out in the morning. There is a small courtyard in the hotel, and a lot of meat is planted, which is very cute. When I left the store, I gave a meat. The hotel does not have an elevator, and the service staff are very friendly and help to carry the luggage to the room. There is also hot milk on the first night of your stay.

The overall team is young and easy to communicate with - the handsome and tall man from Tang Dynasty, the beautiful girl with big eyes and gentleness at the front desk, and the northern girl in black clothes who helped me take care of my baby during breakfast~ Basically everyone responded to my requests before leaving. I have been to Dali many times as a souvenir, and this time I had the best impression.
In addition, the baby's birthday is notified in advance and the room is thoughtfully decorated; the drop-off service also solves the problems of traveling with a baby;

It is very close to Cangshan Mountain and Erhai Lake, and it is only a few minutes' walk from the Internet celebrity kilometer. The nearby Dali Ancient City is also very close. The location is generally convenient. There are only two shortcomings that I hope can be improved: first, the breakfast variety is indeed a bit limited, and second, I personally feel that the bathroom and the room are directly connected together without a wall to separate them. It is not very good (it is very cold after taking a shower because The space is large, and secondly, it is actually quite noisy when other people are sleeping). The room hygiene is okay. As a person in the medical industry, I have always used medical disinfectant wipes to wipe the room. At least the wipes are still clean after wiping, so although the hygiene is not necessarily 100% safe, at least there is no dust. . Recommend this one.

msg:Due to work reasons, I travel all over Yunnan.

I used to live in a business chain before, this is the first time I live in a non-standard five-star hotel.

Personality reasons, in fact, do not like the standard five-star.

This store is located at the entrance of Dali University, not in the center of the ancient city, but I like quiet, which is exactly what I like.

Say something worthy of praise:

1. After the order is placed, the housekeeper will contact you in time to give traffic guidance (of course, a business dog like me does not need it)

2. The hotel has Bai style, but it is not too traditional;

Third, complete facilities, gym, swimming pool, children's area, conference room are available. I travel alone, the conference room is not available, and the children's area is not my thing, but the gym and swimming pool meet the needs of people who want to lose weight.

Other details: When we arrived at night, there was ginger syrup at the front desk, as well as Yunnan tea. Dali is a little bit above sea level, so ginger syrup is better for life.

In addition, the small plants on the desktop are very delicate, and the varieties are different, but they are all very beautiful.

The service staff are courteous, but not overly enthusiastic, which I personally think is just right.

The detail control also specifically checked whether the baby chair is clean, and the answer is YES. Personally think that the overall is still worth five stars, I hope the store will continue to maintain.

PS: Dali University is so beautiful. If there is no epidemic, you must go in for a stroll. Spring cherry blossoms in spring, winter cherry blossoms in winter, green and green in summer, hey, envious.

Meals: free breakfast, good night milk (really warmed), welcome fruit

Environment: I really like it. I watched a sunrise in the room where I can see the ginkgo and the Erhai Lake.

Service: Overall great! The waiters at the front desk and breakfast are very friendly! It should be that I got a little cold the first day, but I had a high-reverse headache the next day. The hotel sent oxygen ❤❤❤ thoughtfully. So I stayed for one more day

Shuttle service in the ancient city of Dali: Because it is a bit far from the ancient city, the pick-up service should be just needed, but the fixed-point pick-up location is not easy to find + the pick-up master is very ugly, especially the master on the check-out day made me feel that I owe him money. A bad end to the overall stay.

In short, it is a hotel with a strong sense of happiness that will come back to stay! I highly recommend everyone!

It takes 3 minutes to walk to Hongsheng Road, the famous Internet celebrity road in Dali. It is not far from various attractions. There is a free shuttle to the ancient city every day. Once, the staff and driver at the front desk of the hotel were very good, responsive and enthusiastic. Especially the driver's little brother, Ah Jie, who is very honest and kind, and is very familiar with Dali. He likes to explain and remind us to avoid pits wherever we go. We directly contacted him as our personal guide and took us all the way to Shuanglang.
In addition, the hotel's breakfast, which is a buffet, has many types, and the rice noodles are also better than ordinary ones.
The room is very comfortable, takeaway can be delivered directly to the room. The only downside is that the water heater in the bath will be hot and cold because it is solar, but it does not hinder the whole experience. It is recommended to stay and will stay here next time.

Environment: Very elegant, the courtyard is full of succulents, very beautiful, and it is very beautiful to take pictures during the day and night; the room is also super large.

Facilities: very complete and very good.

Hygiene: very clean and tidy, making people feel very comfortable

Service: It is worth writing a lot about. On the one hand, it provides free airport shuttle and free ancient city shuttle. When I first came to the hotel to check in, I was very active with my luggage and immediately put hot tea and hot towels on the ground. On the first day, I also had good night fruit snacks and hot milk. During the stay, I will be very careful to ask whether the service is thoughtful and what needs to be improved, which is really great; during the tour, I can also consult the hotel steward on WeChat. Special thanks and praise to the little housekeepers Mango and Shuangshuang, as well as the little brother and the driver who helped with the luggage at the front desk (forgot to ask the name)

Breakfast: In particular, the Nassim noodles in the hotel's breakfast are really delicious, comparable to the Internet celebrity shops, the side dishes are very fresh, the whole is very fresh, and it is really comfortable to eat a bowl in the morning. Their soy milk is still made by themselves, and the spaghetti (spaghetti is not available every day) is delicious 😋

Featured items: free ancient city shuttle, free airport/station pick-up service

Very thoughtful. The environment of the hotel is very good. It doesn't have the usual luxury hotels. The lobby is small and powerful, and the decoration is low-key but gives people a warm and comfortable feeling. The courtyard is very beautiful: it has both the characteristics of Bai architecture and the charm of Jiangnan gardens, especially the succulent plants that spread throughout the courtyard are very endearing, so I can feel the care of the hotel management and staff. This kind of courtyard is especially suitable for reading and daze; it is also suitable for drinking tea and chatting.

Of course, the price is also a 4-star standard. The room size, facilities and services can be called five-star before leaving. The package I ordered includes the pick-up station, which is good

msg:The hotel I stayed in this time was the last stop of the journey. The hotel environment is good, and it feels like a garden. It is also very close to the ancient city and will also provide shuttles to the ancient city. The hotel's breakfast is in the form of self-service, and it tastes good. The mango service from the housekeeper is very good, helping me to confirm the check-in date and the number of people in advance, as well as the airport drop-off service on the last day. And Miss Huanhuan's service is also very good and helped us take the box to the door of the hotel. Thank you so much 🙏

The service of Mango and Shuangshuang in the hotel is also very good and very considerate. The pick-up driver, Ajay, was very gentle, enthusiastic, and great. Because I wanted to rent a car to play in Erhai Lake, I asked the hotel to help me find a car. The driver was Mr. Jun. It was great. He gave us a lot of cultural knowledge of Dali along the way. He was very considerate and reliable, very good. Conscience recommends~

msg:it is good: 
1. The hotel is about 15 minutes' drive from the ancient city. The hotel provides free pick-up and drop-off service. It is good to make an appoin**ent online through the butler, and the response is very fast.
2. The hotel provides free laundry and drying service, five pieces per day. But it is recommended to help customers iron.
3. The hotel provides free shuttle service.
4. The internal environment is good, the garden is small and exquisite.
5. The bedding is very comfortable. There are various room types, fully considering the second child family. We stayed in a tatami room this time. The bed was very wide and the tatami was big enough.
6. The rice noodles for breakfast tasted good.
7. The service staff are very polite.
8. The hotel provides good night milk, fruit and two bottles of beverages per day.
Areas that need to be strengthened:
1. Garden hygiene is not done in time. We stayed for three nights in total and the gardens were clean on the first day. The next day, I saw several ten-year-old children stepping on or picking plants in the garden and throwing paper towels into the pond. The whole process did not see the staff watching or blocking. The tissue was still floating in the pond until the morning of the fourth day when he was ready to leave.
2. Children's playground, swimming pool and other facilities are better than nothing, and they are set up on the negative floor. After dinner on the first night, the child said to go, we lived on the first floor, very close to the lobby. After looking for a long time, I didn't see the sign. Later, I saw a staff member and asked him. The staff member was very kind to take us there. After passing through a very hidden staircase, through the parking lot, and then through the women's locker room, I finally reached the children's playground, which is not small but dimly lit. When we arrived, there were originally a few children and their parents, but they left soon after. Then, the whole park was so quiet that my daughter didn't want to play anymore. Then, with no one to lead the way, we groped for a while in the quiet and dark environment on the first floor, and finally got out of the labyrinthine negative floor and returned to the first floor. To be honest, I am a woman. With a girl less than 10 years old, it would be false to say that you are not afraid, but in that case, you can only embolden yourself. It is recommended to make the children's playground in the small garden next to the laundry room, as an open-air glass room.
3. The swimming pool is at room temperature. I went there at the end of July. The water in the swimming pool was cold and I couldn't swim at all. The pool is the decoration. It is recommended to make a few small hot spring pools, even if it is a limited time experience, it is more interesting than this room temperature swimming pool.

In general, if the hotel can do better in terms of entertainment facilities, the staying experience will be better.

msg:In the duplex room we stayed in, the lower floor was the living room and the bathroom, and the upper floor had a large bed and a large tatami. The child was excited to experience sleeping on a tatami for the first time. The disadvantage is that the tatami is just opposite the air outlet of the air conditioner, so the air conditioner cannot be turned on; and this room faces west, so it will be very hot if the air conditioner is not turned on before the sun sets in the afternoon! And this room is facing the street, the traffic is a bit noisy, and it will affect people who sleep lightly.
There are children's play facilities on the ba*****t floor of the hotel - ocean balls and small slides, as well as a gym, which is also thoughtful.
The courtyard of the hotel is elegantly designed, and all kinds of green plants are also very wonderful. Although it is not very big, the scenery at every step is also eye-catching.
Hotel butler service is enthusiastic, WeChat communication is convenient, and you can answer any questions. In the evening, a shuttle to the ancient city was also arranged, which was really convenient.
The breakfast is rich in variety, including staple food, vegetables, and fruits. The rice noodles are delicious. Don't miss it.

The parent-child products are well equipped. There are different large bathtubs in different room types. The breakfast was delicious. We stayed in three types of rooms, and we highly recommend the family suite with sea view, the view is amazing. Cang Xue retested personally that it was a bit noisy facing the road, but the room was also very comfortable. The tatami parent-child room (two rooms) has better privacy. The service of the hotel butlers is very good. Every time I go to the front desk, I see that the service staff will stand up, and the drivers who cooperate with the hotel are also very nice. The location is good, there are many places to eat nearby, and the hotel also has a car to send to the ancient city every day. Will go again next time. The only suggestion is to hope that the hotel can provide food and beverages 24 hours a day, I think the business will be better!

msg:Before booking, I saw that it was ranked 9th on the list of the top ten luxury hotels in Dali. However, when I actually checked in, I felt that it was not a 5-diamond or luxurious hotel. It felt like it was just an ordinary B&B.
shortcoming:
1. After actually arriving at the hotel, I found that the hotel appearance pictures displayed on Ctrip's homepage were renderings rather than actual pictures, and some of the pictures in the official album were also renderings.
2. The mattress in the hotel has a heavy spring feel and is partially dented.
3. There are too few breakfast varieties, and some hot dishes are already cold.
4. There is light leakage from the door of the room.
5. The floors of the hotel corridors are unpaved, there is no elevator, and the walls of the stairwells also have obvious scratches and peeling, giving a strong sense of cheapness.
6. The hot water output is unstable.
advantage:
1. Although the location is still some distance from the ancient city, the hotel can pick up and drop off.
2. The front desk clerk has a very good attitude and is quite enthusiastic.

When making an appoin**ent, you are reminded to pay attention to keeping warm and sunscreen. Arrive at the airport early on the day of pick-up.

The service is impeccable, even if you look critically at it. Both the front desk, the driver and the butler are very patient.
To talk about a few details, the first housekeeper Muya Rourou contacted WeChat on the day of check-in, and any questions will be online at any time in the next few days; the hotel upgrade is almost always trying to meet various needs, knowing that I want to change my vision is indeed the second The day was changed; the driver might not be there once when the hotel picks up the ancient city, and the front desk directly called the express train to avoid waiting too long, etc.
The impression of Dali is very good, at least half of the factors are because I chose this one this time.
Needless to say, the location is very good and quiet. It is also good to walk to the ancient city. There is a small road with a nice view. There is Dali University nearby, and there are many delicious ones. Hundred rice grains are highly recommended, a very delicious Hunan cuisine, only a ten-minute walk away.
The shortcomings must be said that some hardware facilities still have room for improvement. For example, the shower waterproof ***** is missing, it is easy to leak, and the bathtub faucet is easy to sprinkle outside when the water is turned off.
But overall, the flaws are not concealed, and the five-star praise.

I came to Dali for the first time and booked this hotel following the recommendation of Ctrip. After arriving, I found that the hotel environment is very warm and I like the style. The facilities in the room are also ok. The window products are neat and soft, and the sofa is comfortable. Bathroom is advanced. Here are two points: the first is that the curtain fell from the hook after the curtain was drawn to the middle, and then hung it by itself, and fell again when the curtain was drawn the next night. The second point is that the four legs of the desk are uneven, which makes it easy to shake when used.
Starting from the welcome ceremony at the door, I helped take my luggage, wipe my hands and face with a hot towel, and did not pull down the welcome hot tea.
The housekeeper helped lift the luggage to the room and explained that there was no elevator. Also reminded you can call to help take the luggage off when you check out.
If I want to take a bath at night, call the front desk and provided a plastic bathtub cover for a one-time bath.
The breakfast the next day was also very delicious. It's as delicious as a home-cooked meal for a traveler who is away from home.
I wanted to live for one day but I stayed for another day. After booking on the second day, I found that there is a membership benefit on Ctrip that is a free room upgrade. Check the same benefit on the first day. But the front desk did not inform when checking in. I gave up upgrading the room type because I came back late the next day.
Generally speaking, it is a hotel that feels like home when you are away. I will stay in Dali next time and recommend it to friends.

🧹Hygienic: The rooms and the entire hotel are very clean and well-equipped.

🍃Environment: I feel like living in a succulent garden, I love this garden so much. It’s nice to stroll around in the garden while waiting for the car. The children’s facilities on the first floor are good. It is a big wave pool. The children wait for the adults to clean up. I have a place to play with my luggage

🔔Service: Little butler’s service has nothing to say! Since most hotels in Dali do not have elevators, the waiters help with luggage, breakfast is delivered to the room on demand, and there is a free laundry service too!

I checked in late that day and prepared yogurt for the children. Drinks in the room can be enjoyed for free. What's more surprising is that I found that I can wash clothes for free. I have accumulated some clothes in the previous few days. I was worried about how to wash it myself and dry it. This solved a big problem for me.




🧹Sanitation: The sanitary environment is very good. We mistaken the room for the first time when we checked in. The store was very embarrassed and helped us upgrade the tatami room, which provided us with a good new experience for the three days and two nights. Although our room is upstairs in the kitchen, there will be some smell of food in the morning, but the butlers did not avoid the problem and asked the engineering depar**ent to make improvements.

In addition, there is a downhill road near the hotel, parallel to the one that turns right when you go out. There are many small restaurants on the left and right sides, which feels very fashionable. It's a pity that I passed by my home in a car and couldn't get off the experience.

What is very surprising is the huge gym on the ba*****t level of the hotel. Although it is not clean, it may be contracted to the public to open it, but it is absolutely professional and meets my various sports needs. It was unexpectedly good.

The facilities are relatively new and clean. The service is very good. Due to the special needs of the elderly and children, they adjusted the rooms according to their needs after they arrived. The hotel was very proactive in coordinating and meeting our requirements, and the butler was very enthusiastic and prompt to respond to any requests during the process. This time, there was a power outage in the area for one night, and the hotel's handling plan was very sincere. The location is also good for self-driving. It takes less than 15 minutes to go to surrounding attractions. The breakfast is also quite rich.
The only shortcoming is that the bathroom facilities are too minimalist. There are almost no shelves or hooks in the bathroom. It is inconvenient to take a bath and lack of privacy, especially for the elderly and children. (Because the duplex family room was replaced later, the elderly and children live together). In addition, the soundproofing of duplex suites needs to be improved. Even if it is on the top floor, the stairs next to it are still relatively loud.
In general, if there is a chance to go to the ancient city, I should choose this one again.

Muya Rourou, the housekeeper of Luchun Garden, contacted me one day in advance and arranged to pick up our driver and car. The car was clean and hygienic, and the drivers and masters were also very kind. After staying in, I discovered that the hotel garden is small, but the scenery is very characteristic, and succulents are everywhere. The housekeeping service is very good, telling us that we can pick up and drop off free of charge to the ancient city of Dali. We have to take a bath in the evening. We also sent a disposable bathtub cover and bath foam liquid to patiently teach me to adjust the water temperature. The local driver also said that this hotel is almost the best hotel in Haixi, and it seems that the reputation is quite good. If I have to make suggestions for improvement, first of all, there is no elevator on the third floor of the hotel, and the housekeeper can hardly bear the hard work of helping carry the boxes. Then there is the children's amu*****t park and gym on the ba*****t floor. During the epidemic, there were almost no people, and it felt very deserted. It seems that the Ruili epidemic has a great impact on the tourism industry in Yunnan as a whole, and I hope the epidemic will pass sooner.

Gillian took us to a shop patronized by locals. The price was much cheaper than what I saw in the airport later. To avoid spending more money and avoid thundering in many scenic spots. In short, don't go to Dali with a group, you can let Gillian take you around slowly.

There is also a billiard room, table tennis, swimming pool, and gym facilities that are more complete than the gym we spend money on, which is very good. The hotel also has a special car to go to the ancient town, even the driver is very enthusiastic.
Breakfast is also very rich, and I feel good early in the morning. Overall it is a very cost-effective hotel. It's worth going.

In addition, the breakfast is of average quality and the soup used to cook rice noodles/bait shreds is very lukewarm. It doesn’t have the temperature that cooking food should have, the overall price/performance ratio is low, and the experience is not good.

大理這個城市有大大小小太多太多的酒店民宿 想要選擇一家住得舒適的酒店很難 出去玩最頭疼的也是在酒店的選擇上。帶小朋友出去玩可以閉眼選這家！
酒店環境不錯 有一個很有特色的花園，傍晚的時候拍照打卡很出片，有各式各樣的多肉 還有很多的綠植 花園管理的很棒。酒店工作人員服務特別周到，路上遇到會主動打招呼問好 早餐豐富 小朋友很喜歡。
酒店整體乾淨整潔 這次在麓椿的入住體驗很棒，對“小魚”的貼心服務點贊，下次來大理還會訂這家酒店！

預訂後有管家服務，我們的管家是七月/小魚，非常熱情，有什麼問題都能及時解答。酒店工作人員也很貼心，每天早上都會問候我們，關心我們前一晚是否休息好，感覺很親切。

酒店的接送服務也很周到，我們一行五人都是坐GL8接送，司機小哥很友好，沿途給我們講解大理的歷史文化和遊玩線路，特別值得稱讚。

早餐豐富，還有專門的小童餐具和遊樂場，孩子玩得很開心。總的來説，選擇這家酒店一點也沒錯，全家人住得舒服，心情也很愉快。

酒店拍照也很出片哦，還有距離網紅大道轉個彎就到了。

衞生：乾淨明亮是我對這個酒店的第一印象，到房間之後聞到了一股淡淡的清香，很讓人舒服，不覺得有突兀
位置：酒店的位置還是比較方便的，出門就有吃的，毗鄰大理大學和財貿學校，雖然進不去，但是還算熱鬧，100米左右就是網紅公路，有很多人打卡，確實也漂亮，但是去拍照一定要注意安全，車比較多
服務：酒店的閃光之處莫過於服務，真的特別棒，方方面面，小管家七月才下訂單就打電話聯繫，發了小攻略，清清楚楚，24小時在線，隨時回答問題，解決所需，必須要表揚一下我們的包車師傅華仔，簡直是大理百事通，一路上幫忙講解，特別棒，如果到大理，可以找他

小管家  （七月/JACK）服務很好，隨時應答隨時幫忙解決問題。酒店整體服務水平也很好，幫提行李就不説了。因為門口在維修所以有專門的小姐姐幫忙看車牌，很體貼。
中庭的小兔子很吸引小朋友餵養，喝茶的位置也很寬裕很舒服。
早餐選擇不錯～就是晚上廚師下班太早啦。
離大理大學很近，看櫻花首選。
下次還來！

1，最讓人眼前一亮的是酒店的小管家服務，真的事無鉅細。訂房後管家聯繫告知注意事項，入住時管家服務特別熱情，主動介紹酒店設施，會送來禮品，管家慕雅七月初一人超級好。
2，酒店環境很舒服，酒店蜿蜒曲折的小溪貫穿了整個小院，很有意境。在院子裏休息很愜意，大理冬季大風天氣這次感受到了出門都是吹着走 這時候酒店比洱海邊很多網上著名的民宿酒店更放鬆更舒適。
3，酒店設施齊全 泳池 健身房 桌球桌 乒乓球 娛樂設施都有 帶小朋友來的酒店也有自己的小童樂園 很方便。
4，房間乾淨整潔 入住體驗很滿意 酒店品控很好 床很舒適 洗護用品選擇上也很用心。
以後有機會來大理一定會再打卡這家酒店。

很少會為住過的酒店點評 
1，酒店位置不錯 在大理古城區不過沒在古鎮裏 但也算鬧中取靜 門外有一條公路出行特別方便 去古鎮10分鐘內就能到 酒店管家貼心的安排了古城接送 酒店出門就能看到蒼山 大理冬季山頂特別美 旁邊就是網紅公路 適合拍照打卡。
2，酒店服務很贊 入住前小管家會聯繫 會分享最近天氣狀況 會提前告知大理周邊的遊玩攻略 會分享遊玩小地圖 雖然也做了很多攻略 但是管家一提醒真的也會很暖心 到酒店管家馬上出門打招呼 全程幫忙拿行李 會耐心介紹酒店的設施設備 管家24小時待命 為管家七月的暖心服務點贊！
3，酒店的環境很不錯 房間設施齊全 寬敞整潔 房間內有浴缸 出門玩一整天回來還能泡澡真的很舒服 酒店有一個很有特色白族風格的花園院落 特別適合家庭出遊 可以帶孩子在院子裏逗逗小兔子，很愜意。
大理是一個適合躺平的城市 慢節奏的生活方式真的會很難不愛 這次冬季旅行中唯一接受不了的就是大理冬天的風真的太大了[捂臉]出門都是被吹着跑 下次天熱的時候還會再來大理 還是會選擇這家酒店 期待酒店的創新！

酒店服務非常好！才下單就有小管家七月聯繫我 給我發了一些注意事項以及旅遊攻略 温柔周到 突然感覺他們真的太捲了 哈哈哈
酒店旁邊就是清真美食一條街，吃喝玩樂，啥都有。這周未正好降温，酒店也貼心的準備了薑茶 一進大堂 就有服務員噓寒問暖 有家的感覺
我想我以後來大理都會選擇他們家 真的太棒啦 不知道怎麼誇無形的東西 得用心感受！

msg:我在這家酒店度過了一段美好的時光，現在我想分享一下我的體驗。
首先，我被這家酒店的美麗深深吸引。它坐落在蒼山腳下，周圍的自然風光簡直令人心醉。白天，你可以在房間內欣賞到蒼山的壯麗景色；夜晚，月光下的蒼山更顯神祕和靜謐，令人感到無比舒適。
這家酒店內的娛樂設施也是一應俱全。無論你是想安靜地讀書，還是想要運動一下，都有合適的設施滿足你的需求。酒店內的健身房等都是高質量的，足夠讓你在旅途中得到充分的放鬆和享受。
然後是這家酒店的拍照點，真的是太棒了！如果你是攝影愛好者，這裏絕對是你的天堂。
早餐是我特別想提的一點。這裏的早餐豐富多樣，尤其是米線，味道非常好。吃上一碗熱騰騰的米線，一天的好心情就此開始。
最後，我要説的是服務。這裏的服務真的是太貼心了。每一位員工都熱情友好，他們始終以客人為中心，無論你有什麼需求，他們都會盡力滿足。特別是小管家慕雅，柚子和Kiki，從入住到離店的整個過程都貼心地安排，古城接送，睡前熱牛奶等服務細節非常贊。
總的來説，我對這家酒店的體驗非常滿意。如果你正在計劃你的下一次旅行，我強烈推薦你考慮這裏。這裏的美景、設施、美食和服務，都將讓你有一個難忘的旅程。

msg:來雲南打卡的第一個城市——大理 做了很多的攻略 在網上也挑選了不少酒店不少民宿 最終還是選擇麓椿。麓椿是一個能帶來驚喜的地方。
酒店環境沒得説 很漂亮的小院子 房間整潔，服務周到，讓人無比舒心。給我們營造了一種家的感覺，無論大處到小處都是那麼無懈可擊，酒店的服務員每一個都彬彬有禮，路上遇見也會主動問好，小管家艾米熱情周到。
酒店唯一不足之處在於酒店樓層是沒有電梯的 所以上下樓梯都衹能步行 不過暖心的是入住後會管家全程幫忙提行李 辛苦提行李的小哥啦。
房間非常寬敞 乾濕分離合理 有浴缸 管家能送一次性浴缸套 出去玩一天回來能泡澡真的很舒服 衞生間是普通馬桶 配備了一次性馬桶套 要是能更換智能家居就更完美了 床上用品很舒服 房間的大床都是兩米的 晚上睡覺空間很寬裕。
酒店衹提供早餐不過早餐種類還是比較豐富的 在口味方面也是能滿足大多數人 早晨太冷不想下樓用餐 管家也會提前告知能夠送餐到房間 酒店有自己的簡餐而且能夠送餐到房間 中午或是晚上不想出門的 推薦試試酒店的飯也是很不錯的，在服務方面酒店的管家團隊真的有很用心！
入住期間體驗很完美 大理真的是一座適合旅遊度假的城市 麓椿是來大理旅遊很不錯的選擇！

msg:這次計劃來大理 在網上選了好長時間的酒店 做了很多對比 最後選擇了麓椿 體驗感超級棒 成功的種草了 下次來大理首選麓椿 下面我就詳細的來説一説我的體驗

首先下單後酒店管家就從平台上聯繫到我 並添加了微信 然後把管家自己手繪的小地圖和注意事項一系列的發給我 感到很驚喜
微信添加後無論有什麼問題一在微信上聯繫管家 很快就回復我 無論什麼問題管家都耐心詳細解答

還有就是我們剛到酒店門口 酒店服務員就跑出來幫忙拿行李 真的是小跑着出來的 真的被震驚到 酒店的服務員都比較年輕化 辦入住也很迅速 入住辦完後我的管家初一就帶我去房間 並且一路跟我講解酒店設施設備以及早餐時間 還有酒店附近的用餐點 真的很貼心

其次就是酒店的小花園真的很漂亮 小河 多肉 還有小兔子 小朋友可喜歡小兔子了 早餐用完在花園裡麪喝喝咖啡 小朋友去喂喂小兔子 真的很愜意 一點也不用擔心小朋友到處亂跑
然後就是酒店的房間 面積很大 衞生很乾凈 很温馨 衹要需要什麼東西 無論是聯繫前台還是管家 很快就送到房間 晚上睡覺前還給準備了晚安熱牛奶 喝上一杯睡覺很香
酒店的早餐也特別豐富 早餐是自助的 種類很多 小朋友吃的很開心 特別是菌湯米線 能吃兩份 哈哈哈

總的來説麓椿酒店性價比超高 比住過的那些星級酒店的服務好太多了 特別感謝一下小管家初一 有任何需求都及時滿足 希望麓椿酒店越來越好 下次來大理還是會選擇麓椿 成功的對酒店種草了
這就是我基本的入住體驗 強烈推薦大家入住大理麓椿花園酒店的 性價比超高

msg:這次假期帶娃旅行 在網上對比了幾家酒店 選擇了大理麓椿花園酒店 相比較海邊的那些民宿酒店 可以説麓椿酒店完全碾壓它們 海邊的我也訂了去住過就衹是在海邊其他的真不行 麓椿酒店在古城附近 去古城也就十多分鐘 離蒼山也比較近 去海邊打個車十多分鐘就能到 酒店附近還有一條網紅公路拍照很出片 附近還有一條清真的美食街 總之比較的方便 

最突出的還得是酒店的服務 酒店的所有服務員都很棒 在酒店內遇到任何一個服務員都會主動來打招呼 入住前就會有專屬管家聯繫 並添加微信 介紹酒店設施 温馨提示相對應一切事宜 有問必答 有什麼需求在微信上提前溝通好都儘可能的去滿足 入住日期還有歡迎水果下午茶 臨走還給準備小禮物鮮花餅 
不愧是花園酒店 酒店花園真的很美很愜意 在酒店花園裡麪吃着水果喝着咖啡我感覺我能呆一下午 很放鬆 酒店還有小童樂園 帶小朋友出行特別友好 
早餐也十分的豐富 小朋友也很喜歡吃 主食 蔬菜 咖啡 牛奶 麪包 豆漿 甜點 水果等 種類十分的多 大人小孩都很合口味 如果不想下樓用餐還可以聯繫管家送早餐到房間 特別棒
酒店還提供了每天一次的大理古城來回接送 衹要提前跟管家聯繫 就會安排好車子 送去古城的師傅也很好 有什麼問題都耐心解答 並告知帶小朋友適合去逛古城的哪裡 什麼地方容易踩坑也會提醒
最後要謝謝我的小管家初一 儘可能的滿足我們的一切需求 我會跟我的朋友推薦麓椿酒店的 下次來大理也不有再去糾結選酒店了 直接選擇入住麓椿就行了 也提供大家進行參考 麓椿能切實的讓你感受得到賓至如歸 帶小朋友出行或者父母出行還是比較推薦的！

大理麓椿真的好 酒店服務特別妙 管家對客面帶笑 早餐豐富有營養 環境美麗美如畫 下次還來住麓椿

msg:大理之行中看點評預訂的一家酒店 相比於古城裡或洱海邊很多親和的民宿來説麓椿就顯得更加成熟穩重 網絡上的評價果然沒錯 家庭出遊父母長輩一定會很滿意這個酒店。
酒店位置在大理古城附近 從酒店去古城10分鐘左右就能到  酒店附近還有很多人打卡的網紅公路 能同時看到蒼山和洱海真的很漂亮。
酒店的環境還是蠻不錯的 樓下有自己的地下車庫 自駕比較友好 健身房 桌球 乒乓球 小童樂園 泳池 洗衣房等都有 看得出酒店的硬件設施還是很完善的 大堂進去就是一個很漂亮的多肉花園 拍照打卡很出片！
酒店的管家艾米服務特別周到 預訂後就主動聯繫上了 會提前告知一些注意事項 會提前介紹酒店周邊遊玩攻略 到酒店後一下車就看到小哥熱情的出門迎接 入住的這段時間管家也是有求必應 為管家服務點贊👍
早餐地方不大 餐廳就在大堂 但是四面都透風 開始以為早上吃早餐會特別冷 不過工作人員會提前打開取暖器 早上太陽出來後大理立馬就暖和起來了 可以在花園裡愜意的享受大理的慢生活 對了院子裏有幾衹小兔子 小朋友可以投喂 帶小孩子出來玩的真的可以選擇這家酒店。
總之酒店還是蠻舒服的 下次來大理就不考慮其他酒店了 還會選擇麓椿！

msg:服務人員的態度非常好，離開時還送了小禮物。位置和環境也算不錯，早餐也還可以吧。

下面是家裡人吐槽的幾個點:
①訂的是親子房，房間格局不好，廁所正對着床頭無遮擋。想開廁所的燈，找了半天，居然是要繞過櫃子，在入户的牆上打開。
②剛入住，小朋友問床底下靠近床邊怎麼有一衹小童拖鞋，不知道是哪任房客遺留的了，床底下也算不上很乾凈。
③家裡才2人洗澡，淋浴間的水居然都會溢出來外面地面，排水很慢，下水管道不知道多久沒清理了。

總之是瑜不掩瑕，性價比不高。後續再來，同等價位還是考慮連鎖品牌酒店吧。

msg:大理麓椿花園酒店是我在大理住過最舒服的酒店，不接受反駁！！
位置：2個學校的中間，不喧嘩但也不偏僻，算得上一股清流，出門右手邊就是網上比較火的一網紅公路，上看蒼山，下觀洱海，非常漂亮，往下走就是他們的回民街，有很多餐館，還是比較不錯的
環境：花園非常漂亮，有超級多小多肉，看得出來是比較用心的酒店，滿園的綠植充滿生命力如同酒店的工作人員，每一個都是
充滿活力，喜歡有人情味的酒店
衞生：我自己是比較在意酒店的衞生的，但是這個酒店沒得挑，大堂乾淨明亮，隨時可以看到服務員在打掃衞生，進房間就聞到淡淡的香味，心曠神怡，讓人非常舒服，衞生情況確實很好！
服務：蹦跑式服務，確實讓人沒話説，小管家七月從下單開始就貼心服務，到酒店了各種安排讓人眼前一亮，真的非常棒，如果下次有朋友來，我一定會強烈推薦，好的入住體驗真的會讓人流連忘返.

酒店服務特別出眾，剛到酒店就有賓至如歸感，服務人員都非常熱情，準備了茶水，還貼心的準備的熱毛巾，辦理完入住後還耐心的和我們介紹酒店的設施服務，並幫忙把行李送到房間，小管家小魚兒有求必應非常棒！
房間很寬敞，乾淨整潔，晚上小管家還貼心的準備了晚安牛奶，這次酒店的入住體驗非常滿意👍下次有機會還會再來，筆芯！

設施：齊全
衞生：衞生條件比較放心
環境：很幽靜，多肉植物到處都是，陽光，庭院，花園，讓人很放鬆
服務：滿意，必須好評
插曲：在吃早餐的路上碰到了一位服務小姐姐，在很有禮貌的打完招呼後，洋溢着笑容蹦蹦跳跳的飛去。我相信她一定很愛這份工作，包括這裏的工作的其他人，他們的工作狀態感覺都特別好，快樂是會傳遞的，很喜歡這種度假酒店的氛圍。

msg:作為一個經常出差住酒店的旅客，這家的服務真的把我給震撼到了。以香港的水平來說，服務質量可以輕鬆X打半島、瑰麗這些大牌。
下單沒多久，就接到酒店的電話，說給我安排了一個私人管家，讓我加WX。我當時心想：「六百來塊的酒店還配私人管家？」
震撼點一：
加了之後，我讓管家（七月）給我推薦一下晚飯的餐廳，後面推薦按摩的地方和午飯餐廳。簡單而言，全部都超級無敵好！避開了遊客店不說，簡直把我這趟大理之旅提升到另一個檔次。
震撼點二：
到店前，我只是隨便和管家說了一句快到了。他們就三個人在停車場等我⋯⋯在香港房費多加一個零都沒有這服務吧
震撼點三：
check-in過程有茶飲，熱毛巾。睡前有牛奶。房裡有迎賓水果，有yogurts。天氣太乾有加濕器。
震撼點四：
早上管家可以給您送早餐（假如你不想下樓的話）
震撼點五：
離店前他們還會給你準備了小禮物，有鮮花餅和hand cream
總結
房間設施不錯，乾淨，貼近5星級水平。服務就直接爆星7星。我住過很多高端酒店，這裡的服務可以說是範例中的範例。他們讓我感覺回家了。
在這裡，特別感謝管家七月，也感謝團隊貼心的服務。我謹在把這家酒店推薦給各位行者。

酒店的環境特別舒適，花園酒店名副其實，有自己的小花園超級多的綠植 最吸引人的就是院子裏的多肉五彩斑斕的多肉拍照特別好看。

衞生：連住有優惠，所以我們住了三天，每天都有阿姨來打掃衞生
環境：小花園拍照很出片，酒店有民族服飾可以免費提供給客人拍照，還有劉亦菲同款的披肩
服務：最值得説的就是這個酒店的服務，管家每個都精神飽滿，走道里遇見阿姨都會禮貌問候，讓人很是舒服，小管家七月隨時第一時間回覆消息，幫我們解決問題，下次入住還來這裏，希望還是一樣的服務

預訂後管家就會主動加客人微信，提供訊息；入住期間各種禮貌問候，協助解決問題，態度非常好，晚上還送牛奶；酒店的早餐在大堂，服務收拾很快，花園也可用餐，一點也沒有5星級酒店的“早餐憂慮”；臨走時還贈送鮮花餅和多肉植物紀念品。

酒店在蒼山腳下，空氣清新；花園設計很用心；小管家艾米和初一服務很到位。酒店的員工都很有禮貌，服務也很好，能夠感受到他們發自內心的對工作的熱愛。這是一家性價比很高的酒店，推薦！

       酒店離洱海，古城都很近，開車都是幾分鐘就到，酒店內的環境也非常棒，
       首先酒店所有的工作人員都非常非常非常的熱情，定的大床給我升級到了套房，剛進去就感覺環境很好，想要續住兩天，因為是給升級到了套房，問了一下房間價格想着按套房續住，結果房間還是套房，價格按照大床的來，搞得我很不好意思😅😅第二天把車上的紅牛氧氣瓶給了他們讓他們給有需要的客人，這樣也稍微心安一點😂雖然對他們來説可能也沒啥用😂
      早飯餐會很貼心的問有沒有休息好，也會跟你講有特色的米線等等.
      我是不習慣麻煩別人的，就算他們有幫住户拿行李的服務，所以退房的時候我是自己拎行李下去的，結果工作人員看到了那真是小跑過來要幫我拿😂😂
      綜上還有很多很多不一一闡述，總之他們的服務絕對對得起他們的房價！這次很棒下次還來👍

msg:酒店的服務還是很不錯的，店裡都是幫忙拿行李。但是我們在三樓，入住的時候，管家告訴我們晚上儘量不要開空調，房間很乾，我們晚上便沒有開空調，當時還沒覺得有什麼不適的，衹覺得很熱，晚上睡的不舒服，第二天出去吃早餐，才覺得房間超級熱，也很悶。小孩和長者當天都很不舒服，小孩也發燒了。其他方面還是不錯的。建議酒店如果不光因為幹提醒不開空調，而是酒店應該配備加濕器。後面入住的酒店都配備了加濕器。

1，房間空調聲音太大了，酒店整體很安靜，但房間空調太吵了，硬件設施需要提升
2，管家是我提前一天聯繫酒店後才加上的，並不是主動加我的，整體服務無功無過，沒有體會到別人説的特別熱情特別貼心。
3，下午茶我印象中有水果和咖啡，之前一直沒趕上，也沒有來問我。最後一天晚上我問的時候，才告訴我説是咖啡和堅果，我選擇放棄。
4，酒店整體環境還可以，早餐也還可以。
衹是我的直觀感受，可能是春節期間客流高峯，也許淡季的感受會更好一些吧。

酒店環境、設施：酒店有自己的停車場，對於自駕人士很方便；酒店裝修很精緻，小院子種滿花草，還養了幾衹小兔子，野趣十足；早餐廳選擇蠻豐富
房間：房間暖色調裝修，調性很不錯；如果有智能馬桶和地暖就更好啦

首先説他地理位置，在大理大學附近，位置不算特別好，海景房看出去的洱海稍微有點點距離，但另一邊就是蒼山，離網紅馬路也非常近！
裝修風格比較田園風，房間乾淨整潔，該有的都有！他們家最好的是服務！員工都很熱情[愛心]因為這裏沒有電梯，所以行李基本都靠人工！入住前期就會有小管家聯繫你，可以加微信，有任何疑問，都會及時解答！住了三天每天都會打掃，見面會打招呼，早餐雖然品種不多，但添加很及時！下雨還會幫忙出來打掃迎接！
這裏前台這邊有專門司機可以接送你去機場，也可以帶你去遊玩，價格也很OK，總體感覺很不錯！

酒店背靠蒼山  離古城不是很遠  周邊吃的喝的都有 很方便   到達酒店後會有服務員到停車場幫忙拿行李   然後辦理入住   酒店看我們帶着孩子還免費給升級了榻榻米房型   歡迎水果和小吃也很豐富   還有接送來回古城的車   早餐菌湯米線非常不錯  小管家 七月和彭于晏的名字服務認真熱情  離店還送了精美的伴手禮   如果作為親子酒店還是不錯的選擇

1，下車了就有服務員幫忙拿行李，然後辦入住的時候還要有茶水和熱毛巾。
2，入住當天還有小果盤和熱鬧牛奶送到房間，果盤分量不多但都是新鮮的，
3，大半夜被熱醒了不會弄空調，試着給小管家發消息結果立馬就回復了。

其他暫時想不到了，期間遇到的每一個服務員都會熱情的打招呼，衹可惜花園裡正在維修有好多地方都不能拍照，

設施：裝修雖然精心但是建材都是用的廉價貨，所以整體上顯得粗糙，排風扇，中央空調噪音非常大，晚上不關掉的話沒法睡覺！

很多人喜歡酒店到處種滿了多肉，其實大理到處都是多肉，很多商店和酒店都有種，但麓椿的花園明顯是花了心思，中間有一條水道，多肉叢中放置了很多瓷娃娃。
酒店員工都很熱情周到，特別鳴謝艾米，七月，荔枝，桃子（名字跟人一樣可愛），還有其他的，不過我知道名字的只有這幾位。
酒店可安排包車游洱海，謝謝司機小楊帶我們玩了一天，更讓我們對大理有更深入了解。
三晚住宿愉快經歷太多了，印象最深是可以躺在床上看日出。
謝謝離開酒店時送我的禮物，不過如果能在我執拾行李前送我就更佳。

服務：出行前就會有小管家添加vx 入住期間有什麼不清楚的都可以問小管家 入住時會幫忙把行李拎到房間 每天有一次古城來回的叫車服務 提前聯繫小管家會幫你聯繫好師傅 給慕雅和kiki貼心服務五星好評。退房時也會提供貼心的小禮物（鮮花餅和小多肉）

海景房望出去視線不錯，入住期間有幸遇到了海上的雙彩虹🌈

環境：與普遍酒店一進門的香薰味道不同 這裏撲面而來的是糯米茶香 公共區域乾淨敞亮 來的時候住客不太多 臨離店很多一大家子來的早上會很熱鬧 房間寬敞舒適 位置靠邊很靜 在酒店可以呆一整天 開窗開門的穿堂風很舒服 旁邊是蒼洱大道往下走是清真美食街 走過山水間是大理大學的美食街 晚飯很好解決
衞生：打掃細緻 還可以
設施：雖然沒有電梯 但是服務人員都幫忙提箱子到房間 離店也會幫忙拿下去 
服務：從管家到打掃的阿姐 服務態度真心 住的很舒心
大理古城專車接送服務: 酒店合作的車隊也非常靠譜 提前跟管家預訂就好了 省去了打車和租車麻煩 還可以直接包車環海遊 金花師傅一路講解 避開各種大坑
接機或接站二選一: 師傅會提前聯繫到位告知停車地點
早餐: 餌絲和米線都可以選擇 菜碼自選 早餐一定要來一碗 雲南小豆咖啡和碎銀子都是24h供應的可以隨時飲用
最後要點名感謝小管家慕雅和Kiki 辛苦啦 下次帶家人出行還會考慮這裏的

msg:西安--昆明（飛機）兩個多小時，昆明--大理（高鐵）兩個多小時。
路上要花費半天的時間。
這次大理的旅行單獨寫了一片關於住宿的帖子，是因為對這個酒店超級滿意。
從大理火車站出來，是酒店的車過來接站平台上定的，因為沒有確定行程，初步計劃第二天要去洱海雙廊那邊住一晚，所以衹定了一天的房。
住了一晚之後決定這幾天就住這了，但是住了4晚換了3次房（因為房間被定完了，原房間不能續住），每天早上將行李收拾好放在房間我們就出去玩了，晚上回來服務員已經將行李搬到了新的房間。
住宿價格：
第一晚：就是平台上定的七百多一晚（櫻花·海璟大床房，圖3-6）是因為在房間能看到洱海的一角。
第二晚：這個房間原價挺高的，因為是續住，所以小管家給的價格是七百多（蒼雪·豪華園景商務套房，圖6-11）這個房間七百多真的超值。本來後兩天還想續住這個房型，但是被定了。
第三四晚：我們注了第一晚的房型，公公婆婆住的是 櫻花·陽光風情榻榻米房，這個沒有拍照，就是一個兩米的大床，還有一個榻榻米，如果是一家四口可以選擇這個。後兩晚的房費都是680一晚。
酒店的早飯：
每個服務員都比較熱情，沒有任何不耐煩的情況，早飯種類也特別多，可惜沒有拍照，西式的中式的都有，沙拉、咖啡、牛奶、麪包、甜點、炒菜、米飯、包子、糕點.........酒店的米線很好吃，有一個人專門是做米線的，要吃直接去給她説，她會給做好自己過去端就可以了（圖12餐廳的一角）
每天早飯都能吃到撐。
酒店的環境：
整個酒店最高衹有3層，説是要保持白族人的特色，那片區域政府不讓建高層，沒有電梯，行李服務員負責搬運。
房間裏的環境很乾凈，乜有任何異味，每個房間都有浴缸，床單被套都特別乾淨。
負一樓有健身房和小童遊樂場、還有桌球案，不過我們去的時候下面有點冷。
院子的環境還挺好的，有很多的多肉，還有一小擺設坐在院子裏發發呆特批愜意。
酒店的車負責接送區大理古城，提前和小管家約就行，距離網紅公路衹有不到100米，距離大理大學走路也就七八分鐘的距離。
總之這次去大理，對於住宿超級滿意。

Ps：雖然酒店沒有電梯，但樓層不高，行李會有小管家來幫忙拿（臨走時本來沒喊小管家，但有位小姐姐看到了沖過來拎起了我的20kg重的箱子📦，感動又心疼！）

早餐:種類很豐富，住了兩天，有幾個品類會換，都挺好吃的
來雲南旅遊6天，4家酒店，這家住房入住體驗最好，雖然離景區有點距離，但是架不住有每天一次的大理古城接送服務。
酒店中間的花園也非常棒，吃好早飯坐個半小時吹吹風非常舒服
到店之前，還有專屬管家古天樂主動聯繫，需要什麼直接微信聯繫就行有求必應。

首先酒店位置很好，就在“網紅拍照地”蒼洱大道旁邊，風景如畫。
房間很寬敞，設施齊全，還有細心地準備茶具。
花園非常漂亮！很多細節可以看出來設計的用心，如果不想出門玩，就在酒店花園泡一杯咖啡都可以舒服地坐一個下午。
最重要的是服務超好，從進門開始就可以體驗到“海底撈式服務”，每一個工作人員都是面帶笑容，很感謝小管家芒果和渣渣灰，我們後來退房去了雙廊玩，要回大理坐飛機沒地方放行李，管家還幫忙寄存行李。🥰🥰🥰
下次再來大理肯定還會選擇麓椿花園酒店！

msg:酒店離古城不遠，在蒼洱大道盡頭，很多人在道上拍照，酒店很清凈，比我們前一天住的小兩千的洱海邊海景房條件好太多了，還是五星酒店舒服。小管家芒果和其他工作人員都非常友好，自駕有停車場，主動下地庫幫我們拿行李，有入住水果，晚上還有晚安牛奶，晚上懶得出去酒店有套餐飯28到20不等，很便宜。走的時候還給了伴手禮和水，芒果小管家太貼心啦。酒店花園式的，裏面種了好多肉肉，閑來無事可以喝個咖啡曬太陽，比鬧人擠人的景點舒服多了

1️⃣花園非常精緻漂亮，不出門在花園曬曬太陽發發呆都很合適
2️⃣酒店裡很安靜，周圍吃飯超級方便，臨近的蒼洱大道上好多餐廳
3️⃣服務好，工作人員很周到，並且有車接送古城，超級方便，不用擔心打不到車
4️⃣房間寬敞明亮乾淨，我們帶小朋友所以選了榻榻米房，榻榻米很大，小朋友在上面玩也很開心
如果不是非要住古城的話，這個酒店是個不錯的選擇

1. 房間佈局：我們定的是親子房，房間裏的廁所和淋浴房沒有連着，當中還隔着一個洗手枱，設想洗澡前上個廁所十分不方便。淋浴房外面沒有個相對密閉的放衣服的地方。房間內還有個開放浴缸，是當著孩子麪洗澡的意思？
2.洗手枱水龍頭水開不大，水流有點小，旋鈕轉了沒有任何變化
3. 燈光設計問題，淋浴房裡衹有一個射燈，並且這個射燈的開關是和洗手枱同開同關的，而洗手枱距離床邊也就兩三步距離，也就意味着，假設有人在淋浴房洗澡的話，另一個人想先關燈睡覺是不行的
4.空調製冷效果問題，我們開的是製冷26度，來了維修人員告知一般開24度，並教了下怎麼操作中央空調，我們家就是中央空調，我們的問題並不是不會用中央空調。後來調到22度，也不冷。
5.插座設計問題，進門口有個放茶壺燒水的櫃子，櫃子上方有個插座可以用來插燒水壺，但是奇葩的是櫃子的護欄正好完美擋住了這個插座，每次燒水要把櫃子拉出來，手從護欄中空間往上摸到插座來拔插。
5.大堂餐廳的蒼蠅比較多，中午吃飯的是否還需要在旁邊點個蚊酒店離古城蠻近的，有車可以接送古城。服務很不錯，基本要求都能滿足，訂下酒店就加了小管家微信了，小管家對於我們的諮詢和服務請求都是及時響應的，淋浴不好及時來修，晚上還會提供安睡牛奶，出門下雨及時提供了雨傘。可是還是要吐槽幾點影響體驗的地方，主要是硬件設施，達不到五星水平，基本也就是民宿或者經濟型酒店的水平。供大家參考，望酒店能改進：

服務：服務是這個酒店最大的優勢，酒店有接機服務，從接機開始説：下來大理高鐵站，接機師傅小墨（墨亞斌）已經提前打電話聯繫過兩次，然後出站口等我們，是一位帥小夥，熱情的幫我們提行李，一路也給我們介紹了很多關於大理的景點和注意事項，因為他的熱情服務之後的幾天我們都是用他的車，車裡也非常乾淨整潔，給我們的行程安排的很合理，推薦！
再就是酒店的管家服務，這才是名副其實的管家服務，有問必答，有求必應，站在客人的角度做事情，除此之外，酒店的每一位服務人員，前台以及餐廳的服務員都是服務在線，一切以客人為先，酒店的早餐是可以送到房間的，有自己的洗衣房，洗衣機烘乾機，這對於出門在外的人太重要了，各種服務細節就不一一贅述，感受過才知道
非常推薦這家酒店
去大理會二刷

酒店的房間不大，但該有的設施都一應俱全。每天都有工作人員打掃續租的房間，添補用品。
這次特別要感謝小管家慕雅、Jack和葉子，對於我們這次出行的要求響應速度特別快，服務也特別到位，對大理善變的天氣每天都有出行前的提醒。我們的房間住了兩大兩小，還特別幫我們申請了每天兩份的免費早餐，早餐雖然品種沒有特別多，但味道和質量都非常的好，補餐的速度也非常快。
這些的旅行特別的輕鬆愉悦，跟酒店的環境、服務分不開。下次來大理，我還會預訂大理古城麓椿花花園酒店的！👍👍👍

1.接站服務，司機王師傅在我們還沒坐上動車就電話告知出站後該怎麼走，他在哪裡接我們，説得特別詳細，有種還沒到大理就被安全照顧的感覺；到站后王師傅早早就等着了，讓我們沒有一點迷茫。後來因為服務好，我們還把兩位本來要住希爾頓酒店的同事讓王師傅接到了咱們酒店，同事也很滿意。
2.酒店服務：到酒店就有管家幫忙提行李，一杯暖暖的紅糖薑茶簡直沁入我心，太温暖了。早餐米線很好吃，我個人覺得比過橋米線好吃。酒店後院就是後花園，吃完早飯可以到花園曬太陽🌞。
3.大理古城免費接送：衹要是晚上9點前，聯繫管家都可以免費接送，很方便。
4.特別要再次表揚王師傅：車輛收拾得很乾凈，推薦我們吃好吃的白族菜，去崇聖寺三塔佛都。我們邀請王師傅帶我們環洱海遊玩一圈，去了喜洲嚴家侯廬，品了白家三道茶（很好喝），看了白族姑娘表演；周家村段氏扎染很棒，看到了扎染工藝的製作過程，不愧是非物質文化遺產；雙廊碼頭、小普陀、理想邦的景色也不錯，最後也看到了日落。最讓人記憶猶新的是在海西龍龕村騎自行車、看日出，生態廊道很愜意。
總之這次大理出差洱海之旅很滿意，酒店服務也滿意，最滿意的是王師傅，感覺他才是我們這次大理之行的“總管家”，如果還有同事朋友到大理，一定推薦麓椿花園酒店王師傅。
抱歉我沒有拍酒店相片，附上幾張手機裏的照片。🍹
