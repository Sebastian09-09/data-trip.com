msg:I never write a review before, but this hotel’s service is a top-notch! Susie Tang, a friendly Wyndham employee, helped me a lot and made sure I had an enjoyable stay. She kindly upgraded me, not only the sea view room, but also the movie room. They gave me a lot of compliments. The daily cleaner officers were also very friendly. Even though my Chinese is very limited, they all very patiently tried their best to communicate with me. The location of the hotel is 7-minute walk from the nearest beach and only 10-minute drive from the airport (15 RMB only). Thanks to Susie and other staff for their warm hospitality - and the free breakfast bonus. Will definitely stay in this hotel again in the future!

Had a pleasant stay apart from one morning there were no towels so the elevators were wet on the floor & a staff member who laughed at me trying to use Chinese to talk to another staff member. Probably would return if I was booking it late in advance & was using this hotel as a base close to the airport and was leaving the hotel everyday to explore different parts of Sanya.

Breakfast was good and had a variety of Chinese and western dishes available. Also coffee machine and fresh juice. Although the hotel is a little far from the popular areas, it is a short walk to the beach and there are lots of restaurants in the area downstairs. Swimming pool is large and there are free towels provided for sun loungers as well as floats and inflatable rings for children. Everyone who works in this hotel are very kind and will always greet you. Next time I come to Sanya I will definitely stay in this hotel again!

However, the structure of the rooms is not child friendly because the front balconies are so open and the barrier not as high. It was a risk concern for us given that we were in the 12th floor. The air conditioners also need to be checked as they are a bit noisy. Bats have built nests next to the the doors and are noisy at night. We also felt uncomfortable in the elevators that had no ACs. Some of the staff were friendly, others not as much. The guy who helped us to move our luggage when we were checking out was too slow and lackluster. Not looking forward to visiting this hotel again.

In the afternoon, there are marshmallows provided to children in the hotel lobby for free. I also asked for one, which was very sweet. It is full of memories. This hotel has a lot of ideas and does a lot of things. It is especially suitable for traveling with children and couples. The ice cream in the lobby is also very good. There is also a bookstore where you can read for free or borrow books in the room. There are really tens of thousands of books, which you can't read at all. I will come to check in next time I have the chance. The photos are also very beautiful. The hotel swimming pool is also very large. Since there are not many people in the off-season, there are auxiliary surfboards and water guns to play with, but they are charged. There are a lot of people eating downstairs, and my favorite is Hainanese chicken rice.

After arriving at the hotel, the butler came down to pick me up in person to check in, and helped me to the room. The room arrangement was also very good. The butler Tony was very responsible and the service was particularly good. He also helped to deliver fruits and welcome drinks.

You can see Sanya Airport from the upper floor of the hotel. It is not too far from Sanya Bay Beach. If you drive, there are many parking lots on the beach, which is very convenient. On the beach side of Sanya Bay is the famous Ye Meng Promenade, which is particularly beautiful when watching the sunset at night. Our room butler Alex arranged for us to stay on the 12th floor. The room facilities are a bit old, but they are cleaned very cleanly. The room has a small balcony from which you can see the sea view from a distance. The comfort is also quite good. The hotel park is very large, with rich vegetation. There are birds flying on the lawn in the morning. It is a very cost-effective hotel. All facilities and equipment are shared with Wyndham. You can enjoy five-star service at the price of four stars.

I will choose to stay here next time I come to Sanya. I recommend it.

msg:I can't wait to write a five-star review for this hotel. The entire check-in process was very smooth. I am really satisfied with this hotel. The first thing I want to say is that the service is really in place. Every staff member has a smile on their face, which is better than many luxury hotels we have stayed in before. The room is relatively simple and clean. There is no particularly luxurious decoration, but it is very clean, giving people a very refreshing feeling. The facilities and equipment are also very rich. There is its own gym and swimming pool downstairs. There is also a commercial plaza that is very convenient for eating and shopping. The parking lot is also very large. Our butler Alex is very considerate and will come immediately when we need him. He is really very professional. Thanks to his help, our trip to Sanya is so happy.

Mr. Mark not only provided me with meticulous care, but also provided a lot of help. His enthusiasm and patience made me feel at home, as comfortable as returning to my own home.
In addition, the hotel's location is also very advantageous. From here, whether it is business activities or leisure and entertainment, it is very convenient and fast. I believe that such a high-quality hotel will become my first choice for future travel.
Overall, this stay experience made me full of respect and gratitude for this hotel.

There was also a private butler, Miss Liu Haiyun, who prepared to pick me up at the airport in advance considering the flight, and gave me green bean paste to cool off! The hotel swimming pool is of a suitable size, and there is also a children's area. It was just in time for the puff sleeves at 5 pm! The children liked it very much and forgot to take pictures! The sunset is especially beautiful! Looking forward to coming back next time!

We contacted the butler and he immediately helped us to change the room and upgraded us to the Wyndham room type for free. The processing speed was very fast. The new room was in good condition and the room hygiene was also good. Because the weather was hot, the aunt who cleaned the room would give us a few more bottles of mineral water every day. The equipment in the gym downstairs was also very complete, and they were all big foreign brands. The gym also provided towels and mineral water, which were all free. The most important thing was that the children's playground provided custodial services, which really freed up the hands of old mothers. If you are going to come to Sanya, you might as well consider this hotel.

Before we even got on the plane, we received a call from the butler Alex, who carefully inquired about our needs, arranged the room for us, and arranged a pick-up service for us. As soon as we got off the car at the hotel, someone came to help with the luggage, and our butler escorted us all the way to the room. The hotel's infrastructure is very good, in line with the standards of a five-star hotel. The room area is also large, the layout is good, and the business is also good. You can overlook the West Island Cultural Tourism Area. Sitting on the balcony at night, blowing the sea breeze, looking at the lights of the fishermen in the distance is very comfortable.

msg:The service of this hotel is really great. I must write a good review to encourage it. Not long after I booked the hotel, the housekeeper Alex called me and asked about our preferences and requirements in detail. Then he arranged the room for us and arranged a free airport pick-up service for us. After we arrived at the hotel, the housekeeper personally greeted us at the door and took the initiative to help us with our luggage. He guided us all the way to the front desk. The lady at the front desk checked in very quickly. It didn't take long for us to get the room card. The housekeeper carefully introduced the hotel's facilities and equipment to us and sent us to the room. It took less than half an hour from getting off the plane to lying on the bed. This feeling is really great. The breakfast of the hotel is also very good, with a wide variety and fresh ingredients, especially the bowl of Hainan noodles. I still remember the taste. In short, at this price, you can't find a more suitable hotel than theirs. The price-performance ratio is really high. Recommended!

Questions and Answers
. The breakfast is very rich. The price is not too high during the off-season. There are many parent-child activities. The hotel facilities are quite complete. The butler Alan's service is really good. He also specially prepared children's guardrails and strollers for us. The room he arranged is also very good. He also gave us fruit game coins. It is highly recommended. The cost-effectiveness is very high. I feel full of happiness when I stay here. I don't have to worry about anything.

Special mention is that

Alex, the enthusiastic butler, informed us of the hotel's special courtesy services in detail during our stay. Daily greetings, reminders and care. This is the most efficient butler I have ever met. Sanyatong~You can also ask him questions about ticket booking for attractions.

High floors have better views. The hotel is next to Wyndham Hotel and shares the supporting facilities of the entire park.

In addition to the independent children's area, the swimming pool also has a bubble party every afternoon.

There is a bar counter around the swimming pool. In good weather, there will be a barbecue hot pot buffet at night. The oysters are super delicious with dipping sauce. After swimming, go ashore to listen to the resident singing. It feels like eating directly. Great!

Children's playground, the staff inside are very responsible, serious and considerate. There are different free handcraft courses arranged every day. Good reviews!

Breakfast buffet, the restaurant has an open-air part, and dining is also enjoyable.

There are sand digging tools at the concierge. The baby is 4 years old. You can walk to the beach. After dinner, take a walk. This distance can be salty or sweet.

There are supermarkets opened by locals around, and most of them are clearly marked with prices, so you can shop without worry!

The hotel is in Sanya Bay, 15-20 minutes drive from the airport. It is highly recommended to spend the last trip in Sanya for families with children.

It was hard to find another hotel at this price in Sanya. I learned about it from a friend's recommendation. The business district is downstairs. If you don't want to eat in the hotel, go down to the square on the underground first floor. There are many parking spaces and exits. Very humane service attitude, and they took good care of children staying with them, especially Freya Liu Haiyun. Contact in advance to communicate room requirements, and they personally received and sent us to the room when we checked in. Thoughtful and considerate. There is also free airport pick-up and drop-off service, but you must make an appoin**ent in advance, otherwise there may not be a seat. In short, highly recommended! Book in advance, great value for money!

First of all, the housekeeper Susie Tang, a beautiful and kind lady, helped us upgrade the room and arranged for the hotel guy to help deliver the luggage. What's more thoughtful is that she helped us prepare the summer bean soup. After knowing that we were not in the room, she also specially helped to deliver it to the swimming pool. A big ❤️ is needed here. There are also children's supplies, takeaways, delayed check-out, etc., which are all super considerate.
The hotel's facilities are the same as Wyndham. The children's playground is not very big at any time, but Arier Huang and Choie Qiu are both very enthusiastic. They remind the baby to pay attention to heatstroke prevention, patiently solve the problem when the baby's claw doll has problems, and give handmade gifts when leaving. The baby's experience +100
Let's talk about the hotel. The facilities are a bit old, but after all, it's normal after so many years. We live in the sea view family room on the 13th floor, with unobstructed sea view and a great view. The two-bedroom and one-living room room is simply perfect for a three-generation family with elderly and children. Other public facilities, entertainment, catering, activities, etc. are exactly the same as Wyndham. Overall, the stay experience is satisfactory

msg:Dear friends, today I want to share the wonderful time I spent in Sanya. The hotel I stayed in was Ramada by Wyndham Lihe, where I met a very considerate housekeeper, Brother Alan. From check-in to check-out, he did his best to provide me with thoughtful service.

First of all, Brother Alan listened to my needs and requirements very patiently and tried his best to meet my needs. I wanted a higher floor at the time, but he helped me arrange a clean and tidy room, which surprised me very much.

After checking in, I also found that the room facilities were very complete, with TV, wireless network, central air conditioning, laundry service, etc. Every day, the aunt would clean the room, making our living very comfortable.

During the trip, I felt that the staff of Lihe were very enthusiastic. Whenever we had questions and needed help, they were able to give answers and help in time. Master Huang Fei, who picked up the airport, was also very polite and enthusiastic to help with the luggage. Thank him very much. On the last day, the housekeeper Brother Alan also sent afternoon tea, which made us feel the care and consideration of the hotel.

I felt very satisfied and comfortable throughout the trip to Sanya. If I have the opportunity to travel to Sanya again, I will definitely choose Lihe Hotel and recommend it to my friends. Here, I would like to especially thank Alan for the excellent service he provided me. I sincerely wish him good work and all the best!

First of all, I have to mention the concierge of this hotel - Mr. Chocolate (so cute)! He treats his guests as kindly and thoughtfully as he would his own family. As long as you need help or services, they will go all out to meet your needs.

Let’s talk about the hotel’s environment, it’s really great! The entire hotel is surrounded by lush greenery, and there is fresh air and pleasant breeze wherever you go. Whether in the room or in the public area, the decoration is warm and comfortable yet elegant and noble. The facilities and equipment are also very modern and have everything you need.

Hotel hardware - it's not in line with the price. You'll want to curse after looking at it... In fact, it's an apar**ent, with the name of a hotel. The sound insulation is very poor, and the noise from downstairs, airplanes, and car horns can be heard. Attached are 5 photos of the hotel, and I will not comment on the details.

Check-in efficiency - very slow. I arrived at the hotel at 2 o'clock and checked in at 5 o'clock. It couldn't be cleaned. It just couldn't be cleaned. I kept apologizing, apologizing, and apologizing!

The location of the hotel is very good. There is a shopping mall downstairs, and food, shopping, and parking are all very convenient. It's just inconvenient to go back to the room. It's far away from the lobby and breakfast room, which tests your sense of direction.

Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Sanya Lihe Wyndham to stay in the swimming pool. It is very nice. My children can always swim in it as a vacation. There are many choices, there are many snack bars around, and the transportation is convenient. I saw people doing morning exercises in Coconut Dream Corridor every day, and it was very lively at night; the Western and Chinese restaurants had rich varieties of food, authentic taste, and reasonable prices. The hotel was hygienic and comfortable, with a panoramic sea view. The breakfast was very rich. Come to Treasure Hotel in Sanya, just across the road. Coconut Dream Corridor, I have seen the most beautiful night view in Sanya. I can also take pictures from the balcony of the hotel's sea view room. It is really beautiful ~ and the five-star service, the latest equipment, and the price-performance ratio are very high ~

The view on the low floor may be blocked. The seaside is right across the road and the location is good.

Speaking of which, I have to mention that their Housekeeper Jack is as caring as a little cotton-padded jacket! Not only did he greet us very well, he also provided us with a lot of useful information and suggestions to make our stay in Sanya more enjoyable. To be honest, I can’t say enough about the quality of the service staff, it’s really amazing!

Let’s talk about the situation inside the hotel. The swimming pool in the hotel is really nice! The water was crystal clear and the water temperature was comfortable. I soaked there all afternoon and didn’t want to come out. Moreover, the most reassuring thing is the cleanliness of the room, which makes people feel much better after entering.

Finally, I want to tell all my friends that if you have the opportunity to go to Sanya, you must consider this "Sanya Lihe Ramada Hotel"

They introduced the breakfast location, the entertainment facilities in the hotel, and the surrounding tourist attractions. Wait, the big and small caves of Tianya Haijiao Nanshan Temple in West Island are all in the same line. They are close and in the same line. The housekeeper Jessica recommended tourist attractions. For me, it is perfect. I don’t need to think too much. I will contact you next time when I come back.
The children's park in the hotel is also very beautiful. There is a bubble show in the children's swimming pool, and the temperature is constant. Xiaobao soaked in it every day, hahahahahaha, and didn't even want to go ashore.

msg:On the last night after leaving Hainan, I chose the Ramada Hotel, which is close to the airport. The transportation is very convenient. Whether you take a taxi from Sanya Station or get to the airport, you can reach the hotel in less than 20 minutes. We arrived in the evening to check in at the Wyndham lobby. Although I had heard a little bit about Ramada and Wyndham before, I guessed that the two brands belong to the same group, and the hotel has an exclusive butler service. From room upgrades, complimentary travel photos and airport departure arrangements, butler Mark's service arrangements were well organized and very considerate. What’s surprising is the book wall in the hotel lobby. The selection of books is in line with my taste. After a rough look, it covers everything from economics, culture, history, social sciences to children’s reading, and the books range from classics to the latest publications. They are all available, you can register at the front desk and take them to your room. The next morning I went to Sanya to watch the sunrise. It was only a ten-minute walk away. Although passing by in a hurry, it can be seen that the hotel's supporting facilities are relatively comprehensive and complete, covering children's play area, swimming pool, cinema, and gym. Finally, I would like to thank the butler for his meticulous service throughout the entire process, which brought my trip to Sanya to a perfect end. Next time I have the opportunity to go to Sanya, I will choose Wyndham Hotel to experience other services.

The other staff at the hotel were also very welcoming and would always greet us when we met. Even though the housekeeper was working the night shift that night, the first thing he did when he woke up was contact us to ask about our stay experience. It was very nice. Seeing that we had children, they gave us fruits, which was great. The commercial plaza downstairs is also very convenient for eating, so I decided to stay here again. A very cost-effective hotel, I recommend everyone to experience it [Celebrate][Celebrate]

Apart from the different rooms, the other facilities are public. At this price, you can stay in a star hotel. It’s really a profit. The butler Jack’s service is attentive and the concierge Allen provides a lot of convenience for my trip to Sanya. They can provide good suggestions for food, drinks and entertainment. The hotel’s breakfast and buffet dinner are also very good. The hotel is rich and has a lot of dishes. It takes five minutes to walk from the hotel to the Coconut Dream Corridor. The sunset at the Coconut Dream Corridor is really amazing. It is very beautiful. The room has a front view of the sea. The 180-degree view of the sea from the upper floors is very beautiful. You can also watch it from the balcony. When we arrived at West Island, the room was quite big and the kids liked it very much. There was a resident singer singing in the hotel in the evening. It was very comfortable to drink some wine and listen to the music. Ramada is trustworthy and I will stay here again in the future. By the way, the hotel also provides free meals. The airport bus is very convenient and very close to the airport.

Because of the excellent service of my butler Andy, after telling Andy that he would come back to check in, he was still as enthusiastic as ever. Anyway, everything was arranged well. What particularly touched me was that I mentioned my wife's birthday to him last time. Because I was a little pressed for time that day, I didn't have time to prepare a cake. This time when I came back, the birthday cake was already prepared in the room. He was so attentive and warm. The weather in Sanya has been relatively hot these days, and there are not many people visiting the scenic spots. This season is suitable for vacation, especially at the Ramada Lihe Hotel.

msg:It was our first trip to Sanya with my sister. We originally planned to stay at a famous hotel closest to the seaside. This trip was mainly about taking photos📸. We did an online guide to check accommodations, and finally chose a famous hotel ranked among the top three. We directly booked 4 nights in one go. The famous hotel we booked was in a small town. Maybe our check-in time was unlucky. The famous hotel in the opposite building was also being renovated. It was not soundproofed. The door to the room was very close. There were many tourists returning to the famous hotel very late at night. , the voices can be clearly heard, and it feels so cluttered. Maybe it’s because it’s my first time staying in a hotel and I feel uncomfortable.
There was a slight flaw in the cleanliness of the room I checked in. To be honest, it was obviously not in line with the price and I was a little disappointed. I decided to cancel the other 3 nights. Basically, I will not consider booking a famous hotel in the future.
We made a reservation at the Lihe Ramada Plaza Hotel at noon the next day. The hotel has several buildings and the environment is really good. Because I was worried about hygiene problems again, Mr. Daniel was received at the front desk and he was very polite and patient in arranging for us to check in first. The overall environment of the room.
We arrived at the hotel just after 12 o'clock. The room type we originally booked was not available yet. We had just checked out and were waiting for cleaning.
We returned to the hotel after lunch. The weather was a little hot. We just wanted to go back to the room quickly, lie down and blow on the air conditioner. We were a little anxious and asked again about what time the room would be available. Mr. Daniel, the hotel receptionist, saw that our waiting time was a little long, so he specially applied for it. We upgraded the room type and checked in early. This detail is really nothing to say, unlike other hotels that are very commercial.
The hotel is very meticulous. After check-in, fresh fruits and drinks are delivered to the room. They also provide anti-mosquito toilet water and inform you that you can go out to play on the beach to prevent mosquito bites.
During the entire stay, Mr. Daniel will ask in real time whether he is satisfied with the room, whether there are any problems with the equipment in the room, etc., and whether he needs help booking and arranging a shuttle bus. It can be said that if you have any questions, ask him at any time, and he will respond politely, including We needed to travel to other places and didn't know much about the situation. After asking a lot, they were very patient and informed us of the detailed places, and they didn't respond casually.
On the second day after we checked in, my sister was on her period and had stomach discomfort. I asked if the hotel had baby warmers, but I was told that they didn’t. What surprised us the most was that the hotel even made ginger brown sugar water and delivered it to the room😇 , the point is not the instant brown sugar water soaked in water.
The overall service details of the hotel are very considerate, and all the staff I see are very polite. It doesn't mean that they just walk over indifferently or look at the passengers blankly, but they nod and smile when they pass by you☺️ Next time Sanya will still choose to stay at this hotel again❤️❤️❤️
The hotel's price/performance ratio is also very high. The route is also convenient from the airport, and it is also very convenient to travel around. The only thing I feel is that the hotel room type map on Ctrip.com is a little different from the actual hotel room type. I feel that the hotel room type map was not taken. Effective 😂

I mentioned the room problem to Butler Fan on the phone the first day. , I was very satisfied with the arrangement after arriving at the store. While we were at the hotel, he would ask us how our stay was every day. He was very detailed and that was not a deal breaker. When he was leaving on the last day, he asked Butler Fan to come out for a meal, but he didn’t come out. He packed 2 dishes for him, too. Thanks to Butler Fan for taking care of me these days, it’s a very good treasure boy [strong]

There was a drop-off service in the morning, and the butler Coco also gave us 2 breakfasts for us to eat on the road. Also very close to the seaside.
Service: Very friendly to families. There is a children's playground that arranges various activities for children. We participated in a water gun fight + handmade bracelets + marshmallows + pottery making. My little friend didn’t want to leave the hotel. He said he didn’t want to see the beach and just wanted to play in the hotel and in the swimming pool. The butler service in the hotel is very good. The butler Coco contacted us one day in advance and was very satisfied with the room he arranged for us. Coco was also worried that we could not find a place, so he went directly to the parking lot to pick us up. The service was so warm and he took us there. Checked in at the lobby, and then took us back to the room, introducing us to the hotel's equipment along the way. During the chat, he found out about our flight in the morning, and thoughtfully reserved a car for us to go to the airport, and also packed breakfast for us. He was considerate of his guests and had everything done in advance. This is rare, so early in the morning. They sent us a message to remind us to pick up the packed breakfast. Although we only stayed for one night, we were very satisfied and felt full of care. We will come again next time if we have the opportunity.

msg:I’ll say right away that we really liked the Ramada Hotel!!! On our short vacation we decided to stay in three different bays in Sanya. And Ramada was the third and final hotel on our trip. We came to it after Pullman in Yalong Bay and Intercontinental in Xiaodonghai. Perhaps not having as well known a name as the previous two hotels set us up with low expectations. But the reality far exceeded expectations! Interesting design solutions in the interior, a huge lobby, beautiful evening lighting - everything is stylish and modern. We lived on the 13th floor in a family room with two bathrooms and a view of the bay. Everything in the room was spotless: snow-white linen and towels, consumables, bathrobes, slippers, flip-flops. The swallows, whose nests were right under the roof, brought particular joy. The hotel area is very green, beautiful sculptures, gazebos, a pedestrian fountain, a huge mini-club, trampolines, a sandbox with slides, live music by the pool and in the evening in the lobby. We noted the excellent work of the lifeguards at the pools - your children are under reliable protection. There is a bar with drinks by the pool and a variety of equipment and even SUPs can be rented.
I would especially like to mention the breakfasts - we have never seen such a variety of dishes before.
The reception staff are very kind and ready to help in any situation. Susie was very attentive to us and made our stay very comfortable.
We highly recommend this hotel for families with children. But we, adults, also felt comfortable relaxing in it.
The sea is a five minute walk away. A gentle entrance to the sea, very shallow for a long time. The beach is not equipped with sun loungers, they were hidden in the shade of palm trees.
The hotel is located close to the airport and it was very exciting to watch the planes take off from the pool.

Before check-in, we asked if we needed butler service. After check-in, a series of services made us feel very considerate and comfortable. , especially the butler Daniel was very satisfied with the service from beginning to end. Later when I stayed at Ramada Sanya, he helped me carefully explain the hotel facilities, which was very good. The hotel is very close to the seaside, and the room facilities are very good. There are relatively few tourists in Sanya Bay now, so it is convenient to go to scenic spots. The hotel is very new, and the staff at the top and bottom are friendly and responsible. The hotel catering is also rich and reasonably priced. The taste is not bad and you can enjoy it without leaving the hotel. The price/performance ratio is very good and I am pleasantly surprised. I will come back next time!

I added the housekeeper Alan WeChat when I checked in. I thought there would be nothing wrong with this short stay. Intersection, but half an hour after check-in, Alan sent a message to ask about my check-in experience. I casually said that the facilities are a bit old, and I didn't expect the room to have a balcony. Then Alan turned on the phone for me and said that he had locked a two-bedroom suite with a balcony for me, and asked if I had time to check it out. If I was satisfied, he would help us change rooms, and when he learned that we had an early flight, he took the initiative Offered to drop us off. This move made me change my perception of the hotel. After all, I am not a Wyndham diamond member, and the price of the reserved room is not high. In the future, if I bring my family here next time, I will definitely consider this hotel. The staff in the Children’s Paradise are also very gentle, but I’m sorry that I couldn’t remember their names. There is also a little brother at the concierge at the door who took the initiative to help us guide the way. Overall Compared with other five-star hotels in Sanya Bay, the service of the hotel is much better than that of our brother Guoguang Howard Johnson.

msg:The location is very good, very close to the airport. I arrived in Sanya in the middle of the night. I was very tired and wanted to lie on the bed quickly, and then I took a taxi. Before I finished speaking with my family, I arrived at the hotel. It was unexpected happy. The room is very spacious. The housekeeper Coco contacted us in advance. If you have any questions, you can ask her at any time. Coco can reply in time, respond in time, and provide timely service. Great praise! Knowing that we checked in very late, he even gave us a late check-out and gave us special products, which is very good. I will definitely choose this place again next time I come to Sanya.

My housekeeper, Coco, contacted me before I checked in, and added WeChat thoughtfully, and helped me solve any problems as soon as possible. The room is very clean, and the whole check-in process is very fast. I tell my check-in needs, and I can get a response right away. There are children's playgrounds, gyms, and swimming pools. I feel that I have come to the right place. Since we had an early flight, we didn't have breakfast. Since the housekeeper Coco thoughtfully packed breakfast for us, Coco sent a message at 6 o'clock the next morning to remind us to remember to get breakfast. I am so touched. She can predict the needs of guests in advance.

There are many activities in the children’s playground. Children can have a good rest and spend two days in the hotel. From the reception staff in the lobby, to the children’s playground and the lifeguard service in the swimming pool, the service is very good. The staff who deal with the most are the staff of the children's playground. They are patient with the children. After this feeling is good, the feeling of the hotel will be different directly. This is great. The swimming lifeguards in the swimming pool are also very responsible. They are not the stern-faced ones. They chat and laugh with the residents. The children want a water gun to help them find it for a long time. The service is very good. All in all, I feel better this time than I did three years ago.

Butler Fan is very caring. He turned on the air conditioner in advance, and the hotel can feel the cool air as soon as he arrives. I am happy!
What surprised us even more was that yesterday I chatted with Steward Fan on the phone and casually talked about some of my favorite fruits, such as strawberries, mangoes, and oranges. As soon as I entered the door, I saw that the fruits had been placed on the dining table in the room, and there were some Snacks, greatly moved. During our stay for a few days, housekeeper Fan kept asking for his concern, and prepared a few more bottles of water for us in hot weather. Give Steward Fan a thumbs up, the service is very good.

The next day, Steward Fan kept asking me when I would arrive at the store and wanted to pick me up. Our family was embarrassed to bother him to the room before telling him. Because we were just about to go down, housekeeper Fan knew that he would come to our lobby and wait for us right away, which was a warm feeling. Including the following matters, Steward Fan responded enthusiastically when asked. He immediately arranged for other colleagues to solve the matter asked at night, which was very fast. In the communication with Butler Fan, every word was sincere and warm, because we only stayed for one night, it was a pity that we met Butler Fan too late, haha. In the future, if there is a chance, I will choose Lihe, just like Fan Steward said, welcome home.

The day before check-in, I received a call from the housekeeper, Nizi, who asked about our needs in detail. After arriving at the store, she personally took us back to the room, just like my own sister, very kind.
I stayed in this hotel for two days, and it is not convenient to go anywhere with my children. The dinner is all buffet in the hotel. I have to say that the squid made by the chef is really delicious. There are quite a lot of children's activities. My children wake up and go to the children's playground to play. There is also a Xincheng Bookstore which I think is the highlight of this hotel.
The little girl at the front desk who checked me out was also very nice, she seemed to be called Wang Jiqing, I can't remember, she gave gifts to the children, and made my baby happy, so I couldn't bear to leave.

Butler Fan was very enthusiastic and took special care of the elderly, and then helped us with our luggage. To the room, introduce all the way. This time I didn't stay long, and I didn't spend much time in the hotel, but Steward Fan often sent messages to greet him. After I told him that I couldn't open the door that night, the room attendant came after a while and gave us mineral water and kept saying sorry. When we left the store on the last day, housekeeper Fan kept expressing his apologies because he couldn't see us off because of something. In fact, the service was already very good, which made us feel embarrassed. The weather in Sanya is really hot, but the hotel's service makes us very comfortable and not impatient at all.

There is also Fan Butler who has been explaining to me, like a hotel tour guide, this is very good.

The day before I had to leave, I caught a cold. When Steward Fan found out, he immediately arranged to have ginger soup over for the night. I was always moved and told me many things. Thank you Steward Fan [crying]. Because school is about to start, there is not much time, otherwise I will play for a few more days. The ends of the earth, the blue sea and the blue sky, Lihe's human touch is the most soothing place for guests.

There are also two young ladies in the lobby bar and Manager Chen in the restaurant. Their service attitude is also very good. It is really a very cost-effective hotel. We ate the buffet by the swimming pool. It was delicious and really grilled with charcoal fire. The meat that comes out is so fragrant. The afternoon tea and cocktails are very good. I think if you want to live close to the airport, Lihe Wyndham and Ramada are really the best choices. My husband said as soon as he got off the plane that he felt that it was well received by others. The child still misses the little brother who sings, she said it sounds good, he is a great singer. In the end, it's really, really worth it to be here. Very comfortable.

I really feel like coming home when I come to Sanya. I took a peek at the nameplate. It's called Dong Yanhui. Next time, if you choose this hotel, you can find her.

msg:The hotel room is very clean. This time I took my children out and chose this hotel. I feel that I chose the right hotel. First of all, it is really convenient to get there from the airport. It takes only ten minutes to arrive. It is not too much trouble. This hotel has complete parent-child facilities , Free children's activities on the trampoline in the children's swimming pool. Our housekeeper Coco will contact us in advance to ask about some of our needs. I didn't expect these things to be ready when we arrived in the room. It is very considerate. After staying for 5 days, Coco will ask us every day Are we resting well? Is there any need for her help? Special thanks to Coco, the staff are very patient. We stayed in the Children’s Paradise for half a day, and all the staff accompanied the children. My child’s father and I were really liberated. This time This Ramada Plaza Hotel in Sanya Bay feels great, recommend it to family friends

Here, I would like to thank the housekeeper, Xiao Tang, for contacting me the day before check-in. After the itinerary, I knew that I brought 2 children to help us upgrade the family suite, and I thoughtfully packed breakfast for us in the early morning of the next day, so I will still stay in Lihe Ramada next time because of this service.

Because we arrived early, he helped us coordinate the check-in of the room. At noon, our group was unwell and had no appetite to eat. Butler Fan personally delivered porridge to our room, full of love [love]. In the afternoon, my friend had a high fever, and Steward Fan sent antipyretics, a thermometer, and noodle soup full of concern. At home, the care of relatives is nothing more than that, but a stranger can be so caring when he is out of town, which shows that the hotel's training is very good, and it is a hotel full of love. In the evening, Housekeeper Fan asked more about his condition, whether he needed alcohol to physically cool him down. When we checked out in the morning, housekeeper Fan even sent us off. Definitely come back next time, Unforgettable Fan Steward, Unforgettable Lihe.

msg:The flight was delayed and I decided to stay an extra day. I didn't expect that the hotel I booked without any strategy was the best value for money for this trip. The location is very good. There are Starbucks and Burger King downstairs, and the food court is next door. It's a bit far away from the beach. It is a very good choice for nearby attractions or to catch a plane. Living in Ramada can share the swimming pool, children's playground, breakfast room, etc. with Wyndham. Although the room is a bit small and old, it is better because the floor is high, there are no mosquitoes, and it is very clean. Especially the service of the whole hotel is superb. The little girl Susie at the front desk is very enthusiastic. She gave the baby a small gift and offered various guidelines. Before checking out, she gave a long time-delayed check-out depending on the room status. The children's paradise Lin Xia has been doing handicrafts with her baby all the time, she is patient and caring. The elder brother who brought us into the room was also very enthusiastic. He even pointed us to their staff dormitory from the balcony, which is also a sea view room. It seems that the staff of this hotel feel very happy High, so can provide good service from the heart. In the evening, I ate the poolside buffet. It was very cost-effective to buy from a certain group. There was also a little brother who sang on the spot. The singing level was very high and professional, and there was a small lucky draw. Moreover, the food is very fresh, and the service is good. They help to collect the dishes actively throughout the whole process. In particular, a male foreman in the restaurant, facing a table of customers who do not talk about their ideals, is also polite and patient in serving and explaining the whole process. It is simply admirable up.

It was very sunny and I was very touched. After breakfast the next day, Housekeeper Fan was waiting for us in the lobby again. During my stay for a few days, Butler Fan would greet me every day, caring in every possible way. I saw that many online reviews praised Butler Fan, which is absolutely true. He is amiable and an absolute benchmark for service. In addition, cleaning the room is also tidy and hygienic, very responsible. The environment of the hotel is first-class, the birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant. Trustworthy housekeeper Fan, a hotel worth staying in [强][强].

msg:Because of the impromptu trip to Sanya, many hotels were fully booked, so I chose this well-known Ramada in Sanya Bay for the convenience of visiting the attractions. Check in feels very good. First of all, this Ramada and Wyndham are just two different main buildings, and other front desks, restaurants, entertainment facilities, etc. are all shared. I thought the room was not good enough, but the large room of 68 square meters is very spacious, and there is a round table for eating; the balcony is not too convenient for drying clothes, and my mother is very satisfied; even better, the sofa solves the problem of sleeping for a half-sized son, three people The three beds sleep comfortably; two of the three swimming pools are open in the garden, and the children's pool is still heated. It won't be cold to swim at night in this season. There is also a water basketball in the big pool. My son had a great time playing ; There are many activities in the Children's Paradise, and my eldest child has watched movies in it for a long time and refused to come out. I also want to praise the hotel housekeeper, who not only contacted me in advance, but also sent a beautiful cake after learning about my birthday.
There are also a lot of food around the hotel, such as food stalls, western fast food, coconut chicken, and vinegar hot pot, which is very convenient. The only disadvantage of the location is that it takes about ten minutes to walk to the beach, which is a little farther than other seaside hotels.

The hotel is very close to the airport. You can take a taxi for more than ten minutes. Didi costs between 20-30 yuan
Five-star hotel service attitude is particularly good
Surrounding environment: There are complete supporting measures around the hotel. There are supermarkets, pharmacies, cinemas, gyms, restaurants, etc. nearby.
It is also very close to the beach and it takes only a few minutes to walk. Walking along the beach is the Coconut Dream Corridor, where Internet celebrities check in.
Sanya Bay is the best place to watch the sunset, super beautiful and healing
Every time I book a deluxe sea view room, the view is very good
This time, the younger brother Yang Bo at the front desk of the hotel is really excellent in service because he has been here several times. He may regard me as a first-time visitor to Sanya and patiently explain to me the surrounding food, drink and fun as well as the characteristics of the major scenic spots and the pitfalls that need to be avoided. There is really nothing to say about the service of this place
Wyndham is a parent-child vacation-themed hotel. It is very suitable for bringing children to play. There is a heated swimming pool for children, a children's paradise, and some children's activities. The overall experience is very good and it is recommended

msg:We lived in Lingshui for nearly two months. Before returning to Beijing, I wanted to find a hotel near the airport to stay for a few days. It is convenient for us to go to the airport.
So I searched and chose this hotel with the mentality of giving it a try. Decided to stay for five days. When I first arrived near the hotel, I felt like I had finally entered the city... There are Pizza Hut, Burger King, etc. downstairs, which are the food that children love.
When entering the hotel lobby, there are welcome staff to help with luggage. And, also sent us to the door of the room. The lady at the front desk was also very enthusiastic and upgraded me and my child to a sea view room.
Hereby, I would like to mention that. The little brother who guards the children by the pool is very tall. I have been watching the children very seriously. And remind the children not to do dangerous actions and behaviors. Very serious and responsible.
At 6⃣️ in the evening, there is a buffet in the western restaurant. Children like to eat. Take him to two meals. The Chinese restaurant is also good. Good taste. There is even an amu*****t park for children inside the hotel. Although not big. But the kids had a great time.
It is also very convenient to order food while in the hotel. Because I brought my baby here to live. Inconvenient to take. (I ordered Qingpuliang twice.) I asked the little brother at the concierge desk to deliver them at night. (Give a tip) I also troubled him to mail my luggage for me. 🧳The aunts who clean the room are also very polite. Will take the initiative to say hello.
The overall experience of this stay, I give 9 points for the overall evaluation. Next time I come to Sanya, I will stay with my parents and children once. 👍

We waited in the restaurant for more than an hour and went to the front desk to ask. We found that the later check-in was completed and the front desk forgot to notify us. There are not many supporting facilities in the hotel, and the service needs to be improved. The sea view room booked for 1100+ is average in cost performance

The hotel is better than the homestay 😃 The children don't want to leave. If I hadn't booked a boat ticket to Xisha, I would have stayed for a few more days

There is no mini bar, the refrigerator is broken, the bathroom has not been renovated for at least ten or twenty years, and it is moldy and yellow everywhere, which is very disgusting, worse than public toilets! The cabinet is also worn out. The shower is the top shower by default. It is very unfriendly for children to take a bath. You have to pull the thing next to you to switch the shower. Every time you turn off the water, you have to switch it again. Don't dare to take a bath. The whole toilet seat is yellow and makes people want to vomit. If the toilet seat has not been replaced for more than ten years, it can't be so yellow, even not as good as the Express Hotel. When I made the reservation, I used the platform's free upgrade to ensure that I stayed in a luxury sea view, but the front desk of the hotel said that she helped me upgrade my room. There is also a very big problem in the entire Ramada. There are more than a dozen swallow nests on the eaves of the top floor. It is very noisy from four or five to three or four in the morning. The swallows will fly around, chatting all the time, closing doors and windows. Can't stop the sound. Ramada's walkway is made of iron railings and glass, and it is not very high. It doesn't feel like one meter. The high floor looks scary, and it feels easy to fall down. There are great safety hazards. When walking, adults should lead the children to the side of the principle railing. The large swimming pool at Wyndham has been rectifying the water quality for the past two weeks, and it may not be open until next month. There was no reminder when booking and checking in. If it was informed, it might not come to live at all, and then the children's pool opened very A little small, no desire to play in the water, the only hotel that didn't go downstairs to swim, very disappointed. The travel photography of the package must be reserved more than one day in advance. We did not make an appoin**ent, and the attitude of the cooperative travel photography is very poor. This is a problem between Ctrip and travel photography, and finally Ctrip handles it after sales. We couldn't stay for two nights at all. Finally, I canceled the second night. I felt uncomfortable everywhere when I lived here, which greatly affected our overall travel experience. Only the breakfast at Wyndham was ok. . If you have to live, live on the Wyndham side, the Ramada side is completely sloppy. If you give me money, I won't even come here. The hotel management really needs to take care of it, because this time, the Ramada brand made me particularly disappointed, and I should not choose it in the future. This is the first and last stay.

msg:This time I came to Sanya to choose a hotel very correctly. I chose it for a long time online. I read the evaluations. There are good and bad. I have stayed at Ramada in Shanghai before. I finally decided to choose this hotel in Sanya. The service attitude is really good, every day. For fruit delivery, we have a family of three with one fruit per person, living comfortably. The other thing is to upgrade our room from Ramada to Wyndham Hotel. Very happy, we continue to stay

Typhoon Compasses is coming, thanks to the care of the shop, I upgraded to the Wyndham room in the next few days with better room facilities. Next time I will still consider Lihe in Sanya Bay, I will book a Wyndham room, which is more cost-effective.

msg:Staying in this hotel makes people feel very warm, the reason is very simple
There is a very reliable friend, the lobby manager lady Liu Huihui
Alina, when we checked in, we encountered a very unreliable front desk. My son and I were placed on two different floors, and we said strongly. No way, my son is a nursing baby, and he usually sleeps with his grandmother. We also had one of our colleagues. When we were furious, the lobby manager Alina appeared. She calmed our emotions without saying anything, and whispered her colleagues. I properly arranged for us. Later, we wanted to eat seafood. After reading Xiaohongshu and Dianping, they were all adverti*****ts. So we asked the lobby manager casually. She was a local and introduced us to a Hongsha Wharf. Seafood buffet, more than 10 dishes for 100/person, and later recommended us to Didadao, waiting for the recommendation of lightning protection, there really is such a lobby manager, how can this hotel have no business? Besides, the room is clean. There are 4 bottles of water every day. There are fresh fruits every day (that is, three, red dragon fruit, oranges, and apples). But I am very careful. The breakfast in the lobby is also very rich. I am really satisfied. I want to give it to Super five-star praise

This hotel was only found online when I got off the plane, and I found a cheap and good hotel, which was highly recommended by the locals. Good reputation.
I only found out when I went in. Everything was fine, and the door was upgraded. The room was large and clean. The design style was European-style modern and fashionable, and the sleeping was very reliable, very quiet, and the service was in place and responsive.
There are taxis waiting to go out. Really happy
The young lady at the front desk was also nice, but I was disappointed that I did not eat their breakfast, hey...
Check in for one day, I don’t know if there is a gym and other recreational facilities...

It is especially suitable for traveling with children. The hotel has three swimming pools and the water is very clean. I didn't want to go. The hotel breakfast is also very good. I stayed for four days and got up every day to eat breakfast. The hotel staff are very polite and will take the initiative to greet guests wherever they go. Will choose this hotel next time I come to Sanya.

It is very close to Sanya Bay Beach, and you can go for a walk in the evening. The same few minutes walking distance is the Little Dolphin Seafood Restaurant

The facilities in Wyndham next door are more updated, but Ramada’s room facilities are not bad. Two shared swimming pool restaurants, breakfast is abundant enough. Ordered two meals in the room and the taste was not bad.

The first check-out was delayed and the front desk assistance was delayed, and the things that fell in the room were also great to take care of the second check-in and retrieve; the second check-out was at six o'clock in the morning, and the hotel prepared breakfast in advance. Very satisfied with the service in general

If you still live near the airport, this one would be the first choice

我們住了三個晚上，覺得酒店真的很便利，到市區也不是很遠離機場也很近，到西島/天涯海角/南山寺等等景區打車都很方便，就算不到市區 下面有個麗禾廣場也很便利，有很多吃的，評價看着都不錯，嘗試了有名的椰小雞，我媽説好吃，哈哈~酒店的自助餐種類也很多，都挑花眼了。酒店還有泳池，也有很多小朋友的娛樂場所，吧枱小哥哥唱歌賊好聽~總體來説就是環境非常好，非常推薦，住温德姆酒店在旅遊中真的是一個不錯的選擇，給旅行加分不少♥

msg:因為我們是晚航班到三亞的時間已經凌晨了，所以定了離機場不遠的這家酒店。訂完酒店之後，管家Alex很快就跟我取得了聯繫，按照我的要求幫我安排好了最高樓層的房間，這次時間比較緊，主要就在三亞灣轉一轉，第二天去了西島，問了一些關於旅遊的問題，管家也很專業，反饋給管家一些小問題也能很快的得到解決，晚上還特意給我們安排了歡迎水果，出來的匆忙，忘了帶充電器，管家還免費贈送了我一個，十分的人性化

説到房間，那也是絕對沒有讓人失望的地方。我住的是家庭房，空間很大，床鋪柔軟舒適，而且還有實木的桌子和椅子，看起來真的非常有質感哦！房間裏的娛樂設備也是一應俱全，液晶電視、蘋果音響等等，能夠滿足一家人的需求。總之，設施感覺真的是超級先進的那種。
當然啦，除了房間設施，酒店周邊的周邊環境也是非常美麗啦。提供泳池、SPA、健身房等綜合服務，完全可以享受一場不一樣的度假體驗哦。你想想看，早上起來，吃個西式早餐，然後在泳池邊曬曬太陽，真是太愜意不過啦！晚上回到酒店，做個全身SPA，整個身體都會放鬆下來，美美的睡上一覺，簡直就是人生中的極致享受啊。 送的旅拍也很好哦！

msg:親愛的家人，我想跟你們分享一下我在三亞遊玩時入住的酒店——大家都讚不絕口的三亞麗禾温德姆酒店。這個酒店真的是太好了，無論是設施還是服務都可以説是一應俱全了！而這裏的禮賓管家 Chocolate 更是熱心地為我們提供各種幫助和建議，讓我們感到非常温馨和舒適。
首先説説酒店的住宿環境吧。房間裏充滿了優雅的氣息，佈局合理有序。每間房都配有舒適的床鋪、大屏幕電視、高速網絡等等，讓我們在享受美景的同時也能享受到現代化的便利。而且酒店還有許多貼心的小細節，比如準備毛毯、礦泉水等等，讓我們感受到他們的關心與關懷。
其次就是他們的服務了。從門僮到管家，每個工作人員都面帶微笑，非常友好。當我們遇到問題需要幫助時，他們總是會不厭其煩地解答我們的疑惑並提供解決方案。尤其要提到一個人，那就是咱們之前提過的巧克力（Chocolate），她真是一位特別用心的人。每天都會提前瞭解我們的需求，並提供相應的服務。那熱情周到的態度真的讓我們感覺如沐春風。
再説説酒店設施吧。酒店內部設施豐富多樣，健身房、游泳池、酒吧等等一應俱全。而且所有設施都保持得非常乾淨整潔，讓人覺得舒心安全。在這裏，你完全不用擔心沒有娛樂活動可做。
總的來説，這次旅行的體驗非常愉快。我覺得麗禾

msg:這個酒店和麗禾温德姆是一體的，在C座，前台辦入住在温德姆酒店大堂（A座），所以打車直接定位到温德姆（不要定位華美達），自駕開車也是停到温德姆地下停車場。在温德姆前台辦理入住後，服務員會幫忙拿行李並引導至C座華美達酒店房間，如果是先到了華美達，那邊是沒有人接待的，要自己走挺遠找到A座，然後再回來，有點折騰，並且不明所以。給酒店提意見後，經理給免費升級成套房，還是非常nice的。海景房可以看到海景，就是酒店離機場有點近，飛機聲響較大，好在夜裡沒什麼飛機。從酒店走路到海邊有一定距離。晚上的自助餐在温德姆泳池周邊，還是相當不錯的。

msg:這次入住咱們酒店 我可以分兩個角度來説，一個是服務一個是入住體驗感。首先説服務，我覺得不愧是連鎖大品牌的酒店，服務真的非常好，前台服務很好，很熱情，特別是sunny小姐姐，笑容很好，很積極的詢問我們入住需求，房間安排的也很滿意。然後從入住體驗，雖然衹是匆忙的暫住一個晚上，但是卻非常的舒心，當時辦理入住時還有歌手在唱歌，十分熱鬧，房間裏面也很好，睡的很舒服，陽台風景也很好，吹着海風，在陽台坐一會看看風景也別有一番滋味，這次比較匆忙，如果下次有機會再來三亞，我還是會選擇入住咱們麗禾温德姆酒店。

Vinnie給人的第一印象便是認真負責。他總是能夠快捷地做出迴應和解決問題，讓人感覺彷彿是生活上的守護神，處理起事情來遊刃有餘。每當我們遇到任何困擾或難題時，Vinnie總是能及時發現並提供有效的解決方案。他不僅在日常事務中表現出色，還會主動關心客人的需求和喜好，讓每個人都感受到無微不至的關懷。

除此之外，Vinnie還富有熱情且細心體貼。他總是對我們噓寒問暖，主動為我們提供各種幫助，是那種能夠和客人建立深厚友誼的大管家。從我們抵達三亞的那一刻開始，Vinnie便陪同我們忙碌於各個角落，提供獨特而細膩的出行建議與訊息，讓我們充分感受到了“家外之家”的温暖與舒適。

在餐飲方面選擇多樣，口感地道的餐廳是另一特色所在。無論是家常可口的中餐，還是浪漫唯美的西餐，亦或是豐富多樣的本地菜品，都能滿足不同口味人羣的需求。順帶一提，酒吧也是非常熱鬧的地方，氛圍十分輕鬆愉快。

總的來説，麗禾華美達大酒店帶給我們五星級酒店的品質享受，也帶來了難忘的美好回憶之源——他們無私奉獻的大管家Vinnie。相信無論你是商務旅行者還是度假休閑遊客，都會對這一切留下深刻的印象，成為您難忘的三亞之行。感謝Vinnie以及他背後整個團隊的辛勤付出，讓我們度過了一次完美的旅行體驗！

早上起來，拉開窗簾就看到大海就在眼前。最喜歡的是那裡的免費游泳池，早晚都有人在裏面游來游去，不在乎是不是高手，衹要能放鬆心情就好啦。而且這個酒店挨着三亞灣，到其他景點也是超級方便的。
總而言之，我真的要給這家三亞麗禾華美達酒店一個大大的贊。

最後強調一點，這個酒店的服務真的不錯，禮賓管家Oswald提前聯繫我們，詢問了房間要求什麼的真的很驚喜有這種服務，服務員都很用心，有要求都能得到反饋，主打一個住的舒心。

房間內部和網上看到的圖片一樣，都是實拍。衞生乾淨，床品舒適。管家coco也很貼心，每天都會免費給我們房間補充飲料和水果。

酒店留下有泳池，還有很多親子樂園，帶小朋友的遊客可以選擇這家。另外，酒店周邊有一個小商場，可以提供不同口味的餐飲，還有一個電影院。

酒店距離海邊沙灘走路10分鐘，房間裏能看見西島，距離機場車程15分鐘，交通便利。

msg:華美達廣場酒店和温德姆共用一個大堂
👨服務員很熱情，有求必應，會幫忙開車拿行ye🌴酒店外部設施和温德姆共用，有成人泳池和小朋友的恆温泳池（可以租酒店泳圈），室內遊樂園，沙坑，滑滑梯，蹦床，鞦韆，每天都有豐富的康樂親子活動可以參加，很適合帶小朋友入住，小朋友玩的很開心
🏠華美達酒店客房離大堂有些距離，走路需要兩分鐘左右，我們入住的是高級海景家庭套房，但是實際給的是開心超人主題家庭套房。圖片上顯示原先定的房間有陽台，實際入住的超人主題房間沒有陽台。晾曬衣服和看風景會不方便。房間設計很老舊，特別老，要不是外面的配套設施比較不錯，就這樣老舊的房間，這樣的價格估計會沒人定。房間吊扇打開之後會吱呀響，配套的廚房就是個擺設，沒有任何廚具。房間格局不喜歡，一張1.8米大床和一張1.5米床，1.8米床是在客廳，沒有私密性和安靜可言，床對面就是沙發和電視。床和枕頭還是比較柔軟。海景房的海景不是特別好。
🍞早餐挺不錯！吃完早餐飽的可以不吃午餐。有各種麪包，熱菜，海南抱羅粉，各種海南粉，雞蛋，香腸，一些炸的小吃。各種飲料，咖啡，牛奶。高峯期人很多，位置很難找！
🚗除了房間硬件設施實在老舊，差評！入住有歡迎水果，每天補礦泉水，贈送了呀諾達熱帶雨林的門票，其餘的還是不錯的。酒店離機場近，打車十幾二十分鐘。離海比較近。酒店附近的太瓊糟粕醋火鍋好吃！推薦！
如果下次去三亞還會選這家酒店，除了房間老舊是硬傷，其餘的都很滿意

最最最主要的是還有賓客服務經理，高紹森經理全程熱情周到的服務，讓此次開心之旅更加錦上添花。

酒店很有設計感，大堂頂部鏤空，整個光源都是自然光，感覺這個設計很巧妙，既環保又好看。

剛到酒店高經理就第一時間接待了我們並送上了歡迎水果。而且房間配備冰箱，各種飲料都是可以免費暢飲的。早餐也很出彩，每天開心的用完早餐再出發不要太幸福！

另外高經理全程對於三亞之行的線路都給出了合理的規劃與建議，省去了不必要的路途和時間。

總之這次三亞之行亮點數不勝數，但最主要的是來自麗禾温德姆酒店來自高經理周到服務帶來的幸福感。

強烈推薦友友們光臨麗禾温德姆酒店，選擇高經理，體驗高端服務。

msg:大概20年前來過三亞灣，當時跟着爸爸媽媽報旅遊團過來的，幾乎逛變所有景點，後來發現還是泡酒店最舒服，斷斷續續都是住亞龍灣，今年很特殊，爸爸大病初癒，這次需要我帶一家人散心療養，前後查了一個月酒店，説説我的心得。
         響應國家號召，我有三個孩子，住酒店是大難題，兩間浪費，並且孩子太小還不能單獨睡，因此每個酒店除了看早餐的評價，關鍵是得找我睡覺的地方……幾乎每一張房型圖片我都要放大看，有沒有沙發，床能不能拼……相信也是每個多孩家庭的困擾。
          感謝胡勝宇管家，幫我打開了隱藏的摺疊沙發床，還給了鋪蓋和被子，感動，從得知我孩子小需要喝奶粉，每天礦泉水給的超級多，當然了，任何一家五星級酒店礦泉水肯定是不要錢的，但每天不需要我開口就能放到酒店，説明真是用心了，我撿到一張身份證，還送我兩張下午茶，讓我的老爸老媽也能浪漫一把，要知道，長者怕花錢也怕人笑話，如果告他免費的真的開心的像個孩子。
        泳池當然都不錯，這個酒店的設施感覺每天都有工人維護，比亞龍灣某樹林強多了，滑梯銹了爛了沒人管
        本人愛好擼鐵，也是自己一個人獨處的美好時光，這個酒店的健身房意外的好！全部美國星馳器械，啞鈴最大35公斤，一般酒店為了安全25公斤是上線，真是意外的滿足。

其次，房間設施齊全，尤其晾衣架，親子出行換洗衣服特別多，晾衣十分方便。
再次，早餐一級棒。種類眾多，抱羅粉很好吃🤗
第四，小童中心工作人員，尤其是戴眼鏡瘦瘦的阿姨心靈手巧，畫畫，做手工技藝一流，小盆友喜歡得不得了。走的時候沒能和這個老師告別，小盆友深表遺憾。不過，其他老師給小盆友送了很多小禮物，小盆友開心得不得了。
最後，前台和大廳服務人員態度特別好，突遇大雨，大廳服務人員老遠就打着傘出來迎接，很暖心。

msg:怎麼講，如果你想住出五星級的感覺，那註定是失望的；如果你想住出三星級的標準，那是可以滿足要求的。
衞生：房間內有多處衞生死角；室外小童水池內有沙子似的東西，略紮腳；最受不了的，是室內小童區域，孩子家長混在一起，酒店也不要求進入的人員，尤其是大人穿襪套或其它，經過玻璃窗時，幾乎每次都能看到幾個家長懶坐在小童區域的墊子上，翹着腿、裸着腳，況且不説這一幕出現在小童室內活動區，是否雅觀，單從衞生或孩子活動區域室內環境來講，確實太差勁了，所以作為孩子家長，看到這樣的場景，根本就不會讓孩子進去體驗。酒店是發覺不到這是問題，還是酒店本身綜合素質也就是這樣了。

環境：因為是兩個酒店公用大堂、餐飲區域及活動區域，所以人多也是正常的；樓下有商場、超市、餐飲和電影院，有地下停車場，樓後面能看到機場，在房間內會略聽到、在房間外會明顯聽到飛機起降聲音。其實對於環境來講，最大的問題是，整個酒店和商業及其它周邊配套區域，隔離不明顯，酒店本身的完整性不夠。

硬件：心理預期如果是三星標準，你就不會失望，屋內門鎖插銷是缺失的，可能是被強拆掉了，插銷處，門的木頭都少一塊；洗澡噴頭的支架是壞的，都快要掉下來了；小童泳池的滑樓梯，落地高度設計時應該是沒過腦子，太小的孩子直接掉進水裡有嗆水的危險，太大的孩子直接掉進水裡有膝蓋磕到水池底的危險，説奇葩可能不好聽，就叫做欠考慮吧。

服務：七成服務員會主動問好，樓層服務人員每天會收拾房間；可能是假期人多，早點用餐區域人數眾多，早上會限流，但是餐廳服務人員收拾桌子很快，也還算用餐人員流轉順利。
