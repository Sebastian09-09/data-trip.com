Connectivity to Shanghai was good via the Metro system or grab cars.

Most of the staff were helpful, and the housekeeping team was good.

We enjoyed afternoon tea in the gorgeous art deco lobby as well as buffet breakfast in the 9th floor lounge. The service was wonderful and we would not hesitate to return.

The staff was incredibly kind and helped us so much finding places to go. We had forgotten our passport to check in and one of the staff members went with us to the police station and translated for us to get a temporary residence paper. Would highly recommend!

msg:This was my second time staying here. I think it’s that kind of place that ‘if you love it’ then why look elsewhere? 
For me it’s just the convenience of its location, next door to a subway, central etc. The staff are always willing to help without fuss. Of course the front of staff have a requirement to do that (or I presume they do) but it’s the house keeping staff that bring a smile to your day. They brought a little joy to mine. The friendly staff that open the door, in the lobby. It is a very welcoming place. Plus, maybe I’m just a sucker for art deco, but it still has maintained its inherent ‘soul’. All in all it is just a very pleasant experience. Thank you to all that aided me in my stay.

msg:Pros: Absolutely beautiful hotel. Very elegant and stylish. Rooms are large and very comfortable. Some staff members can speak English. Near Subway Line 2 (Exit 14). Excellent breakfast. 
Cons: Hotel refused to return our deposit (paid via Alipay) when we left, citing a "problem with their bank" (no fault of ours), saying they need 24 hours to return the deposit. This seems to be their default policy. After we insisted it was returned the same day, although a few hours after we have already left Shanghai. This experience left a rather bad impression, and I would not return to stay at this hotel. I would suggest that guests check the hotel's current policy regarding the return of deposits, before they make a reservation.

The small wontons 👍. The old building has the old-fashioned taste. The balcony is windy and people are walking around. It's so nice! The surrounding supporting facilities are like the subway, Nanjing Road, KFC, bar, Japanese food, foie gras, delicious, and Cantonese-style snacks make you want to go again!

The room and service are still as good, but the winding staircase in the lobby no longer exists. This was originally a Yangtze building. The interior is very representative. The grand piano has also been removed. Although the whole place is more open, it is a pity. The staircase is very tasteful and echoes the art deco style of the interior. I saw that the English name has been added to the website. It was prefixed with The Langham. I wonder if it was because it was remodeled after the group took over? I have to say I'm a little disappointed.

msg:For the convenience of doing business in Shanghai, I chose Yangtze Hotel. The location is excellent and it feels like old Shanghai. But the room facilities are all newly renovated and of good quality. The lady who turned down the bed also got a disposable bathtub bag (it rained in Shanghai that day, and the temperature dropped by 10 degrees). All in all, the service was also very good. When I go to Shanghai in the future, I will choose Yangtze Hotel again!

msg:A very distinctive hotel, with typical Art Deco architecture and old Shanghai decoration design style. The flower decoration on the balcony is particularly beautiful. Standing on the balcony, you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower in the light and shadow of the four seasons in the sunny afternoon. So on a spring afternoon, under the enthusiastic arrangement of a handsome boy named Evan at the front desk who seemed to have walked out of the flowers, we spent a happy and unforgettable birthday time. Thank you very much for his careful and exquisite gift.

The overall services and facilities are not as good as those of star-rated hotels. The afternoon tea and so-called special drinks are relatively average. The 1,700 yuan spent is just a waste. Maybe it’s a good location for foreigners and friends from other places to stay, but it’s not necessary for locals in Shanghai.

From the foyer, front desk, restaurant service staff to cleaning staff, everyone is smiling and everyone is very satisfied. Suggestion: No matter what method is used in the reception hall, systematically introduce the history of Yangtze Hotel and the people who have visited and lived there. This will be beneficial to expanding the influence of Yangtze Hotel and increasing the occupancy rate. For example, we stayed here for two nights in a row this time because the hotel was built in 1933 and the song "Rose Rose I Love You" was born here.

msg:I have been thinking about it for a long time, and to be honest, the hotel has a long history, is quiet in the bustle, has an excellent location, is newly renovated, and is basically impeccable in terms of hardware. The room I stayed in was on the inside, with a high floor and excellent sound insulation. The hotel's hygiene was also very good, and the bedding was comfortable, so my sleep quality skyrocketed. The main problem is in terms of service. The welcome at the hotel is not the same. I checked in late, but no one took care of me after I entered the hotel door with two suitcases. After checking in, I had to carry them into the room by myself. Compare with the experience of the night before. Toy Story Hotel, the service is terrible. Checking in was also uncomfortable. The waiter emphasized that there was no breakfast and asked me to pay a 500 deposit. This was no problem. The problem is that you have to explain my rights and interests. I didn’t know what the Yangzi special drink was until I left the hotel. Minbar potato The movie is gone, but it is still included in the Ctrip package. Should the hotel correct this discrepancy as soon as possible? Although the things are not valuable, it is a matter of work attitude. When I checked in, I never saw the receptionist standing at the door. Of course, I personally feel that at least the receptionist in a five-star hotel should open the door for guests. This is purely a personal opinion. In addition, I forgot the charging cable at the hotel. I called the hotel and asked the hotel to find it. I still have to praise it. All in all, the hotel is good and sleeping is very comfortable. Unfortunately, it feels like the staff are those from an old state-owned enterprise. To be honest, I will not stay here again, and I will not recommend it to my colleagues. Before I came, my colleagues strongly recommended the Crowne Plaza Nan Xinya next door. I regretted not going there.

msg:🌺The flowers are so overwhelming, travel with the same style, the Yangtze comes to nostalgic🌺——

The Yangtze Hotel, opened in 1933, should be of a small but beautiful type. I feel that the positioning of "Yangtze Boutique Hotel" is very precise and accurate, and it is more worthy of the word "boutique"~
As the third largest hotel in the Far East, it was a social resort where Ruan Lingyu, Zhou Xuan and other celebrities sang and danced. It was also the scene where Yao Li, the original singer of "Rose, Rose, I Love You" and "Congratulations" sang the classics .
The painted glass dome in the lobby transports you to the Peace Hotel in minutes🧐

The advantages of the hotel are too obvious: first, the location is super superior. The real downtown landmark People's Square is within easy reach, and the People's Square subway station is across the road from the hotel, making transportation extremely convenient. Second, the hotel's catering is also remarkable. 1933 Rose Restaurant on the second floor has the most Shanghainese accent, nostalgic style, exquisite elegance. Romantic and warm; the breakfast room on the 9th floor is in Western style. Although there are not many varieties, there are made-to-order options. If you need omelettes, soup noodles or wontons, they will be made on demand and served to the table; the lobby bar on the first floor is suitable for relaxing here Enjoy afternoon tea slowly, although the dessert taste is generally not outstanding. There are two restaurants in front of the hotel. The one on the left specializes in Japanese food, which is good value for money. The Cantonese dim sum on the right is not in the queue this time. I will definitely arrange it next time~
There are many Chinese and Western options for eating and drinking around the hotel. Overall, it is good. The overall score is not low~

This time I booked a modern balcony room through the platform package and checked in on the weekend. It was very unfortunate! it turns out! it turns out! No upgrade to neon balcony room! It's said that the neon room is full, but I'm not happy! ! I originally came here for the Oriental Pearl’s special film perspective, and the package also came with a free upgrade for stays from January to February, so I grabbed the last bus and arranged it on the last weekend at the end of the month. To be honest, I was quite disappointed in the end! Finally, I ran to the balcony of the 1933 restaurant on the second floor and took a photo to keep as a souvenir~

The restaurant staff are polite and courteous. There are not many breakfast varieties. The wonton soup is very fresh. The quality of the shrimp is very good at first glance. It is better than what I have carefully purchased online over the years. The wonton skin is almost transparent after being cooked, and it is lined with pink. Fresh meat makes people very appetizing, and the ravioli wins! The room and bathroom are relatively large. Because it is an old house renovated and newly renovated, there are structural deficiencies and the space cannot be used well. The windows are not tight enough and the window screens are floating. It has been quite cold these two days, and the indoor temperature is basically 20 degrees. .

In order to have a balcony, I came back in February this year and specifically chose a more expensive room type with a double bed. Not only did it not have a balcony, but there was even an elevator outside the window and I could see the elevator there all day long. It went up and down and I was a little disappointed.
It is recommended that room types of different price ranges be marked with or without balconies and whether windows face the street.

The hotel staff's work connection is sometimes not very good and not smooth. Several times when something happens, I feel like I have to go upstairs, downstairs, upstairs, downstairs, and upstairs again. Halfway through the afternoon tea on the ninth floor, the restaurant's electricity went off...and then one of the elevators going down to the ninth floor after breakfast the next day broke down again. Didn't it mean it had just been renovated?
The most problematic thing is the Rose Restaurant upstairs in the hotel. When I walked to the door, a waitress asked me if I had a reservation? Last name? I said my last name was *, and then she said into the headset, "Where is the position of the surname *?" It felt bad. At least a more polite way of saying it would be "Where is the position of Mr./Ms. *?" Because it was still during the Spring Festival, so Think about it, don't want to ruin your family's mood.
Overall, I like the hotel because I am more regionally inclined, but there are still many areas that need improvement. I hope it can get better and better, and carry forward Shanghai's local regional characteristics and the rigorous style and quality of the older generation.

The facilities in the hotel are very complete, and the supporting small items are relatively high-end and thoughtful for customers. For example, the hair dryer is of the same brand as the Four Seasons Hotel. Due to time constraints, we did not try the free afternoon tea and cold drinks provided by the hotel this time.

In terms of service, the waiters in this store make you feel more considerate. On the way back to the room from the elevator, I saw the waiters cleaning the guest room. They worked together to clean the room. The love and joy for labor permeated their faces and In action, he asked them if they wanted some tea, and they quickly went to the tool room to help get it. The deposit arrived quickly after check-out. I thought MGM had to wait a day to refund the deposit, so I called to urge them to get it back. Also at the front desk, the receptionist at the Yangtze Hotel was much more comfortable than the receptionist at the MGM. The welcome fruits and drinks in the refrigerator at the Yangtze Hotel were very satisfying. Since I was staying during the Spring Festival, the waiter also came to give me a small lucky bag in the evening, which was very warm. (Complaining about MGM, they charge such a high room rate and the drinks in the refrigerator are not free) Therefore, if I choose again, I will definitely choose Yangtze Hotel. Regardless of location, service, cost-effectiveness... these are the reasons why I choose it. .

The only drawback is that the old neighborhoods of Shanghai are not properly protected. The buildings with historical heritage are tightly blocked by the surrounding high-rise buildings and do not get any sunlight. Without sunshine, old buildings have lost their souls. Of course, this is the result of uncontrolled and unplanned development. It also fully shows that Shanghai is left to its own devices when it comes to the protection of historical buildings. Unlike cities like Italy, the protection of history has been deeply rooted in every city. Personal bone marrow also shows that the concept of protection is very backward and has not paid attention to the significance of sunlight to old buildings.

msg:I am satisfied with the service and attitude, but dissatisfied with the facilities and management.

Worthy of praise:
1. Good location, convenient to attractions and subway stations
2. The service is courteous and friendly. For example, Poppy at the front desk tries her best to coordinate the room, the concierge shows the room, the hotel staff in the lobby bar and breakfast room, and the guest room turndown service make people feel at home.

Suggested improvements:
1. Old facilities: Although it is renovated, the toilet is old and smells bad, the hot water comes out slowly (2 minutes to prime), and the TV cannot project the screen. It cannot be completely renewed. It is recommended not to use it as a gimmick.
2. Lack of equipment: If you open the windows and doors on the lower floors, there will be a smell of oil fumes. The room is dry and the hotel does not provide humidifiers or filters. It is recommended that such equipment be arranged on the lower floors. I have caused rhinitis and allergies after my stay.
3. Price differentiation: There are differences between the promotional pictures and the actual situation. For example, the view of the rooms on the third floor will be blocked by telephone poles, and the coordinated arrangement of the rooms will also block the view. Considering that the room is tight during the Spring Festival, we accept the original arrangement. It is recommended to sell in a price range on low floors and high floors.
4. Chaotic management: Take the two-night breakfast I stayed at as an example. On the first day there was no problem with a small number of people, but on the second day there was a problem with a large number of people. You need to order the wontons and noodle soup separately for breakfast. The problem is that ① there is no eye-catching reminder ② the pressure is on the waiter. The meal lasted 50 minutes, of which 25 minutes were spent waiting for the wontons. I had to rush 3 waiters and didn’t get it until I asked the management staff. The one who called later than me had already finished eating and left. ③The housekeeping truck used the only passenger elevator to the restaurant on the 9th floor before the peak at 10 o'clock. When I asked, I learned that the hotel had to use the passenger elevator because the staff elevator was full during the exit and entrance. I couldn't understand that the hotel floor If it is not high, you can use the stairs. Even using the passenger elevator can avoid the dining rush hour. Therefore, it is believed that there is no emergency plan within the hotel and there are some management problems.

Convenient transportation in the city center area. It is very convenient to Nanjing Road, the Bund, Chenghuang Temple, Huanghe Road and Xintiandi. It is one step away from the subway station.

Taking advantage of the popularity of "flowers", I checked in on the small balcony👍Although I couldn't take a photo of the Oriental Pearl Tower, I could experience the beauty of the night with the blossoms in the street view. The location of the hotel is great! Right at the intersection is Raffles City, which is very convenient and satisfying for shopping, dining and traveling in the prime location of People's Square. The hotel's breakfast is also very good. Although the variety is not rich, the quality is better. The next day, we also enjoyed delicious afternoon tea in the hotel. The environment was elegant and suitable for chatting and gathering. Thank you Yangtze Hotel, a century-old hotel, for giving us an unforgettable stay experience. We will come again next time~🌹

The location is excellent, less than 50 meters from the subway entrance, next to Raffles City, and a stone's throw away from the Bund of Nanjing East Road. There is everything to eat and play around. The hotel itself is also an excellent historical building. The strong Shanghai style fascinated my friend, and he decisively asked to stay for another day.

After arriving at the hotel, I was directly upgraded to a neon balcony room and received complimentary afternoon tea and breakfast. Opening the balcony door, People's Square is within easy reach, and Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street is not far away. The overall style of old Shanghai in the Republic of China, European-style cast iron balconies, painted glazed ceilings, theater-effect red velvet curtains... everything is... Nostalgic but not old-fashioned.

Booked the check-in date in advance, entered through the Hankou Road gate, and received a warm reception from the front desk. We arrived early, and they very humanely allowed us to check in early.
On the day of check-in in Kaisen, the hotel upgraded the room to a neon balcony room for free.
The hotel is a white building with a flower balcony (but now it is silk flowers instead of fresh flowers). The double terrace rooms face south, the bathroom is well partitioned and the space is large.
There is a free mini bar (drinks, beer and sparkling water), breakfast for two on the next day and afternoon tea for two on the check-in day.
Because I upgraded to the Neon Balcony Room for free, I also got an extra fruit plate, thank you very much.
Breakfast is on the 9th floor, and the service is very good. It happened to be the Laba Festival, so I had Laba porridge.
There are many varieties of breakfast. If you want to make noodles, small wontons or drink coffee and hot milk, the waiters will help bring it to you.
Add stars to this service, Ctrip’s special price is 1099 worth!

I was given laundry detergent, and they also managed to get me some dishwashing liquid. I praised their meticulous service. When we left the store, the front desk also gave us a cute lamb doll.

I searched online for a long time and asked many people. At the same price, I can live near the Bund. Finally, I chose the Yangtze Hotel, saying it was more suitable for elderly families. But, in the end, I regretted it. When we arrived at the hotel door, the waiter was off duty. Push the door open and find the front desk to check in. There was a middle-aged and elderly man who looked like a local from Shanghai, who should be the lobby manager. He looked aloof and did not receive any reception. I can't accept this attitude! Also a local from Shanghai, the waiter at breakfast had a very good service attitude. This is the only thing I feel satisfied with about this hotel. The coupons given are useless because I am playing outside during the day and cannot spend them in the hotel. The elevator is small, can only fit four people, and the door is slow to close.

He didn't come to help me and stood looking at me coldly. The front desk service was also so reluctant. I asked. Does our room have a balcony? The front desk told me that I can change it with extra money. It’s not that we can’t afford it, it’s just that we hate this kind of service attitude. When we came back from shopping, two service staff at the door were hiding in the corner, smoking and chatting, but they didn’t come to greet the guests. I opened the door and booked a car to pick us up at 2 o'clock. We went to the front desk and asked for help to postpone check-out until 2 o'clock. The girl at the front desk reluctantly said that we should check out at 1 o'clock. I said, isn't there a rule in the hotel that we can check out at 2 o'clock? The front desk reluctantly said that it can't go past two o'clock. Hotel service at this price is really rare in Shanghai. I'm very disappointed.

After contacting the front desk, I found that the entire third floor was filled with this kind of sound. I didn't know what the problem was, so I had to change rooms. After struggling for almost half an hour in the middle of the night, I changed rooms, and even changed to a downgraded room type, which had neither service nor environment. Won't stay again.

I don’t think this is a reason. Do guests in guest rooms have to make room for activities? You don’t have to accept events if you have no conditions, but you can’t sacrifice the interests of tenants as a condition! The most annoying thing was at the back. When a very thin male waiter answered the customer's question about how long the wait would be, his attitude was particularly bad. He said directly, "I don't know, and there's nothing I can do about it!" He used so much force when placing the tableware, it was shocking! It’s really amazing to me that I have stayed in so many hotels!

That day I had a sprain in my foot and it was very swollen. I had to come down to get the takeaway by myself. Of course, after communicating with the hotel and being rejected, I bought a crutch because the pain in my foot worsened after taking the takeout and I could no longer walk. I called the hotel, and the hotel's response was, "It won't happen next time." How cold the response was. If it were his family, would they let a sick patient come down again and again to pick up things?
2. The deposit was not returned in time, the attitude was bad, and all the responsibility was put on the bank. The WeChat deposit is basically refundable instantly. If you consult the merchant online, you will be told to ask the bank. Should I say you are unprofessional or irresponsible? ah?
    Good location, good price, but the service is not up to par.

Switch off the lights, you want to find a place to hang your underwear or something? I'm sorry, no; the breakfast is unpalatable even if there are few varieties, and you have to pay extra to take the children to have breakfast. Shangri-La's breakfast is dozens of times richer than this, and you don't need to pay extra to bring children. In short, the price/performance ratio of 1500 a night is too low, not recommended

It is about 20 to 30 meters away from People's Square Station of the subway. The traffic is very convenient, and it is also convenient to use online car-hailing. The appearance of the hotel has the feeling of a bungalow, and the room size is not small, which is why I choose it. Many hotels in Shanghai have very small room sizes, and I still like to be more spacious. The bedroom is antique, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and there is a large bathtub. The sound insulation of the room is good, very quiet, and I can sleep well.
There are two shortcomings, one is that the slippers are well hidden, I found it after digging through several cabinets; the other is that the bedside socket is on the wall under the bedside table, which is inconvenient to plug in and out.

The room is very large, and the decoration is particularly elegant and retro, with details everywhere. When I live in it, I feel like I am either Ruan Lingyu or Zhou Xuan, hahahaha! The breakfast is on the ninth floor, but it is not the same elevator as the guest room. The foreign uncle who came down from the eighth floor gave us directions and asked us if we were Japanese (covering our faces)... Yes, the location is really good, especially suitable for me who have no sense of direction people. The eye-catching white building is just around the corner from Nanjing East Road Pedestrian Street. My baby went to Lam Dou and my mother went to several shopping malls to buy bags and clothes. They are all very close. Lying on the balcony at night, blowing the quiet wind, watching the bustle of people coming and going downstairs, you will feel the joy and comfort of living in this city from the bottom of your heart. It's a pity that I didn't experience the afternoon tea, didn't have a meal at the Yangtze Hotel, and didn't have time to visit the second floor. The schedule is in a hurry, and I will choose to live here next time I go to Shanghai!

msg:The hotel I like very much when I come to Shanghai. The ancient building in 1933 was designed by Li Fan, an architect who studied in France. It became one of the architectural landmarks that attracted much attention because of its innovative design, and it was also known as (the third largest hotel in the Far East). For a while, it was the haunt of famous actors in Shanghai in the 1920s and 1930s, and the birthplace of the famous song "Rose Rose I Love You". It is very well maintained and the location is superb. It is next to People's Park and East Nanjing Road. The subway line 2 directly leads to Hongqiao and Pudong Airport. The transportation is very convenient. It is very convenient to eat, drink and have fun. The hotel itself is also very good. Shanghai was prosperous in the last century, but the almshouse is very convenient to use. The corridors are decorated with antique objects from nearly a hundred years ago. The room is very large, the bed is super large and comfortable, foreign-related hotels, satellite TV can watch many foreign language channels for free, and there are also many foreigners. Checking in, the service is very considerate, and the price/performance ratio is very high. It's super awesome. I will stay here again next time~

On Metro Line 1, Exit 14 of People's Square is no more than 20 meters away from the hotel. The lady at the front desk is polite and has a good attitude! I booked a balcony room, and I was upgraded to a suite. I took my mother out to play, and my mother was very happy. The view from the balcony is good, with the a**osphere of old Shanghai. As soon as the hotel enters the gate, there is the aroma of roses. The soap and slippers in the room are very useful, and there is also capsule coffee. The size of the bathtub is satisfactory, deep and wide. The only thing that can be improved is the afternoon tea, which only has cookies and a simple fruit and sandwich. If you need to go out to play, you can completely ignore it. Not worth the time for it. It looks close to the Bund, but walking will be tiring. Suitable for shared bicycles. Next time I come to Shanghai, I will choose the Yangtze Hotel.

msg:A great staying experience! I found out on Ctrip that this is a hotel with a very historical Shanghai style.
Location: Located in the bustling and lively People's Square, the transportation is very convenient. It is only 3 stops away from Shanghai Station by subway line 1, and you can get there from Exit 14! Opposite is Raffles City, surrounded by shopping malls, restaurants, and convenience stores. It is super suitable for business, tourism, and meeting friends.
Enjoy the privileges of Yangzi: You can enjoy soft drinks and biscuits in the coffee shop on the 9th floor for free
Welcome fruit on the first day of check-in: the hotel provides a plate of welcome fruit on the day
Environment: very classical and elegant, as shown in the picture. Toothbrush and other small decorations are mainly in pink tones, including the hotel’s exclusive cookies 🍪, you can get it on the same day when you place an order through the mini program. Just in time for in-store activities, 88 yuan for two boxes to bring back to Beijing to share with colleagues😀
Service: The service is super good. The guidance from entry to the front desk, the check-in process and attitude at the front desk make people feel comfortable. Especially the uncle at the concierge depar**ent, he is super nice, I like it here👍
I will choose to stay here next time I stay!
The only regret is that there is no parking lot, so friends who drive here choose other hotels

After all, this outing is the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the parents' trip and marriage, and the special courtesy is even more ceremonial! Of course, the main factor that attracts us to choose this hotel is the location. It is in the bustling People's Square, adjacent to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, or the intersection of the three subway stations of Line 1, Line 2 and Line 8. The planned mode of transportation and itinerary are perfectly integrated!

Opposite the hotel is Raffles City, where you can eat, shop, watch movies, etc., and the price is close to the people, which is very convenient. There are many small restaurants around, even if breakfast is not included in the room rate, you will not be hungry. The surrounding Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, People's Park, Shanghai Museum, Shanghai Grand Theater, etc. are all within walking distance. It is very convenient for shopping, viewing, watching exhibitions, watching dramas, etc.
The hotel is an old building in the 1930s. It was designed by Mr. Li Pan, an architect who studied in Belgium. It is a typical Art Deco style and was once famous. The interior decoration of the hotel still follows this style, revealing a strong a**osphere of the Republic of China.
Due to the decoration style of the hotel's facilities, the tone is dark, giving people an old feeling, but it does not hinder the use. Inside the room, the living and bathroom spaces are also large enough, with the style of an old-fashioned high-end hotel.
The service is average, more or less a state-run a**osphere, but it is quite satisfactory, nothing special good or bad. However, in such a central location, with such a room size and price, the price/performance ratio is super high!

msg:My favorite is the soft bed and the self-heating smart toilet, both of which can relieve the fatigue of the day. There is also TV to watch in the bathtub, which is a novel experience. Since a house has two balconies, one is in the bedroom and the other is in the bathroom. The curtains in the bathroom are not easy to pull up, so I am not sure if there is air leakage from the outside door. The shower will be a bit cold, but the water temperature is still very stable. . The bathtub is also super big! The service attitude of the staff is very good, and they can also provide luggage storage service, so we can rest assured to go shopping and eat around the day after we check out. I really miss the past few days at Yangzi Hotel.

You can see the owner's care in every place, such as disposable items and room The cards are all fans, which greatly satisfied the girlish heart of the old woman. In particular, the surrounding traffic is very convenient. It is only a hundred meters away from the subway entrance, and it is a transit station, so it is very convenient to go anywhere. It takes half an hour to Hongqiao Airport without changing trains. Stop, it will be there in ten minutes. I will stay here next time I come to Shanghai. There is a small suggestion, that is, there is no USB port on the wall, and I am not used to having a socket now, but there is a power bank in the lobby on the first floor, which is very convenient, I really like this hotel!

Excellent location! Opposite to Exit 14 of People's Square Metro Station! Raffles, various popular restaurants, coffee shops, convenience stores _ so convenient!

Check-in, epidemic prevention-related provision, and check-in with peace of mind after confirmation!
You can walk around the corridor and take a look at all kinds of rare exhibits in old Shanghai.

The room was very quiet! The bed was just firm and comfortable!
Breakfast is also very worthy of the price! Chinese dim sum can have heating device better
Check out the front desk with a bright smile, humbly ask about hotel facilities or other improvement points! Very good

Great value for money hotel!

The western retro hotel interior and the theater-like spiral staircase all gave me a strong visual impact when I first stepped into this place. While looking for your own room, you can admire the old photos on the wall more than half a century ago, as if you can talk to the people inside and listen to them tell about the fleeting years related to this building. Standing on the small balcony surrounded by the exquisite wrought iron fence, my heart is very calm, and I am afraid that some sound will disturb the light and shadow here. I stared at the slanting sunshine alone for a long time, and the passage of time has not changed that this belongs to Shanghai. impression of the Republic of China.

msg:The Yangtze Hotel is a hotel with profound historical accumulation. The moment you open the door and step into the hotel lobby, you feel as if you have entered a time machine. The dark and deep colors and lights make you instantly quiet, and a door blocks the hustle and bustle of the road. The hotel has gone through 90 springs, summers, autumns and winters, and this unique sense of historical precipitation is really unique. The hotel once witnessed the prosperity and hustle and bustle of Shiliyangchang. After years of baptism, the prosperity is still there, but it adds a bit of history.
         From the details of the hotel, it can be seen that a lot of effort has been put into the design of the year and the renovation in recent years. The hotel rooms are very high and the walls are thick and soundproof. Even if you stay in the hotel in winter, you will not feel too cold even if you don’t turn on the air conditioner, and the temperature is suitable. The windows of the rooms can be opened, and some rooms have balconies. The layout of the room is also relatively good. The bathroom is large and equipped with an oversized bathtub. This kind of large bathtub is very comfortable to take a bath in, but you also need to pay attention to safety. The bathtub is relatively deep, and you must pay attention to safety when entering and exiting the bathtub.
         The soft power of the hotel is also relatively strong, and the staff at the front desk are naturally considerate. The cleaning lady of the guest room works carefully and pays attention to details.
         There is a small problem during the stay. On the evening of January 26, I called the front desk to ask for slippers, but one of the two pairs of slippers delivered was used. This problem needs attention, such as bath towels, towels, slippers, and bedding. Do not confuse them. These items are close-fitting items that are most likely to cause cross-infection of diseases. Be careful not to give the used items to the guests.
         Overall the hotel is still very good, software and hardware is still excellent. Some small details are more perfect when they are noticed.
         I want to experience the suite in the future.

Not saying it has to be! Seems like I'm making unreasonable demands for a priceless little box? The attitude of the receptionist who checked in on the morning of the 25th was very good. When I checked out on the 27th, I called at 11:30 and said that I could not delay today, even later. Originally, I didn't ask for it to be until 2 o'clock. Is it too exaggerated to call at 11:30? There is often no one at the door, and it’s okay to open the door by yourself. The hotel management and maintenance are too bad! The room was very cold. Really disappointed! It's the first time I lived here in 12 years, it's really amazing, what the hell is it now! Speechless, will not choose in the future!

Although it has been decorated for more than ten years, the materials are exquisite, mainly marble and solid wood, and the maintenance is quite good. It has a sense of age without a sense of rundown. There was an epidemic a few years ago, and there were very few guests, and I felt good. The corridor windows are very characteristic. The service attitude is very good, but I didn't get the best room at the beginning. I changed it after I made a request, and I felt a little uncomfortable. In fact, there are many vacancies. Wouldn't it be better to satisfy the customers who have already stayed? I used to live in other hotels, and even free upgrades in similar situations, for reference.

I checked in in the early morning of the first day because there was no room type we ordered. I changed the room type when I called the next day and said that I had to move the room. This room cannot be used for the first time. Go to the front desk to communicate and say to give a good review, you can continue to live. 🤷‍♀️ Double standard? The second check-out took nearly 15 minutes. I needed an invoice. The front desk answered the phone while printing the invoice. I said I was in a hurry to catch the train. The emotional performance caused by the factors gives the service recipient a very poor experience!

Compared with hotels in the same price range, the management is also more rigorous and cost-effective.

It has undergone the changes of the times, but it is unrelenting, and it has never changed for anyone. In this long time scale, in the slightly mottled balcony fence, it has experienced the immersion of the years, and it has recorded a bit of memory for every time traveler. But it is not deliberate, just like a gust of wind on the balcony can wipe everything away.
Talk about the service here
Just like this hotel, everything is so natural and comfortable.
Everyone in the concierge depar**ent makes us feel like we are back home, whether Leo or Ray, others can't name them, but we have clear pictures in our minds.
The restaurant partners are very kind and diligent, and every time we lose our weight loss plan.
The hygienic sisters are so considerate, even if they work hard, they are so polite. The new guy Ren is also very diligent. If the Yangtze is a rose or an orchid, then these people are gardeners who keep the flowers fresh. They are meticulous in hygiene and there is nothing to be picky about.
How is Wei Wei in sales so great😄
Finally, talk about the front desk, almost familiar with every front desk staff, thank you for every sincere service you provide us. Let’s talk about the edith who has known you for a long time. I have troubled you the most times, but I really appreciate what you have done for us. You have made us love Yangtze even more. There is no shortage of stories or legends in this building, and the friendship between us will definitely be there. Add a touch of warmth to this building in our impression.
Yangtze, raise your best look in my eyes!

I ate 2500+ for lunch. The fried rice tableware I ordered was a wooden frame. Just when I came to the table, several small cockroaches ran out of the wooden frame! Extremely disgusting, extremely disappointing! The service staff returned and delivered the food. Fortunately, it was discovered in time.

酒店衞生也還可以，畢竟是老酒店！中規中矩吧！
再説説我認為的不好！請大家自己品！首先，
入住首日歡迎水果:一個小香蕉，一個小蘋果，一個小梨！你們看照片！我認為，如果送，就大大方方的送！這個我覺得有點小氣，至少不和酒店的身份相匹配！還有就是下午茶！我都沒拍！那就一個寒酸！以為是很好，實則就是一個大廳外面的走廊，八月份的上海那叫一個熱！就一張桌子，我們去了有兩人坐的，我們就沒地方了！東西那就更是少得可憐！
最後就是早點！住的是一千多的酒店，吃的是漢庭的早點！你們就想吧！所以，我們就第一天去吃了早點，其他兩天就出去吃了！
總而言之一句話，如果你是衝著下午茶，陽台拍照以及早點，那我真心不建議你去入住！你大可以選擇揚子酒店附近的酒店！真心的，良心建議！

還可以更完善的地方：空調聲音較大，夜深人靜的時候比較明顯；插頭位置設計不太合理，唯一一個順手的插孔沒有電；沒有晾衣繩，這個確實不方便，尤其夏天每日都有一堆衣服要洗要晾，找不到地方掛；化粧鏡不是掛牆式的，用的時候需要挪來挪去；浴缸旁的百葉窗的葉片變形了，晚上開燈洗漱的時候很透光，能看到對面樓上樓下的房間，我的房間對面估計也能看的非常清楚，私密性不好，淋浴間是透明玻璃，斜對着浴缸窗户，洗澡不踏實。
總體入住體驗感是滿意的，希望揚子飯店越來越好。

msg:老建築用作酒店，門廳過道室內都是老上海風格，看着好看，但居住體驗是室內設施不夠便捷，舉個例子：衹有咖啡杯，沒有比咖啡杯高一點的水杯。此外，我第一開始住的不是朝街方向的，那種房間窗外是天井，有壓抑感，更吃驚的是有相當大的下水道的味道。一千多塊一間的房間，這種質量可謂性價比不高。

The sister surnamed Ni at the front desk is very kind, and specially upgraded us to a room with a balcony, which I like very much.
Overall, the hotel staff I met were very polite and kind. The room is quite large, especially the bathroom, which is separated from wet and dry, and each space has its own function. The location is very convenient, just cross the road from the subway station.
Next time I have a chance, I will choose the Yangtze Hotel again. I especially like the scent after entering the hotel🌹

It is full of fumes. The front desk service is poor and the service needs to be improved. Don't act like I owe you money. It would be nice if the house has a big bathtub.

msg:Very disappointed! Not looking for awkwardness! But it's really frustrating. Because the price of large-scale conferences in Pudong doubled, I saw that this hotel is full of age and has a good score, so I booked it.
1. Ctrip only has no breakfast or double breakfast, and I am only one person. After arriving at the store, I hope that the front desk will give you a copy. The front desk will ask Ctrip, and Ctrip will ask the front desk. After explaining the situation, Ctrip's customer service will communicate for half a day and give feedback-no breakfast. It’s just like a beggar, and I still don’t want to give it away after tossing around. Why should I find Ctrip? As a result, there was really no time for breakfast the next day, which made my stomach unhappy.
2. The front desk is indifferent, the female receptionist and the male leader did not raise their heads from the beginning to the end during the check-out communication. Gives a condescending feeling. The hotel should replace the receptionist with a robot! Save money and be efficient!
3. Is a 500 incidental deposit required for check-in for Ctrip orders? ? Many five-star hotels in Pudong do not charge a deposit, so why not? ?
4. When you arrive at the door of the room when you check in, three or four male waiters come out of the room one after another, laughing and playing, no communication, no explanation, no greeting when you see the guest checking in. After thinking about it for a long time, I still can't figure it out. Are they using my room for a meeting?
5. The door skin on the top of the minibar is peeling off.
6. Going back to the hotel in the middle of the night, a male waiter next to the takeaway counter on the first floor looked down and swiped his phone seriously. Standing by his side for a long time, always bowing his head to study when passing by and entering the elevator. admire!
7. Going back to the room in the middle of the night, there is actually a small lipstick box behind the table? ! I thought it was a family planning supplies box! Fortunately, single occupancy, otherwise big trouble!
8. The bedside lampshade shakes badly, and no one seems to be paying attention.
9. The bedside lamp control switch sticker is rough and peeling.
10. Clothes and trousers hang in a mess.
11. There is no plastic bag in the trash can? Fortunately, I didn't generate any garbage, otherwise, how to deal with the sanitation of the inner wall of the barrel? Think carefully.
advantage:
The hot water in the bath comes out quickly, the slippers are very comfortable, and the soles are very thick. Seconds* to many five-star hotels.
To sum up, it feels like a state-owned enterprise is managing. The front desk service is arrogant and indifferent, and the room products are mottled. Most importantly, the service is impersonal. By the way, butler service? ? ? Is this family in charge? ? ? ? ?
There are many high-star hotels around, and Kempinski's entire suite is only a few hundred dollars more expensive, which is not worth it.

msg:Not recommended for parents and children. I just found it randomly between the Natural History Museum, Shanghai Expo and the Bund. The room was dimly lit and the bathroom facilities were old and damaged. The hotel staff were keen on playing with mobile phones. It was suitable for business and the negotiated price was paid. I didn’t bring the charger. The hotel looked like I swallowed it silently

msg:In order to avoid the May Day peak, I specially booked a 3-night itinerary from April 27 to 30. What made me feel a little unhappy was that when I checked in, I specifically asked if I could upgrade (upgrade to a city view room with a balcony, which I found online before) ) and was told no. When I checked in at the hotel, I asked again and was told no. There were no available rooms. Well, it seemed that it was still very busy during the off-peak hours! Unexpectedly, I checked out today, the 30th. The May Day holiday ushered in the peak period from the 29th, and there were obviously more people than I had come a few days ago. I rested at the front desk, and the front desk staff helped several people who had just checked in. Guests staying at the hotel will be upgraded for free, and they will even call guests who have not yet arrived. If they can confirm early, they can upgrade! I was very depressed. When I opened Ctrip, the booking channels were all gray (booking completed) and I could still upgrade. But I arrived in Shanghai early on the 27th and was told that I couldn't upgrade my room type? Is this discrimination against guests from Hangzhou, Zhejiang?

msg:I'm sure the ring was placed on the right bedside table... I forgot to bring it when I checked out. I found it when I went back to get my luggage. I went upstairs to find it and it was gone! ! Junk hotel.
