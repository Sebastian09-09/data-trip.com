The staff were so great they even upgraded us as it was a special occasion! Large room, light and quiet. Highly recommended.

See for yourself with all the pictures I took for you guys because I found before making the reservation there was lacking some breakfast pictures. I think the only think I would like to see if I come back is FRESH squeezed juices instead of concentrated, that’s the only improvement that needs to be made. Otherwise excellent, I recommend. There is even a robot at the hotel that delivers food to your room, so cute, looking like wall-e.

msg:It is a nice hotel, and in a very convenient location, only steps from Dapuqiao station on Line 9 and walking distance to the French Concession. But the hotel certainly seems to be starting to suffer from some neglect, especially for a Premium brand of Accor. Some signs of wear in the room, the most prominent being an office chair whose finish is peeling. Also a TV that is in need of being updated with poor picture quality and not even an HDMI connection. But the most disappointing part was the low level of service. 

Although staff were generally helpful with questions, some things should not need to be asked for a hotel of this stature. When checking in, no information was provided about breakfast. I had to go back twice to ask the time and location of breakfast. Over three nights, the room was not made up. I can appreciate that cleaning staff may have been limited due to Covid, but surely the bed could have at least been made up, especially when this is a Premium brand. Breakfast was mediocre, again with the reference being a Premium brand. Some good options, but did not live  up to the Premium offerings of comparable hotels, not to mention the sausages that were inedible because the casing was cooked to the consistency of plastic. Lastly, I was extremely disappointed to find the pool closed due to Covid (government restrictions had been lifted), with no notice prior to, or even during check in. I chose this hotel specifically for the indoor pool with weather in Shanghai being cold, so this was a big problem for me.

The pictures provided are for a room upgrade, which was appreciated (business studio room). Perhaps this was an effort to make up for some of the limitations, such as the pool closure and the lack of housekeeping? But no mention of this. Again the staff should have been up front about these things when checking in. 

With some attention to these matters, this hotel could live up to the "Premium" brand for Accor. Sadly, it is not there now and may deteriorate further.

This hotel is perfect if you’re looking to experience what hotels were like 20 years ago. The era before smartphones. So the bed doesn’t have chargers near it, the WiFi peaks at 9 Mbps, and the TVs are so old, they don’t even have HDMI cables. They use the RAC cables (yes, yellow, white and red cables)
Even quarantine hotels in China have modern TVs where you can just plug your laptop and watch Netflix or any streamer of your preference.

In all honesty, the room is nice, comfy bed, good service. But it’s 10 years away from being a museum. This hotel needs an urgent modernization of their appliances.

msg:We had a wonderful stay at the Pullman Shanghai. Immediately when we checked in, the customer experience manager came to speak to us & gave me her wechat so that I could contact her if I needed anything & we were upgraded to a junior suite. The room was a good size with a sofa & armchair, a desk, a large wardrobe, a king sized bed & a large bathroom. As a coffee addict, I appreciated the coffee machine in the room as well. The bed was big & very comfortable with feather pillows. The bathroom had a bath & walk in shower & a large area around the sink & a drawer - so lots of space to put things & feel at home. 

We didn't eat at the hotel but we did get food delivered from an app & it either went to a locker to collect or a robot brought it to the door. There is a good sized pool to use as well. Great location a few minutes walk from Dapuqiao metro station & there are shops & restaurants & a mall nearby. 

The customer experience manager was extremely helpful in finding out where we could go to get a Covid test to fly out of Shanghai over the holiday (quite a few places closed) & she called up to check that foreigners (using a passport) could go & that the place was open. We'd already tried a few places by ourselves without luck & were cold & tired from moving around the city trying to find somewhere, so we were very grateful to her for finding out this information. 

Overall, an amazing stay & we'll absolutely stay here again the next time we're in Shanghai.

I live in Shanghai but I would recommend this to people from other cities in China as the location is very close to the river and also easy to reach downtown for tourists. Clean rooms for families or single people. Pool is also very nice with sauna and steam room.

They allowed me to check in at 8:30am, and a late check out at 2:00pm the next day without any fees. Everything was great! A budget price, but still has the same amenities as a super high end hotel. The room was huge and spacious. Pillows were very fluffy. Lots of western choices in their breakfast buffet. Staff all speaks fluent English. Literally a five minute walk from Line 9 Dapuqiao subway station. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

msg:Dear management of Pullman Skyway,

I stayed at Pullman Skyway ten years ago and had a sweet Christmas stay there. Therefore, Pullman Skyway always occupied a special place in my heart. However, I need to say that my experience this time is miserable that I had no chance but to change to another hotel after two nights.

I understand that the hotel is under massive renovation. Still, I do not believe that that can be a legitimate reason for the hotel to provide its guests with such terrible rooms. The renovation noise turned extremely loud and disturbing every day from 9 AM till dawn. That was a severe problem for a premium hotel like Pullman as it just disables guests to have a proper rest, which I believe should be the primary priority of any hotel. I have changed rooms three times, from the 19th floor to the 10th floor, but the noise problem just got more serious. Such a frequent transfer between rooms in itself is actually already entirely unacceptable since it costs guests so much time and energy. My first day in Shanghai was basically wasted in the hotel because of the need to change room. The transfer to another room in itself already took a lot of time, but what wasted my time even more was the unfulfilled promise by the front desk, which always promised to help me change to another room IMMEDIATELY. The front desk made this promise whenever I complained about the noise. However, it turned out that it always took them two to three hours to give me a new room. Because I had mistakenly trusted the promise by the front desk, I sat idle in my room for nearly six hours (2 hours of waiting time times three occasions of needing to change room). Every time, the excuse the front desk gave me was that they needed to check room by room to make sure that the new room would be quiet. However, I could always hear thunderous renovation noise immediately after entering the new room. In that case, what was the front desk actually doing for that two hours? I am not convinced that they really took that two good hours to check the room. If you don't have a room that is not noisy, just tell your guests; if you are not working to help the guests to help change room immediately, just tell your guests instead of lying to them and let them waste six hours!

So what room did I end up staying in after wasting one good day inside the hotel? Still a noisy room, but with a lovely view over the trash station. I did not ask the front desk to arrange another room after that, as I knew that they simply did not have one.

I also need to say that the duty manager, throughout the entire mess, gave me a black face. She did not seem to be willing to help but just want me to go away.

It is so disappointing to see that Pullman Skyway has now become such a chaotic hotel without any room not disturbed by the renovation noise but full of rude and extremely inefficient staff who always lie to their guests. I am sorry, but I would discourage my friend from staying at this hotel, and I would definitely avoid it as well.

Best,

The bathroom only has a shower head, and the water temperature is hot and cold.
On the day of check-out, I was forcefully asked by the front desk to write a positive review on Ctrip.
I was too lazy to leave a negative review. It took three calls a week to send the personal belongings left behind in the hotel. Worst hotel ever.

This is the fifth time I have chosen to stay at Pullman Shanghai Skyway. Although I am already a regular guest here, every experience makes me feel fresh and satisfied. Stayed here for the first time this year, and it left a deep impression on me.
As soon as you enter the hotel lobby, the familiar and warm a**osphere hits your face. The front desk staff were welcoming and professional, and their smiles made me feel like I was home. The check-in process was simple and efficient, which made me feel very comfortable.
The room I stayed in was spacious and comfortable, and the decoration was elegant yet modern. The bed is soft and comfortable, and you can feel the warmth of home as soon as you lie down on it. Moreover, the facilities in the room are all available, whether it is a coffee machine, a safe or high-speed Wi-Fi, I am very satisfied.
Dining at the hotel's restaurant was also a pleasant experience. The dishes are rich and varied, and the taste is authentic, which makes me, an authentic Shanghainese, satisfied. Moreover, the service in the restaurant was also very attentive, making me feel like home.
Overall, Pullman Shanghai Skyway is an excellent hotel. I am very satisfied with its hardware facilities, services and cultural a**osphere. This stay experience made me more convinced that this is the best choice for me during my trip.

After a comparison online, I chose the suite with executive benefits. After checking in, I felt very good. Although the suite was not as big as I expected, the hotel bed was still very comfortable.
At 2:30 in the afternoon, we went to the executive lounge to enjoy afternoon tea. The refreshments are very rich and the environment is very good. The attitude of the service staff is also very good... I was also told that I can continue to come in the evening and use the happy hour.
The happy hour from 6 to 8 pm is not just for drinking, but also for dinner...my daughter is very happy.
    For breakfast the next morning, we chose Louxiang on the first floor of b, which had a very rich variety and beautiful environment. I felt like I was on vacation.
   Room check-out is delayed until 2pm. There is enough time for us to take our time.
The whole family gave high marks to this temporary hotel trip.

This girl After I picked it up, I was asked to verify the message on my phone before giving it to me. She was really in good spirits and even asked her to have a cup of coffee, but she didn't accept it. Just saying: If you hope your stay is good, you can give me a good review. Big hotels are just different! ! I will continue to stay at your hotel next time I come to Shanghai for a business trip.

Their restaurant is also very unique. Breakfast is served at Tanhua on the B1 floor. There is an outdoor garden with a flowing waterfall inside. The scenery is great ~ I recommend everyone to stay there☺️

There is also a shopping mall with a lot of food. It's quite comfortable to stay in the hotel. The waiters are also very good. I'm very satisfied. 👍🏻It is said that they have a buffet restaurant on the b1 floor for dinner. I went to have a meal with my friends out of curiosity. The price is very cost-effective and there are quite a lot of dishes. It's good. Several types of hairy crabs are all-you-can-eat, and barbecue and desserts are also good. After dinner, we also went to the hotel’s gym. Haha, the environment is very quiet, which is nice!

The location of the hotel is very convenient, with many restaurants and shops around. The room is very clean, the decoration is very comfortable and warm, and the everything is very complete. I especially like the bed. I can have a good night's sleep.
To my surprise, outside the breakfast room is a large garden with waterfalls and many other things 🐟~ It’s so cute~
You can also sit outside and enjoy the breeze, which is so comfortable. The waiters are very enthusiastic, professional, and yes, there is also a buffet dinner, which is delicious and includes hairy crabs. Will come again in the future, highly recommended!

Home renovation in 2021: Use the electric drill early in the morning
This year I stayed in the toilet seat and there was still urine in it. It was really disgusting. When I told the front desk, they only said they would help with cleaning and there was no apology.
Hygiene: Very poor

Service: The front desk service is also very poor. The only good one is the concierge.
The price/performance ratio is not as good as a three or four hundred fast hotel

I had to wait for several hours to deliver slippers. When I was about to go out for dinner, no one came to deliver them. Moreover, the hotel did not inform in advance when booking the decoration. , the decoration was very loud during the day and kept buzzing. The air conditioner in the room was so loud that I couldn't sleep! And when I checked in, the hotel clearly had upgradeable rooms available. As an Accor Platinum member, the front desk was very tough and kept saying that I couldn't upgrade. The tone seemed to question me because I don't have a Platinum membership and I won't stay again next time. The girl at the front desk service too poor! The service is inconsistent with what Ctrip customer service said. The superior twin room my friend booked from ** is larger than the one I live in, and the floor is higher than ours. There is no noise from the air conditioner. I am speechless.

The family and the porter boy went upstairs and found the door open. When they went in, they saw that the room had not been cleaned, which was outrageous. The front desk later came up and changed a room. At that time, they apologized and said they would provide an apology fruit plate. However, there was no apology at checkout. I mentioned this again when checking out, and the front desk apologized again, but that was it. A five-star hotel made such a low-level mistake, giving the wrong key card to a room that was not ready (it might even be a room with a guest in it!). It would be fine if the girl at the front desk just apologized. The management has a big responsibility. Mistakes.

I especially recommend the nearby Arashiyama breakfast restaurant. The style and meals of the American restaurant are very authentic. The front desk took the initiative to help us upgrade the executive suite, and the 21st floor has a wide view. There is also a capsule coffee machine available in the room, which I like very much. In the evening, I ordered food at the executive lounge on the 24th floor. The environment and taste were good, and fruit and snacks were offered as gifts, which kept surprising me. I forgot the lotion in the room. I quickly confirmed it by phone and helped to mail it. It is really considerate. I must like the hotel and the high-quality service in Shanghai👍

There was a warm light in the room, and the floor lamp was also broken. With bare lights, I asked to change the room to a room with a desk by the window, and was told that there was no such room type.
The service is really unflattering. I wanted to go swimming at 9:00 p.m., but the front desk in the lobby replied that it was closed at 9:00 p.m. The next day I went to the swimming pool during the day, and they said it was 10:00 p.m.
The most amazing thing is that the kids have documents to print, so they go to the front desk in the lobby and Nina replies and prints 10 yuan a piece, then walks to the opposite real estate agent who doesn’t have any consumption, and immediately helps me print them out for free, and then finds a lobby worker in a suit who works in the lobby The staff asked about printing again, and replied that it was not 10 yuan, but 5 yuan per sheet. Is this deliberately making things difficult for the residents? Does the Pricing Bureau know this price? As a five-star hotel, it's unbelievable... If you don't want to do service, you can change to self-service... If you have children, it is recommended not to stay

The only thing I was dissatisfied with was the parking security guard. The older one was arrogant and yelled at me when he ordered the cars to stop.

msg:[To the hotel: If you are copying and pasting, please do not reply] I specifically chose the off-season weekend in November to travel to Shanghai. This time I mainly get up early to go to Shanghai Disneyland on Saturday. The dissatisfaction points are: 1) I arrived at the front desk to check in at 13:00 on Friday and was told that the room would not be available until 15:00. I requested to call or send an email when a room was available, but was rejected. According to the terms of Ctrip booking, the hotel is actually obliged to prepare a room for me at 14:00. 2) After checking in at 17:30, I found that there were no red wine goblets, bottle openers and paid red wine in the room, so I immediately called to ask for them. It took 20 minutes to deliver it, and he was asked to return the bottle opener immediately, but at that time the wine was still on its way to be taken out. . Later that night, I met the waiter at the buffet dinner on the first floor. It turned out that he asked the buffet waiter to "borrow" a bottle opener to me. I was so speechless. Didn't the housekeeping department not have bottle openers and red wine glasses? 3) The air conditioner is too hot, and the central air conditioner is useless even if it is set to 16°C. At 2 o'clock in the middle of the night, the heat made the bedding wet and unbearable. After calling, a very noisy Gree hair dryer was delivered. The waiter sighed after I said the room was very hot. I was speechless when I thought about having to get up at 7 o'clock in the morning. The room was so hot. Fortunately, I was much better qualified than him, so I didn't want to have an attack in front of him. After all, with his attitude, he couldn't upgrade my room. Generally speaking, it is generally impossible to check in at 14 o'clock and refuse to remind the room that it is ready (let alone proactively ask if a reminder is needed); the room in November is extremely hot, even sleeping naked, and the temperature cannot be controlled by oneself ( A hotel in the south is like a hotel in the north, and the air is very dry), and the air blower used to make up for it is very noisy; the room cannot provide a bottle opener for check-out, and the red wine glass takes 20 minutes+ to be delivered. There is no paid red wine in the minibar

I always thought that Pullman is the best cost-effective hotel within the range from the Bund to Dapu Bridge. Why do you want to stay in those nondescript homestays? Some internet celebrity homestays are also very expensive. In fact, the interior decoration is very ordinary, and the sound insulation effect is poor. They have been isolated hotels, and some even have no windows. At most, they are more than 100 cheaper. Why not choose the tall Pullman Hotel Woolen cloth? The sound insulation of the hotel is very good, the bed is very comfortable, thank you.

Although there are some corners where the glue is not very satisfactory, the average hotel guest will not pay attention to these unless they have obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are not many places to eat nearby. The typhoon shelter downstairs can be opened until 5 a.m. the next day. There are also all kinds of leisure and entertainment, and the Sun and Moonlight is opposite. Anyway, you have everything you can think of. The only drawback is the swimming pool. A circular swimming pool is divided into 4 parts. The two middle pillars are hand-held. If there are too many people swimming, the experience will be very poor. It is already short. The girl at the door didn't even hand out towels. Fortunately, the time in the swimming pool was only about an hour.

No, I have indeed forgotten it, and I cannot wish it to others. When I arrived at the airport, I immediately contacted the hotel and confirmed that the items were there. I was given the address to be paid by SF Express. I was originally very grateful. But what I didn’t expect was that after 4 days, I didn’t find the message sent at all. I communicated with the front desk again to confirm, and said that I would get a reply as soon as possible. However, after 2 and a half hours, there was no reply, and I was asked to call again.

The last stop in Shanghai, the hotel occupancy rate is still very high. The check-in process is efficient and the service is enthusiastic. I especially praise the service of Gary at the front desk
nice! Patiently introduced the hotel facilities and recommended some restaurants and small shops near ASE. Very home away from home. The executive hall has also been upgraded, and the room facilities are basically OK.
Cleanliness is in place. It's a pity that the weather was not good that day, and it looked a little bleak during the day.
Ser, but the night view is pretty good! Will continue to choose Pullman next time

The room is old, but the light switches are here and there, the night light is broken, the water from the shower head is like needles and cannot be adjusted, the joint is leaking and has to be tightened by itself, and what's more terrible is that the water temperature is still hot and cold. Let's talk about the hotel service. All the staff from the front desk to the restaurant to the cleaning staff are all cold-faced. They always answer questions and ignore them, as if they owe them money, let alone say hello to them. The service attitude is really the first time I have seen it.

msg:Introduction: Pullman is an upscale hotel brand under Accor, which is specially designed to meet the needs of business people. Pullman hotels aim to provide high-end business travelers with a full range of excellent services, cutting-edge technology and "Pullman Innovation Meetings", a new way of organizing business meetings and incentive programs.
I think the above introduction to the Pullman Hotel is very precise.
First of all, Pullman Shanghai Skyway Hotel has a unique and excellent location, opposite to the Xujiahui business district, and can reach important areas in Shanghai such as Huaihai Road, Nanjing Road, and the Bund in a short time. The Puxi hotel is more convenient for the New International Exhibition Center and the World Expo site.
The hotel room has good lighting, and the furniture is elegant and a**ospheric, making the stay feel very warm.
The hotel's circular swimming pool is also quite characteristic (for me who likes to swim, this is a plus).
For hotel meals, due to the rush check-out time this time, I didn't have time to experience it.
ps: The problem of free parking needs to be further improved.
Looking forward to seeing you again at Pullman Shanghai Skyway next time. There will be a period later!

Hygiene: Reluctantly, the cigarette butts on the ground at the front desk will be discounted as soon as you enter the door

Service: The concierge in the front hall is not enthusiastic enough. I am alone, and when two boxes are brought in, he doesn't know how to extend a hand to help. I have to ask him personally to move! it's not good

Facilities: The central air conditioner is not very useful, the room is very hot
 The gym facilities are very good 👍 The room facilities are also good.
Breakfast: very 🉑️ complete variety and rich taste, especially the named oil and vinegar salad juice, which is more delicious than other hotels.
There is only one shower head, and it is a pity that there is no shower head on the ceiling.
Environment: It is the best among these items, giving people a very comfortable feeling.

After arriving at the hotel, the front desk told me to pay directly The house payment was also paid for the two orders. Ctrip's customer service called and said that the order was canceled because it was paid offline. On the afternoon of the 26th, I went to check out early in the morning on the 27th. The front desk said that the financial rest, let me I left my Alipay account number and name, and said that it would be refunded to me within one month at most. On 1.25, I asked the hotel's online customer service, but I could not reply. I called the front desk again and said to verify, and I will wait for the refund , Another week has passed, and the account has not been received for a long time. This store has no integrity, 800 yuan, which cannot be refunded for more than a month, everyone avoids pitfalls

It only costs 749 including breakfast! I don’t need Ctrip in the future, just uninstall it after posting a review!
The hotel check-in experience is average. The restaurant on the roof was reserved for exams outside, and it was moved to B1. The outdoor garden is being renovated. There are fitness members and children who are swimming outside. The windows are fully closed and there is no natural ventilation. In short, this Pullman is a bit unsatisfactory compared to others.

This time, I just entered the room and thought it was redecorated. After looking carefully, I added a sofa. The style is nondescript, and the sofa is light and fluffy. Lighting design and control are completely out of consideration for customer needs. If you are a girl and need makeup, it is also very inconvenient. The pillows are very hard, the harder you sleep in the middle of the night! The bathroom was even more dissatisfied. The shower head was replaced with a small broken nozzle worth dozens of yuan, and the water flow was extremely thin! Not as good as the previous nozzle! Hair has to be washed for half a day! Do you have any misunderstanding about five-star purchasing? Or is there any misunderstanding about the customer base? So dissatisfied! five star? Ha ha, never live again!

The mattresses on both beds had collapsed in the middle. When I entered the room at night, I found that one of the lights was broken and kept flashing. It took me a long time to find the corresponding switch. The shower water is very small, just a shower head, the shower hole is very thin, it's like drizzle. The setting of the lobby is not very reasonable, and the best location is given to the hotel as the reception desk. The elevator room is shared with the office building, so a hollow screen was used to block it.
But the sanitation is still good, at least it is clean. For a room with this price, I think it is better to stay in the whole season.
If the above is said to be three or four stars, it would be acceptable, but with a Ctrip rating of 5 diamonds and a price of nearly 1,000 yuan per night, I think it is a bit unworthy of the name.

msg:I have stayed at this hotel many times before and it feels good. The business suite I stayed in this time, the room decoration is old and worn in many places. Also, as other guests have reported, the location of electrical sockets is very inconvenient. It is understandable that the old hotel cannot be upgraded due to the financial, material and human resources of the epidemic. The most complained about is the breakfast set with a price of ¥88. There is no choice, and the price/performance ratio is very low. Basically, ready-made or semi-finished products are heated up, and hot and cold food is stuffed in a plastic bag. If I had known earlier, it would be better to go out and eat a bowl of noodles.
The front desk service is polite and efficient. The capsule coffee in the house is of good quality.

On the morning of the 17th, the guy at the swimming pool counter, due to the unexpected password of the locker, was very patient to provide help and solved the problem smoothly. He pulled down his glasses in the rush, and the guy asked lVY from the housekeeping depar**ent to deliver it to the room in time. I would like to express my thanks! The hotel service is very warm 👍🏻3, check-in and check-out are efficient and fast, and the experience is very good! The hotel has some years as soon as possible, but the cleanliness and attentive service really add points to the hotel and deserve to be praised👍🏻4. The nucleic acid has just passed the "shelf life". The hotel kindly informed the lobby to do nucleic acid. I can't dine in, I'll go to experience it when it's normal!

I will post pictures later. There were no charging sockets on both sides of the bed. It was the first time I encountered such a hotel. It was very inconvenient. I had to go to the TV to charge. In addition, the network was extremely poor. I had no choice but to use my own data. The facilities inside were too old, and the lobby was a mess. There was no grade at all. It was mixed with other commercial ones. It was not a separate hotel lobby. It was very low-class and not worth the price at all. I really think it is shameful that there is such a hotel in Shanghai. Then I Let me tell you the following, other hotels only require nucleic acid testing, but this one requires an antigen test on the spot, otherwise they will not let you stay. The hotel receptionist had a blank expression on her face and spoke very harshly. Then I said I had a 24-hour nucleic acid test, but she said no and that I had to do an antigen test. I said the government has no such regulations, so why does your hotel do this? She said then you can not stay. I was completely speechless, and then I was so angry that I threw the antigen directly on the table. He went to call the leader. When the leader came, he had a blank expression on his face and said the same thing again. In the end, I had no choice but to do it. After that, he asked me to throw away the garbage. I was convinced. Can't your hotel handle it itself? I started arguing with him. The quality of this waiter is really poor. He said this is your excrement, just like your **. I was completely speechless. I was so angry that I took out my phone to record a video, which I won’t post here. What kind of training is this to train such a person. Or is it under Accor Hotel? I am really speechless. Shanghai has such a service industry, which drags Shanghai down. I will just post the pictures below. People who have requirements for living should be cautious. It’s better to read his negative reviews. There are too many. It’s quite speechless. Next time I stay in a hotel, I will definitely read the negative reviews. Every failure makes me wiser.

I don’t know whether there is formaldehyde release, which needs to be verified. There are also very cooperative renovation and noise construction nearby. It is a Saturday morning and it is also the morning of the Mid-Autumn Festival, a statutory holiday. , the five-star hotel is actually undergoing noisy construction, and it is right next to the "restaurant". If there is one thing that can be called a restaurant, it is that breakfast is provided. . . I reported the noise from the construction to the waiter and asked why it was noisy on a weekend morning. The waiter said it might be because of the holidays. What kind of reply was this? . Can the hotel be under construction during holidays? It’s me who is ignorant! When I requested a response to the manager, the manager said it was resolved. The fact was that until I finished my meal and left, the noisy construction was still going on and the floor was still shaking. The restaurant manager made no apology at all for not solving the problem. But I don’t think this problem can’t be solved. Let’s respond directly to the noisy construction at least after breakfast. . .

The breakfast environment has a smell of oily smoke. After breakfast, the whole body smells of oily smoke. How do you visit customers? 2. The service at the front desk is extremely poor, with displeasure written all over his face, not even the front desk of the convenience hotel. After making a mistake about the reservation information, if I don't check it, it will be wrong. It's a 3-star hotel, the hotel facilities are old, and the bathroom walls are mottled and yellow, which affects the mood very much.

The lobby and corridors look great, but walking into the room was a disappoin**ent. The 1.2-meter bed feels only 1.1 meters, and the bathroom is a sliding door, facing the bed, which is very uncomfortable. The washbasin is narrow and small, and there is basically no space left when the toiletry bag is placed on it. What's worse is that the bath towel is so worn that the burrs appear; the closed floor-to-ceiling windows cannot be opened; I couldn't sleep, so I turned off the air conditioner. Check-in experience is bad.
The breakfast is average; the gym is also relatively small, there is a yoga studio next to it, but guests cannot use it.
The service attitude of the hotel staff is good.

The first impression of staying is that the light is too dim, and then it is very difficult to find the light switch. There are also rooms that are completely closed and have no windows, and the air feels very bad, often dry and stuffy. Turning the air conditioner down to the lowest temperature didn't help. Later, I called the hotel humidifier, and I still slept very uncomfortable at night, and I didn't get much rest. When I woke up the next morning, my mother had a lot of nosebleeds when she washed her face. She wiped 4 wet wipes to get it clean. Later, when I got up and washed my face, I had a little nosebleed from my nose. I felt something was wrong, so I took a photo and showed it to the hotel. Picture 1 is my nosebleed, picture 2 is after my mother's bleeding stopped. At that time, my mother bleed a lot after washing her face. I didn't take a picture, and there was still splashing on the washbasin. Picture 3. Later, the hotel asked for a check-out fee, but the hotel failed to pass the buck. Tell me about bringing your mother to such a hotel and how you would deal with such a thing.

🍃Environment: The floor in the lobby feels a bit dirty

🔔Service: When checking in, the waiter was busy with his own work. No one took the initiative to talk about which front desk. They all bowed their heads and had a cold attitude. The room service said that all the chargers were lent, and they did not take the initiative to provide solutions. The attitude was impatient. How do I know if I don't call and ask? You can record the phone and answer it automatically.

🚗 Transportation: The underground parking lot was renovated. The phone said that there was a paid parking lot nearby. Finally, there was a ground parking space at the entrance of the hotel. The fee was 100 yuan per day. Yuan's invoice (I didn't read it carefully at the time), I checked in and asked the hotel lobby why there is a charge for parking at the entrance of the hotel, and I answered that the underground garage was renovated at the entrance, which is a bit speechless.

The location is good, close to the hospital, because we have to checkout in the morning, so hurry to bed, the hotel breakfast is average, the night booked on the day, less than 800 for a big bed room + breakfast for one person, it is not expensive according to 5 stars, but the hotel really does not feel It's a five-star, I don't feel that the room is newly renovated this year by the front desk

The facilities in the room are a little outdated, but clean. There are only two small bottles of mineral water for water, and two cups of tea are used up, which is a bit inconsistent with the hotel's brand image.
Also, probably due to architectural reasons, the room has no windows that can be opened, so there is no natural wind.
Others are very good, easy to get in and out, the street downstairs is also very convenient to eat, check-in and check-out are very fast, and the reception attitude of the staff is also very good.

msg:It is also one of the wonderful hotels I have stayed in this month.
The whole attitude from check-in to everything encountered in the middle is quite profitable.
Not as good as Atour.
First, you use two mattresses to join the big bed room. I don't even dare to stand up and step on it. I don't even dare to think about it. Is there a hotel where you can put mattresses together to make a big bed room? This point was changed to me without any explanation.

Second, the hotel is not cleaned, and when you come back one night after going out, the most basic rooms are not cleaned. The hotel replied: Our room is turned on the do not disturb mode, ha ha, you know better than us whether it is turned on, find a reason to find a decent one.

For these two problems, I couldn't get through the front desk phone to contact Ctrip.

Third, the front desk phone cannot be reached. Really speechless. Why is there a telephone in the room?

Staying in Atour is better than this kind of hotel

During the epidemic, there were no restaurants in the swimming pool and gym, and the breakfast ordered was very average. It was a lunch box that was delivered. It was not worth the price.

msg:The first time you book this hotel, you need to complain about three things: 1. You feel that since the guests staying in the hotel still need to pay for parking? ? Although it is 20.00 per day, it is very surprising for the guests who stay in the hotel. Can such a big hotel not be able to subsidize the parking fees of customers? 2. The air conditioner in the room is too hot and the wind is too hot. Can we take a sauna in a high temperature day of 34 degrees? 3. The room only gave two small bottles of mineral water. I need to take two more bottles of mineral water. I was told what to charge? ? Just tell me that there is an extra charge for such a hotel? ? I am very speechless. This is the most disappointing hotel I have ever stayed in. I don&#39;t know what the charging standards of this hotel used to be, but now the business is light during the epidemic, which can best reflect the service attitude. What has this hotel done? ? ? In addition: I was staying at the hotel on my birthday. For a hotel like the service industry, I didn’t have any sensitivity and I didn’t mention any words. I’m also very disappointed that the brand of Pullman is no longer used when I choose to go out to stay in the future. Will consider it because of disappoin**ent!

msg:If it weren't for me to be particularly sentimental, I would hardly write reviews. But the experience of staying here for one night is not good. Decided to write an objective and fair evaluation:
[First talk about the advantages]
1. It seems that the rooms above the 20th floor have been renovated. The decoration of the executive room is commendable and the room is big enough.
2. The bedding is quite comfortable.
3. Powerful internet speed and convenient office work.
4. The service is generally good, and we will say hello when we meet.
[Far more shortcomings]
1. Poor soundproofing of the room
I knocked on the door next door and rang the doorbell. I thought it was my room. The voice at the door was very, very clear.
2. There is abnormal noise in the room
The pipes in the room are aging, maybe only the surface has been renovated, the lining is still too old. In the room, there will be noise similar to train passing/car passing by after a short while!
There is also a huge abnormal noise. From my check-in to the check-out, I probably heard the huge collision and deformation sound from the extremely huge pipe 6/7 times. Even after waking me up in the middle of the night, it was difficult to sleep.
3. Breakfast is average
The breakfast is really mediocre, not much variety. Tucao, more than half of the fruits are canned fruits? ? ?
4. Restaurant service is not active
Neither the executive lounge nor the cafeteria can actively ask the newly seated guests: coffee or tea? It all depends on self-help. Feeling like an invisible person. The boiling water will not be poured, and no waiter can be found to help.
5. Hot water is very slow
The shower room was very cramped, crowded with the bathtub, barely able to stand a shower.
The most surprising thing is: hot water is not hot immediately! ! ! This is not even comparable to the Express Hotel. After I was ready, I stood coldly and waited for a minute before there was hot water. This is not the level of high-end hotels!
.
In general, there must be a reason why high-end hotels are selling at low prices. This time I checked in because it was convenient to go to the hospital, and I would not consider coming again in the future. I am ashamed of the Pullman brand.

Swimming in a round swimming pool for the first time, it feels very novel. Walking to ASE is very convenient for shopping and eating, and there is no stress on subway travel.

The shortcoming was raised by the little brother (a bit yellowish) who checked in at Office 6. He was too stiff in communicating with guests. It was already 4 pm when we checked in. We dragged our suitcases with the elderly and children, but told us that there was still another one. Wait for half an hour if the room is not cleaned. Asked if there is a solution, nothing works, and it makes people feel very unfriendly. There needs to be more training in communicating with guests, especially at the checkin counter, which is the first impression for guests and the first to show the hotel. The image is really not very friendly.

The swimming pool needs to walk to the next floor after coming out of the locker room, which is not very convenient. Fortunately, it is quite large, round, and the water temperature is moderate. At 9 o'clock in the morning on Sunday, there are a bunch of children learning to swim. The round swimming pool cannot be divided into lanes, and it is inevitable that they will interfere with each other. The gym is slightly smaller, but it has all the necessary equipment.
The Jin Jiang restaurant on the ba*****t floor is super cost-effective for lunch, and Ctrip can purchase a set menu for two for only 148 yuan. Although the things are not exquisite enough, they are very cost-effective, but the waiters are not enthusiastic enough, and the ones who serve the dishes leave the dishes on the table and leave, quite the service posture of the roadside stalls.
Came here nine years ago and it was renovated and not very old. Overall it is very recommended.

msg:I booked an executive suite. The facilities in the room are quite new. The bathrooms are also equipped with automatic toilets. The sofa and bedding are also very comfortable. The TV in the living room and bedroom is very large, at least 50 inches. It’s still from Samsung, but the view is not very good, and it’s a residential building when you look out face-to-face... But in general, the hardware can’t pick out any major problems, maybe it’s just lacking in features, but after all, it is a high-end business positioning, so I think this There's nothing wrong with that style.

The deduction item is in the service, because the executive suite is on the 24th floor and has executive courtesy. If you want to go to the happy hour of the lounge, before entering the lounge, you are actually stopped by the front desk and asked for the room number. This is the tone. It seems that I am a person who does not live in a hotel, and I want to sneak into the lounge to eat... (I am speechless), since I have come to this floor, it means that I am qualified to enjoy this courtesy, so it is understandable to ask. , but the attitude is not very modest and polite, which makes me particularly unhappy... But but, the most unpleasant thing is... After I entered the lounge, I felt a little hot, and I went back to the room and put a coat... Actually, I was there again. The door was blocked, and I asked again... Good guy... Is it really okay to stay on the executive floor for such a waiter who doesn't know what to do? !

Also, okay... I've stayed in quite a few 5-star hotels... The first time I encountered a room with executive trea**ent... The mini bar is actually charged... But I can understand it, but the front desk on the ground floor, only I took the initiative to talk about the courtesy, but I didn't take the initiative to talk about the mini bar charge... Fortunately, I paid attention to the question to avoid possible follow-up problems.

The buffet is early, there are quite a lot of people, and the main tables are so close. In addition to the lack of social distancing, there is also a period of this epidemic. There are noodles, flour and the like made on the spot.

msg:We stayed as a family of two adults and two children. In order to make it easier to go to ASE and Tianzifang, we booked a business room. Because it has a two-meter large bed and extra bed service, it is convenient for four of us to live there. We arrived at the hotel at around two o'clock in the afternoon. As soon as we entered the door, a sweeping robot wiped the floor. Then we checked in as normal. Ms. Huang at the front desk warmly received us. Seeing that there were quite a few of us, she immediately upgraded us to a business suite. The room was very nice. It is large and has a panoramic view of the night view on Dapu Road. There is also a swimming pool for children to play in. This weather is also very comfortable. All in all, it was a fun trip!

The sound was very loud. It even disturbed the children’s naps for two days in a row. The hotel's snacks, a small portion of Oreo biscuits and a small portion of potato chips, are actually priced at 55, which is more than five times higher than the market price.

然而，在餐飲方面，我必須讚揚探花餐廳的服務生們。他們的服務態度非常主動，能夠及時響應並滿足我在用餐過程中的各種需求。
總體來説，雖然房間存在一些問題，但餐廳的服務質量仍然讓我對這次住宿體驗保持了一定的好感。希望酒店能夠在未來的服務中，更加註重房間的清潔和設施的維護，以提升整體的住宿體驗。

다만 라운지를 이용 했는데 먹을게 많지가 않았어요. 그냥 배고픔 때우기 정도로 생각 하시면 되요. 직원분들은 항상 친절했어요. 
수영장은 동네주민 이용도가 높아서 그런지 사람이 많았고 락커룸이 모잘랐어요.

但是【酒店系統、酒店前台業務還需培訓加強】

我自己定了商務套2晚、行政套1晚，再搭配1晚婚慶套餐送的行政套，定前都和經理溝通完畢説報名字就好了。

結果到了入住，按正常2晚行政套肯定是同一間延續把，結果當時酒店前台反饋不管名字、身份證、電話號都死活查不到婚慶送的一間，衹能先給我開1晚，
我衹能再反覆聯繫之前的經理，説之後會幫忙關聯。入住耽誤了一個多小時。

【結果】！到了第二天行政套【門卡全部失效】！第二天我是辦婚禮上上下下拿東西，2張門卡不同人拿着，來回去辦重新開通，
穿着禮服大包小包被困在門口出示了證件和前一晚照片讓路過的保潔員開下門，還説要申請等待最後也沒幫忙開，整個大狼狽。

另外行政套還要求【按金10000，一萬】，一間房間居然要一萬按金，這合理嗎，可能是我住酒店比較少，從沒遇到過。

總之【酒店系統、酒店前台業務還需培訓加強】，入住體驗非常不好。

昨天運氣很好，晚上到酒店碰到了Elsa，很和善的直接幫我們升級成了商務套房，72平空間很大，格局佈置很合理，住的還是相當舒適的～
另外一開始有點猶豫收費停車，但實際上酒店住客24小時封頂60元，附近逛商圈的時候也不用再考慮其他停車費的問題，算上房費其實性價比還不錯。

工作人員比不少5星酒店貼心，能實實在在幫解決問題，這點需要點贊。

是8.27晚一個不戴眼鏡的男前台。因為房間是別人下的訂單我沒法評價，特地翻到了我之前的入住記錄來寫點評。
