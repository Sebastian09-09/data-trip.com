msg:I rarely want to review a hotel so actively, and I was really surprised. It was really a good experience at the same price, which made this hurried trip more comfortable. The hotel is excellent in many aspects, including location, service, environment, hygiene, etc., which are all good. Overall, it exceeded expectations.
The advantages of the hotel are that in addition to better service and environment, it is also very textured and detailed. There are exclusive areas in the hotel for guests, and the privacy is OK. The hotel's facilities and color matching are not bad, simple and a**ospheric, and more textured than the pictures. The opening time is not short, but the traces of use are not very obvious. At the same time, the hotel is really detailed. Although many facilities have been improved, they are more restored to the style of the Republic of China. Many details have been restored and improved, and the spare bedding even feels a bit classical (by the way, the small fresh flower arrangement on the washstand is really detailed). The overall feeling is that the scale of restoration is good, and the overall aesthetics of the hotel is advanced. The breakfast is also OK, and the taste is slightly Chinese.
There are still some disadvantages, such as the problems that may occur after many protected buildings are converted into hotels, mainly dim lighting and limited plugs (the hotel's sound insulation feels OK, which is quite unexpected). For me, the more obvious feeling is that the hotel air conditioning noise is a bit loud and there is no desk (it is not convenient to read or use a laptop).
The lady at the front desk is also very nice and took the initiative to help upgrade the room type. I highly recommend friends who like the retro style of the Republic of China to experience it. It is more interesting, but the overall environment is relatively quiet and low-key. Friends who like bustling or convenient and efficient may not feel suitable. In short, I am quite satisfied with the overall situation and can give a high score.

There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the taste is good. The lunch and dinner in the garden restaurant are also good, without any thunder points. The service is also very good, and there is a special housekeeper to help solve various problems. Nearby is the popular bookstore on Yihe Road, which is very close and can be reached by walking. I will definitely choose to stay here when I come to Nanjing again.

Welcome fruit & snacks: Fruits and desserts are prepared, and there is also a coffee machine
Hygiene: I am still a little bit of a clean freak, but the hygiene really makes me feel at ease. The aunt who cleans the guest room is also very polite and asked me what time the room can be cleaned (young people travel mainly to sleep until the afternoon)
Environment: The surroundings are really beautiful, the suggestions of the Republic of China period, any casual shot is very good, and you can see young ladies taking pictures on the roadside outside the mansion every day
Service: I casually asked where the breakfast place is, and after two minutes, the housekeeper arranged to take me there, haha, the service is also good
I also want to say one thing: there is no ventilation in the bathroom
Overall, this stay is very comfortable

msg:It’s the first time I’ve given it all five stars, it’s really beyond expectations. The room we booked was a double bed room. On the day we arrived, they told us that we would be upgraded to a suite. I thought it was a 60-square-meter suite, but I didn't expect it to be a 75-square-meter family suite with double the price.

The bathroom is cleaned every day and is very clean. After ordering takeout from the front desk, they will take the initiative to deliver it to the room. Everyone's service is very enthusiastic, and if there is a need, it will be solved. It was very quiet and comfortable to sleep at night. The room has floor heating and air conditioning. All aspects have been thought of. It is also very comfortable to soak in the bathtub. The bathtub drains water very quickly and the water flow is very large.

This living experience is really comfortable.

There is still one area that needs to be improved, that is, this bed may have been used for a long time. The sides are high and the middle is low. It is very tiring to sleep on the sides when sleeping. But in fact, I slept very soundly. It would be perfect if this mattress was changed to a flat and firm one.

It is highly recommended that those who come to Nanjing stay here. The buildings left over from the Republic of China period are very comfortable to live in after renovation.

Breakfast is ordered, and there is no chaos during the peak time of 8 o'clock. The Western pastry area is small but exquisite, and the products are very good. It's just that the hotel chef got off work at night and relieved himself by the flower bed of the landscape pool. My bestie and I happened to see him when we returned to the room, which somewhat affected the hotel's image. At the same time, there are many tourists visiting during the day. If you open the window, you will be inadvertently entered. The small fence set up for "non-hotel guests are not allowed to enter" is useless.

msg:The hotel, which has quite the a**osphere of the Republic of China, is located next to Yihe Road, an upper-class residential area planned in Nanjing's "Capital Plan". The neighborhood is very classic and quiet, and even the street lights are completely different from those in the busy city.
The rooms in the hotel are all rooms in a certain small villa. There are more than ten villas in total, with different shapes. The layout and facilities of the rooms are also different according to local conditions. When we arrived at the hotel, we were arranged to upgrade the room and included breakfast. Very positive review.
The room is in the style of the Republic of China, and all furniture, decoration and utensils are of very good quality. It happened to be a rainy day in the depth of winter. Outside the blinds, there was lush greenery and everything. I stayed in the room and felt very peaceful.
Breakfast is an a la carte semi-buffet, and the duck blood vermicelli soup and old braised noodles are quite good.
The transportation is relatively convenient, and it is easy to take a taxi to anywhere in Nanjing.
If I come to Nanjing next time, I hope to experience a different building.

When I checked in, I took the initiative to upgrade the room type and provide needed items at any time. The service in the restaurant was also very polite and thoughtful. There are endless free drinks, fruits, and snacks in the room. The macarons probably come from the hotel's French restaurant, and they are very delicious. The furniture is in the style of the Republic of China, and the cups and cups are all made of celadon, which is elegant and elegant. All the toiletries are made of high-quality materials and are very comfortable. Breakfast is served in the hotel's Wanguochun Garden Restaurant, which is semi-buffet style. Both Chinese and Western pastries are provided. What's especially rare is that both are very authentic and have the characteristics of the Republic of China. Travelers who love the experience of the Republic of China cannot miss it and it is highly recommended.

The room is large, and although the decoration is a bit dated, it is still very warm. It is a small building with a period feel that we like.
The service is very considerate and the butler is responsive to all requests. It was already early in the morning when we arrived. The butler greeted us outside the lobby and quickly helped us check in and sent us to the room. Because we have a need for frozen breast milk, housekeepers shuttle through the park to help us transport breast milk over and over again in the cold winter.
Breakfast is delicious, braised pork noodles and duck blood vermicelli soup are highly recommended

The disadvantage is that the toilet in the bathroom should be of a higher quality and the bathtub should be equipped with a disposable cover.

The toilet, shower, and washbasin were all independent, and there were two washbasins. Two people stayed there without having to fight for the washbasin. The main purpose of going to the Summer Palace is to experience the style of the Republic of China. The surrounding environment is very green, and they are all buildings from the Republic of China period, which is very nostalgic. Service is so good as always. The Chinese rice is especially worthy of praise, and the crispy pork ribs recommended by three thumbs are indeed delicious. One thing I hope is that the red plum tree within the mansion area will not be blocked by other trees and ****s. It is a very good scenery.

Welcome fruits & snacks: No photos taken, the containers are very beautiful. The dim sum was Western style, so I was disappointed. I thought it would be Chinese style dim sum.

Breakfast: The traditional delicacies on the menu, such as duck blood vermicelli, smoked fish noodles, and small wontons, all taste pretty good and above the passing mark. The overall taste is okay, but the variety is not rich enough, and the overall restaurant operation is substandard. Looking forward to improvement.

msg:It can be said that this trip to Nanjing was a pleasant surprise. I didn't know much about the Yihe Mansion before I went there. I was just interested in this villa in the Republic of China and wanted to learn more about it. I learned from the Internet that this boutique hotel seemed to be here, but I didn't find much information, so I decided to stay for one night to try it out. We stayed in a twin room 182. The room was very large, basically the largest single room I have ever stayed in. The decoration was also antique, and the outside of the villa was also very impressive. I found a book introducing the 12th block on the table, so I followed this book to learn about the history of the Republic of China from the houses. There are a total of 22 old houses here, and there are far fewer houses that are actually used as accommodation. Because I was particularly interested in these houses and the books introduced, the hotel staff also gave us the book and took us to visit the exhibition introducing the renovation of this project, as well as the cheongsam exhibition, the food exhibition, and the Anti-Japanese War exhibition, and learned a lot. Our room rate includes a buffet breakfast, including Chinese and Western styles. We only ate less than half of the options (Chinese), and the taste was still good. The hotel also has a Western restaurant. Friends who don't live in the hotel can also come to the Chinese and Western restaurants for dinner and walk around to feel it, but the full experience requires staying. The streets outside the hotel are also quite interesting. I saw teachers and many children sketching on the streets. I have recommended it to many friends after leaving Nanjing. The disadvantages are not really disadvantages. The hotel is open during the day. Some residents from the surrounding area come to visit and take photos during the weekend. But it is still very quiet in the morning and evening. In fact, it is good to be open so that more people can understand the history. By the way, there was a wedding on the day we stayed.

Disadvantage: The biggest feeling is that it does not achieve the privacy that this price should have. There is no exclusive area for residents in the entire park. Everything is open to the public and everyone can reach the downstairs. However, the glass door of the second-floor balcony cannot be locked. What is the difference between this and sleeping with the door open at night? Furthermore, although breakfast is semi-buffet style, it still feels a bit perfunctory.

msg:The hotel area consisting of about 20 Republican garden houses is indeed beautiful. The garden is full of sweet-scented osmanthus, which is very suitable for walking and taking pictures. But for guests staying at this price, the only highlight that can be found is the environment. There are many flaws in the check-in experience. Simply put, it is a hotel that has been in operation for ten years, but lacks details and management. Professionalism. I sincerely recommend that it is enough to check in and take photos. You don’t have to pay a high price to stay.

Facilities: It has been in business for ten years, and the room furnishings are also in the style of the Republic of China. The old facilities are nothing. But there is no way to clean the visible old stains on the seats, bedside stools, and remote control boxes; there is also a lot of dust on the carpet next to the bed...

Hygiene: You can imagine that the cleaning is very perfunctory. There are spider silk on the shower head in the bathroom, and there are hairs in the porcelain jars containing toiletries (if hygiene cannot be guaranteed, don’t force style and environmental protection); all suede items There were old dust on the coffee machine; there were many black spots in the kettle of the coffee machine. We poured out the filled water, but the waiter ignored the dirt and continued to fill it up.

Environment: The environment is indeed full of the style of the Republic of China, but because of this, many tourists enter the hotel area during holidays to visit and take pictures. As a tourist, I can understand it, but it is very speechless to see people taking pictures and making noise at the door before I get up in the morning. Okay... It is recommended that the hotel appropriately adjust the opening hours and remind guests when checking in.

Service: The service from the guest rooms to the restaurant is full of omissions, making it difficult to believe that it has been in business for ten years, highlighting the mismatch between service quality and price, and the so-called characteristics of the Republic of China.

      Breakfast is semi-buffet style, there are not many choices of ready-made food, and the speed of ordering is relatively slow. There was a tall, fat guy in the restaurant who had a very good service attitude. One morning when it rained, we took a taxi to the scenic spot and no one took our order. We had to take the bus. When the guy found out, he told us that it would be more convenient to go through the door next to the restaurant. , came out to open the door for us later, which was really convenient. The bus stop was right when we came out, which saved us a lot of time.
      The location of the hotel is also good. It is convenient to go to most attractions. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Nanjing.

Service: The service attitude of the hotel is very enthusiastic. The little girl named Huang Yue at the front desk is also very patient. She serves with a smile all the way, which makes people feel very comfortable.
The breakfast category is also quite rich, and the taste is also good. I like this hotel very much. I will continue to consider it in the future

I really love this kind of small bungalow-style hotel. These houses still retain the original layout, and the interior and exterior have been carefully repaired. For these houses, time seems to be effective. Standing in its Under the eaves, we have a more real basis for our memories of the past and prying into history

msg:It can only be said that it is an Internet celebrity hotel. It is recommended not to stay. The environment is not good, the location is remote, the service attitude is also very poor, and the hygiene is not good (there is no clear price for a laundry bag, and it is charged 180 yuan after taking it away)
1. The environment is not good - the facilities are old and there is a musty smell as soon as you enter the room. There are two floors in a building. We stayed on the first floor. Residents on the second floor could hear clearly going up and down the stairs. The sound insulation effect was very poor. The room The gate is facing the entrance door of the single-family house, so there is no privacy. A hotel with a price exceeding five stars does not use a smart door lock. You have to use a key to open it when entering and exiting, and you have to lock it yourself when leaving.
2. Remote location - the door number of the mansion is not conspicuous, and the instructions at the door are not clear, causing trouble to guests. There are few restaurants nearby and there are many mosquitoes. After waiting for a few minutes for the bus, I was covered with mosquito bites.
3. Poor service attitude - I can only say that there is no service experience. I called the housekeeper to deliver a few bottles of water, and the answer was like a mosquito. She hung up before I could finish the sentence. The water bottle that was delivered was full of sand.
4. Poor hygiene - only one set of toiletries is provided in the room, the table is covered with dust, the refrigerator in the room is not cooling, and the body lotion provided is the same one used by the previous resident, which was squeezed onto the table and not cleaned
Finally, I would like to say that I have never seen any hotels that charge for laundry bags, and they keep saying that they are custom-made (I don’t see where it looks custom-made). If it is not a gift, please indicate it, instead of telling me afterwards that you want it. There is a fee and a laundry bag costs 180. The day before yesterday, I stayed at the Mustard Garden Hotel, which is also under the Yihe brand. They did not charge for printing their own brand on the laundry bags, and the bags that they need to charge for will have a bookmark with the price on the side. , if it is not a gift, please tell your hotel the price!

The water in the shower head is very small. Fortunately, it is early summer. In winter, it will freeze to death. The disposable utensils are of very high quality. Poor, not worth half the price! The only highlight is the breakfast, both the service and quality are pretty good! You can stay elsewhere and pay for breakfast. But the dinner at the Chinese restaurant Wan Guochun was not good. It cost more than 500 for 2 people. The service and dishes were so so.

The decoration is also the style of the Republic of China, which is very transcendent. The butler service is very considerate. The catch is that it is semi-buffet in the morning and the variety is a bit small. In addition, since the distance between each house is relatively small, the privacy is not very good.

msg:Back in Nanjing, he lived in an old house with a century-old history of the Republic of China. The spacious living room and corridor are full of the charm of the old times, and the low-key and elegant courtyard gives people tranquility. The silky linen pajamas that were popular in the old society, Iranian green marble, parquet floors, geometric patterned carpets, and French shutters are ancient, but clean and solemn. I think the owners who have lived in this house should be kind and virtuous people, and the energy field left by people can be sensed.

The old residences of the famous anti-Japanese war hero Xue Yue, Chen Bui, Yang Gongda, and other old residences, and twenty-six buildings in the Republic of China. A Yihe Road, half of the history of the Republic of China. The character of Nanjing is here. It is a kind of quietness and coldness that is not keen on noise and blindly follow the smoke.

The hanging vines, the luxuriant flowers and trees, it rained heavily in the afternoon, and the rain poured down from the tiles, and the towering trees could be shaded or noisy, making people distracted, thinking far away, but there is a deep feeling in my heart. The tranquility of the city, and the feeling of it makes people fall into the deep seclusion of history. Waiting temporarily on the terrace of the room, as if you were in a complex and silent time node that was far away. For these houses, standing under its eaves, our memories of the past and the prying of history, seem to have the most true basis and path.

Five-star service, responsive. Will choose next time.

前台服務挺好的，因為隔音問題沒睡好，前台表示抱歉還送了小禮物。但管家就有點……問問題沒有熱情迴應，略顯冷淡了。
因為是老房子，建議睡眠不好的，帶上耳塞。不然樓上住客上上下下樓梯，聲音有點大，影響睡眠。
還有就是早餐是半點單半自助的，口味還不錯，但選擇上略少。

msg:1. 位置：門口有公交站，還算方便。
2. 私隱/安全性：在民國建築羣區，會有很多遊客參觀，住客區域的標識不夠明顯。
3. 電梯：樓裏沒有電梯……帶大箱子or重箱子的可以再考慮一下，雖然工作人員可以幫忙搬運。
4. 設施：基本的都有；有些設施受限於年代或其他條件有點老舊；洗漱台旁有小凳子；衞生間地板有點滑。
5. 服務：管家服務很及時，但是大多時候會覺得沒必要麻煩管家。整體服務專業度可以再考慮一下。
6. 餐廳：早餐廳（花園餐廳）種類較少，但是味道還可以。中菜館（願夏廬）相對普通。
7. 衞生：會幫忙拉開紗窗門、打開簾子，會及時補齊備品和水，會每天提供水果和甜點，還可以。

老式風格的地板地毯百葉窗鑰匙都令人欣喜，早餐的精緻也是亮點。江蘇路頤和路寧海路牯嶺路本身就是民國建築的集中區域，然後就可以在小區裏散步並看看你的鄰居是哪位民國政要。

還有一個體驗非常好的地方就是前台服務人員和管家説話都是語速慢、聲調輕、語音柔和。在國內酒店裡同時符合這三條的印象中也就一到兩次。

服務：管家Eileen張小姐，温柔親切，回覆及時貼心！下次再來繼續選擇頤和公館！

plus，文化館是有閉館日的，有意願的朋友建議提前電話諮詢。

説説優點，就是環境很好。其他與星級酒店相比，就沒什麼優點了。

我先説這次退房之前的服務很好，沒毛病。但退房離開之後接到酒店電話，説肥皂碟沒了，讓我們看看是不是在我們這。我就納悶了…我帶走肥皂碟幹嘛？讓我們找這是什麼個意思？什麼意思？最後打電話過去，他們告訴我找到了肥皂碟，但是缺了個口，需要從按金里扣98。

缺點，房間太暗了，白天打開所有燈，給孩子講繪本，看着都費勁！另外進門就是床，特別不方便！另外就是白天遊客太多，總是好奇的從窗户，從門張望，都要走進來！私隱好差！
另外就是，洗手間沐浴露洗髮水，都在小瓷瓶子裏，用手去拿，取不出來，要倒，可是一倒就會有一些流瓶子壁上，就會很滑！不小心就摔了，瓷瓶子掉地上就摔碎了！退房的時候，我提醒他們，摔碎了瓶子，收拾時，不要受傷！竟然要我們賠瓶子！我説太好笑了，我還沒説劃傷我的腳！前台態度特別不好，真的很過份！

因為經常出差，並喜愛在國內外了旅遊，住過眾多的五星級酒店精品民宿，比較起來，這裏的硬件設施也是很棒的，尤其是床墊和枕頭簡直太舒服了。
這裏不僅環境優美寧靜，服務也好，管家、保潔都很熱情，尤其是經理張靈芝，太貼心了，有求必應，因為喜歡房間裏的小物件，她竟然送了我留念…
南京有着六朝古韻，一年四季的花季和風景，值得細細品味，我還會來的，還會住在這裏。

順便推薦一下先鋒書店，真的很酷，要去打卡哦。

缺點:交通不是很方便，地下停車場太小了。行李箱衹能從車庫入口提上去。房間內有蚊子。保潔提供毛巾時直接用手抓着，説實話比較難接受，推薦找個箱子或者推車，至少給人一些乾淨衞生的感覺。此外圖中那個小桌子是室內唯一可以擺放外賣的地方，並且有點小。到了晚上車庫外大門會關，需要摁喇叭叫門衞。
優點:房間裝修風格很喜歡。做了房型的升級。房間迎賓水果都比較好吃，不像有的酒店香蕉是夾生的。外賣可以送到房間門口。可以隨便抽煙。户外風景也好，還有小貓可擼。
總的來説優點大於缺點。但缺點中衹有停車場一個硬傷，其他都是可以優化的。
説實話有點回家的感覺，因為自住別墅。雖然我提了很多問題，但總體感受還是比較舒適的。不同以往那些高樓大廈裏的酒店一樣，在這裡有點難感受到需求的迅速回饋。

能看到花園景，除了蚊蟲多一點外，找不出其他可以挑剔的地方！早餐廳環境優雅簡潔，種類豐富且可口，最重要的是還支持外帶回客房享用！客服服務態度5⃣️🌟，入住時不僅悉心介紹民國館的人文歷史，也為我們入住提供了相當多的便利。唯一的遺憾是房間裝修較老，缺乏當下的智能設備，沒有電子投屏，也沒usb或者typeC充電接口，希望下次裝修時可以升級一下！tips：酒店周圍有個建築工地在施工，因為天氣炎熱，施工時間是4點到清晨。雖然房間隔音很好，但睡眠淺的旅客近期想入住時需提前考慮一下～

1.因為是歷史建築，可以安排一位人員對入住的客人有一個專門的介紹；
2.早餐可以為客人免費送到房間；
3.晚上沒有夜床服務；
4.公館門牌因為不顯眼，沒有放特別的指示牌，或者專人在門口引領，給客人造成困擾，不知道是從哪裡進入。
整體來説，除了是歷史建築，其他沒有可圈可點之處。

msg:交通位置：十年前在這一帶生活過，交通非常便利。步行10分鐘就是省委一條路北京西路，附近的頤和路、莫幹路、赤壁路，牯嶺路安謐幽靜都值得一走，隔壁寧海路，西橋煙火氣息濃郁。

出行停車：酒店很低調，沒有特別的門楣，江蘇路寧海路都是單行線我繞了兩圈打了電話才知道大門所在，有自己的停車場，入住報車號自動錄入，離開時無需登記自動抬桿。

硬件軟件：酒店入住時免費升級，住的似乎是5號樓汪鵬故居，這個就不多説了😂房間環境還是比較滿意的，不臨街非常安靜。這個樓的房間户型設施對於我來説是很喜歡的，幾個點：
1、獨立入户門，入樓見梯上樓見廊廳，左手入卧室右手入盥洗室，盥洗室和卧室同樣面積；裝修風格簡約，色調和石材花色，復古花灑水龍頭都是我比較喜歡的元素。

2，沒有軟裝窗簾，遮光遮私都是木質百葉。酒店的窗簾衞生一直是我心裏的一個點，我很喜歡這裏的木質百葉，方便開合。卧室的百葉也無需擔心遮光問題，酒店在百葉後面還做了電動升降簾蔽光。

3、盥洗室空間非常大，乾濕分離。濕區空間也大，有寬闊的坐區。

4、管家細心熱心。入住和離開時都會在前台小樓前等候指引。頤和公館區參觀最好提前預約，現在衹有四個館可以參觀，平時都是關閉狀態，普通清潔人員在內，搞不清狀況讓我一度想放棄參觀，聯繫了管家很快安排了妹子全程帶着參觀解説。

5、早餐方面，不是全開放自助式。住了兩晚，週日是小自助+零點，週一是零點。小自助主要是些熱飲和沙拉吐司蛋糕。零點包括中式和西式，鴨血粉絲小籠包蒸餃餛飩麪條粥，西式就是各種蛋餅類。對於我來説，即便酒店早餐再豐盛繁多，吃的也就是那幾樣，所以我是滿意的，因為口味很合。

我特別注意了這兩天早餐的服務生，擺放收拾餐具都幾乎沒有聲音，説話語速聲調輕柔緩和很得體，感謝。

最後吐槽一下不太滿意的地方：
1、咖啡膠囊第一天用完兩衹，第二天續住的時候發現沒有及時補充，當然我相信我打服務中心他們還是會送過來的但是後面打岔弄忘了第二天一早就衹好用一個膠囊。

2、馬桶復古，但是座高對我普通個子165很不友好，坐下衹能雙腳點地….還好卧室有一張放拖鞋的小踏步板，但是….短腿人感到不舒適。

3、花灑水壓一般。談不上小，但是真的就…一般。不知道是不是衹有我一個人這麼覺得。

希望改進，因為喜歡。
