msg:This hotel is not worthy of a five-star rating. The room conditions are very poor, very small, the room type is not straight, the wall facing the window is very slanted, and we booked a room with Tianshan view, which is not facing Tianshan. We need to tilt our head to look out the window, and Tianshan is very far away. The staying experience is very poor, and it is definitely not worthy of the price of more than 900 yuan a night. We changed to other hotels after staying for one day.

I was so angry that I reported it to the Urumqi Taxation Bureau. They immediately opened the account after I reported it. In the end, it's just a hotel with not very good business.

The air-conditioning was not turned on in the room, and the fresh air system was not turned on. The water supply was also very slow. I had to call to remind you. It did not meet the five-star service and standards. There were no commercial facilities next to the hotel. Can order takeaway. The price is 1,200. It’s not worth it. It’s definitely not worth it. I don’t recommend staying here! The picture shows that after changing rooms, I felt very stuffy. When hotel staff came over, the room had large cylindrical pillars! I rarely review hotels. This time I felt depressed. I would like to remind future guests not to make the same mistake as me again! !

msg:This hotel has been the worst hotel experience in recent years. During this long trip to the Western Regions, I stayed in many hotels and had a good experience. Because a friend booked here, I also booked here. Although the Four Points by Sheraton was sold at Sheraton prices, considering it was a new hotel, we still expected a first-class stay experience, but we were greatly disappointed.
Hotel check-in assigned room. When I entered the room, I saw that the window was only about 70 centimeters wide and could not be opened. As a Ctrip Five Diamond hotel, there was only one chair, a small round table and no sofa in the entire room. What's even weirder is that the bathroom door is designed to be translucent, and the bathroom door and bathroom window are both made of glass, so that the room is always illuminated by outside light in the middle of the night. Considering that we were just a way, we tolerated it and didn’t ask to change rooms. Then comes the more exciting part:
We turned off the lights at 10 o'clock and had just fallen asleep. At 10:36, the downlight near the door turned on automatically. Pressing any button had no effect. We tried different combinations, but the light went out inexplicably again. When I was about to fall asleep again at 12 o'clock, the neighbor probably came back. The water pipe system made a huge noise, which woke me up again. I called the front desk in the middle of the night to complain. They also admitted that the hotel's sound insulation was not good. In the next two hours or so, you can hear different levels of noise not only from next door, but also from the next door to the next door, and from the water pipes upstairs and downstairs. Coupled with the sound of guests talking in the corridor, it's probably around 2 o'clock in the night. Got some sleep at five o'clock. What a nigh**are experience. In comparison, the decoration smell of the new hotel, the shower gel disappearing halfway through the shower, and the unpalatable buffet dinner are no longer a problem. A hotel loses its most important value if its guests cannot have a good rest.
I was originally going to stay for two nights, but when I woke up early in the morning, I canceled my reservation for the next day, checked out, and left. Changed to a normal hotel, with normal windows and sofas, normal soundproofing and facilities. Goodbye Sheraton hotels from now on.

We agreed to repair it the next day. Finally, we left the hotel and no one came to inquire or arrange this! We booked for two days. First of all, the service was so bad that it was disappointing. There was no one to greet us when we checked in. The four people at the front desk were doing their own thing. We asked many times but no one answered us. In the end, we were a little anxious and there was an internship receptionist. The business was very Unskilled, it took a long time to verify the room I stayed in with another person, and it took more than half an hour to check in. There is no doorman or greeter in the hotel, and everyone in suits and uniforms feels cold and arrogant. Instead, the aunt who cleans the room provides service. The terminology and operation are very standardized. The floor of the room is uneven and the seams are warped. The hotel, which has been newly opened for more than ten days, does not have a smart toilet or electric curtains (actually, it doesn't matter if you take it or not). All in all, I am very disappointed, especially in terms of service! It's just that the environment is not bad. I complained later, but the Urumqi Consumers Association was very responsible and carried out follow-up inspections, and the hotel contacted me in time. However, I still have to give a negative review. I hope the hotel will strengthen its management and not ruin the name of Sheraton!

Because I stayed there many times, manager Ma at the front desk called me specifically to ask about my room requirements. There was only one request: that it not be too hot. After arriving at the hotel, I was assigned a room with a shaded side, which felt pretty good. The room also came with an ice bucket and juice. I'm really attentive. In addition, Manager Ma's smiling service during check-in made me relax a lot when I was tired. Very Nice! ! ! 👍👍👍👍👍

I have stayed in a hotel twice and I have never stayed in such a hot hotel. The room temperature is 30 degrees Celsius. The coolest temperature is 27-28 degrees Celsius with the windows open overnight. The air conditioning is turned off by the hotel. The windows can be opened just a crack. There is no draft in the hallway when the door is opened. At this temperature, everyone would be unable to sleep because of the heat.
When ordering takeout, there was no one or robot delivering it. I asked the front desk, and the front desk said there was no concierge and I had to go downstairs to pick it up myself.

msg:Really very satisfied. The leaders were welcomed to check into the hotel. The hotel has a very good sense of design. The bedding in the room is very comfortable, clean, safe and reliable. Although it is newly opened, the room does not smell new. KEVIN's service at the front desk is very good. You can contact him anytime if you have anything. He also asked about your stay when you left the hotel. It's great. The hotel is next to the hospital and Wuyue Plaza. Shopping is convenient. There are many delicious snacks to meet all your needs. Super awesome, highly recommended!!!
