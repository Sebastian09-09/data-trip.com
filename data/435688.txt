msg:From the moment we got to this hotel in Chengdu, it was clear our hopes were going to be far exceeded. This hotel was the third out of five we stayed in during our trip across China. Despite its good price, it became a top highlight of our journey. It perfectly mixed value, location, cleanliness, and amazing service into one great experience.

Every staff member we met, from the friendly porter who welcomed us, to the receptionists who checked us in smoothly, and the hardworking cleaning team, made us feel a real sense of warm hospitality that's rare to find. They were all so kind and paid attention to little details, making us feel very special and looked after the whole time.

What really stood out was the kindness of the cleaning service. After we washed our clothes and left them drying in the bathroom, we came back to find that the cleaning person had kindly brought in a rack for our clothes and arranged them to dry better. This act of kindness touched us deeply and showed how much the staff does to look after their guests.

The room service was also a highlight, with lots of tasty options that were better than we expected from hotel food. Every meal was enjoyable, adding extra comfort to our stay.

Our room, high up in the building, had an amazing view of Chengdu, making our stay even better with beautiful views of the city, like the nearby Anshun Bridge. Even though we asked for a smoking room, the air in our room was still fresh thanks to a great ventilation system.

The hotel's spot was also very handy. With a metro station close by that goes straight to Chengdu East Station and the Anshun Bridge not far away, getting around the city was easy.

Adding to our positive experience, it was a pleasant surprise to find that some of the staff could speak some English, which we hadn't found in other hotels. Plus, the hotel had a cool robot service which was really interesting. The lobby and hotel grounds were incredible, too. And the breakfast was AMAZING – so varied, with a mix of Western and Eastern food choices.

To sum it up, this hotel is a real hidden treasure in Chengdu. It brings together a great price with top service, cleanliness, and location, making it a perfect pick for travelers. The wonderful hospitality and kind actions we saw have made a big impression on us, promising that this hotel will be our top choice when we come back to the city. A big thank you to the whole team for making our stay unforgettable.

The room is spacious and clean. Good sound proof wall. The view from my room, 39th floor, is nice. No cigarette smell. Bed is comfy and water pressure is just right. The pool and gym looks nice as well but I didn’t use them. Chinese and western breakfast is great! Overall service of front desk, housekeeping and breakfast restaurant are EXCELLENT!

msg:Last night's stay was perfect. This hotel is located in the bustling Chunxi Road business district of Chengdu. It has a strategic location and only takes a few minutes' walk to the subway station, making travel extremely convenient. The hotel's service is even more impressive. The staff are warm and thoughtful, and their service attitude is friendly, which made me feel at home.
The interior of the room is elegantly decorated, clean and tidy, the beds are soft and comfortable, and it is equipped with complete facilities and equipment to ensure a high-quality accommodation experience. What's even more surprising is that there are a wealth of dining options around the hotel. Downstairs are a dazzling array of shops and restaurants. Chengdu's specialties are within reach, allowing people to enjoy a gourmet journey.
The check-out process was equally efficient and convenient, without any cumbersome procedures, allowing me to end my stay with ease and pleasure. Based on the above, I strongly recommend this hotel to everyone who plans to travel to Chengdu. I believe it will become an important highlight of your wonderful trip.

We went back to the hotel to rest every night after playing, and we could sleep until we woke up naturally. The floor-to-ceiling windows in the room are very good. Looking out, you can see a wide 180-degree view. I feel very sunny every morning when I wake up, and I can enjoy the beautiful night view of Chengdu every night! The bedding provided in the room is soft and comfortable, which is very important! This ensures that our travelers have high-quality sleep every night. Moreover, this hotel is adjacent to Chunxi Road Pedestrian Street. When we checked out, we put our luggage in the concierge depar**ent of the lobby on the first floor (this hotel still provides free luggage storage service after guests check out), and then went to visit Daci Temple in Taikoo Li, Chengdu. Since we didn't have to bring luggage, we felt relaxed and had a teahouse in Daci Temple without worries. Moreover, this hotel is just on the east side of Chunxi Road. It feels like "one step away" to walk back from Daci Temple to get the luggage. The hotel service was also very considerate and thoughtful. Xiao Song from the concierge helped us carry our heavy luggage to the taxi to the airport. Later, the hotel housekeeper Nora contacted us to understand our experience of this stay. In short, this hotel has complete facilities and equipment. It not only has Chinese and Western restaurants, but also a heated swimming pool. Next time we have the opportunity to come to Chengdu again, we will choose to stay at this hotel! Goodbye, Chengdu!

It is a 10-15 minute walk from Taikoo Li shopping district and next to it. It is at the intersection of Old Changjie Street, so the street where you eat is just behind it. You don't have to worry about eating here, which is cheaper and more authentic than on Chunxi Road. Before checking into the hotel, the housekeeper will contact you in advance to ask you about your check-in requirements. The room given after check-in has also been upgraded. It is a very standard star hotel with relatively new facilities. The room is also clean. The cleaning lady is very polite and proactive. Mineral water is provided and the big bed is very comfortable. Breakfast also meets star hotel standards. Overall it's a great value and I will stay here next time.

msg:It can be regarded as a quiet hotel in the middle of the bustle, not far from Chunxi Road, ifs, and Jiuyan Bridge. I checked in on New Year's Day and stayed in an executive king room for four nights in total. Unfortunately, I only had time to enjoy the afternoon tea on the day I checked in. I spent the rest of the time playing outside and came back past eight o'clock. The breakfast was okay. The scenery was nice and you could see the TV Tower. One day, because I was leaving early and chartered a car to see Huahua and Sanxingdui, I had breakfast delivered to the room. I didn’t give full marks because the hotel is a bit old, the room has a bit of a smell, and the shower hook and toilet flush button are not very flexible…

msg:I have known about this hotel for a long time, but I have a habit that may not be very good. Once I find a hotel that I am satisfied with in every city I go to, I rarely change hotels again, so every time I go to Chengdu these years I used to live in the Crown Palace. This time, I decided to go from Luzhou to Chengdu for some urgent matters, and the hotel was the closest to the office, so I boldly changed my previous choice. Although it is my first time to stay in this hotel, the environment of this hotel is gorgeous and elegant. The service staff and service butlers are responsible, enthusiastic, considerate and well-proportioned in their service attitude. The equipment and facilities are complete and comfortable. The rooms are spacious and bright. At night, you can see the floor-to-ceiling windows in the room. You’ll have the opportunity to view the night view of the city or take photos to check in. The night view of Jiuyan Bridge can be overlooked with just one glance, and Taikoo Li on Chunxi Road is just in front of you... It’s really a time of perfection due to change. Accommodation experience! From now on, when I go to Chengdu, I will have another place where I can feel at ease!

It would have been perfect when new! However, the overhead nozzle in the shower room is very broken. When using it, cold water keeps coming out of one hole for a long time. That is to say, hot water comes out of other holes but cold water continues to flow through that hole. Normally, as soon as the valve is changed, the water comes out immediately. Water of the same temperature will flow down from the top, but after waiting for a long time, cold water still comes out of the hole and the amount is not small. Don't understand why. The speaker of the TV is also weird. The sound is so broken that it feels like I bought a fake without using original parts.
Cleanliness: Still a little disappointed, there is a matchstick with earwax under the bathtub faucet
Environment: The environment outside is very good, but the smell of smoke inside is very strong. I guess the guy in front is a heavy smoker.
Service: Did not feel enthusiastic. I called twice but didn't receive any calls. When I called back, no one answered.

msg:Hygiene: There are many guests for breakfast, the service staff changes the tableware in a hurry, the tableware is not clean, and the management arrangement is not efficient. The flow of people should be restricted at regular intervals to ensure that the order of the dining area is reasonable and orderly. Afternoon tea in the lobby bar is terrible. It is self-service and has no hygiene control. The snacks look like leftovers from breakfast. Some cakes and desserts are broken. There is no dedicated maintenance management and single table arrangement.

The management level is far from that of a branded five-star hotel. It is estimated that the salary income of front-line staff is not high and the quality is uneven.

Environment: The maintenance is relatively good, almost the same as when it first opened 10 years ago. The decoration design is still outdated, and it is not cost-effective compared with new hotels in high-tech zones.

Service: The aunties in the guest room area are active and enthusiastic, and the service is perfect and professional.

It is very convenient to Chunxi Road and Jiuyan Bridge. The room is also very clean and the service is very good. The lobby and breakfast are both on the 33rd floor. The view is very good and you can see the TV Tower. The hotel also considers that tourists going to scenic spots leave early. Breakfast is served at 6:30, with a variety of varieties and freshly squeezed juices. Children like it very much. Highly recommend to friends to stay!

msg:1. Good location. Near Chunxi Road, a few minutes walk from the subway station (Exit C of Dongmen Bridge) 2. The hotel is very good, the service is good and it is high-end. The lobby is on the 33rd floor. We stayed in an executive room on the 45th floor. The view on the same floor as breakfast was great. 3. Dining is convenient. The hotel has its own food delivery service to the room, and you can also take out food. The robot delivers it to the door or at the shopping mall near the snack street around the hotel. Remember to have a low bench hot pot in Tianfu Red Square🍲 4. Surrounding attractions: Jiuyan Bridge, Sichuan Science and Technology Museum, Chengdu Museums are nearby
I stayed here from the 3rd to the 6th day of the Chinese New Year. My mood is the most important thing. It’s pretty good. My kids said I’d give it full marks💯

The hotel's underground parking lot is quite crowded, there may be too many cars and there are few parking spaces. When I entered the lobby to check in, there happened to be a beautiful woman next to me who was holding a Chinese New Year lantern riddle game. Each of the children was rewarded with a candied haws. The young lady was quite patient with the children. I chose to have a buffet at the hotel for New Year's Eve dinner. I was very satisfied and happy to spend it in such an a**osphere. I am grateful to the hotel's service staff who are also very enthusiastic. The hotel's festive decoration is very good, and the New Year a**osphere is also very good, which makes us who are celebrating the New Year outside feel very warm.

The facilities are worthy of a star hotel, and the service is even better. When the waiter was cleaning the room, he saw that we (with two children) had a lot of clothes to change, so he took the initiative to bring us a clothes drying rack and a few extra bottles of water. We were very polite when entering and leaving. When we checked out, we discovered that we had lost a room card. The front desk reassured us that it was okay. If we had gone to another hotel, we would have had to pay extra.

The breakfast was good, but I had to catch a train on the last day. The breakfast I helped pack was really hard to describe and tasted terrible. . .
The hotel's entrance is so far away that the driver can't find it. You need to take a taxi from Chunxi Road.

However, when we found a seat and sat down by ourselves, After a while, another guest came to share a table with us, and we were not informed at all in advance. This was the first time we encountered such a speechless situation in a five-star hotel. Those who didn't know it thought they were staying there. It's an express hotel.

msg:What a great stay this time! ! The staff are so welcoming and lovely! ! Especially the serving lady, she smiled so sweetly! Then this time I went to experience the hotel’s Nanchong rice noodles. The taste was very good, and the western restaurant also started to arrange New Year’s activities, which were very beautiful! ! Equipment and facilities are abundant! I like this place so much that I will stay here again when I come to Chengdu in the future!

The lobby is on the 33rd floor, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking most of the city. There is also hot tea available for self-service in the lobby, which is really nice👍

msg:The hotel is in a good location. It is about one kilometer from Taikoo Li and Chunxi Road. It takes about 15 minutes to walk there. There are many places to eat around. The hotel lobby is on the 33rd floor. The floors below should be office buildings. The doormen at the hotel are very young. There is no service or anything like that. There is no one to help with luggage or greetings after getting off the bus. I wonder what the point of the hotel putting so many young people at the door is? Every time they passed by the lobby, they were talking and laughing. The attitude of the hotel front desk and restaurant staff was quite good. The room was quite decent and not very big. There were too many snacks, drinks and other things sold in the room, which made me feel very bad. The rice noodles that were given for afternoon tea had to wait a long time to be cooked. The taste and appearance are not flattering. It was just a gimmick for hotel promotion. The breakfast was good, especially the rice noodles. The bad thing was that I booked the same room on Ctrip for 640. It was a lot, but after checking out, it was only over 540, which was a huge difference, mainly because it was not a holiday. In addition, I asked the staff that all the rooms in their house have the same decoration, equipment and facilities. The only difference is that the room price is determined by the floor level. So the room upgrade also means moving up a floor, but the lowest room in this hotel is also on the 34th floor!

It's on the 42nd floor and has a nice view, but it was a pity that it was cloudy when we went there. Breakfast is also quite rich, beef noodles and mutton soup are good. The butler in the suite was nice. He turned on the heater in the room in advance, and the indoor temperature was just right. He even offered red date and ginger tea in the evening. My husband happened to have a cold. The housekeeper is very considerate. There are special toiletries for children. Two bedrooms, two bathrooms. The hotel has free parking, and there are many small restaurants around, all of which taste good. Very good hotel experience.

The only drawback is that if you drive, the hotel parking space guidance is not very clear after entering the parking lot.

msg:The hotel's environment, facilities, and hygiene are not bad. All negative comments should be directed to the last step of the front desk service. I have stayed in so many hotels around the world, and this is the first time I have seen such service. It was a great four days of traveling to Chengdu, but all the good mood was lost when I finally picked up my luggage. I checked my luggage this morning and promised to pick it up at 4pm, but the staff didn't give me a luggage tag. When I checked out, another staff member said I would leave my luggage at the concierge on the first floor for pick-up later. I went to the concierge to pick up my luggage in the afternoon. The concierge staff communicated with the front desk for a long time. The result was that they didn't know where the luggage was and asked me to go upstairs to the front desk by myself. I finally found my luggage at the front desk, but my friend who had the luggage tag couldn't find her luggage. Because she was in a hurry to catch a flight, my friend was a little angry. After all, such a simple luggage storage service does not look professional at all in such a large hotel. No one knew where the luggage was stored, so we went back to the first floor to look for our friend’s luggage. Up to this point, I had been polite and understanding. My friend received a panda doll and a medal as an apology from the staff for his angry attitude, but my understanding was met with indifference and contempt from the staff. My child and I, who had the same experience, did not receive any apology. Is this the solution for things that go wrong at work, causing guests to run up and down looking for their luggage, and delaying their trip? I was speechless. Isn't this insulting? In the end, we have to bear the cost of helping to call a taxi with the starting price. Hotel management needs to train staff on how to respect guests! ! !

msg:The room is spacious and has excellent high-altitude vision, overlooking Jinjiang River. It should be the best value for money in Chengdu. Although it is an old five-star hotel, the service is not sluggish at all, and the waiters are enthusiastic. When they saw that they were bringing their little friends, they gave them welcome gifts as soon as possible. Butler Wenwen will call in advance every night to inquire about your needs, which is very considerate! There are many local delicacies nearby, and it is a 15-minute walk to Taikoo Li, Chunxi Road, and Jiuyan Bridge, but it is not disturbed by the noise of the bustling streets. The location is perfect.

It is a 3-minute walk to the subway station, a 10-minute walk to Night Tour Jinjiang, and a 10-minute walk to Chunxi Road Taikoo Li. 20 minutes walk. The hotel service is very friendly to children. The butler Xiaoshi is attentive and gentle. He gave small gifts to the children and the room service is also good.

Facilities: The facilities are very new, unlike a 10-year-old hotel. Especially the carpets are very good, clean and comfortable. The 9-month-old child especially likes to crawl on the floor. It would be better if there are smart small devices.

Hygiene: Hygiene Sister Tang Hongmei is very diligent in cleaning. She comes to clean and change the room on time every day. Knowing that children love to crawl, she cleans the carpet very clean every day. Her attitude is very gentle, which is a plus.

The children's request was that they must have a swimming pool and the price for a double bed was 1.35. I read a lot of reviews saying that this store is very good in every aspect, so I made a reservation immediately. When we checked in, Miss Nora received us warmly and gave the children a panda doll. There were also intangible cultural heritage sugar paintings given away at the front desk, which made the children so happy! The water quality of the swimming pool is very good, and it is very comfortable for our family to swim there. The rice noodles for breakfast are delicious and have Chengdu characteristics.

msg:This is the first time I have given a bad review to a hotel. It was a very bad travel and accommodation experience. There is nothing to say about the premium during the Spring Festival, but at least the quality should be worthy of the price. The toiletries are no different from those of an express hotel, and the so-called Jiugongge snack platter is just a few cheap cookies. The most unbearable thing for me is that the temperature in Chengdu has been relatively high in the past two days. When I entered the hotel lobby, I felt stuffy. When I got to the room, it was even more suffocating. The room temperature was actually 27°. I called the front desk and asked to turn down the central air conditioning temperature. One moment, he said he would lower the temperature of the air conditioner, and the next moment he said he only turned on the ventilation, which was suffocating in the room. Later, they changed me to a suite that didn't face the sun. I felt fine when I got in. However, I was too hot to sleep at night. I spent the whole night thinking about whether I should check out and change hotels. It was a really bad experience. After reading the reviews, I found out that the air conditioning problem was Their old problem. Therefore, I hope you won’t reply and correct it later. I don’t think it will be corrected after several years. Also, it's far away from Chunxi Road, it takes 15 minutes+ to walk. In short, I don't recommend it, I don't recommend it, I don't recommend it.

The breakfast is also very delicious, Chinese and Western food are very good, small snacks, and Chengdu snacks are very authentic.

Later I saw that the main picture of this room was facing the TV Tower, wasn't it? 😓

msg:Absolutely bad review. Before arriving at the store, I called several times to ask what time I would arrive. I was afraid that the guests would not check in. Isn't it good to just accept the advance payment in such a nervous manner? The shower faucet fixing frame is broken, the overhead faucet is disorderly, and bathing is still the experience of staying in a guest house. Even if the Do Not Disturb light is on, there will still be calls asking when the cleaning will be done. Isn’t that right if the guests want it not to be cleaned? Free afternoon snack, I was told to spend 38 yuan at checkout, but if I didn’t know, my money would be deducted.

This one is very good in terms of environment, facilities and services at this price. You can see some different things at night. I know where the night view of the ancient building is, it is very beautiful. I didn't take many photos, so I took a few screenshots. What I like most is that there is a bathtub to soak in, and the children like it very much. Although there is an elevator to go upstairs, the guest rooms are all above the 33rd floor, so the quietness and viewing angle are very good. Next time I come to Chengdu for an in-depth tour, I will consider staying here.

He said straightforwardly: You don't have to come to spend if you are not happy! I said that you are unreasonable and I have no reason to speak. When I got out of the car, the old man pushed my car door and clamped my feet. This kind of personal attack happened at the entrance of the lobby! May I ask the hotel, even if you tie a ******* mastiff at the door, you can bite it if you don't dare to see anyone! It's fine if you don't know the rules, but speak wild words? Why can a security guard clamor whether I come to spend? Are you a royal relative of the hotel owner? And can make personal attacks. Does hotel management not train concierges? As the first staff of the hotel, can such a quality work? ? Your hotel does not act or deal with it? I told the person in charge that day, and he said: This person is like this. Hehe, such a person can still let him go wild at the door, then I have nothing to say, if you don't come to spend, you won't come! Your hotel is a master, so it's not bad for our business. Can't afford to climb

msg:The front desk staff are very attentive. When I came to Chengdu to travel, they took the initiative to give me a travel guide when they saw that I was from another province. It was really caring!
The executive floor I booked, also offered to upgrade me to a suite, the most important thing is (check out at 16:00, free tea in the lobby bar, etc.)
The room was clean and the toiletries were great, especially since I was on a long business trip, the cleaning and cleaning supplies of the room were especially important.
The breakfast is very rich and the lady who serves is very friendly.
A hotel worth checking in in Chengdu.

msg:This is the worst hotel I have stayed in so far in my life, not even one of the economical chains, one word to describe it: Bah! First of all, after entering, everything that can be seen will be charged, and the price is more than six times the market price! There is no welcome fruit, no milk, and the only two bottles of unnamed mineral water that are free of charge are in the corner next to the toilet, which ghosts can find. The second is the pillow, which is flat and soft, and when you lie down, you squeeze it all up. There is no support for your neck where you sleep, which is very uncomfortable. The quilt is so hot that you feel uncomfortable. It is estimated that the pillows and quilts are filled with silk, which is too rubbish. The third is the air conditioner. It is very hot when the heating is turned on, but it doesn’t feel like cooling when it is turned on. Why do you turn on the cooling in winter? Ask about the room temperature and quilt in his home! The New Year's Eve roasted people to add to the fun in your hotel? Finally, let’s talk about sound insulation. The KTV noise and the flushing of the toilet upstairs and downstairs can be heard, and even the conversation in the corridor can be clearly seen. Fortunately, no one is sleeping next door, otherwise I really feel that the night is lively and fragrant. We insisted on calling the service desk until one o'clock in the middle of the night to ask for a harder pillow and a thinner quilt, and then we found a pillow for us, and it was too late to reply to your request, there is no more! Then we continued to make phone calls, and at three o'clock in the middle of the night, pillows and quilts were finally delivered, and we barely fell asleep. When I checked out, the front desk hypocritically asked what was going on, and then there was nothing, hehe, it was really weaker than **'s apology. It's really bad luck to live in this kind of hotel during Chinese New Year! By the way, there are a bunch of old and broken people outside the window, what a fart. Can you swear? no? Then judge for yourself. The price of more than 1,000, hell enjoy it. Rubbish.

First, are you crazy to be poor? Two bottles worth 5,100 are placed on the bedside, and free drinks are placed on the sink. Isn't this an obvious money trap? I also accepted that a bottle of Evian cost 30, 5100, haha, and I was obviously not the only one who fell into this trap.
Second, the hotel's breakfast is just like Hanting, with two hot dishes, one sausage and one bacon.
Then the ribs in the steamed rice dumplings are directly bones.
Third, the hotel lobby is on the 33rd floor and the guest rooms are above the 34th floor. You have to go to the elevator and order takeout. You can only order takeout on the first floor. This service is really disappointing.
The final cost of the room is not included in the room fee. I have never stayed in such a bad hotel. I will never stay in this hotel again, and my classmates will not recommend it.

msg:Advantages: The facilities are quite new, the floors are quite high, it is really close to Bar Street and Taikoo Li, and Chunxi Road is not far. Sanitation is good. Breakfast is passable. The executive floor is high, but the room type is not larger. It provides executive benefits, including free drinks, afternoon tea and evening snacks, but the executive lounge is not open. The pool is nice.

Cons: You can hear the bar street singing in the dead of night. Lack of service awareness from the perspective of guests in five-star hotels. If I were a four-star hotel, I would give full marks, but as a five-star hotel, active service awareness is far from enough. Many inconvenient places need to be rectified by the guests. There are many examples. For example, the little brother who cooks noodles for breakfast, the noodles that the guests want to cook will be ready, but he just ignores the guests at all, so that after the guests ask for a certain type of noodles, he doesn't know whether to make them or not, and when they will come to get them. Another example is that the all-you-can-drink for executive courtesy should be in restaurant A, but when we went to restaurant B, the waiter in restaurant B looked strange and a little indifferent, explaining that it took a long time to know that restaurant B did not provide it. The arrangement of guest room supplies also lacks consideration from the perspective of guests.

Of course, as a five-star hotel, it has all the hardware, and the software, the reasonable requirements of the guests are also satisfied. However, taking the initiative to be enthusiastic and putting yourself in the shoes of the guests is an excellent five-star hotel. Instead of waiting for the guest to feel inconvenient, ask for this, ask for that, and then answer.

msg:父親的評價：入住幾日，印象難忘：網上預訂，還在路上，管家及時聯繫，瞭解訴求；來到酒店，從門廳，到大堂，電梯引導，至客房，處處體現熱情、文明、專業。為了客房空氣質量，空氣凈化器不停運轉，“驚到寶寶了”！諸多細節，無不體現“賓至如歸”的感覺。自助早餐，定價合理、品種多、質量好、口味佳，五個早晨，吃不完，真的吃不完！一句話：酒店管理高素質、高質量，值得稱讚！（下次來成都，還會再入住）

msg:房間明亮寬敞也很乾凈整潔，舒適度很高，房間的床很軟和，還帶有浴缸和小冰箱，窗户都是落地窗，能很好的欣賞景色，酒店裝修比較大氣，也算是成都的標誌性建築，外部看起來很氣派，造型很有特色。服務響應迅速，管家服務也很好，能第一時間滿足客人的需求，停車也是免費的，報車牌就能扣減費用，整體還是很方便，地理位置優越，距離九眼橋春熙路走路就能到，都是非常好的，推薦給大家。

可是送的米線忘記去吃了

早餐很豐富（甚至還有烤地瓜土豆芋頭），餐廳面北可以看到電視塔。自助咖啡馬馬虎虎但有紙杯可以外帶。另外自製四川泡菜很多種，地道開胃。

酒店位置走到IFS 15分鐘左右出行也是比較方便了，走到九眼橋大概也是15分鐘（估計）。

遺憾是送的米線沒時間去吃下次有機會吧。

我入住的房間寬敞而舒適，每一個細節都體現了酒店對品質的極致追求。房間的裝修豪華而不失品味，傢俱和設施都是一流的品牌和質量。特別是那張寬大的床，讓我一夜好眠，為第二天的旅程儲備了充足的精力。

總的來説，這家五星級酒店提供了一流的服務和設施，讓我在旅途中得到了極致的舒適和享受。我毫不猶豫地給這家酒店打上了滿分的評價，並強烈推薦給所有追求高品質旅行體驗的朋友們。

房間夠大、乾淨、被子睡的時候沒過敏的感覺，每天都睡得很香。衞生間有大浴缸，連着泡了幾天澡，記得提前準備好一次性浴缸套。
自助餐非常滿意，大人小孩都吃的很開心，我們定了三個早上，每天都選不同的吃，很推薦！菜品，各種點心、水果、咖啡豆、鮮奶。。。每樣用的食材都用心了。
位子上距離春熙路ifs有點路，但對我們來説無所謂，反正再近回酒店帶着小朋友都會打車。打車很便宜兩三公里都是十塊左右搞定！

msg:房間還好 各方面本來都還不錯 衹是退房後幾小時後酒店客服致電詢問是否帶走房間熊貓 （入住時根本沒有熊貓）感覺1、酒店內部管理有問題 並沒有像迪士尼酒店一樣入住就提供酒店內可供觀賞或者可以帶離的手辦 客人入住時無人告知房間會有熊貓可供觀賞 如果通知到了 我們入住時發現沒有也會聯繫前台；2、時效有問題。離店時我們拆開的小食品酒店方都有一一確認且向我們收取了費用，為何當時無人發現所謂的熊貓問題？當時發現我們當時就可以很確定地回覆他們一入住就衹有兩個熊貓抱枕和一張熊貓毯子，離店時全部留在房間（誰會要這個嗎）而不是退房後幾小時後，客人正在興致勃勃地別處旅遊，突然接到電話説客房熊貓讓我們產生了誤會，是不應該帶走的東西，聽得一頭霧水且影響心情。望加強內查，深刻反思及改進，發現內部管理問題，不要讓有的人有可乘之機甩鍋給客人。

1.早餐很豐富，吃不完的工作人員還細心地安排打包。
2.房間衞生乾淨，收拾也及時，知道有兩個娃入住還安排了小童拖鞋、牙刷、毛巾等。
3.酒店泳池水很乾凈，還有窗外風景。
4.誤坐了員工電梯，酒店員工耐心帶路指引。。
4.退房時給孩子們送了小禮物，意外驚喜。

其次，入前會電話聯繫溝通，但這個溝通的意義不大，因為溝通的情況也沒啥用，也沒采用，到了前台依然等於沒溝通
再次，所謂的六宮格拼盤點心到離店也沒見着在哪兒，辦入住説稍後送，當晚沒有電話説第二天送結果還是沒有，第三天離店也沒見着，不如不送
最後，早上突然沒水也沒通知，導致無水洗臉更不用説洗頭了，因為沒水廁所也不敢上。。。。。。
總之，服務上來講沒啥可圈可點的，讓人挺無語的，洗手間洗漱用品也沒有髮圈，第一次住酒店遇見沒有髮圈的！地理位置還是比較優越，不出意外衝著服務應該沒有下次了

msg:飯店很乾淨房間也算大住的很舒服,有提供嬰兒床,以價格來說CP值蠻高的,訂房有送牛肉米線但是沒有主動提醒客戶,離春熙路太古里約步行15分鐘,早餐有四川色彩蠻特別的,生菜沙拉和水果種類偏少,早餐人員服務態度一般,沒有什麼笑容和服務有點可惜。七樓的按摩環境還不錯用**可以看到優惠的選項。

定的套房，也根本沒有介紹上寫的72平，整體比較失望，不會再選擇第二次了

入住的時候前台説話就很生硬，面無表情也很不客氣。講好發票提前開出來，留了訊息。退房的時候什麼都沒準備，還一臉無辜説不結賬開不了。請問我1200的按金，我能不結賬嗎？
沒有任何服務，點外賣機器人送過來等了快半小時
大堂不在一樓，一樓沙發就兩個單人。
大堂和房間都鋪的地毯。怎麼説呢，看着沒鋪地磚的乾淨，
樓層很高，可以看見早上的太陽，要説優點。就這一個吧，服務真的影響心情
