First time to get a room facing away from the seaside. However Jinma Lu looked pretty lit up for the spring festival. We stayed in 1810 overnight before leaving China. What disappointed me was the amenities - broken, not clean according to what one would expect of an Ascott Hotel. As always the F&B team were 5star. Greetings and service. Front desk - nice to see the new staff being trained and good to see the regular friendly faces.

The housekeeper is very nice, and the service at the front desk is also very good, especially the breakfast was unexpectedly good. I was pleasantly surprised. I read previous reviews saying that there were few types of breakfast, so I thought it was not good. In fact, the breakfast is very delicate, both Chinese and Western, and the quality is also good. If you don't have time to eat breakfast, the restaurant also provides takeaway. All in all, a very satisfying experience for a few days.

I would like to thank Sue for helping me and my friends to make arrangements since the plane landed. , made me look forward to the apar**ent so much before I arrived! Winni, Anna, COCO, Cathy, Ken from the front desk, and Lucy from the clubhouse all helped me a lot during my stay. Thank you very much to these lovely people! Will definitely recommend this hotel to others!

4-star hardware, overall it's good.
Three-star breakfast, the breakfast is really a big pit, 80 is not worth it at all, the breakfast has less variety and low quality, not recommended.

In general, if you are traveling with your family and children, you can't go wrong with this one.

The facilities were also very old. There were also debris on the table. I thought the kitchen could be a little better. It's not too bad. Immediately took the child and went to live elsewhere. When I came back and checked out the next day, I reported that the front desk said that I could change the room. . I advise you to think twice. The most unsatisfactory booking.

The most unbearable thing is that you don’t provide mineral water, telling you that the tap water has a filter element and you can drink it directly. The ghost knows whether your filter element has been changed. The breakfast is really pit, and the variety is very small. It actually accepts 80 people, and the breakfast card is a big sister. The stinky face is like you owe her money, with a terrible attitude. In short, the experience is terrible!

The family-style apar**ent with kitchen and laundry room is very suitable for life in a coastal city like Dalian. It is also equipped with a gym, golf and swimming pool. The restaurant is slightly small and breakfast is so-so. The fly in the oin**ent is that it is embarrassing for 4 people to stay in a two-bedroom executive suite with only breakfast for two people. Fortunately, the convenience store downstairs is very good and fully meets the needs. There is also no free parking in the hotel. The charge for renting a car is not low. Looking forward to improvement!

個人覺得是開發區最好的酒店，性價比很高，地角也很好，附近什麼都有，房間非常大，非常非常大，落地窗，大廚房，大浴缸🛁，我非常喜歡😍
去酒店之前打電話的時候聽到前台小姐姐熱情洋溢的聲音，真的讓我特別舒服，心情好的不得了，因為是和朋友們聚會，而我並沒有期待和朋友見面，反而期待見到這個可愛的小姐姐，果然不負我所望，小姐姐真的人美心善，問了她的名字，叫ida，是我住過所有酒店裡最最最最最熱情最負責的，房間需要什麼，還有什麼找不到的東西，以及各種問題，都一一幫我解決，甚至下班了還被我麻煩，而且不會不耐煩，我覺得哪裡都真的很難做到這一點好嗎.當時就想好了，一定要狠狠的誇誇她👍
最後辛苦打掃房間的阿姨了，説聲謝謝🍳
也感謝前台anna winni  ken 和保安neil👍
