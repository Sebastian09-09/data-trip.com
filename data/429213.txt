msg:My family and I were amazed at this hotel! Since we were in Dalian in the dead of winter, I booked a hotel that my family (wife and 4 year old boy) would want to spend hours inside. This was just that! We booked the family room and when we came in, it was already setup with the special lights on full display! The gym was better than my local one that I overpay in, the pool was remarkable, and the food looked incredible. The only reason we didn't eat dinner was because we had local friends that took us to local restaurants. The location was terrific, right next to it were a bunch of delicious local Japanese restaurants. Absolutely book this hotel and if you're with a family book the family room! I want to give a special thanks to Bob 王旭 for going out of his way to make our stay even more special!

msg:This is an honest review that is not meant to dissuade anyone but to offer a thorough unbiased review. My opinion of New World before my stay was that it was a 5 star hotel, it certainly wasn't horrible, but after my stay and comparing to other Dalian hotels in its league that I've stayed in, think it doesn't fit the bill for a 5 star hotel. I can't complain about the service, Check in was swift and we got a free room upgrade and spa coupons, but the hotel room carpet was stained, there was dust in some places and the furniture and room amenities are aging, slightly dated and need to be improved (I didn't feel the need to zoom in on those issues so the pictures wont reflect this) . I loved that there were lovely art pieces throughtout the hotel and the fitness centre was top notch especially the heated pool. The breakfast buffet had fewer options than expected for a hotel of that standard but it was honestly delicious and satisfactory, they had both Chinese and Western dishes, fruit and cereal. The waitresses from Guo restaurant had the best service they went out of their way to make our dinner pleasant. The most disconcerting issue I had with New World was that the room deposit refund took longer than I've ever experienced, I found it highly unusual and somewhat disappointing because I've stayed in a lot of 5 star hotels and usually the refund is instant but they told us it would take up to 3 days. Maybe this is standard practice for them but it made no sense to me and I've never had to wait that long. In any case surely it doesn't take 3 days to check a room!

msg:The location of the hotel is good, very close to the big street. The room is spacious enough, check-in and check-out are very fast. The lady at the front desk has a sweet smile, which makes people feel at home. The room is large, the facilities are also OK, not particularly old, and the sound insulation is also good. The toiletries provided are all available at the front desk, and they are also good to use. I used coriander-scented conditioner and rum-scented shower gel, which are quite novel. If there is any shortcoming, I personally think it is in the executive lounge. The privacy of the executive lounge is very good. There are several partitioned rooms, and the afternoon tea is very simple. There are only two kinds of snacks and some cookies, and there are no small cakes. I don’t think it can be considered afternoon tea. Happy hour feels the same. I asked for a glass of red wine, and there were residues at the bottom of the glass, which was obviously the bottom of the wine. But I went there at 5:30, and there is reason to suspect that it was left over from the previous day.

msg:The hotel is in an excellent location, very close to Zhongshan Square, the center of Dalian City, and not far away is Donggang, so the hotel room can see both the bustling street scene and some sea view. PS: Maybe I live in a coastal city and am not so interested in a full sea view hotel. The local downtown street view + sea view room is more in line with my expectations.
My friend and I are both swimming enthusiasts. The hotel has a swimming pool, and a high-value swimming pool makes the experience much more upgraded. I swam once on the night of check-in and again at noon the next day. The swimming pool is beautiful during sunny days. From the effect of light and shadow, the designer is very attentive (unfortunately, neither of us brought a mobile phone)
The hotel breakfast is also great. It is open until 10:30 on weekends and eaten directly as brunch. Beef rice noodles are recommended.
After breakfast, take a walk to the Harbor Square. You can see some historical buildings along the way. The streets are full of French plane trees. This season is neither cold nor hot, which is very suitable for citywalk.
By the way, I will advertise the Yunnan mushroom rice noodles and Hongda barbecue around the hotel. They are delicious and not expensive.
In short, I will choose to stay in New World next time I come to Dalian.

msg:Traveling in Dalian, I stayed at the New World Hotel, which is on the must-stay list, and I was always satisfied. This time, the main reason was that I wanted to check in at Gangdong 5th Road, and it was convenient to go to the New World Hotel on Renmin Road in the city center. There were delicious food and fun things to do around it within three or four kilometers by taxi!

A handsome manager named Sun at the front desk provided great service and helped me upgrade to the Juxianhui Executive Room. The room was really nice and on the same floor as the Executive Lounge. Breakfast, afternoon tea, and happy hour were all convenient!

Of course, the buffet restaurant on the first floor has a richer variety! There are both Chinese and Western styles, and the seafood porridge is good, and it has been updated for two consecutive days. The rooms at Juxianhui are very good value. In addition to having a higher view, the drinks in the mini bar are free, the dishes during happy hour taste great, and there are conference rooms that can be used for free.

Recently, the buffet dinner at this hotel has been very popular in Dalian! You can eat all kinds of seafood, Japanese sashimi, small hot pot, and tomahawk steak for more than 100 yuan per person; the afternoon tea is also very cost-effective, and the spring afternoon tea desserts and salty snacks are delicious. The spiral staircase and chandelier in the important lobby are so beautiful!

Unfortunately, the Chinese restaurant is being adjusted, but I booked a view seat at the Monet restaurant in advance! The purple a**osphere is so romantic, and I finally got to eat the traditional foie gras Wellington steak... I think there are still many foreign tourists who come here to eat and stay in the hotel.

The sun pool and gym are still well maintained! Life Fitness equipment is clean; the service of this hotel has always been online, the staff will take the initiative to greet the guests when they see them, the central air conditioning is very powerful, the environmentally friendly bottle of shower gel and shampoo is also very good, the guest rooms are cleaned every day, and I will stay in New World next time I come to Dalian.

There was no breakfast, and it cost more than 100 yuan per person to eat. The hotel decoration was old, and the bathroom tiles were dirty and moldy. There were hairs in the bathtub, and I didn't want to take a bath at all. The seat where I changed my shoes was also stained, and the shower was broken. I didn't know if I wiped the mirror, and it was full of handprints. When I ordered takeout, the takeout driver was not allowed to come in, and I had to go down to get it myself. The only comforting thing was that the front desk customer service and staff were quite enthusiastic and had a good attitude.

msg:The location of the hotel is easy to find. It is very close to the subway station, and the whole road is highly commercialized. The lobby is also magnificent. The environment is very good. The most important thing is that there is a Hongda barbecue restaurant about one block away from the hotel. Highly recommended. The barbecue tastes very strong. If you want to experience the nightlife of Dalian with a few friends, this is definitely a good place. The grilled shellfish inside is very fresh and can taste sweet! Let's talk about the service of the hotel. This city of Dalian left a deep impression on me. First of all, the service industry has a very good attitude. I had breakfast at Yoshinoya, and the waiter said to me very apologetically that the beef patties were a little mushy. Including when I was at the New Century Hotel, the lobby manager would say good morning to me unexpectedly every morning, and when I checked out, the guy at the front desk didn't forget to say byebye with a smile. This kind of comfortable service attitude is something I haven't experienced in other cities. If you have to pick out the shortcomings of this hotel, it's that the windows are a little dirty, and there is no small soap in the bathroom. But I think compared with the overall smooth service speed and excellent service quality, this is nothing. I think if I have the chance, I will come to Dalian again, not only because of the vast sea, but also because of the comfortable Dalian people and the excellent service quality!

msg:Two rooms, 2207 and 2208, were checked in from the 11th to the 13th. On the evening of the 11th, guest 2207 was bitten by an insect. He informed the hotel and they moved him to room 2204 and negotiated a one-night refund as compensation. On the evening of the 12th, the guest in room 228 was seriously bitten again. We negotiated with the hotel around 10:20 am on the 13th and told us to take the guest to the hospital for examination. However, we had scheduled a flight back to South Korea at 14:30 pm, which was not allowed due to time constraints. We asked that if we go to the hospital for examination, we would be compensated for the cost of changing our three air tickets and the cost of food and accommodation for that night. The hotel offered us free room for one more night. We did not agree to take a step back and ask the hotel to refund all the room charges for 2 nights and 4 rooms. Solved by this. The hotel took 10 minutes to reply and finally waited for 5 hours with no reply. After that, we repeatedly communicated and negotiated with the hotel through Ctrip officials and Dalian 12345 officials. The answer we got was that because a third-party agency was involved, the hotel only refunded one day on the 11th. Late fees, all other commi**ents will not be fulfilled, compromise is not possible, and there is no evidence anyway (remind everyone that consumers are a vulnerable group if similar things happen, they must call the police as soon as possible and retain the corresponding evidence, otherwise it will be useless for anyone to intervene), If it doesn't work, I will file a lawsuit. During this period of time, I have witnessed the hotel's extreme nonsense. A five-star hotel has provided such rubbish service, regardless of the guest's rights and patience, and has no choice but to accept the compromise. , I will never book a hotel of this brand again in this life, nor will I let my friends and relatives around me book a hotel of this brand again. It is really unscrupulous. I am publishing the truth today and hope everyone can avoid it.

msg:The experience of staying at New World Hotel this time was not particularly good. The following aspects need to be improved:
1. Lobby service: We were carrying several luggages, but the hotel staff didn’t ask if we needed help. They turned a blind eye. This is not the service that a five-star hotel should have.
2. Guest room hygiene: The stains next to the bathtub in the bathroom were not cleaned, the skirting boards in the guest room were very dusty, and there was a layer of dust on the phone.
3. Supplies: The towels are already frayed and should be replaced with new ones.
4. Disposable supplies: There are no disposable paper cups. I called and asked for 2 paper cups, but they charged a fee! ! Disposable toilet seats are not provided either. There is no disposable soap, so you can only use water to wash your face! !
5. Consumables: The toilet paper in a five-star hotel is actually the same as that in an ordinary express hotel? ! Bad quality! !
6. Service: In the morning, the cleaning staff knocked on the door and delivered water (included in the paid minibar package), and asked if they could clean the room. I said I would clean it in the afternoon, but the children hadn’t gotten up yet. After saying this, the cleaning staff looked unhappy and didn’t say a word. left! ! Really speechless! !
7: Takeaway: Takeout is not delivered upstairs. Nowadays, many 5-star hotels have robot delivery services. If you have no choice, you have to go downstairs to pick it up yourself. It is really inconvenient!

I tried taking the second passage and there was no smell of smoke from the 1st to 25th floors. The swimming pool is in good condition, but the water in the shallow water area is too shallow, which should be suitable for small children to play in the water. There are various Japanese and Western-style buildings in old Dalian around. Close to tram line 201, there are regular and retro old clock models. It is also very close to the Dalian Port Terminal. I took a walk and saw the Bangchui Island and Putuo Island moored.

Although there were a lot of guests checking in and it took a while to queue up, the staff at the front desk would signal me to wait so I wouldn't feel left out.
The beautiful girl at the front desk recommended me a south-facing room full of sunshine. During the few days I stayed, I went to the swimming pool three times. The spacious and bright layout coupled with the constant-temperature pool water made swimming very comfortable.

The breakfast in the restaurant is fantastic! There is a wide variety of food flavors, whether you like sweet, salty or healthy options, there is something here to satisfy your taste. Especially their pancakes, waffles and egg rolls are all very good.
In addition, the restaurant environment is also very comfortable and warm, with simple and elegant decoration, making people feel relaxed and comfortable. The service staff are warm and friendly, always greeting every guest with a smile, making people feel extra welcome.

On the day of check-out, the handsome guy wearing glasses at the front desk thoughtfully called a taxi for me. It can be seen that the management is thinking hard. I like this hotel so much that I must recommend it to my friends.

It happened to be just after New Year's Day and the lobby had a festive a**osphere. When I arrived at the front desk, the staff asked me my preferences very enthusiastically. I chose the room I like. I originally wanted a room with a good street view, but since it started to get a little cold in the evening in the north, I called the front desk to change my room. The front desk staff quickly helped me choose a south-facing room and also prepared a room. There was electric heating and I asked the concierge colleagues to help carry my luggage. Although I didn’t get the street view room I wanted this time, the enthusiasm of the front desk staff made me choose New World Hotel when I come to Dalian in the future.

Although it is the peak season for tourism, the self-service check-in machine in the hotel lobby is really fast and convenient. I got the room card in less than two minutes. I like it! The staff at the front desk also gave the child a gift certificate, and they can go to the small commodity store in the lobby to get popcorn. A small and delicious gift can make the child so happy. The hotel owner is really smart! The layout of the room is really good, tent toys, fruit snacks, and even the children's toiletries are complete. Is the cartoon little bathrobe a giraffe's or something, the child keeps clamoring to wear it after taking a shower! My favorite is the digital lights in the starry sky, the walls all over the room instantly transform into an underwater world haha! It can be seen that the hotel has put its heart into it. I saw many reviews saying that the swimming pool is suitable for children, and it is true after arriving. The water temperature is very warm, and the shallow water area is especially suitable for children to play. After swimming, you can go to the hot surf pool for a dip. It is very comfortable! The breakfast is also good, with many types, including Western and Chinese styles. You can go out when you are full, and you will have a good day! The surrounding area of ​​the hotel is very convenient. There are many restaurants and supermarkets, as well as shopping centers. It is also close to Zhongshan Square, Donggang, Haizhiyun, etc. In this high heat season in the country, the weather in Dalian is really cool and makes people so happy. It was a happy family trip, and I will come again next time!

There are welcome fruits. The breakfast on the first floor is good, with a lot of variety. The kids love it. The lobby environment is very good. The swimming pool is a bit disappointing. I thought it was good after reading the details and customer reviews. I booked this for the swimming pool, but it’s really not big, and the water is too shallow. My child who is over 120cm thinks it is too shallow, (the child can swim , I like a more formal swimming pool) Then I didn't expect there to be swimming lessons here, I thought it was mainly residents.
One more thing, when I checked out, I queued up at the front desk and waited for the check-in process. There was a customer in front of me who had been checking in for a long time. After more than ten minutes, the car I ordered arrived. I was anxious and asked the staff in the row who was doing the check-in. Say I check out, can I give you the room card directly, isn't that the case in most of the cases now, you can leave after handing in the room card, and you don't need to check the room. But the male staff member said, I want to see it, I need to check it later, but after a while, the staff next to me was empty and the man let me pass over there, and then I walked over, the woman The staff directly told me to check out, give me the card and you can go. . . I'm going, why was I wasting half a day earlier! Hurry out of the lobby and get on the bus! Rush to the station!

Let’s talk about this breakfast. We ate it for five days. We haven’t seen any varieties of bread in the past few days. After jam, strawberry jam and peanut butter, salad dishes are always the same. Chicken sausages and beef sausages are available every day, no update The fruit is replaced with dragon fruit every five days. The hot dishes are always fungus, cauliflower duck neck, a pile of pickles, small steamed buns, no co**** grains, no corn, and no sweet potatoes. The child wants to eat waffles. Tell me The staff said they would wait five minutes and asked me how much I wanted, and she would not do it unless I asked him to ask for it. On the last day, the child wanted to eat and found that there was no staff. Do it, every day I stand in the restaurant and don't know what to eat, can you simply update the menu, I ordered breakfast and there is no way to return it, so let's have a bite anyway. The service is quite satisfactory, and the room is cleaned in a timely manner. The swimming pool is the highlight. We played in the pool for a long time when it rained.

msg:There are countless five-star hotels I have stayed in, all of which belong to the online service quality, and this is the first hotel that I need to seriously evaluate. In one word: Lightning protection!
1. When I gave up Shangri-La and decided on this hotel, I was completely attracted by the "parent-child room". The hotel called a week in advance to inquire about the boys and girls who brought them, and said that they should prepare early, which once filled our expectations! Then I made three more phone calls to confirm whether I would like to come. As a result, when I opened the door after checking in, there was only a big bed inside. There was nothing there, which was completely different from the two beds in the picture, one big and one small. It is a business big bed room. When I called the front desk, the answer I got was: I am afraid that you will not come, and I am not prepared. Then dragged over a small bed with wheels, spread it on site, and hastily dragged over some children’s tents, rocking horses... It’s really speechless. The so-called "parent-child room" is just an extra mobile bed, and the room is still a big bed room. The room is equivalent to that I booked a double bed room and then added money for an extra bed in disguise! Isn't it good for me to sleep in Shangri-La's over two-meter-large bed? Regret to death!
2. The appearance of the hotel is new. It may be that the facade has been renovated. The pictures are very good, but the hotel rooms are very old, as if they have returned to 20 years ago in an instant. There is a construction site outside the building, and there is noise from the elevator shaft going back and forth at night, which affects sleep.
3. When I came back on the second night, I found that the window was opened by the cleaning staff, and mosquitoes came in. I called the front desk, and the answer was to send mosquito repellent. It didn't arrive for half an hour, so I called again, and another person answered the front desk, saying that my colleague forgot, and there was no mosquito repellent, only toilet water. There is no mosquito swatter, and there is no such thing. How does a family of three sleep at night? ? ! In the end, only one person can apply some self-contained mosquito repellent to prevent mosquitoes. Speechless, a five-star hotel does not have mosquito repellent products for guests? ?
4. The breakfast was not fixed. Because of the problem of the parent-child room, the lobby manager said that breakfast would be provided as compensation. Later, the breakfast was stopped by the front desk, and it was another verification~~ Didn’t you make a note? ? The breakfast is very average, completely inconsistent with the five-star standard. If I ordered breakfast, I would probably regret it even more.
For the same price, giving up Shangri-La to stay in your home is really the biggest failure of this trip. I was deceived by your "parent-child room" gimmick, which is very unpleasant! There is no five-star standard at all, the worst five-star hotel experience~~

Stains can be seen everywhere. The most exaggerated elevator comes out with the smell of moldy carpet and the heat from the upper aisle. I can feel the sourness. I live on the 14th floor, and I don’t comment on other floors.
The air conditioner in the room is loud and the cooling is poor. After shouting 3 times, a stinky master came. First, he blamed me for turning on the wrong wind, and then he pretended to check and said it was ok. I invite you New World leaders to go to room 1422 during the day to have a look. , is the air conditioner good or bad?

It still happened in a five-star hotel, and the whole person was stunned. The first time I contacted the front desk, the person who came up to the engineering depar**ent directly said that it was a problem with the bearing capacity of the baffle of the photo frame. A photo frame with a composite board bearing at least a dozen kilograms is installed on the mirror. Since it is for the sake of beauty, why can't the corresponding safety inspection be done. The front desk manager and other people who came up at the first time happened kept coming in and out. I don’t know why I didn’t say I went to the hospital for an examination.
Then I went to the hospital and the CT scan showed that there was no problem, so it was over. I kept my mouth shut and didn’t talk about compensation. I was so confused that I couldn’t communicate with them at all. I contacted the front desk manager at noon and said, “Please give me an explanation.” Until now, I have asked for a refund. The room rate negotiation failed, and 12345 also complained, but the merchants did not regress and the Consumers Association could not deal with them. It could only strengthen the security inspection and supervision of their hotels.
May 1 spends money to find guilt, I just want to say lightning protection! To deal with the problem in this way, as a consumer, I am even authorized to comment, and it took a month of communication to give this bad review!

msg:. The starry sky parent-child room booked, the room has a starry sky projection lamp, a small tent, a small wooden horse, and the most important thing is an independent single bed. In addition, there are building blocks and free snacks and drinks. The children's products in the room are also complete, and the room can be arranged according to the gender of the child. I think the biggest highlight of the hotel is the swimming pool, which is more suitable for parents and children. There are many shallow water areas and a separate warm water pool. After landing, there is a steam room for children to warm up before taking a bath. Of course, the most distinctive feature is that the swimming pool water is purified seawater, which satisfies the regret of not being able to go to the sea. Also, the hotel is not far from Zhongshan Square, you can feed the pigeons. It is not far from Donggang Musical Fountain, ten minutes by taxi. If you want to experience the tram, there are also stations nearby. In short, the transportation is convenient. The downside is that the hotel is a bit old, and it can't compare with the glory of the year. Of course, the price is not too high, so it is still cost-effective.

msg:New World Dalian Hotel is located in the city center, not only has a good living experience, but also has convenient transportation, and it is very convenient to go to several popular check-in places. The fully transparent floor-to-ceiling windows in the room have a great view, the room is quite large, and the space design is reasonable. You can also see the blue sea of Donggang. The hotel's food and beverages are also very good. After visiting the scenic spots, I chose to dine in the hotel, just in time to experience the new spring day Afternoon tea, it tastes really good. I like the hotel's buffet breakfast very much. There are many kinds of snacks, and there are many special snacks. The chefs make them on the spot, and the experience is very good. There is a coffee bar in the executive lounge on the 22nd floor of the hotel. You can drink a cup of mellow coffee at any time. The indoor swimming pool on the 5th floor is also full of design sense. The dome design is beautiful and the water temperature is suitable. You must check in. All in all, the experience of staying at Dalian New World Hotel is very good, the service is friendly, and it is a very cost-effective hotel in this area of Dalian. Let’s travel to Dalian this summer, see Haipao Hotel, and taste Dalian carefully. Romance and tenderness.

The rooms are divided into smoking floors and non-smoking floors, which are very user-friendly. The hotel's swimming pool is really a must, I like it 👍🏻, it is big and bright, and the water temperature is very comfortable! The room was cleaned very clean, and the waiters on the floor would greet each other proactively. The room also has large floor-to-ceiling windows, and the night view of Renmin Road is also very beautiful at night! In short, I highly recommend everyone to come to New World Hotel, and will continue to stay in the future.

Once I entered the room, it was clean and tidy. The executive lounge on the same floor is very convenient and basically can meet all my needs without going downstairs. Happy hour is also available It is very suitable for me to lose weight without dinner. The swimming pool and gym are very professional and well-equipped. The restaurant has a great breakfast and the service is also very good!

msg:As soon as I entered the door, I was confronted. I was asked for the birth certificate and household registration book of my 2-year-old baby. If I didn't have it, I was not allowed to stay! 🥲
The carpet in the room was full of stories, with all kinds of hair and oil stains. I stayed in Shangri-La opposite for two days in the summer. The price was similar but the environment was very clean. When I left, I gave my child a small seal toy, which was very considerate. Oh, yes, when I entered the door, the Shangri-La receptionist helped me with the luggage and was very enthusiastic. But no one opened the door at the New World. No one asked when I entered the lobby. Everyone was ** lightning, which was a bad feeling.
This hotel gives people the feeling that it has been open for more than a hundred years. The facilities are quite old, and the cabinet doors are worn out. The main thing is that the bed is not as comfortable as Shangri-La, and the thickness of the mattress is too different, which is not worthy of this price
I should say that Ctrip's service is still very good, reasonable, thumbs up
I advise everyone not to come to this hotel if you have nothing to do, you will definitely regret it if you come!

msg:1. The room is very big, and the floor-to-ceiling windows are very large. It is a pity that there are too many high-rise buildings on the opposite side. Some of the decoration facilities in the room are a little outdated, and the sliding door of the sink is a little heavy.
2. The most useful thing in the parent-child room is a small bed, which is especially suitable for families traveling with two children. Small tents, Trojan horses, Lego toys, etc. are quite satisfactory, and they are also equipped with a marine projection lamp, which children like very much. The fruit plate and cakes provided by the guests are exquisite.
3. The breakfast is good, the variety is complete and the taste is delicious, until ten o'clock.
4. The swimming pool is superb, the ceiling is made of transparent glass, you can see the sky is high and the clouds are clear while you are swimming in the water. The feeling of sunlight entering the swimming pool through the glass makes people feel very comfortable. The overall design of the swimming pool is very good, which is different from many The hotel has no divided swimming lanes and is very open.
5. During the two days I stayed in the hotel, I felt that the service level of the whole hotel was very high, and I was very active on the basis of doing my job well, for example. Before leaving, I deflated the swimming ring in the lobby, and the little brother who kept the luggage took the initiative to help, dragging a pile of luggage and walking, and the lobby staff would also come up to help in time.
6. In addition, I also had a meal at the Chinese restaurant on the 2nd floor of the hotel, which is highly recommended. Although the attendance rate was not high, our family was very satisfied.

msg:I won't come to New World again. First: I plan to blow my hair after taking a shower at night. I take out the hair dryer in the drawer and plug it in and it won't work. I call the service center to have a look. I waited for at least 20 minutes. , I hit it again with wet hair. This time it came very quickly, but it was an uncle in a security uniform. After he saw it, he pulled the hair dryer I plugged in from the wall, and was a little sullen. I opened the drawer of the hair dryer and said that it's plugged in well for you. What are you doing when you pull it out? I was stunned. When I took it out of the drawer, it wasn't plugged in. If it was plugged in, I could still do it. Unplug it and plug it back into the wall again? How would I know that there are sockets hidden here? The second is the swimming pool. Anyone who has lived in the new world knows that the swimming pool in New World is good. The pool is not deep and is especially suitable for children. This time I came here to live here, but this year I found that it was actually open to the outside world. That is to say Then a small pool has also opened a for-profit swimming class, accompanied by parents, three or five coaches, and many children who come to learn to swim. It seems that you are not coming to the swimming pool in the hotel where you stayed at the high price, but a swimming pool. The open swimming pool... I said no wonder the elevator controls are closed, and the experience is completely private! The third is that I have waited for a long time to check out the next day. I really don't know what to say. Anyway, I won't come again!

msg:Hygiene is okay, and the service is also very patient and kind. Out of a responsible attitude, let me ask a few questions objectively:
1. There are sufficient parking spaces at the entrance, but there is a fee for staying guests, which is rare in the five-star hotels I have stayed in. If you want to stop for free, you can stop at the underground B2 for a long time, and there are shopping malls in the underground, which are quite chaotic.
2. The facilities are too old. I thought it could be better than the opposite Furama Shangri-La, but the result is not satisfactory. The 20-inch old-fashioned TV has a distorted picture when it is turned on. It is better to put a Bluetooth speaker to listen to the sound. When the air conditioner is turned on in the room, there is a smell of aging rubber, and the children always ask what the smell of balloons is...
3. There is still no socket in the bathroom to plug in a hair dryer, not to mention the USB socket in the whole house, the only useful socket is on one side of the bed, and there is only one! The other one next to the TV is a decoration, and the charging watch was not charged overnight, which was very delayed.
4. The room type does not match the photos. The parent-child room I booked looks very big in the photos. In fact, it looks like a double-bed room. The tent is not next to the window, but squeezed to the bottom of the wall. It is difficult to adjust the air-conditioning button. Anyway, it is inconvenient in many places.

I don't think about his family for the time being, it's not very comfortable, the problems actually exist and what I said is intolerable, let's use it as a reference.

If you stay in a budget hotel, the hotel service staff will bring it up, but if you stay in a five-star hotel, it will not be delivered. Speaking of epidemic prevention reasons, I especially understand the fear of the risk of the takeaway brother carrying the virus, but your hotel does not arrange for someone to take the elevator up. This has nothing to do with the fight against the epidemic, right? The service is simply bad. It is an old hotel, but the service is not done well. I am speechless. I will not choose New World in the future. I recommend the opposite Shangri-La.

msg:Worst review! For the first time in three years, I wrote a review and gave this so-called 5-star hotel. When the front desk staff saw the guest, it was like seeing the enemy, and they roared when they came up! The general manager is a person from swizerⅠand who has been coming to the hotel for 6 years. When discussing complaints with customers, they don't listen to customers at all, don't investigate at all, and immediately say that our staff is absolutely fine, with a look of impatience and arrogance. Also said that this is his working method, this is China! Not swizerland! This is the first time I have met such an unprofessional general manager! No wonder the staff at the front desk are so unqualified, how can it be good to have such a general manager? Having stayed in hundreds of 5-star hotels, Dalian New World is truly unique! Front desk service is so rude!

The location was relatively quiet after 10 pm, and I couldn't even find a convenience store when I walked around. The hotel was changed to this hotel on the second night. The service at the entrance of the hotel was not bad. On the first day we got off the bus, they helped us with our luggage and opened the door. The room is clean, but the carpet is old and dusty, and the bathroom is clean. Another thing that is particularly bad is the teacher in the swimming pool, who is especially bad for the children of hotel guests. My child saw the buoyancy board and thought it was for the swimming pool, so he wanted to get it. The coach yelled and put it back, and his attitude was very bad. If you tell the child, we will never take it, or you have a tip.

msg:It was a disappointing stay. First, the room smelled bad. Secondly, the service at the front desk was very poor. I am a VIP member of Ctrip and can enjoy checking out at 2 pm. The front desk called at 1 o'clock to urge me very rudely, saying that the room was full Yes, I can't provide a late check-out at 2 o'clock, so I have to return the room immediately. Is this something you can decide unilaterally? This is a matter of communication between your hotel and Ctrip, you should not call me. Out of understanding, I went through the check-out procedure immediately. When I checked out, the front desk service asked if the room fee could be refunded from the deposit. I was charged double for the room. I called the hotel for feedback and complaints, and a person who claimed to be the manager came out and said that the overcharged room fee would be refunded immediately. It was almost 3 days, and the room fee has not been refunded. The service of this hotel, a five-star hotel, is just like this Serve.

msg:The hotel has good service, the rooms are clean and hygienic, and I am very satisfied. Live for more than a month, a few suggestions are for reference only. The door has a strong rebound force, and the door can be firmly closed with the help of natural inertia, and the safety is guaranteed and impeccable. However, there is no guarantee that everyone can block or lightly hold the door handle when the door is closed, and slow down the closing speed of the door, so as to avoid the sound from affecting the surrounding and upper and lower floors. The actual situation is that the door is thick and heavy. When entering and leaving frequently in the morning and afternoon, the sound of closing the door causes strong tremors on the walls, doors and windows, and writing desk of the room. To exaggerate, some time periods are basically one after another, and sometimes suddenly at night. There was a huge tremor. It is difficult for everyone to change their habits. It is suggested that the hotel can install some cushioning materials on the door frames of the guest rooms to reduce the impact, noise and tremor, so that the more "nervous" hotel guests can also get some restful sleep. There is no screen window is also a flaw, I hope to improve it. I will come to New World Hotel again in the future, and I am very satisfied overall.

I went back to the hotel around 12:00 in the middle of the night. I went down to the front desk and told me that the room card was easy to use and made a card for me. When I came back, the room door was opened. The central air conditioner in the second hotel was not air-conditioned. Because I stayed in Sanya for a long time, I used the air conditioner to sleep every day, so I wanted to open the air conditioner and the room was special I fell asleep at 3:00 in the sweltering heat. I woke up in the morning and contacted Ctrip to change the itinerary immediately. This hotel is very famous in Dalian, but the hardware is not the best, so you must be careful when telling others to book their hotel!

Strangers you don't know can help.) After returning to the room, the hair dryer is not good. I called the front desk four times before sending a hair dryer. That is to say, why is it not working? Change the jack and try it. We will repair it for you. Are you not good at it? Get, really, my mentality is broken, it's two o'clock in the middle of the night, can you solve something? If you don't make a fuss, he won't bring it with you. Finally, let's spit out that his breakfast seems to be more than 150 people 😄, I advise everyone not to eat it and you will regret it to death. The dishes are less flavorful. In short, the price is not worth it at all, between 300-400! 500 is not worth it. As far as his service is concerned, I can only say less than 100. I have never given a bad review to any hotel, but your hotel is really bad and has no value for money. I hope you will consider it carefully!
🔔Service: 4 rooms are all 0000 points

It was said that the third party would not handle it, and I didn’t say let me wait for confirmation and let the latter one directly. I also met the front desk staff who started to work with customers, and said that they couldn't help themselves, and left after falling things. It really served. . Haha
The welcome fruit that I said was ordered at noon and only delivered in the evening (I gave it to me when I called, or two small peaches that are not fresh, okay). Forget it, even the most basic soap has to be beaten. Does the phone want a five-star hotel? Ha ha ha

msg:Check-in: Check-in was very fast, and the attitude of the young lady who received on the first day was also very good. When there was a wedding banquet, there were a lot of people and noisy.
Guest room: It should be an old star-rated hotel, the decoration is relatively old, the TV is small, but the space is large, and there is a bathtub.
Facilities: There is a fitness center and swimming pool on the 5th floor of the hotel, but there are training for children at night. There are many people. The swimming pool ranges from shallow to deep, not very big.
Service: Basically there is no service, and there is no special demand. Those who need parking coupons should note that there is no signal in the underground parking lot. After scanning the QR code to confirm the key points, it will be valid within 15 minutes.

Scanning codes, temperature measurement, disinfecting hand sanitizer, and free masks make people feel particularly safe. I also want to thank the front desk manager Yao and Cindy for their enthusiastic help, not only prepared the room in advance as required, but also upgraded it for free. The hotel has a superior location and relatively complete facilities and equipment. The breakfast is rich in variety, and the swimming pool is particularly beautiful. You can also see the young lady of Xiamen Airlines. I wish the hotel a prosperous business and look forward to seeing you next time.

The lady with glasses at the front desk placed an order for more than an hour and kept saying that she hadn’t received the order, and then she called and asked someone there and asked me to wait a while and then chatted with a colleague. I waited for dozens of minutes. I came over and asked her if she could check in. She said that she could give her her ID card, and she would not check in for a while. Then a group of people renewed the room and put my ID card aside. I want you to be the front desk. So disrespectful to guests? I've stayed in so many five-star hotels. The receptionist at this hotel is really disgusting and won't check in.

First of all, the air conditioning is bad. The advice given by the engineering depar**ent is that if you don't mind, he will bring the equipment to repair it for half an hour, then please ask what did the guests check out before? What should the accident be repaired early? The whole room is very stuffy. The quality of the bathrobe is even very hot. Not as good as the Marriott economic brand Yaleyu, the bedding is not evaluated, after all, the price of more than 500, you can't need the bicycle, and the last one is the sound insulation effect of the room. It's really Dobby sound effects. You can understand it yourself.

msg:新世界真的性價比可以的，對比周圍同樣的價位還含早，從禮賓到前台再到客房阿姨都會主動問好，早餐也還行，雖然不多但是該有的都有。
衞生方面因為從斜對面香某某酒店搬過來，我主打一個死心，但其實客房打掃的很乾凈，尤其地毯清潔真的可以了，也可能是我碰到了負責的阿姨！真的不誇張，我進來看到衞生情況我都激動壞了哈哈哈！
設施呢確實舊了點，不過不影響我，所以忽略不計。

住過國內和國外諸多五星酒店，大連新世界酒店所遇到的人與服務令人倍感體貼周到，愉悦舒適。

每次出入酒店都有熱情爽朗的問候；22層餐廳的兩位美女小姐姐，每次早餐都很温暖的問候，並記得我早餐需要的食物迅速備好；前台的一位帥哥還記得我名字和房間號，迅速應對，見面愉快打招呼；客房阿姨認真細心地打掃衞生，每次都給多備些飲用水，應要求在我每天回酒店之前給房間開窗換氣，打開加濕器。這些細節非常令人愉快温暖。

尤其促使我想借用攜程平台寫下這個評價的，是出於對在入住期間給予許多關心和幫助的前台經理Abe Gao的感謝。從始至終，她像陪伴在身邊的親友一樣周到體貼。在職務範圍內靈活迅速應對，提供便利。適時主動關心，對所提需求合理滿足。諸多細節不在此贅述。Abe幹練嫻熟的業務能力，恰到好處的邊界感和分寸感，大方真誠的態度，優秀的溝通技巧，得體的禮儀，似親友般的相處模式，這些素質都讓人感受到安心與信賴。既令客人滿意舒適，又顯示出對酒店利益的維護和對工作的盡職盡責，堪稱優秀的酒店人。亦可窺見酒店在培育員工方面的着力。
入住期間，中途需離開大連數日，她的及時跟進和關心，令我決定在返回大連時再度入住了新世界，多謝Abe做的最舒適的安排。 

即使同為五星酒店，也有着參差的軟硬件條件。大連新世界，以其充滿人情味的氛圍令人駐足。
感謝AbeGao和所有愉快相處過的人。

新春佳節之際祝各位萬事如意，酒店生意興隆。

前台的小姐姐非常親切，笑容滿面，讓我感覺像回到了家一樣。房間更是讓我驚艷，寬敞明亮，床鋪舒適，還有超大的落地窗，可以看到美麗的城市景色。

酒店的早餐種類豐富，中西式都有，口味也非常好。

最驚喜的是他們的健身房和游泳池，設施齊全，非常乾淨。我在泳池遊了個泳，感覺整個人都放鬆了。

大連新世界酒店給我留下了非常好的印象，無論是硬件設施還是服務質量，都達到了五星級的標準。如果你來大連，我強烈推薦你入住這家酒店。

msg:作為老牌五星級酒店，還是比較不錯的。
首先，前台素質很高，服務質量很好。接待我們的小姐姐，在我們表示要無煙房之後，立即打電話對接。雖然一開始房間還沒打掃好，但不到十分鐘就接到了電話，立即可以辦理入住。攜程上訂的是14:00入住，實際當天12點多就辦理入住了。另外一位沒有接待我們的前台小姐姐，也是非常漂亮，態度很好。酒店房間挺大的，尤其是床，感覺比一般酒店要大。靜音效果也很好，幾乎聽不懂外面的聲音。地理位置非常優越，中山廣場地鐵站走過來十分鐘（大連中心城區離地鐵站非常近的酒店很少，這個步行距離算不錯了），前面還有公交車，坐去老虎灘很方便，後面小街裏的幾家日料也非常不錯。
吐槽的地方也有，第一就是大部分星級酒店的通病，外賣自己下去拿。然後很不適應的三點，一是窗簾和地面有大概5公分的距離，每天大概5點多大連天就亮了，陽光通過底下的縫隙透進來，可以把人亮醒。二是房間插座很少，而且松。大床右側是沒有插頭的，手機充電要放到電視機旁邊。衞生間也衹有給吹風機用的，在抽屜裏的一個插頭，我插捲髮棒都沒地方。三是，有點懷疑毛巾、毯子這些是否每天更換？因為浴衣可以確定，不是每天都幫我們換的。

設施：四星
衞生：四星
環境：五星
服務：五星
SPA99元抵值券:沒用，外面十來米有一家泰式的，那邊更便宜。

非常值得一提的是酒店的早餐和健身中心，早餐是這一路吃得最好的一次，區塊品種分類清楚，花樣繁多，沙拉區搭配得很專業，蛋白質也非常齊全，很適合健身人士哈。

健身房也是非常給力，有/無氧器械都維護得很好。在大連大吃大喝也不怕沒地方做缺口😆

另外地理位置也算絕佳，好幾個很有名的館子都是步行可達。

msg:應該是住過最失望的五星酒店了罷！
1.從入住説起、現在還需要交按金的不多了吧？！還是因為是網上預訂的差別對待呢？！攜程預訂房費總價3600+，交付按金5500；
2.吃過最差勁的五星級酒店早餐，標價168/位，就這？餐廳不大略擁擠、小朋友早上不舒服吐到地上東西，招手喊了服務人員當做沒看見？主要用餐時不是高峯人還不多，後來一位大爺表示稍等會收拾，等了會也沒看到人來打掃。我怕滑到其他客人去拿紙巾想着擦乾淨，後來還是一個鬆餅廚師收拾的（應該是做華夫餅的不確定、戴着廚師帽子）。餐品類別和亞朵差不多、甚至酸奶是一大盆自己盛？就連亞朵都是小盒子酸奶好麼…總之是住過五星級酒店裡早餐最令人失望的、因為有小朋友行李多不然真的想要換酒店住
3.有一説一，客房保潔阿姨令人滿意我們喝水多每天收拾好房間後放置在房間的水都很多哈、態度也是整個酒店最最好的。其他包括前台➕餐廳人員都幾乎沒有什麼服務而言。打電話要個東西都要催個兩次無語😓。在餐廳吃飯前面的阿姨問勺子哪裡取，煮麪的廚師肯定知道，因為就在他面前調料區就有瓷勺居然説你去問服務員？！what？！
歡迎水果就一個蘋果➕小朋友一鐵盒零食（兩個瑪德琳➕一個泡芙➕糖果）瑪德琳和泡芙不確定出產幾天了、我平常是有烘焙的，感覺不新鮮。歡迎水果更是無語，一個蘋果？還不如不放。
另外，冰箱除了水就是兩瓶可樂一瓶雪碧，並且衹有第一晚有，之後不補。😓紙品質量也很差勁與酒店星級和房價不符合
總之不會再住這家。

攜程五一前訂好的價格 結果入住當天還降價了
空調開很久都沒有變涼快 而且聲音巨大 嗡嗡響 晚上打電話給前台解決打不通
床品也是比較老的了 材料都不太符合這個價格 枕頭比較薄 沒什麼支撐感 
酒店電視巨小 還是10年前的電視感覺 雖然酒店看到有翻修 但牆角的水漬已經發黑了
所謂的人民路夜景也沒啥 周圍都是高樓 也看不到啥 不會再來

泳池的服務員，沒有服務，不會好好説話，不會主動提供儲物櫃鑰匙。

環境：隔音不是很好，走廊裏的小孩聲音聽得清清楚楚的。玻璃也很臟。
設施：兩邊的牀頭櫃衹有一邊是有插座的，很不方便。
就沖這個服務，下次來 為什麼我不選擇住對面的香格里拉呢。

服務大部分不太好。第一天到前台辦理入住，一個女前台，全程黑着一張臉，很不耐煩，詢問一些問題時，要麼愛答不理，要麼答非所問，問她午餐晚餐什麼樣式，他回答説收費的，至今記憶猶新。辦理入住時需要登記，在我們正常填寫時，前台一直在催。自助晚餐體驗也不好，服務人員全程黑臉，一副高傲樣子，或許是身處五星酒店令她自豪。説實話，不知道酒店培訓是否到位，心情實在不好。食物保温方式很不合理，枱麪都是燙的，取餐時很容易燙傷。
當然，服務兩顆星，給的是保潔阿姨和一個男前台，阿姨耐心、隨和，男前台處理問題妥善而及時，態度温柔，可以稱得上是酒店前台標桿！行李寄存處的大哥也很給力！這是此次旅行中，在酒店所看到的為數不多的笑臉了。
其他的中規中矩，比較符合五星酒店設施吧。但服務態度這麼差是真的沒想到😅

msg:第二次入住新世界品牌酒店，員工熱情禮貌，房間乾淨整潔而且整體佈局非常合理。酒店位於鬧市區，出門吃飯（點評網上一些評分高的飯店）基本衹需要步行，前往各處景點打車都不遠，到機場打車也衹需約30元。酒店設施的話朋友用了泳池説很不錯。當初訂房的時候和斜對面二選一，沒有讓人失望 ：）
