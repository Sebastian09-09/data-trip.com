msg:Exceptional service from all staff, especially Ricky when checking in and Stephen from the conceirge who gave excellent tips and constantly so helpful and patient during our stay. We booked the club package and enjoyed it thoroughly. Love the afternoon tea and evening cocktail and snacks. It was amazing, though we prefer the wider varieties of breakfast at the lobby in the morning than the lounge. Rooms are spacious and very clean but could see some parts are dated. Love especially the Japanese toilet, with warm seat function. The mattress is extremely comfortable and to our liking. Love the excellent location, center of everything. Also was really fun to have a ride in the pink London Taxi that our package provided, the kids enjoyed the ride. Highly recommend and will definitely my only address in Shanghai. Also not to forget the excellent swimming facilities in Langham and our kids could even book private swimming classes. The teacher is excellent and could help our kids fine tune their skills and could see immediate results. The jaccuzi is larger than expected and water temperature is warm.

msg:I had the pleasure of staying at The Langham, Shanghai Êñ∞Â§©Âú∞ on March 26th, anticipating a comfortable and enjoyable experience. However, upon arriving at my assigned room, I was dismayed to discover that it had not been cleaned. This left me feeling disappointed and inconvenienced.

The housekeeping staff on the floor immediately apologized for the oversight and assured me that they would notify the front desk. However, I was still dissatisfied with the situation and decided to proceed to the lobby to speak with a manager.

Upon reaching the lobby, I was greeted by the warm and attentive Manager. After understanding the situation, The Lobby Manager did not attempt to deflect blame but instead offered his sincere apologies and promptly arranged for me to be transferred to a new room. To my further delight, The Manager personally escorted me to the new room and patiently introduced me to the hotel's facilities and services.

In the newly assigned room, I was met with a sense of order and cleanliness. The room was tastefully decorated, well-equipped, and exuded a cozy ambiance. I was thoroughly impressed with the hotel's cleanliness standards and the attention to detail.

While the initial hiccup with the uncleaned room was disappointing, the hotel's swift and courteous response transformed my overall experience into a positive one. The Manager genuine concern and proactive service made me feel truly valued as a guest, leaving a lasting positive impression of The Langham brand.

Two points I would like to make:  1.  if you book your trip through third party, you cannot use your stay toward your frequent stay points (not a huge deal).  2.  they do not have room to fit our family of 4.  We need to reserve two rooms.  This is because of the room type, not really anything to do with the hotel itself.

msg:A nice enough hotel, in a great location in the French Concession area of Shanghai - but didn't quite feel 5*. The staff were friendly, but the room was a bit dated and 'rough round the edges'. It just needs modernising. The TV was very old, with poor picture quality and a difficult to use remote control. I appreciated the coffee machine and tea pot, and the bath was good. I ordered a room service breakfast of hot oatmeal, but cold bircher muesli arrived and they forgot the coffee. The windows hadn't been cleaned for a while and had lots of white streaks on them which obstructed the view. Just a few attention to detail aspects were lacking. On checkout the lady who served me seemed more concerned about telling me to write a review with her name in than anything else. It is concerning when staff feel the need to push this so much. There are other hotels at this price point which I would rather stay in in future.

msg:Review scores really do not tell the whole story. Compared this against Yitel premium Shanghai - but that is really not a fair comparison as these hotels are not in the same category

Location
Right smack at Xintiandi and it overlooks DiBeiLi. Trains and malls and many shops in the region. These are however all the big branded shops which mere mortals like me would not walk into

Rooms
Completely what you would expect of a 5 start hotel. Thoughtfully designed interior, turn down service, plush interiors. And I was staying in the cheapest room type. 

Service 
Superb service right from the word go. Quick email replies. Excellent check in. World class concierge - they make such a difference. My son lost his wallet on the taxi and the staff went out of their way to help us resolve that with Didi and the driver. I am super impressed that they embrace diversity as well -  they have a vocally challenged staff as a concierge who was super enthusiastic and helpful. 

Amenities 
24 hour fully equipped gym! Chilled drinks. Fruits. Towels. 

Conclusion
I am truly impressed with The Langham and now know why people would pay more to stay here.

I did ask for Earl Grey tea ( ask in english & mandarin) finally they send me red tea. hahaha.... and it happen on both days breakfast time. The location is good and I do recommend to my colleague & friends when they travel to Shanghai.

msg:I was delighted to come back to Langham Xintiandi. It‚Äôs location is top notched.Over this weekend I experienced Hospitality at its best. I felt warmly welcomed from the moment I stepped in until check out. All the staff are very professional and friendly. The room is nice and cosy. The swimming pool is amazing and spotless.  I particularly thank Youri and Jenny for their kindness and willingness to serve me during my stay. I highly recommend Langham. It‚Äôs a fantastic brand. I Thank the whole langham team for their efforts. I am already looking forward to my next stay.

Everyone was so friendly especially Bleu the general manager . She greeted us and showed us to our room.  Nothing was too much trouble ,staff went above and beyond to take care of us during our stay.  Langham is in a stunning location , you can pop out to shop or have a drink and listen to a band. The Langham is home from home for my husband and I. I highly recommend you have your staycation here, you will be guaranteed a relaxing , 5 star experience.

msg:This was a really good hotel to stay at. The room was big, bed comfortable and the shower was amazing! The staff are friendly and help as much as they can, although I was surprised by the general lack of English for a hotel of this calibre. It didn't detract from my stay but might for someone new to the country. 
Breakfast was decent but definitely well below expectations. It is an expensive and choices are pretty limited. Also, options that are offered for room service are nowhere to be seen in the buffet. Only Earl Grey tea was available, no option for regular black tea/English breakfast or similar. 
The hotel is ideally located and easy to get to. 
Overall, it is a good luxury hotel but could definitely improve in some areas to actually justify the price.

However, we were informed when we checked in the hotel that the Club lounge has been closed for 6 months (and that is not indicated in their webpage). We were offered the service on the main bar/restaurant, but the service was extremely poor. We went to the swimming pool, but we did not use it because we saw the life guard spiting on the pool from outside it while he was walking around, like if it was a toilet. The room, dinner and specially the breakfast buffet were great.

This elegant British hotel has been open for many years but still has the flavor of years. Every design detail is in place, making people feel comfortable and relaxed. The service is also a plus. As long as you show up in the lobby, someone will care about you and help you, making you feel at home.

msg:The second Langham I checked in at was a little disappointing in Haikou. This one has a great location, and it is very convenient to go to the Bund or to several popular streets City Walk. There is everything you need for eating, drinking and having fun downstairs, and the parking lot is free, but the charging piles are not working yet, probably because they were just installed. Although the room facilities are a bit old, they are well maintained. There are a few TV channels, not many bedside sockets, and the socket holes are loose. The movement after entering the room is comfortable, and people don't feel any lag. The breakfast in Haikou felt a bit lame, so I booked it without breakfast, but I passed by the restaurant a few times and it seemed okay. I will try it next time I check in. There are many foreign friends staying here, and the service staff are not too enthusiastic. The doorman at the door was seen chatting several times. The service staff at the front desk has a good attitude and is very enthusiastic. In general, it is a hotel with good value for money. I will stay here again when I come to Shanghai in the future

It is said that some staff who put luggage can't hear it.
It may be that guests are required to be sign language teachers to meet the occupancy standards of Langham Shanghai Luxury Hotel.
Especially the dark-skinned man in the executive lounge on the 27th floor refuted me very loudly in front of my guests. Business people should not even think about working on the executive floor of Langting. It must be pornographic.
When you leave, the housekeeper will come to check if there is any consumption.
Those bottles of water in the mini bar must be worth more than 1,000 deposits
The bathtub can make mud come out, and it is not disinfected

The only troublesome part is writing positive reviews. Employees on different floors are all the same. Customers can write good reviews. Let‚Äôs not talk about whether the customer is an I person. From a motivational point of view, shouldn‚Äôt it be the guest‚Äôs initiative to write good reviews? Employees who should only be responsible for service have to worry about the hotel's positive reviews. Should hotel leaders think about how to improve the hotel's positive reviews through other methods? Instead of simply letting the already hard-working waiters roll each other's rolls. Think about how to add personalized menus (children's meals/senior meals, etc.), strengthen hardware facilities (such as replacing Dyson hair dryers), etc., which are all good points.

I didn‚Äôt take any pictures of the bathroom, but it was very comfortable and Xiaobao even took a bath.

In such a superior location in Xintiandi, the hotel facilities and environment greatly exceeded expectations compared to the price. The breakfast is rich, the hotel staff are very good and well-educated; even the aunt who cleans the room is very polite. I like the Langham very much and will come back next time! Loretta, Judy and Johnny at the front desk were attentive and gave us a great experience. Thank you!

The TV is too small and cannot be projected onto the screen. It is just a decoration. The bathtub does not have a disposable bathtub cover. I ordered the one I bought and took two baths. There should be no fresh air system. The room is very stuffy. The location is good, close to the subway. In addition, the room is subject to a separate service fee.

I called the front desk and it took a long time before I was picked up. A woman asked me to change the pillowcases myself and said that the pillows were only in our room. Fortunately, we had them. The room service was good. When they gave us bath salts, they helped me change them. I called a takeaway guy in the middle of the night and said that he would inform the front desk and he would bring them to me. But after waiting for 10 minutes, I didn't go down and saw the guy at the front desk. He just sat there blankly. I don't know what to ask. The manager also listened to the comments and apologized when checking out. I hope there will be improvements in the future, but I should stay in another hotel next time.

Soon, a staff member came up with the room card to help change the room. The turndown service is also very good.

I like the Langham room and bed the most. The Langham bed is very comfortable to sleep on. There are also large floor-to-ceiling windows in the room, and the viewing experience is great.
What is worthy of praise is that the supplies used in the Langham room are of very good quality. The shampoo leaves the hair with unparalleled luster and fragrance.
The lobby is also low-key, luxurious and tasteful. The New Year decorations also feel very in line with the characteristics of Langham.
The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful. I arrived in the middle of the night and the front desk staff even helped me pick up my luggage and sent it to my room. I was very touched! thank you all

msg:I stayed at Langham for a week this time and the whole experience was very good.
When we first checked in, we had an early flight and arrived at the hotel at 6 a.m., so the room we reserved was not ready yet. The staff at the front desk saw that we had children with us and made some adjus**ents so that we could enter the room early to rest. The additional half-day fee is calculated based on half of the preferential price when I booked. Because the price on that day was actually higher than the price we booked in advance. In fact, if they didn't tell us, we wouldn't know, but they took the initiative to tell the guests, so the first impression was very good.
And throughout the entire check-in process, the response to any needs was very fast. The food produced by the restaurant depar**ent is very good, and the food delivered to the room is arranged very pleasing to the eye. The employees we met were very polite, especially Zoe, the manager of the executive club Langham Club, and her team. We can feel that they have a high level of professionalism. The customer service is meticulous, warm and polite, making people feel warm. Thank you also to their entire team for taking care of the children during our stay. Including that we accidentally left a few small things at the hotel after checking out, Zoe also helped us send them to other cities, which was great.
I would also like to thank Sister Sun from the housekeeping depar**ent. She tidies the room carefully and meticulously every time and never disturbs us. Because it was too dry in winter and my child had a nosebleed, we just mentioned it. When we returned to the hotel that day, we found that there was an extra humidifier in the room, which was really heartwarming. When we left the store, we left a note of thanks and a gift for Sister Sun, hoping she would receive it. We just want her to know that we respect her work and appreciate her dedication and dedication.
The staff at Langham Hotel made our week in Shanghai very enjoyable, thank you! See you next time üòä

msg:The hotel is in a very good location, just opposite Xintiandi.
The little yellow duck suite I booked is on the executive floor, and the happy snacks and afternoon tea in the executive lounge are good.
The lobby is relatively small, and there are many tables in the breakfast room that are not stable and wobbly, and no waiter seems to be paying attention.
The breakfast place is not big, and there are not too many varieties, but they are all exquisitely prepared. The fried rice cakes are not bad.
Although the room is said to be a suite, it is very small, and the space for the slide rack is even smaller. The biggest problem is that there is not enough storage space. There are switches and sockets on both sides of the bed that can be used as drawers. They have to be folded down halfway before they can be used, making them easy to get knocked around at night. Very inconvenient.
Another area I want to complain about is the lighting control. There is no separate control switch for the lights in the room. There are only a few light and dark theme switches. It takes a long time to try every time, which is very inconvenient. There is no bedside reading lamp, so it is difficult to read in the room at night because it is too dark.
After reading the introduction, I found out that the hotel is a British group. I feel that the style is intended to be high-end, but unfortunately the details are not in place. The air conditioning outlet on the ceiling of the bathroom was very dirty and stained with rust. Although the toilet is sensor-controlled and can spray water, the edge of the seat cushion is yellowed. If you look closely, the water outlet below is very dirty and black, which makes your pupils tremble. It is recommended that the hotel strengthen management in this regard, details determine everything.

msg:The first time I wrote a review on Ctrip, it was still a negative review. You can imagine how angry I was. Not to mention the decoration of the hotel is old, the main reason is that the layout is strange. The space between the bed and the toilet was too narrow, so I was hit when I walked past the bed when I came out of the toilet. My legs were bruised by the sharp corner of the bed, and they were all blue the next day. Moreover, there is a large wall above the floor-to-ceiling windows, which affects the view.

This is not because I was careless when walking. Before I was injured, the corner of the bed had been bumped into countless times by others, and the decorative leather had already been damaged. You can imagine how many customers in front of me were injured like me.

However, when I went to the front desk to report a problem, the staff member ignored me at first, and I kept talking to him. He had no choice but to ask for the manager on duty, and then said that the manager on duty was not there. After a while, the manager miraculously was there again. Yes, he sent me a box of mooncakes to express his kindness and upgrade me to a better one next time (ps: I was very comfortable living in Shenzhen and directly upgraded to a high-floor executive suite. There is nothing here in Shanghai), but I After having such an experience, how could it happen again?

The location of the hotel is very good, you can go to Xintiandi just across the road, and you can go shopping at any time. The environment and sanitation of the hotel are very good, the staff is very enthusiastic, highly recommended!

msg:The check-in experience is not bad, the hotel environment decoration and room service are all very good.

In addition to the unreliable front lobby reception, I arrived at 9:00 in the morning and told the front desk that if there is a room that can be checked out first, I will check in first, because I have just returned to China and I am jet-lagged. The front desk said yes, about 12:00 It‚Äôs safer to come back at 1 o‚Äôclock (I‚Äôve been in the hotel industry since 2011, believe me, according to the theory of probability, it‚Äôs impossible for a hotel‚Äôs double room to check out before 10 o‚Äôclock on the same day)

When I came back after 12:00, the front desk told me that the room was not ready yet, so I was really upset. Why, because the check-out time of the hotel is usually 11-12 o‚Äôclock, the room is cleaned for 40 minutes, and the foreman checks the room for 20 minutes . Let‚Äôs just assume that if a double bed room is not cleaned after 12 o‚Äôclock, then the hotel needs to configure several guest rooms to clean all the rooms that the hotel checks out on the same day in less than 2 hours for customers to check in at 3 o‚Äôclock ? So, I left the front desk and swiped my phone for 20 minutes, then went back to the front desk, asked another person, and he immediately helped me check in. At this time, the front desk, which had been delayed for N hours, came and said that the room had just been cleaned , üôÑÔ∏è, I really believe it, but anyway, so be it.

There will be no good reviews. Of course, I know that from the perspective of the rules, you should check in after three o'clock, but the hotel is a hotel for people, right? The reasonable requirements of customers should be met, right? It doesn't make sense to make things difficult for customers, right? If you are capable, you will get stuck in all the rooms and check in after three o'clock collectively, otherwise you will give the room regardless of your mood.

Let‚Äôs talk about the front desk service: when a man stays at the receptionist, there is no enthusiasm that should be there. Some things that should be explained are similar to where to eat breakfast the next day, what time does it start, and where does the elevator go up to the check-in room? Did not say. I just gave the room card coldly, that's all. When checking out, another man received him with a worse attitude. Is this the service Langham should have? Won't be back for a second series!

I checked in at the hotel around 8:00 p.m., and Tommy Ma checked in with a very good attitude and kindness. He took the initiative to upgrade me to a suite, and he explained everything about breakfast in detail.
There are toiletries in the room, and the placement of things is also very user-friendly. I usually suffer from severe insomnia, but the bed in the room is still very good, and I slept soundly.
The breakfast is also great, it is all steamed and cooked, and the waiters in every position of the hotel are very nice!
Overall, I give the hotel full marks, and it is worthy of being an old-fashioned five-star hotel~

msg:A friend‚Äôs 60th birthday, based on a good impression of Hefei Langham, temporarily decided to put it in Xintiandi Langham. Loretta Sharon Zora, the hotel‚Äôs customer service ambassador team, understood the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúentanglement‚Äù that is not suitable for publicity and commemorative at this age. , the rooms are decorated in a low-key and warm way, and the Langham comes standard with pink roses. It can be seen that the business of the hotel is booming, and there are all kinds of guests, such as travel and business, and sometimes it is too busy. We also understand that, after all, it is the core area of ‚Äã‚ÄãXintiandi, but they still actively meet the needs of the guests. My friends are very surprised and moved.
From the executive lounge, to the front desk, concierge, room service, swimming pool gym, and breakfast room, as long as there are qualified and experienced staff, they are all very nice, and you can see the accumulation of daily training. The swimming pool is open from 6:30 in the morning to 11:00 in the evening, which is also a very long time.
Although the hardware in the guest rooms and public areas is not as impressive as that of new hotels, they can still be managed in an orderly manner after more than ten years. Although the suite is not big, it has an artistic a**osphere and a sense of design. The bedside three-in-one charging cable, storage box, washlet and other details are full; the room and corridor have a slight smell, which may be caused by the old carpet, or Some bedroom air conditioners are noisy, but this does not affect Xintiandi Fenguo, which deserves its name, like a vintage wine.
If there are poems and books hidden in the heart, time will never defeat the beauty. Five-star recommendation~

The hotel has a strategic location, with Xintiandi downstairs, abundant shopping resources, its own parking space, and the room is clean and smell-free.

Especially the hotel's service, I don't think it is inferior to other hotels with higher prices and higher star ratings. The kids don't even want to leave and want to live here. Hope to keep it up!

Breakfast is average, variety and taste.
Service is also average. The sense of distance is obvious.

Yes, I was talking about a woman who called in the early morning and spoke English first. How bad is it? Woolen cloth. I asked if it was the front desk, and she said she was not the front desk, I forgot the specific position, anyway, her phone number is on the hotel business card, she is not the front desk, but it is a similar position! Ask her the front desk number, the first time because my friend‚Äôs voice just overwhelmed her, she immediately said it the second time impatiently, I didn‚Äôt understand it well, let her say it again, that attitude is simple, word by word Raise your voice, tone full of disgust and instantly make me think I owe her money? Wouldn't it be good to report the phone numbers directly in sequence? What do you have to say about 2 3s and 3 0s, blah blah blah! Again, this hotel may only be thinking about serving foreigners, and the operation of the toilet is all in English! From this detail alone, it can be seen that they give priority to serving foreigners! At the beginning, I greeted you in English first, so I wanted to ask, if you were a foreigner today, would you, a hotel staff, have this attitude? ? Stop serving foreigners for too long, treat yourself as a foreigner, okay? I only know that I have a bad attitude towards Chinese people, so noble, please don't open a hotel in China!

msg:As a Langting voyager customer, I have lived in Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Hefei, so I am qualified to talk about it.

Facilities: Too old. It has not been renovated since it opened more than ten years ago. Is it because the money is too easy to earn? The POS machine at the front desk is full of dust, the walls are mottled, the sofa is off the line, this is still a room of more than 1600, and the faucet is leaking. Is this the level of Shanghai Xintiandi?

Hygiene: That's it, it can only be considered basically clean

Environment: The hotel is relatively small, understandably, the room design is quite weird, the big sofa is in a dark corner, and the room has a strange corner. Is this to play hide-and-seek?

Service: very average. Arrived at the hotel after four o'clock, told me that the high floors were not cleaned properly, I said I was a member, but the front desk said that I couldn't find it, and I needed to teach you the problem that can be solved by entering a mobile phone number? The attitude of the telephone customer service is blunt and not proficient in business. I asked where the breakfast card was and told me to bring it to me. After a minute, I called me and said that I can only scan the code. I ordered a set meal and had to call to let me choose coffee or tea. That being the case, why should we eliminate the breakfast card?

It is commendable that the Chinese food, I am in a hurry but it is really delicious

The gap between Shenzhen and Shenzhen is really too big, from hardware to service, it is almost beaten

First of all, I would like to thank Mr. August. Zhao from the Marketing Depar**ent for introducing us to the high-quality hotel and giving us the opportunity to stay in your hotel. After checking in, we felt the high-standard service. We had our exclusive housekeeper, Ms. Jenny, who followed up the whole process. Miss Jenny will take care of our needs according to our heart. Such as sending flowers and taking pictures for us. Ms. Vera saw my sister taking pictures and took the initiative to take pictures of my sister, which is very suitable for us. The chef in the executive lounge and the restaurant staff are very kind. They are enthusiastic and active in their work, which made us feel very happy during our stay... We will stay at The Langham, Shanghai again in the future.

msg:When I washed up in the morning, all the water coming out of the faucet was light yellow sewage (see video below). After washing, I found out that it was caused by the water outage, maintenance or contamination. When I reported it to the front desk, they were indifferent and said that they would have someone fix it. After repeated requests, I was given a room for temporary washing.
Because the light yellow sewage was not obvious under the light, two people had red rashes on their faces and body after the sewage came into contact with their skin. We will continue to observe the follow-up, and if there are any problems, we will investigate them to the end!

In addition, the hotel's service attitude is very indifferent and extremely double standards. If you think Shanghai's service is like this, you can squat at the front desk when they receive foreigners, and you will experience what double standards mean on the spot. When I checked in, there was no smiling face at the front desk the whole time. After the foreigners checked in, I used all my life's knowledge to speak five English greetings at the front desk. It really made the foreigners feel at home!

The hotel facilities are comparable to those of an ordinary four-star hotel. Every corner must be a sanitary blind spot, especially the bathroom and the foyer.

This time I went to the Shanghai Museum to see the exhibition, and I directly chose the Langham, Xintiandi. It was a good experience as always.
The location is excellent, there are subways and supermarkets nearby, and you can walk directly to Shanghai Expo in about 15 minutes.
There are a lot of delicious food nearby. After dinner at night, you can take a stroll in Xintiandi, which is very comfortable.
The rooms of The Langham Hotel have a good sense of design, very comfortable bedding, electric curtains, smart toilets, bathtubs, double washbasins, and walk-in closets are all available.
The hotel service personnel are of high quality and enthusiastic. From welcome, front desk to room service, they are very thoughtful and reassuring.
Brian Chen and a lady at the front desk, who checked us in and checked out, were polite, professional and patient, and brought us a wonderful experience.

Besides hygiene, the things put there are stained with toothpaste that has been dried for a long time. I even took away the toothbrush one day and didn't put it in again. It took 20 minutes to ask the customer service to get it in the morning. The facilities are also dilapidated. In the end, the hotel checked out, and the deposit refund was difficult...

When I returned to the room at night, I found that it still hadn't been replaced.

Although there are many people, the lady next door still keeps smiling and patiently explains to the guests. I must give it a thumbs up! The package that was originally taken can be upgraded to the room type, so there is no need to think about it on the day... The lobby on the first floor is relatively small. When the door is opened, the cold wind blows to the queue area. It is very uncomfortable.

From the front desk in the lobby to the relevant departments, the service is thoughtful and meticulous, and responsive to every request (Ms. Yang Yeli at the front desk is especially outstanding). Morning tea and evening afternoon tea ~ beautiful enjoyment! Stayed for 3 days during the Spring Festival of 23 from New Year's Eve to the second day of the ***** New Year; slept comfortably, ate deliciously, and traveled happily (Xintiandi is just across the road / Huaihai Road is very convenient) I have mobilized relatives and friends to come to Langham!

msg:During the Spring Festival holiday, I chose to spend the New Year at The Langham Hotel with my family. The Langham Hotel still maintains a professional service concept as always. Whether it is the check-in staff, waiters, or chefs in the restaurant, the service is very good and professional. During the check-in process, I unexpectedly received a call from youri from guest relations. It turned out that she carefully learned about my nephew's birthday, and she thoughtfully sent a cake and a handwritten greeting card. Thank you very much. The hotel's environment, sanitation, and location are all first-class, meeting the standards of a five-star hotel, but I think the most commendable thing is the hotel's service concept. Whether it is a business trip or a vacation with the family, it is highly recommended.

If so, it is better not to buy an executive room.
The bathroom bathtub and shower in the hotel are not well designed.
The location of the hotel is excellent. In the busy city, Xintiandi has a lot of delicious food. It is very convenient to go shopping and visit historical sites around.
Hotel B1 has a great swimming pool, very clean and hygienic, and the swimming pool water is very clear. There are sauna and sweat steaming in the changing room. There is also a hot tub by the pool. The security guard is very responsible, and guards the whole process when there is only one person in the morning.
The breakfast is average, at an average level. The hot stalls are freshly cooked, and there is an omelet in the omelet area.
Overall it is recommended.

msg:Everyone has described the room facilities and parking in a relatively comprehensive way, and talk about the administrative courtesy. At present, the executive lounge on the 27th floor is not open, and the administrative trea**ent is at the Triumph restaurant on the first floor (now the Triumph restaurant does not open traditional self-service). The environment is good: all-weather coffee and tea utensils are professional, high-quality materials, San Pellegrino sparkling water and Puna Mineral water is optional. The administrative trea**ent afternoon tea has a relatively small set, which is comparable to the products sold outside. Some of them use duck liver, black truffle, etc., which are rich in taste, and the scones are still hot. You can also order freshly squeezed juice in the beverage section. There were very few executive guests on the happy hour part, so a small buffet was opened: the smoked salmon for cold meals is of high quality, the secret pork ribs, cheese scallops and potato wedges are of a la carte quality, and the staple food is divided according to the position (tomato Italian Dumplings) and example soup (potato and bacon soup) are all you can eat. The four hot dishes may be produced by Tang Court, with first-class seasoning. The western food chefs are making dishes at the open cooking table next door. At the same time, one of the freshly baked pizzas is delivered to the Room Service, and the other is added to the Happy hour. In addition, during the executive check-in period, you can experience the "small powder car" for free. The one-way distance is up to 5 kilometers. It is good to eat out nearby, and you can make an appoin**ent in advance.

In summary, five-star praise, give Langham service a thumbs up, especially youri, jenny, and vera! Issac and tommy at the front desk, and Fernando the manager! After check-in, baby toothbrush, care and slippers are all available~ Because the family member accidentally split their fingernails, the nail clippers were quickly put in place after a phone call, thank you Langham for your thoughtful service!

When checking in, the handsome guy at the front desk said that you can enjoy a discounted price if you add breakfast. One person is 200 yuan, so I agreed to add one. The size of the room is small, and it is difficult to take care of the shower and bathtub in the bathroom. I personally don't understand this design. The hotel staff I have met, whether they are room cleaning aunts, restaurant waiters or welcome guests, will greet guests with a smile on their faces. For breakfast, there are small wontons with shrimp meat, siu mai with shrimps in small cages, steamed bun noodles, etc. There are also freshly squeezed carrot juice, watermelon juice and various breads. There are not many varieties, but the taste is not bad. I am very satisfied.

msg:The last time I stayed in a hotel before the epidemic was relaxed, I didn‚Äôt leave Shanghai. I booked two suites at the Langham, Xintiandi, and took my parents to spend an early stay togetherüéÑ~

üå≥Environment introduction:
After all, it has been open for a few years, and it has a classic feel like an old hotel. It is still very suitable for taking the elders there~


üè†Layout/room type:
When we checked in, the front desk saw that we were bringing elderly people with us, so they offered to put us on the same floor for easier care, so we were given a master suite and a business suite~
üè†The master bedroom suite is one bedroom and one living room. The bedroom has a sliding door that can be closed, and the living room can be used to chat and play cards (or have meetings)~
üè†The business suite is a large room with an oversized bathroom and a signature barrel bathtub. However, because the hotel is a bit old, the bathtub looks a bit old, so we didn‚Äôt take a bath [cover face][cover face]

üíÅFacility services:
The suite I stayed in this time came with executive benefits. You can have afternoon tea, dinner, and breakfast in the executive lounge~ But! ! ! The executive lounge is not open due to the epidemic! ! ! So I could only go to the lobby bar for afternoon tea and the breakfast room for dinner, which was quite disappointing...
Afternoon tea is a set meal for two people, a double-decker set plus 2 drinks. It is not very delicious, but it is good to sit in the lobby bar and chat and feel the Chris**as a**osphere~
There isn‚Äôt much for dinner, just noodle stalls with some simple dishes and sushi. It‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre full. If you want to eat better, you can go to the Tang Pavilion upstairs~~
You can eat breakfast while sitting in the afternoon tea area. The environment will be better. Breakfast includes xiaolongbao and eight-treasure rice. It is more Shanghai-style~~ and what‚Äôs better is that there is freshly cut ham. I don‚Äôt know if it is 5j. But it tastes pretty good~

GMS: There are very few people in the gym and swimming pool! Recommended to go~~~

üèùTIPS for surrounding travel:
Across the road is Xintiandi and very close to Yu Garden on the Bund. I highly recommend this hotel to friends traveling to Shanghai for business~~

msg:As far as hotels of the same price are concerned, it is not recommended.
I just moved back from London with a lot of luggage, so I deliberately chose a relatively high-quality hotel just for the sake of service. Can't believe that hotels in Xintiandi circle in Shanghai have such rubbish service.

When you arrive at the store, there is no one to help you carry your luggage and get off the bus. There were many people in suits standing at the door, and I yelled at the crowd many times who was the hotel staff, but no one answered.

I ran into the lobby and found no one. The two uniformed people closest to the gate told me the hotel counter had to go inside, so who were these? ? Which hotel is opened by someone else's staff? ? Which hotel doesn't have any hotel personnel standing outside? ? ? ? ? ? ?

There was no one running around in the lobby, and the two staff at the door who didn't know which one told me to look for someone outside. I ran outside to call the buddy again. A middle-aged man in uniform who was from the hotel clearly heard me calling him. I don‚Äôt know if he deliberately ignored me (not the deaf-mute staff in the hotel lobby). When I made physical contact, he patted his arm. Asking for help, he told me to find someone else to carry my luggage. something? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Is it because I tried to yell a fast car and I don't deserve to be opened by you? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! !

The Langham, Shanghai, garbage among garbage.

The hotel's compensation is a pot of fruit. die laughing. What I need is a few dollars for your fruit?

The hotel guests are messy, and the lobby is always noisy, which has nothing to do with high-end. Like an Internet celebrity restaurant, the a**osphere is smoky and has nothing to do with high class.


Facilities: Garbage. There is no high-end brand of supporting washing and care products. The decoration has a sense of age


Service: The garbage in the garbage is worse than the average homestay

msg:First of all, there is nothing to say about the location, the downstairs is Xintiandi. Other than that it's all bad!

The room types are full during the peak tourist season, and none of the staff at the front desk has a smiling face, which is understandable.

This is the first time I saw the hotel "hide" the slippers. After entering the room and searching for a long time, I couldn't find the slippers. I even called the front desk to find out that they were in the drawer of the wardrobe with the door closed. That's right, it was inside the drawer! Are these slippers so precious?

The curtains in the bathroom are electric outdoors. When I took a shower, I found that the curtains were not closed tightly, and there was a big gap at the bottom! The luxuriously decorated floor-to-ceiling glass windows of the bathroom are facing the glass windows of the opposite building! So speechless! After telling the hotel to deal with it, there is no response

The next day we were still sleeping in the room, and the electricity in the whole room suddenly stopped. The switch and air conditioner did not respond. The front desk responded, "Our room has 24-hour power supply and will not run out of electricity." The engineering staff knew it was a trip when they entered the door. (It's not our problem that we don't have any electricity except for the mobile phone charger), I don't know how old the facility is and how many problems there are in the room!

The cleaning of the room is also uncomfortable. After staying in so many hotels, few aunts will move personal belongings. The toothbrush and nursing supplies we brought are well arranged. I don‚Äôt know where the aunt found a piece of veil for us. Take off the toothbrush and lay everything on it in a row. We don't want to use this toothbrush anymore. .

Too much damage to the image of an established hotel, and I will definitely not stay at The Langham, Xintiandi next time.

Children like it very much. The swimming pool is almost reserved and very beautiful. When I came back at night, I found that the hotel thoughtfully sent a birthday cake.
I have to say that Langham's service is excellent, especially Jackson, everything is arranged in an orderly manner, which makes people feel very considerate. The rest of the staff are also very friendly and live up to their brand.
Although the buffet is not rich, it tastes very good. When leaving, the children are reluctant to part with each other. I hope to stay again next time.

The bread for breakfast is freshly made and baked. The room is efficient and the front desk staff is very friendly. I learned that the room was specially decorated after the wedding anniversary. I am very moved. All the staff I met in the hotel will take the initiative to say hello to you. The swimming pool is super nice and the decoration style is low-key and luxurious. The underwater music is very comfortable. There are still very few key people who are convinced.

The yellow seats in the room are really comfortable, and the space design is also very good. Very innovative, except that the space is a bit awkward to blow against the bed. The point is that the TV in the room should really be changed. It is too old. Many channels have snowflakes, which is really not in line with the grade of the hotel. The check-in attitude at the front desk is very good, and the room type orientation and late check-out requirements can be agreed. The hotel's lounge is not open, so hh and afternoon tea are in the lobby. The food is very good. Afternoon tea can be ordered directly for a set of hh dishes. The service of the hotel staff is also very good. If you are alone If you eat afternoon tea, the amount is really large. You should allow guests to pack and bring back the unfinished part to the room. Otherwise, it would be too wasteful. It is self-service and you can control how much you can take in the lobby, and you can't finish it all. Finally, I want to talk about the hotel's breakfast. The dining environment is very good and the sun shines in. It's very comfortable. The point is that there is beef ramen made on the spot. The quality of the ramen noodles on the spot is still very different. I hope that next time I have the opportunity to stay again, I can experience the swimming pool of the hotel. The overall stay experience is still great.

msg:Very pleasant stay experience. Take the children to the hotel to check in and relax during the summer vacation, and chose the Langham Hotel this week. On the one hand, it is very close to a large site, and at the same time, some restaurants around want to check in. The hotel's view overlooks Taiping Lake and Xintiandi, and the style of the old Shikumen is very Shanghai characteristic. Downstairs is Xintiandi. Although the flow of people has dropped a lot compared to before the epidemic, I can feel that the fireworks are returning. The quality of the hotel's swimming pool and restaurant is as good as ever, and the service in every detail is also very good. In the evening, I went to check in the next Sichuan restaurant Ma Liuji, which was a good experience. The staff at the front desk are very professional and kind, and when they saw children on a trip, they also gave away chocolates. Will be back next time.

msg:I had a weekend getaway in the city. Overall, I am satisfied with it. Let‚Äôs talk about the pros and cons.
advantage:
1. The location is right in the central business district of Xintiandi, making it very convenient to go shopping;
2. The executive courtesy afternoon tea and happy hour produce good products. Although there are not many varieties, the taste is not bad. There are freshly squeezed juices in the afternoon, and there are quite a lot of hot snacks in the evening. You can make small wontons or noodles freshly;
3. The small soup pool next to the swimming pool is very warm and suitable for children to take a dip;
4. The service is very considerate. I called at 10 o'clock in the evening to reserve a pink car for the next day. The concierge was already off work, but they still confirmed the reply quickly. We also gave small gifts to the children when checking out, thank you Jenny and Brian. The pink car is worth experiencing, and children find it very novel.
shortcoming:
1. I arrived at around 3pm and got the room at almost 5pm, which was a bit late;
2. Traffic jams are serious around weekends, and it takes a long time to queue at the parking lot entrance. You may consider taking the subway;
3. Although I live on a high floor, I can still hear the roar of cars sometimes.

He greeted us in place, checked us in in advance, gave us breakfast for children, and gave us gifts when we left. Thanks for this!
The hotel has complete facilities, the room layout is reasonable, and the city center is very expensive. It is very good to be able to design this in a limited area. The swimming pool is great (there are both dry and wet steam rooms in the locker room, and the equipment is neat), the location of the room is very good, the hotel does not want to drive, and it is very convenient to take a taxi anywhere. The breakfast is also very good, with a complete range of hot items, and the current ramen noodles with beef tendon is very good.
Looking forward to staying again next time!

msg:Stayed two nights with mixed feelings. Everything was fine on the first day. The lobby manager was very enthusiastic when checking in and gave a detailed introduction. Although the hardware facilities in the room are a bit old, they are well maintained. I slept well the first night, the bed was neither soft nor hard, and the bedding was more comfortable. The breakfast is average, but the service is good.

But the second night was miserable. After a busy day, I wanted to rest early, but since 10:30, I heard a man and a woman talking and laughing from the next door or upstairs and downstairs. But I opened the door and ran into the corridor, but no sound was heard. Called the front desk, the staff said it would be dealt with, but it has not stopped. I plan to endure it and forget it, but who would have guessed that from 11:30, the woman came on the stage, and the sound was absolutely overwhelming, and I felt that the sound insulation was similar to that of an express hotel. I recorded two paragraphs, everyone can listen to it... I made a phone call three times, but it still hasn't been resolved. Then I thought, what if I knew which guest was making the sound? The hotel told people, please keep your voice as low as possible while enjoying your physical and mental pleasure? So I put on my clothes and went downstairs to the front desk of the hotel. The little guy at the front desk pursed his lips and smiled after hearing what happened to me, and prepared a room for me with no one around. So I went back to my room to pack up and moved to the new room, it was past 12 midnight...

After selection, I finally chose The Langham, Xintiandi, Shanghai, and I was fortunate to have a night before check-in. I saw the activities of the hotel's executive room on the app, so I replaced the previously booked superior room with an executive room. I have to say that although it is a few hundred more expensive, it is very worth it. There are parent-child spa, small gift baskets for watching movies... and more Thanks to the customer service ambassador Jenny, who is very considerate. When I saw me alone with my baby, they recommended their Langham's special small powder car to me, saying that they could take us to nearby places, so I experienced a turnaround and look forward to the next one. Check in!

msg:The Langham Hotel's geographical advantage in Xintiandi is a perfect score. However, the professional quality of the front desk staff of the hotel needs to be improved. The little brother at the front desk who received me did not understand the additional benefits of Ctrip orders, and he clearly arranged for me a superior double room instead of the upgraded deluxe double room in the Ctrip order and did not inform me in person. , this experience is not very good.
The swimming pool of the hotel is quite good, and it also has a heated massage pool, where the baby can swim.
The breakfast is normal. There are not many varieties, and the taste is not bad.
The room facilities are not new, but I will give 75 points to live at this price.

We chose a buffet in the evening. Question: There are not many dishes to choose from, not even a small hot pot. How do you eat the cold seafood in the smoothie? The fruit in the five-star hotel buffet actually smells bad, and it needs to be improved. The manager of this hotel is inappropriate. During the festival, the price has almost tripled, while the Andaz next door is still the original price, not to mention other people's dishes are not worse than yours, and there is a small hot pot.
So the result was that the buffet that day had more than three times the number of customers.
Don't treat customers like fools.
But the service attitude is quite good, I feel at home, especially Mr. Darren has been standing next to the service, thank you

msg:This hotel is what I have the greatest expectations for. In the comments, I found that everyone praised his executive lounge, but after checking in, the evaluation of its executive lounge may be the same as that. Plant it.
After all, the accommodation hardware is already classified to the level of the old hotel echelon, but in that echelon it also belongs to the middle and upper classes.
Let's talk about the lounge. It may be because of the holidays, there are still more guests enjoying administrative services, so there is no advantage in the service. There is no problem with the taste of the meal, but the timeliness of the supplement needs to be further strengthened. Another point is that there is no receptionist at the entrance of the lounge, so that after letting guests pick up their own meals and find a seat, they have to change to a different waiter to ask for the guest's room number, which is not very common in other hotels. situation that can be seen.
In general, the quality of service cannot be reduced because the number of guests increases. Considering that it is difficult to increase the number of waiters simultaneously during the holidays, after all, many people from other places have also returned to their hometowns, but at least there must be a plan. By providing Compensatory services in other areas or proper diversion are also a method.

üßπHygiene: The hotel's hygiene should be okay. Because I was too tired from going to Disneyland on Chris**as, I didn't pay too much attention and cleaned everything that needed to be cleaned.

üçÉEnvironment: There is nothing to say about the hotel environment. There are K11, Xintiandi and other shopping malls nearby. You can go directly to Xintiandi downstairs and there are many restaurants to choose from. There is Taipingqiao Park not far away. You can see Taiping Lake from the room. Overall great.
üîîService: Generally speaking, the Langham Hotel's service is standardized, but it lacks a bit of human touch. In the early morning of the day of check-out, there was a huge roar from construction outside. I was woken up at 5:30 in the morning. The responsible party was not in the hotel because I went out to have a look and it was really difficult to solve. At the same time, the hotel also provided corresponding compensation. However, when checking out, there was no greeting from the hotel front desk about the quality of the guests' sleep. It was just a programmed operation that lacked warmth and human touch. This made it difficult for people to choose to stay again.

The hotel still has many advantages, such as the room design, which adopts a zigzag structure and multiple sliding door designs, which increases guests' interest in room exploration and makes a 40-square-meter room feel like a 50-plus-square-meter room. This is worthy of praise. The bathroom design is also very good, the drainage is excellent, and the bathtub is also very comfortable, because when I placed the order, I specifically requested that the bathtub be clean and there would be no stains when I touch it. The buckwheat pillows provided by the hotel are also good. I don't feel bloated when I wake up. It's a little high, but it doesn't affect my sleep. When checking in, he was very enthusiastic and proactive in helping to take the luggage to the front desk, which was great. This service is no longer available when leaving the store. Maybe different employees have different service awareness.

Generally speaking, Langham is very suitable for business trips. It is quite satisfactory, nothing too outstanding, and nothing too bad.

msg:The location of the hotel is unique, and the environment and service of the executive lounge are also very good. The following is an objective statement of the shortcomings: First, the room and living room of the master bedroom suite I booked were very small and depressing. After switching to the business suite, I could only laugh at it, because it is a standard room and there is no independent living room. Since the staff in the lounge warmly helped me change rooms, I am too embarrassed to say anything else; the second is that the lobby and elevator of the hotel are together with the open all-day dining restaurant, and there is a strong smell of oily smoke; third The gym and swimming pool are on the ground floor. It may be because of the water vapor in the swimming pool. The whole environment is too humid and a little breathless. Let's talk about an extra episode. I don't know where the "Golden Key" concierge manager invited by the hotel, and the posture of owing him money is very uncomfortable (haha, I understand it)! !

Take a few children to swim, the staff is like a thief! Responsibility is a good thing, but it's too much. Several children have been playing in the swimming lane on the side. The floating board floated inside and swam over to take it. The staff then said not to hinder others from swimming; the pool was originally small and the sound of the water was loud, and the children occasionally laughed a lot when they were playing happily. , Then don't shout loudly, our parents are right by the side, even if you don't say, we will tell the children! Jumping in the water a few times is not enough...In short, you must swim quietly in the water to meet the requirements of the staff ~ I have never encountered such a swimming pool before, and I will not come to live again in the future! ! !

If you want to be angry, come to live in Lang Ting. I have a good temper, and I didn't get angry on the spot.
1‚É£Ô∏èThe electronic scale in the room is broken, I asked my aunt to replace it, and my aunt shouted: No, I can't find it, so late. The time is 8pm.
2‚É£Ô∏èConcierge check out and pick up luggage: A man from the concierge shouted to me loudly: Where is your luggage tag, did you lose it? Show me! Attitude like a dean scolding students
3‚É£Ô∏èWhen checking in, the male staff member was also very arrogant and could not hear clearly. He was too lazy to repeat it a second time, his voice was very low and tugging.
The first time I encountered a five star, from top to bottom, such a rubbish attitude.
Also the room was small, the whole hotel was small, ridiculously small. The elevator hall is one-sixth the size of a Waldorf Astoria. Downstairs is the smell of kitchen fumes.

I'll check out and change to another hotel now.

I threw away the used and dirty towels in the towel basket. When I took a shower at night, I felt that the towel was cold at first, so I went to look at the new hand towel, and it turned out to be the one that was dirty yesterday and didn't change. I would like to know if it is normal for the hotel to not replace the used and dirty ones, or is it a deliberate act? Call the front desk and say it will respond to the situation. It looks like it should be a normal operation. Now it gives me the feeling that new customers may not be disinfected after check-out.

msg:The location of hotel facilities and general services are not bad, the location is particularly convenient
A little episode solved but the impression is very bad
The process is to clarify floors 17-27 above the premium executive room booked by Ctrip (if you want to stay at a high point to see the night view, so pay attention to the floor when you book) The 10th floor of the room is different from the room layout. Strangely asked the front desk clearly stated that the hotel system showed that the deluxe room that I booked was also upgraded to the administrative trea**ent. I said that it did not match the order I paid. After repeated confirmation, I replied that I booked a deluxe room. It‚Äôs impossible to change to a smaller executive floor room
The communication skills are instantly irritating. I also made it clear. If it‚Äôs a problem with Ctrip, I‚Äôll come to Ctrip‚Äôs customer service to communicate if something is wrong. If it‚Äôs a problem with the hotel, I can‚Äôt accept what I paid for the solution. I have to stay in a standard room that meets the specifications, otherwise I can‚Äôt accept it and ask the hotel if there is a room with the same specifications as marked on Ctrip. The other party said that there is, but I did not say that I ordered it instead of showing him my Ctrip order. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with you. Finally, after a long dispute, I got promoted to a suite.
It seems that I didn‚Äôt suffer from this, but I didn‚Äôt come to stay in the hotel to take advantage or quarrel. I just asked to enjoy the corresponding trea**ent of my consumption, but it made me feel like I was making trouble. It is recommended that the front desk pay attention to training and communication. The attitude is good, but the problem is not handled. Know how to work
In addition, the welcome fruit I gave at the time after changing the room was not taken up. I left a bottle of unopened soda in the room and didn‚Äôt take it up. Obviously it brought emotions to deal with the problem and it was unpleasant.
I will stay somewhere else next time. Anyway, the hotel doesn‚Äôt lack me as a guest, and I don‚Äôt need a place to stay either.

The hotel rooms are spacious and comfortable, the breakfast is exquisite and delicious, and there are a variety of Chinese and Western meals.
The hotel staff are enthusiastic, professional, meticulous, considerate, and respond to guests' feedback in a timely manner.
Recommend and praise!

msg:This hotel is next to Xintiandi, very close to shopping in Xintiandi, and very close to the site of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China (400 meters). There are many western food nearby, and you can go out for a drink at night. The surrounding environment is good, but the nearby convenience store is a bit far away .
The hotel is considered an internet celebrity hotel. It is quite spacious inside, with floor-to-ceiling windows, and you can see the nearby night view ~ the decoration facilities are good ~ many young ladies stay here, and someone at the hotel door helps open the door to take the luggage, and after we checked in, we went out to play and came back with our luggage already packed Put it in the room~ The service attitude is good, it is worthy of a five-star hotel, and the sanitation is also clean
Opinion: 1. You can‚Äôt watch digital TV on TV, they are all TV stations;
2. No free fruit; 3. No convenience store nearby
