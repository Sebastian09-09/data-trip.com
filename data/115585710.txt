msg:Whenever a new hotel opens in Shanghai, I want to experience it. This time, I checked in at the newest luxury hotel on the Bund. It has an unparalleled location and a stunning view. Suzhou River and Huangpu River meet here. It is also a place where rich historical heritage meets modern luxury. It has a shocking contrast. On the left hand side, you can see the skyscrapers of Lujiazui in Pudong, and on the right hand side, there are the brightly lit buildings of various countries. It is very healing to quietly watch the Suzhou River flowing slowly and the boats flowing on the Huangpu River. There is a small iron gate on the second floor terrace of the hotel, which can directly enter and exit North Bund. I jogged along the Hongkou Riverside, North Bund, Suzhou River, and the Bund. It was very comfortable and relaxed. I discovered the charm of Shanghai from a different perspective. After five years of renovation and reconstruction, the quality, beauty, and service are all online. It is similar to Hong Kong Regent, but even better than Hong Kong Regent [color][love]. I would like to thank the beautiful lady Kay in particular. After booking, she added me on WeChat in time to help coordinate the room, guide me to drive to the restaurant, and estimate the restaurant reservation. She was very warm and thoughtful, which made my family and I have a very unforgettable journey in Shanghai.

msg:Travel is an indispensable part of life for me and my wife. Whenever we travel to a city, we will try to find a hotel that makes us happy and warm. This time we chose to stay in Shanghai Hai†•π The Regent Hotel is probably the most satisfying hotel we have ever stayed in in Shanghai. First of all, this hotel is located at the junction of the Huangpu River and the Suzhou River in the North Bund. This view cannot be found anywhere else in the North Bund. Especially at seven o'clock in the evening when the lights of the entire Bund and Pudong slowly turn on, this moment presents the entire night of Shanghai to perfection. Next, we were greeted by housekeeper Freya at the front desk. We were extremely touched and surprised by her meticulous service and constant concern, especially when we were about to leave the hotel on the last day, when Freya knew that our flight was at 8pm. They also took the initiative to delay our check-out until five o'clock. My wife and I have always believed that service from the heart is the most sincere and will move guests. We are also looking forward to the next time we come to ShanghaiÔøº, We will definitely choose this hotel including Freya!Ôøº

msg:The original Haiou Hotel was demolished and rebuilt, while retaining some of the original valuable elements. The location is extremely good. The price of an ordinary room of nearly 4,000 yuan, at least half of it is paid for the C position on the North Bund.
The artwork and material design details all reflect the highest level of CCD design, and the old money style and flower themes are in line with the current popularity.
A lobby bar (without a view), a Chinese restaurant and an all-day restaurant (with panoramic views of the Bund and both sides of the Huangpu River). The all-day dining restaurant's offerings are half genuine, and the special breakfast configuration is worth the price.
The all-day dining restaurant and banquet hall terraces have direct access to the Bund (access with room card), which is really amazing.
The room design and equipment are all high-end, but the space is too small, and the overall experience is narrow. The positioning of a top luxury hotel, the space ratio is a bit unmatched, but the waiter also said that it is limited by the location, space and floor height. It all requires making some sacrifices. The use of green in the room is great, fresh and comfortable.
The hotel is still in the trial operation stage, so I saw that many places are still being debugged and repaired when it is not busy.

It is recommended to upgrade to a Bund view room! The price difference of more than 1,000 yuan compared to the basic house is definitely worth it.
The butler-style service was thorough and considerate from check-in, check-in, and check-out. I was deeply impressed by the beautiful and lovely Freya. As a fellow hotelier, I appreciated her professionalism and just the right amount of enthusiasm.
The other thing is the hardware and construction. Apart from the fact that this is an old hotel that has been renovated and the floor height is low, there is nothing to criticize. Even if the room is large in size, it is reasonably designed and well-equipped, so the size is not an issue. Recently, major hotels in Shanghai have been flooded with "flowers". I didn't want to mention these two words, but after coming here, I must sigh: Peace Hotel interprets the flowers of the past, and Seagull Regent is the flower of this era.
I want to praise more than that. In short, it is a sincere work. I will definitely recommend friends to stay here in the future~

msg:It opened in 2023. I heard that it took 5 years to demolish and rebuild.
I stayed at Regent Seaview in Hong Kong once, and the environment and service were particularly good. This time I stayed at Regent in Shanghai, and I felt that the service in ************** was better and more meticulous.
Before check-in, the housekeeper called us and changed the pillow to a suitable low pillow. I found out that the mattress was made of Sealy, which made me sleep well and comfortable. The room type has been upgraded and the view is much wider. We checked in a bit late and didn't take any photos. We were received by Sophie, who was super nice and attentive. She slept late and took the initiative to contact us to help us delay our check-out. He learned about our return flight time and helped us book a hotel car to take us to the airport. grateful.

When I checked in, the butler introduced me to the room. The welcome fruit was the freshest among the ones I have stayed at. It was even better than the Xinrongji I had today. The pear pie made with seasonal fruits was also delicious and featured a crispy exterior. Linen. There is an old seagull thing on the bedside.

(The Western muffins and waffles I went to the restaurant in the morning were also crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, similar to "Shakespeare" on the inside. The tender and slightly amazing texture may be because I personally like this texture. ps: The cream of Western food The black truffle scrambled eggs are highly recommended. They are fragrant and tender. The Western tomato poached eggs are highly recommended. They put a little bit of maybe spicy tomatoes on the toast. The texture is very special. Cut the poached eggs and eat them. It is recommended to try. ps: The preserved egg and lean meat porridge in Chinese food is average and not recommended. The seafood porridge is OK, the real ingredients are very tender. Overall, I prefer Western food to Chinese food in terms of personal taste.)

Take a bath in the evening and enjoy the river view, facing the Oriental Pearl Tower and ancient buildings. Taking a bath is super healing. (Personally, I feel that the light is better in the early morning and it looks better)

ps: The razor is a relatively easy-to-use disposable shaver. I also like the lightness of the bamboo texture.

msg:This time I came to Shanghai to go shopping with my kids. Before departure, I compared many hotels of the same level and finally chose the Seagull Regency. The reason for choosing it was that there were zero negative reviews. First of all, the location: Seat C on the North Bund. Sitting in the room is a great choice. You can see the Suzhou River and the Oriental Pearl Tower; Room hygiene: Every time I book a room, I will pay attention to the bathroom and bedding. The hygiene of Seagull Regent can be said to be 360 ‚Äã‚Äãdegrees without blind spots, and every place is clean; Hotel services: Be the door of the lobby bar The moment you open it, you will feel at home. After checking in, Sophie took us to the room, introduced us to the facilities in the room and the corresponding services, and specially prepared welcome fruits for us. This is the best place I have ever stayed. The hotel welcomes the freshest fruits, which shows their thoughtfulness. They confirmed the itinerary and arrival time with me in advance the day before we checked in. They were very considerate. The hotel's breakfast waffles were delicious, so we booked two. I planned to take it with me when I checked out. I thought I could just put it on the room account and settle the bill together. I didn‚Äôt expect that the money would be taken away. After asking Sophie, I found out that she gave us food because she loves to eat. Although I don‚Äôt know how much it‚Äôs worth, it‚Äôs very heartwarming. , I will choose Seagull Regency for my next trip to Shanghai. It is really full of details.

msg:By chance, we checked into Jinlin, an excellent Chinese restaurant in Shanghai Seagull Regent Hotel. After the meal, the front desk girl Quincy warmly received us and showed us the guest rooms. The children immediately fell in love with Seagull Regency‚Äôs river view room at a glance. The invincible river view is truly unparalleled. You can have a panoramic view of both sides of Huangpu River and Suzhou River. The overall service of the hotel is very good, full of details and treasures.
Room:
The location is excellent, occupying C position on the Bund. You can enjoy the river view from the room, and quietly watch the boats going by on the river. It is super enjoyable~ The amenities in the room are first-class, and the bubble bath is the highlight. The hotel thoughtfully prepared facial masks, makeup remover towels, cleansing towels, etc. for us. Everywhere is full of warm details. The hotel's welcome gift and children's gifts are all very online and tasteful.
Swimming pool gym:
Swimming coach Jackie made Hanghang's swimming skills improve by leaps and bounds. The children liked it very much. We are also very grateful to Coach Annie for taking us to experience hot springs and steaming. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the fitness equipment is an immersive real-life experience, which is very high-end.
breakfast:
Breakfast is a la carte, with rich dishes, focusing on authentic and very pure Western food! Executive chef Luke will also dig out the hidden menu and serve some special dishes, which the children like very much.
Jinlin Chinese Restaurant:
The first time I tasted it, I was impressed by the taste. I was really satisfied. Especially the barbecued pork and crispy squab, it was an unforgettable bite. After asking the chef, I found out that it was Chef Ding from Hong Kong. The food is really amazing. The service in the Chinese restaurant is also very good. It is unique for a restaurant with such scenery and food on the Bund. .
Serve:
In general, this is one of the few hotels in Shanghai with such online services. The location is absolutely unique. It will be my first choice when coming to Shanghai in the future. Shanghai Seagull Regent has become our other home in Shanghai. Everyone who likes Seagull Regent family~

Quiet and comfortable, great experience.
The disadvantages are: the room is small and crowded, and the most difficult thing to accept is that there are no desks, chairs, and computers. . . .
In the case of double-sided glass, the bathtub is actually just a decoration. It takes up a lot of space and is completely impractical. It is also small. . .
It would be better to use that location as an office area facing the river.

Went there early the next day, the service was very good, and we prepared a check-in gift for us. There were not many people staying in the trial operation of the new hotel.

I have heard about Shanghai Seagull Regent Hotel for a long time, and I have always wanted to check in. It has finally opened. I took advantage of the holiday and Valentine's Day to come and check in. I was very surprised that I was loved by Seagull Regent Hotel. Having stayed in so many hotels, this is the first time I have encountered such a magical hotel that is full of details. Their one-to-one service in front of the store is very meticulous. The special arrangement for Valentine's Day is really of high quality and aesthetically pleasing. The hotel is located at the intersection of two rivers, and the scenery is truly unrivaled and unobstructed. It seems to be still in trial operation at the moment. The hotel's various supplies are also very sophisticated. Facial masks, eye masks, face towels, and makeup remover towels are carefully prepared for ladies. They are really friendly. The hotel's welcome package is also a luxury. The staff in the hotel lobby are very service-minded and always smile and help us. Likeüëç

The overall stay experience is very good. In this hotel, the service is very considerate. Sophie contacted me before moving in to understand my needs. Because I was driving there by myself, they very thoughtfully reminded me of the distance to the hotel, asked for the license plate in advance, and helped me arrange parking. Kenny helped us check in because we had children, and he also helped us arrange the children's supplies. Full butler-style service, you can reply to me as soon as possible if necessary!
The overall design of the hotel and the attentive service of the staff are very impressive. I will come back next time I have the opportunity.

With a unique geographical environment, the breakfast room on the second floor offers a panoramic view of both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
Let‚Äôs talk about the service first. Before checking in, I received a considerate greeting from the service staff. After arriving at the hotel, we will provide you with one-on-one service. This aspect really makes us worry-free when staying in a new hotel. Special thanks to Ms. Sophie Guo for taking care of us throughout our stay. The waiters in the entire hotel, including the restaurant, can feel the same. The staff are full of energy and the service is online. During the meal in the Chinese restaurant, the Cantonese chef will come to greet you and learn about your dining experience.
Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs other software. The hotel is still willing to spend money. The welcome gift used by the hotel is really thoughtful and high-quality as I have stayed in so many hotels. Free drinks in the small refrigerator and free washing of three pieces of clothing on the check-in day, which is very convenient.
Looking forward to meeting you next time.

msg:To be honest, my good impression of Intercontinental was ruined by Seagull Regent. Except for the good service of the girl at the front desk, nothing can match this hotel's market positioning. From the moment I enter, there are very few waiters who take the initiative to say hello. There is no turndown service, and the food served in the restaurant is chaotic. No one pays attention to the guests' dining progress. Sometimes the food is not served when it is time to serve. When the guests eat the last dish, they are in a hurry to collect the plates. It is very unprofessional. Perhaps what I want to comment on the most is the breakfast part. Because I had to rush back to work the next day to work overtime, I went to the restaurant according to the hotel's meal opening time at 6:30. When I arrived at the noodle stall, I said "Trouble can", and then Before I could finish my sentence, I was rudely interrupted and said that our water hasn't boiled yet, please wait for another ten minutes! To be honest, I felt offended! As a well-educated person, shouldn‚Äôt I wait for the other person to finish speaking, not to mention that I‚Äôm still a guest! I just want to ask, when the hotel says breakfast is open at 6:30, does it just mean that guests can enter the restaurant? Can't we have breakfast? Well, since you still have ten minutes to go down, do you think dinner will start at 6:40? Could it be that when I go to the hospital to see a doctor, and the outpatient clinic opens at 8 o'clock, the doctor can still say to me when I go in, "I haven't changed my clothes yet, please wait another ten minutes"? Could it be that when you take the subway, the subway driver can still say, "My machine has not started, please wait for another ten minutes?" And the attitude is very uncomfortable! As a service industry, I always believe that service attitude comes first! Having stayed at so many InterContinental hotels, compared to other Regents, Kimptons, and even Indigo, you are not even a little bit behind!

msg:An amateur hotel enthusiast felt that this living experience was quite disappointing:
Let me talk about the good points first. They basically come from the professionalism of the owner. The CCD design effect is very good. There is no attempt to save money in the overall construction of the hotel. The location of the hotel is also excellent.
It can be said that the disappoin**ent comes entirely from the operator: starting from the moment you enter, there is no doorman after ten o'clock in the evening. Not to mention opening the door for guests, who will take the guests' luggage?
Then we entered the hotel and started checking in. There was an event that day, and the public area itself was very small. The entire public area was very noisy. It felt like there were 100 people crowded in, and there was no one to guide the way to check in. The overall feeling was very bad.
The hotel has obviously just opened and its overall operation level is not very good, and its service awareness is insufficient.
The mini bar in the guest room comes with free drinks, but most drinks require a bottle opener to open. But I searched the whole room and couldn't find the bottle opener. I called the housekeeping depar**ent to send a bottle opener. No one answered the call for the first time? ?
The basic room is small and it is difficult to open the luggage.
For a hotel that costs more than 3,000 yuan a night, this level of hotel experience should be the worst in China. This level of operation does ruin the effect of such a good property, design work and the perfect implementation of the owner.
Now that you have chosen a brand that is currently relatively weak in the market, you should cash out your services.
If the owner can see this review, it‚Äôs time for the owner‚Äôs representative to come forward.
All in all, if you want to experience this hotel, I would not recommend it.

msg:This is my first time staying at Regent Hotel in Shanghai. I have also stayed at Regent Hotels in some European countries before. At Shanghai Seagull Regent, the room facilities and supplies are all of first-class quality, including the doorman, front desk, and room service. They are very considerate. The river view room has an unobstructed view! The most praiseworthy thing here is that on the last day before we left, I was about to call a car. Ms. Sun in the lobby (suspected to be the lobby manager) very thoughtfully called a hotel car for us to take us to Hongqiao Station. Unfortunately we didn't take any photos.

msg:1. Room curtains are light-transmitting
2. The power distribution box in the guest room is easily opened and children can touch it, which is very dangerous‚ö†Ô∏è
3. Weird wash basin design, mouthwash will splash on clothes
4. The gym is small, dark and stuffy
The design of the hotel is explained on the surface, but in actual use, there are many problems. Unlike a room price of 4,000 yuan per night, the design is substandard.
The service at the front desk of the hotel is enthusiastic, there are not many varieties of breakfast items, and the waiters are indifferent
There is often no waiter at the door
This Regent needs to work harder!

msg:This should be the smallest hotel under the InterContinental Hotels Group Regent Hotel. There are too few breakfast varieties, and the professionalism of the waiters is very poor. We booked five rooms for four nights and one room for three nights, a total of 23 For the night room, I paid a deposit of ¬•30,000 when I checked in and asked for all fees to be settled together. As a result, the price of a room per night increased by nearly ¬•2,000 without notifying me. I communicated with the hotel many times and was still convincing. After reviewing his own waiter‚Äôs mistake, he also said that he had confirmed it with one of the guests staying at the hotel. This is outrageous! May I ask what is the use of the 30,000 yuan deposit I paid? ! , is it just for you to randomly deduct? ! If the price changes, you should at least notify me. You can‚Äôt cheat customers like this! That's outrageous, this is a very bad five star hotel, bad reviews, bad reviews, bad reviews, will never come back again! It is recommended that everyone do not come here and choose this hotel! This kind of price can remember Bulgari.
