msg:A wonderful hotel in classic traditional style, opposite the famous librarie bookshop and a stone's throw from the sports stadium.  The main commercial street is also a short walk away so the location is great. The service and staff are outstanding, Jeffrey in particular gave us extra special attention. Food options are also first rate, the buffet breakfast and dinner are high quality and the hotel is excellent value for money. The gym was fine, perhaps the only disappointment was that the swimming pool was closed.

msg:Delicious breakfast, attentive staff, business-like ambience, state of the art service. Location is ok. It's right next to the Pioneer Library, a very famous art library and is also within 30 minutes or so to other cool places like a water park, the Nanjing City Wall, Nanjing Eye (a bridge). Not many restaurant options nearby but the hotel foods is pretty good. There's a Japanese restaurant nearby and an Italian one called La Mia Casa is worth a visit. Very good hotel overall. No complaints except for costly dinner (148 RMB per person per buffet meal).

Chinese Buffet is good, Staff is friendly, some English. 
The pool is small, but the Gym is great. Super clean, brand new machines definitely got a good workout in here. 

Can stay here as couple, single that wants to party or family, good spot if you like it Chinese style.

msg:The hotel is lovely old fashioned type of a grand hotel with a great service and beautiful clean and well equipped room. The view from a large window in our room was spectacular and absolutely worth the price. We skipped the breakfast in the hotel since there is a lot of restaurants in the vicinity and we went for local delicacies, although I checked out the buffet and it seemed delicious and original. A lot of crowd at the pool since it was a holiday season, and the pool was quite small, however it’s clean and has a nice surroundings. Absolutely satisfied and I would choose it again when visiting Nanjing. The city is absolutely worth a visit, very charming and interesting, a lot to do and a lot to see. The only downside is that the traffic is a nightmare but there has to be something. Recommend to check out the Confucius museum for sure, as well as the 1912 street. Great food, great people, beautiful architecture, we’ll be back! ❤️

Generally speaking, all aspects are good, especially the service. After all, it is more than 30 years old, and the hardware cannot be compared with the newly built hotels in recent years. The buffet on the first floor is good and the price is really not expensive.

First, the front desk helped upgrade the room type, and I went directly to the executive room. The night view from the high-rise building was still very beautiful.
Then when I returned to the room at night, I found that desserts and fruits were sent, which made me feel warm.
The location of the hotel is really good. Opposite is the popular Pioneer Bookstore, and there are many small shops and delicious restaurants on Shanghai Road behind. This time, I was in a hurry and didn’t go to visit in detail. I hope I can experience it slowly next time.
The room service is also in place. I asked for a charger robot in the middle of the night and it was delivered to the door of the room in minutes. The beef noodles for breakfast are also delicious.
A very satisfying stay.

msg:Having been to Nanjing many times, I feel a little sad that I came to Nanjing Grand Hotel so late. The English name of the hotel is NANJING GRAND HOTEL. The translation of GRAND into Grand Hotel corresponds to the history of Nanjing itself, which is really perfect. The main building of the hotel faces north and south. I stayed on the south side this time, and the Wutaishan Stadium was outside the window. You can see the tasteful stands and running tracks. The famous Pioneer Bookstore is a sunken building, which is under the stadium, just south of the hotel. Whether it is sports or reading, it is very convenient. The back of the hotel is the Nandonggua City and Beidonggua City communities, where there is also a very beautiful place, Nanjing No. 2 Kindergarten. If you live at the north gate of the hotel, it should be very happy to see the children going to kindergarten in the morning. The doorman of the hotel feels great, and all the employees are very polite. The building is very tasteful, with many Japanese styles. The guest rooms are not big or new, but comfortable and just right. The breakfast is also great, with beef noodles, chicken soup noodles, duck blood vermicelli, green willow house vegetarian buns, and not too sweet eight-treasure porridge. Next time I come to Nanjing, I will probably choose here again.

msg:Came to Nanjing to watch a concert. The hotel is in a good location, just across the road from Wutaishan Stadium, a five-minute walk. The first night was upgraded to a parent-child suite. The room was very large with a separate living room and kitchen, but a lighter and a room card set left by a previous guest were found in the gap between the sofas in the living room. The room card set was left in October last year, and it has not been discovered by the cleaning staff for half a year! ! ! The next day, I reported this problem to the front desk. After communicating with the lobby manager, I changed to an executive room (Figure 1). Although the area is not as large as the suite, the facilities are newer. No problems were found on the second night's stay. The manager also gave me a breakfast buffet for the next day.
Overall, the hotel is good and the service staff has a good attitude. After the problem was found in the parent-child suite on the first night, the room I changed to on the second night was very clean. Another problem is that when ordering takeout at the hotel, you can only put it at the front desk, and then the robot will deliver it to the room. It is safe and convenient, but there are very few robots! ! During the peak ordering period, the takeout was left at the front desk for half an hour and it couldn't be delivered! In the end, I had to go downstairs to get it myself! I hope this problem can be improved

A whole large window faces the night view of Xinjiekou, which is a pleasant surprise. It is worth mentioning that the bedding is very good, the pillow mattress is very comfortable, and the recliner is also very comfortable. Let's talk about the areas that need improvement: the service is really too general. The attitude of the front desk was very cold when checking in, and the dinner was extremely noisy (the noise came from the quarrels of the employees... It was endless, all trivial matters...) The dinner buffet was slow to replenish the dishes, there were few styles, and the taste was average (praise the young waiter who collected the plates, the attitude was very good and very positive.) After checking out for one day, the deposit was not returned, and the telephone feedback was again ignored... In contrast to the efficiency of positive service, the colleagues who visited the return visit were subject to performance pressure, and the contact was very active... I will not go into details about the small problems such as the room phone not being able to dial out. Before coming this time, I heard from my father that he often received foreign guests in Gunanadu 20 years ago, and he had a good impression, so I checked out of the Central Hotel and stayed here, but what I got in return was a very different service experience. I hope the hotel will continue to work hard and contact me as soon as possible regarding the deposit issue. As a hotel practitioner, I sincerely hope that Gunanadu Group can operate this landmark hotel with care. The heavy elegance of time and the home-like service attitude should not be contradictory! Keep it up.

The first 0.5 points was because I was not satisfied with the attitude of the gym front desk. I accidentally brought a towel to the front desk. I apologized to the gym front desk and asked her to help me deal with it. As a result, she rolled her eyes at me and said nothing. I was speechless.
The second 0.5 points is the 0.5 points I decided to deduct when I checked out. I don’t recommend that the lobby service staff excessively participate in the guests’ comments on the hotel situation. In this way, the hotel will not get a real feedback, and the hotel will bear the loss in the end.
I still recommend this hotel to friends who like fitness. The gym is really professional!
I commented so much because I still want to stay in this hotel. I hope the hotel will get better and better!

msg:Opposite the Wutaishan branch of Pioneer Bookstore, the location is very good and it is very convenient to take a taxi. It is not far from Xuanwu Lake Jiming Temple Presidential Palace 1912.
It is an old five-star hotel. Although the facilities look a little old, it is very comfortable and warm, with a sense of historical sedimentation. I have always had a light sleep, and I was worried about a lot when I came to Nanjing this time, but I still fell asleep. The bedding is very good and the sound insulation is also very good.
The hotel staff has a strong sense of service and high professionalism.
There are many varieties of breakfast and the taste is also very good.
I will definitely come again in the future.

Many service staff check the checkpoints and count the number of people by swiping their cards before passing. I also saw someone being escorted out by two service staff because they didn't bring their room card. It was a bit too strict! ! Were there too many people eating for food in the past? I have never seen any high-end hotel like this! Hope it improves!

msg:During the Spring Festival, I planned to visit the Confucius Temple in Nanjing, but it turned out that the crowds were so huge that the Confucius Temple and the Qinhuai River were not allowed to come near, so the uncle who maintained order persuaded me to leave. I have to choose a non-holiday time to go there next time, but Nanjing is really nice to visit. 😁
Let’s get back to the story about the hotel. Since I was traveling during the Spring Festival, I chose the hotel very carefully. I thought Gunadu should be trustworthy as a long-established five-star hotel. In fact, after staying for two days, it felt really average and did not meet expectations.
The hotel is located on Guangzhou Road, next to Suning Suites Hotel, and across the road is the Internet celebrity Pioneer Bookstore. The location is not in the downtown area, so it is convenient to take a taxi. There is a bus station not far from the hotel door, but it is a bit far from the subway. After all, the environmental sanitation is acceptable for five-star standards. The key point is that the quality of hotel staff is disappointing and they do not consider customers and pay attention to customer experience. The reasons are as follows,
① It was already past 8 pm when I arrived at the hotel to check in on the first day. Since I was traveling with a baby, I booked a superior twin room. However, when I checked in, I was told that the conditions of the originally booked room were not very good and I was advised to upgrade to a room type priced at 78 per night. Yuan also comes with complimentary breakfast for children. Okay, I didn’t say anything and signed for payment directly. When I got to the room, wasn’t the superior twin room I originally booked what I saw? Where is the upgrade? I really can't tell. I opened Ctrip and took a look at the hotel breakfast. It was 68 yuan per person. Even if my children bought it at full price, it would not cost 78 yuan. It was not easy to think about the staff during the Spring Festival. Normally, I would call the manager to give a reasonable explanation. I have been booking hotels with Ctrip since then. I have never encountered this kind of situation, let alone an old five-star hotel. It is really disappointing.
② During breakfast, a staff member took the initiative to tell the children that there would be gifts when checking out. However, we did not mention anything when we checked out, which made the children feel disappointed. Really, you don’t have to give it away, but don’t act so casually, this represents the Grand Nandu Hotel! Children learn to be true to their words and deeds, but what do adults do?
I took a few photos of the room for your reference. We may not stay here again.

Opposite is the Pioneer Bookstore, and there is a coffee shop downstairs, which is very convenient.

There were two ladies named Song who provided attentive service. The rooms were in good condition. The rooms were clean and they paid great attention to the design. , simplicity and Chinese style are well integrated together. All the services of the hotel are very satisfactory. I will choose this place again when I come to Nanjing in the future. The only thing is that there is a stadium opposite the hotel. In time for the sports meeting, the broadcast started early in the morning and it was very lively😂

I searched several times and finally said it is not turned on. The front desk I was given a small fan, but I ended up catching a cold after blowing it all night. I would rather stay in another good hotel. At least the air conditioner can be adjusted by itself for comfort!

2. There is a strong glue smell inside the room, and the mattress is very soft and uncomfortable. Although it is an old house of more than 20 years, I don’t know the reason for the strong glue smell?
The feedback was given to the restaurant manager on the 7th, and was immediately reported to the guest room. The room manager immediately took the fruit plate to negotiate, and the service was very good.
3. I stayed for three days. Because I ordered the train tickets separately, I had to go to the front desk to activate my room card every day.
4. I can also modify the room price at night after checking in. This operation is also magical.
5. The breakfast is five-star and medium, worthy of the price of the hotel. The lady manager who swiped the card was great.
6. Everyone I come into contact with is asking for five-star reviews and ringing the doorbell at a fixed time in the evening, regardless of whether you are free or not.
7. Except for the above complaints, everything else is in line with five-star quality. Especially the front door service, which helps with luggage, is great.

msg:The problem of this hotel is all in the guest room depar**ent. First of all, I said that the extra bed was added at night because the room was small. The aunt said reluctantly that all had been brought to the door, and she meant to add it on the spot. Seeing her like this, I said we made the bed at night. The second is that I didn’t give me any toiletries for the extra bed. Because of the hot weather, there were only two bottles of water in the room. When I asked the auntie for water, she only gave me two bottles. It’s so petty. None of the hotels the three of us have stayed in is as good as this one I am stingy, and when we looked in the aisle, another aunt who cleaned the room immediately closed the door of the cleaned room. This is very bad, and it makes the guests feel like a thief. If the housekeeping depar**ent scores out of 10 points, I can only score 0 points. The guys in the concierge depar**ent are really nice, and the girl at the front desk who checks in is also good. I am also a star hotel. There is no concept or awareness of this kind of Housekeeping. Very dissatisfied with this time.

The room service aunt is very enthusiastic, and she is very helpful to us.

The room has a good view. The rooms are hygienic and clean. There are bumps in the mattress under the sheets, and the skin feels bad. Maybe I am a pea girl, so I suggest you deal with it. After checking out, I asked the front desk to get two bottles of water, thank you. The front desk service is very good, like it! The location is superior. Opposite is the online celebrity check-in place, the head office of Pioneer Bookstore. Not far away is the Confucius Temple and Jiangnan Gongyuan. Taxi is also cheap. Tea color can also be arranged.

msg:It is the first time to stay in an old-fashioned star-rated hotel, which I passed by many times when I was young.
The overall feeling is relatively warm, elegant aroma, good value for money.
The booked standard room is not too big, but you can see Zifeng Building, Metro Building, and Nanda Red Building from the window.
The breakfast is good, there are many options and our taste is suitable.
For dinner, because I checked in late, I chose the simple Chinese meal that went out of the lobby and turned left. It was also well received and the price was not expensive.
Across the road is Pioneer Bookstore, check in.
Manager Gu in the lobby was enthusiastic about communicating and left a deep impression.
The next time I pass by, I should choose this place again.

msg:As a veteran five-star hotel in Nanjing, it does make guests refresh their senses of this hotel time and time again. Following the previous evaluation, it took more than three hours to change from the second problematic room to the third. I really have nothing to say, from checking in at 2:30 in the afternoon, to entering the third room at 8:00 in the evening. I tried my best not to touch anything in the first two rooms, just because I didn’t want my aunt to increase her workload, and she was cleaning again, so as to achieve self-cultivation, the hotel will know how the guests are, probably not! ! !
The "room" was changed to room 1915 this time, which is relatively close, but the time is too long, and it is enough for me to sleep. This room told me that it had been cleaned and checked, and that was what I was told when I changed to the second room. There was no dust in the room this time, but there was oil stains on the mirror at the entrance, and there was a dead body of a bug on the mirror. The fabric sofas and chairs are still damaged and need to be replaced. There are dust and some stains on the handset buttons of the telephone and the TV remote control, and the frame of the decorative painting has been damaged so that it cannot play the role of decoration. The "bed" should be emphasized, the bed still has black particles, I will deal with it myself! Friends who book a big bed should still pay attention, their big bed is actually two 90 cm small beds put together, and the same is true of the other big beds before. After sleeping on it, the feeling is still obvious. There is a gap in the middle. This is the first time I have encountered such a bed in a five-star hotel. It is really uncomfortable! ! !
"Bathroom" The wooden door of the bathroom has been refurbished, but it is also damaged. The color and model of the bulbs of the two decorative lamps are different, and the light emitted makes it impossible for obsessive-compulsive disorder to look directly at. The toiletries are a bit dusty, because the black bottles are still obvious. It seems that the overall white bathroom is not so clean, but it is not visible to the naked eye. The focus is on the bathtub. I wanted a bathtub cover for a bubble bath, but the service staff said no. Later, when I met the reception manager, I was told that I hadn’t purchased it when it was used up. This should be a regular item in five-star hotels with bathtubs. It is very helpless. There is no shower room, the bathtub and the shower are integrated, because the bottom of the bathtub is curved, even if you put a non-slip mat on it, your feet will start to hurt after standing for a while, which is not a very pleasant bathing experience! ! !
During the "Interlude", the reception manager asked me what I needed to compensate, because I booked the elegant room upgraded by the traveler member for two days. The difference is 20 yuan per day), the reception manager replied that he could not decide. Then I said breakfast for two days would be fine, and he said he would apply for it. After about an hour, he told me that he couldn’t apply.
"Summary" After all, it is a 30-year-old hotel in Nanjing. The aging hardware can be gradually improved. As a five-star hotel, the supporting services and hygiene are really not flattering. It was really an unpleasant two-night stay experience. I also hope that the management will take a good look at these two reviews, and not make the old brand of Gunandu Group worthless.

msg:Recalling the past, the last time I stayed at the Grand Southern Hotel was 20 years ago in 2003, when the SARS epidemic broke out.
If we talk about the past 19 years, we should not count from the opening in 1993. In the past 30 years, if there is any price increase in our country, the hotel room price must be ranked first. When it opened in 1993, the standard room was 500, and it is still 500 now. Outside the window, it is still the Wutaishan Stadium, the home court of Jiangsu Suning at that time, and many games were played in the hotel. Although there is emotional weighting, the rating is still as realistic as possible. The renovated rooms are still up to standard from furniture to bedding, and the area is not too small, although the bathroom is indeed a bit cramped due to historical limitations. If Grand Southern Hotel has the opportunity to make major changes in the future, it can refer to the Guangzhou Garden, which is older than it, and connect two standard rooms to make one.
By the way, I still want to ask who was the genius who translated the English Nanjing Grand Hotel into Grand Southern Hotel instead of Nanjing Grand Hotel when it opened? I always think that this translation level is comparable to Coca-Cola.

msg:This short stay in Nanjing, I chose Nanjing Grand Hotel. The deep impression this time is destined to choose Nanjing Grand Hotel again next time I come to Nanjing.
Ms. Luo Jing at the front desk encountered the situation that our "special request" for accommodation could not be met, and repeatedly tried to provide us with the best possible accommodation. As soon as we got into the room, the extra hotel supplies for us arrived, even before I wanted to call room service. Regarding takeaway orders, the busy lobby invited the little robot to "deliver food to the door" without any delay. It is really a very high-quality service that keeps pace with the times. The hotel's breakfast dishes are very rich, carefully selected and prepared with high quality, and the empty plates are quickly refilled. Even when the restaurant is almost full, the waiters in the restaurant are meticulous, welcoming and sending you off in a brisk and precise service.
If the guest is unwell and unable to go downstairs to eat, he will help prepare a small lunch box and send it to the guest's room.
I can't help but admire the hotel's service is really too high-quality.
Allow me to mention Manager Gu, the lobby manager, and Ms. Lu, the welcoming lady. I gave them a lot of trouble. The lobby manager of a five-star hotel has no pretensions. He chooses to help the restaurant during the busiest breakfast time, and carefully observes the needs of diners. When I was confused and couldn’t find a plate, Manager Gu immediately came to ask me what I needed. What? Are you looking for a plate? My child came down to eat very late because he was not feeling well. It was too late to buy medicine and asked Ms. Lu and Manager Gu for help. Unexpectedly, she not only prepared the necessary medicine for us, but also worried that the child would be hungry on the way because he didn’t have breakfast because he was unwell. Ms. Lu also specially helped us bring snacks and yogurt, and handed them to me in a hurry superior. Since I couldn't call a taxi with my mobile phone, and the time was urgent, Manager Gu tried his best to help us find a taxi after learning about it. I really thank you so much for your heartfelt service, which is very touching.

I have to give my heartfelt thanks to everyone at Grand Nandu who helped and served us so amazingly and impressively. From Ms. Luo at the front desk, the unknown handsome guy at the concierge, to Ms. Lu at the breakfast restaurant, and manager Gu at the lobby. There is no part of the service that is not admirable and praiseworthy. This kind of check-in experience is really super five-star. Be sure to leave a message so that more candidates can rely on it, so that more guests who want to experience the five-star quality can see the ancient Nandu adheres to the quality.

The only dissatisfaction is that there were too many people on the day of check-in, and I waited for a long, long, long, long, long time... really long. It took a long time for the takeaway to be delivered upstairs.
Anyway, I am very satisfied and highly recommended. The next time I go, I hope the subway has been repaired. Next time I go to Nanjing, I will still live in the ancient Nandu.

It is convenient for shopping, shopping and playing.
The hotel is very clean from the lobby to the room. We checked in at night, and the bed has been turned down. It is very good to have direct drinking water in the bathroom of the room. Wake up in the morning and eat a delicious buffet in the lobby, and a bowl of steaming beef noodles instantly injects energy into the body. The market price of 68 yuan per person is very cost-effective, and there are many types, including Chinese and Western food, as well as fruit and yoghurt.
The hotel's service is very personalized and very good. Everyone from the doorman to the big sister in the room depar**ent greeted us with warm smiles. When the weather is cold, the takeaway will be put in the incubator for help. Ms. Ding Ning at the front desk is super beautiful, especially gentle and caring, and the service is superb👍

msg:Before coming to Nanjing, I looked at many hotels, and finally chose the ancient Nandu. An old-fashioned hotel with an affordable price and a superior location. Across the road is the Pioneer Bookstore, which is popular with Internet celebrities. The housekeepers Liu Ying and Zhou Yiqin of the hotel were warm and considerate. They gave us welcome fruit and told us that we could contact us at any time if we had any questions or needs. The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety, but you have to go early, and there are too many people when you go late, and the things are not complete.

Shopping in the old city, the attractions are more convenient, and the hotel even upgraded the room. The breakfast is also relatively rich, and it is troublesome to take care of children when traveling. The hotel has noticed that they take care of children very much.

msg:Gunan was the best 5-star hotel in Nanjing in the 1990s, when Japanese management was unique in Nanjing.
Going again this time, the room facilities have been mottled and peeled off, and the hotel service staff speak Nanjing dialect, making you feel like you are staying in a country house.
The downgrading of the hotel has led to a mixed bag of guests. One day, when I just got out of the elevator, I found someone smoking in the elevator entrance of the floor, and the whole aisle was filled with a strong smell of smoke. The telephone service desk said to send someone to take a look, but there was no feedback or apology after that. If this kind of incident is placed abroad, the entire hotel may go bankrupt. After leaving the store two days later, those 7 or 8 Yantais still appeared on the elevator entrance.

I was wearing slippers and wanted to go swimming and go to the fitness area to warm up, which involved safety issues. She reminded me to wear shoes to prevent my feet from being smashed, but I did not bring sneakers for a temporary business trip, but when I went up and wore daily leather shoes, I said I was simple The hot lower body won't be a safety issue afterward. He answered me, "I'm not afraid that you will smash your feet, but your shoes will damage our court." At that time, there were question marks in my mind. A barbell of hundreds of kilograms can be used as a deadlift court, and leather shoes can also damage the ground. Ordered the shoes now!
3. Manager Liu Dan was the best service during this stay. Since the breakfast time was too late, he helped pack and pack.

I called the service desk again, and waited for the repairman to finish repairing. After I took a shower, it was past two o'clock in the night, and I didn't fall asleep all night. , I had a terrible headache, so I went to the front desk at 8 o'clock in the morning to find the person in charge of the hotel. I waited from 8 o'clock in the morning until 12 o'clock in the noon, but it was not handled properly. He also said that the leader was on his way. More than four hours later, I asked to find the general manager of the hotel. Everyone at the front desk and manager Huang, who had been in contact with the leader, said they didn't know where the general manager was, and they didn't know where to contact him. The general manager's call!
      This is a five-star hotel, and its hardware and software facilities can't match it at all! The facilities in the room are outdated, and regular maintenance is not done well; the problem of service quality is even more serious. When encountering a problem, it is not to find a solution, but to avoid, prevaricate and prevaricate. Guests choose a five-star hotel because of its quality and to get comfortable and secure services, and my experience of staying in this hotel is disturbing! Very poor check-in experience!

Yesterday in Nanjing, the outdoor temperature was 10-22 degrees, and the temperature in the hotel room was 31 degrees (the room opened for me was facing south). After inquiring about the room service, the front desk, and the manager, I learned that the hotel is an environmentally friendly hotel. , the outdoor temperature must reach a certain standard before the air conditioner can be turned on. If not, then you can only open the room window to blow the natural wind, or change you to a north-facing room (room temperature is 24 degrees). Of course, after communication, after all It was around 5 o'clock in the afternoon, so I lived in a room facing north. I was lucky. I opened the window at night, it was not as hot as I thought, and the scenery outside the window was still good.

Several halls in the gym are super large. The Wutaishan Stadium is across the road from the hotel. The doors are open for 3 hours in the morning and in the evening. The plastic runway is very comfortable.
Let’s also talk about the warm service. The waiters Zhou Yiqin and Liu Ying are enthusiastic. After knowing that I need to do nucleic acid, they are very enthusiastic to help me draw a picture and tell me the nucleic acid address of the nearby brain hospital.
As a lifetime platinum member of Marriott Hotel, I was planning to move to the Westin Hotel the next day, but I was attracted by the hotel's service and location, so I stayed for another 2 days!

msg:I arrived in Nanjing on October 4th, and I was studying at Nanjing Normal University. Living in the ancient southern capital, its inherent humanistic temperament is as friendly as its alma mater. The lobby has a wide field of vision, and the fragrance of flowers is overwhelming. There is a small queue at check-in. It is understandable that there must be many tourists during the National Day. But the reception desk and room attendants greeted warmly, and a cup of welcome tea eliminated the fatigue of the journey. The room is quiet, facing the direction of Xinjiekou, and the night view is beautifully lit. The buffet breakfast on the second day was crowded, but the salted duck, duck blood vermicelli soup, and xiaolongbao were hygienic and delicious, which brought back fond memories again. . . Before checking out, I went to the Pioneer Bookstore for a stroll. This place is always the spiritual home of strangers on the earth. I bought my favorite book and left with satisfaction. This trip to Nanjing is a very good experience. I look forward to a better ancient southern capital and a better Nanjing!

The doorman’s service and greetings are in place, and they don’t cross the line; the boys and girls at the front desk are very enthusiastic and patient, and the lobby manager Huang Youqiang is thoughtful; the variety of breakfast is a little bit less than the state of the impression a few years ago, and the sausage and bacon have room for improvement , but the overall quality and cost performance are still very high, and the coconut milk sago is great. Lu Yan, the assistant manager of the restaurant, saw that we had elderly people with us, and she took the initiative to provide warm service and was very heartwarming. The cleanliness of the guest room is reassuring. The shower head seems to be cleaned regularly, and the water is delicate and abundant. Checking out at 14 o'clock also made us feel at ease.

msg:Ctrip seldom commented, mostly automatic praise, but this time I really want to talk about it. I communicated with the hotel the day before check-in and I have to arrive at the store before 6:00 p.m. because I have girlfriends and children. I arrived at the store around 6:10. The hotel told us that the room was not cleaned and asked us to wait. We dragged our luggage and waited in the hotel lobby. We communicated with the front desk and told us that we would have to wait for 20 minutes. We were tired after driving for a day, and we had a child. We didn't have dinner. We asked the hotel to arrange check-in according to our requirements, but it took more than an hour to arrange check-in. It was around 7:30 when we got to the room. It was a very, very bad check-in. The hotel was extremely irresponsible. I haven't heard of any hotel that arranges check-in after 7 o'clock. On the premise that I booked the room in advance and asked to check in before 6 o'clock. The hotel manager came to negotiate and help us with our luggage. I am grateful for this, but at the same time, I think this is also the standard that an old five-star hotel should meet. The hotel did not apologize again for my check-in arrangement until I left the hotel. I was very disappointed. It is recommended to choose carefully when traveling on business. In addition, the hotel is an old-fashioned five-star hotel, the service cannot keep up, and the facilities are also very old. As a service industry, it is really necessary to have strict standards and improve service quality, so as not to make customers feel that the money spent is not worth it.

One was because I forgot to bring the power bank data cable, and the customer service immediately solved it for me. I needed an umbrella for two days when I went out, and the concierge took the trouble to help me solve it. Yes, if I go to Nanjing again, I will stay there again.

The front desk took the initiative to change a parent-child room. The breakfast the next day was rich, maybe the waiter was a little busy, and the food was not received in time. It is recommended to have breakfast off-peak. Manager Liu at the front desk took the initiative to ask how the check-in was, and was kind and amiable. Zhang front desk is professional in billing, asking for billing information and check-in name to prevent mistakes. The only downside is that the billing is a bit slow, and it takes a while. It is recommended to upgrade the system, take into account the overall planning, or ask for the customer billing information when checking in, which is convenient for customers. The license plate needs to be recorded several times, so it is recommended to reduce some steps. I will stay here again next time I do errands around here!

I stayed in room 1815, the cooling effect of the air conditioner was very poor, and the temperature in the room remained stable at around 25 degrees. I contacted the front desk, but only asked the staff to measure the temperature, saying that the temperature was within the normal range. The solution is to provide a dusty electric fan. . . . . . The temperature in Nanjing at the end of July was as high as 38 degrees, and the hotel lobby was cooler than my room! Even if it is a chain hotel, the check-in experience is not like this!

Many years ago, I just followed my friends to the earliest Japanese restaurant "Naguye" in Nanjing and was obsessed with it. This time, I chose to stay there - from food to accommodation, a full experience.

Thanks to Ctrip's good policy, I was upgraded to a superior room on the 17th floor for free. As soon as I entered, the floor manager Ms. Wang Ying led the room manager to greet me very politely. Knowing that I like to make tea, she immediately arranged tea sets and purified water and mask glasses disinfection paper, and also gave me a 99 yuan experience coupon, which can be used at noon and in the evening. Haha, we originally came for Japanese food, but now we have another choice.

🛏【️Hotel Guide】
📍Detailed address: No. 208 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing

🚗Transportation Guide: Get off at Xinjiekou Station on Metro Line 1 and walk 100 meters according to the navigation.

🌟Highlights: The guest rooms on the 17th floor offer a panoramic view of the entire Wutaishan Sports Center and the beautiful scenery of Nanjing Normal University and Nanjing University on both sides. Opposite the main entrance of the hotel is the Wutaishan branch of Pioneer Bookstore, which is known as "the most beautiful bookstore in China". It is actually the most friendly to guests. You can read for a whole day without buying books. Haha, Qingliangshan Park, Nanjing Presidential Palace, 1912 Block, Nanjing Museum, etc. are all nearby.

✅After a delicious meal of ancient Japanese food, drink tea to digest the food and rest well. As dusk approaches, go up and down from the luxurious restaurant "Penglongxuan" on the top floor to the roof garden on the fourth floor, tennis courts, indoor swimming pools, gyms, pavilions, classical and modern interweaving, just relying on this pool garden There is not a mosquito, and you can watch the sunset with peace of mind... Well! It has attracted me deeply...

msg:Bad to the extreme, bad review! ! !
I was bitten several times on my body, on my arms and legs, see the picture! !
And meals, listen to me break it down one by one! For two days, every day was annoyed!
For breakfast, I asked for an egg noodle. I agreed the night before, and it was delivered to the room at 8:30. The next morning after 9:00, it was still not delivered. The telephone consultation said that the order was not received, and the restaurant did not know. After the restaurant knew about it, they started to make it. After 20 minutes, they urged it to deliver it immediately. After another 5 minutes, the restaurant called to ask, what kind of eggs do you want? Damn, it wasn't ready yet, and someone lied!
Then in the evening, let me deliver a noodle to the room the next morning. The front desk said, what time will I be able to answer the phone tomorrow morning, he wants to consult the leader, and he will call me back the next morning.
A five-star hotel, a noodle dish, make the guests furious! Is this a five star service? This is a five-star pissed off! !
First time and last time! What a ****ty service! It's no wonder that there are also bad reviews on the Internet. I thought it was a navy, but I didn't expect it to be true!
If you weren't extremely angry, who would waste time and make such a big joke!

I lost a razor worth 2,000 yuan in the room, and called the front desk for several days to help find it, but the attitude was perfunctory and said to help me ask the housekeeping depar**ent, but nothing happened every time. It stands to reason that the aunt who cleaned the room had discovered it a long time ago, and now she is nowhere to be found. She said to call back every ten minutes, but no one contacted her in the end. The management is very chaotic, and the overall review is very bad. I won't book again next time, and I won't recommend relatives and friends to book. The level of service is not as good as that of Express Hotel. Eat a pit and gain a wisdom, persuade to retreat! !

msg:Recently, I took a family of three with my baby to stay in this hotel, and the experience was generally good. The hotel is located across the road from the main entrance of Wutaishan Sports Center, and the location is very good. The facade of the hotel is oval and beige. Although the hotel has been in business for more than 30 years, the appearance is quite attractive, and it is not outdated even now. The hotel lobby is also stylish enough and well maintained. The front desk arranged a higher floor facing the north facing the Zifeng Building, and the scenery is not bad. The guest rooms should have been renovated without any sense of obsolescence. The room is moderate in size, warm and elegantly decorated, and I especially like the carpet pattern. The room facilities are also very complete. In order to reduce noise, the water inlet pipe of the toilet is wrapped with a thick sponge, and the downlight directly above the bathtub is specially made of frosted glass, so that the light will not be dazzling when guests lie flat in the bath. These facilities show that a hotel with a long history can gradually discover some details in the long-term operation process, and whether these details are handled properly will actually bring a very different sense of experience to the guests. It can be said that the details determine success or failure. When it comes to details, I have a bit of a hard time talking. During my stay at the hotel, I asked the floor attendant several times for something, and the waiter provided the corresponding service. However, after each service, even if it is a small service that is within the scope of the service, it is required to be named and praised on the Internet. I can understand their thoughts. This phenomenon must be related to the reward mechanism set up by the hotel, and the number of people named should also be related to income. The original intention of this mechanism is good, but the details need to be more perfect, otherwise the final effect may be counterproductive.

1.服務不好。提前一個月訂的房間，下午4點半到達酒店辦理入住，告訴沒房間，讓等兩個半小時。最後找了大堂經理，等了半個多小時，才入住。
2.環境不好。酒店設施特別老舊，電視機還帶雪花。衞生也很差，地毯特別噁心，又臟又臭，枕頭底下都是頭髮。
3.最讓我無語的是早餐，我們住了4天，後兩天都不吃了。沒想到五星級酒店的早餐這麼垃圾，還不如連鎖三星酒店，第二天連餐廳都沒讓我們去，直接整個餐廳擺了幾道餐。糊弄**呢？真是特別特別氣憤

酒店對面是五台山體育場，跑道很好，早晚開放，可以去跑步。
網紅書店人太多，附近南大那邊有很多好吃的餐廳。
酒店有游泳池，但是在攜程的網頁上沒有顯示，我之前諮詢客服也反饋沒有，可以改進一下。
建議中餐晚餐再優惠一些，相對其他酒店性價比不高。

前台，站着等了28分鐘。沒有人過來處理，又是這一個套路。視而不見。沒有辦法，衹能離開。我從來沒有見過如此垃圾的酒店，簡直不把客户當人看，什麼問題都不回覆，所有人都不理你。這就是4星級的酒店。我真的是服了。我住過的最垃圾的酒店，沒有之一。

前台小姐姐史睿和丁寧辦理入住默默的幫我升了房，退房時慶圓圓給我主動錄了停車牌，每一處細節都讓入住者覺得暖心！同時地理位置絕佳商圈正中心去哪裡都無敵方便下次來南京還會繼續入住的！
對了晚餐還去了古南都旗下的綠柳居，鹽水鴨灰常好！

1、配備游泳池和健身房。但是泳池不是標準泳池。健身房還是不錯的，設施設備齊全！
2、房間設施陳舊，都看得出很久沒翻新裝修了！房間温控較差，不能按需設定。
3、房間設施眼下最多三星半，游泳池加健身房算個四星吧！
衞生：衹能説無功無過算好了！但是化粧了水漬希望後續注意⚠️
環境：酒店周圍還算安靜，旁邊就是去新街口，總統府的3路環線還是比較方便的！
服務：好了關鍵重點來了！
1、酒店含了早飯，入住2天吃了一次。簡直可以説這個早飯真的是大型災難現場。2、咖啡杯和勺子，筷子需要蹲點才能拿到。
3、菜品單一選擇麪太窄，咖啡用的咖啡豆沒有咖啡該有的香氣。豆花是冰的😤。4、菜品沒有了更新很慢。
5、服務員明顯不夠，麪檔都是人。擠不進去！
6、唯一可取之處，煎蛋可以單面，這個需要點贊！

服務還可以。第一天入住送了水果是棗。説是國慶節活動送的。結果我們住三天就送了一天。有些失望。
早餐還可以，菜品少了點。包子，酥餅比較好吃。
地理位置還算方便，旁邊是公交站。去地鐵站的話要公交車先坐幾站路。基本上去各個景點都能有公交車到達。這點確實還算方便。
衞生還可以。飯店有點年代了。設施舊。洗澡是浴缸上加淋浴蓬頭，不是淋浴房。
服務一般，我問客服多要一個枕頭，客服説沒有了，衹給了一個小小孩用的小而薄的。這麼大一個酒店多要一個枕頭都沒有了。。。

如果一定要提點意見的話，中午高峯期前台人員不太夠，住店客人會排隊。圖片就上個昨晚林葳絕殺的現場視頻吧。

酒店位置不錯，到哪兒都比較方便，但對自駕的朋友就不太友好了，因為酒店停車位非常少，下地下車庫絕對考驗車技！

msg:這次駐南京特意選了以前的學校附近的酒店
可以看到五台山體育場。
是一家開了很多年的老牌的星級酒店，但是各方面的體驗還挺好的，沒有因為時間久而懈怠
在南京市中心附近，這個價位性價比還是蠻高的，而且也能免費停車。
我們住的是19層1915，還是挺安靜的，即使靠近電梯口也不會吵。
服務態度也蠻好的，可惜我們入住的比較晚，8:00多了，沒有吃上4樓日料
點外賣，可以讓機器人送也可以自己下去拿，個人建議自己下去拿因為高峯期送的很慢。
