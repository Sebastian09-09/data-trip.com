But when you go to reception section you will know what type of disaster service . Long time to complete check in because very busy in mobiles . Check out the worst because also very busy on mobile . Customer service on phone mostly not reply. And when they reply they just need to end up call . Always reply with yes okay okay okay yes . I forgot personal thing in my room . Room services took with with her and when I went back to hotel receptionist kept on a call for almost 15 minutes talking with someone and at the end replied with sir can you go and search for your things by your self. Room has been cleaned by luck only when I met room services I told her it was outside she bring it for me from hidden place in her trolley.  I never would like to try a place like that anymore

Some of the front desk personnel speaks English so you have easy check in and communication if you don't speak Chinese. The room was awesome, clean, spacious and along with the usual items they even provided some fruits. The location is very convenient, close to the Yuexiu Park and metro (about 5- 8 minutes walk) and other attractions in Yuexiu District. There are lots of food outlets downstairs or extremely close to the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

msg:Let‚Äôs talk about the advantages first:
It is a long-established five-star hotel. It is large and has everything you need. The service attitude is good and it can keep up with various needs. I am staying during the Spring Festival and am afraid of returning to Nantian. Please note that you need a heater. The reservation department will inform you in advance. It was put in the room and there was enough mineral water, which was good.
The location is super good. There is a small gate next to the subway entrance, only 3 meters away. There is also a bus stop opposite. It is very convenient to go anywhere. Yuexiu Park is diagonally opposite, and a little further south is the Tomb of the Nanyue King Museum, which is about 100 meters away from Beijing. It is not far from Lu Pedestrian Street and Guangxiao Temple, and it is definitely connected in all directions.
The hotel has Four Seasons China, Food Street, and Gallery Restaurants, which are convenient for dining. The food at Four Seasons China is high-end and exquisite, while the food at Food Street is more down-to-earth and delicious. As a foreigner, I thought they were all delicious. I ate five meals in the hotel in total. Dinner was a great experience. And guests can pay bills
15% off, service fee deducted.
On New Year's Eve, the hotel gave guests small candy gift boxes, which was very thoughtful and thoughtful.
On the morning of the first day of the first ***** month, there is a lion dance performance and a parade of the God of Wealth, which are special activities in Guangzhou and are very interesting and lively.
After talking about the advantages, let‚Äôs talk about the disadvantages:
The hotel's breakfast buffet is very rich. On days when the weather is cold, the temperature in the restaurant is relatively low, and the food is not very interesting in terms of characteristics. It always makes people feel like there is nothing to eat, which affects the experience.
Some of the facilities in the room are aging, the wardrobe door is tilted and cannot be closed tightly, and some sealing strips in the bathroom have fallen off, which affects the overall image.
The replenishment of materials is not standardized, and sometimes an item is missed and you need to call to request it.
There are too few seats in the lobby waiting area. During the peak check-out period, you can only stand in the lobby while waiting for an online taxi.
If I go to Guangzhou next time, I will probably stay here again.

In the early spring in Guangzhou, it is impossible to swim in an outdoor swimming pool that is not a constant temperature. The only shortcoming of the Chinese wine is that it is next to the sauna. The small refrigerator that holds cold and warm towels broke and has not been replaced for almost half a year. It is inconvenient to have to ask the waiter to get it every time.

Except for the reception service at the front desk, which is pretty good, everything else I saw does not have the professional enthusiasm that a five-star hotel should have. Especially the doorman position, which is the first receptionist position in the hotel. , faced with the guests carrying large luggage up the stairs, not moving a few meters away, why not offer a helping hand to a big brother who is smoking.
The room is not large in size and the bed is relatively large, which makes the room a little cramped. The premium room type is said to be renovated in 2021, and the sound insulation is not bad. No matter how loud the corridor is, it can't be heard anywhere. The bathroom is not big, especially the position where the toilet paper is placed tests the twisting ability of the waist.
The biggest problem with the room is the floor height, which feels no more than 2.3 meters. It does feel depressing.
The location of the hotel is very good. There are many places to eat and drink within a 10-minute walk. You can have several meals at Dude in Liuhua Center opposite, and Yuexiu Park is also next to it. There is an elevator at Exit D2, which leads to the side entrance of the hotel. If you are carrying luggage, it is recommended to go forward after exiting D2. You can reach the lobby on the left.

It is said that the service quality is the industry benchmark and it has cultivated a large number of hotel professionals. After bringing my family to move in, I was disappointed. There were many shops on the first floor of the hotel, which was complicated and noisy. The exterior wall of the hotel was undergoing exterior wall decoration. It was like a large construction site with dense building layout and intensive leisure and entertainment facilities. There is definitely a lot of room for improvement in the service level. Because the room does not include breakfast, the front desk refused to upgrade. I went to the lobby on the first floor to pay for breakfast and went to the restaurant on the second floor. However, the restaurant said that the breakfast coupon I purchased was not verified and I had to go to the lobby to confirm. After taking the elevator to the first floor to cancel the check-in, couldn't the restaurant staff on the second floor make a phone call and waste 20 minutes on the guest? I probably won‚Äôt choose this place when I come to Guangzhou in the future.

I am very lucky that the hotel can help upgrade the room during the New Year period so that several children can have space to play and move around in the room. It is not easy to have active children.

The best afternoon tea at Martini Restaurant on the 4th floor. The package I bought was only for two people to have lunch, because my relatives were also here. Let the three dolls take any fruit and treat them to drinks and snacks. We were also given a large seat and were very comfortable to sit in. Looking at the pool, the children were so happy, and even those aged three to seven were jumping out to sit in the pool. The restaurant waiters completely satisfied them.

The buffet breakfast may have a large number of guests during the New Year period. Even if the restaurant is large, a family of three can only occupy half of the table, which means there are plenty of food. The waiters are busy and the service is attentive. I like this üëç

The lobby is super big.
The room was not bad.
There are several popular restaurants in Liuhua Center opposite the hotel.
However, one thing I am dissatisfied with is that the room attendant rang the doorbell at 9 o'clock in the morning and said that he wanted to come in to manage the room. This made me a little puzzledü§î.

A birthday cake was also given to the child on his birthday. The location in the city center is right at the doorstep of the subway, making it very convenient to go anywhere. There are also many delicious restaurants and sugar shops downstairs. In the afternoon, we have Happy Hour in the executive lounge. There is a wide range of food and wine. There is a BBQ by the swimming pool. Children love eating and swimming.

On the fifth day of the ***** New Year, a friend came to have breakfast with me. I called the room service number and was kindly reminded that I could purchase it through the official account‚Äôs room discount upgrade, which cost 168 for two persons. It was really cost-effective. I accidentally placed an extra order during the operation. When confirming at the front desk, the staff member Yang Qingxi was very nice to remind me and help with the cancellation matter.

Hotel food: The hotel breakfast is not good. However, the hotel's food street and Four Seasons China restaurants are quite delicious.

To sum up, it is recommended to stay elsewhere, but you can try the dining on the first floor.

We are very happy that the hotel upgraded us to a suite on the 15th floor.

When you get out of the subway and look up, you can see that the hotel is very close. The small door we entered was not convenient for the elderly and children because they were traveling with them. , I was still holding my suitcase, and a staff member immediately came over to help pick up the suitcase and take us to the hotel lobby. The manager on duty that day was Ms. Pan, who helped us check in very quickly. The room arrangement was very good, so we were afraid that the elderly would have to walk too much. It is also very quiet near the elevator. I would like to commend Ms. Pan for being very serious and responsible in her work!

msg:1. The thickness of the hotel's bath towels is not as good as that of other hotels, and the texture does not meet five-star standards. The room still feels old and inferior to other five-star hotels;
2. The service was extremely poor. A lot of things happened inside. Because I saw VR glasses and saw the brand of China Hotel, as a Guangzhou person, I felt that I should try it anyway. It turned out that the staff first forgot to put the VR glasses in the room for guests to see in person. I asked on the phone, but there was no instruction manual and I had to figure it out on my own. Then my friend and I wanted to play at the same time and called the front desk and said we could rent it with a deposit. However, I went to the lobby to pay the deposit (it was already past 11 o'clock) and the front desk clerk told me that I couldn't borrow it. Money was not an option either (I was really a bit vomiting blood). Later, I insisted that your customer service colleagues said that I could rent it after asking the concierge colleagues. As a result, they made us wait for a long time before they came out, and then they increased the price by 1,000 as soon as I asked. Deposit (****I was charging my phone on it at the time, and I really didn‚Äôt hold much RMB). My friend was a little girl and didn‚Äôt have much cash. The front desk staff looked at us as if we were poor people trying to make money. I'm having a hard time depositing money over there. If the customer service staff of a five-star hotel makes guests feel like they are poor and is such blatant bullying, would you dare to stay there again?
3. Later, I asked about the through train service in Hong Kong, which was also listed on the trip. Their switchboard told me that they could only provide a phone number for me to call myself. Can you believe this kind of service? What's the difference between going to the high-speed rail station and calling the through train company myself? Then you posted the through service just to deceive Hong Kong customers? It's funny. I really regret not going to Sheraton or Garden Hotel. I had a much better experience staying at Garden Hotel at that time. Compared with the service in Shenzhen, China Hotel is not worth five stars, four stars at most. I don't recommend it and I won't go there in the future. Would recommend anyone to stay at China Hotel.
4. The experience of VR glasses is okay, and the texture interaction of the handle is okay, but 80% of the games cost money, and there is no manual at all, which is not suitable for elderly people at all.
5. There is indeed a wide variety of breakfast, which makes it a bit better, but the food quality is really average, not as good as the snacks I eat on the street. So it‚Äôs really not enough for me to choose again.

I also hope that the Trip platform will no longer use VR and Hong Kong through train services to help them promote it.

The waiters were very polite. There are many types of breakfast, including Chinese, Western and Japanese, as well as Cantonese rice rolls and soup noodles. But not amazing.
The location is very good. There is the subway 10 meters from the back door downstairs and there is a Dian Dude restaurant 200 meters away. There is a Starbucks on the first floor, as well as a Dianping internet celebrity store, Wudai Tongtang Dessert Shop. I was invited to this dessert shop 4 times during my two-day stay.

This is probably because everyone's body feels different, so it's not a drawback. It's very close to the subway station, and there's a bit of traffic across the street from the hotel. There are many restaurants along the street from the hotel, such as Starbucks, Jiuji Ice Room, and Burger King, which are very convenient. Exit D of the subway station is closest to the lobby, which is a bit different from what the map shows.

msg:The hotel location is really good. It's just that the room as a whole is too short and feels depressing. After staying for two days, I decided to change rooms to the Dongfang Hotel next door. The hotel rooms, outdoor swimming pool, etc. are even better than the Oriental Hotel! What I also want to complain about is that the depth of the outdoor swimming pool is too deep. Generally, 1.5-1.7 meters is enough for a hotel, but the deepest part of their home is actually 2.3 meters.

The sewer pipe in the room I checked in that night was clogged and the phone couldn't be connected. I changed to a second room that was dirty. The hotel has no remedy and I will never stay at China Hotel again.

The transportation is convenient, and traveling by subway is very convenient. When visiting Yuexiu Park, it‚Äôs not far from the [Yuexiu Park Station B1] exit. It‚Äôs really good!
The sky swimming pool on the fourth floor has long opening hours, is small and exquisite, has clean water quality, and has professional lifeguards, which is very good!

msg:To be honest, based on the current hotel setting, it is at most a four-star level.
1. The hotel's indoor parking lot is not in the same building as the hotel. It feels like it was built separately at the back, just like the public parking spaces in those factories. And from the parking lot to the hotel, you have to pass through other buildings and food streets, and there is a section in the middle. There is no elevator. If you are carrying heavy things with children, this setting is very inconvenient.
Second, it feels very complicated inside, lacking the privacy of a five-star hotel. It is seamlessly connected to the food street next to it. You can directly enter the accommodation elevator from the food street, which lacks a sense of security.
3. After entering the room, there was a sticky stain on the floor, and the phone in the room was broken.
4. The bed in the room is said to be 1.8, but when you actually sleep on it, it feels much smaller. It feels like 1.7*1.6. In short, it is different from the 1.8*2 we understand. It is much smaller.
5. There is no takeout robot. To get takeout, you need to go downstairs and go to a takeout table outside the door.
6. The height of the corridor is too low, it feels like 1.8 is too high.
To be honest, the room has been well maintained. After all, it has been in such a geographical location for so many years. The price-performance ratio is relatively high. In addition, there are many delicious food inside, which can be regarded as a good supporting facility. Although the gym equipment is a bit older, to be honest It's quite complete. It's a quiet place amidst the hustle and bustle.

msg:Because I was watching a performance in the theater the next day, I booked a nearby hotel. I took my baby on a tour and liked the parent-child room, so I booked the Balala Xiaomoxian parent-child room on Ctrip. Because it is an old hotel, the floor height is indeed a little short, which is rather depressing, but fortunately, the internal facilities of the room are not bad, and the parent-child arrangement is also very careful, which is not bad. Parking is indeed a bit of a hassle, because parking in another building requires a long walk. Residents who drive are advised to put their luggage and family members in the lobby first. We didn't order breakfast, so we don't know the quality of breakfast.
Service: This aspect needs to be improved. It took half an hour to check in. I parked the car and walked back. My family members were still waiting at the front desk to confirm the room. My daughter's urinal in the back couldn't help it. It was a really bad experience. Hope to continue to train the professionalism of the front desk and improve check-in efficiency. As an established hotel in the old city, it is not very competitive compared with the new star hotels a few kilometers away, but the parent-child room features are worth enjoying, and the price is a little bit expensive, and the parent-child room charges It's so high, the floor is really low, and the view is not good.

msg:This experience was very badüëé. I didn‚Äôt want to write a review. After all, bad reviews are always bad. No one contacted me until I left something behind in the hotel for several days. When I contacted me, I was informed that the hotel‚Äôs service policy is that it does not know what the guest left behind. Should we add that they are too busy so they never take the initiative to contact customers, but just passively wait for customers to take the initiative to contact them? What kind of service concept is this? If you haven‚Äôt thought about it, then it‚Äôs gone. I have booked it for my parents before and got their approval. I have enough trust to make the choice even though I saw a lot of bad reviews. I came here because I was attracted to a star-rated hotel that was once one of the best. In the end But extremely disappointed!
First of all, after arriving at the hotel at night after a long drive during the Spring Festival, there was no one at the hotel entrance to help carry my luggage (there was a staff member pacing back and forth at the door but turning a blind eye). It was not until he parked the car in the parking space at the door that he said that these parking spaces were even for the hotel. There is also a fee, because it is contracted out, so you have to park in a parking building farther away to enjoy free parkingüòáüòáüòáSpeechless!
Furthermore, after entering the store, the Chinese New Year guests didn‚Äôt say a word of greeting and asked why there was no one at the door. They explained that after eating, no one showed up with a smile to help deliver the luggage to the room. There was no enthusiasm during the whole process, which is a kind of state-owned unit. The service experience, the response to everything is an instinct to find reasons and excuses.
After looking at the introduction of the constant-temperature swimming pool, the baby was immediately frozen out of the swimming pool. If you want to swim in winter, choose carefully because the outdoor temperature is not satisfactory!
Finally, I packed my luggage and checked the wardrobe when I left the hotel. I left some clothes in the hotel and no one cares about them. I have already mentioned it so I won‚Äôt go into details!
Of course, there must be good things as well as bad things. The partners in the housekeeping depar**ent are very helpful. They provide quilts, slippers, etc. in the middle of the night and respond quickly! üëçüëçüëç
Generally speaking, as Guangzhou is at the forefront of opening up, the earliest star-rated hotel was shot in a China Hotel if I remember correctly that there was a TV series "Miss Public Relations" back then! Today is really different from what it used to be, every year is getting worse! Having said all this is not to vent my emotions, but to express my feelings with a sense of regret! Finally, I hope the hotel can realize that such service is not enough today and keep pace with the times! I also wish China Hotel will get better and better in the future!

The coffee pot was not washed, and the room still felt messy. There were not enough places for breakfast in the morning, and the service Slow, it took a long time to clean the coffee machine grounds, and the milk was not replenished for a long time.

Fourth, the hotel room is on a non-smoking floor, with no peculiar smell, good-quality carpet, and comfortable bedding. Although there is some floating dust on the paint surface and wardrobe in the room, it is within an acceptable range. On the whole, it is cost-effective, and I will consider staying in this hotel when I come to Guangzhou in the future.

msg:Comment as a new guest
 First of all, as a local, I have always known about China Hotel, which is also a very early five-star hotel. This time, I booked a room for friends when they came to visit. In the middle, there was a situation that basically never happened in the hotel. Thanks to Manager Alicia Liu for helping us solve this problem and upgrading our room to a large suite for free. The overall evaluation is in line with the price. Let's talk about the situation I encountered as a self-driving tourist this time. And what does the hotel do well? Let me talk about the advantages first:
1. The design of the room is a**ospheric and simple, the light is good for taking pictures, and the ventilation system is excellent. Good air quality is good for taking pictures. The air conditioner is well cooled, and the pillows and beds are very comfortable.
2. There are no malicious charges in the room. Free coffee and tea bags and water are provided, as well as express check-out service.
3. The room service is efficient, and any needs can be resolved quickly.
4. Rich buffet breakfast.
Now is where I think it falls short.
1. About hotel parking and check-in
You have to park in the parking lot with several floors on the right to enjoy free parking in the accommodation. If you park at the door, it seems that you need to pay for it. I don‚Äôt think there are clear guidelines. You have to understand it yourself. If you drive directly to the parking lot at the beginning, you have to take the elevator in the parking lot to the second floor and then go to the floor of the lobby. You have to go down the stairs like the red line in the picture, which is very troublesome.
Or just go down to the first floor and walk to the lobby
Especially with luggage. I can understand that you can't go directly to the lobby due to the age, but you can make a floor on the second floor for customers to check in? ? ? In short, it was very uncomfortable to go.
Another thing to note is that if you are a guest, you can park for free, but every time you go out, you need to talk to the service staff at the service desk on the right hand side of the lobby, and he will help you cancel the fee.
I was stuck at the exit. I told me it was free, but I had to go again. I saw more than one resident had this kind of problem. If you inform this kind of basic thing in advance, or sign it in the parking building, it will be fine. There is no prompt for the problem to be solved. Do the residents have to pay? ? ?
2. The problem with the elevator logo. If you are on the first floor, if you are staying in the elevator for the first time, the logo on the outside of the elevator is 1-6 floors or something. If you are on the 8th floor or above, you need to enter the elevator to see it. This is obviously the logo. It's not good.
3. The disappearance of the executive lounge
4. It seems that the proficiency of the staff is not very high

msg:The exterior looks relatively old, but I didn't expect the interior to have a hole in the sky. A**ospheric but not rough, elegant but not complicated. The floor height of the lobby is slightly low, but the flower decoration is beautiful. The front desk, concierge, and room service staff are all well-trained, courteous, enthusiastic and not hypocritical, fully demonstrating the heritage of an old-fashioned hotel.

Because I have two children, I asked for a quiet room without an elevator, and the hotel satisfied them all. What is even more commendable is that I arrived at 11:00 in the morning, and the front desk saw that there was a vacancy, and directly opened a room for me, allowing me to rest for a few hours.

The size of the room is large, and there are two 1.4-meter beds, so one big and one small can sleep in the same bed without feeling crowded. The bedding is relatively soft, and the mattress has a good support effect, and it doesn't collapse after sleeping; the towels and bathrobes also feel good. I called the service center to ask for children's products, and they delivered them in less than ten minutes. It can be said that it is both internal and external, and the hardware and software are good.

Another plus point of the hotel is convenience. First, the location is convenient, just a short distance from Yuexiu Park and the Nanyue King's Tomb. Second, it is convenient to eat and drink. There are various restaurants and restaurants in the hotel, including buffet, Japanese food, snacks, fast food, desserts, bakeries, etc. You can‚Äôt even fully appreciate the hotel‚Äôs own store after staying for one night. A few hundred meters away, there are old shops such as Yuexiu Fishing Village and Xinwenji. When I left the store, I packed a few breads in the bakery, and the children ate them all before arriving at Guangzhou South Railway Station.

Next time I come to Guangzhou, I will never go to another place, I will just live here!

2 But this side door has an opening time, but it is not written out, and points will be deducted slightly.
3 The hotel has about 12 floors, and the corridor is low and short, which is flawed, but the bottom floor of the room is normal.
4 The rooms all use international and domestic multi-purpose sockets, which is worth extra points. In addition, all sockets have usb-a and usb-c, which is convenient for those who forget to bring a charger, and it is also convenient for those who need to charge more. It is worth adding points.
5 The swimming pool and sauna are worth extra points, and how to lend slippers to users is even more worth extra points.
6 There is a public bath with hot water on the fourth floor. If the water temperature can be displayed and a clock can be provided, it is worth adding points.
7 The door drum of the room may be loose, and every morning when the doors of other rooms are opened and closed, there is a loud sound of closing the door. This definitely takes points.
8 It is suggested that a small usb fan can be prepared in the room to facilitate guests to dry their clothes. Especially those who go swimming.

The hotel itself is okay, but after the reservation was made, the front desk called the guest privately and told the guest that the business travel price was too low and they could not receive the guest at the original price, which made me speechless. They also said in a condescending manner that after applying for three-day accommodation, they only need to pay the price difference for one day? I was confused at the airport. Setting the business travel agreement price in the background is the hotel's business. If a business manager maliciously adjusts the price, it is the platform's business. What does it have to do with me, a guest who is about to check in?
The front desk handling business is extremely unprofessional. I really don‚Äôt know what the current managers of China Hotel are doing in terms of front desk operation training.

msg:As a gold card customer of the hotel, the hotel has upgraded the room according to the membership benefits, and the room facilities are good. Room attendants are warm and courteous. However, Ms. Pan, the hotel front desk manager on duty, did a very poor job of using the executive lounge for gold card customers. On the second morning after checking in, I wanted to go to the executive lounge to have some snacks and drinks (this hotel is an old five-star hotel in Guangzhou, it is unbelievable that there is no executive lounge, it just asks guests for each meal time Go to different restaurants to dine, there is no executive lounge service for guests to rest, eat snacks and drinks in other time periods), call the customer service hotline and please provide some cookies and coconut milk (coconut milk was used during the previous check-in, afternoon tea and Happy hour is provided to guests at the designated restaurant on the fourth floor), these are the food and drinks that should be provided in the hotel executive lounge, but the switchboard said to ask for instructions. Afterwards, Ms. Pan, the manager on duty at the front desk, called and told very rudely that there was no coconut milk, and that the executive lounge service did not provide coconut milk, only Coke Sprite. This manager Pan very bluntly rejected the reasonable demands of gold card customers. I want to ask you that you don‚Äôt provide coconut milk, why do you provide it in the designated restaurant on the 4th floor during happy hour and afternoon tea? Later, I asked whether to change two cans of Jianlibao drink (this drink is available in the western restaurant on the second floor), but was also rejected by the manager Pan. Afterwards, nearly an hour after complaints from Ctrip, the service hotline of the hotel group, and manager Liang at the front desk, it was delivered by the supervisor of the food delivery depar**ent. The group customer service hotline replied that the hotel would apologize for this, but no apology has been received from the hotel until the check-out. When checking out, I also wrote a guest letter and put it in the room to the hotel general manager, asking the hotel general manager to see how your duty manager treats gold card member customers. The manager on duty does not know how to deal with the problem. He handles the problem simply and rudely. He does not take the customer as the center, thinks of the customer's strengths, and provides high-quality service to the customer. Instead, he acts condescending. The hotel group's hotline said he did not reply and apologize. arrive. China World Hotel was known for its service when it was managed by the Hong Kong side, but now the Lingnan Group is managing it and its service is getting worse and worse. It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt provide 24-hour service in the executive lounge, and you don‚Äôt even provide the rights that gold card members should enjoy, which is really shocking.

The bed was great and there was a big bathtub where my mom could take a bath! Because my mother is a pure vegetarian, I was afraid that it would be difficult to order takeout, so I included two buffet breakfasts when I booked the room. Unexpectedly, the restaurant was so big and there were so many varieties of food. My mother ate more than usual and it suited her taste. ! All in all, we were both very satisfied with this trip!

Getting out of the car to help take luggage and open and close the door makes people feel at home from the very beginning. For that alone, I can give it full marks.
  I arrived at the store around 12:00, and the room was not ready. The front desk informed the room situation in time. After going out, the room will be ready. Since I like to see the scenery, the hotel also gave me a room with a very good view. There are no problems with bedding and hygiene.
  Since the abalone cake of China World Hotel was recommended by a famous restaurant in Guangzhou, I specially tasted it during the morning tea time. The taste is really good, and the service is also very high-quality. The price is slightly more expensive than Beiyuan and other old restaurants by 10%, but the service is considerate and acceptable.
  In the evening, go to the hotel's martini bar and taste the hotel's special martini. The environment and service are very satisfactory.
  The traffic location is excellent, and there are many restaurants around. China Hotel will be my first choice when I come to Guangzhou in the future. It is a very satisfying experience.

This trip is basically a tour of old hotels. Not only was it shocking before, but it is not bad now. The lobby and guest rooms have been slightly renovated, and the Four Seasons China has been completely renovated, and the experience is not bad.

Old hotels are better than old hotels, and the morning tea in Zhongjiu is quite good. The breakfast room also has a look, it's a very big place, completely refurbished.

More than half of the hand soap was opened and used, and no extra soap was given as a spare for three days. The used water cup had some water in it, so I didn't replace it and just put a paper lid on it. There is no basket for towels and bath towels in the bathroom and can only be placed on the ground.

msg:As a person who often travels and stays in hotels, the China Hotel is really bad. It ruined my impression of state-owned hotels. In the future, I should stay honestly in international chains. I didn‚Äôt want to give one star at first, but in the end I gave it one because of the location of the hotel. As a platinum member, I really remind friends who have requirements for the hotel to avoid pitfalls.
        First of all, it has nothing to do with a five-star hotel. There are doormen but no service. They won‚Äôt help you with heavy luggage, and they won‚Äôt take the initiative to say hello. It feels like a state-owned hotel.
        Secondly, the room service is even worse. Toiletries are not replenished every day, and coffee and tea are not replenished. Unless you humblely call the room service to ask for it, it is difficult to get through the phone, and someone will answer it after ringing seven or eight times. The worst thing is that the dirty towels and bath towels are placed in the bathtub, and the room cleaning will not care about them at all, and they will not replace them with new ones. They also have to ask for them humblely when they return to the hotel after playing in the middle of the night.
       The air conditioner in the room is manually adjusted by Honeywell's machinery. The noise is very loud, which affects sleep. The ceiling of the overall environment is old, the spotlights flicker seriously, and the environment is very poor. The room attendants will not take the initiative to show their favor when they meet, and they look like why do you come to live here and bother me.
      I have never stayed in such a bad hotel, and it is called a five-star hotel. I will never stay there again. I remind my friends to avoid the pitfalls again! ! !

1. The executive lounge is closed, and many services are missing. Learn from the Ritz-Carlton in this point, the room is also full, and the service is not sloppy at all.
2. During the peak season of the Chinese New Year, the service is a bit lacking, which is understandable; but no one answers the phone repeatedly, it should not be.
3. None of the cabinet doors of the executive suite can be closed properly, it really shouldn't be.
4. The work of the doorman at the front desk needs to be strengthened. He is the first person the guests actually face.
Finally, I still want to praise the room cleaning staff. It is not easy to clean up hundreds of guest rooms a day.

The four elderly people were tired and unwell after a day, and repeatedly asked to share a room to rest first. The hotel ignored them and was unwilling to inform the check-in time, so the four unwell elderly people went out for a few hours and came back to ask. They were indifferent and ** throughout the whole process.
After 10 o'clock that night, the hotel gave us a room because the elderly had nowhere to stay and were extremely uncomfortable. But it was completely inconsistent with the booked room type.
The room delivered to us by the hotel was completely substandard, and there were obvious stains on the quilt. The hotel replied that it had to be approved by the leader before it could be replaced, and then refused because there was no replacement. Finally, Ctrip intervened and communicated for three days before it was replaced.
The hotel breached the contract many times throughout the whole process without any apology. Ctrip repeatedly informed that the person in charge of the hotel could not be contacted. After I clearly stated that Ctrip asked to communicate with them, the other party also ignored it. This may be the confidence of the old five-star hotel, which is really lawless.

msg:An old-fashioned 5-star hotel with an excellent location. It takes half an hour to take a taxi from Baiyun Airport to the high-speed highway. It is very close to all major attractions in the city. The side door can also enter the subway in seconds. There is a Starbucks Burger King Domino's in the building, all kinds of conveniences. Due to the relatively long stay during the Spring Festival, I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite. The overall stay experience is still great. Of course, there are still some flaws. One of the rooms I booked had a strong smell from the toilet sewer, and it was facing the bed. I had to close the bathroom door tightly at night. The second is that during the Spring Festival, there are more guests and it is understandable that the room is tidied later, but one day they did not clean the room directly, and did not ask if they needed to replenish the room supplies, which is a bit outrageous for a five-star hotel. It's not the hotel's problem at all, but the hotel is on a landing route at Baiyun Airport. If the wind direction is unlucky, the plane will land every 2 minutes. It is still a bit noisy in the dead of night.
Finally, the hotel's Four Seasons Restaurant has a good morning tea. Many locals come, and there is a 20% discount for guests. It is worth trying.

msg:I have a question, is China World Hotel a state-owned unit? The name is so majestic, but each employee is worth 250,000 to 80,000 yuan. The employees who come into contact with from the front desk to the guest room have no sense of service. Is it because the workload during the Spring Festival is not proportional to the overtime pay? I paid more than 1,600 for one night on the executive floor (it is understandable that it is more expensive during the Spring Festival, but I enjoy services that are less than three-star). I don‚Äôt spray randomly, and I always respect the service industry very much. This time, I have a specific case for your reference:
1. Arrive early at 12:00 noon. We understand the rules of five-star hotels. First go through the formalities at the front desk. It doesn‚Äôt matter if there is no room to vacate. Let them come at 2 o‚Äôclock, so I wandered out until 4:30 and went back to the hotel front desk to check in. After getting up in the long queue, it will take about 40 minutes. Is it convenient to find a guy who looks like a manager in the lobby, just to get a room card, but this handsome guy who looks like a manager said with a cold face that you can only wait in line , I can‚Äôt even get the room card, so I can‚Äôt help you. Is this the five-star service language? No wonder there was an old couple arguing with the front desk when we checked in at 12:00 noon and slapped the table. At that time, I wondered why the hotel handled the problem so badly. No matter how noisy the guests were at the front desk, they couldn‚Äôt find a solution. traces can be followed;
2. The hotel's facilities are outdated. I had already prepared for it. I didn't expect that the windows in the room couldn't be closed tightly. The whistling north wind was blowing and screaming, and it was facing the road. It was so noisy that I couldn't sleep. I went back after dinner. I called the front desk at 9:30 p.m. when I arrived at the room. No one came until 10:30 p.m. I went out to find someone in the lobby. I met an older lady on the floor and said "Hello..." before she finished speaking. He didn't reply "Say!" After listening to it, he came to the room aggressively and took out the window key to try for a few seconds, fiddling with it and said: "I also want to lock the window for you. If it doesn't lock tightly, what can I do? The problem should have been mentioned earlier, no one will do this for you now", I said, "I told you an hour ago", "You should have said it during the rounds in the morning", "What did I say to check? Did not check in"! ...Finally tossing and closing it, I slammed the door and left.
3. Others: Parking is in the three-dimensional garage, which is far away from the hotel room. It is very inconvenient to go up and down through n corridors and stairs. The room is relatively small, and the toiletries are low-grade. A hand splashed all over.
It is not objective enough to talk about the disadvantages alone. There are still some advantages if we insist on picking the advantages, that is, the hotel's location (above the subway, near the old railway station, and the second park), and the softness and hardness of the bed are more comfortable.
Finally, if you want to spend the same money, there are many choices. If you want to find kishou, please choose Zhongshu.

First of all, we arrived at the hotel at 8 o'clock in the morning. The hotel happened to have a room and checked us in immediately.
Second, the room is very clean and has no peculiar smell. It is no different from the picture. The hot water is very large. The twin room is two 1.4m. It is neither soft nor hard when you sleep, and you can rest well.
Third, the subway station is just outside the door, there is Yuexiu Park next to it, and there is a bit of Dude on the opposite side. It is very convenient to go anywhere.
Fourth, there is a lion dance performance on the morning of the first day of the ***** new year. Tourists from the north said that they almost shed tears. Guangzhou people take the New Year too seriously.
Fifth, the most important point is that the service of this hotel is very, very good. Every hotel staff we met was so warm and polite. Thank you for allowing us to spend two pleasant days.

This may also have something to do with my personal physical habits. It would be better if the mattress was harder.
In addition, during the Spring Festival, the prices of many hotels have increased several times, and the Chinese hotels are almost the same as usual, which is the conscience of the industry. Originally, this time I came to experience the traditional culture and customs of Guangzhou, so it is a good choice to live here.

msg:Zhongjiu is an old-fashioned five-star hotel. It has been nearly 30 years since its establishment. As a native of Guangzhou, this is the first time I have the opportunity to bring my family to experience it in person. Thanks to AVA who helped us check in. From a modern aesthetic point of view, although the hotels on the new central axis are more luxurious, Zhongjiusheng can play its own characteristics and at the same time be more close to the people. The buffet dinner at Lilang Restaurant has a dazzling variety of varieties, as well as many Cantonese specialties, such as pork trotters, ginger vinegar, radish and beef offal. Jelly taro balls are also my favorite. Handmade lemon tea is also featured. The swimming pool is a plus for swimming enthusiasts, clean and tidy. The wellness center also has a spa pool, dry and wet steaming. In short, the heritage of the old five-star hotel is still there. I hope to continue to update and maintain the facilities, improve the guidelines for the use of the facilities, and let the Chinese wine continue to shine. Anecdote: It became popular shortly after check in. In order to open the draining device of the washbasin, after probing the mechanism behind the faucet and pressing down, the skin immediately broke and bleeds. The reason is that the launching mechanism is relatively small. When pressing it, the hand needs to be close to the track behind the faucet, and the sides of the track are relatively sharp. It is easy to cause accidents. Later, I asked the hotel to send a hemostatic sticker and reminded the waiter to report it to the leader.

Although the outdoor constant temperature swimming pool is not big, it takes into account the deep, medium and shallow water levels to meet different needs. The family spent a pleasant Mid-Autumn Festival in Zhongjiu. As an old five-star hotel in Guangzhou, Zhongjiu maintains a very good standard!

We were very satisfied, especially the staff at the front desk, who patiently helped us solve problems one by one. Therefore, when we go to Guangzhou on business this year, our first choice is the China Hotel. It is the Mid-Autumn Festival. The hotel also offers a box of moon cakes to the guests, which is especially heart-warming. During our stay at the hotel, the hotel's service was as good as ever, especially Gina, Amy from the front desk and Lauren from the reservation depar**ent answered our questions and provided high-quality service, and we were very satisfied.

msg:After staying for four days, I gave the hotel service 0 points. It was a very unpleasant experience. I thought I didn't need any extra services when I went out early and returned late, and I didn't care about the smiles of five-star hotels. Unexpectedly, China World Hotel let me know that I have been enjoying meticulous service in other hotels, but these basic services are not here.
d1: checkin gave a connected room, separated from another room by a wooden door, and the sound of laughing and chatting next door at night was thunderous and lifelike. I have lived in many hotels for decades and never had this experience.
d2: Change the room. When I returned to the hotel at night, I found that the room card was invalid. I went to the front desk to deal with it.
d3: When I went back to the hotel at night, I found that the room card was invalid again. I went to the front desk to deal with it. The process was very unpleasant. Your attitude towards hotel guests is very problematic.
d4: I went back to the hotel to take a shower at night, and asked the room service for an extra bath towel and towel. The auntie stood at the door and had to ask me to take a used towel from the room and replace it with a clean one in her hand. They want compensation. Surprised me, there is such an operation? Is this something guests need to know? What does it mean? So I checked the number of towels in the room and found that cleaning up during the day did not provide me with a standard number of towels, so I had to call the customer service center to clarify. Residents can't bear such ****!

I finally checked out today, I feel so tired living here! You say that they don't smile and don't serve well. It's not right. It depends on who the guests are, such as the distinguished guests sitting in Coaster that they saw with their own eyes at the entrance of the hotel.

The location of the hotel is good, opposite Yuexiu Park, the subway station is downstairs, and there are many options for eating around.
The hotel has a lot of Chinese-style furnishings and classical elements from top to bottom, suitable for people who like this style. The room is really too small according to the current five-star standard. The most critical floor height is really too low and too depressing, especially the bathroom. The room is already small and looks even smaller. Also the ventilation in the room is really bad.
The mattress should be the foundation of the previous Marriott, it is very comfortable, even if it is a hot day or a thick down cup, it is not good to sleep no matter what.
The price is relatively reasonable, it is the price depression of five-star hotels in Guangzhou, so the overall cost performance is ok.

I changed to a double bed room in an apar**ent. I took the price of a hotel room and gave me an apar**ent room. I even lied to me that it was an upgraded suite. What is the price of your hotel room and the price of an apar**ent room? I changed my two big beds into an apar**ent suite and an apar**ent with a big bed room. They said it was upgraded. The facilities, supplies, and services in the apar**ent are different from those in the hotel. There is no phone to reach the front desk. Anyway, it took a lot of money. For the money of the China Hotel, I lived in an apar**ent. I didn't see the service of the first batch of five-star hotels in China, nor did I experience the facilities of the five-star hotels, and I didn't ask for the price difference.

The reception team at the front desk of the hotel was very warm and polite, especially Aaron, the guest service manager, who upgraded the room for us and personally took us to the room after checking in, and introduced the facilities and equipment of the room and the opening time of breakfast in detail. , the service process is very professional and natural, which is very in line with the five-star status of China Hotel. Although it is no longer managed by Marriott, the service of China Wine under the management of Lingnan Group has not been reduced in the past, or even surpassed. The staff you meet in the food street will also say hello. The food street's products are still so good, which is obviously inseparable from the strength of an excellent management team. The newly renovated room made me feel at home, very warm and comfortable, with Chinese style and Lingnan characteristics. The refurbished Lilang restaurant has both Lingnan characteristics and a very international style. The overall stay experience is very good. I will continue to choose to stay next time and recommend it to my friends!

üîîService: The check-in and check-out are very meticulous and thoughtful, which is worthy of praise. There is a Mr. Li in the lobby. He didn't ask his full name. His demeanor and conversation kept the hotel in an international style. He also enthusiastically helped my parents to introduce subway travel. Thank you again.

Went for breakfast at 9:00 and told me that there is no more vegetable salad, and there will be no more on that day. No cheese, salami or anything else. I specially set a double morning to take the client to dinner and talk about things, that's it? ?
Ironing the clothes, the suit was sent back without ironing, and the bottom hem was obviously still wrinkled out of the box. I insist on refunding this part.
I checked out at noon on Saturday, 30 hours have passed, and the invoice has not been emailed.
You are an old brand in Guangzhou, can you please make a face!

Transportation: The location is excellent and the transportation is convenient. There is a subway station downstairs. It is Line 2 to go out. It is convenient to go everywhere. It is next to Yuexiu Park and has many dining options.
Hygiene: The bedding is very comfortable, the overall style in the room is relatively dignified, the room is fairly large, the dry and wet are separated, the desks and recliners are available, the mattress is comfortable, and the ventilation facilities are not loud. The fruits in the room are exquisite, and there is a thoughtful welcome card. The whole is very clean and organized.
Service: The overall service is very good, attentive and fast. It can be seen from the details that it is caring and thoughtful. The cleaning aunt will greet warmly. The service of this hotel is humane. This time the room is upgraded to a suite. The breakfast is quite rich, there are freshly made rice rolls, and the service is good. This stay met many of our needs, responded promptly and praised their professionalism, which is better than what I did when I came to the Marriott era.
Environment: The environment is beautiful, the lobby is elegant, the facilities are well-maintained, and the fragrance makes people happy. The swimming pool and garden are amazing, the gym is also spacious, there is free parking, many optional dining restaurants on the first floor, and the hotel‚Äôs own Chinese and Western restaurants. Food Street is a time-honored brand.
Travelers like us need a feeling of going home. It has remained the same for decades. This stay is impeccable, a great hotel, and I have the opportunity to stay again next time.

The room environment of a five-star hotel is no different from that of an ordinary express hotel. I'm not sorry for the price at all. Very disappointed. Moreover, walking from the parking lot to the lobby, it feels like you have circled the 18th bend of the mountain road. Can you imagine the feeling of walking with a bunch of things and never reaching the end! ! ! It is also a service, and the experience is not good enough. The overall experience and environment of the nearby Dongfang Hotel is much better than this one, and it is also cheaper than this one. Anyway, I won't book a second time.

The only description is that the transportation is convenient. The subway station is downstairs, the surrounding public transportation, and the dining is very convenient. Hotel services: Almost none, except for check-in and check-out procedures that other 5-star hotels should have. Hotel guest room: Because it was renovated just last year, we booked for 2 nights and it was completely different when entering the room. 1. The room as a whole (including furniture) is outdated and the lights are dim. 2. Various electrical switches are old (similar in style 10 years ago) 3. Bathroom mirrors have been oxidized. 4. Poor sound insulation (separate a door from the room next door). 5. Parking is a big trouble. The garage is estimated to be 4 to 5 hundred meters away from the lobby. The road back to the lobby is very complicated. It will be a corridor for a while, an elevator for a while, a corridor for a while, an elevator for a while, and you have to go through other shops. , Dizzy. Breakfast: It is not good to comment because it does not include breakfast. In summary, how did the hotel score 4.7 points? When we left the store, the clerk asked us to give us good reviews.

Besides the room, I ordered a deluxe room. I was lucky and upgraded to the suite because I didn't use the room in the hotel properly because of my work. It was a shame. Upgraded suites, a full 60 square meters, one living room and two bathrooms, the layout is magnificent, and it makes a lot of money.

msg:China Hotel is an old five-star hotel, and I planted the seeds in my heart when I was young. When the Liuhua area used to be very prosperous, China Hotel has always been very prosperous. Now the commercial characteristics of the entire area have changed, there has been more competition, and the prices of China Hotel have become more affordable. However, the quality still maintains the old five-star level. The service is warm and courteous, and there are several types of coffee in the cupboard. The experience is good. Will come again next time.
