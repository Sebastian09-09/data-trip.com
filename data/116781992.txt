msg:After longing for it, I finally came to Chongzuo and settled in the Huashan Hotel owned by Shengmei. The simple and retro style is unique and combines with the natural environment to complement each other. The hotel room is clean and comfortable, the breakfast is also very good, especially the afternoon tea is exquisite, and the price-performance ratio is very high. Just in time for the event, there were terrace bar singers in the evening and water sports during the day. I was very happy all day long. We have just left and are already planning our next trip.

Manager Hu and her team gave us a full range of comfortable experience, especially in the details. They gave us green-grown small bananas to take with us, and local handmade brown sugar for us to taste. It was very special and took us to play outdoors along the way. It was really relaxingüòé. I think I will recommend this place to My other friends, let them all experience it! Really good! Come again next time!
Service: Very goodüëç

msg:Don't step into the trap! Friends who are traveling, check it out! This so-called resort located in Chongzuo Huashan Rock Painting Scenic Area, no place can be worthy of this place that is rated as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage. 1/The resort is still in trial operation, and it is not marked on Ctrip. The room next to us is still rough (see pictures 6 and 7); 2/The hotel has no bellman and no reasonable lobby. The ones who came out to carry our luggage were the little girl at the front desk and people in chef uniforms. They still needed to carry our luggage up the stairs to the front desk under the scorching sun); 3/The room did not have the minimum hotel facilities that a hotel should have. , for example, there is space for luggage, not to mention luggage racks; for example, there is no hook on the wall to hang towels next to the washstand as soon as you enter the door; 4/Room Ctrip says it is 84 square meters, but in fact it is only about half. I guess they included the balcony outside; 5/The so-called private bath is just such a simple pool (Picture 5); 6/The cabinet in the room is opened and there are various wires (Picture 1); 7/The room decoration is simple (see picture) ). The balcony door handle was installed very close to the door frame, and the fingers of two adults were pinched one after another; 8/Breakfast is not necessary, except for the quality, the smell of paint in the breakfast room immediately gave us a headache (the child immediately went out to the front desk without eating a bite). Such an environment is only worthy of the house price of 288 yuan, but it was charged 2888 yuan! It is said that after the official opening, more people will be ripped off! I feel so sorry for the waiters here. It's useless for them to apologize, it's not their fault! It is a shoddy project created by unscrupulous developers and operators.

msg:This time I was traveling with my daughter. It was really tiring to drive alone with a three-year-old baby. We arrived at a little after one o'clock that day and didn't have time to have lunch. The housekeeper immediately gave us a fruit plate after we checked in. What I like most is that the room has an independent bathing pool. The children can bathe whenever they want, and I can free my hands.
It was really beautiful to take pictures at sunset. The next morning the housekeeper took us to play water sports. We were so lucky to see a peacock in full bloom on the way back.
The furniture in the room is relatively new, as is the bedding. I heard it is a new store and it is worth a trip. Next time I will bring my parents here to soak in the hot springs.

What surprised me most was that the hotel even had water entertainment projects. Due to time constraints, I didn't have the opportunity to experience it this time, and I will definitely come again next time. What I felt was not enough before checking in was that the water temperature was unstable, sometimes hot and sometimes cold, and I hope it can be improved in the future. The breakfast products are very good and taste good. I just feel that the environment of the restaurant is relatively simple. The housekeeper introduced that their restaurant is expanding, and there will be a bar in the future. I am looking forward to it. I hope I can experience it next time I come.

I waited a long time to check in, but no one greeted me. The hotel facilities are almost zero, and half of the area is still under construction. Only the remaining facilities of the previous hotel can be operated. There is no gym or swimming pool. Although there are signs, the service staff said there are none when asked. #The service is not worth the price at all. The facilities and services of the hot spring hotel next to it are much more mature. In short, it is not worth the price overall. I originally brought my children here, and the only children's facilities are the zoo. The prices of water projects are relatively high, almost catching up with the five-star level of Sanya #Location and transportation are average, and it is easy to find

The restaurant is extremely small! Service is seriously lagging! Not worth the 4,800 yuan room charge for that day! Especially there are no tourist packages around Huashan Hot Spring Resort! I just wanted to eat some Chinese food and local specialties. After driving for more than ten minutes, I couldn't find a restaurant that was open! There are construction sites everywhere! It can be described as a wilderness! In the end, I had to be sent to the only hotel to arrange a meal! Can't bear to look back! I will never go to Chongzuo Ningming Huashan Hot Spring Resort or this hotel next time!
