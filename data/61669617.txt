msg:I went on a long-planned weekend trip with my sisters. The health care concierge took the initiative to contact us before we checked in, gave us a detailed course introduction and professional recommendations, and made an itinerary according to our needs. She was very considerate! ! Every employee I met when I arrived at the hotel was very welcoming, especially Tommy, Lynn and Cara at the front desk who were very considerate! The room is full of Zen feeling. The balcony faces Yangcheng Lake. The environment is comfortable and pleasant, and the lighting is very good! üå∏üå∏
The first project I experienced was sound bowl therapy. Under the meditation guidance of the therapist, my body and mind were relaxed, and distracting thoughts were calmed. The private lesson I chose was Pilates. The teacher in the introductory course was very patient and provided one-on-one guidance. As I don‚Äôt usually exercise much, my strength is relatively weak, so I felt a little stressed when I put on the equipment. But I gradually lost myself in the encouragement and praise from the teacher, and I tried my best to complete it hahaha. The boxing class in the evening is also very interesting, and Coach Wang has a great attitude! Patiently guided and explained to us, it felt so good to be sweating profusely, ü•ä The "hot and scalding" experience was perfect. After the exercise, the butler was waiting at the door of the gym and sent us directly to the SPA to experience the 12-step hot bath cycle. The staff will introduce the functions of each instrument/room one by one, making it a ritual-filled exploration journey. üïäÔ∏èüïäÔ∏è
I had a long sleep the next day and almost missed the time wave experience. I turned on my phone and found that the concierge lady from Kangyang had helped to coordinate and postpone it, leaving us enough time to have breakfast. She is a warm-hearted lady with a beautiful and kind heart. Love it! ü•∞ü•∞
The entire park is very large, but for each project there is a concierge specialist who will send us to the corresponding location. The service is very professional and all small requests will be met as best as possible! The itinerary was very suitable for our needs and very fulfilling. In terms of communication, it also reflects the professionalism of the hotel staff. The respect for privacy and the appropriate reminders make people feel warm and comfortable! The hotel facilities are very complete, and the meals are also focused on health. The calories of each food are accurately marked, which complements the fitness classes and focuses on being delicious, healthy and burden-free. The open kitchen allows you to see the chef's preparation process, the food is exquisite, and you are lucky enough to see the beautiful sunset! ! An immersive experience of healing! ! Thank you to all the staff for a perfect stay! ! Very satisfied and will bring my family here next time! ! ü§óü§óü§ó

msg:Five stars are not enough to express my satisfaction with this hotel. It can be said that it is the best resort hotel in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai. The premise is that you have the vision to appreciate itü§£ü§£From design, meals, to the provided services The course experience is very unique and has never been experienced in other hotels of the same price range.
üåüLet‚Äôs talk about the hotel design and facilities first: the natural environment is seamlessly connected to Yangcheng Lake. The design focuses on nature, local culture and environmental protection. The architectural style is low-key and simple but full of integration with local culture. It is said that it was designed by a disciple of I.M. Pei , in short, very interesting. The building materials are basically made of natural materials. It is low-key and simple but full of vitality. I like the style very much. The details inside the guest rooms are also very user-friendly and environmentally friendly. For example, no single-use plastic products are used, and mineral water is packaged in free-brand glass and paper bottles. This alone is better than many big-name hotelsüëç
üåüService: The standard is very high. From the front desk to the restaurant, spa center and guest rooms, all the service staff who come into contact can call the guests by their last names and remember their preferences. Many service details are particularly heart-warming. For example, you accidentally mentioned a certain kind of tea that you like to drink in the restaurant the day before. When you rest in the front desk area the next day, a service staff will bring you tea and say this is the tea you liked yesterday. The hotel also provides a wide variety of physical and mental experience courses. Basically, there will be a dedicated person to pick you up and wait before and after each course. The hotel's cleanliness standards are also very good, with basically every corner spotless.
üåüMeals: The hotel's The One restaurant deserves the word "amazing". Because the hotel focuses on physical, mental and spiritual culture, the meals are also vegetarian. We had dinner + breakfast here, and every dish was delicious beyond our expectations. Even the vegetarian wontons for breakfast were so delicious and unforgettable!
üåüAfter talking about the basics, let‚Äôs talk about the most special thing, which is the culture here. This is truly unmatched by other hotels. After staying here for two days and one night, I didn‚Äôt want to play with my mobile phone anymore. I have experienced quantum medical testing, Chanrou, heat therapy, breathing meditation, Tai Chi, musical instrument healing, and cooking classes. Each experience is very unique and can bring physical and mental changes. The teachers are also very professional, and I feel they are even better than the teachers in some professional places in Shanghai. Many projects have not even been seen elsewhere, and you can feel the operators' intentions, which are much better than the so-called "luxury hotels" that are strong on the outside but do the work on the inside.
‚ù§Ô∏èFinal summary: I thought it was not cheap before I came, but I understand everything after I came!

msg:After finishing all kinds of work at the end of the year, I could finally take a break. My friends and I came to Suzhou Yinshuishuitian Health Care Community to completely relax our tired body and mind.
The community is located on the bank of Yangcheng Lake, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city in a quiet and quiet environment. The overall design is very stylish, and the natural volcanic stones, recycled green bricks, dead wood and ship wood that can be seen everywhere embody the original ecological concept.
Yinbo Zen therapy, spa therapy, Pilates, etc. are also very unique. The community's Italian cuisine restaurant will customize customized organic meals according to the different needs of guests, making them more delicious and healthy.
Overall, the stay experience was great. The warm service and complete facilities all left a deep impression on me, which brought a successful conclusion to this healing journey.

The environment was particularly good and quiet, and I was away from the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoyed a two -day and one -night relaxation journey. Every employee is very kind. I know my schedule and can adjust the itinerary appropriately according to my needs, so that I have a better customized experience. The course teacher is also very professional. I personally recommend time waves and sound mantle healing. The teacher's interpretation gives me a deeper awareness of myself, and I have new thinking about my lifestyle. I am very satisfied with the meal. Before I came, I learned that this is a full -vegetarian meal with a nutritionist. After tasting, I like it. I can add enough energy and healthy.

msg:The price of 5880 to stay. Very wronged. A hotel owned by a private owner has no door in the bathroom, and the water is messy. After taking a shower, it is a mess, and the water will be ****** up by the floor mat outside. If you go to wash, you must pay attention to the wet slippers. The TV plays their boss' philosophy on loop. Employees always say "our chairman thinks, our chairman thinks". Their lines: We are not a hotel! We are a mindfulness community. One of them was impressive. "You have to enjoy the courses we design". It was controlled, and it was necessary. Classes are various yoga mindfulness classes. The level of a private lesson is 200 yuan outside. No good. The hotel restaurant engages in health preservation. What kind of set meal is the cauliflower fried rice? Said to be healthy. The only restaurant I can go to is said to be Singaporean food. generally. But only this place can eat. It is the inexplicable 5880. It is neither suitable for adults, nor for children, nor for families, nor for couples. Who is going to meditate? Not even one star. A bit of the style of a 580 yuan country hotel. At night, it is not suitable to go shopping in the hotel after sunset, it is safer to go back to the room. Many places inside are dark, and there are few people, occasionally some cleaning masters appear. Can't describe that feeling. It may be a good idea for them to have a bathing process. There is also an outdoor shower. In the pitch-black environment, a hot steam bath followed by a salt bath is designed, which is not suitable for men and women. Even if Qu Hei is not afraid of showering outside, there are mosquitoes. Next to it is the big lotus pond. It belongs to the big flicker project, anticlimactic. Only slogans remain. ****. The staff all acted like a *** fit. Not good, waste of time and money.

msg:In the past, no matter where I went on vacation, I just ate, drank and swiped my phone in another place. After a few days, I still feel tired and would rather stay at home.
Shuitian was recommended by a friend, and he kept saying that he would try this kind of healing and relaxation. Taking advantage of the long vacation this time, I finally decided to give myself a real vacation.
After booking for three days and two nights, the staff called me in advance and told me about the check-in details, how to get to the hotel, and asked about my physical condition and taboos. Because my friend had stayed there before, I also read their WeChat applet in advance to find out what courses are available in the hotel these days. Inform the staff that I will arrive in the morning, I want to check in early, and I will leave in the evening on the last day. It didn't say that there would be an extra charge, which was very considerate.
When I arrived at the hotel, I was comfortable and completely surrounded by nature. Everywhere you go is green, and the brick walls and wood furniture are very tasteful. The room is very large, and the basic room is more than 40 square meters. There are two large bottles of dried vegetables in the room, which are delicious and healthy. In the evening, there is also scented tea for sleep and beauty. Although I stayed alone, I saw that there were children's slippers in the room, so cute and considerate. The happiest thing is that there is a spa center of several thousand square meters under the whole building. You can enjoy twelve kinds of items at any time. The dressing room is also very clean and high-end. In addition to bathrobes, there are also disposable underwear, which is very hygienic. I heard that there are not many rooms in the hotel, no wonder there are fewer people, so I feel more at ease.
I have never exercised, so I was excited to choose the group class at 7 o'clock in the morning, but fortunately, it is all basic stretching and ball games, so I can also participate. After following the coach, I really feel that my back has relaxed a lot. Sweating slightly, I went back to take a shower and went to have breakfast. The breakfast content is very rich and novel. The menu also shows calories, energy, protein, etc., so you can eat healthy and delicious. I only have one person, so I ordered the small wonton muffin yoghurt. If it is a family, I can order more to share. After breakfast, I went to the classes I signed up for one by one. In the evening, I took the hotel's electric car to visit the entire park.
The sunset and night sky here are really beautiful. I rarely swiped my phone. I also unexpectedly finished reading a book I brought with me, and I was laughed at and contrived when I packed my luggage.
In fact, there are too many details to talk about in Shuitian, and other friends of Amway have already tried it on the National Day. In the past few years, whether it is the epidemic environment, climate change and more and more negative information, people are inexplicably anxious and irritable. Although delicious food and watching dramas can make people forget their troubles for a short time, they can only treat the symptoms but not the root cause. During the three days here, not only the external environment and facilities are relaxing, but also the rhythm and tone of the staff and teachers are soothing, and I have also benefited from some methods of relaxing emotions and mindful thinking. Next time I want to bring my family to experience this paradise.

Thousands of square meters of SPA is invincible, there are twelve kinds of healing items to experience. The herbal steam bath and the Himalayan salt house are my favorites. After an hour, I feel completely transformed.
Hygiene: No blemishes, and the room smells very pleasant.
Service: Even if the service personnel are not responsible for the content, they will try their best to provide the service. Although there are battery cars to pick you up and drop you off everywhere, walking around also feels comfortable, and there is a kind of hermitage enjoyment.
Environment: The environment is beautiful, and every shot is like a painting. In such a transparent and clear place, I really experienced a comfortable rest of body and mind.
The seven major living habits emphasized by the hotel are refreshing, and various courses are arranged from morning to night, with a first-class experience. It was also the first time I came into contact with sound therapy meditation, and I really felt the spiritual purification brought by the singing bowl and the sound of chanting.
Due to the itinerary, it was a pity that we could not stay for a few more days. I hope to come with friends next time to make up for the regret.

There are more physical and mental development, spiritual health, and personal experience projects worth trying. Not so much a hotel, this is a most needed healing and health center. The guest rooms are not sold separately, but they are all in the form of course packages to let you feel and experience in an all-round way. I booked a healing tour for 3 days and 2 nights, and I gained a unique ultimate enjoyment and healing experience, and I will come again next time!

msg:In the end, I still wrote this review. The process is too speechless. I hope my friends will stop this thunder...

I was going to find a hotel for a weekend to relax. I searched the most expensive hotels in Suzhou on Ctrip. There are no good people under the reputation, so I chose the most expensive one, 10,800 for two nights (later stayed for one Night 5880), Premier Lake View Queen Room. It was almost 8 o'clock when we arrived, and speechlessness also began at this time:

Catering: Because it was meal time, I went to the restaurant before going to the room. The waiter gave us 2 pages of menus, both in Chinese and English, which seemed to be quite advanced. , I asked the waiter to order food, and I was told that I can only order Friday's dishes, and there are no other dishes. Okay, let's look again. Although there are two pages, there are only a handful of choices, and there are many dishes when ordering. I didn't have any today... well, let's make do with it. I ordered a few dishes in a hurry. The first beef was too salty. I called the waiter to report the situation, and I was told that this dish was salty... speechless, I think it should be called Yankou. The following dishes were prepared in the same way, which once made us wonder how such a level would be configured in a hotel with such a price... Through this diet, we felt that we would definitely not have a better experience in the next two days, so decisively I decided to retire, but seeing that it was past nine o'clock, the hotel was located in a remote location and we were tired all day, so we thought we'd just stay for one night, okay, it's coming soon...

Guest room: Let me spit out a few points for your reference.
1. The shower room is in a semi-open form, and it is only about 1.2 meters away from the bed. If you are a person who pays more attention to privacy on weekdays, it is recommended to be cautious, because the bath is unobstructed and the water will directly hit the wetlands towel, which also causes you to clearly feel the astringent friction when the skin and the quilt are in contact, and through their later performance, I don‚Äôt believe that they will change the floor towel one by one. On the floor towel‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Privacy, hygiene.
2. Go to sleep after washing. The quilt is the kind of thick and heavy quilt used in winter. The two pillows are the kind of very thick pillows, which are the kind of pillows that you will feel very high. Later I was told that this was because of their concept of health preservation, I don't know what the specific concept is. Okay, we fell asleep, covered the quilt to death, and opened the quilt and it was cold. When we woke up in the morning, our noses were stuffy and we caught a cold.
3. I should have been woken up by a foul smell at 6:00 in the morning. It is no exaggeration. I really woke up. I forgot to close the door of the bathroom at night. The odor of the sewer can wake you up. Can you bear it? Friends, real uppercase suits.
4. The most important thing is here. We drink the drinking water that they can fill by themselves, which is the kind of water that has no pressure seal, no label, no company, and no three certificates, and the glass bottle is reused... I My God, where did the magic come from, is this kind of operation really reasonable and legal? When consumers are raised in your backyard?
As a hotel that costs more than 5,000 a night, how much is it to spend for guests? The refrigerator is as empty as the underground parking lot. I admire this IQ tax.

The above is the hardware, let's talk about the service
From top to bottom, the explanation is the main thing. The dishes are salty and explained that this is salty. The breakfast and the catering manager responded to the situation and were told that they were very comfortable working, very comfortable, haha. Feedback to the lobby manager that the bathroom and bed facilities are their design concepts, and they have prepared 8 types of pillows, saying why we didn't ask, well, my fault...; the toilet smells back, and they are not on the scene and don't know the specifics How about it? Reacting to drinking water, I was told their concept of health preservation, not using plastic bottles, Evian also has glass bottles. Anyway, there are various explanations. After that, we learned that their main focus is health care, and there are many additional conditions to provide. We asked why the guest room is only a part of it, and we were told that it is not, they are independent of each other. This logic seems to...saying that our request for vacation and relaxation is not in line with their hotel...poor words, too much blood loss, I was wrong.

In fact, compared with Ctrip, they should strengthen the review and supervision. If they are doing health care, they should put it in the health care section.

Relative to the hotel, stick to yourself and come on.

Compared with you who read the comments, you said, I have paid this wave of IQ tax! ! !

All the hardware fits the positioning of health preservation. The hotel‚Äôs activities and courses are very full, so you will not be bored. However, the hotel's software really needs to be improved. There will always be information asymmetry in the scheduled courses, which causes many teachers to arrive late, and the subsequent itinerary will be messy. The check-in experience is greatly discounted. I hope the hotel can pay more attention to the improvement of software in the future. In particular, thanks to Kun from the Health Care Concierge. He is responsible for our visit to the water and sky this time. He is very patient and the explanation is also very professional. I also like my hotel very much. After hearing our previous experience, I unexpectedly invited us to dinner, which was very heartwarming. I also gave a lot of points to the hotel, thank you again!
