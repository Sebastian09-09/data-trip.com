msg:Nice hotel co-located with several other new hotel buildings which share the same breakfast area, restaurant and swimming pool. Nicely equipped room with small soaking pool plus patio area. The soaking pool is nice to relax in after a day of dusty sight-seeing.  The daily free snacks in the room are also surprisingly good. Breakfast has a lot of food choices of moderate quality. About 10 minutes by taxi from the lively grape night market food area. Overall it certainly looked significantly nicer than the other hotels we saw in the Turpan area.

One of them said, can I turn on the hot water in the shower? The glass of the shower is translucent. Although it is not clear, the outline can be seen. It is not convenient for families with children. The conditioner cannot be squeezed out. The details need to be improved. The room style and the milk delivered at night are still good. If the details are done well, this B&B is still a very stylish store, worth visiting

After working overtime and staying up late for several months, my energy is low.
I decided to put down my phone and go out with my bestie to relax and return to nature.
I feel relaxed and energetic again.
The environment of this B&B is great. I will definitely come again and chill on the weekend.
It is really photogenic.
It is all in Moroccan style.
It feels like you can take photos without leaving the country.
The room is clean and tidy.
One of the features of their home is that each room has its own courtyard.
Photos are very photogenic during the day and night.
You can take two different photos.
It is recommended to bring a few sets of Looks.

msg:I booked the hotel after reading the recommendation. Overall, it's not bad.
But there are some things that I'm not satisfied with.
1. I saw that they all said they had butler service, but no one contacted me before I arrived at the hotel. After I arrived at the hotel, they didn't tell me that there was butler service. I scanned the bedside sign and added WeChat by myself. . .
2. Maybe it's because there's no butler. When I got to the hotel room, the room I was given at the beginning had cleaning tools on the floor. Later, the front desk changed my room. . .
3. Maybe it's because there's no butler. We booked a suite for 4 people with a tatami. From my experience, most hotels provide bed-making service, but this hotel doesn't. My family and I figured out how to make the bed by ourselves. There were a lot of fluff in the room. There weren't enough quilts and pillows. We asked the hotel to send another set.
4. These are all small things. The biggest problem is that I really can't accept the glass design of the shower room + toilet in the room. It's too transparent! It's embarrassing for a family room with many people! I tried several angles but couldn't avoid it. The lights in the shower room and toilet can't be turned on at all. It's more transparent when turned on. I really don't know what the designer thought of it. I hope people who see the comments can think about it carefully. Couples can ignore it. 
5. My family slept on the tatami and a spider with very long legs crawled on them in the middle of the night. I was shocked. I got up in the middle of the night to look for the spider and worked for half an hour. . .

The hotel also has some aspects worth recommending.
1. The hotel breakfast is still good.
2. The design is full of photos and I like it.
3. The staff are actually very enthusiastic, smiling and polite.
4. Welcome fruit will be given.

I should still give an objective evaluation. I hope the hotel can improve its service level so that it can attract more tourists who come here for its reputation. I hope you can adopt it~

msg:How do you spend a two-day trip around Urumqi?

No more special forces travel

Turpan is a good choice for a September vacation

The weather in northern Xinjiang will gradually cool down after September

Turpan is relatively comfortable at this time, not hot and the temperature is just right

If you come to Xinjiang and don’t have much time, and want to experience the southern and northern Xinjiang

Turpan must be your best choice to experience the culture of ethnic minorities

There are too many attractions here that overlap with southern Xinjiang

And I chose to spend the weekend in the hotel this time

It was really comfortable

I got off work on Friday and asked my girlfriend to drive two and a half hours to the hotel

In fact, I was very tired from driving all the way, but I couldn’t resist the surprise the hotel gave me

The hotel I stayed in was ** **
I felt relaxed as soon as I entered. Under the night light, by the swimming pool, some people were drinking beer and chatting, and some were swimming.
I ordered a drink at the coffee shop and went into the room.
I enjoyed the feeling of a five-star homestay in the room.
Beauty, coffee, and tea were all available.
The next day, I slept in and had brunch in the restaurant.
I searched for things to do nearby. It was a relaxing Buddhist trip.
The antique shop of the Internet celebrity grandfather is 1 km away from the hotel.
After shopping, I went to the Turpan Museum.
Then I returned to the hotel just in time for sunset.
I took some photos in the exotic hotel corridor.
It was really a Thai movie.
I had a few drinks in the lounge at night.
I wanted to experience something new.
We changed rooms and checked into the e-sports room. My girlfriend and I played QQ Speed.
I exposed my age, haha.
But I was very happy.
In the afternoon, we went back to Urumqi with the sunset and listening to songs.
It was great to spend a relaxing weekend like this.
Sometimes, when you go out to play, you really shouldn’t be like what is said on the Internet: sleeping on the bus, taking photos when you get off the bus, and knowing nothing when you come back.
Since we are traveling, vacationing, and spending the weekend, please relax.
I felt relaxed during the two days and two nights of enjoying the service in the hotel.
My girlfriend and I are willing to put down our phones to enjoy the starry sky and feel the temperature difference between day and night in Turpan.
See the history of Turpan in the past.
Leave some time for yourself.

Huanghe Suji has become famous in recent years.
We also have one in Xinjiang‼ ️
That is - Turpan Yuefeng Suji~
✔️Exotic style
✔️Perfect facilities
Please 🙏🏻Come to Xinjiang Turpan for a self-driving trip
You must stay here ahhh‼ ️

Yuefeng Suji
is a collection of B&B elements
Positioning ranges from mass to high-end
Unique and novel
Various styles
There is always one that suits you
The most distinctive feature is the B&B's exterior
However you shoot, it's super photogenic📸
Here, the common architectural styles of ethnic minorities such as Kashgar Ancient City in southern Xinjiang are adopted🕌
Interlaced, carved beams and painted buildings, colorful light and shadow💓

As for supporting facilities, it goes without saying
Outdoor swimming pool, terrace barbecue, bar, cafe, convenience store, spa... everything is available
Whether it is a date between lovers, a family trip or a parent-child study tour, you can spend a whole day without leaving the park

For me, e-sports loft is the king of cost-effectiveness
The first floor is the e-sports area and leisure area
The second floor is the bedroom and other rest areas
The computer configuration is high and the seats are also professional
When it is the hottest at noon, you can come back to rest and play video games
The whole arrangement is perfect

Babies
Go ahead with confidence😌

Moroccan style / outdoor swimming pool / film-making holy land / high-end coffee
Sisters who promised me to go to the northwest must not miss it!!
Moroccan style is full of vacation feeling
Walk into the room with floor-to-ceiling glass windows, chairs, sofas, and fireplaces
Every piece of furniture is warm and comfortable and safe

The entire Suji shares a swimming pool. We originally booked this place just for playing in the water. However, when we checked in, the water was temporarily turned on and there was only one small pool. The water was cold and the three children collectively caught a cold after playing. The waiters are very nice, but they really have no sense of service. They don't take the initiative to ask anything or tell them anything. The restaurant is large and the breakfast has a variety of varieties, but it is not easy to make everything delicious. There is a fruit plate in the room. The fruits are stale and tasteless. So who is running this hotel? !

The result was that they didn’t. After calling for a long time, they told me that it was canceled in May and changed to afternoon tea. I thought afternoon tea would be fine too. When traveling as a couple, two people booked a double room, but the afternoon tea only consisted of one cup of coffee. Didn’t this force me to order another cup? A cup costs twenty or thirty, which is much more expensive than outside. The front desk service was not very good. When I asked where breakfast was in the morning, the front desk said it was opposite the swimming pool. There are buildings all around the swimming pool. We walked around twice but couldn't find it. I asked the cleaning aunt on the way, and the cleaning aunt also said she didn’t know? ! The room rate for one night was 1,300, and the coffee machine was still broken. It was a really lonely stay.

At the same time, there are concerns about room reservations that the room will be sold at a huge discount on the day of check-in. If you want to book a super-large pool room or pool terrace room, it is recommended to be cautious, because the hotel will release the room on the same day when the sales volume of the reservation is not good. Limited special offer "Blind Box Pool Room", this room is not named for fun, but to avoid discounting the name of the original room type and make people who have already booked uncomfortable, so if you want to book these two room types, it is recommended to wait until the last day, or Change the room type, otherwise you will face the embarrassment of booking a high price long in advance, and the room will be discounted that day. Feedback from the hotel that this sales strategy is not friendly to guests who book in advance, the hotel disagrees and tells me "this is a limited strategy". I still want to thank Ctrip for facing this kind of problem squarely and admitting that the hotel is discounting in disguise.

msg:I was stunned by how great this B&B was. The soaking pool in the room was very unique, the blue color on the bedside felt very peaceful, and it also came with a capsule coffee machine. The tea in the hotel was very fragrant. The candies are also very delicious. In short, I am very happy staying in this B&B. I haven’t been to Turpan for several years and this trip was really worthwhile. If I don’t have anything to do back home, I would definitely stay a few more days and have a good rest. It was very comfortable to stay in this B&B. The weather happened to be very good. It was a beautiful walk under the grape corridor. When I come to Turpan next time, I will choose Mnagar.

msg:The design, decoration, soft furnishings, supplies, services, catering facilities, etc. are all great! A well-deserved high-end B&B. Mnarg is the most high-end hotel in Suzhu. The other hotels also have their own characteristics and the prices are relatively lower. The room is large, and it doesn't matter if you bring suitcases. Separate wet and dry bathrooms. Dyson's hair dryer is the best in hair volume and can dry your hair quickly. There is a large bathing pool in the room, but unfortunately the water gate was closed and the bathing was not completed. At night, the hotel gave you various fruit yogurts, which were ice cold and cool. The breakfast is very rich. The local clear noodle soup is slightly sour and spicy and very appetizing. The chicken soup is delicious. I add fruit pieces and raisins to the yogurt. It is delicious and fun. At first, the kids chose it because they saw it in Running Man, and there was an outdoor swimming pool. It was very cool to soak in the swimming pool on a hot night! Staying with parents and children received the highest score for accommodation during this trip! If I have the chance to go back to Turpan, I would like to stay here again!

We booked an ordinary room, but when we checked in, the beautiful lady at the front desk also Thank you very much for upgrading us to the same room as Running Man for free. The room is clean and tidy, with complete facilities and double sinks. It's great to wake up early and wash up with your loved one. The toilet and shower room are also separated so that they will not disturb each other. The best thing is the large bathing pool, which is very comfortable to soak in. The hotel's environment is also very good, with swimming pools, shops, and restaurants to meet the needs of hotel guests. Moreover, the service attitude of the hotel staff is very good. We originally booked two days of accommodation, but due to personal reasons we could only stay for one day. The hotel also readily refunded us one day's room rate without charging any additional fees. Thank you thank you. I will definitely stay there again if I have the chance in the future.

msg:Although it is an internet celebrity hotel, it is very ordinary. The hotel is located in a hotel industrial park and has average privacy. The supporting facilities around the hotel are average, the restaurant is also shared by the industrial park, the food is average, the so-called soaking pool in the room is just a cement bathtub, the room hygiene is not in place, the water table has water stains, the trash can is not cleaned, and the service is even worse To the extreme, I arrived at the front desk of the hotel at the scheduled time, but the front desk informed me that the room had not been cleaned yet and that I needed to wait. After waiting for a long time and entering the room, I found that the room type I booked was inconsistent with the room type I actually stayed in. I decisively went to the front desk to verify, and the front desk said sophistry. Pictures can't represent anything. I asked the front desk if the room size reached the 75 square meters booked. As a result, the front desk couldn't answer. Finally, after Ctrip's communication, I changed the room, but it still didn't change to the room that was consistent with the booked room type. That's it. The Internet celebrity hotel with such a high price actually made false propaganda and relied entirely on deception. It was a very unsatisfactory stay experience! ! The only consolation is that Ctrip has provided a certain amount of compensation. It’s not much money, but it’s heart-warming! I hope this hotel that relies on fraud can take care of itself. The foundation of doing business lies in trust. If there is no foundation, how long can it be popular!

msg:The hotel can meet the 5-point rating given by Ctrip in all aspects, but it still needs improvement in many aspects.
Disadvantages 1. The front desk staff needs training. When we checked in, we were given a room that had not been cleaned. Later, although the key card for the new room was sent to us in time, it did not help us change to the new room in the system, causing us to He did not log out of the public security system after checking out, which affected our check-in at the next hotel. However, after we contacted him by phone, he actively helped us solve the problem. 2. The water in the swimming pool was green, and the bottom of the pool was slippery. I wonder how often you clean the swimming pool? 3. The room has a bit of a smell, maybe because it was newly opened this year. If there is more ventilation, the smell will disappear soon! 4. It would be better to have a clothes drying rack on the balcony, because the laundry room is not equipped with a dryer.
Advantages 1. The facilities are very good and the room is well decorated, especially the pool, which the children like very much. 2. The front desk staff has a very good attitude and is very warm. 3. The snacks provided when you check in are delicious.

msg:酒店離市區有一點距離，在一個民宿合集區裏，周圍還有幾家已經開的酒店和民宿，還有在裝修的，整體挺熱鬧，酒店中間各種錯層階梯和露台都很出片。
房型面積算比較大的，房間設施很新也齊全，房間裏還有個大泡池，可惜試了兩次沒出水就放棄了。還準備了當地一些小零食，就是因為周邊還在建設，陽台出去景色差了些，坐一坐還是很舒服的。
周邊沒有什麼用餐的地方，如果不開車外出可以選擇前面酒店用餐，買個團購可以體驗當地小吃，很實惠。
早餐也在酒店自助餐，選擇很豐富。
整體體驗感很棒，服務意識也很不錯，主動幫忙取送行李，老闆娘還特別好看！！

msg:1.新酒店，房間寬敞，設施用品都還不錯——礦泉水用的是依雲，吹風機是戴森，小包葡萄乾品質也可以
2.服務棒👍🏿管家是年輕的姑娘，熱情不做作。吐魯番太熱了，一開始住的標間空調溫度打不下來。管家小姐姐得知情況後第一時間更換升級了套間，並且幫忙運送行李——處理專業、及時，把發生的問題最終轉換成了客人的好感
3.新疆由於天黑非常晚，所以一般當地人吃早餐也會比較晚。我們初進疆時間沒有調整過來，和管家溝通早晨7點用餐。姑娘沒有表示任何問題，非常按時將食物送到我們的房間，很感動
4.介於酒店現有的設計會更推薦夫妻/情侶入住。也想請酒店考慮在淋浴房內添加毛巾架——如此，朋友同住也不會有尷尬
