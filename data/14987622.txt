msg:Great place to stay! Reception and service counter are extremely helpful and deserving of all the good recognition. Special mention to 小刘 and her crew for being so attentive to us. 

Breakfast spread was amazing with good variety of tasty local dishes. Everyone was attentive and check in on us every now and then. Superb service we ever experienced in Wuyishan. 

Love their in-house tea eggs and had an unique experience with their specialised tea bath. 

Thank you for the memorable stay!
We will be back again for sure 🥳

Enjoyed the delicious daily breakfast.  You can enjoy good tea for free, and also order home cooked meals for lunch or dinner at a very reasonable price if you wish to. 
There isn’t much nearby but it’s very safe and peaceful in a resort area and a cab is always easy and cheap to grab to other places. 
I would recommend this place for sure and hope to be back again!

msg:First of all, this evaluation is based on the standard requirements of 1100+.
Advantages: The hotel periphery, stairs, and lobby are relatively clean.
Hygiene: There is no ventilation in the toilet and bathroom and the smell is strong. The soaking pool outside was useless, but it was visibly unclean.
Equipment: TV is not available, Internet is not available, telephone (old-fashioned), hair dryer (products within 100 yuan)
Service: Good service awareness, poor professionalism, and the method needs to be improved.
Other value-added services: Good Night Milk is two small packets. The so-called minibar consists of two bottles of water, a can of Coke and Sprite. Two cookies. Two bags of tea.
To sum up, this standard is that of an ordinary hotel within 500 yuan, and it cannot be higher. The overall experience is relatively poor. Bad review!

msg:A very good experience.
The hotel is located in the resort area, and it is very close whether you are going to the scenic spot or watching the Impression Dahongpao show at night. Taking advantage of the two days on the weekend, I didn't waste too much time on the journey and could devote myself to sightseeing and tea tasting.
The environment of the hotel is also worth mentioning. Although it is in a villa area, you can only find a different world after entering the hotel. It is surrounded by mountains and rivers, and it feels like you have strayed into a peach blossom garden.
After visiting the scenic spot, I was exhausted. I regretted not going out for more walks, but fortunately, the lady at the hotel took the initiative to invite us to taste tea, and we heard a lot about the tea culture of Wuyi Rock Tea.
Time is tight this time, and there are still many mountains and rivers that I haven’t seen enough. I will stay here again next time I come.

The driver was very professional, wearing a suit and carrying the hotel's sign to greet us. The driver drove smoothly and didn't have any unnecessary gossip. He heard that we wanted dinner and proactively recommended it. Instantly, his favorable impression of the hotel soared.
After entering the hotel, the decoration is beautiful, the room is spacious and the facilities are convenient.
What's also surprising is their breakfast style. After staying in hotels for a long time, I am used to hotel breakfasts, but this one gave me a surprise. According to the custom of Wuyi Mountain, a chef will decide the meal mix for the day every morning. The bowl we had is Wuyi Mountain's specialty noodles, and it is paired with a series of set meals. We give the chef a thumbs up.
Overall, the hotel service is professional and warm, and it is worth recommending. I also received a souvenir, which must be praised.

It also had a double bed and a separate living room. The space was very independent, private and quiet, with the large floor-to-ceiling windows. Watching the sunset is beautiful.
The location is in a villa with a quiet environment, water and views. The transportation is very convenient, and Didi has access to the downstairs. The airport pick-up service was excellent and the souvenirs were also exquisite. There is a delicious restaurant very close by. When not going to scenic spots, it is quite pleasant to taste various local teas at the tea table.
Breakfast is a set meal style, which is quite novel for a northerner and tastes good. The tea eggs are bright in color and delicious in taste. One morning I rushed to the bamboo raft and didn't have time for breakfast. The butler was very considerate and packed tea eggs and milk. The service was quite good! ! !

msg:The service at the B&B was very good. Originally we only arranged a one-way pick-up, but since I was traveling with an elderly person, we negotiated several times and finally arranged a drop-off.
After thinking about it for a long time, I still want to mention: I booked a twin room this time. I thought it was okay based on the introduction, but the actual room was too small, and the National Day price increase was too much. The basic price of the B&B itself is not low, and the National Day price increase is too much. Double that, the last night was close to 1,800 yuan. At this price, it is really not worth living in such a small room in Wuyishan.
My final piece of advice is to hope that B&B operators will consider continuing operations, adhere to long-termism, and not set such high prices during holidays to scare away consumers.
Especially for people like me, I was recommended by a friend. I originally had a dream, but when I saw how small the room was, and when I thought about the high room fee, I was really disappointed. It’s really better to stay in a star hotel. I probably won’t go there again in the future, this time I just made a blind purchase.

msg:Location transportation:
Liu Shang is in Wuyi Water Village. This villa area is full of various B&Bs. Not very close to the scenic spot. There are no other stores nearby. Of course, there are some private dining restaurants in B&Bs.
Room view and room facilities and room hygiene:
It looks like a shabby old villa from the outside, but the decoration inside is still a villa. There are three rooms on the third floor, one with tatami and a soaking pool, one in the middle of the building, and one with a large balcony. But when I checked in, the smell of smoke in one of the rooms was so strong that I almost fainted. (Later, the waiter took care of it and removed the smell after a few hours.) The room was relatively complete, but as soon as I opened the balcony door, I saw the residents opposite. It didn't feel like I was staying in a hotel, but like I was staying in someone's home.

breakfast:
The breakfast is one for each person. It seems to be rich in content. It is different every day, but there is very little that can be eaten. It doesn’t quite suit our taste, but it’s just like other B&Bs. Can we have an omelette or something? In addition, the coffee machine always shuts down, and the coffee produced is either very bitter or very watery.

Gym and entertainment facilities: 1. When I read Ctrip’s detailed introduction, I decided to stay in a B&B instead of Shimao because it had mahjong machines and treadmills. As a result, there was only one mahjong machine. When I wanted to play for the first time, someone else was playing. When I wanted to play for the second time, I found that the mahjong was incomplete. In the end, I had to play manual mahjong. I'm afraid that someone else will occupy the room. I also shortened my meal time and rushed back. 2. Let’s talk about the treadmill. I saw pictures on Ctrip and it said there is a gym. As a result, the store clerk said that there was no gym. I can go outside and run. Whether there is a gym or not and whether I want to run outside are two different things.

Value for money:
If the price per night is only a few hundred yuan, in the off-season in Wuyishan, I should give Liushang at least 4.5 points, after all, the price/performance ratio is there. But for a room rate of 1300-1500 per night, we can definitely stay in Shimao, because we always stay in Shimao every time we come here. This time we wanted to change the environment, so we searched for a B&B with high ratings. But with such an environment, facilities and other features, it is difficult to match such a price. This is not about keeping up with the service, this is not about giving away a few free teas (tea is a complimentary item in our room rate), this is not something that can be balanced by apologizing and saying that business is difficult. After all, we feel that for the price of one night, this is definitely not what we should enjoy ~

As long as the air conditioner in the room is turned down and the temperature is adjusted to above 24 degrees, the musty smell will be really strong. If the wind is turned up and the temperature is adjusted below 24 degrees, the odor will be reduced, but the headboard of the bed facing outside will be particularly uncomfortable when you sleep at night. The direction of the wind cannot be adjusted either.
I started writing this review at 2 a.m. tonight after I checked in. I have been suffering from insomnia due to the air conditioner, and I have been coughing. My head hurts from the cold wind, but when the air conditioner is turned off, the whole room becomes stuffy and uncomfortable.
It’s probably time for the air conditioner to be cleaned by professionals.

I woke up in the morning and kept coughing. My entire respiratory tract was extremely uncomfortable. My mother told me that she also felt very uncomfortable.

2⃣️ Geographical location problem
The hotel is a certain distance from the main road. It takes about fifteen minutes to take a taxi to go shopping and eat, which is a bit inconvenient. There is no place to walk around, so I can only stay in the hotel and sleep in a daze.

3⃣️Afternoon tea question
Booking a hotel shows free pick-up service➕one afternoon tea➕one tea tasting. As a result, I learned after checking in that the so-called afternoon tea is nothing more than making you a cup of tea in the lobby or tea room. It is also called afternoon tea. Then why do you show a complimentary afternoon tea on my booking page? ? ? ? Is it deceiving guests? I also hope that B&Bs can learn what afternoon tea is, what is the definition of afternoon tea, and sweet and salty snacks with tea. This is the most basic configuration of afternoon tea. Rather than letting guests drink a cup of free boiled water to make tea in the lobby or restaurant tea room, it can be called afternoon tea. Isn't this exaggerated propaganda? Wouldn't it be better to just not show the gift when booking? Because for guests, if there are no expectations, there will be no disappoin**ent. We are not cheap people, but customers will not pay for things that are not available but are forcibly added. Before staying at your hotel, I also stayed in Yuehua for two nights. Although there are differences between hotels and B&Bs, I have experienced a lot of B&Bs in China. Yuehua is more than 200 yuan cheaper than you. Although afternoon tea is Simple, but at least worthy of the title. Yours, I don’t even have the chance to experience it. How can I not drink free tea?

3⃣️Cost-performance issue
I have been to Wuyi Mountain twice. The last time I came to Wuyi Mountain, I stayed in several homestays, such as Jiaye Shanshe and Xiaowen's Yishan Lanruo. Although the price/performance ratio is average, the overall experience is not bad. After all, there are tea gardens around the house. , there are rivers and beautiful views. It’s reasonable to charge 1,000+ for such a location.
But I don’t understand why Liushang can be so confident in charging during working days and non-holidays.
First of all, the geographical environment of the B&B has no advantages, and the overall design style of the hotel is also very ordinary. It is a B&B built by connecting two rooms in the villa area. There is nothing around, only countless homogeneous B&Bs and villas, which are quite different from the first two.

The room cost more than 1,000 yuan a night, but it didn't even have a night light. When I woke up at night, I was groping in the dark and was hit twice on the waist by the corner of the table. The room didn't even have a hook for hanging towels, and there was no place to put the towels. The mattress sank extremely badly and provided no support for my waist. It was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on. I woke up the next day with a cough and back pain. I didn’t get any rest and was super tired. It felt like I’d been beaten. Feeling, hey.

The musty and damp smell in the room was very strong, and the quilt was very wet, which was very uncomfortable. Anyway, when I got up early in the morning, I opened the door to let out the smell, but as soon as I entered the room after breakfast, there was still a strong smell.

According to my experience in thousands of hotels and B&Bs at home and abroad for more than ten years, in a place like Wuyishan, the price of Liushang is only worth about 400 at most. It is understandable that it may rise to 7/800 on holidays, but on working days that are not holidays like this Even asking for 1,000+ is really a big deal. I am so confident that I really dare to ask for a price! !


4⃣️The public rest area of ​​the B&B itself is very small, with only one lobby. It might be better if it can be avoided as much as possible when guests do not need it, so that guests can rest more comfortably in the public area.
This is just a small suggestion from me. Japanese B&Bs will not appear in the guests’ line of sight when there is no need for them, nor will they share the same space with the guests. Try to return the space of the B&B to the guests so that they can freely enjoy everything here.

5⃣️Breakfast problem
It was too shabby. I only had a bowl of beef noodles and I was not full. The noodles had no taste at all! ! ! ! It’s really not delicious. My mother doesn’t eat beef, but she only has beef noodles. This is the worst and mediocre breakfast I’ve ever had in any B&B in the same price range.
Breakfast actually starts at 7:30? ? ? I believe that guests who come to Wuyi Mountain come to enjoy the mountains and rivers. In summer, it is hot and sunny, so most people choose to go out early in the morning. You start breakfast at 7:30? The sun is almost scorching my butt. Normally, hotels and B&Bs start at 6:30.

If that's the case, then we might as well not include breakfast. We might as well go out and eat at a random breakfast stall.


The only thing I remember is that the steamed red-eye fish for lunch was delicious.

Based on this, there is really nothing else that I can remember. I'm really sorry. It’s not that customers like me lack a pair of eyes to discover beauty and only know how to complain, but isn’t this the customer’s fault? Are guests coming to stay at the hotel? Do you have to pay for your shortcomings, shortcomings and various problems? It's just that the standards of some customers are so unsatisfactory. The only thing I can do is to reflect my feelings and write down my thoughts truly and objectively.

I only hope that the B&B can truly absorb the guests' suggestions and make adjus**ents so that subsequent guests can have a better experience. Thanks.

單程接站/接機服務:一進大廳就迎來陣陣茶香，詢問接待的小姐姐才知道是用茶葉老葉烘焙做香薰。
環境特別優美，走進美宿就感受到了寧靜的氛圍，很適合修身養性。
房間很大，設備齊全也很好，房間內配有新鮮的歡迎水果，很温馨。
老闆娘邀請我喝茶。茶桌上有老闆娘精心的插花。茶點。還有熱心的泡茶小姐姐給我規劃行程安排、講解武夷山的風土人情和茶葉知識。
也許你在某個地方隨手一拍，就有一張大片出世哦😜，聽説已拍出兩個大片，你期待嗎？期待可以來打卡哦
最讓我這種有選擇困難症的人選擇的是美宿的早餐，豐盛、誘人，不知如何選擇，早餐很好吃😋，下次來每一樣都體驗一下。
如果不想出門，可以在美宿的茶室喝喝茶，拍拍照，餓了在美宿的餐廳點上一份武夷山的特色套餐。美美的吃上一頓。享受着温馨的愜意。很放鬆的生活🌹

msg:關於什麼樣是好的民宿？
從國內到國外，民宿住了幾十家，中高端的也不少，而讓我認為是「好的」民宿，不過兩三家。我的評判標準兩點：
①入住遇到民宿設計師或者老闆親自主理，聊聊設計理念設計細節，互相交流可學習，帶有當地風土人情體驗
②衞生絕對細緻不是差不多，服務專業別高冷。很多民宿也是短頻快，把住客商品化，迎來送往而已，睡個覺拍個照而已。如此把自己衹做星級酒店好了，不配叫做高端民宿。
＃武夷山六尚民宿，是好的民宿

這家民宿在一個別墅區裏，適合自駕，進小區不遠就到了，門口有停車位，小院處於小區的邊上，不受鄰居打擾，曲徑通幽的感覺，特別能體會到武夷山宜人的魅力。
房間佈局很合理，簡約大氣的設計，空間大小合適，住個幾天不會膩。户外和室內都有茶室，玩兒累了回來砌個茶很是愜意。
店裡每天都有甜湯，廚房師傅的手藝不錯，懶得去外面吃飯就在店裡點兩三個菜，乾淨不油膩，很不錯。
店裡每天都會給客人準備兩個水果，很新鮮，一看就是細心選購的，不馬虎。
店裡服務非常貼心，基本上有求必應，經理和前台都是漂亮禮貌的小姐姐，説話温柔可愛，住的很開心！

msg:超愛，超級無敵愛，主要還是喜歡六尚的風格，安靜，服務衞生就不用多説，早餐每天早上不重複，豐盛美味又營養，走的時候管家還送了伴手禮，六尚算是武夷山比較高端大氣上檔次的名宿，很推薦入住。

🧹衞生：整個環境乾淨整潔，房間裏一層不染，連犄角旮旯一點灰塵都沒有，像我這種有點潔癖的很認可👍

🍃環境：曲徑通幽的小道，兩旁綠樹成蔭，丹桂盛開的季節特別的沁人心脾，走進大堂別有一番天地，中式和日式風格相結合設計感極強👍


🔔服務：前台的小姐姐和老闆娘熱情周到，會幫忙規劃遊玩路線訂票，整理完行李下樓走走，前台小姐姐招呼品茗武夷山的巖茶，大紅袍巖茶好喝，還了解了當地的一些特色文化，聊的非常開心🥳

朋友住過的極力推薦的這家民宿，果不其然住後感不錯，房間外還帶一個獨立庭院，值得～

msg:趁着休息來到武夷山這邊玩，看到酒店離得近就點了（主要是房間佈局有被吸引到！）

🍃環境：剛走進就聞到桂花的香氣，不同於玫瑰的濃烈也有異於茉莉的清幽，腦海中不禁浮現李清照的“暗淡輕黃體態柔，情疏跡遠衹香留。何須淺碧深紅色，自是花中第一流”～聞到桂花的香氣整個人都疲憊好像都一掃而空。
再往裡進有溪水，周邊花草密佈，有一種“曲徑通幽處，禪房花木深”的感覺。整個人如同深處世外桃源一樣，繁華城市生活節奏令人疲憊，我覺得這裏就好像時間短暫的停止住，放放鬆自己的心靈和身體。

🚗 交通：附近打車出行還是挺方便的，滴滴都可以開到樓下，不會有其他民宿那種還要走路去固定打車點多不便。

🧹衞生：衞生值得一誇，能看出來民宿是有在用心監檢查衞生了，房間大廳都很乾凈，讓人住着也感覺到安心。

🔔服務：服務打call！前台小姐姐很有禮貌也很有耐心，特別是主管阿姨！人超好，跟你泡茶還會跟你聊天，無論是新聞時事還是娛樂訊息都可以聊的來（阿姨真的是很緊跟潮流～）全程就像朋友一樣，不會有那種拘束感，像在家一樣的感覺（有一説一，茶挺好喝！）
早餐的話我覺得還可以，但是種類還有待進步的空間～
不過我覺得這個價位總體來説還是物有所值的，下次有機會還會來這裏住～

免費升級了全景套房，有那麼一丟丟小驚喜。房間乾淨寬暢，風景絕佳。晚上還泡了一個特色茶浴，舒坦。
民宿從店長、服務小姐姐到司機和打掃阿姨態度好好，給人一種賓至如歸的感覺。

入住前：管家很熱心解答各種問題 幫定了印象大紅袍票；酒店可以接站或者送站1次 對剛到的朋友很方便；
餐食：正餐按照人頭算 需要提前預訂；早餐是定食制的 每人一份 有咖啡機 和泡好的紅茶
出行：基本去景區入口 或者舊街吃東西 都是6-10公里 滴滴平均10-15元
房間：非常乾淨 一般出去住酒店特別注意角角落落 每個地方都打掃得很乾凈；整體維護得相當不錯；房間裏有茶具可以自己泡茶
服務：每次出門或回來 前台管家姐姐們 都會站起來打招呼 有一天下午 還請姐姐給我們在茶室泡了茶 學了一下 回房間 自己也模仿泡茶喝了

總結：之前也搜了不知春齋類的網紅 實地去看了覺得還好沒定 環境吵雜 外面很市井 感覺沒法真的放空； 想好好休息的 六尚真的很推薦
