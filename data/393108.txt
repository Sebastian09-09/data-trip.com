msg:Overall, typical Kempinski experience, though not the best one. Staff servicea up to standard. Location wise, not the best as not in the main shopping belt area and nearby food or attractions not as extensive. Requires metro services with change of lines to get to main districts of attractions. Another area of improvement is the breakfast. Breakfast selection is standard, but no enforcement of dining policy. We saw many people coming in with hotel slippers which should not have been allowed.

msg:It's rated #5 of top hotels in chengdu by Trip.com but I think is not really worth this title, because the following:

1) old amenities, hotel facilities like gym, pool are old, a 5 stars hotel but without a sauna & steam room is very disappointing

2) I expect a bigger room but in fact quite small for 5 stars standard

3) the room furniture and free stuffs in the room look cheap

The rest are quite ok for a 5 stars standard.

Very cosy SPA area, beautiful massage (I was given a voucher). Breakfast buffet Western and Chinese style both really good and also the coffee (if you take the Espresso from the machine).  Room is spacious, tastefully decorated and cosy (I had a king size bedroom) and clean with a lotf attentiin.to detail, (Only the coffee table needed a bit of
 cleaning upon arrival). Everything else was perfect. I also like the fact that people are asked to turn up in decent clothes for breakfast.

However the occupiers in the two rooms right opposite to us were really heavy smokers who puffed frequently inside their rooms and the worst thing was they wide opened the doors while smoking, thus making the whole corridor full of bad smell of smoke. I've made a complaint to the hotel but no improvement was noted. A no good experience to us!

The woman at the front desk looked disinterested and unfriendly and even when we said hello , didn‚Äôt greet us. Also , nobody helped us with luggage as we left our DiDi. We expected more from the Kempinski. Our room was modern , very clean and fresh. Breakfast buffet was fine , has a good selection of foods , but again , the service there isn‚Äôt good. The staff are rushed and don‚Äôt know how to greet guests. Unfortunately we won‚Äôt be coming back to the Kempinski, it is a hotel that needs refurbishment, the lobby is old and dark. Overall our stay was disappointing for the price that we paid.

For example the room booked was not free and they provided me with an upgrade to manage the situation without any hesitation. The hotel offers some interesting services but some of these animators such as the bar require some refurbishing to make them really attractive given the competition in the neighborhood.

I think Kempinski's suite series is really the king of cost-effectiveness. The room is 70-80 square meters, which is super suitable for the whole family. The hotel's breakfast is also very good. Rice noodles are better than noodles! There are many kinds of toppings! Praise the chef of omelette for making delicious food! The gym is basically empty, and the equipment is sufficient. The water in the swimming pool is also very clean.

This time when I stayed in Chengdu, I enjoyed the upgraded service according to the rights and interests when I placed the order. I originally only had one DR Craft Dining Bar 0.3L fresh beer coupon, but I was given an extra one, which was very considerate. The location of the hotel is also very good, close to the residential area, with a strong a**osphere of life around it, and not far from Yulin Road to the "tavern".

msg:During my recent trip to Chengdu, I chose the Kempinski Hotel as my place to stay, and it was indeed a great experience. The hotel is located in the city center, with convenient transportation and elegant surroundings, which is very suitable for tourism and business trips.

From the moment I entered the lobby, the luxury of the Kempinski Hotel was impressive. The lobby is spacious and bright, with elegant decorations. The waiter quickly came forward to help with the check-in procedures and was very professional and friendly. The decoration style inside the room is equally exquisite, combining modern and traditional elements to create a warm and comfortable a**osphere. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom facilities are modern. Every little detail reflects the hotel's care for guests.

The hotel's catering service is also excellent. Whether it is the breakfast buffet or dinner, the food provided is rich in variety and high in quality. Especially the fusion of authentic Sichuan cuisine and international cuisine, every dish is memorable.

In addition, the hotel's gym and swimming pool are well-equipped, allowing me to find time to relax during my busy schedule. The service attitude of the staff is very good, and every problem can be solved quickly.

In short, every aspect of the Kempinski Hotel Chengdu is satisfactory. Whether it is hardware facilities or service quality, especially Carrie's enthusiastic service, it reflects the standard of a five-star hotel. I highly recommend this hotel, whether it is a business trip or a leisure trip, it will be an ideal choice.

It is troublesome for families with multiple children to travel. It is not convenient to take care of children when booking two rooms. It is not necessarily possible to book an extra bed in a suite. Sincerely. This room type: 1 large bed with separate bathroom + dressing table, 1 living room + dining table (can do homework), 1 double room with separate bathroom, very practical and applicable! ! Highly recommended for families with 2 or more children to book!
Service: üçëTo be honest, the services of many other five-star hotels are very casual and the experience is poor, but the guests will not be persistent, and they are so casual that it doesn't matter. üçëThis hotel is very special. I feel that the service staff are very professional, especially the chef at the door who helps open the door and pick up the luggage. He is very proactive and the service is very professional! üçëThere is a beautiful girl in a red woolen coat at the front desk who always smiles at the guests. Her smile is very sincere. We stayed here for 4 days and we can see her charming smile every time! üçëIt‚Äôs really rare. The hotel replenishes shampoo and shower gel, which is given again and again! The ladies in the executive lounge also wear very dignified clothes!

Daily fresh fruit: even though I don‚Äôt have time to eat it
Minibar soft drinks: Free, although not much
Afternoon tea in the Executive Lounge: Although I only went there once, it was still good, and the small desserts are not inferior to those of Internet celebrity shops.
Happy Hour: Simple meals are enough for the kids to make do when they don‚Äôt want to eat hot pot

The room must be booked through the GHA platform to enjoy upgrades and other benefits. When Eileen from the red team at Kempinski Hotel learned about my situation, in order to provide better services to customers, she not only upgraded the room type, but also gave me two breakfasts. The unpleasant experience I experienced at another five-star hotel in Chengdu disappeared instantly. Later, I learned that it was my birthday when I was staying in the hotel, so they arranged for the hotel to send me a birthday cake. This is the first time I have eaten panda cake, and it is also the first time I have received a birthday card from a hotel. The meaning is so different. I'm really happy.

The room is very clean, I like the light luxury and simple style. The hotel is very close to SKP, Yintai and other shopping malls, and not far from attractions. It is very convenient to take a taxi. The staff who cleaned the room on the 15th cleaned it in a timely manner and it was very clean. If the sheets were stained, they changed them in time. Thank you very muchüôèüèª.

msg:I stayed here from Tianfu Airport Yunxiang and Pagoda Junting. I thought it was an old high-end hotel. I booked for three days and was really a little disappointed.

Facilities: The bathroom has no door. There was a lot of water splashing on the ground outside after taking a shower. The bathtub faced the bathroom without a door. There was no view at all. The overall room was relatively small. I don‚Äôt know if other room types will be better.

Service: The service is still very good. I brought a lot of things back from abroad and needed to send them. I made an appoin**ent for SF Express to come to my door and packed the things and put them in the concierge. I was very active in helping with the luggage when I checked in, and I would help guide the door when I took a taxi. The room was a bit dry. I told the front desk and the humidifier was delivered to the room quickly.

  Very satisfied with the check-in experience. First of all, thank you to the guy at the front desk. We are traveling as a family of three and booked a deluxe twin room. The little brother saw the three of us and suggested that we stay in a 2.4-meter super king room. After obtaining our consent, the little brother directly upgraded us to a super deluxe king room for free.
   I told my little brother that we were flying to Xiamen at 8:30 the next night. He said that he could help us extend the check-out time from 12 noon to 5 o'clock in the evening for free. Thanks again to my little brother for his super ability. This is the happiest stay experience since the beginning of 2024. We save ourselves the trouble of having no place to take a lunch break in the afternoon.
  The hotel rooms have been renovated. Many places are clean and tidy, and the facilities are more complete. The decoration of the hotel is very modern. Breakfast is also super rich. There are three of us, and the children‚Äôs breakfast is charged separately, 108 yuan/person. There is a combination of Chinese and Western breakfast, and I prefer the Western one.
     The hotel is very close to Wuhou Temple, and it is also convenient to take a taxi. It is also very close from the hotel to the headquarters of Sichuan University. We first went to Wuhou Temple in the morning and arrived at Sichuan University at noon. In the afternoon, the teachers from Sichuan University took us back to the hotel. The whole journey was smooth.
    The journey is like this, full of surprises along the way. Because a person falls in love with a city.

When a sports meeting is held, a bunch of illegitimate meals are blocked at the door. The experience is very poor. The privacy of guests and celebrities is not guaranteed.

The front desk only responded with one sentence: Temporary acceptance. to notification. In addition, in winter, the temperature in Chengdu is below 10 degrees at night. The central air conditioner in the hotel has no heater. Two heaters were provided. The noise was extremely loud and I couldn't sleep well at night. It feels cold in the morning after turning it off, especially when I take a shower in the morning. Except for the above situations, other service hygiene and environment are acceptable.

I have to say that Kaibin has regressed significantly. No matter from the variety of breakfast or even the paid charging sockets in the room, it can only make people feel a little family-like.

I didn't notice it when I stayed in Chengdu Kaibin before. This time it may be because the floor is low. It feels like the resonance with the subway is a bit obvious, and the sound insulation is not good. The sound of staff starting cleaning at around eight o'clock was obvious.

The hotel staff are professional and aware. The porter came to help with luggage as soon as we got off the bus. Check-in was also smooth, and the lady at the front desk was very gentle. Because the room is newly renovated, it is very clean, beautiful and elegant. The toiletries are all from Figgram, and there is Evian water in the minibar. I was pleasantly surprised when I came back from walking around in the evening and found that they helped turn down the bed.

Thank you Kempinski for giving me and my friends a perfect experience in Chengdu. We will choose to stay here next time we come to Chengdu!

There were marks on the sink cabinet that had not been wiped clean... It was too late and I was too lazy to change rooms... This was nothing.

Environment: The room has been renovated and overall it's pretty good. It‚Äôs just that the traffic nearby is a bit annoying (Ôø£„ÉºÔø£)! That ramp is really difficult to get off... I recommend taking a taxi...

Facilities: The partition between wet and dry toilets...is basically open (Ôø£‚àáÔø£)! Not recommended for business trips... Otherwise, you will really die on the spot... If you sit on the toilet with your butt naked... people outside can see your butt through the Changhong glass...

Service: Give one star to the concierge at the door for service! The real service is very good, the awareness and details are excellent!
The good impression I had on the hotel was completely ruined half an hour before check-out! !

When checking out, if conditions permit, you can delay check-out for an hour and wait for takeout. I called the hotel to communicate üôÇ The reply I got was that they could extend it to two o‚Äôclock for me, but I needed to change it with a screenshot of the positive review written on the platform when I left the hotel. Otherwise, half a day will be charged! ! !
I didn‚Äôt ask a single word about my check-in experience. I just asked for a positive review in exchange for a refund. Haha, this is something a brand like Kempinski can do! ?
I refuse this request in exchange for a positive review and say I cannot accept it!
What's wrong? Platform bookings are based on good reviews in exchange for services, but what about guests who booked and checked in through other channels that cannot be rated?
What about guests who come directly to the store without making a reservation? ? ?
üôÇ Are you classifying and discriminating against customers? ? ? ? And I really resist asking for good reviews!

From the airport, the expressway leads directly to the hotel, and it takes about 20 minutes to get to Shuangliu Airport. The hotel is very close to Yulin and Sichuan University, so you can have a lot of fun shopping and eating.
As a renovated old hotel, the overall room is relatively new and has a sense of design. What's more worth mentioning is that the hotel staff are very enthusiastic, especially the ones who greet guests at the door and help open the door and put the luggage in the trunk when leaving the hotel.
There are two shortcomings: First, the hotel is close to a traffic artery, and even on high floors it is noisy, which affects your sleep at night. Secondly, the bathroom area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is basically connected to the bedroom. There is a peculiar smell when entering the room, so the window needs to be opened for ventilation.

I rely on shared bicycles when I go out. If I just walk, I still have to walk out for a while. It is not far from Tongzilin Subway Station.
The hotel is indeed relatively old, and the facade still has traces of history. Fortunately, the interior has been renovated.
When checking in, I was told that a room had been reserved. It was on the 16th floor. It was a non-smoking room and there was an air purifier in the room. The room faces east, on the corner. This is a bit regretful, because I was informed that I wanted a non-smoking room when I made the reservation a long time ago, but it turned out that there was still a smoking room. I asked the guy at the front desk about the direction of the room, and he told me that all the selected suites only have south-facing ones, and there are no other directions. , I felt like they were fooling me because I got the east-facing room.
The room was generally comfortable, and a small snack was provided for my first stay. There are several areas where room facilities can be improved. First, you can add a dressing table with twenty magnifying mirrors embedded in a normal mirror. There is also a large washbasin in front of the mirror, and even the girls cannot reach the magnifying mirror. Third, there is no place to dry clothes in the room. The toiletries in the suite were from Ferragamo. There was no door in the shower room. It wasn't because I was afraid of being looked at. The main reason was that water splashed everywhere. The main problem was that the shower was cold. The drinks in the small refrigerator in the room are free, and they are replenished every day. If you don't drink, you won't be replenished. I did a low-quality thing. In order to replenish the drinks every day, I have to hide the drinks even if I don't drink. The standards for coffee, tea and water bag replenishment vary from day to day, and there are cases where the amount is not replenished, and there are also cases where the replenishment is excessive. The room has a turndown service every night. On the first day, it is a bottle of water + two cookies, and on the subsequent day it is water + hawthorn rolls. If you replace the water with milk it would be perfect.
The lounge is for 2 adults. I asked the hotel in advance and was told that there is unlimited entry and exit. In fact, only two people can enter and exit at one time during afternoon tea and happy hour, and there is no unlimited entry and exit. I took pictures of the afternoon tea, which was basically cake, fruit and drinks. I didn't go to happy hour, so I can't comment.
When I wanted to delay my check-out until 1 o'clock, the guy at the front desk happily extended my check-out to 2 o'clock.
Went to the gym and swimming pool from 7:00-23:00. There are four pools in the swimming pool, one large, three small, and the large one is a normal swimming pool. The three small ones are cold water, warm water and (relatively) high temperature. The high-temperature pool is said to have massage jets, but it is not actually open. It started with swimming, and then it turned into hot springs in a high-temperature pool. The gym equipment is average, I think it's a bit sp****.
Overall, it's worth staying. I hope I can have a better experience next time I come back.

Location: Close to the South Railway Station, Shuangliu Airport, Tianfu Airport, Tianfu Airport, 10 minutes by taxi from the Chunxi Road business district, and very close to famous tourist attractions such as Tianfu Square, Kuanzhai Alley, and Jinli. The subway station Line 1 is a 3-minute walk from the hotel.
Service: The concierge and front desk are always responsive, especially Miss Joanna at the front desk who is very enthusiastic and patient. The design of the room card must be mentioned. The wooden room card is very distinctive and reveals the concept of low-carbon and environmental protection. The large CHENGDU design is a low-key and luxurious room card. Soft drinks in the minibar are free, including Evian, and the welcome fruit plate comes with Panna and San Pellegrino.
Hygiene: The room has a very different feeling from other spaces, and the overall style shows the fresh and simple style that is popular at the moment.

Facilities: The air conditioning has a good cooling effect and is very comfortable when not directly affecting people.
Its executive lounge deserves a special mention. The coffee and tea are from the Austrian Little Red Riding Hood brand. In addition to the regular Chinese and Western meals during the evening happy hour, there is also a noodle stall where you can make freshly prepared dandan noodles, hand-cooked noodles, etc. with Sichuan characteristics. staple food. There are also sausages, pork knuckles and sauerkraut that are very German. Germany's most representative Paulaner fresh beer is also a must. It has the first original German brewing machine in Chengdu.
Breakfast is also worth mentioning. There is "energy juice" when you enter the door, which is eye-catching. Other meals are combined with local Chengdu characteristics, including many local delicacies such as steamed beef with tofu, pot helmets, etc., which have the taste of a Chengdu breakfast shop. They are very thoughtful in many aspects and also reflect the differences and characteristics of German hotels. The location is good and the price/performance ratio is very good.

The rooms are fully equipped and decorated in a simple and stylish manner. The mattress is moderately soft and firm, very satisfying.
Although it is close to an overpass, it is not too noisy and does not affect your sleep.
The hygiene is good and no problems were found.
The service is okay and the housekeeping staff are the best.

The hotel lobby and Western restaurant are relatively old, but the rooms are newly renovated and cleaned very clean. The old five-star hotel is definitely the big brother in terms of service, crushing the newly opened hotels in recent years. From the uncle at the door to the aunt in the room, as well as the Western restaurant staff, they are all enthusiastic and smiling. There are many kinds of breakfast, and the quality is also very good. Leshan tofu, dandan noodles, egg rolls, and energy juice are amazing.

msg:This time I came to Chengdu to attend a high school reunion. Before departure, I also fell into the hotel selection syndrome: there are many five-star hotels in Chengdu, but I am afraid of stepping into the wrong five-star hotel. After careful consideration and the price being reasonable, this time I chose the ancient luxury hotel brand in Europe: Kempinski. Although there are very few Kempinskis in China, this brand in Europe can be said to have been brilliant throughout Europe in the era when it was born.
Okay, let‚Äôs talk about our experience during this stay! To sum up in one sentence: It is indeed a hotel I chose after careful consideration. Very satisfied. From checking in at the front desk to entering the room and finally checking out, the service is quite excellent. From the enthusiasm of the staff, the responsiveness of the service, and the reluctance to leave you when leaving, it can be seen that the hotel staff must have been professionally trained training. Especially for the employees in the lobby, the front office management staff must have given a lot of care and training. Only the front office depar**ent of this hotel can demonstrate such meticulous and excellent service. I give praise to the leaders and employees.
Today when my friends were dropping them off at the airport, I was still recommending Kempinski Chengdu to them. It was so great that I would not allow them not to stay at Kempinski Chengdu!
Finally, I attach a few pictures taken while wandering around the hotel. They are not very interesting, but this panda doll is amazing, very two-dimensional, hahahahahahaha, I am so happy!

After observing, he basically took every guest to check in. The check-in at the front desk was also very efficient and professional. The explanations were very clear, which allowed me to have a basic understanding of the hotel structure and my trea**ent in a short period of time. Understood, worthy of praise! It was also dinner time when we checked in. I didn‚Äôt want to go out to eat so I went to experience the happy hour in the executive lounge. The service staff in the lounge were still friendly and enthusiastic. Although it was a simple meal, the dishes were still remarkable, including staple dishes, salads and hard dishes. , it is an unexpected experience for a business trip like me. Every process from check-in to check-out made me feel comfortable. I will choose it again next time.

The hotel's breakfast was okay, and the afternoon tea and happy hour were a bit disappointing. There were cold dishes and hot dishes. There were almost 10 items together, there were very few things to eat, and the scenery was average. We stayed for a while and then went back! It feels like making up the numbers. There is no children's play area. It rained during our trip and there was basically no place to play in the hotel.

When I checked in, I told the waiter that I wanted a non-smoking room, but they told me that they would make it non-smoking. I wanted to endure it, but I couldn't sleep much the whole night. Fortunately, I had to wait until 6 o'clock in the morning to catch my flight and leave. Is this really a Kempinski? It can't be because the price is low and it doesn't even have basic services. Goodbye, never see you again, it's really close to the airport, a 13-minute drive in the morning. It's a good place to stay if you like smoking and are not afraid of biting and don't need warm service.

What I have experienced more deeply is the uncles who pick up and drop off at the door. No matter which residents they are when I take a taxi every day, the uncles are amiable, with standard and sincere language, and take the initiative to help people open the door and carry the suitcases, making people feel at home.

The lady at the front desk of the hotel is also very NICE, good at business and considerate of the guests.

The daily breakfast is more aware of the difference in service. Before the end of 10 o'clock, the waiter notified one by one. 10 minutes before the end, I saw that the back kitchen was still displaying new dishes every day. This is rarely done in other hotels. It seems that Kempinski's service is indeed well-deserved!

Suggestion: Take care when storing tableware in restaurants.

On the first day, I booked a super large room in the selection suite
But it seems that the living room is useless except for sleeping
The bathtub is not comfortable, it is a little small
The spare part is Ferragamo, the fruit is not very tasty
The things in the lounge are average, not many varieties
I didn't go to dinner in the next few days because it basically didn't change.
It's convenient to stay here and take a taxi to go anywhere.

The guest room was newly renovated in 21 years. It is clean and a**ospheric. There is an air machine in the room. The suite has a large space. I started to choose a suite. Because I came early, I gave a family suite with a workbench. It is very big, with two sofas and a TV. It is also big enough. After watching the Super League game, the a**osphere is full.
The girl in red in the hotel handles various matters throughout the whole process. She is very warm. She made birthday arrangements for the child and gave away a panda bear! Special thanks to the manager on duty and Xiaoxin for their enthusiastic follow-up service.
Before I left, I left the charger behind, and the phone quickly came after me, and then the courier sent it before I boarded the planeüòÇ

msg:The Kempinski Hotel belongs to the famous category of hotels, and so does this one in Chengdu. The overall environment of the hotel is good, leaving a high-grade impression on people. The room design is also very special, very textured, the functional space layout and division are reasonable, and the bedding and toiletries are clean and hygienic. The hotel's software and services are also very good. In addition, the hotel's indoor swimming pool service is also very good.
However, there are some problems with the lighting design inside the lifts of this hotel. The light inside the elevator car is relatively dim, and the light intensity of the floor indicators is high, resulting in black floor numbers, and it is basically difficult to see the floor buttons, making operation difficult. Suggest adjus**ents or improvements.

The transportation is convenient, and the parking lot for self-driving is also large, so it is convenient to go anywhere.

The service staff on the 19th floor remembered my room number and were very polite. The supervisor on the 15th floor was also very patient.

I would like to make complaints about the design of the shower equipment in the room. If the shower on the top is not working well, then replace the shower with a shower that is not hot and can be adjusted in height, so that customers will not complain.

In addition, the bed is still a little damp. If the air conditioner consumes electricity and is not environmentally friendly, guests should be advised to keep the purifier on.

The pillow is too big and the pillow is sloped, which is uncomfortable.

Please add a luggage table when you check in on the first floor. After all, it is 5 stars, so it needs to be more detailed.

Overall satisfied.

When I went out, he would also ask if there was a taxi, and he would enthusiastically guide me to the subway station. I was very impressed.
On the executive floor where I stayed, the younger sisters in charge of the executive lounge also had a very good attitude. During breakfast, I would take the initiative to serve cooked noodles or fried eggs for me. Seeing that I was looking for a cup, he would bring it for me immediately.
Because I wanted to change the room, I took the initiative to call me in the morning and said that the room was ready in advance and I could move there directly.
I have experienced both the breakfast in the executive lounge and the breakfast on the second floor. The second floor is very rich, with special dishes such as pot helmets and tofu nao. There are not many people, which is very good. The afternoon tea and hh in the executive lounge are a bit simple, but acceptable.

msg:Hygiene: very good! Clean and hygienic! The bedding is very dry, and the white cotton linen is very comfortable
Environment: The decoration of the hotel lobby is average, but the plush carpet in the corridor is very clean, there is no musty smell at all, and the faint fragrance lingers around you all the time. The rooms are simple and luxurious, and the sink is very fun. If you don‚Äôt study for a while, you don‚Äôt know how to turn on the tap to wash your hands. The super large round mirror makes you doubt your life. The shower room without a door is thrilling. But the designer's careful thinking can be seen everywhere.
Service: The doorman service is very enthusiastic! Help open the door, take the luggage, and move quickly! I want to tip him! Thank you so much!
The small refrigerator in the room provides free: 4 bottles of Coke ü•§, a bottle of Evian mineral water, a bottle of orange juice, a bottle of soda water, four bottles of Zhuoma spring water, a 200 yuan spa voucher, a very valuable accommodation experience.
It is a pity that Didi Taxi cannot accurately locate the address of the hotel lobby, and it is very inconvenient to take a taxi on rainy days! Didi can only navigate to the side of the road. The hotel lobby has to turn in. I called a few Didi cars, but I couldn‚Äôt find the way. I couldn‚Äôt pick up people at the entrance of the hotel lobby. It was too troublesome! I originally planned to give 10 points, but this inconvenient taxi experience affected the score, I suggest improving it!
Facilities: The shower and toilet are very easy to use, and the room is very quiet! Suitable for customers with poor sleep quality.

2. The room is small and the bed is also small. The two small beds in the standard room are almost next to each other.
3. The soundproofing of the room is really bad! Speak clearly in the corridor

Because I spilled water on the bed sheets on the first day, I specially wrote I wrote a note, please replace the bed sheet and quilt cover with new ones, but when I came back at night, there were stains on the bed sheets. It was really a shame. Is it because the new sheets were not cleaned? It's still not changed at all. This kind of stain is too disgusting. Since it was too late, I didn't bother the room staff to clean it up. I had no choice but to switch to the other side to sleep, resulting in poor sleep quality on the last night. This situation is reasonable To be honest, it shouldn't be in a five-star hotel, especially Kempinski. I didn't complain to the front desk because I was catching a flight the next day, but this situation is really puzzling

The most commendable thing is the breakfast made on site, which is fresh and delicious, and there is even a mini children's paradise in the restaurant. The daily special drink is amazing. My daughter and I drank until we didn‚Äôt know if it was the last two glasses. The taste is wonderful, and the combination of various ingredients is just right.

msg:Every Wednesday, I will buy Ctrip's special package. This time I saw the Chengdu Kempinski Executive Suite, and decided to take a trip with my girlfriends.

Facilities: The lobby and the elevator are really old, but the room was renovated in 21 years. The room design is quite in line with modern aesthetics. I like it when I open the door and enter the room.

Hygiene: Because we stayed for two consecutive days, the housekeeper was called by us to replenish some coffee capsules and bottled water. The sanitation cleaning was rather sloppy, and the cleaning was hasty. Even the sewer in the bathroom was not cleaned. Okay. Let's pick up the hair that falls out by myselfüôä

Environment: The geographical location is superior by visual inspection. There is a subway next to it. To be honest, I didn't go shopping. I just called a car to go. But there is no so-called landscape, the viaduct is just under the window

Service: The service is really appropriate and professional like that of an old-fashioned hotel. Call to confirm your needs before check-in. The concierge can store boxes, and the reception is polite and warm.

Tell me a few things that don't feel good
First, there are few options for afternoon tea and happy hour in the executive lounge. The cakes are pretty good, but they don‚Äôt smell like refrigerators, and they aren‚Äôt that terribly sweet dessert. The cream is also good.
There is no alcohol in happy hour, just a simple soft drink. The fruit is so fresh and sweet that we only had breakfast for one day. Kempinski‚Äôs catering needs to be improved
Second, the old five-star hotel will hold many meetings at the end of the year, so there are really many people, and the elevators are not easy to wait.
Third, the set meal includes a set of dinner at DR bar. Except for the traditional German pork knuckle and sausages, the others are really not like the bars in five-star hotels, especially the cheese baked rice, which is hard to describe!
Fourth, the executive suite is set to be non-smoking, but because there were no vacancies on the non-smoking floor when we checked in, it was arranged to the 20th floor. The bad smell of the sewer, um, yes, it is the smell of the sewer... There is no smell in the bedroom, so I didn't bother to ask for a room change.

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êThe concierge uncle at the door is very enthusiastic, smiling and looking very festive, while helping us with our luggage, he also criticized the driver, saying that he is not a gentleman enough not to help the lady with the suitcase (super cute uncle)

Jessie (hope the name is not misspelled) who was in charge of contacting me was also very enthusiastic, took us upstairs and introduced the room.

The service of the staff is really good, but if you have been eating three meals a day in the hotel like us, really, the food at his house needs to be improved!

It turned out that the electric curtains were broken and I couldn‚Äôt pull the curtains. I called the front desk for the first time. The waiter was very impatient and told me in a tone of infinite disgust that the curtains It's electric, I laughed, thank you for telling me there are electric shades, but have you ever seen manual shades get stuck? I confirmed with her that there is a problem with the electric curtains, and she said to help someone come up to look at it. As a result, there was no sound after waiting for 10 minutes. The family sat and waited, and then called the front desk. They said that the master was busy and had to wait another 20 minutes. They asked if they could change the room, and they were very impatient and said that they needed to coordinate with the front desk. How long does it take to coordinate, and I don‚Äôt say the time, well, I just waited and told you quietly, and then no one responded, yes, no one cared about this matter, and there was not a single feedback call. Fortunately, the curtains were fine again after a while, so I didn't have to worry about it. When I went to take a shower, I saw several hairs left by the predecessors on the wall, hey.

The service is good, there is a charging station downstairs, it is convenient to charge the tram, and the decoration of the hotel has won my heart, and my family likes it very much. The price is too good, 400 a night on the eve of the Spring Festival, invincible value! The location of the hotel is also very good, very close to Kuanzhai Alley and Jinli, convenient for dining and parking! Next time you come to Chengdu, you must choose the hotel first.

The hotel hadn't been fully renovated when I checked in last time. This time it can be regarded as a brand new Kempinski that has been fully renovated. After the renovation, it glows with a new vitality.
Here I am very grateful to the sweet and lovely Ms. Crystal, the supervisor of the hotel's executive lounge, for carefully arranging the room upgrade and welcome reception, and introducing the hotel facilities in detail. I have stayed in many hotels of the same price. The products in this lounge are very kind. The breakfast in the western restaurant is also very good overall.
Looking forward to the next encounter Love Kempinski‚ù§Ô∏è

Kempinski is located on Renmin South Road, the central axis of Chengdu, with a subway station downstairs, convenient transportation and a good location. Many thanks to Sabrina, Front Office Manager, for taking care of me. After checking in, Jessie, a red-clothed girl with the brand's characteristics, will guide you to the room, and give a detailed explanation of the hotel's history, culture and facilities.
The newly refurbished executive lounge is located on the top floor of the hotel. The refurbished style is completely different from the lobby, showing the current popular minimalist and fashionable style. The spacious and bright interior environment makes you feel comfortable and comfortable. Special thumbs up to Ada, the lounge manager, Crystal, the supervisor, and Carry, the guest service center! Through the window, you can see the Rongcheng skyline in full view, with a prosperous and open perspective.
Infuse European-style luxury into the charm of Bashu and experience an extraordinary German-style experience, thus opening the first stop of an unprecedented trip to Chengdu.

It was the first time I stayed after 21 years of renovation. The decoration of the room is younger, but the texture is slightly lacking. The big bed room will be equipped with a bathtub, a toilet Duravit, and electric curtains. As for the bathroom amenities, only the executive floor (above the 18th floor) is Ferragamo. , the following are more common. Although the room has been newly renovated, most of the public areas have not changed, especially the interior of the elevator still uses a very old flower carpet, and it is not very clean and does not echo the room. The pool has not been remodeled, but is well maintained. The gym environment is not good, there is no desire to exercise at all, the breakfast is good, the partition is reasonable, the Chinese and Western salad bar, the noodle stall, the juice area, there are many varieties and good taste. I especially like Xiao Liu (girl) at the front desk, who has a strong sense of service. When he sees me waiting, he will take the initiative to ask and use a free computer to help change rooms. The lobby is old and the lighting is too dim, giving people a feeling of depression. Currently the third floor is being renovated, and there is noise on the lower floors. The price of more than 400 with double breakfast is still very cost-effective. It is much better than living in Taikoo Li on Chunxi Road.

msg:Seeing the reviews on Ctrip, everyone said that this hotel has a brand new decoration experience. I just came to Chengdu to play this time, so I chose this hotel. When I first arrived at the hotel, it should have just hit the peak period of the front desk check-in. You can also see the popularity of the hotel. But I was very fortunate that I did it in the lounge. The girl who checked in for me seemed to be called Xiao He. The check-in process was very smooth and very professional and enthusiastic. She also told me that the lounge was also newly renovated, so I visited Come on, there is a very good viewing platform. The picture below is I took in the lounge, it is really beautiful. Anyway, the general point of the executive lounge is that the work efficiency is high and the waiting time is short. Then I didn't know what hot pot to eat in the back, Xiao He also gave me a very enthusiastic recommendation, let me avoid lightning or something, I felt very caring, I will come here next time I have the opportunity to come to Chengdu!

Considering that I brought my family this time, I chose to upgrade. In general, I was not disappointed, plus it was too hot [his tears burst into laughter] power cuts in many places in Chengdu, the hotel still guarantees air conditioning, which is very satisfying. The efficiency of the front desk is also good, and the four counters are all lined up, which is understandable. Ambience: Except for the lobby, everything else has been upgraded, and the bar is also very comfortable ~ but the band started singing and we left. The meat is fragrant. Not a professional, can't comment on what's good. Value for money hotel. Room: Although the area is not large, the design is relatively simple. The only thing is that there is no door in the bathroom. It is really inconvenient for us to bring a family. Others are good.

The style of the hotel is a tough industrial style and it is very clean. Because the flight was at 6:30 pm, the front desk of the hotel also helped to delay the check-out until 3:00 pm, thank you. The hotel's breakfast is also delicious, in line with the level of a five-star hotel. Next time I travel to Chengdu, I will consider choosing this home to stay.

Services:
        First of all, praise the girl in red Crystal He for her friendly, dedicated and professional service. After checking in, Crystal He will take us to the room, take the initiative to help with the bags, and ask if we need to explain the room after we arrive at the room. Crystal He gave a very comprehensive introduction to the room, which mentioned the free use of the mini bar and the tips of other charged items. He was polite and polite. After that, he took the initiative to ask us when we needed to deliver the cake. After getting the answer, we delivered the exquisite and delicious cake, candles and handwritten blessing cards within the estimated time, which was very heartwarming. For dinner, I met Crystal He again at the DR Bar on the first floor, and the whole service was also very good. When I checked out the next day, I mentioned that I wanted to keep a room card (because the quality of Kempinski's wooden room card is very good, and CHENGDU is printed on it) Crystal He went to find us two brand new ones Card and gave each of us a Kempinski keychain and card case, very pleasant surprise!
       Thanks to the housekeeper Yao Xiuhui for helping with the room layout, the cake folded with towels is very cute, the welcome red wine and fruit are very delicate~

Room facilities:
        The high-quality marble texture highlights Kempinski's aesthetic taste. As one of the oldest hotels in Chengdu, this renovation has indeed brought a second spring to the hotel. Spare is Ferragamo, very useful. The only downside may be that the razor is a bit dull haha.

Dining:
        In addition to the service, the most worthy of praise is the food and beverages. The afternoon tea presented by the Titanium Card is pleasantly fragrant in the snow in Bitan. The pork knuckles, chicken wings, and ribs in the DR Bar are delicious, and the weight loss process has to be put on hold haha.

All in all, the Kempinski yyds left a very deep and wonderful impression on me on my 23rd birthday.

But there are a few small problems to talk about: Parking is at the ground parking lot in front of the hotel, which is actually very convenient. It is very convenient to get off and take a few steps to the gate. However, when it is parked in the open air in summer, the car is still a bit unbearable, so get in the car. Also very hot. I originally wanted to park the underground parking lot, but it was not open. It is recommended to open it in summer. In addition, the smoking area outside is also very hot. It is recommended to install a fan or something. After all, there are not many people who smoke in Chengdu. There are no other problems, and it feels better and better after the renovation. Of course, the old hotel services must be online.

The location is very advantageous. It is very close to the subway station. It is very convenient to go to the city. The hot pot and snacks around the hotel are also very nice. The newly renovated rooms of the hotel reveal the luxurious a**osphere of Auchan, and the breakfast style in the western restaurant is delicious. The hotel staff also listened to our demands patiently and provided very humane service! Will come again!

The newly opened DR bar, freshly brewed authentic German dark beer and yellow beer, has a refreshing taste, and the waiters are very active and enthusiastic.
The breakfast restaurant has a wide variety of dishes, and all kinds of juice are freshly squeezed by the staff, with zero additions. The selection of fruit is very good, and it tastes pure fructose.
Location: In the most prosperous Tongzilin in Chengdu, it takes 15 minutes to go to Chunxi Road, and no more than 30 minutes to any attractions in the city. It is very convenient and fast.
After many suggestions, the business center finally changed the computer, which shows that the hotel will still listen to the opinions of the guests, and the feedback from the customers is positive and effective, which will be valued by the management.
Great value for money, recommend everyone to stay

Service: The training of the hotel staff is in place, and the service is quite warm, cordial and precise. Thanks to the lady in red for contacting me in advance before I arrived at the store and helping me prepare a non-smoking room. The staff at the bar on the first floor were also very kind. As soon as my drink was finished, they asked me if I wanted to refill.
Amenities: The energy drinks and lactose-free milk for breakfast are very intimate, and feel full of power after drinking.
The banquet hall on the fifth floor is also newly renovated. It is very majestic. It must be a good choice for a conference and wedding banquet.
The water temperature in the swimming pool is just right, but the ceiling is really too high. The staff of the recreation center greeted the guests earnestly when they saw the guests, and the gym has long business hours, but many of the facilities are very old.
Price: I booked room 530. The room faces the second ring road. At night, you can see the beautiful elevated and the night view of Chengdu.
Generally speaking, in this price range, there are many hotels to choose from, but Kempinski must be the ceiling. Foreign management really cares about details and services.

Now I see the decoration and the room is really good. The environment of the lobby and restaurant has not been improved, but the breakfast is still online, especially the noodles from Sichuan are delicious. The Kempinski breakfast in Beijing who has lived in Beijing before is also very good. In the evening, I went to this bar on the first floor with my colleagues. The open-air location is too comfortable and just lukewarm. The big screen broadcasts the game. It's a treasure! Beer is still brewed.
Service: I always feel that service depends on luck. Sometimes the staff I encounter are really good. For example, this time, the front desk, guest room and restaurant are all very good. Concierge The manager in a suit vest was warm and humorous. Of course you have to watch it a few times.
In general, this hotel is very cost-effective during the epidemic!

After returning to China for 3 years, I have stayed in most of the five-star hotels in Chengdu. The first review in my life is dedicated to the passionate Kempinski. In Switzerland, the teacher said that Kempinski's services are the best in the world. The meticulous care of the girls in red, Rita and Jessie, touched me deeply. In Chengdu, there is no more authentic European service than Kempinski. Because I like to be quiet, to be alone, and I don't want to bother and disturb the staff. I appreciate your enthusiasm.

msg:Because it is convenient to go to Shuangliu Airport and staying in Kempinski, the location is a great advantage. It is backed by the South Second Ring Road, which is basically the connection between the new and old urban areas of Chengdu. The subway has Line 1, and it is very convenient to take a taxi.
Kempinski's unique girl in red, I like it very much. She introduced DR BAR and helped her to escort her bag to the door of the room. I liked her. It's a pity that the doorman is not at the door when entering or leaving the door. The series of anti-epidemic measures such as temperature measurement and site code scanning are completely decorations. The key is that Kempinski's own propaganda emphasizes anti-epidemic measures, which is really unreasonable...
In 2021, the room will be upgraded and renovated, and the so-called European-style luxury "veteran style" will be changed. The light luxury and fashionable decoration style is obviously more in line with the current aesthetics. The whole facility, whether it is the design style or the quality of the facilities and equipment, is very good. The fresh air system is very good. Although the room is very new, there is no peculiar smell. The temperature during the day and night is very comfortable. The staff also kindly asked me if the temperature in my room was suitable. Before the toiletries, it was Ferragamo. This time I saw the Dutch Rituals Lefo, which is relatively small but the actual feeling is not bad.
The room rate includes meals, and the unit price is not cheap. There are still many choices for breakfast, and the taste is average. The key point is that the supply time is very good, 6:30-10:00, covering a wide range. The only downside is that the waiter cleans up the table too fast, I just got up and went to get some food, and the table was cleaned up when I came back... I have seen similar situations at other tables. It is suggested to use a small ornament or a small card or the like. Those who are dining can put it on the table to signal not to accept it.
There is a DR BAR downstairs. You can have a drink.
The biggest feeling is that the style has changed and it really makes up for the shortcomings. After all, Kempinski has been rooted in Chengdu for nearly 20 years. Although the style of the room has changed, it still looks old, including the lobby. The old five-star transformation, innovation and tradition. How to balance it is a question to think about. After all, the overall stay this time, I feel that it is not very good compared to the emerging hotels of the same series in Chengdu.

I experienced afternoon tea at the hotel and happyhour in the evening. Although the lounge was not open, unfortunately, the hotel made up for the regret with more services and warmth. The buns in the lobby bar are particularly beautiful, and the meat floss bread is especially recommended. The concierge at the door is also very dedicated and must praise him

Really broke the defense, it is too difficult to be a human being, the problem is that I still walked away silently, and did not dare to continue to fight for my own power]
What happened is as follows:
1. On March 16th, because I had to drive the car in the morning, I was in a hurry to check out, and then I remembered that I forgot my slippers in the hotel, because I was busy with work during the day, so I didn't care. The hotel phone. In the evening, I found the hotel phone number from Ctrip and contacted the front desk of the hotel. I told the situation, and the front desk said they would help put it away. Thank you here.
On March 17, after returning from a business trip, I went to the front desk of the hotel to pick up the slippers as soon as possible. I found the slippers for me, although it took a little time.
The above is a mediocre talk, there is nothing to say, except that the slippers that the guests pulled down did not take the initiative to contact, and there is no door in the shower room of the guest room (yes, it is three-sided, with one side open, and I complained to my friends on the night of check-in, as expected It is a German management company, the decoration style is black, the TV wall is black, all the lights in the room are turned on, it is dark, and the disposable slippers are placed in a wooden drawer inside a glass cabinet (forgive me for being stupid for a long time), the sink Splashing water, etc., there is nothing else to be dissatisfied with.
2. Knock on the blackboard ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
The check-out is automatically deducted by Alipay, and I didn't pay attention to the actual bill before, because there is generally no additional consumption, which is the room fee for Ctrip reservations.
I got the bill and found that there was a charged bottle of mineral water. I was shocked and asked which bottle of water in the room was charged for 28 yuan. The front desk staff said that it was at the bedside. Oh my god, there are two bottles by the bed, luckily I don‚Äôt have that much hand* to open two bottles (because there are free bottled water on the sink)
Me: The room is really too dark, I didn‚Äôt see the reminder of the fee at all, why did I put it on the dark bedside, I really didn‚Äôt see the reminder of the fee, because generally the fees are placed at the small bar or on the TV conspicuous side.
Hotel front desk staff: There is a charge reminder, which is placed on the bedside because of the different habits of guests.
I would like to say a few more words, the front desk just said that I don‚Äôt want your money (I‚Äôm already a little angry here, mainly because of the tone of the other party, I‚Äôm short of money, I‚Äôm short of 20 million, it‚Äôs really not short of 28 yuan) please Make up for each other's tone of voice. I was scared, and silently put on my slippers and left.
On the way back, the more I thought about it, the angrier I became. I was really too weak at the critical moment, and I couldn‚Äôt even quarrel. I was crying because I was justified, and I became unreasonable.
In fact, what I want to express is that the hotel can put bottled water for a fee, please put it in an eye-catching place, clarify the price so that the other party can see clearly, and respect the other party (just don‚Äôt need your money, this sentence, let me I want to smoke people, but as a young man in the new era, I still have to have quality, I‚Äôm joking here, I can only comfort myself).
The problem that can be solved with a sorry at the front desk made me angry for two hours, it's not worth it, I can't be angry.

It can be said that it is currently a hotel without slots.

Brand new design, the front desk was very politely upgraded to an executive room, free drinks, and a coffee machine, the overall style is what I like very much, and the most important thing is that there is no smell in the newly renovated house, and there is an air purifier, very Praise!
üîîService:

When supplementing the supplies, due to a little episode, the shower gel and shampoo were mixed up, and the aunt in the guest room added it immediately. This kind of service attitude is completely different from the way of handling the hygiene problems of Jinjiang Hotel the next day. Kudos to Ji's management team and staff!
In the future, I will choose Kempinski when I come to Chengdu.

2. The Kempinski‚Äôs specialty Prana restaurant is gone, change it to DR, the beer quality is extremely poor, the steak can‚Äôt be chewed, the sausage must be a set meal, there is no a la carte. Prana is an integral part of Kempinski's territory. I really don't know what this hotel thinks?
3. After staying for three nights, the sheets and quilts have not been changed. The cleaning staff especially like to put the used toothbrush and toothpaste that have been placed on the sink into the mouthwash cup. In four days and three nights, I only added shampoo and shower gel once, and the hot and cold bath water was totally uncontrollable! !
4. The waiter guarding the breakfast gate told me not to wear slippers for dinner. When I pointed out that you didn‚Äôt remind me, she took out her mobile phone and said, I have photos! I show you! A card the size of a business card, with a few lines written in small four fonts of word, there are no suggestions, no hints, and words that are not forbidden.
5. The standard of breakfast is not much better than that of Quanji Atour. If there is no hot Chinese food at 8:30, no one will make up for it. In the hot dish area, basically half of them are empty or half empty. Of course, maybe I made it up after I finished eating, or I didn't see it when I made it up. The uncle who cooks noodles talks a lot of nonsense, whether you want spicy food or not, he always has his reasons to teach you what you want.
6. The shower is open...no door

Location: Very close to Metro Line 1, to the railway station, the city center is basically about 30-45 minutes, which is basically acceptable to me
The breakfast in the hotel is very rich. You can play an egg into four or five kinds of tricks. There are also Chengdu special snacks and staple food. It is worth mentioning. When I first arrived, there will be a young lady who will take the initiative to pour me coffee or tea, which is very warm
In terms of service, many room attendants and the lady at the front desk will take the initiative to say hello. Once I forgot to wear a mask and went out, the lady at the front desk took the initiative to provide it. Thank you very much.
During the epidemic, the health code and itinerary code are strictly checked, which is very standardized and very reassuring!

The people inside pretended not to be able to see it and went to the front desk to complain. The male manager had a very bad attitude. He said that you should go upstairs and change your shoes.

If you need it, we are ready to wait for the guests next to you to check in and swipe your room card. If you don‚Äôt need it, we are ready to go up! As a result, there was some quarrel with the guests who stayed next to him (tell the child not to stand next to him). At this time, a fat service staff came (without wearing a mask all the way) with a very bad attitude and said, I can't help you to swipe the card , They are too noisy, I said you have such a bad attitude, I want to complain. The fat waiter said that it is up to you to complain, and he looked fearless. I said if you don‚Äôt help us fix it quickly, how can I let my friend go? He speaks very badly, loudly and fiercely! Very unfriendly! A chain hotel staff is such a bad attitude, and the way it is handled? As an employee you should reconcile the customer's problems, not add fuel to the fire! extremely bad

The hotel service is very nice. Although the house still has a little taste after renovation, the overall feeling is very new. The suites are spacious and the layout is magnificent. The price of less than one thousand is absolutely high.

With gha black card blessing, the guest room has been upgraded from a deluxe room to an executive suite. The area reached 70 square meters at once. The hotel presented a large bowl of welcome fruit. They also gave us cakes and sparkling wine, which made us feel super good.
The minibar is free, except for Evian mineral water.
The bathroom is spacious and bright, and Feiligemu's accessories are undoubtedly full of sincerity at this price.
The hotel is a city view, so you don‚Äôt have to be picky in any direction.

The executive suite offers free afternoon tea and HH
The afternoon tea for the two days is different. It includes a three-tiered snack tower, two drinks and fruits, from 2:30 pm to 5 pm, long standby time.
HH is served in the bar on the first floor. It is a la carte. There are dozens of snacks such as sushi, chicken wings, pork ribs, cocktails, etc., which are quite characteristic of German snacks.
It is worth mentioning that his breakfast is really pleasantly surprised! There are tofu noodles and dandan noodles in Chengdu cuisine, a la carte buffet, and there are many varieties.
And it may be the cause of the epidemic. There are not many guests, which makes the breakfast and dining environment very comfortable.

Thanks to Miss He, the lady in red, for her warm arrangement these days.
Help us arrange the shuttle bus to and from Mount Qingcheng and the panda base, saving a lot of energy.

First of all, as a GHA black card member, contact the hotel in advance before check-in. The lady in red actively contacted on WeChat, carefully noted the needs, and told that the suite could be upgraded depending on the room status. Her attitude was quite enthusiastic!
When it came time to check in, although the suite was full on the first day and only upgraded to the executive floor, the front desk was also very active on the second day to help quickly arrange the cleaning of the suite and move in.
At present, only half of the rooms in the hotel have been renovated. The decoration style is very simple and elegant. The color scheme uses dark green that is rarely used in the hotel. The marble tiles used in the entrance and bathroom show that the hotel has been renovated. The hotel's button light control switch board is also very advanced and intelligent. In short, the hotel is full of modernity. It is worthy of being a modern five-star hotel in 2021. The hardware is absolutely sincere.

In terms of software, the hotel‚Äôs breakfast is very rich, that is, the end time is only until 10 o‚Äôclock, which is a little earlier than 11 o‚Äôclock on weekends in many hotels. The welcome fruits and welcome gifts are very attentive. Special thanks to the lady in red, Crystal, from beginning to end.

After watching the European Cup, I stayed up until 4 o'clock and couldn't stand it before going to bed. I was woken up by a loud noise before 8 o'clock in the morning. When I called the front desk, they actually said: Sorry, the store is under renovation. We have been contacted. The engineering depar**ent dealt with it, and it took another half an hour to drill before stopping. ***, I have never encountered anyone using an electric drill to drill into the wall of a hotel before eight o'clock in the morning. I was upset and lying on the bed playing with my mobile phone. Suddenly I felt something crawling on my neck. An ominous premonition suddenly arose. I quickly got up and saw a caterpillar about 3cm crawling on the white pillow. I almost vomited. Fortunately, the kids don't live in this room. Damn it, the key is not to get angry publicly. I'm afraid that if the kids find out, it will affect their mood for the game. I'm really angry. I was planning to stay here forever and immediately decided to check out. I took a photo here. I took photos of bugs to the front desk to check out. The staff just said in an understatement that they were sorry for not doing a good job in cleaning and would give me breakfast... Haha, I was afraid that my family would find out and it would affect my mood. I didn't say anything more. In the afternoon, a manager took the initiative to call and say I apologized and said that I hope I can go back to stay and give me a discount to compensate. I really don‚Äôt know how you have such an idea to deal with the problem. I was also drunk. In fact, I had no intention of pursuing anything further. I could only admit that I was unlucky and forget it. I was full of depression and had nowhere to vent. I would like to complain here, but I guarantee that it is the truth with my personality.

msg:Kempinski, I was associated with a black card, so I upgraded my room to level 2 to the executive room, not a suite!
Xiaohe, the lady in red, has good service.
The executive room is on the 19th floor and has been renovated. The rooms are good, the welcome gift is rich, and the breakfast is of good standard. Dandan noodles and eggs benedict are well received.
The executive lounge is still being renovated, so afternoon tea is eaten in the lobby, and afternoon tea is relatively ordinary.
There are very few things during happy hour, but couples‚Äô lungs are still good.
The inadequacy of the hotel is that the lobby is relatively old, the swimming pool is also very old, the locker room is even more old, the gym is not gone, and it is probably very old.
In addition, Chengdu Kempinski does not give room nights for gha members, but other gha hotels are booked on Ctrip. Therefore, if you want a room night, Chengdu Kempinski should not book on Ctrip.

msg:üßπHygiene: Due to the late check-in, the room was not carefully checked, but the water in the shower room in the room would flow directly to the bottom of the washbasin when bathing, resulting in the floor towel coming out of the ground and the floor mat under the washbasin getting wet, it is recommended that the hotel Managers should first experience the bugs after the new decoration.

üîîService: The reserved executive room, including 2 breakfasts and executive trea**ent, was not mentioned at the front desk when checking in. But I took the initiative to explain that it is an executive king bed, right? The other party replied, yes. Then I did not continue to introduce the benefits of the executive room, including the administrative benefits, and after checking in, I didn't tell me the room included breakfast, where to use the breakfast, and what time did it open, let alone what time it was open. There is an introduction.

Check in late, check out early. It was not until today that I found out that the deposit has not been returned, so I called the hotel and when the phone was transferred to the front desk, the switchboard did not send my request and my check-in information to the front desk, which led me to repeat my request again. After arriving at the situation, the front desk replied that I forgot to operate, and immediately performed the operation for me.

Here I have a question, if I didn't find out and call to ask, then the fee will be returned by itself after a month? Or as they said on the phone, in a few days they will operate after they find out, this problem is unknown!

The above problems are the real experience of this stay, and I hope the management of your hotel will pay attention to it! ! !

Xiao Zhang (Zhang Zhida) at the front desk found that the room was still being cleaned on the computer and asked us to temporarily Check in one hour after you have stored your luggage. As soon as we walked to the door, Xiao Zhang rushed over and said that you are getting older. I found a room on the 15th floor that was cleaned up and let us upgrade to the 15th floor. Thank you so much. Taking care of the elderly in this way allows us to enter the room early to rest. Thank you so much. Must like.

msg:The hotel has been renovated. It is okay to look at the details carefully, and the brands used are all good, but at first glance it really looks like an express hotel.
The welcoming guest on the first floor is a decoration, and there is basically no greeting, not to mention helping with the box. I saw that the welcoming guests are basically standing at their service counter, and the gate is often unmanned.
Hotel front desk service is average.
There should be a place similar to drinking on the third floor. At night, there are many people in the hotel.
The price/performance ratio is average, the room is small, the toilet is open, and the shower room has no door.
The hotel management is not good. It was 11 o'clock in the evening when I checked in. A takeaway guy told the front desk in Sichuan dialect, and the front desk asked him to take the elevator himself.

When the customer is not in the hotel, open the slippers to the side of the bed and clean up the garbage. Then, the point is! Put a bottle of expensive mineral water on the head of the bed and put it together with the free mineral water, which caused customers to think that it was free, so if you drink it directly, the fee will be deducted...If you stay in the hotel in the future, please pay special attention! This service is not available in Shanghai anyway... If someone enters and steals in the name of this service, it is not clear afterwards!
