msg:The room was classic style.Cousy and at the same time elegant. Beautiful and spacious room. The bath tub is the best I have seen in a while!. Gymnasium 24 hrs and a very nice indoor pool, open the whole day!!!! Service is fantastic. From the beginning we got a warm welcome from Gary at the front desk and later from Katherine. I am impressed by their English skills and their wonderful actitud. We enjoyed the Italian restaurant. Service was outstanding. 5 stars. Best service and comfort. Thanks so much!                                             这个房间是古典风格的。端庄的同时又优雅。漂亮宽敞的房间。浴缸是我一段时间以来见过的最好的！。健身房24小时开放，还有一个非常漂亮的室内游泳池，全天开放！！！！服务非常棒。从一开始，我们就受到了前台加里和凯瑟琳的热烈欢迎。他们的英语技能和出色的活动给我留下了深刻的印象。我们很喜欢这家意大利餐厅。服务很出色。5颗星。最好的服务和舒适度。非常感谢！

msg:My wife and I stayed for 2 nights from March 30, 2024 to April 1, 2024. 
This hotel is rated 5-stars and I think it is appropriate. A truly 5-stars hotel.
From the moment we walked into the front lobby, checked in at the front desk and opened the door to our room, it was a happy "feel good" experience.
The room was clean and spacious. It comes with executive style rosewood furniture. A very big desk to use my laptop. The bathroom is big, comes with both a bathtub and shower stall. (See attached pictures)
It has a security safe. Lots of closet space and drawers to unload our clothings. The buffet breakfast was very good, lots of selection, has Chinese Style and some western style breakfast.

A special mention of front desk staff, Oded Hu who has gone the extra mile to assist me to all my needs.
He knows that I am from Hong Kong and cannot understand Mandarin. He tried his best to use Cantonese to assist me.
He informed me all the potential good restaurants aound the Hotel for lunch and dinner.
He provided a map and direct me to all the attractions to see around shenzhen.
He showed me how to navigate the Metro subway lines to get around the city.
I mentioned that I couldn't access google map (which I am familiar in Hong Kong), WhatsApp and Gmail.
He then put me on a hotel floor which has Vpn, and this enble me to get in touch with all my friends and relatives, and update my Facebook.
This is truly excellent customer service.  
Thank You.

msg:Great location with lots to do within walking distance. There is a great little craft brewery right across the street (Richcraft) and a bbq place with a nice patio just down the road. If you don't have too much luggage, you can even walk from Luohu port exit. It is a busy area and you will hear some horns, but some white noise will drown that out. 

The pictures of the room are for a jacuzzi room as the hotel was kind enough to upgrade me. The rooms are a bit old but the furniture is in great shape so it is a very comfortable stay. A little disappointing that the television is not viewable from the bed though. Breakfast is good and there are western and chinese options. Sadly I never got the chance to try the pool. 

The only issue I had was during check in. The initial room had an issue with the hot water for the overhead shower which I discovered when taking a shower. I was switched to a new room but it smelled of cigarette smoke. I was then given a third room but it needed to be cleaned. I went out to run an errand and when I came back, the person who I had initially spoken with had gone out for dinner and no instructions were left about the room. I was given a fourth room but when I went to inspect it, it was a different style. When I went back to the lobby, there must have been communication about the third room as it was then arranged for me and everything was fine. The stay was then very comfortable but it was initially quite frustrating that I had to repack my luggage and go through four rooms. 

The final note is the room came with a 100 yuan voucher for the restaurant but it was difficult to understand how to use it. I ended up not using it. There was a cafe/bar on the main floor. It would have been more convenient if the voucher could be used there.

Hotel is worth staying when prices are reasonable.

Katherine at the front desk was checking out other passengers at the time. When she saw us coming in, she immediately apologized and asked us to wait. Later, I heard that we were delayed at the airport for six hours. We checked in quickly and chose a quiet room for us to rest. The takeaway we ordered was also delivered to the room quickly. I just took two photos of the room. I don’t remember the decoration of the lobby clearly, but the room service was warm, especially the English of the girl Katherine at the front desk with a British accent, which was impressive, because the people who checked out before and after were all foreigners.

The room was very large and the bathroom was also very large. There were also children-themed toys, which the children loved very much. The hotel is not the latest, but the equipment, environment and cleanliness are all very satisfactory. Except for the toilet being clogged and I don't know if it is related to the carpet, the room has a very obvious smell and is relatively humid. I hope to book again next time.

If the mirror in the bathroom room is stuck, someone can be sent to the door immediately to deal with it. The breakfast the next day was also excellent, with many choices. There was no one in the swimming pool. When I took my children there, there were still no lifeguards on duty at about 9:30am. They didn't come until about 10.

There was a little yellow duck on the second night. The duck theme room was freed up and they changed it to a little yellow duck theme for us. The room is very big.

msg:I had stayed at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Yunnan before and had a good impression, so I booked the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Shenzhen again. However, I didn't expect that this hotel in Shenzhen was too old. The one in 2005 should have been very good at the time, but it is a bit outdated now. However, the service attitude of the front desk staff is very good. The handsome guy He Li took the initiative to help me upgrade the room to increase the area. There is a separate bathroom, just like a suite. The breakfast is okay, with a complete variety, but nothing particularly amazing. There is cheese 🧀, and there is also a whole grain pancake that is also appetizing.

msg:I temporarily stayed with my family at Crowne Plaza, a hotel owned by InterContinental, for one night. First of all, the location of this hotel is very good. It is located in the city center and is very convenient to go anywhere! Dongmen Old Street is near this hotel, less than a five-minute walk away from Luohu Crossing. Very close too. It took ten minutes to take a taxi. The service quality is also very good, especially the concierge Xiao Rong’s service is great! There is also a complete gym and swimming pool. There is a chance to continue to stay!
There was also an incident. Because the child suddenly had a nosebleed, we had already checked out at 2 o'clock. The manager called us to greet us and gave us two more hours of rest. He was very considerate. I am very grateful to them for helping to deal with it and providing drinking water for the child. Medicine, very considerate, thank them ❤️
There are some stains on the bathtub, but I prepared a bathtub cover, so it doesn't affect it.

The heated swimming pool is a highlight and benefit for those who love swimming. More importantly, the soft power of this established five-star hotel is also worthy of praise. It can be said responsibly that all employees of the hotel, from greeting guests at the door, checking in at the front desk, concierge, restaurant supervisors and waiters, cleaning staff, gym, pool lifeguards, etc., everyone is very dedicated, professional and warm in welcoming all countries. guest. I feel that the employees working here are very happy no matter what their position is. I guess the hotel must have a very good leader. Thanks again to Larry at the front desk, Ms. Zhang, the supervisor of the breakfast buffet, several boys and girls in the gym who I can’t name, the boy at the front desk who helped me upgrade my room on the day of check-in, the boy waiter at the Italian restaurant, and even the sincere smiles I met on the aisle.

This time the lady at the front desk helped me upgrade from a junior suite to a suite on the executive floor, which is a higher floor. I forgot her name. I'm sorry. Because I was slightly hypoglycemic that day, the lady arranged for fruit to be delivered to my room. I ate two bananas and stabilized my condition.
After checking out, I still had to wait for an hour before leaving, so I asked the front desk where the coffee shop was. Mr. Oded Hu arranged a drink coupon, which allowed me to go to the bar for tea, coffee, etc. I was just drinking coffee and doing writing work, which was very pleasant.
I highly recommend Fuyuan. The hardware is excellent and the staff are friendly and proactive in helping people solve problems👍. I will come back if I have the opportunity.

Thank you very much for upgrading my room. I will stay at this hotel again. He also gave me breakfast, just for the room. The lighting is not very good. I hope the room can be improved next time. There is no table for guests to eat. I hope the hotel can improve it and add more facilities in the room for guests to use. Also add a welcome fruit plate to attract more customers and increase the occupancy rate. .

msg:This hotel took a long time to build, so I was a little hesitant about booking because I was afraid of getting into trouble. After checking in, I felt very comfortable. Except for the carpet showing some signs of age, everything else in the room was very clean. The heated swimming pool, breakfast, and room service are all great. The service staff are professional and attentive. I went with my children and they took good care of me while I was going swimming and changing clothes. The breakfast was very rich. If you are a big eater, there will be service staff to help you collect your plates during the meal and will not let you down. You are embarrassed because the table is full of dishes; although the reception counter has a sense of age, the people behind the counter are indeed well-trained handsome men and women. The overall quality is worthy of five-star standards. I will go there again next time.

msg:I took my parents with me on this trip, and the whole family was very satisfied from the moment we got off the bus. Whether it was a trip or a business trip, many doormen at five-star hotels have been very perfunctory about picking up luggage. The luggage uncle at Landmark Crown Super enthusiastic, he worked harder to help us get our luggage from the car than the bellboys who are tipped abroad. Every time we took a taxi back to the hotel, he would ask if we had any luggage to pick up. Thank you again! The receptionist who received us that day was Liu Yang. The little brother was professional and polite. He helped arrange adjacent rooms and upgraded them so that I could take care of my parents. He could have guided us in the direction of the elevator with his hands, but Liu Yang personally took us to the elevator. between. With these great staff, this stay was a great experience! I also like the brand of hotel toiletries. I will definitely stay here again when I come to Shenzhen!

msg:We impromptuly booked a hotel and left on the same day on Sunday afternoon. We arrived around 9pm. When we checked in, they upgraded us two levels to an executive suite. The room was larger and still had a king-sized double bed. It's rare that children's toothbrushes and bath salts are also provided, which is very happy. It would be better if children's slippers and shower caps are provided for bathing. The reservation includes a buffet breakfast for 2 people. Since children under 120cm can enjoy it for free, the meal time is 6:30-10:00, and the food is good. When you go to the restaurant on the third floor to dine, there is basically no reception. You have to find a seat by yourself. I didn't check out until noon, and I had to queue up to check out.
In addition, I would like to specially recommend that the food delivery robot be smarter. After we checked in and got on the elevator, a food delivery robot entered the elevator on the halfway floor. It was right in the middle, blocking our suitcases and strollers from getting out of the elevator. It was very difficult. trouble.

I took the subway from Hong Kong at 3:30, and arrived at the hotel at 6:00. The main thing is speed. Because I had communicated with the hotel manager Melody in advance, the room card registration form was ready when I arrived at the front desk, and I signed and swiped the card to scan my face. The formalities were completed in less than 2 minutes, and I took the card to go upstairs. The room is delivered with fruit drinks specially prepared by the hotel and an environmentally friendly amenity bag, which contains commonly used toothbrush, toothpaste and combs. It is introduced that this is the "Green Stay" project of the InterContinental Group. Luggage delivered to the hotel in advance has also been sent to the room. According to reports, the carpet in this room has just been washed, and there is a fresh smell of detergent, and the room feels much brighter. Booked a superior room, paid a very cheap fee at the front desk, and paid to upgrade to a suite. The layout of the suite is very wonderful. It is not a separate room, but it is very large. According to the introduction, the area is 64 square meters. The living room is very spacious. There is a sofa and coffee table at the end of the 2-meter-large bed, facing the TV. It is suitable for eating and drinking while lying down. Relax and relax. The environment of the indoor swimming pool on the fourth floor is very comfortable. When I arrived, I was the only one in the whole swimming pool. The water quality was crystal clear. I swam briskly for an hour and went back to take a bath and rest. The water pressure and water temperature are all in a comfortable state. On WeChat, I received the electronic invoice from Melody, the account number of the member who was invited to register, and the reminders about the opening time and location of each business point of the hotel, which is considerate and meticulous. The surrounding area of ​​the hotel is very lively, meeting all needs for shopping, eating and having fun. The hotel's breakfast is also rich and delicious.

【Exclusive Memory】
"The elevator in Fuyuan CP does not need to swipe the room card, which is still very rare in the InterContinental hotels in Shenzhen." 
Among the five Crowne Plazas in Pengcheng, this one has the slowest internet speed (in fact, CP’s internet speed is not fast at Good Days), but it is still enough for basic office work. The hotel opened earlier, with a strong European court style. I don’t know if I thought I was in Austria, a bit like Beijing Legend.

【Guest room snapshot】
"The hair dryer is a "Sassoon" professional hairdresser. In the early days without Dyson, Sassoon was a god-like existence. More than ten years ago, when I was still a model, I also served as the queen model for Sassoon's annual release. Mr. Chen Meibao It is an unforgettable memory to do my hair with a group of European stylists (there is a fat British female teacher, which is still fresh in my memory).
The door panel of the guest room is very thin, without that sense of thickness and security, but the sound insulation effect is still sufficient. There will always be a "dong dong dong" sound from the drainage of the bathroom, and it always feels like Aladdin's magic lamp is coming, haha.

【Brief introduction to the public area】
"The treadmill area of ​​the gym is particularly easy to kowtow, everyone must pay attention." 
Because the entire fitness floor is integrated with the SPA, when you get out of the elevator, you will feel like entering a certain club. People who come here for the first time may be shocked, haha. Among the 17 brands under the InterContinental Group, the three brands of Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn Express and Holiday Inn Express are the most suitable for one person to stay on a business trip. Coincidentally, these three brands have exclusive suite hotels. There are many Holiday Inn Express and Suites hotels in the United States, and there is only one in Yading in China. Some other Holiday Inn Express have suites, and some do not, but the name is called Suite HIX, only Daocheng; there are many Holiday Inn Express and Suites in China, such as Nanjing Shangqinhuai, Langfang Xinchaoyang, Tianjin Rongqiao, etc.; there is only one Crowne Plaza suite in China, and this is Fuyuan.

【Breakfast overview】
"Breakfast is very good, a special area for members is set up, and the privacy is very good."  
Breakfast is on the third floor, with an outdoor garden area. Preserved egg and lean meat porridge uses solid ingredients, and the freshly squeezed juices in the member area include watermelon juice and cucumber juice.

【Member Privileges】
"No administrative trea**ent, no 90 yuan meal coupon, no suite upgrade, and welcome drink coupon." 
It was upgraded to a large studio that is slightly larger than the standard room. Of course, in order to sell better, they gave this room type a rather bluffing name on OTA: open suite. The material of the iced coffee cup for the welcome drink is still good, similar to Crowne Plaza on a good day.

【Replenish missing points】
"There are many foreign guests in the hotel, and the location is very good. It is very convenient to go to Hong Kong." 
Each floor of the hotel has 4 small basic rooms, 7 medium-sized large studios (the one I live in), and 4 truly large suites. There is a trouser press in the room, which is suitable for business guests.

msg:I took my parents to relax in the mainland and chose the Fuyuan Crowne Plaza Hotel and Suites. The hotel is very close to Luohu Port, and you can get there at the starting price of a taxi. We booked a Unicom suite, and it was less than 12 o'clock when we arrived at the front desk, and Ctrip marked the check-in time as 15:00. The manager Melody at the front desk saw that our family was traveling together, and kindly helped us arrange early check-in. My mother has inconvenient legs and feet, and she took good care of herself when taking pictures at the front desk. She didn't let her get up and adjusted the position of the camera while sitting in a wheelchair. Manager Melody carefully introduced the features of the room and the surrounding area of ​​the hotel. She gave a 100 yuan cash coupon for the Chinese restaurant. I ate at the restaurant on the second floor at noon. The service and taste were very good. After the meal, the room is ready, go back to the room to rest. The two rooms are interconnected, large and spacious, and the room facilities are well equipped. The hotel responds to Shenzhen's environmental protection policy. The room is not equipped with disposable items. The toiletries and quilts required when checking in have been delivered to the room. Because there is no need to use the play coupons of the parent-child restaurant, Melody sent fruit to the room, but if it was not delivered, I contacted Melody, and it was delivered soon. Seeing the introduction of Yuan SPA in the elevator, I learned that it is on the 4th floor, and went to experience it separately in the afternoon. The service and environment of the SPA are very good, and it is very comfortable after trea**ent. The breakfast was also very rich, and the family enjoyed it very much. Wanting to delay check-out until 2:00, Melody introduced IHG's membership program, registered members for free and provided late check-out until 2:00, and we were able to have a good rest. This trip to Shenzhen was very comfortable and I strongly recommend everyone to stay here.

Facilities: There is an indoor swimming pool on the 4th floor. There are not many people swimming, so you are not afraid of a group of people crowding into a swimming pool.

Overall, it's pretty good. I recommend everyone to stay here.

msg:Booked a twin-bed suite (open plan), the bed is larger than the ordinary room, suitable for three people, but this type of room is all located near the lift entrance, if you mind, do not recommend this room type. The good news is that it has good sound insulation. It is 5 minutes away from Guomao Station, and Luohu is just one station away. There is also Jinguanghua Plaza nearby, where you can eat wild food. There are many delicious foods around, and there is even a night market. Although he notes that he will not take the initiative to provide disposable products, he will actually provide them. The hotel facilities are relatively old, and the security is not enough. You can go up to the room floor without washing your card, but the room is so big that you can meet your needs. You can sleep comfortably. There are even pillows to choose from. There are showers and bathtubs. . It's a pity that I had a bad impression when I came in. The attitude of the waiters is really not good. It's just a room card, but they don't even tell you what time the check-out time is... and they don't smile 🙂️Except When I checked out on the left, I saw a female manager who was enthusiastic, but the rest of the people were so dull😅

P.S. The decorations are installed by yourself and will be dismantled later🙏🏻🙏🏻

msg:A building standing in the center of Luohu, directly opposite the China World Trade Center, can be seen for some years, but the glory of that year is still faintly visible. Arrived at the hotel around 6 pm on Sunday, my friend's car drove straight to the entrance of the lobby, and a staff member came up to open the door. The air conditioner in the lobby is well equipped, and the air is filled with the unique aroma of the Crown brand. There were not many guests at that time, and it was very quiet, which is the hotel a**osphere I like. The front desk staff is very professional. I originally wanted to change to a twin room. The front desk readily agreed, but I also reminded that because it was the first time I checked in, the manager Melody specially gave me a free upgrade. I originally booked a double bed. The room has been prepared in advance, and it is decided not to change it now. The guest room floor is in the elevator hall, so there is a very clear sign, which clearly points to the direction of the room, and there is even a special elevator to the swimming pool and fitness center, which is very detailed. The arranged room is very large, with fruits, cards and bedding arranged, and I feel that I have been taken special care of. The overall feeling of the room is ancient and classic European style. The floor-to-ceiling wooden wardrobe and dressing table are rarely seen in the current decoration. The room is even equipped with a trouser press, which is a favorite of business people. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, the shower and bathtub are independent, and the shower is even equipped with a bath stool. There are promotional materials for green occupancy on the sink, and the bath liquid and the like are all in large bottles, which are in line with the current environmental protection concept and are easy to use. The breakfast room is not very big, but fortunately, there are not too many people. The products are both Chinese and Western, and the taste is not bad. The service in the restaurant is orderly. In a location like Luohu, there is even a small outdoor garden. There are foreigners wearing glasses sitting on the balcony and reading newspapers. The weather is good today and you can see the clear sky. Everything went smoothly during check-out. The invoice was quickly issued and the bill was processed. The drink coupons given during check-in were useless. The staff offered to offer drinks at the front desk that could be taken away. The catering around the hotel is very developed. There are various shops along the street. In the evening, at the Japanese food store next door, it is very happy to eat, and it is within walking distance. The two buildings look like the streets of Hong Kong, with strong fireworks. Summary: An old five-star hotel with well-equipped facilities and a classic decoration style. If you are looking for a modern feel, you need to choose carefully. The transportation is convenient, and all kinds of food and leisure facilities are complete in the surrounding area. The enthusiasm and professionalism of the staff in the hotel are worthy of recognition, and the price performance ratio is very high. The recommendation index is five stars.

msg:On a business trip to Shenzhen, a friend recommended this crown. It is said that the hotel has been in business for some years, and it has a Hong Kong style. It was already night when we arrived at the hotel, and we could see the hotel's shop signs standing out among the buildings from afar. When I arrived at the hotel entrance, I ran into the big security guard who dragged a suitcase from the car in front, and he didn't forget to look up and say hello. As soon as you enter the door, there is a very fresh aroma. The air conditioner is fully turned on, which is in stark contrast to the hot and humid weather outside, and the irritable mood is instantly relieved. There are not many people at night, and there are only two waiters at the front desk, typing on the computer meticulously. Fortunately, there are chairs, so it is leisurely to sit and wait. When I arrived, the front desk apologized very politely and said that I had been waiting for a long time. I was a little embarrassed to be polite. It seems that there are some things in the IHG hotel. The check-in process went smoothly. The front desk said that the manager had arranged the rooms in advance, and introduced the opening hours of the hotel's business premises in detail, and the members. They gave an email address, joined for free, and received a drink coupon. It's on the first floor The bar changed to a cup of coffee, flattered. The guest rooms of the hotel are very clean. The furniture can be seen to be old. The big wardrobe against the wall is heavy and heavy. It must have cost a lot of money back then. The bathroom is spacious, separated from wet and dry, with complete showers and bathtubs. It was also very quiet at night and had a good night's sleep. Give a good review, thanks to every staff member for their warm service during the stay, and thanks to Manager Melody for the specially prepared room. I enjoyed the express check-in and check-out service, and I feel taken care of. I wish the hotel better and better.

Construction took place between 3 and 4 in the afternoon, and after 9 in the morning. The premise was not informed. I called the front desk to complain and couldn't explain clearly.

This may be the background of the old hotel.
But the placement of the room and the bed is a bit strange. Why not put it in the direction of the bedside lamp?

I talked to the lady in the lobby about the situation, and it was resolved within half an hour. . Give us your money and give the hotel a big thumbs up. We booked this room type and got an afternoon tea as a gift. Because we took the children out to play, we called the hotel temporarily, hoping to reserve some snacks for fear that the children would be hungry when they come back. The lady in the lobby said they could arrange it. Tell her when we get back and she sends us to the room. After staying for 4 days and 3 nights, there are still many small touches like this. All in all, we had a very happy time this Spring Festival. Thanks to the hotel for providing us with considerate service during the Spring Festival. Recommend to all friends to experience it too.

I felt very happy at the time. I thanked them and the door was still open when we went up. It couldn't be opened. I went down and printed the card again and it still couldn't be opened ~ We asked to change a room, and the hotel staff told me that this was the last room. I asked where my original room was and was told that it would be given to someone else! I really don’t agree with this approach

1. Check-in was very slow, the attitude was very good, and the system felt like it was from the last century.
2. The light in the first room was broken. When I came back at night, I found that it was not working. I asked a technician to repair it. It felt unprofessional and could not be repaired. The attitude was very good. I changed the room and upgraded it to a larger room.
3. When I walked into the second room, there was such a strong musty smell that I couldn't stand it even with a mask on. The attitude was very good. I waited a little longer and didn't come back. I couldn't stay in the room. The smell was really strong.
4. The third room still has a smell, which is better. Forget it. I have been struggling for almost an hour. Let’s take a deodorizing spray and add an air purifier. To be honest, it’s an old hotel with low floors. Tasteful.
The surroundings are okay, the city center, the breakfast is average, not many varieties, the coffee is okay.

The room of the hotel is very large, and the bathroom can satisfy the hobbies of bathing and showering at the same time. The style of the hotel belongs to the European retro style. It is very exotic.
Happy time is always short 🥹😘😘 Because we went out to the beach and got carried away, it was 6 o'clock when we returned to the hotel and checked out, and we were prepared to pay the overtime check-out fee. But I didn't think that the manager of front desk Tian saw that it was our first time to stay in the hotel. He was very humane and helped us to exempt the late check-out fee for our special application. She first explained the hotel's check-out rules to me very politely and professionally, and then she was very understanding and helped us solve the problem. As a little white who has just started to be a trapeze, I am very happy and like this kind of hotel service and attitude.
Thank you very much, Ms. Tian Fengqin, the lobby manager of your hotel, and 11.5-11.7: the front desk staff on duty, the aunt in the room, your service experience is like being at home~
Also, your breakfast format is also very good. As a person with difficulty in choosing, I like it very much. I also thank the little brothers and sisters in the restaurant~

msg:The worst experience of staying in a hotel. 1. On the day of check-in, the front desk still arranged a room on the floor for renovation work even though it knew that there would be continuous renovation. 2. The decoration work was carried out without any notice, and the decoration was not suspended after the complaint. The room could only be changed without waking up, which seriously affected the normal check-in and rest. 3. On the morning after check-in, the staff knocked on the door to deliver water while the Do Not Disturb light was on. At that time, the staff admitted that they had gone to the wrong room. Later, after communicating with the hotel manager on duty, the staff actually lied and said that the Do Not Disturb light was not on at that time. 4. On the afternoon of the third day of check-in, no one answered the guest service center, guest service, room service and even emergency services within half an hour, but calls to the landline from the mobile phone were answered within seconds. The hotel is cheap, but it is a star hotel after all. It does not require good service, but it cannot even guarantee a normal stay.

msg:Very bad hotel, very bad customer service, very bad general manager of a five-star hotel!

To stay in this hotel is to go to jail, to go to jail. The hotel manager refused to communicate under the condition of repeated requests for communication by the guests, citing epidemic prevention. It was clearly stated that the hotel and the guests "did not discuss" and insisted on calling the police, insisting on asking the police to arrest the guests in iron cage police cars at midnight for a record.

When the police made it clear that there was no problem, they continued to make trouble unreasonably, pestered the police, and repeatedly demanded measures to be taken against the guests. After being severely refused by the police, the guests paid a taxi to return to the hotel by themselves. It was around two in the morning. Because the hotel was sent to the police station at night, the guests stayed up all night, which seriously affected the work the next day.

Afterwards, the hotel had no remorse and no apology. In the case of repeated applications and requests from the guests to communicate with the general manager, the general manager of the hotel still adheres to the hotel's consistent style: continuous evasion, refusal to communicate, no communication with guests, and "no negotiation" with guests for applications that require communication from guests .

To this day, there is neither apology nor apology; neither phone calls nor appearances. Just ask, what kind of management accident is a five-star hotel sending guests to the police station late at night for no reason, should the general manager bow and apologize?

Unexpectedly, the hotel said that its general manager could not meet because of vacation! The first wait turned out to be four days, and it has been three days since the end of the November holiday. Is the general manager of this hotel still on vacation? Eleven is the busiest time in the service industry. The general manager of the hotel actually asked interns and newcomers to receive guests, and asked the customer service manager, who was fiercer than the security guard, to send the guests to the police station late at night, but he did not see or communicate with customers. on vacation.

Excuse me, the general manager of a five-star hotel does not communicate with customers, does not deal with service accidents within his jurisdiction, does not meet with customers, does not communicate with customers, does not accept customer requests for communication, and "doesn't negotiate" with customers. What do you usually do?

In addition, the customer complaint depar**ent does not follow up. Do you want to delay the processing until the customer leaves Shenzhen? In addition, this hotel is basically a reception for interns and newcomers at night. To put it bluntly, the service is not as good as the Samsung hotel, and the front desk is more fierce than the security.

I also strongly complain about IHG's membership system.
As an elite member of IHG's Diamond Card, just because I booked on Ctrip, I was declared by the front desk of the hotel: not enjoying any member trea**ent, it is simply an insult, and it is simply vexatious. You don't have the ability to sell the house yourself, so let Ctrip help you sell it, and the guest buys your room, but you have to calculate the trea**ent with the guest? Is this a five star hotel?

Plus, IHG's Diamond Elite members ask to see the hotel's general manager. Is it that hard? Isn't it more difficult for ordinary customers to be wronged?

As the highest-level member of IHG, can you be sent to the police station in the middle of the night to make trouble, and have to take a taxi back to the hotel by yourself at two in the morning? If you can't see the general manager of the hotel, what kind of courtesy is an IHG member?

msg:First of all, I personally feel that some services are really average
It’s a bit disappointed that I can’t order delivery at 9:30 in the evening, so I can only buy it downstairs.
Before I checked out in the morning, I wanted to take away the small snacks I bought last night. I found that other hotels in the Crowne Plaza Hotel have that kind of paper bags. This hotel does not have the kind of plastic bags that are as big as thieves. A paper bag told me that I didn’t have it. Okay. Then I asked him to help me ask if there is any restaurant or food delivery, but I waited for an hour and didn’t reply whether I did or did it. I was a bit disappointed. Finally, I could only throw away those snacks.
At three or four o'clock in the evening, the sound insulation is a bit poor next door or upstairs

msg:我們是住在家庭通聯房的，地方很大， 雖然房間比較舊 ，但裝修十分精緻的 ，我們都住得很舒服。酒店的位置就在東門旁邊，行過去就是幾分鐘左右，十分方便。另外五分鐘就到金光華廣場，位置來說，真是沒得輸了。酒店的早餐十分豐富，有中式的也有西式的， 味道很好，我們都很滿意，只是酒店早餐平日只到十點鐘，要吃早餐的就要做一點起床了。

首先酒店地理位置很好，在市中心附近就是東門老街已經金光華廣場，吃的東西也很多，斜對面燒臘好吃。
辦入住的前台linda小曾很親切，也很禮貌。安排了一間很大的房間。房間衞生整潔乾淨。很不錯。
服務友善，水壺線遺失了，也幫忙快遞回來。
下次再來深圳出差會再次繼續入住此酒店。

親子房預訂套餐裏面還含了雙人早餐。早餐在3樓的啤酒屋用餐，自助餐模式，早餐的規模還是挺大，人也比較多，到員工的服務態度還是不錯。
整個酒店區域都乾淨整潔，隨時看到清潔阿姨在打掃衞生。服務員都會主動打招呼。酒店裡羅湖口岸很近，打車10分鐘，地鐵僅一個站就到達。總體來説不錯的一次入住體驗！

入住時由大堂經理Patrick協助辦理手續，因有需要，他特意為我們延遲退房時間至13:00。工作態度認真及處事迅速，對客人十分和藹，值得稱讚。且於Patrick帶領下，另一位大堂職員Linda辦理退房手續時亦非常快速，工作態度誠懇。
房間頗整潔寬敞及床品乾淨，企缸及浴缸去水十分順暢。
健身房有各顃型的器械，惟游泳池面積較小，未能供太多客人同時間使用。

門口負責接待的職員也是很幫忙，每次出去和回來的時候，他總是會幫忙看看我們約的車在哪，協助我們上下車，太周到了。

msg:在深圳旅遊，選擇在富苑皇冠假日套房酒店入住了兩個晚上。首先説早餐，早餐水平一般，需要做出改進。其次是房間，房間總體來看還不錯。抵店前是Celine先提前跟我電話聯繫，確認我的抵店時間，提前安排好房間，她還非常貼心的給我發送酒店定位，讓我一鍵到店的路線，方便出行。住店期間她也詢問我的體驗，隨時為我做出來調整。滿意的一次入住體驗

雖然住店期間遇到深圳大雨，大水，但是看到酒店員工通宵，積極搶險，保障客人的生命和財產，也是一種安慰。

房間很大，有足夠的空間給小孩子們玩，有個小圓桌，很方便，叫外賣也有地方吃飯。
樓層服務員也很好，空調冷，叫加個被子，也很快送來房間了。
入住後，辣辣小姐主動詢問，住房感覺，感覺到還是很貼心，下次去深圳還是會選擇富苑皇冠假日套房酒店。

4.管理或設備老吧？前台服務很好，辦理慢

6.國內其他酒店同款房型設計，小包等是送，這裏不送且不標註不完善！

我想酒店是在借為客人負責的名義 滿足監控偷窺的慾望 滿足人性偷窺別人私隱的慾望 
全國各地 全世界都住過好酒店 頭一次遇到這個情況 
另外酒店電話有時候怎麼打也打不通 感覺不太像是五星級酒店 儘管酒店名氣還可以

A última vez foi uma gerente, que em vez de indicar ao táxi a fronteira mais perto como pedimos, mandou-nos para os barcos. Dificultando a viagem. Péssimo, Péssimo. Muito má experiência
Além de quase ninguém falar inglês, nem cantonense. Muito mau.

酒店周圍非常多吃喝玩樂的地方，特別方便。
退房後接到酒店電話問三件浴袍放哪裡了，估計是擔心我們誤拿了，解釋説補送三件乾淨浴袍的時候，已經讓服務人員把濕的順便帶走。
建議：1.既然補送房間物品有登記，取走房間物品也應該及時清點，以免引起誤會。
2.既然問了我們，結果最好給個反饋，否則我今天還在惦記這事兒。也不想自己被誤會。
小插曲，不影響其他方面的滿意度，推薦
