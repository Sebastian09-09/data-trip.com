msg:It takes about 40 minutes to drive from Raoping. The road is very easy to drive along the way. I always like the purpose of parent-child walks close to nature! Usually I go to some relatively far places and rush back and forth all day. The baby is tired, and the adults are tired too.
And I basically work from Monday to Saturday, facing the computer every day. The baby rarely goes out to play. There is such a hotel with green mountains and green waters, which is convenient for us to live. It's really good! ! 
There is a children's playground inside, and the baby can also play by himself~
There is also a gym, which can straighten my waist that works every day~ A large garden, the baby likes this grass very much and has a lot of fun. Strolling in the woods, enjoying the rockery and flowing water. There are goldfish in the clear water, feeling the long-lost freshness and joy, and the green plants and wildness are the best...
Slow life weekend, really love it! ! 
There is also a leisure area outside the room, where adults can drink tea and chat. Children play and take pictures! 
Very slow pace, very comfortable. Just walk around and find a lakeside grass area to enjoy the breeze~
You don't have to worry about wasting battery when taking photos while traveling. If you want to go back and rest, just walk a few steps upstairs. From the living room window of the hotel room, you can see a whole piece of beautiful scenery.
Travel guide around Chaozhou, this week was really fulfilling

The hotel opened this year. The rooms are large and very new. Basically, there are all the necessary items, and the service is also responsive. In addition to breakfast, it also provides guests with supper. It is a pity that I did not taste it myself.
The hotel has complete functional facilities, including a gym, laundry room, outdoor swimming pool, and outdoor green landscape. There is a free shuttle bus to the most lively Paifang Street at 9 o'clock every day. Although I went there early in the evening, I did not take it. But at least the hotel has such thoughtful and distinctive services. I believe that the hotel will be full of guests and business will be booming in the future! I will visit again if I have the opportunity in the future.

msg:.
It was a wonderful stay! 😊😊

.

It takes 45 minutes to reach the hotel from Shantou! ! !

.
Location:
The hotel is located in the center of Chaozhou, a famous historical and cultural city.
It has to be said that the location is great.
It only takes 10 minutes to drive to Guangji Bridge, Paifang Street, Kaiyuan Temple and other attractions! 👍

.
Service:

The hotel learned that we were traveling with children,
and immediately arranged a large and spacious family room for us🏠

After checking in, the front desk saw that we were with two or three children,
and took the initiative to help push the luggage and took us all the way to the room! ♥️

The front desk's affinity for guests gave us a feeling of being at home!

.
Environmental facilities:
The entire manor covers an area of ​​more than 20,000 square meters,
and it is the first comprehensive high-end hotel in Chaoshan that integrates art and cultural experience.
.
There is an art exhibition hall in the manor,
which displays many works of masters of craftsmanship, as well as high-end golden nanmu and small-leaf red sandalwood furniture. The most impressive thing is the thousand-year-old red sandalwood on both sides of the lobby. The bird pictures carved on it are really lifelike, and there are various high-end porcelain crafts that are really pleasing to the eye!

.
I had the opportunity to visit the bedroom of the hotel owner-Dinghong Pavilion!
It is not an exaggeration to describe it as "luxury"
The furniture in the whole room totaled 15 million, and the bed was worth tens of millions🤣
Poverty really limits my imagination😅

.

The green coverage rate of the back garden of the manor is 99%, and the scenery is comparable to that of a park!

The garden has a Su-style landscape architecture.
There are a group of koi in the pond.
In addition, there are a group of fat pigeons.
I originally wanted to walk around and leave,
but the children couldn't move their legs at all🤣

.
The hotel provides a rich breakfast and supper,
so you can have a bowl of hot beef rice noodles supper after you come back from the trip, which is really👍👍
.
Here I have to mention that the hotel's bedding is very skin-friendly. When you go out, you can fall asleep as soon as you lie down. I hope you can have it🥳

.
Overall:
The manor is big enough for us to mess around all day,

The accommodation also meets my expectations for traveling to this ancient city

The service is very considerate, and I sent good night fruit. The staff are very kind.
The B&B also has a small manor where you can fish and pick vegetables. The housekeeper Ding also picked small persimmons for us very enthusiastically. Gym, executive lounge, and laundry room are all equipped.

msg:Take advantage of your birthday to go on a spontaneous trip. After a long time of selection, I chose this hotel with a large garden-style courtyard for taking photos and Chinese-style decoration.
Location: The hotel is located on East Avenue, about 10 minutes' drive from the old city. Suitable for self-driving. And there is basically no traffic jam here on holidays, and there is no need to worry about parking. (The hotel has a large parking lot)
Check-in: The check-in front desk is very considerate. In addition to preparing various daily necessities, there are also pokers and even makeup remover. The level of considerateness is 5 🌟. After checking in, the housekeeper will help you carry your luggage and then send you to the room. Great!
Room: The room is very complete, and there are high and low pillows to choose from.
There is a mini bar with milk, yogurt, drinks, and probiotics, all of which can be enjoyed for free. What surprised me was that it actually has laundry detergent, a small bottle! So considerate! It can be said that although the sparrow is small, it has everything. For a detail control like me, I really love it.
Public environment: There is a large courtyard at the back, with rockery, pavilions, streams, koi, and little white pigeons. This is my favorite. It is really easy to take photos. It satisfies my desire to take beautiful photos. Photos can be added to the next article.
The hotel also has a private museum of the owner. It is full of exhibits that the owner has obtained from auctions. There are many exhibits of small-leaf red sandalwood, and the nearly thousand-year-old Yinchen wood has reached the level of petrification. The price can no longer be measured in numbers.
In the corridor of the restaurant, we also found the largest golden nanmu Yinchen ***** in China. It has a history of more than 2,000 years. 🤯
Food: Breakfast is a buffet with many categories. The time is 7:30-10:00
For supper, there are white porridge, eight-treasure porridge, rice noodle soup, etc. to choose from. The time is: 9:30-11:00
The executive restaurant is also free, the time is: 10:00
Afternoon tea time: 2:00-4:00
Hidden treasure box: The hotel also has a very high-end room type, which is said to be exclusive to the boss. It is not easily open to the public. It is full of luxury, with tens of millions of small-leaf red sandalwood Chinese furniture, Jao Zongyi's authentic works, and super high-end audio equipment... I was fortunate to visit it and it really shocked me.

When I arrived, I found that it was a very quiet and high-end manor. From the greenery to the hygiene to many small details, they were all great. They also gave welcome fruits and snacks upon check-in. Although the breakfast on the second day was not as rich as a five-star hotel, it was generally okay. I didn't eat much for breakfast. After breakfast, I went to the front desk to make an appoin**ent to see the museum. It was inside the hotel. It was probably the owner's private collection. The golden nanmu sunken wood opened my eyes. There are collections worth more than 20 million yuan🤭 Later I found out that there was a special car to take me to Paifang Street, but I didn't go there because of my own schedule. There was also a farm house experience to pick vegetables, but I didn't have time to go. Maybe next time. Hehe. When I checked out, I took away all the drinks in the small refrigerator because I asked the front desk and they said it was free. Hahaha, there was no extra charge for tea in the room. It was so touching. There is also a swimming pool and rockery waterfall koi behind the hotel. It's worth it.

Hygiene: The hotel is also relatively clean, and the towels are quite clean.

The design of the bathroom plug is very unreasonable, as shown in the picture, it is very difficult to plug and unplug.

There is no desk in the room, and there is no place to work. It needs to be improved.

The breakfast is too simple, and it is not a five-star hotel breakfast at all.

Overall, the hotel's surrounding environment is desolate, the hotel's interior decoration design is good, the room is at most three-star, and the breakfast can only be regarded as very poor.

msg:There are always some beautiful things that we will meet inadvertently. I booked this hotel with a nervous heart, worried whether I would make the wrong decision. When I walked into the hotel door, the remaining worries disappeared like haze seeing the sun. The enthusiastic staff and the beautiful gardens are refreshing. Lying on the sofa and enjoying the beautiful scenery outside the window seems to be all I have planned for this afternoon. The next day, I went to Paifang Street. The hotel thoughtfully arranged a business car to pick me up. I thought I could take a rest in the car, but I didn’t expect that I had arrived at my destination in a moment. This trip to Chaozhou really made me happy and forget to leave.

房間的設計同樣體現了潮汕文化的精髓。房間內部裝飾簡潔而不失雅緻，牆上掛着精美的油畫作品，既展示了地方特色，又增添了藝術氣息。床鋪舒適寬敞，床上用品乾淨柔軟，確保了良好的睡眠質量。推薦給所有來潮州的遊客，贊👍

瞭解才知道，這家是某公司大老闆自己給自己修的私人莊園，不以盈利為目的，酒店裡還有博物館個老闆得私藏寶貝。

整體性價比很高，值得入住，銷售人員月月很nice，態度非常好，解説詳細。

😊酒店是2024年開業的，整個格局呈莊園式建築，寬敞、大氣，由外而內沒有一絲令人不舒服的氣味。所以根本不需要擔心新店有甲醛之類的味道，不存在！

設施：入住的是3棟102（自己選的一樓），前台小李有主動告知房間沒有有償消費項目。
冰箱有可樂、七喜、牛奶、果汁都可以免費喝，還貼心配備了益生菌（避免吃生醃腸胃不好）、也有咖啡喝綠茶、功夫茶具（茶葉），有沒有很驚喜！

除此之外，你所需要的他們都配全了！如：洗衣液、雨傘。 還要誇一下的是衞浴系統：一秒鐘熱水～馬桶坐上去就熱，哈哈！總之細節之處盡顯完美～


環境：空曠、大氣、鬧中取靜、靜中是優雅。這種感受太棒了！

衞生：非常贊！挑不出毛病。

服務：入住當天是3.8節晚上10點多，辦理入住很順利（因為隨行家屬有外國人，所以是支持外國人入住哦）！還貼心告知了餐廳有免費宵夜，然後詢問了來潮汕幾天，他們還有農場……還送了一份“三八”糖果禮包到房間，哈哈～莫名就很驚喜呀！必須實名點贊帥哥小李！

😊 實在感覺住一晚不夠，也衹能留點遺憾下次再來～一定要去體驗一下他家的農場！

msg:哇感覺是最近住到最喜歡的酒店了 本來衹想在潮州待一晚然後去揭陽玩就住揭陽 直接飛回北京 但這家酒店真的很舒服 在一個莊園裡很安全 有門禁 停車位也很充足 每天都會送來歡迎水果和下午茶 管家可以隨時諮詢 問了很多吃喝玩樂的事情 房間有免費升房型 前後都有小院子 裝修是簡潔風 住起來很舒服 用的產品上面有logo 感覺老闆有心了 另外從體驗來講洗髮水應該是無硅油的 好好好好評 而且會有送益生菌和掛耳咖啡 冰箱裏有牛奶可以自製拿鐵 衹能説都市麗人狂喜了 而且每天晚上都有煙花秀 離店有送伴手禮 各方面服務細節真的很到位 農莊和藏館沒來得及參觀 下次來潮汕玩的話還準備住這邊 真的很省心又很舒服 推薦大家來！

5/2下午到達閤府莊園後，首先停車是真的方便，然後辦理完入住後有專人帶領來到房間，這個細節做的很好！

因潮州牌坊街、廣濟橋都屬於嚴管區，酒店有特別安排轉車送到景區附近，這點也要給酒店點贊；

印象最深刻的是司機小聰，載我們出去的時候有特地詢問我們要去哪？非常貼心的送到距離廣濟橋最近的下車點，下車後發現手機遺落在車上，經與前台聯絡很快反應手機在車上並且放在前台等我們回來在取！

最後再點贊下，閤府莊園每天都會有宵夜供入住客人食用，大晚上還炸油條……

一併再感謝下小聰，小丹，小豪，小珊，小玲，謝謝你們在我與家人入住期間的周到服務和細心安排！

環境真的長在我審美上，古色古香坐在後花園看美景喝下午茶也是種享受，給人帶來温馨治癒的視覺沖擊感，處處透着酒店的用心和品味真的好美，特別給力的是司機小洋！！！前台管家小劉和小林。
     亮點是這裡有老闆私藏博物館，名家字畫瓷板畫，還有小葉紫檀傢俱館。
