But Donghu Hotel is almost impeccable every time. Starting from the doorman, everything is very professional and warm. I would like to praise the doorman Wang Yuanyuan, who actually said that the service was great. Also, Manager Zhang in the lobby, the service was very timely and responsive.

If I must make a comment, it is the inherent defect in the hardware: the gym and swimming pool are both in Youxuan across the street.

The sunroom I chose was very spacious, the bathroom and toilet were separated, the hotel smelled great, the first round of drinks in the small refrigerator was free, and a small bar of soap was given as a gift. The only drawback was that the charging cable in the room was not of good quality and the iPhone could not be charged at all. It's better not to provide a usb port.
The food in the East Lake Hall on the first floor of the hotel is good. You can get discounts when staying in the hotel. Breakfast is self-service. Unfortunately, I didn’t notice until I checked out that I could order butterfly cakes. The advertisement was too inconspicuous.

After arriving at the hotel, we arranged a room for the elderly. Later, we felt that the work was done well👍Old bungalow, Equipped with a Koehler smart toilet, the old one is charming, but the equipment is not old👍The breakfast is quite satisfactory and tastes good. It's very close to Huaihai Road on foot. There's a FamilyMart nearby and across from Pi Ye Coffee, and there are some small shops to browse. All in all, I'm very satisfied. return.

The environment is first-class; the mansion has a Shanghai-style style, with a Western style, low-key luxury and connotation. The high bed and soft pillows in the room are very comfortable, and the bathroom is very comfortable;
The service is first-rate: takeaways can be delivered to the room by the front desk staff, which is very considerate; there is turndown service; there is also a set of cute gift boxes and welcome tea gifts for the New Year; the Chinese restaurant on the first floor serves authentic Shanghainese cuisine, which is very homely;
The price is beautiful: Although the price is a little higher than usual during the New Year period, it is well worth it to enjoy home-like service at a price of 1,300.

The service from the front desk to the concierge is also very nice. It is walking distance to Huaihai Middle Road and Jing'an Temple. The hotel facilities are not old at all.

msg:As the original site of Du Mansion, its geographical location and historical heritage go without saying. It is surrounded by the famous "rich and prosperous". Open Ctrip map to filter for five-star and above hotels here. It is the only choice. There is a private garden in such a location. I personally think it is much higher than Lujiazui. It is a scene in itself.

Although the room layout is quite satisfactory, as a five-star hotel in Shanghai, it can be said that the quality is absolutely online with a large number of wood veneer decorations, comfortable bedding, Dyson hair dryers, Ferragamo supplies, Chinese welcome refreshments, etc.

To be honest, the breakfast is at a normal five-star level, but the East Lake Hall Chinese Restaurant should be of a very high standard (I regret not going to experience it). However, in such a location, who wouldn’t walk nearby and order a fried dish, a bowl of stewed wontons, or walk into a beautifully decorated bistro to have a leisurely brunch to complement today’s day? A wonderful start to citywalk?

The service is definitely the highlight. As an old state-owned hotel, the service of Donghu Hotel is far better than that of overseas luxury brands. The enthusiasm and thoughtfulness are just right. We were upgraded to a suite when we checked in, which was an absolute surprise.

Hotels with similar style in Shanghai include Ruijin InterContinental, Jianyeli Capella, and Wukang Road Mansion (Mahler Villa personally feels a bit rough, so I won't include them). Their geographical location is the best in East Lake, and their garden design is unparalleled among other hotels in InterContinental. On the right, Capella’s croquettes are full. I think the positioning of Wukang Road Mansion is a bit awkward. If you want to be in the center of "rich and prosperous", then Donghu Hotel is the best choice; if you care about "cost-effectiveness", Donghu Hotel's price of 1k on weekdays is already the biggest conscience (it will definitely be more expensive during holidays).

Overall, East Lake Hotel is definitely an excellent place to stay that I would recommend to my friends.

The interior rooms were both traditional and modern, fully in line with modern people's usage habits, and the sound insulation effect was also good. Go to the surrounding Huaihai Wukang Road and Jing'an Temple are within walking distance of Alimentari Grande, which is right next to it. Go to the store for a glass of white wine in the evening, or sit in the hotel yard and drink beer on this early autumn evening. You can fully experience the journey from the hotel to the streets and alleys of Shanghai. The beauty of the collision between Chinese and Western cultures! Recommended to stay!

msg:Bad review! ! ! I personally regret choosing this hotel. The gap between expectations and reality is always too big! I checked in on the 3rd floor. At around 7pm, the aroma of wine and various food ingredients came up for free in the banquet hall on the second floor (lucky if you like it). I hate this smell very much. The noise of various tables and chairs being moved in the middle of the night (there was probably a wedding banquet being arranged for the next day) was so noisy that people couldn't sleep. The hotel's guest rooms are together with the banquet hall, so choose carefully if you like quiet. The facilities in the room are old and the dead spots in the room are full of fine dust. The back of the bed was actually supported by old wooden boards. If you like the style of old Shanghai, you can choose carefully. If you have high requirements for environmental hygiene, then please take a detour.

Compared with the facilities of this old hotel, the East Lake Hotel is really difficult to satisfy. The bathroom was not even separated when it rained. The room was too small to turn around and the air conditioner was not powerful. Fortunately, we didn't stay for many days. And I feel that the service is relatively formal.

He never lived here for even a day. After that, it was rented out and used as the U.S. Embassy in Shanghai. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, it was taken over by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and renamed the East Lake Hotel. However, it was only used for internal government receptions and was opened to the public after the reform and opening up. It is currently affiliated with East Lake. A well-known five-star garden hotel under the group. Although the garden is not big, the small European-style fountain in the garden still makes people feel a sense of age; the lobby is luxuriously decorated, and the old-fashioned elevator is as old as ever. Although it is a bit small, it is in line with the characteristics of its own old hotel; the rooms are hard-decorated, The soft furnishings and old-style plumbing appliances in the bathroom are imaginable; the receptionist and housekeepers provide decent service and greet each other with a smile; but the breakfast buffet is priced at more than 100 yuan, which may be because there are too few guests for dining that day. Too much to say. Overall, it was a pleasant trip to a garden-style hotel.

The service is very good and humanized. Refreshments when you enter the store and the gift from minnibar are very considerate. Talking about plum candy evokes childhood memories
The hotel has complete facilities and quality

It's just that there's not enough time to walk around the yard

msg:I only booked the East Lake Hotel when I knew it was an old mansion with a history! Love the location! Donghu Road is quiet. The canopy of the sycamore trees in old Shanghai can be connected on both sides of the road. When you go out, you can walk along the city walk. Turn left and go 100 meters to Huaihai Middle Road. There must be at least enough money to spend! I didn't order breakfast at the hotel. There are too many places to eat around. I like to walk to find a good bread and coffee place. The opposite is Pi Ye Coffee, but I couldn't arrange it. There are too many delicious places! Speaking of the hotel itself, needless to say, it is worthy of its price and positioning. The room is big enough and has a history. The indoor air conditioner and smart toilet are all good! recommend!

The management team of Donghu Hotel is really great to bring out such a good and impeccable service team.

It's about 15 minutes away from the nearest subway station. When the weather is fine, you don't take the subway all the way to Huaihai Middle Road. It's quite comfortable. If you catch up with the hot and humid Shanghai, it will be a baptism. When checking out, due to something to discuss, the check-out was delayed for a while, and the front desk readily agreed. There is a turndown service. If the customer requests the takeaway, the service staff in the lobby will deliver it upstairs, so you don’t have to go downstairs to pick it up. The first round of the minibar is free. The sent fruit plums are too sour, and the plum candy is the kind I ate when I was a child, I like it.

Environment: Just to say a word, you must trust Du Yuesheng's taste. The location is very good. If you want to have a drink in the evening or in the afternoon, the bar and dining bar next to it are just outside the door, but because there is a garden yard, it will not be affected at all.


Service: We came here by car, and there is free parking in the yard. The service attitude of the front desk and welcoming guests makes you feel what it means to be at home.

In short, next time we will choose Donghu Hotel.

Every detail shows the style of old Shanghai. Walking into the lobby. It makes people gradually enter the quiet and leisure environment from the hustle and bustle outside the street in an instant.
We booked the most common room for 2 nights. The window faces the roadside. The sound insulation is good, and we didn't hear the noise from the street. The smart toilet is designated for our journey, and the hygiene details are very strict. Scented tea is provided, and the customer service staff will also send a piece of soap every evening, which is a surprise! The food in the hotel's own restaurant is good and authentic, and many locals patronize it. Later, when we went to Hangzhou, we still felt that the meal we ate here tasted the best.
The hotel manager's service is very enthusiastic. We can meet all the requirements we put forward when we checked in. He also warmly guided us to the nearby food and attractions, making us feel at home. Donghu Hotel is worthy of unlimited recommendation, within walking distance to Wukang Road, Anfu Road. There are many simple coffee shops around, which is a good leisure community.

As soon as you enter the lobby, the front desk service is very professional and thoughtful. Immediately after check-in, the staff will help you with your luggage and guide you to the room. It is worth mentioning that the clothes of the staff have the characteristics of the Republic of China, and they even wear hats, which is very a**ospheric .
The interior of the room is clean and tidy, and the area is larger than expected (I thought the renovation of the old house would be smaller), and the bath products and details are worthy of five stars!
Breakfast is relatively average, but the Chinese style is relatively good, with salty syrup, which is rarely seen in hotel buffets.
In short, the hardware and software are very good, and the geographical location is even more invincible! Very recommended!

There are not many people dining in the small hotel in the morning, and the category has been upgraded to a higher level in terms of delicacy and delicacy. The desserts and bread look good, but when you taste it, you can feel that they are made of pastry prefabricated flour. The brownie is really sweet. The child looked beautiful and took a few more desserts, but he didn't even finish the second one. The small ones are very delicate, but the taste is indeed much worse. They are not as delicious as the master Bao on the street in Beijing.
The small wontons are just okay, not as good as the Shanghai joint breakfast restaurant. But I believe the hotel is cleaner and more hygienic.
The small buns, deep-fried dough sticks, and hair cakes are all good in appearance, but the texture and taste are not as good.
The western-style cold food looks okay, there are not many categories, but there are raw ham, salami, chicken ham and so on.
The fruit is nice, fresh and delicious. The welcome fruit apple dates given in the room are very delicious. I hope breakfast can be on par with this level.
I really have to complain about the breakfast tea, but I don't know whether it is black tea or Pu'er, the light brown tea soup has no tea flavor, and there is a layer of tea foam floating on the top. It's better to prepare some lemonade to make it clearer and clearer. This cloudy tea must be improved, otherwise it will not match the richness and taste of celebrity mansions.
It is recommended that the hotel manager learn about the Tokyo Station Hotel, which is also an antique-level architectural hotel, and it is also a small, refined and light luxury hotel. This breakfast restaurant is about the same size as the Du mansion, but the green tea is made with care. Wake up in the morning and take a sip of tea🍵 to wake yourself up and feel refreshed. The breakfast in East Lake is clean, hygienic and edible. The impression of dining is quite like an ink painting, entry-level! After eating, I felt drowsy and didn't wake up.
It is recommended that you go directly to the nearby small shop to eat, you don't need to pay the room fee with breakfast, just choose Wuzai! There are many gourmet shops around. Take a walk in the morning to enjoy the street view of Shanghai and explore the authentic food.
The cleanliness of the room is very good. We haven't finished the drinks provided for two days. We don't drink carbonated drinks and drink beer😂The hotel is very a**ospheric. Of course, as customers, we take what we need and don't waste it. The hair dryer here is a high imitation of Dyson, what brand is Shenzhen Kerui, I forgot to take a picture. Very easy to use, not losing the feeling of Dyson. A set of toiletries is provided for children. This kind of service feels very warm. Although I forgot to use it, the children are very happy and feel that they are taken seriously.
The air conditioner in the room is very quiet, but the exhaust air in the bathroom is a little loud, which does not affect sleep at all. It can only be heard in the bathroom, so it can be ignored if you are not careful.
The bedding is clean and comfortable, the windows are soundproof and can be opened for ventilation.
Donghu Hotel is worth staying in. I like this quiet courtyard. Quiet amidst the noise. Neither the Bund nor City God's Temple is willing. The subway is more convenient, and there are easy traffic jams around at night or on weekdays. There is a bar street around. But it doesn't affect the tranquility of the hotel.

The staff is warm and courteous, and the service is thoughtful. After arriving at the room, someone sent tea bags, fruit and a welcome card, which was a pleasant surprise. The location of the hotel is very convenient, surrounded by famous online celebrity shops, specialty restaurants and many small shops~ The hotel building is an old-style building with only a few floors high, so you can't expect too much for the view.
The only thing is that the room uses old-fashioned wooden floors, which make noise when walking. It is probably to create a sense of age, but personally, I don't like this much...

The most important thing to complain about... ￼
When I checked out, I got the receipt from the front desk, and I needed to fill in the information on the WeChat APP... At that time, I didn't fill it out because of the rush, and I couldn't get the receipt. ￼But this is a hotel system, not a staff issue.

The company is nearby, and I have the opportunity to come again on a business trip. I hope the hotel can improve!

Opposite are many must-try restaurants, including Hong Kong-style tea restaurants that are open until three o'clock at night, luxurious steakhouses, and Western-style restaurants that want to sit outdoors.

We checked out at 6 o'clock in the morning on August 30 and had to go to the airport. The waiter was there all the time during the check-out. I only said one thing, 7 o'clock! It's because we misunderstood that there would be breakfast at 6 o'clock! Because I forgot the room on my phone, I borrowed the card and went back to the room to check. We booked four rooms at the same time, so we borrowed the cards for two rooms. Every time you take out a card, you will be slapped on the front desk. (Of course, I also learned to slap on the desktop when I was still stuck, and I was not beaten.) I stayed for three days in a row, and the aunt who was in charge of hygiene praised it, hard work!

After checking in, because the room was facing the street, I asked if I could change to a room not facing the street. Directly change me to a room of a different room type. The front desk explained that it is the same room type... If it is the same room type according to the front desk, why are they sold at different prices? Honestly I don't understand...

The staff in the lobby helped me upstairs. They walked as fast as a scud. I couldn’t keep up with the speed of a race. I was tired before I even got to the room...

When checking out, I said ok, I can leave, and after half an hour, I called and said, I forgot to check out, when will you come back to pay the bill...

Outrageous to the limit. Will not be coming again.

msg:Very stylish and tasteful hotel! The old Shanghai Du Mansion was rebuilt in 1934, full of history and sense of time. The hotel's facilities can be called low-key luxury, Dyson's hair dryer, Ferragam's toiletries, German capsule coffee machine, minibar soft drinks are all given away, the a**osphere is refined! There are also service staff who are responsible for both air and beauty in Shanghai Beach, and we will give you a festive piggy bank as a gift when you check in on the first day of the new year! The butler-style service level and the ultimate sense of physical examination crushed the international five-star. It is said that there are often VVVIPs who stay in the annex building in a low-key manner. In addition, it is recommended to turn left at the Italian restaurant when going out. The old Shanghai mansion and international restaurants are hidden on the same Donghu Road, reminiscing about history and tasting Shanghai. Be sure to book again next time!

msg:Entering the hotel, you feel like you are in the old Shanghai era. The antique elevators, classical furnishings, and even the clothes of the concierge look like the entourage of the elder brother. You can feel the aura of Boss Du back then. The decoration has a certain year, but The maintenance is still very good, and the overall check-in experience is still very good, so the original one-day stay was extended for another day, but the experience on the second day was not so good, the special items minibar and fruit were not replenished, and the room was cleaned up The aunt said that it can only be provided on the first day, so I was puzzled. The two or three cans of Coke and two oranges were originally just to make the children happy and enjoyable. The cost of the room fee? Fortunately, a minister who happened to pass by heard it, and he readily made it up. I hope that this will be more generous in the future, and the experience will be better. In addition, additional water will also cost more. Except for these small flaws, everything else is perfect. Parking is convenient. The concierge at the front desk provides warm service. The environment is really nice. There are also many snacks around, and there are shops for shopping. You can get there after stopping the car and walking for a while. I will come again next time I have a chance Shanghai will continue to consider choosing to stay!

But the only thing I am not satisfied with is the Chinese food in the restaurant. The cold dishes are hot, while the hot dishes are not cooked. You need to do it yourself to add water. It may be related to the shortage of staff during the Spring Festival. But since it is open, it should be 100% prepared and 100% service.

The overall environment and facilities are still good, so I would like to make two comments: 1. During breakfast, the manager served conscientiously, but the two waiters were well-dressed. The middle-aged women have been standing in the dining room chatting loudly like wooden people, seeming to have forgotten their own work. 2. It is suggested that a hotel with such a historical story should make good use of this resource!

The hotel as a whole is not big, with the highest three floors, small and beautiful, with wooden floors, furniture, and copper chic desk lamps with a sense of history.
Male staff wear Chinese tunic suits and woolen hats, which have the tune of the Republic of China.
I sent an anti-epidemic travel suit and a little lucky rabbit for the New Year, and I was very careful.
In the afternoon, I took a walk near Huaihai Road under the warm sunshine, and saw the small bungalows, small gardens, and well-designed street parks. It was very beautiful.

Needless to say, the charm of old buildings and old objects, the room facilities and service team are completely worthy of the price and the glory of the time-honored brand. From the door to the room, the service in every link is in place. The cleanliness and comfort of the room exceed expectations. The kettle has no water stains at all, which beats 99% of high-star hotels. The refreshments delivered were exquisite and not perfunctory.
The location is too good, and there are too many dining options around, so that I have no chance to experience the in-store dining, I will try it next time.

The most important thing is that the mattress is very soft. When you sleep on it, your whole body sinks. There is no support. If you don’t fall asleep all night, you will be very tired. It will be a punishment for people with bad spines.
I couldn't find my way when I checked out in the morning. When I walked to a place, I met a staff member in uniform. I asked where the front desk was. She asked very strangely why you are here? How do I know where this is? I only ask for directions when I don’t know. What kind of strange rhetorical question is this?
There is no sense of basic service at all, very casual and market
There is also a deposit of 1000, which should be very high.
In addition to the beautiful appearance of the hotel, there is no advantage. Not recommended

The toiletries that were used up on the first day were not added the next day, the paper towels were used up immediately and they were not added, and the tea bags and coffee capsules were forgotten to be added. The service desk was filled later. But is this service good? Facilities and environment are very good. Overall pretty good 👌

When I checked out, the front desk gave me a sample of the fragrance, saying it smelled the same as the room. I Xx thought I would never come here in my life. As a Shanghainese, I came here to try it out. I didn’t expect the waitress at your front desk Bring it all down! I forgot to bring an umbrella and asked the front desk to borrow an umbrella.

msg:Du Yuesheng's 50th birthday, a neoclassical building, the Laodizi Hotel in Shanghai. The check-in experience is very good, the perfect interpretation of quietness in the middle of the noise. The bathroom is separated, which is very convenient. Although it was renovated in 2016, the materials, design and craftsmanship are very particular, especially the standard of daily maintenance is very high. The woodwork is perfectly matched, the marble is clean and bright, and the spliced wood floor has a high-quality texture. The newness and cleanliness exceeds that of some of the 2020 hotels I have stayed at. Stayed one night. If there is a gym and swimming pool, I will continue to stay for a few days. The only thing that feels inadequate is that when asked about the specific situation of this old house, such as where the number and number of buildings are, and the past, the answer given by the front desk clerk is a bit insufficient. It is recommended to provide a more comprehensive and high-quality explanation for interested guests.

msg:There are five floors in the room. We live on the fifth floor, and the hygiene is very good. It is very convenient to go to Wukang Road, Sinan Road, and Xintiandi. It is two or three stops by car and subway. If it is convenient, cycling is also a good choice. Generally, there is no direct elevator in the subway. Most of the time, you have to walk downstairs when you take the subway. The elderly inconvenient. There are old-fashioned garden houses nearby. It feels very good. You can have breakfast after a short walk. As a southerner, I have lived in the north for a long time. I am very happy to eat southern breakfast again.

msg:Since I stayed at the East Lake Hotel for the first time on Chris**as Day in 2018, the East Lake Hotel has been my first choice every time I come to Shanghai in the following three years. However, this time I was really disappointed with my stay.
1. The bedding is too simple, a simple thin quilt has no sense of warmth, and the mattress seems to have not been cleaned for a long time, covering the body is damp and not very soft;
2. Compared with two or three years ago, the quality of toiletries has dropped a lot, but the room rates have not dropped in price;
3. It is not recommended to eat breakfast in the hotel. The dishes are too simple and there are only a few more items than ordinary business express hotels. Besides, except for the soup noodle section, everything else is cold food. Even the stir-fry at 7:40 is already cold. ;
4. There is a peculiar smell in the lobby, which seems to be due to the smell of rags or mops. Please pay more attention to the hygiene of cleaning supplies;
5. Of course, there are still advantages. The hotel has very good sound insulation. Although the room faces the road this time, the sound is instantly muted as soon as the window is closed.
All in all, I won't stay here again in the future.

msg:Overall, the advantages and disadvantages of the hotel are very obvious. Let me talk about the advantages first. The geographical location is very good. It is surrounded by Changshu Road, Changle Road and South Shaanxi Road. It is surrounded by old-fashioned foreign houses in Shanghai. The flavor is enough. There is a small fountain garden in front of the hotel building. The room is very spacious. Although the facilities are not new, the bathroom cloakroom is large enough and the wet and dry are separated. These are very satisfying. The disadvantage is the service details, and the most unacceptable hygiene. There is no introduction booklet of restaurants and various service facilities that ordinary hotels would have in the room. I am also used to ordering food in the hotel restaurant or guest room. After having breakfast the next morning, I went to the front desk and said that I forgot to put the hotel facilities in the guest room. A girl at the front desk handed me an origami paper without any explanation. , Something similar to advertising, I was very surprised to ask if there is no introduction of hotel restaurants and services, the front desk clerk didn’t know if he had misunderstood or didn’t listen to the needs of the guests at all, and actually said to me: This is for you. No need to pay back! I was also staying at that time, do I have to pay back an advertisement page? Just ask if you only have this restaurant for breakfast? The answer is yes. The breakfast restaurant is not big, and there are 10 tables in total. The breakfast is really so-so, not many varieties, and the taste is very ordinary. I immediately decided not to eat in the hotel to avoid stepping on thunder. In addition, every time I enter and leave the hotel, I don’t see many guests, but I saw hotel staff talking loudly in the lobby several times, and once I encountered a similar training group giving lectures here. The a**osphere is very strange. That is, the hotel gives people an old state-run a**osphere, and the feelings of the guests are not very important. Let’s talk about hygiene. I had breakfast on the third day. When I saw the waiter closing the table, he turned over the used table mat for the next table. If it was dirty, wipe it with a napkin. At first I thought I was wrong, so I took a closer look at the next table, and it turned out that this program was really disgusting. Even if it was not during the epidemic, this approach was very disgusting. What about the hygiene of the guest room according to this logic? Think carefully.

大堂翻新過，滿眼瓷磚大理石，完全沒有一點民國的痕跡了，有點失望。白天去馬勒別墅看了看，比這裡有味道。下次可以去試一試。

部屋は造りも清潔感も非の打ち所がありませんでした。パーフェクトです。とても居心地の良い部屋でした。

朝食も混み合うことなくゆっくりと摂ることができました。メニューは一般的ではありますが豊富です。朝食会場のステンドグラスが朝日を反射して綺麗でした。

立地もとても良く、近くにはiapmやパークソンなどのモール、カフェバーなどが軒を連ね、散歩も楽しめます。

ここまで非の打ち所がないホテルは初めてでした。また宿泊したいです。

酒店本身是杜月笙的公館改造的，走進去以後感覺像是進入了老電影當中。
設施保養的還可以，不算老。早餐品種不多，但也是足夠滿足需求了。
唯一的遺憾是最近晚上路邊有施工，很吵。在這就要贊一下隔音的陽台門了，應該是多層玻璃，很厚重，大部分噪音都可以隔絕。
