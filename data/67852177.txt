msg:My friends in China recommended this hotel and told me that she loves it because it’s relatively inexpensive compared to similar hotels in the area.  She also stressed that it is a native Chinese brand hotel that it is easier for her to order food and just anything she needs.  I was pleasantly surprised by its decor, service, cleanliness and modern amenities.  Our room had a nice big tub, huge shower and toilet with bidet.  It’s been a while since I visited Japan and I forgot how nice to have a bidet.   The breakfast was a nice addition to our stay since it is included.  It served both Chinese and American breakfast with some nice local dishes. The decor is modern Chinese Jiangnan style featuring paintings, Calligraphy, and 3-D animation of gold fishes.  I enjoyed working out at the gym as well.  Super clean and all equipment are easy to use.  There is a Pilate room as well.  I didn’t have time to enjoy it.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  Not to mention that I asked for a power cord, it was delivered by a robot.  Five star experience! .

msg:I just returned from the UK and came to the hotel directly from the airport. The staff at the front desk of the hotel was very kind and helped me store my luggage because I didn't have a room in the morning, so they prepared water for me to rest on the sofa and upgrade my room when I checked in in the afternoon. The room was very large, quiet and comfortable, and the breakfast was very good The reception delivery speed is too slow to wait for their own down to take the hope that it can be improved in the future.

Staff members were very friendly and helpful. Quiet peaceful hotel  environment, suits a minimalist like me and with high tech. Room services were carried out by robots. Hotel decoration combines Japanese Chinese and a lot of western elements, ancient but modern taste providing a luxury feeling when living in. 

Definitely my favourite.

The lobby was a bit stingy in general. The bed part of the room was a bit small and the washing part was a bit too big. This was a business trip so I needed a safe. To my surprise, there wasn't one. If you need to store something, you have to take it to the front desk. How convenient is it? There is no privacy! Shouldn't this be a five-star standard? After taking a shower, I found out that there was no moisturizing lotion in the room. I turned on the heater and didn't apply lotion. How could I survive? After that, I called and told all my problems, and they were handled very quickly. I upgraded my room and got breakfast. I called a car to take me to the airport. The overall service made me satisfied! The supporting facilities are not good, and the sound insulation is also very poor. You can hear the sound of the shower in the next room and the sound of the corridor in your room.

【It was good point】
・The room is clean
・The toilet has a washlet
・The dryer is made by Dyson.
・Lights in the bathroom and toilet are turned on by sensors
-The gym is clean and has relatively good equipment.
・Shopping and eating are relatively convenient since Takashimaya is next door.
・Subway Line 10 “Iriji Station” is within walking distance
・There is a convenience store on the first basement floor of the hotel building.

【important point】
・There is no housekeeping sign on the doorknob, so the housekeeper may come knocking and wake you up from your nap.
-Prices are a little high for a hotel in this area

[Overview]
This hotel has guest rooms on the 9th to 12th floors of a commercial building called Guhoku SOHO. The overall interior has a Chinese retro design. It belongs to a Chinese hotel chain called Kashukai, so the staff's service is solid. Highly recommended for short-term stays.

The room is very comfortable, the supplies are very particular, and a Dyson hair dryer is used. LG particularly likes the shampoo and shower gel here, which have a woody scent.

The room has a Chinese style, which is very suitable for tea tasting. Free tea leaves are provided for tasting, and the tea sets are also very exquisite and elegant!

Opposite is Takashimaya, which LG said is very convenient. It is also very close to the Golden City Road Pedestrian Street. After breakfast, I walked across the street and smelled the sweet-scented osmanthus. It was so comfortable.

Will recommend to other friends.

I communicated with the hotel in the early stage about the packaging of afternoon tea. I saw it as soon as I entered the room, but there was no welcome fruit. , I don’t know if I forgot to give it, but I can’t eat alone so I didn’t ask the front desk. This place is located in the livable Gubei, which is very suitable for city walks and rejuvenating the body and mind. The hotel is well designed, rich in Chinese style, and has surrounding facilities. Convenient, I will choose Xiyue next time.

msg:Let me first make a point. I doubt the authenticity of this hotel’s 4.9 rating?
My rating is related to the room price. If it is 600 per night, I will give it one higher rating.
The breakfast was semi-buffet, but it was very poor. I lost my appetite after looking at the buffet area. All the food was placed like expired products. No impression, squeezed into a small corner of the restaurant. For the optional part, I ordered the hand-made saury and wonton stew. The MSG in that soup is probably free. There is also a healthy abalone and sea cucumber porridge. Not to mention that this porridge is like a ball of rotten rice porridge. The abalone and other things are just porridge. It doesn't matter, it is just put on the porridge.
This breakfast is not worth the 1,300 room fee. It is not average. Better budget hotels are better than this.

I checked it out and found out that this is a high-end Chinese-style hotel that Huazhu is going to build. I just decided to try it out. I feel that in addition to applying some Chinese elements in the decoration, from the heart, this is a budget hotel with Chinese elements.

The room is 45 square meters, with two chairs. It is small and hard, with enough space for a sofa, and there is no table for working. It is located in Gubei Business District and lacks business attributes.

The bathtub is like a useless thing, just put a bathtub just for the sake of putting a bathtub. It was originally a piece of hardware that adds to the tone, but in my opinion, the bathtub in this room completely detracts from the points. I am curious who is the designer of this hotel? I dare not compliment you!

The lights in the guest room are only full on, sleeping, fully off, and soft light. I want to turn on a bedside wall lamp alone, but it can't be realized. I hope I don't know how to use it.

When I finally checked out, I was told that parking was charged, but there was a discount! Parking fee is 40 yuan a night? Didn’t the hotel earn 40 yuan from the 1,300 yuan room fee?

There is a ventilation problem inside the hotel. At around 8pm, the corridor of the guest room is filled with the smell of restaurant food.

If it's a little bit, the minibar is free and the tea set and teapot are okay.

msg:I stayed in a double bed room. When I arrived at the room at 11:30 pm, I found that there was no window in the room. The air conditioner in the room was turned on. The hotel set the temperature to 26 degrees. However, the quilt was indeed a winter quilt and could not cover it. It was too It was hot. I asked the front desk. The front desk said that the air conditioner could not cool down now because it was winter and the hotel could only set it to heating mode. I called to ask for water and heater, but they were delivered 20 minutes later. They said there was only one front desk staff member left at night and they were too busy. There are no thin quilts to replace. I can only sleep with my clothes on. After breakfast the next day, I couldn't open the door by swiping my room card, so I asked the floor attendant to open it. They couldn't verify my identity in ten minutes, so I had to call the front desk myself to verify it before opening it. Generally speaking, the main reason is that the room temperature is too high and it is difficult to sleep. This is the second time I have stayed in this hotel and the same experience. Won't stay here for a third time.

The mattress is moderately firm and comfortable. Drinks in the fridge are free. I especially want to praise his shower head, the water is very large, but it won't splash, and it won't feel stinging when it hits the body. It's very comfortable and easy to use. The shower room in his house is also very large, and the shower products are all in small bottles, which taste very good and can be used with confidence. The toilet is flush. So showering in his home is very comfortable. In short, I think this is a very refined, comfortable and tasteful hotel.

I thought it was thunder, but later I found out that the corridor was very steep and the sound insulation was not enough. The room facing the inner courtyard really heard a very loud resonance. The front desk helped to change to the room facing the outside without noise, but the room smelled very big and musty when I entered it. I don't know why the hotel has the nerve to let the guests live. The shower head was broken and came to fix it in the middle of the night. I thought the moldy smell would disappear after turning on the air conditioner, but the smell remained the same for the next two days. It turned out that the smallpox was all moldy and left untreated. Step by step, you can imagine how musty the smell is by looking at the ceiling. Xiyue, who lived in Pudong before, was very satisfied, but this time she was very impressed.

I have to hold him on the toilet when he goes to the toilet; you can also put some medical supplies at the front desk. For example, band-aids, gauze, bandages, sterilized cotton swabs, wind oil essence... The Shanghai hospital I went to because my child was injured was not familiar with Shanghai. When I returned, the bandages were a little loose, so I asked the staff to get the bandages. , they said no.

msg:There are many advantages, let's talk about the shortcomings. 1. Arrive at the store around 8:00 p.m., and there is no one to help with luggage at the door. The female receptionist at the front desk did not smile during the check-in process. 2. I don't really like the design of the washbasin as soon as you enter the door, and there is no closed wardrobe. 3. The quality of the decoration is average (the bathroom wall tiles are uneven, and the gaps in the room floor are too large). 4. All the upper and lower furniture are not made of wood, and the design is good, but the texture is not good. 5. I ordered a takeaway, and the robot delivered it to the door of the room. The voice call notification suggested that it should be distinguished from the following Quanji. After all, they are two brands with different positioning. It is best not to let the guests find the shadow of Quanji. 6. In addition to the good service of the tall handsome guy, the breakfast is still in the training period. You can place a small trash can at the tea bag for guests to discard tea bags. It is recommended to change the meal recycling basin that guests must pass through to pick up meals , Really affects appetite. In fact, they are all small details, but the satisfaction of customers needs these small details to complete. In general, the experience of Guofeng Hotel is still good, and I hope it will get better and better. But more efforts are needed to win the hearts of customers. By the way, the complimentary lotus root pork ribs soup in the room is very delicious.

There is a urine spot on the toilet seat in the bathroom, which is really unacceptable. I sprayed it a dozen times with the alcohol I brought with me. I can’t accept the dirty feeling. Get up early, there is no call for service.
I wanted to boil water to drink, but there was hair and crumbs in the kettle... Later, I drank mineral water directly.
The shower is okay, it's small, maybe too small so it's warmer, the bathroom in Indigo was too big, it froze me too much.
The sound insulation is not good, and there is no entrance like a business hotel, so the sound in the corridor can be heard.
In short, I won't stay here again, it was a very frustrating night.

🌟The shower room is really big! The structure is still very interesting, the washing area is open, and the bathroom is a separate one, but this also results in a little less bedroom space.
🌟Check out at 14 o'clock, so the parking was quite long, the hotel discounted the parking fee of 80 yuan, and paid 40 yuan. ⚠️So it's not free parking.
❗️There is a problem with the sound insulation. When it is quiet at night, you can hear the sound in the corridor.

There are many advantages:
1. The location is in Gubei, surrounded by high-end residential areas, and it is convenient to go to Yan'an Elevated Road;
2. The hotel and rooms are all national style, with a certain sense of culture;
3. The employees are very polite;
4. The breakfast is very distinctive, and drinks in the room are also provided, which should conform to the eating habits of Chinese people.

There are also many disadvantages:
1. The Wi-Fi in the room can only work when the password is displayed on the TV screen. In other words, if you want to watch TV, don’t use Wi-Fi. I don’t know what the logic is;
2. The hotel was unable to provide laundry services during the stay. The front desk introduced a laundromat outside, but there was no discount mentioned in the introduction, and the invoicing was not smooth;
3. For the management of epidemic prevention at the door, the QR code must be scanned every time you enter the door, even if you have a room card. is it necessary? Aren't the health code and travel code updated on a daily basis? !
4, 5-star price but lack of 5-star configuration, the TV is only domestic, and there is no safe in the room.

There is still a long way to go to improve the overall level of the domestic hotel industry

msg:The hotel is really nice It's very convenient to deliver. Surprisingly, the white fungus soup delivered is in a small thermos cup. I don't worry about it getting cold when I want to drink it. Breakfast is a semi-self-service. I was a little puzzled at first. The side dishes can be a la carte. The main food is one per person. The five items are served on the plate. The quiet feeling is very comfortable. Overall, I am very satisfied. The next door is near Takashimaya.

msg:Not to mention the environment, as always, this is the second time to stay at Xiyue, and I like this unique Chinese-style hotel very much. Booked a two-night package, and overall I was very satisfied. The room was large and well-equipped, and the stay was very comfortable. There were a few minor issues with this stay. First of all, the variety of breakfast is a little monotonous. In addition to the good taste of the main food, other catering and self-service areas are a little monotonous, and I hope to improve. In addition, the welcome fruit was not received on the day of check-in until the evening. I called the front desk to inquire and replied that it should have been delivered. In fact, I did not receive it. Of course, it was worth affirming that a supplement was sent after a while. In addition, I didn't receive the desserts mentioned by other guests for two nights. I don't know if it was a seasonal adjus**ent or it was missed.

The whole room is decorated in new Chinese style, very elegant, from the kettle to the tea set, all elegant and tasteful. The whole series of bath products are from upper and lower brands, and the light woody fragrance adds to the artistic conception of the house. Even the toothpaste used is Yunnan Baiyao, which is the ultimate in Chinese style. The minibar is very rich and free, and the breakfast's millet sea cucumber porridge, abalone wonton, and wagyu ramen are also impressive. The Huaiyang dishes in the set menu were very good, and when they parted, they also gave Lei Yunshang a co-branded souvenir.

Good service, good hygiene, good food, good environment, convenient transportation...

✔️On the day of check-in, pastries and coffee were also given, just look at the pictures, it is really a delicious series.
✔️The decoration style of the hotel is new Chinese style, the space is large, the bathroom is also large, the hair dryer is Dyson, and the refrigerator, drinks and snacks in the mini bar in the room are also free to eat and drink. It happened to be during the epidemic period, and there were not many people, so the whole is very quiet Very comfortable stay for several days.
✔️The service staff from the front desk to each floor are very polite and warm.
✔️Agate Garden Restaurant, the restaurant in the special hotel, must try it. The meals produced are all delicious, don't step on the thunder series.

Overall experience, high score 🥂

The four teas that were originally given away, the little girl in the restaurant has added 8 😋, let me and my baby experience a The feeling of eating up😝, the overall style of the hotel is Chinese, giving people a very peaceful feeling. Saw a lot of families with kids. The breakfast is very rich. Fruits, bread, milk, etc. are served at the small bar. The other part is in the form of a set menu. After ordering, the waiter will bring it up. As a result, I can't finish eating more than two o'clock in the afternoon. The mung bean soup was delivered at almost 5 o'clock, and it was also packed in a thermos. Next to it is Takashimaya, which is very convenient for shopping. In summer, you drink a lot of water. The cleaning aunt and the girl at the front desk both gave four bottles of water, including Evian and the farmer's orange juice. The service is so attentive and warm.

The first is the consistent national trendy style and the elegant room design, which is pleasing to the eye. The second is the intelligent experience that far exceeds the international brands, such as the smart TV with screen projection function, and the extremely easy-to-use app and room interaction. The third is excellent Kind catering, welcome fruits, dim sum, free minibar, free afternoon tea Chinese refreshments, and delicious semi-buffet breakfast. The fourth is the kindness of hospitality, actively upgrading the first-class room, and being able to actively identify the membership level of the guests through the reserved mobile phone number (non-official website reservation), and rarely provide take-out delivery service.

msg:The first time I stayed at Xiyue~ I found out that it was a high-end five-star hotel owned by Huazhu when I arrived at the front desk~ The lady at the front desk was very kind and gave us a small gift for Valentine’s Day. The room as a whole is decorated in a new Chinese style. It is very textured at first glance, very large and spacious. There was also sweet porridge and handwritten cards in the evening, which really made me feel at home. Real-name praise, it turns out that in addition to international hotels, we can also make such a good hotel ourselves.

msg:Conclusion first: highly recommended! Five-star recommendation! King of value for money! Go live!
Traveling during the Spring Festival under the epidemic is too troublesome, so I simply booked a new Chinese-style hotel near my home for New Year's Eve. When I checked in, I upgraded the room type for free, and on New Year's Eve, I also gave Babao rice and sweet soup with wine. My poor words can't describe how delicious this Eight Treasures Rice is! Sweet and soft! I also gave a souvenir when I checked out. All services can be given full marks, which is better than the experience of staying in many five-star hotels before.

🚗 Transportation: The hotel is located in the Gubei Soho podium, next to Takashimaya, and a few minutes away from the subway station. It is very convenient for travel and shopping.

🍃Environment: The new Chinese decoration style is deeply loved by the mother. The gym is not small and well-equipped.

When I returned to the room at night, I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was a bowl of hot soup by the bed. It is a gift to check out, which is really a surprise. The new and clean room is really relaxing. There are also many places to eat and play next to it, which is very convenient. I will definitely choose Xiyue when I come to Gubei in the future.

The package I bought belongs to the food tour, I have never been hungry, the afternoon tea is very good, and the semi-buffet breakfast is very delicate. The parking fee is a little expensive, it would be better if you can stay in the hotel! Across the road is Takashimaya, there are many Japanese food stores nearby, which is very convenient. Will consider staying next time. (No way, I can't go to other places at present, I can only travel in local hotels.)

The matching upper and lower (Hermes) furniture is very colorful, the environment is elegant and quiet, the guest rooms are soundproof, the shower is large, the bedding is comfortable, the intelligent toilet, lighting, curtains, Nescafé coffee machine, Kung Fu tea should be complete. The TV is also huge, and the snacks and drinks in the refrigerator are open to drink. This is also a measure of hotel luxury. Toiletries are also brands from top to bottom, with essential oils added, I like them. It's just that there are less skin care products and preferably a weight scale at the washstand. The breakfast is great, the à la carte set menu and the semi-buffet are all over the place. Afternoon tea was done with great care, and the waiter was very attentive. The criticism is that the front desk service needs to be further improved. The package I ordered includes afternoon tea and check-out at 16:00, but I called at 1:00 in the afternoon to urge you and did not confirm the appoin**ent of afternoon tea. This should not be true.

There is an oriental charm when you enter the door to welcome guests, as well as the aroma of essential oils that you can smell even with a mask on. The bar on the first floor has the style of the Tang Dynasty Orchid pub, and there are performances in the evening. When I went upstairs and entered the room, there was a sense of familiarity in the decoration style. As far as my eyes could see, there was a sense of restraint and quiet beauty. No wonder I saw Jiang Qiong'er on TV. When I left the store, I also gave a small gift box, but unfortunately it fell on the high-speed rail. I'll make up for it next time I have a chance to stay at the hotel.

It's really good. I didn't enjoy it because I didn't have enough time to travel. Everything in the minibar is free, but I just drank a bottle of orange juice. Overall, the experience is very good.

In the afternoon, welcome fruits and pork bone soup are also given, snacks and drinks in the small refrigerator are also free, and the hair dryer is Dyson!

The hotel has free afternoon fruits, but why can the waiter swipe his card to come in? Without knocking or ringing the doorbell?
In addition, the hotel room does not have a window, which makes the air conditioner very stuffy after being turned off, which needs to be improved; and the curtain can be closed by pressing the switch all the time, instead of a long press, which is not very smart;
The surrounding environment is very good, the subway entrance + Takashimaya Mall, many well-received Japanese materials, you will be a treasure shop when you visit, I hope there will be improvements next time.

The hotel focuses on the Chinese concept, the TV is also smart and can be cast, and the style is Chinese. Even the soap is ginseng flavor. The gift of sparkling rice wine is also super delicious, and it is said to be a special offer for the hotel. In the evening, I asked for a memory pillow. The whole service is online, a great hotel! 👍

My friend asked me to go to the Bund for dinner. I checked the traffic conditions in the city that day and decided to take the subway, which was only half an hour away.

🧹Sanitation: The sanitary condition is very good. It may be a new hotel. During the stay, there is no unqualified sanitation or peculiar smell.
🍃Environment: The new Chinese style is adopted in the overall style. The room is equipped with a coffee machine, a tea maker, and a tea set. The room is clean and bright. There are electric curtains and intelligent light control systems that are more in line with the needs of modern people. The bedside is also equipped with sockets and USB charging ports, which is very convenient to use. (It was a little tangled at first. I thought that the space inside the house of 38 square meters might be small, but after I went in, I realized that it was much larger than I thought.)
🔔Service: A staff member contacted me one day before check-in and asked about my approximate check-in time and any special requirements. When I checked in, the procedures were very simple and completed in two minutes. There were not many people. The front desk was very enthusiastic and escorted me to the elevator. It can be said that the hotel I have recently stayed in reflects the service level of a five-star hotel. One family. When I checked out, the front desk also gave me some of the hotel's toiletries and care products as souvenirs, and once again gave me a compliment to the hotel's service!
Overall, this stay is also very enjoyable. Next time I go to Shanghai on a business trip, I will consider this one the first time. After all, the service is good and the environment is good.

There were obviously discounted packages, but they didn't recommend them to me. The room rate information was not transparent, and I had to fight for it myself. They tricked you into buying a package, and after you bought it, the standard of the items in the package was lowered. I understand that this was caused by the epidemic, but why didn't you notify us when you lowered the standard? They didn't take the initiative to compensate you. You need to lose your temper and fight with them before they give you a price during the epidemic. But this price is not transparent either. Different guests can negotiate different prices. It depends on your ability! They won't tell you the real price, they just look at the price you say. It's too chaotic. For a five-star hotel, this is the management routine. The management staff is very ** and inhumane.

The room was equipped with advanced equipment, smart curtains and toilet, and Dyson hair dryer, because it is a new hotel that understands that it is a bit new when entering the door. The decoration tastes, it would be nice if the room has windows, the room wifi can't be used for some reason, but overall it is satisfactory!

After arriving in the room, there are welcome fruits, free drinks, etc., and then I receive a call from the front desk asking if I am satisfied and if there is anything to add. The slippers have a small detail that is well done, and can separate the left and right feet immediately. The quality of the breakfast is also quite good. In short, the overall experience is quite good.

msg:The service is very good, and you will always give a greeting. The room facilities are also good, I gave a Dyson hair dryer. There are a bunch of old records in Xi Le, as well as Gu Long and Jin Yong's novels. The gym facilities are also very complete. There are rowing machines. You must know that rowing machines are rarely equipped even in professional gyms. The threads of the slippers in the room are all exposed, the quality is too bad, and it is really uncomfortable to wear, the body lotion and hand cream are too difficult and exhausting. I went to the hotel to have a meal on the first day. Regardless of the environment, food and service, I gave surprises, but there were no surprises for the breakfast on the second day, because many of the breakfasts were duplicates of the lunch on the first day. , But his family’s yogurt is super-loved, and it is said that they got it from Xinjiang.

That day, the sheets were covered with ashes and they were photographed. I gave them feedback the next morning and shirked all kinds of responsibilities. I called Called to the front desk to ask the responsible person to answer the phone, deliberately avoiding answering the phone, saying that I was busy with all kinds of fudges, let my girl wait in the lobby for three hours, I asked her when to deal with it, wait for a sentence, the attitude is really very bad It’s the first time in history that my daughter’s skin is allergic because the sheets are not clean. I don’t understand where so many good comments come from, I don’t understand.

This time, for a very special reason, after staying in Xiyue, Gubei for seven days, I really think it should be praised. This is the first time I stayed at the brand under the Huazhu Club. It is small and beautiful, and I tried my best to provide quality services to customers. It is worth looking forward to the next stay. The only hope is to maintain this original intention, and to really continue this customer-oriented approach, I believe it will become better and better!

msg:十分滿意的一次體驗。在住之前看到一些差評還有些擔心，但當住進去之後就徹底體驗到酒店對細節的控制。很多時候服務的好壞並不在於外表看起來的奢華。這家酒店雖然房間看起來很簡單，地方也不大，但各個細節都做到了極致：廁所乾濕徹底分離，自動馬桶，洗浴雙噴頭極簡設計（有很多次在其他酒店，折騰好久都不知道兩個噴頭如何相互轉換），床墊軟硬合適，最喜歡的就是自動上下窗簾能夠保證完全遮光。雖然房間沒有浴缸，沒有辦公桌，沙發也不夠大。但其他方面的優勢完全彌補這些不足。在住完禧玥之後我又來到深圳住在凱賓斯基，雖然這裏房間很大，書桌，沙發，浴缸一應俱全，而且牆上還有壁畫裝飾，外表看起來很光鮮，但住宿體驗完全不如禧玥。地上用的是地毯，看起來就不很乾凈，房間還有股子煙味，窗簾手動還拉不緊，坐在馬桶上如果廁所門如果不關緊總是會打到腿上，等等。對比之後，下次去上海一定還會住在禧玥！

客房的花灑使用按制，但閘水不緊，水會突然流下來，半夜也會突然流下聽到聲音，包括樓上的水聲。 
書抬上的插座沒有電， 風筒也是壞的，算了，也不想特別打擾叫人來換。 
出風口的風直接對著床頭，整晚都吹住頭，天喔！
房間有一點點發霉的味道，開大空調還行。
本來想訂大一點的客房，原來是沒有窗。窗是對電梯大堂的！！ 天喔，通過窗簾房間在做什麼都看見。所有有窗對於沒有窗。  
大房還要在電梯旁邊，床便在電梯旁邊，電梯一通過便隆隆聲，非常吵。 付出了比較高的錢，換來是受罪。  
下次可能還會住，但一點選城市風景的房間。   我付出的價錢，沒有預期這樣。 要住可以，但訂便宜的房間好了。

設施：酒店早餐和奢華，山珍海味來形容也不過分。但不知道多久才會換一下菜單。來了幾次酒店早餐還是一樣的。

設施：新中式設計，房間電氣都是新的，電視機可以投屏，吹風機戴森的，洗手間浴室燈光是感應的，茶具和電熱壺滿滿設計感，有歡迎水果，冰箱軟飲暢飲，外賣可以由機器人送，很先進。
服務人員：培訓得好，都很有禮貌，服務主動性強，經常給我升級房間體驗不同房型。
配套方面：12樓餐廳，10樓健身房，大廳有品茶區，除了沒有游泳池和免費停車的小缺陷之外，其他都不比豪華五星級酒店差。
建議：停車費沒多少錢，住千元房間的客户不是付不起，但是很奇怪的是會帶來客户體驗感的不佳，建議考慮給客户免掉，這個是高端服務業的標準操作了。

msg:這真的是我覺得服務相當用心的酒店了！！

臨入住發現核酸碼從48小時變成72了，致電前台問能不能辦理入住，非常迅速的給出很人性化的解決方案，關鍵是説了給你回電真的立馬給你回電，大概都沒有等超過五分鐘

抽盲盒本來抽中送什麼飲品的，因為特殊原因真的衹抱着試試看的情況問能不能飲品不要了換延遲退房，非常感謝前台小姐姐的熱心幫我一路延到了6點

説第二天有活動能不能給一套抗原，很貼心的拿袋子裝好送到手上，退房的時候也是送的一個什麼小禮品也是拿袋子裝好很細緻的送到手上，主動拖行李詢問幫忙訂車這就不説了

酒店的審美還是很不錯的，景觀也很好，關鍵可以投屏！！床品也很舒服躺着躺着就睡著了哈哈哈…哦那個遮光窗簾真的太遮光了…早上起來沒開燈我都要懷疑自己是不是夜盲了…如果唯一美中不足的就是空調製冷好像不是非常迅猛（不過我也沒問人家可能是我自己設定的問題）

很少會寫那麼長的點評…實在是非常感謝前台小姐姐的貼心服務，入住體驗非常愉快

很有品質的禧玥讓人喜歡，地段、房間裝飾、服務和入住的感覺都貼合古北的風格，低調的奢華。
飲食也同樣，半自助早餐很有儀式感，餛飩湯裏是大個鮑魚小米粥中有整衹海蔘，靜靜的體現高級，12樓早餐或下午茶，天天遇見的服務員和崔先生服務彬彬有理既讓人舒服又不打擾。還要特別謝謝前台接待劉娟，禮貌周到熱心幫助，經她告知我們加入了華住會，入住享有許多優惠真是性價比很高。還要説一句，邊上就是程石發藝術館，我們喜歡禧玥，有品味。
