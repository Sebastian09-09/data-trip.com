I also asked the hotel to ask for 2 pairs of children's slippers. The waiter was very considerate and brought a children's toothbrush at the same time, very nice

msg:There is nothing to say about the facilities of the old hotel. It’s not a broken problem. The toilet can’t be pressed down since it’s settled in. Every time it’s flushed, the float in the toilet needs to be refilled. It’s black mold that can’t be seen at all. The shower in the bathroom has only an old-fashioned fixed nozzle. The funniest thing is that the selling point of the room is the hot spring, but the hot spring with 70-year-old parents does not accept it. No matter how you say it, it costs the price of a hot spring hotel. It's useless to just live in a dilapidated house from the last century. The only advantage is that the location is very good and it's close to Baoguo Temple Station. The hot spring is also very ordinary and old, far worse than the Yuquan Bay where we stayed the next day, but Lingxiu is famous, it is too bad, the front desk is completely robot service, not to mention the service. The uncle in the parking lot and the guy in the lobby are nice. Ctrip said that the hotel's five-star hotel is actually 4⭐, which is not worthy of the name. Don't mention the taste when you enter the lobby. I also ate a meal in the hotel restaurant that day. It was expensive and not delicious. It was a failure. It is recommended that Ctrip clearly mark on the booking page

Old people over 70 in Chu cannot use hot springs. Otherwise, thousands of kilometers are really disappointing.
M is really not recommended to bring children and the elderly to settle in. Suffering, the parking is also far away, I feel that it is only suitable for visiting around Chengdu, and there is no requirement for accommodation

2. There is no central air conditioning, the corridors are stuffy, and the road signs are unclear, making it difficult to find the corresponding room.
3. The room is old and it is difficult to match the price of more than 500 yuan. There is no socket at the bedside...

This time, considering that the indoor hot spring is relatively large, I chose Lingxiu Hot Spring to stay. First of all, I made a note on the third floor when ordering on Ctrip, and also received a text message from the hotel confirming that the reservation was successful. When I arrived at the hotel, they arranged a hotel for me. Floor, I never stay on the first floor, so I emphasized that I noted the order information, and they finally moved me to the second floor while waiting. I booked an executive room, but the elevator was being replaced, so the elevator in the main building could not be used. , and told that the elevator had been replaced for more than a month, and was speechless. . I later thought that hot springs were good, but when I arrived at the hot springs, I was dumbfounded. On Saturday, the indoor hot springs were not open at all, and the swimming pool was not open at all. There were only a few small pools and a three-story hot spring pool. Speaking of those three floors The hot spring pool is so filthy. There are dead bees floating on the third floor and the leaves are black. In short, this is the dirtiest hot spring I have ever soaked in. On the second floor of the hot spring pool, my friend actually saw someone spitting in the pool. No one cared and oh my god we were gone in no time. The breakfast variety was pretty good, and there was a huge crowd. There was no room for the six of us, and there was no one to take care of us. I asked two staff members in a row, and one person told us that we could sit in another place. This time the hotel booking was a complete failure.

msg:很少點評酒店，本人也不是梅子，真實評價。中秋假期，一家四口入住行政家庭房兩晚，本人情況比較尷尬，兩個娃，一個八歲到那裡都買半票，這無可厚非，另一個五歲，臨界值1.2米左右，這就比較尷尬。入住當晚從金頂下來，提前預訂，比較晚了入住，前台問了基本情況，我如實説了，交了較高的按金，在可理解與接受範圍，熊孩子嘛，閣誰都不放心。然後，匆匆忙忙泡了温泉，回來睡了。以下開始説重點:第一，房間特別乾淨，特別整潔，第二天也及時打掃，整理乾淨，當然了，兩個熊孩子嘛，有點亂，他們外出旅遊不在乎景點好壞，而在乎賓館能否看動畫片，住宿舒不舒服，大體我還是自己弄了的，比如娃娃喝的牛奶空盒，我還是放在垃圾桶的。第二，中秋假期，可能人比較多，早餐特別豐盛，我一向要求不高，一碗麪就可解決，娃娃高興慘了，我給的原則，可以誰便吃，但不能浪費，熊孩子進城，你們懂得，確實沒有浪費，但吃得夠嗨。第三，大娃玩歸玩，學習還是要的，房間燈光較暗，叫老婆到前台申請一個枱燈，一會兒就送來，相當感激。第四，退房，由於兩個熊孩子入住，雖然我一直控制他們的行為，能動的基本都動了，不能動的，堅決不能動，浴巾，浴袍基本用完，但有點説出來不準笑哈，小童牙刷，二娃帶走，摺疊梳子，大閨女帶走，其實家裡也不缺，也不是允許娃娃貪小便宜，就當留個紀念吧！退房時，前台説不耽誤您們時間，查房後，很快到賬，真的，一會就到賬，辦事效率真高，點贊。第五，停車師傅很盡心，帶娃吧，行李較多，節假日，停車難可以理解，工作人員很耐心引導。總之，本人睡過工地，也睡過草地，也住過賓館，這家賓館，服務很好，條件不錯，值得推薦。由於本人不喜歡拍照，主要是家人入住，我排照幹嘛呢，哈哈，望理解。
