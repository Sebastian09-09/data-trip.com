You can see the Yulong River from the balcony, and you can see many bamboo rafts floating on the river every day. It takes 5 minutes to get to Jiefang Bridge. There are many tourists watching the sunset on the bridge. It is also very convenient to rent a battery car nearby, 30 yuan a day. The room is large, the breakfast has a variety of varieties and tastes good. For dinner, it is recommended to eat the farmhouse dishes at the door for economical and delicious. It is about 15 minutes by car from Yangshuo West Street. The hotel shuttle bus is scheduled and fixed, so this section of transportation is not very convenient, especially for us elderly people with poor legs and feet. The short shuttle from the West Street Cruise Terminal to the hotel cost nearly 70 for 4 people (15 yuan per person for the scenic area battery car + 8 yuan for Didi taxi).

We only went to one scenic spot every day, and the rest of the time we were in a daze and watching the scenery by the river in the hotel or on the lazy bed on the balcony of the room. The hotel staff are very warm and friendly. The walking route recommended to us by the security uncle in the parking lot is really beautiful; another hotel employee brother also gave us a lot of travel suggestions. The sanitation is given four stars because of the bathroom in the public area. During dinner in the restaurant, the child suddenly wanted to go to the toilet, and the bathroom in the public area was really hard to describe. I hope it can be improved.

You can directly go to the lawn and Yulong River when you open the door. Haha 😄 The hotel also arranged free bicycle riding, ethnic costume photo taking and making your own mugwort baba. The restaurant staff also helped us put the excess baba in the refrigerator, and packed it for us to take back and share with our family when we checked out. It was so considerate! It left me with many good memories of my vacation. Thank you. I will stay here again when I come to Yangshuo next time!

The breakfast is very rich and tastes good. The room facilities are very old-fashioned. The air conditioner does not heat, so you can't come if it's cold. I really have to complain about the mattress. The three or four hundred homestays I stayed in didn't have this kind of mattress... This mattress is very hard and it really drags down the hotel. And there is no need to book a river view king bed room, because you can't see the river at all, you can only see the hotel's trees. The hotel said that the so-called river view room is the view of the riverside, not that you can see the river... Hahaha, okay, don't use this name to mislead consumers. Overall, it's still good if you like to sleep on a hard bed.

There are electric cars for rent at the entrance of the hotel, and you can walk about 100 meters to the tourist station, Gongnong Bridge, and Bamboo Pier.
Some of the hardware in the hotel is indeed a bit old, but it is still acceptable. The only complaint is that the mattress is too hard. I later asked for a smaller mattress, but it still cannot improve the quality of sleep. Friends with sleep problems should consider this before checking in.

Staying at the riverside is one of my thoughts when coming to Yangshuo. The service last time was very good and left a deep impression. This time I did not book online and went directly to the front desk to communicate. The three staff members on duty at that time, Xiao Zhang, Xiao Zhou and Xiao Long, not only provided We made a detailed introduction and took us to the room we were interested in to see the room type until we were satisfied. Hearing that we were regular guests, they applied for an upgrade. The lobby corridor was under repair, and Xiaolong specially helped us transport our luggage around the route again and again. Got to the room and was very grateful.

The hotel has an afternoon tea space on the outdoor lawn, and plugs are thoughtfully installed next to each table. We spent a very pleasant day there with music afternoon tea during the day and outdoor cinema picnic at night. It is an excellent choice for outdoor entertainment.

The hotel has a quiet and elegant environment. It is located on the bank of the Yulong River. The facilities and services are very good. It is the best choice for Yangshuo.

It occupies the best position on the Yulong River - the workers' and peasants' bridgehead, with easy access.
Extra-long private riverfront, large areas of greening, and low-density buildings;
The planning and details are not inferior to those of Southeast Asia’s seaside luxury resorts;
River-view rooms all have large balconies (of course you have to choose a room with Yulong River that is not blocked by trees, haha); the up-close view of the river is unparalleled;
The breakfast was very good and the parking was convenient. There was nothing to complain about.
I feel like I don't even want to go out when I stay in this hotel. I just sit in a daze on the balcony and look at the magical scenery of Yangshuo on the bank of the hotel's waterfront. It's enough. Fortunately, there is such a hotel to match such shocking beauty.
I would also like to express my special thanks to Manager Qin at the front desk for his enthusiastic service. He personally helped us choose a room that we were satisfied with. Seeing that we were a family of three, he took the initiative to give us a breakfast.
Next time I come to Yangshuo, I will probably stay here again, haha.

You can see bamboo rafts from the room, and walk about 40 meters out of the small garden to the Yulong River. There are also B&Bs with good locations, but there are not many where you can have breakfast in the hotel, listen to the chirping of birds, and watch bamboo rafts. Moreover, the service is not comparable to that of B&Bs. You can also relax in Yangshuo's hot springs, making Yangshuo a perfect choice for a leisure vacation with children.

The very warm and thoughtful service warms the lonely traveler. The hotel front desk upgraded the room for free.
         It was still him who sent me to Yangshuo Bus Terminal today. It was a short trip but full of affection. I am very happy to choose to stay at Yangshuo Yulong River Resort Hotel this time. I met all the new friends and received considerate and considerate service from the driver Mr. Wenfeng County. I felt his professional quality and serious attitude towards work. It is indeed an excellent hotel. Excellent staff😇🌷🌹🌿🌼🍀🌸🌳🌺🌲🌹☘️🌷🍀🌺🌿🌸🌴🏵️

I will recommend friends to continue to choose Riverside Resort Hotel in the future. I would like to thank the beautiful scenery of Yangshuo again for healing my sadness of losing my friend. I would like to thank the driver Xiaowen for his service before and after running in the drizzle. I would also like to thank the hotel for providing a clean and warm room.
(Turn on the room heater in advance. This year, when Yangshuo encountered a cold wave that has never happened in a century, my heart, which was chilled by the cold wind during the journey, felt the warmth of the hotel’s careful experience.)

Tonight, he walked with us and visited the hotel. He introduced us to the hotel, which has a total of 234 rooms. It is a Southeast Asian-style resort hotel. Celebrity Xu Beihong has been here.

The room is nice, large in size, and hygienic. You can dry clothes on the balcony.
The hotel restaurant is more expensive, so you can eat out or order takeout. The hotel has a free shuttle bus to Yangshuo Street, and reservation is required.
The hotel swimming pool is great, but there are more fallen leaves on the water surface and the cleaning is not timely. This is understandable, but the hotel should try its best to improve it.

msg:The hotel is very grand, and it is a beautiful scenery in itself, with mountains and water at its back, and a garden style. The service staff were very enthusiastic. Xiao Liang was the receptionist at the front desk and took the initiative to upgrade our room to a room with a direct view of the Yulong River. After checking in, the waiter Xiao Zhou took us to the room and introduced the hotel facilities. Other waiters we met on the way also took the initiative to say hello. The room is very big. There is a faint scent of jasmine as soon as you enter the door, and you are given welcome fruits. There is a bed on the balcony, where you can lie down and enjoy the hotel garden view and Yulong River up close. I thought that this kind of external bed would not be very clean, but it turned out to be a bit gray. None, you can rest assured. Some lights in the room are off, but it does not affect the overall lighting. Dry and wet are separated, the bath water temperature is suitable and the water volume is large, and a four-piece set for shampooing, hair care, bathing and skin care is more than enough. There is a dedicated dressing table and small dressing mirror, which is girl-friendly. The mattress is indeed a bit firm, but the support is good. I read other reviews saying that the facilities are old, but they are not. On the contrary, it has a sense of elegance from the past. Young people may like Internet celebrity B&Bs, but Internet celebrity B&Bs are the same everywhere. Only this kind of solid hotel is worth appreciating. The food in the restaurant tastes good. There were not many people eating dinner in the evening, but the chef's food was stable and at the level of a hotel, which is still different from farm food. The breakfast variety is also sufficient, taking into account both local and Guangzhou breakfast tastes. After looking around, the hotel also has conference rooms, and I think it is suitable for companies to hold meetings. I will recommend companies to hold meetings next time, haha.

It turned out that I got up early. Peasant women wash clothes by the river, bathe in the sun, and enjoy a sumptuous breakfast outdoors while watching the bamboo rafts passing by on the Yulong River...

He told us how to get there. The younger brothers and sisters at the front desk were also very enthusiastic. There was a car at the West Street Hotel at night. The driver, Master Wen, was super nice. Tell us the license plate number, we are not unhappy when we meet late tourists, and help to comfort the passengers waiting in the car. It is really great. After the three-day and two-night trip, we forgot something in the hotel after we left. The staff contacted me immediately and confirmed what it was. They also helped SF Express to mail it back. Because it was Chinese medicine that my mother drank, it was really reassuring to solve the problem in time. Special thanks to Lisa, Zhang Guoxiang, Xiao Lu, and Manager Qin for their warm service, because we have already left the store, but their service is not good. In the end, I will choose this place next time I come to Yangshuo. The hotel is very big, every place has a view, and the room is also big. What I like most is the cool bed on the balcony. In the morning, you can see people drifting. The trees are shady and the river is flowing. It feels very comfortable. At night, I lie on the bed and watch the stars. There are many stars and they are very bright. It feels romantic. The decoration is not very modern, but it is very comfortable. The sofas in the room are very comfortable, and the drinks in the refrigerator are also free. If I come again, I will definitely choose this place again.

The hotel is picturesque, surrounded by mountains and rivers, very much in the style of Southeast Asian hotels. We stayed in a river-view king-bed room, where we can see lush greenery, and we can see the bamboo rafts passing slowly on the Yulong River. Overlooking the rolling hills, the scenery is beautiful.

The location of the hotel is extremely superior. It is only a few minutes' walk to the pier where you can take the bamboo raft next to the Gongnong Bridge. You can rent a battery car when you turn right when you go out of the hotel. The hotel also has buses to and from West Street.

Service: The hotel waiter is a very shy young man, very nice, very enthusiastic to help us carry our luggage, and patiently explain the hotel's facilities and services to us. The master from Wenfeng County who picked us up was very enthusiastic and talkative, and told us a lot about the local customs. Because we came back late at West Street that night, the master waited patiently for us for an hour, thank you very much! And Xiao Zhang, Xiao Lu, and Xu Qiuyan at the front desk of the hotel, thank you for your thoughtful service!
In short, this hotel is very good in all aspects, and I will choose the Riverside Resort Hotel next time I come to Yangshuo!

Several buildings are connected by corridors, which feels a bit winding. Enjoy walking. The balcony of the room I booked can directly see the Yulong River, and the floating bamboo rafts pass by.

Free bicycle riding experience: The bicycle experience is very good and user-friendly. It should be more convenient to rent some trams. Who wants to ride a bicycle on such a hot day? You have to go to the front of the Gongnong Bridge to rent.
The service effect of this hotel is really catching up with Haidilao. The two bellmen, Xiao Li and Xiao Xu, greeted me warmly when I entered the door. After checking in, I immediately took the initiative to help carry my luggage to the room and carefully answered my questions about the route of the scenic spot. Really nice two brothers.

The most satisfactory thing is the drying rack, which is very practical for washing and drying towels during the journey. The hygienic situation is also good, the staff are very enthusiastic and answer every question, and the cleaning lady is also very responsible. The hotel is a bit remote, and it is almost impossible to get a taxi for travel, but it is suitable for people like us who are afraid of the heat and don't go out. The swimming pool is enough. The restaurant is not bad, it suits my taste, but the variety of breakfast is a bit limited, but the Guilin rice noodles for breakfast are good, light and tasty. After experiencing the shuttle bus, the driver, Master Wen, enthusiastically introduced the surrounding attractions. Overall, I am very satisfied with the hotel.

But the hotel arranged the room closest to the stairs. Then the hotel was frantically hosting groups and conference groups, and the chaotic management resulted in them being mixed in with tourist rooms. As a result, these group builders made unethical noises very early in the morning, destroying the beautiful environment and beauty of the resort, and turned it into a chaotic mess. Originally, the purpose of vacation was to enjoy being away from the hustle and bustle, but now being woken up by the birds has turned into being woken up by the rabble.

msg:Overall, it is not close to five stars. First of all, the service attitude is very average, and I feel that it is not very professional. The hotel facilities are generally good. The architecture and landscape are very beautiful, but the internal maintenance is not very good. One outlet of the air conditioner is broken. The toilet seat is not smart, and it is cold when sitting on it. The wifi signal in the room is not good either.
Those who stayed during the Chinese New Year holiday had a very high occupancy rate. It stands to reason that all kinds of services should be open, but the welcome afternoon tea in the lobby is actually gone. There are only two baby dining chairs in the entire hotel restaurant, and sometimes you have to wait for the dining chairs to have a meal. When you ask the waiter, the answer is that you have no choice but to wait. There is nothing on the balcony of the room. I asked the front desk for an outdoor table and chairs, and said there were no extras. I made an appoin**ent for the hotel's shuttle bus one day in advance, but was suddenly informed of the cancellation before departure. In short, almost any request can't be met, like staying in a budget hotel.
The only consolation is that the scenery is really good.

The Yulong River is in front of it. Sitting by the river and drinking tea is very pleasant. Cozy, the whole family, the elderly and children, had a great time. The only downside is that the hotel's breakfast variety is a bit limited, but this beautiful environment can completely ignore this shortcoming^^

msg:The first stop after unblocking, I was worried that I would step on the pit in the uneven Internet celebrity hotel, and finally decided to choose this hotel for two consecutive nights after reading the reviews of previous guests in terms of quality and location. It's really a treasure hotel, with Southeast Asian style, and the surprises are beyond expectations, especially the location is built along the Yulong River, covering a large and open area, with mountain and river views outside the window, a panoramic view, quiet and leisurely, with parking spaces a lot of. The size of the room is moderate, and the facilities are said to be old. I personally think that the simplicity is true. You can’t go wrong choosing this place for parents and children, taking care of the elderly and quality of life. After all, there is still a gap between publicity and popular homestays that have been seen along the way. The hotel is very convenient and close to various attractions, eating, and traveling to bamboo rafts. There is a shuttle bus to and from West Street. The driver, Brother Wen, has a good attitude. Next time, I will invite a few friends to live together, just because of the scenery outside the window, it is worth it🏝️🏝️
Things to be improved 1. The bed should be changed to reduce the living experience; 2. If the catering service is an environmental protection issue along the river, I will not comment

The scenery is very beautiful, but there is no trail on a section of the road. If you want to walk along the road, you can take a taxi to the trail and follow the Yulong River to the water. Eddie Wharf, then take a taxi back. There is a section of Yulong River in the hotel garden, where you can see the drifting bamboo rafts and the sister who is washing clothes in national costumes on the opposite side. When you go out of the hotel, turn right and walk for a while to reach the Yulong River Scenic Area. It seems to be the pier where the bamboo rafts disembark. The breakfast is very rich, and you can soak in a hot spring when you come back at night. Yangshuo is a place where you don’t want to leave after you come, and you want to come again after you leave~ I have the opportunity to stay for a few more days in the future

The hotel is on the bank of the Yulong River, but the river view king bed room I booked cannot see the river because it is blocked by trees. It was raining for the past two days and the photos were affected. It is recommended to watch the weather and go again when the weather is fine. There are beer fish everywhere in Yangshuo. You can try it, but the taste is not very special. It is quite expensive to eat one. It is said that the taste of each one is similar.

It is very close to the Shuierdi Wharf. It is very convenient to take a bamboo raft. During our stay, many staff members were 🐏 Yes, so the service can't keep up. There is no breakfast, which is a bit inconvenient. Also, some areas inside the hotel are under renovation, which is occasionally noisy, which makes people uncomfortable. If you like quietness, don't like the noise in the town, and want to take a good rest, you can choose this hotel. There is a hot spring pool. Although I know it's boiler water, the bubbles are quite comfortable

Although it is just a resort hotel in the traditional sense, it is located on the banks of the Yulong River and the Shili Gallery, but it has beautiful scenery, a large area, and an excellent sunset viewing point. It is also a place where you can slow down and get close to nature. A place of fusion. It is worth mentioning that during the epidemic prevention and control period, the hotel's humanized management, considering that there are many elderly people among the tourists, specially arranged for the driver to go to the county people's hospital for nucleic acid testing to help the tourists staying in the hotel to continue their lives and avoid unnecessary back and forth The tossing has won unanimous praise from everyone!

msg:I have never given a bad review before, but this time I really can’t complain. 1. The hotel facilities are old and the appearance looks pretty good. But when you enter the room, it’s really hard to describe. The air conditioning is in the 80s and 90s style, and you can hear the buzzing. The noise has little practical effect. The sheets are really the worst I have ever seen. It feels like it is about to collapse when you sit on it. When you lie on it, the whole mattress shakes when you move slightly. I don't believe the 17-year renovation on it. The mattress feels like it was renovated in 17 years. It's quite old.
2. The breakfast was amazing. It gave me goosebumps. There were small flying insects everywhere. I have never seen a hotel restaurant full of small flying insects. I originally wanted to toast two pieces of bread, but I haven’t picked up the tongs yet. I saw so many small flying insects on the bread, it makes me think about it now🤢
3. The service is hard to say enough. When I went to the front desk to check in, I saw someone in front of me waiting at the back. After two minutes, the front desk asked if I wanted to check in, and then I saw that the people in front of me were not customers but hotel staff chatting together. Haha, during dinner When the child fell asleep, I packed her food back to the hotel. I forgot to bring the tableware, so I called the front desk and asked if the tableware could be delivered. They agreed to deliver the tableware, but then nothing happened. The child waited for fifteen minutes before getting the coffee spoon. After eating, the meal was not delivered until the next day. You are not required to provide it. Even if you directly told us that there was no tableware, we didn't have to wait there. If it wasn't delivered, we wouldn't even call.
4. There is a dark and damp smell as soon as you enter the room. It is like a hotel in the 1980s and 1990s. I advise everyone to think twice. There are many choices. There is really no need to book here.

The location is excellent, along the Yulong River, 200 meters away from the Gongnong Bridge, courtyard-style design, the courtyard has a large range of activities, and the scenery is excellent. You can watch the bamboo rafts drifting on the Yulong River from the balcony of the room. The Gudu restaurant by the river has infinite scenery. Looking at the bamboo rafts of the Yulong River, the Fengwei Bamboo and the mountains have a great appetite...

On the second day of my renewal, Ctrip showed that there was also fruit. The second night didn't give me the fruit. Even though there was no shortage of such a few fruit, I felt uncomfortable, and there were only two kinds of fruit. .
The room facilities are a bit old, there is no place to charge the bed, and there are stains on the toilet seat in the bathroom. The bathroom of this room type I live in is easy to meet when the door is closed. Smell, I didn't sit on the sofa for two days, because I was lazy and defeated because of the trouble of packing my luggage. I stayed in this stinky foot room for two nights.
Desserts at the riverside at their own expense are overnight, and it may be several days. The blueberries on the desserts are wilted and they are sold (picture 1). Service charges are charged for that quality. The hotel's dinner was quite satisfactory. I only ordered two when I was traveling alone. The breakfast is average.

The riverside channel is not accessible to other places, and you can only walk along the river in the hotel. The outdoor pool is too big and feels unclean. There are many fallen leaves and insect carcasses in the water. The dinner restaurant doesn't open until 5 pm, so I didn't have time to experience it.
Suggestion: Take an online taxi for 2 kilometers to the resort hotel for dinner, and choose a riverside view. Drift to choose Ji Ma to Gongnong Bridge, there are relatively few people and the wharf is closer to the hotel.

We met the housekeeper Xiaoli at that time, followed the whole process, helped me with the baby, and was moved. Their service was very detail-oriented. Compared with ordinary five-star hotels, I think this hotel is aristocratic. I will choose this place next time without hesitation.

The service staff makes people feel like a spring breeze, and they greet everyone when they see it. The river has its own wharf, and the room is a bit old, but the old man felt that the bed was very comfortable, and the food in the restaurant was also very delicious. I think it's okay to take the old man's inn. It's right that the hotel is not an internet celebrity. We serve the people together. I have absolutely no regrets when I come to this hotel.

msg:The scale of the hotel is much larger than expected. It takes 20 minutes to walk around the hotel, and the vacation feeling is very full. In front of the mountains and rivers is the Yulong River, and the location is very good.
Service: The front desk is more enthusiastic, and the staff you meet on the road will take the initiative to say hello.
Facilities: The details are handled well. Although there are not many tourists due to the epidemic, the swimming pool changing rooms are still very clean. The price of the Chinese restaurant is affordable and the products are also good. I ate two meals, which is much more choice than the farms outside.
Room: The room on the first floor should be renovated. There are bamboo mats on the balcony to lie on. You can go directly from the balcony garden to the lawn outside and the Yulong River. But the bathroom is a bit smelly.
Generally speaking, it is very good. It is a relatively satisfactory part of our entire trip to Yangshuo. Compared with the Internet celebrity homestay, the creation of a vacation feeling is really much better. Although Ctrip's room-type upgrade hotel has not been upgraded, the overall shortcomings are not hidden. I hope the hotel can persevere under the epidemic 😁 There is also an early opening of the second phase of Six Senses, and I will come to experience it next time.

msg:Booked for three nights. It should be a luxury resort hotel that was delayed by the epidemic. The architectural style is very similar to that of Bali, and it is close to the Yulong River and next to the Gongnong Bridge. The location is excellent, but I heard that there are often Floods, the hotel has been flooded several times, so the musty smell is really a bit heavy. It is recommended to live in a room on the third floor, there is no smell, the hardware conditions can still reach the standard of a five-star hotel, the room is also very clean, and the quality of toiletries, towels and toothbrushes are all good. Very good, but the most important front desk service must be improved. It was a bit unpleasant to check in. On the day of check out, I met a small housekeeper, but he listened patiently and gave gifts before leaving. The price/performance ratio is still very good. It is still highly recommended to stay. I hope that the epidemic will end soon, and the business of the hotel will get better and better.

There was a little accident during this check-in because children also needed meal coupons. I was asked to let me down the night. When the child who was eating left the restaurant, I was in a bad mood all of a sudden. After communicating with @Ctrip, I got a solution. It's efficient and affected my mood. At least you tell me I can make up for a breakfast and let the child who is eating leave here. It's not quite right. Habitual praise. Next time I go to Yangshuo, I should change the place.

msg:This hotel is absolutely sorry for its price.
Before booking this hotel, I read some reviews, most of the reviews said that the hotel facilities are poor, the bed is hard or something. I usually only stay in fast hotels such as Home Inns/Seven Days, and have hardly stayed in any good hotels, so I think these reviews should be written by those who often stay in high-end hotels, and they are more picky. But I was wrong.
I booked a room on the first floor, and when I entered, there was a musty smell, like the smell of a ba*****t that has not seen the sun all year round, so I had to pay 200 yuan/day to upgrade to the upstairs, which is better , almost no musty smell anymore. Looking at all kinds of yellowed plastic parts and knob-type air conditioners, I said, OK, maybe this hotel has been around for a long time, and it's not that it can't be used, so I put up with it. Turning on the TV at night, the card was almost motionless, and the wifi was only a few tens of KB. This bed is so hard, it reminds me of the bed in a university dormitory, and my back hurts from sleeping on it. One night, I was bitten into three bags.
Stayed for 2 days, hey, it's really not worth it, it's not as good as Home Inn.

advantage:
- Good location, on the edge of Yulong River, there is a rafting pier, and there is a nucleic acid point 1-2 kilometers away;
-The hotel is selling well, and will help recommend routes, book tickets, and help coordinate when encountering problems.

shortcoming:
1. Poor service, it should be a hotel management problem, the waiters should not have received professional training, and the level of the hotel.
2. The room facilities are poor, no 5-star level at all.
- broken phone, broken toilet, broken scale;
- The rain shower room is not well sealed, and one who does not pay attention to the water floods the bathroom;
- The air conditioner is noisy and the sound insulation of the room is poor;
- no refrigerator;
- the bed is very hard;
- The room is damp, quilts, bath towels and towels feel wet;
- The floor tiles in the room are slippery due to humidity;
- There is a carpet under the bed, but it is dirty and feels like it hasn't been cleaned for a long time;
- There are many mosquitoes, especially on the top of the bathroom, and there are spiders on the ground;
- There is no master control for the lights in the room, they need to be turned off one by one, the lights are very dark;

It is recommended not to book the "Wake Up Room by Birds" recommended by Ctrip. The first floor is very humid and dark, but it is actually a "Wake Up Room by Mosquitoes". The overall cost performance is not high, but I heard that it is a relatively good hotel in Yangshuo.

msg:Checking in off-season, there are not many guests in the hotel, overall very happy and satisfied!

🚗 Transportation: It is very convenient, located at the core of Shili Gallery, along the main road along the river and very close to the nearby scenic spots. You can ride a bicycle and also have a tourist shuttle bus passing by. Leaving the starting point of Yulong River rafting and walking up to it, the end point is next to the hotel entrance

🧹Hygienic: The various services and hygiene of big hotels are much more in place than small guest houses.

🍃Environment: beautiful! The hotel itself is an attraction. Surrounded by mountains and rivers, looking up at the mountains, looking down at the river, I like this tropical architectural design, gardens, riversides, and beautiful scenery every step of the way.

🔔Service: There is still room for improvement. The service staff are very enthusiastic and take the initiative to greet people. It is said that the hotel’s business strategy is to B, focusing on receiving groups and holding banquets. If it is not for the off-season, it will not hold meetings with individual guests. Therefore, this mode of running volume is insufficient for the design of personalized and meticulous service.
❗️ There is no customer service dining service? ! 😩 ❗️ There is no customer service dining service? ! 😩 ❗️ There is no customer service dining service? ! 😩 When we asked for the afternoon tea to be delivered to the room, the waiters from the front desk to the restaurant were at a loss, and they looked up and said no. Finally, the waiter in the restaurant delivered the food to the room specially for us. thank you very much! But why can't such a high-end hotel even book a room?

🏨Facilities: There are many rooms in the hotel, and the design is very luxurious. The rooms all face the garden and look out at the Yulong River. They all have balconies and large bathtubs, but they are a bit old. The toilet tank in my room always leaks. The Mini refrigerator in the room has a cabinet but no machine. Drinks cannot be frozen. They can only drink hot. There is no charging socket beside the bed... But the furniture and lighting design and TV are not bad.

🍲Diet: The hotel kitchen is great! The price is reasonable and not much more expensive than the street farmhouse, the ingredients are excellent, and the taste is excellent. We all dine in the Chinese restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The freshly-fired flavors are great, Sichuan-style, Cantonese-style, and local Guangxi flavors are available. The breakfast is also rich in variety, and Guilin rice noodles taste so good! I like it very much.

I personally feel that it is much more comfortable than the surrounding so-called Internet celebrity homestays, and all kinds of supporting facilities are complete. Will come again in the future

In the end, the high-speed rail that I was planning to use was suspended and I was able to have breakfast, so when I told him that early in the morning, he said that he would enjoy breakfast.
It was a very nice front desk.
It is far from downtown, but recommended for those who want to relax in a quiet place.
In addition, the site was large, the view was good, and the rooms were beautiful.

Even during the National Day, you can stay away from the hustle and bustle. Compared with the Internet celebrity homestays in this area, the price/performance ratio is super high. The infinity pool is large enough and there is also a children's area. Due to the surrounding trees, it will hardly be exposed to the sun even at noon. The hotel staff has a very good service attitude, and the special requirements for complex reservations have been fully met. They also assisted in contacting the shuttle bus in advance, which made people feel warm. The food in the Chinese restaurant tastes very good, and the breakfast is also very rich. Fortunately, choosing this hotel during the National Day, let us enjoy an unforgettable vacation time!

msg:Because the epidemic has not been to Yangshuo for a long time, this time I took the children back to Yangshuo for the weekend. Staying at this hotel again, it is quiet and cozy, children can spend a day in the hotel without going to attractions. I really like the environment here. Built along the banks of the Yulong River, the architectural style is low-key and luxurious, blending with nature. We can sit in the restaurant by the Yulong River and have afternoon tea, watching the bamboo rafts drifting by, listening to the sound of the water, and hearing the folk songs of the raft workers and tourists running away, and staying there is an afternoon. At that time I thought of a sentence, "While watching the scenery, you have also become other people's scenery. The room is well maintained, it is no different than it was a few years ago. The staff are also very kind and will take the initiative to greet, and feel very simple. Hope to continue Keep, you will come to live in Yangshuo.

msg:The hotel is in a good location, right in the Shili Gallery Scenic Area, close to Yulong River and Gongnong Bridge. The surroundings are very quiet. A large resort is decorated like a private garden, with views of distant mountains and small rivers. The hotel has a garden pool with flowers and plants, which makes it feel like a holiday. . Every time I enter and leave the hotel, I feel very good, and there is often a feeling of people walking in the middle of the painting and Niaoming Mountain more secluded. Especially coming back from the noisy West Street, walking on the quiet hotel promenade and seeing a round of crescent moon hanging in the sky, it's so beautiful and so beautiful!

The hotel provides a butler service to help contact the ticket booking and shuttle driver, the price is reasonable and reliable! Went to the Ruyi Peak recommended by the hotel, it is really worth a visit!

The attitude of the hotel staff is very good, and it can be seen that the hotel is well managed. The child threw the transparent invisible braces on the napkin at breakfast, and only told the hotel the next day that he didn't have much hope that they could be found. The hotel staff just turned the braces out of the trash can (luckily there were not many tourists on this day), and also expressed regret that they didn't find it on the spot. I never thought it was a problem with the hotel. I was surprised that the staff was so responsible and I sighed that the service is so good!

Guilin travel chooses this hotel to make the play experience a lot of bonus points!

msg:This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in during my trip to Guilin, bar none.
Let’s talk about the advantages first: it’s right at the foot of the mountain and the hotel is very big.
Disadvantages: 1. The hotel is very old, the lights are very dim, and many conference rooms and other places are empty. In addition, the hotel is very large, and it is quite scary to walk outside at night.
2. No river view! It was off-season when I went there, and I booked a river-view king bed room. According to the hotel staff, they had arranged for me a room on the highest floor (3rd floor) with the best view, but because of the row of very tall and dense trees by the river, , so you can’t actually see the river view. I also glanced at it when the waiter on the first floor was cleaning the room. I couldn’t see the river on the first floor. At most, I had garden view and mountain view. If you want to see the river view, think carefully.
3. The room was originally quite big, but the facilities were old, the toilet was yellow, and very magically, there was a bathtub in the only open space in the middle of the room. I guess it is to imitate the Internet celebrity hotel, but this bathtub is placed in the bathroom and bed In the middle, no matter how you shoot, the film will not come out. Instead, people have to walk around the room, which is very annoying.
🚗 Transportation: The hotel is located in the Yulong River Scenic Area. It is three to four kilometers away from the scenic area and about eight kilometers to West Street. There are only buses going back and forth at night, not during the day. The hotel does not provide other meals except breakfast and afternoon tea, and there is nothing nearby. I don’t know how to think about food. If I want to go out, I have to call Didi.
Generally speaking, it is an old hotel, but the facilities are outdated and the service generally does not have a river view. It is not recommended to stay here. The hotels next to it either have good service or good scenery. This hotel feels like it has nothing but high prices...

The mattress is very hard, nothing new, I will never choose another series after staying once, and the service at the front desk is extremely poor. In the huge lobby at noon, there is only one female receptionist and one guy who stores luggage. The Chinese and Western restaurants are together, and I go to eat two dishes at noon I told you that you have to wait for more than half an hour, and there are only three tables of guests in the restaurant. Is there only one or two chefs in such a big hotel? Our room is next to the river, and there are a lot of mosquitoes. There is no mosquito repellent in the room, just a small bottle of toilet water. This price can live in a Marriott suite in Shenzhen.

但房間設施實在太陳舊，和照片差距太大。比如毛巾類的家紡用品，疫情後大部分酒店都置換新的了，這個酒店估計用的是舊的，毛巾軟趴趴不知道用了多少年了。浴室的淋浴墊都發黴了。房間黴味巨大，一開門差點窒息。明明客人提前預訂了房間，為什麼不提前開陽台門通通風，或者開空調通通氣，管理者就這麼完全不把客人當人。
房間佈局無語。沒有總開關，睡覺前要先在房間內四處關燈。
還有，每天晚上，樓上總是有人拖桌子椅子的聲音，一直有。真是住店也逃不過低素質噪音。
河景房基本都被樹擋了。

重點建議酒店改善房門關閉的聲音問題，閉門器閉合力度很大，晚上週圍回酒店客人的關門聲噼裏啪啦，極其糟糕，安裝減震墊或者更換閉門器成本不高，收費一千多一晚的酒店沒必要這麼吝嗇。周邊民宿的房間設備設施甩你們十幾年。
看看你們的吹風機，什麼年代的東西？
設施：非常陳舊，破舊。
攜程一千多這體驗極差。

提意見，是為了酒店重視，能夠改善，周邊雖然很多網紅民宿，作為規範酒店，還是要給大家更多基本信任感

1. 出行便利：門口這條路就是去碼頭和步道的路，酒店等於就在路口的位置。出門右轉就能借到電驢，沿路開超方便。然後出門右轉再右轉過橋就是碼頭終點，可以坐直達車到水厄底或驥馬碼頭。漂下來以後又到這裏，回酒店也超方便。

2. 安全感：酒店鬧中取靜，本身就超大風景好，保養得也很不錯，就像東南亞的度假酒店，晚上玩好回來很有安全感。説實話來的當天我還在糾結要不要退了住民宿，但住過江浙民宿天花板的感覺就是，房間是新的，但是管理還是沒法像酒店一樣標準化，泳池我也是不敢下的，且周圍環境很難控制。所以最後還是選擇了入住這個酒店，果然選擇是正確的。玩了幾天路過了好幾個之前想要訂的民宿，衹能説我太明智了！！！

3. 無敵泳池：很好很贊，泳池放心下，人很少，小朋友隨時玩很開心。

不足就是：房間真的老了！如果可以翻新，這個地段，標房賣到2000+毫無壓力！

然後陽朔真的沒啥好吃的，這兩天天天在酒店吃了，就圖一個乾淨方便，菜品雖少，但味道還不錯！

就是有些設施老了，比如非常大和美的泳池一半荒廢了，沒有工人負責收拾水中落葉。
還有個細節，就是一早吃完飯回來門鎖壞了進不去，修了一個半小時，過程中長者房卡找不到了，前台沒有就修門鎖耽誤客人時間有任何歉意，反而立刻提出一個房卡要賠50元。
還有提前一個月定的房，也坐了備註要的房間，辦理入住時前台以酒店週末接了會議團為理由，給了不好的房間，不明白就因為我們住四個晚上反而要給不好的房間。

大床房是兩個雙人床拼的，咯吱咯吱響，電視感覺得有十幾年歷史了，基本上都很難操作，想付費洗個褲子，結果説太臟了洗不乾淨又給退回來了，酒店沿河步道上發現死老鼠，一層花園帶草地工作人員，又告訴不讓上面踩，最搞笑的是最後一天要走，説來了哪一位領導，真是皇帝出行百姓讓路，我們在路上走着好好的，不讓走，給趕到上面的小路上去了，網約車都不讓進來，讓我等10分鐘再讓車過來，我説我要趕火車，他不理不睬！

定了三晚，入住第一晚，有張床的床墊凹陷，小朋友落枕，脖子痛了兩天。早晨告知服務中心和前台，要求換床墊，晚上22點回來發現床墊根本沒換。第二天到前台再次交涉，晚上回來發現換了張巨硬的床墊。不知道是換了一張硬床墊，還是就把床墊翻了個個兒。
第三天再次交涉，終於給我們換了間房。

老實講酒店的環境真的很好，依山傍水，可惜服務跟不上。總體體驗很差，不會再住。

酒店是國營的，所以標準化管理，員工也都很愜意怡然的樣子！雖然説實話，窗外的景觀沒有預期中完美，但作為園林酒店，已經很不錯了，而且我提出景觀不好，小夥子不厭其煩帶我看幾間房！弄得我都不好意思了！畢竟出門就是工農橋，很多人都自行車出行，邊上也有漂流。
房間雖有年數，但很乾凈整潔，特別感謝一下幾名服務人員：穿梭巴士的文師傅，服務周到，熱情健談，很為顧客着想！為此行我們緊張的行程規劃完美！還有客房的劉桂明師傅，微笑服務，名字不知記錯沒？餐廳員工們也很禮貌。
總之，下次來遇龍河我一定還選這家！去了福利那個酒店，本來也作為選項的，外觀來看真的不能比。
對了！一定要誇一下小童樂園！真心好！

唯一可以改進的地方就是早餐可以再豐富點，另外暑期小朋友比較多，補餐的速度可以再提升一些。
總體上絕對是陽朔性價比最高的酒店，以後再來一定會在選擇住這裏。

msg:2008年第一次到陽朔時這家酒店正在修建中。當時已經覺得在玉龍河畔有這麼一家酒店佔據了極好的位置。這次故地重遊，就選擇了這裏。
酒店的佔地面積還挺大。從1號樓到9號樓，都是三層的小洋房，樓層都不高。
我們這次選擇的是特價房，都位於一樓。原以為一樓的房間不好。沒想到還是讓我們驚喜。我們的房間正好位於游泳池旁邊，從房間的陽台出去直接走到游泳池。非常方便。
最意想不到的是，酒店自帶的中餐廳，出品相當不錯。第一天晚上的黃燜雞，配上極其入味的竹筍，直接光盤。第二天晚上，點了咕嚕肉、酸溜土豆絲、香芋扣肉和艾葉餈粑，都相當的美味。尤其是香芋扣肉，荔浦芋頭和五花肉的神奇組合，配上腐乳還有各種香料，濃郁的口感，讓人脣齒留香，回味無窮。沒有來得及拍照，就已經把扣肉吃完了😂後來問前台師傅，他説火候非常重要，他説衹有足夠的耐心，不要催促，師傅才可能就可以做出美味的扣肉。回想起來那天，我們是最後一桌客人，我們也沒有催促的意思，慢慢等待，結果慢工出細貨，吃上了最地道的香芋扣肉。盛讚👍👍👍
但也有不足的地方，淋浴間的擋水條太淺，幾乎擋不住水，一家人游完泳輪流洗完澡，衞生間幾乎一地都是水。第一天晚上我們還讓服務員來拖地，小孩因為急忙去開門給服務員，沒有穿拖鞋，還滑倒了。第二天就懶得處理了，大家都穿上拖鞋。希望這一點能得到改進吧，也許在不久的將來我們還會再去一次。

msg:幾年前在遇龍河上漂流發現這家酒店，從此便種了草，這次特意來拔草，但是一言難盡！
地理位置：絕對優秀，就位於工農橋漂流終點附近，面對遇龍河道，附近並無第二家類似的度假村！
入住：鑽石會員權益10點後可入住，11點左右到達，結果沒有房，説房間沒打掃完畢，後續入住發現所在房間這一層僅有我這一家房入住，並沒見到隔壁房間在打掃，所以提前入住權益等於空；套餐裏説每日大學中式歡迎茶點1份，酒店根本沒有提起；所謂贈送服務5項，其實是入住人員都有，並不是什麼套餐獨有，所以訂不訂套餐都一樣。
房間：攜程套餐大法好，“被鳥叫醒雙床房”不知道是攜程創作還是酒店創作，其實就是一樓園景房，酒店最普通的房間，而且所有一樓房間電話都是故障的，如果要叫酒店服務要麼自己打手機要麼走去大堂，真是@%#@%！￥#%#￥%；被分配在8號樓，從大堂走到8號樓耗時6-10分鐘，同時僅僅在大堂、7號樓、9號樓處有電梯，並且行李員説7號樓電梯故障，徒手拎行李箱搞定。
設施：酒店有很好的硬件底子，但是維護不佳，房間裏的小毛小病不少，電話都是故障的，叫來維修人員説都是壞的，修不好的；主泳池維護，前台説有幾個月了，衹開健身房上面原温泉的小泳池；小泳池水不知道多久沒換，泳池服務除了救生員在看着，其他一概沒有，沒有水、沒有浴巾，沐浴房裡燈也是不開的，感覺並不歡迎住客使用；小泳池邊上應該原來是温泉設施，十幾個池子沒有一個不是壞的；古渡餐廳前台説晚上開張，中餐廳説晚上也衹提供飲料，而且表示蚊蟲多，一般不開；唯一好的是酒店的園林，園林還是能看出這個酒店的美麗。
服務：服務人員都很有禮貌，很客氣，但不一定能解決你的需要；入住時，拎着大包小包大箱小箱，並沒有人來答理我們，直到辦完入住，自己要求行李員幫忙拿行李；沒有最基本的泳池服務；套餐裏的服務都是住店默認的，不需要買套餐。
提醒：如果有選擇，千萬不要一樓的房間，每年桂林都有水災，地勢低的樓棟一樓會被水淹（酒店服務人員透露）。
總得來講，真得為酒店感到可惜，有很好的硬件底子，有絕佳的地理位置，但是自己把自己做廢了，膽白講以現在的情況而言，並不推薦。希望酒店能好好整改，強化硬件維護、提升服務水平，希望下次來陽朔能成為我的首選。

How much a child can eat, and a room is only one person's breakfast, it doesn't take long for brain design. The room was still damp. Would a broken county cost more than 600 a night? Are you worthy of this price?

msg:During the eleventh period, the price rose faster than the rocket, directly doubling, without notifying customers in advance. The attitude is also not good. One day I had something to delay the check-out. At around 5 pm, I called and communicated with them, hoping that they would not deduct my fee. Their indifferent tone was like a crematorium. There was only one sentence , with only one tone: Sorry, half the room rate will be deducted before six o'clock, and the full price of the room will be deducted after six o'clock. At that time, I was so blocked, it was like a road in Yangshuo. Of course I know the rules of the hotel, the rules of the hotel are like this, am I negotiating with you? I think checking out at that time will not affect your secondary sales, so I will communicate with you. Alas😮‍💨The attitude is hard to describe. In short, if you go to Yangshuo again, only this hotel will be left. I'd rather pitch a tent than stay again.
