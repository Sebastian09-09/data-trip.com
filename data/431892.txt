I love the location, but I think that was my last visit to Hotel Nikko. I even checked a night early and took a loss on a prepaid room. That's how miserable it was in the room

msg:The staff at the front desk were really kind and English was also comfortable. The room was spacious enough and comfortable, especially with a bidet in the bathroom. However, I stayed on the 10th floor, but it was a little disappointing that the room with a bad view of the building in front was blocked, and I turned on the heating, but the cold wind kept coming out, so I asked for a separate heater, so it was less cold. Hotel facilities such as saunas and restaurants in the hotel have great convenience like a global brand five-star hotel, especially because it is located in the center of the city, so it was very convenient wherever you went. The hotel was famous, so the taxi drivers quickly found the location and arrived quickly. I am thinking of using it again when I come to Dalian next time. Thank you for your warm hospitality.

The room was spacious and very well kept. I completely disagree with some reviews mentioning the hotel was old and not really 5 stars. The hotel is not brand new but it doesn't matter at all, plus they gave a great room discount probably to offset the unfair reviews they received from previous travelers.

I will definitely stay again next time I am in Dalian.

I can see the hotel's continuous efforts. The transportation is convenient, and Russian Street, Zhongshan Square, and Dalian Station are all within walking distance. The breakfast is rich in variety, including grilled steak, Lanzhou beef noodles, Guangdong meat buns, etc. I heard that chefs were specially called from all over the country to make it. The service is also good, and I feel the professional awareness of the hotel waiters. It is worth recommending!

The hotel was as warm as home. Manager Liu and Manager Zhao at the front desk warmly received us and upgraded our room. We have been playing here for many days, and they helped us renew this room and register as members. The room has the same Japanese service style as always, with great attention to details. Every detail shows consideration for the guests. The bathroom is fully equipped, and the smart toilet, shower and bathtub reflect the Japanese meticulousness everywhere. I am very satisfied. The hotel is conveniently located and there are many places to eat around. The Russian style street is within walking distance.

msg:I booked the Nikko Hotel in a hurry. The one I originally booked was completely unacceptable to me, but it gave me a good experience from the beginning of my stay. There was a team on that day (Chinese Sports Association Football Game), but the little sister at the front desk upgraded me to an executive room. I didn’t write this review specifically because of the room upgrade, because it made me feel like a real hotel (the hotel environment I always wanted). The hotel should have been open for more than 20 years, but from every detail of the hotel, you can see the long-term vision of the owner and management for the opening and operation of the hotel. The floor of the room is still solid wood flooring, warm like going home, the whole room is lit with warm yellow lights, gorgeous and elegant but warm like home, the shower room is small, but still well maintained, there is no moldy rubber *****, and the shower head is still 90% new. The bath products are still small bottles, very comfortable and high quality, (completely beat IHG’s so-called luxury high-end brand KIMPTON... 10,000 words of complaints about Suzhou Kimpton are omitted here). The service staff is polite, and they can use sealed boxes to deliver ice cubes. They clean the room in every corner in detail. The most important thing is that your bath towels are so soft and great, which beats 95% of domestic hotels.
If I come to Dalian again next time, I will definitely not book another hotel. I hope to experience the unique warmth and rigorous hotel environment of Japanese management hotels again. Thank you all for your efforts. This is not a one-day thing. I believe it is the hotel management and business philosophy that has been continued by the entire Nikko Hotel for more than 20 years. I wish you a prosperous business. Come on!

The room layout is different from that of ordinary hotels. The entrance porch is on the floor and the inside is carpeted.
There is a bathtub and a smart toilet.
Perhaps due to its age, there is an unpleasant smell in the room. It is recommended to install an air purifier in each room.
The hotel elevator is very noisy. It seems to be a Mitsubishi elevator. The thumping sound is a bit scary.
The service attitude of the front desk and concierge is not very friendly and very stiff. I hope it's just a random occurrence that I've had bad luck with. Regardless of whether those speaking foreign languages ​​or Mandarin, they should be treated as guests first and treated with enthusiasm.

But if you spend 1,000 yuan a night to stay in a hotel during the peak tourist season, you will feel unfair. The room has a closed window, but I personally prefer to be able to open the window. Breakfast also includes fried steak, pork chops, fish steaks, mackerel, and noodles are also good. But I don’t think there’s anything delicious in Japanese food. The hotel's wellness center is pretty good and the water temperature of the swimming pool is very comfortable, but the quality of the bath towels in the locker room is too poor. The hotel actually has a sightseeing elevator, which only stops on the 1st and 30th-35th floors. It’s so cool! I also hope that shower gels and shampoos can contain plant ingredients.

The glass door of the shower room is spotless, the shower head has a sufficient amount of water, the towels and bath towels are soft and comfortable, and the room temperature is suitable. The service staff was very friendly and the doorman helped carry the luggage all the way to the room. The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. Will continue to stay.

msg:The room was very clean and equipped with all the equipment. But the air conditioner didn't work, so I called the repairman. He said that the weather was getting warmer and there were fewer customers, so they controlled the air conditioner and water temperature to save money. Since the air conditioning was not good when I checked in last time, I asked the front desk for an electric heater in advance. However, the electric heater kept beeping at around 2 o'clock in the middle of the night and I turned it off. I successfully caught a cold 😷, swallowed a razor blade in my throat, and pregnant women can’t take medicine yet. I hope your company will consider it. When you save money, our customers also spend money.

msg:For the big name of JAL, it is a five-star hotel! Eye-popping. The hotel is very old, the facilities are very old, the elevator is rattling, there is a musty smell when you get out of the elevator, the room layout is even more incompetent, the toilet is behind the bathroom door, the table is stuck in the corner of the pillar and the wall, and the bathtub is very small. There is no self-service laundry room. As an old five-star brand, not to mention the perfect facilities, the maintenance is not in place.

The hotel breakfast is basically a cold meal. The swimming pool is very small, and the depth of the swimming pool is 1.7m-1.9m. It is afraid that tourists will enter the water. It is really hard to say.

Service, not to mention smiling and welcoming, the staff at the door did not step forward to help with large luggage, and saw the Japanese bending their waists to their knees.

It is the first time to live in JAL, and it is also the last time, a lifetime of darkness! Everyone avoid the pit!

Many of them are Japanese-style and can’t be used. We can only ask the front desk to borrow a power bank. The better thing is that the water pressure of the shower head is sufficient, and the bath is comfortable. The toilet has a washlet, which is convenient and hygienic. The service at the front desk is okay. Mr. Li and Mr. Yang at the front desk are more serious and responsible in storing luggage and car rental keys. The breakfast is too bad, there are few styles, and the taste is not good. Children need to be charged as long as they are over 1.1 meters. It is very true, and the price/performance ratio is too low. Overall quite disappointed.

When I opened the curtains, I found that I could see the port in the distance from the small corner of the window. When the weather was clear, I could see the sea through the dusty glass. The sea view room mentioned when booking was definitely not false advertising.
On the desk, there was a billboard saying that it was 699 yuan a night and also came with executive benefits and free afternoon tea. The small print indicated that it was not applicable from April 29 to May 2. Always remind you that you are the big loser who paid two or three times the price to stay during the May Day holiday. This feels great👍
There is no Chinese on the service phone. It is really an international hotel, but who made me not study hard when I was a child, and I am only half-level. I can only press 0 based on experience. After a long beep, someone finally answered the phone. This is the first time I call the service desk when I stay in a hotel, which makes me feel the feeling of waiting for the call to be connected. Others answer the phone after 2 or 3 beeps, which is too boring.
The room service staff was very enthusiastic. Seeing that our children had reminded us of the weather in Dalian, they gave us extra water and slippers. The service was very thoughtful. If I choose Nikko Hotel again next time, it must be because of that lady.
The staff in the buffet restaurant are more serious than those in other hotels. They will let the children compare their heights on the wall one by one. I like their work attitude👍
Zen Japanese Restaurant is delicious and inexpensive. The waiters are handsome and the women are beautiful. The environment is elegant. It is really a good place to eat, but don't order egg custard. If it is in the set meal, just give it up decisively, otherwise you will have to wait for a while. It is no exaggeration to say that the waiting time that day was enough to go back and forth to the Russian Style Street.
The parking lot is crowded, so you can go directly to B2.
Oh, by the way, this stay is absolutely worth it. The sound show was given as a gift. The first night was at eleven o'clock, and the midnight singing was heard. The rhythm was clear, and it felt like lying at the door of a KTV with poor sound insulation. At three thirty in the morning of the second night, I don't know if it was upstairs or next door, a battle between heaven and man, panting, howling, fierce and exciting! I heard this kind of sound show at Home Inn ten years ago.
This is the first time I wrote a review as a short essay. Hotel Nikko Dalian is great!

msg:I remember that the first time I stayed at Dalian Nikko was in 2014. At that time, because it was a group meeting, it was full of meetings. I didn’t observe the hotel carefully except for eating and sleeping. After a lapse of 9 years, I am used to living in the InterContinental and came back again, wanting to experience the difference. It is very convenient to walk along Minsheng Street to Zhongshan Square Subway Station, which is only half a mile away in a straight line. When I checked in, I was surprised by the details of the room arrangement at the front desk. Not only did I ask if I smoked, but I also asked about my favorite orientation and the view from the window. This is rare in my many years of check-in experience. of. He even recommended me the small suite package of JAL's spring promotion based on my question about the details of upgrading the suite, and invited me to join the JAL membership for free. The room is not too big (compared to the InterContinental), it can be seen that it is old, and the room facilities have shown signs of age, but the maintenance is good, and the cleaning work is very meticulous. The smart toilet in the bathroom is really good, and it is easier to use than the one equipped by InterContinental. There are plenty of bottled water. It was almost 11 o'clock in the evening. After I purchased the small suite package, I specially called the hotel front desk to inquire about the usage details. The call was quickly connected and I was given a satisfactory answer. The hotel is located on Changjiang Road, and there are many restaurants to choose from around. You can basically find the supermarkets, food and even 🎦 you want within half a mile or so. Because it is an early shift ✈️, I haven't had time to appreciate the breakfast level, and I look forward to the next time. To talk about the shortcomings, the only thing I feel at the moment is the elevator. It is probably because it is loud and the car vibrates when it is running for a long time.

The outside temperature is very low, but the heating in the room is enough to sleep at night without any problem, but it will be slightly cold sitting by the window during the day. The water temperature in the shower and bathtub is not enough, and the temperature will suddenly drop, so that I have not been warm enough to take a bath. The hotel is a bit old school, but the location is good, there are many izakaya downstairs, and the price is reasonable. It is very convenient to go everywhere. Because it is too close to the living area, the sound of firecrackers and fireworks downstairs can be heard even at 7 am and 12 midnight on the 21st floor. It's really interesting.

The breakfast is very rich, delicious egg patch, miso, natto, grilled fish fillet, chocolate mousse, very full, and the coffee is ground with very good beans. You can't drink such quality anywhere else. Many small electrical appliances in the room are imported, and the management and service of the hotel cannot be experienced elsewhere. The Japanese set meals in the restaurant on the third floor are cheap, large in quantity and variety, and the taste is more pure than that of ordinary Japanese food stores.

The biggest highlight of this hotel, in my opinion, is the breakfast buffet, but now the variety of breakfast has been reduced a lot, there is no cake at all, only a small amount of bread.
The sanitation is relatively average. On the day of check-in, I saw hair in the tray where the sanitary ware was placed on the sink, and in the next few days, even after cleaning every day, the hair was still not removed.
On the day of check-in, the soap tray slipped from the countertop into the washbasin, and it was broken in half at once, and I lost 45 yuan. I don't know if this small ceramic tray has cracks before? It didn't fall to the floor, it just slid into the washbasin and broke. And I think this little soap tray is worthless, 20 at most.
During the check-in, the elevator was broken, so I had to take the freight elevator in the end.

Looking at the room information, it is only 100 yuan more than Biado, but the area is about 20 square meters larger, so I decisively returned Atour and changed to JAL. The point is that the price is relatively reasonable, but when we drove from Shanghai to the hotel, the lady at the front desk and the little brother heard that it was so far away, so they quickly checked to see if there was any vacancy. As soon as they found a higher-level room, they immediately upgraded us, allowing us to go smoothly Checked in early, and enthusiastically asked us if we wanted coffee. The overall aspect is very large. There is a writing desk and a small living room in the layout. It's very good. It feels like I went back to the time when I lived in a luxury hotel 10 years ago.

First of all, it is best not to come here in summer. There are no windows that can be opened on the 28th floor. The air conditioner is really not working, it can't cool down at all. Then because the room is full, there is no way to change it.
Then my door lock was broken, and the waiter couldn't open it with his card. I called the deputy manager at the front desk to fix it for me, and it took more than half an hour for me to come. After I came, the service attitude was not good. I turned my head and left before I finished speaking. Then the next day I said I was coming to fix it, but I didn’t come to fix it, and I was locked out of the room for 45 minutes at night (it was worse than last time.)
The elevator is very slow. I tried to wait for 20 minutes to go down from the 28th floor to the first floor during the morning rush hour.
The operator who answered the call from the switchboard seemed to be inexperienced. The request made by the tenant had to be called three times before it was dealt with.
There are many varieties of breakfast. But the restaurant staff is poorly trained. When we have breakfast, we will send a meal card, and then there is a statement on the back that you can turn the card over to the end of the meal when you leave. Many times it was clear that there was a dining sign on my table, and I took it away. I asked the waiter and said confidently, "We will take it away if you are not here. That card is useless."
Then there is also the problem of sanitation. There is also a band-aid used by a resident on the back of the chair.
In the end, the front desk deliberately gave wrong information when checking in, saying that this hotel is owned by ANA. He thought I had "little knowledge" and didn't know that Japan Airlines and ANA were two different companies, so he came to fool me and said that there was no discount.
Finally, I would like to say that before the epidemic, I often stayed in the local Nikko Hotel on business trips to Japan, and I have a good impression of Okura Hotels. Originally, I wanted to book Nikko Dalian Hotel to entertain Japanese guests in November this year. Fortunately, I actually came once, and I didn't fall into ambush. To entertain Japanese guests at this level, I think it is really unsatisfactory. Or Hilton is better.

Some old TVs in the facilities could not be displayed at first. Later, the staff was called and found that the signal line was not plugged in. The bed was a bit hard and I didn't feel very comfortable when I got up in the morning. The hotel has a gym but the facilities are a bit old. The swimming pool did not go to the introduction and said there are. It is more convenient to eat around, after all, it is in the center of Zhongshan District. The breakfast is ok, Chinese, Western, and Japanese, and there are many varieties.

msg:The front desk and room service are very good. It may be due to the old hotel. The underground parking lot is dirty, and the road leading to the hotel elevator is bumpy and dirty. There are two large columns in the room. The writing desk is hidden behind one column and the other side is close to the bed. It is particularly inconvenient to get in and out. The room is full of glass curtain walls, no windows, stuffy. The most important thing is that the small refrigerator in the room is plugged in (the electric plug is hidden behind the heavy cabinet and cannot be unplugged). Because of the age, the low-frequency noise is uncomfortable. I hope the hotel can take away the useless refrigerator or replace it with a new one. The most commendable thing is that the bathing equipment is excellent, and the toilet has heating and flushing functions. People who have higher requirements for hygiene will like it very much.

網上的訊息我想説除了地理位置可以以外，其餘的方面都讓人很不舒服。
首先，初入酒店，電梯等待時間久得離譜，畢竟是老酒店了也就理解了。
其次，29號和2號的房間衞生幾乎等於沒有清理，衹收了垃圾桶裏的垃圾以外，被子疊的亂七八糟，沐浴露不更新，地上的頭髮不清理，補給水也是亂放，所有的一切都讓我覺得幾乎等於沒有搞過衞生。
然後，每天早上都會有阿姨敲門問你搞不搞衞生，一部分有我自己忘了放請勿打擾的牌子在門口，另外一部分是我覺得沒必要每天9點多就來敲門吧。
最後，這個衞生服務我真的想再吐槽一遍！可惜我沒拍圖！真的很讓人生氣！

總體來説，服務非常貼心，早餐很符合我的個人愛好，可以給出好評。

就這樣吧，畢竟現在也很便宜。床是舒服的，淋浴（雖然噴頭調節壞了）也算滿意。門僮也很專業，曾經的風範多少還剩點兒。

離店時候衹能去前台退房，和入住的人一起排隊等。讓酒店的前台開發票，衹開房費不給開餐費，我就在前台旁邊打開發票。跟他説少了早餐的金額。她還非常不耐煩，説她知道。。。那就是故意少開金額的？
手機拍照了開票訊息説過後補給我，已經兩天了，也沒有補。無語
