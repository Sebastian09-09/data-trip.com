The room came with a cloakroom and was very comfortable. The soundproofing was also very good, and we couldn't hear any noise at all. The only thing we were not very satisfied with was that the breakfast was not very delicious. Next time I go out, I will choose this hotel again.

But I just took a shower in the afternoon and dried my hair. It was really unbelievable. The two women were joking and swiping their cards to come in. I asked her how she came in and who she was looking for. After she asked me the room number, she said oh, turned around and left. Well...she just left, leaving me dumbfounded. Later, the hotel called the surveillance camera and said it was the cleaning aunt, but didn't the aunt knock on the door first? Moreover, she didn't bring any cleaning tools. Reminded us that the hotel management is really not as good as we thought. It‚Äôs terrible. We will have to lock the door after entering. It‚Äôs really scary.

It was not too early when we arrived. The lady at the front desk saw that we were bringing a baby and took the initiative to upgrade our room type to a double room with a bathtub and a lot of space! Very comfortable. The overall environment is also very hygienic.
I also went for a swim downstairs smoothly. It was very convenient. Someone was supervising the safety of the swimming pool throughout the whole process, which was very reassuring. Children should remember to bring their own swimming ring.
The breakfast is also very rich. There is no price increase on a holiday like New Year's Day. The quality is nothing to say. Decisively, we continued another night.
Thanks to Miss Effyy for her patient and enthusiastic service ~ Recommended ~

When I returned to the room after breakfast the next day, the key card failed. After I went downstairs and asked the front desk to handle it, I still couldn't swipe the card to enter the room. Returning to the front desk again, we were told that we accidentally pressed the "anti-lock button" (it didn't happen at all), and asked the engineering depar**ent to go upstairs and open the door. As a result, the engineering depar**ent said that the degaussing operation was performed incorrectly by the front desk...
Internal contradictions caused a long delay, which resulted in me being late for meetings and having a very indifferent attitude at the front desk.
Personally, I think it‚Äôs inappropriate for Marriott‚Äôs hotels to have such a situation.

here.
We came to a friend's house as a guest, and this hotel is near the friend's house. If you come to Hangzhou for tourism, living here is indeed a bit out of the way.
But the hotel is still good, the room is very big, the bed is very comfortable, the single bed is 1.3 meters wide, it is no problem to bring a child to sleep. The room is very
Neat and tidy, the cleaning was also timely. The breakfast is rich, both Chinese and Western food, and the dining environment is also very large, but it is not available at 9:30, which is a bit early.
There are basically no convenience stores, pharmacies and places to eat around. There is a Li Bai Library restaurant downstairs, which is quite famous. Living here is for business or business trips. Traveling here is good, but traveling is still inconvenient.
The price is still very favorable.

This must be severely punished in our own hotel, but we still give good reviews habitually. They are all hotel people. Paying attention to details is always better than the occupancy rate ,come on

In fact, the room is very small, and the various facilities are not five-star at all, so they will meet three-star standards. The gym was also not in use. The breakfast content is very small and very simple. Usually, I can only choose Li Bai Library restaurant for meals, and it is closed after 8:45 pm, and there are no restaurants within two kilometers around. There is not even a bellman at the door. Maybe it was because the hotel just opened and the facilities didn't have the conditions at all, so it started to operate. The overall stay felt very, very poor. The menu is from Li Bai's restaurant, and the price is not cheap.

The service is too bad, I checked in that night, and agreed that breakfast would be delivered to the room at 7:00 am tomorrow, because there was no place to eat breakfast at all. At 6:50 am, I contacted and called the front desk, but no one answered at the front desk. By 7:30 am, the guest ran to the front desk. I just met the front desk clerk, and the result of the communication was that the breakfast was not delivered to the room until 7:29, and the guest arrived at Yungu School for the exam at 7:45, which caused the exam to be 20 minutes late, causing a major negative impact. The washbasin was broken and no one repaired it; 4. It is strongly recommended that Ctrip cancel the reservation service of this hotel. 5. This kind of hotel is very harmful and tarnishes the brand of West Lake University.
