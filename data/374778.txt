I'm glad I read the reviews and had the eggs benedict, well worth it. The bed was super comfy. I can't say much about location because we stayed there for the marathon and that's where the bus was leaving from, but I'd definitely come stay again.

this is a good property and is very clean.

located in about 20-30 minutes subway ride to Tiananmen, it is closer to auditors and business specialist buildings.

i asked a taxi price for a transfer to Beijing Chaoyang railway station and was quoted 660 renminbi, which is about 100 US dollars for about 4 subway stations ride + 25 minute walk.

Ordered the room service for the dinner, and the quality of the food was so far from a normal standard.
Windows that let the cold air come in the room, and I had to stop it by using paper.
In the end, or they re-decorate and re-study the quality process, or they have to decrease the price.

The room equipment is old, but it is well maintained. The bathroom should be renovated. The whole thing is relatively new. I am not satisfied with it. It's the TV and the remote control. It's really difficult to use. The remote control has poor contact. It takes three or four times to press it before it responds. The TV is also an old-fashioned Philips flat-screen TV with very poor picture quality. I hope the hotel can report it to the management and replace it, otherwise it will It affects the quality of the hotel, and it will also affect the quality of Marriott. The service staff is very polite, and they take the initiative to say hello when meeting, which is very good. The only thing is that the work efficiency is too slow. I don’t know the reason. There is no executive lounge in my room. It was a courtesy, but I called the guest service center to report the purchase of the lounge privilege. They were told that the staff would give me a new room card and it would be delivered to the room soon. However, I waited for nearly 40 minutes. It didn't arrive in the room for an hour. In the end, I went to the front desk to update the room card, hoping to do things efficiently. The room phone number did not remind the guest service center which number to press, and there was no phone number for the lounge. In the end, I still I went downstairs to the front desk and asked for the phone numbers of the guest service center and the lounge. It was very inconvenient to provide guest consultation services. I hope you can be more careful and considerate in making a sign next to the phone. Overall, it is okay. I hope it will get better. Improve these loopholes in a timely manner

Several operators said that the hotel would not issue an invoice for Ctrip's reservation, and they were obviously discriminatory! The order clearly states that the hotel will invoice. If you don’t want to cooperate with Ctrip, don’t cooperate. Is this necessary? The account cannot be settled. No tickets have been issued yet.

Not only did they upgrade to the executive room for free, but they also provided excellent room service and luggage storage. I will choose Renaissance R&F when I stay in a hotel in the future. I sincerely recommend it to a five-star hotel!

The hotel's fitness equipment is sufficient. Because it was winter and I had to wear a swimming cap, I didn't go to the swimming pool.
The room is large and suitable for one person, but the hygiene can be improved. In addition, the water in the toilet and shower room is not good, and the water level is very high after taking a bath, so you can soak your feet.
Because there are many restaurants nearby, I haven't tried hotel dining.

The breakfast variety needs to be increased. It is too simple. Although there are Chinese and Western food, I feel like there is nothing to eat. The coffee is good , all freshly ground coffee and juice are also freshly ground. There are no paper towels in the room, only in the bathroom. I hope there can be some on the bedside of the room. The pillows in the hotel are also uncomfortable. I hope they can be improved.

Second, right next door to Shadian is R&F Mall, which is convenient for shopping, eating, and watching movies. Third, it only takes eight minutes to walk to Shuangjing Subway Station, which is convenient for going to the airport or walking around in Beijing.
It would be perfect if the hotel could understand the difficulty of traveling for business travelers and provide free simple breakfast. Hope to get a response!

msg:I have always liked the Renaissance R brand hotel. This time I stayed at the Renaissance Beijing R&F and left a deep impression on me. The reason for the early arrival of the flight was that I called the front desk in advance and asked if I could check in early. The little girl Zoey was very enthusiastic. Let the housekeeping depar**ent clean up a room in a hurry, check in smoothly in advance, and send welcome fruit and executive lounge access. Such considerate service is really touching. The hotel's breakfast is even more remarkable, with a variety of freshly cooked foods, freshly squeezed juices, and delicious coffee. After a day of meetings, returning to the hotel is just enough to relieve my exhaustion for the day. Thanks again to the little beauty zoey, and will definitely stay again.

The front desk service is very good, you don't have to wait long to check in or check out. The only regret is that the snacks and meals in the executive lounge do not match the level of the hotel. There are too few types and they will be withdrawn when the time comes. Marriott is a long-established hotel, and it should ensure that its guests eat and sleep well. The catering in executive rooms is so good that it is unimaginable to cater in ordinary rooms.

The service attitude of the front desk guy was worrying. When I checked in at 11pm, I asked for a quiet room and the room was full. The noise from the roadside on the Third Ring Road was unbearable. The scariest thing was that I saw a thumb-sized cockroach in the bathroom at 3am on the 25th floor! ! ! When I changed rooms at around 4 o'clock, there was another room available in the quiet direction (haha). After all the hassle of changing rooms and checking out, I didn't get much sleep. This is the first time I encountered such a weird hotel. It will be on my blacklist for the rest of my life.

But the only thing is that I can't find the automatic opening and closing button of the curtains, so I can only pull it manually. This doesn't match the grade of our hotel, so I only give it 4 points, and it is recommended to install and upgrade the hotel facilities. Also, there are only two bottles of water in the room, which is not enough to drink. It is better to put a few more bottles.

The advantage is that the location of the hotel is good, and it is more convenient to go anywhere. It is good to have free parking in Guomao, where every inch of land is expensive.

Facilities: In terms of the facilities in the house, I hope the hotel can really make some corresponding upgrades in some details. 🛀The water in the shower room is a bit slow, and you can surf in the end~ 🚻After the hair dryer is plugged into the socket next to the sink, turn it on There will be obvious electric current sound! 📺Although there are not many people watching TV now, as a five-star hotel, the clarity of the TV is really not satisfactory...

Sanitation: The overall sanitation condition depends on the individual, the desk as a whole is clean! However, when some drawers are pulled and closed, there will be obvious clusters of dust flying out~ There will be some stains on the carpet, which may need to be cleaned by a professional company...The housekeeping depar**ent is not easy to operate~

Environment: I have to say that the surrounding environment is very convenient! It is very suitable for business trips and tourism!

Service: Yes, it is a five-star status...

Breakfast: Maybe due to the opening up and the Spring Festival, everyone has gone out to travel and go back to their hometown~ You can feel the obvious lack of manpower in the restaurant! For example, the cleaning is not timely, and the replenishment of meals is too slow... But there is no way, the restaurant staff has really worked hard ~ very busy ~

Counting various factors...it was a good stay experience, but there are really no photos, no habit, I hope you will forgive me~

When I got to the room, I saw that there was a spa, so I called and ordered one. I asked about the cost of 980. When the technician arrived in the room, I simply washed it. At the beginning, I was asked if I was on a business trip. I said yes, and vaguely said that there are any special services. I just said casually and kept pressing. It doesn't work well either. When I left, he gave me a face and asked me what I was doing. I politely answered how much the salary was, and finally it was 1560 for one hour including bath time. Pressed very poorly. Also said they are a chain. Do I need to apply for a card or not? I am also convinced. It was also their home in the sea before, and I felt that it was okay to press it and gave them a thousand each time. This experience is very bad.

There are more people staying in hotels during the Chinese New Year than expected, and many of them brought their families to the party, which really saves trouble.
The highlight is the fitness center on the top floor. The scenery is so good. Many people come to exercise and enjoy the scenery on the first day of the new year. The space is large, the environment is good, the facilities are new, and the CBD is close at hand.

Overall it feels great!
First of all, free parking is really great.
The child knew that I wanted to write a review, and specifically asked me to write down her favorite big bathtub in the room and the crystal ball in the room in the review.
The hotel’s breakfast is my main consideration in setting the hotel’s standard. The most important thing for children outside is to have a good breakfast. Don’t enjoy this kid too much while eating breakfast and looking at the scenery outside the window~~
Hotel service is also very good! After staying for three nights, the room was cleaned and tidy every day, which is the second time I chose to live here.
The transportation is convenient nearby. It takes about 10 minutes to walk from the hotel to the R&F Renaissance Shopping Plaza. Children like the swing outside the mall.
Very good staying experience👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

這個酒店應該有些年頭了，房間的設施比較舊，特別是家具和地毯，都是old style，但還算保養得還不錯。房間洗手間也很乾淨企理。泡浴缸放水速度比較慢，需要耐心。toilet的沖水有時候按下去就不自動起來，要多按一下才恢復正常。走道的燈也曾經不亮，我沒有報，但後來酒店自動修好了。估計是收拾房間的員工發現了主動處理，值得一讚。

以商務標準來講，酒店的早餐很好。基本上各種食物都有中上水準。各種口味都照顧到。

櫃檯服務很好，態度友善，訂車方便。

msg:我是你家老客户了，給你們個面子，評分分給足了，但事兒一定要説。
簡單描述經過，你們自己細品吧。2022.07.18入住你家2015房，半夜12:00發現電視壞的，而且有電流滋啦滋啦聲響，折騰十分鐘也沒搞清楚。因為太晚了，就沒通知你們過來解決，也就無法看電視。
07.19（第二天）下午退房，順便和前台説了一下這事兒，前台表示會詢問。
07.20接到你們大堂值班經理的電話，是一位女士，我以為是問題反饋，沒想到是提醒我小冰箱消費需要我結算一下，因為入住沒付按金，所以無法通過預授扣除。正好我在附近，就商定好了直接到前台當面結算。同時，我又提及了頭天晚上電視的故障問題，大堂經理先是抱歉，然後答應我去詢問一下。
07.20大概16:00我到前台接算了小冰箱消費，順便又和前台工作人員提及此事，前台表示不知到此事，然後又當面幫我提交了這個問題。
16:30左右，我又打了大堂值班經理的電話，這次是個難事接通的，我又同樣把這事兒説了一遍，結果他也一無所知，也先表達了歉意，然後答應我會反饋訊息給我，我也善意的提醒了，這個有安全隱患。
但截止到現在（2022.07.21晚上19:00），我一共反映了4次這個事情，一次迴應都沒有，希望你們不要衹為圖好評，一味的説話客套話，卻忽視了實際的責任，其實事兒不大，但影響心情。而且你們前台還有幾位大堂經理我都認識，起碼是臉熟那種。

酒店一樓的咖啡廳，説實話有點失望，兩杯咖啡+兩塊蛋糕近200大洋，蛋糕明顯口感太幹，放了很久。

富力最近入住了幾次了 是因為想游泳 
正好也出不去遠地方 就來酒店當度假 
但富力這個價格 除了在東三環位置優一些 
我根本沒體驗到這個五星酒店好在哪  現在萬豪集團旗下的都這麼落魄麼？

房間大小 常規 不挑剔 
設施也未免太陳舊了吧？夜裡上個廁所抽水馬桶停不下來的聲音 要不是懶得爬起來穿衣服 真想給酒店服務員叫過來聽聽 
關燈 一個傳統老式按鍵 好不好用都是其次的 湊合能關上
床頭的插銷？能插住麼？是不是設備該換換了？
最近住了幾個房 每間房裡 鬧鐘長得不一樣 沙發顏色不一樣 但設備一樣陳舊 我也是服 
馬桶的聲音不止今日 （7.27）

遲到的評價 純是今天我又來了 煩透了 哪間房的設備都這麼鬧心😠
