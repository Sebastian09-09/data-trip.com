In particular, Peng Min at the hotel front desk was very patient in answering all our questions about tour bookings and even helped us book a 4 start cruise from Guilin to Yangshuo for the next day. Thanks to the team at the hotel for making our stay and trip so easy and enjoyable.

msg:Right across from Elephant Park Scenic Area. The manager Alice speaks English and was very helpful. I got upgraded to a room with a view, which was very nice. I also bought the “extras package” which included a fruit plate, drinks, and a 1 1/2 hour visit to the park with a photographer. He doesn’t get paid by the hotel, but you can choose 5 photos free and then pay 20 rmb for the other ones you like. He knows all the angles and places, although I wish I had more time in the park just on my own. Breakfast is good, with DIY noodles and everything you would expect. The room was clean and spacious. I came in too late for the pick up service, but was given 50 rmb of my 100 rmb fare reimbursed. There is a nice rooftop bar on top! I would recommend for sure. Especially if you are just there for the night.

Soon we were in our very spacious room. The room had a view of the elephant's trunk rock and surrounding park area.  We found that we had a surprise of some photography included.  小纯 took some very professional pictures which gave us some very good memories to keep.  We also had a drink on the roof top bar, that has great views and is not too expensive.  I look forward to staying here again.  I can recommend the boat trip to see the Sun and Moon pagodas.  This leaves from the warf just a few minutes walk from the hotel.

Breakfast is relatively small and beautiful, the rice noodles are delicious, and there is also a very special oil tea to experience, because it is small. The waiters remember you and will greet you

Service: The staff of this hotel are all very good and warm. I feel that Haitang Bay Crown is not so considerate. The room I booked for my family may be a bit noisy, and they also suggested that we change to a lower-priced room 😂, which is also very practical. The bed guard, baby chair and stroller are also prepared and provided. Don't bring children too convenient

The hotel also provides airport pick-up service. On the first day, the flight was delayed and arrived very late. The pick-up master did not complain, and took us to find several convenience stores to buy fresh milk for the little friends. I felt that the people here were too good on the first night in Guilin

Geographic location: It is very centrally located, not far from the Li River, Elephant Trunk Hill and the pier are within walking distance, and it is also very convenient to eat and buy medicine around. It is a little far from the airport.

The only drawback is that the hotel's soundproofing is not particularly good. The noise from the corridor and the sound of traffic outside the window may have some impact on people who have trouble sleeping. However, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The price-performance ratio is very high. If I come to Guilin next time, I will stay here again.

1. Location: The hotel is across the road from Xiangshan Park, which is very convenient. You can see the top of Xiangshan from the hotel window. If you want to see the elephant's trunk, you need to go across the road.

3. Service: The service is satisfactory. There is a fruit platter. Tourists can be given a lot of suggestions on the day. The front desk also has the hotel's own travel guide. We booked the boat tickets and performance tickets to Yangshuo, and the round-trip car pick-up reservations were all provided by the hotel's front desk tourism depar**ent.

There are anti-collision *****s on the corners of the furniture in the room, and bibs are provided for children at breakfast. In addition, Miss Tiantian from the Tourism Department arranged a business car to take us to the terminal. We took a four-hour cruise to Yangshuo and enjoyed the beautiful scenery of the Li River. Guilin's landscape is beautiful and the people are nice. I was very happy on this trip and will stay here again~

msg:When I first arrived at Guilin Purejoy Hotel, to be honest, it was a bit unexpected. I didn't notice the hotel when the taxi arrived at the door because it was not very eye-catching. But when I entered the door, the waiter greeted me warmly, the front desk checked me in quickly, and introduced us to the scenic spots we could go to. The hotel bedding is comfortable and the toiletries are of good quality. It's just that the window is close to the opposite house, which is not very comfortable. I met General Manager Fu in the lobby. After she learned about this, she asked the staff to change our room if there was a room to change. The boss paid attention to such details and did it personally, which made people feel warm. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the ingredients are fresh and you can eat well. The waiter is very enthusiastic and the table is closed quickly. The restaurant manager Xiao Fan is enthusiastic and professional. In addition to the thoughtful service in the restaurant, she also reminded us to bring the hotel umbrella when we met in the lobby because it was raining outside. In short, although the surrounding environment of this hotel is a bit unsatisfactory, the software and hardware in the hotel can offset this well. The hotel is in a very good location. There are many restaurants not far away from the door. It is very close to the Elephant Trunk Hill and Sun and Moon Pagoda scenic spots, and you can walk there.

msg:1. The hotel facilities are old and the layout is similar to that of an express hotel like Hanting;
2. The facilities in the hotel should have been renovated, and the wooden facilities have a smell. If you change the room, there will still be a smell;
3. The hotel service is very perfunctory. They say that free room upgrades are just to lead customers to the worst-located room (the smelly room at the end of the aisle). I told the front desk that there was a smell in the room and needed to be changed, and asked not to use the room at the end of the corridor. After waiting for 30 minutes for the room to be cleaned, I ended up changing to the room at the end of the same corridor on the upper floor;
4. The hotel is located in the city center, but the glass is not soundproof and it is very noisy on the side of the road;
5. The breakfast in the hotel has very little content, the place is small, and it is not very clean. The milk couldn't be poured out right away. The enthusiastic waiter said it was because the fat was too thick and had curdled? Later, I thought it might be that the milk had been left overnight or the milk bucket had not been cleaned at all. After eating breakfast, we went to the airport. After that, both husband and wife began to have diarrhea. They went to the hospital on Monday to be diagnosed with infectious enteritis.
To sum up, I hope everyone who still books this hotel should be careful! !

Every detail reveals the hotel's attentiveness and care for its guests. The bed is comfortable, the toiletries are of high quality, and the slippers are more comfortable than those in a multi-star hotel. The details are very good and allow me to use them.

In terms of catering, the hotel's breakfast is rich, diverse and authentic in taste, allowing me to feel the local culture and characteristics while tasting the food.

Finally, the hotel's tea room and bar are worth experiencing in the evening. It is a great experience to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Guilin from a height.

I also need to give a special thumbs up to the lady who took the travel photos👍 The service is very patient and thoughtful, the photos taken are beautiful, I recommend the experience haha ​​Of course the model is also very beautiful

It was my first time in Guangxi, so of course I chose to stay in the center of Guilin. It turned out that I made the right choice.

📹 The travel photography service is very good. The photographer Xiao Liao has excellent art skills. He is good at capturing expressions and retouching pictures very efficiently. 👍 The photographer is not the kind of person who is in a hurry. He will take a pose that suits you according to your style. I am very satisfied.

🛏️ The bed is very comfortable, the bathrobe is very comfortable, and the shower facilities are easy to use.

💁 The service is perfect and responsive to all requests. There is mineral water near the elevator on every floor of this hotel. There is also water on the shelf next to the front desk. You can take it yourself, which is very convenient. Once I accidentally locked myself out of the door, I just had to call the front desk next to the elevator. There was no inconvenience or embarrassment in staying in this hotel. Generally speaking, the biggest feature of Tianlong Bay Puyue Hotel is [convenience] 】【Easy to use】I will recommend it to my friends.

Internet celebrity snack bars are all within walking distance. The bar on the 8th floor of Shadian is great. I met a young man who was very enthusiastic. We were bartending and introduced the nearby attractions and history. We visited two nights in a row. I didn’t expect to see him at breakfast the next day. He was very diligent. The rice noodles provided for breakfast in the hotel were delicious. According to the brother, the roasted pork was very delicious. It’s all made by the hotel itself, and it’s better than the Internet celebrity store. The room is a parent-child room, with one large bed and one single bed. Since there is a family of four, there is an extra bed between the large bed and the bathtub, which is just right. .
To complain, the bathroom and shower room share a door, and there is no cover from the room. Because the children at home are older, it is really embarrassing. I hope some measures can be taken to improve the privacy.

The hotel service staff are very good. The male receptionist on the day of check-in spent 15 minutes giving a detailed introduction to the surrounding area and the best time to visit. The hotel prepared a piece of paper with attractions, where to eat around the hotel, what local specialties are, and where to buy them.
The next morning a lady would greet us proactively and ask us how we were resting. We don’t know how to mix rice noodles, but they patiently taught us. Knowing that we were struggling to decide whether to go directly to Yangshuo or Xingping Ancient Town, they patiently told me how to get there. Which way will you see more beautiful scenery along the way, which way can be less readable.
This is a very warm hotel, highly recommended, absolutely 100% recommended. I give you 100 stars so that you won’t be proud.

I made a phone call to make an appoin**ent for pick-up the day before I arrived. The receptionist at the front desk carefully confirmed everything and told me that a taxi would pick me up. After arriving in Guilin, the taxi driver also took the initiative to help put the boxes.
The ladies at the front desk of the hotel were very polite and enthusiastic. Because we arrived early, the room was not completely packed yet. The ladies first poured water for us and introduced local attractions and food. After the room was ready, she personally helped us carry our suitcases. Delivered to the door of the room, the service was excellent. The last time I experienced such good service was in Macau.
Although the family room is not too big, it is very clean and comfortable, and the air conditioning is also very good. They are cleaned very seriously every day, especially during the Chinese New Year. The hotel staff are very serious and responsible, which is really worthy of praise! The window of the room is facing Xiangshan Scenic Area, which is very convenient! There is also ancient tea nearby, and I drink it every day, because there is really no such thing in Nanjing!
On the last day, I went downstairs to hand over the room card and met a hotel employee in the elevator. He enthusiastically asked us about our accommodation and asked us to pay attention to our safety. Our whole family was very satisfied and we even said Happy New Year to him before leaving!
This 6 days and 5 nights, I am very satisfied with Guilin and Tianlong Bay Puyue. The people here are also very enthusiastic. I believe Guilin will get better and better!

The buffet breakfast is nutritious and delicious. There is no blind spot in hygiene. The family room is convenient and comfortable. It is good to have a quiet rest at night. The hotel also provides travel guides and recommended restaurants. I also tasted it and it tasted authentic. Next time I come to Guilin, I will choose to stay at Tianlong Bay Puyue Hotel Elephant Trunk Hill Liangjiang Sihu Branch. Good reviews!

First of all, the location of the hotel is very convenient, with Elephant Trunk Hill across the road. The landscape is beautiful. Secondly, they are very attentive to us taking care of our children and provide special children's products. The child's breakfast fee was also waived the next day👍🏻👍🏻When I checked out, my baby's milk bottle was left in the room, and I immediately arranged for SF Express to mail it for free. Everything is done very considerately.

The hotel's service staff are warm and thoughtful, providing considerate care for your stay. What is particularly worth mentioning is that the hotel also carefully prepared travel photography services and hired professional photographer Xixi. Xixi not only showed patience and skill during the shooting process, but also acted as our tour guide, leading us to visit local internet celebrity check-in spots. This experience made the trip more lively and interesting, and we captured many precious moments under her guidance. The photo effects are even more surprising, surpassing the level of our own shooting and presenting an intoxicating picture. Overall, this stay not only allowed us to enjoy a comfortable environment and convenient location, but also felt the meticulous care of the hotel team, which added a wonderful memory to our trip.

Service: The service is very good. The lady at the front desk wanted to upgrade us to a higher floor, but we had to walk up the stairs. I took my parents with me, and the old man has weak legs, so he didn't upgrade! Very thoughtfully guided us to eat Guilin noodles! I reported that there was a gap in the sliding door of the bathroom, and they immediately arranged for someone to repair it. They were so considerate and enthusiastic!
The service for breakfast the next day was also very good. When my mother was taking medicine, she brought warm water over and filled our thermos cups! I introduced their meals and the products were really good. It was the same buffet but I couldn’t go to another one the next day! The breakfast at this restaurant is highly recommended. It tastes really good. It makes me drool just thinking about it. Unfortunately, we were in a hurry that day. We had to eat before catching the cruise, otherwise we would just taste it slowly! I recommend their Guilin rice noodles and stir-fried three-wire rice noodles (which my mother eats a lot of). The taste is very good, the fried pork chop is super delicious, and the sugar-free soy milk is delicious!

Free fruit plate in the room on the first day: It’s great to have a free fruit plate. You can bring it with you on the cruise the next day, haha~(￣▽￣~)!

The hotel also gave you fruit when you checked in. Picture 6 is the outside view taken from the room you checked in. There are branches blocking the view of the Elephant Trunk Mountain Scenic Area.

msg:The location of the hotel is quite convenient. Across the road is Gate 2 of Elephant Trunk Hill Park. Although the room faces the road, the soundproofing is pretty good and we are not disturbed by noise during the day or night.
The entire hotel is not very big, and the front door is easy to miss at first glance, but the hotel interior and rooms are still very exquisitely decorated. There are not many breakfast items, but basically all the Chinese and Western food are available.
Before departure, I contacted the hotel to arrange airport pick-up. The front desk staff came to confirm the check-in time the day before check-in and reminded me of the weather conditions and dressing suggestions in Guilin that day, which was very considerate. After arriving at the hotel, the front desk staff immediately arranged check-in, and even more considerately printed a Guilin travel guide for our reference, which was very thoughtful.
We stayed in a family room, and the decoration was full of childlike fun. When we knew that we were three adults, we immediately arranged for the staff to remove the children's facilities in the room. The Wi-Fi and air conditioning in the room were also super powerful, and there was no need to leave at all. I was worried about the dampness in the room. The only shortcoming of the room is probably the shower room that separates dry and wet areas. There is something wrong with the waterproof partition, which causes the bath water to leak on the ground outside. If you are not careful, it is easy to slip. , I also gave feedback to the hotel when I checked in. I look forward to improvements!
What I must praise is the service of the hotel. The staff silently noted my breakfast preferences. When I went to the restaurant for the second time, the meals were served directly. As the temperature in Guilin cooled down, we specially prepared local oil tea, saying it contained ginger, so we drank it to dispel the cold. Every time you enter and leave the hotel and room, you will be greeted politely by the service staff, which makes you feel very warm. During my stay, I also experienced the travel photography arranged by the hotel. The photographer was very professional and serious. He took me and my family to various check-in points and captured many warm moments. The photos we took were all amazing, very A great experience. The family left a great impression and memory on the hotel and the entire trip to Guilin.

It should be the most convenient hotel nearby to enter Elephant Trunk Mountain. Gate 1 is not open at night, so you have to enter through Gate 3.

The hotel staff were very enthusiastic from check-in to cleaning, and they would talk to the staff enthusiastically throughout the entire process.
The one-page guide provided at the front desk when checking in was very well done, true and objective. This hotel is highly recommended.
The room facilities are very new. The only drawback is that the standard room is relatively small.
The hotel breakfast is rich and tastes good.
In addition, the hotel also provides free travel photography and 5 photos for finishing. The photographer did a good job of taking the photos, and he chose angles that most people can't find, and the angles are also great. It took a total of one hour to one and a half hours, and the production rate was very high.
The hotel is about a ten-minute drive from Guilin Railway Station. Overall transportation and service are the two main features of the hotel.

The breakfast is also very rich, especially the authentic Guilin rice noodles, which will satisfy those who like Chinese and Western food, and the coffee tastes good too. Before leaving, I couldn't help but take away a small doll fan.

msg:A very satisfying stay! The hotel I chose when I first arrived in Guilin was very comfortable. After returning from Yangshuo Longji, I chose to stay at Puyue again.
Location: Across the road is Gate 1 of Elephant Trunk Hill. The Sun and Moon Twin Towers, the must-try Chunji Roast Goose, Tonglai Rice Noodles, Forrest Gump Restaurant, and Gouwei King are all within walking distance. If you are in good physical condition, it will not be a problem to walk to the East and West Alley.
Hotel environment: hardware ✓. Hygiene ✓. Bedding ✓. Capsule coffee machine ✓. Breakfast ✓. By the way, you can have super delicious rice noodles and Gongcheng camellia for breakfast, which is a one-stop shop for special delicacies. The details reveal the care. The children's slippers, dental kits, toilets, and small steps in the parent-child room are so cute. Although I am not traveling with children, I recommend it to families with children ~
Service: The most important thing is to praise the service. To sum up, the service is one step forward, warm and just right. From the manager, the lobby manager to the restaurant manager and even every waiter, everyone feels that they want to help the guests from the bottom of their hearts. The service attitude is super good. Because I am so satisfied, I want to continue to stay after returning from Yangshuo, but the three-person room is full. . The manager arranged to add WeChat and helped us get a room when we came back from Yangshuo. When we came back, the restaurant manager also carefully remembered my habit of asking for a glass of warm water for breakfast. The handsome male manager provided us with a guide to avoid pitfalls and coupons. Listen. After we had two meals of Chunji Roast Goose, we were so stubborn that we went to Gouwei Wang. I also saw the waiter carefully hand-making welcome cards in the restaurant ~ I will definitely stay at Puyue again when I come to Guilin in the future ~

msg:A friend recommended us to stay here, and it was exactly what my friend said. I was pleasantly surprised.
1. Location: It’s too good to say anything. Xiangshan Park is right opposite the hotel, just a two-minute walk away. There is a cruise ship dock at the door. If you are tired from playing outside, you can take the cruise ship and disembark in front of the hotel, and you can rest when you come back. It is not too comfortable. ; It’s not far from the pedestrian street. Our family strolled there from the hotel and arrived in a short while. We could also see the Li River on the way.
2. Service: It’s so considerate and surprising. A housekeeper will call in advance to check what time we arrive at the hotel and tell us the weather that day and the location of the parking lot. When we check in, we will be thoughtfully introduced to the strategy. The guide is also very detailed; every staff member we met after checking in greeted us with a smile and appeared in time when I needed help, but kept a sense of distance and would not offend a sociophobic person like me. Favorability is up~
3. Facilities: The facilities are complete. There is a capsule coffee machine in the room, which is perfect for me. The complimentary capsule coffee is very delicious, and I asked the guest room aunt to get two more for me. The bed is also just right in softness and hardness, unlike beds in other hotels. It's too soft and I can't sleep well at all.
By the way, the Guilin rice noodles and freshly ground coffee for breakfast are also good. The rice noodles taste better than those from rice noodle shops outside, and the freshly ground coffee also tastes very strong~

Regardless of customer service, itinerary planning, ticket ordering, restaurant service, etc., they were very considerate and attentive, giving us 5-star service, especially the restaurant waiter Ms. Fan, who noticed on the first day that my parents like Guilin. Rice noodles and milk are specially prepared for them in the next few days, so that they don’t have to travel to get food, which is very comforting! She also introduced the real way to eat Guilin rice noodles, introduced popular attractions and historical attractions (because my dad likes history), and then the counter staff helped us book tickets, find taxis or chartered cars.
In addition, the location of the hotel is very convenient. Guilin's famous beer fish, rice noodles and other delicacies are nearby. It is also on the side of Elephant Trunk Mountain, where you can see the night view of the Sun and Moon Tower and buy souvenirs on the pedestrian street. The hotel rooms are five-star. , as well as coffee machine and osmanthus tea. I almost forgot about the hotel’s rooftop bar. It’s very relaxing to go up there at night to watch the night view and enjoy the breeze. On the day of return, the hotel gave us a little surprise! Overall, the holiday was memorable and enjoyable, and we highly recommend it.

The breakfast is exquisite and rich. To be honest, traveling alone relies on a combination of Chinese and Western breakfast to achieve balanced nutrition. The seasonal lotus delicacies are unforgettable. It is very considerate to give you an endless supply of fruit every day. Four bottles of mineral water and Coke beer and monk fruit drinks in the refrigerator are free. This kind of service is very attentive, and I don't need any reason to bother the waiter. The hygiene is very good and the bed pillows have no smell.
The special recommendation is the location. Let’s take a look at the poster for the night view. I’ve been to the rooftop bar of the hotel and it’s very comfortable to enjoy the breeze.
What I would recommend is the sunrise room! The manager said that all the rooms in the hotel face east. My room was in the middle, facing the Elephant Trunk Mountain. I woke up early in the morning after checking in, opened the curtains and saw a reddish sky, and watched the sunrise by the way. I remember that in Yantai, the price of a sunrise room is a bit higher. At breakfast the next day, the waiter at the rooftop bar, who was also the person in charge of the catering depar**ent, took the initiative to ask me how I felt about staying in the hotel. I shared my sunrise impression with him, and he turned around and brought the manager over to listen to my thoughts. Without further ado, here’s the picture!

After checking in, I found out from the staff’s introduction that it is a local hotel chain brand in Guangxi. The quality is still good~

Room facilities:
This time I chose a parent-child room. It has 1 large bed and 1 small bed, which is very suitable for family travel. The room is also very bright. There is a bathtub, and the children love taking a bath🛀

breakfast:
Breakfast is served in the restaurant on the first floor. Guilin rice noodles are freshly made and are delicious. The taste is on par with other social meals.

Location transportation:
The location of this hotel is really amazing~ Just walk across the road and you will find Elephant Trunk Hill Park~ and then walk for 5-8 minutes to the location of the night tour of Two Rivers and Four Lakes~ In short, you don’t need to take a taxi, you can get everything on foot~

Serve:
There is a guide for traveling around the hotel in the room, which is very good! The waiters in the hotel are very friendly, greeting you with a smile when you come in and out~

msg:The hotel is indeed located next to the Elephant Trunk Mountain Scenic Area, but the window opens into a dilapidated residential building, which is very depressing and cramped. The waiters in the room front desk and restaurant are very good, and the service level is comparable to that of a five-star hotel. But something happened and I had a very bad impression of the hotel because I planned to take a cruise from Guilin to Yangshuo and enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way. When consulting at the front desk, the front desk recommended a lady next to us. After her introduction, we chose the luxury cruise she recommended. She said it was the same as the 4-hour cruise I wanted to take, except that we had to go to an ethnic minority in the middle. We visited the village and then arranged a period of rafting, which only took two hours longer than just taking a cruise. We thought this was good. Not only did we visit the Li River, we could also experience the customs of ethnic minorities. The next day we set off at 9 a.m. and ended up being pulled by that bus for half of Guilin. It turned out that this bus picked up people everywhere. The cruise only lasted an hour before we were taken ashore. The tour guide took us to a small village on the shore for lunch, and then took a bus (note that it was a bus, not a cruise ship) to the so-called ethnic minority village they promoted, a so-called The Dong village is actually a man-made village where silverware is sold, which is said to be purely handmade. When we entered, we were treated to a show of manipulation, such as an old Dong grandmother, a national treasure, etc. After a while, I realized that it was a place selling silverware. It is said that a family in the same car as ours actually bought more than 20,000 silverware. At that time, we felt that we had been deceived and immediately checked this village online. As a result, many tourists reported that they had been deceived and came here. The tourists on our bus were very angry at that time and asked the tour guide why traveling on the Li River turned into taking a bus. We agreed to arrive in Yangshuo before 5 pm, but we arrived in Yangshuo County at 8 pm. At that time, I went to the hotel front desk to introduce us to the lady who also worked at the hotel front desk and sold us tickets, and asked her why she lied to us. We believed in the hotel, but we were cheated. The lady also expressed surprise. When she finally heard that we wanted to complain, she offered to refund our tickets. Think about us, people who often travel outside, we actually fell into trouble in Guilin because we trusted the hotel staff.

The hotel facilities are also very good, the mini bar in the room is also very good, and the free coffee The capsule tastes very good, and I asked what brand it is, and I plan to buy some to drink at home hahahahaha. By the way, the Guilin rice noodles for breakfast are absolutely delicious, not worse than the noodle shop outside, recommended

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. It takes two minutes to walk to Xiangshan Park. There is a pier at the door. You can go back to the hotel to rest after getting off the boat. It is not too convenient. The room we booked has a bathtub, and the hotel has a disposable bath bag. It is really refreshing to take a bath after playing all day. The hotel facilities are very good, and there is also a small children's playground, which is very friendly for those of us who travel with babies. The Qing Bar on the top of the building is super-produced, and I strongly recommend everyone to go up and take a look and take pictures. There is also a Thai-style SPA on the first floor. It is said that the technique of the technician is not bad, but I didn’t try it because I was too late. I will try it again next time. In short, the experience is upup~

msg:When traveling, for our two-child family, a 2.0-meter king-size bed is something we must consider. This hotel is quiet, and the children's shows are very happy, especially the big bathtub in the room. The area that needs to be improved is the carpet. There are more dead mosquitoes. Children like bare feet and found them when they stepped on the bed. I played bamboo rafts on the Yulong River and a cruise on the Lijiang River. Except for the hot weather, everything else was pretty good. Still give it 5 points, it is not easy to encourage the service industry, hope to keep it!

The parent-child room I booked this time has a bath, Lego, Xiao Bao likes the robot and the bear in the room, and has a great time playing. What's especially great is that the hotel actually has a free travel photography service.

There is no wasted space in a two-bedroom apar**ent of this size, and the big room is still very spacious. We live on the third floor. The window of the big bed room faces the Elephant Trunk Hill Park. Although there is a road downstairs outside the window, there is no noise that affects sleep at night. The window of the living room where the 1.35 small bed is located faces the next house, but it doesn’t matter if there is no need to open the window. The aunt comes to clean every day, and all the staff are very polite.
There are not many varieties of breakfast, but it is less and better. I can feel that the hotel prepares breakfast with care. Anyway, I have a bowl of rice noodles every day🤭.
Opposite the hotel is Elephant Trunk Hill Park. Walking along Binjiang Road all the way, you can pass the Moon Lake Twin Towers (see the night view of the twin towers in Shanhu Scenic Area), Zhengyang Street, Dongxi Lane, and Jingjiang Palace. Walk in the opposite direction of Binjiang Road for a short distance to Chunji Roasted Goose, and continue to Agan Restaurant.
Highly recommend everyone to stay here.

After leaving the store, my father threw the umbrella in the hotel, and the waiter helped to deliver it to the next hotel. I would like to express my thanks. The hotel's breakfast place is not big, but it is rich and the food arrangements are reasonable. The hotel is very close to Xiangshan Park. You can see Xiangshan from the window of the King Room with a view, and the view is perfect. The parent-child room is on the second floor, a bit short. The travel consultation at the front desk of the hotel is very thoughtful, especially suitable for a family trip of seven. My Guilin travel projects are all hotel booking arrangements for a few days.

It costs more than ten yuan to take a taxi to other scenic spots, which is very convenient. I gave a little tip when I checked in, and briefly introduced the food, play and shopping, which is very considerate. The famous Gouweiwang and Chunji Roast Goose are very close to the hotel. There are few varieties of breakfast and it is not attractive to be full. The room I stayed in was facing the street, facing Elephant Trunk Hill, and the windows were well soundproofed. The bathroom is super large with dry and wet separation. Overall hygiene is acceptable.

msg:Facilities: The 1,000-night luxury suite is actually not as big as Marriott’s standard double room. There is no desk, no desk, and online meetings are very inconvenient. The sliding door of the bathroom does not have anti-collision rubber *****s, and the sound insulation is not good. I stayed in a Kempinski standard double room at 800 yuan a night in Xinjiekou, Nanjing. It is also a "luxury hotel" in the center of the city. The luxury of Kempinski is more than a little higher than that of your company. The luxury suite claims to be "woke up by birds". In fact, I am woken up every morning by the sound of horns on the street next to it.
Service: Four stars are for service. The guy at the front desk asked him to deliver two bottles of water, and it was delivered in less than two minutes, but can't you put two more bottles of water in the room? Why there are only two bottles of water in the suite, I really don't understand....
Hygiene: Two nights in a luxury suite. The cleaning lady didn't help to pack things the next day. It is also recommended to prepare an extra roll of paper for the toilet. After all, a room worth 1,000 yuan a day is really not bad for you..
Environment: There is a parking lot, and the cleanliness of the room is remarkable, but the room type is really disappointing. I feel that it is not worthy of the price. It is a good thing that Guilin's tourism industry is getting more and more developed, but it is higher than the tourism consumption level of first-tier and quasi-first-tier cities I really can't compliment

The environment is good and not expensive. Can you get a discount if you stay at the hotel?

msg:Very good👍🏻Everything is a quasi-four-star standard, there is a bathtub, and the view from the bar on the top floor is very good. Although it is facing the street, the sound insulation is super good, you can't hear a lot of noise, and the service is especially good. I need to go to Yangshuo to check out for two days on the way It was also changed in time. The location of the hotel is superior, just opposite the No. 1 entrance of Elephant Trunk Hill. It is really super convenient for the elderly to visit the scenic spots. Not far from the door is Chunji Roast Goose, and the Dagui food downstairs at Chunji is also super good. If the queue is too long, you can go there to eat. Overall, it is very comfortable, and the service attitude is warm and thoughtful. I will stay here again when I go to Guilin again, thank you!

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. Just across the road is the entrance of Elephant Trunk Hill. Before leaving, I went for a walk. Due to the high tide, the recent sea water is very turbid, which still does not affect the beauty🥰
Facilities: The only downside is that I booked a big bed room with my friends. The toilet and shower room share the same door (it may be interesting for couples 😭), and the sewer in the shower room is a bit clogged. Everything else is good, the items are complete, bubble bath and bath salt are provided
The sanitation and environmental services are all ok. Although the room is next to the road, it is not noisy at all. It may be on the 7th floor, so it is very quiet. The brothers and sisters at the front desk are very enthusiastic, and the Yangshuo one-day tour they introduced is not bad, although I booked an offline travel agency with my friends on the way for a walk, I was cheated to death (don’t book an offline one-day tour , said that there is no shopping, and I stayed in the Dong minority village for a long time.. Inducing shopping 🥲The tour guide is still selling in the car🥲It’s not as good as ** pure play items. In fact, the 20 yuan scenic spots I want to go the most feel that they are not polluted by tourism. Experience ☹️)
The cleaning lady is also very diligent and patient, and has troubled me several times😭
On the last day of my departure, I received Pai Daxing from the hotel. I like it 🥰
The hotel room was not photographed, it was exactly the same as the publicity picture
It is said that Guilin rice noodles are the best for six or seven yuan. It is true. The popular rice noodle shop opposite the hotel (I remember it was 14r a bowl?) is so-so. An inconspicuous small shop, all the people who go to eat are locals and classmates from the opposite school, and the three taels of stewed noodles are only 7.5r (really delicious😭)
The buffet in the hotel is okay, but what you can choose to eat is not as good as in the hotel where my friends and I are in Nanning hhh, but it’s been a long time since I ate Yangzhou fried rice (delicious🫢 probably because I stayed in Guangxi for five days and ate rice noodles for five days. Miss rice is)
The Reed Flute Cave in downtown Guilin is worth a visit. It usually takes half an hour to go there. With the explanation of the tickets, it is very shocking and beautiful~ (a few pictures)

Then there is the good location, just across the road from Xiangshan Park. Picture 3 is the hotel I took on Xiangshan. You can also go to eat Chunji Roast Goose and walk for 8 minutes. Then there is the cruise ship on the two rivers and four lakes. I didn't expect to get off the boat to the back alley of the hotel. It is super convenient to come back after watching the night view at night.
The one-bedroom, one-living room is bigger than the double bed, it is recommended

The biggest advantage is the good location. If I choose again, I should try another one. Let's focus on the service, there are good and bad places. The good thing is that when you check in, the attitude of the service staff is very good. They actively and carefully introduce the situation of the hotel and the surrounding restaurants. The bad thing is that I booked a car pick-up, but when I consulted, I asked myself to call Di Drop, and then get reimbursed. I understand that there are many people on May 1st and there is a traffic jam. Since this is the case, this service should not be added to the order. It charges and cannot provide the service. No one is short of the taxi fare. The second is the day of check-out , I added an hourly room fee. Originally, Ctrip exchanged it at 3 o'clock, and it was 6 o'clock after the hour. When the fee was renewed, it also stated that the check-out was at 6 o'clock, and then I started to remind at 5 o'clock, and said it was overtime. After looking at the order, I found that I was wrong, but I still urged to go downstairs and check out on time at 6 o'clock. The welcome fruit charge was also included in the order as an extra charge, but the fruit was wilted.

The pier where you disembark for the night tour of the two rivers and four lakes is also very close to the hotel, just two steps away. Emphasize that the service is very good and a very comfortable experience! When you arrive at Guilin Airport, a driver will be arranged to pick you up, and the housekeeper will contact the driver to confirm the itinerary, which gives people a very reassuring feeling! There is also the Ministry of Tourism that can help to book tickets for scenic spots, there will be a little discount, we also booked the car to Yangshuo the next day from the hotel, so I feel very relieved ~ and the price of the room is not very expensive, it is definitely worth it, give me this first People who came to Guilin once left a particularly good impression

This location in Guilin is great. As everyone said, Xiangshan is close at hand. The play guide at the front desk is very nice to introduce the surrounding food, drink and travel recommendations. It is really cost-effective to go to Guilin under PS. There are eight scenic spots that are free of charge. Unexpectedly, the two families saved a lot. The breakfast in the hotel is very rich, the young brother in the restaurant is very enthusiastic, the freshly ground coffee is very fragrant and NICE, I love to eat his Guilin rice noodles, and I gave a voucher to the rooftop bar. It is a pity that it rained at night. The rooftop bar overlooks Xiangshan and the sunset. Not to be missed here.

The hotel is directly opposite Gate 1 of Xiangshan Park. We can see Xiangshan from our room. It is very beautiful to climb Xiangshan for a walk in the morning. There is a hospital downstairs in the hotel, and it is also very convenient to do nucleic acid. We were reimbursed for the Didi expenses to and from the train station, and the welcome fruit was also delicious. The overall experience was not bad, and the price was high.

I still had breakfast at the "deluxe" hotel for the first time. It was really a good place to go. In addition, all those who came to Guilin were tourists, and they had to go out early in the morning to take a bus. His breakfast time was so late, which also affected my itinerary.
Speaking of the room, I booked a Yueyue queen room with a bathtub. The door of the shower room is not tight, and there are gaps, which lead me to splash out when I take a bath. The floor is full of water...
The room had no wardrobe closets, only an open hanger
No towel bars...my towels were only on the bathtub (a bit unhygienic in my opinion)
The room glass windows are not soundproof and at 11:30 pm you can hear cars and people talking on the street outside

The hotel also has: dental floss, hair spray, rubber band, charging cable, makeup remover, etc. It is great! There is also unlimited afternoon tea (although there are not many types, but it is enough), and daily fruits and drinks are delivered.

Facilities and equipment: opening time in 2019, the facilities are very new, well-equipped, and the quality of the things used in the room is very good (such as slippers, toothbrushes, etc., good quality and comfortable to use.)

Sanitation: The hotel is not too big, but exquisite, and the sanitation is very clean.

Location: The location of the hotel is very good, about a hundred meters away from the main scenic area, it is convenient for eating and playing, and the scenery on the top floor. Although the room I lived in was facing the street, it was really not noisy at all, and the sound insulation of doors and windows was very good.

I checked in on Wednesday, and the hotel seems to be full. The service and hygiene can be maintained under full room conditions, which is very good! The only downside is that the breakfast restaurant is small and many people have to wait for the location. In short, my recommendation index for this hotel is five stars.

It is only a few minutes away from the cruise ship terminal of the Two Rivers and Four Lakes, and to Chunji Roasted Goose for dinner. Travel is very convenient.
The hotel's service is also very considerate. We took a four-star cruise on the Lijiang River, to Yinziyan, and see Liu Sanjie. The tickets were all booked from Xiaoli of the hotel's tourism depar**ent after the hotel was booked. There are discounts. Another hotel service in place is pick-up and delivery services, which provide convenience to our first-time travellers in Guilin. It is said that the journey from the airport to the hotel costs more than 100 taxis. The hotel staff are very friendly, the rooms are comfortable and clean, and the facilities are complete. There are welcome fruits in the rooms. The mini bar is free; in addition, the breakfast and afternoon tea are rich in variety and delicious. Stayed in the hotel for 2 days, feel at home everywhere, it is recommended.

msg:The hotel is very close to Xiangshan Park and Wenchang Wharf. It is convenient to go anywhere, and there are a lot of food around, nice! The only fly in the oin**ent is that the bathroom and bathtub are open. Although it is a family, it is awkward to take a bath. If there is a movable partition, it will be perfect. Overall it is quite satisfactory.

msg:The location of the hotel is excellent, just opposite the Elephant Trunk Hill Park, and the entrance to the park is across the road. It can be picked up once or sent off twice, the service is super good and super convenient!
The hotel's facilities are also very complete, clean and tidy. There is a capsule coffee machine, black tea, osmanthus tea, Luo Han Guo for your choice. The only shortcoming of the parent-child room booked is that there is no partition between the room and the bathing space. The younger children don’t care, the older father and daughter and mother and son are still a bit embarrassed😅
The breakfast is also very rich, both Chinese and Western. The most pleasant surprise is the afternoon tea, which is popular with children.

msg:The hotel is not bad in the city. My package includes a massage. To be honest, the massage is still a bit painful. The concierge at the front desk waited for a long time to check in, but the face recognition system had a problem. Fortunately, the service staff are very helpful. Before leaving, it was also a taxi, and it was quite warm, but my Bluetooth headset was really lost in the hotel. I asked the hotel to find it and said that I couldn’t find it. I was definitely throwing it on the bedside table to charge it, or it would just fall off. Down the ground. Because I was charging the Bluetooth headset, I never took out the room. Anyway, I forgot to take it away and I couldn't find it when I looked back. Hey. . . The last one was taken at the Lijiang Moyin Hotel, which is quite beautiful. The Sun and Moon Twin Pagodas were taken.

msg:The maximum features service is very good. Problems can be solved, the service staff is very polite, we met problems in the elevator, we went down early, but it was not finished, the little brother went out of the elevator with us to answer our questions. Pick up and drop off service is very good, and the driver is polite. I will come back in the afternoon and ask if we need afternoon tea. Really feel at home. The room is not particularly big, but it is super quiet. The floor of Guilin Hotel is not high, and it is very felt to have something to blow the wind on the roof. After going out for a traffic light, you can see the Elephant Trunk Hill. Keji roast goose, Dongjiang rice noodles. But there is a Liuzhou nut powder next to the traffic light is delicious.

msg:Very satisfied hotel, very satisfied with hotel services and the itinerary of the hotel tourism depar**ent. The hotel’s service has one detail that is very well done. There is always mineral water in the corridor. This is the first time I have met! Xiaoli from the hotel and tourism depar**ent took charge of almost all of my itinerary: Longji terraces, 4-star boats to Yangshuo, Yinziyan, the price is cheaper than the Internet and there is no pit, but unfortunately there is no time to see Liu Sanjie and the love of the past, I did not enjoy the small Li's offer. Generally, I also like to book online by myself. This time, because the flight was cancelled 3 times, I didn't dare to book a day trip in advance. I didn't expect to meet Xiaoli, which saved me a lot of energy. It was also the first time I met! thank!

The hotel is very conscious of service, can provide a lot of detailed explanations, the travel depar**ent also has a day trip. There is also a bar on the roof of the hotel. This is a good place to watch the sunrise in the morning and watch the sunset in the evening. As evidenced by my review video shooting. Every staff is very nice, the food in the hotel is also very delicious, and the rice noodles will be eaten every morning. Jingmeiren Meilin, will be seeing you later!

In addition, I am especially grateful to Xiaolijie of the hotel tourism depar**ent, who is very warm and thoughtful, helping us arrange the trip from Guilin to Yangshuo. When you ask for her, you can always answer her questions and share practical experiences. Very professional. All the way to play is also to find her to book tickets and is very reliable.

The hospital is diagonally across from the curtains. What does it feel like to see this? 3. Do you know if there are "traces" left by the previous guest in the toilet, or from the waiter? 4. If you don't take the initiative to write the welcome fruit, there will be none. We came for the price, and it turned out not to be as good as a hotel that was half the price at the same time.

The service is mediocre, the so-called afternoon tea and snacks are very simple, and there are few varieties of breakfast. In particular, I want to talk about the airport drop-off service. The hotel called a taxi with a bad attitude. He kept calling and sending WeChat while driving. We said we were in a hurry, but the driver was not in a hurry!

來桂林之前選酒店糾結了很久，不知道怎麼選，這個酒店位置很好，但是沒有聽説過，擔心衞生什麼的問題，來了之後完全沒有這些顧慮。桂林的旅遊業畢竟發展這麼多年了，基本的素質還是很好的。

msg:第一次和家人來桂林，在攜程上選了該酒店雙床房，入了住三天，有不少感受，想説二句。
    酒店位置極佳，就在象鼻山景區一號門對面，過馬路就可進景區，交通非常方便，門口打車7-9元就可以去七星巖和蘆笛巖景區，便宜！步行十分鐘左右就可以去口碑和菜品都很好，且性價比高的飯店。酒店設施齊全 ，房內1.35床和床品睡着很舒服，還有膠囊咖啡機，小冰箱內有免費的啤酒、可樂和飲料。
     最值得説的是服務，入住當天，酒店範總恰好在大堂，不但熱情接待，還詳細介紹桂林景點，不厭其煩回答所提問題，還根據我們要求給出建議！酒店還為入住客人準備了出行指南。餐飲和客服同樣，在第二天早餐時，餐廳範經理和服務員會根據第一天我們每位用餐習慣，將不同咖啡送到桌上，很感動！離店時，範經理看我們年紀較大，親自幫我們把行李搬到樓下。總之，這是一次難忘的行程！一定要向親朋好友強力推薦！

服務人員整體都特別好很耐心。會熱情打招呼這個真的很不錯👍

贈送的旅拍並不想其他大度假酒店是酒店內的攝影師，其實是外面合作那種兼職，而且出乎預料令人錯愕的是，酒店贈送的旅拍不可以在酒店天台拍照。反而象鼻山旁邊一家酒店的酒吧可以隨便拍。但我們還是會點餐以獅尊重。但我們回到自己入住酒店天台，被黑臉門神阻止拍照，並貼身站着等我給酒店前台打電話。報房號都沒用。還教訓我們不是不讓拍，是我們沒跟前台説。好奇怪我們約了旅拍但是還需要我們單獨跟前台説我們要上天台？anyway，天台真的沒什麼好拍的….如圖。拍照心情全無。猜測天台是外包的，獨立核算，而且他們之間並不友好，不排除有恩怨於是拿酒店客人出氣。
但是酒店服務人員都很有禮貌，很客氣，會各種説對不起。然後就沒有然後了。但是我覺得也是合理的，畢竟不是豪華酒店。

先説設施，房間的衞生情況很好，但是洗浴的配套設施不太人性化～洗澡與房間就淋浴的移門一門之隔，淋浴間裏面沒有任何掛衣服與浴巾的地方，就是説洗好澡得光着身子到外面穿衣服，除非一個人住，不然還是很尷尬的。希望酒店能夠改進。

我發現桂林滿大道都是酒店一家挨着一家哈哈
下半夜到的酒店，前台還幫我升級了。
拍照打卡象鼻山從1號門進，往左走，看見小堤壩順着台階下去就能看見啦！
距離日月塔溜達走路差不多10分鐘吧，4月的桂林街道飄香四溢，不冷不熱，沒有風，特別舒服走一走就到了，從日月塔出來之後再順着道走一走就是步行街啦，步行街走到盡頭就是靖江王府了。
酒店距離桂林站，很近，打車大概10分鐘。
第二天早上坐船從桂林竹江碼頭到陽朔，早起酒店還可以打包早餐。

迎賓水果盤: 水果質量都蠻好，衹是要求入住當天才送這個規定有點不夠意思，還不如換成規定入住特定房型可送水果。純屬個人意見
接機或接高鐵站二選一:來到前台就馬上返現了，乾淨利落，點贊
小冰箱贈飲:沒動，但也是一個誠意之舉
另外，房間配了桂花乾和茶具，桂花幹沖茶清新提神，每天衹要在房間都會喝，十分感謝酒店的用心。
唯一忍不住想提的意見，樓頂的清吧，允許室內吸煙，實在無法接受。

衞生：衞生做的不錯，基本上沒什麼問題；
環境：説實在的剛到的時候感覺還是有點失望，酒店外觀沒有圖片上那麼亮眼，房間窗外也是旁邊的老舊居民樓，和預想有一定差距，後來瞭解到桂林城區裏不允許樓房高過獨秀峯，可能都是這樣的酒店吧。
服務：做為廣西本地的酒店品牌，感覺服務還是挺好的，能達到星級酒店的服務標準，響應速度快。
設施：因為選擇酒店時特地選擇了近幾年開業的酒店，所以設施狀態都比較好，沒遇到什麼問題。
交通：不得不説酒店的地理位置非常好，去周邊景點都比較方便，兩江四湖和靖江王府都可以步行去玩。

酒店雖小就是個寶藏酒店，攜程上訂好了房間後，前台的確認電話馬上打來 加了微信把酒店定位、車場提示、天氣預報還有當地疾控政策一起發來非常貼心❤ 
居然，還升級了房間（驚喜啊，有木有）
🚗 交通：在南寧和柳州首選天龍灣 桂林這家位置就在象鼻山門口 去哪裡步行可以到 東西巷火車站都很方便 頂樓的天台吧俯瞰象山灕江太愜意了，看夕陽簡直YYDS -這種江邊美景一覽眼底，太賺了。
🧹衞生：酒店不大但是很別緻 乾淨整潔  儘管桂林連將數日多暴雨床褥乾燥怡人香氛，住的舒心才是王道啊
🔔服務：有求必應 所到之處打掃的姐姐會打招呼 我特別喜歡他們家的毛絨拖鞋 好的酒店體現在細節，這個我喜歡
總之一句話，店好，景美，暖心，速來，小夥伴們，大力且用力推薦🥳🥳

下午茶很棒，早餐豐富

酒店就在象鼻山景區對面 門頭不大
門口門僮和前台小姐姐 特別熱情
服務枱還有水果 礦泉水 隨意拿
有個服務櫃 放着頭繩 卸粧水 皮筋 耳塞 各式各樣的化粧卸粧潔麪用品 給客人一種 很貼心的感覺
有個插曲 入住時因為自己腳趾受傷 可能把床單弄上血跡
沒有搞清楚的狀態下。還把酒店經理驚擾了
經理很熱情的解決 還給升級了房間
早餐品種也算不錯 吃的很舒服
所以桂林住了幾天 很好的入住體驗 值得推薦
除了沒有健身 游泳 不然評星級酒店 完全沒有問題

唯一的遺憾就是晚上下雨了 沒能更好地夜遊兩江四湖 實在沒空去象鼻山了 但是它就在酒店對面！在房間就能看到！ 就不遺憾啦
以後如果再到桂林一定還來這家！

酒店每一個人，都特別貼心，提出任何要求、問題都會馬上解決，耐心貼心熱心！

🚗 交通：實在太太太方便了，就在文昌碼頭樓上，象山公園對面。
🧹衞生：乾淨，整潔。唯一bug就是淋浴房，因為我們自己帶了嬰兒盆，一下倒水下去，整個廁所淹了。。。不過服務員馬上幫忙打掃好！
🍃環境：非常安靜，望着象山很開心！評論説樓頂酒吧很吵，大概我們白天太累，竟然完全沒聽到。。。
🔔服務：服務真的太太太讚了，每個人都特別nice，想你所想，急你所急！！下次一定再來！

2. 酒店位置較方便，對面是象鼻山公園，後面有兩江四湖碼頭，附近還有米粉店和特產店等。步行到正陽街十幾分鍾。
3. 房間挺大的，1張2米大床和1張1.5的床，適合帶孩子住。不足的是洗澡沒有放衣服的地方，廁所和淋浴雖然隔開了，但玻璃設定私隱性不行，沒法洗澡和方便同時進行。
4.頂樓8層有一個酒吧，晚上可以上去看象鼻山夜景。價格還行，雞尾酒基本上58一份，果汁30。

服務我這次給1分是有原因。我們的房型是包括一次免費酒店到機場接送。去機場的前一天酒店幫我們預約了車，也説清楚車費酒店會負責。去機場路上，司機突然説不走機場高速要走鄉村小路，我問為什麼？司機説要省10塊錢！我都懵了。我可以理解這個不是酒店的問題，但因為車是酒店安排的，我覺得酒店有一定的責任要保證我們是否能安全到達機場。我希望酒店可以重視類似問題。

msg:這是一家必須好評的酒店。第一，位置佳，在象鼻山1號門對面，步行2分鐘，離兩江四湖步行10分鐘。第二，有免費接送機場和高鐵站。這一點對外地來桂林的遊客太方便了，我們同行6人有大箱子，酒店提前安排了大車。第三，環境好。這個價位的酒店來説，已經超乎我的預期，乾淨整潔舒適。第四，服務好。所有的店員總是熱情滿滿，看到你要出去，主動送上大堂的公用雨傘。攜程用户還會送免費玩偶，鑰匙圈，指甲鉗套裝等。第五，趕時間，樓上的悦吧沒去體驗。但下午茶有自製水果茶。總體必須好評。

msg:非常好！免費寄送機，免費下午茶，免費mini吧，免費水果。前台還有很多貼心的小服務。雖然這些其實花不了多少錢，但是體現了商家周到的服務！很多豪華酒店這些貼心的小服務卻反而做不到。早餐小而精，畢竟房費在那裡。位置也不錯，象鼻山就在旁邊。唯一的不足就是房間比較小，酒店應該沒有停車場。

msg:和女朋友一起來到桂林旅遊，第一站選擇了下榻桂林璞悦酒店，酒店的接機非常到位早早的就在站台等待我們，但是我們兩個由於自己溝通的問題跟工作人員沒有到同一站台去，最後沒有接到我們但是會給我們報銷車費。到酒店我們定的房間也給我們升級到了酒店最好的套房，這點是我很驚喜的。

優點：乾淨，有膠囊咖啡，mini bar五星級酒店該有的配置一應俱全，房間也足夠大，而且旁邊是人行道本應該晚上會很吵，但是酒店隔音做的很好。

缺點：早餐種類不是很多。

msg:地理位置：首先桂林市區不大，景點基本打車都是10塊左右，走路在-5分鐘左右，這個酒店對面是象山公園，喜歡爬山的可以去，山也不太高，但是要是想遠眺象鼻子就要住在訾洲公園附近。
附近景點：正陽步行街、東西向、李宗仁官邸、象山公園、西城路步行街、靖王王府等
附近美食：椿記燒鵝、螺螄粉等
酒店設施：有一個小型的話題鞦韆，就是某寶經常刷到的家庭的那種，孩子還是挺高興，前台備有水果、茶歇、各種日用必備品（隱形眼鏡護理液、隱形眼鏡盒、防蚊噴霧、防曬噴霧、卸粧水、眼鏡布、扎頭髮的等等）
早餐：不是很大，不是那種老牌5星酒店一大圈一大圈的美食，但是可以吃飽，水果牛奶粥也都有，下午茶也不錯，非常推薦下午茶的綠豆湯和桂花紅糖水
房間：親子房是一張大床+一張小床，還有小童玩具區，還提供嬰兒手推車，美中不足就是浴缸是開放式的，泡澡吧房間空調涼，最主要家庭房不一定是夫妻+孩子，還有長者+夫妻的…泡澡根本沒法泡，多少有點雞肋。
服務：服務真的是好，如沐春風，走的時候還有上午專車送站，每天下午還有水果，不管在哪裡看見服務員都會問好打招呼～
整體評價：我也住過悦榕莊、麗思卡爾頓、7天、錦江之星、民宿，如果硬要挑毛病，多貴的多大牌的都有點問題，如果説湊活那快捷也行，但是有長者和小孩我覺得這家性價比挺高的，值得推薦
