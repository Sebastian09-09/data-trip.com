msg:I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the exceptional service provided during my recent stay at Fairmont Wuhan. My visit coincided with the Chinese Valentine's Day, and the room was beautifully decorated to mark the occasion. The thoughtful and meticulous preparation truly exceeded my expectations.

I would like to specifically commend our butler, Rita, and the room attendant, Huang Lina. Rita's attentive and warm service made us feel incredibly welcomed and valued. Her professionalism and genuine care for our comfort were evident throughout our stay. Similarly, Huang Lina's dedication to maintaining our room's cleanliness and order was impeccable, and her efforts in the special decoration made our celebration even more memorable.

Their outstanding service and attention to detail made our stay exceptional. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and will fondly remember this experience. I will gladly recommend your hotel to friends and family and look forward to our next visit.

Thank you once again for making our stay so special.

Sincerely,

From start to finish, we were always greeted with a smile and exemplary service. There was basically nothing that could not be done, everything we asked for was granted instantly. Suggestions made by the Fairmont Team enhanced our stay even more! I commend the Fairmont Manager, Depesh, and his team, for their friendliness and immense professionalism throughout our stay. We do not feel we are staying at a hotel but more a grand palace such is the reception there. The place also has a special magic in that my family have had such fond memories such as my son learning to swim for the first time in the wonderful pool. I couldn't recommend the Fairmont enough. By far the best hotel in Wuhan!

The food and service at the hotel restaurant and bar, 1907, was first rate. Would strongly recommend a cocktail and dinner set. The service staff was made aware of the birthday by Ms.Guo, and Josie greeted us with a "Happy Birthday" accompanied by a complimentary glass of champagne. The breakfast was also first rate with pretty much anything you could want. Following breakfast, we were greeted by another guest service staff member, Guillaume, who ensured we had everything we needed. It was truly the pinnacle of hotel service! 5 stars.

msg:I have stayed in this hotel for at least 10 times? In addition to the hotel's positioning, room design style and overall hardware facilities, as an obsessive-compulsive disorder patient and former HSKP employee, I pay more attention to the service itself: The concierge can always respond quickly to open and close the car door, push and put the luggage, and remind me to take all the items. The front desk service is meticulous. In most cases, they can call me accurately. If they can't arrange for me to stay in the room I am used to, they will inform and apologize as soon as possible. Jinzun is also a place I like. The waiters can remember my breakfast preferences. As soon as I enter the door, they will greet me and confirm the breakfast content with me, and then go to remind the kitchen. There are rarely thunders~ There are not many people in the bar, but the atmosphere is good. The female resident singer's voice sounds quite comfortable and lazy. I hope to keep the standard~

msg:The service was very good. They delivered water and children's slippers very quickly. We asked for packed coffee for breakfast because my friend was sick and asked for packed breakfast. We refused at first. After all, it was a hotel buffet breakfast, so we could understand it. After the waiter asked the supervisor for instructions, we were satisfied. We booked an online taxi in the lobby. The lobby waiter took the initiative to ask for the license plate and asked us to sit down and rest. When the car arrived, he notified us to leave the hotel. It was very meticulous.
It is a very new hotel, and some facilities have problems. The floor of the room makes noises and creaks. I am really afraid of disturbing my friends when I get up at night. The sliding doors of the locker room and toilet are heavy and the tracks are not smooth. In order to reflect the high-end, the switches in the room have white walls and white switches with carved words, and black walls and black switches. It is too challenging for eyesight, especially the "Do Not Disturb Please Clean Immediately" on the porch. I can't see it clearly. Ah ah ah
The breakfast variety is too conventional. There are no Wuhan specialties such as three fresh bean skin and egg nog. I am a little disappointed

msg:The location of the hotel is relatively quiet, convenient to everywhere, and there is no traffic jam nearby. Wuhan's special car is very cheap, you can call it at will, and it's fast. The room is quite satisfactory. There is a cloakroom with a dressing table, which is very good! The service is nothing to say, 12 points of satisfaction, and the breakfast is also good. I have never had any hope for breakfast. I feel that the breakfast of most hotels is average. InterContinental, W, Ritz-Carlton, Shangri-La feel that they are more attentive to food. I didn't expect it to be good here! But some details are not done well. The toilet in the bathroom is too high. After all, it is a parent-child hotel, and it is not convenient for half-grown children to use it. The child said that his feet could not touch the ground, and there was no stepping board... The swimming pool is really not matched with the hotel level. There are no spare towels and bottled water in the bathroom and swimming pool. It is empty, which is something I don't often see in hotels. The female shower room in the swimming pool passage feels like a failure. The design is problematic and not private enough. The interior designer of this hotel is probably a man without children? The toilet cannot be changed, but the towels and water can still be improved. After all, when I came out of the shower, I found that the towel was already wet before I went into the water, and it was not convenient to go to the front desk to get it. This was not very considerate of the guests.

msg:I stayed for two nights, but I just didn't feel comfortable. The price of a five-star hotel is comparable to that of a fast hotel. The service attitude of the waiters is far superior, really "very good", and this is the standard of the so-called luxury hotels in Wuhan. I had to wait ** for the reply to the complaint on corporate WeChat, and no one responded. The complaint on Ctrip was also a long, long night of waiting. The service of the two front desk assistants was very good. It was just that the service of other staff was unacceptable.
Facilities: A hotel that has given up detail management and employee training. Detail management refers to the hardware details in the room, the glued parts of the wall and metal threshold, the glued parts of the wood veneer, the toilet drain was not cleaned regularly, causing siltation, etc. The hotel's solution is to change rooms. Then upgrade the service. During this period, the front desk assistant followed up to solve it.
Service: Employee training- The breakfast on the 21st floor was even more excessive. It was not over on time, but they said there was nothing to eat. If you want to eat, just eat quickly. (I really wanted to fight back on the spot. What level of hotel do you work in? I still endured it.) The waitress's face was uglier than anything else. Haha, or the service on the executive floor is like this. Then I arrived at the restaurant on the 21st floor before 16:00 at afternoon tea time. The waiter said that there was nothing left, so the deputy front office manager on duty solved it himself. What's going on? Now the service in Wuhan is the same across the city, all early and on time (all are the same, including the Provincial Museum, all are cleared in advance, even if you want to buy something, you are not welcome, and you are all kicked out.) 
Hygiene: The details are very average, and the bathtub makes a loud noise when draining. It's scary.

What impressed me deeply during my stay was that they provided me with a lot of water in my room. Because I was taking cold medicine, they gave me warm and practical care in a timely manner.
My pillow towel and the rabbit that I carry with me are carefully arranged and well arranged👍
What needs to be improved is that when organizing and storing the room, you can organize cosmetics, pajamas, etc. in a more reasonable way. The neater it will be, the better.
Thanks for taking care of me.

msg:First time staying at Fairmont Hotel. Reasonable price. New design. Nice room. Good lobby service. But I want to say something about the breakfast restaurant on the first floor. The staff are very enthusiastic but I feel that they are not well trained. They don't know where the bathroom is. There are dishes on the spoons. I asked for coffee but it didn't come for a long time. I went to find someone. The coffee was as light as water. I asked to take it back and make it again. The waiter looked confused. One day I came down a little late for breakfast and basically all the dishes were gone. The waiter didn't replenish them in time. The service quality needs to be improved. Everything else is good.

Room service was also prompt and the connection was quick.
The most noteworthy thing is that I drank too much at night and didn't get up in the morning. It was already afternoon when I opened my eyes. However, from the beginning to the end when I went downstairs to check out at three o'clock, I was not urged by phone. This made me feel that the hotel really treats its guests as human beings. , the service is done with heart, instead of like some hotels that only want good reviews and never start from the customer's perspective.
In short, although this trip to Wuhan was very short and I didn’t have time to go shopping, Fairmont Hotel gave me the biggest surprise of the trip.

Karina, the golden butler, provided professional service and provided comprehensive suggestions on my travel issues. She also met the room type requirements and the grace of check-out time.

The front desk team at check-in and check-out were quick to accommodate any requests I had and Billy in particular was very lovely. For example, Billy's suggestions on room temperature adjus**ent and other hotel services and facilities left a deep impression on me. He paid attention to details and made me feel cordial and warm.

The hotel swimming pool facilities are very good, both dry and wet steaming are in running condition.

Recommended 1907 Bar and Grill, M9 Australian Wagyu beef is very delicious. The bar's evening jazz band is well prepared and proactively communicates with customers.

Neil, the employee at 1907, did a great job and gave me very good suggestions.

Chef Lim was kind enough to come up and introduce the dishes. The bartenders at the bar proactively communicate with customers and are very friendly.

I will stay at this hotel again and recommend it to other friends.

The hotel swimming pool and gym are very good. The hotel buffet is purchased separately, as shown in Figures 10 to 13. The Steak Wellington was particularly good, with all the ingredients as shown in the picture. Since I was staying during the Spring Festival, the hotel also gave us welcome fruits and Spring Festival candies as shown in the picture. I ate the fruit but didn’t take a photo😀. The last photo was when the hotel turned down the hotel. I was very considerate and gave me a steam eye mask. This time, it was honestly worth it. The hotel service was very considerate and attentive. Special thanks to Rita for her service. The only flaw is that the buffet food felt a bit cold. For Chinese people who like to drink hot water, it is really cold in the stomach. It is recommended to heat the plate. All in all, it was a great experience and I will book it next time!

She took the initiative to carry our suitcases and take us to the guest room. She also took the trouble to introduce us to nearby places where we could take photos. Fun and shopping, thank you very much!
      The room is clean and tidy, and the facilities are basically complete. It's not like some reviews said that you don't need anything. There are toothbrush sets, shower caps, combs, pajamas, and slippers. We stayed for two days in a row, and new ones were delivered the next day. Slippers and minibar. You need to carefully close the double door before going to bed, so that the lights inside will automatically turn off. In addition, I found that the height of the bed seems to be higher than that of ordinary five-star hotels. It may be because it is snowing during the holidays, and the occupancy rate is not very high. , the room is very quiet and no noise ￼, ￼The bar’s specially prepared empty mountain is very suitable to recommend to female friends after the rain
      The buffet in the restaurant is also relatively comprehensive. Noodles, thin noodles, and wide noodles are all good. The homemade yogurt of various flavors in small glass bottles is very cute.
, mango jam is delicious
       Before leaving, the beautiful lady at the front desk was very helpful. She still helped us drag our suitcases outside the hotel and watched us off, which made us truly feel the five-star service of Fairmont.

msg:During this Spring Festival trip to Wuhan, I checked out many hotels in advance, and I was always confused about which one to stay in, because I wanted to see the river view, and I also wanted the hotel to be newer, and I also wanted the price to be around 1,000. After comparing, I gave up the pursuit of river view and chose Fairmont. After staying for two days, I would say it was worth the money. First of all, as a first-tier hotel in Wuhan, I personally think that the hotel's decoration style, room environment and comfort are not good value for money, but it must be good value for money. Many people think that there are unfinished buildings in the peripheral environment of the CBD area, and the environment from the rooms is not very good, but I think we came to Wuhan to visit, not to stay in a hotel for vacation, so this can be ignored. The drinks in the small refrigerator in the room are free, and welcome fruits are also a must. During the Chinese New Year, gold coin chocolates and good-quality bear toys were prepared for the children. Before leaving, they also gave a sample set of toiletries, which was really good. I would like to mention the service of the housekeepers Rita and Karina, they are very considerate! Almost all the requests given in advance were met, and I have always wanted to be the first to give the guest a like 👍 when I come to Wuhan in the future. I think I will still stay here.

Overall, it is a good high-end hotel in Wuhan. The breakfast and complete buffet are worth recommending. One thing: why is it so hot in the hotel in the winter? It would be nice if it was a little warmer and more comfortable and not so hot. Also, the sound insulation of the room is a little bit not very good. Come on and improve! Will stay here next time if I have a chance!

We informed in advance that we needed a garment steamer and a quiet room on a high floor. Rita arranged everything in place. She also very considerately shared tips on eating, drinking and traveling in Wuhan. She also wrote a handwritten welcome card after moving in, which was really heart-warming! I stayed for two nights and had to check out late due to something unexpected. I needed to hold an emergency conference call. Rita helped coordinate the arrangements. It was really nice. The greeting guy downstairs will thoughtfully remind you to cool down and keep warm, and take the initiative to help with luggage. The service is so good, it is definitely the service benchmark of most five-star hotels in China! The bedding was very good, the breakfast was good, and the room was very clean. I will still choose this hotel when I come to Wuhan in the future. This hotel really makes guests feel at home. It is really impeccable.

1. The design is very elegant, and the simple and beautiful design style combines the practicality of the user. The movement and experience are very good. Full of low-key and restrained aristocratic a**osphere. Style-wise, it’s also my favorite. Especially the three-layer light-shielding design of the suite is both beautiful and practical. I learned a lot.
2. Service: The training is very good. Every staff member has traces of professional training, from the door concierge to the cleaning aunt, the switchboard, and the front desk and VIP reception.
Molly, the housekeeper of Jinzun, added my WeChat account in advance and gave me various travel suggestions and help. And put all the pillows we need in place in advance.
Thank you to all the staff at the Jinzun level for providing us with detailed technical support and help on WeChat.
When leaving the store, Mandy went to the first floor to see us off.
In short, the hotel's service is very good, very professional and almost impeccable.

3. Environment and transportation: The hotel is located in the financial district. There are few people during festivals and the surroundings are quiet. There is not much greenery below, it is all supporting greenery for business buildings, and there is no view outside the window. Transportation by car is relatively convenient. It is relatively close to several large shopping malls, but a bit far from the scenic spots.

Parking: Self-driving, parking in the underground garage is convenient. There is a dedicated concierge on the first floor. The overall service process design is very careful.

Room Service:
The switchboards are very enthusiastic, responsible and have clear ideas.
At 10 o'clock at night, the room needed service, and it came super fast, less than five minutes. The waiter was a young man, and he helped change the battery of the remote control. He worked quickly and neatly, putting things back where he took them, and in an organized manner.

The service staff who clean the room all wear disposable hats, which is not found in other hotels.
There is no cart to clean the room, and it does not occupy the passage. A small trolley is used to pull it directly into the room. A small mop is placed at the door to remind guests that cleaning is happening inside. This process is very appropriate and reflects the attentiveness and meticulousness of housekeeping management. It is very level.

Breakfast: rich in variety and generally good. There are a lot of people during the National Day.
The salad has five kinds of leaves. The plate is a bit high and difficult to access. The nuts are not in the salad area, but in the yogurt area, which is a bit inconvenient.
Some sliced ​​breads are dry and don't feel soft.
The hot dry noodles are quite delicious and I won’t try them out again.

Room facilities:
The toilet is a smart Kohler. See photo below.
The water from the shower is quite comfortable even in heavy rain. The shower faucet has an American feel and is consistent with the overall design style. High praise!

I like the bath products from Le Labo very much.

The hair dryer in the room is from Philips, which is a bit heavy and takes a long time to dry shoulder-length hair.

There are many mirrors in the room. The design of the mirrors is in place. They are not obtrusive and do not affect rest. They are also very convenient to use.

Chinese Restaurant: Shancheng Zao Restaurant on the second floor. The Hubei dishes are unique and delicious. The service was a bit slow during the National Day. Ordering was slow. If you need service in the venue, you basically have to raise your hand for a long time and go to the door to call someone.


VIP lounge on the 21st floor:
Very comfortable, few people and quiet. The service was excellent.
The coffee was a bit bitter. After I reported it to a young lady, she understood immediately. After explaining it to me, she made me a low-fat latte, which tasted good.
The suite includes afternoon tea and light dinner.
The desserts are delicious and the cakes are well made.

question:
1. The button for swiping the elevator card is a little stuck. It won't work if you touch it for a long time. You have to press it multiple times. It is recommended to check it out.

2. When you go out every day, you need to report your license plate to the concierge on the first floor. Parking fee is free. Because if you don’t go through it, you often forget it, which is inconvenient. Hope it's optimized.

3. It is recommended that when there are many people on holidays, there should be a usher position at the front desk to help guests check in in an orderly manner and avoid disorder at the front desk when there are many people.

Feel the French romance

For a meeting in Wuhan, choose to stay at Oceanwide Fairmont Hotel
Fairmont is a high-end brand under the Accor Group
The overall style of Fairmont Wuhan is a very grand French style
The hotel's service is very good, and breakfast is very good value for 208 yuan.
Food variety is very diverse
The drinking water provided in the room is mineral water from Changshou Village
We provided fresh fruit when we checked in and called in advance to ask what time we would arrive.
Very thoughtful.
The hotel room is filled with large packages of toiletries.
Because I personally like to collect these travel clothes
And they are all from Lelabo. I also like their products very much.
So I asked the customer service lady Xiao Yong at the front desk.
Very generously gave a set to me and my friend.
Miss Xiao Yong's service is very attentive and her words make people feel comfortable.
A very satisfying experience
Next time I go to other cities, I will go and experience a different Fairmont.

Wuhan can be regarded as a hotel desert. There are basically no luxury hotels mentioned above in Wuhan. Fairmont can be said to be the only luxury hotel in Han.
Service: When you arrive at the store, there are dedicated people to help open the door to the elevator, check in quickly, and proactively ask if you need help delivering your luggage to the room. These are all plus points. Special thanks to Manager Min Tianyi. When he learned that my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary, he specially upgraded the room and arranged a cake. There were many details that were very thoughtful and user-friendly. The room attendant, Ms. Yin, was also very attentive in her service;
Environment: The lobby is very open, the screen decorations are more in the style of Jiangcheng, the interior decoration of the room is very comfortable, and the scenery outside the window is average. Breakfast was great
Disadvantages:
1. The hotel is located in Wuhan New District, and there are not many shopping malls around it.
2. At 10:30 in the morning, the waiter knocks on the door and asks if you need to do laundry. If you want to sleep in, you will be very upset.
However, the faults do not hide the faults, and overall it is still very good. I will still choose Fairmont next time I come to Wuhan!

msg:The hotel is in the business district, a certain distance away from the main attractions in Wuhan. However, the hotel is probably the latest and best in Wuhan for the time being. It is relatively comfortable and a**ospheric. The disadvantage is that the room I stayed in faces other people's residences, so the privacy is slightly weak. What can I say about the service? The sop is right, but it feels rather rigid and lacks a little warmth. There are many kinds of breakfast, which is quite satisfying.

The housekeeper Zoey is very patient and will recommend it to friends! Surprisingly, the housekeeper Zoey actually knew about my birthday, carefully decorated the room, and sent champagne and cake🎂. Thank you very much! The hotel is really attentive and considers its guests. I will definitely stay at Fairmont next time I come to Wuhan!

msg:I booked two rooms for a total of 8 nights this time, during which time two families moved upstairs. However, because the soundproofing of the hotel was poor, the floors were too thin, and the children would make the trough lamps clang when they jumped. I complained twice during this period, but the hotel did not take any other solution except to go upstairs and tell them. Even after I complained the first time, they continued to arrange for families with children to stay, which resulted in me being noisy and complained again for the second time.
I don’t mean to blame the naughty child here. The family upstairs did pay a lot of attention after being reminded by the hotel. And I also feel very sorry. It is inevitable that children will get excited when they go out to play, and they will end up being educated by the hotel. So I think it is inappropriate for the hotel to directly remind guests to keep quiet.
I'm not overly sensitive to sound either, it's just that the hotel's hardware does have issues. The various doors have no buffer, and the door is not soundproof at all. The floor slabs and partition walls are thin, causing all kinds of noise to be transmitted. Talking in the corridor, I heard clearly through the door.
The hardware of the hotel cannot be changed, so can our service awareness be improved? When you complain for the first time, can you please be careful not to arrange for families with children to stay above me? Otherwise, there will be no second complaints and negative reviews. Waiting until a negative review occurs and then frantically trying to remedy it will not be of much use. The work that should be done should be done beforehand.
Another small suggestion: to verify the room number during breakfast, you also need to check the paper receipt, which is so outdated! Just use the POS machine to swipe the room card directly. Just get as many copies as you need. If it's not enough, just make extra money. The waiter stared for a long time and couldn't find the room number. It was a waste of time. He was confused and couldn't find it on the big list. He even took a small note to write down our room number. Did he suspect that we came in to cheat on food and drink? Then I'm worried about someone randomly giving me my room number and eating my breakfast.

The cleanliness of the room can be described as a disaster. There were spider webs behind the door, and there was dust and wall dust everywhere. I have never stayed in such a dirty hotel! !
The soundproofing of the hotel is extremely poor, and the layout of the guest rooms are all connected rooms. You can basically hear what the people next to you say, which is super scary!
The hotel opened in 2019. Look how bad the bathroom floor is. The skin is peeling off? !
The Chinese restaurant is also very average. I ordered "fried morels with phoenix tail and kale". As shown in the picture, how many morels are there? How much kale is there? It’s all yams, which is outrageous!

msg:On a business trip to Wuhan, I specifically chose this restaurant. In terms of design alone, it is considered the ceiling of Wuhan. The hotel facilities and environment are quite satisfactory and have a sense of design. Especially the lobby space is very comfortable and spacious. The design of the guest rooms is very homely, including the color matching, furniture selection and maintenance. It is a hotel suitable for permanent stays.
But when it comes to service, it may be a disadvantage. It is rarely the first time for me to stay with this brand. Speaking of service, there is a lack of a**osphere in the hotel design. The whole hotel feels like luxurious facilities and poor service.
I called the hotel in advance and upgraded to Fairmont Gold. The lady who received my luggage was very nice, but the receptionist was really cold-faced, which made me a little embarrassed. There were two oolongs when calling for room service after check-in. Once I sent the wrong item, I was wondering if there was something wrong with my expression. In fact, the operator didn't listen at all online. Another time I asked for something, but it didn't arrive for two hours, and I found out that it was missed...
To sum up: the service staff in the executive lounge are very enthusiastic and demonstrate a relatively high level of service. However, neither the front desk nor the leaders on duty on the first floor can understand the meaning of them standing downstairs to receive people. Maybe they are just The guests waiting for the total set did not see other guests. Some of the waiters in the breakfast room were really unprofessional and felt like they were trying to make ends meet, and the experience was not up to expectations.
Finally, I would like to add that the taste of the food needs to be improved. The breakfast categories are too single. The noodle stalls are of some standard, but other flavors and categories need to be improved. This is purely my personal opinion. If you have any doubts, you can ask questions or add to my shortcomings!

msg:The worst time I stayed in a five-star hotel for the first time. It was not even as good as a small hotel. When I checked in, I was told that it was a green and environmentally friendly hotel. There were no other consumables in the room except a toothbrush. I asked for other consumables, but the result was Give me a bunch of them, but you don’t even know how to put them in bags. Are you going to let me carry them upstairs? There is no basic sense of service, and the service is not as good as that of a budget hotel. What’s even more funny is that in a five-star hotel, there is a cooperative power bank on each floor. Even if a budget hotel does not make money, it will not do such a thing. , after checking in, the room smelled musty and the hygiene was extremely poor. I thought I would stay for one night and forget it. I went out with friends all night and came back to wash up and go to bed at 4 o'clock in the morning. As a result, the lamp in the tea table was turned off. I couldn't turn it off and kept it on all night, which was very annoying. What was even more annoying was that I slept until 11 a.m., didn't call the room, opened the door and came in directly, and woke up with a fright. It was really strange. I decisively chose not to sleep and got up. After checking out, I will never stay at this Fairmont again. I rely on the signboard to attract traffic. I believe that those who have stayed there once will never choose to stay here again. It is such a bad stay experience. Friends who choose a hotel, please choose carefully!

msg:The newest five-star hotel in Wuhan is owned by the French Accor Group and belongs to the luxury hotel category. This is my first time staying at the Fairmont Hotel.
[Candy] Room facilities:
The Jinzun King Room has an area of ​​50 square meters. The black and white main colors are full of luxury. The bed is very comfortable. The bathroom has a bathtub for a comfortable bath. The dressing room is sufficient. The minibar coffee machine is complete with wine glasses and drinks. The bad thing is the view outside the window and the CBD opposite. The building affects the view.

[Candy]Executive courtesy:
I didn’t try the happy hour. The variety of dinner in the executive lounge is not rich, but the quality is very good. The hot dishes are Southeast Asian style, such as grilled pork neck, glutinous rice chicken, satay beef ribs, etc. Sashimi is also available, and the fruit is fresh. Desserts are average, I like the white wine and sparkling wine provided, and the whiskey is also good.
In addition, the executive lounge has a good a**osphere, the service staff are polite and quiet, the bouquets and hydrangeas on the table are all fresh, and the tableware and tableware decorations are full of high-end and full of details.

[Candy]Breakfast:
I really like the breakfast. It has Chinese and Western styles. I recommend the egg rolls freshly made by the chef. They are tender and delicious. The iced latte made by the service girl is delicious. It surpasses the quality of coffee in many hotels. The tea bags are all TWG. There are also All kinds of freshly squeezed juices are full of details.

[Candy] Pool:
The swimming pool is like a greenhouse with a transparent glass roof. The water depth is not deep and neither big nor small. The massage pool was under maintenance and could not be used. Unfortunately, the view outside the window was average and the view was also blocked by the buildings.

The location is in Wuhan New District. It is highly recommended for those who have high requirements for accommodation quality to experience it.

Next time I come to Wuhan to watch a performance, I will book here again. It is very convenient for shopping and eating around, and it is very close to the Mixc.
But there are a few problems:
1. The hotel does not provide data lines, which is very inconvenient. I need to go to the stairs to borrow a power bank by myself🤣This is the first time I encountered this situation😂
2. For dry cleaning service, you should confirm the time before returning the washed clothes, otherwise knocking on the door without warning will really disturb people's sleep💤
3. The food served in the hotel room is really incomparable with the hotel restaurant. The pasta is very fast, the beef noodles are also very light, and the milk should also provide a choice of skim or full fat. After all, there are different habits and tastes. Preferences, the pumpkin soup is very thin, not thick, and the room service must be delicious, but at least it must be worthy of the hotel's specifications.

Compared with Grand Hyatt, Ritz-Carlton, Waldorf Astoria, etc., Fairmont is not so famous. But everyone knows that the Shanghai Peace Hotel is actually the Fairmont.
	
Wuhan can be regarded as a hotel desert. There are basically no luxury hotels mentioned above in Wuhan. Fairmont can be said to be the only luxury hotel in Han
	
Service: There are special people in the parking garage to help open the door to the elevator, two free cocktails in the lounge when you check in, ask if you need to help deliver your luggage to the room, and someone asks if you need turndown service, these are more basic points.
	
Environment: The lobby is very open, and the decorative paintings on the screens are more in the style of Jiangcheng. The interior decoration of the room is very comfortable, and the scenery outside the window is average. great breakfast
Disadvantages:
1. Pay attention to the details in the room, the trash can in the toilet is very dirty (the last picture
2. The sound insulation of the room is average. There seems to be some problem with the circuit.
3. Did not take the initiative to ask for coffee or tea for breakfast
	
Generally speaking, Fairmont is still top 1 in Wuhan. I hope there will be more and more luxury hotels in Wuhan.

When I checked in on the first day, I told the lady who cleaned the room outside that I used to drink tea, so please bring a few more bottles of mineral water, because the hotel uses 350ml mineral water, I said 6-8 bottles, she said this is a bit much, There may be an application, and there may be a fee, but I didn't say anything, and it was sent anyway. The next morning, I went to the restaurant to have breakfast. When I registered the room number, I told the reception girl at the door that I would take the train later, and it would take a long time. I had to pack some bread and snacks when I left. The face of the receptionist girl was really visible to the naked eye, and she said to me coldly, you have two breakfasts in this room, so the other person can't come down to eat, I said yes, no problem, I will be alone people. When ready to pack. Find a man with a job badge on his chest. It should be a leader, and he brought two interns to teach them business. I told him that I wanted to pack some food for the train, and where to get the box. He said a lot of regulations and so on, and finally said that according to the regulations If you pack breakfast, you can only take yogurt, bread and fruit. I just wanted to get a few breads, and I booked a room with two breakfasts for myself. In the end, it seemed like I was trying to take advantage of you. It was really a box of yogurt, 3 small breads, and a few pieces of pastries. I have encountered a similar situation in other places before. In Shenzhen, Raffles is also owned by Accor. I have to catch an early flight, and the time to leave the store is earlier than the early meal time. They are prepared in advance and bring it to me early. . Our group had breakfast at the Nile River in Chengdu, and we were going to Dujiangyan for a day. The hotel provided bread and snacks to eat on the way. At the Sheraton Jinan, my companion was sick and couldn’t come down to eat. You can pretend whatever you want, the operation of your hotel is really amazing, and I will never choose your hotel when I come to Wuhan again. It is really embarrassing for Accor.

msg:Facilities: Everything else is available, but the toilet is not functional, which is a bit unexpected. The room design is quite new in Chinese style, but it can be seen that the maintenance is not very good and it is a bit old.
Hygiene: Good, quite clean.
Environment: The sound insulation is so-so, you can hear other rooms closing the door without a buffer. The location of the hotel is very good. It takes half an hour to take a taxi to the airport. There are many places to eat and shop around, which is very convenient.
Service: good. Restaurant service needs to be strengthened.
There are not many varieties of breakfast.
Overall recommended.

msg:The hotel opened in 2019, the public area is very new, and the decoration is tasteful. However, I don't know if the guest room is due to cleaning. It is a little old. It is recommended to clean it up. As a five-star room, the hardware in the room is still not up to standard: there are only toothbrushes for washing, not a single bottle of washing and moisturizing, the minibar needs to be paid for except mineral water, the brand of capsule coffee is unknown, and the toilet is not smart, etc. However, they have storage boxes for office gadgets (staples, rulers, etc.), which can be used by customers who need them. However, with the development of the times, it seems that these are not necessary, so they can consider strengthening the function when upgrading in the future.
Public area decoration and facilities: I didn’t go to the swimming pool and fitness area, but the photos on the Internet are good. The decoration of the buffet area and tea bar area in the lobby is very beautiful. The layout, space partition, material and color matching, and soft decoration are all stylish. The black and white marble parquet in the ground hall is very high-end. I didn't go to the bar either, the time was wrong. The decoration of conference halls, banquet halls, guest room corridors, etc. is very good, especially the glass screen in the elevator room can rotate, which has a sense of design.
Meals: Breakfast was great with a lot of variety. Western-style Chinese stewed eggs, soda crackers and cheese are great; the special sesame paste (personally thinks it is too sweet), poached eggs, may not be available every day, it is recommended to adjust it to white fungus soup; the fruit is red dragon fruit and green cantaloupe, the quality is great. There are also many types of Chinese style and salads, and the taste is also good.

When I walked into the lobby, a group of people gathered together (like the lobby manager) and felt that I was being watched all the time. I was on a business trip because There is no room. The other hotels booked by my colleagues saw that I had a lot of things, so they helped me deliver them. They were already in the elevator, and they had to chase after me to register with their ID card to go upstairs. It was really annoying. I already said that the luggage should be put down. I just came out, and then entered the elevator and couldn’t swipe the room card. I don’t know if the room card was stopped for me on purpose, and I pulled a bunch of luggage at the front desk to handle it, and then entered the room, which was full of all kinds of dirt in the details. Dirty, it really doesn't deserve to be called a five-star hotel. I'm really dissatisfied from the service to the details.

During a short one-day stay, he brought people peace of mind and surprises. This is the fourth time I stayed at Fairmont Wuhan, not only because Fairmont represents the first echelon of Wuhan hotels at the current stage and provides high-quality hotel services, but also because this day is my girlfriend’s birthday and the planned marriage proposal day, the choice fee Fairmont is because only Fairmont can meet the requirements in many aspects of planning. The hotel housekeeper Max added WeChat four days before check-in, and then made every effort and meticulous planning in every link, whether it is room layout , Gift arrangements, or cake handover issues, we care about everything by ourselves. Thanks to the hard work of the hotel and service staff, life has also gone through a perfect and important stage. Thanks again to Fairmont and the hotel for their warm service.

Thank you very much for you and your colleagues, and all the services provided by Fairmont made me feel a very perfect check-in experience. The room was lovely. I lay in bed this morning and watched the sunrise in Wuhan. The breakfast products also exceeded expectations. Of course, it is very important that the restaurant is beautiful, which makes me very happy.

 I look forward to coming to Wuhan next time and coming to Fairmont Oceanwide.

It's a pity that the swimming pool is under repair, and I didn't experience taking a photo. I hope I have a chance next time.
All hotel staff are very professional.
The avia people who helped check out at the front desk were very enthusiastic and the service was very good. They took the initiative to help store their luggage and explained in detail the free issue of the parking lot.
The meals in the set menu are also good.
Very satisfied with this stay, I recommend Fairmont.

msg:Wuhan｜Live in the modern Yellow Crane Tower｜Luxury design hotel

With the family members, with great excitement, we started the vacation mode together. Have a nice vacation❣️Also keep a reference for the friends who are about to travel on November~

First stop, Wuhan ❤️ Stay at Fairmont Wuhan Oceanwide Hotel.
After renting a car at the airport, I followed the navigation all the way to the hotel.

————————
💜Check-in experience:
————————

🔘Located in the central business district, the hotel is called "Oriental Chicago", which sounds tall.
🔘The location is excellent, 20 kilometers from the airport, 16 kilometers from the Provincial Museum, and no more than 5 kilometers from various shopping malls around.
🔘Designer hotel, the design inspiration comes from the Yellow Crane Tower, the master's handwriting is different.
🔘The overall style is concise, black and white, with the style of ancient architecture and the main body of fashion and modernity.
🔘The sixth Fairmont hotel nationwide, the first in Wuhan.

————————
📍Detailed address:
————————
249 Huaihai Road, Wuhan
(Tips: The hotel has an exclusive underground parking lot. There is no charge for parking. You must report the license plate number at the front desk before going out.)

————————
💡Hotel highlights:
————————
⭕️Room Type
Stayed in Fairmont Deluxe King Room
The functional area of the room is designed reasonably, and the separation of dry and wet is also done very well.
You can see the skyline of Wuhan from the room, and the overall comfort is great. (Lulu at the front desk of the hotel, super caring, I must recommend it. The room type has been upgraded, and Wuhan is also introduced. The most important thing is that you can chat)

⭕️Toiletries
From shampoo to soap, all are LELABO No. 31. The faint smell of woody rose makes people feel very relaxing, highlighting the luxury quality of the hotel, which is also the exclusive olfactory memory of this hotel.

⭕️Room details
Hotel room has bluetooth speaker
The bathroom uses the Kohler brand
Tea is a Singapore brand TWG

⭕️Breakfast
Rich in categories and local characteristics.
Speaking of Wuhan, the first pronoun must be hot dry noodles. You can check in at the hotel without leaving home, this authentic Wuhan cuisine.

I like the overall quality of this hotel. But there is a small regret, the hotel's Internet celebrity Tiffany swimming pool maintenance, did not experience it. Next time I have a chance to check in again.

I’m Zhang, 尜楠 (ga nan❤️)
A new Hainan Islander who loves life🌈, loves romance💕 eats and plays everywhere ✈️, and shares his records📝. Thanks for watching~ Welcome to follow, like and collect. Love you ❤️

That hotel is more than 2,000 yuan a night. Fairmont's mattresses are very suitable for Chinese people's habits. They are not so soft and firm, and the children sleep soundly. The quality of the bed is very comfortable. The taste of the Chinese restaurant on the second floor is also very good. Authentic Wuchang rice. In short, five points.

bed:
The bed is very comfortable, you can sleep beautifully~

wifi:
The Wi-Fi speed is OK.

Room facilities:
Ordinary toilets are not electric. In this era, this configuration still feels a bit too traditional; the business a**osphere is relatively strong; the cloakroom is still quite large, and the room is not too big as a whole, but it is OK to stay for one night.

Cost performance:
1009, not including breakfast, still feels a bit expensive.

I originally planned to swim at night, because I came back too late and went to the pool to be cleaned and filtered (I feel at ease with the cleanliness of the water). The pool during the day is the favorite tiffany blue (the original camera has no filter), and the favorite LE LABO🥰. In short, the sense of experience 👍🏻👍🏻. recommend!

msg:This Fairmont hotel was opened at the end of 2019. After a difficult epidemic, in the post-epidemic era, it struggled to rebirth from the ruins. Before I came, I didn't have too much expectation for it, because the number of tourists decreased, resulting in a continuous decrease in hotel staff, and there were countless hotels with discounted services. After check-in, I did find that the staff were not as complete as before the epidemic, and the fragrance in the lobby was not obvious. After arriving at the front desk, it took a while to check in. However, starting from the official check-in, this expectation began to be redefined. The smile radiated from under the mask radiated from the identity of every staff member I met, caring and talking like friends, but not overly crossing the boundary. Sometimes there will be a long wait for delivery after check-in, but a sincere apology will be received. There are many shortcomings, but because the people in it can only remember it as good. The hotel is almost the same, the people inside are the key to going back again.

Fairmont Wuhan
(The service trained by Accor Group is still in place.)

Geographical location:
Wuhan's cbd, Huaihai Road. It should be said that it is the financial district, Oceanwide has covered this place. Most of the locations of Oceanwide, which are similar to Hangzhou, are located in these places. Farther away from Wuhan Station, Hankou Station is closer!

Hotel check-in first experience:
Every hotel employee is very enthusiastic, and there is no slack. When you get off the bus, you will rush out with your suitcase. Now the elevator entrance is waiting for you to complete the check-in procedure and accompany you upstairs. It happened to catch up with the two room staff turning down the bed.

The rooms are mainly black, white and brown, which are relatively modern, but the sofa is quite old.

The waiters in the executive lounge are also very enthusiastic and can be said to provide one-to-one service. There are not many people. Afternoon tea is a three-story tower, and the breakfast is also very rich and not inferior to the contrast on the first floor! The evening is a set meal, which is pretty good [Hey ha]

Finally, thanks to the avia of the executive lounge and Eugene, the manager on duty in the lobby of the hotel, for their warm service!

msg:I stayed at Fairmont for the fourth time. I will fall in love with the hotel once I stay. Now I must choose Fairmont every time I travel to Wuhan on business.
Location: Next to the subway station in Wuhan Business District, near Hankou Railway Station, the traffic is convenient, and you can also stroll to Wansongyuan Xuesong Road for a delicious supper at night.
Environment: Simple and elegant, the lobby value of one million screens brings together the cultural characteristics of Jiangcheng. The crystal decorations next to the seats are also characteristic of mountains and rivers, and the thick carpet in the reception area is what a high-level hotel should have
Service: great. The waiter was very polite and soft-spoken. At first glance, he had gone through a lot of training. The manager Ediva was very patient and enthusiastic throughout the whole process. The flight was late and helped me check out late. The room is very comfortable, well-equipped, and many intimate little things, such as small scissors, ruler, stapler, loofah, shoe polisher, bath salt, etc., giving me every possible care, warm and homelike. The bedding is very comfortable.
In short, I enjoy it very much, and recommend it to those who pursue service and experience

msg:Fairmont is regarded as the best hotel in Wuhan. The hardware is nothing to say, and the decoration style is relatively simple, but without losing elegance, the lobby looks quite stylish. It is more convenient to have your own parking lot. It is a 5-minute drive from Hankou Railway Station and a 30-minute drive from Tianhe International Airport. The transportation is fairly convenient. There is a nice bar on the second floor, there are bands singing, and the price of cocktails is not expensive. The overall feeling is pretty good, the front desk service is also very good, the guest experience manager Ediva is also a full tracking service, responsive, overall it is a must-choice hotel for travel in Wuhan.

There are many delicious foods in Wansongyuan nearby, and it is also close to the high-speed railway station. The front desk service is very good, especially Ediva. I lost my mobile phone during the taxi ride, which helped me a lot. Thank you very much. Room toiletries lelabo Rose No. 31 is well received, like it.

At night because of the sound problem, the duty manager Li Dan also handled it in a very timely manner. Also on WeChat and I communicated and gave breakfast late and checked out until four o'clock in the afternoon. I hope I will definitely live in Wuhan next time I have a chance!

The hotel is located in the prosperous CBD, the geographical position is superior, travel, entertainment, shopping are relatively convenient. The design style is simple and modern. The only problem encountered is that the air conditioning in the room has been adjusted to 26 degrees, which is still very cold and needs to be improved. Finally, I would like to thank the front desk for the warm reception.

I have to say that the service at this hotel is really good 👍 Coincidentally, the little girl at the front desk is named "Li Dan" with my same name! Too fate! Will choose this next time.
The key point is that their swimming pool is really really good-looking and very popular! The young lady who loves to take pictures must come

msg:The hotel is located near Wuhan cbd. There is only one convenience store. The nearest place to eat is about a ten-minute walk from Oceanwide City Plaza. The hotel was newly opened at the end of 20 years. The decoration is very new and the facilities are quite good. The room size is large and the layout is bright. The overall style is European-style luxury style, which is different from Wanda Ruihua's European-style retro luxury style in Wuhan. Fairmont's decoration style is more popular among young people. Breakfast is also relatively rich in hotels of the same level. The variety of flavors is unbelievable. Actually there are tofu flower and duck blood vermicelli soup as a whole should be ranked in the top three in Wuhan
Hotel front desk Ediva warm service is good

msg:I came to Wuhan to eat lobster two days after the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. I was tired of Wanda Ruihua's nouveau riche style. I stayed at Fairmont Wuhan Oceanwide Hotel, and I felt good overall. The hotel's facilities, atmosphere, decoration and service basically met expectations.
Let me talk about a few highlights:
The first is the hotel gym. In a hotel with a price level of 1,000 yuan, the Wuhan Fairmont Gym has excellent facilities, quantity, and environment. The equipment is easy to use, new and well maintained.
The second is the hotel’s breakfast room, the decoration style is a bit inexplicable Nanyang style (similar to the Xiamen Andaz kind), not contrary and very warm.
The third is the room size and facilities, which are large in size, complete in functional areas, complete in facilities, and comfortable to live in.
Let me talk about a few more details that need to be improved: see the next 3 photos for details
First, the breakfast service needs to be improved. Breakfast will be taken at 10:30, but the table is empty at 9:30 and there is no one to supplement the meal.
Second, room facilities need to be overhauled frequently. For example, the glue ***** on the shower door is gone, and the door opening and closing sound is loud.
The third is to strengthen the cleaning of the gym. There are obvious sweat stains and dust on some equipment.
Fourth, the shower room and toilet room are not waterproof well, and water can seep from the shower room.

Xu Tingting at the front desk was very enthusiastic, the service was great, and I would stay there when I had a chance. The kids liked the swimming pool most. , The whole hotel is very popular. No matter how you shoot, it looks good.

衞生：不錯；

環境：裝的很有特色，但是窗外實在沒什麼景觀；
最最關鍵的是位置實在很差，周邊空空盪盪，啥也沒有。

再次來到武漢泛海費爾蒙，服務方面比夏天更好了
設施：聽説是19年底開業的酒店，保養的很好，設施很全。體驗了酒店的游泳池🏊 恆温超舒服，泳池也很大的。
衞生：小住了三天，每天房間都收拾的很乾凈，衣服摺疊整齊，雜亂的東西也幫忙擺放有序，好貼心！
環境：這家酒店在漢口，不論是我辦事還是夫人去購物🛍️都會很方便，距離哪裡都挺近的，但是又不吵鬧，這點不錯
服務：再次選擇這裏的原因依然是服務！我夫人強烈表揚Mandy小楊的服務，每一次來都無微不至的照顧，重點是總耐心的解答並真正的幫助到了我們，真心像回家一樣，這點是我出差這麼多地方住了這些個酒店裡沒感受到過的！

msg:這家酒店一入大堂就聞到特別好聞的香氛，並且整個大堂的設計非常靈動簡潔，在我看來，這是國內數一數二的高級簡約又大氣耐看的設計了，房間的設計也是簡潔明瞭。喜歡這種裝修的話非常值得買單。前台may非常專業，會和你介紹各營業點和設施，還會推薦武漢的吃喝玩樂。備品是澳洲的品牌，小眾特別，味道非常好聞，大瓶包裝了，也比較環保。房間的床品真的非常舒服，本來帶了一次性床品都沒有用上。因為房間的衞生做的非常乾淨，一絲不苟。另外，五樓的泳池非常漂亮，值得打卡，怪不得有很多明星入住。

算是親子友好酒店，除了嬰兒床還可以提供床圍，嬰兒澡盆還是挺不錯的，也會主動提供小童洗漱用品。
但是早餐真的真的完全低於預期，水果都不甜，麪點感覺都是速凍，蛋糕麪包都很一般，衹有粉面還算是不錯。算是我吃過的最難吃的連鎖五星級酒店早餐了。

msg:破天荒的第一次，努力尋找一個號稱奢華酒店的優點！
從哪裡説起呢？
1、晚上7：00左右抵達酒店，門口沒有門僮，衹有一個似保安非保安似門僮非門僮的老大爺，手足無措的看着我開車門下車，看着我們自己從後備箱搬行李；第二天有個大型會議，金鑰匙管家，帥氣門僮4-5個，所以也不是真沒有嘛，那是不是下班太早呢？！
2、酒店用的不知道什麼香氛，特別是大堂，濃郁得讓人頭暈。
3、辦理入住給前台小姐姐説不要頭尾房，拿了兩個房卡上樓一看，好嘛…背靠背兩間尾房，又去協調更換。
4、上到所住樓層，最先見到的居然是共享充電寶的租用機箱，簡直大開眼見🤣但凡客房備一根三頭充電線，也不至於如此尷尬。
5、進到房間，洗手間護理用具大大的抽屜裏孤零零躺着兩把牙刷，衹有一個總經理語錄大慨意思就是我們致力於環保減少一次性用品，需要什麼給我電話，至於需要什麼，我們有什麼，客人你猜😂！提倡環保當然重要，但是作為服務方，你們的備品提供不到位，提示服務做得也不到位！
6、衞生狀況堪憂，客房裝飾畫，床頭等地方的積灰有圖為證。
7、客房內的椅子怎麼形容呢，既不覺得美觀也毫無舒適度可言，完全不能理解它存在的意義，不知道酒店管理方是否親自去體驗過？
8、作為號稱奢華酒店的級別沒有開夜床服務（第二晚住的洲際，這方面相當到位）。
9、浴巾、毛巾包括浴袍，就是本來品質一般，又完全沒用柔順劑多次洗滌的那種感覺，誰懂？隔着屏幕都可以感覺刺皮膚，簡直不能忍受！整個房間最柔軟的居然是一次性拖鞋。
10、服務人員整體服務意識薄弱，都不要妄想關注住店客人的需求，就是你提出需求，要麼就是體現出來的結果就是沒當回事，要麼就是各種解釋的藉口和理由
比如對於給我們兩間尾房的解釋是大部分樓層這個房間旁邊還有一間套房，所以哪怕我這個樓層沒有套房，這個房間也不被他們定義為尾房；
再比如10：30收餐，我們9：40進入餐廳，鬆餅鐺一片華夫餅，五片被烤燈烤得毫無柔軟度的鬆餅，煎餅檔沒有工作人員，找其他工作人員反應要求做3片新鮮的鬆餅，答曰會通知通知，10：20一切如常，我放在一旁的盤子空空如也，找餐廳經理投訴，倒是態度很好的解決的，衹是後來補了一句，您以後有什麼需求給我們服務員説，負責出餐的同事搞不清楚🧐請問9：40到10：20這40分鐘裏，這個餅檔就衹有這麼點殘羹，你們餐廳服務員或者作為餐廳經理是沒有關注到還是覺得距離10：30收餐不到一小時，菜品要不要齊全，無所謂？！

唯一的優點，早餐的品質對標武漢的其他酒店應該算很好的，僅此一點而已

就是空調不給力，酒店説是室外温度比室內低，所以衹能開新風，沒法制冷……晚上挺熱的……

msg:對這個酒店這麼多好評，包括攜程的考核表示非常質疑！！！￼最後攜程賠付了350塊錢。這個酒店在武漢也算是比較貴的，但是服務和誠信特別差，酒店前台經理男士和前台滿嘴跑火車，撒謊臉都不紅！！！！！想在武漢打造高端的路線，可以德不匹配！！！！！因為這次接待的是比較重要的客户，特地選了攜程推薦的武漢比較貴的這家酒店。用了客户的姓名預訂，在攜程也提前備註預留角房，和前台也電話溝通交代過。第二天客户到店時間是一點多，辦理入住的時候，酒店壓根就沒有提預留的房間和安排事宜。入住之後，我打電話給攜程投訴，酒店反饋撒謊具體有三，1. 説客户到店時間比較晚，角房全部沒有了。實際客户1:00就到店，甚至連酒店退房時間都沒到，很多房間都沒有退。￼￼2.説和客户也説了，客户自己不要角房的。酒店前台以為客户是一個人辦理的入住，其實辦理入住的時候我也在旁邊，我是預訂人。3.房間設施，當天武漢的天氣20多度特別熱，酒店空調沒有製冷。跟酒店反饋之後他們説立馬打開讓稍等一會兒就可以，然後一直到晚上都沒有製冷，客户晚上一晚上都沒有睡好，衹能把窗户打開，截止第二天酒店都沒有打開製冷模式。4.退房的時候，因為是攜程高級會員，可以延遲一會兒退房，但是去開門的時候已經打不開。跟酒店前台聯繫，讓他們服務員開門，他們20分鐘都沒有上來。就是這種效率還想在武漢打造高端酒店，簡直可笑。￼這就是入住一次費爾蒙酒店的真實體驗。

事實證明這是個正確的選擇
酒店房間比較大 裝修佈局也比較喜歡 有化粧衣帽間
整體感覺和上海的寶麗嘉很像
整體設施維護的比較好 房間也比較新 住着還是挺舒服的
服務的話 都很有禮貌 會主動開車門 拿行李 有求必應
因為之後還有新加坡的行程也預訂了費爾蒙 諮詢了一些問題 也是有問必答
總之這個酒店對於來武漢選擇住宿
是個不錯的選擇
之後也會繼續考慮

因為有小朋友，還會有小朋友的用品（洗髮水、沐浴露、牙膏牙刷、肥皂）小朋友的拖鞋送到 很用心～
（本來住酒店都會自帶，這次忘記了，雪中送炭的感覺）
這次武漢行遊客太多，所以很大一部分時間在酒店休息 。
早餐的熱乾麪也很好吃 第一天吃了兩晚（省了午餐）
下次去武漢還會選擇這裏 ～

衞生：對於衞生我會關注水龍頭的銀色是否有水垢水跡，但住兩晚都沒有發現。並且沒有異味；

環境：簡約風格不錯；
服務：1、晚上有開床服務和附送蒸汽眼罩（但我兩個人住怎麼就開一邊和衹送一個？）；2、有私人管家服務，對武漢有疑問可以諮詢好處，給點贊！

msg:設施：就還行吧，住的套房，兩個衞生間，公衞馬桶不是智能的，內衞是。這種檔次的酒店電吹風不是戴森的。浴室窗户是鋁片百葉窗，關上就遮光，開着正對對面商務樓，私密性和採光衹能二選一。
衞生：第一天入住，地板有灰塵，和服務中心反映後立刻派人來打掃，這點還算OK。淋浴間的地面水漬斑斑，真的很不OK。
環境：房間隔音尚可，比較安靜。套房裝修比較簡約大氣。酒店距離漢口站蠻近的，去江灘也不算遠。
服務：有管家服務，但不是24小時的，響應還算比較及時。特別感謝zoey，最後一天碰巧生理期，幫我問同事借到衞生棉。

吐槽幾點：晚上沒有晚安茶或者晚安甜點，夜床服務衹負責調暗光線整理床品。備品不是每天送，第二天沒送過來，下午通知管家送一下，到了晚上回酒店都沒來，衹好再次打電話給禮賓部才送。因為碰上生理期，打電話問禮賓部可不可以提供衞生棉，回答很公式化不提供，後來還是管傢俬下問同事幫忙借的。
金尊的行政酒廊每天提供的早餐種類太少，下午茶的全套點心很普通。二樓的1907餐廳酒吧很踩雷，點的單人388的套餐，八成熟的牛排咬不動，火焰冰淇淋上淋的酒太多，導致外層蛋清全部糊裏面就是很普通的冰淇淋。套餐一共4個菜，每道菜上菜間隔20分鐘，上菜太慢！
整體來説，可以感覺到酒店是想做服務的，但是和真正的奢華酒店還有很大一段距離。

1. 費爾蒙豪華雙床房與雙床房，衹是樓層不一樣。辦理入住時前台説有給升級到豪華，50多平的房間，但除去衞生間，房內放了雙床之外空間所剩無幾；
2. 打包早餐很不人性：因為要去坐8點多的高鐵，來不及堂食，被告知衹能打包冷的麪包和果汁。一四歲一六歲小朋友想吃幾個煮蛋和香腸，説熱食不可以裝。但其實大家都知道酒店擺出來的早餐，除非是現做的，其它大都不太熱了。後面我力爭了幾句，讓我簽了字才給裝了幾顆雞蛋和兩根香腸…
3. 泳池，也是最重要的一點：衝著費爾蒙的泳池去的，兩個泳池一冷一熱確實很棒，小朋友大泳池玩冷了可以來按摩池泡一會，期間還有其它三四個小朋友在，但全程沒有安全員看管。期間，我老公外出問了一趟，進來一個安全員站在門口張望了幾分鐘就走了。相比在洲際，儘管衹有我們一家三口，安全員全程坐在他的位置上沒有離開。

目前正在酒店的床上寫下這份點評，我寫點評的次數是屈指可數的，但是每一次寫點評都是遇到了令我十分無語的事情，或者是氣憤的事情。一家所謂的聽説的比較好的武漢五星級酒店，在我一天結束回房間大概10:00準備洗澡的時候，我剛剛把衣服脱完走進去，打開熱水，準備洗澡，我將熱水龍頭轉到最熱處，保持了大概兩分鐘的時間，水出的仍然是不熱的温水，這時我開始懷疑是不是我的操作有問題，緊接着我將龍頭轉到另外一邊的最底端水變成了涼水，這時我確認了逆時針轉到底就是熱水，在熱水轉到最底的時候，沒有熱水。然後房間內十分的寒冷，我冒着寒冷出來擦乾身體，穿好浴袍。氣憤的打了總枱的電話，總枱給出的解釋是我們酒店因為住房客量大，所以導致沒有熱水，很多顧客已經反饋了這個現象，我對他們説這並不是理由，就算你們是買房也應該擁有熱水，熱水是一個酒店的基本，你們連熱水都沒有，是怎麼評的上五星級酒店的。他隨即説會去解決，會叫工程部起解決，我問他時間如何，他沒有給我明確答覆。15分鐘到20分鐘後，我打電話追問，什麼時候有熱水？那邊給出的答覆是20分鐘，這時已經從10:00which is我準備要洗澡的時間已經大概到了11:00了。等到大概11:15的時候，他才告知我有熱水了,然而就在剛剛十分鐘之前，在我寫這篇文章的第一個字的前一分鐘，我從浴室出來發現水仍舊不是很熱,我的原計劃是盆浴，現在計劃全部泡湯了，因為那個水的温度根本不支持盆浴，我甚懷疑放多少水他就涼多少。武漢是一個城市，這個城市並不像其他的山城或者在山上的某些酒店擁有熱水難以輸送上去或者是難以製造熱水的這類問題，出現這些問題實屬不應該。望加以改進。

2.攜帶行李辦理入住，説把行李箱直接送到房間，回答人手不夠，不能送。回來拿房卡和行李箱發現三四個人在禮賓台呆站。
3.房間裏除了牙刷，其他用品沒有，要問才給你送剃鬍刀、浴帽。

msg:出差來武漢，前台May瞭解到我來主要目的是工作，和我熱情介紹可以嚐到武漢地道美食的餐廳，和一些比較經典的景點，黃鶴樓，長江輪渡，雖然我們也沒空額…然後給我送了水果和升級了房型。May安排了邊角的房間，面積很大，對於我來説，無比舒適，雙面落地窗，果然如他所説，景色很好，而且房型是正正方方的的角房。酒店房間裏面的床很舒適，服務態度非常不錯。設施這塊在武漢酒店數一數二吧，看到奢華排行第一。果然房間的設施非常先進，都不用插電。同時房間裏面的衞生很乾凈，床品整齊的一絲不亂，對於出差來説，酒店位置很好離機場近，離武漢出名的幾條美食街都很近，第二天前台退房快速，是一次非常不錯的入住體驗。

走近大廳站了那麼多服務人員
但是辦入住衹有兩個前台在辦 所以等了特別久 有其他客人插隊也是絲毫不管
房間能明顯感覺裝修的味道很大
房間隔音不太行 附近房間進出門的聲音很大影響休息
外賣衹能放在室外的桌子上
夏天那麼熱你但凡不秒下去拿就可能不太行了
退房以後在大堂茶吧的一個桌子上想吃一下外賣再去火車站
有位員工就過來讓我們去室外的桌子上吃 明確表達了願意在此消費也不讓吃
溝通後才給我們安排在了餐廳
我真的覺得酒店服務業別搞這些面子工程
站一堆人在哪 客人的需求也沒照顧到啥

2、泳池更衣間到處都是用過的毛巾和拖鞋，沒有人收拾，泳池邊更是連浴巾和礦泉水都沒有。所謂網紅也不知道是在紅什麼。
3、酒店早餐乏善可陳，難的住店會沒有吃早餐的慾望。
4、酒店位子很偏，周圍就是開發商務區。
5、也是讓我最不能接受的一點，也是這篇評論的原因，2號退房，工作人員誤操作，將我已經在攜程上付款過的訂單再次扣款，當下溝通時説一週後系統會自動退款，週一電話聯繫過一回説系統原因，等到今天已經過去10天，還是沒有退款，非常影響了付款寶賬單的情況。
以上請自行分辨。

msg:據説是武漢比較好的酒店了，住了一晚可能評價不全面，比較好的是酒店的設計和裝潢，整體比較時尚，前台和禮賓部的服務比較好，很有禮貌也比較貼心。
比較普通的是酒店的早餐、客房和個別早餐服務員的態度，不知道是太忙還是怎麼，部分人員有點敷衍。另外酒店的頂噴花灑比較一般，出水太小了，以及酒店的床太軟，不適合喜歡睡硬床的人，但聽説可以換硬床墊，介意的人可以試試。
比較差的是酒店周邊的環境，比較冷清和荒涼，離主要的商圈都比較遠，短期內應該不會再入住，畢竟武漢挺堵車，去哪都挺麻煩的。

但是我覺得價格還是有點不值，同等價位的酒店住過就有了對比：1.窗外景色很一般 2.衞生間地磚發黃瓷磚有點破損 3.沒有智能馬桶蓋，手機架上很臟 4.洗浴用品不是獨立的 5.游泳池沒有網上圖片那麼好看
總得來説還可以，雖然沒有達到預期，但是酒店服務還都挺不錯的。

msg:評論裏説是武漢最奢華的酒店，好吧，奢華2字真的沒有看到，舒適麼，還可以。
全酒店最好的覺得是早餐，佈置優雅，品類比較豐富，可惜並沒有武漢特色，豆皮綠豆湯都沒有，武漢特色的過早基本沒有，熱乾麪要自己拌，説實話，外地人自己拌是辦不出來武漢特色的，所以不好吃。
房間中規中矩，床一般、枕頭一般、裝修一般，咖啡機很雞肋，因為咖啡膠囊就赤裸裸放在抽屜裏，這樣不是就臟了嗎？怎麼喝…..
前台的小妹妹挺熱情，説管家會聯繫我們，可是酒店的管家、幫忙拿箱子不知道什麼職位的幾個人都是小妹妹，有個個子特別高的，拿鼻孔看着我，我也不知道都是幹嘛的，住這裏的都是大叔嗎？
接待客人、應對自如、有眼裡見兒，這些能力可能得35歲以後才有，不是年輕一點漂亮一點就能具備的。
本來想如果舒服就多住2天，不舒服就算了，然後就一天吧
