msg:I am extremely impressed and happy with alot of great things staying at Novotel Bell Tower Xian.

1.Awesome location, right outside is Zhonglou station and nearby is Bell tower, there are malls and many eateries nearby too, just need to use underpass to get to the malls.

2. very helpful and friendly service staffs and the cleaning staff. I noticed the cleaner has very good observation, for e.g. I didn't bring my toothpaste so I had to open 1 packet of toothbrush set just to use toothpaste, i went out for the day, my room was cleaned when I returned, I noticed the cleaners placed 2 pieces of mini toothpaste for me at the sink. :)

3. when I ordered delivery items from mei tuan. the counter staff sent to my room using their robot, which is such a cute sight.

4. the breakfast spread are rather decent

5. Hotel is generous with drinking water, alot of hotels in China seemed to have a capped limit in providing drinking water bottles per room day. but this hotel really surprised me.

6. love the convenience of self service laundromat at the hotel too, really convenient for me. 

I would love to stay at this hotel should I travel to Xian again! thank you so much!

Upon check in, the staff was rather impatient as it was the wee hours but they did service recovery very quickly.

Very clean rooms and staff was exceptionally friendly helping with the navigation, especially Wison, who was so patient.

酒店非常好，工作人员非常乐于助人和热情。房间很棒，早餐非常好，中式方面多一点。优越的地理位置，就在科蒂中心。
唯一的缺点是有很多客人在房间和走廊吸烟，管理层应该以更严肃的方式执行禁烟政策。 
The only downsize is that there are many guests that smoke in the rooms and corridor, managment should enforce non smoking policy on a more serious way.

msg:Great hotel in the city center of Xi'an. One entrance/exit (H) of the metro station is directly in front of the building. The area is very vivid. On one hand this is nice because a lot of shops, food vendors and attractions (like the Bell Tower) are nearby. On the other hand this makes the area really busy and loud. People are singing and performing on the street, which can be heard in the rooms (at least in our room 8601, the window was really thin).
The staff at the reception can't understand or speak English (only very rudimentary). Communication worked (with translation apps) though and they seemed nice.
The room is really spacious and clean. The cleaning staff is neat and quick. 
The light situation in the room isn't ideal. Daylight from the window doesn't reach the other side of the room properly, where the sink, shower and toilet are located. The room lights in front of the mirror or under the shower are pretty shallow. Which makes getting ready there not really comfortable. Especially if you wanna do your make up in front of the mirror. There is no special light for such pourposes, like in other hotels.
Aside from the light the shower is amazing. It's huge, has a "dry" area where you can hang or place stuff that doesn't get wet, has different shower heads and gets warm pretty fast.
In theory the AC has different settings. But even the "warmest" setting (32°C) gets too cold with time. So there's only really two options: switching the AC on or off.
For Chinese standard the matress wasn't that hard, but far away from soft. For the TV you need a special app to use, which we didn't get to work. So especially if you're a foreigner and want to use the TV, consider this. You're able to connect your own HDMI cable though.
There's no manual cleaning sign which you can hang outside your door. Instead there's a light signal next to the room door which indicates if you don't want to be distrubed. A switch inside activates it. Sometimes the light indicator didn't seem to work properly, because the cleaning staff came in even when we activated it. What also needs to be considered is the fact that the light indicator needs power from the room. It can only be activated when the key card is in the room. So if you don't want anyone entering and cleaning your room at all this system isn't ideal. It wasn't a big deal for us, but would be better if there was a normal cleaning sign.
The door had 2 locks on the inside, which we really liked. 
All in all a nice hotel and room, would recommend staying here.

Great room, lovely modern bathroom, very clean. My only criticism is that the hotel wouldn’t accept a Mastercard credit card for payment for breakfast - the reception staff gave us a discount for our cash instead but for an international chain it really should accept credit card. Xi’an is amazing - beautiful pagodas, old city streets and of course the Terracotta Army (hotel staff can help you buy tickets on WeChat).

Every staff was so kind and helpful and you feel welcomed! (but you need to use a Chinese translator app for better communication) The room condition was good too but sometimes the noise from the ceiling was a little bothering at night. Luckily I didn’t feel too bad though. The free afternoon is in the lobby for everyone. I expected something nicer but it turned out some cut fruits and snacks with paper up tea. It was still a nice treat! Also I loved their gym. It was small and didn’t have equipments except a set of dumbbells and two treadmills. However they prepared free water, towels, and the super clean space to comfortably work out.

The room was a bit average, the Bell tower hotel is far cheaper a bit older but has much bigger rooms. The gym has two running machines and some free weights? Got a better gym in average units in Australia. The laundry facilities are handy and a bonus. Cant say a sink in the main room is a bonus. I can not recommend the breakfast, very low quality fruit and bread I guess its ok if you are into Chinese breakfast and eat meat. The coffee is gross even Macas has better coffee. I would not consider staying here again. To expensive for what you get compared to the other hotels and accommodation available. The location is convenient to the metro, bell&drum tower, mosque, markets and south gate etc

We had full use of the amenities at the hotel (including a gym which was always available!). The rooms were clean and spacious, however, the cold air had been switched off for the winter period and our room was insufferably hot, resulting in uncomfortable night sleeps. Our window to the room opened onto what could be described as a narrow courtyard, with four walls which meant that heat would be trapped and therefore did not provide cool air to the already hot room. We would definitely stay at this hotel again, but when we are able to control to temperature better. For example, in the summer.

I had a great experience at  Novotel Xi'an this summer. I've spent just a couple of days, and everything was just perfect. The accommodations are modern and very well maintained. The staff was always very attentive to any small need I eventually had. That included little small things like waiting to see which table I'll be using for my breakfast to then silently add silverware by my plate while I was helping myself at the buffet - and I have never asked for that. In particular, the hotel manager - Leo Wu - went above and beyond his duties to help me with my trip - from assisting in making arrangements with the tour guide from help with ordering food to be delivered on a night I came back late from the Terracotta Warriors site. I really recommend the Novotel Xi'an. The hotel is very well located and maintained and mainly due to the people who run the place - Leo and his staff.

The deluxe king-size bed room I booked was upgraded to an executive king-size bed room for free. The area is about the same, there is no view outside the window, and there is a terrace. The service staff is very friendly, and mineral water is provided free of charge. The executive room is separated into two areas, depending on personal preference. Some people commented that the noise outside is very noisy, but this one is not at all, very quiet. The only problem is that there is a sound above the wardrobe when the air conditioner is turned on, and we have both rooms, which needs to be solved. For meals, I recommend the scallion pancakes from Ma Lao San Hu La Tang Restaurant and Chengcheng Shui Pan Lamb.

Due to the design of the door, almost if you let it go, it will cause a lot of noise. In addition, there is a design problem with the room partitions. You can hear people talking and singing in the next room. In addition, because the location is very lively, so The constant sound of horns also continued until midnight, so the hotel specially provided earplugs when checking in, but they were basically useless because you would still be disturbed even if you wore earplugs.

msg:First of all, let’s talk about the location. It is very close to the clock tower. You can get to the hotel immediately after exiting Exit H of Metro Line 2. However, it takes about 10 minutes to walk to the exit of Metro Line 2. You can go to the front desk on the second floor to check in because there are children. After I was given a small hairpin and assigned to a room on the 8th floor, there was a buzzing sound when I entered the door. I don’t know where it came from. The area of ​​the room was not very large, and everything that should be there was still there. It belongs to a budget hotel. Since we are still living during the Lantern Festival, the price is not cheap, but overall it is good. The cleaning aunt is very polite. There are small robots for delivery. There is a breakfast place on the second floor, a laundry room and a gym. Afternoon tea and late night snacks arranged at small tables are generally good and convenient.

The hotel has a direct bus to the Terracotta Warriors and Horses, and tickets can be purchased at the hotel front desk. When traveling to Xi'an, staying at Novotel Bell Tower is very cost-effective.

When you park your luggage in the ba*****t, you have to ask which elevator is closest. Fortunately, the front desk in the lobby sent someone to pick up the luggage in a cart. Otherwise, I probably wouldn’t be able to find the hotel for half an hour... The room was pretty good, and the bed in the parent-child room was very big. Ordinary standard rooms are okay, but the rooms are too hot! ! ! It's really hot.

The window sill in the room is high. The breakfast is relatively simple. It is very convenient to have a washing machine and dryer. The TV cannot cast the screen, which is not very good. In line with the positioning of a modern business hotel, it is generally recommended to stay. The front desk asked guests to operate their mobile phones by giving them small gifts and also required them to have a five-star rating, which was very distasteful. It doesn’t matter whether you give small gifts or not. As long as the service quality and facilities are convenient and easy to use, you will naturally get good reviews. The front desk staff should not interfere with the guests’ right to independent evaluation.

msg:The first honest negative review on Ctrip was given to this hotel.

I am willing to take the time to write this honest review. Please choose carefully and be sure to read the negative reviews, including why the hotel comes with two earplugs as standard, why there are so many positive reviews, etc.
1. The overwhelming praise in the reviews stems from the fact that as soon as they entered the store and checked in, the front desk actively asked customers to write positive reviews many times. (The guest has just arrived at the hotel for a few minutes and has not yet entered the room) Urging you to give a good review
2. The front desk moved us to a corner room on the 8th floor under the guise of asking for a room upgrade. At first we were quite happy that we had been upgraded for no reason. Unexpectedly... the front desk did not inform the room that there would be very serious noise in the middle of the night. After 10 o'clock, the entire corridor was filled with deafening noise.
3. In the middle of the night and early in the morning, I couldn’t bear the disturbance and wanted to change rooms. The hotel engineer came up and said that the sound insulation *****s could be adjusted, but in fact he also knew that it would have no effect.
4. Problem at the front desk: Changing rooms in the middle of the night, the tone was extremely impatient. We were asked to go downstairs to check in, and only after raising questions did we ask a robot to send us the room card. The caller even said at the beginning that no guests had complained about the noise problem, which was obviously a lie. You can search the comment area for everyone's true comments. , the noise is very very serious. The next day when I checked out and settled the loss, I knew what I had done and clearly avoided us and stood behind me.

One of the two receptionists in the middle of the night said that he didn't know about the first day of work, and the other said that he was an intern and didn't know. I have no idea. Is there any neglect in employee training?

5. The hotel manager was called after midnight, and we took out other guest reviews and admitted that there was a noise problem. We question why we didn’t tell them in the first place?

The manager said that it was located in the air-conditioning room and that the noise was so small that some other people could accept it. This explanation was also ridiculous. The room we originally stayed in was deliberately arranged for us to such a noisy room so that more guests could stay. This is cheating. Although we were later refunded and processed, we had a very poor rest. It was already past two o'clock in the morning and we had an early start the next day, so we were very exhausted.

If you travel to Xi'an, you must be careful to avoid lightning. The reviews I've been getting are ultimately untenable.

advantage:
1. The location is very convenient, right next to the Bell and Drum Tower.
2. The room is clean
3. The bedding is very comfortable
4. The cleaning aunts are warm and polite, better than the service at the front desk
shortcoming:
1. The front desk service still needs to be further improved.
For example: Some minor issues need to be communicated satisfactorily through Ctrip.
For example, the problem of afternoon tea, such as the problem of borrowing nail clippers
2. I wanted to book a room with a view on a high floor. In order to have a view, I chose to give up the hotel's free upgrade. As a result, there was still no view, and the room was really too small.

First of all, the location is very good, the hardware facilities are very new, and the rooms are spacious. About 20 meters out of the hotel door is the entrance and exit of Metro H. Next to it is Yisushe Cultural and Commercial Street, where there are some time-honored restaurants. Amap navigates to the entrance of the hotel, which is the entrance to the underground parking lot, and it is very convenient to enter and exit. 2. Special thanks to the security officer who was on duty on the first floor at 12 noon on the Mid-Autumn Festival on the 29th. He was worried that we would not be able to find the parking area after getting off the elevator and took a detour. He personally took us down and through the commercial street to find the parking area. I have never felt such enthusiasm when staying in a hotel. It happened to be the Mid-Autumn Festival, and it really made me feel the warmth of family. Unfortunately, I forgot to ask his name because I was in a hurry. 3. We arrived at three o'clock in the morning on the 29th. My husband got out of the parking lot and parked, and I checked in with my two children. The front desk staff checked in in a timely manner and did not ask us to wait for my husband to arrive before checking in because he was not there. After that, he opened a separate room card for my husband and swiped the elevator to go upstairs to the room. A considerate check-in service. 4. The eldest sister named Ren who does cleaning during the day is very careful in cleaning. When she saw that there were two children, she specially put extra supplies. She was very enthusiastic and felt considerate again. 5. At around 11 o'clock in the evening, we went out to the clock tower to take pictures, and then came back to the front desk on the second floor to inquire about breakfast. My girl is super tall. The front desk clerk Hu Zeze was very enthusiastic and gave us breakfast and Mid-Autumn Festival moon cakes, making us feel at home again. During my family's hurried Mid-Autumn Festival trip, the warm and thoughtful service of the hotel's grassroots staff filled my heart with warmth and eliminated the fatigue of the journey. It makes me want to tell people around me that Novotel Campanile is a hotel dedicated to providing thoughtful service to its customers.

The sanitary conditions are also ideal. The room is mainly made of floor tiles, and there is only a large felt under the big bed. It is relatively clean and tidy.
It is worth mentioning that there is an unlimited supply of bottled drinking water, so you can drink water at any time. What deserves improvement is that the capacity of the glue bottle filled with water is too small, which wastes a lot of plastic.
When booking this hotel, please note that most rooms do not have a street view outside the window. If you want a room with a window view, you must check with the hotel carefully first.

msg:In terms of location, the hotel is in a good location, right next to the clock tower, and it is indeed in the core area. It's not far from the Huifang area. If you really want to go, I suggest you go there by bike. The hotel is located in the newly developed cultural district of Yisushe, but this district gives me the impression that there are many restaurants. Next to the hotel is Xi'an Restaurant and some other restaurants. But I didn’t eat in this community because I was in a hurry.
Service: The hotel staff are very enthusiastic. Nothing particularly impressed me though. But it can be seen that the hotel has a complete training process, and it also shows the quality of the hotel waiter Ying.
Catering: I didn’t eat in the hotel, so I can’t comment. The main reason is that there are so many delicious food in Xi’an. Unless there are special circumstances, I think you don’t need to book breakfast in the hotel. There are many better ones outside.
Parking: This is indeed a minus point. The hotel does not have its own parking lot, but uses the entire community's parking lot, although the hotel reimburses parking fees. But from the parking lot to the hotel, you have to go to the ground floor, then drag your luggage for more than 50 meters, and then take the elevator to the second floor to reach the hotel's front desk. It doesn't matter if it's a small luggage, but if the person staying at the hotel is a woman and dragging a large suitcase, it will be a bit difficult. It is suggested that the hotel can make improvements, such as asking guests in advance whether they drive. If they drive to the hotel, can the hotel staff go down to the underground parking lot to pick them up. After all, when I checked in for the first time, even if the hotel was close to the parking lot elevator, the guests were still a bit distracted. At least I still had some swerve at the time.
Room hardware: The smart toilet is good, thumbs up. But there were three areas in the room that didn't feel very good. First (this is a flaw), the bathroom and shower are separated by a frosted glass. Although they can't see each other clearly, they can still see a vague shadow and movement of each other. There is a very embarrassing situation, that is, when one person is taking a shower and another person is using the toilet, both of them always feel that the other person is looking at them. Embarrassing!! The second thing is that the WIFI is not very stable and the network speed is not fast. Sometimes the video will freeze, so I have to switch to mobile data. The third is that the TV screen projection in the room is just a decoration, but it just can't be cast. As a network engineer, I tried it several times without success, and I didn't bother to call for consultation, so I gave up. Second and third, I think they can be improved. The first point has been renovated and there should be no possibility of improvement.

This is the first time I have reviewed a Novotel Xi'an Bell Tower hotel in public. I stayed there for 4 days.
1: On the day of check-in (around 11:17), we notified the previous guest in advance that he had not checked out in time, and they could help us arrange another room to check in. Their room attendants were also very fast, and they were already ready when I checked in (but I It’s not clear whether another room was arranged for us) It’s very efficient, so that when we check in, the room is not ready and the guests have to wait.
2: I found that the hygiene of the room is very good, at least the surface hygiene is so clean that no dust can be seen (especially after moving in, there is no dust on the full-length mirror. As we all know, when a spotlight is shined, the original shape is revealed, hehehe) The slippers are on the ground, and the soles are not black (after all, I have stayed in better hotels, and the hygiene is not as good as this)
Three: When I checked in, I found that there were no fruits or drinks. I was also informed of the time and location for afternoon tea (because I booked an executive king room), and immediately contacted the housekeeper, who immediately delivered them (I was out for a walk at the time, and the housekeeper said that I could ask the room attendant to directly send in)
Four: The location of the hotel is very good. It is also near the Bell Tower and Drum Tower Muslim Street (very close to walking distance), and it is very lively.
Five: The hotel breakfast is so-so. One more thing: fruits, water, and drinks are replenished every day. I can’t finish them. The service is great.

If the weather is cool, you can walk directly there. You can see the clock tower when you look out of the room.

The kids loved it so much that they took off their shoes and started playing as soon as they entered. The overall facilities of the room are good, but the room is a bit small. The hotel is in a very good location, very close to the Bell Tower subway station, just out of Exit H. In addition, I found a piece of clothing missing after leaving the store, and Hang Xing at the front desk also helped to send it by express delivery. Thank you very much. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. The location is great and the service attitude is great. There are many places to eat next to the hotel, and it is not far from various snack streets.

Next to the hotel is the shopping mall. Downstairs of the shopping mall are buildings and snacks from the 1970s. A few dozen meters outside the hotel is the subway station to the Terracotta Warriors and Horses Museum. Huaqing Pool, Tang Dynasty Evernight City and other attractions are very convenient.
Manager Zhang Jintao at the front desk of Novotel Bell Tower is warm, thoughtful and affable. He even upgraded the room with breakfast for free. Thank you! This trip to Xi'an ended perfectly! Highly recommend Novotel Xi'an!

You can go to the floor by swiping your room card. It is safe. There is a small robot that can deliver food to the door of the room. , Xiao Xue at the front desk was so enthusiastic and answered all my questions. He was patient and attentive. Seeing that I was raising a child alone, he upgraded me to a parent-child room. The bed was so big that I no longer had to worry about my child falling off the bed! There are also a few bottles of drinks in the refrigerator that you can drink for free. At this price and in this location, this service is a great value!

In terms of details, there are free drinks in the small refrigerator every day and unlimited mineral water, which is very considerate. 24 hour free laundry and gym. The location is great. Exit H of Zhonglou Station is right at the door. It is very convenient to go anywhere. My family all said that we will definitely stay here again next time we come. Very good memories, a very pleasant trip, and a very comfortable hotel.

If I have to make suggestions, the paid breakfast buffet is actually not bad, but I have higher requirements for Novotel: the breakfast can be improved a little bit. I went for breakfast at 9 o'clock, and there was still an hour left before the end of the day. The steamed buns and steamed dumplings with meat fillings were gone, and only the ones with sweet fillings were left. When I asked the staff, they said they didn't have any more (can't they refill if they are gone? Otherwise, how can we call it a buffet)? Also, the ice powder is hard to describe in words, so don’t display it if you can. But overall there are quite a lot of choices, both Chinese and Western. Western food is pretty good. There is a freshly made noodle chef who fry the dumplings freshly first. The noodles are really fragrant and great. The fried vegetables are also delicious. Dessert cakes need to be improved.

The location is relatively good, just outside the Drum Tower, and quite close to scenic spots such as Muslim Street and the City Wall. It only takes about 20 minutes to ride to the Provincial Expo.
The environment is quite clean and the hardware facilities are also good. There are also free afternoon tea and late night snacks!
Anyway, I just didn’t think of any drawbacks. A little surprised.

msg:I can't wait to write a review. I'm very satisfied! I started making travel plans more than a month in advance. I looked at the hotel for a long time and finally chose Novotel after comprehensive consideration. It turns out that I made the right choice😁 Let me talk about the location first. In Yisu Street, you don’t have to worry about eating and having fun. We went to see Qingqu Club’s cross talk show on the first night, which is right next to it. The subway entrance is less than 100 meters away, which is very convenient for travel. The Bell Tower and Kaiyuan Mall are within walking distance. The direct train to the Terracotta Warriors and Horses on the second day was right in front of the Yisu Grand Theater and next to the hotel. Another important point for me was that the room was very quiet and I slept soundly every night. The hotel staff were very nice. Enthusiastic. The security guard on the first floor would help us press the elevator every time we went back. I felt a little embarrassed. Manager Hang also upgraded our room type and gave us a small gift at the front desk when we checked out. If we hadn't moved to Huashan, we would have stayed there again. How many nights to stay 😄

There are several time-honored restaurants outside the hotel, which is convenient for eating, including breakfast (one restaurant sells steamed buns in the morning, which are delicious)
The summary is that the price-performance ratio is very high, and it is recommended to stay here

The air conditioning and heating are sufficient in the middle of winter. I can't comment without having breakfast. There are many restaurants of various grades around the hotel. Not far away are the Bell Tower and Drum Tower, which are very lively at night. Next to the hotel is the old Xinhua Bookstore in Xi'an, which has many cultural and creative products.
The hotel is conveniently located, only a few dozen meters away from entrance H of Metro Line 6 and Line 2. It is very convenient to take Line 2 to Xi'an North Station, but please note that it is nearly 500 meters to walk underground and take the Line 2 online train to Xi'an North Station. There is a distance of 10 stations, and the security check queues at both ends are time-consuming during peak traffic periods. It is best to depart from the hotel to catch the high-speed train at least one and a half hours in advance.

I asked to change rooms, but I changed them back to Haoda. It was also by the road and it was quite noisy at night. , the sanitation is also very average. The garbage bags were not changed on the first day. The hair dryer was still in the same place when I came back from somewhere in the morning. This five-star rating is a bit unsatisfactory.

I walked to the Forest of Steles/City Wall for a quarter of an hour, and walked to Muslim Street for a quarter of an hour. The surrounding area is full of food. After checking in, I found out that this is a subsidiary of Huazhu Club. After experiencing it, the facilities are very good, and the smart toilet in the room is very good, which is newer than the hotel I stayed in the last time I went to Japan. The service is also very standardized, not much different from foreign brands. For those who bring a lot of electronic devices and computers, this hotel has the most charging ports and is the most friendly, and the office is also the most convenient. Xiaohang at the front desk gave her a Dragon Boat Festival sachet, and changed the double bed room into a twin bed room according to my needs. He also said that we stayed for three nights including the Dragon Boat Festival, so the price was expensive, and gave us a discounted breakfast. A very satisfactory stay experience.

The lady who checked in forgot her name (there were so many badges hanging on her chest, I didn’t know which one to look at). She later took us to see other room types in 607, because the rooms we booked were all interior rooms without a view. , In fact, it’s nice to have a couch in this room type in the interior view. It’s not as bad as imagined, and my husband doesn’t really pick it up.
The fly in the oin**ent is that just after getting off the plane, I received a call from the hotel asking when we expected to arrive, and then directly told us that the room we booked had no view, no view. I also asked the guest on the phone what the view would be if the other room types were upgraded, but I kept insisting that there was no view on the phone (well, it’s all about saving money). However, we only stayed for one night and the view is not that important. But because I mentioned this matter, I felt unbalanced in my heart.

Facilities: The overall facility looks good, very new, and there are cute robots to deliver food.

Hygiene: Some of the cups and so on in the room still have visible dust, which was not mentioned during the store. One of the towels was also rubbed against something. I don't know if it was left by the previous guest.

Environment: The environment as a whole is very warm, with the taste of Novotel. The concierge brother who arrived at the gate of the hotel at noon on the 8th felt very nice. In the end, I left a cake at check-out 🎂 and I really couldn’t eat it anymore. Thank you to the hotel for calling to let me know. Unlike some hotels, they only tell you if you have it if you ask, and they don’t tell you if you don’t ask.

In addition, I saw that some people gave fruit and some gave yogurt in Ctrip's comments. But there is nothing in our room, maybe the level is not enough, and we didn't call specifically to ask, thinking that it will be delivered later.

Habitually write 5 points, and will not write bad reviews like some people, knowing that it is not easy to be a hotel. Next time, I will bring my husband to Xi'an again. You may consider changing the brand. After all, this is the only one under Accor that is so close to the subway?

msg:The worst hotel I have ever stayed in, because Ctrip recommended this five-diamond hotel. It's really hard to say, the cell phone in the room has no signal at all, and the call cannot be made, which is tantamount to losing contact. The sound insulation is not bad, but there is no sound at all. The sound of talking in the corridor is the same as lying in the ear. The strange thing is that there is no window (in the hotel's words, there are windows, they are inner windows, and they are just facing the white wall). At three o'clock, let's imagine what this room looks like. Then there are safety hazards in the bathroom, the metal *****s are peeled and easy to cut. The location of the hotel is really good, but it is recommended to stay carefully

The front desk and room service are all excellent. Will stay here again. The only flaw is that the soundproofing of the room is not very good, but earplugs are thoughtfully provided.

1 There is noise in the room and I am woken up at six o'clock every morning.

2 On the third day of my stay, the door lock was broken. I went back and forth to the front desk twice but couldn't solve it for me. I called a technician to check and they said there was a problem with the door lock. Someone came to the lobby and asked if he needed to change rooms for us. He asked twice but did not answer directly and did not offer any compensation.

3. I was asked to write a review after leaving the hotel, but I didn’t. Instead, they called me and sent me text messages to inquire about my accommodation. In the text message, I replied that I was not very satisfied and explained the reasons. However, I did not receive a reply. Where is the service attitude and awareness? I originally expected to get a sincere reply, so this negative review would not appear. Neither the hotel facilities nor the service attitude are at the level expected of a five-star hotel.

Afternoon tea cannot be called afternoon tea, it is very simple and rough.

They said that the management would not allow it to be turned on. For the house you rented with money, your air conditioner had to be told by the management whether it could be turned on. ? Is there any problem with your thinking? Is your property management company paying for your air conditioning? They have the final say on whether it can be opened? So according to what you said, if the property can't turn on the air conditioner when it's 40 degrees in the summer, will you just go on like this?

No matter what temperature it’s outside, there’s only a blower function. It’s 26°C and the room is so hot that you have to open the window to get a little cool sleep. What is the difference between Juejue and a hostel?
And on the second night, Xi'an cooled down to 16°C outside, and the room and hotel lobby always felt 28°C+. I don't know how the ventilation or fresh air system works, and it doesn't work.
Next time I come to Xi'an, I will not stay again and I will not recommend this hotel.

It is the subway station where you go. It's very convenient. The main reason is that it's very close to the subway station. But when I first arrived, I couldn't find Exit H to change the line.

Since I was one of the first ones to check in at 11 a.m., I called to ask for a change of room. Because I was staying in room 325, I felt that the floor was low and would have a big impact. But the front desk staff assured me that there would be no construction here and it would be fine, so I believed him and didn't change rooms. As a result, at 8:00 the next morning, hammer drilling started right downstairs in our room and continued until we checked out. Then after we talked about the noise problem, the front desk staff skillfully brought out a coffee cup as a small apology gift, but we didn't ask for it. In fact, when we stay in a hotel, we can all understand some minor problems, but you can't just swear that it's fine when we discover the problem and take precautions, and apologize with a small gadget afterwards. You can obviously change me to a higher floor the day before. room instead of sending me a coffee mug to say thank you for being obedient after ruining my day!

msg:The main reason for choosing Novotel is its strategic location, which is very convenient to the city wall and the Bell and Drum Tower!
When I made the reservation, I found that the price with breakfast included was actually 400 yuan higher than that without breakfast. I felt very strange! So I chose Wuzao! When we arrived at the hotel, the front desk introduced the hotel enthusiastically and said that it would be more convenient to buy breakfast coupons at the front desk at a discounted price of 99 yuan for two breakfasts! I wanted to bring my child with me for convenience, so I agreed. The front desk took my mobile phone to help me with the operation, but I didn’t react at the time. When I returned to the room, I found out: I had actually registered as a Huazhu member! So I asked the front desk and got the answer that only by purchasing a membership can you get complimentary breakfast! Then I would like to ask, is buying breakfast and buying a membership different? It was previously said that breakfast was 99 for two people, but there was no language to remind members about it! No matter what kind of membership I become, I must have the right to know! This kind of word game actually appears in an old five-star hotel. This is the first time I have seen it!

To be honest, the room may not be 15 square meters, and it feels not as big as a fast hotel. Secondly, the room smells of cigarette smoke, but It was already 12 o'clock at night when we checked in, so there was no need to bother changing rooms. When I checked out the next day, I asked for a parking coupon, and the front desk also wrote it. However, no one took the parking coupon when I left the parking lot. I had to pay by scanning the code, which cost another 60 yuan. Whether a hotel's service is professional or not does not depend on whether all employees wear uniforms, but whether it can ensure uniform service standards.

msg:I don’t know if I haven’t stayed there. The Novotel hotel I stayed in this time is a cooperation with Huazhu. I don’t know if it is directly managed by the Accor Group. My stay experience this time was a bit disappointing.
1. On the day of check-in, it rained heavily. However, the heavy rain did not come suddenly. It had been raining for almost a day. The hotel I chose was located in a pedestrian street community near the Bell Tower. Cars were not allowed to enter. It took about 30 kilometers from the drop-off point to the hotel. There is a distance of about 30 meters without any obstruction in the middle. This means that the guests have to get out of the car, carry their luggage and walk quickly into the hotel in the rain. I have many years of business travel. I am not being pretentious, but I do not represent all guests. , if the guests are elderly, children or people with limited mobility, will the hotel treat them in the same way? So I suggested on the spot whether we could proactively contact the guests to confirm the approximate check-in time and go downstairs to pick them up in advance, but to no avail?
2. Entering the room, I encountered an unknown abnormal noise. After inspection, it was found that some parts of the air conditioner were loose due to aging and could not be repaired. However, fortunately, it did not affect sleep. It is recommended to repair it as soon as possible to avoid further complaints from people with poor sleep.
3. I apologized for the complimentary fruit in the room, which felt pretty good. However, I found that the fruit in the hall had been updated, but the room was still not cleaned until 15:00 in the afternoon. After coordination, personnel were arranged for emergency trea**ent, but unfortunately, probably due to the rush, the room was not cleaned. I didn't check carefully. It wasn't until I took a shower that I realized that there was no bath towel, which was a bit embarrassing. This is not the service quality that a star hotel should have.
Having said all the above, I am not just complaining, but hoping to remember every guest's sincere feedback to you, and to praise a duty manager with excellent service awareness. Not because of his comfort, he should have changed hotels long ago. Stay here, I will still choose this hotel next time if I have the opportunity. I hope the entire service system will be improved and the entire Novotel brand will be maintained.

However, I didn't change the bedding or replenish the small soap after staying for four days, which is a bit incomprehensible. In the end, I still called the housekeeping center to ask for a small soap... The transportation location of the hotel is very convenient. It takes less than 5 minutes to walk to the clock tower. The Yisu commercial street next to it is still good, and there are many food. The breakfast is very rich, and you can also eat authentic Liangpi Roujia Mozhuang Cake, which is worth recommending. Hope the service details can be improved!

Didn’t I pay after leaving the hotel without a deposit? I was dumbfounded. The room felt very small and depressing as soon as I entered the door. Besides, we lived in an executive double room. The wife is too small, right? Please tell me what is outside the window of Room 505? What should I watch? I won't say what scenery to see, at least don't block my sight, okay? I can't see anything, and the sound insulation is extremely poor. Someone knocked on the door of the next room in the middle of the night, and I heard the voice clearly. I generally don't like reviews. I can't help but want to complain...

I can imagine that I can clearly hear what TV programs are being watched in the next room, how many people live there, what time does his child go to bed, and cry a few times before going to bed at night. Called the front desk, who was very aware of the soundproofing issue. Originally booked for 2 days, I asked Ctrip overnight to refund for a day. I will never live here again

It was less than 12 o'clock when I arrived at the hotel, and the room had not been poured out. The lobby manager arranged it immediately, followed up continuously, and gave me a free upgrade to a superior double room. What a surprise! And the hotel provides free afternoon tea from 3:00 to 5:00 pm every day! Robot food delivery children like it very much😘 The waiters are very caring and enthusiastic!

In addition to two bottles of free bottled water every day, you can also get them for free, which is really powerful in hot weather.

The hotel window is an inner window, there is no scenery to see, but it does not affect it, because if you want to see the scenery, you just need to go out to see it.

The staff on the first floor worked hard and felt like they were on duty 24 hours a day and stood up to greet us almost every time we entered and exited. The front desk staff were also very warm and thoughtful. One night we went out and came back late and wanted to do laundry. But I don't know where the laundry room is. I didn't expect that the lady at the front desk was still there and told the location and usage of the laundry room. She was very careful. The room was clean and hygienic. There were welcome fruits and breakfast. It was really delicious. ! As a result, I still want to go to Xi'an after returning home😭 I want to live there! 😭 Crazy highly recommended! ! ! !

The first time I was on the Jinji Lake in Suzhou. The hotel booked by my girlfriend gave me the first impression of this hotel. The decoration is stylish, clean and tidy, and the service is attentive, not at all inferior to the old five-star hotel.
The second unit trip, in Fujian, was still excellent.
This was the third time. The first time I took the initiative to book, I was entangled between Hilton and this one. In the end, this one won. 1. The geographical position is superior, the transportation is convenient, and the subway station is just outside the door. 2. The price is much lower than Hilton. Because of the perfect impression of this hotel during the previous two stays, I have no scruples and placed an order directly. Excellent all the way.
Special thanks: 1. Ms. Zhang Yan, who helped us line up to buy buns downstairs, also helped us freeze them in the refrigerator in advance, so that we can check them in. 2. One month after the incident, help us make up the invoice & send it to Mr. Wu Jia in Shanghai for free.

When you go to wash and dry your clothes, the mini bar has a cup of black tea and waits comfortably. The hotel has a charming fragrance from the first floor. For visitors who have been outside for a day, it feels comfortable and refreshing after smelling it. Every time I go to the door, I speed up to rush in. Don’t want to be close to the subway, opposite the shopping mall, next to the famous brand, you forgot to bring daily necessities, buy them, Xi'an prices are very affordable. I ordered breakfast, and I booked a day trip myself. You can ask the front desk of the hotel to help you pack your breakfast and walk straight away before you go down. The hotel staff is very responsible and will not turn a blind eye to something for fear of offending guests. Because there are so many children, some parents don't care about the children and let them walk around on the sofa with shoes, but the hall manager will kindly inform them that children are not allowed to walk on the sofa with shoes. Very responsible. The hotel is good in terms of hardware and software. Hope to keep it up. The only drawback is that there is no place for clean clothes in the bathroom, and the only hook on it is easy to get wet. There is also inconvenient parking around the hotel, the chopping board road is very narrow, and roads are being built. At present, sometimes we can hear sounds when we rush to work at night, but it does not matter for us to sleep well. We can only bring earplugs provided by the hotel if we are fragile. In short, I was very satisfied with the hotel this time for 4 days and 5 nights.

The service is generally good, and the water is completely free, and the drinks in the refrigerator are also free.

The most attractive part of the hotel is that it is free of charge. Afternoon tea has fruit drinks, snacks and biscuits, and the 3 kinds of drinks in the small refrigerator are free to drink. Many hotels don’t have this. The mineral water is free to drink. It is very suitable for the elderly with children. My father just had his birthday. After he checked in for me, not only the room number was my father’s birthday, but also an 8-inch mousse cake.

msg:地理位置優越，距鐘樓300米，地鐵鐘樓站H出口即到，出站後可看到酒店，入住在二樓，一樓老先生接待很熱情，前台服務員尚可。但作為國際知名酒店集團Novotel旗下的酒店，硬件與服務意識與國外的水平相差甚遠，1，下午三點入住還沒有房間，需要等近一小時才能入住，2，大堂及房間味道不清新，更沒有國外酒店的香味，房間內味道更污濁，3，酒店幾乎沒有視野好的房間，大部分被遮擋，無景色可言，4，房間內細節欠缺，如吧枱上的鐵架（如圖），不知磕過多少人的頭，5，入住期間趕上裝修，電鑽聲不斷…

msg:房間很好乾凈整潔，衞生也挺好，沒發現什麼問題，但是房間窗户對着街邊，晚上需要關上窗户，酒店還貼心配上耳塞，晚上休息還可以。酒店位置極佳，去哪都方便，可以步行，周圍環境乾淨，類似步行街之類，但也不吵鬧，漢服館很多很方便。
早餐下午茶什麼的都沒有體驗，因為想吃本地小吃，附近餐館，早餐小鋪挺多，去了兩家都挺好。
酒店工作人員服務態度好，前面退房有東西找不到前台工作人員耐心接聽電話幫我尋找，之後杭經理還電聯詢問做回訪，退房孩子還收到了小玩具作為離店禮物，此次出行還算順利圓滿！

另外給個建議，他們家羽絨被太好了，一定把空調打到20度以下才好睡，不然真熱。

 지하철역에 바로 연결되어 있고(걸어서 1분)  종루도 호텔에서 나오면 바로 있고 회족 거리도 길 건너면 바로 있어요. 
 저녁에 나가기 귀찮아서 식사를 배달 시켰더니 로봇이 방까지 가져다 주었어요. 
 방음이 잘 되고 조용해서 잠도 잘 잤어요~^^
 가격도 비싼 편이 아닌데 만족스러운 호텔이었답니다.

提個建議，住酒店的客人可以免費停車，唯一不智能的地方就是每次出去都需要去前台開一張票，到了門口還要給保安，由保安聯繫後台人工開閘放行，如果酒店能直接錄入客人車牌網上操作就好了（當然這個不是酒店的問題，因為停車場不是酒店自己的，建議和停車場溝通一下）

西安之旅訂的行政大床間，房間的窗户太小了，衹能從下面打開，透氣性不是太好，床下的地毯不乾淨，如果不鋪地毯會更衞生一些。
總體來説酒店還是不錯的，之前看點評中説的還沒入住就讓寫評價是不存在。

msg:酒店位置很好，離鐘樓咫尺之遙，又不會因臨街而吵鬧。
因飛機晚班且晚點，酒店會在入住日當晚12點主動打電話詢問情況。
安排812房，白天可以看見鐘樓尖，中間因下面的易俗街區大劇場偶有表演，或許會感覺吵，但白天多外出遊覽，所以影響不大，晚上關上窗還是不影響睡眠的。
房間裝修風格類似於宜家的簡潔模式，面積中規中矩，夠用，也能做到乾濕三分離，當然麪池是開放式的，淋浴房水不外溢很多，智能馬桶加分項。
房間插座夠用。智能照明開關模式簡潔明瞭，唯一改進的地方，就是房間入口處洗手間的智能開關需要更新，按鍵不靈。
房間裏設施齊全，保險箱、小冰箱，並且裏面的軟飲免費，重點是每天補齊而不是首輪。房間裏的免費瓶裝水是巴馬礦泉水，也是可以隨時補充。
每層電梯問有免費水提供。還有免費下午茶，不多但心意滿滿。
一樓迎賓、二樓前台、休息廳，還有八樓服務人員都是熱情洋溢，主動問候，並積極解決住宿客人的要求。包括延遲兩點退房。
希望在旅遊旺季也能保持。

去西安之前看了很多旅遊攻略和住宿推薦，原想預訂更大牌的星級酒店。後來出於出行便利的考慮，從小紅書的眾多住宿攻略中選擇了很多人推薦的鐘樓附近的諾富特，想着先預訂一晚看看酒店情況再決定是否要續住。沒想到最終在諾富特度過了我們整個五天四夜的西安之旅。
酒店位置非常好，在西安著名景點鐘樓附近，而且離地鐵站很近，有二號線，便於去很多其他景點。
酒店的工作人員很棒，以杭星經理為代表的一眾工作人員，包括保潔人員，每一個人都是一直帶着微笑為客人服務，而且響應迅速，非常有耐心。在住宿過程中因為換房發生的一點問題，酒店人員也能及時完美地幫忙處理解決。ps: 前台的小哥哥小姐姐都顏值極高！
酒店的環境，房間，配套也都很好，晚上睡覺很安靜，房間床上用品等乾淨舒適，洗衣房健身房等配套齊全！
慶幸選擇了諾富特，大讚，推薦！！！下次再到西安旅遊，仍然會選擇這裏。

設施：房間有智能馬桶衹能窗簾，電視投屏。網絡又快有穩。有洗衣機烘乾機，免費洗衣液消毒液，很實用

服務：每個工作人員路過都會主動微笑打招呼，需要什麼物品，一個電話很快就送到。每層樓電梯口枱子上都放有礦泉水，隨便拿。退房時贈送了零食和水，下雨酒店還免費送了兩把塑料雨傘。孩子很喜歡這裏，説下次來還想住這家酒店。房型推薦517，視野比其他位置都好，窗户也更大

大堂在二樓，提供免費下午茶，有水果和小餅乾。晚上有醪糟等宵夜。有自助洗衣機和烘衣機。
房間面積中等，衞生OK, 淋浴和馬桶是分開兩間。
晚上電梯門口有免費的瓶裝純悦，自取。
易俗社街區真是寶藏街區, 兩個博物館，一個大劇院，兩家書店。東邦哥非常驚喜，重現80年代社區的各種生活場景，逛累了，有各種本地小吃，太適合消暑。
酒店周邊吃的不少，柳巷麪，五一飯店的包子，羊血粉絲，肉夾饃，同盛祥的羊肉泡饃，餄烙，鍋貼。還有好幾家看上去不錯的餐廳

大廳櫃檯一般，只有周蕾小姐非常好，熱心的幫助我續住三天並提供優惠價格。

最差的是旅館是禁煙的旅館，但無法管制吸煙的客人。好幾個人在房裡聊天抽煙又開了房門，整個樓道間都是煙味並侵入我們的房間裡。和櫃檯反應，居然是要幫我們換房間，而不是去阻止抽煙的客人。房間隔音很差。洗手間新頴但有霉味，不夠通風。￼

我們下次不會再訂西安諾富特。

酒店的服務也是秉承五星品質，前台在二樓，酒店特意安排專人協助入住，接待我們的王先生特別熱心周到。前台人員也是專業有素，介紹各種服務訊息，還貼心的告知有迎賓飲料。酒店的等待區非常舒適寬敞，還有下午茶和夜宵等，方便隨時放鬆休息。房間有電動窗簾，智能沖洗馬桶蓋，感受很好！房間衞生很到位，看到服務員對於每一間的整理時間都很長，每天細心的補充各種物品。早餐豐富可口，還有健身房可以鍛鍊，真是超出預期！
最後説下，返程當天下午，酒店還有服務隨訪，正好忘了一個充電線在房間，被幸運找到，感謝前台的小王特意幫我快速寄回，解決燃眉之急！總之酒店的體驗非常好，一次愉快的旅遊經歷！

msg:大床房的房間有點小，到店之前前台主動打電話問了到店時間，結果到店辦理入住等了比較長的時間，説是房間還在打掃，既然打掃不出來還有必要問到店時間嗎？另外，我定的是2晚，結果第二日早上發現房卡居然打不開門了，還沒到退房時間，為什麼會出現這種情況？這兩點體驗不是很好

去看兵馬俑，門口易俗劇院就能坐直通車過去秦始皇陵兵馬俑。
去陝西省歷史博物館，打車過去二十塊，或者地鐵五六站就到了。
去碑林，打個車十塊左右就到了。
要去回民街，走過去就行了，吃完飯溜達回來也就十幾二十分鐘。
樓下就是商業中心，下樓就能溜達去鐘樓，晚上出入走走非常愜意。
總之就是位置非常好！
服務就是諾富特的水平，挺好的，工作人員都很熱情，每天打掃衞生也很乾凈，還給了延遲退房。
來西安住這裏就沒錯了。

房間是要求打掃後才定期打掃，不過地墊好像不是每天更換還有點濕。

地理位置很好，出行方便，門口就是吃飯的。
房間稍微有點小無窗，想換雙床房後來也沒聯繫就算了。

酒店前台很熱情，打掃衞生阿姨也盡職盡責，但依然難改大堂小和設施少的缺點，如果把它作為休閑度假估計會失望，但旅遊絕對是方便。

沒有家庭房，帶小朋友的衹能擠一擠，估計因為如此，每天都得在微信上聯繫管家送額外的洗漱用品，好玩的是機器人來送東西，在電梯裏遇到還會説不好意思，正在工作中，請給它讓個地方。

msg:選擇鐘樓諾富特酒店實在是明智選擇。入佳當天，孩子在上一家酒店落下了安撫巾（沒有安撫巾完全
睡不着），因為我們趕着去景點，於是叫了閃送，前廳部經理杭星女士幫我跟進快遞進展，收到後第一時間告知我，還貼心的把安撫巾收好。讓我很感動。
設施：酒店設施很新，床很舒服，每個房問有兩個
軟枕頭和兩個硬枕頭。
衞生：環境乾淨整潔，保潔員打掃非常認真
環境：二樓有公用洗衣機和烘千機，對於大夏天出門的家庭非常友好。洗衣液、柔軟劑、消毒液一應俱全。
服務：所有的服務人員態度友善，服務熱情周到，前台小哥哥還贈送了早餐給我家孩子。
地理位置：門口100米處就是地鐵站，酒店在易俗
社區，好多美食。出門去景點也很方便。
希望給其他想到去西安的小似伴一個上佳的選擇。

酒店設施很新，衞生很好，服務到位，礦泉水可以在同樓層自取，水吧裏的飲料免費暢飲。快遞有機器人送到房間口，特別人性化。
退房後就有客服人員電話徵求意見。
非常愉快的住宿體驗，五星好評，會向親友推薦諾富特酒店鐘樓店的。

msg:我認為這個酒店在西安屬於寶藏酒店了，因為西安酒店實在太多，僅僅鐘鼓樓附近就有幾十家知名連鎖品牌，且品質都還不錯，實在容易讓人挑花眼，之所以推薦這一家，三個原因吧，一是鬧中取靜，幾分鐘就可以逛遍鐘鼓樓、回民街、古城牆這些個熱門景點，而且還不影響休息，二是停車方便，這周邊的酒店停車普遍不好，這個酒店有個易俗社街區超大超乾淨的停車場配套，而且跟一眾西安的中華老字號在一起，不用跑腿，就可以品嚐到同盛祥、白雲章、西安五一飯店、西安飯莊等眾多知名的西安小吃和菜餚，三是房間很好，不僅大，而且乾淨，幾乎接近國際五星標準。下次還會來住。
