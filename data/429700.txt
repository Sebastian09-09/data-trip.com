msg:This is the best hotel I have ever stayed with. We have travelled through many countries and visited quite a few 5-star hotels in the world. The Sheraton gold beach really lives up to its reputation and way more comfortable than all other top hotels. The room is large and clean. The staff are all professional. We have received warm welcome and thoughtful service through our stay. It happened to be my birthday on the second day of our stay. The staff prepared a nice cake and fruit basket for us. Berry Yuan was the first person who sent me birthday wishes the day of birthday. What a surprise! I really felt I was home. The location is incredible. We cannot believe that we can enjoy an ocean view from our home. If you would like to have a walk, the hotel is right on the beach. What you need to do is just stepping out of the backyard. Breakfast buffet is gorgeous with great varieties. They serve freshly brewed coffee which is not common in China. I will definitely choose this hotel for my next trip to Yantai.

It was clean enough, however I believe a change on the bathroom’s corners material would be good to get rid of moisture. One towel had a hair which it was good. Besides of that it was very good stayed, good location and great view. Breakfast was good, and hotel prepares a package for you in case you are leave to early to take breakfast. The concierge service always more than helpful.

It’s not that close to the popular attractions, DiDi rides are usually an hour or just over an hour to get to the places. 
We had no problems with anything.

msg:The hotel is located right on the beach. Very beautiful. Hotel is a bit dated. Rooms were nice but older furniture and carpets. There was only one electricity plug next to bed and it didn’t work. 

When we checked in and went to the room, the room keys wouldn’t work, so we had to go back down to the front desk, and they just assigned us to the room next door. The worst part was that the room was extremely warm, 28 Celsius! I called the front desk and they sent a maintenance worker to “look” at it. But the AC was broken. Instead of putting us in a different room with a working AC, the hotel brought a swamp cooler to our room. The swamp cooler was extremely loud, but it did cool the room down for the night. But the next day, the room was hot and we checked out early because we simply were not enjoying ourselves. 

We also wanted to order room service, but the hotel didn’t have the items in the menu available that we wanted :(. I ordered a hamburger, but it was gross. 

There are many nice hotels to stay at in Yantai. The Sheraton used to be one of them…

msg:We brought our children to Yantai for fun. This time we chose the Sheraton Golden Beach located in the development zone. The experience was very good. We booked two rooms, a large bed with sea view and a twin bed. The front desk manager Cindy had a warm and thoughtful service attitude. Seeing that we brought two children, she upgraded us to a family suite for free. The room was very large and very tidy. It was equipped with a footstool, a toilet stool, a bed fence, a tent and building blocks. At the same time, two small snacks and two sets of sand digging tools were given as souvenirs. The children were very happy, which increased the warmth of the stay. The hotel's location is not far from the Seaside Park and the lonely whale, a popular check-in spot. We rented family bicycles and it was very convenient to go there. There are always surprises when you go to the beach in the afternoon. You can go directly to the beach from the restaurant on the first floor of the hotel. This is very suitable for families with children. In short, the whole family is very satisfied this time. Thumbs up 👍

Resort-style hotel, there is a walking trail between the hotel and the sea. You can see the sea in the hotel lobby. It is very convenient to go to the beach from the back of the hotel. There are many people rushing to the sea at low tide in the morning and evening. It is very interesting to watch for a while~
Booked a full sea view room for two days, and upgraded to a full sea view family suite on the second day. The view is very good, but the facilities are a little old. You can consider renovating~

The interior decoration of the hotel is slightly old, and the sanitary details are well done. The room is spacious and bright, with complete facilities and comfortable beds, so that I can enjoy a good sleep every night. Especially the design of the bathroom makes me feel like I am in a luxurious SPA center, enjoying the ultimate comfort and relaxation.
The service of the hotel is first-class, and the staff C is warm and thoughtful. Whether it is the front desk reception or the room service, I feel the warmth of home. They always greet me with a smile and provide me with thoughtful help and suggestions to make my trip smoother.
The restaurant of the hotel is a bit average, and the service and food are not as good as the front desk, but overall, this hotel is still very outstanding and a highlight of my trip. I strongly recommend this hotel to all friends who come here, and I believe you will leave good memories like me!

msg:I was originally hesitating between Marriott and Sheraton. After all, Sheraton's facilities looked old. But when I saw online that it had a garden with direct access to the beach, which saved me the trouble of traveling, I liked it more. But I was hesitant because there was no terrace. My husband was smoking and seemed to be going downstairs. In the end, I gave priority to the convenience of the children. I was not disappointed by choosing Sheraton. There was a surprise. Mr. D, who checked in at the hotel, told us that we could upgrade to a full sea view suite. As soon as we entered the door, wow, the view of the room was great. Whether it was the front or the side, the bedroom or the living room, it was really a full sea view. I felt that I didn't need to go to the beach. It was also a pleasure to face the sea in the room. I happened to watch the sunset, and the visual effect was amazing. There was also free afternoon tea, a cake and a drink. Mr. D also gave the children a lot of snacks and Laiyang pear juice, which was a great harvest.
The hotel is very friendly to children and provides fences, children's toothbrushes and slippers.
The overall facilities of the hotel are very good. The smart toilet is from TOTO, which is very easy to use.
There were a lot of people in the hotel. I was a little nervous when having breakfast. Many dishes were gone in seconds. As soon as I stood up, someone would come to ask if I had finished eating. It seems that most people have started to travel early. After breakfast, I took the children with a small bucket, sand shovel and kite and went directly from the garden to the beach. It was super convenient. It was like a private sea area. There were few people and the scenery was great. The children played for 2 hours without moving. There was no need to go to other places. The family can also ride. The road is very good. You can ride along the coast to enjoy the scenery. You don’t have to go to scenic spots or crowded Internet celebrity spots. Enjoy a wonderful holiday. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Yantai

Seeing that the children were traveling together, he also gave me the Sheraton Pink Dolphin. I am very grateful for Berry's thoughtful care. During the stay, the hotel called every day to ask if I was satisfied with the stay. The breakfast was very rich and met the needs of people of different ages. The sea view and food were both available. The beach of the hotel was still so beautiful, with clean beaches, clear waters, the scenery of the sea and sky, and the charming sunset. The breeze blew away all the troubles brought by work, and the little crabs brought a children's day experience full of childlike fun. Thank you Sheraton Hotel for giving me a perfect holiday experience!

In addition, there are many restaurants and a large supermarket within 3 kilometers of the hotel, providing guests with convenient dining and shopping options.
Secondly, the hotel's service is very thoughtful. The front desk staff C is very friendly and enthusiastic, providing us with a fast and accurate check-in service. The room attendant is also very professional, the room is very clean, and the sheets and towels are very clean and comfortable. In addition, the food provided by the hotel's restaurant is also very commendable, especially the breakfast, which is rich in variety and delicious.
In addition, the hotel is well-equipped. The room is fully equipped with facilities, including free WiFi, LCD TV, etc., providing guests with a comfortable accommodation environment. The hotel is also equipped with facilities such as a gym and a swimming pool, which are convenient for guests to exercise and relax.
In general, I am very satisfied with the experience of this hotel. Whether it is hardware facilities, services or location, it is impressive. I will not hesitate to recommend this hotel to my friends, and I will choose this hotel again for accommodation.

The bath water is very hot, the bed is very comfortable, and the breakfast is also good. I was given snacks when I checked in, and the service staff added me on WeChat, so I can communicate with her directly if I need anything.

Because the hotel is not very new, I was worried at first, but I saw that the sea view is invincible on the Internet and decided to give it a try. I didn't expect it to be full of surprises. First of all, the room is really cleaned very, very clean~^_^ The room is cleaned in a timely manner. The room design is also that kind of simple and bright style. The room feels really spacious. Then the service staff are very enthusiastic and proactive. They will say hello when they see it. My heart is warm, haha. The most touching thing is that there is a special lady following up our entire check-in process. From the beginning of check-in, it is a thoughtful! Meticulous! And very beautiful~ I am very willing to give a full score! How to say it, Sheraton makes me love Yantai even more. I hope to have the opportunity to come and see the sea here often and relax~😝If my relatives and friends come to Yantai, I will recommend Sheraton first!

I looked at the reviews of Marriott and Sheraton and compared them. Sheraton really won the praise for service. I thought the prices were similar, so I went back and forth to experience it. After arriving at the store, I was really amazed by the service at the front desk. C was sincere, patient and considerate. Because the children I brought asked a lot of questions, he was not impatient at all. He also took the initiative to introduce what I needed and served me with a smile throughout the whole process. It was completely beyond my expectations.
The style of the room is a bit like a Sheraton in Sanya. It is a little older and does not have the intelligent facilities of those new hotels. It depends on the person. The wallpaper, table and TV are very old. The room is very clean and tidy, and the dead corners are well done. The only shortcoming is that the room always emits some smell from time to time. After feedback, the front desk actively handled it and sent a small gift to express apology. It was obviously not their problem. At that time, their sincere attitude made us feel that all these could be smoothed out.
It is difficult to comment on the breakfast. There are few categories, the fruits are not very fresh, and there is no freshly squeezed juice. The service is very different from the front desk. I feel that they are not from the same company. It is very strange.
Thanks again to C for taking care of us during this trip. It's really good to go during off-peak hours. We will come back in a few days.

Because we arrived in the evening, Miss W at the front desk of the hotel directly changed it to two breakfasts for us. It was very considerate. She also upgraded us to a sea view room. Thank you very much. I had a lot of fun with my boyfriend. The lady answered my questions quickly because it was not the peak tourist season. The price was also very affordable. A very satisfying accommodation experience. Very happy

You can walk directly to the beach in 5 minutes after walking out of the hotel gate. The beach is silver sand, seagulls are flying, and you can pick up beautiful shells on the beach. It is very comfortable for family travel. I will definitely choose here again if I have the opportunity. My most satisfying hotel trip. I would also like to sincerely thank Xiao Xin at the front desk for her dedication. I am particularly satisfied with her service. She is warm and meticulous ❤️, thoughtful and warm, which makes people feel very comfortable! I look forward to coming to Sheraton again next time and enjoying Xiao Xin's warm service again! ! !

You have to stand in front of the TV 📺 to adjust it. At first, I thought the remote control was out of power. I found the waiter twice and he said that it was the same because the TV was old, so I had to give up. Other places are OK, especially the public areas. It can be seen that the hotel is trying its best to maintain the facilities and equipment. Hygiene: Clean and hygienic. Environment: The whole hotel is on the seaside, and the whole design is W-shaped, so all rooms should be able to see the sea. My room has a clear view of the sea at a 45-degree angle. Service: The front desk, restaurant, and room attendants are all very friendly 👍🏻, must be praised. Price: I bought a 498 package group purchase on Ctrip in advance. The check-in is from the 9th to the 16th, a total of 7 days. I can watch the video on the night of check-in. I saw a website push me a price of 398, and I saw it again the next day. I was speechless... The hotel's revenue management seems to be not very good. I feel that I paid too much.

msg:A great stay!
I am usually picky and don't like carpets in hotel corridors because there will inevitably be deep or shallow stains that make me frown. But the carpets in the corridors of the Sheraton Hotel are exceptionally clean, and the viewing windows set up every few meters in the corridor make people feel happy and relaxed. Although my room is at the end of the corridor, it is not boring to walk. The room and bathroom are spacious and clean, and there are no sanitary dead corners. I didn't use the bathtub, and the shower was hot as soon as it was turned on, and there was no need to wait for the cold water in the pipe to drain.
In the morning, when you open the curtains, you can see the endless sea view, especially the wide coastal walking and cycling path downstairs, which makes people eager to try.
There are rich Chinese and Western breakfasts. What satisfies me most is that the breakfast room faces the garden. The beautiful scenery and breakfast are so relaxing.
There is also a heated swimming pool on the first floor. You can bring your children here during the summer vacation. 😊H

The old five-star hotel is still trustworthy! Overall it's good, with a little episode! The hotel wardrobe scratched the baby's finger! The waiter brought Band-Aids and iodine, and it is recommended to use iodine in small doses or once! It's best not to mix them! The manager on duty came to see and asked at night! The manager called the next day and apologized! After returning home, he gave the baby a small gift! I hope the hotel pays attention to the details of the house, after all, there are many people who bring children to stay! Safety is the most important‼ ️ Overall satisfaction

msg:F is a hotel that I will choose again and recommend to my relatives and friends when I come to Yantai! 
Very reliable, the environment and service are beyond words, and the Sheraton brand is guaranteed. What is worthy of praise is the thoughtful help, warm service of the staff and the beauty of the Golden Sand Beach. I haven't commented on a hotel for a long time, but I must strongly recommend this one! 

Service: The staff at the front desk were very enthusiastic when I checked in. I thought that was the end of it at first, but I didn't expect to get help from this Jingjing for the next three days; first, I sent dried apples and Laiyang pear juice, which were both delicious. I ordered them directly for my family. The dried apples were clean and crispy, and my family liked them very much! Later, I bought cherries 🍒, which were big, sweet and fresh! Then after checking out, I found that my clothes were left in the room. I contacted Jingjing in the evening and she responded quickly and sent them back to Shanghai for free! I sent a red envelope to thank her but she didn't accept it~ 

Environment: The beauty of the Golden Sand Beach can be reached directly from the first floor. I have been to many scenic spots in Yantai, and I think the section behind the Sheraton Hotel is the most beautiful and less crowded. It is a great experience. Turn left to Tianma Pier, and turn right to Wuya Coffee and Lonely Whale. . .

By the way, the buffet is highly recommended, with a very high cost-effectiveness and solid ingredients. Compared with the surrounding oysters at 20 yuan each and grilled squids at 30 yuan per string, it is quite conscientious.

It's also nice to walk along the beach. Dinner is included. The taste is average. Some cooked food is cold. I like grape juice. There are only sashimi and durian pancakes. We almost don't eat them. We left one ticket for each and put it back. If it is limited, it would be better to have more choices.

msg:I decided to drive to Yantai on May Day. I booked the Sheraton Yantai Golden Beach Hotel on Ctrip two days in advance and left a message in advance for the check-in requirements: "quiet and good view".
It took 10 hours to drive on May Day. It was already past 18:00 when I arrived at the hotel. The beautiful W who received me was gentle and enthusiastic. She took the initiative to upgrade us to a premium sea view twin room and gave the children breakfast coupons and two afternoon tea exchange coupons. Seeing that I brought two children, I gave them two dolls, and the children were very happy.
When I came to the room, the room was located in the desired inner part, and the sea was outside the window. The Sheraton Yantai Golden Beach Hotel has a superior geographical location, close to the 10,000-meter golden beach and the beautiful coastline. For travel like this on holidays, in order to avoid the crowds on the beach, you must choose a better hotel with fewer people and more facilities, so that the children can have more fun.
There are also friends who want to come to the lonely whale to check in. It is very convenient to stay here. It takes only 5 minutes by car. You can get up early to check in and eat directly to avoid crowds. It is very convenient.

msg:This is not only the first time to stay here. Taking advantage of the Easter holiday in Hong Kong, I went home to see the elderly and stayed at the Sheraton Hotel in Golden Beach. It has a beautiful environment and a beautiful coastline. You can watch the sea and the sunset🌄. The special food is delicious. Chinese, Western, Japanese and Korean food are rich and delicious. The boy is also free. Upgrade to a family suite. Full sea view. A very unforgettable stay. I give the hotel a thumbs up and will come back to take a sea bath in the summer!

msg:We set off at eight o'clock on the first day of the new year and drove nearly 700 kilometers for eight hours in a dusty way. It was already three o'clock in the afternoon when we arrived at the hotel. The little sisters and brothers in the hotel were very enthusiastic and completed the check-in procedure quickly. It was great as soon as we entered the room. The feeling is that the room is spacious and comfortable, facing the sea, and has all the facilities. It is worthy of being a five-star hotel. The tiramisu cake 🍰 for afternoon tea is delicious 😋, and the coffee juice 🍹 is also delicious. The hotel is isolated from Yantai landmark buildings The whale was very close. After having afternoon tea, we went to the seaside downstairs of the hotel. The sea was vast and far-reaching, and the sea and sky were the same color. Then we came to the lonely whale to check in, and then went to Chaoyang Street Pedestrian Street for a stroll. It was very lively. The next day we checked in at the moon Bay, East Fort, Dongshan Zhanqiao, Haichang Fisherman's Wharf. I came back in the evening and went for a swim in the hotel swimming pool. It was very comfortable. The hotel breakfast was rich and delicious. Then I went to Yangma Island to see the scenery of Yantai. Beautiful, the people in Yantai are simple and warm, and the Sheraton Golden Beach Hotel is high-end and grand. My trip to Yantai left a beautiful and deep impression on me. It is worth recommending to everyone!

The children were very excited and went to dig in the sand behind the hotel after checking in. The room was clean and everything was complete. Bring a breakfast. The front desk helped us arrange free breakfast for two adults and children. They also gave each child a small gift. Dried apples are delicious and children like to eat them. The service is really good! The breakfast is also very rich. I will choose it again next time.

You can see the clean sea as far as the eye can see. The beach is right when you go out. There are few people and the sand is clean. It is also very comfortable at night. Quiet, you can hear the sound of the waves. The only regret is that the hotel is being upgraded and the swimming pool and gym are out of service. But it doesn’t matter. I just stayed for one night and it was not enough. It is suitable for bringing children.

The hotel lobby is transparent. It's bright, and the front desk service is enthusiastic and patient. They specially arranged non-smoking rooms and rooms with good views. They were upgraded for free, which made this short vacation even better. Although the facilities in the room have a sense of age, they are clean and tidy. It turned out to be very attentive. The breakfast was rich in variety and tasted very good. The specially gifted afternoon tea tiramisu cake and latte were also commendable. Due to the sudden cooling and snowstorm, the dinner at the hotel was heart-warming and delicious. It was well worth it. OK, I look forward to coming to Sheraton next time to experience the sea view in summer!

The room is clean and tidy, with an entire floor-to-ceiling window facing the sea, giving a great view. Very suitable for travel and vacation. The Big Dipper is very clear at night. The service is also very good. I will choose this restaurant next time I come to Yantai.

msg:I often come to Yantai for business trips and have stayed in many double beds. However, the Sheraton Hotel still gave me a big surprise. The location of the hotel cannot be said. It is a prime location on the Golden Beach, almost zero distance from the sea. I sat at the desk in the room and watched the tide rise. When the tide goes down and the clouds roll in, it’s so relaxing! In addition to high-standard hardware, the five-star hotel also has attentive and attentive staff. Sookie at the front desk is very proactive and enthusiastic in helping, which is particularly heartwarming. In addition, the hotel also has more than 20 special charging stations for trams, which is really convenient for self-driving trams! I’ll choose it next time I get the chance!

The room he stayed in was a 180° full sea view room. The room was quite large and had floor-to-ceiling windows. Facing the Yantai Golden Beach, the view is very good. There is a large bathtub next to the floor-to-ceiling window in the bathroom. It's a pity that I didn't try the feeling of taking a bath while looking at the beach. The staff is very enthusiastic and will call to ask if you need help ~ very attentive and thoughtful. There is also a convenient medicine box. Steve gave us breakfast. The breakfast was complete.

Because the hardware is too poor, which caused trouble during the stay, they kept apologizing. The hotel's hardware facilities are too poor and there are no extra rooms. The socket, if you want to charge it, you have to unplug the phone, desk lamp, alarm clock, etc. The socket for the hair dryer is even more hidden. It is under the basin cabinet. I called the front desk to find it. The attitude of the room attendant was not satisfactory, and the slippers in the room were of substandard and broken quality. It's a hole, I suggest the hotel renovate as soon as possible, such facilities are not worth the price!

The hotel is also very close to the Lonely Whale and can be reached on foot. There is also a children's playground next to it with all the facilities. My baby had a great time playing! The hotel is also very close to Tianma Zhanqiao. It can be said that the location is in the middle. You can see the scenery if you go east or west. The beach outside the hotel is very soft and clean. It is great to catch crabs with your children.

After reading online reviews, I chose the Yantai Golden Beach Sheraton Resort, which is the most recognized. It is said that service is the highlight of this hotel. In the afternoon after booking the room, I received a call from the hotel asking about the arrival time and special requirements. When I arrived at the store, there were many people at the front desk. There was a duty manager named Vic in English who was maintaining order and guiding me to check in. Although there was a wait in the whole process, it did not disgust me. The boys and girls at the front desk were very good-looking and polite. Professional and warm, the hotel has such a front desk team that is even more powerful! After arriving at the room, the curtains were opened and the surprise came, facing the sea directly, refreshing. After dinner, I went for a walk on the beach. It leads directly from the western restaurant to the beach. The location is perfect and there is no need to cross the road. There is no safety risk with children. During the period, I received a call back from the hotel staff to ask about my stay. It was quite considerate and made me understand why the service is so good. It is the highlight of this hotel and lives up to its name! Finally, I would like to thank the staff represented by Vic for providing services that are above the industry level and meet the needs. I will not hesitate to choose Sheraton Golden Beach Hotel when I come to Yantai again.

You can also rent double or triple bicycles to ride along the coast. It is very close to Tianma Pier and the Lonely Whale. What I especially praise is the service. Before arriving, the hotel called to ask how many children there were, boys or girls, and prepared snacks and beach toys in advance. After arriving at the hotel, I went out to eat with friends and returned to the room around nine o'clock. Arvin, the guest service center manager, specially sent beach toys to the room.

msg:Check in on the 13th, let's say yes first
The view from the room is good. You can see the sea directly opposite. It’s really enjoyable to sit on a deck chair and watch the sea. The service is not bad, and the sound insulation is not bad, but there is loud noise from the corridor, which can be heard in the room
The following summarizes the bad
Personal habits no matter how well they live, they will clean up first
The washbasin in the bathroom should be used every day, and washing clothes cannot be avoided. This looks like an old injury! ! It took two square towels to wipe it clean!
On the day of check-in, I asked the master for the air conditioner. The temperature inside the house showed 23 degrees, but it felt like 32 degrees. I was sweating all the time.
(It always feels like there is a master switch behind them because I set the room temperature to 20 degrees, but it won’t stop and will follow their internal settings, and even if I turn off the air conditioner, there will still be wind coming out of the air conditioner, but it’s just a little bit smaller) If you fix it, it will be better than if you don’t fix it. Even if the temperature is 24 degrees in the house, it will still be kept at 19 degrees for you! As a result, the child who checked in on the 13th and the 14th had a fever! Originally only booked on the 13th-15th, I had to continue to stay! All future plans are in vain, Weihai is considered impossible to go, all kinds of cancellations! From the 15th to the 17th, all hotel stays!
I forgot what day it was. The bathroom was blown out and the bathroom was full of dirty water. I asked two masters to come. They took two dredgers and went out to pick up tools halfway. If there are guests, can you not wear a shoe cover when you enter the room? Just step on the big dirty shoes in the house. Although your carpets are not clean, at least the guests look comfortable. Living in a hotel outside this room is equivalent to my home! !
Finally, let's talk about food and beverage
The first breakfast was intercepted and said that children would be charged for meals. I said that when I checked in, the brother at the front desk said that breakfast was free for those under the age of 12. The front desk of the restaurant said that we are based on height. If he exceeds 150, he will be charged! During the stalemate, a person in a suit came over and said, let's check with the front desk again!
Buffet dinner Roast whole lamb It feels like the lamb is always roasted, oysters are always waiting, all abalones are baby abalones! Salmon is one serving per person. The amount in the picture is for three people. To be honest, it’s too little. You say you can give all the abalones, crabs, and razor clams. You have a limited amount of salmon, and it’s not that expensive. Mackerel dumplings taste good, but they’re a bit salty, and they’re also limited. One per person. The price is 218 for a person who is over 150 tall and counts as an adult.
Checked out on the 18th for the last breakfast and had a "big red envelope". There was a surprise in the poached egg. The restaurant manager said that he didn't know what it was like a fruit core. Anyway, his teeth were bleeding at that time. The manager sent two cans to express his apology. biscuit!
The swimming pool is not owned by the hotel. It is outsourced. The place is not too big and there are swimming classes. If you want to play, you must wear a swimming cap early or late. If you want to buy it, it costs 5 yuan outside and the inside of the swimming cap is 48, and it is still for children! If you have a big head, you can't fit it! But the waiter said that as long as you wear it, my understanding is that as long as there are some things, it will be fine!
The hotel robot is very fun, but it also has times when it is not at home. If it is not at home, even if the takeaway boy asks the staff, the staff may not necessarily arrange for the robot to deliver it to you. The takeaway can only wait for you silently at the luggage storage! !
There is no porter to help with the luggage when you check in, and there is no porter to help you get in the car when you check out! But I found out that people order dishes from people!
How to put it, the worst Sheraton check-in experience ever! none of them! Sincerely not as good as the ordinary economy!
By the way, the drinks in the refrigerator are not free!

You can see the vast sea from the bed in the room, which is worth at least half of the price! ! The front desk service attitude is very good. A breakfast was also given. The seafood buffet in the evening is good, at least for people like me who don't like spicy food. There are also seafood such as oysters, conches, shrimps, scallops, etc. If you are not afraid of spicy food, there are also crayfish, etc. The servers at the buffet are very friendly and hospitable. For me, more than a hundred dollars is not expensive. At least it’s better than when I spent more than 200 yuan at a tourist attraction in Shandong a few days ago and didn’t even know what I ate! Compared to the hotel I stayed in in Qingdao two days ago, it was also a seaside hotel, not one facing the sea. It’s only a hundred yuan difference, but everything is a huge difference! They actually want to catch takeaways there! This is the first time since my travel experience! The hospitality of the people here is very good. Shandong is really hospitable!

It is very convenient if you are going to play at the beach. It is worth mentioning that the service is quite good, especially the buffet dinner is cheap and cost-effective!

msg:During this rare holiday, I came to Shandong Peninsula from Beijing and rented a car to travel around the peninsula by car. The first stop was the Yantai Sheraton. It is particularly worth mentioning that the lady who checked me in, Jessica, called me one day in advance to confirm the order, and also thoughtfully informed me of transportation and other precautions. After checking in, I upgraded the room. As shown in Figure 8, the view of the sea and sky is really good👍
Overall, the location of the hotel is very good. There is a big beach right outside the door. Unfortunately, there are no beach facilities. The main disadvantage is that the hotel facilities are relatively aging, after all, it has been there for many years. The sound insulation of the door is average.
By the way, the hotel layout is similar to a horizontal W shape, so remember to check the location of the room after checking in.
all in all. It’s a good hotel and worth coming back!

The customer service manager contacted me the day before and asked me what I needed. I said I wanted a room where I could see the sunrise while lying on the bed, but it was actually arranged. Here, I would like to thank Arvin, the manager of the customer service center, for his careful arrangements. My husband and I have been suffering from gastroenteritis for the past two days. After learning about the situation, Arvin prepared millet porridge and fruit for our dinner and delivered it to the room. He also thoughtfully prepared a thermometer🌡️, Once again, I would like to express my gratitude. I was very moved to experience this kind of care in hotels in other cities. I will definitely stay at the Sheraton Hotel next time I travel! Thanks to the staff of the Sheraton Hotel, especially Arvin, the guest service center manager!

It was very comfortable to stay in the hotel. On the day I checked in, the guest service center manager Arvin contacted me and asked me how my stay was. So, I went out that day and didn’t have much experience. Later, he added WeChat to let me contact him if I needed anything. There were some minor flaws, but Arvin, the guest service center manager, helped me solve them in time. I asked where to buy things nearby, and the handsome guy was also able to do it. You responded to me patiently and promptly. I think this kind of work attitude is really worthy of praise. Because the flight time was late and I asked about late check-out, the handsome guy also helped me contact the leader for processing as soon as possible. Thank you very much. I also want to say that the front desk when I checked in The lady gave me a bag of snacks and drinks. Although it was not worth much, it made the customer feel very comfortable. Of course, the lady at the front desk had a very good attitude when checking out. The overall hotel environment, staff, and breakfast were all very good. When I left, I sent a message to the manager Arvin to tell him that I had a great experience. Unexpectedly, he came out to see me off and specially gave me a bottle of red wine. Anyway, I was so touched by this friendship and kindness, so I had to give it a try. Give it a thumbs up and hope Arvin’s work goes well and gets better and better in the future. I will definitely stay here again if I have the opportunity to come to Yantai.

On the first day we arrived, we went directly to the Negative One buffet dinner. The roasted whole lamb attracted the children. The grilled scallops and grilled oysters need to wait a little longer. The salmon is limited to one person. The problem of the seaside climate is that there is a small fruit area when the meal is about to close. flying insects. 238/person, which is quite satisfactory. The other restaurants in the hotel also look good. You can order takeaway, and there are many delicious food nearby.
There are a wide variety of breakfast items. The noodles and matching meat sauce in the noodle area are very delicious. On the second day, there is chicken popcorn in the dim sum area. The children like to eat two plates. The whole wheat slices and European buns are delicious 👍The highlight of this accident It is this buffet breakfast that can be packaged. It will be very friendly to friends who wake up naturally on vacation, and directly provide disposable coffee cups.
The concierge department of the hotel has bicycle rentals for many people. It is very comfortable to ride by the beach in the evening. There are book bars and water bars on the greenway.
The beach linked to the hotel will have a lot of fishy smell and a lot of sea**** (I don’t know if it’s due to the season), and you can go to a suitable area nearby. Although many people go into the water, I personally think it’s not suitable for children to swim and surf in the sea. It is not recommended to take children here to dig sand and soak in sea water.
The service and hardware of the overall five-star hotel are all available. The swimming pool is small and only suitable for children to play. The check-in point in the hotel is very beautiful for taking pictures. You can check the warm tips at the hotel front desk.

The location is excellent, the hotel environment is excellent, the key point is that the service is really good, I gave a lot of detailed introductions on the phone two days in advance, and I checked in on the day of arrival with a small gift, which made my baby happy to sweep away the white eyes from thousands of miles[ Laughing] The location of the arranged room is perfect, you can enjoy a full sunrise while lying on the bed 🌅 What kind of experience is it for a baby who grew up in the city full of tall buildings? [Laughing] Especially Arvin, the manager of the guest service center, provided timely and thoughtful service and gifts such as various fruit drinks [Happy] It’s super nice at the beginning of the journey, must be praised ~ strongly recommended ~

msg:I have stayed at many Sheratons across the country, and the Sheraton Yantai Golden Beach has received unanimous praise from the whole family. I still want to stay for a few more days.

First of all, the location of the hotel is very friendly to families on seaside vacation. The hotel restaurant is just outside the beach, and the sand is very fine. It is especially suitable for waking up at 5 o'clock in the morning to watch the sunrise, taking photos and sending them to Moments, and you can go back to sleep

The hotel buffet dinner is also good, outdoor barbecue + beer, standard for summer vacation

The most important thing is that the hotel's service is also impressive. When I checked in, I met Jessica, who was considerate at the front desk. She not only introduced the hotel restaurant, swimming pool and other times in detail, but also applied for Sheraton membership👍

Berry, the younger brother at the front desk, is handsome and kind, with a warm smile. I am especially grateful to him for upgrading the room for us. He also gave the children sand digging tools, welcome drinks and snacks. During the stay, we actively added our WeChat. We will respond to any needs as soon as possible. The service is meticulous and considerate. When checking out, I also prepared cute dolls for the children, and the children were so happy that they didn't want to leave🤓🤗. It is recommended that the boss add chicken legs to such an excellent employee😊😊😊 The room with a full sea view is really beautiful, and the feeling of facing the sea is really very open. For our children who grew up in inland cities, it is so cool. Sitting by the window watching the sunrise and sunset, and the waves rolled up by the sea breeze, the mood is healed. I think this is the true meaning of travel! Finally, I would like to praise the hotel, the hardware facilities are very good, every detail is in place, the bedding is clean and comfortable, I will still choose this hotel when I come to Yantai in the future!

Before going to Yantai, I had been tangled and hesitant among the three hotels, Sheraton, Marriott and Hilton, and finally decided on the Sheraton. Not only was I not disappointed, but I was disappointed. Very pleasantly surprised~ After we drove to the hotel, there was a concierge at the door who was responsible for helping with luggage. After arriving at the front desk, because it was a weekend, there were many people checking in and had to queue up. As a result, I just stood in the crowd for a short time, and the receptionist at the front desk was called Cindy The young lady saw me and immediately took me to the other side to check me in alone. The young lady was professional, patient and polite. Originally, we had booked two rooms with a premium sea view double bed and a double bed, so I told the young lady about me. When the needs of the two rooms are close to each other for convenience, the young lady did not hesitate to upgrade a suite, which can be connected with another room. It is really touching. Seeing that we also brought a big treasure, The young lady offered Dabao's breakfast after she took the initiative to ask, and also asked the room service to remove the smoke smell and anti-slip trea**ent for the room. The details are perfect 💯, because the room was not cleaned when I checked in. For this reason, Miss Cindy has been following up We said sorry, but I felt a little embarrassed. Generally speaking, the check-in a**osphere was very relaxed and comfortable, and it made me feel special and meticulous care during pregnancy~ I am very moved, like it👍
Let’s talk about the room. The hotel is very close to the beach. You can walk through the back garden of the hotel to the beach. The sand on the beach is very fine, and there are not many people. You can catch the sea at low tide. After coming from the beach, there is also a hotel’s exclusive foot bathing area. The sea view of the room is very good, you can see the sea when you open the window, the bedding is white and flawless, the room is clean and hygienic, the room service is responsive, and the delivery is very timely. When I checked out, it happened that Ms. Cindy helped to handle it and delivered it Our refrigerator stickers have brought this trip to a successful conclusion. Thank you very much. The Sheraton in Yantai gave me the biggest surprise. The experience is amazing. I will choose Sheraton next time I come to Yantai. I look forward to the next time. Check-in experience!

msg:Traveling to Yantai is a very happy journey! The service of the hotel is very good. When we arrive at the gate, the concierge will help us open the door and pick up our luggage. They will also introduce us to the best location near the hotel to see the sea. The front desk of the hotel is very professional, and the check-in peak period is also swift. We will introduce everything that needs to be introduced. The facilities are also well maintained. The hotel has a first-line sea view. You can go directly to the beach from the hotel. After playing in the water, you can wash your feet in the footbath in the hotel garden. It is especially convenient if you take your baby there. You can also grill and eat in the garden at night. Basically, it’s a staycation, a one-stop shop ~ Ivy is great and very enthusiastic. Along the way, he introduced many places in Yantai to take pictures and check in, and he is also very professional. The hotel is very close to the Tianma Trestle Bridge. You can go there for a walk in the evening. The sunset is beautiful! We booked the basic room, next time we will try the sea view suite!

The feedback from my friends who did not book the wrong one is very good! From the moment you enter the door, the lobby is very airy. The security guard will actively open the door, and the concierge will help you with your luggage. When you walk to the front desk, a lady named Cindy is in charge of reception. She is professional, patient and polite, and makes the entire check-in process easier. The a**osphere is very relaxed and comfortable, and I sent my friends to the elevator. The sea view of the room is very good, you can see the beautiful coastline, the bedding is white and flawless, the room is clean and hygienic, the sister in charge of the guest room named Summer is very nice, she responds to all requests, and the delivery is very timely. Next time there is a reception, I will put it in the Sheraton, thank you Their care and concern for their friends.

In particular, I would like to thank the beautiful sister, Manager Su, for her kindness and meticulous service. On the day of check-in, she sent us a welcome gift 🎁 and sent us to the guest room in person, and offered to upgrade us to the executive lounge for dinner. When we learned that our return flight was an evening flight, we gave us We were treated to a late checkout until 4pm. When we checked out, we were sent off in the lobby. Bit by bit, too many to enumerate...

msg:The service of the hotel is super 👍, the front desk is responsive, and the check-out is also very fast. The waiter in the restaurant took away the empty plates very quickly. What impressed me was that I was eating alone. When I went to get the food, the waiter would not take away the empty plate, and asked you to leave it to occupy the seat. The waiter would take it away after you sat down after taking the food. Empty plates are great. When I ate alone at the Hangzhou State Guesthouse, the waiter took away the tableware and I had to find a new seat. Sheraton Golden Beach has done a good job in restaurant service.
The room is also very comfortable. Although it is a bit old, the service is a plus. The beach at the back door is also very convenient. Next time I come to Yantai, I will still choose this Sheraton.

msg:The hotel belongs to the development zone. The advantage is that it is close to the airport. It is quiet and suitable for holidays with children. The disadvantage is that it is far from the city center. The attractions are basically near the high-speed rail station. The room is sunny, with a wide view and a good sea view, but the privacy is not very good. Basically, You need to draw the curtains all day long and turn on the lights at night, so you can see clearly. The bed in the room is very comfortable, the TV adopts a projection method, and the bathroom is separated from wet and dry. This is the basis for this price. Ms. Jessica greeted Check in and sent a welcome Snacks, U1S1 Yantai’s apples and cherries are delicious, and Laizhou’s pear juice, I felt the hospitable Shandong people’s enthusiasm when I checked out. I also sent a refrigerator magnet from Yantai High-speed Railway Station to make up for the regret of not taking the high-speed rail. Generally speaking, I am very satisfied with the location of the resort hotel. The room was upgraded to the executive floor, but it was too far away from the elevator. I was a little scared to go back to the room at night. When I turned the corner, a running man suddenly appeared and shocked me! 🥹The breakfast buffet is very rich, there are no seats during the peak period, the hotel occupancy rate is quite high, and many BusinessMans also have family trips. After all, it is a Marriott brand. The hygiene of the restaurant needs to be strengthened. The chairs are a bit afraid to sit in shorts, but I am very satisfied with the attitude of the service staff. Compared with other hotel staff, it seems a bit socially intimidating. If you pass by the hotel face to face, at least Smile to indicate it. I have stayed in a very right hotel. This is not satisfactory. I see that the hotel still pays attention to the guest's experience in the hotel, and the service awareness needs to be improved.

The room rate during the Dragon Boat Festival is also acceptable, and the check-in is very fast. The gift is very considerate. The children wanted to go to the seaside and play on the beach. They went to Yangma Island, but there was nothing there. The seaside view from the back door of the hotel is better, and you can go to the beach to play with the sand, and the sunset is also beautiful.
        Because of the early train the next day, the room was not booked for the buffet breakfast. I was afraid that it would be too late. Later, I found out that the meal will open at 6:30. I asked the receptionist if they could add breakfast for two people. I was very surprised and gave breakfast for two people. It was really great, thank you for being so good The reception and the hotel make you feel at home.

msg:🏖️I have always wanted to enjoy the sea breeze and step on the beach in a less popular place, because some friends are here, so I decided to explore Yantai

🏨I chose several sea view hotels, and finally chose Sheraton's full sea view room, which seems to be the one closest to the beach. I hadn’t arrived at the hotel that night, but I received a call from Manager Wang, whom I met later, saying that I could upgrade the room for free. I originally booked a high-floor full sea view, and said that I could change it to a terrace villa, but the floor was on the second floor. In the end, I decided to give it a try and see what kind of room was upgraded. I didn’t expect it to be really powerful.

🏠Thanks also to Tina at the front desk for her warm reception and a young lady who took us through the lobby to the villa area. You can really feel the sincerity of the manager when you enter the room, and staying here is worthwhile. The size of the room is not really important to me, but the location is amazing. There is a small balcony on the second floor, and a terrace courtyard on the first floor, you can go out directly, and the beach is only 100 meters away

🌅The beach is very clean, better than those on Yangma Island and Yanda, and the most important thing is that there are very few people. It should be hotel guests in twos and threes, and there are also a few tents. All in all, it is very comfortable. Looking back at the hotel, there is a feeling of quiet amidst the noise, which is great

🍷Breakfast lasted until 9:30, but it may be the reason of the resort hotel. Breakfast lasts until 10:00, and some special foods will be marked with their own characteristics. There are also more than a dozen dining tables outside, we just eat outside, sea breeze, music, beach, food, this breakfast is unforgettable

🛣️ Finally, I would like to make a conclusion. Compared with hotels with similar prices in other cities, the environment, service and level are quite satisfactory. If you want to get close to the beach, stay away from the crowd, and enjoy the slow time lazily, I sincerely recommend everyone to experience it for a few days

An unexpected experience, Berry's thoughtfulness and meticulousness made us feel very warm from the check-in. I booked a children's room and got cute plush toys. When Berry found out that my baby was a boy, he was afraid that children would not like plush toys, so he gave me a small water gun! ! ! Who would understand this kind of meticulous and caring~ I added WeChat later, and it was very considerate to post a nearby place to eat~ I must add chicken legs to Berry to increase my salary. That kind of warmth is just right! !
Besides, the hotel environment, although a bit old, is very comfortable to live in. The cleaning is timely. The most important thing is that the beach is just across a small park, which is really suitable for walking children. Here, children can not only dig sand, but also catch crabs in the sea, fish under the bridge, watch seagulls and the super beautiful sunset! ! ! Bringing a baby is amazing! !
By the way, the hotel's western restaurant is also good, the breakfast is adequate, and the dinner buffet is very cost-effective. And the young lady in the western restaurant saw that the child offered a lollipop as a gift~ It was the feeling of being treated gently! !
In contrast, Chinese restaurants and health facilities have no services at all, so they are outsourced! ! Anyway, the flaws are not hidden, and I look forward to coming back next time! ! Thank you again, little brother Berry, I wish you a happy work~

But because the location of the hotel is so good, I will consider staying here next time I travel.

In June last year, the cause of the epidemic was that I couldn’t stay in Beijing anymore. Later, during the Dragon Boat Festival, I discovered the friendship of Yantai. During the epidemic period, we also received very good service. In June of this year, I brought my wife and children here again. I liked the front desk staff berry. I checked in early and gave my son a duckling doll. I stayed for 3 nights. The hotel is very soundproof, and I didn't hear the storm outside. To put it simply, this is the most habitable hotel among the 500 yuan five-star hotels in Yantai.

The hotel is very close to the airport, you can get there in 30 minutes by taxi after getting off the plane~✈️
As an old five-star hotel, although it has been open for a long time, the facilities are very complete. The concierge staff will take the initiative to help open the door and take the suitcase~ The reception of the lady at the front desk (special compliment to Manager Cindy) is warm, professional and warm, and they even gave away gifts A set of sand digging tools for children 🛠️
The floor-to-ceiling windows of the room can see the entire blue coast. The hotel has a back door that leads directly to the beach. It is a paradise for children. The sea is very blue and the beach is very clean. Morning jogs and evening walks on the promenade are great. There is an open-air barbecue for the buffet dinner. In the evening, you can enjoy the sea breeze and drink some beer on the shore, and feel the feelings of the sea.
We have been thinking about the meaning of travel. In fact, what we want may be simply to go out and have a look, let us take a breath from the busy work, embrace our children, lover and this beautiful world, and then spare no effort Go to the next journey.

I have stayed in many hotels at home and abroad, and I have been in the tourism industry for more than ten years. I am very picky about the hotel. Although I know it is not a new hotel, the facilities will be a little bit old, but it is a five-star hotel after all, and I went to Yantai just to see the sea~ also because it is the only room type with a 180° panoramic sea view suite... The beach is right in front of you without crossing the road! The service of the handsome guy in the front hall, Berry, is really good. When the front desk checked in, he was very patient and left a phone call for me to contact me at any time. I just asked about the nearby restaurants and kept asking my colleagues about the various prices nearby. How far to go and so on the details, size! Including Cindy Xin, the duty manager in the front office, this Shandong girl is real! Help me take a taxi, and go to help prepare children's toys and snacks several times before and after running. The nearby restaurants recommended to me are also very delicious! I am so moved! Although I only stayed for four days, all the feelings in the whole hotel are great. The cleaning lady is very meticulous. Every time I go back to the hotel, the doormen who help to open the door (really, this position does not need to be young people) include The room attendant uncle will always give me a warm smile, and the Shandong uncle will make people feel down-to-earth and warm. This is really perfect. It is not an exaggeration. Sheraton Yantai made me feel the enthusiasm of the Shandong people! good! The children said that Yantai is really nice, and the uncles and aunts in the hotel are super nice! Wait until you can go into the water and check in again in July! ! !

Especially Ms. Jessica's service at the front desk really showed the service level that Sheraton should have, and she upgraded the room for free. I like it. Next time I come to Yantai, I will still choose to stay at the Sheraton.

When checking in, the front desk arranged a room on the seventh floor in Zone 2, facing the beach. At night and in the morning, there are different views. Facing the blue sea and cascading waves, it was an unexpected scene before coming to Yantai. The room is very spacious and bright, the huge bathtub is amazing, the wet and dry separate bathroom design is also very careful, the bedding is clean and comfortable, and the buffet in the morning and evening is also very good. Most importantly, the hotel team is very proactive, meticulous and caring, and will definitely come again.

After checking in, the Sheraton's soft services did not disappoint me. Every need was responded to in a timely manner, including engineering staff to help solve the screen projection problem.

It is particularly worth mentioning that when Berry at the front desk learned that two elderly people in their 70s were staying, he added my WeChat account for the convenience of parents. They also made an exception and added a breakfast, and thoughtfully provided a variety of pillow choices for the elderly, and recommended a local restaurant with good taste for the elderly the next day. Such dedicated and attentive service is impressive.

Finally, I would like to make some suggestions for the hotel's hardware, and hope that the hotel can improve the smell in the bathroom.

Disadvantages: The hotel lobby is too cold, and the door to the beach is still very cold, so it is cold and inconvenient, and it is a big circle to go to the beach. The front desk of the hotel bought a 20 yuan shovel to dig sand. When I came back, I put the mineral water bottle with sand and gravel in a plastic belt. It should be thrown away when I cleaned up the room on the second day of my consecutive stay. I didn’t find my shovel and shells when I got home. .

Personally, I think it's enough to prepare more of this kind of thing. After all, you can only bring children to live in this type of family suite. Only one set will inevitably make people feel less sincere. The children in the room like to go up and down the tatami, but the disadvantage of the tatami floor is that it is not easy to clean.

Disadvantage: I woke up in the middle of the night, and I called the customer service in the morning, and the response said that the central air conditioner was turned off because some guests felt cold!
When the guests are cold, they can turn off the air conditioner in their rooms, or provide them with quilts. It is not necessary to close all the rooms for everyone. The two families woke up in the middle of the night, and the professional service ability needs to be strengthened;
Overall OK, 4.5 points, the photos are believed to help the hotel to attract more business;

Check-in on August 6th has been an unpleasant experience but I still choose to believe in Sheraton, but the check-in on the 13th disappointed me again. The room 6016 smelled very musty as soon as I entered it. The air conditioner didn't work at all. The hygiene of the room was worrying. The facilities made me speechless. Only the hotel here let me down on the trip. If I come here again in the future I won't be staying here anyway.

The hotel rents bicycles, and rents rowing boats in the nearby Liushang water sports, and paddle boards are very convenient.
The hotel's facilities are old, but the service, food, and basic rules are in line with 5-star standards. The food and beverages are outstanding, barbecue buffet, Japanese food, and Chinese restaurants are all good.
What needs to be improved is that the breakfast place seems to be a little small, and the summer is a bit hectic; all the bath products are not easy to foam, hahaha

msg:I have stayed here once before, so this time, although I struggled between Marriott and Sheraton, I chose Sheraton in the end, probably because of my familiarity. I didn’t plan to go to the scenic spots this time, I just wanted to stay in a hotel for a few days to take the children to the sea. The biggest advantage of this hotel is that there is a beach downstairs. You can go back to the hotel to get things at any time during the play, which is in line with our requirements, and It is equivalent to the hotel's private beach, with few people and very fine sand. When the tide is low, you can pick up a lot of interesting things, and the children have a great time.
The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is expensive and generally not recommended. Since we have breakfast, we went to catch the sea after breakfast. When we came back for lunch at about 1 o'clock, we ordered the hotel's meal and delivered it to the room. The takeaway is also very convenient and fast. The hotel swimming pool is also available. It has a depth suitable for children to play. During the day when the tide is high, we go to the swimming pool to play. In the afternoon, we went to the surrounding Changyu Winery to play with the sand at the beach at night.
There is no need to worry about the rainy days and cloudy days. We have reported moderate rains and heavy rains every day when we traveled for the past few days. I am also very worried, but it is not so heavy during the day. It is still very good to wear a raincoat or an umbrella in light rain. And on cloudy days, there is no sun, no heat, and no glare, which is unexpected.
Because the hotel does not have late check-out due to the peak check-in period, you have to leave at 12 o'clock. Everyone should pay attention to this. Amy liu, the waiter in the cafeteria downstairs, is very nice, enthusiastic and meticulous in answering questions. Thank you.

2. There are too many guests for breakfast and should be diverted. The executive lounge is only open in the afternoon, which is inconvenient for members.
3. The facilities are outdated, there are bugs in the room and they are bitten.
4. The service is very good. The front desk assists in changing rooms, maintaining the hotel's consistent service level.
5. Hotel parking is free, suitable for self-driving. I went to inspect the Marriott next door, and I feel that the facilities are very new. I will try it next time.

I never expected that this time I would encounter a counterfeit hotel and an agency hotel. The word honorable, the price is almost twice as expensive, and no refund is given. I thought that I would arrange a good room. The actual arrangement was average. I had to complain when I was angry. After several setbacks, the hotel's service attitude was very good, so I changed it to a better room.

msg:To be honest, this is an old hotel with outdated facilities, the carpet is not clean, and the lobby is very large. If the weather is good, you can choose this to watch the sea. For those who like luxury hotels, don't expect too much. Toiletries are probably the standard for an express hotel. The variety of breakfast is average, but it is not up to the five-star standard. When I checked in, it was one thousand and four. It's summer vacation these days, so it's understandable that the price is high. Originally it was a low floor, maybe there were many people staying that day, so I changed it to the top floor of the seventh floor. The hallway was stuffy and hot. I think the only good thing is that the attitude of the staff is really good, praise.

msg:In early August, I brought the elderly and children to stay for a few days. The overall feeling is still very good. The elderly are very satisfied and the children are very happy.
The hotel's environment is superb, the lobby is bright and spacious, and it crushes Xinguang Wanhao, the next-door neighbor who claims to be the most beautiful lobby in Yantai. Going out the back door is the beach, with a long coast, wide shoals, and clean sea water. You can also catch a lot of small crabs and flounders with your bare hands. Occasionally, you can catch bigger and more crabs. Every day, you will stay in the hotel and wait for the low tide to catch the sea. The holiday is very satisfying.
Besides the room, compared with the Marriott that I have stayed in before, because it is a low-rise flower design, most of the sea view rooms have an oblique view of the sea, there is no sea view directly facing the sea, and there is no balcony if the balcony is included in the room, but this is There are pros and cons to each design issue. The room is spacious and the facilities are relatively new. The large bathroom with dry and wet separation is more suitable for people who come back from the beach. I would also like to praise the hotel's 2-meter bed, two large and one small are completely stress-free.
For dinner, I have experienced Chinese restaurants and Western restaurants. The Chinese restaurant tastes good, but the price is expensive. A common choy sum is 68 yuan, and seafood lump soup is 18 yuan for a small bowl. The buffet in the western restaurant is ok, the characteristic Penglai noodles, the overall variety is not rich enough, the dinner is 210+, there is no buffet lunch on weekdays, and the weekend buffet lunch is 168. I still feel that it is too expensive, haha, maybe I am poor, this is a five-star hotel after all . The room delivery was surprisingly good, the pizza and pasta were a surprise, the dumplings were also good, the downside was that the fruit plate was not very fresh. There are eel rice and roast beef rice in the delivery menu, which looks very tempting. The children are clamoring for it, and they have not even ordered for three days.
Others are, the mineral water is generous, you can add 4 bottles at a time, the service staff is very hard and very enthusiastic, once I forgot the room card, a young lady ran all the way to open the door, exhausted and out of breath Yes, I feel very embarrassed. The disadvantage is that the room service phone is often unanswered, or it takes a long time to answer, which may be due to too many guests in the summer.
I didn't go to the swimming pool, the children said it was good, and the children's playground was a bit small.
The business was very good in the summer vacation, so there was no late check-out. The day I left was the evening train, and I was told that it was not possible to continue the hourly room for two or three hours, so I had to let the baby in the restaurant while eating the buffet. Take a nap for a while.
The above is the objective experience of staying for a few days. I hope to provide some reference for the little brothers and sisters who want to come. Overall, it is worth recommending.
In addition, this Sheraton has a fan group, you can enter or not, it is useless, I asked the customer service Taozi two questions, and one of them didn't answer me.

msg:The second time I came to Yantai, I booked the Sheraton directly without thinking about it. It is still as good as ever, because the geographical conditions are relatively superior, accommodation, watching the sea, and parent-child travel are highly recommended. When you get off the bus, there will be a master at the door to help with luggage. From the front desk to the cleaning and then to the restaurant staff, everyone is very enthusiastic, kind, and answers patiently and meticulously. Any problems will be solved in time, especially Ella tao, the cleaning staff on the sixth floor, who is very nice, warm, friendly and easy-going, and will remind us to find her if we need to. This time I took my children and family on a vacation. Because I have been here before, I still ordered the family package with full sea view. The experience is very good. I asked the hotel if there will be dolls for children as souvenirs. It should be that the hotel does not have such a service, but the lady at the front desk tried to bring two for the children, and the children liked it very much. It is very meaningful to suggest that hotels send children souvenirs with the Sheraton logo in this family or parent-child suite room. Also, the bath water in the room will flow out, which may be due to the design of the floor drain, and I hope to improve it.

So we didn't swim there.

From the pros:

We really liked the pool, the water is warm.
Good soundproofing in the room, we were not disturbed by the noise from the street or the neighbors.
The rooms are clean, the smell is fresh and pleasant.
Beautiful area of the hotel. Very well maintained garden.
The room has large beds, it is convenient to travel with a child.

Of the minuses:
The showers in the pool are dirty.
From being on the same floor with a Japanese restaurant, the locker room smells terrible. (Like in a Japanese restaurant).
Shampoo and shower gel bottles are so small that they are not enough for one day.

We won't go there for the second time.

msg:1. The location is very good, the seaside, and also has a large beach, the first choice for family vacations
2, the room and facilities are perfect, nothing to say
3. The swimming pool has always been a shortcoming of Sheraton, and this time is no exception. The pool water smells of disinfectant. During the three hours from 4 to 7 p.m., no lifeguards or any staff were seen, and there were children swimming sideways, disturbing them. No one cares about other bathers, so I suggest learning from a certain Grila.
4. The service in the lobby is a bit sorry for the five-star service. This must be complained. There is no luggage guy outside the lobby. There is only one person checking the health code at the entrance of the lobby. Don't care. There is no manager in the lobby to help greet guests. When I went there, there were not many customers, and when I checked in, I was in line behind other customers. As a result, other counters did not greet me after completing the formalities. Later, I couldn't wait and asked, only to find out that all the counters were closed. You can check in. The counter staff didn't have honorifics, not just one person, not more than once. I said hello to the other party and thanked them, but they didn't respond. Not to mention other five-star hotels, not even ordinary express chains. The only thing that makes me happy is that the little brother of the room service has a good service attitude and is very professional.

Even during the epidemic period, guests can also provide guests with disposable wet wipes... the next day. I had a buffet dinner at the hotel next door. I was just as disappointed. There were too few things. On the contrary, although the sanitation here is poor, there are more things than there. Also, the bed is too soft and not very friendly to children. The feeling of sinking as soon as I lie down, especially on the side of the bed, I suspect that the spring is broken, and the air conditioner is old and loud, but the thickness of the quilt is appropriate, and the smooth fabric is more comfortable.

msg:The first time I came to Yantai, it was a bit beyond expectations. The whole city was bright, clean and tidy. The Sheraton stayed at this time was also very satisfied. The service is much better than many luxury five-stars. The hotel is very close to the beach and the scenery is beautiful. Miss He at the front desk asked carefully about the check-in requirements and arranged a suitable room. My family and I are very satisfied. Thank you so much 🙏! The staff, Chang Ruirui and Tina, have a very good service attitude. Whatever is needed, we will arrange and solve them immediately. Will come to Yantai again and choose Sheraton again!

msg:The sea view of the double room with full sea view is very good, and because the windows cannot be opened, the room is very quiet. The sea is on the first floor of the hotel. It is very comfortable to take a walk at night in this season. The hotel facilities are not new, but the sanitation is very good, clean and tidy. The aunt who came to clean the room on the day we didn’t go out cleaned the room very quickly and thoughtfully replaced the bath towels and even added bath salt and coffee. Later I was very pleasantly surprised when I saw it. I don't know how the aunt can finish so many things so quickly. Because we couldn't get up in the morning, we didn't have breakfast at the hotel. We went to a Japanese restaurant. Dianping has a set menu for two people. The taste is great, the ingredients are fresh, and the price/performance ratio is very high.

msg:The room is super big and the bed is comfortable. Although it is not a room with full sea view, the view is OK... There is one thing that is not good. I booked 3 rooms, and they were all on different floors. Even the rooms on the same floor are far apart! Every time I find someone, I have to walk a long way (/ω＼) Go downstairs and walk to the beach from the restaurant. When the tide is low, there will be locals there to catch shells. The overall environment is good. If you go out to take a taxi and call Didi, there will be people to take orders at any time. There is a shopping mall not far from the hotel, where you can have a simple breakfast or something! It is the best hotel for the Yantai trip, because the beach is super loved by children! The swimming pool opens at 6:30 in the morning. I go there every day. The children must swim until closing and are reluctant to leave... There is a sauna and a small hot spring bath in the dressing area... But I didn’t have the opportunity to experience it... I recommend staying here! It is also worth mentioning that the child fell when we checked in. It should be the lobby manager. Every time we meet, he will ask if the child is better! Great! Finally, I would like to say that I would go to the beach for a walk at around 4 o'clock every day. The sea breeze is very comfortable and cool... I just forgot to take a picture of the room. Toothbrushes and toothpaste are provided, and the toothpaste is from Shuke! There is a bathtub and a shower in the room, with dry and wet separations! Anyway, it's very good! People who write bad reviews *** Hahahahahahahaha

The children’s playground is also very small. The hotel has Chinese and Western restaurants where you can order food, and you need to take a taxi to eat nearby. , You can also order takeaway. The hotel may have been taking a long time. I changed rooms three times before I was satisfied. But with children, I just fancy this beach. It is very pleasant to rent a bicycle to blow the sea breeze in the evening.

2. Tina sun at the front desk is friendly and kind, and the service attitude is very good. Thank you.
3. The buffet in the morning is basically okay, not bad or not. It would be great if the chef can wear a mask. There was a chef who was talking and frying eggs. It felt unhygienic.
4. There is a charge for drinks in the refrigerator in the room, why not stick a note outside the refrigerator. It is said that there is a small note under the mineral water bottle on the table. Who can see? Isn't this inducing consumption, a routine? What age are you doing these things? Is it like a big hotel?
5. The old man thinks of Tina sun's face and gives a good comment. In fact, it is not enough.

It is a 1-minute walk from the hotel building to the public beach. There are few people. Crabs are digging in the afternoon and blowing in the evening. With the sea breeze, the food is okay, the folk customs are simple and the experience is good. There is a buffet lunch, a Chinese restaurant, and Japanese food in the hotel. Free heated swimming pool. A good place to take your kids to cool off in summer.

msg:A bad experience:
1. The decoration facilities of the hotel are old. The hotel should have been renovated for many years, so the facilities are very old. The worst thing is that the sockets are very old, causing some chargers to fail to plug in... Finally, fortunately, the socket on the table is empty, otherwise there is no way to plug in the charger.
2. The full sea view room has closed windows! Close the window! It was not marked on Ctrip. I only found out after I checked in. Then, because the windows were closed and the room was not equipped with fresh air, I felt dizzy when I fell asleep. The next night, I could only change to a room with windows.
3. The breakfast is very poor... one is that the variety is small, and the other is that there are a lot of them after nine o'clock, and a fly flew over the dessert... and the wontons are quick-frozen, not freshly packaged....
4. It is far away from the city, it is not convenient to travel, and there are no deck chairs on the beach.
5. The bath salts in both rooms have been unpacked... I don’t know if they have not been checked during cleaning...
6. The Dragon Boat Festival is scheduled to be more than 1,000 nights... In fact, the living experience is very poor.

之前在評論看到説酒店很舊啦，也沒有抱什麼期待，結果進了房間，發現酒店的設施維護的很好，確實有年代感了，但是使用很順手！
酒店後門出去就是一片沙灘，雖然沒有酒店的公共設施，但是自己帶個小墊子，平緩的沙灘看着落日特別的美好！

msg:淡季的喜來登實在太香了，三百多拿下，中午到店就直接給房入住了，沒讓硬等到三點，應該是還給升級了行政房，超棒。大堂的迎賓小哥哥也很熱情主動，招呼我們去前台辦理入住。酒店房間很大，沒感覺裝修舊，就還好吧，可能我要求沒那麼高。酒店前台W小姐姐人很好，全程都很關注我的入住體驗，服務方面沒話説，還贈送了入住零食飲料禮包，挺有心的。下次來煙台還會選擇喜來登，安靜幽雅，離沙灘非常近，也適合帶孩子出遊。

關於服務，大部分工作人員都很不錯，有的對業務感覺不熟悉，該給的不太記得主動提供，折返要才拿到。浴室衞生可以再加強一下。

回訪電話裏的工作人員態度很好，處理問題靠譜。

沙灘海邊真的美，五月多沒什麼遊客下樓暢玩方便。

酒店房型和服務：趕在五一前到酒店，酒店給做了房型升級，前台業務辦理很快。
酒店服務員見到客人都會主動打招呼，門口迎賓人員主動搬行李和開門，自助餐服務很到位，高峯期也會快速在門口加位置，打掃人員及時清理臟的地方，房間雖然有點老但是打掃很乾凈，總的來説服務培訓到位
缺點：客房服務打了兩次都沒有人接 點了一次外賣沒有辦法送到房間，衹能下樓去找，大廳有點空曠感覺中間少了點什麼
總體來説滿意，下次如果度假還會考慮這裏

東塔這邊有泳池，那種特殊的味兒在連廊裏能聞到，不可避免。
早餐中規中矩，和其他的同級都差不多，不會特別出彩，也不會有明顯短板。但所有食物基本都能供應到10點，這點是好評的。
我不是太事兒的人，夠住就成。
床很軟，家裡人不太習慣。桌櫃角都有防撞的保護，但樓梯的玻璃上沒有，這個可以加上。
服務挺好，流程標準都不錯。餐券、錄入車牌免停車費，每一項提醒的都很到位。大寶在房間裏開了一罐7喜也沒算費用，雖然沒多少錢。（其實他不喜歡喝，衹是看到冰箱裏有飲料比較興奮）。
地下車庫一般，進口侷促不説，裏面的地面積塵嚴重（也可能是缺乏維護的掉色，沒深究是否是灰塵）

最終工作人員加了我聯繫方式，我給了付款截圖才得以退回，值得讚揚的是全程沒有聽到一句抱歉。
由於這裏房間價格並不高，所以在之前我並沒有理性的評判過酒店設施住宿體驗，那今天就單純的評價一下著名的煙台喜來登酒店。
首先停車問題：指示牌不夠清晰，地下停車場臟亂差，並且在搬行李過程中，車庫燈熄滅了。
入住時：前台服務態度是可以的，這一點值得表揚，也主動説了由於外面施工所產生的噪音問題，但是並沒有主動提供類似於耳塞這樣避免噪音的用品。

服務：前台和禮賓工作人員都很熱情，把我原先定的房型直接升級成了套房，體驗感很棒。下次和家人一起過來玩還會選擇這裏。

首先，酒店的服務給我留下了深刻的印象。每一位員工C都充滿熱情，對我提出的問題和需求都耐心解答，確保我在酒店的每一刻都感到舒適和滿足。這種熱情周到的服務態度，讓我倍感温馨。
從入住時的前台系統，到房間內的各種設施，再到健身房和游泳池，都展現出酒店的品質和實力。這些先進的設施，大大提升了我在酒店的居住體驗。
房間的設計讓人感到舒適，整潔度也非常高。床鋪柔軟舒適，浴室設施完備且乾淨，每一個角落都透露出酒店的用心和細緻。
性價比方面，我認為這家酒店做得非常出色。與市場上的同類酒店相比，其服務、設施和舒適度都更勝一籌，而價格卻相對合理，這無疑增加了其吸引力。
總的來説，我對這家酒店的印象非常深刻。無論是服務、設施、房間質量，還是地理位置和性價比，都給我留下了非常好的印象。我會毫不猶豫地向朋友和家人推薦這家酒店，並期待自己下次的入住體驗。

msg:因為趕早飛機選擇這個酒店，定了大床房，結果前台説定房部搞錯了，給預留了雙床，後來經理給升級了有大床的套房。告訴前台第二天要趕7點的飛機，需要5:30退房離開，前台説可以準備早餐打包帶走，所以就預訂了早餐並一再囑咐一定要在5:30前準備好，結果第二天前台換人了，沒有任何人知道這件事，我們時間也不夠不能等，就走了。還是管理不到位吧

到店沒有迎賓，沒有禮賓人員。
早餐全靠搶，自己搶座，食物沒了也不補，問了服務員，説食材沒送來。
山東人很熱情，服務員很熱情，但一家五星級酒店不能衹靠熱情啊。
管理基本沒有，服務員都是臨時找來的，態度很好但一問三不知。
我很少評論酒店，因為住過的大部分五星級酒店都服務周到。
這是我最哭笑不得的酒店，工作人員每天熱情地請我給好評，到餐廳讓給好評，離開酒店讓給好評。但酒店的服務能力和服務水平讓我確實不能也不敢給好評

可能是假期最後一天，人不是很多，前台Steve還給升級了房間，非常nice～
之所以喜歡這個酒店是真的很有度假氛圍，周圍很安靜。房間就能看到海，出門就是沙灘，順着海岸可以一直走到“孤獨的鯨”
配套設施也很完善，中餐西餐品質都不錯，很適合休閑親子游，畢竟小朋友都很喜歡海邊挖沙子捉螃蟹

酒店打掃房間的那個圓圓的可愛女生.真的房間打掃的太整潔了.換在沙發上的衣服.她也會跟你疊放的整整齊齊.桌上擺放的東西.也會給你堆放的整整齊齊.入住這幾天.每天都會把房間弄的乾乾淨淨很舒服.
在酒店入住這幾天.也會點外賣.外賣員把餐送到酒店.酒店就會用機器人送上樓.機器人不在時.酒店的工作人員也會給你送上樓.所以不得不説.服務各方面真的不錯.
也給值班的那幾個女生説句謝謝.入住期間很關心.詢問.真的很棒👍
給酒店環境拍了一個視頻.謝謝酒店工作人員用心的服務.祝大家工作順利.開心

房間偏舊，隔音不太好，走廊裏人聲鼎沸；
前台接待小姐姐服務很好，因為是萬豪會員，送了小童早餐；但銜接不太好，因為第二天吃飯早餐廳還讓我買小童早餐，不過解釋了一下就進去了；
早餐到10點，九點到的時候，很多菜都已經空了，感覺很不好，沒遇到哪個早餐廳這麼早就缺菜的；
酒店太大，人非常多，體驗不太好；
在中餐廳吃了一頓飯，吃到一半，小姑娘跑來要好評，就站你旁邊，也不好意思不評，拒絕了多尷尬。但五星級酒店不應該這個水準，你要讓客人發自內心的評價，給了好評，送了我飲料，這個發票就等不到了，第二天連續打了兩次電話，才把發票發過來。
這個好評有點給的太早了呀。客觀的説，中餐廳味道不錯，但定價也是偏高，這幾樣東西就要四百多塊了。

整體上，一進酒店，感覺不到國際連鎖五星酒店的氣派和魅力，沒有五星的感覺。
酒店晚餐自助很豐盛，不過定價偏高，北京金隅喜來登自助餐也就這個價。在煙台，海鮮產品如此豐富的城市，這個價高了些。

前台服務很周到，告訴我附近的景點。
房間很大，很乾凈，側面可以看到海，屋裡很暖和。
因為是買的套餐，所以晚餐可以選自助或者中餐，因為擔心中餐太多吃不完，就選了自助。種類很多，味道不錯，如果燒烤區的大姐態度能好一點就好了，或者可以在窗户上貼上一張票都有什麼，就省的每個人都要問一遍了。
最愛的是出門就是沙灘，人還少，孩子太喜歡了，早晨還有海鷗，下次來還會繼續住這裏。

msg:整體還不錯，美中不知，海邊度假酒店應該考慮到衣服晾曬，都是沙子的泳衣，沒地方晾曬。衞生間裏也沒地方掛。據説是為了不弄濕地毯，但看着很多房間都掛在落地窗户玻璃旁，即弄濕地毯也不美觀，何不設計一個晾曬的方式。設計師欠缺考慮。

服務員工整體都很熱情，要理解新晉旅遊城市，且就那麼幾個月是旺季，很多員工都是短暫打工，專業和能力可能不達星級服務和預期，但大家都很真誠熱情，已經很好了。

另外也很感謝Arvin的服務，添加了微信，有什麼問題都可以直接問她，挺方便。

msg:上次來煙台還是5年前，當時入住的金沙灘喜來登感覺就非常棒，所以這次再來煙台還是首選這裏。
本次在前台接待我們入住的是Jessica，對待入住客人的真誠和細緻體現在工作的點點滴滴，一言一行之中，一定要給她五星好評！
環境：酒店的沙灘雖然不是酒店私屬，但位置是周圍酒店裡最方便從路面高台走下進入沙灘區域的。

衞生：衞生打掃的非常乾淨，特別是房間的地毯清潔的很乾凈。

服務：從前台到大堂到餐廳，服務人員都很熱情細緻，讓人倍感舒適。對於客人來説，一個度假酒店好與不好是整體的入住體驗，這既包括硬件，也包括氛圍，其中人員是營造良好氛圍的最重要的因素之一。

設施：對於提升入住體驗的角度來説，酒店的設施還有提升的空間。一是房間淋浴可以升級改造一下，二是酒店的游泳池比較小，在沙灘天氣不適合遊玩的時候，泳池對於客人的入住體驗就尤為重要。三是酒店户外區域可以考慮更好的開發利用一下，畢竟有這麼好的地理優勢，如果讓客人的體驗在沙灘和酒店户外的區域更好的接續起來，可能對於提高入住體驗會有一個質的提升。

我們連續吃了3天的自助早餐，我覺得餐太一般了，除了麪還可以，其他很寡淡，咖啡機也是壞的，每天打咖啡都能看到服務員在修不同方位的咖啡機，建議餐再提升一個高度吧！

環境：訂的全景海景房，視野比普通房間開闊很多，一邊泡澡一邊看海景真的很愜意，酒店前面就是金沙灘，人特別的少，既方便又舒服。
設施：衞浴間裏我沒找到排風扇的開關，不知道在哪裡。

卫生：終點說下泳池，太髒了    更衣室地上 全是水  差點滑倒，泳池滤网那里已經開始上霉有青苔  ，這個真的很誇張。暑假小朋友很多，更應該西注意安全和衛生，整個泳池一個救生員都沒有，可能外包出去了，不是酒店管理。一進泳館处 那里几个服务员不知道是酒店的还是哪里的？服务非常一般、一直询问泳帽。 告知他们都有。还是不停的问。恨不得开包检查。让人感觉非常不好。
除了游泳館其他服務都不錯。

其次，check in等了一個小時，辦手續的時候説正在打掃，好了打電話給我，結果等了一個多小時沒音訊；
然後，房間設施比較陳舊，空調不好使，調到18度但房間温度一直23度下不去；
第四，當天客服電話還能撥通，第二天客服電話就永遠打不通，旺季來了的確很忙，但是如果連續撥打十幾分鍾，都沒有客房服務接聽電話，我衹能説：沒能力別接這麼多單呀……
第五，我們吃了自助早餐、采悦軒中餐廳、以及客房點餐服務，味道都太一般了……
不過工作人員態度還蠻好的。
總之，入住體驗很差。

另外，酒店後身幾十米就是金沙灘，海水很乾凈，在進入酒店的時候還有沖腳的地方，總之小朋友玩沙子特別方便，在酒店後面的沙灘捉了很多小朋友，小朋友非常滿意。
下次我們還會入住金沙灘喜來登，全家體驗非常不錯，感謝喜來登的Berry經理。

🌳衞生我挑不出毛病，但酒店開業10年，客房維護方面確實還可以提升。硬件已經有點跟不上週圍的其他酒店。浴缸防水，水壓不夠，導致特別慢。健身房器材不太多，游泳池的洗浴環境有待加強。硬件完全比不過隔壁萬豪親兒子…
🌳地理位置挺好的，就在金沙灘，1樓出門就是；

總的來説，我更偏愛一點隔壁的萬豪；但這家喜來登的服務真的讓我感覺難以置信地好。

msg:從2013年我們公司在煙台開發區開設工廠以來，每次來煙台不管是出差還是度假都住喜來登的，不知不覺已10年了。酒店位於金沙灘海邊，窗外就是大海，非常漂亮。雖然設施稍老一些，依然阻止不了我的熱愛。一如既往的服務貼心，這次前台帥哥Berry看我房間沒含早餐，還貼心的幫我做了升級，還耐心的給我講解如何刷卡，儘管我對喜來登已經熟的不能再熟了，但還是感謝Berry的關懷備至，在這個下雪天讓人倍感温暖。下次出差還會一如既往的選擇入住。謝謝！

msg:餐廳很冷，導致吃的飯菜也都比較冷。五星酒店的三文魚自助限量衹能取一次也是少見的。房間配套的拖鞋實也是非常簡樸，不如快捷酒店。
地理位置是最大優勢，夏天海邊度假極好
