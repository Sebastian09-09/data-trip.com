msg:Good location, no beach, but at least with a car easy to go to nice beaches in short time. Otherwise in the middle of lots of restaurants, outlets and entertainment
Cleanliness: Well.... 4-5 stars for the a bit old but well maintained (and for kids lovely decorated) room. 1-2 stars for the restaurant with sticky floor, sticky tables and for 2nd floor lobby toilet max. 1 star.
Main issue and absolutely not Hilton standard: the breakfast. Neither Chinese (my wife is Chinese and tried it) nor western food meet any Hilton standards. No fresh fruit juice, old and dirty coffee machines. 
The staff was very helpful though and tried to soften the obvious issues. Which leds to the conclusion: this hotel seems to have a severe management problem.
I would rather not choose it again. Especially as it was way too expensive. We paid 1700+ RMB per night (2 adults, one kid) including said breakfast.

I found the Hunan restaurant downstairs of the hotel. It is economical and tastes good. The hotel has a rich variety of breakfast. It is recommended to eat breakfast in the hotel. It is more convenient. The indoor heated swimming pool on the first floor is very clear, and the shower room in the gym is also very good. I will choose Hilton next time I come to Zhoushan.

The view of the mountain view room is not inferior to the sea view, and it has a different flavor. Especially at night, the view is better than the dark sea view. The waiters are very friendly and the breakfast is also very rich. Turn left about 400 to 500 meters from the hotel, there are many seafood restaurants and it is very convenient to find food. Although this Hilton has been open for a long time, it is different from other five-star hotels. The details are well designed and maintained. The sheets and bath towels are very clean, and the pillows and mattresses are comfortable. I will still choose Hilton next time!

I wanted to ask the customer service to help me deliver it. The customer service said that they could only deliver medicine, not food. After repeated communication, there was no way. I thought I could only go downstairs to get it myself. When I arrived at the lobby, I heard two waiters say "It's so annoying." They were holding the medicine I ordered and checking the information in their hands. I was very angry. Why did they find it troublesome to help me deliver the medicine? They had no sense of service at all! I was so angry. I instantly felt that the service was really bad! Bad 👎

When the weather is good, the sea view is really beautiful! Personally, I feel that if it weren’t for the convenience of being on the island, it would actually be nice to stay at the Hilton! When I checked in, I chose an executive room on a high floor. The room faced the lake and had a nice view outside the window. It was very quiet! The hotel is quite satisfactory, standard five-star, with complete room facilities and complete supporting facilities! Toiletries and shower heads are great! The breakfast at the hotel is very rich, with a large selection of meals and good food. Because I have to catch the morning flight, I eat breakfast in a hurry! Hope to have a good taste next time! There are many supermarkets near the hotel, but due to time constraints, I didn’t go there! I hope I can have some fun next time! The hotel's executive lounge is very simple. There are not many options for afternoon tea time and happy hour in the evening. However, the view in the executive lounge is really good. It is really pleasant to make a pot of tea in the afternoon and sit by the window and watch the scenery in a daze! I will continue to stay here if I have the opportunity in the future!

I was worried about formaldehyde in the newly opened hotels and the location was average. I was worried about the poor accessories in the B&B. In the end, I decided to choose Hilton.
The hotel upgraded the sea view room, facing the sea, and you can see Putuo Mountain and Zhujiajian directly. It is also very convenient to leave in the morning to the Centipede Wharf, which is a 10-minute drive. After walking around Putuo Mountain, you can sleep again and check out.
The service is very enthusiastic. After checking out, the front desk lady saw the parking ticket in the room card and ran to deliver it to me. It was very considerate.
There are also items that may need to be purchased in Putuo Mountain in the hotel. The price is real, more affordable than Putuo Mountain, and there is no need to squeeze people. It’s great!
I didn’t do my homework in advance, and I had a stomachache when I went out to eat. The surrounding restaurants recommended by the hotel are where they often go for dinner. It’s really delicious and clean, and the seafood is fresh at 9 o’clock in the evening. 2 people ordered 5 dishes and each one was a plate~

msg:The room I booked through Ctrip was on the 18th to 21st floor, but I was given a room on the 7th floor!
At 4:30 in the morning, all the machines were turned on and I was woken up! The front desk said there was no problem and asked the front desk to change the room but they didn't change it. Finally, they asked someone to come into the room to listen to the rumbling sound of the machine, and then they admitted that it was the sound of the machine. The sound insulation of the whole building is really poor. The conversation in the room can be heard clearly in the corridor! I didn't sleep well at all. I had to go to Zhujiajian to catch the boat to the island early the next morning! There were so many people for breakfast, everyone was scrambling. I won't stay at this hotel next time!

msg:The name is a bit untrue. I compared many stores online and chose the one based on good reviews, but I was a little disappointed! The first time I chose Hilton, I felt it was so different from other international hotels!
Advantages: Good location, convenient to go anywhere
Facing the sea view, the scenery is OK
The service concept of the front desk and the guest room is okay. It is originally a plus. However, when there is a problem in the room, it is solved as soon as possible and the return visit the next day is good. However, the fruit you sent is really not as good as not sending it. It is rotten. A lot, not new at all!
Stayed in the hotel for 2 nights and went to the restaurant for breakfast in the morning. There was no normal service such as taking a seat or asking for coffee or tea. It was all self-service. The restaurant was a real deduction. No other international chain store at this price can do this!

Every day I can see the sea and the island opposite. It is also convenient to go to Putuo Mountain to worship Buddha.
The hotel breakfast is OK, and the coffee made by the coffee machine of Kalemei is suitable for my taste. However, the breakfast can add some local flavor, and the score will be higher.

msg:The location of the hotel is great. It faces the Nanhai Guanyin across the sea and is perfect for watching the sunrise. It takes more than 10 minutes to take a taxi to Putuo Mountain Centipede Pier. It's great to get an upgrade to a floor after checking in at the hotel front desk. But compared to five-star hotels of the same level, the service at this Hilton hotel is really average. The employees have no sense of service with a smile. The cleaning lady in the corridor chats and doesn't take the initiative to greet guests when they see them. What's more, they only drink coffee for breakfast. There were obvious lipstick 💄 marks on the cup, so the male manager wearing glasses said in an understatement that it was not cleaned and he could just change it to another cup. As a five-star hotel, this kind of service is really unacceptable.
This is a Hilton that was delayed by service.

Because we had an unpleasant experience staying in a hotel in Zhujiajian, we wanted to find a hotel that we couldn’t go wrong with. A hotel with mature facilities, services, and surrounding facilities. The Hilton obviously met our expectations.
Even during the Spring Festival, it is very convenient to eat here. It is close to the shopping mall and next to the food stalls. There is a delicious vegetarian restaurant nearby. There is an amusement park behind it. The night view of the Ferris wheel is great. It is not far from Putuo Mountain. You can drive to Centipede Zhi by car. The pier is very convenient.

Two suggestions: 1. It is recommended to add non-Tesla and Porsche-specific charging piles to the parking lot. The current configuration is 2 Porsche-specific piles and 7 to 8 Tesla-specific piles. They are basically idle, which is a waste of resources. 2. There were too many people at breakfast. Even if we missed the peak period before 9:30, we still couldn’t find a seat for half a day. Moreover, no hotel staff came to help guide or find seats. The meals were collected on time at 10:30, resulting in Breakfast was eaten in a hurry, which was not a good experience.

We chose to stay in the lake view executive room. Facing the lake view is much busier than the sea view. At night, there are also neon light observation cars and other sights.
The services and hardware meet the standards of a five-star hotel.
In the executive lounge, I went to enjoy afternoon tea in the afternoon, which included mini sandwiches, cookies, and various fruits.
As well as drinks and coffee.
In the evening, we ate at Yuxi Chinese Restaurant on the second floor. The seafood tasted delicious, the price was affordable, and the service was pretty good.
After the meal, go to the Executive Building Lounge to enjoy Happy Hour, which includes red and white wine, spirits, soft drinks, etc.
In the evening, there are also steamed snacks, pizza, durian cakes, fruits, etc., as well as some stir-fry dishes, which are very rich.
 
Very satisfied with this stay.

The room is nothing to say, the old 5-star brand is trustworthy, very comfortable and clean! Rich breakfast.
The service is generally okay. When we went there, there was a bellman who took the initiative to help us take our luggage upstairs. The service staff were also very enthusiastic and would take the initiative to say hello when we met.
The only thing we were not satisfied with was that on the day we left, when the car arrived, my old man and I had to put our luggage in the trunk. The service staff at the door didn't help at all and just looked on coldly. Later, the driver couldn't stand it anymore. , helped move. It still makes people feel very bad.

The shower in the room was installed next to the bathtub, which was strange. The customer service phone said they all had the same design.

Please treat customers sincerely in the future.
The upgrade added 290 yuan, a total of 1350 without breakfast.
Compared with the Wenzhou Fuzhou Xiamen Hilton, your service is not as good. After checking out, there are two children with a pile of luggage🧳 No one asked politely if they wanted to help, not even saying hello and goodbye. You are all uncles, what kind of service industry is the hotel doing today when it is so introverted? I feel untrained! ! !

msg:The sea view room on the executive floor has a reasonable layout and a first-class view. Standing on the balcony, you can see the Putuo Mountain in the distance. You can see the sunrise in the morning. The Daqingshan Scenic Area takes about half an hour by car; the buffet breakfast dishes are relatively rich, and the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are delicious and delicious.
But some details of the hotel are still unsatisfactory.
For example, the supporting swimming pool for external swimming teaching, the water quality is poor due to the large number of people, and there are many floating objects underwater.
Besides the guest rooms, the toiletries should be the worst in five-star hotels, maybe not as good as some high-quality homestays; the comfort of the bedding is poor, the quilt and bed cover are not breathable, very uncomfortable; staying for 4 nights, the room cleaning is rough every day , there is still hair in the bathtub, and the laid quilt is dragged on the floor; the sea view room is facing the barbecue street, and there is noise at night.

msg:The second time I came to Mount Putuo, the first time I lived on the island. Although it is convenient to go to the Buddha, the accommodation is not good. This time I came out with my family, brought the old and the young, and made some general strategies. Finally, I chose Hilton , However, Hilton did not disappoint me. The lady at the front desk upgraded us to a sea view room for free. Needless to say, all aspects of room facilities must be praised! The scenery is also very good, especially standing on the balcony, it is really quite "sea view"!
It is some disposable items such as toothpaste, toothbrush and comb in the hotel. I think the quality can be improved appropriately.
Personally, I think the location of the Hilton Hotel is quite good. Going out from the back door of the hotel is a comprehensive square, with various delicacies and the like. It takes 5 minutes to walk there. Really, it is really good for people with young and old. So friendly. Young people can have a tooth festival, and the elderly will not be afraid of trouble and go far. The next day, we were tired from playing Mount Putuo, so we still chose to eat the hotel’s buffet dinner. The variety of buffet dinner was okay, but the variety of seafood was a bit lacking. However, guests who stay can get a discount!
The hotel's transportation is also okay. It takes 15 minutes to take a taxi to Zhujiajian Wharf in the morning, which is very fast! There are also various food courts nearby. Opposite the hotel is the Shenjiamen food stall. It is a bit noisy when people sing at night. It may be better to live on a higher floor.
Overall, I am really satisfied with this stay, and I can add a lot to this trip in Zhoushan.

This time I chose Hilton because I also wanted to visit the commercial streets outside the island. The surrounding area of ​​the hotel is very lively. And when I checked in, I got a free upgrade to the sea view room. The view is really good, and the layout of the room is also very good. There is a desk, a small sofa, and the bathroom is separated from the wet and dry. The most important thing is that the service staff here are basically very polite, and the car is parked in the hotel There are polite service staff at the door to help with the luggage, and the little brother at the front desk greets us with a smile. Walking in the corridor, the room attendants will greet us politely when they see us. The waiters in the Chinese restaurant are also polite, basically very good, after all No matter how good the room hardware is, it may not be remembered by people. Only when the service is in place can people be impressed. See you next year 😄😄😄

Three suggestions to strengthen:
1. There are too many three-dimensional parking spaces in the underground garage, and there is a serious shortage of large parking spaces. (Most of those traveling by car and staying in hotels are SUVs)
2. The night market across the road sings until 24 o'clock, which affects the rest of the residents. Suggestions and complaints from the government.

There are automatic smart toilets in the house, and I am not used to it. The room is quite big, with two bathrooms and a round bathtub by the window. The key point is, scenery, scenery, scenery! It's great that the floor-to-ceiling windows from the living room to the room face the sea, and it's good to open the floor-to-ceiling windows and go out. Across the road is a street of seafood food stalls. The business is good at night, but I dare not go there for fear of unhygienic conditions. But you can go to Putuo Tiandi Commercial City across the street. There are some restaurants. If you want to eat seafood, you can go to the nearby Kaihong Plaza. It is highly recommended to eat a lot of seafood. There are many seafood restaurants, and the environment in the big shopping mall is also good, or go to the nearby one Haizhongzhou Sea Restaurant, there are some high-end products there, and it is now a fishing ban, and they actually ate live plump red crabs with scallion oil there. The location of the hotel is still very convenient, not far from the commercial street, just across the bridge to Zhujiajian. Opposite the room is Mount Putuo. The swimming pool is small, the breakfast is mediocre, I didn't stay in the hotel for a long time, I didn't have time to go to the Chinese restaurant for dinner, next time. We checked in before 3:00 p.m. and we didn’t have time to clean it. Let’s go to the executive lounge to rest first. The scenery there is very nice, and there are some snacks, fruits and drinks for free. , Express delivery, hotel staff are very enthusiastic.

msg:When looking for a hotel, after reading the bad reviews and not knowing which one to choose, I choose an old brand that still has quality assurance.
The front desk is very nice, and I was upgraded to a sea view room, very satisfied! But there are two suggestions. 1. The rooms at the end of each floor are not suitable for girls. When we felt bad, we found that we were the second room on the side. The first room seemed to be a sanitary reserve room, not a guest room. In the middle of the night, the children felt uncomfortable and wanted to check out and leave🏃. They were uncomfortable and uncomfortable, and they understood everything. It is best to come back to the island the next day.
2. Because the plane was delayed, I called the front desk to ask if I could delay the check-out. The girl said that the check-out could only be delayed until two o'clock at most, and if it was more, I would be charged half a day's room rate. I thank you, but to be honest, the girl's last sentence doesn't work. Maybe when I have a late check-out in other hotels, they always ask me when I want to extend it, instead of telling me to pay half a day's room rate if I have more!
3. The gym is on the first floor, and the air circulation and comfort are poor.
4. Yuxi Restaurant has a very high score, because the early flight to the hotel was very hungry, so I ate at the hotel if I didn’t want to go out to eat. My feelings are as follows
The waiter's service couldn't keep up. After I drank the water, I asked to add some water for me. After filling it for me, I turned around and left. My daughter said that she didn't come so fast and opened her mouth to ask her to add some water too! There were not a few tables of guests, but it felt like they were busy working with their eyes glazed over.
In terms of dishes, we ordered very ordinary dishes, but the price was really high, and the taste was very bland. The fried yellow beef that we wanted to eat had no taste at all! Maybe it's because we are from the north.

msg:The front desk will upgrade to an executive sea view room for free. The hotel is still very good. The room facilities may be a bit simple, but it was obviously designed in those days. After all, it is normal that it is not so advanced since it opened in 2015. The service and supporting facilities of Hilton Zhoushan are all based on the five-star standard, which I think is ok. I also saw many foreigners staying here. Some of the bad reviews in the comments were too exaggerated. I went to the underground garage. There are double-decker parking spaces with a height limit of 1.5 meters. Don’t park large SUVs. There are normal parking spaces inside, no problem. The road at the front of the hotel is relatively narrow, but it suddenly becomes clear when you go around to the back, and there are a few more open-air parking spaces. The front of the hotel is the sea, and the back seems to be a business district, which is more convenient. The seafood food stall at the entrance is gone. We drove to the old town of Shenjiamen to eat, and the Internet celebrity food stall, because the parking spaces in the old city are limited, it depends on luck.

The facilities and services are getting better and better. Before staying at the lake view, this time I wanted to try the sea view. I didn’t expect the little brother at the front desk to upgrade me directly. The huge mirror in the room of the exclusive sea view suite is very suitable for taking pictures. There is a bathtub for washing and double washbasins for parking. It is very convenient to scan the code. It is highly recommended that you must try the sea view room. The opposite is Mount Putuo. The very large balcony and the glass windows on two walls give you a strong sense of taking a bath You can also enjoy the sea view from time to time, and you can see Shenjiamen Street, so you can't bear to leave!

There are many types of breakfast, including both Chinese and Western styles. I ate noodles and some vegetables. The taste is average. You can eat enough. Finally, I think the best is coffee. The freshly ground coffee is very fragrant.

3. The carpet is dirty and full of stains

In response to the smelly smell on the head of the bed that everyone reported, I personally think it is the problem of the pillow. Because I read a lot of reviews before I came, I paid attention to this problem. After checking in, I checked everywhere and found the root cause of the problem. I didn't sleep with a pillow for three days. It is recommended that the hotel change the pillow.

This trip with Putuo Mountain as the destination is also a good choice to stay here as a transit. Shopping and eating are very convenient near the hotel. There is an endless seafood night stall across a road. The price of the hotel is not good for weekend value for money. During the stay, because we have to wait for another wave of friends to meet, we need to stay one more night, maybe it is summer vacation, it is too popular. I could not book the room type I originally booked. I had to change the hotel, and it was very troublesome to move things. In the end, a boy named Tim at the front desk helped me with many coordinations. The original room can be stayed for an extra night. Thank you very much, treat people sincere.

msg:Known as the best hotel in Zhoushan, I really can't agree! As a member, you can get free breakfast and room upgrades, etc. But because the suite I booked cannot be upgraded, I asked for a room with a better view! On the first night, I smelled a stench on the head of the bed intermittently. It was a bit disgusting. It was the stench of F P after eating bad food... I barely slept for a few hours on the first night and couldn't find the source of the stench. Ah... I can't go and buy toilet water and disinfectant spray, it's better after spraying! But you have to spray it every day before going to bed, otherwise you will still have it. Imagine what it would be like to be woken up by smoke! Until I feel tired in the morning, why don't I just ask the breakfast room to eat it. Everyone knows that the average room delivery time will be limited to 40 minutes. My breakfast was delivered from 10 o'clock until almost 12 o'clock. In the middle I also urged twice! (Pictured) Do you think the food of this quality is less than the standard that a five-star hotel should have? I ordered a continental breakfast for 128, a gourmet breakfast for 168, and two plus a 15% service charge. Would you give me these for more than 300? Most importantly, still give me 4 meals I ordered! My cereal, yogurt, milk and soy milk were not given to me, and I felt like I ate a roadside stall in a five-star hotel! The most important thing is that it is really unpalatable. The fruit is also estimated to be the cheapest one. After half a mouthful, it is really tasteless! The executive lounge also does not support the breakfast for suite guests with executive benefits. It is only open in the afternoon and evening…
Continue to complain: There is a small refrigerator in the room... It's hard to say! In such a hot weather, the refrigerator used in the room is almost useless. I bought yogurt and put it in the refrigerator overnight. It's not much better than room temperature. I can't help but want to drink ice. Come to chill the drink and put the ice bucket into the takeaway thermal bag and put it in the refrigerator! My mother, I really can't complain about the five-star hotel's actual maximum four-star standard! Don't think about the smart toilet that a five-star should have, think too much, it doesn't exist! The sink was well washed, a piece of wood fell and almost hit my foot! (Pictured) I clearly pressed Do Not Disturb, I just want to have a good rest... People are probably waiting for a shift after get off work. I will give you a call and ask when you can clean the room. I just want to ask if my Do Not Disturb button is in vain? A bunch of all sorts of little problems anyway! I don't know if I'm asking too much or what. In short, for me, who has lived in a lot of five-star places around the world, this experience is really not very good!

I tried it on the first night, and the price is still very reasonable. The seafood that was eaten in the hotel's Chinese restaurant the next day was 15% off for the in-house guests, and the price was right. It’s just that Shanghai was lifted in June, and we are not from medium and high-risk areas. The health code and itinerary code are all green, and many attractions are not allowed to enter.

The charming smile adds a few points to this pleasant trip to Putuo Mountain! Will come to Hilton again next time!

msg:One of the most inconsistent hotels I've ever booked on Ctrip in my entire life, I don't even mention the photos of their house. The sea view is not right and the toothbrush is empty. It's the first time in a long time. There is sand when you see the bed sheets when you check in. Is there no hygiene in this hotel?
When I checked in, I habitually said a sentence, can you give me the highest room type in the same category, because I saw that the occupancy rate of the basic lights is less than 10%, I think it is a reasonable request, and the person who was checked in said, "You The room type I ordered is like this." I was a little stunned and didn't say anything until I got to the room and the picture and text did not match. I called Ctrip customer service, and the person called me again, "I can't give you a refund." I'm not sorry at all. Do you apologize at one point in the middle of the night? ? ?

So I was so angry that I ignored any measures taken by the hotel afterwards. It was really bad. I would send an email to Hilton later to complain. No matter what time the lobby was empty, the service staff came to check in in a daze. simply outrageous

msg:In this festive festival, the comfort that was originally expected, but experienced an unpleasant experience. I booked an executive room from January 31st to February 3rd (2 nights + 1 night), and the unpleasant shadow was planted from the moment I stepped into the hotel. During the epidemic, it is understandable to show or some required inspections. What is puzzling is that in a particularly wet and cold winter, a table was placed outside the empty hotel door, and the guests were ruthlessly standing in the cold wind and rain for nearly ten minutes. Why can't guests come in to check? I made a pertinent opinion but remained unmoved, and stayed for three days as usual. Although, after fulfilling the check-in procedures, there is an exemption card. However, this approach lacks the minimum courtesy and respect for the guests; the coffee ☕️ cups used on the first day of stay have not been exchanged and cleaned in the past three days; the used hair dryers, where the guests put them aside, are still there after the room is made. ; It is unknown whether the bathroom has been cleaned, but indecently, the door is not closed at will; it is said that the cake can be reserved. Before 8:00 pm on the first day of the first day, I specially contacted the front desk to make a reservation. Three can get the cake; today, leave the hotel before noon and return to the hotel at night. Stepping into the room was a mess, and it was an instant disappoin**ent and displeasure. The unpleasant experience time and time again, I feel that I am not staying in a Hilton hotel, nor in an executive room. On the first day of check-in at the hotel, I was praised by the front desk. Not bad reviews have been given respect, because good reviews cannot be rhetorical, not a cosmetic modification, but a compliment and affirmation of Hilton's professionalism and professionalism. Hilton's brand knows no borders or regions, and it is believed that its service concept and standards should be consistent.

Sell the swimming pool for children to learn to swim. I see more children learning to swim! The price of breakfast is very expensive, 168, and there is basically nothing to eat. It is estimated that they are not worried about business and do not need quality when they are close to Putuo Mountain! The bed in the standard room is also very small, because the second child is a family, but in other hotels we booked, the bed in the standard room is still good, quite big! It is estimated that each hotel has different standards! Will not live next year!

msg:It was the first time I stayed at the Hilton Hotel with full expectations, but the user experience was not good at all. It was not as good as a four-star hotel. The price difference was more than doubled. From the staff service to the hotel facilities, it was unsatisfactory.

Service: On the day of check-in, the waiter changed the room type without telling it, and the changed room did not have a bathtub. It was still a children's room. We were not married. The whole children's room was really embarrassing. Call the customer service to give feedback, the customer service did not apologize after listening to it, and asked me: What do you want? I made it clear that I had to change the room before I changed the room type booked.
It was our birthday that day. I asked the hotel to borrow a lighter. The customer service didn’t ask why, so they said that they couldn’t smoke. I said it wasn’t smoking. The customer service said they couldn’t light incense. I said it’s not incense. Just light a birthday candle and blow it. Indifference says no, this attitude is absolutely absolute.

Facilities: The quality of toothbrushes is comparable to that of a small hotel. It is hard to believe that a five-star hotel is equipped with this... The hotel bathroom does not have an exhaust fan, and the smell of the toilet can not be discharged after using the toilet... The plastic tape of the shower door is broken and it is closed when the door is closed. There is also no buffer, which is scary.

msg:The view of the hotel room is simply super invincible. The 270-degree balcony is so big that I feel exaggerated. It has a sweeping view of the entire sea view. The location is so good that it has high visibility. The feeling of the hardware facilities in this room is only two words, comfortable! In addition, the hotel's service is considered to be a pass, and there are fewer active and warm greetings. Maybe the cause of the epidemic is more serious. Hope to stay again next time and feel the quality service.

There are also small flying insects hovering during the breakfast buffet. Other aspects are okay. The lake view room is actually a man-made lake in a paradise next door.

msg:It can be said that it is the worst Hilton I have ever stayed in, probably because it hosts a lot of groups, and doesn't care about the satisfaction of individual travelers. When I arrived at the hotel at 3pm, I told us that the most common room type cannot be arranged on the same floor. There are only three empty rooms to choose from. You must add 400 yuan per room to upgrade to a sea-view room to be in the same room. Later, I arranged a room with a very musty smell, and after complaining, I brought a small bottle of deodorant. Finally, I made three phone calls and got angry before I changed the room on the same floor. It is recommended that individual travelers do not get angry if they go out!

msg:This is my first time writing a review. I didn't want to be a big shot, but I'm really disappointed with this hotel. I met up with my colleagues to go to Zhoushan for a trip. We checked in at around 8pm but didn't go to the room. We returned to the hotel around 11:30pm. At first, we couldn't open the door with the room card. My husband couldn't get in for a long time (I went to the basement to get my luggage). After I went upstairs, a staff member saw that we couldn't get in and contacted the front desk. Then he went downstairs to deal with it and sent the room card up. After we entered the room, the room was stuffy. I went to set the air conditioner and selected the heating mode. I wanted to adjust the temperature, but the mode kept jumping to cooling. I thought the air conditioner was broken. I called the front desk from the room but no one answered. I answered the phone and called about 3 times. Then I called the room service again, but no one answered. Then I contacted the merchant through Ctrip, but no one answered. I called through ** and still no one answered. I could only rush to the front desk (the room was on the 25th floor) in anger. Fortunately, the front desk handled it quickly. Later, the engineering staff was arranged to check the air conditioner: when the temperature is adjusted to a certain low temperature mode, it will automatically switch to cooling. When the temperature is adjusted to a certain temperature mode, it will automatically switch to heating. Then I think you can put a warm reminder next to the air conditioner panel. No one's air conditioner is the same as yours. As a five-star hotel, there is no valet parking. I am drunk. Although the lake view king room I booked through Ctrip was upgraded to an executive king room, there is a construction site behind the window. The sound of large infrastructure began very early in the morning. The sanitation of the room is also average. There are no garbage bags in the trash cans. How can this guarantee sanitation? You can't wash it every time you take out the garbage. The quality of paper towels is also not evaluated. As a star hotel, the bath set also feels relatively low.
I think the price is not in line with its quality and service. I will not consider this hotel next time.
The only thing that makes me like this hotel is its loofah, a bath towel, which makes me feel very nice.

Under the name of Hilton, it's not as good as an express hotel. The room is small, I can understand, Zhoushan, everyone is like this, even if there is no value-added service, I make a phone call in the hotel and ask, I can still be impatient, and the attitude is also very poor. I really don't see where Hilton is.
The hotel hardware is not good. There is only an indoor swimming pool. The area is small. It is open to the outside world and people outside can come in and swim. The deepest place is 1m3. Isn't this a children's swimming pool? Lots of people, messy, the water in the pool is muddy, unclean, there is no service staff in the bathroom, no one is doing sanitation during the 2 hours I have been there, paper towels are everywhere on the floor, and the table is also messy, really There is nothing left to say.

The sea view room is really invincible. Woke up by the sun in the morning, you can see the rising sun and the golden light. Behind the large flowing white clouds, it seems that there are immortals living. It is very healing. Opposite the hotel is the sea. There is a seafood street along the coast. There are many choices. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is also good. What surprised me most was the resident singer in the lobby bar of the hotel. They were so awesome, the little baby didn’t even want to leave.

At night, the Ferris wheel lights up and it feels more attractive than the sea-view room. Across the road from the hotel is the Shenjiamen Seafood Stall, which is convenient for eating seafood. The breakfast variety is quite rich, and there are service staff to take the lead during peak hours, which avoids scurrying to find seats like headless flies. The front desk and floor staff at the hotel are very good. The lobby manager Xu Kai's service was very enthusiastic and introduced us to the scenic spots and transportation. The swimming pool is slightly smaller. The overall accommodation experience is very good, will stay again in the future!

In addition, in terms of service, I feel that the staff is unskilled, the room sanitation is average, and the ageing is serious. The breakfast quality is average, and there are no seats at peak. The quality of the breakfast buffet and the price/performance ratio are not bad, but the seafood category feels more frozen and not too fresh. Hope to make persistent efforts.

畢竟是2015年開業的，設施比較老舊，人氣不高，但是衞生尚可。地理位置也優越。
入住當晚進地庫，車速約25kmph,汽車底盤被磕了一下，把問題反饋給了front desk，沒有get我的點也沒有引起重視，前台衹一味解釋從來沒有遇到過這樣的問題。寫一下：從南面進地庫，下地庫右轉彎，約40～50米處，有個駝峯，磕到地盤了。（建議提前設立警告標誌且在駝峯處用黃黑防滑油漆或者塑膠標記）💔
house keeping能看到在桌子上的留言並獲得支持。👍
早餐不夠豐盛也不夠精緻，很普通。

每年都會去普陀山祈福，體驗過朱家尖和普陀山島上的諸多酒店後，還是回到了喜歡的東港舟山希爾頓，之後每次都將選擇這家希爾頓酒店。酒店景色很美，一線海景，非常適合自駕的朋友，開車去朱家尖碼頭上普陀山也就10來分鐘，祈福完畢去酒店旁的普陀天地奧特萊斯逛逛也很悠哉～
非常推薦酒店的中餐廳，好吃且不貴，和外面的餐廳價格也差不多！
這次前台給升級了豪華海景房，早上打開窗簾，海天一色，美極了。遺憾的是竟然沒有詢問前台的工號或者姓名，欠您一個大大的贊👍🏻

酒店設施部分細節能看出歲月的痕跡（比如落地窗框裏的固定栓，畢竟快十年了），整體上還是保養得相當不錯的，舒適性、顏值依然在線。
餐飲方面品嚐了自助早餐+中餐廳，家人表示非常滿意，我個人的評價也是不錯的。希爾頓這個牌子還是相當過硬的，食材、廚藝大可放心。
套餐中包含的接送朱家尖碼頭的服務，酒店免費進行了升級，家人高度好評，強烈點贊。
非常棒的居住體驗，不虛此行。

早餐不到星級水平，麪條檔口的兩位服務員服務態度很差，左右鄰座都在表達不滿，左側位女士還當場向上級投訴了。

msg:這個酒店的海景房是普陀山景，非常漂亮。
周邊算是舟山比較繁華的區域了。

説説我在這家酒店遇到的問題：
行政房間應該是自帶兩份早餐的，如果在攜程預訂的含2份早餐的行政房，應該是在兩份的基礎上再加兩份，就是4份早餐，這是攜程的解釋。
但是這家酒店的解釋是我在攜程預訂的帶早餐的行政房間早餐就是贈送的，衹有兩份。我問他們那如果我預訂不帶早餐的行政房是否有早餐，酒店值班經理的解釋是，也是兩份早餐，那我就納悶了，也就是説早餐錢是百花了唄？
這個問題酒店和攜程各執一詞，最後是給我又給我送了一份早餐,但問題是我在其他的希爾頓都沒遇到這個情況啊。我明明花錢買的，卻變成他們送給我的了…
我到現在也沒搞明白到底是怎麼回事。另外，這家酒店的行政酒廊需要量孩子身高，超高了需要收費，這個也是在其他酒店沒有遇到過的問題。
總之，我發現每次住希爾頓都會遇到些奇奇怪怪的問題，在豪華酒店中，希爾頓的培訓和服務確實是需要提高。

msg:五年前入住過這家酒店，大年三十都在這家跨年的，當時酒店設施還比較新，這次再選擇，從地下車庫的臟亂開始，到前台辦理入住小姑娘的業務不專（估計是用了實習生），一個入住不排隊的情況下辦理了差不多半個多小時，邊錄點資料邊再問詢同事，希爾頓也樣規模的酒店連培訓好上崗的專業前台接待都沒有嗎？房間裏的下水管道整晚反着味道，這個是最難接受的，比較失望的一次入住體驗

msg:套房在把角，房型非常大，有90度的露台和帶落地窗的圓形浴缸，設施總體不錯的。但客廳沙發過於不舒服，和。很直，是住過的套房裡最不舒服多沙發。且衹有1⃣️個長沙發，大家要坐在一起，不太適合再客廳裏坐一家人或談些事情。

海景大床中規中矩，就是總體上是很標準的老希爾頓。

行政酒廊6-8點的happy hour餐食相對很多酒店很豐富，不過和早餐sku有些類似。早餐種類豐富，水平正常發揮。比不上奢品酒店，但符合要求。

酒吧裝飾有點土，歌手的歌和氛圍和服飾以及觀眾互動也都略土，但雞尾酒套餐兩杯酒+薯條才100出頭，還能奢求什麼？

總體來説，不出錯。但也沒有很嚮往去住，打到標準
