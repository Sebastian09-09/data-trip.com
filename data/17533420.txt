msg:Stay at dadonghai hotel was excellent, especially we enjoyed the view from balcony and access to beach nearby. Our room was spacious as my child enjoyed playing here and there. The location is also convenient to reach any destination around sanya. The only thing that hotel lacks is English speaking staffs at front desk, but again they were helpful in many ways. Will surely stay here if we come to sanya again.

msg:The big issue was nobody could speak English and everyone could speak Chinese and Russian. People from reception wasn't really keen to help at all.When I booked the hotel I chose to book with some gifts. Those gifts no one gave me but when I asked at the reception they gave me some vouchers without explanation. So if you can‚Äôt speak Chinese don‚Äôt bother to book an offer with gifts provided. Although the hotel has a great location and the view is amazing.

Clean and nice, the staff really went above and beyond helping me with any little problem I had. Loved their small but SUPER clean pool with a beer bar nearby. Also, they got probably the best hotel gym I ever worked out in. Lots of equipment for strength training and cardio. Very close to the beach and other places to go for food or a drink. Very friendly and generous room cleaning ladies. Thanks for their work! Next time I‚Äôm in Sanya, I won‚Äôt even look up other hotels - will come back to DaDongHai.

The hotel staff were so friendly and even packed us a breakfast to take away as we had an early flight.  The buffet breakfast is delicious with a large variety of dishes and food, definitely something for everyone. The hotel's swimming pool and outside bar have good vibes too. I can not recommend Dadonghai hotel enough.  We will definitely be back again.  Thank you for an awesome holiday.

Our only complaint is the thin walls. You hear EVERYTHING!!! If you stay here, I‚Äôd recommend some type of white noise sounds or bedtime sleep stories to drown out all the sounds. Overall though, it was great stay.

They give you toothbrushes and other amenities. However the room could be cleaned better as there were handprints on the toilet door that weren‚Äôt wiped away from the previous guests . And the WiFi needs improvement as it‚Äôs pretty slower , along with tv channels for foreign guests as there‚Äôs weren‚Äôt any . It is nice that they give you a free fruit bowl to enjoy though .

Unfortunately the pool was a bit too small didn't use it ... beach is better.
Management need to consider Western food in the future...the hotel gave me free buffet dinner, unfortunately I went to eat outside
 because there was very very very limited choice of western food.
Also, no Halal food available... everything almost has pork which is not possible for some guests to eat.
Some improvements need to be done in the food area.

msg:The staff don't speak much English but they are super helpful - not afraid of a translation app. They were very patient with my limited Chinese. The rooms are huge and well priced for the location. Note that this section of the bay is currently closed and being upgraded so you do need to walk a little for the main tourist area. The hotel itself has plenty of entertainment options and I think would be best suited for families or large groups of friends

There is shade provided by  lots of palm trees, underneath which are resturants. The hotel is close to malls and good restaurants. Staff were helpful. Comfortable bed, good shower, reasonable aircon,  but I would have liked it to be colder. Great balcony.  I loved the area. Bustling and full of character. Would I come back? Definitely.

msg:The hotel is very nice, we had a straightforward check in and the room is huge. We had a twin with a balcony which was lovely, it faced half city, half sea. It's a few mins walk to the beach and the pool on the 5th floor is great, open until 11pm which we thought was excellent.
I didn't really like the bathroom set up, both the toilet and shower have frosted glass doors and a gap at the top, so there is no privacy and no wall separating it from the rest of the room, so if you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night your room mate will hear.
The prices of the mini bar were good, however we were disappointed to find that the restaurant shut at 9pm when the information book saif it shut at 11pm, and the room service also stopped at 9pm and the book said it was 24 hour, so we had to order takeout to our room on the first night when we arrived late.
The housekeeping staff were excellent, the room was very clean and maintained that way.
The main restaurant is quite good, standard mix of Chinese and western food and not too expensive.
The location is good in terms of the beach and pool but it's a fairly quiet area so if you want more nightlife I suggest the other bay. 
The only thing that was weird was that on the beach there are designated parasols for the 2 neighbouring hotels, hut not this one even though it's the biggest. There is no sun protection or beds available on the beach, even to rent, so make sure you use plenty of sunscreen and reapply! We got very burned!
Overall we really liked it and would probably stay again (especially if we can get a room with a seperate bathroom).

The hotel swimming pool and gym are on the fifth floor. The outdoor swimming pool is very comfortable and quiet in the afternoon sun. I didn't expect that the front desk staff would remind us of anti-fraud precautions when checking in. This is super important! The day before check-out, there was still a staff member asking about the experience. I was really satisfied and promised to share my check-in experience after check-out. It was a very satisfactory check-in experience. The off-season price is very cost-effective. I will come back next time and recommend it to friends.

The hotel service is also very good, it is close to the Big Pineapple, there are many restaurants nearby, it is very close to the First Market and Luhuitou, and it costs about 10 yuan to take a taxi
The main point
Their bedding is very comfortable and the pillows are very soft (we also looked at the brand of the pillows before leaving)
If you feel uncomfortable with the softness, you can also contact the room service to change the pillow. There are three materials to choose from, which is really user-friendly
Downstairs is Dadonghai Square. After dinner in the evening, you can dance with the square dance aunties

There is a swimming pool in the hotel, but it is still a little small compared to the hotel I stayed in before, hahahaha
But the area near this Dadonghai Hotel feels a little more lively than Sanya Bay. In short, Dadonghai Hotel is a good value hotel and the stay experience is great!

The room is cleaned every day. After the service is completed, the person in charge will come to check (this is the key to improving the quality of the work and not superficiality) and ask us if we have any needs.

The sea view room is beautiful. ~ The hotel guest manager Lisa learned that we were on a honeymoon trip and helped us arrange the room. It was so considerate ~ The air conditioning in the room was also very cool and well-equipped for a 6-night stay. The cleaning service is very good if needed. You can also see the Dadonghai Sea from the balcony. You can reach the beach in two minutes downstairs. I will stay at this hotel next time I travel.

The phone table was knocked over by the customer in front of me, and the drink was sticky and my hands were not wiped clean.
The TV turned off after 15 minutes of screencasting. I called the front desk and was told that screencasting was not supported. For a hotel in this era, screencasting was not supported.
The soundproofing is very bad. If you close the balcony door tightly, the food festival downstairs is so noisy that your ears are buzzing. It‚Äôs noisy until 10pm every day. It‚Äôs terrible.
The front desk is tough and never admits mistakes. Calling to report problems is just tough.
The plates in the breakfast restaurant were not washed and there were small flying insects on the bread.

Go and have a cocktail in the evening. It costs 70 to 80 yuan. It is comfortable. The key is that there are A handsome Russian guy DJs, and Russian beauties are often seen on the beach. It is said that Sanya is the city with the most Russians in China. The breakfast is not bad. The only drawback is that there is no seafood, haha, so I have to go out to eat. The hotel gave us four bottles of water for free, while other hotels usually give us two bottles. The waiter was very considerate and kind, see the picture! Good review! I will come again next time, but I must book a sea view room.

msg:This hotel has been in trouble forever. Below is an objective description in chronological order.
I did receive a call from the hotel one day in advance and asked if I had any needs. I said nothing, just be quiet. The customer service phone number was answered well and they would try their best to arrange for a higher floor. I said thank you~
The next day when I arrived at the front desk of the hotel at around 1 o'clock, the lady said that the room had not been cleaned yet and that check-in would not be possible until three o'clock. I said OK. I understood. I left my luggage at the concierge and went out for a walk. I asked when I returned to the hotel at around 6 o'clock to get the room card. I asked the lady at the front desk if there were any welcome fruits. She said that they should be put away at 6 o'clock. When I got the room card, I found that the 6th floor was highlighted. The floors of this hotel are 6-22. The 6th floor is the lowest in the hotel. The floor I stayed in and the room type I stayed in was listed on Ctrip as the third most expensive room type in their hotel... You can see the screenshot. Although I bought it at the Double Eleven event price, it didn't shrink that much... I also bought Yalong Bay on Double Eleven. Not only did the Mangrove Hotel not shrink the room, it also upgraded it by two extra levels... When I got out of the elevator, I found that the room was entered by swiping the card next to the elevator. It was very heavy and smelled of decay. In fact, the lobby on the first floor was also filled with this smell. My room door I opened the balcony door at the same time to let some air in, but it didn't work for a while. I spent the whole night in a strange smell... (The hotel said it was because it was close to the sea and there was a return of tide, but the mangroves on the seaside had no smell and I had to wait for my return the next night. When I got to the guest room, I found that the smell suddenly faded a lot. I don‚Äôt know how the cleaning aunt dealt with it.) In addition, there was no welcome fruit in the room. I called to urge the fruit to be delivered and found it was a small apple and sour-looking orange. Even the local cleaning aunt I didn‚Äôt even recognize the other two fruits... So I gave them to my aunt the next day without removing the plastic wrap... So what was the point of calling me the day before to ask what I wanted? The room on the lower floor was close to the elevator and had a strong smell. No welcome fruit was prepared. My request was not met. Normal room service was not provided. It felt more like the hotel picked up a group that day. The room may have been overbooked. Trying to see if there was any room reserved before me. I have been responsible for administrative reservations and have worked with other hotels to know a little bit about the process. I am taking my mother out to play. She has undergone a major surgery this year. One is to take her out to relax for a few days. Also, she is about to turn 70. She may not be able to walk anymore. I can barely walk now, so I go out for a walk. Although I want to take her out for a few days to relax in Bialong Bay. The hotel is cheap, but it is not cheap in Dadonghai. The scenery outside the balcony is partly mosaic in the photo because there is a **** posted on the balcony. Do not take random photos... Downstairs is the main street and the parking lot. The photo with the sea on the balcony is already there. I stretched out against the balcony and took the photo. If I sat on a chair normally, I could barely get a sea view of Mimi Point...I felt very angry when I smelled the smell in the room at night and called Ctrip to complain. Ctrip informed the hotel that the room type I booked was the one I booked. The room type has not shrunk and they said they can take me to visit a superior sea view room. I just find it funny. Even if it is not a superior sea view room, there are still so many room types. Do I have to confirm each room type? All I can say is that I am less educated and less knowledgeable. The third most expensive room type only deserves the lowest floor and this view. Ctrip told the hotel that they promised to have a high floor room for me the next day after check-out. However, I have obsessive-compulsive disorder and hate going out and cleaning up and opening over and over again. It is inconvenient to carry a suitcase, especially with my mother. If I am willing to deal with it, I would definitely choose to pay less than 200 yuan for the Crowne Plaza Hotel not far away. Moreover, the plan given by the hotel is only to make up for the poor trea**ent on the first night. It completely ignores the fact that as a traveler, When consumers can't tell the specific situation, they can only make a simple and rough identification through the price system. The result is this...
Talking about the room, there are some advantages. The air conditioner really cools down the air, which is better than the mangrove forest. The lighting in the room is also relatively the brightest among the several hotels I stayed in in Sanya. The shower water temperature and quantity are very powerful. The geographical transportation is indeed more convenient.
The washing and bathroom area is equivalent to an open area and is not enclosed or soundproofed. The sound of using the restroom at night will be a bit obvious.
The concierge felt that the dark-skinned guy from Hainan kept a smile on his face~
Because this is my first time in Sanya, I need to check in the city. From now on, I will only go to Yalong Bay or see if there is any need to go to Wanning to relax~

msg:This is the fourth time I have stayed at Sanya Dadonghai Hotel. The hotel is in a very good location, very close to Dadonghai Bathing Beach. You can walk to swim and then back to the hotel to take a shower. It is convenient and fast. It is very suitable for vacationers like me who like to swim in the sea.

My favorite hotel room is the 270¬∞ sea view room, which has a pleasant view and a panoramic view of the sea and city. The decoration style of the room is very refreshing, and the wooden furniture and blue and white bedding are visually very comfortable. The sanitation is very good, clean and tidy. The important thing is that it is so close to the sea and there is no moisture or odor. The bed is soft and very comfortable, I had a good sleep every night. The breakfast is very rich and varied. There are even various stir-fried, steamed and stewed dishes that I think can be used as dinner. People who get up late can eat it directly as brunch.

The hotel service is also very attentive. I previously stayed in a 270¬∞ sea view room on the 9th floor. Due to the building in front of the hotel, the view was blocked, so this time I specifically made a note that I would like to have a high floor. The lady at the front desk also met my request and arranged it for me. On the 16th floor. Knowing that my return flight was later, Huang Chuntan from the hotel also applied for the benefit of delaying check-out until 4 pm, which was really considerate. Overall it was a very pleasant stay and I will come back next year.

A one-year-old child would get it on his butt when he poops! There are two sockets on each side of the bed, and a meter is also plugged in. There is only one socket for charging, which is not convenient at all! The smell of perfume in the corridor is overwhelming. The decoration on the first floor is quite grand. The nightclub downstairs is busy. Breakfast is good until 12 o'clock. The swimming pool is 1.4 meters and the paddling pool is a little big. The water is only just above the ankle. Swimming rings are free. , Boat 20 is not limited, the naughty building blocks in the children's amu*****t park are free, and the rest are charged! I really don‚Äôt know how to define a family hotel. I have been to Sanya six times in four years and stayed in 20 hotels. This is the worst family hotel.

The steak was so cooked that it was hard to bite. The service attitude at the front desk is worrying. The photo appointment included in the package was also in vain and you could not enjoy the photo appointment service at all...it was impossible for the photographer to come to the hotel to take photos...I reported to the front desk that the service attitude at the front desk was very perfunctory. For the same price, it is recommended to choose the nearby Pearl River Garden Hotel, which has newer facilities than this hotel and an infinity pool on the top floor.

3 The beach has fine sand and clear water, and the waves are slightly larger than Sun Bay in Yalong Bay, but stronger than Qingshui Bay. I didn't wear sunscreen properly and I was sunburned and cried in the sun.
4 The service details are well done, adding quilts and so on are all very positive and smiling faces. I would like to praise Zhu Xiaohong and Zhou Xiaofang by their real names. Now I'm in Arcadia, the rooms are ok but the service is not good, there is no smiling face here and there.

The children are very happy. The shower is more comfortable than other hotels, and the bed can sleep It is comfortable and the service is very good. Sitting on the balcony of the room, you can have a panoramic view of the sea view, and you can also watch the sunset. The afterglow of the sunset is also beautiful on the wall. The balcony door is push-open, and it is not easy for children to get their hands on it. Anyway, it is great!

Before I checked in, I received a contact from Chen Jun from the reception depar**ent to understand my hobbies and requirements for the room. Not only was it fully satisfied, but it also created a welcoming a**osphere for us. When I entered the room, I was pleasantly surprised and very happy.
The hotel is still so good, the location is superior, the room is spacious, the film is comfortable, and the scenery is invincible. Good breakfast and convenient parking. My favorite is the 270-degree sea view, you can feel the scenery of the tropical coast without going out in the room, especially drinking tea on the balcony in the evening, watching the sunset, romantic and comfortable! It's a pity that the itinerary is only for two days, and I didn't live enough, so I can only wait for the next time.

The room smells a bit musty, but unfortunately the deluxe sea view room was full that day, so it was impossible to upgrade. The packages bought on Ctrip for lunch and dinner are all settled in the hotel, which is not bad. The next day, I added money for a luxurious sea view. Facing Dadonghai Square, there are many sea views. Once the balcony door is closed, the music in the square downstairs can be ignored. The breakfast is rich and will add vegetables. Hotel service is still possible, cost-effective.

You can go to Big Pineapple for shopping. It takes less than 3 minutes to walk. The traffic is very convenient. The nearby buses can basically reach all places in Sanya. Great attraction.
The hotel is very clean and the room is fully air-conditioned. The lady at the front desk saw that we booked in advance and directly upgraded us to a sea view room. There is a gym and a swimming pool on the 5th floor. The water quality of the swimming pool is very clean and it closes at 11 pm. It's great. The kids enjoyed it Very happy ‚äô‚ñΩ‚äô. The overall service of the hotel is very good, especially the manager Huang of the hotel is very caring for us.

You can see the beautiful Dadonghai from the balcony. 2. Fresh fruits are delivered every day, and the lotus mist delivered is more delicious than those bought at the night market. 3. The transportation is very convenient. Whether you are going to the First Market, Coconut Dream Corridor or from Phoenix Airport to the hotel, you can get there by public transportation, and it takes less than 5 minutes to get to the beach. It is also very cheap to take a taxi to Xiaodonghai , After staying for four nights, I went to catch the sea twice. Next to it is the Big Pineapple Shopping Center. The surrounding facilities are extremely convenient and complete.
Sanya Dadonghai Hotel made my graduation trip more perfect.

My sister and I left as soon as we agreed, and we chose this one among the hotels near Dadonghai. I read the reviews before leaving, and I was a little worried. Once you're here, there's absolutely no need to worry. First of all, the location of the hotel is excellent, there are many delicious foods around, and the big pineapple is 5 minutes away. And before leaving, I upgraded to a high-class sea view room. It really has an invincible sea view, and the room is large and comfortable. The most surprising thing is that there is a huge amount of rainwater, and the bath is invincible and enjoyable. The breakfast is also very rich, both Chinese and Western. That is, although the coffee is brewed in a pot, the taste is very weak and the taste is not good. The overall rating is five stars, and I will stay here next time.

Just a little comment, the bathroom in the lobby on the first floor needs to be used by swiping a card, and family members who live in the hotel need to get a room card for temporary use, maybe because they are worried about the use of seaside tourists...

The child was very happy, and the fruit was thoughtfully arranged later. The taste was very good. Before leaving the store, I specially took a photo of the night view. Beautiful, I will choose Dadonghai next time I come to Sanya.
Breakfast: Breakfast variety is very rich
Minibar: Minibar only enjoyed drinks

msg:The guest manager, Aileen, is considerate in service, and merged the two agreed before going

The bed was made early. Also sent a lot of fruit! Dadonghai is just a few steps away, and it is very convenient to eat, drink and have fun next to it. The hygiene of the hotel is also very good. The only downside is that the swimming pool for children is only 0.5 meters. It is not suitable for my 7-year-old and 13-year-old children to play. But the children still like this hotel very much and say they will come again next time~

msg:It is very close to the sea, 2 minutes away. It feels great to wear hotel slippers to step on the sand. The weather was cooler when I came here. If the temperature is higher, it would be better to go for a swim. Those who are not afraid of the cold can go to the sea. There is a swimming pool barbecue in the hotel, which is very convenient. The taste is also very good.

msg:In terms of facilities, you can buy enough to travel, and the daily free water, coffee bags, tea bags are affordable and considerate, as well as fruits and drinks from the coffee bar. Hairdryers, irons, slippers, and beach towels are also very practical for playing at the beach. The room is clean and thorough, and bath towels, towels, and face towels are changed daily. Not to mention the environment, in the Dadonghai Scenic Area, the beach and the Dadonghai Night Market are just a few minutes downstairs. In the morning and evening, you can watch the sea from the balcony and watch the sun rise and set. My mother likes to go to sleep at night and enjoy the sea breeze. The transportation is also extremely convenient. You can go to Nanshan Cultural Tourism Area, Yalong Bay, Wuzhigong Island and other local bus stations without changing lines. There are also many delicious foods, such as dross hot pot, coconut chicken, and seafood processing. Walk over to eat, or just a few bus stops away. Finally, I would like to praise Lisa, the housekeeper of the hotel. She contacted us before the trip and helped me confirm and arrange a lot of details. My mother and I brought a lot of clothes and added hangers for us. Thank you very much for her caring and personalization services.

It is very close to the sea and can be reached in 2 minutes on foot. There is a big pineapple shopping mall in the backyard. You can buy fruits and snacks in the supermarket. There are a lot of things to eat, and the price is moderate, cheaper than the seaside. The seaside lobster set meal is not expensive, and the food is very good.

msg:Service: The service is warm and thoughtful. First of all, I would like to thank Chen Jun, the front desk staff. When I checked in, I mentioned my needs and directly upgraded the room type for me for free. The elderly at home took a fancy to this room as soon as they entered the room with their children. We are in Sanya behind They all live here; I forgot to bring my room card, and when I need to solve problems at the front desk, she is very kind and provides services; secondly, the cleaning lady will greet us proactively when she sees us, and she is very caring. My family loves to drink water. We were provided with more water every day; on the last day, the child‚Äôs water bottle could not be found in the hotel. An aunt named Li Fengmei first took the initiative to bring me a bottle of water and told her to drink it for the child. Later, she and I searched for the water bottle in the room. My aunt found it under the bed; finally, I would like to thank the concierge depar**ent, my family takes a lot of things with the children every day, and every time I go to the concierge depar**ent to store things, a little brother named Zhiwen always helps us with things; I am really grateful, the room service can be said It is impeccable, responsive, and quick to respond. Anyway, it is really good. I really hope that the hotel can retain these people with real service spirit to work here. My family members said that they will come here again in the future;

I sleep here the most comfortable for many days. The indoor temperature and bedding are very comfortable ;

Hygiene: The room is clean and hygienic, and the room is tidy and clean after playing every day;

Environment & Location: The hotel has a supporting swimming pool and a children's playground, and you can borrow sand toys for free. The children have a great time playing; the location is superior, it takes about 5 minutes to walk to the beach, and there are big pineapple shopping malls and summer depar**ent stores around, where you can eat, drink and have fun very convenient;

I want to feel comfortable when I come out to play. It must be said that this hotel should be the most cost-effective hotel in Dadonghai. I took the old and the young with me, and they all like it very much. I will stay here again next time I come to Sanya. Strongly recommend hereüëç.

msg:Luxurious a**osphere, elegant environment, delicious meals and considerate service. The 180-degree sea view suite is decorated in a refreshing a**osphere, which is pleasing to the eye. Strolling on the beach a hundred meters away, enjoying the ebb and flow of the tide, bathing in the sea breeze, watching the vast expanse of sparkling waves, and listening to the continuous sound of rumbling waves, it really feels like a drunk in heaven, which makes people forget to return.

msg:The hotel is super cost-effective, and the service attitude is also very good. In Sanya in the off-season, there are only two of us in the whole swimming pool. Every morning when I wake up and open the balcony, I can see the sea. I feel very good. The hotel is very close to the business district. The big pineapple business district is on the right side of the door, the Luhuitou scenic spot is on the left, and the Dadonghai Night Market is behind. The hotel also has a free pick-up service. The drivers are very enthusiastic. Hahaha, the car delivered to the station when leaving is even a Tesla. I will consider this place next time I bring a family. It was a very happy trip~

msg:When we came to Sanya for the first time, we did not apply for any items, only air tickets and hotels.
Every day when I wake up, I go to the beach with my belongings, lay out mats for the children to play in the water and sand, and go back when they are sleepy and tired...
All meals and lodging are in the hotel, room service is in place, welcome fruit, afternoon tea, meals in the package are all careful~
Tang, who is at the front desk, can solve all the problems of accommodation and play. He is attentive, enthusiastic, and sincere enough to solve all the problems we have encountered so far~ No matter how late or how late, he will definitely reply to us when he sees the message! From the pick-up and drop-off service to every care after check-in, our family of three felt the warmth of a different place~
We chose Dadonghai Hotel for this vacation. The appearance of the nearby city is somewhat different from what we imagined. At first, we thought it was a purely commercial scenic spot, but we didn‚Äôt expect it to incorporate a strong a**osphere of local aborigines~
The fried rice noodles downstairs and Qingbuliang are all small restaurants that locals themselves will eat. The coconut chicken hot pot in "Big Pineapple" tastes very unexpected, but it is also surprisingly not a surprise~
I went to the night market twice in the middle, the first time was the first market, and the second time was the Yiheng night market. When I saw the taste of my hometown, I still felt friendly. When I saw the local specialties, I would try every one of them.
Even if I do the same thing every day, I still feel comfortable and not boring. Staying here until the fifth day, I still can't bear the waves and the beach... The children are happy, and the adults live comfortably...
‚ù§So I think this trip is perfect~!
