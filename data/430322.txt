msg:My boyfriend and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Chengdu Panda Garden during our visit to Chengdu. We were really impressed with how beautiful the hotel was and how friendly the staff was. Upon check-in, they upgraded our room to a very spacious panda room, and I must say, the view from our bedroom window was immaculate. The hotel provided a shuttle to go to the Panda breeding park. My only disappointment was I didn’t stay long, as our visit to Chengdu was short. Despite the hotel's location, I will highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chengdu. I really love my stay, and I will definitely be staying back here when I revisit Chengdu.

msg:This was a first class experience at a first class hotel.  Right from the start I was made to feel at home and was allowed to check in much earlier than 2pm which was ideal as I could freshen up before going to my future work place.  In addition, complimentary breakfast was added to my reservation which again was a big bonus and the choices were fantastic.  The grounds around the hotel are very nice to take a walk and the hotel is very near to many restaurants.  The room itself was comfortable and great value for money and even having a bathtub was nice to use at the end of the day.  This is a great place for anybody to stay and is family friendly which is convenient to go and see the pandas.  All the staff were fantastic but I must mention Paul who really went that extra mile to make stay comfortable and even exchanged his Wechat in case I needed any help.  His professional approach and English speaking ability is a great asset to the hotel.  I will definitely be returning soon.

Best location to wake early for the Panada bears with complementary 'panda bus'.

I was kindly upgraded after a long travel day which was so appreciated.  Absolutely beautiful room.

Buffet breakfast was great.  Pool, gym, and games area.  

Everything you need.  Highly recommend.

Location is great for panda park with its shuttle bus but obviously far from city sights and i don't think theres anything else around. WiFi didn't connect and I had to get access code from front desk. I had already prepaid but was asked to pay when I checked in, they quickly rectified their mistake and apologised, but strange. Room was clean and comfortable, I slept well. Light switches are quite badly labelled though, you just have to press them all and see which lights you want. I went to check the spa but there was nothing there, so information on that needs updating. Outdoor pool looks great for kids, indoor one was quite busy (aug). All in all a good stay.

msg:This hotel surprised me. It’s more catered to the ‘business man or woman’ or ‘family looking for a day break away’ than your usual traveller. I’m not sure if it was the business ‘private dinner’ events or the lack of things to do at the hotel- this hotel unfortunately didn’t surpass expectations for what a ‘crowne plaza’ should be. 

As for the hotel itself, it was reasonably priced for our stay but the price should’ve already included meals. That being said, if you haven’t invested, get the breakfast buffet (see picture) because the surrounding area doesn’t offer a lot of different foods and the lunch menu at the hotel is simple and short. I did get items off the lunch menu, but I was disappointed with my choice of spaghetti as it tasted and looked like it had come from a tinned can (see picture). The same ‘western’ restaurant that served breakfast also served a dinner buffet (see picture) and, although it was lacking western foods, the selection was good and I would again recommend it for your stay. However, as experienced, make sure the buffet is for guests as we were left to feel embarrassed when the buffet had been ‘booked out’ by a private event with tickets, making us ‘normal paying guests’ wondering where to get food - the answer was a local pizzeria on Meituan. 

You’d expect 4 star service from a worldly known hotel such as this and there were certainly 2 individuals that went above the normal service to make our stay better. Bana Cheng from the reception team - Bana was like a personal assistant, answering every query and question we had on wechat about the hotel or surrounding area. James from Cafe 198 was very friendly and, as he was one of few members of staff that could speak English, he was able to give us better restaurant service and was kind enough to pack us food and snacks for our flight early the next morning as we were sadly unable to make the breakfast buffet. 

During our stay we visited the Panda research facility nearby and this was one of the reasons we chose the hotel. The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to and from the center at certain times, which was very helpful to know. 

In the daytime as it was too hot to go out, we had a spa treatment at the spa in the hotel. It was very pleasant and the ladies were helpful to translate our treatment. The room was beautiful however there was mould growing on the ceiling which wasn’t so pleasant (see picture). We also visited the outside pool and man made beach - I was surprised that the hotel was charging additional money for floaters for the children and didn’t offer beach type towels (see picture). Even though the temperature of the pool was great and it was a nice afternoon, unfortunately the sun lounges were dirty, mouldy or broken and the lifeguard was shouting at us in Chinese, probably something about wearing caps in the pool. 

The room was pleasant (see picture), we’d requested a non smoking room facing the gardens on a high floor, which the hotel kindly accommodated for. The room had a bath, which was enjoyable to use, and good aircon circulation with a massive bed. 

Although the stay was pleasant, the standard of ‘the crowne plaza’ was let down by quality of furniture and decor, lack of communication with paying guests about where they can eat and the lack of tourist attractions in the nearby area. I’d recommend a stay for 1-2 nights, 3-4 is too long.

Three days before the trip, the customer service contacted me to confirm the check-in requirements and details, and also upgraded the room. The hotel is located in a residential area, with a large lawn, a children's swimming pool, and a small church. The panda tower of the panda base can be seen not far away, and the scenery outside the window is first-class. The lobby corridor is full of panda images, which is cute. The room is very clean, and the parent-child room is full of panda elements. The children are so happy that they dance with joy. It is very close to the panda base, and the shuttle bus is very convenient. Have fun and live comfortably. The staff I came into contact with are all warm and enthusiastic. The front desk lady, the concierge brother, the cleaning aunt, and the shuttle uncle are all very polite, like a spring breeze, and feel the hospitality of Chengdu.
The hotel has been open for a long time, but the care and quality can be seen in the details. It is properly maintained and does not feel old, and the hardware is also slowly being upgraded. The only drawback is that the hair dryer is a bit old, the TV is not smart enough, and the humidity is heavy, but the flaws are not enough. I will stay here next time!

Whether it is the service at the front desk or the hygiene of the room, they are all very good. There is a green area on the back mountain, and there are little rabbits to feed. The only bad thing is that there are too many mosquitoes on the back mountain. The small black mosquitoes unique to Sichuan will cause red rashes after being bitten, which feels like an allergy and is very itchy. It is recommended to carry mosquito repellent with you, but this is not something the hotel can control. Here are special thanks to Xiao Wei and Xiao Xia at the front desk. They solved the problem in time and actively provided us with thoughtful help. I look forward to the opening of the outdoor swimming pool in summer, 💚💚💚💚💚💚

The guests' things are more expensive than you think, and the guests who arrive late at the hotel are also guests with children and the elderly. Although they only stay for one night, they are no less than the guests who hold your wedding in the hotel. You have to listen to the reasonable requests of the guests, don't act on your own.

The lawn and the church are also worth seeing, even if it rains. What I love most is the panda coffee for breakfast☕️, which is so cute that I can't bear to drink it😝. It is a must-order coffee for breakfast for two consecutive days☕️. In short, staying here is the best choice to see pandas👍

You must first pull the suitcase to the lobby. In addition, the roads in the residential area are very narrow and there are many cars on the roadside. The environment and service are impeccable. We also use the shuttle bus of the Panda Base. Although we didn't use it, the staff asked attentively and the service was very good.

msg:When you step into this garden hotel, you will be immediately attracted by the green scenery. Every corner is full of vitality. Trees, flowers, and birdsong compose a natural and harmonious movement. On Friday, several couples took wedding photos here. The church on the hillside is very romantic💕. It is also equipped with a large outdoor swimming pool and beach🏖️. It is like the seaside, and you can get rid of the high temperature in the summer. The karting venue is not small🏎️. It feels like a vacation. The design of the guest room is simple and comfortable. We chose the superior twin room. Each room is equipped with a large floor-to-ceiling window. While enjoying the beautiful garden scenery, you can also enjoy a private personal space. The hotel's buffet restaurant is on the B1 floor, but the more than ten-meter high ceiling looks very imposing. There are a wide variety of dishes. The price of 600+ yuan for a room is very cost-effective. The most convenient thing about staying here is that the hotel is very close to the panda base. Breakfast starts at 6:30. The hotel has a shuttle bus at 7:30 to take guests to the panda base. The journey takes about 15 minutes. Get off the car and walk to the parking lot for 3 minutes to the entrance of the base. Shuttle bus departure time: 7:30, 8:15, 9:15, 10:15, 13:15 Shuttle bus pick-up time: 11:00, 12:00, 13:00, 14:00, 15:00 Guests staying here must make an appoin**ent with the hotel concierge in advance⚠️⚠️ However, the hotel's service is very good. They will actively ask guests if they need to take the bus and ask what time to return. The hotel also gave a panda headband when checking out. Wear it beautifully to see the flowers in the morning.

I chose this hotel because I wanted to see the active panda activities. #Good review# The customer service will contact you in advance to inquire about the room needs. I can’t earn points for IHG when booking on Ctrip. However, the front desk was very friendly and sent breakfast. They also sent a family suite. The hotel has a shuttle bus to and from the base, which needs to be booked in advance. The view here is great. You can also see the panda tower at the base. It’s a natural oxygen bar with a vast sky and land. There is also an outdoor swimming pool, which should be more fun in summer. I was also told at checkout that I was given a cute panda pendant. I was happy and liked it. Shuttle bus from the hotel to and from the panda base: The earliest one is 7:15

The bedding and bathing facilities are all panda-themed and very cute. The children like it very much. One of the glasses was very dirty because I didn't use it and didn't ask the waiter to change it. But I didn't dare to use the electric kettle because I was afraid it was unhygienic. The hotel breakfast is good and the restaurant service is also good.

I wanted to visit the giant panda base after four years, so I found a nearby hotel to stay in. Before I checked in, the housekeeper Xiao Zhou called and added WeChat, and upgraded the room type.
The check-in was very smooth, and the upgraded panda-themed room was full of surprises. Both adults and children liked it very much.
The geographical location is the advantage of this hotel, and there are shuttle buses in the morning and afternoon, which is very convenient.
Anyway, all matters are directly contacted with the housekeeper Xiao Zhou on WeChat, which is very convenient. Thank you housekeeper Xiao Zhou~
I will come again next time if I have the chance

I especially praise the housekeeper Jasmine, who contacted me in advance and was very caring during my stay. The lady in charge of the luggage is not only beautiful, but also very careful and considerate. She is deeply loved by the children. The go-kart is also good, but the environment is too good and there are many mosquitoes. The hotel facilities are slightly outdated, but the quality is good. The suite is very large.

When we checked in, the front desk brother Li Junhong patiently introduced us to some basic information of the hotel. His speed and tone were very nice, and he also upgraded our room. Thank you very much! 2. After that, the baby wanted to hand-paint a windmill, and the brother Sha Jinlong patiently helped the baby and told us some stories about giant pandas, which was very kind; 3. The room was really comfortable. Because it was a panda theme, it was particularly suitable for the theme of our trip. The children liked it very much; 4. We went to play karts in the afternoon of check-in. The safety officer sister and brother were really full of energy! Cheer up and encourage the baby. I was really moved by their professionalism! I forgot to ask the name, so I can only give feedback through comments! 5. There is also a girl with glasses in the concierge depar**ent who answers all questions! Helped us book the shuttle bus to the panda base the next day, very polite, but I forgot to ask for the name; 6. The Chinese food we had for dinner on Thursday tasted good, and the ladies in the restaurant were also very smiling~ 7. When we went to eat breakfast, a lady with glasses made panda coffee, which was really cute. I observed that this lady could keep smiling for more than half an hour, which really made people feel like spring breeze. I still forgot her name, otherwise, you can praise her by real name; in short, we stayed for 2 nights, and the hotel really made us feel at home. If I really want to make a suggestion, I hope that the chicken wings in the children's hamburger set can be free of spicy~ Thanks again to all the hotel staff for their professionalism and dedication! Ah, I have begun to miss the days of staying in the hotel for a few days.

It is the first time for me, a commoner, to live in such a big room, which is beyond my imagination! After arriving at the hotel in the evening, the hotel provided a free simple meal (it was so warm, I was a little tired after traveling all the way, so I could eat something immediately after checking in). Although the simple meal only had 4 vegetarian dishes and one meat dish, it still tasted like a big meal. If you don’t want to eat a simple meal, you can have a buffet for 188 yuan/person. Our troops were divided into two groups, one had a simple meal and the other two had a buffet. Finally, I highly recommend this store! If I have the opportunity to visit Chengdu again, I will choose this hotel or its chain store.

The bus for viewing flowers in the morning is also very good and connects well with breakfast.
Children also have fun bathing and swimming in the bathtub
There was no random price increase during the holidays, and the service was still very considerate.
The small disadvantages are that the facilities are a bit old, the beds are a bit small, the children's play facilities are old, and it is not very close to the panda base. It is a long way back from the base to take a taxi online, and Huahua ignored us after waiting in line for so long.

There may be fewer places to eat around Xindu District, or it may be because of the Spring Festival. Except for the commercial streets, all other shops are closed and they go home for the New Year.
There is a supermarket within a 5-minute walk around where I live, which is quite convenient.

It was getting late, so we rushed to check in before getting off work. The child was 3 and a half years old and was afraid to drive it at first. I thought about posing for some photos the day after tomorrow, but I didn't expect to step on the accelerator and go straight out🤗. This project is a bonus.

msg:I stayed at the hotel for two days and was very satisfied with every aspect of the hotel. The hotel lobby is very grand and luxurious, and the hotel rooms are larger. Especially the air conditioner is very quiet, the room is very warm, and the night light design is also very reasonable. You can see the panda breeding base in the room, and the view is very good. The hotel has a dedicated shuttle bus to the panda base every day, which is very convenient. The hotel breakfast is also rich in variety. The hotel staff are warm and considerate, and the hotel's transportation is also very convenient. You can get to the highway in a few minutes, which is very suitable for self-driving to the surrounding scenic spots. I will choose to stay here again when I come to Chengdu in the future.

They contacted us a few days in advance to confirm, and then because they knew we were traveling with children, they upgraded us to the Ultraman Deluxe Suite for free. We were so happy.

msg:Serve:
1. I was on a business trip with my children. I happened to meet my children for taking an online exam, which was quite important. I wanted to make sure the hotel signal was stable, so I found this place which is slightly out of the city.
2. Two days before check-in, Xiao Liao from the guest service center called me to inquire about my check-in requirements. I explained the purpose of the exam, and she was very cooperative in helping me find which room type had a stronger signal and which one was more suitable for our "online exam." ". And you sent me a WeChat message at about 10 o'clock the day before check-in, telling me that you could check in early and debug the network🛜. Thank you very much.
3. When I checked in, I learned that the room had been upgraded to an executive floor, presumably for the sake of a more stable network.
4. After checking in, I found that the laptop 💻 could be connected to the power supply 🔌 for the online exam without power supply, but the power supply 🔌 could not be connected to the plug of another Ipad next to the invigilator. It was a bit far away and required a power *****. I called the guest service center and got a call back. To no avail, there was no external wiring board. At that time, I was really pressed for time when I ran out to buy it, and no one could be in the camera when the exam started. I had no choice but to contact Xiao Liao again, and he immediately helped me contact the wiring board and delivered it to the room, which was timely. Thank you.
4. After my child took the exam, my father, who was on a business trip for dinner, returned to the hotel and started to have a fever. The temperature was 39.9. I was "harassed" by me several times at the service center in the middle of the night. I asked for mineral water twice, each time with five bottles of water. If I have a fever, I must replenish water and then ask for a quilt. To keep warm, here is a quilt cover delivered to the room. There is a spare quilt in the cloakroom. I am wearing a mask 😷 My father is taking care of the child. I put on the quilt myself. The service staff asked me to come in and help put the quilt on. I refused. I am a worker, no matter what type. It's so uncomfortable to have a cold. After seeing me wearing a mask, he repeatedly confirmed whether he needed help. Thank you.
5. After taking antipyretic medicine, the temperature was still 37.8, so I asked the service center again. This time I asked for ice. It was so awesome. I gave him a bag and a small bucket. After using ice under my arms, the temperature was finally under control. And by the time I checked out at 12 o'clock the next day, I didn't have a fever again. I guess I caught a cold due to the large temperature difference.
The above five points are eloquent. In a word, it is an unforgettable stay experience. I must give it a thumbs up 👍.


Facilities: A bit old, but can be used normally, perfect service, completely ignore the facilities this time.

Hygiene: The rooms are very clean and have no peculiar smell.

Environment: The window view is very good, a bit depressed in winter, but it is also a different kind of beauty. It is very close to the panda base. There are many panda-themed elements in the lobby, restaurant, outdoors, and I heard that there are also panda-themed rooms.
This review is more of a thank you than an evaluation. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the whole family. Whether it was taking an online exam or having a fever, I was treated like a home away from home. I look forward to my next visit to a Holiday Inn brand hotel.

Service: The service is very attentive. When withdrawing money, the arrival time will be confirmed, and there will be a dedicated person to communicate via WeChat. Any problems are solved proactively. The main reason is that it is close to the base and there are special buses connecting it.


Facilities: It feels a bit older. The partitions between the dining tables in the restaurant are very dirty. The carpets coming out of the elevator on the floor are also very dirty. There was a layer of floating soil on the table in the house.

What I am not very satisfied with is that the breakfast in the restaurant is different every day and the quality is also different. The rice noodles on the second day were really terrible. They were salty and oily, and the soup was not hot. They were put out in several bowls and put some rice noodles in when someone ordered.

The overall feeling is okay. There is only one convenient hotel around the base.

Hotel shuttle bus to and from the panda base: it takes 10 minutes to reach the south gate of the base.

Tia, the check-in housekeeper, would remind us of the precautions and also deliver takeout to the room. Thank you very much. It's a pity that the special forces woke up from the trip and went out and went to sleep when they came back. They didn't even take a good look at the hotel. The hotel bus is very convenient to the Panda Base, and you can see the Panda Tower in the distance. Living in a large community is very quiet and convenient. There are supermarkets and cake shops nearby. It takes half an hour to take a taxi to the city.

Service: The service is very good. They called me before checking in to confirm the number of people staying and whether there were children. They prepared children's supplies in advance and made a reservation for the shuttle bus to the panda base. The room has a bathtub. I want a disposable bathtub cover, which is also delivered to the room for free.

Environment: The hotel has a beautiful environment, with a large lawn and a church, which is very artistic. There is also a large beach. There is no outdoor swimming pool during the National Day, but the sand is enough to play for more than an hour, and it is not enough.

The room was big and clean, I really forgot to take pictures.
In short, I really recommend this hotel to bring children to the Panda Base.

The one-on-one service butler answered the questions very patiently and told me that I was bringing children to stay, and that I had been upgraded to a panda-themed room for free, and breakfast was given as a complimentary.
The details of the hotel are very good - the baby's toiletry set, slippers, etc. - I didn't see the child's bathrobe. After telling the housekeeper, it was delivered very quickly. Accurate to the point... I will omit the 10,000 words of praise here ~ All in all, it is worth staying here many times.

Shuttle bus transfer from the hotel to and from the Panda Base: The pick-up driver is gentle and reminds you to grab a bottle of water when getting on and off the bus.

msg:First of all, thank you to hotel guest relations Tia. When we were stuck at the panda base on a sudden heavy rain day, Tia was very considerate and helped us apply for a late check-out so that we could have a comfortable meal and then rush back to the hotel to check out. Great!
I checked in just to see the pandas. There are many panda elements in the lobby (Picture 1). You can see the bamboo shoot tips of the panda base in the room. There is a small church on the hillside below. It should be very interesting, but it rained during the stay so I couldn't experience it. There is a panda shuttle bus every day, which is very good.
Tia asked in advance whether to bring children. It seems that this is a hotel that focuses on parent-child experience, and notified the location and time of the executive lounge. She arrived late that day and did not make it to the lounge. The breakfast the next morning included cheese cold cuts and various types of bread, and the noodle stall had beef noodles, which reached the level of a crown prince (Picture 23, the evaluation of a hotel breakfast should start with whether there are beef noodles, hahaha)
The whole room has a big name, but since it opened early, the overall style is still relatively old-school, as shown in Figure 4, 5, 6 and 7. However, I came here just to look after the cats, so my stay is casual. It is worth mentioning that the hotel quilt is not the big thick quilt, it is very comfortable.
In summary, the personnel service is in place and the hardware is limited by its age. Thanks again tia.

The greenery is also very good, and the eyes are full of green. The hotel service is also very attentive, and the room is very comfortable. If you book a shuttle bus to the Panda Base, you will be reminded by phone in advance before taking the bus. The breakfast in the hotel is also very rich, and the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are also delicious. I will choose Crowne Plaza Poly Park next time

msg:This hotel is specially booked for going to the Panda Base. It's a ten-minute drive, so you can go there early in the morning. The hotel has a shuttle bus to and from the panda base, which is very convenient. The hotel is very close to the residential area, and it is very convenient to eat. The decoration is quite satisfactory, and the refrigerator in the room is empty. I still recommend this hotel when going to the Panda Base. Entering the scenic spot early can save a lot of time.

msg:I planned to go to the panda base, so I chose a hotel nearby. But this experience was surprisingly good! It can be said to be full of surprises. It brought a reverse experience to the end of our entire trip.
There are three that are particularly impressive.
1. Specialized WeChat service, this is very considerate, timely and convenient. If you have any questions and needs, you can communicate directly, and the feedback is also very fast. And I learned that we will go to the Panda Base early in the morning, and help us arrange a shuttle bus for us early. Even the breakfast was solved for us. Really sweet.
2. The room is upgraded, the key is that I didn't sleep well at a place with a high altitude a few days ago, and I didn't get over the altitude sickness. If you don't want to go back to Chengdu, you can relax and be comfortable like this. Everyone is very happy. And the deluxe room is really big, much bigger than the regular executive room.
3. It was a pity that the panda base was a bit regretful. I didn't see Huahua in the queue so early, but the hotel sent a pair of baby pandas when I checked out, and the children were very happy. The whole trip ended perfectly!

It's a pity that I couldn't stay here for two more days this time. Chengdu is still worth coming again.

msg:After staying in this hotel, the rest of the hotels are passers-by!
In the panda-themed room booked by Ctrip, the child said that he wanted an Ultraman. He called the hotel to see if he could change the room type. He simply said that he could change the room if there was availability. Then the hotel staff added me as a V and asked about the arrival time. And so on, because I almost couldn't get a ticket because of my carelessness, I also noticed that the official account has tickets, super enthusiastic. When he arrived in the room, the boy was so excited that he was full of blood and started a battle with the monster on the spot. . . I am also very satisfied, the room is big and clean, and the children's toiletries are already arranged. The next day, I couldn’t get back to the hotel at 12 o’clock because I didn’t make a good strategy. I called to explain the situation and thoughtfully helped me delay it. Postponed once! How considerate! All the staff I encountered throughout the process were gentle and patient. It can be seen that the hotel cares about the customer experience. I also gave a panda pendant when I checked out, and the cub cried when I checked out 😂
I have stayed in many hotels, many of which cost thousands of nights without such a comfortable experience. If it is not for the lack of time, I really want to stay for a few more days. It is a pity that the hotels I will stay in later will be compared everywhere.

msg:It's a very old hotel. It smells like the old days. At the beginning, it attracted me because it was close to the giant panda base, the risk of traffic jam was low, and it was the crown
Good place:
1. The display in the hall is in line with the theme of giant pandas, and Zai Zai took a lot of good photos
2. The child was bumped into by us when we braked suddenly in Shanghai during the day, and asked for ice cubes at night, so the response was timely and necessary and moderate
3. Contact in advance and help upgrade the room
passable place
1. Because of the children's training class, I chose to take the evening flight to Chengdu after class. The mini bar mentioned in the service manual was actually empty. I contacted the lady who contacted me in advance to help arrange sparkling water, but there was no happy water anyway. Gap gas
2. The choice of breakfast is quite satisfactory, the rice noodles are delicious, I like it ~ nothing else is impressive, as long as the baby has watermelon, he will be satisfied
3. Due to my own reasons, I missed the appoin**ent for the shuttle bus service at the Panda Base ~ In fact, it costs about 10 yuan to take a taxi, and the price of the hotel shuttle bus is inflated
4. Arriving at the store late at night, the little brother of the guard didn't help us with the luggage. We had a lot of things, and I was a little upset. When we left the store, the luggage service of the guard was acceptable, and the initiative was average, but at least there was a response~
5Before leaving, because there were two free drinks, I went to the drink bar of the restaurant on the G floor to exchange for two iced cokes... What the hell is it that I didn't have a Coke last night... But the attitude of the lady at the bar is kind
6. After leaving, the lady in guest relations "invited" me to give a good review, and took a screenshot... This... I feel a little troubled by the good reviews

Don't expect good service in this kind of old-brand five-star hotel, but the lower limit is too high for peace of mind, so it's not too bad. The five-star hotel closest to the Panda Base, I also often live in Crowne Plaza, but this time I really saw how bad it is.
1. The shower is broken! It was after ten o'clock in the evening to take a shower, but the shower switch was broken, so I couldn't take a shower. This is really unheard of, the first time I encountered such a thing! I had to use the nozzle on the bathtub. The key is that the pipe on the bathtub is not long. You can imagine how embarrassing it is.
2. When I was having breakfast, I met the aunt who was cleaning the room and asked when I would check out. I told her it was 12:00, and she kept asking after that, even knocking on the door. It's so annoying, I really don't know how the hotel trains.

Instead, I have the feeling of living here and always new, and I will not be "proud" because of my favorable position. Bad full service online, polite and courteous, there is a shuttle bus to the base, but the first bus is at 8:30, here is closer to the west gate, a small tip, if you don’t want to see Huahua, it’s more comfortable to enter from the west gate, because the south gate queues for a long time and there are so many people
I really like the room type. It’s the same square shape as my favorite Guangzhou White Swan. The oversized floor-to-ceiling windows and the bed allow you to see the scenery outside the window. You can see the Panda Tower at the base~

msg:1. Before travel
Before check-in, someone will confirm with you the travel time, check-in requirements, and whether you plan to go to the panda base (the shuttle bus between the hotel and the panda base will be reserved in advance for you).

2. Disadvantages
(1) It is recommended that the hotel regularly check the ceiling spray. The ceiling spray in the room we live in is probably a bit old, and the water column has many slanted lines besides the straight line...all sprayed on the face, and I really couldn’t open my eyes! But because I only stayed for two nights, I didn't bother to find customer service to change rooms.
(2) The hotel is equipped with a bathtub, but no disposable bathtub bag was found in the room, so you need to find the hotel separately to provide it. It is recommended to put a warm reminder "the hotel is equipped with disposable bathtub bags, if you need them, please ask the front desk for them".

3. Advantages
(1) When Xiaoxia contacted me about the check-in requirements and time, I was more concerned about whether there was a ceiling spray in the bathroom, and someone made a special trip to help me confirm and reply. Before I went to the Panda Base, I was not sure about the return time, and she suggested that I book a shuttle bus for me in case of emergency. Later, because I had to rush back to check out at the Panda Base, I contacted her to see if I could change the appoin**ent time of the shuttle bus. She also used the authority to help me delay the check-out so that I didn't have to go back in a hurry. It must be praised here! !
(2) It takes more than 100 taxis from Shuangliu Airport at night, because it is considered a suburb, so you can clearly feel the surrounding greenery. There are also many panda dolls of different sizes arranged in the lobby of the hotel. The room area of the hotel is relatively large, with separate toilet, shower room, and bathtub. The shower room is divided into top spray and hand-held. From the room, you can see new couples taking wedding photos on the lawn downstairs. The scenery is very beautiful. The lady at the front desk gave us a lovely gift when we checked out.
(3) On the day of departure to the Panda Base, we will confirm with you again about 30 minutes before the scheduled shuttle bus departure whether to take the shuttle bus. If you take the shuttle bus, you will be reminded to wait in the lobby in advance. The shuttle bus departs on time, so don’t be late.
(4) The lady at the front desk gave us 2 souvenirs when we checked out!
Overall, the stay is very comfortable, and I will come again next time!

Things to improve: Before checking in, you can ask the guests' preferences to allocate a room, because we are bringing children, and it is more convenient Hope to live in the direction facing the church. But since I came for the first time, I didn't know there was another side, so I was a little regretful. But also harmless.

The scenery outside the window is beautiful. Parking is also very convenient. The only thing is that the pick-up and drop-off service time of the Panda Base can be adjusted. It is too late in the morning, and the time at noon is not suitable, but it is very close, and a taxi only costs more than ten yuan.

Let us have a good experience with the Panda Tour Hotel this time. Lots of points for Crowne Plaza. I really like to order Crown when I travel. After all, it is an old chain that is very reliable. The panda suite is very large and has a nice view. The hotel is very close to the panda base, and it is very convenient to take a taxi. Not only the suite is very good, but also let the children experience karting. The hotel also has a beautiful back mountain. If you have nothing to do, it is very good to come here for vacation...

The room is not too big, but it is enough, and it is cleaned relatively clean, but the hotel facilities are a little old, especially now that this kind of non-smart TV is still reserved, and the children complain that they can't watch the cartoons they want to watch...
Let’s talk about breakfast, there are Western and Chinese styles, local noodles, bean curd, etc., the taste is quite satisfactory, there are no surprises, but waffles, which are very fragrant. The cakes in the cake area are not very good, there are few varieties, not refined enough, and the taste is not satisfactory.
The hotel service is very good. They said there was no toothbrush for children in the room, and someone brought it right away. I am very satisfied with the speed of check-in and check-out, and the reservation of the shuttle bus is also very thoughtful. When I leave the store, I also send panda headbands and stickers. The children are very happy!

After check-in, the service staff will tell me that there are fruits in the room, and when I check out, they also thoughtfully sent a luggage tag with a giant panda pattern, which is very loving!
In addition, this hotel is really very close to the Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. The hotel has a free pick-up service, and it is very convenient to call a car by yourself.
In addition, the living facilities around the hotel are complete, including supermarkets, fruit shops, restaurants, and pharmacies, so you can get what you want!
I will choose this one again next time👍

msg:Thank you very much for the thoughtfulness of the hotel, bringing the children alone, and it coincides with May Day. The panda-themed room has been thoughtfully upgraded. The theme room is really suitable for children. The children are very happy. Many details are made of pandas. The children look for them one by one like they are discovering treasures. For the buffet dinner at the hotel, there are also discounts for hotel guests, which is very good. For this quality, it costs 250 outside. There are also children's go-karts, even if they don't go out, it is okay for children to spend half a day here. Maybe it's not too late, the hotel's outdoor bath has no water, but the beach can also be played by children. The most important thing is that there is a hotel shuttle bus to the Panda Base, which can be picked up back and forth. Unfortunately, the traffic control is restricted during the holidays, and the car cannot enter the base. It is better during the holidays. When I left, I also gave the children a panda pendant, and the children liked it very much. The facilities do feel that they are old, but they are still well protected. Full marks are given to the service

There is a free shuttle bus to the Panda Base Hotel, a 10-minute drive. One hour away from Tianfu Airport, Chengdu East Railway Station is just over 20 minutes away.
The hotel environment is very good, there are sand pools, children's playgrounds, and go-karts to play. It is also OK to take pictures on the big lawn. It's a pity that the outdoor swimming pool is not open this season.
The staff of the key hotel are also very good. After booking the hotel, they contacted me in advance to remind me to book tickets for the Panda Base and book a shuttle bus for me. Because I brought a baby, I also applied for a late check-out. Will stay here next time😃

msg:Great hotel. Not far from Panda Base. Cozy territory. The hotel has a shuttle service to the pandas. The car leaves at 8-15 / 9-15, etc. We left at 8-15. At 11.15 we were picked up. had time to see everything. There were no bathrobes in the hotel room. At breakfast, sliced cheese was expected - it was not. I recommend staying there if your target is pandas.

msg:It's close to the panda base, so I booked one night. The service did not say that, I contacted in advance to ask about the needs, and helped to arrange the first shuttle bus to the panda base. The room has a good view, the hotel has a large lawn and a church. The staff of the hotel's concierge saw that we had brought a lot of luggage and helped deliver everything to the room. I went to the panda base early the next morning. The driver, Master Huang, enthusiastically introduced the play strategy, which was very good. The hotel’s Chinese restaurant is also good, and dinner and midnight are all settled in the hotel, which is very convenient.

msg:I won’t check in again for the second time. I came to this hotel for the baby. My husband said for a long time that I saw sand to play. I just went there when I was free this week. First I checked in as a Diamond Rewards Club member. At the time, the front desk told me that the children’s toiletries and fruit plate had been arranged for me, but it was definitely not there. It was not there until I checked out, and the floor was a bit high. I changed a room, and I called the front desk to let it go. I changed the room and the front desk told me immediately, and asked me to wait for her phone call. After waiting for 20 minutes, there was no phone call. I went to the front desk to ask and changed my room. The young lady at the front desk also told another staff member about our room change, but I don’t know why there are still no toiletries and fruit plates. Then I went to the swimming pool. The indoor swimming pool is one of the smallest and most perfunctory I have ever seen, only two. Root, there were too many people, so we went to the outdoor swimming pool. I don’t know. The beautiful sand in that photo is mixed with water. The sand is very rough. Of course, the water is very dirty. I don’t want to say it anymore. Really want to check out! The breakfast on the second day was quite perfunctory, and there were not many people eating breakfast. It is estimated that there were not many people staying. Many carpets in the hotel lobby and elevator were also discolored and moldy. It is probably too long. I think it's okay in other places, the room lighting, hygiene and other things are still ok. After I checked out, the customer service called me in the afternoon and asked if I was satisfied. I responded to her about the fruit plate and children’s toiletries. She replied that she confirmed that she had ordered the fruit plate and toiletries for me. I don’t know where it was delivered. Actually, I won’t eat the fruit platter. But the service is really drunk. I read many reviews and promised that there was a fruit platter that was not available at the end! Anyway, it’s just one night, and I will endure it. I will never come again next time. For the same price, I think Agile Howard Johnson and Evergrande’s hotels can diss this Poly

msg:During the epidemic, a local traveler found this Crowne Plaza as a five-star hotel and also has a Crowne Plaza brand, so I thought it would not be too bad, but I did not expect to step on the thunder. Now I have to remember to describe that the three hundred and sixty degrees are all dead ends. Check-in experience: 1. There is no five-star experience for check-in. The service staff feel that the language is very unprofessional, inexperienced and slow. Could this be an intern shop? 2. Assigned to a bad room. The so-called panda parent-child room except for the pandas printed on the bedding. The panda dolls in the picture promotion have no fruits and no children's supplies. The quality of the hotel toiletries is very poor. The room facilities are old, dirty and messy. The TV is small and vague. I stayed in Chengdu on the hottest day, but the air conditioner didn’t cool. It was hot and thirsty during a nap. I told the front desk to send someone to fix it. It seems that the air conditioner is often The rotten worker was very experienced, and a ladder came in and repaired it. 4. Hot and thirsty, go downstairs to enjoy the equipped afternoon tea set. When the lobby bar listens to the equipped afternoon tea, my face changes suddenly. Ask me if you are eating here or where? I asked if it could still be delivered to the room? If you can’t, I would like to ask where is the point of eating. Then I said that you have to wait for it to be cooked. Let’s wait. During the wait, no one said, no one poured water for a long time. I picked up a few from the kitchen downstairs. After a small dessert came up, I started to pour us drinks. Just in the lobby bar. I don’t want you to ask for the welcome drink for ihg members. I feel that I haven’t heard anyone mention ihg during my stay. It is estimated that the service staff themselves don’t know what hotel they are in. Why can't you pour some water on such a hot day, and still be indifferent? The key is that the occupancy rate is low and few guests are busy. 5. The only thing that feels good is the outdoor swimming pool, but it is still thunderous. In August, Chengdu announced a group of institutions that did not have the quality of swimming pool water. The hotel was on the list. If you make a deduction, you need a refund. I need to provide them with a copy of the front and back of the ID card to apply for this hotel. It’s so funny. No matter what internal process you have, the wrong deduction is not handled actively or the customer’s own fault is still required. Have you applied for a refund? 7. The pre-authorized payment that has been wrongly deducted for nine days after check-out has not been returned. In summary, I suggest that Crowne Plaza will work hard. How can the brand that I liked very much now be downgraded to anyway. The room rate of one thousand and one nights is not low. Isn't it such a service?

I ordered takeout at night, because I was alone with my 5-year-old kid, so I called the front desk to arrange delivery , It turned out to be no good. I had to go down and get it by myself. I had no choice but to let the children in the room by themselves. I went to pick up the food. This is the first time I stayed at the InterContinental Hotel to pick up the food by myself! I already wanted to give a bad review. When I went to the panda base the next day, the concierge and the chauffeur served very well, which made up for my depression the night before. I hope the hotel really pays attention to the service consciousness of the front desk staff!

Various panda elements in the room and welcome fruits were also given. The swimming pool is divided into indoor and outdoor, and there is a beach outdoors, open until nine o'clock. The breakfast is very rich, and there is an exclusive area for members. The breakfast is open very early and there is a shuttle bus to the panda base. We take the shuttle bus that leaves at 8:15 and returns at eleven. I applied for a late check-out and took the bus that departed to the subway station for a quarter. I have searched for good hot pot restaurants or Chuanchuan restaurants near the hotel, but I have to go to the restaurant to eat.

Again, the room facilities, the room is large, the facilities are very complete, the big bed is comfortable, especially the bathroom, bathtub, separate shower room, separate toilet, especially prepared children's toiletries, 👍, the child obviously feels the gap in the next hotel.
Finally, the network cable, usb plug, wifi are all available, and the TV is an old Philips.

Parent-child play 🐼 base, the best choice for staying in the hotel.

✅This hotel has a super large bed room type composed of two single beds. The bed is about 2.5 meters wide. It is very comfortable to bring children to stay. The buffet breakfast is very good, and one more is added, the discount price is 65 yuan per person, and the restaurant can enjoy it when paying on-site. The cafeteria has a ceiling height of more than ten meters and a large space.
It is connected to the lawn for outdoor dining.

✅This hotel is very friendly to children. Specially equipped with children's shampoo, shower gel and body lotion. Outdoors, there is a small beach and swimming pool where children can play. However, this swimming pool has not yet stored water. It will only be opened in July and August when the weather is hot.

✅The room has large glass windows and the scenery outside the window is good. There is a large green lawn in front of me, and the day of check-in coincides with a lawn wedding.

✅The hotel has a shuttle bus to the giant panda breeding base, which is very convenient to play. The car is accompanied by staff and the service is good.

✅Good facilities, location is not in the city center, the price is better than other five-star hotels, cost-effective. The taste of the Chinese restaurant is surprisingly good and the price is good. recommend!

推薦給大家，來看熊貓首選，位置近還有班車坐

唯一讓人很不舒服的是餐廳門口的服務人員,小朋友的餐剩下一個蛋撻和一片麪包,因為要趕熊貓基地的班車,溝通想帶走,不浪費。溝通方式十分刻板，完全沒有五鑽酒店的溝通方式，讓人十分生氣

1.咖啡豆最好中淺烘焙（口感可去参考瑞幸咖啡）。
2.水果能有蘋果更好。
3.房间便利包咖啡口感太淡（建议用雀巢醇品较适中）。
4.堅果能增加核桃南瓜子杏仁更棒。
这次同行的親人在6月份会再去入住（台湾团经成都目的西藏）希望能有更棒的体验。

之前因為看到2013年開業的所以擔心設備老舊，實際還好，舊是舊了點但是衞生都很乾凈的；另外孩子大了需要加床，60平以上房型加300元即可；酒店的草坪和沙灘區環境都很好，服務也很耐心；如果非要挑點問題的話，兩個餐廳的上菜速度有些慢，不知道是不是十一期間客流多的影響。

msg:皇冠假日酒店的水準還是可以的，酒店硬件環境和房間大小衞生都可以，室外看出去也有大草坪，雖然我們沒有時間逛。但是這次服務上有些差強人意。第一，春節入住的時候，小朋友問前台有沒有小禮品，前台給了一張熊貓貼紙，然後這張貼紙不知道酒店有沒有認真看過，上面的有些圖案帶有暴力色彩，熊貓打鬧撕扯麪部，家裡娃看了反而都不高興了，既然主打親子其實還是要應該注意一下的。第二，很多人入住這個酒店應該就是為了來回熊貓基地有接駁車方便，但是春節期間熊貓基地限流，定了去的接駁車，衹開到外圍就要下來了，還是要走很多路到入口，車上問怎麼回來説因為限流要自己回酒店，公交或者網約車都可以很方便，但我們南門進西門出，發現限流之後根本不讓網約車開進來，衹有到市中心的旅遊直通車，這樣回酒店反而非常不方便了，最後我們是加價很多才找了偷偷開進來的車回酒店的，這點酒店也沒有提前告知清楚，非常影響體驗。

第一次去這裏，誰知道停車場這麼坑，都是樓梯，開了一天車，累死，住五星級酒店還要拿着大箱子爬樓梯，

希望有提升的：因為住客未必都是當地人，可以整理一下前往熊貓基地的一些參觀項目（譬如購票流程，付費講解服務）提前推介給住客，甚至提供跟基地的聯動。入住也可以關注是否家庭出行，特別對於四口之家的關懷希望繼續保持（洗漱用品、瓶裝水、拖鞋、枕頭）

室外沙灘游泳池，室內游泳池，房間裏的浴缸孩子都耍了個遍。
因為是酒店會員，所以免費升級到主題房間，延遲退房到下午兩點。入住期間，各種需求及時滿足，包括送個筷子送個水啊，浴缸玩水弄濕了洗手間，大晚上的服務員來及時清理啊……
因為在保利198小區中間，所以喊個外賣也方便。晚上在酒店餐廳吃的，菜品品質也不錯。

1. 酒店半夜聽到飛蟲拍擊牆壁的聲音，但是又沒找着，無奈作罷
2. 洗漱用品從來不會主動添加，直到入住最後一天，想給娃換雙新的拖鞋，才發現沒有新的小童拖鞋，酒店都不主動換的，打電話詢問還説哦您説了就給換，敢情不説就不換是吧！
3. 房間被褥特別潮濕，衣服也是，住的這幾天也沒怎麼下雨，怎麼酒店房間裏面跟下過雨似的
4. 早餐一般，我有一次早上沒有吃，酒店是不退早餐錢的。酒店説是6點到10點早餐，因為要很早趕火車，所以6點就去吃早飯，結果都是涼的，熱的飯一個都沒有，敢情是6點才準備吧！9點半去吃的時候早餐都已經所剩無幾了，早餐樣數也比較少，沒有什麼特別好吃的！

酒店設施很適合帶小孩出遊，酒店有游泳池，卡丁車，沙池等小童遊玩區，孩子超喜歡。本來訂了2晚，後面直接延住多一晚，主要孩子喜歡。
打車去市裡麪也就30分鐘左右，還算方便。前台服務挺熱情的，還送了孩子早餐。免費贈飲也可以領，沒有限時間，不錯的體驗。

客房本身寬敞乾淨，配備了我需要的所有設施，床特別舒適，我每晚都能睡得很香。酒店早飯也非常豐盛，口味也不錯。
總的來説，我強烈推薦成都保利皇冠假日酒店給任何來到成都熊貓基地的旅客。它物有所值，提供了舒適、方便和愉快的住宿體驗。
I recently stayed at the Crowne Plaza Chengdu Panda Garden Hotel, which is located near the Panda Garden. It was incredibly convenient for me to visit the Panda Garden since the hotel is located very close by. The staff were friendly and always willing to help me with directions and transportation.
The room itself was spacious and clean, with all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay. The bed was comfortable, and I slept well each night. The hotel also had a great selection of restaurants and bars, so I was able to enjoy delicious food and drink after a long day of exploring.
Overall, I highly recommend the hotel for anyone visiting the Panda Garden. It's a great value for the price and provides a comfortable, convenient, and enjoyable stay.

酒店入住結束後，客服還會詢問入住感受，很貼心。

距離熊貓基地很近，開車不到10分鐘就到了。迎賓小哥還親切的告訴我們前往攻略，省了不少事兒。
春節期間室內泳池，行政酒廊關閉了，但是增加了歡樂時光（18-20點提供簡餐，説是簡餐也很好吃，小朋友直接吃了滿滿一碗雞蛋炒飯，還有肉沫豇豆和排骨燉豬蹄也很棒）
唯一的遺憾是想要續住一天，繼續享受皇冠假日的服務，無奈已經訂滿了，衹能按照行程繼續出發。

早餐種類少了點，可能是因為疫情過後目前入住人不多，餐飲的服務需要提升。

酒店去熊貓基地有車專門接送很方便，但我們是從南門進不小心到西門出了，發現西門可以掃碼半價買門票。意外發現。

我們帶着寶寶們來看大熊貓。這是大熊貓附近唯一的五星，結果我提前幾天詢問的事項，在我們離店時才得到回覆。整個酒店不知如何管理的，每個部門之間都不通氣，打電話要個東西送到的總是不是你要的。廁所沒打掃乾淨，地上要污漬和臟東西。地毯又臟又舊。食物非常慢，千萬別去吃午餐點西餐。總之不會再來。

分鐘才買到。
因為是來參加會議，物料運過來，酒店的銷售就把事情扔回給客户，一大早7點，禮賓部説太大放不下，就讓客户自己在這個偏遠的酒店自行想辦法，我就納悶了，而且物料去並沒有説的那麼大，足夠有地方放，就不懂為什麼要為難客户。去那麼多的酒店辦會議還真第一次碰到。到下午要找個卸貨區，居然要問了一圈才問到在哪，我真服了。這種服務還對得起這個酒店牌子嗎？

　　2.這個酒店位置很好，環境很清幽安靜，不會被人打擾，離熊貓基地和漫花莊園都很近，服務好很多，在五星裏麪價格不貴，環境也不錯。房間乾淨，早餐也很豐富，感謝賓客關係部的小廖lora小姐姐提前聯繫幫忙預約班車的優質服務，賓至如歸的感覺，極力推薦
　　3.入住酒店大廳看起來很舒適和豪華，酒店有免費的停車場、大巴車接送。前台小姐姐服務好，房間的床品好舒服的，房間物品齊全，還有早餐真的好好啊！下次還會繼續入住的。
　4.我訂的是大床房，那個床睡着特別舒服，有種慢慢沉下去的感覺，很快就睡著了，質感不錯。酒店是個大大的莊園一樣的，吃完飯去散會兒步，感覺很舒服
　　5.房間乾淨，安靜，早餐豐富，適合帶孩子，還可以免費停車。
　6.入住過無數次了，酒店的小姐姐們熱情，連保潔阿姨都態度很好，每次入住都體驗不錯，百分推薦！

msg:酒店很棒，內外部環境很好，很安靜，公共區域 高檔大氣，房間也夠大，裝修豪華，設施齊全，衞生良好，住着舒服，早餐豐富，味道可口，服務也很好，退房時落下一張毛巾，服務員都還打電話來問還需不需要，酒店位置離熊貓基地很近，去熊貓基地的絕佳入住選擇，雖然五一節價格比平時高了不少，但還是覺得值得！忘了在酒店拍照，就留下一段熊貓基地的視頻作為見證吧！

msg:酒店離成都大熊貓繁育基地比較近，熊貓主題房設施齊全，專門配有小朋友的拖鞋、洗護用品等，床品等帶有熊貓元素，孩子很喜歡。
酒店服務很好，前台的工作人員熱情有耐心，去吃早餐時西餐廳的秀麗小姐姐特意介紹了有給小朋友準備的小童食品區，還提醒去熊貓基地一定要提前預約好。在熊貓基地遊玩時還接到酒店的電話，温馨提示由於基地附近交通管制，酒店無法提供返回的巴士，需要自行安排返回（PS：其實前一天入住時已經問過前台工作人員了，又接到了一次提醒電話，感覺服務真是很到位）

msg:距離熊貓基地最近的高檔酒店，看熊貓很方便，設施和服務也很好，有兩點美中不足：
1、熊貓基地實行預約制以後，酒店含門票套餐衹負責大人的門票，不負責小孩的免費票，需要自己半夜去刷免費票，這很不友好，希望改進。
2、到熊貓基地的班車時間太晚，如果跟班車過去，入園以後的排隊時間大大增加，衹能自己早起打車過去入園，希望調整班車時間或者增加班次，解決早入園問題。

衞生：內部衞生還是很乾凈的。
環境：酒店附近環境還是挺好的，就是需要買東西的話需要下到小區那邊的便利店才能購買，距離市區也比較遠。
服務：服務滿分，非常棒。
酒店來回熊貓基地的穿梭巴士接送:這個沒享受到，因為是早上八點十五分才是第一班車，而開園時間是早上7點半，想着早點過去所以就沒搭乘巴士前往了。

不過小朋友很喜歡酒店的熊貓拖鞋，熊貓爪子也買了，草坪適合秋天可以帶娃來放風箏
