The room was spacious with a wonderful view. The swimming pool is stunning. 10 minutes walk to the beach. The breakfast is excellent. Open 7 to 13:30 which is really convenient. A lot of choice.
Had an amazing experience. Thank you ❤️

msg:Only one sentence to describe this stay in the Harman hotel: don't waste your money or your time. 
Indeed, if the arrival at this hotel happened in good conditions I admit, the more the days passed, the more I discovered from surprise to surprise the catastrophe of this hotel. 
1, employees are contemptuous of people who speak English and therefore foreigners. Completely disrespectful and very rude. Furthermore, regarding the room, upon arrival the first day the bathroom was not even cleaned, there were still hairs (probably from former vacationers) in it. In addition, the cleaning was done quickly and was not at all worthy of a 5-star hotel. 
I didn't have breakfast during my stay but on the last day of my departure I decided to give it a try, however it was a very big mistake. One word: disgusting. Breakfast was literally disgusting, I had a stomach ache right after! One piece of advice: don’t have breakfast, it’s a waste of money. 
During check-in I explained all this to an employee (the most respectful obviously) because the others did not even deign to look at me and only took the hotel card from me without speaking to me. . Despite my explanations, apart from apologizing, no solutions were given to my problems. I expected a minimum from them, at least a commercial gesture for breakfast which cost me 138 yuan in the wind because it was impossible to eat because the food was not fresh. 
In short, very disappointed with this hotel, add $100 and go to a real 5 star hotel where they will treat you with respect.

msg:Situated at the rear of a modern, air-conditioned shopping centre, this hotel is very well located for a range of activities.

It has a fantastic outdoor pool, hugely popular with families. The views from the pool look out across the sea. Nearby is a pool area bar and sun loungers.

The hotel has mumerous redtaurants to suit tastes and high spenders but there is a missed opportunity for a coffee shop where simple, quick sandwich type snacks could be quickly obtained.

The hotel shop was conveniently stocked....no worries for those running out of coffee, toiletries, beach/pool essentials. Open til 10pm and priced comparative to local businesses.

Reception staff are extremely helpful, friendly and will go out of their way to assist. They have the all important local knowledge, so don't be worried about where to go for testing etc, they can direct you nicely. For pandemic controls there are 2 close-by:  one in the local park, it is free, operates 9 to 12 and 3 to 6; the hospital one operates 9 to 6, has less queuing time, is a longer walk and costs 15¥.

Pandemic measures at the hotel were excellent, showing proof of 24/48 covid testing on the local app.

Security at night, Bell Boys during the day, always on hand to assist.

Didi taxis pull up in front of the hotel.

Rooms either view the sea or the hillside. These rooms have ensuite shower and toet, sink, bath and come with very comfortable beds, pitched at the right height so good orthopedics. Airconditioning in the room is higjly adjustable and very responsive.

Little fridge with soft drinks mini bar and 2 free bottles of water per day. Great to store fruits, yoghurts and milk. 

As a British traveller, I am used to holiday hotels and the Harman, as with a lot in Sanya, has no balcony. That is a miss because I often like to sut outdoors and read but, I was on 10th floor of 17 floors so I can understand the safety aspect of no balcony.

Views from this hotel are superb. 

Across from reception : 49ers cocktail bar, quiet, stocked well with liquors and the lovely staff make a great cocktail or mixer. Air conditioning and sublimated lighting make thus a cosy, intimate and quiet venue; there are 2 eating areas both selling Chinese foods, one seemed to cater more for Chinese staff, sold very cheap meals of excellent quality....well worth 25RMB to have a meal with the staff. It was nothing fancy, just basic tables and chairs in a food court style setting but the meals were top notch. I fully understand why this area was popular with locals and I highly recommend it. 

It will seem odd walking round the back of the shopping mall to get to the main road, but from the hotel, you can cut through the mall, also beautifully airconditioned. Attached to the mall is a supermarket selling all you need and more.

If you drink yellow tea (British teas), bring them with you. I failed to find even Liptons here and in China, Liptons is very common. No yellow tea anywhere, that I could locate. Hotel do provide the usual freebies but I had run out and for my 12 days, had to cold-turkey no tea. 

Local buses stop by the mall and you can get to the train station easily as well as Nanshan Buddhist  area...bus 55...takes less than an hour...costs about 11RMB.

Just a short walj from the Harman gets you to the gorgeous, quiet white sand beach and the tyrquoise sea with its gently lapping waves. Stop off at the Beachlover Bar for great views sat on the beach, food and drink as well as nightly entertainment.

The choice of the Harman will not disappoint. Great for singkes, romantic couples, families and a big favourite with children.

msg:Worst hotel in my 4 years in China.

I booked this hotel because I saw many great reviews at first and then it was also 5 star. However after arriving in my room, I checked more intensively and found negative reviews to what I was experiencing. I got my room and it has stains on the wall and a damp smell. I asked to changed after much deliberation they showed me another room and it has the same problem (floor 15).  I asked to be upgraded and side I would pay and they said there’s no room of the upgrade I want. The man told me all rooms have the stains because it’s seaside hotels but then I asked for my refund and they said let’s go look at 1 more room on the 7th floor. I did and it was the rook I asked for upgrade (that they said wasn’t available). It had no stains and the lady told me the wallpaper was new so actually the stains are not from seaside but because the hotel is simply old. And it shows. The new room was nice but the bottom of the wall had black marks and ceiling too. The room smelled of dampness, and the smoke from next door was coming into my room at night so at 1am I messaged trip.com for a refund and changed hotels literally 1am on my first night. Simply put, the rooms are not clean and the hotel is TERRIBLY old and moldy. When I arrived to my third room I split my drink and asked the cleaner to come help me clean, she said take the mop and do it yourself (and I literally did). There’s no English speaking staff, at all, luckily I’m fluent in Chinese. Above all the hotel is a safety hazard because damp and mold is bad fri you health and you shouldn’t be living in it. There is no vibe in this hotel and it really ruined my impression of Sanya. The staff were very helpful in trying to get me a new room and I appreciate it and their help, it’s not their fault hotel is falling apart. It should be a 3 star it’s not 5 star standard all. You will get sick if you stay here, it’s a disgusting hotel with mold and dirt and cleaners who don’t clean. I’m so sorry to say. One thing is that the front of desk staff & the butlers at the front of the door are really nice and helpful 🙏🏻 I originally booked 4 nights and left after the first day cause sleeping there was too bad and noisy and the damp smell was just too much. Thank you to the staff for helping me to refund and authorizing it without penalty. It is not their fault the hotel is old but the owner really needs to renovate it. Thank you to the hotel people for your good service but I will never stay here again and I really don’t recommend people to stay here with moldy old smells and stains and no real sea view in the sea sea view hotel. Also, tv is old + pool area is nice at least. Nothing was really open and not vibey here at all.

But the entrance are of the hotel was a bit strange, it is on the back of other buildings, not beautiful at all, dark, no nature around, just concrete fences. The gym was quite good.

msg:Harman Hotel was a good place to stay in Sanya. We stayed during covid situation but the pool and the bar remained open for the guests. It has a good view of the sea and it’s close to a mall and a convenient store where you can buy anything you might need.

The hotel offers free breakfast and they have a wide variety. Western breakfast including bacon and toasts and some omelet; Asian breakfast like rice and noodles. You can try different things every day. 

The hotel had the gym and some spa/massage as well but I didnt get the chance to use it. Our room was spacious. It had the balcony with the sea view. Although it was a bit odd that the bath tub was somehow outside the shower room, it was not so bad. 

During the covid situation, the hotel delivered our breakfast to our room and it was a lot of breakfast. I felt bad for not being able to eat all of them. The staff was nice and their service was fast. 

The hotel is about 5 mins walk to the beach. They do not have a way straight to the beach as the closest way to the beach is owned by the military. You have to go all the way to the square which is about 5 to 7 mins walk. It’s not that far really. When you reach the beach, you can just choose any spot under the palm trees and beach bum all afternoon. 

Downside: No outside food and drinks at the pool bar and they are pricey. 

Overall, once you experience higher class hotels, you will never want to downgrade. Afterall, you deserve comfort on your vacation. 

We all had a great time.

It’s very family oriented with tons of kids about so it can be noisy . The breakfast was good but they pretty much serve the same breakfast everyday so if you stay for more than 4 days , it gets annoying but there’s a maan coffee shop close by if you feel like something different. The buffet for dinner is extremely expensive so definitely eat out . The area is central and easy to travel to and from . The only downside I’d say is the room design , if you’re going to stay with a friend, there’s no privacy as you can see the toilet, shower and tub from the bedroom, the doors are just glass!

Other than that this place was excellent, even the door men are on point with help and kindness-Higly recommended!

msg:This is my second time staying at the Harman. Check in was much better this time as the FD manager could actually speak English. The rooms were clean but smelt funny especially in the first few days. My bathtub facet sprang a leak and flooded the bathroom floor. It was repaired the next day (at my request because it was already past 8:30pm), but the floor was cleaned and dried immediately. 
I love the beach buggy transfer. And all the staff do great you happily.
My biggest negative would be the breakfast. Only 3 days the breakfast was decent and a 4th day because of my complaints they cooked some bacon for me and my friends. Lumpy mash potato, cheap shitty breakfast sausages that I would normally never touch, over cooked/dried out egg, little fish with lots of bones, braised duck, occasionally potato wedges and occasionally bacon. These were the only hot foreign food options and you didn’t get them everyday- and I wouldn’t exactly call some of these foods foreign foods. They did have cereals and pastries but the pastries were soggy and one day it was inedible it was that soggy. And often the foreign food section was missing foods.

msg:Our fave hotel in Dandonghai , we’ve tried from high end to middle end. It’s not perfect but what we look for it has.  

Location: Behind the pineapple mall , so it has access to grocery store a pharmacy miniso and many other shops. It’s walking distance from the beach or u can take the trolley from the hotel.  Also , walking distance to western restaurant dolphin and Starbucks and so on.  Everything you may need it’s walking distance.  So it’s a huge win for us. 

Amenities : roof top pool over looking the water is the best feature here. Divided into 2 pools , one kid friendly and another adult one.  Changing and showers are available, and also towels.  Covered seating areas are a plus.  The kids club is available with a weeks schedule on the 5th. Floor. Two times a day they inflate the bouncy obstacle course Over all my son loves coming here. 


Food :  just don’t do it , not breakfast. Everyone I know hates it. Dinner not sure , but with options all around not sure why would one do it.  They need to improve the breakfast.  



Room :  I suggest if you stay more then 5 days get a balcony , one it allows one to hang clothing outside.  Plus enjoy the beautiful views.  Some rooms are hit or miss , due to being so close to the ocean you will see stains on walls. I don’t know why they can’t fix this. Just ask to be changed.  


Over all we love staying we have stayed at least 5 times.

msg:Pros - This hotel is centrally located.  5 minutes walk to the Dadonghai beach which has the whitest sand we've seen in Sanya.  Lots of restaurants and convenient for shopping.  Lovely rooftop pool.  Very easy going staff at the breakfast buffet. Allowed me to sit with family and have a coffee free of charge.  Served a decent mix of western/eastern foods.  Not 5 star but decent.  
Cons - Check in staff nearly refused to let us check in because one of our PCR tests didn't show up on the app.  Sleep was nearly impossible due to paper thin walls. Talking, shuffling, crying, all clearly audible through doors and walls.  Gym old and about 1/2 equipment broken.  

We booked the SeaView room and found out that Tue sea is barely visible over decrepit, filthy buildings. (See pictures taken from room balcony) When we complained they told us they couldn't upgrade as the upper floors were fully booked. They did refund our payment when we told them we would cancel.  So,  that was nice.

The room with sea view is great, even can hear waves. Breakfast wasn‘t included in our booking, but we bought it for a few times(138 rmb per one person). Breakfast is ok, you can have the omelet, cereal, fruit or something chinese (fried rice, fried noodels) or so on. The sea view swimming pool is also good 👍

Breakfast is served from 7:30 am to 1:30 pm, which is fantastic. There are plenty of options to choose from, both western and Chinese.
 
The borderless/infinity swimming pool is also pretty good; I, personally, would like it to be a bit deeper. The visitors can use the towels for free and help themselves with complimentary tea. 

There is a bar next to the swimming pool with cheap drinks, although the assortment of food is not that vast.

We were traveling with our daughter and the content that Harman hotel offers is very child friendly - from shallow pool with slides and sprinklers (that often don't work though) to very nice children indoor playgrounds (there are 3) with ball pits, trampolines and even a huge bouncy castle/obstacle course. Food is good and there is a big variety of Chinese and western food. Hotel also offers a ride to and from the beach.

The hotel could invest in getting the pool heated as the water is freezing (given that it's winter). A heated pool would have been great since most of Dadonghai is currently closed  and the small patch of beach that is open is over crowded.

We were on the 6th floor so our view from our room was slightly obstructed by a run down apartment building which meant we didn’t have much of an ocean view but the pool made up for this. The room itself was beautiful but clearly a little bit damp with some marks on the wall from rusting and a damp smell. It didn’t bother us too much though and we loved the big bath tub and free mini-bar. Overall, we would definitely stay here again.

msg:The positive is location to the beach which was about a few minutes and a quick fix for western food if needed.  The pool was nice and not many people in it during the am on a weekday.  The breakfast catered to all “breakfast needs” whether Chinese or foreigner.  The negative was the elevator is slow.  After check in it took us about a 10 minute wait to go to the 13th floor and it was slow throughout the visit.  The big negative (and I would’ve complained to the front desk but we were only staying one night and arrived back later) was the smell in the room. We have a small child and the room smelled like a paint varnish scent. Very potent smell which kinda kept me awake. The rooms are dated for sure and there were stains on the wall by the television which can easily be fixed if some attention was put into the decoration however the bed was okay in comfort. We paid about 700 for the room.  I probably wouldn’t pay 1200 for it as I see it advertised regularly.  The biggest portion of the price is Mersey on the pool, kids area and breakfast which are all of good standard.  Again, the room itself for us was the set back.  Saying that, if you are not spending a great deal of time in the room then this hotel is good and you can get by on a rainy day with kids.  As we have a child though, we do like that extra comfort in the room itself and the pleasing environment of lazing around sometimes, and that’s where the hotel itself may have to invest In.  The photos show how little things can make a big difference.  Pardon me for not showing the great photos of the pool and restaurant as I had family members in them however as mentioned, that was very suffice including the gym.

The first room my husband and I were assigned had a strong smell of cigarette smoke (not the hotel's fault, some previous guest must have ignored the many signs in Mandarin and English saying no smoking) and they changed our room no problem. Whenever we called with a request the staff  arrived promptly and graciously.  Definitely book a room with breakfast included, many delicious Chinese and Western options with a beautiful view and the best part-it goes until 13:30! A real game changer for lazy beach vacationers😅 The rooftop pool is beautiful, you can look out at the sea as you swim and sit and sun bathe when finished.  The nearby beach has lounge chairs and umbrellas just for the hotel guests use--only complaint there is just as you want to start heading out to the beach when the sun is not so hot the man in charge of unlocking the chairs for you has 下班😂 I was also a little disappointed the pictures of the room I booked show a bathtub but in the three rooms we saw during our stay, none had a bathtub. It's not the end of the world but the tub was part of the reason I choose the room I did and I brought my bath bombs in preparation. But overall was pleased and would come back!

msg:I’ve traveled a lot, been to many countries and many hotels, both cheap and expensive, but for the first time I decided to write a review because my experience was so bad, I want to prevent other people from ruining their vacation. I was very optimistic about my trip to Sanya, and after looking at different options decided to stay in Harman Hotel, because the promotional photos looked nice and the reviews were great, also the price seemed reasonable. Well, it turned out staying there was a huge mistake. From the moment of check in, things started looking pretty dull. The staff at the reception desk didn’t speak a word of English, which is really embarrassing, more than that, only after my suggestion they unwillingly decided to use the translation app on their phone, and did so with the most miserable look upon their faces as if I owed them money. I booked a sea view room specifically with one bed, but upon arrival I was “told” that they only have rooms with two single beds. Once I entered the room, I felt a very unpleasant dusty smell as if I walked into a crypt. The room was clean, but everything was just so old and ragged. There were multiple stains on the walls, many surfaces were abraded. It is clear that the renovation hasn’t been done in ages. The view of the sea also wasn’t spectacular because prior to the sea, you can see dirty roofs of the local slums. The infinity pool was nice for taking photos, but wasn’t suited for swimming, because it’s basically a puddle where the water level only reaches your belly. As far as the location of the hotel goes, also nothing good. There’s a huge pineapple mall right next to it, so it’s always very noisy and crowded. Makes you feel like you’re at a flee market in a third world country. The hotel doesn’t have a private beach and the public beach is located within a 10 minute walk. The beach is very nice, but then again, it’s a public beach, so this hotel has nothing to do with it. And that’s very fortunate because I have a feeling that if that beach belonged to harman hotel, it would be majorly messed up too. The breakfast was mediocre at best, mostly Chinese dishes, and pretty poorly cooked too. Also the hotel doesn’t provide the services they claim to provide. Such as in the guide book in the room it was noted that there’s a currency exchange service available at front desk. Well, of course it turned out that it’s not available and that they have never heard of it. Also, despite leaving the “clean the room” sign on the door in the morning, the cleaning lady only comes to clean at a time comfortable for her, usually around 3 or 4 o’clock in the afternoon. Also, after a couple of nights my legs started to itch severely, and that’s very peculiar as I haven’t seen any mosquitoes. My guess is, it might have been allergy to the laundry detergent that the hotel uses. And after reading reviews where people claim they had the same problem, I’m pretty sure it has something to do with the quality and cleanliness of the sheets. Also, I had persistent problems with Wi-Fi connection, one minute it worked, and the next minute it didn’t, and of course nothing could be done to fix it. Finally, when one evening I spotted a giant cockroach on the balcony, I decided it was time to pack up and leave. I really tried to find positive things about this hotel, but I just couldn’t, every day my impression was worse and worse, and so was my mood. I am very surprised to see so many good reviews on this one, because I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. Maybe if you book the cheapest option at this hotel, it could somehow be justified (although I seriously doubt it), but if you book rooms at 800+, then definitely look at other hotels, I’m sure there are many better options for this money.

The view from the room was absolutely outstanding. Location was also very convient, 5 minute walk from the beach. They have their own chairs. The only thing is that tear are wooden chairs and are very uncomfortable. Would recommend some cushion for the sun beds. Breakfast had western and Chinese options. The infinity pool is really great!

I will book at this hotel again when i visit sanya.
The only downfall was the breakfast, its not a true western breakfast. Very few western neals6. So next time i will rather book without break and go to the nearby restaurants to eat.

msg:I stayed 4 nights at Harman Hotel with my friend, we shared a room. The room size was comfortable for 2 people sharing. The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed sitting on the balcony in the evenings with the beautiful sea view. Our room was close to the elevator so we could hear everyone walking past talking loudly with slamming doors. The hotel is well located a few minutes walk from the beach with a shopping center under the hotel. The breakfast buffet was very busy and had to wait for tables to be cleared. The selection of food is mostly Chinese, very few Western options. The most frustrating part of breakfast were the coffee machines. You only get a very small cup that doesn't fill up all the way and after 2 gulps when you're ready for the 2nd cup you have to wait in line for the slow machine or wait for staff to refill water, coffee beans or empty out the ground coffee. When we arrived at the hotel we weren't even greeted by the staff at the check in counter. The swimming pool overlooking the ocean was really nice.

It is very close to Dadonghai and Dapineapple, and it is very convenient to play in the sea, shop and eat. Dadonghai is very suitable for babies to play. Later, we went to Yalong Bay for a few days. The waves and winds in Yalong Bay are big, and I think Dadonghai is more suitable for us. The hotel is a bit humid, but it’s because of the seaside. I asked them to change the sheets and it was much better. It didn’t affect the experience at all. The baby wanted to go downstairs to swim every day. The swimming pool is also good. The baby has enough fun, and the bath towels and swimming rings are free. I will choose Harman next time.

On the first 4 floors there is a shopping center, many shops and cafes. The beach is 5 minutes, clean, there are sun loungers. The breakfasts are excellent until 13.30. Those who didn't have time for breakfast come for lunch. The years take their toll, but they take care of the building. Perfect for a family holiday with children.

msg:I recommended my friend's parents to stay here, but the experience was not good because it was their first time visiting Sanya. They recommended staying at Harman, but they felt they were being treated differently.
Service: The girl who checked in at the front desk was not familiar with the business and wanted to help arrange a room on a high floor. She kept saying that the highest room type she could book was the 7th floor. Later she asked a girl next to her and she agreed to help arrange a room on a higher floor. Floor 🙄

Facilities: On the night of check-in, I wanted to let my parents watch TV for a while, but the remote control could not turn on the TV. Later, I found that there was no cover on the battery of the remote control, and the battery inside was still deformed. I don’t know how long it had been broken. Call me. At the front desk, the front desk colleagues were speechless, saying that they arranged for the service desk to perform repairs after guests reported any problems. Is this a five-star standard? Is it possible that after cleaning the room every day, the floor supervisor doesn't check the room? Do you have to ask the guests to help you find engineering problems, and then you arrange for colleagues from the engineering department to repair them? It's outrageous, okay...

msg:Located near Dadonghai. Quite a surprise. First of all, the price we booked was super cheap, probably because it was off-season, you definitely can't book this price in Shanghai. Secondly, the hotel environment and service can be rated as four or five stars, and there is also a similar infinity pool and water slide, Xiaobao loves to play. And there are swimming rings, no need to bring. There is also a graffiti room and a children's playground, which closes at about nine o'clock in the evening. We booked a breakfast package, which tasted good and had a lot of variety. Breakfast was until 1:30! Someone cleaned every day. There was also a clothesline. The room was very clean. There were many Russian guests in this hotel, I don't know why.
It's very close to Dadonghai Beach🏖️, just a five or six minute walk. We lived on the 17th floor and checked the tide table. It happened that the recent active flood ebb tide was at five or six o'clock in the evening. Looking down from the window, there was a mudflat exposed, so we went to catch the sea. There are tools for catching the sea on the roadside, which are a bit expensive. The same is more than 20 yuan, and with clamps and so on, it's more than 60 yuan. It's nice to enjoy the sea breeze and the beach at night, and then go back to the hotel at a leisurely pace~
(ps: There is a slightly fat front desk lady whose service attitude is not very good and impatient. It is recommended that she be retrained. The service of others is quite good)

msg:Xiaohongshu said it was cost-effective, but it turned out to be a piece of ****. We initially booked a king-size bed room without a balcony, which was relatively cheap. The front desk upgraded us to a room with a balcony. We thought the hotel was pretty good. There was a bit of musty smell when we first entered, but it was acceptable so I stayed there for one night. The quilt was a bit damp and made it uncomfortable to sleep. We were woken up by the musty smell early the next morning, and we didn't bother to open the windows to ventilate the day. We went out to play during the day, but when we came back at night, the musty smell was still so strong that we couldn't stay there for a second, so we asked the front desk to help us. I upgraded to a harbor room without a balcony, but the musty smell was still terrible. I went to the front desk to add money to upgrade to a deluxe sea view for 698. After looking at two rooms, the first one still had a terrible musty smell, and the second one was barely acceptable. I settled in. I initially booked a superior room for RMB 398 a night, and upgraded to a deluxe sea view room for RMB 698. I charged RMB 660 for two nights. The front desk said that the price of a double bed room that day was RMB 368, so I upgraded based on the price difference of RMB 330 a night. I really think it’s funny. You lowered the price and I didn’t ask you to refund the price difference. You asked me to pay the price difference according to 330. I paid 398 per night. When your hotel lowered the price, I didn’t pay less. It means that I spent a lot of money. I paid 728 to stay in your deluxe sea view room for one night. Do you really think that the facilities you have are worthy of the price? The room is old and shabby, the sofa cover is torn, and there is a locked door connecting to the next door that cannot be opened. Was it originally a suite that was divided into two for you? The view of the luxurious sea view is also very poor. There is a very dilapidated building in front. The infinity pool is very small and dilapidated. Most of the beach chairs are occupied by foreigners in the hotel. I saw that no one put anything on the beach chair. Immediately there was a foreigner. The aunt came over and pointed at our things and spoke in Russian, asking us to take them away. It seemed like the beach chair had her name written on it. She was very unqualified. There were many foreigners in the hotel. Did she pick up a cheap tour group from abroad?

msg:We booked a sea view room with a flight and hotel package. We arrived late because our flight was delayed. The room the front desk gave us was good, but the service attitude was so-so. There were two service desks in total. One service desk was empty and the other team didn't take the initiative to go over. We asked once if we could go to the other service desk to handle it, but the staff ignored us and answered only after we asked a second time. The room does have a first-line sea view, but the sanitary conditions are quite average, because the bathroom and toilet are in the same space. After taking a shower and my family went to the toilet, there was a smell and humidity, which was very humid. There was a lot of mold in the shower room, which looked a bit dirty, and we didn't dare to use the bathtub. The air conditioner will automatically turn off when the balcony door is opened for ventilation. At first we thought the air conditioner was broken, and the air conditioner restarted after closing the balcony door for a while.
The advantage is that there are many restaurants around, the view of the swimming pool and the balcony is beautiful, and the breakfast is very good, and you can eat while watching the sea view. Counting the room price, I think it is super value. Anyway, it is definitely better than the popular homestays on the Internet. It is more recommended for students and staying for one night just after getting off the plane on the first day. It is really amazing to take pictures in the morning. It is not recommended for families.

msg:Harman was really the most satisfying part of this trip. I was given a room upgrade for both stays, and the service was super good. Everyone was smiling and gentle. The room service is also very timely, the brunch is rich and delicious, and the restaurant has a good view. It is also very close to Dadonghai Beach. Downstairs is the Big Pineapple Mall, which is convenient for shopping and eating. The overall value for money is good. The guy at the front desk forgot to ask his name on the first day, and he was really nice. The next time I checked in, the girl at the front desk, Zhang Jingrong, was also super gentle, and the cleaning lady in the guest room, Yang Shaoxiao, was also super nice and worked very seriously.

msg:The hotel is located behind the Big Pineapple Shopping Mall. It has a good location, especially for people like me who don't like to make trouble. It is very convenient and close to eating, drinking and playing. If you are willing to make trouble, there are free shuttle buses to the duty-free shop and Nanshan Temple. The front desk Xiao Xu is very good and patient. The hotel's entertainment facilities are basically on the fifth floor. The buffet dinner has a rich variety of dishes and the food is good. The swimming pool is more suitable for taking photos and checking in. The lady at the front desk told me that Luhuitou is suitable for watching the night view at night, but I don't want to move 🙈, so I can watch it from the balcony of the room. Overall, it is very cost-effective.

The lady at the front desk was very welcoming when we checked in and upgraded our room. I have to say that this hotel is very cost-effective. There are many foreigners staying there. The hotel's swimming pool is great and the scenery is also very good. It also provides free photography services. I was lucky enough to experience it. In addition, the hotel's buffet breakfast is good. The lady said that there is Western food in it. It was the best she had ever tasted. Thank you for the experience and service provided by the hotel. I will stay here again next time!

msg:I took my children to Sanya and stayed at Harman. I think the overall quality is good. I am from the north. It was indeed a bit humid when I went in May. The hotel is very close to the seaside. If you take your children for a walk, you can go there. It takes three to five minutes and breakfast is served. It’s really a bargain. There are a lot of foreigners. The hotel’s hygiene is relatively good, but the watermarks on the bathroom and shower doors are relatively large. I personally recommend that Didi is dozens of times cheaper than the rental company, but I didn’t realize it until I arrived at the airport. come over. Overall satisfied. My children are particularly satisfied. I will probably stay there again next time. The price/performance ratio is very good.

msg:As an internet celebrity, there is no need to say that the swimming pool is very beautiful.

Facilities: The facilities are very old and there is a musty smell when you open the door.
Hygiene: The hotel is still very clean, but the bedding is obviously very damp.
Environment: The Big Pineapple is upstairs. If you don’t like noisy, it is recommended not to choose it.
In the business district, there are many shopping places around, and the snack street is a bit dirty. There is an unspeakable smell as soon as you enter. The most important thing to consider is the distance to the seaside. It takes about seven or eight days to pass through a road with mixed traffic of people and vehicles. Minutes, it’s super hot when you walk to the beach. Although there are electric cars, you get off work at 6 o’clock. There are no deck chairs at the beach. It’s a bit far from the beach. Except for the swimming pool, there’s not much place to take the kids. Foreigners can be seen everywhere.

msg:The room on the 8th floor was arranged at first. There was a strong damp and musty smell when I opened the door. I could only see a little bit of the sea (there was a floor blocking it in front). Later, I checked the price on Ctrip and found that it was wrong (I found that the room rate dropped by more than 100 yuan on that day and the next few days). Then I went to the front desk, and the front desk said that I could cancel the order and place it again. If I felt it was troublesome, I asked to upgrade the room type. The front desk also readily agreed to change it to the 12th floor. The sea view king bed room on the 12th floor was completely ok and very comfortable. To be honest, in general, Dadonghai Harman should be the most cost-effective parent-child resort hotel. (Compared with Yalong Bay, Haitang Bay, and Sanya Bay, there are also sea views, and even if the weather is bad, this hotel can directly connect to the mall. The mall is the same as Wanda, with food, drink, entertainment and snack shops. And there is an elevator directly to the mall). The picture shows the Boluo chicken chop rice on the first floor, 18 yuan, which is not expensive, and there is also a night market with barbecue beer on the first floor. It is quite convenient overall. The breakfast is also good (and there are few breakfasts open until 1:30 in the afternoon)

Shopping is also convenient. The hotel has many parent-child activities. After checking in, I got a free upgrade to the invincible sea view. The room is also very clean, exactly like the picture. During the day, children can paint and play in the indoor children's playground. The swimming pool also has a children's slide. The seafood buffet included in the hotel package is also good. If there are any shortcomings, the only one is that there are a lot of foreign friends and there is a bit of body odor at the bathroom sink in the room😓 In other aspects, I am still very satisfied!

msg:This time I went to Sanya alone with my baby and stayed in 3 hotels, each with its own characteristics. Although I only stayed in Harman for one night, I had the best experience and the best service! What's especially great is that breakfast is until 1:30 pm. Even if you sleep until noon, you can go downstairs to have breakfast at any time. The variety is very rich and the taste is good! I would like to especially thank Fu Yunjun, the front desk clerk who helped me check in this time. I specifically asked the front desk to check her name for me when I checked out. Because I am sensitive to sound, she actively helped me change the room, so that my child and I spent a very happy day in Harman this time. The hotel's swimming pool is also closed until 10:30 pm. It only takes a few minutes to walk to Dadonghai Beach Bathing Beach. There is a car every half an hour to send it there. You can call at any time to pick it up. The hotel uses room cards on every floor. There is a shopping mall downstairs, with Luckin McDonald's and Food City. I have recommended Harman Hotel to many of my friends. Next time, I will definitely stay for a few more nights. It is really cost-effective! Highly recommended! Thank you Fu Yunjun at the front desk, and the little brother at the swimming pool is also very enthusiastic!

msg:The hotel is located in Dadonghai, which I like. It has convenient transportation and is adjacent to Harbor City No. 1 for shopping. There are many Russian guests.
The hotel facilities are relatively complete, including gym, travel photography, all on the top floor, infinity pool, terrace restaurant, and breakfast is open until 13:30, which is very relaxed. The kitchen chef is very nice, and the children like the children's playground.
Hotel service, when the number of guests is almost full, Jingjing and Chunliang at the front desk will pay attention to the needs of travelers and provide baby beds. I can't stand the noise of the fan outside the room, so they changed my room, upgraded us and delayed check-out. I like it again.
But‼ ‼ The room service must be bad‼ ‼
1 is that there are huge safety hazards in the placement of bedside tables! ! ! The double bed room in the deluxe sea view room has a large gap between the bedside tables and the bed on both sides. Most of the hotel furniture is thin and sharp at right angles, which is a big safety hazard. Our two-year-old child bumped into the bed in the middle of the night, and his teeth hit the edge of the bedside table, causing two teeth to be penetrated. The child cried in pain, and the mother was in pain.
2. The hotel did not take action after the accident! ! ! As a foreign tourist, I called the hotel for help as soon as possible. After a long time, the hotel sent iodine and left. . . Sanya People's Hospital did not dare to take it. The Chinese Medicine Hospital recommended going to a cooperative beauty institution. It was transferred to Haitang Bay to Haizong before the disease was cured. This incident is also the biggest pain point of our wonderful holiday.
The hotel has many advantages, but I sincerely hope that you will pay attention to safety issues, carefully place furniture, and remind children and the elderly. I hope the hotel will get better and better! Don't do good things for small things!

There are no lounge chairs on the public beach. 2. The twin beds bought by Ctrip cannot be changed to a big bed, and the child cannot be put together, let alone upgraded. The front desk has an indifferent attitude as if it has nothing to do with him. 3. It is indeed close to the Big Pineapple. The roof of the Big Pineapple is under the window. There are several huge central air-conditioning units, which are very noisy. The window cannot be opened at all. Don't call it a resort hotel under this condition. 4. The swimming pool is small, and the water in the infinity pool is not put in place. It is similar to the bathing pool in the bathing center. 5. There are more neighbors in the north, which feels like 1/3 of them, which is not a disadvantage. The only good comment is for the cleaning lady, who is serious about her work and has a good attitude.

Swimming rings, water guns and boats can be used for free, as well as sand dredging tools and sea-hunting tools. Due to time reasons, we were unable to swim in the pool, so naturally there were no beautiful photos of the pool, but the scenery was beautiful. The room is large, there are lounge chairs on the balcony, and drinks in the minibar. Xiaodou said that he likes the balcony very much, and it is very comfortable to sit on the balcony and daydream when he comes back at night. In addition, the small packaging bags of shower gel and shampoo are very cute and smell pretty good. The hotel has many parent-child activities, but I didn't participate because of time. The overall location of the hotel is quiet in the bustling city. It is very close to the beach, very prosperous at night, and convenient to the First Market. It is also convenient to shop at the Big Pineapple Shopping Mall next to it. By the way, breakfast is also very good from 7:00 to 13:00, with many categories, especially desserts that children also like, and the dining time is also very humane. In addition, the front desk lady is very sweet and gentle. Special thanks to Miss Wang Siyu, who is patient and cute, speaks softly, and patiently solves any problems during the process, allowing us to save time to go out and play. Thank you ~ I hope to see you again if I have the chance. I also attach a picture of the scum, the sea at 4 a.m., and a quick glance at the empty lobby ~ Best wishes

msg:For a family, the hotel in Dadonghai is still the most convenient. The overall feeling of Harman Hotel is still very good. The breakfast is very good. If you are not afraid of the heat, you can sit outside and enjoy the sea view while eating. The hygiene is also good. The waiter will spray alcohol for disinfection. The hotel's swimming ring and sand bucket can be used at will, and you can also use it when you go to the beach. On the last day of staying at Crowne Plaza Sanya Bay, you have to rent a swimming ring. In short, you have to experience everything yourself. Harman gave our family a good feeling. The children all said that they would stay at Harman again when they go to Sanya next time.

It smells a bit musty when you first check in, but it's okay later. I don't know if you're used to it. Haha. In terms of service quality, the hotel also does a great job. The staff is warm and friendly, and patiently solves my problems, especially the front desk reception, who is professional and careful. Secondly, I like the lifeguard by the pool, who is very responsible. You can take beautiful photos by the pool. There are also many types of breakfast in the hotel. The children's activities are posted on the wall. I experienced sand painting and bubble battles. I especially like Zheng Shijing, who is very serious and responsible and brought a very novel face painting experience to the children. In general, this hotel accommodation experience is very good. Whether it is the comfort of the room, the quality of service, the facilities and the quality of catering, it has left a deep impression on me. Next time I travel, I will choose this hotel again.

msg:Location: The first stop is the Harman Hotel in Dadonghai, which is close to the Dapineapple business district. Things are easy to buy, but the prices in the mall have indeed risen a lot.

The entrance of the Harman Hotel is very luxurious, but there is a strong perfume, probably because there are too many Russians coming here. More than half of the people who went to the swimming pool were foreigners.

Hotel room: The room is very large, more than 40 square meters, with twin beds, just one bed for me and my baby. I thought it was a waste at first, but later I didn't think it was a waste at all.

Hygiene: It was very clean when I slept at night, but I didn't feel unclean.

Toiletries: The shampoo with the scent of white gardenia smells good. This one is a must-try.

Hotel entertainment: The infinity pool in the hotel is so fun, one is about 0.8 meters, the other is 1.4 meters, there are water slides, cruise ships, swimming rings, water rings, and you can see the beach of Dadonghai under the pool. It's so beautiful, this is great. Children can play all day. Before leaving, the child said, "I haven't played enough, but I'm very happy."

Hotel breakfast: rich variety, including Western toast, cake, Chinese noodles, fruit juice salad, everything, the overall taste is average. The chef's skills could be better.

Disadvantages:

1. There is no balcony to dry clothes, so the clothes can't dry, so you can only go to dry cleaning.

2. It's a bit noisy at night, even with the windows closed.

3. The perfume smell is too strong

Summary: Overall, it is a hotel with very good recreational facilities. If it is improved, it will still be the hotel I choose.

Although the facilities are no longer new, they are still in good condition. The internal structure of the building is reasonable, the garden is beautifully maintained, and the price-performance ratio is excellent! There is no musty smell, and the sheets and bedding are dry. The hotel is conveniently located, and dregs vinegar, coconut chicken, and various Hainan specialties are within walking distance. Swimming pool, sea view, online service, good management and human touch, very suitable for parents and children, five-star praise, a hotel that will come back again!

The buffet is really unparalleled and comfortable. There are many dishes and good taste. Just these two points. I will stay at Harman next time. The waiter has a good attitude and the 180-degree sea view is also great🉑

It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the beach. The hotel's breakfast and service are very good. There are a variety of Chinese and Western breakfasts. The ingredients are very fresh. I especially like the original watermelon juice of the hotel. It is very convenient to eat and shop near the hotel. The Big Pineapple Supermarket is next door. There are McDonald's and coffee. It is also convenient to Sanya High-speed Railway Station. It costs about 20 yuan to take a taxi. I will choose this hotel again when I come to Sanya next time. One more thing to add, the hotel's swimming pool is super good, facing the sea, and the sight is seamless.

msg:This time I took my parents and children to Sanya. Considering my parents’ living and entertainment habits and my own budget, I chose Dadonghai, a place with a strong sense of life. Dadonghai looked around and found that Harman offered a two-night stay with a buffet included. He chose Harman without hesitation. The day before check-in, the hotel staff called me to ask if I had any needs. I mentioned trying to arrange a room with a higher floor and a bed surround. The floor was arranged on the 10th floor. When we arrived at the hotel, only one room had been cleaned. We, a group of 6, 1 and 1, went to this room to put our luggage and the cleaning staff Seeing us coming, he immediately took the initiative to help us put the two beds together, stuffed a bath towel in the middle seam, and installed the bed surround. The goodwill is doubled. Breakfast lasts until 1 pm. Both buffet dinner and breakfast can be eaten on the restaurant terrace. It is so pleasant to enjoy the sea breeze. The children's paradise can fully meet the needs of 3-year-old children. Perhaps because of the off-season, we are almost fully booked. This is my first time living in this area, and I feel it is really convenient. There are all kinds of snacks in shopping malls, supermarkets and convenience stores. It doesn’t feel like a vacation, but with parents and children, the swimming pool and beach are enough. Very cost-effective, highly recommended.

The price-performance ratio is really high, the breakfast is also great, and it's very convenient for eating and shopping. The most inconvenient thing is that it is a bit troublesome to go to the beach.
Miss Shi Wen from the parent-child activity depar**ent is very popular with children and takes the initiative to arrange activities. She is so cute. Participating in challenging activities will also give you eggs that can be used to dig small dinosaurs. The children cherished the small dinosaurs for a long time.

Even if the hotel is full, there will be no queues for dining. The ladies who were responsible for cleaning the room were cordial and enthusiastic. They chatted with the two elder sisters Zhao Xuezhen and Wu Meixia for a while, which perfectly interpreted the feeling of being at home. The upgraded invincible sea view room allows you to lie on the bed and watch the ebb and flow of the sea. Enjoy the most beautiful sunset (I have difficulty getting up early)... Opposite the hotel door is the Hainanese restaurant along the river.

The swimming pool is a major selling point. It can be said that there is nothing to fault. The only regret is that it is a bit far from the seaside and you have to bypass the South China Hotel and need to walk. About 6 minutes. Next time I come to Dadonghai, I will choose Harman.

After staying for two days, the dishes are updated every day, which is good. The outdoor swimming pool is beautiful for taking pictures, and it’s not far to walk to the beach.

It's especially lively at night during the Chinese New Year. However, parking is not convenient. There are cars all over the entrance and exit paths, and there are also parking in the underground garage. It's full, maybe it's a parking lot shared with the mall. Very close to the beach, just a few minutes walk. The swimming pool is nice, but the weather was too cold so I didn't try it.

I didn’t go to the infinity pool to play during the few days I stayed there to cool down. I wanted to open the spare quilt in the cabinet and use it. When I opened it, I saw blood stains. I contacted the work. The staff took it away and changed it to another bed. The baby broke a glass for brushing his teeth and said he needed to pay 11 yuan, but he didn't ask for it when he left. This is my second time to stay at Harman. I will stay there again next time I go to Sanya.

msg:A family of five traveled to Hainan this year with my wife to celebrate the Chinese New Year. For these two days, they chose the Harman Hotel in the Dadonghai Business District. There is a shopping mall in the hotel. Big Pineapple shopping is really convenient. The doorman helped me carry my luggage when I got off the car. The lady is not tall and explains the high-quality service very clearly. I like the arrangement on the 16th floor. I didn’t feel the bathroom smell as mentioned online. The layout of the room is indeed a bit anti-human. It seems that the room is not clean and messy. The room service has a smile and greets you. The room is tidied every day. You can also have freshly squeezed juice for breakfast and dinner. Watching the sea on the balcony is very good. You can also go to the sea in the morning.

msg:Room: A long-established family hotel with outdated facilities. The floor and walls are already mottled, but the cleaning is relatively clean and the service is relatively good. The supporting facilities inside are relatively complete, including an indoor children's amusement park (but relatively small), Art studio, outdoor swimming pool, water slide, etc.
Location: Located in Dadonghai, the city center, a 5-minute walk to the beach. The hotel also has a shuttle bus to the beach, which leaves every half an hour. The next day we went to the nearby Xiaodonghai to catch the sea. We booked it at the hotel. The price was not expensive and I thought it was worth it.
Catering: There is a restaurant in front of the hotel, which seems to be quite famous. Wenchang chicken, Hainan chicken rice, etc. are quite authentic; there is also a shopping mall with snacks opposite, and there is a strong smell wafting out, which I don’t like. I like this smell, but the smell is unpleasant; on the right is the Big Pineapple Shopping Mall, which is probably okay in the city center, but it's still a bit low when you walk in.
Summary: It is recommended that hotels near Haitang Bay are more suitable for first time visitors to Sanya. Yate Water World, Aquarium, Duty Free City, Wuzhizhou Island, etc. are all in Haitang Bay. It takes an hour by taxi from Harman. Moreover, Harman is not close to the airport. It takes 45 minutes without traffic jams. It only takes a little more than an hour from Haitang Bay to the airport.

After entering the room, the toilet smelled like a public toilet. I contacted the front desk to clean it and then went for a swim. When I came back, there was a cleaning smell like toilet cleaning. It seemed that I wanted to use toilet cleaning spirit to cover the toilet smell! It was really disgusting, and then I wanted to let go of the smell. I went out with the balcony door open and when I came back at night, there was a musty smell in the house. The musty smell plus the smell of the toilet made my husband and I feel like we were going to collapse. My husband is already a little allergic. I kept coughing due to the smell, so I couldn't contact the front desk to change the room to a double bed room.
But the kids loved the hotel swimming pool.

The hotel is in a great location, very close to the beach. The sea view room has a balcony. It is very suitable to drink coffee and enjoy the sea breeze on the balcony. However, the music in the bar on the beach at night is too loud and a bit noisy.
Breakfast and lunch in the hotel can be served until 1:30 pm, which is also very good and suitable for those of us who get up late. The buffet has a wide variety of dishes, so even two picky eaters can find something to eat.
The hotel's children's play center is also great. The children played in the inflatable castle, painted, and participated in a bubble show in the swimming pool.
I stayed at Harman for 5 nights during this trip. Overall, I was very satisfied, except that the shower facilities in the hotel room were a bit old.

msg:Overall it's OK, but the location of the room we were given was not good. The floor-to-ceiling windows looked out a bit and the view was a bit unpleasant. It was on the roof of the Big Pineapple Mall. You could see a bit of sea view from a distance. In addition, our room was very close to the mall's fan. It was very special if we wanted to sleep with the window open. It was noisy, so I had to close all the windows tightly.
The interior space of the room is okay, but the washing area is not separated from the room and is semi-open. It is really inconvenient to take a bath and change clothes with the child.
The location of the hotel is convenient for traveling. Downstairs is the Big Pineapple Shopping Mall, which also has a lively night market with snacks. It takes about 8 minutes to walk to the beach, or you can also go there by the hotel shuttle bus.
The rooftop swimming pool is quite beautiful. You can take pictures and look at the sea. The buffet tastes popular and the food is rich. If you choose the breakfast location well, you can also see the sea view.
There is a children's playground on the 5th floor of the hotel where you can play for free, which is pretty good.

The bed linen was not changed in 6 days, the duvet cover had a hole, they didn’t even change it. They left chocolates for cleaning every day, but still the bed sheets were not changed, the towels were old and torn. They made a note when booking that there would be a birthday, but didn’t congratulate us at all. When checking in, they didn’t tell us where everything was, what time breakfast was, where the restaurant was, nothing, we had to look for everything ourselves.

I took my parents to go shopping and eat nearby, so I stayed there for one night, but the result was very bad! It was a bit late on the day of check-in, and I was completely shocked when I arrived at the hotel lobby. It felt like a reception center dedicated to receiving tour groups. . It was very chaotic when checking in, and I was speechless while waiting for the elevator. I waited for a long time and couldn't get up. It was such a mess that all the guests staying there were very low and terrible. . .
When we got to the room, the humidity hit our face. It didn't face the sea, but it was extremely damp. Because it was too late, we didn't bother taking my parents with us, so we made do with one night. The layout of the room is very strange. There are large mirrors all over the entrance, the sink is very small, and the cabinet door is very simple and tattered. The quilt felt semi-wet, and there was a lot of humidity. I didn’t even change my pajamas. I slept in long clothes and long trousers for just one night, but it was scary to run away the next day. . . Lightning protection! !

The breakfast on the 5th floor is great, with a rich variety, and I enjoy eating it every day.
The afternoon tea on the 18th floor had high expectations at first, but after going there, I felt it was average and the snacks were cold. This aspect could be improved and enriched.
The 5th floor also leads to the outdoor swimming pool, which is a great experience. There are staff using a large bubble machine to make a lot of bubbles by the pool. The children like it very much and can come down to the swimming pool wearing bathrobes and swimsuits.
I had a buffet dinner on the 5th floor. It was 298 yuan per person, and children were free. It was great. There were many kinds of fresh seafood, cooked in small hot pots, and there were many skewers. It was very delicious. There were singers playing the piano and singing live on the small stage next to it. It sounds so good, I thought it was the music being played when it was turned on.
It was nice to have someone assigned to pick up and drop off the luggage from the car at the gate. They also helped put the luggage in the trunk before leaving, which was nice.
There is a large supermarket on the second floor on the right side of the hotel. It is very convenient to buy some things.
Finally, I forgot something at the hotel before I left. The staff took the initiative to contact me by phone and text message, and sent it to me by SF Express.
Overall, the hotel service is very good, including check-in at the front desk, restaurant on the 5th floor, swimming pool, telephone room service, room cleaning, luggage porter, etc., especially the hotel staff Yuli, and the staff in various positions are all very helpful to me. It left a very good impression, the service was warm and welcoming, and it can be seen that the hotel is well managed.
Last sentence, it would be better if there is free airport pick-up.
Five-star praise!

The location is next to the Big Pineapple and is convenient for eating in the city. I think it is a little far from the beach, and there is no pedestrian path to the beach, only a car path. If you have children, you have to stay in traffic.
The breakfast variety is quite rich, the quality is pretty good, and the bread feels like it could be improved. I had breakfast for two days, and the menu changed for some dishes, which was good. The coffee is freshly ground fully automatically and there is a satisfying latte.
The swimming pool is exposed to the sun, but it's okay. There are slides, swimming rings, and an infinity pool.
The hotel service is good, the attitude of the waiters is very good, and the children's playpens are very fast.
The housekeeper Wenwen was also very nice. She contacted me in advance and responded promptly.

Lin Yangyang, the staff member of the children's park area, showed off. She is very caring, has different programs every day, and is very patient with her children. The children like her very much. She chatted with other parents of children, and everyone was full of praise for this hotel, and many stayed there multiple times! Highly recommended to friends!

msg:The room is very large, the air is very circulated, and the view is very good. It is looking at the distant mountains and looking at the bay from the side. The layout is reasonable, and when traveling with children, one takes a bath, one goes to the toilet, and one removes makeup without affecting each other. The hotel is next to the Big Pineapple. It is convenient to eat. The price is basically the same as that of the city's commercial complex. There is a snack city next to it (not recommended, it is more expensive than the Big Pineapple and Dadonghai Night Market). It is very close to the seaside, and there is a shuttle bus every half an hour. The Dadonghai Night Market is not far away (different from Yishi Market Night Market, which has many small stalls, Dadonghai Night Market is equivalent to a street of food stalls, the environment is better, and the price is not bad), and there are parent-child facilities in the hotel (bouncy castle, children's playground, studio) , games, open-air swimming pool, swimming pool slides), children still prefer it, the open-air swimming pool can directly look at the sea, swimming at night, and playing in the shallow water area next to the children is very good, there are more breakfast categories, the restaurant looks at the sea, breakfast is open until 1 p.m. At half past one, you can sleep until you wake up naturally. Overall, it’s better. It would be even better to add a self-service laundry room. At present, there are only paid services. Sometimes swimsuits are really unnecessary. There is a self-service laundry room for dehydration. , In addition, it would be even better if the TV in the room can cast a screen. Overall, I am very satisfied. When it is too hot to go out during the day, the children can play in the hotel.

You can sit on a chair and drink a cup of coffee, enjoy the boundless sea, enjoy the sea breeze, and even take a look at Dadonghai Beach. Very pleasant. When you go downstairs in the morning, you can have a bowl of Baoluo noodles at the snack street opposite Shadian, and try Hainan's special vegetables, Wuzhicai.

At noon, you can visit the Big Pineapple Shopping Mall opposite the hotel. You can find everything there. If you are tired, you can try Hainan specialties at Yanjiang Hainan Restaurant. The service is very considerate and they even tell you that you can get discounts on Dianping or ** Coupons, how to use them more cost-effectively. In the afternoon, you can make a free reservation to take the shuttle bus to Dadonghai Beach to play in the water (about a 7-minute walk). The waves are a bit big, so don’t swim in the sea if you are not good at swimming. There are also quite a few things to do on the beach. Or make a free reservation to take the shuttle bus to Qianguqing to watch a wonderful show. After shopping, you can go to the nearby Hailv Duty Free Shop (about an 8-minute walk) and eat Hainan specialties like Ye Xiaodi.

The first time was three nights, but we felt it was not enough. Three days later, we stayed at the Harman Hotel for two nights. Very satisfied with all aspects of service. The front desk is very welcoming every time and tries their best to meet our needs. We sometimes swam in the morning and afternoon, and both sets of bathrobes got wet. The room attendant happily provided us with new clean bathrobes. The lifeguards at the swimming pool are also very responsible. We saw a child fall in the water with our own eyes. Two lifeguards jumped into the water almost at the same time and picked up the crying child faster than the mother not far away.

There is also enough fun in the children's playground and parent-child activities. to be honest. Houses in Haitang Bay cost several thousand. The price/performance ratio is much higher. There is also a lot of food near Dadonghai. Convenient to go anywhere.

It felt great, from the warm reception upon entering the hotel to the cleanliness of the room. Clean and tidy, especially the free flow of drinks, which is really a star-rated service at a low price. The hotel facilities are even more satisfactory. The rooms are cleaned attentively and meticulously every day. The hotel swimming pool is the highlight. It is very pleasant to swim under the stars at night. The Big Pineapple Shopping Mall near the hotel has everything you need. It is very convenient to eat, drink and buy. The Hainanese cuisine opposite the hotel is very authentic and very cost-effective. All in all, it was a great choice to stay at Harman Hotel, and I will visit again next time. PS; We extended our stay for another two days because we were very satisfied.

It is especially suitable for bringing children. There are 2 swimming pools on the 5th floor, one for children and one infinity. Free beach chairs and bath towels, as well as a small bar. It takes an elevator from the room to the swimming pool. It takes 2 minutes if you go quickly. It takes about 5 minutes to walk to the beach. Dadonghai didn't have high expectations, but the sea is really beautiful. It's beautiful. Opposite Haman is Yanjiang Food, which is particularly delicious. In short, it's so convenient and good, and the price is not expensive. I will definitely come back next time!

msg:When I decided to take my mother and children to Sanya, I did a lot of research online but couldn't decide on a hotel. ￼Later, I checked the guide on Ctrip and found that many people recommended the Harman Hotel. I read a lot of reviews at that time, and later decided to book this hotel decisively. Facts have proved that I was really right to book this hotel.
First of all, let’s talk about its location. There is a beach not far outside the Dadonghai Hotel. The sea is really beautiful, it can be regarded as a sea of ​​glass. The sand on the beach is also very fine. You can borrow followers for free to play in the sea.
Then let’s talk about the environment of the hotel. The hotel room is generally wooden-style. When I first entered, I felt a little bit of a damp smell. However, this is an unavoidable point in a hotel by the sea, but I hope that dehumidification can be done in the future. It would be nice if it was more perfect. ￼
We booked a package on Ctrip for three days and two nights, including two breakfasts for two adults and a buffet seafood dinner for two. It was really a good deal. I basically spent no money staying here. If I eat out, I highly recommend the nearby Manjie's stir-fried Qing Qing Liang, which is very delicious.
The children's center activity area in the hotel is also very large, with two indoor rooms and an outdoor inflatable. Their swimming pool is also divided into two parts. One part is a shallow pool suitable for children, and one side is an infinity pool suitable for adults. You can see the seaside from the swimming pool, and the scenery is also very beautiful￼.
In short, I think this hotel is very suitable for family travel. If I go to Dadonghai next time for family travel, I will still decide to book the Harman Hotel.

msg:Pros: The buffet dinner was great, and the service from the little brother Chen Lizhen was excellent. The location of the hotel is very convenient and the breakfast until 1:30pm is great. The swimming pool has bubble baths, hot towels, a graffiti room, and a very patient painting teacher. The staff at every location in the hotel, including the reception, front desk, swimming pool, cleaning, and room service, are all very enthusiastic and considerate. We were upgraded to a 180-degree sea view room for free.
Disadvantages: The hotel is located in a downtown area, the external environment is average, and it is a single-family building.
         There is no washing machine, so it was a bit uncomfortable to go from a store with washing machines.
         The room has a slight musty smell, the air conditioning is mediocre, there is no dehumidification function, and it is either a little hot or a little cold.
     Of course, everyone has different feelings, so my feelings are only for reference.

Because it was raining, I slept until I woke up naturally in the morning and had a buffet breakfast while watching the seaside. After breakfast, my daughter played in the children's playground. She was so happy that she didn't want to leave. The next morning, I went to the infinity pool for a swim while it wasn't raining and took some beautiful photos. My daughter also had a lot of fun at the water park. The hotel is also close to the beach, just a 7-8 minute walk. It is especially suitable for bringing children to stay. The children will not want to leave once they come.

You can take a stroll in the evening to buy fruits and gadgets, and there are also a lot of pearls for sale. You need to take a detour to go to the beach, but luckily there is a breakfast shop on the roadside, where you can have the rice noodle breakfast that Sanya locals eat every day, which is great!

The guest service manager Bian Shuai made clear arrangements. The location is also very good. It’s not far from anywhere. It’s convenient to eat and buy clothes with Big Pineapple. The hotel’s infinity pool is also beyond the square. We went at night, etc. I plan to continue taking pictures during the day tomorrow. I am very satisfied and the price/performance ratio is very good. I will come back next time.

When I entered the room, my first impression was that the room was a bit old. I don’t know whether it was the decoration style or the age of the room but the facilities were not new. ! I don’t like this very much, but the location of the sea view room is good and you can see the entire Dadonghai. It takes five minutes from the hotel to Dadonghai. What I like most is the hotel buffet restaurant! The motivation to get up early every day is to have breakfast. The variety is rich and the taste is good, which suits our taste! There is also a seafood buffet in the evening which is also very good! So for three days we had dinner at the hotel! Totally not enough! So I originally planned to stay at Harman for only two days. I felt that the price-performance ratio was good and we extended our stay for another three days. In summary, the price-performance ratio was high and the food was very good. However, the decoration of the hotel rooms was not new and needed improvement.

The hotel's swimming pool is not big, but it is enough. The sea in the Dadonghai Sea is more comfortable than expected, especially because the waves are relatively big. It is very comfortable to ride on the waves at night. There are also motorboats, umbrella holding and other activities nearby. It is not expensive. My child has played there several times. Highly recommended! ! ! The hotel's buffet dinner is also good and very cost-effective. Compared with some so-called luxury hotels in Haitang Bay, Harman is more popular with me! !

Generally speaking, the location is very good, it is convenient to go anywhere, and the facilities are relatively outdated. This is basically the problem with the hotels in Dadonghai. If you want to go to a new hotel, you have to go to Haitang Bay. The service is in place and the problem is solved in a timely manner. You can reserve a shuttle bus for the duty-free shop, and the waiting location is not far away, at the China Everbright Bank bus station on the same side as the Big Pineapple. It is very close to Dadonghai Beach, and the hotel will also use battery cars to deliver. Eating is very convenient. In addition to the super long brunch provided by the hotel (until 13:30 in the afternoon), there are also many things in the big pineapple, and there are several restaurants recommended by Internet celebrities. The hotel has a seafood buffet dinner with rich dishes, and the infinity pool and park landscape photos will be very good. If you want to lie down for a vacation, Harman Resort Hotel is a good choice in terms of cost performance. By the way, there is also a children's playground, because I didn't go there, so I don't have a picture😀😀😀😀

msg:Facilities: The layout of the room is a bit old, but compared to the price, it is still very suitable. The TV is a bit small (but almost no one watches it) and the bathtub is quite large (1.8 meters newer than the Sheraton)
Hygiene: The room is clean, and it is not bad to clean without mosquitoes after staying for two days, but there is mold in the corridor? It still smells bad, and the floor tiles in the corridor look dirty (in fact, they are yellowish-reddish, similar to the betel nut water spewed on the road in Sanya...) The swimming pool water is also quite clean.
Environment: The location is good, it is convenient to go everywhere, the Dadonghai Bathing Beach is less than ten minutes' walk. The swimming pool is an infinity swimming pool on the roof, but in fact, I prefer hotels with a large garden feel, and I only think about the buffet when I book. . The place to eat can see the sea.
Service: Check-in and check-out are quick, and everyone is very polite. Breakfast can be eaten until 1:00 p.m. (it says brunch...) The buffet in the evening is very suitable for our family, after all, prices in Sanya are so high. .
If you go to Sanya next time, it feels good to go to the sights during the day and stay in Harman at night. I will book it. If you just go to enjoy the resort, the hotel here is a bit small. .

msg:The facilities are complete. We live on the 17th floor. The view is wide and the sea is everywhere. I love it. I rarely watch TV, but I can't turn it on.
I read the reviews saying it was a bit damp. I can understand it at the seaside, so I chose Harman's. This time, I realized that the quilt always felt damp. After putting on the disposable four-piece set, the feeling of contact with the skin was much better.
The location is quite good. Eating, shopping and transportation are convenient. Dadonghai Beach is a ten-minute walk away. Eating and shopping are just downstairs. The hotel’s own swimming pool is across the garden and is the rooftop swimming pool. There are many children playing in the water. The buffet dinner at sunset is very nice.
Haha, this is the fastest procedure for staying here, no one else. Check-in and check-out are instant. The staff are very polite.
During this trip to Sanya, I wanted to stay wherever I wanted. Based on the comparison of conveniences and conditions, I recommend Harman and will be my first choice next time.

The hotel also has a sightseeing bus to pick up and drop off the beach. The room is clean and tidy. The view of the sea view is superb. The service is also very professional, especially the kind-hearted Lin Xie at the front desk The lady is very patient! It is also worth mentioning that the hotel's breakfast is until 1:30 in the afternoon, and the meals are rich, which is very suitable for sleeping in in the morning. It is a good choice for coming to Sanya!

msg:After so many days in Sanya, the most satisfying thing is Harman Hotel. First of all, the room is very clean and bright, which is really great for this price. The decoration is relatively simple and high-end. The hotel can see the blue sea. The hotel’s infinity swimming pool is very good for taking pictures and punching cards. In addition, the hotel is connected to the Big Pineapple Shopping Mall, which is very convenient for shopping and eating, and it is also very convenient to go to the beach. I will stay here again next time

msg:Regardless of the platform, I usually seldom give reviews, but Harman Hotel must seriously give a good review. Both the hotel hardware and the service attitude of the staff are superb, and the price/performance ratio is super high.
 The restaurant faces the sea, which is very beautiful, and the infinity pool on the fifth floor is even more scenic. You will be shocked the moment you open the door of the room, and you can't help but want to send a circle of friends to share with your friends.
  Thanks again to Xinxin, the customer service manager of Harman Hotel, for calling two days in advance to introduce and ask various customers for help. When you come to Sanya, you must live in Harman once, and you will never step on thunder.

msg:On the day of check-in, I upgraded to the Harbor King Room for free. Although there is no balcony, the view from the large floor-to-ceiling windows is also very good. The room is clean and hygienic. There is also a large bathtub, so children can take a bath
The 6th floor of the hotel is an infinity pool, which is divided into a shallow pool (children's pool) and a deep pool. The water quality is good. The 5th floor is a children's paradise, especially suitable for living with children.
The hotel's breakfast time is very humane, until 1:30 in the afternoon, sleep late and go straight to the restaurant for brunch, solve two meals at once, a fusion of Chinese and Western, rich in variety
The location of the hotel is also very good. It takes only 5 minutes to walk to Dadonghai Beach. There are signs on the road. The hotel also provides a beach shuttle bus. There is a free underground parking lot. It is very convenient for us to rent a car
Next to the hotel is the Big Pineapple Shopping Mall, which is very convenient for shopping. There are HEYTEA, MINISO, KKV, UR, etc. There are also a lot of local snacks. I can’t get tired of eating refreshing and refreshing. The grilled durian tastes good, as well as iron plate seafood, pineapple rice... so the location is really amazing
Let's talk about the hotel service again. I can't say it's very good, I can only say it's barely good. I just hope that it can be more enthusiastic and the service can be more timely.
The next time I have the opportunity to go to Sanya, Harman will still be in the scope of consideration. I recommend it.

   When checking in, the front desk was very warm and courteous. Children like the swimming pool very much, and the infinity pool is very popular. It's a pity that I can't go into the water to take pictures while pregnant. The breakfast is rich. Will choose here next time.

msg:This is the second time I stayed at the Harman Hotel. The first time I stayed was during the epidemic two years ago, but I was deeply impressed by this hotel, because the service and details are really good. To be honest, the price is not expensive. It makes people feel like a VIP-level service! This time I brought my children to Sanya to play. I chose a 180-degree sea view room. You can see the sea when you wake up. You can walk to the seaside and the beach in five minutes from the hotel. There are not many people taking pictures and it is very convenient. It is estimated that if you go to Yalong Bay or Wuzhizhou Island Just like making dumplings, I don't like an environment with too many people. Another thing that the hotel is particularly good about is the food. The room I chose has breakfast buffet and dinner buffet. The hotel can handle the meals for the day. There are many kinds and the ingredients are of good quality. It cannot be said that they are all delicious, but it is definitely better than booking. Takeaway and eating out are a hundred times better! A bowl of Lanzhou noodles in restaurants outside Sanya costs more than 20 yuan, and it is really not as delicious as Shenyang. We ordered barbecue and seafood for takeaway one day, and they were not as delicious as the hotel's buffet. It can be seen that the hotel has saved us a lot of money and trouble. ! The infinity pool on the fifth floor is clean and fun. There are many plants and Internet celebrities on the fifth floor to check in and take pictures. There is bubble time in the afternoon, and the children have a great time! There is also a naughty castle for children, free mineral water, Coke, and Sprite every day, there is a small refrigerator in the room, it is enough to play in the hotel and the beach opposite the hotel every day, make an appoin**ent and there is a free shuttle bus to the duty-free shop, happy holiday ! I like the sea in Sanya and the sky in Sanya! I will definitely come to Harman again next time, I miss the buffet here!

msg:Facilities: There are infinity swimming pools, slides, too much sun during the day, the restaurant downstairs of the swimming pool, the smell of oily smoke is too heavy, and it floats upwards. The big pineapple shopping mall is connected to the hotel, and the room needs to swipe the card to get on the elevator, which is relatively safe.
There are swimming rings for free use by the swimming pool.

Environment: Shopping is convenient, there is a supermarket in the shopping mall, there are restaurants downstairs, and there are many restaurants nearby. The sound insulation effect is poor, and you can hear clearly when you open and close the door on the opposite side. The level of a hotel with more than 600 yuan is really not good.

Service: The room phone calls to the front desk and room service cannot get through, and it takes many calls to get through. The attitude of the front desk at check-in was still very good.

Hygiene: Because the sink and the bed are connected, the water is easy to get on the bed, there is no balcony, and there is only a line on the bathtub to dry clothes. It is too inconvenient to separate the dry and wet, the clothes are not easy to dry, the floor drain is blocked, and there is water everywhere. Fortunately, the staff fixed it. The shower head still had hair from a previous guest.

The breakfast is not as good as the Xinghua Suite in Yalong Bay. There is no fresh meat, mostly grilled sausages and eggs. There is occasional duck and chicken in the hot dishes. There are too many vegetarian dishes, and the drinks are also blended with too much coloring. Breakfast can be eaten from 7 am to 1:30 noon. It takes a long time and is free for children under 8 years old. It's not worth buying breakfast alone.

The sea and desert can be seen outside the restaurant, which is not bad.

msg:2 nights booked on Ctrip. Before I went, I searched about hotel-related information for a long time, and finally chose Harman Resort Hotel. The customer service Xiaofu sent me the hotel's service information and children's activity arrangements in advance. After arriving at the hotel, I found that the environment and the convenience of life met the expectations of my family and me. The sound insulation of the hotel is not bad, and the sleeping environment is quiet. Play well during the day and sleep well at night. The hotel's breakfast is rich and delicious. I personally have a deep memory of Hainan salted powder, and I ate it for 2 consecutive mornings. Downstairs is the shopping mall, there are many snacks and restaurants, convenient and hygienic and not expensive. In addition, clothes, swimming rings, and sand-digging toy water guns are also sold. Our lunch and dinner can also be settled smoothly. Children like the hotel's swimming pool the most, and they can't wait to play 3 times a day. It is that we did not catch up with the bubble party at the pool during the 2 days of our stay. There is also a good impression of the free minibar, and the ice cola soda that is automatically refilled is too cool in summer. The room we live in does not have a balcony, but there is a clothesline, and the warm reminders of the room are full of details. If you want to go to the beach, the hotel also has a shuttle bus every half an hour. I highly recommend everyone to choose Harman Resort Hotel.

Overall, the price/performance ratio is really high. The parent-child activity area is also quite rich. My baby is three years old enough for him to play. The pool infinity pool is also beautiful. It is also relatively close to the sea, there are shopping malls below, and there are many takeaways nearby. I will consider staying here next time I come. good. A few pictures~

The hotel is near the urban area, close to the beach, and the first market. It is generally good. There is a door outside your room, and the sound insulation is very good.

msg:Before departure, I checked a lot of hotels on Ctrip, Xiaohongshu, etc., and I also had some bad reviews for Harman's. I was very nervous, and I believed that I chose Harman in the end. Final evaluation: A treasure hotel with great value for money!
Location: Dadonghai area, behind the Big Pineapple Mall, it is very convenient to go out for shopping, eating, and takeaway
Breakfast: Brunch from 7 am to 1:30 pm. We always sleep until we wake up naturally before going to eat, which almost saves lunch. The breakfast variety is quite rich, combining Chinese and Western styles, fruit juice, yogurt bread, noodles, porridge, There are fried dough sticks and pancakes with fruits, and they are replenished quickly. The restaurant has sea view seats.
Facilities: The rooms are well-equipped. Although they are a little old, they have no impact on your stay. The waiters clean them up in a timely manner. The sea view room has a wide view. The hotel has its own swimming pool, which is not very big, but it is no problem for children to play in the water, and there is also a battery car to the beach every half an hour
Service: Very good, the check-in process was very smooth, and the young lady at the front desk gave us a free upgrade to the parent-child room with sea view, very considerate. Check out was quick and easy too! The younger brothers of the concierge also helped with luggage when they came in and out. In short, I feel that the service of this hotel is very attentive.
Recommend everyone to stay

1 When you arrive at the hotel entrance, there will be staff to help you open the door, take your luggage, and push the baby stroller
2 The room is equipped with all supplies. My husband and I are most satisfied with the toothbrush 😆 Both of us have sensitive teeth and are prone to bleeding. He said the same thing to me as soon as he used it in the morning, "Yeah! This toothbrush works!"
3 I bought it with breakfast and dinner. Breakfast can be eaten at 14:00 in the afternoon. For people like me who can’t get out of bed, breakfast and Chinese food can be solved together. The dinner is very rich and the baby does not charge money
4 Accidentally soiled the sheets. When my husband went to eat at noon, he told his aunt to help change the sheets. When we came back, we found that the aunt had tidied up and cleaned the whole room.
5 The service manager of the hotel, Bian Shuai, came here to ask about accommodation. The service attitude of the hotel receptionist, the front desk, and the cleaning lady are all very good. Before coming to Sanya, I saw netizens say that Sanya’s service is a weak point. I feel that the service is very good
6 The restaurant on the fifth floor of the hotel has an infinity pool, half of which is deep water 1.2 and half of which is just enough for a one-year-old baby to stand in it. It is hot and at night, you can go to the infinity pool to play. You can go to the seaside after 6 pm. The hotel has a car to go to the beach. In fact, you can walk there It’s only 7 minutes. I went to the beach this afternoon and played for a while. I came back and called the front desk. A car came to pick us up. My husband and I praised the hotel again on the way. The hotel has a gym and two children’s playgrounds. I seem to have seen it There is still a cinema, but I don’t have time to go to see it. There is also a light bar on the fifth floor. I saw people drinking there at night.
7Maybe now is the off-season in Sanya. We booked a room and had dinner at the hotel together. My husband and I agreed that the hotel is worth the money.

There is a shuttle bus directly to the beach after nine o'clock on the hour, and it is quite convenient to walk for only fifteen minutes.

msg:I used to think that Harman was very nice. When I entered the room, I had just tidied up the room. The floor was not even dry and was just wet. I stayed there for one night and didn't say anything.
Because I had booked this hotel many times before, I thought it was good, so I went back to Sanya and booked a room for my baby and adults. I was told that there was no big bed.
A three-year-old child sleeps 1.2m per person? I was also told that I had to pay for the upgrade and I didn’t need to see the sea view.
You can change the room to a big bed for me at any time, but that's not possible... I can only pay more?
Anyway, speechless...

msg:The family came to Hainan for the first time, and found a hotel with a good price/performance ratio. The service staff was warm and considerate. The customer service manager Wang Siyu was even more impatient. He patiently helped us solve the problem throughout the whole process. It was just in time for the child's birthday, and he sent it to us thoughtfully. Surprise cake 🎂 The hotel as a whole is also very good, clean and tidy, with complete facilities, which can satisfy both adults and children for leisure and entertainment. Opposite the hotel is a shopping mall, and shopping is relatively convenient. It takes 5-10 minutes to walk to the beach. Overall, I am very satisfied. I recommend everyone to come and experience it~~~

msg:Before I left the hotel, I thought I must give this hotel a good review. It's the first time I came to Sanya, I didn't step on the thunder, and I will recommend it to my friends. After booking a flight ticket to Sanya, I kept looking at the reviews of various hotels on Ctrip, mainly looking at the bad reviews. After staying up for 2 nights, when I arrived at the hotel, I found that it was really worth it! My baby is 2 and a half years old, and there is a children's pool. It is very fun to dig sand. Maybe when the child grows up and can participate in hotel activities, he will choose an Internet celebrity parent-child hotel. Young babies have a low sense of participation, and I feel that it is not necessary to choose a hotel with more than 1,700 a night. Harman's is very cost-effective. The water depth of the children's pool is 65cm, and the baby's feet can go to the bottom, which is relatively safe. Adults can play in the infinity pool next to it, with a water depth of 1.4m. All have security guards. And the swimming pool does not get off work until 10:30 in the evening. Satisfied to swim without sun exposure. Breakfast at the hotel ends at 1:30 pm. When the plane was delayed and I arrived at the hotel later, the front desk told me to upgrade me to a parent-child room with an invincible sea view for free (probably because there are fewer tourists in the off-season), and it would be better to live with a baby. On the 18th floor, there are much fewer mosquitoes. The bed was also put together as required in the room, and the bed circumference was added. 956 yuan for 2 nights with invincible sea view and breakfast, really worth it! The staff at the front desk and room service are very nice. There is a free battery car pick-up from the hotel to the beach. I stayed for 2 nights and wanted to continue to stay, but the room was full, so let's move to West Island. One day on the plane, the moment I opened the curtains and saw the sea in the morning, the exhaustion of the body was healed.
Small tips: Coconut chicken, Hainan fried rice, pork ribs, and fried pumpkin leaves at the coastal restaurant opposite the hotel are all delicious. Don't step on thunder, and the price is reasonable. The clerk will also tell you that there are rolls on Dianping, how to buy more cost-effective. Qingbuliang takeaway is delicious, much better than the one in the snack city opposite the hotel. The takeaways I ordered were all delicious. If you can't finish eating, put it in the refrigerator in your room (don't ask me how I know)
Finally, I would like to suggest to the hotel whether a hook can be installed on the wall next to the washbasin to facilitate hanging the toiletry bag. There is a sign on the wall for hot and cold water. The one on the faucet is too small, so you can't see it unless you look carefully. I will choose this hotel again when I come to Sanya in the future.

Since there is no partition of the bathroom, the room and the bathroom are divided by the sink, and the countertop space of the sink is small.

It is very convenient to travel, play and shop around the hotel, and it is also very close to the sea. The hotel room is huge, standing on the balcony with a panoramic view of the sea. The infinity pool on the fifth floor is very eye-catching, and the photos are super beautiful. There are many kinds of breakfast, and the artistic conception of sitting in the restaurant by the window and eating breakfast looking at the sea is really indescribable. The receptionist at the front desk is very friendly and it makes people feel that living here is like coming home, so I made an appoin**ent with my family to stay at this Haman Resort Hotel next time I come to Sanya...

After arriving at the store, the little brother at the front desk saw that there were children staying and directly upgraded to a parent-child room😄 The room was very clean, and it didn’t feel as humid as the hotels I stayed in before. There was a bubble party in the children’s pool in the afternoon. The children had a great time. Especially the hotel meals
, the variety is rich and the quality is very good. The meal time from 7:00-13:30 is very friendly to children who sleep in. 🥱 A brunch will not make you hungry all day, and both Chinese and Western styles can satisfy you. Will come often in the future.

The breakfast and evening buffets are excellent, with a wide variety, especially the breakfast until 1:30. It is very friendly to people who go to bed late and wake up late. The room is clean and tidy, the bedding is comfortable, everything is satisfactory. The infinity pool is very popular, and the gym can also be used for ironing. Generally speaking, it is very worthwhile, and the food is no worse than that of a four-figure hotel, so I stayed for one night and continued to live decisively. There are many hotels around, but I still like Harman Hotel the most.
Breakfast: variety, rich, delicious, long time, suitable for travelers who sleep late
Seafood Hot Pot Buffet Dinner for Two: Very good value, all-you-can-eat seafood
In addition, it is recommended to take pictures and check in at the infinity pool on the sixth floor, which is very popular!
Facilities: very complete, as well as children's play facilities and gym
Hygiene: very clean, cleaned in time
Service: very kind and great
Ms. Wang Siyu's service is excellent, thumbs up!

The sea view room is spacious and bright, it is an open dry and wet bathroom, and the balcony is also very large, where you can eat, drink tea, watch the scenery and dry clothes;
Hotel facilities: perfect, I have visited several nearby hotels, Harman's swimming pool is the most beautiful, and there is also a special children's water park;
There is also the most critical part of staying in a hotel - service: it really does not lose to some well-known hotels in Haitang Bay. From the time of check-in, the whole process is consistent with the guest first, and the service of the manager Angela can be used as a benchmark to emulate , it’s hard not to have repeat customers👏
The cleanliness of the room is also very satisfactory. It is cleaned every day with care, and no flying insects were found in the room. It is really rare
Finally, there is another huge highlight, the breakfast is until 13:30! Sleep until you wake up naturally, go downstairs to have brunch at any time, rich and delicious, an absolute bonus!

msg:The excellent parent-child hotel in Dadonghai reviewed by the Internet really lives up to its reputation. It is located above the Big Pineapple Shopping Mall, and is also close to the Summer Depar**ent Store. It is very convenient to eat, take a taxi and shop.
There are a variety of breakfasts, and the time is until 13:30. Moms with babies don't have to rush to time, and they can eat slowly.
Although the room facilities are old, the sanitation is very good. The small refrigerator in the room has complimentary drinks, which can be refilled indefinitely.
Every staff member in the hotel can see that they are working hard to serve customers. Special thanks to Bian Shuai, the guest service manager, who specially arranged a parent-child room for us after knowing that we are repeat customers, and listened to our opinions and suggestions humbly.
In short, this hotel is very cost-effective. It is very suitable for parent-child families who choose Dadonghai as their base when they come to Sanya for the first time. If they want to show off, they can take their children to use the hotel's amusement facilities.

Although the facilities are a bit old, the service and price/performance ratio make up for the shortcomings. The service is really considerate and excellent. The little brother Xiaogang at the front desk is really gentle and responsive... The five-star hotel in Haitang Bay is expensive but the service is very average! So sometimes service and price really have nothing to do with each other... There is a big pineapple next to it, and then there is a summer depar**ent store, which meets the needs of different consumer groups. In the evening, the hotel’s buffet is also very rich. The best food is actually my big Shanghai crayfish...haha, there is no one who comes to Sanya to eat crayfish... Breakfast is also their specialty and can be eaten until one o’clock in the afternoon! Although there are a lot of people nearby, it is down-to-earth. Overall, I am really satisfied haha!

It takes a few minutes to the seaside, and the Pineapple shopping mall next door has everything you need. The hotel's buffet dinner is very good and not expensive. The infinity pool is also very big.

The swimming pool is very clean, you can see the sea view, and the photos are quite good.
The location is very good, closely connected to the Big Pineapple shopping mall, very convenient.
The service of the staff is very good. They took the initiative to upgrade the room type. The concierge will help you with your luggage when you get off the bus. It's really great.
The most admirable thing is the buffet in the evening. It’s a good deal when you book the room with extra money. The average person is over 100. The food is really satisfying. The seafood is very fresh and there are many types. The whole family is very satisfied. , the environment is good, you can see the sea view.
Breakfast is also available until 1:30 in the afternoon, and we all ate it for lunch.
Overall, the location of this hotel is good, the service is good, the food is good, and the price is very high.
The only downside is that the cleaning of the room is relatively slow, and the air conditioner has been broken for a while at night, so it is very hot. But the aunt said that it should be cleaned up for guests to check in.

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first: The front desk service and concierge service are very good. When I saw me with a baby, I was upgraded to a high-level executive parent-child room for free. Because I needed the cleaning spirit to brush the baby bottle, the front desk immediately sent a bowl and paid for the plastic wrap to avoid spilling it. It gave me a very good experience.
Let's talk about the disadvantages: the toilet in the guest room always has a smell, probably because there is no ventilation fan.
The biggest downside is that! ! ! The hotel's breakfast had boiled flies! At that time, I almost ate it. I thought it was peppercorns, but when I looked closely, there were wings! I found the person in charge to complain, and he was apologetic. He wanted to take it away and make a copy for me, but I refused.
Based on the Food Safety Regulations: If foreign objects are found in the food, the operator may be required to pay ten times the price or three times the loss; if the amount of additional compensation is less than 1,000 yuan, the compensation shall be 1,000 yuan. Producers and operators who receive compensation claims from consumers shall implement the first responsibility system, pay compensation in advance, and shall not shirk their excuses;
I didn't ask for a claim of 1,000, because I think you can get anything if you order a takeaway in the current environment, not to mention the hotel, which I can understand. So I proposed to refund the room fee for one night (478 yuan, as compensation)
The person in charge of the hotel's catering expressed the hope of a discount of 15%. I also agree. As a result, Gao Neng came: It is estimated that when the person in charge learned that we were going to check out and catch a flight immediately, he actually told me that the refund was not the 15% discount on the 475 room rate promised earlier. Instead, it was 76 yuan. The reason is that the "fold" of 8.5 is refunded. May I ask if there is such an understanding of the compensation for 15% off the room rate?
After my refusal on the spot, like squeezing toothpaste, I only hesitated and returned a total of more than 200 yuan. Said it was because he wanted to pay me himself. The hotel is not responsible for that. (Whoever loses money to me... is eating flies in your hotel, hey).
Regardless of whether the hotel will contact me in the future, video, photo, recording. I will report them all!

I used to live in Haitang District and Yalong Bay!
This is the first time I choose to live in Dadonghai!
The first is because the hotels here are cost-effective, and the second is that they are close to the airport!
Because I stayed in a hotel with more than 2,000 a night before!
I was a little worried when I ordered Harman! To be honest, I used to make plans with good friends, but this time I did it myself, so I was very afraid of staying in a bad hotel!
But overall, the experience is really pretty good!
The hotel staff are pretty good, from the doorman to the front desk, the hotel cleaning lady, and the hotel restaurant staff! All very nice and friendly!
All your questions will be answered with all my heart!
To my surprise, the breakfast provided by the hotel is much better than the expensive hotels I used to live in! I've been telling my friends about this all the time! Really okay!
The hotel's swimming pool is also good. Adults and children are separated and two swimming pools are made!
The only thing that bothers me a bit is that the room smells a bit musty, but maybe it's because of the weather!
Others are really good! recommend! ! !

msg:The hotel is located in Dadonghai, behind the big pineapple. The location is not bad, but it is not close to the beach. I went there in late March, and the waves in Dadonghai were very strong. . The shore is very messy, with loudspeakers and food stalls, it's a mess. The hotel's swimming pool is good. It is open until 23 o'clock in the evening. It is not constant temperature. It will be a little cold at night. It must be no problem during the day. Let’s talk about the room. There is a musty smell as soon as you enter the room. The sea tide is understandable, but it’s really a musty smell every time you go back to the room and open the door, which makes you a little irritated. Because you just get used to it after a while and can't smell it, but in fact you have been in a musty room all the time. Let’s talk about the elevator. The hotel has Area A and Area B. It says in the lobby that the elevator in Area A may be slow. I hurriedly detoured to take the elevator in Area B, but it turns out that the elevator in Area A is really slow, and the elevator in Area B is not. No matter how fast it is, it is very tiresome. Then let’s talk about the seafood buffet. The market price of this buffet is 298 per person. It’s really only 149 in big cities. Is it so expensive in a coastal city like Hainan? It’s really cost-effective. There’s nothing like live seafood, just ordinary shrimp, abalone, three-pointed crab and crab. The hot pot is neither electric nor gas. patience. There is nothing else to eat, the boiled dishes are not very fresh, and the breakfast the next day is still those things, it seems that the area does not replace fresh ingredients. The only thing that surprises me is the chaifei mang here, which is different from the ones I bought in Beijing. It is really sweet, and I will show off several of them at once! ! ! Green ones are delicious! ! ! Book together with the room including dinner and breakfast. The price is 900 yuan a night. To be honest, I really don’t think it’s worth the money, because people are going crazy now. Hotels in Hainan are all at a premium. In fact, it’s not worth the price at all. . I went swimming in the morning during the day, and there was no one at the place where the towels were distributed. After waiting for a long time, the child was wrapped in clothes and hurried back to the house. Finally, let’s talk about the rooms. Sea view rooms may be better on high floors. There is a very old building in front of our seventh floor, which should be a residential building, which especially affects the scenery! It's really not that good, let's not mention the sea view. The room is not separated from wet and dry. After taking a bath or something, the water is brought directly into the room, and the pool is between the bathroom and the room. It is definitely not suitable if you bring children, because it is easy to bump your head. I am afraid Wrap the hard corners directly with a towel. In short, this hotel is really average, not bad, but not good either. Anyway, I won't book here next time, it's a one-off deal.

msg:Double Seafood Hot Pot Buffet Dinner: Half a lobster for one person, tastes good
Fresh seafood can be salvaged, the dishes are not bad, and the food is full
There is a small suggestion, you can change the menu the next day, and eat exactly the same food for two days
The breakfast is different for two days. It's a bit of a surprise, and it's until 1:30.
Hygiene: We stayed for two consecutive days, and informed the front desk on the second day to clean up, and the toiletries were replaced with new ones
Shampoo and shower gel are all brands I love, the fragrance I like very much, and it’s easy to use

Service: The service here is really great. Wenwen, the customer service, added WeChat in advance, and arranged to check in as soon as she arrived. Wang Jingjing at the front desk is also very considerate. Check out is delayed until two o'clock, which is very nice

Environment: Sea view room, very comfortable, can see the sea

It is especially worth mentioning that drying clothes is very important when bringing the baby out! ! ! ! It's really great, there are enough hangers, and the clothes can be dried on the day
, very friendly for families traveling out
Will recommend to friends

msg:I stayed in three hotels in Sanya this time, and Harman is the most satisfying! The hotel is very popular. On the day of check-in, only the room next to the fan was left, which was very noisy. Give me a parent-child room. The next day, I was given a sea view room on the 15th floor. It was so wonderful to fall asleep listening to the sound of the waves! The hotel is very comfortable, next to the big pineapple, whether it is watching the sea, eating or shopping is very convenient! The 4 points are for the pool management. The hotel’s internet celebrity infinity pool is really good, attracting many guests to take pictures, so they step into the pool without swimming caps, swimsuits, or even wearing shoes. The quality is really low. ! The little brother who was in charge of the swimming pool just didn't care about it, and he was indifferent to mentioning it to him several times. The originally good swimming pool will soon be ruined if it continues to be managed like this. Hope to attract the attention of hotel managers!

There is an infinity pool, a large balcony, lying on the balcony, drinking red wine while the wind blows, and the whole person relaxes. The transportation is convenient, and it is very close to the mall supermarket. You don't need to go downstairs, just turn a corner and go into the mall. You can sleep until you wake up naturally, and then have breakfast and lunch together. The restaurant is always open from 7:00 to 1:30. The service was excellent, but my daughter-in-law was not feeling well. When I got into the elevator, a leader met me and immediately asked if I needed help from the hotel, and finally brought ginger syrup.

Children are easy to bump their heads, and it's a bit difficult for adults to wash, and they can't put too many things. I stayed in 4 hotels this time. Harman is the hotel’s fixed date, and it’s the cheapest and most cost-effective. If you want to go to a scenic spot and want to book a cheaper hotel, Harman is a good choice. The dinner package is quite a bargain. . The view on the 17th floor is very good, but it is a bit uncomfortable without a balcony.

The hotel has a swimming pool, but we didn't catch up with time, because this bay can't go down for swimming, so if you want to swim, you can choose this hotel.
As soon as the hotel service arrives at the door, someone will help you store your luggage, and you can also store valuables at the front desk. Makes me feel great.
One bad thing is that there are too few people at the front desk, or there are not enough windows at the front desk, and it is not obvious enough. When we went, there were not many people, and it felt crowded and too busy.
Duty-free shop buses need to be reserved in advance. But on the day we arrived, we wanted to go directly, but there was no place left. Later, I still took a taxi.
There is a chain of characteristic Hainan restaurants at the entrance of the hotel and in the shopping mall next to it.
We live in a twin room, we are four girls, it's okay. Check in may be late. I didn't live in a room near the sea.

Here, I would like to thank the staff at the front desk of Harman called Wang Jianwei, because this time I went to Sanya with my grandparents and two grandchildren. The old man didn’t understand the things about booking a room and paying the room fee at the store, so Wang Jianwei accepted it. I called the front desk and specifically added my WeChat, including the check-in of the elderly, paying the deposit for the room, and the addition of breakfast for the elderly. They helped me take care of the elderly and children remotely all the time, and also helped me upgrade the room type. As far away as Hangzhou, I was deeply moved by Harman Hotel and the staff of Harman Hotel Wang Jianwei. A good hotel reputation is shown to every guest by countless ordinary staff working in the hotel through their hard work, hard work and hard work. I am very satisfied, thank you Wang Jianwei, I wish you success in your work, the warmth and happiness you bring to our family is the best New Year gift in 2023!

Haha, the room was booked a few days before check-in. The price increase is acceptable in Sanya during the Spring Festival. After the trip, I stayed in a hotel with a similar price and compared it to this one. The price/performance ratio is still very high. Of course, the earlier the price is set, the more suitable it is. It is recommended that future tourists and friends do not make a temporary decision to come to Sanya to book a room in a hurry like us. Haha, I especially like to pass by during the walk from the hotel entrance to Dadonghai. The big green coconuts are sold in the small supermarket on the first floor of the community. There is a small table at the door. It was 8 yuan each when I bought it, I miss it so much! I'll drink it next time I come to live

It was said that it was one o'clock in the afternoon, and when I went to eat at eleven o'clock, the snack table was already in a mess and no one had cleaned it up. I may not consider breakfast when I go back to live next time, it's good to go out to eat.

The breakfast is undecided. I have eaten it before and feel that it is average. There are many places to eat around that you can go out to eat. The staff is very efficient. The aunt who cleans the room is kind and friendly.
It's just that the sound insulation is not good, which is a common problem in hotels. There are too many children and it is a bit noisy.
The travel photos sent are too hip. I called to make an appoin**ent to take pictures, and asked me to add WeChat, but it turned out that people didn't care about it at all. After reading the works in the circle of friends, the photos are not very good. It is better to find a reliable photographer to take pictures.

msg:The original picture is straight out, the room has a small balcony, the sun can shine in during the day, clothes can be dried, the room is not dirty, I personally think it is not as exaggerated as in the bad reviews, the breakfast is also very rich, six days and five nights, 328 yuan per night There are also two breakfasts. The downstairs is the Big Pineapple Shopping Mall and the bus stop. The hotel will arrange free nucleic acid to be done in the lobby and restaurant every other day, which is very convenient!
Disadvantages: The military camp is next to it, and I can hear the sound of military horns and drills every morning, but it doesn't affect me, because I'm almost up.

On the Dadonghai side, I feel that it is very good, the hotel is very safe, the elevator card is swiped ~ there are also free drinks in the minibar, we actually only found out on the last day of our stay! ! ! We lost a lot, can you send us a few more bottles? Hahaha, the staff are still very friendly
In particular, I want to talk about the cleaning sister of our hotel. It's great. She also gave us a disposable bath bag. Because we took a bath the day before and left garbage, he put one for us on the second day. new!
But why is there no woo woo woo in the room for the WiFi password?
In addition, you can hear the cool slogans of the soldiers every morning. Although there is a sense of security, but the sound insulation emmmmm

In order to book the hotel, I scoured the list, and only it met most of the expectations of an ordinary tourist for a seaside resort hotel: front sea view, high floor, floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony, bathtub, rich breakfast, decent lobby in the public area, no boundaries Swimming pool, gym, Thai massage, many parking spaces, elevators in the parking lot directly to the room floor, and except for the smell of dampness in the room, there are almost no anti-human thunder points, hotels under 500 yuan are invincible. More than 500 yuan to see the Yalong Bay Hilton...

Thank you for taking the initiative to help me upgrade the room type, Sunshine at the front desk, I bought the Sunshine Sea View and helped me to upgrade to the Deluxe Sea View, and I will come here next time!

After taking a bath, I can see it when I lay on the bed or sit on a chair. Older girls and boys can see Dad, Mom appeared naked in front of them. The breakfast could only be said to be average. People who said good things said that staying in chain hotels was not a resort hotel. People who said that the hotel environment was good really didn't know what to think, because the hotel has no environment at all. But it is worth saying that breakfast can be eaten for 13.30 minutes. It is too far from the airport. It takes about 60 yuan to take a taxi and it takes about 40 minutes. The only thing is that it is convenient to go to Nanshan Scenic Area. There are several direct buses to Dadonghai Square.

msg:I rarely give bad reviews to hotels on the 26th. No one at the front desk arrived at 23:00 on the 26th. After I shouted, a male waiter had a bad attitude and rude words. He seemed to be ordering others all the time. Only when I got to the room did I find out that the curtains are so intractable that the water that does not block light is only 350ml, and the hotel is too overcooked to increase the price at any time. The waiter even ridiculed me. The sun bed I originally booked was only a corner, so the balcony was already so big It has been upgraded more than N times. It is obvious that there is a large army courtyard below. It has also been upgraded many times. I'm in a very bad mood, and I don't want to live anymore, and the price is inflated. It's not worth it. Later, the manager called me to apologize. Why didn't I correct it earlier? Don't you feel passive when you wait until the client is in trouble before you speak up? Now the price of the online listing has dropped again, everyone should not go to live. It's really not good. Don't believe those good reviews.

When we arrived, we felt a sense of disparity. The surrounding environment was really not satisfactory, and the hotel customer service After communication, I was upgraded from the 6th floor to the 16th floor sea view room, and agreed to cancel the next two nights without responsibility. As far as the hotel itself is concerned, there is no problem, and the bedding service is OK. These are all five-star praise. Just to see if I prefer to live in a downtown area or a quiet place. The service is definitely 5 stars. The breakfast is also delicious, especially the cheesecake and nut cake. It’s a pity. I’m satisfied with the surrounding environment after staying for one night. Harman is a bit far from the beach, and the shuttle bus back is not available at all times. Let’s see your budget. In the end, I chose the Yalong Bay Tianyu where I live with my children. Guiye is indeed a paradise for children. Thank you Ctrip for the guest room The customer service solved my request very quickly and perfectly, satisfied

The check-in experience is very good, the front desk and room service are warm and in place, and the customer service Xiaozhuang has been contacting and reminding us on WeChat and giving praise.
The breakfast is open until 1:30 noon. The food is rich and fresh, and there is nothing to be picky about. Because it is a business trip, it can be reimbursed, so I booked a room with two breakfasts, and I can solve both breakfast and lunch here. I haven't eaten all the meals for a day, and I'm not tired of it yet.
The hotel has its own infinity swimming pool, and you can try the water at night. It's a pity that it opened too late in the morning, and it didn't open until eight o'clock. At that time, it was already very hot and it was a bit sunburned.

The location of the hotel is really good, the scenery is beautiful, the swimming pool is amazing, and the price is very high, which is better than expected. The fly in the oin**ent is that the breakfast tastes so-so, which may be related to how good it was a few days ago! ! There is also hope that the air conditioning of the hotel will be lowered a little in the future, or there will be water on the ground when you check in. . .

msg:I originally booked a hotel in Yalong Bay, but it seems that I committed a crime in Yalong Bay, and it was not very pleasant every time. This time, I was also trying to escape as soon as possible. After decisively checking out, I temporarily booked Harman in Dadonghai. It took me 1 minute to choose before and after. When I first went, I was a little worried about stepping on thunder, but I was not disappointed.
Although the hotel lobby is messy, it is still easy to find. The waiters are polite, the hygiene is good, the room is big and the decoration is also good. The infinity pool on the fifth floor is very nice. With it, the children will not go anywhere, and they are extremely happy. The next courtyard blew out the lights on time at 10 o'clock in the evening, and the children went to bed on time🙌
The most domineering thing is breakfast. The lake view buffet 7:30-13:30 is right in the afternoon. This time is really a must-have, a blessing for lazy people. At this price, I may not be able to adapt to other homes. .

msg:Overall, I was very satisfied. I stayed for five days and it reached the level of a five-star hotel. Let me break it down for you
1. The hotel is not far from the beach, but it takes ten minutes to walk there. It is a bit hot for northerners, and this road seems a bit far
2. However, there is a rooftop swimming pool on the fifth floor, but it is not an infinity pool. The environment is very good. There is also a bar, a gym, a safe for storing items and a washing area. Occasionally, people from outside the hotel come in to swim, which is not good!
3. The five free photos are by the pool. They should be outsourced. There are only five photos for several days.
4. Takeaways cannot be delivered to the floor. This is not as convenient as other hotels that have robots delivering to the floor.
5. Before checking in, I added friends for more convenient service docking. I was surprised, but the effect was not great. There were too few service functions. Whatever I asked, I didn’t know what I asked. There were no coupons for duty-free shops. The key point.
6. The difference between the Sunshine Sea View Room and the 180-degree Sea View Room is the angle facing the sea. The overall difference between the room types is not much
7. I would like to praise the staff who cleaned the room. It was really great! The cleaning was very clean, and they also picked up the clothes that I didn't have time to pack. The attitude was also very good and attentive, which was a surprise that other hotels didn't have!
8. Two things to criticize. There is only one socket next to the bed. Can it be difficult to have one on each side? Many three-star hotels can take this into consideration, but you can't. Another thing is that the sound insulation is too bad! Door! In the middle of the night, the child yelled and ran in the corridor and woke me up directly. It was so annoying! It affects sleep. Parent-child hotels are really not suitable for people who hang out in hotels to enjoy.
Finally, it is next to ****, and there is a horn on time. If you mind and need to sleep in, pay special attention! The price-performance ratio is still very good

The hotel has been around for a long time, but the rooms are still clean and tidy. The facilities are complete and the room size is suitable. It is especially commendable that the downstairs is very convenient for shopping and eating.

It costs 10 yuan to wash a pair of socks. I can buy three pairs of socks. It is estimated that a poor person like me is unworthy. Hotels that cost 100 yuan have free laundry rooms, but none of the five-star hotels. There is a massage chair in the room, but if you use it, you have to scan the code to charge it. I really took it. The massage chair in a five-star hotel room has to be charged separately. You might as well throw it out of the room for me to have more space. The advantage is that the hotel's outdoor swimming pool is not bad

msg:This time, I can seriously write a review!
From the initial one-day temporary stay to the three subsequent stays, a total of six days and five nights were spent in Harman. In fact, in terms of the area of the hotel, Harman does not have an advantage. There is only one main building (accommodation room), plus a subsidiary building (restaurant and swimming pool garden). There is no deep garden, and the lobby is not large. Continue to live again? The reason is that it has its own unique advantages here 🈶!
First of all, the service is good, which can be seen from the reception attitude at the front desk and the humanized breakfast at 1.30 in the afternoon! ! !
Secondly, the location advantage, downstairs is the entrance of the big pineapple shopping mall, opposite the lobby is the snack city, although the beach has to go to the Dadonghai public beach, it only takes a few minutes to walk there.
Third, although the area is not large, the patchwork of sky gardens and swimming pools and the exquisiteness of changing scenery are enough to make it difficult to have any complaints (after all, some hotels in Sanya occupy a large area, but the gardens and swimming pools have both Visual sense, but very poor)
Fourth, the price-performance ratio is really high, which is also in line with the hotel's own positioning.
Therefore, the stay experience this time was very good, and I will definitely come again in the future~~~

You can also see the unobstructed Great East China Sea next to the Internet celebrity swimming pool. Awesome👍

When I first arrived at the hotel, the hotel staff at the door would take the initiative to help with the luggage, and the service was very good. The cleaning sisters in the hotel are very enthusiastic and can fold a lot of cute animals. Later, the cleaning sister taught us how to fold small animals, and she taught us very patiently. Stayed for a total of 5 nights, every day will come to clean, change the toiletries, and change the sheets and quilts. Like Fu Chunhui, my sister who taught us to fold small animals~

msg:Now the off-season room price is around 250 per night with single breakfast, and Sanya consumption coupons are used up to 139 per night. Stayed for 5 days and 4 nights. There are very few reviews on Ctrip. This hotel is really cost-effective. Before booking, I read the reviews and said that there is a musty smell. I live without a balcony. At the same level as Westin Intercontinental, it is invincible upstairs in the big pineapple, and it is convenient for room service to be delivered within 10 minutes. Although the free minibar only has Coke Sprite, the aunt will take the initiative to ask you if you still need it the next day and can supply you again. The main thing I want to say is that I have breakfast until 1:30 in the afternoon. I also stayed in more than half of the hotels in Sanya. The variety of breakfast is not particularly large, but it is definitely enough and fresh. On the first day, when I ate the puff with animal cream Just sigh whether this hotel will lose money.

When you wake up lazily, you can eat breakfast facing the sea until 1:30 noon; go back to the balcony of your room and take a nap facing the sea; go to the Sky Pool in the afternoon and swim facing the sea; when night falls, face the sea again I went to the Dadonghai Beach for a walk towards the sea...

Reasons I like:
1. The room space is large enough, not cramped or depressed, and the bedding is dry and comfortable!
2. Breakfast lasts until 1:30 pm. There are many varieties (three dining areas) and high quality. Even the strawberry jam on the bread is full of big strawberries. The taste is great. The freshly ground coffee is very fragrant.
3. The indoor and outdoor dining area is very large. After eating indoors, take some fruits and drinks, so that you can blow the sea breeze outside, chat, and the scenery is very good👍
4. When checking in and leaving, there is a doorman at the door to help with luggage. The attitude is super good. The service of this price hotel package is absolutely incredible👍
5. The room type was upgraded for us when there were sufficient houses, and the demand for late check-out was met, which is very user-friendly👍

The hotel is located opposite the shopping mall, which is convenient for shopping and lively. When we arrived at the hotel in the evening, the little brother at the front desk specially helped us upgrade the upper floor, and we could still see the bay. It was not bad if we closed the window and couldn't hear the sound from outside, thank you very much! Next to the downstairs is a troop and Dadonghai. The good part of the hotel is that you can eat from 6:30-13:00, which is perfect, but the restaurant service can't keep up. The infinity pool on the 6th floor is beautiful, but it's a pity that it didn't go down.

The only regret that the hotel has an infinity swimming pool is that the weather was not good this time, and the seafood buffet for two people was close to 500 yuan for dinner at the hotel. The price is super high and they are fresh. I see that there are special children playing downstairs. I have been out for several years to escape the cold. I still think that the scenery in Sanya is very beautiful. Next time I bring my family up, I will choose your hotel. Also, I care about shopping and eating, and I am also there.

But now the beach is being renovated and upgraded, so there is only a small area to play, but the local citizens will take their children to swim 🏊‍♀️ It looks messy The room type that I booked at that time was different from the one I checked in, but it was resolved quickly. I would like to thank the lobby manager for helping me resolve it while busy and also giving me fruit very kindly! The most satisfying thing is of course the hotel's breakfast. The friends who stay in this hotel must try it. The breakfast time is from 6:00 to 13:00. It is the last hotel I have stayed in. There are many varieties and delicious 😋! It's just that I didn't eat the breakfast the next day because I had to catch an early flight. I must try it next time... There is a separate swimming pool on the 6th floor of the hotel and the seaside is very good. Sanya Bay Coconut Dream Promenade is very convenient to watch the sunrise and sunset. And 🈶️Many couples will take wedding photos there. In fact, the scenic spots are in various bays. The points are relatively scattered, Wuzhizhou Island, Houhai can live in Haitang Bay, and it is not far by taxi. Less than 40 yuan. Forest Park I recommend Yanoda Tropical Rainforest. The scenic spot that Li Xian went to was average. If shopping, you can live in Haitang Bay. There is a big duty-free shop there 🈶️, but you have to order takeaway to eat. Yalong Bay is suitable for vacation, but the hotel will be more expensive. After all, it is the peak season. Of course, I have to go to Guanyin Island. Go to the scenic spots early. It takes at least 4-5 hours to walk down, which is quite big. Although I go to Sanya every three or five times. But the sea in Houhai is amazing, the beach is so soft and comfortable. The famous hotels in Houhai look ordinary. You can live in Haitang Bay. You can go by car to play. Let's talk about this first. All in all, I will recommend this hotel to my friends 👍

5: In particular, I left the hotel and found that the earphones were left in the room. I called the hotel, but I didn't report my hope, but I quickly found it and promised to send it back to me. My goodwill doubled! ! Must give the customer service a thumbs up! 👍

It is very close to the Dadonghai Beach. The hotel battery car can be picked up for free. The hotel seems to have its own beach, but it has been closed for maintenance a few years ago. There is a big pineapple shopping mall on the downstairs of the hotel, which is convenient for shopping.
It looks like a hotel from a few years ago, but the sanitation facilities are not bad, and the room is quite big. It is that the large bed room on the lower floor is a military dormitory outside the window, which is embarrassing and can't open the window.

Breakfast lasts until 1:30 noon, which is very suitable for families like us who are lazy and procrastinate for half-day trips, those who have to sleep until they wake up naturally and then slowly go downstairs to eat breakfast. The regular hotel breakfast at 10:00 can't feed us at all! And the breakfast is very rich and varied, which is similar to the thousand-yuan hotel I have stayed in, not to mention that this one with breakfast is less than 500!
☞ All five stars! The reason, the most important point, the location is very good, downstairs is the big pineapple, it is convenient to buy and eat anything, go downstairs and turn the alley opposite to the Dadonghai Beach in a few minutes, which is equivalent to the seaside is also convenient!
☞ The swimming pool on the fifth floor is really good, but it is still a bit cold to enter the water around 26 degrees in January, especially when it is windy, there is a bubble game in the afternoon, and the little pot friends have a good time
☞The room I booked in advance turned out to be 100 cheaper than the one I booked on the day I got off the plane. The front desk asked me to cancel and rebook (for the non-cancellable room, I still negotiated to cancel the rebooking for me). ready to feel good
☞Note that you must book a room above the 8th floor and preferably above the 10th floor. Our sixth floor is just blocked by the building in front of the sea view, but fortunately it doesn't matter if you go out every day
☞The only thing is that I don’t like the layout of the bathroom. The washbasin and the boiling water are a bit messy and irregular. Then there is a washbasin between the bath and the bed. The boy and the mother, the girl and the father, not easy to cover
☞By the way, the buffet dinner of the hotel is great, and there is a separate evaluation for it

8. This hotel is really run by heart. I received a call back at 8:00 p.m. on the day of check-out. Having stayed in so many hotels, the more upscale ones have not received any phone calls back.
9. There is a big pineapple shopping mall nearby; there is a good restaurant directly opposite a zero distance; there are dried mango and coconut flakes specialties to buy at the door; it takes 2-3 minutes to walk from the beach, this beach 🏖️ is only for me. Perfect for sunbathing. Without the blue sky, white clouds and clear water, there is a lot less fun. But you can play beach volleyball, football, or learn to surf. It takes about 35 minutes by taxi to Yalong Bay and about 50 minutes to Wuzhizhou Island.

Every day I take my son to play at Dadonghai Beach, which is just a few minutes' walk away. The buffet breakfast was great, and also had a dinner that was good. The infinity pool only went to play for a while, and it looked very good. There is also a playground for children, a great choice for a family-friendly hotel. my baby is having fun

msg:Overall review: Not recommended (Room 1531, 26-28 January 2022)

Reasons:
1. Military training room: Not recommended for guests with average or lower sleep quality. Next door is the military area. The bugle starts at 5:30 every morning, then 1234 starts exercise, then military broadcasts are played, then the bugle is blown, and then unity is strength (I respect the soldiers very much. The store did not disclose this fact when I stayed in the hotel, and there is a suspicion of breach of the basic contract for accommodation). It makes it impossible to fall asleep after 5:30. No one wants to take annual leave for military training. People go on vacation. The store did not inform us of this information, because if we do, not only we will not choose you. I believe that most tourists will not choose you at all. It is very, very unkind!

2. Slow elevator: The store owner knows about this problem (the store owner also marked it on the room card and in front of the elevator on each floor). There are only two elevators in the entire building, which are very slow. People living below the 10th floor basically have no chance to stand in each time. They stop on each floor, and need to be patient to wait and accept each crowd. The question is, knowing the crowd, why not improve it but mark it on the room card for the guests to endure it?

3. Hygiene problem: There is a black washbasin at the entrance (see the picture), the toilet keeps running and cannot stop (see the video), the toilet is connected to the bathroom, and the toilet is full of water after taking a shower. 4 points for service to the cleaning lady, seeing that some children gave more water.

4: Paid massage chair, the room is the purchased use area, you put a paid massage chair that occupies half of the window area and it is very crowded in some places, which is not very understandable.

5: Swimming pool: It is relatively old, with a very obvious mottled sense of age, the water quality is not clean, there are many floating flocs, and there is no desire to go into the water again. The only infinity pool to check in was also abandoned for taking pictures. (I was deceived by the ** photos on Xiaohongshu and came here. I really don’t recommend it.)

We are frequent travelers and just came from Junlan Hotel, which is of similar price (2021.1.24-26, two nights in a twin sea view room. We gave it all five stars and were very satisfied. Here? Oh, it’s hard to describe. Except for breakfast until 1:30, it’s not as good in all aspects.)

I don’t recommend it. The lobby manager called me and not only did not give me any compensation, but he continued to ask us to upgrade next time we come to stay (no, there is no need to come for military training again), or upgrade our relatives (why should I harm others). It’s a bit funny, not sincere at all, and just empty talk. People are not satisfied, but you still want them to consume. The logic is unreasonable.

What's even better is that on the second day of my stay, the front desk of the hotel found out that it was my birthday and actually sent a birthday cake 🎂 I was really surprised, I was very moved, I realized that the hotel really treats customers with heart, and it must be a five-star praise! 🥰

There is a restaurant for breakfast next to the big pineapple shopping mall and a place for children's entertainment. The breakfast is recommended. It is also very convenient. Downstairs, there is also an infinity swimming pool on the top floor of the snack city. The hotel has a battery car to pull it to the beach. In fact, it is very close to walking. Recently, there are many people on the beach. At night, you can have a small barbecue. Haitang Bay is still inferior in comparison.

msg:🚗 Traffic: In the urban area, it is very noisy. Parking here needs to be parked in the garage, and you need to ask a waiter to take you.
-Environment From the balcony, you can see the sea at a glance, but the view from the balcony is full of old buildings in front of the landscape. There is a square outside here, and there is a loud trumpet from 7:00 in the morning. There is also a military exercise where the troops start playing trumpet training at 6:30 in the morning, and the team shouts slogans. It is definitely not the best choice for people who care about the tranquility of the environment.
- Hygiene: The bed and sheets are quite clean and comfortable, but the towels are not white, yellow and a little damp. The toilet is obviously non-smoking on the 16th floor. As soon as you enter, there is a smell of cigarettes. The sofa is covered with traces and towels. How can you do this in a five-star hotel. This is the first time I met.
- The sour smell of the toilet from going to the toilet in the middle of the night and returning to the toilet in the morning is very strong. stench! ! ! This is the most disgusting. So check out early in the morning and change hotel.
- The space of the room is actually more than 40 square meters, which is not small, but the decoration is outdated, and the main furniture is too much, which is placed in a mess. When you open the door, you will see trash cans, slippers, and scales. There are two coffee tables, and the writing desk is a big round table, not like a hotel. I also chose this hotel experience because the photos on the review looked good, but it was not what I imagined. My husband only slept for two hours at night, and I didn't sleep much either.
-Service: I booked a room of 598 yuan and said that it helped me to upgrade. Ctrip also went to the hotel to communicate with the hotel about the solution. This is the only way to stand on the hotel's side. They also said to send a plate of fruit. I didn't deliver it when I came back at 10 pm, and I had to call for consultation, as if I was going to ask for a plate of fruit.
The dishes for breakfast are still rich and many choices, but there is a smell of urine in the lobby of the dining room. So I choose the outside balcony.
🔔Service: It's good to answer the phone, the younger girls feel cold and not motivated.
The whole hotel is the worst experience for me in Sanya. If the price is about 600 yuan, to be honest, there are many homestays with sea view rooms with too many choices.

The front desk was very particular about upgrading two rooms with a balcony, and one was a sea view room. , must be liked. The room is clean and spacious. Good sound insulation. Buffet brunch (you can eat until 13:30 pm), dinner is scheduled for two nights, and it is eaten outdoors. The environment is comparable to that of a seven-star hotel, and the taste is great! The pool is bubbling beautifully, infinity pool! It is a 6-minute walk from the seaside (take the children to test), and you can also take the hotel shuttle bus. The hotel is connected to a large shopping mall, and there is a snack street at the entrance. If you stay in Dadonghai, this hotel is especially recommended. The transportation is more convenient, bus, taxi, all kinds of suitable. Very satisfied, I must order this again next time💋💋

The front desk checked in and directly upgraded the balcony room. It was very good. It was very quiet without facing the street. The location is in Dadonghai. It is very convenient to go to attractions near Luhuitou. The only inconvenience is that every time you drive out, you need to go to the front desk on the 1st floor to apply for a free vehicle departure before you can drive to the negative floor, which is a bit troublesome.

🙂 The location is very good, in the big pineapple building, convenient parking and underground garage, free parking for accommodation, easy to eat, it is the same building as the shopping mall, there are many restaurants, and I am very satisfied
🙃 When I placed the order, I didn't know that the sea view room was on a low floor, so the sea view room on the highest seven floors was really lonely, and all I saw were the roofs in the front row.
🙃Let's not talk about the hygiene situation, Hainan is generally poor in hygiene. The sound insulation is also too bad, I once suspected that I was opening the door, and the people in the corridor could hear clearly
🙂 There is an infinity swimming pool on the sixth floor, and a children’s playground on the fifth floor. Dengfeng handicraft courses are suitable for parent-child travel.
🙃 However, these services are not introduced by the housekeeper, you have to look at Ctrip to find out. service is not good
Travel shot:
😁 Hotels in Sanya generally give away travel photos, and there are cooperative photo studios. Generally, five photos are given away, but there are other paid Taobao. Harman's cooperative unit is next to the swimming pool on the sixth floor. It is recommended to communicate on the spot. There are a lot of nice WeChat, there are many people taking pictures on the scene, you can also choose clothes, and there are various Internet celebrity props, swings, bird nests, floating beds, glass boats, surfboards, etc. The price is different, the number of pictures and the scene are different, I recommend everyone to take a photo and save it It's also good to send a circle of friends to commemorate it, and the price/performance ratio is OK. There was a photographer who was very patient in taking pictures of children and provided a lot of materials and solutions. The customer service lady also tied the children's hair and designed hairstyles. Our teacher Amu was also very good and guided a lot of "contrived" styles 😘 Zhang Zhang has long legs, very good

msg:We are guests of 1162. First of all, let's evaluate your hotel here. This is the second time we stayed at Harman Hotel for 12 days. The last time we stayed was on the Dragon Boat Festival last year. We are also repeat customers. This time we stayed at Harman Hotel for 12 days and have many happy and happy memories. It's a small journey, the room facilities and equipment are quite ok in general, but the first day I checked in, I used the hotel bathtub and I was allergic to call the switchboard and needed disinfectant tablets and toilet water, but only sent toilet water, not disinfectant tablets, only I sent a disinfectant hand sanitizer. I asked for a disinfectant tablet, not a disinfectant hand sanitizer. I waited until the second day to notify the staff to report the allergy incident to the front desk again after cleaning. A lady from the housekeeping manager came to our room in a blue dress and only gave us a box of antiseptic tablets, balm and toilet water, and only told us if we needed anything during our stay, but did not ask us about our allergies and injuries. On the 3rd day, when the staff was cleaning us, we just came back after breakfast. The room attendant just finished dragging the floor and there was a heavy musty smell. He reported to the front desk again, so he had to upgrade us to a sea view room. After the room, I asked the front desk to arrange for a fixed employee to clean during our stay, do not change it. The front desk said that this place has been arranged, but during the stay, it did not follow the original arrangement, and we still replaced the waiter from time to time. Hygiene, and what's even more annoying is that the cleaning threw away my sleep mask repair, but I didn't seek compensation from the hotel, I just pretended to turn a blind eye, but then the same problem was not followed up in time Entering, the main switch of the room's engineering works, and it trips from time to time. When I go to bed at night, all the lights in the room are flashing from time to time. The TV turns on automatically in the middle of the night. If I don't know, I think that there is a stranger behind the operation in the room. I'm afraid after thinking about it. Sound insulation. During the day, the project was notified to arrange for a report. The engineering colleagues came to replace the motor plate, but it was not completely repaired. The cleaning was messy and unclean. During the stay, the mouthwash cup will not be replaced, and the cleaning items will not be replenished. We had to call every day to inform us that we didn’t make up after cleaning. We had to deal with the switchboard every day. Originally, we were going to check out on July 1st, but the schedule changed and we stayed for another day. The two of us were doing things outside. I came back very late. When I went to the front desk to swipe the room card, the colleague at the front desk said that he asked him to give his hotel a good review on the spot. We directly refused. After returning to the room, the customer service called and threatened us that he would give your hotel a review and not comment. Just make up the expensive hotel and give us an upgrade to the sea view room and increase the price. Well, we can bear it until today we check out and check out at the front desk. The colleague at the front desk asked us to let him operate the mobile phone and give us a review of the hotel, and said no to you. Hotel reviews, they are not good at handing over to customer service. Said that because they upgraded us to a sea view room, they asked us to give him a good review. I was puzzled in my heart that I stayed in so many hotels, and no other house threatened the guests like their expensive hotel. Good reviews, I hope your hotel will make persistent efforts, train the staff to clean the room well, and don't litter the guests' things.

msg:I stayed in the hotel for three nights in 2017, and I felt very good. At that time, I felt that the hotel room was clean and hygienic, the service was good, especially the breakfast and dinner were extremely rich. Impressed me. So I still chose this hotel this time, but this time, there was a lot of water on the ground, and the dampness was very serious. It was useless to close the window and turn on the air conditioner. It was still the same wet. There is a strong musty smell in the room, and the service staff did not make it clear in advance when checking in. If there is no way to avoid dampness, can you clean up the room so that there is no strange smell in the room? Also, the variety of breakfast is at least 50% less than before. Yuehai dinner has been closed, and the previous highlights are gone, very disappointed! I have tried to recommend this shop to my friends before, but this time I came here with my friends, and it made me a little bit rude.

It is suitable for hotel guests~ the infinity pool is very clean, the bar next to it can have a few drinks, the location of the hotel is excellent, next to the big pineapple mall, the best thing is luggage Delivery service, if you don’t want to take your luggage to play before going to the airport, you can send it directly to the next hotel or airport. It’s not too convenient! In short, next time you come to Sanya, Harman is my first choice!

First of all, thanks to the lady at the front desk (I don’t know what her name is, she is thin, she was off work on the day of check-out, if I visit back, she must tell me what her name is!) for helping me upgrade the room type for free, and gave me a very nice birthday cake on my birthday. (Because the purpose of this trip is to celebrate my birthday, I didn’t think I would give a cake to me. It was very delicate.) I don’t know why I worked in a well-known five-star hotel group before. The shock has been moved, too hard, too hard, thank you very much for the dedication of the bakery chefs. Thank you very much for the hard work of the little brothers and sisters in the restaurant. The breakfast is very rich, and the meal time is also very long. It can last until 1:30 in the afternoon. As a northerner, I found my favorite pancake fruit. Thank the room eldest sister for helping me clean the room and change the toiletries every day. All in all a great stay!
🚗 Transportation: Very convenient, just a few minutes walk from the bus stop of Summer Depar**ent Store
🧹Sanitation: It is also very good, the hotel is not damp and very clean.
🍃Environment: Very quiet, comfortable to sleep at night😌, you can also watch the sunrise if you wake up in the morning🌅

Although the time is short, the impression is very good. The hotel looks a bit old, as can be seen from the floor of the corridor. But the facilities are not outdated and unacceptable.
In addition to the pool bar and restaurant on the fifth floor, you can enjoy the following benefits:
1. Check in early and check out late at 2 o'clock;
2. Free shuttle bus to and from the duty-free city, just make an appoin**ent with the hotel mini program;
3. Dadonghai free beach chairs, this is the most amazing thing for me. Because it takes 60 hours for Xihaijing District, 100 days a day;
4. Beach ferry battery car, you can sit on it when you go out, suitable for lazy people like me. Beach, sea breeze, waves, coconut pineapple, it’s not too cool;
5. The hotel does not provide free airport pick-up and drop-off, but Ctrip bookings can give free pick-up. Just wait in Hall 4 after Phoenix Airport comes out. There is a Ctrip reception sign, which is very convenient.

Breakfast: Breakfast is also very good, rich in variety, and it ends at 13:30, which is perfect for people who sleep late. The taste is also good! (Picture 5, 6)

Finally, there is the infinity swimming pool. Although the sun is very big in this weather, it is still a bit cold after entering the water. After entering the water, you will get used to it.

In addition to Harman’s hardware, the location is unique, and the quality is impeccable, what’s more, the hotel’s service has left us with a very good impression. The front desk clerk Xiaogang has received us many times. He may not know us, but every time he receives us, he is so warm, enthusiastic, serious and polite. This time I stayed in Harman for three consecutive nights. Considering that we can do some laundry, we were upgraded to a room with a balcony for free. I also patiently introduced us to the hotel's related services, dining time and floor, which made us feel at home.
In addition, the room service is also very good, the bedding and the room environment are very clean and hygienic. Here, we must also name and praise the waiter Chen Shili. Every day, the room is cleaned carefully and in place. Not only can we respond to requests, we can also take the initiative to inquire about the cold and the experience of the accommodation. No demand, very warm. The hotel has such a humanized service, which is also an important reason why we have chosen Harman many times. Will come again next time and will introduce it to relatives and friends.

Thinking of a solution, I only gave you an instruction to pack a breakfast tomorrow. Before boarding the plane, I didn’t have enough to eat breakfast.

msg:I was worried about seeing the bad reviews on Ctrip, but the result was perfect. The hotel was very cost-effective and upgraded to a higher floor. Only the superior room only had a little view of the sea, and the room was almost facing the military. There is no view, but playing outside during the day does not affect it. If you want to soak in the hotel, it is recommended to choose a sea-view room. The room is large and fully equipped. The bathtub, shower and toilet are separated separately. The bath water is very large and very cool. The key is to clean it. Very clean, the waiter will ask about hygiene every day. The swimming pool is on the fifth floor. There are few people on the fifth floor. You can pick up the airport for free if you book on Ctrip. It’s easy to go to any bus stop downstairs in the hotel. You can also apply for free duty-free bus. , Will stay next time

After staying in Sanya for a week, only Harman made me feel the feeling of the city center. The infinity pool under the sunset is really beautiful, not enough shots. The buffet also has a nearby restaurant, which is an absolute sensory and taste enjoyment!

msg:This is great, it's totally in my heart, it's crazy Amway for everyone. We came by car. The hotel parking is completely free. There is a large underground parking lot, so there is no need to worry about no parking spaces.

🚗 Transportation: It is very close to Dadonghai and Luhuitou. The bus will not be reviewed because I haven't taken it. It will take a few minutes to walk to the beach. It is also a few minutes' drive from Luhuitou.

🧹Hygiene: Hygiene is really great, and it’s very clean, because I have been staying for many days and I am very familiar with a housekeeper. I asked my name, Lin Xiaoyan. Very talkative, I talked a lot with us. Because I am staying on a renewal basis, sometimes I can’t open the door, so I always ask her to open it for me, every time it’s a great smile!

🍃Environment: Although Harman is not particularly big in the resort hotel, the infinity pool is super beautiful. There are also 30 photos taken for 300 yuan and 10 refined photos. My photos have not been repaired yet, haha, it may be too fat. Haha, I'm not in a hurry anyway, let's fix it slowly. The young lady who introduced me to take pictures didn’t ask her name. She was very nice. She helped me change clothes. She said she wanted to lose weight. The photographer’s name was Amu or Amu. She still couldn’t remember what she did. Her actions were more enchanting than me and she was very patient. Thanks ha. . . I think Harman’s hotel is very cost-effective, the rooms are not expensive, the five-star quality, and I love the infinity pool.

🔔Service: I didn’t plan how long I would stay here. I just continued my stay day by day. After a long time, I got acquainted with the young lady at the front desk downstairs. One is Xiaochao and the other is Sun Ling. They are teachers. Disciples 💞
Don't ask me how I knew it, because I live for too long and everyone is very nice.
Love it so much. . .


By the way, the room we stayed in on the first day was a bit noisy. My husband slept lightly. It was almost 12 o’clock. The waiter came up to help us change the room. Although I don’t know what the guy’s name is, everyone is pretty good and I’m really happy. It's comfortable to live. . . The guys in the lobby are also very enthusiastic. I have asked them several times for masks, because the masks I bring are in the car and don’t like to go downstairs. They laugh every time, are very polite, and tell me enthusiastically. Where to eat and what. . .

Because check-out at 12 o'clock will be disinfected and cleaned. Breakfast will be provided. The room has a bathtub. The bathroom is separated from dry and wet. That's it
The 5th floor is the infinity swimming pool. These photos were taken by the photography studio on the 5th floor. They are professional studios. I love them. The photos are very good. The package is suitable for my 499 3 sets of costumes and 20 refined photos. 60 The young lady in the photo studio gave me another 20 negatives, a total of 80, and I wanted to come to the pool to take beautiful pictures and find her. I strongly recommend the shooting. It’s really hard work. Thank you 🙏

There is 24-hour room service and welcome guests at the door. When you get off the bus, you will take the initiative to help you. Luggage, there is a free tram at the door to take you to the beach, the room is large, there is an infinity pool (the swimming laps are free), and there is a free pick-up service + luggage butler, and breakfast is included. We stayed for 6 consecutive nights The most satisfying thing is that breakfast is until 1330. For those of us who love to sleep late, it’s really too friendly. Opposite is the Big Pineapple Mall. There are also supermarkets and restaurants in the hotel. There are a lot of food and snacks. There are also a lot of hangers in the room, as well as a safe, refrigerator, bathtub, vanity mirror, convenient location, very close to the city center, great

🍃Environment: Their house is a relatively new hotel, and the overall facilities are relatively complete. There is a swimming pool on the first and fifth floors, which is still very good.
🔔Service: Get off the bus to pick up the front desk phone service, and carry luggage, these are all in place. Birthday party cakes. Praise!

Tucao: The main reason I want to give a bad review is the dirty water.
The hotel provided a disposable bathtub cover. We used the archives and put the water again. It was dirty. I thought it might be muddy at the beginning, but it was still dirty after three times, so we gave up
I seriously suspect that the water in the entire hotel is like this.
Then it’s very damp. Sitting on the quilt for two minutes, it feels a little bit wet.
There is no trash can in the room. I don’t know why. There is only one charging socket at the head of the bed. I don’t know why these are trying to complain. As a whole, if there is no dirty water from that bar, the others are still Pretty good

The free bus to Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop is at the north gate of the hotel, a 5-minute walk from the hotel lobby, which is super convenient.

The room facilities are quite satisfactory, the air conditioning is adequate, and there are a variety of pillows to choose from. The network TV channels are very comprehensive, and can be watched back, it is very convenient to follow the drama. Except that the TV remote control is not very sensitive due to excessive use, the room facilities are very good. There is no such thing as a "musty smell".

The breakfast buffet is very rich. The breakfast time at Harman Hotel lasts until 1:30 noon. You must order a big compliment!

The swimming pool is very large, divided into children and adults. The children's pool is bigger than the adult pool and provides a variety of water toys. The swimming pool closes at 11pm. Because the swimming pool is on the sixth floor of the hotel, you can enjoy the invincible sea view from the infinity pool.

It is recommended to book a sea view room.

I was pleasantly surprised when I entered the room. It is clean and tidy. There is a small balcony where you can dry your clothes. You can also see the sea view~ but the sound insulation is not so good. Sometimes you can hear the sound of walking outside. After all, the number of rooms on the first floor is still very large. I specially bought a set menu with double breakfast, which should be brunch, because the time is from 6:30 to 1:30, which is really long time. I just don’t know if it is a recent guest. There are fewer, so there are fewer types. There are few people in the swimming pool, and there are more fun in the children’s area~


🔔Service: I think the most important thing to praise is the service~Because there are disinfectant and paper towel trash baskets in the epidemic elevator~The aunt who comes to do the hygiene will remind us that the Coke Sprite in the small freezer is free. The next day, when I swiped the room card at the front desk, I asked if I could extend the check-out. Ms. Wenmingyi did a free late check-out until 2 o’clock. When I met the staff at the hotel, they would greet you and say hello.


🚗 Transportation: The transportation can be said to be very convenient. Of course, it is convenient to eat and drink in the city. You can enter the Big Pineapple Mall on the right hand side of the hotel door. There is Nay Xue and McDonald's, and there is a snack street opposite to it~ very convenient~

2. There is a free baggage butler, get off the car to help with luggage, if you go to the next hotel, just store your luggage, and the baggage butler will help you to the next destination when you place an order. This is awesome without delaying the trip.
3. There is a gym and an infinity pool on the fifth floor and a half. The photos are really good. The staff cleaned the pool just after 7 o'clock in the morning. (I saw the sunrise in the morning, although I didn’t see the sunrise!) Swimming pool There is a special photo shoot next to it, and it can be taken on the same day when it is not busy. It is said that the hotel room package contains five photos, but I feel that five photos are not enough, so you can take a separate package.
4. The hotel room is always card inserted, and it is very cool when you enter the house (this is also the reason why the room is very humid, the ground is full of dew, some damp, and the mirror is always foggy) The balcony is large, the bathtub is also large, and personal The supplies are very complete, such as hair conditioner, this is really not available in many hotels! great
5. The elevator needs to swipe the card, the elevator entrance has disinfection gel, the elevator has paper towels, and the epidemic prevention measures are very good.
6. The staff is very welcoming. When checking out in the morning, the aunt in the guest room will greet him and feel very warm
7. I heard that the restaurant is very rich, and you can have meal coupons for breakfast and lunch, but the restaurant’s buy one get one free strategy is not very friendly to singles. It is impossible for me to send one to someone who is lonely and go out to play in the morning. The hotel eats noon, so the communication is fruitless. My breakfast is ten yuan Hainanese noodles, and I save a fortune. Maybe the restaurant is outsourced, so the hotel has no good way, but I still hope to try to solve similar problems. After all, A breakfast of more than 100,

The service staff were very good, the breakfast was also very rich, and there was a big pineapple next to it, so I ate it. The coconut chicken is pretty good, and it’s close to the beach.

The best thing is that there is an infinity pool. There are travel shots by the pool. Because there was no itinerary on the last day, I made an appoin**ent for a trip. The result is really amazing. The pictures taken are beautiful. All negatives are sent. The things that need to be repaired are all background people, and they are almost available, ready to make a photo album by themselves. The key price is beautiful. value. Thank you photographer Nan and photographer Fu Tsai. I was afraid that the online disk would not be able to receive it, so I sent it to me one by one. The assistant sister's service is also very meticulous. I feel that the best thing about the hotel is the swimming pool and travel shots.

The hotel’s infinity pool is really beautiful. Young ladies who like to take photos can come to take big shots. There are travel shots inside the hotel, which are also very good. They are all worth recommending. There is also a battery car to pick up and drop off at the Dadonghai Seaside Hotel, even better 👍🏻

Breakfast and lunch are very rich, with various fruits, noodles, flour, bread, and fruits. The infinity pool on the fifth floor is also very beautiful. You can also take five photos for free in each room, more than 20 yuan. The technique of taking photos is ok. The minus item was that the room we checked in at the beginning had a very strong musty smell, and there were small cockroaches on the washstand. After communication, we immediately replaced it to the tenth floor, which was much better, but there were still mottled marks on the cabinets in the room. Another point is that the room facing the sea can hear the very loud wake-up call to the military base at six o'clock every morning! Talking and playing red songs at seven o'clock, the soundproofing is particularly poor! If sound insulation is strengthened and the room is renovated, the experience will be better

From 6:30 in the morning to 1:30 noon, there are Chinese and Western dishes and Hainanese specialties. The daily dishes also change, especially the various noodles. The taste is very good.

There are 4 children’s playgrounds, 2 children’s castles, 1 bouncy castle (open regularly), and 1 studio, suitable for children to play during the day. The rooms are larger. Above the deluxe sea-view room, there is a balcony and clothes rack. The only thing that is not convenient is that the bathroom and shower are not physically separated, and the bathtub is outside. Check in at the front desk and upgrade to an invincible sea view room on the 15th floor

Twice I said that I was staying at the hotel and the front desk could not be picked up. In the end, Xiao Li Yingbin from South China delivered it by electric frequency car, and his first impression was not very good. There is a massage chair in the room but there is a charge. It is very convenient to take the elevator down to the big pineapple on the 4th floor. The artisan’s grilled fish and skewers on the side of the road are good. I only had a meal of seafood or missed the hot pot. I sent 5 photos of the trip, plus one charge of 20 yuan, breakfast Chinese and Western food, and all the noodles are also ok. I went to Yalong Bay Forest Park by taxi for 90 yuan. The full set of tickets bought by Ctrip, one large and two small 954 rainforest drifting and 3D movies are pretty good, and children like it. The downside is that it is far from the sea. It is better that the South China Hotel is 50 meters away from the beach. The only thing that is not good is the carpet under the washing table. The furry and black carpet is also low-grade, so it's better not to! The luggage butler is very good and can send the luggage to the next hotel or airport🌹

First of all, everything is available in the house (except the washing machine), the refrigerator, the room separated from the bath and bathroom, the big bathtub, the big sofa, and the desk, which are great!

Because the old man went on a day trip with the group the next day, I was a little late with the children, and there was a playground in the restaurant! ! ! ! Adults can eat with peace of mind, and children don't have to go out and run around! The toys are still fun! Very safe ones! I finished breakfast with my child and ate at 12 o'clock...Breakfast and lunch were resolved...a bit cheeky 😅...and finally boasted about the swimming pool! I went to Atlantis first and then Haman, my child is 2 years and 3 months old! In the water world of Atlantis, the children just played a slide and couldn't play! On the contrary, this swimming pool is divided into 1.4 meters for adults and 60cm for children. There are slides inside the children, and there are various lifebuoys for adults and children! The children playing here are so special, so special!
It is also close to the beach and the sea! Very close! It's wonderful! Next time I live here directly, I think the good room type upstairs has a balcony, and I will definitely live there next time! Cozy and comfortable! It's still Dadonghai! It's also very convenient for eating! The elevator that goes to the swimming pool on the 5th floor can go to the mall on the 4th floor. There is a piece of tofu in it. The dishes are very delicious for me! You really deserve to order Haman's breakfast with your room!

msg:總體評價很好，性價比很高，位於大東海旅遊區邊，距離海邊挺近的，附近還有商場，小攤夜市（不過逛的人少，開業的攤攤不多，價格倒是不貴，比第一市場便宜些樣），附近出遊方便，公交打車都可以。
酒店本身房間設施中規中矩，房間大小合適，我定的雙床房沒陽台，有陽台就更好了，不過要貴些。
酒店的早午餐真適合放鬆遊，睡到自然醒，可以吃飯到13點30分 菜品也還是可以，選擇挺豐富，水果也挺新鮮的，沙拉蔬菜味道很好吃，8歲以內小童不收費。可以一早耍了海再回來吃飯，也可以睡醒了再慢慢去吃。
酒店配套的親子活動也不錯，酒店的泳池挺贊，無邊泳池，拍照打卡很漂亮，可以看到很多美女，哈哈😄
  酒店距離西島碼頭打車要半小時，建議可以在西島住一晚上，西島的海灘很好耍，景色也不錯，我們去時下了半天暴雨，沒咋耍就返回了，挺遺憾的。
總之挺推薦的，下次來的話還會定它。

房間設施有些老舊
但是最大特點是無邊泳池 和小童城
無邊泳池一直有多個救生員看護 帶孩子玩水很安心 
蒲宏照救生員很負責 下午會有泡泡活動
小童城有免費孩子彩繪 畫畫 充氣城堡
特別適合帶多個小朋友去玩 幾天不用出酒店

除此之外，大堂迎賓每次都貼心開關車門拿行李，前台小姐姐很用心安排添加小朋友的用品，房間打掃得很乾凈。酒店雖然不年輕，但是每一個工作人員都是努力用心的年輕人，送上大大好評!
小童遊樂設施和泳池也很贊，小朋友度過了很難忘的小童節 非常推薦

細節評價：房間內的床鋪舒適柔軟，床品乾淨整潔，給人一種放鬆的感覺。浴室設施乾淨衞生，洗漱用品擺放整齊，給人一種整潔的感覺。房間內的空調温度適宜，空氣清新，給人一種舒適的感覺。
性價比：該房間的價格相對合理，性價比較高。房間內設施齊全，裝修風格簡約大方，適合各種需求的客人。此外，酒店的服務態度也很好，給人一種賓至如歸的感覺。
此外，酒店可以定期對房間進行清潔和維護，確保客人的居住環境乾淨整潔。進入第一個房間，房間很潮濕，地上甚至有水，床上也是潮的，聯繫前台換房後，兩個房間完全是天差地別，不理解的是，無論哪個服務人員都一直在強調是不是我們開了陽台門和空調才會導致出現這種情況。
綜上所述，該房間是一個不錯的選擇，適合各種需求的客人。房間內部設施齊全，裝修風格簡約大方，給人一種舒適的感覺。酒店的服務態度也很好，給人一種賓至如歸的感覺。雖然價格相對合理，但如果有一些小改進將會更加完美。

msg:預訂前看到評論一度很糾結，擔心設備陳舊，房間黴味這些問題。入住之後出乎意料的很驚喜，我們入住的房間打掃的很乾凈，也沒有感覺到潮濕黴味那些，五一過後性價比簡直不要太高，酒店的設施也挺齊全，小童娛樂活動豐富，泳池拍照也出片。在大堂遇到的工作人員都很熱情，會主動打招呼。在前台碰到我們湘妹子阿潔服務超級熱情，入住的時候發現定錯房型，很快速的就幫忙協調處理好了，非常贊，沒有什麼不滿意的，是以後來大東海酒店的首選。

酒店服務人員熱情服務周到，到店離店都主動幫忙搬行李開車門。前台王晶晶很好，幫我們升級了正對沙灘的海景房。
房間設施雖然有一定年限了，但是還是維護得挺乾淨的，來的時候是陰天，所以有點潮濕。
寶寶很喜歡這個海景陽台，住得挺舒服的，睡得挺香的。大東海性價比比較高的酒店了。

衞生:房間很乾凈，很整潔，入住之前管家會巡房，確保房間的衞生和安全，特別好~，18層保潔的小姐姐、18樓的行政（王少靜小姐姐的服務超好，值得表揚）特別的温柔，服務也超好。
環境:環境挺好的，很幽靜，院兒裏都是綠植，房間佈置的也比較用心~
服務:服務很周到，管家團隊很貼心、很熱情，答覆很及時，這是其他酒店很難做到的，各位管家辛苦了~
設施:房間設施很完善，熱水沒問題，兩個衞生間互不影響，還有免費贈送的飲料、氣泡水、礦泉水，老闆大氣~
再次提一下管家團隊，服務確實很好，住過很多酒店，可以説這兒的管家是最好的了~

3.客房大姐隗秋霞打掃的很乾凈，客房經理思雨給準備了果盤，很感謝周到的服務。
4.至於外界説的設施便老舊，個人認為還可以，就是因為靠近海邊緣故，或多或少有點黴味。

唯一需要説的問題，就是小童樂園那的一個服務人員，態度不好，2月14日帶娃到畫室，發現畫室裏有服務人員給一個小女生畫彩繪，還有人在排隊。我也正好查到週三下午是人臉彩繪，我就讓娃也排隊，結果彩繪師説這個活動要預約，當時都給我弄傻了，因為明明看的宣傳圖片上沒有寫預約的事，然後我又出去拍了課表，問服務員沒有寫預約的事，她説今天沒有彩繪，我説週三不是寫了有嗎，而且你正在畫嗎？她説她過懵了，春節不知道星期幾了。然後又説那你們也排隊吧。
之後她就不停的在和我媽媽説悄悄話，後來她又解釋，春節不再執行那個課表了，所以這個是小朋友爸爸打電話預約的，她説的這些操作都沒有通知的，反正他就是在強調他沒有錯，今天就是不該畫彩繪。反正態度巨差，後來還跟我媽媽攀老鄉，讓不要去投訴，説自己在亞特蘭蒂斯做了好多年了，畫的很好的，就感覺很無語，知道是老鄉，畫畫的時候怎麼各種拒絕沒有答應，等怕投訴的時候才拿老鄉説事，真是謎之操作。

早午餐到下午1點半結束，直接包圓了我們的中餐，酒店裡有超級多小朋友玩的東西，而且3樓大菠蘿直接一個小童樂園，酒店步行5分鐘就是海灘🏖️，5樓泳池也很美！還可以租小推車和提前要圍欄，五星好評！

msg:酒店地理位置真的好 性價比很高 相對這個高峯時間段其它酒店來説這個價格訂到還蠻實惠的 
樓下就是大菠蘿+夜市 沿海邊走全是餐酒吧 蠻浪漫的 我們這幾天伙食都在那裡解決 離沙灘也近 突發奇想想去踩海也就走幾分鐘路
因為主打休閑 就基本在這一片區域裏活動 離第一市場就2公里 但就是高峯時段車子很難打
酒店房間還不錯 可能樓層較高沒有感受到什麼潮濕的感覺 前台 客房服務人員都很專業 每次要東西都很熱情
就是房間部分小地方會稍微有點破舊的感覺 比如櫃子和木質傢俱有些微的破損 但基本上是舒服好看的 訂的海景房早上起來看到的海很漂亮 
無邊泳池去逛了下 沒下水 因為回房間後就懶得出門了哈哈 還是很漂亮的 下次應該還會訂這裏 有機會再下水玩
啊對了 客房清掃服務的阿姨人真的很好 我太喜歡她的東北口音了 我沒出門收拾房間的時候會跟我推薦好吃的 很熱情
包括每次打電話跟前台要什麼東西時 一分鐘不到就會給我送達 很快 及時響應 很好

msg:在入住之前還是非常忐忑，哈曼畢竟快十年了擔心酒店設施服務衞生跟不上，再加上網上所説的差評，比如噪音大、衞生差、潮濕有味道等。現在已經從三亞回來了，入住了哈曼兩天高級大床房可以中肯的評價一下啦。首先位置沒得説，樓下逛街吃飯非常便利，附近非常繁華人流量大，離海灘近並且有專門的擺渡車可以送到沙灘。再説酒店服務，提前一天就有專人打電話確認行程以及提供相關可能所要的服務，比如我就説了我需要床圍，等我到房間已經裝好了；酒店大堂確實感覺年代久遠了，但應有的服務不少，如開門下車、接送行李等，辦理入住的前台也服務態度好，主動給我寶寶一個小玩具。房間在18樓，所以我沒有聞到所謂的潮濕味道，晚上確實能聽到外面一點聲音，畢竟這是酒店位置決定的，樓層高一些確實體驗感比較好，也沒有説什麼房間衞生不到位，起碼我入住的房間不存在這個問題。最後進入泳池需要刷房卡這點好評。總體來説，哈曼對得起這個價位的酒店服務，如果酒店二次翻新，我還會二刷

衞生：入住第一天晚上一掀被子就發現有血跡，是土是頭髮我都忍了，酒店外國人超級多，就這血跡洗不乾淨，着實讓人心裏膈應。
設施：確實和網上説的很老舊，而且神奇的是，洗漱盆和鏡子就是廁所和床的隔斷，晚上睡覺洗臉盆會自動亮燈，理解，是怕太黑了去廁所撞到，也不理解，有個亮光不好入睡。
環境：位置是在大菠蘿後面，算是酒店聚集地，邊上有小廣場，晚上會唱好久的歌曲，沒有歌曲也會有廣場舞，喜歡熱鬧的很合適。我當初是奔着酒店的健身房和泳池去的，咋説呢，就是不盡如人意。
服務：不是每天固定打掃，要在門上掛牌才會有人來搞衞生，第一天打掃衞生的都沒有鋪被子。
反正～我是不去了😔

環境：酒店位於大東海附近，走路幾百米就能到大東海海灘，門口就有大菠蘿商場和夜市，很方便。180度海景房風景不錯。
設施：總體設施還可以，就是電視很小，也有浴缸，應有盡有吧。
早餐種類還行，沒有很豐富，有兩天吃到了煎餅果子很不錯。
缺點是入住時附近在搞活動晚上太吵了，連續吵了4天。

保潔阿姨每次收拾衞生都幫我疊好衣服，非常感謝！酒店去停車也方便，每次出門報車牌號即可，但是由於在繁華區，每天回來都會堵車，有舍就有得，也是由於在繁華區，這六天的飯基本都是在隔壁商場解決的，各種海南特色都有，還不會擔心亂要價！唯一有點糟心的就是電梯太慢啦，可能趕上旺季的原因。
早餐真的值，建議大家都買早餐的套餐，一直到下午一點半，起床多晚都能吃到早餐的感覺太爽了。無邊泳池景色也超好，我們都是晚上去玩玩，白天太曬了。
總體來説真心推薦，下次來三亞肯定還會來這酒店！

酒店有屋頂花園和泳池、健身房，泳池從早到晚都開放，且一直有安全員。
衞生間和浴室中間沒有格擋，但是空間不小，而且有很多扶手，浴室還有個可以坐的枱子，感覺應該很適合帶長者來住。
有冰箱，給備了飲料。
沒有特意訂海景房，但給換了帶陽台能看到大海的房間，陽光超好。
總之，性價比之王，十分優秀。

msg:位置非常好，酒店內配套也比較豐富，除了去海灘踏浪，基本不用出酒店都能滿足。房間打掃得很乾凈，網絡影視非常豐富。酒店禮賓，前台、客房和餐廳，小童樂園服務都非常熱情，有需求反應速度也非常快，尤其是前台Jenny小姐姐，非常熱心，給我們三亞之行提供了很多建議，非常感謝！酒店還有比較有意思的是早餐到下午一點半才收餐，喜歡睡懶覺的絕對是個福音。泳池較大也很乾凈，孩子能玩的設施也不少，泳池的歡樂活動很讓人驚喜，推薦👍🏻👍🏻

msg:房間黴味嚴重，酒店靠近大海，濕度高，房間的木頭都發黴發黑了，開着窗户都無法去除黴味，住了對身體不好，服務還好。房間的佈局不大合理，無法做到乾濕分離，房間的電視時好時壞，裝修落後，隔音非常差，半夜會被門外的聲音吵醒，與5星嚴重不相符。
