msg:An excellent hotel in Lhasa. Located close to major site seeing spots around the city but still quiet and secluded enough for a relaxing stay (the hotel area is huge for Tibet!). 

Was welcomed with traditional ******* decor with efficient and pleasant service from all hotel staff. The room is big, clean and equipped with a humidifier, oxygen concentrator and a Dyson hairdryer. 

The breakfast buffet was pleasant with a small-sized a la carte dish for all guests to order from a menu. Food was decent with a mix of western, Chinese and Tibetian options

msg:I spent five nights of an eight day trip to Tibet at this property, and overall had a very positive experience. The location, buffet breakfast (and dinner), and particularly the staff, are all excellent. I was one of very few foreigners to visit of late, and especially the English-speaking staff went out of their way to be helpful‚Äîfor instance arranging additional coffee pods for my room. 

That said, there were a few weaker points worth noting, especially for a St Regis with a five star rating: most generally, the property is starting to show its age. Some simple things, like ragged window blinds, seem like they could be fixed easily‚Äîother issues, like worn fixtures and furniture would take a bit more. Similarly the landscaping might be described as weedy chic. Strangely, too, while the main area of the hotel is beautifully decorated, some of the outer buildings have extensive blank walls, and my first junior suite was similarly plane, with a large unfurnished and purposeless area in the bathroom, for example.

I was also surprised that turndown service was not standard at a property like this‚Äîand even when requested, was not a full refresh of the room (eg: used wash clothe not taken from the shower, toiletries supplemented, used dishwater replaced).

Still, for the location and accommodating assistance, I think the St Regis remains the best option in Lhasa.

You can quickly learn about ******* culture, which is particularly memorable. The housekeeper Irene who checked us in was warm and thoughtful. She carefully asked about the altitude sickness in Tibet. When she learned that we were on our honeymoon, she upgraded the room to a suite and gave us free breakfast. During our stay, the housekeeper Luosang gave very careful replies and arrangements to the questions we raised. Although it was a short stay, it left a deep impression on us. It was a pity that I didn't experience the welcome fruit and yogurt this time according to the comments. I will come back to experience it next time I have the chance.

Room facilities We booked a selected king-size bed room in the main building, which includes breakfast~ The facilities in the room are clean and tidy. There is a large bathtub, but when you just arrived in Tibet, you probably don‚Äôt dare to wash it. The bathroom is very clean~ Dyson hair dryer 
~ Men even have razors! Zundu is very pleasantly surprised and very good~ There are welcome fruits, and the yogurt is also very delicious~ It is very convenient to order takeout~ It is very close to the Potala Palace Barkhor Street, but it is recommended to take a taxi to walk there. Although it is one or two kilometers, in order to avoid altitude sickness, you should not walk there.
The hotel is very beautiful. You can directly see the Potala Palace from the lobby on the first floor and the sixth floor. The butler Alan has good service

You can see the Potala Palace from the lobby, and the waiters will greet you warmly when you pass by. The breakfast is semi-buffet, which is very much to my taste. The only drawback is that the parking lot is a bit small, but I will stay here again next time I come to Lhasa.

msg:The St. Regis Lhasa is undoubtedly a great place to stay during my trip to Lhasa.

The hotel is in a very advantageous location, located in the heart of the city, with convenient transportation and complete surrounding facilities, making it extremely convenient for travel and shopping.

The front desk staff showed a high level of professionalism, and the check-in procedures were fast and efficient. They always maintained a friendly smile and enthusiastic attitude, which made people feel warm.

What impressed me most was the butler Justin. His service was meticulous, from communication before check-in to careful care during the stay, every detail showed his professionalism and care. When I had any needs, Justin always responded and tried his best to meet them in the first time. He would also kindly provide some suggestions on local characteristics and attractions to make my trip more colorful. His/her enthusiasm and patience made me feel truly at home.

The experience of staying at the St. Regis Lhasa was great. I strongly recommend this hotel to all tourists going to Lhasa. I believe you will also enjoy high-quality services and unforgettable experiences here.

The breakfast at the hotel is very rich, and there are people who will guide you to arrange seats. The meal collection time is also late, which is very friendly for people who drive for a long time and have one meal a day.
The hotel facilities are very complete and the heating is sufficient. There are a few suggestions for optimization:
1. The oxygen concentrator can add the function of the oximeter. This oxygen concentrator can only produce oxygen and cannot accurately know whether your blood oxygen concentration is within the normal range.
2. The photo is facing the bed, and some characters are illuminated in the dim light at night, which is indeed a bit scary.
3. The hotel room is very large, and the humidifier in the room is a bit far from the bedside. It is still very dry for people and does not play a humidifying role.
4. It is recommended to mark the hot water in the hotel. I have never found the hot water switch over there.
In short, next time I come to Lhasa, I will choose St. Regis! ! !

The official data of the diffuse oxygen supply room is 51 square meters. The diffuse oxygen supply is divided into time periods from 22:00 to 5:00, not all day. If you need oxygen, it is recommended to go to the hotel infirmary (the infirmary is on the first floor of Building 1). The medical clinic is very important for people who suffer from hypersensitivity after entering Tibet. At least they can take oxygen to relieve themselves when they feel uncomfortable, and they can also dispense medicines. The breakfast is semi-buffet, not many varieties, relatively exquisite, and the ingredients are fresh. We are very satisfied.

msg:The world's highest St. Regis is located in Lhasa at 3,600 meters. This time I finally unlocked the "best in the world" from this angle.
The hotel floor is not high but the area is large. In front of the main building is a boxy building, in the middle is the "white pagoda building" shaped like the Jokhang Temple (sorry, I don't know the scientific name of this building) and a pool of clear water, quiet. And solemn. Advancing into the entrance hall and then the lobby, it is completely ******* style. There are many ******* Buddhist elements in it, but each piece is placed appropriately.
Opposite the largest floor-to-ceiling window in the lobby, in the distance is the Potala Palace, the landmark of Lhasa.

Check-in was very fast, and a housekeeper was assigned on the spot during my stay. My housekeeper was Alan, a very handsome ******* guy.
My high fever arrived at the same time as I arrived at the hotel, so Alan could see that I was not feeling well, so he helped me carry my luggage and drove a shuttle bus to take me to my room in Building 2. All rooms with diffuse oxygen supply are in this building. Building.
This time I booked a Lhasa suite. The 118-square-meter area is almost the second largest suite in the hotel. It does seem a lot empty if you live alone.
Push the door and enter. On the left side of the entrance is the guest bathroom. Going around the entrance, there is a dark hall. The decorative paintings of snowy mountains on the wall add a ******* color, and there is an oversized dining table in the living room. Opposite the living room is the minibar and cloakroom, which are also very large.
The larger space is in the bedroom area. The entire bedroom area has the best lighting and the largest area. The open bed + small living room are integrated into one. In addition to the double basin in the bathroom, the best position next to the window is given to the bathtub. When it snows, you can see the snow-capped mountains not far away while lying on the bed or in the bathtub. The spare parts are all Bulgari, and the quality matches St. Regis.

Because it is a resort hotel, there is no lounge. The dining experience focuses on breakfast.
For plateau areas where ingredients are relatively less abundant, the breakfast variety does not need to be compared with that in the mainland, but almost everything is available, especially the yak beef noodles in the noodle stalls, which are delicious.
There is also an a la carte menu, mainly Chinese and Western food. I ordered an egg benedict, which was also quite good.
The most popular seat for breakfast is by the window, because you can overlook the Potala Palace in the distance.
Unlike hotels in the mainland, St. Regis Lhasa also has a 24-hour infirmary, which is great for people with high anti-inflammatory symptoms.
I felt a little uncomfortable in the middle, so I sent a message to Alan, and soon he drove me to the infirmary. The doctor would help measure my blood oxygen, give oxygen, and prescribe medicine, which can alleviate high reflexes.

I stayed at St. Regis in Lhasa for a day. Although there was a high altitude at 3,600 meters above sea level, I really felt the enthusiasm of Alan and his ******* friends. If you come to Lhasa next time, you will probably stay here for one night.

msg:It was my first time to celebrate the New Year in Lhasa, and I deliberately chose the St. Regis Hotel, which has the highest rating online. First of all, I am very grateful to Alan at the front desk for his service. After carefully understanding our reservation situation and wishes, he not only met my expectations for the floor and location of the room, but also took the initiative to upgrade the room for us on the first night, allowing us to check in with surprise. In addition They also actively helped us coordinate the meal issue on New Year's Eve and waived the cost of breakfast for the children on the second night. Let's talk about the hotel. The St. Regis is in a good location. You can reach Barkhor Street within walking distance. The overall area is not large. The pool is the highlight and it has a sense of design. The Shigatse suite is great. The bathroom is huge (comparable to a living room), the makeup mirror is high-definition, the bedding is comfortable, and the oxygen supply and humidifier are also very useful. Finally, in line with the original intention of hoping that St. Regis will get better and better, let me talk about a few shortcomings: 1. The lighting control in the suite bedroom is too inconvenient, and there are steps between the bedroom and the bathroom. There is a risk of falling when getting up in the dark. It is recommended The hotel will revamp this as soon as possible. 2. The bedding in the classic suite is too soft, not to mention unfriendly to middle-aged and elderly people with bad lumbar spine. Even a 16-year-old child couldn't stand it after sleeping for one night. I suggest that the hotel change it to a soft bed if it is not short of money. Bedding bar in Shigatse suite. 3. I wonder if it is the Spring Festival holiday and the restaurant‚Äôs master chef is on vacation? In terms of food, the taste is really not that good. The New Year's Eve dinner worth more than 400 yuan can only be said to be "form over content", which is not good enough to taste (in comparison, the Shangri-La buffet tastes much better). I remember that I stayed at the St. Regis in Sanya two years ago, and my overall impression was pretty good. In particular, the hotel environment and rooms were to my liking. My only regret was that the food and beverages were mediocre, which was really not good in Sanya, which is full of five-star hotels. I hope Regis will work harder in this regard!

It is clean and hygienic and tastes good. , I will still choose St. Regis next time I travel to Lhasa.

msg:. The environment is very good. It is said to be the best hotel here. I stayed for three days and two nights. Fruits were only given on the first day. The toilets are relatively old. The room style is mainly dark tones. You can enjoy the view in the lobby and the bar on the sixth floor. You can see the cloth Dara Palace.
. The service is very good, takeaways will be delivered to the room by staff, and there is butler service, which is responsive to all requests. However, the lighting in the room is relatively dark, which may be due to the hotel's design style, and the high reflectivity is a bit depressing.
. The hotel is equipped with a medical room, which is paid. The price is a matter of opinion. I think it is better to go to a regular hospital.
. Breakfast and dinner are semi-buffet, and some dishes can be ordered.
. According to the reviews, the room care products are from Bvlgari. However, during our stay this time, our room did not have Bvlgari care products. Shampoo, shower gel and conditioner were all available in a large bottle. It was not like a five-star hotel at all. .

I came here for the Chinese New Year this year because of their most satisfactory butler-style service. The receptionist at the front desk was warm and hospitable and answered all my questions. The staff also helped me carry my luggage to the room, which made me feel like I was at home. There is oxygen and heating directly in the room, so there is no need to worry about high reflection. The decoration of the entire room is very beautiful, spacious and bright. The outdoor garden scenery is beautiful and I enjoyed it very much. I went to the corridor of the main building cafe on New Year's Eve and watched the night view of the Potala Palace and the fireworks show. The breakfast is also rich in variety, and there are free fruit gifts in the evening. All in all, it was great to spend the New Year here. Thank you Lhasa Regis! I had a very comfortable and satisfying Spring Festival.

The Potala Palace can be seen from the hotel suite, and there is a beautiful atrium garden inside. The Potala Palace is near the hotel and can be reached within walking distance. Come and take a look at the pattern on the fifty yuan coin!
When checking in, the staff are enthusiastic and proactive. After completing the formalities, a dedicated housekeeper will guide you to the room. Whether it was the check-in staff, the housekeeper, or the reception staff, I felt that the hotel's service was a plus during the entire stay, making people feel at home.
Fruit plate and yogurt will be given after check-in. The yogurt tastes very good and is the best yogurt I have ever tasted in Tibet. There are not many types of breakfast, and the taste is relatively average. The most delicious thing is yogurt. The room is relatively large in size and is generally divided into three areas. After entering the house, there is a living room on the front. There is a desk and bed on the left hand side, and a washing space on the right hand side, including a bathtub and a double basin washbasin. Dyson hair dryer, Bvlgari toiletries.
All rooms in the hotel can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the rolling mountains of Tibet. The fusion of ******* style and retro design is super spectacular.
The hotel has Chinese food, Western food and other delicacies of various tastes that you can enjoy.
The hotel's spa is very good. It uses traditional methods to achieve a harmonious state of mind and body, which is very comfortable.
The next day, I ordered afternoon tea on the sixth floor of the hotel, and the taste was average. Fortunately, there are relatively few people, so you can directly overlook the Potala Palace. If you just want to come up and take pictures, there is no need to order afternoon tea, you can just come up and take pictures and leave.

Because it is the off-season, I took the initiative to upgrade the room and gave small gifts, no matter what. If you encounter any problems at any time, we will provide help and answers as soon as possible. In addition, the entire hotel staff: concierge, room service, catering, etc. are also very enthusiastic. They take the initiative to say hello and ask if they need help. The hotel room is large and tidy quickly. However, there is indeed a lack of intelligence, because after a certain period of time, toilets and showers also need to be improved. In addition, I tried the Wagyu hotpot buffet in the restaurant. The meat was really average, but the desserts were unexpectedly delicious. As someone who doesn‚Äôt usually eat desserts, I ate a lot (and I think eating desserts can help relieve nausea). However, the 298-person buffet dinner is really cost-effective. Friends who don‚Äôt want to go out can try it. In the end, I was lucky enough to catch up with the weekly nightfall ceremony, which included singing and dancing, opening champagne with sabers, offering khatas, and bonfire carnival, which was quite ritualistic.

The room we stayed in was on the top floor. The room was very spacious and the Potala Palace could be seen from all three windows. I have watched the Rizhao Jinshan Mountain and Bu Palace slowly light up for several days. You can feel the most classic side of Lhasa without leaving your room.
On the day of check-in, I also caught up with the hotel's welcome ceremony of opening champagne with a big knife, which was very unique.
All service requests made during check-in were responded to. The hotel also has a medical clinic, which is very reassuring and convenient for me who has some high fever. One day I had a fever and went to the infirmary. The doctor prescribed a unique medicine. As expected, the fever subsided immediately after taking it.

The hotel is very close to the Jokhang Temple and Barkhor Street, and it is also convenient to order takeaway.

In short, it is really a good choice for tourists who come to Lhasa and are not able to adapt to the environment immediately.

The room is relatively spacious overall, the toilet is separated from wet and dry, the toiletries are complete, the hair dryer is from Dyson, and the room has a 24-hour oxygen concentrator. At 6:30 in the evening, the restaurant has two buffet meals to choose from. The hot pot buffet we chose tasted pretty good, but it was just a normal hot pot with not too many types of dishes. There are all kinds of takeaways near the hotel, and it is more prosperous than the previous villages and counties.
24-hour butler service: Justin, the butler, is very enthusiastic and responsible. All the takeaways I order will be delivered to my room.
24-hour oxygen concentrator oxygen supply service: There is a 24-hour oxygen concentrator in the room. I always turn it on. Although there is no high reflex, I sometimes have difficulty breathing, so it is necessary to choose an oxygen concentrator where you live.
Overall, the experience is very good. If you go to Lhasa, I highly recommend the St. Regis Hotel, which is cost-effective.

The lounge on the 6th floor is one of the best viewing platforms of the Bu Palace. I took a lot of photos there with my camera. The welcome fruit was very beautiful and thoughtful. The butler Ted was very enthusiastic. He took the initiative to bring the luggage into the room, introduced various facilities, and asked about the check-in experience every morning. We went to Yanghu on the morning of the third day, and Glenn from the restaurant also packed breakfast. The only drawback is that the oxygen concentrator in the room makes a loud noise all night long, which affects sleep.

The breakfast is very exquisite and the service is great. Ryan is very enthusiastic and recommends all kinds of delicious food. You can see the Potala Palace from everywhere in the hotel, and it will be a blockbuster whenever you take a photo. Will come again next time ~

msg:I was looking forward to staying in a star-rated hotel. Let me talk about the dinner first. The quality was really average. Then the most terrible thing was that I couldn't sleep all night. The bed was softer, but I shouldn't have been unable to sleep anyway. The breakfast was average, there was no meat at all in the beef porridge and chicken porridge. Such a big hotel does not have a self-service washing machine, it is really lagging behind!

One of the good points is that the facilities are quite complete, the hotel is generous and classy, ‚Äã‚Äãthe decoration is luxurious, and there is a doctor inside, which is quite good, and the service has a lot of room for improvement!

msg:It was a great experience staying in, highly recommended!
I was worried that I would have high fever when I first arrived in Lhasa, so I had to get a good rest. After looking at it again and again, I finally decided to choose St. Regis. Facts have proved that my choice was very wise. First of all, the hotel service is very good. From the initial check-in at the front desk, to the concierge, housekeeper, and waiters in various positions in the restaurant, they are all very warm and considerate. The lady at the front desk said that the 6th floor can overlook the Palace of Buddhism. As soon as we went upstairs, we saw the Palace of Buddhism. I was so happy. The concierge guy took the initiative to help us with our luggage. We wanted to make tea and drink more water, and the waiter brought it to us immediately. One thing to mention: We wanted to go to the temple, and the housekeeper helped recommend a reasonable route; the waiters in the restaurant also took the initiative to help find a place to put our luggage and introduce the meals; when we met the waiters everywhere in the hotel, they greeted them very warmly, on the plateau. We also enjoy the service level of Pingyuan, which makes people feel at home. Secondly, the breakfast is very rich. In addition to the Western and Chinese food commonly found in the mainland, there are also ******* specialties, such as tsampa, yogurt, butter tea, sweet tea... It is delicious and delicious, and the business hours are very long, starting at 6:30 in the morning. . I can‚Äôt remember what time it ended, haha. Third, the room is very spacious. The twin room we booked is 58 square meters in ******* style. The bathroom is very large, with a large mirror and two sinks. It is equipped with a Dyson hairdryer and a separate makeup mirror. It is really great. I understand what girls are thinking! There are also welcome fruits and yogurt in the room, making people feel the warmth from Tibet as soon as they enter the room. The bedding is clean and comfortable, and there are buckwheat leather pillows that can be replaced. Although it is a diffused offering, there is still a separate oxygen concentrator. Finally, I really love the decoration of the hall. It is full of ******* style. From the courtyard to the lobby to the corridor, you can see worshiped Buddha statues, portraits of ******* compatriots, Thangka shops and thick ******* incense everywhere. It immediately felt like I had really arrived in Tibet!

msg:We previously planned to go to Lhasa but couldn't make it due to various reasons. This trip, St. Regis Lhasa became our first choice for a quick trip. We usually consider the location, environment and service of the hotel when traveling. Of course, taking all factors into consideration, St. Regis Lhasa was our first choice. Ji can still stand the test. It has oxygen supply, a medical room, and a humidifier. It is in the city center but not noisy. It avoids crowds and has its own world. However, I have to complain about the room design at St. Regis. The closed window design, although keeping warm, is prone to high humidity and dryness. When choosing a room, it is recommended to choose a room with windows that can be opened.

msg:The first time I stayed at St. Regis was in Sanya. I liked the decoration style of St. Regis very much. This time I came to Lhasa without hesitation and chose St. Regis. I booked a suite on the first floor. It was very quiet and comfortable. The hotel is as high-quality as ever. The services are also matched accordingly. But the St. Regis aromatherapy smell really confused me. The porridge and eggs on the breakfast menu are both good. I also like cucumber juice. In addition, I would like to mention the butler Eirc. The service is very, very good. He speaks softly and makes people feel very comfortable.
I was given a bottle of red wine, but I haven‚Äôt drank it yet because I was afraid of getting sick from altitude sickness. The oxygen concentrator was still effective. In addition, the room was a bit hot. I stayed overnight without a blanket and developed a low fever the next day. The hotel's infirmary service was excellent. If there is any problem, it will be solved immediately. After leaving Lhasa, we will meet again.

msg:This stay experience was very comfortable at the beginning. Everything was very good and the facilities were very complete. But the room was very dry the next day. Maybe the hotel was heated in winter, and then the room felt a bit stuffy and very dry. This made it very difficult to fall asleep, and the rest was not good the next day. When we encountered these problems, we reported them to the hotel staff, and then the staff actively helped us solve the problems and provided better solutions, so what? The check-in experience after that was indeed much better. Moreover, the hotel provided us with solutions very quickly. After raising the issue, they contacted us as soon as possible and were very concerned about our subsequent check-in situation. So, this is my positive attitude and feeling after encountering difficulties in the front. It‚Äôs a lot of extra points, and I‚Äôm very grateful to the hotel staff for solving the problem and providing help as soon as they learned of my difficulty. This is the attitude that a luxury five-star hotel should have. I am really happy that they provided us with a solution so quickly and it did not affect the rest of the itinerary. In fact, it is not terrible if there is a problem. The most important thing is how to get there. Solving problems is what matters most, so this aspect really deserves praise. Indeed, as the best hotel in Lhasa, it is very professional in handling problems and takes the feedback from guests very attentively. Overall, it is actually the most satisfactory hotel I have stayed in in Lhasa, and I feel very happy to be so proactive and willing to help. We will also visit the surrounding areas on our itinerary, but when we return to Lhasa, we I will still choose St. Regis Lhasa to continue my stay. Because it is very, very important to stay in a place like Lhasa, where the population is high, so this is also a guarantee for yourself. The room is very spacious, you can rest well, and there are also rooms for support. The hotel also has a 24-hour infirmary, so this is Maximum protection. Of course, I will still recommend it to my friends, and it is worth recommending.

msg:I booked two nights at St. Regis and I have to say that the experience was very bad. The windows in the entire room are sealed and there is no ventilation. Last night and tonight, I woke up four or five times every night with extremely dry mouth and tongue. It was very uncomfortable, especially the pillow, which was so high and hard. The soft one is very collapsed. On the first night, I had a headache due to high fever at night. I asked customer service to turn on the oxygen concentrator. After three reminders and four calls, finally the infirmary staff came. I felt that using the oxygen concentrator normally had no effect, and the medical staff refused. Don't look for him at night, which will affect your rest. Please be early tomorrow. I must say that when I asked customer service to deliver something, the speed was very slow. I asked if I could help the customer dry the clothes. His tone was cold and indifferent, and he was told that they would not provide it. There is no humanized service that a five-star hotel should have. Hotel staff rarely smile or say hello. Not to mention mechanized services. The most important thing is that the rest is seriously bad and extremely dry. If you are struggling to choose St. Regis, my feeling is that you will never come again. A group of companions who came to check in a day later felt the same way. In winter, the pajamas provided are thin. There is no 24-hour butler service at all, so there is no experience of service.

The room I stayed in this time has obvious signs of use and needs to be repaired, but the flaws are not hidden. I met the butler Justin again, it was a great fate, thank you! Still full care, a St. Regis characteristic. Thanks to Stanley at the front desk, he was very considerate in arranging a room number for my mother's birthday. It was full of details, but Building 2 is really too far! Comparing Shangri-La horizontally, the St. Regis rooms are more spacious and the design is better, but the attention to detail is still slightly inferior. The breakfast style at St. Regis is more Western-style, with a variety of breads to choose from. The variety of Chinese-style breakfast is indeed inferior to that of Shangri-La. I still love St. Regis no matter what, and I will really be healed the moment I walk into the lobby!

The breakfast semi-buffet tastes good too, better than InterContinental. The housekeeper, sister Qu Zhen, was also very responsible and solved all problems encountered quickly. It is recommended that the hotel upgrade the ventilation system and change the brands of toiletries.

Facilities: The oxygen supply and humidification bar, afternoon tea and parking are very convenient, but the temperature in the breakfast area is slightly lower and the rice gets cold quickly.

Hygiene: There are no sanitary dead spots in the room
Service: Let‚Äôs focus on breakfast. It should be a general mobilization. The service and clearing of the tables are very fast. There will never be any discomfort to the next table due to delays in clearing. The boys are very elegant, which shows the hotel‚Äôs excellent management level!

The butler service is rather poor. If you don‚Äôt know the online time, you can only contact the front desk if you have any questions!

msg:During the few days I arrived in Lhasa, I was debating whether or not to stay at the St. Regis. The price was expensive and it had been open for a long time. The facilities were old and the service was mediocre. In addition, the reviews were mixed. I was afraid of being in trouble and never made up my mind. In fact, to put it bluntly, I was afraid of spending money. Money is not fun yet! Before I leave, I definitely want to experience it myself after staying in other hotels. With this feeling, I decided to book a suite. Since I didn‚Äôt have an itinerary and just wanted to wander around the city, I came to the hotel early to check in. The butler at the front desk Peter quickly helped us check in. The second floor we had initially arranged felt a bit boring, so we changed to the first floor where the door is open. Since the room had not been cleaned yet, Peter suggested that we go to the 6th floor to have afternoon tea. This suggestion was great. With a panoramic view of the Potala Palace right in front of you, my husband said it was really worth itüëçüëçüëç! Peter was very enthusiastic and helped us get our luggage to the room. He also gave us the room card to the terrace bar. There was also fruit and minibar in the room. All the hotel staff were very welcoming. Peter also helped me handle personal express delivery before leaving the store, which was very considerate. The breakfast is also rich and of higher quality, and the semi-self-service service is also very nice! It really comes true to that sentence. Practice is always the best way to test the truth. Just like the decision to choose to stay at St. Regis is so rightüëç! I won‚Äôt hesitate to choose St. Regis next time I come here. The only slight flaw is that the TV signal is too old and the picture quality is not very good. The last thing worth mentioning is that the bed is too comfortable. Although it is soft, it is very refreshing. It was the best night I slept in Lhasa these days! Super recommended!

Breakfast: There is still room for improvement, the product is too average, the ******* characteristics can be added a little more, only sweet tea is still the same.
After all, it is necessary to reflect ******* culture, and food is a major feature

As a guest, he can get personalized one-on-one service, and the experience is still very good. Overall, staying at St. Regis in Lhasa is worthy of the brand and price.

There are many types of breakfast, including Chinese and ******* styles. After eating for four consecutive days, I finally tried all the freshly made breakfasts on the menu. If you can‚Äôt finish the breakfast, you can take it away to avoid waste
The room is very big, the lighting is a bit dim, I took the time to hold a video conference, the internet speed is very good
On the first night, I felt that the oxygen generator was a little unstable, and no oxygen was sprayed out, but it was fine later.
The quality of the spare parts is good, because I dare not take a bath because I am afraid of high anti-reflex, the big bathtub is a bit wasteful
The housekeeper, Yeshe, responded very promptly. She delivered yogurt and fruit to the room every day, and also gave a diamond knot when checking out.

msg:The first stop when I came to Tibet was very warm, and I will come here when I come to Lhasa in the future. Here's why I'll always choose this place:
1. The hotel is equipped with a 24-hour infirmary, which has high-reaction ***** and oxygen tanks. If you feel unwell, the doctor can go directly to the room for a visit. The doctor is also extremely responsible. This is what attracts me the most.
2. The hotel upgrades the suite, the room is huge, and the facilities are all available. The room is supported by a 24-hour oxygen supply machine, equipped with an oxygen inhalation tube, and can inhale oxygen at any time. In addition, the housekeeper Tashi is serious and responsible, and he can contact and reply at any time. It is a place where people can relax physically and mentally.
3. The location of the hotel is excellent. It only takes 5-6 minutes to drive to Barkhor Street, which is very convenient.

There are also hotel complaints on the Internet. I don‚Äôt know why these people encountered that situation. In short, I think I will always choose this place as the first stop of my trip to Tibet!

St. Regis's butler-style service, from check-in to check-out, every detail is very considerate. The guests' check-in time seems to have come to a standstill~ I feel peaceful and peaceful. Thanks to my butler Irene for taking care of me this time!

Recommend the St. Regis Hotel's Chinese restaurant Chinese dishes are not inferior
The He family, the taste is very authentic. The hotel also has a SPA center, the unique lridiumSpa iridium spa and traditional ******* therapy. If you are tired, you can go to the spa to relax yourself! The key can also alleviate the high reaction!
There is also the Tubo Bar on the 6th floor, a good place for afternoon tea, where you can enjoy an awesome afternoon tea facing the view of the Potala Palace! Very comfortable ~ In short, if you come to Lhasa and choose St. Regis, you will not be disappointed, and you have already given Amway to your friends!

msg:St. Regis is the hotel I stayed in Lhasa,
Special, focused, highly recommended.
The red design style comes from Sera Monastery,
Wooden Buddha statues, embellished with red lacquer paintings,
Ancient, warm and lively.
It is a ******* style palace hotel.

I live in building one,
Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows are courtyards and waterside pavilions.
The 60-square-meter room is very spacious,
The 2-meter wide bed is also very comfortable to sleep on.
The ******* photo photography wall is a highlight of the room.
The most commendable room has an oxygen generator and a humidifier, which can inhale oxygen,
Greatly relieved our plateau symptoms.

St. Regis's service is particularly commendable,
Free fruit and yogurt upon check-in,
Today we came back from shopping,
Ask the housekeeper if you can send yogurt and fruit,
Immediately satisfied.
The room we booked was given two breakfasts.
But my 14-year-old daughter went to the restaurant together,
The waiter never bothered to pay back the bill.
And the lady who sells Haagen-Dazs,
Charged only one ball and gave us two balls,
Bold and not stingy.
Every service staff we met when we came in and out would say hello with a smile on our face, making us feel warm and touched when we go home.

St. Regis's supporting facilities are also great,
The morning buffet can be served by yourself or ordered.
The variety of varieties is very rich.
The Peking duck in the Chinese restaurant is very authentic.
The matsutake chicken soup is also delicious.
The Tubo Bar on the sixth floor has a large terrace.
You can eat barbecue, and you can also have an afternoon tea,
It's really great to eat and drink overlooking the Potala Palace.
St. Regis's spa is also worth recommending,
Thai essential oil massage, Israeli Dead Sea mud face care,
Let your whole body be relaxed and comfortable.
The Indian incense in the spa room smells very good.
I casually praised,
Before I left, the young lady who was doing nursing gave me a box.
And, and,
I must talk about the magical medical room of the hotel,
A few large and small pills,
Immediately improved my high anti-headache and nausea.

The most important thing to thank is our exclusive butler,
A handsome and tall ******* boy Zaba Sangzhu Alan,
Help us with our luggage, arrange meals and fruits,
Putting ice on my sprained daughter
Show us "Princess Wencheng" to book a ticket and call a taxi,
It's really considerate.

Living in St. Regis, travel is also very convenient,
It is very close to Barkhor Street, Jokhang Temple, and Potala Palace, so it is very convenient to eat, drink and have fun.
During the four days of the trip to Lhasa, I chose to live in St. Regis,
It is my most satisfying decision.

Let the guests wait there.

Hello foreign guests.

SPA strongly recommends lightning protection!
The technician was very unprofessional and had no understanding of the structure, muscles, and meridians of the human body. He pressed hard at random and felt very uncomfortable afterward. Essential oils are of poor quality and can cause allergies in the body. The price is 1600-1900, you‚Äôre welcome.

Poor food

Worst hotel experience in Lhasa.

msg:The head chef, restaurant manager Heidi, and personal butler Danwang of the St. Regis Lhasa must be highly praised! Super six-star service!
The environment is very good, it is very atmospheric as soon as you enter the door, ******* style
The butler Danwang helped us get things. He took the trouble to bring us takeaway several times. He is very tall and handsome. Wechat questions can be answered within seconds to solve the problem without procrastination.
The breakfast is very rich. Although it was a little unexpected, the restaurant manager, Heidi, handled it very well. He is very satisfactory and has an excellent attitude. It must be praised that the hotel can have such an elite management
The head chef is also very careful in introducing the dishes, and he gave durian swan cakes
The location is also good, the parking is convenient, it is convenient to order takeaway, and it will be delivered to the door of the room
The environment is very distinctive, the room is also cleaned very clean, and a lot of bottles of water are sent
The towels, bath towels and carpets are all white. It's very comfortable to live in. The breakfast time is also very long, which satisfies the lazy pig's work and rest. The fly in the ointment is that the refrigerator in the room is not cold enough, but the hotel will provide ice cubes. The front desk upgraded the room. Haha, the price/performance ratio is really good. I am so surprised by Lhasa St. Regis
Facilities: ******* style, simple and clean, the oxygen generator is great

Hygiene: Super satisfied, tidy up neatly, towels, bedding and carpets are all white

Environment: Very comfortable. After staying for three days, I still want to live in a very fragrant corridor
Service: Full marks! The service attitude is great, the ability to solve problems is very strong and polite
24-hour oxygen generator oxygen service: enough and comfortable
24-hour butler service: Danwang excellent butler! Careful and handsome

msg:I originally booked St. Regis for 6 nights, but because of some recommendations from Xiaohongshu, saying that the facilities were outdated, I changed it to 2 nights. When I checked in, I upgraded to a deluxe double room. The facilities and environment are indeed not as good as the newly renovated ones, but it does not affect the hotel environment and the comfort of staying. The environment is very good, the hotel is very distinctive, and the service of the staff is very simple. There is also an infirmary in the hotel, where you can check your body in time. I suffered from high fever every day when I arrived in Lhasa. After staying in St. Regis, I took the medicine prescribed by the doctor. The room can inhale oxygen every day, and I climbed the Potala Palace smoothly the next day. Except for the buffet at night, I think the service is too slow, and I think everything else is pretty good. If you go to Lhasa, you must live in a better place, which is very friendly to Gao Fan.

The lady who received me at the front desk was Alisa, who gave me a really good experience. A very touching sentence was: You can consult me with anything, not just about hotel accommodation, but also about other aspects these days Anything, you can contact me. It can be felt very well that all the friends in the hotel are all online, and they really want to provide guests with services that exceed expectations. After that, I will come to Lhasa every year and live in St. Regis every year. Friends especially recommend it, next time you come to stay in a room with a view of the Potala Palace!
I wish Alisa happy work and success. I would also like to give special compliments to the management team at the front desk. Every one of them made me feel that in the ******* area, it is also worthy of the St. Regis brand.
The lobby of the hotel is very comfortable, you must go and feel it! Feel at home!
The whole hotel is full of buddhas, and the sense of security is very strong!

The decoration style is also very *******, and it shows more design skills than other St. Regis. The standard room is very large, and there are two washstands, which is more convenient. In addition, it is equipped with oxygen, except that the noise is a bit loud.

Service: It can be said to be a major feature and advantage of St. Regis Lhasa. I feel that the staff of Lhasa St. Regis are mainly *******s, and you can feel their simplicity and enthusiasm. Whether it's the front desk receptionist, the restaurant and bar service staff, or the housekeeping staff, a smile is contagious.

Hygiene: Hygiene is the lifeline of a hotel. Although the St. Regis facilities are not up-to-date, they are generally well maintained.

Comprehensive evaluation: more than 95 points. If I come to Lhasa again, I would like to stay again.

Recommendation index: Personally give five stars.

At the Shangri-La Hotel where the car was parked, the security guard didn't say that I didn't stay at the hotel, so I wouldn't stop! This St. Regis security attitude! Let me really look at the top management of the St. Regis Hotel with admiration! ! !

msg:It is indeed the best hotel in Lhasa, with a good environment and great service. I was only planning to stay at St. Regis for one night. The front office manager Stanley Junior upgraded the room type for me. The service was warm and thoughtful, and I was so touched... So I stayed for another three nights without hesitation. The room was great and super quiet. Day rested well. The hotel is also close to Barkhor Street. The chef of the Chinese restaurant is up-to-date, and the Sichuan cuisine is super nice... I will definitely stay at St. Regis again next time I come to Lhasa!

The dry cleaning service is efficient and satisfactory. The surprise this time is that I bought some fruit and asked the hotel to help cut it. The result... well, I admit it The fruit I bought is not worthy of the master's knife skills üòÇ

msg:First time to Lhasa! Departure stumbling and very lucky to arrive! Chose St. Regis on the recommendation of a friend! It was the right choice for the first time! The architectural style of the hotel is based on the ******* style, and the interior decoration is also the same style. Entering the hotel's modern and comfortable hardware, I still have the atmosphere of being in Lhasa and Tibet! The terrace of the hall can see the Potala Palace in the distance! Peter at the front desk checked in and added WeChat. If there is any situation, you can contact him in time! I really appreciate Peter's service, helping me solve many problems! The facilities in the room are very complete, and people who come to Lhasa have a very comfortable feeling! The night before leaving, Peter told us that the bar on the 6th floor of the hotel was open. We enjoyed the Potala Palace in the distance at the bar on the 6th floor for the last night, while drinking and chatting about the travel experience for a few days, it was really wonderful up! It's a pity that all the local beers in the bar are out of stock because of the epidemic! For me who came to Lhasa for the first time, St. Regis is the most sensible choice in terms of hardware and software! Because I still have a little high reaction, the oxygen generator in the room, and the portable oxygen cylinder for a fee! It's all so convenient! The charge for carry-on bags is also very reasonable!

msg:Hygiene: Normal level, but the trash can in the room is broken. After staying for two consecutive days, no one came to change it. It doesn't have much impact
Environment: The scenery is beautiful, and the decoration style of the lobby is very suitable for those who just entered Tibet to experience the ******* atmosphere. The only drawback is that the aroma in the lobby smells really bad.
Service: Advantages. In terms of service, I lived in St. Regis for two days in Tibet, three days in Intercontinental, and two days in Nyingchi. St. Regis' service is the best. The housekeeper Anna is considerate, feedback problems will be resolved in a timely manner, and people are more friendly. When I first arrived in Lhasa, the high-level rebellion was serious. The staff at the front desk saw that they were not feeling well, and four or five people came back and forth to help. Thank you very much. The doctor in the infirmary is very good. After taking the medicine for two days, the high reaction rate will not be serious. St. Regis is the only one in Lhasa with an infirmary and professional doctors. It is the first choice for the first time in Lhasa.
Disadvantages: The breakfast is not good, the service personnel are a little impatient, the noodles are all boiled, and some will talk about the guests behind their backs, like a ******* elder sister.
Generally speaking, St. Regis is especially recommended for those who have just entered Tibet. The food in the Chinese restaurant is very good and the price is not high. The humidifier and oxygen supply in the room are all turned on in advance, and I have never felt dry when I came to Lhasa. Recommended recommendation

msg:Entering St. Regis' lobby for the first time is still very shocking. The smell of aromatherapy and the afterglow of the setting sun blend together to form a sacred and warm feeling. The *******-style decoration in the lobby is very particular, and the Potala Palace in the distance can be seen from the large floor-to-ceiling windows. After check-in, I added the butler‚Äôs WeChat. If there is anything to do here, just contact your butler directly. Our butler Justin is a warm and handsome young man, and you can always see him busy when you come in and out. Although the water in the shower was blocked on the first night and there was no body lotion in the room, the hotel responded quickly and solved the problem in a timely manner. The viewing room has a large area, and the Potala Palace can be seen from the three windows of the room. The hardware and facilities in the room are complete. There are double-sided wardrobes on the left and right sides of the door, an oxygen supply machine, a humidifier, a bathtub, and a Dyson hair dryer. I like the extremely simple style of the bathroom and shower room with bare walls. The bathrobe is thin and not made of towels, which is super skin-friendly. After all, the hotel opened in 2010 is a bit old, and there are some minor problems such as loose sockets, poor connections, slow water discharge, etc., but the overall flaws are not concealed. There are many photos and paintings related to ******* people and ******* life on one wall of the room. I especially like this area.
I made an appointment for afternoon tea the next day, and when I came back late, I still reserved the seat for us. Three people can use one afternoon tea and order one drink, which is more humane. There are many kinds of snacks for afternoon tea, the quantity is very large, and the taste is not bad. The three of them didn't eat it, but the coffee tasted a little ordinary, and the salty snacks accounted for a little less. Sitting at the St. Regis Hotel, the highest altitude in the world, enjoying afternoon tea doesn't feel too cozy. In the evening, I reserved the same seat to see the Potala Palace in the dark, and ordered St. Regis's signature bloody mary, which features barley grains.
To visit the Potala Palace the next day, Justin suggested calling Didi to go there, as parking is not easy. On the way back, because I wanted to save time, I asked Justin for the menu of the hotel's Chinese restaurant, ordered in advance and left a place for us, and left after eating. I ordered the Dianping 888 set meal, which includes a roast duck and five or six dishes. The portion is very large, and I feel that 5 people can eat it. In the end, all the uneatable food was packed and could be eaten at the next stop at night, so I refused to waste it.
The hotel staff I came into contact with in the past two days are very friendly and enthusiastic, especially justin greets me like a long-time friend every time he meets in the hotel, and he still remembers me and remembers me when he meets so many guests every day. It is really considerate to live in various details about our stay and travel. I only stayed in Lhasa for two nights. For me, St. Regis and the hotel staff represented by justin are the business cards of Lhasa, and they are also a manifestation of the friendliness of ******* compatriots. They have left traces in my heart, even after returning to daily life after the trip will also remember. Thank you Justin, he is sincere, dedicated, and brought us a comfortable stay experience and long-term warm memories. I look forward to having the opportunity to come to Lhasa again, to stay at St. Regis again, and to see Justin again.

24-hour butler service: I am very grateful to my butler Irene. When I was in Lhasa, I had a high reaction the next day. The blood oxygen was very low and I was very uncomfortable. The butler reminded me that there is an infirmary where I can go to the doctor to have a look, take some medicine and inhale oxygen . After setting off for Nyingchi in the next few days, I became even more severely ill. I drove all the way, and there was no hospital at one stop where I stayed. It suddenly occurred to me that St. Regis has an infirmary and the contact information of the housekeeper Irene, so I contacted the doctor through a voice call. I finally survived the night and drove more than 100 kilometers to find the hospital for infusion and oxygen the next day.

When I arrived at the second building, it was a bit small. Far. The most speechless thing was the breakfast the next day. My husband and I got up and wore the hotel to eat breakfast. There was a distance of 200 meters to walk there. We met the staff along the way and didn‚Äôt remind them not to wear slippers to go out. We arrived at the door of the restaurant area where we swiped our card. The staff didn't say that you can't wear hotel slippers to eat in the restaurant. Then as soon as we got to the restaurant and just took our seats, three staff took turns asking us to go back to the room and change our slippers.

During this trip to Tibet, I experienced 3 different Songtsam hotels at the same time. Whether it is geographical location, hardware facilities and services, it is worth learning from St. Regis, the No. 1 Hotel in Lhasa. I hope to bring surprises again next time.

It is very close to the Potala Palace. You can view the Potala Palace on the first and sixth floors. The camera position on the 6th floor is strongly recommended! The breakfast is also quite rich. After all, the most important thing about the journey is to sleep well and eat well. The 24-hour medical clinic can go to the house for trea**ent, which is very suitable for those who have just arrived in Lhasa and have high fever. Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper for his considerate service, Ms. Sandy is very patient, and the overall experience is a comfortable stay.

msg:As the top three hotels in Lhasa, the St. Regis Hotel has been in business for more than ten years, but its popularity has not diminished so far, and it is still a favorite of many hotel lovers.
It is located on Jiangsu Road, within walking distance to the Dazhang Temple and Barkhor Street.
The lobby is very *******, with some mascots in ******* Buddhism placed in the middle. Put a few sofas in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, and you can see the Potala Palace when you sit on them.
On the right side of the lobby is the reception area. There are also some exquisite Buddha statues and statues in the rest area of the reception area, full of artistic atmosphere. I came to Tibet for 8 days and stayed at St. Regis for 4 nights. The feature of St. Regis is "absolutely private and high-level service". In every St. Regis I have stayed in, I will encounter a gentle and elegant "housekeeper", and the one in Lhasa is no exception. A polite man with slightly dark skin (sorry not I know his name) every time I call, there is a smile in my voice, and Sandy is amiable and understanding. Thank you for your professionalism and kindness, which brought me a very good stay experience. Dr. Liu in the infirmary is also highly skilled, humorous, and online 24 hours a day. Breakfast is only served because of the epidemic. The quality is still good, thank you.

The location of the hotel is very good, the Potala Palace can be seen from the room, and the Jokhang Temple is within walking distance. The good service is touching. Today coincides with my husband's birthday. The hotel sent gifts early in the morning. Sandy (the hotel manager) was very considerate and helpful, just like my own sister. Check in at 12 o'clock in the morning. Jack, a ******* brother from the concierge department, ran around carrying boxes in the cold winter months. The little girl who checked in seemed to be called Tina, who gave me a warm reception. I was very touched and very happy. I came to the Holy Land Lhasa for my birthday in other places and stayed at the St. Regis Hotel. All the good things come, thanks to the kindness. Thanks Regis.

The floor was full of stains, we hadn't touched the bed at all, and there were hairs when we opened it. The experience was extremely poor and affected the mood very much. As for breakfast, it was a box lunch at that time, which was very average. All in all, totally unworthy of the best title in Lhasa.

msg:This hotel is the best hotel in Lhasa. The staff are very responsible, especially the girl with short hair and glasses at the front desk, who has a very good service attitude. The little brother of Haagen-Dazs ice cream in the hotel is very impressive and has a cute smile. The children like him very much, and they have to buy one to eat every time they pass by. The hardware facilities of the room are a bit old, but it does not affect the use. It is very clean, tidy and comfortable. There is an oxygen concentrator in the room, and there is no high-reflection feeling when sleeping at night. (I have a small suggestion, can you change the pictures of the faces and figures on the wall to landscape paintings or Potala Palace paintings, it‚Äôs a little scary to sleep at night, I feel like a yi) Others are very goodüëç The transportation is also convenient and the management is also goodüëç

I thought it was too late so I didn‚Äôt call the service desk. I didn‚Äôt call the housekeeper until 8:00 the next morning, and no one answered the call for more than ten minutes. I had no way to check the phone number of Ctrip Hotel in the end. I only got through with my mobile phone. I originally decided to give a bad review. But the hotel handled it very well. A waitress quickly brought the water with a very sincere attitude. She also ordered Didi to Zaki Temple for me, prepared hada, and sincerely apologized to us.
In the end, we arranged a delivery vehicle for us. The driver, Pubu Tsering, had a very good attitude. He sent us to the airport and told us about the local folk customs. It was very good, and it also changed my view of the hotel. experience.

msg:üöó Transportation: It&#39;s very convenient just behind Barkhor Street üßπ Hygiene: The overall level has reached the expected level of Marriott, and there is no problem üçÉ Environment: The hotel has a very design sense, not like Intercontinental&#39;s feeling of opening and closing, but it is very layered , drive in all the way uphill, and then turn into a courtyard-type parking lot with a white tower incinerator in the middle. The door into the hotel is designed with the characteristics of ******* architecture. It is very small. It is a screen for a year when you walk in. There is a Buddha statue on the screen. When you turn the screen, you can see the Potala Palace directly. The large water feature left behind can be seen. There are several large red pillars in the hall, which are very imposing. The decoration is to reflect the exquisite ******* style in place. Room: The layout is very reasonable. Open the door and enter the leisure area. The right side is the bathroom, and the left side is the bed and writing desk. The room is large and the bathroom is easy to use. üîîService: The service is very good and has ******* characteristics. 1. Someone in the parking lot guides you to reverse the car. 2. The opposing waiters are all ******* and have a very good service attitude. 3. Check in is fast and soft-spoken 4. A housekeeper will help you with luggage and deliver it to the room, introduce the room facilities, and the housekeeper will add WeChat before leaving the room, saying that you need to contact directly. Big like üëçüèº. My housekeeper is Jinmei, a handsome ******* brother. After checking out, he will come to ask if the stay is ok. 5. The breakfast is the richest and the most exquisite I have eaten in Lhasa. Compared with the Intercontinental breakfast, it is very smashed. I still have to talk about the shortcomings: 1. The details of some facilities look a little old, but the overall maintenance is in place, which will not make people feel very old, and the sense of delicacy is still the same. 2. I think the mattress is not up to the standard of Marriott&#39;s high-end line, and the hotel can consider replacing it in a timely manner. Summary: Although it is an old one among the four luxury hotels in Lhasa, it can still be the best hotel in Lhasa in terms of design, maintenance of decoration materials, service standards, and breakfast.

msg:Lhasa Regis is really good! 1. Location: Near Barkhor Street, you can walk to Jokhang Temple. However, it is very quiet in the hotel, and you can&#39;t feel any gems at all. Personally think the location is better than Shangri-La. Shangri-La is closer to the Potala Palace, but the Potala Palace will not be visited every day. The surrounding prosperous and convenient level is not as good as St. Regis. 2. Design: YYDS. Having lived in Fuchun Mountain Residence, which is also designed by GATHY, it seems that Lhasa St. Regis is better? St. Regis is located in a busy city, and the land conditions are far more restrictive than those in the Fuchun Mountains. But it is small and medium to see big, and it shows more skill. The room type, interior and lighting details are perfect. The materials are solid and well maintained, and it is completely impossible to see that it is a hotel that has been in operation for more than ten years. Public areas, rooms, gardens, and landscapes are everywhere, the most comfortable place in Lhasa. 3. Meals: Only had breakfast. Both Chinese and Western styles are available, including ******* noodles, tsampa, and butter tea. Compared with Songtsam, which has an excellent diet, it is superior in terms of varieties, and its quality is not inferior. There is a Chinese restaurant, a separate entrance and exit, and a private room facing the pool. It should be a good choice for a dinner party in Lhasa. 4. Service: reaching the international five-star standard. Active upgrade, diffuse oxygen supply, late check-out, courtesy and no interruption. Trick: The St. Regis is the least bad hotel I&#39;ve ever stayed in. If you are picky, 1. It takes a long time for the bath water to be hot enough (the bath water even becomes hot enough when it is full, it was only warm water before). Although it can be completely overcome for me, it is worth noting that considering that some guests will have high reactions, the water temperature problem may cause a cold. 2. In terms of service, one-to-one front desk will be arranged as a housekeeper, but in fact, because the front desk is very busy, there is no way to provide real-time service. It is better to call the front desk in time. For some detailed questions, there is no way to accurately understand and answer, such as nucleic acid time, visit requirements of cloth palace, etc. This is determined by the ratio of service personnel to guests, not the problem of service personnel. Just wanted to say that the housekeeper setting itself is a bit tasteless. 3. The swimming pool is not open and there is no gym. Maybe not many people use the plateau? All in all, The St. Regis Lhasa is the undisputed king of Lhasa hotels, surpassing all other luxury and characteristic hotels in all aspects. It is not inferior to all the luxury hotel echelons in China. Personally, I think the price of 2,000 or 3,000 yuan is reasonable. Now, it may be because of the epidemic that living in about 1,000 yuan is too cost-effective. The first choice to Lhasa.

msg:Slightly amazing, very nice hotel. The service is in place. When I arrived, the first day was very uncomfortable because of the high reaction. The lobby manager upgraded the room type on the second day to a fully oxygen-supplied room type, and there is no lack of oxygen when sleeping at night. There is also an infirmary, there is a doctor, you can go to see if you are not feeling well, and prescribe some medicine, which is very convenient. After playing *************, I returned to Lhasa and checked in again. Irene, the hotel lobby manager, was very professional. Knowing that we were going to leave Lhasa the next day, he quickly reminded us to prepare nucleic acid so as not to delay the trip. He also kindly sent a delicious fruit platter, which was great. I will choose to live in St. Regis when I go to Lhasa in the future. The 61-square-meter apartment is really a good comfort for people in a mental state of hypoxia

1. When checking in at the front desk, wait for more than 10 minutes when checking in, and wait while standing.
2. The hotel does not have clear guidelines, and the concierge needs to lead to the room, but this process waits for more than 5 minutes.
3. The most unacceptable thing is that the rooms are arranged 2 floors below the lobby floor. Why don't you ask about this arrangement? If there is a room, do not ask the traveler and give a choice? I don't know what it means to choose a room with no views and views.
Better place to do:
Fruits are welcome, hygiene and decoration are ok.

The sister Tina also took the initiative to add WeChat to help me solve various problems during the trip, and the problems encountered in the hotel were quickly solved. As for the hotel hardware, it really feels a bit outdated, and the worst thing for us southerners is that the hotel air conditioner can't be cooled yet? Is this for cost considerations or what? At the level of St. Regis, I didn't even give the right to turn on the air conditioner. In the hotel room these few nights, it was hypoxic and stuffy, so I finally had to open the window to sleep. The so-called oxygen generator in the hotel is also a tasteless thing. At the beginning of the reservation, I thought it could cover the whole room, but it turned out that it was only enough for one person to inhale, and the oxygen generation effect was very poor. Breakfast is not fresh, I'm a little sorry for the brand of St. Regis, and it needs to be improved. If the service is not good these days, I really want to give this hotel a bad review.

msg:It was the first time I came to Lhasa with my family. In the off-season, Songtsam was still undecided. After a long struggle between Shangri-La and St. Regis, I finally stayed at Shangri-La for the first night and then St. Regis. Compare.
In terms of facilities, Shangri-La is older, and the room hardware is poor, which may be related to the year it was opened.
Aesthetically, my family prefers St. Regis, which has a sense of design. I like Shangri-La's end stool and the design of silver decals. This depends on personal taste. But the wind is generally hidden, and the light will be dim.
In terms of room type, the St. Regis room is larger.
In terms of viewing, there are more than 1,000 viewing rooms in Shangri-La, but they are large and empty. Instead, I feel that there is no other basic room that my family lives in. The layout is reasonable and the senses are comfortable. St. Regis has not lived in a room with a view because he has been to the Cloth Palace, but the restaurant and bar seem to be closer than the Shangri-La View.
In terms of service, Shangri-La is quite satisfactory, leaving no impression. St. Regis Alisa was very warm and cordial, and took the initiative to upgrade a basic room type. A big hotel is no better than a homestay. The staff receives a large number of people every day, and their personalities and moods at the time are different. It all depends on luck. But it is indeed a plus point for St. Regis this time.
For breakfast, the variety of breakfast at St. Regis is almost double that of Shangri-La. The family is very happy.
Comprehensive comparison, the two hotels are OK, fortunately did not encounter problems in hygiene, facilities and services. But under the price difference of more than 100 basic room types, I think St. Regis is better, updated and more comfortable.

The housekeeper Yexi also kindly gave me a lot of fruits, as well as ******* incense sticks and the opening of the Jokhang Temple. In the future, when you come to Lhasa, you must choose St. Regis!

msg:As the best star-rated hotel in Lhasa, it is actually a misnomer.
1. The layout of the hotel is very strange, the lobby is not a**ospheric, and the floor height is very low, which is slightly depressing. There are several elevators, and it‚Äôs very uncomfortable to drag my luggage to find a room. The room layout is even stranger, very eerie and weird, especially the outdated facilities, the curtain is pulled as if sleeping in the mourning hall... Especially on New Year‚Äôs Eve, Miss Susan at the front desk even arranged a room number like 1414, which made people speechless.
2. Facilities: 1. The bed creaks. Once you turn over, the person next to you will definitely wake up. 2. The TV is small and unclear. 3. The hot water didn't get hot for 20 minutes, and I caught a cold the next day.
3. Sanitation: You can look at the yellow stains in the bathtub and the soap stains on the faucet. Is it really worth the 1216 room rate?
4. Service: 1. The lady who checked in for me did not even say a word of greetings, and did not have the professionalism and enthusiasm of a star-rated hotel. She was the worst of the three star-rated hotels in Tibet during this trip. 2. The bath water was not hot in the middle of the night. I complained to the front desk. The front desk said that they would inform the manager on duty to deal with it. However, the manager did not know the next day. 3. I have never experienced the so-called butler service. 4. The front office manager gave a solution on the second day: give dinner and change rooms, hoping that we would stay, but due to a very poor experience in many aspects, we still chose to leave.
5. The whole hotel is very stingy: 1. Tell me that the minibar is free, but the first day is free, and the second day is charged, but in fact, I booked two different room types, and I can also enjoy free when I change rooms, and the hotel so-called My mini bar is just a canned drink such as Coke Sprite Barley. Customers may not drink it, but this kind of speech makes people very speechless. 2. One nasal suction tube is provided in the oxygen supply room, and two in Shangri-La Hotel. 3. Charges for bottled oxygen, Shangri-La Hotel is free. 4. The hotel equipment is not branded, and the Shangri-La Hotel is L‚ÄôOccitane.
The hotel with the highest price and worst experience on this trip, St. Regis really disappointed. I don't understand why there are so many Amway on Xiaohongshu, and how much did you spend on marketing. Maintaining the products well, doing a good job in the service itself, and treating customers with care is the long-term management approach.

1/ There is no vanity mirror in the bathroom of the room.
2/ There is no usb socket at the head of the bed
3/ The door of the shower room cannot be closed properly, and the shower will flood the entire bathroom floor.
4/ The front desk attendant needs to strengthen the training
5/ The hotel rooms are divided into different small buildings. Although the rooms are on the second floor and there is no elevator, it is quite challenging because it is on the plateau.
Others are as expected.

Also, the curtains in the study look a bit weird, or maybe I can't get this aesthetic. Thanks to Miss Fu Ting at the front desk for upgrading the room type. I came to rest and didn't want to go out.

Equipment and Sanitation: Dilapidated vanities; broken faucets; electrical sockets *****ped from walls; stained carpets; dirty floor tiles‚Ä¶
Service: The front desk is really much worse than the Shangri-La front desk! ! The front desk of St. Regis was indifferent throughout the whole process and had a weak sense of service. I said to arrange a room with a better view. The front desk replied - "Arrange it in Building 6", I don't know how to answer the call. I thought to myself, "Oh, this is the first time I've stayed at this St. Regis, I don't know where the 6th building is; well, I'm only staying for one night, that's why you're indifferent."
The little brother of the concierge who helped me with my luggage and took me to the room was the best and most caring service in St. Regis! ! Give 1 point! The service of the restaurant is also good, give it another 1 point!

From entering the hotel to arrange a room, I need a quiet room to be well arranged.
There was a small omission of my luggage at the airport bus stop. They also help with safe retrieval. The room needs a bit of age but is well maintained and comfortable. Wet sprayer and oxygen equipment are ready one by one. There is not much choice to eat but the food made is also up to standard. Anyway, the location of the hotel is good, there are many other options just a short walk away.
This Spring Festival to Lhasa to spend the Spring Festival, I feel very lucky. One of the reasons is living in St. Regis.
Special thanks to two hotel staff: 1) Rames is my housekeeper and takes care of everything personally. Considerate service.
2) Chase (front desk). My questions can be answered professionally.

Thank you St Regis. Will return next time !

The food is abundant and the cuisine is diverse, which is a blessing in Lhasa, where a single fruit and vegetable diet is scarce. The welcome compote has local classic yak yogurt.
The hotel has a dedicated infirmary to serve high-response guests. The rooms are equipped with floor heating, oxygen generators, and humidifiers.
The design is mainly based on ******* style, with a sense of art with multicultural elements, as well as a Thangka art exhibition hall.

And the sandy who received us was also thinking about us everywhere. It was a great stay experience! Highly recommend St. Regis

It's a bit more comfortable to live, in short, a very good stay experience.

msg:It is a business-oriented hotel, which is relatively loveless. Forget it.

No one cares about you when you enter the lobby, and there is no tea. Check in was handled by a lady with a Beijing accent, and her attitude was cold.
Butler service is in name only, there is no such thing.

The lobby is the most beautifully decorated, but I have to complain about the strong smell of vanishing cream. I don't believe it is ******* incense.

The layout of the upgraded suite is quite strange, 50% bathroom + 50% large studio. The bathroom is too big, but there is no small mirror, and there is no exhaust in the bathroom.
The most important thing is that the room is surprisingly stuffy. I feel like I'm going to have a fever inside. It's fine as soon as I get out of the room. It's a taboo to be stuffy in Lhasa, which is hypoxic!
After I told the front desk, they used professional tools to open the window, but they couldn't open it themselves.
Fortunately, the breakfast is quite rich, and the yak yogurt is delicious.
The location is more convenient.

The St. Regis Lhasa objectively says that it is currently the best hotel in Lhasa, because I stayed in the off-season, personally think This price is compatible with the service he provides. As for some comments that his room facilities are old, first of all, this is a hotel that opened in 2010. It can be maintained to this level and it is already considered good in China. If I come to Lhasa again, I personally still choose to continue to stay at the St. Regis.

The room size is quite large, the room can see a little mountain view, the view of the twin room is not very good.

The location of the hotel is good, it is within walking distance from the Jokhang Temple on Barkhor Street, and it is 15 yuan to take a taxi to the Potala Palace. The lobby of the hotel is relatively high. It is a bit difficult to walk in and out. The service staff were very enthusiastic and felt the simplicity and hospitality of the *******s.

There was a little episode when we checked out at the hotel that day (other waiters in the hotel) Failing to handle and feedback our problems in time, which caused us to worry about the flight delay and changed the booking), which caused us to have some dissatisfaction. After Tenzin heard about it, he immediately apologized to us and offered to propose that the next itinerary is willing Dedicated to provide us with pick-up service as compensation. Then, according to our needs, Tenzin Tenzin took time to take us to the airport (it takes two hours to and from the hotel to the airport) when his work schedule was very busy, which made us very touched! Although there is a slight flaw in the experience of staying this time, Tenzin's positive, sincere and caring approach made us feel the professional, proper and thoughtful five-star hotel. The goodwill has been increased and it is worth staying again.
PS: Chatting during the trip to the airport, I learned that Tenzin Tenzin is a handsome local ******* guy who has returned from studying in Canada and majored in hotel management.

üöó Transportation: It only takes 10 minutes to walk to the Jokhang Temple, and the Potala Palace is up to 30 minutes to walk. The transportation is very convenient.

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel has a ******* style from the outside to the inside, with an antique style, a beautiful environment, and scenery everywhere. The oxygen supply room we live in has sufficient oxygen. The room is super large (about 60 square meters), especially the bathroom, which is big enough for walking in it. [Cover face]

üßπSanitation: The bedding and bath towels are very clean, and the hair dryer is Dyson's, which is good. However, both pillows are the same height. It is recommended to change to a shorter pillow to meet the needs of different people.

Others: The breakfast is very rich and there are many types, which is good.

msg:After living in Dangxiong for 2 days, I returned to Lhasa, exhausted physically and mentally, and wanted to find a good hotel for a good rest. So I chose the St. Regis Hotel and came to the front desk. Sandy checked in for us. The service was very good and very enthusiastic. Seeing that my husband and I were traveling with my parents, I took the initiative to help us upgrade the Lhasa suite and gave us yogurt. And the fruits make us who have just returned from Damxung feel particularly warm. Next time I come to Lhasa, I will definitely choose the St. Regis Hotel.

The service is also good. It seems that St. Regis has always been the leader in service. The St. Regis who have lived in several cities are very good.

Alisa Zhuoga from the front desk and Luo Dan from the concierge praised it.

The service at the front desk is very good, especially thanks to the front desk manager Stanley, who is very enthusiastic and caring.

The breakfast variety and service are also very good. For this itinerary, I chose the St. Regis for 3 nights and 2 for Shangri-La. In comparison, the St. Regis Hotel is recommended because the service and hardware are better.

msg:A trip on the go, finally unlocking the Potala Palace
 
For people who love to travel, the attraction brought by Tibet is irreplaceable. Every time Tibet is mentioned, the Potala Palace cannot help but want to visit it.
 
If you have an idea, don't just stay verbal, and you have to arrange a trip that you just leave! Since Lhasa is located on a plateau, if you decide to travel to Tibet, you must make a plan and prepare accordingly in advance.
 
After booking the tickets, it is the problem of the hotel. Every time I travel and stay, I don‚Äôt know how to stay. Originally, the meaning of travel is to relax myself. Only by staying comfortable and traveling can I be more rewarding and motivated. This time I booked the St. Regis Lhasa Resort. This hotel is located on Jiangsu Road, the main road in Lhasa. It only takes 15 minutes to walk to the Jokhang Temple and Barkhor Street. The location is so convenient! Each room type has a large space, so don't be too comfortable living in it. You have all the necessary equipment and service facilities. If you want to shoot the cracked wall of the Potala Palace at night, I suggest you go to the bar on the 6th floor to try it out. The film is really amazing!
 
The Potala Palace must not be missed when you come to Lhasa. As the iconic building of Lhasa, the Potala Palace is the holy place in the hearts of all pilgrims. Of course I am no exception. You must take a few beautiful photos before arriving at the Potala Palace. , But the focus is still on appreciating ******* culture. The route to the Potala Palace is planned. You can follow the tour, don‚Äôt worry about getting lost. There is also a row of prayer wheels beside the Potala Palace for worshipers and tourists!
 
In addition to the Potala Palace, there are many fun and delicious places in Lhasa. It's time to take a walk-and-go trip and let yourself indulge in the beauty of travel~

Compared with other five-star hotels in Lhasa that are cheaper than this one, this buffet breakfast is also average.

At the same time, the facilities are relatively old. In the room I lived in, the kettle could not automatically trip after it was boiled.

Let's talk about the advantages: there is a 24-hour infirmary on the first floor, which cost hundreds of dollars, but it really didn't work. If your reaction is serious, you'd better go to the hospital. Later, our family was really unwell, so we went to a regular hospital to get an injection, inhaled oxygen and prescribed medicine, and it was fine that day.

As the best five-star local, the service attitude is first-class, I want to give full marks to this!

Diana, Sam, and Cizhen from the housekeeping depar**ent are very caring, and many questions are answered in a timely manner.
Recommend everyone to stay here, it is more cost-effective than Shangri-La, and the experience is better.
The hotel‚Äôs breakfast and bar are also good, the bar recommends which one to go to on the first floor, the specials are very good. The view from the sixth floor is fine, but the wine is average.

msg:When I came to Lhasa, I chose St. Regis. After getting off the plane and arriving at the hotel, the concierge helped us to unload the luggage. Two boxes were dragged to the room by one person. The hotel attendant brought yogurt and fruit to the room. I felt warm as soon as I checked in. After staying for three days, the room was beautiful and beautiful. The Potala Palace could be photographed in the bar on the sixth floor. When we checked out, Justin helped us simplify the procedures and gave us a small gift. Memories, next time I come to Lhasa, I will choose St. Regis

msg:The hotel is not bad! After all, it is a pleasant surprise to have such a level in such a remote place as Lhasa.
Very convenient to travel in the city center! It's very close to Barkhor Street, the layout of the hotel room is quite comfortable, but it is estimated that there is not enough manpower to find the lobby and no one can give directions. Haha, the breakfast variety is a bit less and I hope it can be improved.
Miss Irene at the front desk is very nice and talkative! Introduced us to the fun places in Lhasa! I feel much better when I meet someone who can talk about it when I travel. Because I also prepare cakes for us on my birthday, I am really careful and warm, and I will definitely stay at St. Regis next time I have a chance to come to Lhasa! ! !

msg:I stayed at the St. Regis Hotel in Lhasa on July 20, 2021. At 11pm, I found that there were a lot of mosquitoes. I was bitten several times, and the room was facing the street. It was very noisy. It was always the sound of cars and motorcycles. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. . The window was broken and could not be closed. I called the hotel reception 4 times, but no one came to deal with it. Every time I said that the leader was very busy and was checking in. Then a waiter came over and said to change the room. I went to the front desk and found that the leader was very empty. When it was raining, my wife and I walked dozens of meters in the rain. In the lobby, I found that the front desk was very empty and not very busy at all. Very disappointed with the after-sales service of the hotel, this kind of service is not comparable to Samsung. Later, I didn't go to bed until two or three o'clock. Now I need the hotel to give me an explanation. What is the standard of the St. Regis hotel, regarding environmental sanitation and noise control, and why such standard rooms are provided to guests. The above are all facts why the attitude of the service staff is so arrogant.

It's a pity that the itinerary was too tight, and I didn't enjoy the hotel's swimming pool and Chinese restaurant. I will stay here next time I come to Lhasa. The breakfast is very rich~

msg:The first time I stayed at the St. Regis in Lhasa was five years ago. At that time, I felt that the St. Regis Hotel was great. The rooms were super large and the facilities were five-star. Both the lobby and the room design were decorated with rich ******* style. This time I brought my daughter to play, so I just chose to stay again, which is very suitable for vacation. When I first arrived at the hotel, I went to the Chinese restaurant for lunch. The dishes tasted very good and the dining environment was very good. ******* yogurt and fruit were presented in the room. The reception of the little ******* brother was particularly enthusiastic, and he repeatedly urged that the yogurt should be eaten as soon as possible to avoid expiration. The Potala Palace can be seen from the hotel lobby. The location of the hotel is very good, not far anywhere. The next day, I walked to Barkhor Street.

The room has diffuse oxygen from 11:00 to 5:00. In addition, there is a 24-hour system. The oxygen machine, as the first stop in Lhasa, is more at ease. The hotel butler Danny is very considerate and the service is very attentive. He gave small gifts and yogurt in the evening. Jerry is also very enthusiastic.

The room is comfortable and the mattress is comfortable, but the most important thing is that oxygenation in the room is the best choice for new arrivals in Lhasa. If you have no physical problems, you might as well try the golden swimming pool. The spa is also very distinctive. Breakfast is also the best choice in Lhasa. Anyway, I always stay at the St. Regis Hotel.

The bedding is clean and soft, the room has a lot of space, and the bathroom is well designed. Equipped with a humidifier, four bottles of water, two luggage racks, etc. many hotels do not have. There are also welcome fruits, as well as help with luggage. These services and facilities are far beyond the price.
Suggestion: The toilet room can be equipped with a mobile phone holder, and according to the star standard, it should also be equipped with an electronic scale and a cosmetic mirror. Finally, I want to say that the services of Justin and Irene are very good and enthusiastic, and they look good, haha~ There is also a new brother from the maintenance depar**ent who doesn‚Äôt know what to call and is very enthusiastic to take us to take pictures of the beautiful scenery of the hotel~ Come to Tibet St. Regis must experience one night, the most cost-effective of the same level!

msg:On the first day of staying in Lhasa, Regis really felt that the overall environment, hardware facilities, and services of the hotel were really great, so I did not hesitate to continue my stay! When Stanley saw me the next day, he asked me whether my previous high-reflective state was better and whether I had adapted to it. Then he gave a detailed introduction to the surrounding scenic spots of the hotel. Thank you Stanley for making me feel it. St. Regis attaches great importance to and cares for every guest, and I have noticed that every employee I meet in the lobby lounge area, reception check-in area, dining area or on the way back to the room will be very kind Regards, it's really warm. Let's talk about the diffuse oxygen room is really great. The control panel on the wall can intuitively understand the air humidity and oxygen content inside the room at any time. It is very smart! If you come to Lhasa who are worried about the high reaction situation, you will be relieved to choose a diffuse oxygen room. The interior design of the entire room is perfect; Dyson's hair dryer, bose audio, humidifier, etc. can be seen in the details of Regis's emphasis on quality. The breakfast buffet is very rich in variety, which can satisfy the tastes of travelers from different regions. I like the ******* breakfast the most. The ******* breakfast is great! In short, the trip to Lhasa has become more perfect because of living in St. Regis. Next time I will bring my family to Lhasa, I will definitely choose St. Regis!
