msg:I picked this hotel because his location is face directly to the elephant mountain. The service and facilities are excellent but the breakfast is kind of simple. According to the price, they should add more choices for breakfast. The staff are trying to do a good job, I saw they have a training class for English. However, details need to do care. For example, a guy in the breakfast restaurant who coughing all the time but never cover his mouth. I stayed for 5 nights, I saw him every time. For them, they don't realize that is a problem.

I was travelling with my parents and the team were very kind to them and gave them a warm welcome to Guilin which even included a complimentary birthday cake for my father! 
The location of the hotel was excellent. The views from the top floor of the “elephant trunk” really are excellent, as were the views from our rooms. 
Breakfast was a good buffet and a mix of western and Chinese food. The Chinese food menu was definitely more exciting than the western options, but both were good and well enjoyed. The service team were very nice and were able to accommodate special dietary requests. 
I would definitely recommend.

What we enjoyed about this hotel:
Great view of Elephant Trunk Hill and the river from their top floor restaurant
Great location
Good breakfast
Rooms comfortable and reasonably clean
Good service
Gifts from hotel at check in and check out

What needs improvement:
The shower in our room had only very hot water - we told housekeeping staff about it, they said they checked it and it was fine, but it was not. Since our children stayed in another room we were able to compare, the water temperature in our shower room was definitely not normal (way too hot).
Bathroom sliding door did not work properly, very hard to move - housekeeping staff was responsive and said they fixed it. It was a slight improvement but still a bit stuck.

Breakfast restaurant should implement a waiting line during peak breakfast time, and restaurant staff should assign seats. Breakfast started getting crowded after 8/8:30am. At one point I felt we were being forced out of our seats by other impatient guests. I suggest having guests wait in the outside area instead of crowding into the restaurant if it's full.

Having breakfast in the open-air area of ​​the restaurant on the 7th floor can also enjoy the beautiful scenery of Elephant Trunk Mountain and Li River. The hotel's buffet breakfast is very rich, with many styles of Chinese and Western food, and the taste is first-class. A private car was chartered to pick you up from the West Railway Station and go directly to the hotel entrance in 20 minutes. The driver's service attitude was very good. In the evening, a waiter brought sweet-scented osmanthus desserts. There were mangosteen tea sets and Guilin specialty osmanthus cakes in the room. We were also given mangosteen fruit as a small gift, which made us overjoyed. The room is spacious and the environment is comfortable. The elephant-shaped towels in the bathroom and the elephant-shaped tableware in the restaurant are all unique. It is a very good accommodation experience in Guilin and worth recommending!

msg:The view restaurant for breakfast is definitely the best angle to check in at Elephant Trunk Hill, and I booked here for this reason. The breakfast is quite rich, and there are snacks and fruits in the room. The room is relatively small, the facilities are a bit old, the bathroom is not waterproof and odor-proof, and the toilet has a strong odor. The service is average. The room type I booked said that I could upgrade for free, and I reminded the front desk. The front desk said that it was upgraded, but in fact it was still the original room type I booked. It doesn't feel good. It would be better to tell me directly that it can't be upgraded.

The hotel's breakfast and afternoon tea are both in the restaurant on the seventh floor. The restaurant looks out to Elephant Trunk Hill. It should be the best environment restaurant in Elephant Trunk Hill. It is really worth checking in. Although the hotel opened a few years ago, the overall style is relatively stable. Although the hotel is small, the biggest feeling when staying in the hotel is warmth. Everyone greets you warmly, and patiently recommends the surrounding food and scenery. It also provides scenic spot explanation services, but I didn't catch up. I hope I can catch up when I come next time.

msg:This trip to Guilin brought my parents and Xiaobao to stay at Guilin Jingxiang Hotel. The children were happy and the elderly were satisfied.
The location is excellent, 100 meters away from Gate 2 of the Elephant Trunk Hill Scenic Area. The room we stayed in was on the 4th floor, with a good view and part of the Elephant Trunk Hill.
The room is fully equipped, the decoration style is elegant and upscale, clean and tidy, a bathtub can relieve the fatigue of playing, and lying on the sofa to watch the shadow of the elephant trunk tree outside the window.
I would like to thank the restaurant on the 7th floor in particular. It not only occupies an excellent location for viewing the Elephant Trunk Hill and the Li River, but also has an unexpected surprise in service. When we ordered dishes for 3 adults and 1 child, the foreman kept suggesting that I order less, helping to recommend special dishes and non-spicy dishes that children can eat. In the end, he forced me to return a portion of noodles and a dish, saying that we couldn't finish it. Haha, actually I really wanted to try it, but it turned out that the foreman's suggestion was correct. The next day we took the early train to the pier. Breakfast was served at 7 o'clock, but knowing that we were in a hurry, we were allowed to eat before 7 o'clock. Of course, the taste of the dishes was also very satisfactory! The breakfast was also rich enough to meet our needs.
The free travel photography was also very good. The photographer accompanied us to visit the Elephant Trunk Hill and took very satisfactory photos. He sent me the selected negatives on the spot and sent me the refined photos at 2 a.m. on the same day. He worked so hard.
There was a welcome gift for check-in and a small souvenir when leaving. The child liked the elephant doll at the front desk very much, and the front desk staff immediately gave one generously. Although they were not expensive things, the care and sincerity were particularly heartwarming.
I really recommend it. Of course, any service without price is a waste of money. Don't compare it with Banyan Tree. Don't compare it without spending that money. Don't compare it with a budget hotel. You think it must be perfect if it's more expensive. I sincerely say that our whole family is very satisfied with this hotel at this price. I highly recommend it.

The biggest advantage of this hotel is its excellent geographical environment: Elephant Mountain is right at the doorstep, and the whole block is full of greenery. Another unique feature is its rooftop restaurant. In addition to the view, you must try its Chinese food, which is very delicious. The key is that it was originally supposed to be a Western restaurant...so if you want to eat Chinese food, you have to order in advance.

Thank you very much! The hotel has a beautiful environment, clean and tidy, complete facilities, and thoughtful service. The first choice for Elephant Trunk Hill tourism accommodation! 
In addition, the restaurant's meals, whether Chinese or Western, taste very good. We had two dinners here. It was really pleasant to enjoy the Elephant Trunk Hill while eating!

During the Chinese New Year period, due to the There is a lot of traffic and it is difficult to call a taxi in the surrounding area. The soundproofing of the windows is okay and the street is not noisy. The breakfast options are not as rich as those in big hotels, but they are relatively good. Although the view from the rooftop restaurant is not as great as that of the Boyin Hotel, it is It is also very good to see Xiangshan Mountain and the mountains in the distance. Boyin can also see the Sun and Moon Twin Towers. Each person was given a bowl of eight-treasure porridge on the first night and a souvenir after check-out. The overall feeling may be that hotel prices have increased during the New Year. I feel that the price/performance ratio is a bit poor. The main reason for deducting points is that the facilities are old.

And my daughter likes the hotel's breakfast very much. It is not only rich in variety but also delicious;
When checking out, I also received a souvenir from the hotel;
In addition to these, the most important thing is that every staff member you meet in the hotel will take the initiative to say hello or greet you, not only the waiters who clean the rooms and the cleaning staff you meet in the elevator. The staff, even the security guard who parked the car at the door, all had smiles on their faces. After checking out today, the security guard helped load our heavy luggage into the trunk of the car.
Next time I come to Guilin, I will definitely choose Jingxiang without hesitation!

It was the first time I drove through a one-way street in a parking lot and came back. I went down the ba*****t ramp to test my skills.
Breakfast was served at the landscape restaurant on the 7th floor. The landscape of the Lijiang River was very beautiful.

First, the location of the hotel is very good, close to Elephant Trunk Hill, with a good view. In addition, opposite the hotel is the ticket office of Two Rivers and Four Lakes. It is very convenient to enjoy the night view at night. The tea and meal coupons make people feel very warm; third, you can see the Elephant Trunk Mountain when you open the curtains in the room, and even tourists on the mountain can see it clearly; fourth, the hotel's meals are also very nice, and the pizza is great. In short, the first trip to Guilin was very memorable. The food, accommodation and transportation all reflect the charm of Guilin as a tourist city. Like it 👍🏻!

msg:The worst hotel I have ever stayed in in my life!
I spent more than 700 yuan and stayed in a room with a window that happened to open on someone else's balcony. Forget it, considering that the housing supply may be tight during the Spring Festival, I won’t say anything.
But in this kind of weather, it happened to rain, and the hotel actually refused to turn on the heating and air conditioning! This is the first time I have stayed in a room where the heating and air conditioning are not turned on in winter! I called the front desk and was told that the central air conditioner could only adjust the temperature uniformly. Some customers reported that the warm air conditioner was too hot, so the cold air conditioner could only be turned on.
Therefore, during the Spring Festival, the hotel room I stayed in could only turn on the air conditioner in the middle of the night! What a joke I’ve never heard before! I took a video and found that the entire air conditioning switch could not be operated by myself in the room. I was freezing in the room like this!
It can only be said that a hotel like this is opened in such a geographical location and disrespects customers so much, yet the hotel is still at the top of the rankings! What forces are behind this? Is there something fishy about this ranking list? Or can Ctrip’s customers be treated casually? I suggest you check it out.

The lobby is very beautiful and the view from the rooftop is beautiful, so it is enough to go for afternoon tea or a meal, but nothing else is really necessary.
First of all, what does it mean to change the air conditioner in the middle of the night during the hottest time of the year? ? ? ? Too poor to turn on the air conditioner? ? ? ? I was woken up by the heat in the middle of the night. When I got up to adjust the temperature, the "system central control" was displayed! ! ! !
Secondly, the corridor is too small and the room is not soundproofed. You can really hear the opening and closing of the opposite door! ! ! ! Not only at night, but also in the afternoon! ! ! !
If you don't have a good rest, why should you live?

The food shopping list provided by the hotel is very solid, and it is said that you must not go to the Dadongjiang rice noodle shop near the hotel. They are all listed to slaughter customers. We tried it because our children would not want to walk, but they were slaughtered. Not good. The next day, I went to the Chongxin Rice Noodle Main Store recommended by the hotel. It was delicious and cheap, but it was not too far away. It took about 10 minutes to walk;

The location of the hotel is convenient, not far from Chunji Roast Goose and Xiangshan Wharf
But the hotel facilities are a bit old and not very new. It's just Ctrip's 5 diamonds, which still has a gap with the facilities of a serious five-star hotel.

Now is the downside. The summer vacation price is really ridiculously expensive. There are more than 1,800 parent-child rooms. I regret it. I should book two rooms. At the same price, there will be at least two bathrooms. A house price close to 2,000 should be at least a four-star, but it is true that neither the hardware nor the software meet the requirements. The breakfast can be full, and it is ordinary, and there is a night snack with white fungus soup and a fruit plate. The baby elephant will be given to me when I check in, but I didn’t take the initiative to give it to me. I saw the guest next to me and asked me. I also asked if I have children? I booked a parent-child room, my friend. In short, I feel that it is a bit worthless. If it is only doubled during the peak season, then it makes sense. It is really too expensive.

The hotel's catering is not very good. Whether it is Chinese food, buffet breakfast, or afternoon tea, it can only be rated as 2 stars. It is recommended to eat nearby if it is convenient to go out.

msg:The last stop of the trip to Guilin chose Jingxiang Hotel. I have to say that the location of the hotel is really good.

Our itinerary is to drive back to Guilin from Longji Rice Terraces, and then take the plane to leave the next afternoon. For us, it is enough to quietly enjoy the scenery of Elephant Trunk Hill during afternoon tea on the viewing platform on the 7th floor.

It takes about 10 minutes to walk from the hotel to Chunji Roast Goose. It is recommended to go early for dinner, otherwise you will really have to wait in line for a long time.

Every staff member I met in the hotel was very polite and would take the initiative to say hello to us. When I returned to the room at night, I found that the hotel had prepared mung bean soup for us.

The only thing to note is that if you go by car, the underground parking garage will be more difficult to park, and there is only a single lane for the entrance and exit, which requires a little driving skills.

It’s easy to go back to the room to rest by crossing the road. Turn left when you go out and walk to the Two Rivers and Four Lakes and the Sun and Moon Twin Pagodas. The hotel windows cannot be opened but it is relatively quiet. The breakfast is relatively simple and full. The room hardware is a bit old and well maintained In general, the staff are very dedicated, and they have a sense of responsibility in the service with a smile. The good night dessert is also very delicious, thank you. The hotel pick-up service is great. The master waits early.

The rice noodles in the restaurant are pre-cooked and placed there. Naturally, they are not very hot. If you want them, they will add some hot soup for you, so it doesn't taste good.

It is so beautiful to see Xiangshan in the wind. Why has no one noticed the open book bar on the 6th floor, a quiet reading space. The room was also very comfortable. There are recliners and armchairs. I hate the kind of hotel room where you go to bed as soon as you enter the door. A sofa in the room will kill you? I love this hotel so much. The family of three from the Sheraton next door all came to see the scenery and regretted not falling. They say, Nanning in Guangxi, Liuzhou in China, Guilin in the world. This quiet small city is very livable with a blend of landscape and urban residents. like!

  First of all, the location is very good. It can be said that it was repaired on the face of Elephant Trunk Hill.
  The welcome tea is delicious, we ate two and bought a catty to go
  The service is very good. Whether it is the front desk or the cleaning staff, they are very professional, and they will say hello when they meet. When the front desk left, they listened carefully to our opinions and gave us a baby elephant. The cleaning lady passed by and praised me and my girlfriend for looking good.
Very good experience, next time I have a chance to come back

The balcony of the restaurant on the 7th floor can watch the Elephant Trunk Hill up close. The view is very good and it is very good. The booked room is on the 5th floor, and you can see Elephant Trunk Hill from the bay window of the room, but it is blocked by trees.
The hotel service is very considerate. You can pick up the airport for free, and you can also pick up the high-speed rail station. You can also take travel photos. You can take photos at the hotel or go to the opposite Xiangshan Scenic Area. On the day we went, the weather was bad and foggy, but the camera guy tried his best to take a few beautiful photos for us as a souvenir.

I didn't sleep well all night, the air conditioner was not cooling, and I couldn't choose to operate it by myself, so I lost a new fan to blow some air into the room, which was useless. This hotel is the worst I've ever stayed in, and it's expensive! Completely inconsistent with the description! Where did such a high rating come from!

msg:Hygiene management is poor and food is not clean.
Because this hotel is near Elephant Trunk Hill, I made a reservation here.
The weather was very hot on the day of our stay, so we had dessert and ice cream here. As a result, four of the six members of the family suffered from vomiting and diarrhea that night, including the two younger children. The remaining two did not vomit because they did not eat at his house.
After communicating with the hotel, the hotel temporarily arranged to change the room and said that they would give me an explanation. Since it was midnight and the child was still sleeping, they didn't bother too much.
The next morning, the hotel refused to admit that it was their fault and insisted that we go to the hospital. The doctor issued a certificate to prove that we had a bad stomach after eating in the hotel before we could be compensated. But think about it, which hospital would give such a certificate? We were originally here for a trip, and we had to fly back in the afternoon, so we didn’t have time to apply for the hospital certificate they mentioned. Later, I asked the hotel to refund the cost of afternoon tea, and the hotel agreed.

During the communication, I kept restraining my emotions because I had children and I didn’t want to argue. I wanted to resolve the matter as peacefully as possible. In the end, I was not very satisfied with the solution provided by the hotel. So I wrote down the whole process truthfully. I hope the hotel can improve the sanitary conditions in the future. Only honest management can achieve long-term development.

It feels like a management problem. The service staff are very busy, but they may not be sufficient enough to serve so many guests. It's not a problem with the service staff, it can be seen that they try their best. Even if I went after seven o'clock the next day, it was still basically full. Or consider not providing breakfast in all rooms? Apart from breakfast, there is nothing else to choose from this hotel. It is perfect. Any chance in the future, I will still have to stay here, and I recommend it to everyone. The hotel's photo of Xiangshan Mountain is great. But generally speaking, I still give it all five stars, and the stay is quite pleasant.

I especially chose a room with a view of Elephant Trunk Hill. The mattresses are very comfortable (compared with other stores in the back, I can feel it). Hygienic and clean. It was the first time I experienced the photo appoin**ent service provided, and it felt very good. The photographer was very patient. My child was upset and refused to take pictures, so the photographer coaxed them. It’s rare to go to a tourist attraction, and there are professional photographers to help you take pictures. I definitely want to take a few more good-looking photos, and the results are satisfactory.
I think this hotel can be regarded as an Internet celebrity hotel... I also saw pictures and videos posted by others, so I decided to go. I didn't expect the service quality to be so good, it's amazing!

msg:Before reading it, some people suspected that the five-star praise of the hotel was faked. I want to say that my review was not faked. Of course anyone reading this comment can be skeptical.
Location: The hotel is opposite the Elephant Trunk Hill, very close. The room on the fifth floor can see the Elephant Trunk Hill. Fortunately, the room I arranged for me was facing the Elephant Trunk. The children were very happy. The seventh floor is the restaurant of the hotel, and the scenery is not bad, no matter day or night.
Service: The front desk guy and the staff are very polite.
Free: one afternoon tea for two people, one breakfast for two people, small refreshments and fruits in the room, mangosteen tea in the room, 2 elephant dolls, beverages in the room, Yibao water, instant coffee, the hotel provides toothpaste and toothbrush in addition Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, bath salt, and body lotion are also provided (see the previous comments, it seems that only rooms on the fifth floor will provide toiletry sets, please call for details)
Hygiene: I personally think the room is hygienic and clean.
Reminder: Afternoon tea and breakfast have a time limit, no waiting
Appoin**ent: Personally, I think that the photographer Xiao Chen who arranged for me was very serious in the process of taking pictures, has a heart, and the composition of the scene is very good. He can also tell the story of two rivers and four lakes (the one arranged for my friend is not good)
Suggestion: C'estbon water should not be placed on the sink in the bathroom, it is better to place it on the small coffee table in the room.

Staying here has refreshed my understanding of good hotels and good service. Check in gave my little girl a pink elephant and helped me with my luggage to my room. There are luo han guo and exquisite tea sets in the room, which are especially moisturizing on the days of autumn dryness. After playing, there are fruit cakes and warm white fungus soup in the evening. Even if I ordered takeout, I called to confirm and also delivered it for me.
Breakfast is in the restaurant overlooking Xiangshan, where you can see Jingxiang.
If you come to Guilin, unless you don't plan to go to Xiangshan, you must live in Jingxiang.
Unfortunately, the highest score is 5 stars, I think Jingxiang can score 100 points.

We booked a family suite, which was okay. The beds and supplies were good, and the service was in place. There was also free afternoon tea and desserts, and a rich breakfast in the morning. Highly recommended! The price/performance ratio is pretty good!

The hotel is directly facing the most beautiful Elephant Trunk Hill in Guilin. The high-rise room on the 6th floor booked by my parents has an unobstructed view. We only saw the street view of passers-by on the 4th floor, so the price difference is understandable by half!
The service is very good, and the details are in place. Although the room has a sense of age, the beds and bathrooms are very new. They should be newly renovated!
The restaurant upstairs has an infinitely good view, and the price-performance ratio of the afternoon tea set for group purchases is also OK. It is recommended to recommend!
There are also 5 free travel photos. The photographer will take pictures in the scenic spot, and will also be introduced by a small tour guide along the way, and the excess photos will be charged on demand. Give the electronic version and print a set.

After checking in, I found that there are still many surprises: for example, many shapes with elephants as elements; the observation deck on the roof can overlook Guilin City; breakfast will be very good. Local snacks; the bar in the middle of the floor, facing Elephant Trunk Hill, can serve coffee and sweet-scented osmanthus tea, and there are books on both sides. It feels like you can sit for an afternoon. The children lived very happily and had a good sense of experience. It is very suitable for recommending to family and friends who come to Guilin to travel!

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. You can see the Xiangshan Scenic Spot from the restaurant on the top floor. You don't need to buy tickets to go in. Looking at the propaganda picture, I thought that Xiangshan would be lit at night, but it didn't. There were only a few small lights scattered, and the night scene could not be seen.
There is a parking lot, but it will be a bit more difficult for beginners to drive, and it is a bit small. There is no elevator directly to the hotel floor in the parking lot, you have to go up to the lobby first, and then transfer to the elevator to go back to the room.
The room light is too dim, you can install a brighter room light to make it look brighter. The towels in the bathroom are folded into the shape of a baby elephant, which is very cute.
There are a lot of restaurants nearby, and the hotel's breakfast is also good, with many varieties. But the dinner is not good, the price is low, and the taste and texture are not good.
Walking to the nucleic acid testing point and watching the night view of the Sun and Moon Tower are very close and convenient.

Unfortunately, during the epidemic, the park did not have a light show and could not see the night view, but the scene of the rising sun and the changing clouds was super beautiful. When checking in, the little brother at the front desk gave two children two elephants, afternoon tea coupons, and also waived the children's breakfast fee. The children were very happy! For our two small rooms, the two small rooms are slightly smaller. We originally wanted to add a bed, but after communicating with the hotel, the sofa can be used as a bed for children, and it was very considerate to add a bed end stool to increase the width, and let my aunt help lay it out. Bed sheets and bedding saved us money. The room also provides fruit snacks and Guilin specialty Luo Han Guo tea, and the toiletries are actually L'Occitane! I am also very grateful to the staff Meng Yuda who has been patiently replying and helping in a timely manner, and the aunt in the guest room who helped to dry the clothes, and also helped to dry the clothes in the sun when cleaning the room. So I decided to stay for another day, except that the restaurant on the 7th floor was a bit hot for breakfast, it should be more comfortable at night 😂

        Go out of the hotel and go to the right. After crossing the Wenchang Bridge, you will find the Elephant Trunk Hill Park. When you enter the park, you can wait until the top of the Elephant Trunk Hill and overlook Guilin City. Or on the way to Love Island, take pictures with the nose arch of Elephant Trunk Hill as the background. Due to the epidemic, there are very few tourists in Guilin now. I saw a lot of tour guides introducing the scenic spots in Guilin live by the Li River. They are really hardworking and admirable. I hope that there will be better measures to prevent and control the epidemic in the near future. The tourism industry will recover soon.

The room is quite exquisite, and there are welcome fruits (maybe it is exclusive to Ctrip?). From the front desk to the room attendants, restaurant waiters are very polite and warm, a pleasant encounter! The only small flaw is that the breakfast is a little simpler, which may also be the cause of the epidemic

msg:The facilities are old, but the location is really good. If you want to see Xiangshan, you can choose this hotel. The breakfast is good and rich, but the service and other details are not up to the standard of a star-rated hotel. It may also be that the service of other hotels in Yangshuo, Guilin, a few days ago is too good, there is a comparison... In addition, the aunt came during the Spring Festival. Fruits and snacks are delivered to each room, which is highly praised. The top-floor restaurant has a relatively high consumption, and the taste is average. It can be considered for the sake of the scenery~

And it is equipped with a special viewing cafe, and the landscape western restaurant on the 7th floor is also perfect. It is recommended to vomit blood.

There is no one on the 7th floor platform, which is better than the location of the No. 1 viewing platform in the scenic spot. In addition, the breakfast is also very rich.

1. There is a special car to pick up and drop off from the high-speed rail station, which is very good.
2. It is quite satisfactory if it is hygienic, it is still very clean visible to the naked eye, and there is no peculiar smell
3. There is a lot of noise outside the windows under construction, which affects taking a nap. The only thing i feel bad
4. The front desk service is very good, the hotel also delivered fruits and pastries, the pastries are so delicious, the taste of childhood, Guangdong also has it, but I forgot what kind of cake is called
5. The types of breakfast are quite rich, both Chinese and Western styles. The restaurant is on the top floor and you can see Elephant Trunk Hill. Tickets are directly saved. The afternoon tea at Meituan is not expensive, it is worth a try. Drinks in the room are free, not bad

The location of the hotel is unique, the staff have a strong sense of service and a good attitude, especially the doorman and receptionist. The only disadvantage is parking. The underground parking lot has a narrow entrance, which tests vehicle skills and does not have an elevator. It is best to take off your luggage first.
You can have Guilin rice noodles for breakfast.

The service is very, very good, especially the skinny beauties at the front desk, thank you for your smile! The Elephant Mountain is super beautiful from the observation deck of the hotel restaurant! There are not many types of hotel breakfast, but this bowl of rice noodles definitely conquered my stomach! Hahaha😁 is so delicious😋😋😋😋How many times better than the rice noodle shop outside! Stay here next time you come back~

You can directly see Xiangshan on the opposite side and sit here. Especially the sunset is very beautiful, it feels very beautiful and leisurely, and it feels like a holiday~~This is really difficult for non-resort hotels~~So I am very fortunate to choose here~ and the hotel also provides a caring pick-up The airport service is very convenient for tourists who have just arrived in Guilin~ next time if you live in Guilin, you will definitely choose Jingxiang~~!

桂林璟象酒店位置得天獨厚，毗鄰象鼻山公園和灕江，距離高鐵站也方便。房間透過窗户即能欣賞象鼻山一角。酒店7樓自助餐廳提供特色桂林米粉（乾粉&濕粉），露天光景台，無限桂林山水一覽無餘，物超所值。這次出差柳州，半夜臨時中轉桂林，第二天一大早去高鐵，時間太過倉促，下次有機會再來深度遊。

msg:旅行的話，非常非常推薦這家酒店。
一，地理位置絕佳，非常適合帶長者小孩這一類型的旅遊，不用走太多路。酒店對面就是象鼻山景區（入口要往前再有一段距離）。如果訂的view比較好的街景房，在房間就可以看到象鼻山。下面這張照片是在酒店早餐餐廳外的露台拍的，視線很棒，俯瞰桂林。
二，酒店所在這條街就是市區，非常熱鬧接地氣，晚上很多小攤，很多唱歌的人。煙火氣十足。飯店也很多。（千萬不要在酒店附近幾家飯店吃飯，先不説加錢，難吃得要死，就是騙遊客。啤酒魚都沒煎，腥腥的就端上來。具體在大眾點評搜查一下）
三，酒店出門，一路上有很多旅行社，可以現場買兩江四湖的夜遊或日遊票，很方便。（一個人220，可以看看其他渠道有沒有更便宜的）
四，酒店服務非常好，從門僮，前台小姑娘到客房打掃衞生的阿姨們，以及早餐廳工作人員，都非常禮貌友好。這也適合長者小孩，起碼不會糟心。酒店有送餐機器人，太累不想出門吃飯，點外賣，機器人會送上來。
五，設施方面，因為是老酒店，已經略落後了，房間空調聲音也有點大。
其他方面，桂林風景美，但整體不是旅遊體驗特別好地方。春節期間坐幾次出租車都被詐了點小錢，就是你用滴滴約的出租車，出租車是自己計費，下車後司機在軟件自己輸入價格。但是你在滴滴付款的價格比你下車時的價格多幾塊，比如，我到地方了，下車時計價器顯示82，如果在我下車這1-2分鐘跳一下表，多1-2塊都能理解，但是你收到的賬單一般是85或者86-87。錢也不多，差距不大，也沒有證據和滴滴argue這個小事，但是碰到好幾次，有點小噁心。希望大家不要遇到，或是到地方他就讓他把票發出來，發送賬單。

msg:桂林市內非常推薦的入住酒店，乾淨衞生，外加非常寬敞。我是淡季來入住的，服務質量非常好。
優點：
距離象鼻山百米內，窗外就是景色，住在畫裏；早餐特別豐盛，七樓的露天平台是欣賞美景絕佳場所；洗澡的水壓也非常滿意；前台的飲料小吃都可以免費使用；酒店的裝修還算比較精緻，不算陳舊，很温馨，尤其是落地窗，隱約可見象鼻山景觀；相比雙塔附近的酒店，我比較了很久，還是選擇了這裏，因為自然景觀永遠比人造景觀美，實際入住感受證實了選擇；距離杉湖雙塔、兩江四湖、東西巷都不遠，我們是步行遊玩的；服務很周到，給我們免費接機和升級房型，離開的時候，還給我們贈送了羅漢果禮包🎁

遺憾：
沒多住幾晚，各方面都很滿意。剛開始預訂房間的時候，有三個同價位酒店對比，地接小哥果斷推薦我們選擇這裏，確實很滿意，同行的爸媽也都灰常滿意。

總之，我會向親朋推薦這間酒店的。

msg:首先説位置，無敵的存在，酒店的隔音不錯，衞生間裏無水聲，門外聲音也很少傳入，再説服務，五星酒店也不過如此，服務的成敗在於細節，這方面酒店做的尤為出色，我喝不慣酒店的水，自己外面買了兩瓶農夫山泉，神奇的是每當我喝完就會出現新的農夫山泉，小瑕疵是有的，潮濕的城市裡房間還是有點異味的，提出給我換房間，我衹要了空氣凈化器滿足心理安慰，因為這種味道在其他室內地方也常出現，算是“地方特色”了，會強烈推薦給親朋，如果再來，還會入住。

樓頂的餐廳可以直接看到象鼻山全貌，位置一絕。
房間很大，裝修和衞生都不錯，乾濕分離，洗漱台很大也很亮堂這個我喜歡。喜歡後來換的蕎麥枕，本來還想買一個帶回去，結果走的匆忙都忘了。
早餐種類不多但是還可以。

早飯：可圈可點，有油茶和米粉，因為要早點出發去陽朔所以吃早飯的時候還看到了日出
唯一的不足，就是餐廳點菜居然要10%服務費，是點單之後才發現，雖然酒店入住客人八五折。但是我覺得服務費這種東西，給外國人用用差不多

酒店的服務果然名不虛傳，所有的工作人員都會主動打招呼，可以説做到了顧客至上。入住那天我們的房間太熱，空調打不下來，酒店二話不説就給我們換了房間。特別要感謝前台小姐姐小張，耐心地帶我們看換的房間，還幫我們一起拿行李，最後換的房間也很滿意。
酒店的位置非常好，正對象鼻山，不用爬山也能觀賞到象鼻山美景。酒店周圍遍佈網紅餐廳以及景點，步行可達很多著名景點如日月雙塔、靖江王府、正陽路步行街等。
下次如果有機會再去桂林，還會選擇這家酒店。

      酒店位置不錯，全桂林最靠近象鼻山的地方了，算是把小學時代的書本“重温”了一遍，酒店出腳也方便；房間因為在二樓，被窗外的一個立面和樹葉幾乎擋了視線，為什麼不把窗户開一個進出門，然後把窗户外圍擺兩張小椅子當陽台呢？那樣感覺應該好的多。
     套房不錯，尤其是兩個衞生間，讓帶小孩的家庭有些驚喜，相互不幹擾。酒店服務也蠻好。
      7樓餐廳絕對是亮點，不想爬象鼻山的遊客，直接就餐時可見到早晚的象鼻山，絕對是最佳角度了。

早餐很豐富，非常好！！！而且酒店可以預約免費接機，我的飛機晚點了，師傅等我到了直接送我去酒店。這一點也很好。
入住的時候前台會給周圍好吃的攻略，很貼心，也有手寫的歡迎卡片和歡迎水果。雖然住了一晚，下次有機會還會再來。

向西大約五百六百米就是椿記燒鵝中山路店，最好提前預約。提前辦理會員可以打九五折。
預訂房間後可以到機場或高鐵站接機站，需要提前48小時預約。
入住有歡迎水果和小糕點，住了三天，送了兩張下午茶票，酒店含早餐，早餐自助，中西品種比較多，有現做的桂林米粉，有煎雞蛋，但不是當場現做。
酒店的工作人員包括客房服務人員都非常有禮貌，房間的衞生打掃的很乾凈。配備的洗浴用品是比較好的品牌。
五樓還有一個帶有圖書的敞開式休息廳，配備的有自助咖啡機、小點心，從那裡也可以看到象鼻山和灕江，可惜的是我們沒多餘時間享用？

房間差距挺大的，當然是越貴越好，主要是觀景角度出發。但是這個時段房源緊張，我的房間並不能看到什麼，比較遺憾。

msg:酒店前台很貼心，客房乾淨衞生，服務人員對我們關於旅遊的問題，熱心回答，房間雖然年久，但勝在衞生和位置非常好，房間可以看到半個象鼻山，酒店頂層可以看到象鼻山全景，我們訂的房間有含一份下午茶，上頂層去吃時，不知道為什麼服務員不讓我們坐外面觀景台，説有人預約，我後來問一位很瘦的男士服務員，他説可以隨意坐，並熱心給我們拿了茶點，之前那位服務員，全程沒有笑臉，問我們是不是旅行社預訂的，給人體驗很不好，請認真對待每一位客人，不要因為他可能是旅行社預訂就有所區別對待，每一位來酒店的客人，都是經過認真挑選才入住的，希望都能得到應有的服務！我是15號入住貴酒店，希望酒店能對當天觀景台的服務人員該表揚的表揚該培訓的培訓。

酒店對面馬路就是象鼻山景區，左手走過去就是日月塔，周邊吃的選擇很多，步行街也不遠，走個15分鐘不到。酒店去哪裡都方便~

1）酒店位置在象山旁邊，酒店天台直接看象山，比在公園裡看到的大象還正呀！
2）因為是淡季，給我們升級了房間，打開窗簾就是象山，還真是物超所值了！
3）酒店提供免費停車，開車去可以提前和酒店前台做備註！
4）酒店的早飯也很豐盛，每一個服務員都和藹可親，住了三天很舒服！
5）推薦大家想買羅漢果就買酒店的那種，我們入住後喝了覺得好，去街邊買發現完全不一樣，酒店的貴一點但是味道很好，街邊那種真的不要隨便買了，會被騙錢
