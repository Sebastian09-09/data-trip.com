The service staff is also very enthusiastic. The breakfast is particularly good. I ordered three servings of beef noodles and four servings of wontons.
The afternoon tea is very exquisite, and there are souvenirs. The braised pork in the lunch set is great!
It is very convenient to walk to the Xizha Scenic Area in 3-5 minutes.

Definitely recommend friends and customers to come and play! 😀

We stayed in a loft room with a large terrace. The only drawback was that it rained that day, otherwise we could have a cup of coffee and look into the distance. By the way, the coffee in the room was good. We came to Wuzhen for the Mu Xin Art Museum, which was closed on Monday. The housekeeper told us to go there the next day. When we checked out, we could leave our luggage at the front desk and come back to pick it up after shopping. We could also park our car at the B&B, which was very user-friendly.

I was quite surprised when I came in. The hotel is very large, has a sense of design, and the environment is beautiful. When I was about to go out for dinner, I found that there was a restaurant in the hotel. I ordered a few dishes. They all suit my taste, especially the braised pork, which is fat but not greasy and delicious. I packed up a portion the next day. When I left, the hotel also gave me a souvenir, which was full of sincerity. I will come again next time if I have the chance. Great🎉

In terms of the hotel environment, the hotel covers a large area, with several 2-3-story rooms. The building is very design-oriented and has ingenuity in all aspects.
In terms of room comfort, we lived in the attic, and my parents lived on the second-floor balcony. In general, each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The attic is very unique. It will be hot in summer, but it is just right on this day. The design of the window is very interesting. It is like a lamp when there is sunlight blocked by a bamboo basket. The balcony where my parents live is better ventilated and more comfortable. In general, I am very satisfied.
At the end, we were given souvenirs when we left the hotel, which was very considerate. I will choose this place next time I come to Wuzhen.

Quite a few friends choose to stay in the Xizha Scenic Area. I also asked about it. The tickets are 20% off, which only saves 30 yuan. However, the B&Bs and hotels in the scenic area are much more expensive.
This hotel pays great attention to the design of the rooms and public areas, as well as the environment.
I checked into two rooms on Thursday and both were upgraded. I was given a souvenir when I left. The surrounding restaurants are really affordable.

msg:I am a frequent visitor to Wuzhen. I have stayed in B&Bs and Alila. This time it is a designer-themed hotel that was bought during Double Eleven. It is not unusual in Wuzhen where B&Bs are everywhere, but the simple black decoration is still very eye-catching. .

Now that I’ve finished talking about the advantages, let’s start talking about why I only gave it 1 star.

1-The room is small

The order stated 25-30 square meters. I also looked at the review pictures and thought it should be good, but in fact, the room was very small! There is a double bed, a bay window and the rest is the toilet.
The toilet faces the window, which is very uncomfortable. I think it may be because of the coupons that the room given to me is small, which is understandable. But at the same price, I believe you can definitely find bigger and better hotels/B&Bs in Wuzhen!

2- Room smell

There was an indescribable smell as soon as I entered the room. I initially thought it was the smell of dust from not opening the window for a long time. Until the air conditioner was turned on, a smell of toilet sewers hit my face. This was one of the reasons why I didn't sleep well at night. Later, I Only then did we realize that their toilet was directly opposite our window.

3- Room air conditioner

The air conditioner in the room was unusually loud. I saw other guests mention this in their reviews, but because it was minus 7 degrees Celsius when I went there, I had already opened the window due to the smell in the room. It was unrealistic not to turn on the air conditioner! This is also the direct reason why I didn’t sleep well all night!

4- The bathroom water is small

The bath water in the bathroom is very small. It is unrealistic to take a warm bath in such a cold weather! Shivering from the cold! I really can’t believe how old the facilities are in a modern hotel!

5- Chris**as music

It was Chris**as when I went there, and the same song started to play from 9 a.m. to the evening. Two large speakers were placed next to the hotel room, and they continued to play! You can hear it clearly even if the window is closed in the room. It wasn't until we returned to the hotel in the evening that we couldn't bear it anymore and asked to close it.

6- Breakfast

The climax came. Breakfast was a set menu, but I ate unidentified hairs. The male waiter who made our coffee went to smoke nearby. We called another waitress at the bar and showed her the poached eggs with hairs and they were not. Floating on top, it's really inside the egg whites of fried poached eggs. The waitress didn't even say sorry, she just told me that she would tell the kitchen! Excuse me? I'm not asking you to compensate. The simplest sentence is "I'm sorry. Is it worth it?" I am simply speechless!

Before we left and checked out, the front desk asked us how our stay was, and we could only say lightly that it was not as good as we imagined!

facility:
The overall design has a sense of design, Huizhou style, restrained and refined. The details are also well done, the Dyson hair dryer, bedding, and disposable items are all of good quality. Children's toothpaste, toothbrushes and children's slippers are also provided.

There is an outdoor courtyard and a public study room. The courtyard is a comfortable place to sit and have a cup of tea and coffee, and the children can run around freely. There are design books and children's picture books in the study room, and there is a row of long tables in the middle. The child likes this chess table so much that he comes to play chess every night when he lives here. He really enjoys it.

The service is gentle and attentive, the moisturizing effect is gentle and the hygiene is good. On the last day, I met the boss and gave a brief introduction to the design and renovation of the hotel. Regarding the price, just in time for the event, it is quite cost-effective. The slight flaw is that the air conditioner is a bit loud at night. Just in time for the cold days, I turned it off at night.
The overall experience of staying here is very good, very artistic and Wuzhen~

Would it be awkward for a couple who just met? 2: The key point is that it is hard to get out of bed. The middle of the pillow is high and hard and the top is slanted when placed on it.

It was a miserable life. 3: The environment, except for the courtyard, which looks good when taking photos, is actually a very average place. The area is not big, and there is no soundproofing. Children can run around and hear everything clearly. 4: Bicycles No one told us what afternoon tea was, and no one told us to pick it up. When we come to Wuzhen, we have to go to the scenic spot. In fact, it is recommended to stay inside and take our time to explore. When we went in to play, we saw a very good hotel package. The five-star price is eye-watering.
I don’t know what those good reviews are about. I was just in a hurry this time. I read the reviews and they were all good reviews. I didn’t look at the hardware facilities. What you experience when staying in a hotel is the hardware facilities, so the hardware is too important. A good hotel is recharging, a bad hotel is fatal. On our way back, we almost fell asleep while driving. I don’t know if we can be seen by everyone. I think I can help a few or a dozen people.

msg:This time I chose a B&B with a great sense of design and appearance. It is located on a very quiet street, only a few minutes' walk from the scenic spot. The decoration style of the entire B&B is very unique, incorporating many modern elements and local culture, making people feel very comfortable and stylish.

The room I stayed in was very spacious, fully equipped, and very clean and tidy. The color matching and furniture furnishings of the room are very elegant, making people feel very warm and comfortable. In addition, the sound insulation effect of the room is also very good, I can rest peacefully here.

The service throughout the B&B was very attentive and the staff was very friendly and professional, making me feel very welcome. Not only did they help me solve all my problems, they also recommended some very interesting local attractions and food to me so that I could get to know the city better.

Overall, this B&B is great. Its design, appearance, comfort and service quality are all excellent. If you want to spend your vacation in a quiet, comfortable and stylish place, this B&B is definitely a very good choice. I highly recommend this B&B to anyone looking for quality and style.

The collection of books in the book bar was very special. We also took photos of Hanfu in the hotel. After checking out, the store also gave me a souvenir, and the little guy was very satisfied👍

The details also reflect the exquisite fashion style! Overall, it has more exquisite details than a B&B renovated from a residential building! More natural and cultural than traditional hotels! It’s a very good choice!

There are really too many people in Wuzhen during the National Day. Fortunately, the hotel is quiet and comfortable.

The store owner helped upgrade the room I booked.
Especially room 1002 is comfortable and has a small balcony. It is a good place to listen to music when the restaurant is singing in the evening.
I will choose this hotel next time I go there

3⃣️It is very close to the entrance of Wuzhen Xizha Scenic Area, convenient for travel, and the accommodation environment is quieter than most hotels/B&Bs in the main scenic area;
4⃣️There are several Hanfu rental photography shops within a ten-minute walk. It is very convenient if you need makeup or make an appoin**ent for a photo shoot.

After so many years, it is the first choice when you come to Wuzhen. It is very close to the scenic spot, and it takes only 5 minutes to walk there; the overall environment of the hotel is very clean and quiet; the hotel facilities are also very complete, and the children had a great time playing in the swimming pool; in the evening, there is a little brother at the door for dinner Playing self-singing, the sound is very nice, accompanied by cicadas, it feels too summer... After dinner, there is a projector to watch movies~ The next day's breakfast was also a bit of a surprise, a big bowl of noodles, ingredients Also too much. There is also a big gift when you leave the store 🎁 which is great~

The rooms are very clean and tidy. The scent of shower gel, shampoo, and hand sanitizer is very high-end. Needless to say, there are many other facilities inside. It is full of courtyards and green plants. If you don’t go to the scenic spot to make tea and even play music on the equipped stereo, you can stay in the room for a day. It is very quiet and has a sense of seclusion away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The store service is very good. The room restaurant is also very good. The exquisite afternoon tea in the all-inclusive package is also very rich! I have to say that there is a tree with sweet orange blossoms. Every time I pass by, I can smell the faint smell of orange blossoms. I specially took pictures and made this flower. It tastes like sweet orange essential oil. It is very, very healing! Partners who love nature must experience it, it will bring you an experience beyond expectations
Facilities: complete, high-end, textured, deep into the details
Hygiene: very clean and hygienic
Environment: Tranquil, mysterious, simple and natural

院落美麗幽靜、且充滿小野趣；房間私密性很好，內部的傢俱等質量考究（雖然不是新開的，但有些好品質的東西沉穩耐用）。
服務員們都十分熱情，有求必應。
整體位置的話離西柵最近，到東柵和南柵老街也不遠，步行溜達可達的距離。
推薦！
p.s.如果攜程上有套餐的話果斷不要錯過，性價比可。
房間圖片忘拍了，吳家巷房間很典雅寬敞。酒店內景色都在老式照相機來不及導出；放兩張酒店牆頭的照片吧，可以意想下其內部隱約內斂的美。

msg:設施：一般，有些舊，很多同價位酒店民宿提供的物品，都沒有。房間一個亮一點的燈都沒有，黑漆漆的。

衞生：一般，剛入住房間就看到一瓶喝了一半的礦泉水在窗邊。

環境：停車位很少，車位很擠。

服務：還行吧。但標明寵物友好，卻要收寵物清潔費很不合理。人家其他高端民宿都是説按金，退房確認沒問題會返還。衹能説老闆格局不夠。

酒店的服務也是值得一提，所有工作人員笑臉相迎，主動搬行李，主動提供小童服務，臨走時還送上一份大大的伴手禮以及母親節的鮮花。
總之無論從酒店離景點的地理位置，還是服務設施，以及環境衞生都是非常值得再次入住的，期待下一次與堯珈的不期而遇。

早餐品種不算多，但質量挺好，服務周到。民宿距西柵四百多米之遙，走幾分鐘即到。距東柵和老街約800餘米，地理位置極為優越。
譚家棲巷本身即是一個處處美景的所在。因為年還沒有過完，服務人員不算多，但都盡心盡力有求必應。院子內有處小沙龍，內有書案書架，大人孩子靜坐片刻可以調節心性。院裏有三輛復古自行車，悠悠然騎幾分鐘讓半大男孩充滿愜意。屋裡每天會備咖啡和水果，硬件上吹風機、拖鞋、洗漱用品都上佳，中央空調，房間很暖，不用擔心温度的問題。
走的那天恰逢上元節，前一晚入住的人開始多了起來。這是一次沒有被辜負的選擇，計劃五一時錯峯再來，依然希望駐足堯珈，與這間温情滿院的民宿再度相約。

房間是我喜歡的高層高，一次性拖鞋牙刷質量都特別棒。
有一位超級熱情的前台小姐姐，準備了顏值天花板的花花。
有一位靦腆前台小哥哥，話不多，但是默默幫我們拎行李到房間。
整體環境好好，乾淨衞生，超讚。
還有離西柵很近，走過去就OK。

酒店共三家庭院房，其中1301的庭院佈局和環境是最好的，庭院裏有棵很大的香樟樹。特別是午後陽光温柔，斜射在樹影斑駁的牆上地上，安安靜靜的，那感覺別提有多美好了。

酒店設施和裝修設計完全達到五星級水準，特別是細節，茶具杯具精緻，床的被子輕薄舒服，有記憶枕頭，甚至牙刷梳子和一次性的拖鞋都是質量都很好，可以説細節很用心

疫情原因，酒店裡入住率不高，但服務品質一直在線。特別是一位工作人員小姐姐服務特別好，知道寶寶愛吃哈密瓜，切了滿滿一盆給他，寶寶高興極了。送的下午茶也是誠意滿滿，這個價格真的是性價比天花板了

個人對烏鎮的喜歡超過任何一個古鎮，烏鎮有一種大氣的美，温婉清澈，煙火人間，無論白天或者晚上都美的讓人不願離開

譚家棲巷，烏鎮最好的選擇

下午茶的內容很豐富，糕點乾果水果都有。早餐很豐富，管家會先和客人確定好用餐時間，送餐的服務員很客氣地詢問是否還需要添加。
午餐也包含在房費內，去的是離店300多米的“烏鎮印象”。因為訂的是兩間房，所以可以選擇一個套餐，一個特色煲。菜量不小，做得也很對胃口。
臨走的時候還送了伴手禮，自製的綠豆糕。

推薦的烏鎮印象餐廳不錯，去了兩次
酒店整體設計比較硬朗，都是直線條，內部景觀也錯落有致，有一個書屋特別贊，書很豐富，還有一個角落全部是小朋友的繪本，故事書
房屋空間大，複式結構，適合年輕人打卡拍照

槽點:
1。不推薦帶長者孩子的選擇帶樓梯的複式結構房間，可能是為了美觀，包括樓梯，浴缸，牆體所有的稜和角都設計得特別尖鋭鋒利，特別是樓梯，金屬的邊條鋭利得像刀鋒一樣（請參考配圖）孩子長者萬一摔倒碰到，受傷風險非常高。
2。5星的設施，民宿級別的服務。送嬰兒床來的大叔，穿着濕鞋就直接進房間;莫名其妙的給了浴缸用的一次性套子（巨大的塑料袋，類似於公共衞生間的一次性坐便套），需要自己安裝使用，打掃房間的時候，阿姨也不會收拾使用過的浴缸套。
3。內部的培訓不充分，對服務項目的説明不一致。在房費裏包含的下午茶，每個部門，每個人的解釋都不一樣。
#入住時的前台説，下午茶在吃早餐的餐廳，下午2點開始4點結束;
#第二天，到了餐廳，被告知，這是吃飯的地方，沒有下午茶;
#再回到前台，第一個遇到的服務員説不知道
#另外一個人説衹有入住當天有下午茶，第二天沒有;
#過了4點，前台又聯繫説，有下午茶，可以送到房間;
#送來了之後發現，沒有咖啡，反饋後，説會再送過來;
#最後咖啡送到房間是晚上19:30。
如果是因為春節人手不夠，臨時安排的服務人員，最好也做好最基本的培訓。

整體感覺這個酒店並不是用來住的，是藝術品。

一剛開始看到庭院房，沒想到有這麼開闊的視野。
入住的時間還很早，因此院子裏沒什麼人，正好方便我在院子裏聽音樂辦公。
酒店硬件很不錯。喜歡石英槽浴缸。
軟裝看得出也很用心了，都是定製的浴巾，Dyson的吹風機。
管家服務，和推薦的餐廳也很好。
最後送了伴手禮的綠豆糕還來不及吃。
下次和朋友來，還會再來住住其他的房型。

最喜歡的是酒店的硬件，不僅設計風格經典雋永，各項設施使用起來也十分舒服：比如加温的馬桶圈、床頭兩側的插座、內里加絨的浴袍…

服務也不錯，從大堂開始遇到的每個工作人員都很負責，如果態度能更主動一些就更好了～

早餐的小餛飩好吃，餐廳味道也不錯。

親子的遊樂設施不多，但質感都很好，小朋友也可以玩一陣子了。

好久沒有寫點評誇讚的沖動了，給大家一個參考吧～

msg:如果作為一家民宿算是非常出色的。但是作為平均房價1000元以上的酒店我認為還是有不少提升的空間。
優點：硬件整體優秀，房間很新但沒有潮濕或裝修的味道。備品質感很好，院子很安靜感受不到外面烏鎮門口的嘈雜。前台人員服務態度非常好。距離西柵景區步行三分鐘就到很方便，周圍餐廳也很多，酒店也提供到烏鎮汽車站的專車接送。
缺點
硬件
1.我住的是獨院，但是院子裏除了房間門口的一盞燈以外並沒有其他照明設備，所以在夜晚想要做在院子裏看看夜景或者吹吹風衹能摸黑，不太方便。
2.院子的柵欄門門口沒有門鈴，整個房間也沒有可以標明請勿打擾的標誌，導致保潔會隨意進入院子和房間，並且是在房間大門和窗户正對着床的情況下，對客人的私隱不是很尊重。
軟件
1.前台會在早餐即將結束的時候給還沒有吃早餐的客人房間打電話，這個看似貼心的舉動在我看來非常沒有必要。連續兩天我都在睡眠中被吵醒，出門時特意跑到前台提醒第三天才沒有繼續打。
2.對於保潔員工的培訓應該更到位一些。第一天下午我在睡午覺就有阿姨進到院子裏來打掃，並且在窗簾沒拉的情況下往裡看。其次開夜床不是衹把床上用品擺整齊就可以，垃圾沒倒桌面沒有整理飲用水沒有補充連拖鞋都和我離開房間時一樣散落在地上，我認為是非常不專業的。
3.離店的時候發票第一張開錯了税號，第二張把密碼區給折了，也是有點無語。
再來烏鎮我應該還是會選擇這家酒店，衹不過希望下次來的時候提到的這些問題能有所改善。

據聞這是由百年譚家橋村改造而成，是烏鎮第一個村落型設計酒店、餐廳、書屋、展廳、茶室等十大生活空間分佈串聯。

🍃環境：樹🌲🌳與水景的搭配滿是慵懶暇意得度假⛱️感。衹有38套客房，各種樣式都有，房間內的家居軟裝都是高定，質感滿滿的沖擊，簡約風不失時尚。

🔔服務：接待我們的服務員非常有耐心給我們介紹、講解、推薦、引路、觀看、挑選，是我們感受到他的熱情，酒店的熱情。這就是服務體現酒店品牌的定位和價值。

在晚餐時有點小插曲的發生，他們都立馬給予我們滿意的解決，（但餐廳的服務流程還真的有待提高）

特別推薦：酒店餐廳出品的“冰花燉雪燕”，超喜歡，第一次嘗試如此新鮮新韻的做法，而且手法做的非常特別，口感讓我一口留戀。

3,本次住宿非常不滿意的一點 當時定這家也是奔着親子活動來的 不然肯定訂別的五星酒店了 而且訂房時候套餐本來就是包含了價值98的手工的 結果當天去圖書館詢問 工作人員説他們當天有拍攝團隊在 沒時間接待小朋友的做手工。。。弄的小朋友十分失望 。。。那是不是應該退掉活動費？
4,沒有宣傳裏面的樂隊演出沒有露天電影 待在酒店很枯燥。。。而且小童樂園是室外的 真的是暴熱！

前台：一丁點笑容都沒有

泳池：躺椅不夠，住客竟然還要共用一把椅子放東西，明明還有空間可放更多躺椅的。請自行看照片一，壞成這樣還不修，要等住客受傷了才處理嗎？

早餐：不好吃，一點也不用心，重點是竟然有人在那抽煙，旁邊都是小孩子，我們跟服務員反應，得到衹有一句話：他是我們老闆。我的天啊，老闆就可以為所欲為？

房間叫水一瓶要收¥5，傻眼 

唯一可稱讚的是打掃阿姨態度都良好

以後不會再來，要來的人慎重考慮，性價比太差的一間民宿，根本算不上高級酒店

msg:地理位置：距離景區入口很近，周圍城市裡的夜宵超市也距離很近。但是如果想去西柵夜店，還是要住在景區裏。景區晚上十點後停止買票，進不去了。

環境：迷你版阿麗拉。

硬件：挺新的，基本符合五星酒店的要求。大床房硬件明顯比雙床房高級。地暖，自動馬桶，雙臉盆，浴缸，陽台，這些雙床房都沒有。

服務：有待提高。餐廳食物味道一般，沒有自助早餐。房間里居然忘記提供洗澡出來放地方的毯子。電話詢問説阿姨下班了，無法提供？！

最後説一下 兩間房的歡迎水果都沒有哦 感覺晚上缺了點什麼
