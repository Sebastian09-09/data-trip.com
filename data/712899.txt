The room is large and tidy. There were not enough toothbrushes that night, and the service staff delivered them a little late. The next day, the manager came to the room to apologize and sent a fruit plate. The most impressive thing for the children was that the robot delivered the takeaway to the room. Although the hotel facilities are a bit outdated, they have everything they should have. Breakfast includes steamed buns and pancakes, Western salads, and various breads, cakes, and bagels. The restaurant is small but exquisite. The coffee is good, and I drank two cups. There is a Goubuli restaurant next to the hotel, which is worth going to when you come from other places. There is Luneng Shopping City for shopping, and you can take your children to the playground to play for a day. I will stay here again next time.

msg:The service attitude of the front desk staff at around 9:00 pm on May 10 was very unfriendly. I was already very tired after checking in at night, and I felt very uncomfortable when I encountered the poor service of the service staff (a lady). The small problem that could have been solved well was blocked by the waiter, making the guest wait at the front desk for nearly 15 minutes. The hotel facilities are old and lack detailed instructions for use. In particular, the attitude of the front desk staff on duty that night was very impatient, and the staff training management needs to be rectified and strengthened. Although most of the service staff have a good attitude, because of such an "alternative" service staff, it makes people wonder if this is just the tip of the iceberg? After consideration, I will not choose this hotel again in the near future.

The hotel swimming pool is very good, and the water temperature is suitable for children. It is just that it cooperates with the fitness center and closes at 9:30 pm. I must praise their breakfast. I have eaten breakfast in many five-star hotels, but this is the first time I have seen a whole triangular mousse cake that can be taken at will. The main thing is that it is really delicious, and the taste is definitely not inferior to the ones sold in professional cake shops for more than 30 yuan a piece. The Gaba dish is also very delicious, and you don't have to queue up in the southwest corner to eat it.

The room is big enough, but the old house has a bit of moldy smell, which is not easy to get out. The swimming pool is particularly beautiful for taking pictures. This is the baby pool. The pool next to it is divided into several lanes. Many children practice on weekends. After a stroll, I found that the hotel also gave Starbucks drinks. The breakfast has special Gaba dishes, pancakes, sweet and salty tofu brain, which are very satisfying. Especially the Gaba dishes, I feel that it is better than the roadside stalls the next day. It is not so salty and the marinade is more fragrant. In short, it is a hotel with super cost-effectiveness. It would be perfect if the room ventilation is better.

msg:In Tianjin, almost any hotel with "TEDA" in its name is not synonymous with quality, but it is basically not a pitfall. This is the case with the TEDA International Club where we stayed on our business trip. Compared with those high-end chain hotels, its decoration style has a kind of old-fashioned state-owned enterprise style, but the room area is also really state-owned enterprise style, large! 
The reception area and rest area of ​​the room are clearly distinguished by two steps and guardrails, and it still takes two steps to jog from the innermost desk to the door. We joked that this length is enough for a sprint. Two TVs are also very convenient for two people to stay in, each watching their own without affecting each other. 
The bathroom shower only has a shower head, no handheld shower, thumbs up! Those who understand will understand! 
The fifth floor of the hotel is a cooperative gym (including a swimming pool), which can be used free of charge with a room card. 
The fourth floor is the original gym and breakfast restaurant. The gym here is rare in hotels of the same level, with a large area and a rich variety of equipment, and the key is that there are few people. Of course, there are few people because everyone "likes the new and dislikes the old". Compared with the gym on the fifth floor, the equipment here is not new. Some equipment needs maintenance, such as rowing machines, but for non-fitness experts, all imported equipment is accompanied by a Chinese user guide. It is strongly required that each hotel should make rectifications according to the TEDA International Club! ! ! !
After dinner, come to the gym to sweat, then go back to the room to take a shower and sleep, it's very comfortable. If you are also a social phobia and don't want to exercise with all kinds of fitness experts, then the fitness of the hotel on the fourth floor is a good alternative.
The breakfast on the fourth floor is a combination of Chinese and Western. In Tianjin, of course, local specialties such as steamed buns and maocai are indispensable, but I personally recommend the hotel's homemade sandwiches, especially the croissant + salmon one, which is nutritious and delicious!
Finally, let's talk about the shortcomings. Compared with the controller at the head of the bed, which has a high learning cost, the high light transmittance of the balcony curtains makes me dissatisfied. I want to sleep in in the morning, but I am woken up by the outdoor sunlight, which is really unhappy!
September is coming soon, and when the new students report, Nankai University is right across the hotel. It is estimated that it will be difficult to book this hotel by then. If you want to stay there, you have to make a reservation as soon as possible.

msg:When you enter the hotel, there are service staff to guide you. We travel with a family and have a lot of stuff. When you enter the door, there is a male waiter to help carry the luggage. The girls who check in are also very enthusiastic and considerate. Seeing that there are elderly people, they change the room without a bathtub under the shower. However, they are still happy to wait for a while before the room is cleaned. Even if you don't say it when you go out for travel, you will be arranged with a closer room according to the same name of the order. The manager girl on the first floor also came to apologize for the long waiting time. As long as the questions are raised, they can be solved in time. The hotel is indeed a bit old, but it is really cost-effective for a family to stay, because the room is really big, stupid and big, but it is really old. In fact, with the changes in the tourist population, the current tourist population is no longer just business travel types in many time periods, so it is recommended that the room should be improved, such as the shower is above the bathtub, which is really inconvenient for the elderly, and you can prepare separate toiletries and slippers for children. Because I stayed for a long time, I basically met all the waiters on the first floor. They are warm and thoughtful, and it was a very happy journey.

My wife and I asked to change rooms, but in the end we only provided a room full of damp smell and a room with the sound of the compressor right next to the window.

msg:孩子3號到附近的學校報到， 2號晚就選了這家酒店入住。 酒店的設施有年代了， 房間裏的地毯也因為客人的多次入住都有了復古感， 沙發的扶手那裡都能看出明顯的多次使用或臟污或磨損的痕跡，床頭用手指摸一下薄薄的一層灰。坐便器，看到後， 我衹能自己打掃一下才敢用！ 訂購的3人的2室套間，房間裏衹備有2個拖鞋和2個漱口杯，打了電話後， 服務員會送上門， 同時還贈送了 一瓶咖啡+卡片。 印象很深刻的是， 早餐時看見餐飲服務員， 徒手整理果盤上的切片水果， 我被震驚到了， 我在想我剛剛拿的那些水果是否也經歷了同樣的被整理？如果你在攜程網上付款了房間費用，那麼到店還需要付款300元的按金， 按金會在你離店後， 服務人員檢查了你使用的房間後原路返回。前台check OUT 時， 前台贈送了禮物，非常好用也好看， 一個包裝精美的手機充電線。酒店前面有馬路作業隊， 所以我們去的時候是單向限行。房間挺大的，沒有感覺有裝修味道。床和床品， 個人感覺還蠻舒服的。

酒店最重要的一些體驗床品，洗浴，早餐沒一個好的
床品太軟，雖然床2米，很大，但是睡覺翻身都不太舒服
洗浴就別提了，超大的房價，衞生間也很大，但是淋浴間很小。浴缸看着不乾淨，也不想用。
馬桶也很小，而且在一個很小角落裡，那個憋屈
早餐屋子比較小，種類中規中矩，新鮮程度也一般。説實話，還不如桔子水晶的早餐
服務員就更別提了，一點服務意識都沒有，不問就不説，多説一句話的提示都沒有，造成很多誤解
酒店雖然有游泳池，但是外包的，可以免費游泳，但是服務呀，呵呵，比酒店的服務更差
反正這個酒店以後堅決不會再住，拜拜

美中不足之處是衞生並不到位，浴缸及其他一些地方有些臟了。因臨近主幹道，時時聞得汽笛聲，牆體幾乎沒有隔音。
