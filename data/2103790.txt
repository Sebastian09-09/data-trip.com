msg:This hotel could be a perfect getaway for couples if they were more focused on the spa part. The hot springs next to each building are really nice and hot. The lighting however could be more inviting instead of cold white. Also the wooden walkways could use a prep up.
The Spa itself looks really inviting, but during our stay, there was only one masseur available. So no partner massage possible, even though it was 2 bed massage rooms. Also the massage was quite pricey with just about 700¥ per hour.
The breakfast was OK. Nothing to really look forward to as European, but edible and coffee was available. Additionally, there is a fresh fruit plate for the room each day. The staff (not speaking any english) tried it's best.
Lastly, the hotel is quite remote. There is really nothing much to do in the near surrounding. So have a car ready or settle for a taxi ride for 30 minutes to Haikou city...

msg:I saw a blogger checking in on a small book, so I came here to experience it on the weekend. The hotel environment is indeed first-class, as if I had walked into a large Moroccan castle estate, which is very suitable for taking photos and checking in. However, according to our actual stay experience, this high-value hotel may have serious problems in terms of service and facilities due to too few guests or other reasons. One word to describe it is-desolate.
1. Serious lack of staff: We checked in at 7 pm, and there was no staff in the huge lobby, and the air conditioner was not turned on. Only the front desk contact information was left. After calling, the front desk said that they had just sent the guests away for a while and would come back (the hotel rooms are widely distributed and picked up by shuttle buses); when we checked out, we encountered the same situation again.
2. The breakfast is too simple: There are not many people in the huge restaurant on Sunday morning, and the air conditioner is not turned on. It is very hot and stuffy, and there are many ants crawling on the table; the waiter said that the buffet breakfast was cancelled and handed us a minimalist breakfast menu to check. There are no more than 8 varieties of food and beverages, and the taste is also very average.
3. Facilities are no longer what they used to be: There is a zoo on the hotel map with small animals kept in captivity; when we actually went to see it, there were only three empty fences left with no animals.

1. The location is excellent. Pick up a car from Haikou Meilan Airport and get to the hotel in 40 minutes. For dinner, go to Chengmai Old Town to taste local local dishes and drive there in 15 minutes.
2. The design of the hotel villas is novel, the lobby area of ​​each villa is very large, and the appearance of the villa is beautiful, making you feel like you are in Monaco. The hotel has a large land area and beautiful landscape design.
If I have a chance to come back next time, I will stay at least two nights.

It should be very good if you bring your children here, because there is a trampoline park, which will definitely be fun.
Next time I have the opportunity to bring my family here, I want to stay a few more nights, soak in the selenium-rich hot springs they mentioned, and then walk around the surroundings. It is said that there are many parent-child health activities on weekends occasionally, which is very rich.

Most of the hotels are small villas. The orange-red exterior looks very special and looks good for taking pictures. It is well-gold and jade-like. As for the facilities in the room, I don’t have to talk about the pictures. The standard of the farmhouse, the toilet🚽 This is how it looked after I wiped it twice with rubbing alcohol. The baby lay on the bed and said that it would be better to live at home, which made me feel like I was being stupid for spending the money. The breakfast is even more amazing. There is almost nothing left for breakfast after 9 o'clock, and the key point is that they don't provide supplements. I want to get the leftover bread 🍞, but I just got close to it and the little bugs flew away... I don't want to try all kinds of hot springs that scare me. In short, who will know.

msg:Search for hotels in Haikou with children on Ctrip and find the recommended Xikang Yunshe Resort Hotel. The hotels are all villas, and the style of the villas is very exotic. The castle villa we stayed in has a retro-style guest room. You can also enjoy a selenium-rich hot spring, an indoor trampoline park similar to a naughty castle, and a series of parent-child health activities with rich content. We just went on a water bike and participated in a yoga class. There was also a cookie-making activity for children at Chris**as, but we didn’t make it. Due to travel reasons, I was not able to experience them all, which is a pity. I recommend staying a few more days. After checking in, the children came over to play on the trampoline and had a great time. The hotel is very suitable for family outings. The hotel's red house villa is especially suitable for taking photos and is very photogenic.

There is an ecological lake in the park, and there are castles and detached villas on both sides of the lake. On the first day of check-in, I unconsciously wanted to take a walk in the park. Walking to the area of the orange-red villa. It feels a bit like the house in the "confession town" in Mexico that I once traveled, short but warm.

Second, I admit that I spent 737 yuan to open the hotel. I booked a room, and this 'hotel' did give me a room (refer to the picture), and finally I have to admit that there is really a bed in this room. If you book a double standard, it will still be two open. Therefore, if there are hotels in this price range in Hainan Island, I suggest that you think twice before staying. PS: I gave a negative review of one star, because there is no negative number to comment on.

服務員充滿熱情，讓人感到海南的熱帶風情
紅房子別墅是摩洛哥風格，適合拍照
温泉非常棒，泡完很深舒暢。各種健康課程，抽時間簡單體驗了一下，很新奇，感受確實好。還有一個超大的蹦床公園。
下次要帶家人來多住幾天

酒店建築羣的特點，非常的出片！除了有摩洛哥風格的橙色建築羣以外，這裏還有古堡建築，妥妥拍出歐洲古堡的感覺！除了拍照這裏還有很多好玩的呢！可以蹦床，可以划船，還能騎車！
