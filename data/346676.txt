The location was perfect for traveling and staying close to the airport and beach. Several close stores. Several amenities were closed. Only one pool was open and the only western restaurant was closed. I would consider staying again in the future if more was open.

The breakfast buffet is delicious and plentiful. Staff is helpful. Cleaning is done every day.  Unfortunately, despite hotel‚Äôs gigantic territory, only 5th part of it can be really used. Although it looks like hotel has 4 swimming pools and ponds, in reality only central one is working. Hot springs are located right next to the majority of hotel rooms, so 14:30-22:00 it‚Äôs impossible to relax in the room because big families are all enjoying hot springs, producing plenty of noise. There is no bar at the pool. No lunch and dinner buffet at the hotel. Although my stay here was okay, I‚Äôm not planning to visit this hotel again.

Super bitter and tasted like water daily, but this would be my only complaint.  Other than that, super great location, beach just across the road, many kids activities, pools, kids club, kids playground, and more! Very nice BBQ with live Philippino band singing some great Western and Chinese songs within the resort compound.  The balcony view, with the Ocean View chosen, is breathtaking.  Rooms are spacious and clean.   Highly recommended to families who want a relaxing and beautiful area to stay.

msg:Simply amazing !  I had a wonderful experience and stay. The staff is friendly and helpful.  I had the most helpful receptionist check me in Âè§Â∞èÂßêÂßêÂëÄ Miss Gu , her customer service skills are commendable.  Turn down service was done everyday and the room was clean . 
Location : This hotel is ideal for those who want to be close to the airport. The location is CONVENIENT,  I am happy I stayed there , there was basically no need to call a taxi at any point during  my five day stay.  I used the beach tunnel to catch a bus to all the places I wanted to visit . The beach is about six mins walk from the hotel . You can barely hear the planes flying over.  I am a VERY light sleeper, and after falling asleep I heard nothing and before falling asleep I barely heard the planes , the frequency of planes flying over is very low.  Bus number 8, 27, 26 and 34 can take you to many places and bus #8 goes until either 10pm or 11pm.  I went to Yalong Bay Beach , Yalong bay Park , Haitang Bay , Luhuitou Park ,  dolphin bar,  Phoenix Island whilst staying at the same place . 
Room : my room was clean and they cleaned it everyday and replenish the toiletries and towels.  I stayed in room 0608 with a view of the garden and sea.  The aunt who cleaned my room also folded my clothes , that was very nice of her . She was very detailed in the cleaning. 
Service : the staff is friendly and helpful. 
Breakfast : the breakfast wasn't very western but there was something there to cater to everyone's dietary needs.  Everything was also there in abundance . I enjoyed breakfast every morning .  If you're worried about crowds while dining , there is a notice that tells the quiet time to dine .
Pools: there are many pools but only one opened . Who wants a pool when there is a beach outside haha or while being on an island.  I'm an islander , I don't fancy pools,  so I didn't even swim in the pool . P.s there is a fish foot therapy pool but it must be paid for . 
Beach : sanya bay is okay to swim but I went to yalong bay Beach for a swim instead the water there is clearer.  
Finally , I am happy I chose this property,  after seeing the bad reviews it took me two weeks to decide to stay here but I had no problems there , no mosquitoes etc ,maybe it isn't the season for the bugs etc BUT there is a notice to keep the sliding  door closed if you'll be out for a while and they do  have a mosquitoe plug in repellant in the room . The property is big , as resorts ought to be , be prepared for a little walk .
I'll definitely stay here again.

I think the sad thing is that not all of the pools are open which gives the area an overall feeling of being run down.
Breakfast was good with enough options for all.
Finally, the staff overall are very helpful. They originally gave us a room that had a building site near it. When we asked for a different room they moved us without argument.
Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel, and will return.

1. Firstly the breakfast was so overcrowded with people- there were no clean tables or any tables available for that matter. The breakfast buffet was not being refilled so there was hardly anything to eat still within the breakfast time.
2. The Swimming pools are closed with no water- only 1 was open and ofcourse full of people. You would expect the hotel to have everything organised and running over Golden week when they know they will be busy. 
3. The room was satisfactory, bed is nice but balcony has no view. I expected a much higher standard from a 5 star hotel and for over 700RMB per night I could have gotten a much better experience elsewhere. The hotel did allow me to cancel my other 2 nights as I was completely dissatisfied with what they had to offer which I do appreciate. This hotels offerings are dismal to say the least. Even the shower gel/shampoo in the bathroom was budget. Really need to up their game.

msg:A sad shadow of its former glory. The problems started upon arrival when they couldn't figure out how to take a foreign credit card for the deposit. The rooms are fine and clean, but the view is marred by empty pools below the west wing. The pools on the east side are full, but the west wing suffers from drained pools, shut off lights, and a lack of soul. Breakfast trays lie empty a full half hour before breakfast ends. And when asked if something will be replenished, I am told that they will go ask only to never have the person return with an answer. The orange juice had to be refilled twice upon request. Out of the outdoor pools, only half of them are filled (on the east side), while the west side pools (the bigger more beautiful ones) lie empty. Its a sad condition to see, especially as the staff was so kind, but the hotel's cost saving conditions has just made it so that more people have my experience and are less likely to return. You can find a place just down the street for a similar price, and with more life. In its current condition, it just feels past its prime, and the vultures are circling.

msg:After a big disappointment at Ocean scenic, we came to Howard J. HJ looks like a big hotel with quite nothing in so let me start with the hotel itself. It looks rather not well maintained! Rooms are rather ok! Breakfast too Chinese but our kids get use to. The fitness club is really really old! I didn‚Äôt know such machine and weight still exist! Also the working time of the fitness center is not convenient! 
Internal swimming pool looks like geek time !
I really suggest ctrip does a monthly Audit to their hotel and start with the well-known ones, try categorize and organize as I have the feeling that most of pictures are old and comments rather fake ...

msg:Located near the airport, so you occasionally hear planes taking off. Easy access to the beach (nice sand, beautiful view) through a tunnel under the street. The breakfast is very good, but crowded at peak time which is to be expected as it is a very large hotel. The Korean restaurant is authentic and reasonably priced, but the Chinese restaurant has limited options for dinner. Luckily you can easily have food delivered to the hotel or venture just outside for local flavor. You could also order a taxi and drive 15-30 minutes away for some delicious Italian at Casa Mia or Cucina or grab some pub grub and drinks at Dolphin Bar. Two of the three outdoor swimming pools were closed and the indoor hot springs pool was not open. The children's outdoor playground is in need of a facelift. The service at the hotel bar is disappointing unless you only want a beer as the workers don't know how to make any of the cocktails without looking at a guide and even then they take over ten minutes to concoct one drink which probably still isn't made correctly and they are not consistent from day to day. Overall a good stay for the money, but certainly needs to be renovated to match the pictures and descriptions.

msg:My family and I stayed in a 2-bedroom suite which was very spacious and clean. It was a little annoying that the room had steps outside the room door, which made things a little difficult for our toddler and the pushchair. Apart from this minor inconvenience the room was fine and was a pleasant place to relax with the family in the evenings. It would be better if there were a corkscrew and bottle opener in the room though. The hotel itself is not geared up towards non-Chinese guests. Most of the check-in staff could not speak or understand basic English and we relied on translation apps to check-in and ask for a late checkout. Some of the staff seemed slightly flustered or worried to deal with a foreigner and passed us on to a member of staff with a slightly better grasp of English.

Breakfast was 6:30 to 10:30 and was fine although it was rather strange that at about 9 O'Clock they remove the food from one side of the dining hall and start cleaning when guests are still eating so the other side of the room gets busier as everyone has to go to that part to get their food even if they are still seated in the half of the room where the food has been suddenly removed.

The pools were nice but large parts of the outdoor pool were closed and there were no shallow areas for younger children to play in. The walkway to the beach was pleasant and the children enjoyed looking at the fish and geese.

Unlike other resorts like the Sheraton, there did not seem to be any planned events for families or children to take part in. If there were, they were not advertised in English.  

Overall we were happy with our stay because of the spacious room at a good price, but next time we visit Sanya we will probably stay somewhere that is more able to cater to international visitors.

msg:The hotel is located very close to coconut dream corridor. Sanya bay is cool but I prefer yalong bay as it‚Äôs more tropical and the hotels located in yalong bay are literally on the beach whereas the hotels in Sanya bay are not on the beach. To get to the the beach you have to cross a main road which is pretty busy. If you are looking to stay at a place with a private beach then go to yalong bay. We stayed in Sanya bay our last night as the hotel is 15 min from the airport and we had an early flight. The hotel is beautiful and they do have lovely gardens and pools but if you are wanting that tropical vibe then yalong Bay Area is perfect.

msg:We booked four nights, and had a pretty great experience. Staff was very accommodating and friendly, and the seaview was exactly what we were looking for. The grounds were beautiful, but it wasn't their high season, so it wasn't quite as well kept as it would typically be, and the best pool wasn't open. A few of the facilities were the same, as again, we didn't stay during their high season. The beach area is beautiful, but the sand flies made us think twice about going a second time. Yalong Bay has the slightly better beach area if you go to a resort, but Sanya Bay has the perk of being a little more centrally located and near better food options.

msg:Great hotel with good rich breakfast, Chinese and Western cuisine alike. Lack of a Western style buffet or BBQ dinner was a big let down. The hotel also needs to invest in English speaking staff now that they have a number of international guests. We struggled to communicate with the reception,restaurant and room service staff! The swimming pool is expansive and clean - but they need to have clear and safety signs to avoid accidents. I hurt my leg while entering the pool due to lack of warning signs to indicate a deep step. I informed the hotel staff - one of the life savers- but this was ignored. I could not walk properly for four days. The lawn is green and beautiful-a great ground for an evening walk and rest! The underground tunnel to the beach is a great addition. The beach is very close, safe and clean!

The front view of the sea was very nice; the breakfast was quite rich, and the main meal was indeed a little expensive, but it was like that in tourist cities, but you could order takeout (not cheap either); the activities of Octopus Tribe were very good, and I asked the housekeeper for WeChat QR code to scan and make an appoin**ent in advance, and basically I could make an appoin**ent. The teachers of various activities were very serious, and they took beautiful photos for us to send to the group. It felt more formal than Tianyu, which felt free-range and messy, but Our baby is a little over three years old and hasn't started kindergarten yet. He doesn't know what to play with. It feels more suitable for children aged four, five or six. The children had a lot of fun in the children's water park and swimming pool. The underground passage leads directly to the beach. There are water pipes for foot washing at the entrances on both sides, which is very considerate. In addition, you can't see the sunset at the Coconut Dream Corridor in this season. The sunset in the summer in the northern hemisphere is blocked by buildings. The room facilities don't feel very old, it's okay, quite warm, and the walls are very soundproof. Our room is in the north row on the front. Because it is close to the airport, the sound of the plane taking off is still very loud from the door...

The only thing that needs to be improved is the hotel's self-service seafood barbecue dinner, which is 198 yuan per person. The environment is not bad, but the taste is really not good. It would be better if it could be improved.

msg:The trip was very short, but overall it was pretty good. Because of the flight problem, we chose a hotel close to the airport, but this hotel is pretty good overall. During the stay, the beautiful Miss Du Juan also helped to upgrade the sea view room for free. You can see the seaside from the room. She also gave us a fruit plate and welcome gift for free. Because it was our wedding anniversary, she also gave us a small surprise, which was very thoughtful. The lady was also very enthusiastic to help solve many problems. I give her a thumbs up. The hotel environment is also good. There is a swimming pool and many children's entertainment projects downstairs. It is very suitable for parents with children. The scenery is also good. The hotel also has an underground passage leading directly to the beach. It's a pity that this trip will end due to work reasons, but overall we are both very satisfied and look forward to staying next timeüòä

There are many reviews online, and I checked in with a nervous mood.
Joanna Dujuan at the front desk handled the communication politely and promptly, and I felt at home. The check-in reception and the final check-out were all very comfortable. I think choosing Guoguang Howard Johnson is a very good choice.
They also gave me toys for my children and upgraded me to a sea view room on the 13th floor for free, where I can see the sea view and sunset. The children are very happy.
The hotel facilities are very complete and the hygiene is OK. The scenery is unbeatable. The Coconut Dream Corridor is just outside the hotel, and it is very convenient to go to the sea and play in the sand.
I especially want to praise the hotel's octopus tribe activities. The activities are rich and the children have a lot of fun. Thank you Teacher Xinxin, Teacher Lemon, and Teacher Lightning.

Mr. Hong, who had not checked into the existing hotel, contacted me in advance and helped us upgrade the room according to the actual situation. Thank you very much. Later, he also helped to delay the check-out, although it was not used, which shows that it is worthy of being a five-star hotel with a one-step service. Besides, the hotel gave away five free electronic photos. This activity is very good. It is suitable for all ages and leaves beautiful memories of all ages. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Guoguang Howard Johnson Resort Hotel.

The most worth mentioning is that my hotel housekeeper Guo Qiujiao is really attentive and provides excellent service. She upgraded me to a deluxe sea view room for free, so that I can see the sea even when I lie on the bed. She also helped me apply for a variety of welcome fruits. She always cares about whether I have enough mineral water to drink and whether I need help. She is really attentive!

What we need to complain about is that the receptionist had a stiff face, and the tickets were not mentioned actively, and there was basically no other service. The room we stayed in said it had a sea view, but it was a corner, and we couldn't see the sea unless we looked out. We only participated in one activity, which was useless. But the swimming pool was enough for a day, and the underground passage to the beach was convenient. The price-performance ratio was OK, don't force too much.

There are children's playgrounds both indoors and outdoors, which the children also like. During the stay, we did not go to the outside attractions and spent all the time in the hotel. It is also convenient to eat, and the hotel restaurant tastes good. The housekeeper Guo Qiujiao has a good service and answers all questions. The room type was upgraded and a super large fruit plate was given as a gift. They also took the initiative to make beds for us and installed bed guards. It was so considerate.

Before checking in, the housekeeper Chen Hualing answered many questions very considerately, haha ‚Äã‚Äã(I have a lot of questions, such as how big the room is, which floor height, etc.), and the housekeeper Chen Hualing has been very enthusiastic to help answer questions. On the day of joining the company, the housekeeper Chen Hualing was always concerned about when we would arrive at the hotel. The service was very good and warm, and gave us a lot of advice and help:), especially good! During the stay, it was also very warm to send us fruits and water (because the baby needs to drink milk, it is especially warm), and every question was answered. The service of this hotel is indeed full marks! Special thanks to the housekeeper Chen Hualing for his considerate and warm service! 
In addition, the environment of this hotel is actually quite good, with a large coconut forest, which is very suitable for parents and children to take care of their children. It is a must-have hotel for parents and children to take care of their children! There are also many activities! The beach is outside the hotel. The most beautiful beach! Recommended to everyone! It is a real review and will be recommended to relatives and friends

The West Island is just opposite, which is very convenient. The housekeeper Du Juan contacted in advance and asked for details. Knowing that I was with a child, she took the initiative to help prepare the child's supplies, bed guards, etc., which was really considerate. Because the train arrived in Sanya at more than 11 o'clock, considering that the child was very tired, the housekeeper Du Juan helped coordinate to prepare the room in advance, and we could check in as soon as we arrived at the hotel, which was great. The arranged room was clean and hygienic, and the balcony could see the seaside, which was very good. The hotel has good service and location. It is right in Sanya Bay and has its own passage to Sanya Bay Beach, which is super good. Children's swimming pool, lawn, amusement park, beach, basically you can stay at home in the hotel, and continue to live here when you come to Sanya in the future.

If you want to eat, the original restaurant of the hotel is also good. Various seafood fast food, dregs, vinegar and coconut chicken are not far away.
A half-hour fish therapy for two and tickets to the Hainan Binlang Valley 5A scenic spot were given as a gift. But I didn't go to experience them.
The Qingbuliang in the lobby bar is delicious. Fresh fruit and different types of ice cream are available.

The room is also small, it can't be considered a five-star hotel, maybe there are too many people staying, the breakfast is also average, only one swimming pool is open, and the other one is closed because there are too many people. The advantage is that the swimming ring and sand dredging tools can be used for free, and the underground passage can lead directly to the beach

The courtyard composed of beautiful grassland and beautiful swimming pool is set off by coconut trees and colorful flowers and plants, which keeps guests coming back for more. It is definitely a place to take beautiful photos! I booked a room before checking in this time. Ding Ling at the front desk was very warm and thoughtful. She helped me choose the room I wanted. When I went to the Chinese restaurant to eat, the cashier Weng Dunman patiently helped me pay with coupons. The old man‚Äôs crutches were broken. The concierge Bu Fu Honghai worked hard to help with the repairs and worked tirelessly. Every little bit of help made us feel warm. During the Spring Festival, a new shopping and dining plaza called Eye of the Sea opened near Howard Johnson. It has everything you want and is very convenient! We will come to Guoguang Haosheng again for vacation in the future!

On the first night of my stay, I received a call from the housekeeper Ms. Du Juan, asking me if I had brought my baby. When she knew that I had brought two babies, she helped me give it to me. They prepared small gifts for the baby, upgraded the room type, prepared children's bathrobes, dental kits, slippers and a small toilet. They were really very attentive. After arriving at the hotel, they personally delivered fruits and refreshments, which moved us very much.
Hygiene: I read reviews online and all said the facilities are old, but I really think they are okay, and they are very, very clean and cleaned in a timely manner.
Environment: Large lawn, large swimming pool, children's heated swimming pool, naughty castle, and they are all clean. Swimming rings and sand digging tools can also be used for free. Just remember to return them after use.
Service: Every service staff will greet you warmly, ask questions without hesitation, and answer them patiently.
The hotel's parent-child activities, Octopus Tribe are great. They arrange activities from morning to night, and every activity is not messy. They take the children to play very seriously. Coach Beta, Coach SpongeBob, and Teacher Xinxin, they are all great.
Thanks again to Dujuan Butler for taking care of me. Because the itinerary has been arranged in advance and cannot be changed, I feel that the stay this time is too short. I will stay at Howard Johnson Guoguang next time.

msg:I can only give a bad review. The service is too bad, the environment is too bad, and the hygiene is not good. The room is not ventilated and very small. I feel like I am suffocating when sleeping. I can't breathe well. I can't see the sea at all in the sea view room I booked. I don't know if there is a construction site outside or something. The rumbling machine feels like I am on a construction site. I live on the 13th floor. The traffic downstairs is so noisy. There are also many cars in the middle of the night. There are always loud noises when I take a shower and flush the toilet upstairs in the middle of the night. I slept for two days and there was always a knock on the door in the middle of the night. There was also a beeping sound from someone swiping a card to enter the room. I did it many times. I don't know if I went to the wrong place. It must be scary if you live alone. The hygiene is very poor. There is a puddle of water on the ground when you come in, and it is dirty water.
What made me the most angry was that I clearly hung a "Do Not Disturb" sign at the door, but I was in a hurry to go out so I didn't pack my luggage and opened both suitcases. When I came back, I saw someone had cleaned the inside. I didn't put on a garbage bag when I checked in, but I found a garbage bag when I came back. My suitcase was next to the trash can, and I had to step over my suitcase to get to the trash can. And I had to pass my suitcase to get to the two trash cans. My suitcase was full of clothes. I really didn't know how to thank you. Didn't you see the "Do Not Disturb" sign? I didn't put away my things. I'm a bit of a germaphobe. I don't want anyone to touch or move my things. Why is it like this? Come in without permission. Most of the breakfast is bread and nothing to eat.

I saw a lot of reviews before that many people got the opportunity to upgrade their room type for free. I asked the front desk with a try mentality, but was rejected... I called again to ask if I could get a higher floor. My child has sensitive skin and is afraid of mosquitoes. I was rejected because the garden bed room I booked is on the 1st or 2nd floor. I failed to change to a higher floor. They also reserved a room with a balcony looking out to the sunshade, so the balcony means nothing can be seen. I was speechless...

It is said that March is the off-season, which is strange. I wanted to check in early to let my child take a nap, but was also rejected... I had to call twice to delay check-out until 1:30, saying that the guests behind were waiting...

The cleaning service is great, the elder sister is very friendly and diligent, and the cleaning is very clean

Service - it is indeed a legendary hotel, the service is very good! I commend the üíïWu Lipingüíïkidsüëç at the front desk for being very patient when checking in. She took the initiative to add WeChat and paid attention to the check-in experience every day. She also helped me solve the problem of my child's wheelchair application form. It‚Äôs really very considerate! I stayed at the St. Regis Yalong Bay in February, and none of the housekeepers there üíïWu Lipingüíïthe children were so considerate‚ò∫Ô∏è
Play - There are many parent-child activities in the hotel. The front desk will inform guests thoughtfully about the activities, because the children they bring are older and they mainly enjoy the beautiful scenery of the hotel. The large lawn of the hotel is really the favorite of children. The water lilies are so beautiful and the tadpoles and frogs in the pond are so cute. The children loved feeding the fat koi fish on the bridge.
Stay - I booked a family suite this time. You can directly enjoy the sea view from the balcony. The room facilities are neat and clean, and the cleaning girl's service is also very good.
Eat - the breakfast is rich in variety, and there are many hard dishes (hot bone tea and beef brisket stewed with radish are more delicious), which the children like to eat very much.
‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîA little suggestion, there should be a desk lamp in the room so that the older children can do their homework at nightüòÑ

I asked if I need a late check-out in the morning when I planned to leave. This is the first time I have encountered such proactive inquiry service in so many years of traveling and staying in a hotel. Thank you! ! I was also very impressed by the service provided by the hotel waiters. When I first arrived at the hotel, I helped carry my luggage to the front desk. When I left the hotel, I took a taxi and helped put the suitcases in the car. This service was really above and beyond. So many big brand hotels! !

There are parent-child activities: children's crafts or outdoor games.
There is a small outdoor water park, swings, hot springs, a large swimming pool, a lawn (very impressive), and the beach is right outside the door. There are also a small KTV, SPA, and two or three restaurants. There is also a large naughty castle, where you can play for hours without getting out. It is the largest hotel I have ever seen. After staying for three days, the kids went crazy. Especially suitable for family vacation.
Another very important point is that the service is really considerate:
Fruit was given and everyone at the front desk was very nice. Very enthusiastic and quick to help solve problems. Wang Yinnan received the reception and was very impressed. When she made a request and could not be satisfied, she would not say "no", she would say: Do you think this is okay? This is the best hotel in my heart since I have been in Hainan for three months. Mainly a service-oriented business, everything is for customer satisfaction. Compared with some hotels I have stayed in before, this one is not good and that one is not. Or "nothing". The contrast is stark. So friendly...

At six o'clock in the afternoon the day before, I received a call from "Ding Ling" and inquired about our check-in in advance.
The little girl has a very good attitude and is very patient. Everything from check-in matters, parking, services provided by the hotel, etc. will be answered. I was also lucky enough to participate in a festival event and upgrade my room type. The room is located in the East District, very good! üòÅ

Overall, the location is second to none. The point is that the hotel is very, very big! Overlooking the hotel's 50-meter standard swimming lane, acres of coconut trees, and huge lawns, it's really enjoyable.
The Hainanese restaurant on the G floor of the hotel is also very affordable and has a great view. The only drawback is that the dining table may need to be tidied up more. The Ye Yutang fruit and coconut milk on the first floor of the lobby is refreshing and cooling, which is my favorite. Although, the price of Qingbu Liang may be much more expensive than outside.
The hotel security guards are serious and responsible in guiding parking, which is also good.
By the way, maybe because I came here for the second time, I didn‚Äôt feel so deeply about the lobby. If you come here for the first time, the lobby is really very grandüòÅ

I was a little worried after reading the online reviews before booking. I was very satisfied after moving in and renewed my reservation until I left.
The hotel is very close to the Coconut Dream Corridor. There is an underground passage leading directly to the Coconut Dream Corridor. The beach outside the hotel is very thin and very comfortable to walk on. Our children put on their slippers as soon as they walked to the beachüòÅThe night breeze is also very comfortable and gentle. Soft.
We stayed in the ocean-view twin room, and the view was superb. As soon as we arrived at Hainan Hotel, Joanna, the housekeeper, joined us and helped us choose rooms. At first we wanted to have three rooms together, but then Joanna told us about a higher floor. We decisively gave up staying together for a better sea view. I have to say , the sea view is really good, I could lie in the room, basking in the sun, and looking at the sea view for a month. On New Year's Eve, you can even see the fireworks on the beach from your room, which is super cool.
The indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds are also great. Miss Joanna gave us three tickets to the indoor playground. This indoor playground is quite large and we can play for a long time if we have time. Unfortunately, we have a travel schedule and we went back to the hotel to sleep again. It was done two or three times.
We also saw the dragon dance on the first day of the new year. It was the first time for our children to see it. It was a great surpriseüòÅ

Kindergarten or primary school students can participate in more activities, and it is very interesting to see climbing coconut trees.

msg:It is a large hotel with a very good location. It is right next to the Coconut Dream Corridor and is very convenient to go anywhere. The facilities are relatively complete and the breakfast is rich. I mainly talk about the shortcomings:
1. The service is really bad! Not long after we made the reservation, the hotel took the initiative to contact me to inquire about our check-in situation and confirmed that they could arrange a check-in (parent-child suite) for us after noon. Because there were elderly people and children, we called the hotel on the way out that day to reconfirm that it would be okay to check in after one o'clock. Then when I arrived at the hotel to check in a little later, I was clearly told that the room would not be cleaned until around 3:30. During this period, we communicated for at least 20 minutes before magically arranging a room for us. When will our relationship be moved in? It all depends on your mood, right? ? ! !
2. A huge hotel occupies an entire block, but I found the hotel entrance after walking around the entire block. Baidu map navigation is wrong. This is really unbelievable. I suggest the hotel should correct it as soon as possible.
3. Whether it is decoration or greening, the hotel is large but not refined, and it definitely does not exceed 4-star standards. The depth of the main swimming pool is only 1.1-1.4 meters, which is really inappropriate!

He said that he could contact me if he had something to do, but it turned out to be useless and could not solve any problems. The evaluation of hotel facilities is too general, at least divided into rooms and others. The room is large and stylish, but the things are old! For example, when flushing the toilet, it is specifically stated that you have to press it for a long time. The experience takes about 10 seconds. The experience is not good. It is recommended to replace it as soon as possible. The scale was broken at the beginning. Fortunately, the service was very prompt and replaced it. The waiters are nice! The breakfast buffet is okay, but the hotel is twice as big as an ordinary hotel. The buffet restaurant is 60 meters long. Eating is like going to the market. The place is too big. Chopsticks, spoons, and paper towels are all placed in separate baskets. It doesn't feel like a star-rated hotel. ! The hotel has a first-class garden environment and is very close to the seaside. This is its biggest advantage. Even though the fitness equipment is old, it can still be used. Overall it's okay, there are a lot of problems, I'm too lazy to write more, picture above

Although it is an old five-star hotel in Sanya Bay, the hotel furniture and facilities are not that new, but the rooms and bathrooms are large, with independent balconies and small tables and chairs. When I return to the hotel every day, I can enjoy the sea breeze on the balcony. , look at the night view, it is very pleasant! The hotel garden has a large lawn, which is very large and beautiful. There is an independent underground passage leading to the seaside. The swimming pool is also very large. The children's water play area is separate from the adults. There is a Coconut Hall in the lobby on the first floor, which is refreshing and delicious. There are also resident singers. It is very cheap for hotel guests. The service attitude of the hotel staff is very warm. Basically every time I go downstairs, no matter where I meet any staff member, I will take the initiative to say hello. The housekeeper Guo Hengying was the most attentive. He contacted me one day in advance to ask if I had any special requests. He also upgraded me to a 90-degree ocean view room for free in advance. Hearing that I was bringing an elderly person, he specially gave me a buckwheat pillow. He always answered all my questions. We responded when I needed it. Before I left, because it was an evening flight, the housekeeper specially delayed my check-out until 15:00. In short, Guoguang did not disappoint me and was the most satisfying part of my 5-day trip.

In fact, Sanya Bay is more suitable for children than Yalong Bay. The beach in Sanya Bay is very gentle and you can pick up a lot of small shells. The waves in Yalong Bay are big and the beach is too steep. Children dare not go into the water at all. Next time I come to Sanya, I will play in Sanya Bay and I will choose it again.

The hotel is indeed old, so the room has a strong "old wood smell", and the toiletries are also very average.

However, after all, it was developed relatively early, the location is very good, the greening of the hotel is particularly good, and the large lawn is lined with green trees. Then there is a special underground passage directly to the beach, and I think the location in front of the hotel is the best place to watch the sunset in Sanya Bay.

Ordered in-room dining twice and it exceeded expectations. The braised pork rice and seafood platter are very cost-effective and taste very good. I solved the problem of eating without leaving the hotel.

Two adjacent rooms were arranged for us to upgrade in advance, which was very convenient; the hotel's service was also good, with welcome snacks on the first day and a daily complimentary summer ice-cold drink.

Seeing that we boiled a lot of water, he took the initiative to put in a few more bottles of water for us. The service was very attentive. The hotel lobby is semi-open, with a large swimming pool in a tropical Malay style. It only takes a few minutes from the hotel to go directly to the beach. It is very convenient through the underground passage full of bougainvillea. It opens at 8:00 in the morning. The hotel has a rich breakfast. A combination of Chinese and Western, it would be perfect if there were more daily changes. Sitting on the balcony, you can enjoy the sunrise and sunset by the sea and the scenery of coconut trees. The blue swimming pool is surrounded by green trees, and it is also very suitable for parent-child activities. My three days at the hotel were very comfortable and comfortable.

Special thanks to the housekeeper Tang Huimin, who tried his best to meet our requirements; the teachers in Octopus Tribe are very cute, and the baby is very happy to make coffee~; although the room is old but tidy, it would be better if there was a partition instead of a curtain between the toilet and the room (if you don‚Äôt wash it off in time, the room will smell like the person who made the stinker); the breakfast is average and you can eat it; you can go to the beach directly through the lawn and walk down the passage (there are a lot of mosquitoes in the passage, so you need to pass quickly~ ~); If you don‚Äôt want to rent a car when visiting scenic spots such as Nanshan, West Island Pier, Tianya Haijiao, etc., it is very convenient to take a taxi (recommend ************, more honest~) or online car-hailing; recommended for taking photos on the beach* ************ (inexpensive), good photography skills.
Here is a special mention of the Korean food in Howard Johnson. The waiter will not tell you if you have ordered too much, you can order less. If you don‚Äôt have enough, please don‚Äôt order more.

I booked Howard Johnson, the best-selling hotel in Sanya Bay. The hotel is very close to the Coconut Dream Corridor, and I can take pictures of the beautiful sunset. I was also surprised to find that Sanya Bay can catch the sea, and the sand is also good. In comparison, the sand in Yalong Bay is garbage. . Guoguang Howard Johnson's butler Cheng Faxun provides very good service. He contacted her 2 days before the reservation and upgraded to a full sea view room. The view is amazing. The scenery of the Yalong Bay Marriott where I stayed at three times the price is far inferior to that of Guoguang Howard Johnson. Next time I come to Sanya Bay, I will stay at Howard Johnson Guoguang. I will also contact the housekeeper Cheng Faxun. A reservation that exceeded expectations.

msg:I read a lot of reviews before. I chose between Haiyun and Guoguang. I chose Guoguang. It was much better than expected. The facilities were okay, not as old as I imagined, and it exceeded expectations. I thought it was very good. My son was very satisfied. We went At that time, only the largest swimming pool in the middle of the hotel was open. The other swimming pools were not open due to maintenance, which may be due to the lack of people. There were too many people in the swimming pool during the day and night. The swimming pool was very large, and there were many lifeguards. They were very responsible. Well, the beach is better than Long Bay, and there are more people selling Sanya Bay than Long Bay, especially along the coastline of motorboats. It is very dangerous when people are in the sea and they drive nearby. It is very irregular, and people and motorboats are not separated. , I feel that the management of Sanya Beach is really bad, selling things all over the beach, it feels too bad

msg:The two children went on a summer vacation. We booked a family room with a king-size bed. The butler upgraded it to a higher floor with a Southeast Asian style. We stayed for 5 nights. The scenery is beautiful and the sea is very convenient. The parking is very convenient. This is the first time we live in Sanya Bay. Compared with Bialong Bay and Wanning Hotel The five-star fee is very cost-effective, but the facilities are a bit old, but the hotel is very large and complete. The hotel breakfast, evening barbecue buffet, Korean food, refreshment, etc. are not bad. Children prefer children's pools. It is very convenient to go to the beach in Sanya Bay .

The lawn is big, and it's close to the beach~ It's only when you enter that you realize how big it is inside hahaha~ The breakfast place is super big, and the content is also very rich! I ate Hainan noodles for two days in a row, it was delicious!

Facilities: Although the room facilities are a little bit outdated, it does not affect the use at all, and it is very clean and hygienic! Needless to say, the swimming pool is a large swimming pool facing the beach, and the children's water park is also very fun, and the baby likes it very much~ In addition, there is a walking path directly leading to the beach next to the swimming pool, which is very convenient, the beach is also very clean, and the sea water is also clear ~

Hygiene: Everything is very clean, and the aunt will clean it in time~

Service: Before departure, the butler Zhang Shengwen contacted me in time. After confirming the order, he also introduced to me the hotel's related activities, special services and precautions~ everything is responsive, very considerate! Give a big thumbs up!

‚≠êÔ∏èThe overall stay experience is great! ! ! ! ! Five-star praise! ! ! ! !

There are three swimming pools and a water park. The children had a great time. I would like to thank the customer service manager at the front desk. Beauty Dujuan, upgraded me to a sea-view room for free. I don‚Äôt need to go back and forth, and there is also a drop-off. I will check with the guests repeatedly. It is really caring and responsive.

msg:I just love this hotel so much! There are several swimming pools, all of which are very large. There is a 50cm pool suitable for children, and it is very warm, with hot water coming out all the time. During the two days of staying, the water in each swimming pool will be changed again, and the next day it will be replaced with a new one. This is really great! There are plumeria flowers that are suitable for swimming pools. There is a huge lawn in the middle of the hotel, and there is shade in the morning, children especially like it. At the end of the lawn, there is an underground passage across the road, which can directly lead to the Coconut Dream Corridor, which is very convenient. Go to the Coconut Dream Corridor to watch the sunset at night, it is so beautiful! Moreover, the beach sand of Coconut Dream Promenade is fine and gentle, which is super suitable for babies. Today I moved to Yalong Bay, the beach is too bad, very rough, there is a steep slope on the beach, and the waves are very big. It's not as good as Sanya Bay~ You should stay for a few more days!

The housekeeper Zhang Shengwen contacted in advance and learned that it was the honeymoon trip who took the initiative to help upgrade the room. I originally planned to spend a night, but unexpectedly I got a lot of surprises. As an old star hotel in Sanya, Guoguang Howard Johnson has a long history, and the facilities may be a little old, but its scenery is really very good, the green coverage rate is definitely ranked first among all hotels in Sanya, and the lawn maintenance is also great! The Qingbuliang of Yeyutang on the first floor is really delicious! The coconut milk is thicker than takeaway! You can go directly to the beach through the underground passage exclusively for hotel guests! Just because of the scenery and the caring butler service, I will choose Guoguang again when I come to Sanya!

After learning that we were taking children and the elderly, he thoughtfully helped us upgrade the room type and prepared children's toiletries. It is really thoughtful~ Let's talk about the hotel again. The environment of the hotel is very good. It has its own swimming pool, which is divided into children's and adults'. The children's pool has slides and other facilities that children like. The adult pool is relatively deep, but it's okay, the water is very clean ~ the room is really invincible Yes, the balcony has a 180-degree sea view. You can see the sea from the bed. There is also a rack for drying clothes on the balcony, which is very considerate~ I have to praise the hotel's buffet breakfast. It's all suitable, but it's best to buy a set meal when booking a room, otherwise it's a bit expensive to buy alone, it's not worth it for people like us who eat a small amount~ Finally, the hotel has an underground passage leading directly to the beach, which is also very convenient~ This time The check-in experience was very good, the children had a great time ~ Thanks again to the housekeeper Du Juan for his service during the stay, looking forward to seeing you next time ~

msg:This is the first time I stayed at Howard Johnson Guoguang Hotel. I feel very good. Special thanks to Manager Du Juan for upgrading our room. I will come again next time and look for her. The heated swimming pool can also be said to be very comfortable to swim in the hot spring swimming pool. The hotel breakfast is very good, very rich and delicious. The room was large, the bed was comfortable, and the balcony had a great view. Suitable for children to play.

msg:I have a good impression of Guoguang Howard Johnson Hotel for a long time. Every time I pass by, I think I must stay here next time. This time I didn't take my children and friends on a trip, so I chose here. The manager of Dujuan warmly upgraded the room for us before we checked in. Upon entering the room, the eyes lit up and it was amazing. The hotel facilities are very good, and the room is very quiet, especially the balcony view, facing the sea, which is very good. I will choose this hotel next time.

msg:Service: Whether the front desk, catering or room staff are of good quality, they serve with a smile. When we left the store, the thin welcome guy offered to help us carry our big suitcases to the car, which made me really feel bad. I would also like to thank little sister Chen Xiaoli at the front desk. She is very enthusiastic, responsive, and proficient in business. She quickly helped us with the continuation of the stay. The next day, she asked us if there was enough drinking water. It was very heartwarming‚ù§Ô∏è
Accommodation: This room type is suitable for families traveling with older children
It is especially suitable. The independent small room and 2 bathrooms fully meet the needs of older children alone. One of the two balconies is used to dry clothes, and the other is used to view the scenery and drink tea. We live in the East District, close to a villa area under renovation and a small road. There is a little noise during the day, but it gradually becomes quiet after dark, but it is quiet during the day After going out to play at night, it will not affect the rest at all. The bedding is comfortable, the hot water is very good, the toiletries are complete, and there is even washing powder, which is so considerate üëçThe clothes hangers are enough
Catering: Breakfast is rich to meet various needs. The food in the Chinese restaurant is very suitable for my family, and I don‚Äôt have to worry about my stomach troubles affecting my travel, so several meals are settled in the hotel. I especially recommend the coconut milk sold on the first floor of the hotel to refresh the body. Although it is 38 yuan, it is a little expensive but has a lot of ingredients. It tastes good and is worth it!
Environment: The hotel is very green, with various tropical green plants and flowers, it is worth taking pictures. In particular, the flowers on both sides of the stairs leading to the underground passage to the beach are beautiful, and the photos are very impressive during the day and night!
Because I lived comfortably, I directly canceled the original hotel and continued to live in this room! In short, I like this hotel, and I will stay here again when I bring my parents!

Before we checked in, the butler Zhang Chenyang, the little fairy, started to take care of our stay this time, from children to adults. All aspects are thoughtful, the arrangement is compromised, just like a good friend is receiving us, the experience is full! It completely surpassed the seven-star hotel in Haitang Bay where we stayed a few days ago. The breakfast here is rich, the rooms are spacious, the sea view is invincible, the swimming pool is perfect, the sandy beach is fine, the beach is long and the sea is clear, and children can go far into the sea. The sea water is only on the legs. Playing surfing there with a board, we decided to come to Sanya again in the future. Guoguang is our home in Hainan and we live here all the time. It is super close to the airport, and we can rent a car to enjoy Sanya easily. Thanks to the housekeeper Zhang Chenyang, it is really you who made our trip to Sanya a perfect ending and left the best impression on the last trip!
Facilities: perfect, the swimming pool is great, and the children's area is very rich
Hygiene: Clean, refreshing, tidy and comfortable
Environment: as big and beautiful as a resort
Service: The butler Zhang Chenyang has thoughtful arrangements and a very considerate attitude

If there was no comparison, it wouldn't hurt the other hotel. I stayed in another hotel for one night and quickly checked out. Guoguang is really cost-effective. The decoration is new and the service is good. The hotel is huge both indoors and outdoors. The swimming pool is constant temperature, especially suitable for children. There are not many hotels with constant temperature swimming pools in Sanya Bay. Parents must pay attention to the breakfast venue is also very large, very clean and tidy. There are many choices of food. It is super friendly to children and the water on the children's slide is also hot. The children are not too cold and happy. The next time I bring my parents, I will choose this place. I will listen to the live piano playing on the bar chairs in the hotel lobby, blowing the sea breeze and looking at the coconut trees. This is the beginning of summer. Thank you Chen Xiaoli for your patient service and Answer great praise super satisfied üòÄ

msg:This is the first time I stayed in a hotel in Sanya Bay. During May Day, this is a very cost-effective parent-child hotel. The butler, Du Juan, is warm and thoughtful. I contact you one day in advance and add WeChat. I can patiently answer any questions. We booked a sea-view twin room. I made the bed myself and filled it with bath towels in the middle. I was afraid that the child would be caught. Unexpectedly, when the service staff cleaned the next day, they thoughtfully laid a large bed sheet, resulting in no seams in the middle. This kind of detail is really warm. Heart, the only downside is that the water pressure of the shower in the bathroom is low, and the noise in the next room is very loud when the water is boiling. The others are not bad, it is worth recommending.

What's more, the service staff are very polite, especially Zhang Chenyang, from the beginning of the journey to the end of the journey, has been with us invisible.

msg:Came here 10 years ago and it was unforgettable. After 10 years, we took our baby back to visit the old place, and we are still not disappointed. Although some small details are not so 100%, the overall score is definitely the best value for money for the price. 4 trips to Sanya Bay, 2 trips to Guoguang, and 2 trips to Pullman. I really think Guoguang's price is really right. Compared with Pullman, although some small details are different, I still think Guoguang is more suitable and more cost-effective. The check-in at the front desk was a little beauty surnamed Cai, and she was in a great mood when she saw it. The super large lobby is super comfortable and cool, and the super large swimming pool makes the children have fun. However, the private beach has been cancelled. Unlike the first time I came to the beach, there were lounge chairs and parasols that were very comfortable. Maybe the entire coastline has been cancelled. The oversized green lawn makes you feel great when you walk on it. The interior of the room is also not bad. They play outside, sleep when they come back, and clean with the children. We booked a garden room with a double bed, but when we arrived, we changed the twin beds together, so that it is very comfortable to sleep with children. The service of the hotel is also very good, the things you need are delivered quickly, and the brothers are all riding electric unicycles, very fast. Free luggage storage, free trial pool towels, children's beach toys. There are also many types of breakfast. My favorite is the middle area of the lobby facing the sea. Check-in also gave coconut milk to refresh and refresh, the ingredients are super rich, üëç! Go to Avalokitesvara in the South China Sea, Tianya Haijiao, Xidao, Xiaodongtian, and take bus 30 to the beach, which is cheap, comfortable and fast, and you don't need to take a taxi. Always overall great value for money. It‚Äôs just that the hotel is too big, and we have to walk a lot up and down every day, but it‚Äôs not boring or tiring at all, because there are all kinds of fun and scenery along the way. It would be even better if the lawn can be in more recreational areas!

msg:I have never lived in Sanya Bay before. This time, I chose Howard Johnson Sanya Bay with the mentality of giving it a try at the recommendation of a friend who was traveling with me. I didn't have much hope after reading the online reviews, but after staying for two days, I feel very satisfied overall. In particular, the service of the butler Zhang Shengwen brought me a pleasant surprise! Because my sister and I brought children to check in, the room, fence, stroller, mineral water, and afternoon tea were prepared in advance when there was an endless stream of guests in the guest room. The housekeeper tried to give it to us in a timely manner. . Special thanks here!

Facilities: An old five-star hotel. Although the hardware is not up to par, the price is still there. If you choose the price/performance ratio, it is still acceptable.
Cleanliness: The cleanliness of the guest room is average. Because of the age, various traces of use are quite obvious, especially in the bathroom. There are indeed some ants in the bathroom sink in another room. I don't know why. There are no particularly obvious flaws in the sheets and duvet covers. The floor of the room is indeed not that spotless, and it is acceptable for children to run barefoot. Just wash it off, it depends on your state of mind.
Environment: The hotel environment is still Southeast Asian style, very large. There are many swimming pools. From the current state, we can still imagine the luxury when it opened.
Service: In addition to the butler service, the room service is second. The worst is the restaurant service. Whether it is the breakfast restaurant or the barbecue buffet in the evening, the service staff are all embarrassed, and the questions are really indifferent. In this trip in Sanya It is really strange and incomprehensible for a city with the highest reception capacity in the country.
In general, it depends on what the main purpose of your stay is. If you choose parent-child accommodation, it is comfortable and economical. The children's activities and places in the hotel are quite good. Howard Johnson is a cost-effective choice. If you want more enjoyment in all aspects, then please move to a hotel with a price of 1600+.

msg:I stayed for five nights in total, and it was relatively close to the airport, so I didn't change hotels
After looking at the app for a long time and comparing many hotels, I finally chose Guoguang Howard Johnson. The hotel is very large, similar to a resort in scale. The facilities and equipment are very complete, restaurants, spas, swimming pools, outdoor playgrounds, the hotel can walk directly to the beach, and there is a big lawn, it is very nice to take photos, the welcome guy at the door is very good, he is a very old brand five-star hotel.
Although the hotel is very old, the decoration of the rooms is much better than that of the same year. Some of the door locks in the rooms are relatively new, and some are older, and the sound insulation is a little worse. This door wakes up late in the morning. The sound, children yelling, etc. can be heard clearly. There are bathtubs and showers in the room. The bed in the room is very big. It should be two beds put together. There is a small shelf for drying clothes on the balcony, and the bathroom is also very clean. The auntie who cleans every day doesn't change the sheets... If she is asked to change it, she will replace it with a new one. There is dust under the bed and under the coffee table, which may not be wiped often, or it may be that the balcony is opened for ventilation, and some corners are not hygienic. Pay too much attention, the auntie cleans very quickly, the details may not be very good.
The hotel is very big and has a lot of rooms, so the cleaning time will be late, and then there is a car to the duty-free shop, and the discount coupons don't seem to be universal, anyway, it's useless.
The bar counter in the lobby downstairs is very large. It is very comfortable to sit there and enjoy the breeze.

More than 200 dinner barbecue buffet beef and mutton slices and skewers are all synthetic meat. I was shocked when I passed by at night and saw them using the fish tank of crabs to rinse the dishes.
This is the first time I've seen wet sea sand used as soot sand...it really saves money. Look at the big earth platform under my balcony...Moldy tile floor, all kinds of broken marble...The door of the mechanical room is open. Sightseeing elevator glass full of spider webs. The old decoration and equipment, the dim lights in the corridors and the large closed places, the feeling of William Castle.
The yard is full of uncultivated plants. Half the pool was closed and not a single waiter passed by said hello. The lifeguards are as sleazy as the ********s.
Of course, there are good places to talk about, there is an underground corridor leading to the beach.
There are pet rabbits, big koi, ducks and peacocks for children to watch.
The key points are the key points. There is also a staff member who called the room to inquire about the check-in experience. After I introduced the various shortcomings to her, she sincerely apologized and sent a fruit plate. The fruit plate is worthless, but her work attitude , and sincerity, is the only thing I feel good about in this hotel. It's a pity that such a good employee is buried in this hotel.

It‚Äôs been a few years, but it looks very stylish, so it shouldn‚Äôt be cheap.‚Äù

I can be regarded as using the most cost-effective expenditure to complete the beyond-expected experience of my mother and son. Next time I come back, the first night will definitely be Howard Johnson

Every word above is the real experience after check-in, absolutely no nonsense

Highly recommended, you must try the Qingbuliang of the hotel's Yeyutang, the second * four fruit soup! Dessert osmanthus rolls are delicious, slightly sweet but not greasy with the fragrance of osmanthus and mango, it's amazing!

1. The hotel is in a good location. From the first floor of the hotel through the swimming pool and lawn, you can go straight through the underground passage to the seaside. The seaside coconut grove in this part of the hotel is beautiful and the sand is very fine. The child was not enough to play with the sand for two hours and was very happy.
2. Good service. When I checked in, the front desk staff (Chen Hualing) was patient and considerate. Knowing that I had a baby over three years old, she took the initiative to help me add a bed surround. On the morning of check-out, she also took the initiative to help me extend the time to 2 according to the room status that day. By clicking forward, your child can finish the morning Octopus Tribe player session and swim for a while without being in a hurry.
3. Although the room facilities are a bit old, they are clean, warm and feel like home. The scenery from the balcony of the room is only so beautiful, and I feel very relaxed.
4. There are many parent-child activities. Even if the weather is bad and you stay in the hotel all day, there are endless free projects and courses.
All in all, staying at Howard Johnson Guoguang Hotel was one of the wisest choices I made during my trip to Sanya. I will choose this hotel again next time I come.

The hotel pool is very good. It also has its own buffet at night. The hotel has a tunnel that can directly go to the Yemeng Promenade. Walked for 5 minutes, arrived around 11:00, and waited for about 40 minutes for cleaning. During the waiting period, Ms. Zhang Chenyang was very patient and would help us with everything we needed, because we were afraid that we would wait too long After a long time, I upgraded the room type.

The refrigerator in the room has no cooling effect, and the fan in the room has very little power. A room attendant came and said that the refrigerator is only for keeping fresh food, not for cooling. The fan inside is normal. If we think it is not big enough, we can ask the engineer to check it. It's hilarious.
Service: No service to speak of. I came here for Yemeng Corridor and found it convenient, so I switched to this one. Thinking that big hotels are always better, when I checked in, a waiter asked me to tell me on WeChat that he was the housekeeper. After reporting the matter, he didn't give me a reply until I checked out and went home. Since I don't know how to do this business, I shouldn't take it. This life is outrageous. We were resting in the room. The waiter knocked on the door and swiped the room card to open the door. He said that the room would be cleaned. We had just arrived not long ago. He also said that the system showed that we had to check out today. We were speechless.
The only thing worthy of recognition is that the concierge service at the door is very good.

Thanks to Manager Yang Lei for his careful arrangement. Because it is an evening flight, the baby will take a nap in the afternoon , thoughtfully arranged late check-out. The water in the swimming pool is very clean, and there is also a hot spring swimming pool. The children had a great time playing

When you don‚Äôt want to go out, you can sit on the balcony and watch the scenery with the breeze blowing. It‚Äôs also nice to order takeaway. When leaving the hotel, because it was the high-speed train in the afternoon, manager Yang Lei helped to delay the check-out, and the service was warm. Again, the location of the hotel is good, the transportation is convenient, the garden view is also good and the facilities are complete, the opposite is the Coconut Dream Corridor, which can be reached through the hotel's dedicated underground passage. I will stay here next time I come to Sanya.

The soft furnishings look a bit old, but it is understandable. After all, it is difficult to maintain by the sea. The main reason is that the service at the front desk is too blunt, which makes people feel uncomfortable. Now It is understandable that the staff are busy during the peak season, but it is impossible for tourists to stay in only one store when they come to Sanya. If there is a comparison, they will be unhappy. I have stayed twice a few years ago and I think it is good. I will not stay again next time. The doorman has a sense of service Pretty strong, same as before, but that's part of the job.

Except for the main pool and hot spring pool, other pools are closed, especially the children's play pool. If I explained earlier, I wouldn't have booked this hotel. The hotel does not have elevator control. The hotel has a group of owners, and some rooms have been sold. There are a lot of people at the hotel for breakfast, and no one can get a seat. It all depends on the ability to get a seat. The breakfast supply is more than sufficient, and the food is okay.

Advantages: There are mosquitoes, toilet water is provided at the front desk. Luggage is delivered to the room.

As a result, I fell down in the hotel the next day. There was a gap between the two steps and a big gap. The fall was serious, with multiple injuries. The front desk and lobby manager of the hotel reacted immediately. They both said that the hotel had nothing to do with the phone call and the fall. There were yellow lines on the steps but no warning signs, and there was water underneath. More than a dozen iodophor cotton swabs were given, but there was no humanistic care at all. Later, I took a taxi to the hospital, complained to the local tourism bureau, and consulted a lawyer. The lawyer said that such a step itself has the possibility of causing personal injury, and the incident happened in the hotel. The hotel has an unshirkable responsibility. I have complained to the local tourism Bureau, still in process. The hotel has not responded at all, which is really disappointing.

It is strongly recommended to partners who come to Sanya, and they must choose to stay in Sanya Bay for at least one night to experience the punch card and experience the feeling of embracing the sea. Especially the service of Gu Min at the front desk, who helped us reserve a bus for the duty-free shop, so we can go shopping and experience it.

The hardware is old, the floor tiles are full of black dirt, the shower room leaks, the fish tank leaks, the WiFi is broken, and the power socket is broken. In the end, a maintenance worker came to fix the WiFi and power supply. Others are mixed. There are many old migratory birds who bought a house in the hotel. They chatted, drank and smoked loudly on the balcony, and there was an owner committee. This is obviously a residential area. ! Also, the breakfast environment is too messy. There are many varieties of dishes, but the quality is very poor. It feels like receiving an elderly tourist group. The key point is that there is a tall and fat man in his forties who wears a vertical shirt like a leader. His attitude It's very bad. I stayed for three days and saw that he killed several guests, including the elderly. How can this kind of attitude be used in the service industry? It's not because group buying can't refund for three days. I changed hotels on the same day. This hotel is too Scary, hope it helps someone in the future

Good service. When I checked in, the manager Yang Lei gave me a free upgrade to the sea view room. From the balcony, I can see the vastness of the sea and the beautiful southern gardens in the hotel. The day before I left the store, Manager Yang contacted me if I needed a late check-out, which made me feel that the hotel's service is very caring and heart-warming.
The environment is good. The hotel is located right by the sea. It is beautiful to enjoy the sunrise and sunset on the sea! The building of the hotel surrounds the garden full of green plants and flowers, and it is very pleasant to walk in it!
Good breakfast. The hotel's breakfast is very rich. In addition to the regular desserts, porridge and noodles, hot dishes are different every day. After staying for a few days, I tasted braised oxtail, beef with radish, stir-fried shrimp and squid rolls with cucumber, etc. They all tasted very good.
Good hygiene. The bedding in the hotel is very white and clean. There are tissue paper and alcohol-free hand sanitizer in the elevator, which is convenient to use.
In short, this accommodation experience is very satisfactory, and I will come again in the future!

It would be even more perfect if you can enjoy a discounted price if you stay permanently or monthly. The hotel's swimming pools and recreational facilities are suitable for parents and children, and the coconut grove beach lawn is also suitable for the slow-paced life of the elderly. Thank you Nie Jia for his warm hospitality, and look forward to the moment when we will be reunited after the epidemic subsides

2. The room is clean and the scenery is good: because there is no room on the lower floor, the front desk has upgraded the room type to the upper floor, the balcony can see the seaside, the room is clean as a whole, the sheets are dry and not damp, and the decoration furniture is very reasonable and comfortable all day long;
3. The service response speed is a little slow: maybe because there are too many people staying in the room, the response speed of the room service is relatively slow. Two pairs of disposable slippers and a set of children's bathrobes are required. As a result, after waiting for a long time and urging again, only the delivery is provided. bring a pair of slippers
4. Recreational facilities: Because there are fewer people, only one of the three swimming pools is open. The water in the swimming pool is very clean and clear. There are lifeguards around, and some staff have been cleaning up the fallen leaves in the depar**ent, but the swimming ring is rented, and you can use it by yourself. Take; In addition, through an underground passage, you can go directly to the seaside, the beach is very fine, and the photos are very good. The motorboat is 130 once in the off-season, but don‚Äôt let it ride too fast. It is said that it is a limited speed.
5. The breakfast has Chinese and Western styles, there are still many categories, and the ingredients are very fresh. Because we are relatively cheap during the epidemic, it still feels very good value for money;
6. The hotel offers a 5% discount on duty-free shops and travel photography. If you want to go to the duty-free shop, please apply for this 5% discount at the hotel front desk. I went to the duty-free shop first, so I did not enjoy the discount. The cooperating part-time photographer, gave 5 free copyrights, I only added an extra 30 yuan, the photographer was a little unhappy, when we said goodbye, he was very perfunctory and didn't even look at me directly, hahaha üòÑ

msg:A long-awaited seaside vacation turns into a sad and angry escape.
Thank you for the hotel's honest operation and loving service. The stay period is all 50% off the previous quotation, and the service is always the same. During the stay, the wide space of the seaside, the lush green environment, and the vibrant duck pond and fish pond will comfort the frustrated emotions and spend this unforgettable time.
Thanks to the local leaders of Sanya. Although the policy is not clear, the decision-making is delayed, there are misunderstandings and disputes during the critical period, but in the later stage, it can be understood that it bears the burden of humiliation and bears the blame for others!
The most despised is Beijing. When there are special planes to pick up people in most places, Beijing is silent, and local volunteers in Sanya clearly inform Beijing tourists that they cannot go back to Beijing. If they have real estate in other places, they can go to other places first. On the 15th, Hainan Sanya announced the opening of the airport. When tourists can leave the island according to regulations, they finally received a message from Beijing early in the morning. They are full of love and welcome home, but they are required to apply for tickets before returning to Beijing. There is a family of five in the hotel who are together every day, and two people pop up the window when purchasing tickets, and they need to unblock the pop-up window first. As promised, welcome home, but Fei Changzhun shows that flights back to Beijing have been canceled on a large scale, and there is only one flight per day. It's okay not to do anything, but you sing a high profile, which makes people doubt your integrity!

msg:The hotel facilities are too old. Although the room was upgraded, the bathtub was leaking. The child tried it on the first night, but he didn't dare to use it anymore. There was water on the ground. The air conditioner was on the balcony. Noisy and a little hot.
In particular, I want to complain about the service of the hotel. It is really disgusting for Samsung. I arrived at 8:30 p.m. and the room given is on the third floor. The most important thing is to indicate the high floor in the reservation order, and the hotel also confirms it. After arriving, a little brother at the front desk told me that the room was full and there was no room. I said I don't accept it, and he said we can't drive the other guests away, right? I can't accept this kind of dialogue. Since the room is full and the customer's needs cannot be arranged, why do you need to confirm the order, or why can't you communicate with the customer in advance? After my little brother asked me back, he didn't say sorry or anything, so he told me not to get excited. I was dragging my luggage with my child at night, and the room was unsatisfactory. After I insisted again and again, finally a senior little brother came to deal with the room, upgraded to the 15th floor of me, brought me into the room all the way, and told me that this room is for distinguished guests. Hehe, I can only sneer, is this any different from the advertisement picture made by the hotel for the two-bedroom, one-bedroom suite I booked? ! rights that should have been received. In the same situation of full house, Shangri-La's service attitude really left Guoguang Howard Johnson a few streets away. There is no smiling face at the front desk throughout the whole process. Talking is not negotiating, it is basically an attitude that you have to accept whatever I give you. Granted your rights, I have to thank Dade. This sense of service will not go long, and there are too many five-star hotels in Sanya with sea views.
The breakfast is really messy, all seats are full, you have to grab or wait for a seat when you enter the restaurant, there is no guidance and guidance, things are not replenished in time, and the quality of the breakfast is average.
In addition, the hotel's Yeyutang has a refreshing and refreshing, and the front desk of the hotel will deliver it, but I don't know why we didn't receive the coupons. The service lady of Yeyutang also asked me to go to the front desk to ask, saying that it may be based on the room type. So I reflected on it, maybe I shouldn't book a suite, I should book a standard room, I can't enjoy my rights when I book a suite. I don't care about the Qingbuliang given, and it's not that I can't afford it, so I spent money to buy four Qingbuliang at the hotel. It's just that this kind of discriminatory trea**ent feels very bad.
The service originally wanted to give two stars, but the aunt who cleaned the room was very good. I think the whole hotel gave me the best service, so I gave the aunt who cleaned the room one more star.
The advantage is that the scenery on the high floors is good, and the beach is only reached from the hotel gate to the gate and across the road.

The most annoying thing is that the service attitude of the manager on duty is extremely bad. When we went out from the west gate at noon, we were hit in the arm by the automatic lever. At first, we didn't think about embarrassing them. The security guard came out to take a look and left. (The security guard removed the sign blocking the sidewalk when we came back, and a roadblock sign was also added under the automatic pole. The security guard told us that he had seen 2 smashed when he was on duty, and more smashed on the opposite road. We were asked by the security guard. No security guard name) We also went out to the opposite shopping mall for dinner. The place where we were beaten was red and swollen within 10 minutes, the arm could not be used up, and the skin was slightly broken. Then we contacted the hotel, and the hotel told us that the contact person would come to our place. Take a look. After a while a manager on duty called and told us to go back from where we were eating. I walked back and forth for another half an hour. As soon as I got to the hotel lobby, I saw a manager rushing over with Yunnan Baiyao, not to mention spraying the place where my wife was hit red by the automatic lever. Are you sick, have I sprayed with you? This manager on duty named Yang Lei had an extremely perfunctory attitude. He led us all the way to the bar, and when we got there, he asked us what to do? It's ridiculous, after you checked the surveillance and hit someone, you don't want to solve the compensation plan, and you look like you are waiting for your offer. If you submit less, you agree, and if you submit more, you refuse. It's really easy to think, five-star hotels are here. Handling attitude, are you worthy too? Sure enough, if you let us drive, then we are welcome, and the room fee will be fully refunded. This is called Yang Lei's face immediately, it is impossible, or go to the hospital. Did I come to Sanya to see a doctor? Wasting time and energy to accompany you to the hospital? What he means is, you have made a big problem, let's talk about compensation, and if the skin is red and swollen, you are also worthy of compensation? Howard Johnson Guoguang takes this attitude, and it is shameful for the service industry to do such a thing. We don't care about any cheap upgrades, can you help you deal with vacancies? He also looks like a villain who is proud of his ambitions, obviously the shop is bullying customers. In the next two days, we went directly to Hilton Yalong Bay, and we will never come to Howard Johnson Guoguang Hotel again. This duty manager Yang Lei successfully brought Guoguang to a one-star level, congratulations to Guoguang.

msg:It should be the first batch of five-star hotels. Except for the rooms and the breakfast room, other public areas have no air conditioning and are hot. Breakfast is like a war to grab a seat. Fruit + coconut juice can be made into a simple version of refreshing and refreshing. It can only be said that you can eat enough. The yard is super large and must be well-organized. There is a whole large lawn, surrounded by various tropical trees. My favorite is frangipani, and I also saw small squirrels. Passing through the underground passage is the beach. The sand is relatively fine, and the waves are not small for jumping in the sea. The dinner delivered by the set menu is ok, but the serving is too slow. The room is a small suite, relatively dry. There are many swimming pools, but only the central part is opened, and the swimming pools on the two wings are not open. It is a pity that the wish to go down to the swimming pool after going out of the building has not been realized.

Because it was the first time I came to Sanya for vacation and stayed here, and then I came here every year one after another. I stayed in various hotels in other bay areas, and also in hotels in Sanya Bay. Only here are full of memories. It's like first love here, like the unforgettable beginning, so familiar and full of surprises. The style is more inclined to Southeast Asia. In the leisure and lazy vacation life, there are surprises everywhere.

The noodles are topped with meat sauce, the fruit varieties are also fresh, and the quality of bacon is good; the staff The attitude is also very good. Seeing that we have children, the lady at the front desk, Nie Jia, also gave us a free upgrade to a 2.4-meter-sized double-bed deluxe sea view room, and gave us a welcome gift, cookies, and a supplement. It‚Äôs cool. I‚Äôve been in Hainan for a few days and I‚Äôve been drinking it every day. I like them the most. They‚Äôre not so sweet and the ingredients are rich. The large lawn of the hotel is great for taking pictures, and children like it too.

I couldn't sleep because of the noise from the next door at 1.2 o'clock in the middle of the night. At 6 o'clock in the morning, the sound of planes rumbling overhead one after another, the breakfast table was all robbed, there was no waiter to arrange and guide, and no one cleaned up the place to pick up the meal. I'm not trying to live here cheaply, it costs 3100 yuan to stay for two nights. What a waste of money! Just let me put the room card at the front desk when I checked out, and the deposit was not refunded directly. I waited until 11 o'clock in the evening to call their front desk, and then told me to refund me immediately. It turned out that I forgot! ! ! Strongly do not recommend this hotel! Will never come again! ! !

msg:Stayed for four days, because the price is a bit high during the Spring Festival. There are several disadvantages: the room has problems with drainage due to aging facilities, and water is everywhere when you take a shower. The hotel is too big and too many people lead to a messy breakfast, and guests often need to organize their own plates. The room and the bathroom are connected, not even glass. Pros: The swimming pool, the hotel environment is really nice, the beach is beautiful and very close. The quality of some guests during the Spring Festival is really poor. There are people who smoke in the Children's Paradise, and people who smoke in the elevator, I really want to curse.

msg:As a five-star hotel, I stayed for three days this time. This experience is very bad. It‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve stayed in this hotel in Sanya. Maybe it‚Äôs too busy during the Chinese New Year. First of all, the check-in service attitude is very bad. It‚Äôs been a busy day for you, but it‚Äôs just the beginning for me. It turns out that I‚Äôm here for vacation. Sitting on the balcony is originally a leisure thing. I was splashed by the water upstairs many times, and no one responded after responding. When I went to the pool to swim, the staff confirmed my identity, which made me very embarrassed. I doubt that I am not a guest. Do I need to confirm this in front of me? Ask the waiter to deliver a quilt, but I will not take the quilt if I promise, and I will not take the water when I ask for it. There is no express delivery service. This should not be five star hotel.

The hotel is also very convenient to go to the beach. You don't have to go out the door for a long time. You can walk along the direction of the sea and there is an underground passage to the beach.
The hotel park is large and comfortable.
There are many pockets such as swimming pools and children's playgrounds.
My husband said that next time I bring my parents over in winter, I would like to live here too.
When I left, I accidentally smashed the ceramic ashtray on the balcony. When I checked out, I told the front desk that I would deduct 10 yuan from Ctrip. I said no problem. I feel like I still haven't picked it up in the end...

Every time I go to Sanya, I will choose Howard Johnson Hotel. Very close to the airport and easy to get off the plane. The swimming pool of the hotel is very large and the greenery is very good. Take the underground passage to the beach. Thank you Fang Qing for helping us upgrade our room.

It is also very convenient to shop and eat near the hotel. It's convenient. Dai Shuijuan, the deputy manager of the hotel lobby, has a very good service. He gave us a free upgrade to a sea view room. The hotel also gave us two refreshments every night. You can rest assured to let the baby play in the water, in short, very satisfied. Next time I come to Sanya, I will recommend Howard Johnson Guoguang to my friends.

He took the initiative to add me on WeChat, and gave us a lot of help during the stay.

You need to pick up the free drinks yourself, but the three waiters are together Playing with the mobile phone and whispering, the complimentary drinks are also unremarkable, in short, it feels very low.

msg:Very poor accommodation experience

1. I asked the front desk what was the difference with the booked Yizhi king bed. The front desk told me it was a high floor, so I asked if the room was quiet. The front desk said that I would change you to a quiet room, and finally gave me a very noisy room. It's really noisy. It's next to the road, and the sound is really loud.

2. Call before booking, and the front desk will inform you that there is a bed around. When I checked in, I said that I need 2 bed circumferences to be delivered to the room. The front desk said no problem. 4 hours passed and one was delivered. I called again and asked for another one, and the service center told me it would be delivered right away.

We took the kids out in the afternoon, played until it was time to go to bed at night, and came back to find that the second bed was not delivered, so we called again, and the service center informed that there was no bed. At that time, I was a little angry, and I said what should I do? The service center actually replied that I would transfer you to the front desk, and then immediately hung up on me and transferred to the front desk.

Then I repeated it to the front desk again, and the front desk told me to notify the housekeeper to deliver it to me now. Half an hour later, no one came, I called the front desk again, and the girl at the front desk said: Huh? Haven't sent it yet? Then he told me: Oh, there is no bedside, I said, why didn't you tell me? I've been waiting for you. ! ! ! ! The girl at the front desk said helplessly, I don't know, I just received the news. So I hung up the phone.

Seriously, please train these front office staff well.

This is still a deluxe sea view room. The hair dryer in the first room still didn't work. In order to rest well, I changed to another room. The shower drain was still clogged. The worker came to fix it for a while and agreed, but the drain was still very slow, and there was still the sound of the downpipe in the morning. The room is relatively old, and the WIFI at 0685 is still broken and cannot be connected.
Overall, sorry for the 5 star rating and the price, will never go to this hotel again.

Special thanks to Manager Yang in the lobby, Alan Chen, and the security brothers at the gates on both sides. They are enthusiastic, dedicated and thoughtful! You can get free nucleic acid one kilometer north of the hotel, and you can come back after half an hour by bike. The garden is big and the swimming pool is not bad. It is very important to wait for two days for transcoding. It's convenient to eat and buy things around. The hotel's restaurant and Yefengtang are all good and cost-effective!

But the service attitude really needs to be improved. When checking in, the lady at the front desk kindly gave two drink coupons, which can be exchanged for tea, coffee or drinks at the bar. It's written on the drink coupon.
After I went to the bar, a waiter told me that I was only allowed to exchange drinks, that is, canned Cokes. Obviously, there are all kinds of coffee written on the brand, but he firmly stated that it cannot be exchanged! ! ! Very bad attitude! ! ! The original good mood has also been destroyed!
If you can't redeem it, don't write it on the drink coupon, and the attitude is the same. Since I live in your shop, will I care about the drink price? It's just that Chunchun is disgusted by his bad attitude!
Is this the quality of a five-star hotel waiter?
There are so many hotels in Sanya, I suggest you be careful. Don't spoil the good mood!
There is no nucleic acid hotel, and you have to go a long way to the nearby community. There is no evaluation at all! !

After all, it is an old-fashioned hotel, and the older facilities can be compensated from the service. But the hotel front desk and concierge service really need improvement. From the time of check-in, the front desk staff did not smile, and the receptionist of the concierge did not take the initiative to help with luggage. A few times later, I took a taxi to the hotel to help pull the door. Maybe the concierge staff should look at the person. Seeing that the lady was running fast, she took the initiative to help with the luggage. On the contrary, the barbeque restaurant waiter service is very good.

Strengthen the management of access to the sea to prevent non-occupants from occupying poolside loungers. It would be better to increase the epidemic prevention testing here.

msg:It is perfect. After reading the public comments, I decided to stay at Howard Johnson Guoguang. The location is very good. The hotel is very high-end and a**ospheric. The garden-style hotel has a golf course, a large swimming pool and a barbecue garden, and it can directly reach the beach through the underground passage. Five stars He has all the things that a first-class hotel should have and should not have. When registering the room, the handsome guy at the front desk answered all the questions I asked in a very warm and thoughtful way, and asked about it. His name was Su Yang. I think this is the most cost-effective hotel in Sanya. It is quiet in the busy city, and it is almost zero distance from the beach. The landscaping area of the hotel accounts for almost 4/5 of the hotel. I will book this hotel next time I come to Sanya.

msg:Stayed at this hotel for three nights while taking my parents in Sanya. Personal feelings are as follows, the good aspects: 1, the hotel is very large, it is estimated that it should be the largest hotel in Sanya Bay. It can be said to be very stylish, huge lawn, huge building, all kinds of facilities, 2, the location is good, it is very convenient to walk from the hotel to the beach and the beach, there is an exclusive underground passage, which is very safe, and it is very close to the airport, only a taxi 15 minutes. 3. I ordered the package of the family suite. The sea can also be seen from the balcony. The family suite has two balconies, a large bedroom has a large double bed, and a small bedroom has a bed estimated to be 1.2 meters (sleeping one person is just right) ), there are two bathrooms and a living room, which is very suitable for a family of three or traveling with my parents like me. The aspects that the objective experience is not ideal: 1. The hotel is indeed a bit old, all kinds of facilities are very old, and many places appear to be a bit rundown (although it is still relatively clean); 2. The attitude and awareness of the hotel service staff are mixed: The waiters in the Chinese restaurant/lobby bar are nice. However, the service attitude and awareness of some staff at the front desk of the hotel need to be strengthened. When I checked out today, I communicated with the front desk staff about the invoice for the hotel room delivery, and there was an objection. Another front staff named Peng Shujuan was not very professional. , intensified the contradiction of communication. Later, the head of the front desk came forward and quickly solved the problem. I personally think that the hotel management should strengthen the training of the front desk staff's work process, service awareness, and problem-solving methods. 3. The opening hours of the gym are not continuous. In short, the hardware and software of this hotel is definitely not comparable to the newly opened five-star hotel, but the price is not very expensive, as long as it is not too picky, it should be enough.

Very beautiful hotel, great outdoor environment, granddaughter likes it very much. The indoor hot spring pool is also very comfortable. The refreshing and refreshing in the lobby bar is recommended, but the price is a bit high. Because the child didn't move to the big bed room, the waiter helped to merge the small bed. It's a pity that the indoor children's amusement park was closed, and I didn't know about it beforehand, and it was raining again. Fortunately, Uncle Li's farm was there to see it, which made the children happy. The fly in the oin**ent, neighbors quarrel at night, there may be long-term owners, the noise is too loud, and the noise is more than 11 o'clock.

msg:The first bad review given since downloading Ctrip. At 4.30 in the morning, my child and I were woken up by the noise of the hotel, and the phone in the room was not working, so Ctrip had to find the front desk and call. Then the child couldn't sleep until 6 o'clock, saying that he had a stomachache and was hungry. In a negotiable manner, I asked the hotel if I could give breakfast, because many breakfasts take at least 40 minutes to be delivered, and the hotel can open the meal at 6.30. Was told by the hotel that a breakfast of 180 will not be sent. When I went downstairs to the front desk to communicate, the assistant manager of the lobby had a very bad attitude. First, she didn't apologize for the noise of the hotel, and second, she didn't solve the problem. I said that I am not satisfied with your hotel solution and do not agree with it. Although the hotel has only been booked for two days, my itinerary has 10 days, and I can always wait for a satisfactory solution at your hotel. The deputy manager of the lobby immediately said that Lai in our hotel has a way. In desperation, the only thing to do is to call the police. I really have no good feelings for Sanya for a second. There are many hotels in Sanya, but every hotel represents Sanya, and every staff member is also the spokesperson of Sanya's image! I hope that the hotel will deal with the words and deeds of the deputy manager of the lobby in the future, causing trouble to others and not solving it, but also causing bad influence to others' mood. This kind of hotel is like this. If you live well, everyone will be fine. One thing is not good, the four words of the store bully are properly reflected. In addition, objective evaluation: the hotel environment and supporting facilities are good, but the hardware is not good, the accommodation conditions are very poor, and some equipment is probably still in the 1990s.

msg:Let's talk about hardware first. The building of the hotel is very large. The breakfast restaurant faces the garden and the beach, and the scenery is good. The guest room is an open corridor, which has the advantage of being well ventilated, but there is a swimming pool downstairs in the hollow part. If someone gets up early or shouts in the swimming pool late at night, the whole building will listen, which is a bit noisy. The room maintenance is general, the bathroom wall is moldy.
Speaking of services, I booked a family room, and Ctrip also wrote that it can accommodate three people, but there are only two people's spare parts such as towels, towels, cups, slippers, and bathrobes, and the complimentary drink is also two small bottles of water per day. A bit stingy.
One morning, when I was about to finish breakfast, an intern waiter was beside me and started to clear the cutlery (not a bone-changing dish), and asked my family to hand over the large soup bowl (and half a bowl of soup) that she could not reach. For her, she felt a little uncomfortable and decided to get up and leave. At this time, she spilled a large bowl of soy milk on my chair and splashed on my bag. I asked her why she couldn't wait until I was gone, and she looked righteous. Complaint to the restaurant manager, very politely apologized, will strengthen training, criticize the staff, and give me a piece of fruit. In the morning after breakfast, someone called me to verify the situation, and said they would punish the employee and give me fruit. However, when I checked out on the third day, I didn't deliver it... If you can't deliver it, don't promise it, you should do it if you promise it. To sum up, there is still room for improvement in the management of the hotel. For a five-star hotel, such a problem should not occur.

The waiters have a good attitude, especially Gu Min, the little girl at the front desk, who gave us a late check-out time, and gave sincere opinions when we asked about the itinerary before going to the airport, which was very considerate.
Passing through the hotel's invincible lawn, and a short underground passage to the seaside, the location in the middle of the Yemeng Corridor is breathtakingly beautiful! This is the beach vacation of your dreams! So happy! From here, it is convenient to go to Phoenix Island by helicopter, or to go to Luhuitou to go to sea by boat. Finally, the Qingbuliang in the lobby bar on the first floor is the best food in Sanya for so many days! I ate it before going to the airport, and the trip was a complete success!

üßπHygiene: That's not bad, the express hotel is better than it, the table is dirty, the cups are not cleaned, there is hair in the washbasin. Even more exaggerated: turning on the shower head seems to turn on the tractor, making a lot of noise.

The hotel as a whole and the room feel very worn out. It is estimated that in order to save money, many places have not turned on the lights, and the facilities have not been refurbished. The phenomenon of random parking is serious, and they are all parked on the grass, and no one cares at all.

Breakfast: The variety is pitiful, the quality is indescribably poor, and the crowd is quite confusing. There is no crowd control, and when you arrive, you can enter directly, go in and grab a seat yourself, and even need to make a table. The seats are dirty with leftovers and can only be cleaned by themselves.

Other facilities in the hotel: I didn't dare to use it at all, it looked dirty and old. Especially the heated pool.

Don't affect your holiday mood in order to save two dollars. Value for money is too low.

The management of the swimming pool is also not good. The swimming lanes are clearly drawn out, and they are all standing there with children. Can the hotel manage it? ? Otherwise, if we open a children's pool alone, we adults are not people without children? The service is also not good. I called three times for disposable slippers and water, and waited for more than half an hour to be delivered. The little brother at the door and the service staff you meet on the road are all more enthusiastic, which is good. Overall not worth the price.

The family struggled for a long time and finally opened it. Dare to lock it, because I really can‚Äôt get out, the smell in the room is a bit strong, (there is a certain reason for being close to the sea), there are two bedrooms in the room, one faces the sea, and the other has only half of the windows and faces the hotel Yes, opening the window is the corridor of the hotel, which is equivalent to a room without windows. After asking, the reply I got was that all the two-room luxury suites have such a design and structure. I don‚Äôt understand. There is only one swimming pool in the hotel, but it‚Äôs enough Yes, the breakfast is quite satisfactory. It will be difficult to find a table after 8 o'clock. The waiter is slow. You can't choose the packed breakfast by yourself, but the waiter can help you pack it. The lady at the front desk of the hotel is not very friendly. I stayed for five or six days and wanted to delay it until the afternoon Checking out at two o'clock also disagreed. Finally, Ctrip came forward to coordinate and delayed until two o'clock. This has never happened in other hotels. I am ashamed of the name of the five-star hotel. I hope that the hotel manager will strengthen the renovation management of hotel facilities and humanistic care for employees, and increase the emphasis on guest satisfaction. In addition, one hour before the queue at the nucleic acid testing point recommended by the hotel, other hotels where my friend stayed recommended the nearby Yangxin Market monitoring point. really speechless

msg:Speechless, I booked a hotel a week in advance, but the price was actually reduced the day before I checked in. This is the first time I encountered it!
Second, there are many netizens who have stepped on the pit of this store, and they still choose it. The main reason is that Ctrip's score is good, but it is still a miscalculation. It is 100% positive, and many comments even mention the staff of such and such. The name is outrageous. How can you pay attention to the nickname of the staff member when you stay in a hotel normally? Anyway, I stayed for five days and didn't think the service was commendable. First of all, I checked into the hotel in the early morning of the 12th. The car arrived at the door of the hotel. There was a waiter standing at the key entrance, and there was no staff to send it after check-in. It was such a big hotel, and he walked with a confused face. Secondly, during the entire hotel check-in process, the service of the staff can be said to be completely lacking, and they will not take the initiative to say hello. I don't take the initiative to be courteous, and I even feel embarrassed to see the staff and customers arguing about whether to pay or not while swimming!
In addition, let‚Äôs talk about hotel facilities. The hotel‚Äôs hardware conditions are not too bad for more than ten years, but the software is a bit too bad. The tap in the room you stay in can never be turned off. On the day of check-in, you see the last guest staying with water. I have been staying, and secondly, there is a burning smell in the kettle. The hair dryer is estimated to be a product of more than ten years ago. The fan is very small, and it takes more than 40 minutes to blow the head. It is not complicated to replace these things, right? As a five-star hotel, the services, facilities, and supporting facilities should not be like this. In short, I am disappointed üòû!

msg:üöó Transportation: This hotel is very well chosen as an old five-star hotel. Although it is not far from the airport (it takes about 20 minutes to get there by bus No. 8), the plane noise is not big. It only takes 10 minutes to go through the underground passage from the hotel to the Coastal Avenue Guoguang Binhai Garden Bus Station. There are many shuttle routes available within the station. In particular, the 8th bus will start at 11 o'clock in the evening, and you can safely get back to the hotel if you get on the 8th bus. You can scan a Tencent public bus program to automatically deduct the fee after getting on the bus. Hainan Bus is charged by mileage and you have to scan the code to get on and off the bus. With this small program, it is convenient and worry-free. Don't swipe the QR code on the bus stop sign. It's a huge pit to cheat moneyüò≠
üßπHygienic: I personally think that the room and guest room are very good, there is no musty or moisture when the door is opened. The bathroom is clean and smell-free. The bed and the room are neat and orderly. I don‚Äôt know why other guests who have stayed in leave such bad comments. Is it because I booked The 270-degree luxury ocean view room on the top floor was too breezy to blow away the musty smell and moisture in the room, so it was dry and odor-free. No matter what others say, I have not been bitten by mosquitoes or crawled by mites for 5 days. If you want to travel and book a five-star hotel, you don‚Äôt have to search for it. If you want to be cheap, choose a low-rise floor close to the trees and rooms that are not sunny, that‚Äôs sure to have mosquitoes. A special package for staying a few nights, I just booked this package and it‚Äôs cost-effective to only 650 per day, which is equivalent to a pairing ü§ó
üçÉEnvironment: The hotel is built with Southeast Asian characteristics. The hotel has a lot of free play items and free buffet breakfast (the variety is rich and it is no problem to eat). It is a hotel suitable for the whole family to book when traveling.
üîîService: The service is the shortcoming of this hotel and I especially want to complain. The delivery service writes that it will be delivered in 30 minutes and will never be delivered to you one minute in advance. So when you book the hotel meal, you must be a thousand early Don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre hungry and make a reservation. It‚Äôs better to go out and eat quickly. The hotel is too big and there are too many rooms. If there are more than 1,000 guest rooms, they must be transferred to the front desk. Five or six staff at the front desk will serve more than 1,000 guests. Is unrealistic. I hope that the hotel will improve on this. At least one floor manager will be arranged on each floor to manage the tenants on this floor, so that it will be more convenient and quick to solve the problemü§î

The coconut groves along the way are so beautiful and the beach is huge. I have been to Sanya several times and it is my first time to stay in Sanya Bay. The hotel is a bit old, but it is still well maintained. There is a lot of greenery. I like the large lawn in front of the restaurant. Fang Qing at the front desk is very patient and gentle. He helped me upgrade to a sea view room and also gave me a dish, which was a set meal purchased by the hotel, so I didn‚Äôt spend any money on lunch. Small snacks were provided in the room. I only stayed here for one day. I will come back in the future.

msg:To be honest, I booked for three days, and I went to check out the next day, but for various reasons, no refund was given. This hotel has dropped stars for food poisoning before, but the price has not come down. The children's playground is charged separately, the fitness equipment is free, and other ball games are charged. Only the middle one can be used for the swimming pool, the rest are all closed. We lived in Wanning, and we passed through Sanya by plane for a few days. The guy who checked in was reluctant to upgrade the house (there was a free upgrade in my reservation). The room has to go through a corridor to the room. This corridor is fenced. If there is no seal (picture 6), people who are afraid of heights should stay away. The only satisfaction is that there are small animals, and the peacocks are very scary in the early morning and evening. The little bunny and children like it very much. Crossing the road is the seaside. On the west is the Conifer Hotel, on the east is the Haiyun Hotel, the Jinghai Holiday Hotel, and the Haiju Berman Hotel. In June, the off-season, the deluxe garden view sea view room, the room is very small, compared with these, I feel that this hotel is not very cost-effective for nearly 600 yuan a day. The breakfast has few varieties and is not delicious. Will not live next time. I recommend the Haiyun Hotel next door. For more than 300 yuan, you can see the same sea, live in the same room type, and the room is large.

Special thanks to Fang Qing, the hotel‚Äôs waiter, for his thoughtful and meticulous service, because this time I came to my parents to choose a rental house for the winter. Fang Qing gave a lot of advice, which made it easier and faster for us to find the desired property. The hotel service is very attentive and enthusiastic. Let us start a wonderful trip to Sanya.

msg:The hotel is large in scale and is located in the core of Sanya Bay, with an underground passage directly to the beach. There is a large green area in front of the lobby, which can be described as a highlight. The leisure sea view room booked can see the side sea view, and the area is not small. In addition to the open-air swimming pool, there is also an indoor hot spring swimming pool, which is unfortunately only open in the afternoon and evening, so I don‚Äôt have time to experience it for one night. Hotel decoration is my favorite Southeast Asian style, but maybe there are more Southeast Asians, and I always feel that Guoguang has its own style, but it lacks it. The shortcomings of the hotel are also obvious: one is that there is no service; the other is that there are too many people in the breakfast room, and the dining table and chairs are cheap, which do not match the style of the hotel, and the dining experience is extremely poor; the third is that the room facilities are old; the fourth is that there is no underground parking lot. You have to drag your suitcase to the lobby after parking. Generally speaking, it is okay to stay in a hotel, but the price/performance ratio is not high. The hotel is too big and has a large number of occupants, which affects the vacation experience.

The experience of Guoguang Howard Johnson is that it is very cost-effective. Let me talk about the advantages first:
1. Service
Check-in that day was already around one in the morning, but the two young ladies at the front desk (cici, the other one can‚Äôt remember) received us very warmly and asked our needs very carefully, as well as when the room was sufficient Helped us to upgrade the room type with 180-degree sea view;
2. Environment
The overall environment can be seen as an old hotel. Although it has been in some ages, the details are still in place. The prompts and the waiters at work can be seen everywhere. The pure Thai architectural style makes people feel like they are in Thailand, this is very commendable in the post-epidemic era.
3. Cost performance
The price, scenery and meals are all very cost-effective, with at least 1,000 in Haitang Bay.
The main disadvantage is that the air volume in the room is really small, and there are no other shortcomings.
Generally speaking, it is a very recommended hotel. Next time I come to Sanya, I will consider how to stay in Guoguang Howard Johnson.

msg:I came to this hotel 10 years ago and had a very good impression. I recommended it to my wife 10 years later. Before my wife could criticize me, I blushed:
1. The hotel still has the standard equipment of hotels in the last century that has long been unused: ‚òéÔ∏è pavilions. In today's world where everyone wants to üà∂Ô∏è two mobile phones, is this a display of classics or a lack of ambition?
2. The posters in the elevator are shaky. Could it be that the hotel staff who take the elevator every day can't see it?
3. Next to the closed hot spring swimming pool, there is a "warm reminder" that insults guests and says: In order to improve customer satisfaction... close the hot spring swimming pool. You know, the hot spring swimming pool is the selling point of this hotel!
4. The guest went to the lobby bar to buy a refreshing tonic and was told that it was 38 yuan. He was also told that it would cost 29 yuan to place an order with **. Is there such a business that doesn't know how to do business?
5. The underground floor is scary dark except for dining time. Looking around, the huge space is empty, and the scattered furniture shows a decadent scene. The empty hot spring swimming pool looks like an ancient Roman water dungeon
6. Only the main pool in the ground is fully open, and the rest are only one foot of water for demonstration
7. The hotel guide in the room is still the same as when it opened, but matches were still placed in the room, encouraging bad habits
All of the above downgraded the five-star hotel to below three stars. It feels like the hotel is going bankrupt. In fact, most of the problems are management problems that can be solved without spending money as long as you are serious and responsible. Please think about it.
Praise: The receptionists at the hotel front desk are all enthusiastic. It is worth praising. They listened to my suggestions to the hotel and took the initiative to upgrade my room. Special praise for Miss "Bu Shuo" (WeChat nickname), who asked after get off work whether the water provided in the room was enough to drink...very enthusiastic.

msg:From the perspective of parent-child, there are relatively few parent-child projects. The overall service of the hotel is very good. The breakfast is rich and tastes good. At first, I didn‚Äôt dare to order after reading the bad reviews. Later, after a long struggle, I chose Guoguang Howard Johnson. It is still very good. The young lady Zhang Yaqi at the front desk has a very good attitude and helped us upgrade the sea-view big bed room for free. The younger brother at the front desk saw the child crying and offered to give a tortoise toy to the child. The room is large, tidy and clean, and he often cares during the stay. We can respond to our questions in a timely manner. The hotel is very close to the beach, a few minutes away, there is a dedicated passage directly to the beach, the hotel‚Äôs large lawn is simply too comfortable. When we went back, Zhang Kai from the concierge took the initiative to help us with our luggage. The child hurt his foot and hurried to help us get iodophor cotton swabs and band-aids. I still don't know why those bad reviews are. Next time I go to Sanya, I also choose Guoguang Howard Johnson üòÇ

A blessing in disguise this time, because of the cancellation of the typhoon flight, I can only stay in Sanya for one more night. I quickly picked this one. Because it was temporary, I went directly to the front desk and asked about the reservation. Although the whole person was wet and not in a good mood at the time, the experience of the front desk service was still ok. Van helped us upgrade the room type. üëç.
üõÄFacilities:
The overall hotel is super big. We stayed in a sea view room with a wide view. It just so happens that you can still see the flowers and plants planted on the terrace on the balcony, which is also somewhat romantic. My personal favorite is the entire lawn in front of the pool, and the hotel also has its own underground passage leading to the beach. Fortunately, the day I was staying in was a sunny day, so I quickly enjoyed the sunshine, beaches and lawns of Hainan in the hotel üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. The night view of the hotel is also good.

Children dig sand and swim every night. The balcony is especially good. It faces the sea and has a wide view. Especially like the big terrace! Haha, follow us out to eat and drink during the day. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt go to West Island due to the weather. I will go again next time. In addition, Miss Gu Min at the front desk recommended daily children's mini game schedules, which added a lot of interesting links to our stay. The children participated in two days of small activities, doing handicrafts, sports, and little girl Gu Min is very concerned about our needs and solves our problems all the time. Although there was a little episode at the end, it was still pretty good overall. The location of the hotel is also good, not far from popular places in Sanya. Especially there is an exclusive passage to the beach. I ran three kilometers along Sanya Bay in the morning. It was a rare experience!

It turned out that it was very large. Although the rooms are relatively old, they are also clean and large. Bring the baby twin room into a super big bed in seconds! The breakfast is also very good, rich in variety and very solid; currently only the center swimming pool is open, which is enough for children to play. Originally there were river swimming pools on both sides, which should be very good. The hotel‚Äôs lawn is very wide, and the hotel‚Äôs exclusive tunnel under the lawn is the beach. Although Sanya Bay is crowded with people, it‚Äôs great to watch the sunset. Both dinners were served at the hotel. Hainanese food was delicious. It‚Äôs about 100 per capita. Can choose~

The children were very happy to see the room, and the hotel room was also clean. The style of the hotel is partial to the Southeast Asian style, and it feels like a holiday when you walk in. The lawn, swimming pool, and children's playground are simply too friendly for families with small children. In addition, I have to mention the unique "underground passage" of the hotel. It is very convenient to walk through the passage to the seaside. All in all, this is a very good experience. Next time I go to Sanya, I will choose Howard Johnson Guoguang Resort.

I usually sleep on a soft bed at home. The hotel‚Äôs bedding is also very good. The mattress is moderately firm and firm. After a few days of sleep, I didn‚Äôt suffer from backaches. I fell asleep as soon as I lay down in the bed. This time I came here mainly for children. For the first birthday, there are cribs, solid wood bed rails, and sponge surrounds.

msg:The location of the hotel is good, but Sanya Bay is indeed much worse than Long Bay, dirty and noisy. The internal environment of the hotel is OK, there are many swimming pools but only one is open outside, and there is no amu*****t equipment. The indoor heated swimming pool is shallow, a place for small children to play. The service is in line with Sanya's usual standards, no smiles and no greetings, breakfast is late every day, the waiter picks up the meal on time at 10:30, the child is picking up the meal once, and the waiter directly takes the plate away, as if no one was picking up the meal. Then started mopping the floor, and one or two waiters stood a meter or two near the table, waiting to close the table, feeling extremely uncomfortable eating. Urgently need to strengthen service training!

Basically, there was everything that should be available, and the service was in place. Gui Yueying at the front desk warmly welcomed us and handled it. Upgrading and late check-out. The cleaning brother and the swimming pool are very polite. People feel the warmth in the epidemic. The view of the hotel is very good and the swimming pool is relatively large. In short, it was a perfect experience.

msg:During this trip to Hainan, due to the epidemic, I chose to travel by car, and I was completely comfortable with the situation. There was no reservation and no itinerary. I didn't expect to bring many small surprises. Howard Johnson Guoguang is the most cost-effective place to stay during this seven-day holiday, thanks to the warm and meticulous explanation by the front desk of the hotel, Nie Jia. Originally, I only came here to explore the store, so the reception staff is very important. Although the decoration of the hotel is a bit outdated, the quality is still very good, and the service standard is also the old five-star standard. Howard Johnson Guoguang is the only one in Seven Days Hotel that provides towel service in the swimming pool. These days, I have been depressed that the resort‚Äôs swimming pool does not provide towels. It can be seen that the service quality of the hotel is standard. The swimming pool has a beautiful and open environment, and the adult zone is separated from the children zone a little distance, so you can have what you need, and there are many service staff. It's a pity that time is tight and I can't feel the scenery of the beach and listen to the sound of the waves again. Thank you Howard Johnson for putting a perfect end to the whole vacation. For this price, I gave it all five stars and recommended it to many friendsüòúüòäü•≥ü•≥

The hotel is comfortable (I booked a suite with a large bed and 2 small beds), the swimming pool is clean and big enough, breakfast is abundant, and there are many choices for eating around. And it's super convenient to go to the beach, and you won't be woken up by the waves at night. Next time you travel on the west line, you will still choose to live in Howard Johnson.

msg:During the Spring Festival, there were many people in the lobby.
Check in service attitude is also average, there may be many people, but not enthusiastic.
The hardware of the hotel room is old and the hygiene is average. When you enter the door, you will find melon seed shells.
The sofa in the room has hair and stains.
Call the reservation depar**ent and ask if you can arrange the reserved room closer. The reservation depar**ent didn't even think about it, and replied directly, sorry that this request could not be satisfied. I said you are a little arrogant, can you check if you can. Reservations direct reply - yes.
The shower was leaking and the bath water became hot for no apparent reason.
We live on the 13th floor, and downstairs is the swimming pool. At 11 o'clock in the evening, we can still hear the noise of children, which affects sleep.
The floor is not soundproof, you can hear clearly when you walk with the door closed.
The heated swimming pool on the first floor is suitable for children to play, only 1.1 meters. And the swimming pool has no bathroom.
There is an indoor children's play area downstairs, but there is a charge.
The mattress was too hard, and I had a back pain when I slept.

All in all, this time, it was a deep step on the thunder. Although the renovation of 16 years is long, it is not a reason, so it is not very recommended to stay. There are also several better options around.

msg:The family trip booked a two-room supreme sea view suite. This time it should be the most shocking time among the five-star hotels booked on Ctrip. I have never seen such a poor five-star hotel. Even if the facilities are outdated, the hygiene is quite poor. It can be said to be dirty, there are food residues and stains on the ground, and the toilet üöΩ still smells bad, which is really unappetizing. The most unbearable thing is that the rooms next to and upstairs are for sale units, regular housing, and the fumes from cooking and cooking. The smell and seafood all entered our room along the balcony and vent, and it felt like living in a seafood market; and we were assigned a seat next to the street, the windows were not closed, and there was traffic noise, it was really amazing ! Originally booked for three nights, I directly asked Ctrip to negotiate with the hotel to cancel for two nights. I really can't stay there. Please choose carefully!

msg:Hotels in Hainan are generally expensive. I want to choose a room with a sea view at a glance, a beautiful swimming pool suitable for children to play in, and the hotel that is the closest to the beach on foot. I am really poor.
This time I came to Sanya for a one-week vacation. I checked some guides on the Internet. My friend recommended Guoguang Howard Johnson, so I chose this as the first stop. Linda Liu (ÂàòÊò•Ááï) checked in on the day of check-in. Now the service is so nice. Well, I added her WeChat account and checked the room cleaning with me every day. I also provided more drinking water. The service was very considerate, so I stayed for another night later. Thank you Linda for your help during our stay.
It‚Äôs very close to the airport, and you need to go through an underground passage from the beach. This room type is chosen for my parents. I brought my parents and son to Sanya. In fact, if it‚Äôs not a hotel, it‚Äôs really nothing to choose a sea view room. Old people are accustomed to traveling by visiting scenic spots. We leave early and return late every day. It is no different from a travel agency. It is very late to return to the hotel. By the end of the day, I haven't gotten into the hotel swimming pool. The hotel has two areas with swimming pools open. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast buffet is very rich, and hot dishes are changed every day. Due to the climate of Sanya, for the hotel rooms that have been open for a long time, the room facilities will be more or less damp, especially wood materials. The hotel industry in Sanya is still very competitive. In addition to hardware, everyone is fighting for various services. It's not easy.

From 10pm onwards, I don't know what kind of rubbish people live in 5080 upstairs. They have been pulling chairs and making a lot of noise. I called the hotel front desk twice and told them that I have to catch a flight early the next morning. I asked them to move more gently, but it didn't improve. What's more terrible is that the people upstairs have a bad attitude and move chairs more heavily. It lasted until 12pm. On January 9th, I wish you all a *** on that day. What kind of rubbish come to travel?

The lobby is large and crowded, so no one helps with luggage, and the service has been improved. The hotel has an underground passage to the sea in about 10 minutes. There are a lot of private trips by the sea to introduce you, and after seeing the effect (picture 5), I feel like I'm in the pit again. In terms of the price, starting from the first 10 yuan, the last 160 shots cost 200 yuan. What kind of bed has fleas, the air conditioner is not cooled or the bathroom is clogged, and it hasn‚Äôt been tricked. It should be considered lucky. But I also prepared a mite-removing kit, mosquito-killing liquid, and Fengyoujing. If you have children, you must be prepared. The swimming pool bonus point is 7:30 in the morning and I can‚Äôt stand it for an hour if I go out for an hour. My baby loves to soak in the swimming pool and I know many children. The swimming pool is cleaned early in the morning and it is a satisfying experience.

Li Yuqian, the little brother at the front desk, is very enthusiastic and can give you a good introduction to hotel facilities and answer all kinds of questions you have during your trip, giving you a feeling of spring breeze. Because it is a veteran hotel, all facilities are slightly worn, but the maintenance is done well, and it does not make people feel stale. It is particularly convenient to go to the seaside, and there is a dedicated access to the sea.
There are many places to eat within 1 kilometer, the hotel‚Äôs own restaurant tastes generally good service, breakfast is slightly mediocre, you can eat but you don‚Äôt need to consider the quality. All in all, Howard Johnson Guoguang is a hotel worth staying again.

The front desk also upgraded the 90-degree ocean view room for free, but reminded that if you feel noisy during the renovation of the West District, you can contact them at any time. However, we hardly heard any major construction movement during the three days we stayed. The hotel is close to the airport, and it costs more than ten yuan to take a taxi, but the sound of the plane is not heard at all. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is relatively rich, and the price is very good. There are balloons or marshmallows for children at the door. The hotel has outdoor children‚Äôs entertainment facilities. Indoors are not expensive, but they are all very good. Cleanliness and hygiene are in place, we asked to send two more bottles of mineral water, and the waiter will arrive by the automatic walking machine in a moment (there are a lot of rooms, this is a must). The hotel pool is awesome, clean, not crowded, and open for a long time. There is a big lawn in the hotel, and the beach is just one passage! A very unforgettable trip. I have stayed in several hotels in Yalong Bay before. This hotel is really cost-effective! Suitable for parent-child travel!

The hotel is very large and comfortable. The young lady at the front desk, Gu Min, is very nice. She always helps to solve the problem. She also gave me a free upgrade to a higher-level room. She opened the window to see the sea and was very happy~
The hotel‚Äôs swimming pool is very large, and I took a swim ring for a while in the evening and morning. You can go directly to the seaside from the tunnel through the hotel. The beach is quite beautiful and comfortable to step on. I saw the super beautiful sunset.
After dinner in the evening, I took a bottle of beer and walked on the beach to admire the moon. Listening to the sound of the sea walking on the waves, I felt that it was worth doing nothing for this trip.
When the weather is not so hot, come to Sanya again~~ You can bring your parents to live next time, I think they will also like it very much.

The first is that it is close to the airport and can be reached by taxi.

Secondly, the greening rate is very high. It feels like playing in a tropical botanical garden. And the big goose is very cute,

The most important thing is that the pool is big and beautiful.

The service is even better. Thanks to Mr. Yang Lei, the front office manager, for his help. For those who come to Sanya for the first time, I feel very warm. Various questions have been answered, and I am in a good mood. I can feel that it is serving every guest from the heart.

Finally, the restaurant tastes great, the environment is good, and the price is very high!

Will come again! Suitable for leisure travel for the elderly!

Four people stayed out of the hotel and walked through the underground passage to reach the seaside at 5 or 6 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon. You can find a seaside photographer to take pictures. It is best to bargain at the package price or take pictures in half an hour and an hour. I chose to take more than 100 pictures in one hour. You can bargain for the best 100 times. A very happy one.
