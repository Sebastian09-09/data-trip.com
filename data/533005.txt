msg:My family (3 year old and 1 year old) and I loved the stay here! The front desk was so helpful and worked hard to communicate with us and make us feel welcome. We ate 2 meals here - a dinner and breakfast buffet. Both were delicious. The room was fun - the kids like the giant stuffed animals. They also left us a fruit tray as a snack. 

The children’s play area (ticket required) was fun. The children loved it. The farm animals looked healthy and well cared for.  We played for 5-6 hours. Langyue spa was fun and relaxing for everyone. It was very good for kids to play — I wanted to stay longer, but the kids were tired after so much play. Haha. We live in Beijing and will definitely visit again for a fun and easy staycation with the family. Thank you!

msg:The airport is not far away, which is very convenient.
The breakfast menu is not very large, but it has all the necessary dishes and is very clean. Because it was a holiday, the hotel had many guests, but they were seated immediately and the seats were comfortable.
The room size is good, the wardrobe is large enough, and there is a safe, which is good.
Although the room I stayed in was on the first floor, it looked about two floors high from the outside, which protected the privacy very well.
The surrounding scenery is beautiful and the walking path is also wide, which is very good.
The wireless network is very slow, which is a bit troublesome. The connection is OK in China, but the connection overseas is too slow.
The hotel is large, but there are no 24-hour convenience stores and other store facilities, which is a bit inconvenient.
There are not many places for dinner, so you have to go out or order takeout.
The management is good, but the facilities are a bit old and it seems that they need to be renovated as soon as possible.
There is a cafe in the lobby, but there are no permanent staff and the waiting time is long.
Overall, I want to give a good review.

There are also hot springs, outdoor expansion areas, and indoor party halls. The scenes are very rich, suitable for corporate team building, family leisure, and friends gatherings.
The room has good lighting. Although it is not very new, it is well equipped and the supplies are clean and hygienic. Moreover, the environment is quiet, and the sleeping conditions are much better than those of hotels in the city. You can sleep well and wake up in the morning to the sound of birds and flowers. The breakfast in the restaurant is also very delicious, and the service is considerate. It is worth recommending.

msg:The last time I went was in 2014, and I had a good impression at that time. I can only go this time. Shanzhai clubmed is not yet good, and has lost its original advantages.
First of all, it is not good: the maintenance of the equipment is too poor, and the public number reservation unit is not maintained, showing "too many complaints". Ctrip's inquiry message went unanswered. In the private soup room, the dry and wet steam in it are all broken. After inquiry, all 10 rooms are broken. No maintenance. Pomegranate seeds and long hair were found in the soup pool. This was the second bubble that came out the next day, so you can imagine how long it has been deposited. Room wallpaper cracked and watermarked. The private soup room is upstairs in Tangquan. To go up behind the canteen that sells swimsuits, you need to go up three flights of stairs and there is no elevator. If you have inconvenient legs, don't do it. The children's playground projects outside are very tasteless. The all-inclusive package for adults 650 and children 550 is also very tasteless.
The Japanese restaurant may have closed down. It is said that it has not opened for a year. The Chinese restaurant danced with two flies throughout the whole process. The taste is very strange. The more expensive dishes are not delicious, such as a wagyu beef grain, and the cheap home-cooked dishes are not bad, such as the scallion cake with lump soup.
When I checked in, I felt that the sales model here might be bulk sales and I developed myself offline. I can't deny this sales model. Anyway, I feel that the vegetable market is rubbing together. Now I can see the sausages falling from the breakfast buffet. The melon rind is placed directly on the side of the clip on the fruit table, and the food is served while tasting. The buffet breakfast stands next to you and forces you to eat quickly (there are many people at breakfast but there is no management at the front desk. And snot in the hallway...
Good: The service staff are very friendly and responsible. Good attitude, take the initiative to greet.

ps: There is a welcome kung fu tea in the private soup room. The tea quality is surprisingly good
ps: I read some comments earlier that some people complained that breakfast coffee costs money, which is not true. Freshly brewed coffee is free, and there is a fresh grinder at the water table at the entrance for 35 cups.

msg:Staying during the 11th, very bad experience, it is the first time to write so much in Ctrip for so many years
When booking, I didn’t know that the price does not include hot spring tickets. Other hot spring hotels I have stayed in before are included, and not only the hot springs must be purchased separately, but the swimming pool must also be purchased to enter the swimming pool, which is really weird
I was even more disappointed when I entered the room. As soon as I entered the door, there was a smell of smoke. I opened the windows, the air conditioner, and the door, but it didn't work for a long time. Later, I asked the customer service for an air purifier, and it was on for an afternoon, and it was a little better at night.
The lights in the room were too dim, so I booked two rooms together, one with brighter lamps, the one I stayed in was obviously in disrepair and had insufficient wattage and aging. I asked the front desk, and the front desk said, "Our hotel is warm light" , please, warm light does not mean dark, okay? When the guest is a **? This pretext may not be too fooling people, right? From the corridor, it is obvious that most of the room lights are normal brightness, and my room is dim like **.
Later, a big sister came and said that we are replacing the lamps in batches, and you haven't changed them yet... Finally someone told the truth
When I was eating in a Chinese restaurant, there was no waiter to look after the door. I found a seat by myself. When ordering food, I found that several waiters were on duty on the first day, and they didn’t know the dishes when they asked.
The waiter at the hot spring is also on duty like the first day.
The parent-child park sign clearly stated the price of the package ticket and the separate ticket purchase. We wanted to buy one of them separately, but it was told that we could only buy the package ticket.
The entire hotel room facilities are outdated, the screens are broken, and the toilets and bathrooms are very outdated.
In short, because I visited the garden outside the hotel many years ago, I had some impressions of this place, so I booked this place for one night. After coming here, I found that this hotel only has the outside garden environment.
Not only is the hardware outdated, but the management of the service staff is not at all like a high-end hotel. The lobby manager has no quality and no sense of service. It feels that the hotel operators just want to take advantage of the festival to make a fortune, completely ignoring the experience of the guests. , Even if you don't need so many waiters, you should hire temporary workers a week in advance to familiarize yourself with the business. It is called a quasi-five-star hotel, so why don't you use a group of temporary workers to deal with it?
A hotel that has no sense of service, no service sincerity, and no concept of serving customers, and does not want to invest in a hotel that just wants to make money
The only thing worth affirming is that the hot springs and swimming pools are not bad. In the future, guests are advised to buy hot spring tickets separately to experience it. It is not necessary to stay in the hotel.

意外收穫，超出想象的一個愉快週末，除了五星級的設施，泳池、保齡、小童樂園網球等等設施超全，超大的湖面給人小世外桃源的感覺。孩子在小童樂園整整泡了兩個半天還沒耍夠，可見是一點不糊弄。每餐也是享受。值得一提的是服務到位，這點是我們這些帶孩子的父母最需要的。
吃住玩總體下來，比周邊高端民俗消費衹低不高。還要再來，冬天過來泡泡温泉。
請酒店記得我，期待下次服務一如既往。

辦完入住等到3點才給房卡，還是跟他們經理理論了一通才辦好的，白白等了一小時，什麼也沒玩，房費1500隻包含早餐，其他任何項目都單花錢，早餐也相當差勁，品種少，味道差，孩子衹吃了幾口炒飯，温泉環境一般，沒什麼景觀，就是一個一個池子，像個游泳館，免費水果看着可笑，不是壞的就是生的，當沒有好了，不適合家庭度假
