msg:I found that some places really can't believe all these bad reviews. I almost rejected Wuzhizhou Island and Coral Hotel forever because of the bad reviews!
I come to Sanya every year, and I have been to Xidao and Fenjiezhou, but I have never been to Wuzhizhou, because some people say it is not worth it, some say it is very commercial, some say the service of Coral Hotel is poor, and some say the hotel room hygiene is not good. So I have never been to Wuzhizhou.
This time there is really nowhere to go, so I want to go to Wuzhizhou to see if the reviews are true or false.
So we booked the Coral Hotel one day in advance. From the service hall before going to the island to the hotel lobby on the island, I received all kinds of respect, all kinds of high-quality services, and all kinds of quick island landing services, as well as room upgrades, as well as battery cars + city walks, and 1 semi-submersible sightseeing boat experience. I just want to ask those who say it's not worth it, and say that breakfast is not worth it, you can calculate the actual price, I'll give you a number, room fee 1100-two people's island ticket 133‚úñÔ∏è2-battery car citywalk 128‚úñÔ∏è2, and a semi-submarine sightseeing for one person, including two breakfasts, you can calculate the room fee of more than 1000. Is it expensive...
I suggest that those who want to come to Wuzhizhou with children can go! It is recommended to stay on the island! Very convenient! 
The service is also fine. When I entered the hotel, the lady made a balloon puppy for the children, and the children were very happy! 
The room facilities are indeed old, but very clean! Very decent! 
I suggest that you don't come with the mentality of the top luxury hotel in Haitang Bay. It is really not available here. You will definitely not be satisfied with this mentality. The mentality is very important. The service is sufficient and the hygiene is clean! I have no problem staying in such a disgusting hotel in Fenjiezhou, and I think the Wuzhizhou Coral Hotel is even better! 
Go everyone! Remind that there are basically no water activities for children under 7 years old! This includes speedboats and water supercars, none of them are allowed!

After the tourists dispersed, eating snacks and taking a walk on the beach, this experience is really incomparable to other bays in Sanya. The hotel staff are also very enthusiastic and responsive. If I have enough time next time I come to Sanya, I hope to stay here for two more days!

msg:This is my third time to Coral Hotel. The sea is very blue and the scenery is still beautiful, but the hotel is like an old man in his twilight years, and it feels worse and worse. It's just that I'm used to giving 5 points, so I won't deduct points. The first big problem is that on such a hot day, the air conditioner started to break down in the evening. It was full of heat! Hot! Hot! I thought it was late, so I endured it and went to sleep. Second, there was a broken light. Third, the button for flushing the toilet often didn't bounce after pressing it, resulting in a rush of water. Fourth, the switch of the wash basin was also about to break. Fifth, the room said it was 6***, but it obviously didn't feel like it. I hope these shortcomings mentioned can be faced and improved. There are still obvious advantages: the service attitude of the staff is still good, and the breakfast is also OK. That's it, it's still quite happy to live on the island.

Even if there is no pick-up, it takes only five minutes to walk there. The cheapest suite is also very large, with a small swimming pool. It's very comfortable to take a bath at night, and there is no need to worry about mosquitoes. It is equipped with electric mosquito coils and floral water. The air conditioner is very powerful, and it will be turned on when going out. I feel refreshed as soon as I return to the room.

msg:It is recommended to stay on the island for a day when you go to Wuzhizhou Island. It is really great. After 6:30 pm, basically only the guests on the entire island have exclusive access to the beach. The balcony of the sea view room I stayed in this time was very pleasant to see the whole sea. The hotel package includes a round-trip boat ticket for two people + a tram around the island + a semi-submersible sightseeing for one person. There are also discounts for diving on the island. It is really great. Due to physical reasons, I did not go diving. I must come to the island to dive again next time. The hotel was built in 20218. Although the decoration style is not so new, the room is very large and there is an independent small bubble pool where you can play in the water. It is very nice and nice to take pictures. There are also a lot of food for breakfast, and the taste is good. The service is also very good and very enthusiastic!

Wash away all the fatigue! The beach on the island is clean and the sea water is clear. The only drawback is that the food is expensive and the taste is not very good üëçüèª If I have to choose, I will still live on the island next time. But it is recommended that there are fewer people in the off-season.

Only the children's pool was left. The children's pool was up to my waist and I couldn't swim, so I could only soak in the water. The hotel's shuttle service is very good. You can pick up when you land on the island, and it is also very convenient to go directly to Yalong Bay after leaving the island. I like the driver Chen Yonghai. The service is thoughtful and meticulous! The semi-submersible fish watching provided by the hotel is quite nice, more casual, not an extreme sport, you can bring your mobile phone to take pictures, there are few people and no time limit, you can watch the fish on the boat for as long as you want, and when the weather is good, it is completely a jelly sea~~

The hotel has an exclusive passage with clear signs and guidance, which greatly facilitates tourists to go to the island without queuing.
The hotel has sufficient shuttle buses for arrival and departure. I praise the staff who drive the shuttle buses. Each of them is enthusiastic and very proactive in helping to carry luggage.
The breakfast is good and the restaurant has a beautiful view of the sea. The room is large, the bathroom is well designed, and the hot spring pool on the balcony is the finishing touch.

The most important thing is that the price of about one thousand includes a double boat ticket and a double sightseeing bus ticket.
It costs five or six hundred to buy two tickets alone. The Coral Hotel is really worth it.
Anyway, I will come again in the future!

msg:The only attraction of the hotel is its geographical location. As the only hotel on the island, it allows guests to experience the quiet island environment and the rare tranquility when there are not many tourists in the morning of the next day. The hotel facilities are old and poorly maintained. Fortunately, the room type we stayed in this time has a private swimming pool, so the children can have fun without leaving the house. However, the hotel has a single dining option and the price is not cheap, about 200 per person. The hotel provides electric cars for convenient travel, and the waiters at the door of the hotel are also very nice.

If you want to enjoy the tranquility of the island, you can choose it, but don't compare it with the popular hotels in Sanya Bay and Haitang Bay.

Maybe due to the lack of competition, some service staff lack service awareness, often have no patience to answer questions, and even get splashed with water by the cleaning staff when going to the public toilet. I guess they want to finish cleaning early and go off work. The waiting time for diving and other projects is long, and they cannot inform customers of the relatively accurate waiting time. In order to attract customers, they don't care much about the user experience, resulting in waiting time far exceeding expectations.

If you miss breakfast, you can exchange it for lunch. It is too friendly to sleep in. Dinner is a little expensive, but it is acceptable. After the tourists leave the island, there are only guests staying on the island, and they have the entire island to themselves. The holiday feeling is directly full. It is highly recommended to stay on the island for one night

Then you can't finish playing in Wuzhizhou Island in one day. If you bring children, I really recommend staying for one night. When it is very hot at noon on the day of the trip, you can take a nap and then get up to play, which is much more relaxing. The hotel is about 1,000 per night. Excluding the double ticket, boat ticket, and battery car ticket, it is about 600, which is only 500 per night. This quality hotel is really not expensive. Oh, by the way, it was my husband's birthday that day, and the hotel also sent a cake to our room, which was very warm and considerate. I will stay here next time!

Breakfast:

Service:
I feel the service of a five-star hotel is very average. The staff is like a machine without any emotion, just completing the task!

In general, it is a very average hotel I stayed in during my Hainan Island Tour. The service made me feel that I didn't live in a five-star hotel. It may have something to do with the management. The room is good, more than 100 square meters, very clean, and the breakfast is also OK! I still recommend staying overnight when you come to Wuzhizhou! You can watch the sunrise in the morning. The hotel will send a car, but it is charged.

msg:Overall it's OK, the room is relatively large, and I like the cleanliness of the room. But I don't recommend booking a sea view room, because the coconut trees in front block the view. I wanted a slightly higher room, but they said I would be arranged on the fourth floor, but it was actually on the first floor. The banana trees planted by the corridor may have used farmyard manure, and the odor was strong. Lunch and dinner can only be eaten in the hotel, the quality is OK, and the price is a bit expensive. It's good to have a small hot spring on the balcony.

msg:I have nothing to say about the hotel, it‚Äôs great! Wuzhizhou Island is unique, the health facilities and services are very good, the porters are attentiveüëç, the breakfast is rich, the waiters are kind and attentive, and the Chinese restaurant dishes are also quite good. After staying in the hotel, I visited the scenic spots during the day and night. Night tours are especially recommended, as they are quiet and comfortable, and some scenic spots are more beautiful at night. The only thing that was not ideal was that I felt uncomfortable when leaving the island. Although there was no need to queue, there was no one to help carry the luggage. It was not very convenient for guests with heavy luggage, and getting on the boat was a bit messy.

msg:The hotel service is very good. I checked in at the pier in advance. After arriving at the hotel, I got my room card and someone will guide me to my room. The room is large, quiet and comfortable, and is very considerate to children. There are many sizes in the swimming pool. Life buoys, baby life jackets, balls and water guns allow parents to safely let their children play freely. The best thing is that the hotel provides round-trip shuttle services to many other hotels, which saves us the trouble of taking a taxi. When we left the hotel, the shuttle driver Master Chen Yonghai saw that we had brought children and strollers, and immediately asked us to take the children first. When we got on the bus, Master Chen helped us put our luggage and other items in the car. Master Chen also patiently explained the problem to the children. When we arrived at the destination, Master Chen Yonghai helped us move all the luggage out of the car. Master Chen's considerate service made us happy. We are very touched and would like to express our gratitude to him! I will come again if I have the opportunity in the future.

msg:I took my children to play on the island. The overall facilities of the hotel are a bit old. The hardware facilities in the room are not as good as expected. I complained about the breakfast bar. It was too ordinary and not rich. There was nothing to eat. The foreign chef did not have any sense of service. The foreigner took a Big cup, he actually asked me to wait for him to finish picking up the coffee. He clearly saw me there and pressed the coffee machine three times at once. It was really annoyingüò°. This place is fine if you come here for surfing, but in fact, it is not recommended for bringing children.

Facilities: a bit old
Hygiene: Hygiene is very good
Environment: OK
Service: Let me comment here on the slightly older uncle who brings the alpacas at the door. The service is very enthusiastic and the person is very nice. He takes the initiative to say hello and asks the guests how to take photos with the alpacas. Like it and give it 3 stars for the sake of the uncle. Star, the door-to-door service when the concierge arrived was mediocre, and he asked me to get things by myself. I didn‚Äôt know what to ask and had no proactive service attitude.

It's not as well managed as the beaches in the mainland. There aren't many activities after six o'clock. The food is just average. The scenery is pretty good.

msg:When I booked a hotel before, I read a lot of reviews and found mixed reviews. Personally, I think the price points are different and the experience is different.
The Coral Hotel has 4 buildings, as well as seaside cabins and villas. So it's hard to generalize. It was renovated in 2018. If you want the whole house to be smart, it is not available. The deluxe rooms are semi-smart. I personally feel that the decoration style is grand and does not feel outdated. The service is also very enthusiastic. It‚Äôs better to choose based on your personal purpose of living on the island.

However, the air conditioner broke down the next day and was not repaired until we checked out. It was originally a perfect score, but two points were deducted here.

msg:Needless to say, the location of the hotel is the only five-star hotel on Wuzhizhou Island. There are battery cars to and from the pier to pick up and drop off guests free of charge. You can also take the express lane when taking the boat, so you don't have to wait in line like ordinary tourists. The hotel's service is also very good. The customer service staff are very enthusiastic. There are many sofas, tables and chairs in the hotel lobby, where you can rest for free, which is very user-friendly. The breakfast is also very rich, with many varieties, good taste and many choices. The room is very spacious, clean, tidy, and well-equipped. There is also a bathing pool. During the day, I caught a cold while wearing wet clothes while diving in the sea breeze. It is good to take a bath at night to sweat out. Another point is that when you live on the island, you don‚Äôt have to rush to catch the boat. You can play late at night and early in the morning, and there are very few people. In addition, the hotel's park has beautiful scenery, with many peacocks and pigeons roaming freely. There will also be two cute alpacas at the hotel entrance for guests to take photos at noon. Go out to enjoy marine activities and buy tickets from the hotel for more favorable prices. The overall feeling is very good. I will stay here next time.

This trip was just to participate in the coral protection camp, but the weather was too cold and I couldn‚Äôt go into the water, which was a pity.
The refrigerator is heating but not cooling, and it is full of hot drinks. Although the TV is a smart TV, many VIP items cannot be purchased, and you cannot log in to your own app account. Bad review.
The self-service vending machines on the island are cheaper than hotels. If necessary, please go out and buy discounts.
The boat going up and down the island is particularly dizzy, so be sure to take medicine and rest.
The island is divided into a white route and a red route. The white route can be reached on foot, while the red route can only be reached by battery car. Unfortunately, the weather was bad and the sun was not seen.
The shuttle bus pick-up service has a fixed time. If you can't make it, you can only take a taxi yourself.
Here is a special reminder that duty-free shops can only get membership points after registration. Anyway, I only went to CDF, and no one reminded me to register as a member. Moreover, CDF has the worst service, the most expensive price, and the most chaotic management among all duty-free shops.

The air from the air conditioner is absolutely stinky, and when it is turned on, it makes so much noise that I can't even sleep. The service in the catering depar**ent was so poor. During dinner in the restaurant in the evening, the dishes were being cleared with clinking noises. Less than half of the occupancy rate said that they needed to wait for a seat. Later, after waiting for a long time, they asked again and said that there was always a seat. It was a waste of time! There is a serious mismatch between price and service! After getting breakfast, are you going to go down the steps to eat for fear that the guests will not fall down? The layout is too unreasonable. Breakfast is only available until ten o'clock, and the bread is not freshly made, so don't order it!

msg:I was more than satisfied with my stay at the hotel this time. Any worries I had due to reading reviews before booking were ignored. From the reception desk at the pier to the hotel lobby, all the staff were patient and helpful. If you have any questions, just ask.
Three adults, including two elderly people, experienced a parent-child room. The layout of the parent-child room is designed for families with young children. The room is spacious and bright, the facilities are very new, the decorations on the walls are full of childishness, and I also saw a signature of a child as a souvenir (although the behavior is inappropriate, it means that the children like this place) The elderly have limited mobility. If they don't want to walk, they can sit on the bed or balcony to enjoy the sunshine, beach, sea breeze, waves, and watch tourists happily taking photos coming and going. The hotel environment is very ecological, with white pigeons often fluttering past the high dome lobby, and a green peacock strolling leisurely in the hotel park. However, during my one-night stay, I was not troubled by mosquitoes or ants throughout the stay.
Hotel guests can drive their cars all the way to the pier and park there; the room rate includes the ferry ticket and can take the fast track; after arriving on the island, a battery car will pick up the guests to the hotel lobby at any time. The waiter helped carry our luggage and took us to the room. Maybe he saw that we had brought water, so he specifically informed us that bottled water was refilled for free. On the night of check-in, I also received a call from the hotel to inquire about my needs. There are no entertainment options for the elderly. They only bought sightseeing projects around the island without getting off the bus. It seems that it would be cheaper to buy tickets at the hotel. The only slight drawback was that the sightseeing bus drove too fast, but the two elders were still very satisfied and kept saying that the girl driving the car was good at driving.

Even the Hainanese who were accompanying me said it brought back a lot of childhood memories. The room can see a little bit of the sea, and there is a bathtub on the terrace for taking a bath, which is quite pleasant after a day of fun. The hotel's buffet is also good. I'll try it with the elderly next time. There is nothing to say about the beach, and the projects are OK.

When I wanted to delay check-out until 2 o'clock, I was told that it would cost 300 yuan an hour. When checking out, it took about five minutes to walk from the room to the lobby (the arranged room was very far away, with elderly people and children). When I was approaching the lobby, I received a call from the front desk urging me to check out. It was really amazing. Even though the room is not fully occupied, yet the guests are being urged like this. Maybe they don‚Äôt want to do this business a second time. The most ridiculous thing is that before leaving the store, he asked for a five-point review and said he would send a doll to the children. He really advised the store that instead of trying to bribe the children, it is better to think about how to improve the service. This 3,000 yuan was spent very unpleasantly, and I will not stay there again. One day is enough to visit Wuzhizhou Island, so please consider staying in a hotel carefully.

This time I decisively chose to stay on the island. There is a sightseeing car pick-up and pick-up service in and out. There will be discounts for staying in hotels and playing water sports. I chose a private pool room and a bathing pool. The children had a great time and didn't want to come out after soaking in the water all day. The scenery on the island is very charming. When there are few people, get up early to enjoy the beautiful scenery, and feel that the island is your own. The only downside is that the hotel has been built for a long time, the floor tiles are worn out, and the facilities are insufficient. There is no refrigerator and washing machine. Fortunately, the cafeteria is relatively large and there are many types of breakfast. There is no charge for children under 1.2 meters, half price for children between 1.2 and 1.5 meters 78 Yuan, if you want to take more photos for nostalgia, it is recommended to stay.

Of course, if you have money, you can also go to the buffet dinner. In the swimming pool, 258 per person seems very rich, but I think it is still a bit expensive. There is only a beach on the island where you can swim. It is not far from the hotel. The sea water on the island is very clear. It is recommended to experience it, but the water in the bath is full of stones and shells. . But the water is really clean and you can see the bottom. Sea sports are routine, depending on personal preferences, they are all exciting. It is still necessary to go around the island of Wuzhizhou Island. It is okay to come and have a look, but the price of more than 160 is really too expensive. If you finish the whole run, you can take a battery car for less than half an hour.

msg:Beautiful Wuzhizhou Island, beautiful Sanya! The hotel is very good. There is a small swimming pool in the room type, so you can enjoy your own private space. There is also a large swimming pool for children to play together. The scenery at night is beautiful, and the island is very quiet. I took the children to touch fish and catch crabs, and accidentally found a big octopus. Of course, after taking pictures, I sent him back to the sea. You can stay in the hotel for free, and you can go to the island as a VIP. In the morning, you can take the first batch of small train sightseeing, which is a very cost-effective trip!

msg:There is no hotel service level, it belongs to the level of a guest house, and the price/performance ratio is low. You have to wait in line for the hotel restaurant, and there is no delivery service for Chinese food. The only food that can be delivered to the room is French fries (soft), fried chicken nuggets (in the buffet breakfast There are), ramen (noodles have a bad taste), squid fried noodles (only a small piece of squid tendrils can be seen after looking for a long time, which is huge). The sanitation is very poor, and the attitude of the service staff is also very bad, as if they have not been paid, and the tone of talking to customers is very similar to that of a dormitory administrator, not a hotel professional service staff. There is no clear price tag on the self-service vending machines on the island. The commercial development is over-developed, and the security guards will drive tourists away from the water. The ridiculous thing is that they still talk about life safety, even the sea water up to the ankles. Take the tram (138 per person) It‚Äôs OK to go to the designated beach. In fact, it‚Äôs a disguised form that forces tourists not to go to the sea and enjoy the sea for free. The area that can be walked on foot is ridiculously small, and the remaining area is enclosed and you can only spend money to take a tram. People are staggering, and the beach is full of garbage and cigarette butts. It is more meaningful for security to pick up garbage and maintain the beach environment. I do not recommend coming to this island and this hotel at all. Fortunately, the typhoon saved me. I checked out of the outlying island one day in advance.

The view of the hotel is beautiful, the swimming pool is clean, the swimming rings are provided for free, and the breakfast is rich. Although the hotel is on the first floor, the sound insulation is very good! It‚Äôs just that the housing prices on the island are really expensive. At this price, you can live in a five-star hotel outside the island. In fact, you can live outside the island, go to the island in the morning to play, and go back in the afternoon.
The hotel's service is really good. When we went out for a walk at night, the hotel's battery car brother saw us, stopped and asked us if we wanted to go back to the hotel. Thanks to the hotel concierge Zheng Xiaowang, brother, for helping to book the hotel shuttle bus. The service attitude is very good, and he also took us to the bus. Give him a thumbs up [Âº∫]

advantage:
You can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the whole island after the tourists on the island leave;
The big round bathtub, children like it very much;
The Hainan noodles stall for breakfast is very good, with fresh clam meat, shrimp, conch slices, shredded pork, pork liver, and the taste is great;
The staff at the concierge are very nice, and they drove me back several times when I went out;
shortcoming:
Very affected by the weather, the heavy rain the next day was a bit boring, and I didn't see the sunrise;
The food and beverage prices are on the high side. After all, the transportation of materials is inconvenient and there are not many choices.
As a digression, staying here is still very pleasant. I lived in the wooden house in the center of the island 12 years ago. This time I brought my children here to revisit it. Unfortunately, the weather is not beautiful.

msg:I read the reviews before saying that the food in the hotel is not good, so I have been hesitating whether to live on the island. I still have the right to speak after my own experience. Environment: The peripheral environment is good. After all, on the island, there are swimming pools, seas, rainforests, and many small animals, such as peacocks, pigeons, alpacas... the natural environment is good. The internal environment of the hotel is relatively old, the bed is relatively small, and there is basically no butler service, but it can still be lived. Personally, the taste of the rice is not bad. Although there are not many varieties in the morning buffet, Wanning rice noodles are delicious, and the small bread is also good. There is a self-service barbecue at night, which is okay. It is not as bad as it is said, and the price is acceptable. Grilled squid, boiled shrimp, and small seafood are all good, and the mango is delicious.
Disadvantages: For the guests who live on the island, there is no special advantage in playing and swimming in the sea, so they cannot start in advance. Especially for swimming in the sea, you have to wait for the lifeguards to go to the island before going into the sea. It would be nice to have a bigger edge in this regard.

msg:What I regret about my third stay is that the crystal clear sea water and small fish in my memory have all disappeared. The sea water has become turbid. Due to weather conditions, the island closes stalls early at 5 o'clock. The children's playground is open until 5:30 and the indoor swimming pool is open. No, I didn‚Äôt have any entertainment except eating at night. When I was going to sleep, I found that the lights in the room I checked in couldn‚Äôt be turned off. After checking, the waiter said it was broken and asked if I could report it for repair? ? ? I called the front desk, and the front desk said he knew and sent someone to fix it. Me? ? ? ? Am I here to apply for repairs? Shouldn't we take the initiative to offer solutions and quickly change rooms? I'm waiting for you to fix the lights at night. The service attitude needs to be improved. Personally, I don‚Äôt think the sea water will recover for a long time.

msg:The room attendant was still very clean. The room attendant was very kind when she saw that we had children, so she immediately sent several bottles of mineral water for us to make milk powder for the children. She could still bring them if it was not enough. She also enthusiastically helped us turn on the TV and the balcony on the balcony. The bathing pool allows children to play in the water. It is best to put a trash can under the sink so that if there is a bit of garbage, don‚Äôt run to the trash can in the hall. The swimming pool for children in the hotel is relatively good. There is a young lady who is looking after it. Both water guns and water guns are provided. The children had fun. The reasonable meal in the set meal is delicious and the amount is relatively large. The set meal for two at the island bar at noon the next day is so-so. The dining environment is not very good. There is a woman at the front desk of the hotel I discussed it with her because the lunch in the package is not in the hotel. I need the battery car at the entrance of the hotel to send it out to the pirate bar for dinner. Can you delay my check-out until one o‚Äôclock? There is an additional 300 yuan for check-out, and I am speechless. It is the off-season and the occupancy rate of the hotel is not high. I hope the hotel leaders will think carefully about refusing even such a small request from the guests, which may be sorry for the service of the five-star hotel.

msg:Let‚Äôs start from the entrance. When you get on the island, there is a battery car to pick you up to the hotel. The battery car can go to many places. It‚Äôs really convenient to bring your baby. The lobby has a high ceiling, which looks good, and the check-in at the front desk is also very fast. , There are ice-cold drinks to drink while waiting. The room is big and clean. It doesn't feel old. It looks pretty good. The air conditioner is very powerful. The hotel's dinner buffet is also delicious. There are many, and it‚Äôs a paradise for meat lovers. My son and I showed off a lot of roast lamb. It‚Äôs even better to go for a stroll on Wuzhizhou Island at night. There are not many people in the sun. You can just lie on the beach chairs and so on. The hotel even made a return visit Called and asked how our stay was. I mentioned that I accidentally fell down in the room, and immediately said that I would give us a fruit plate to express my apology. In fact, I was not careful, and my attitude is very good. Compared with the future stay The holidays in Sanya Bay are not a little bit good. Moreover, there are special discounts for staying in the hotel to buy water sports, which is very suitable. My son bought the water trapeze and dared not play, and he was very happy to refund it. I feel that Wuzhizhou Island is a very mature scenic spot from the project to the hotel. It is very service-minded and highly praised. I will go there in the future.

msg:The room is very big, the price is still a bit expensive, 1450 yuan a night, but after experiencing it, it feels worth the price, and it is very worth it!
It was already 16:50 when we drove to the ecological parking lot. Ctrip called to remind us why we hadn‚Äôt gone to the island yet. The boat to the island seemed to end at 17:30, so we couldn‚Äôt go to the island. Okay. In the last half hour, we caught the boat on the island.
First of all, the front desk of Coral Hotel is not on the island, but in Wuzhizhou Wharf. The front desk check-in ID card seems to be, and the room card is collected at the front desk on Wuzhizhou Island.
The ferry ticket for going up and down the island is included in the hotel fee, because it is more than 17:00 in the afternoon. Tourists who do not live on the island have basically left the island. Next is Wuzhizhou Island with few people. Experience Very cool.
After going to the island, there is a coral hotel reception point at the pier, where you can have a sightseeing car to pick you up and drop you off to the hotel, and help with luggage, which is more considerate.
Go to the front desk on the island, check in and get the room card. We live in a 180-degree sea view room, which is in Building 2, which is not in the same building as the lobby. The waiter helped to carry the luggage to the room, which was said to be on the 7th floor. It is actually the 2nd floor, but after arriving at the room, there are indeed many floors below. It should be our separate elevator here, which is not shared with the floors below.
After entering the room, the room is really facing the sea, but it is facing a strait of Haitang Bay. There is no such endless sea, but it is also very good. The 180-degree room is a little more expensive, but the view is really good.
Then there is a big balcony outside, and a small swimming pool or a bathtub on the balcony is fine, but it is definitely much more comfortable to use than a bathtub.
When I went to the island, I was in a hurry, so I didn‚Äôt have dinner. Later, it was too late for the video conference, so I called the ordering phone in the room and ordered the hotel‚Äôs takeaway. A fried noodle was 78 yuan, and a fried rice was 78 yuan. The total is 156 yuan. The food delivery boy brings the POS machine to the door and then collects the payment. The meal size is quite large, and the taste is just average. Anyway, with one serving, one person must be full
On the second day, I went to the reception hall around 5:15 in the morning. First, I spent 50 yuan a person to take a sightseeing bus to see the sunrise, but the clouds were too thick that day, and I didn‚Äôt see the sunrise.
After returning to the hotel, I opened the curtains and found that a peacock flew onto the balcony railing of the room. This was really a surprise. This was the biggest surprise of my stay at the Coral Hotel.
Then we went to eat the buffet on the island. I have eaten in the hotel‚Äôs cafeteria before. The taste is quite satisfactory. The main reason is that the layout is very distinctive and the categories are also very rich. Compared with other luxury hotels, it still has a lot of different feelings.
Finally, after checking out, you can store your luggage at the front desk on the island. There is a special luggage room. After you store it, you can continue to play around on the island.
After playing and shopping, you can go to pick up your luggage, and then there is a sightseeing car at the front desk to take people and luggage to the pier, and then board the boat and leave the island
Generally speaking, it is still a hotel worth recommending, Wuzhizhou Island Coral Hotel. If I go to Wuzhizhou again next time, I will continue to stay there.

The air and greenery on the island are very good, and the night is very quiet. Compared with the hotels in Haitang Bay, the breakfast is not as good. There are not many varieties. The conditions may be limited, but the overall is good

msg:The sewer in the bathtub may not be water-sealed, and the room smells like sewers, so you need to do the water-sealing manually~ Other than that, there is nothing wrong with the hotel, but I want to complain about the so-called life of an island owner! !
It is strongly recommended that all comrades who stay in the hotel settle their dinner before 6 o'clock. At this time, there are various rice bowls and noodles to eat, and the price ranges from 38 to 75. If it‚Äôs after 6 o‚Äôclock, the cheapest is the seaside barbecue, which costs 9 yuan for a beef skewer; in addition, there is also a barbecue by the hotel pool, 228/person, huh, huh, roughly equivalent to 99/person in ************** Level; if you don‚Äôt want to eat barbecue, you can only choose the Chinese restaurant on the 4th floor of the hotel. This restaurant basically has nothing to eat for dinner.
Although the lighting on the island is good, it is really unpleasant to rip people off for food and drink. In addition, the pier parking lot does not allow tourists to park, but reserves it for the staff, which fully reflects the true status of the island. There are two places for tourists to park. The nearest one is the "ecological parking lot". However, no one has informed them and there is no obvious sign at the entrance of the parking lot to indicate that this is the best parking lot for tourists. The circle can return to the entrance again, plus the traffic jam, hehe~ If you unfortunately park in a parking lot a little further away, you need to walk 300 meters staring at the sun, hehe~
Finally, let‚Äôs post a few photos. The scenery is really good. There are not too many people. You can wander around leisurely. This is probably the only advantage of being an island owner.

It is very quiet after a day trip to the island. It is very comfortable to walk on the beach to see the night view and step on the sea.
The hotel's barbecue buffet 228/person is super bad. There are only squid, shrimp, and octopus. The name is not worthy of the name. It is not recommended to eat. Food and drink on the island are more expensive, so if you mind, bring some food with you.
If you want to play water sports, you must buy them in the hotel business center. It is cheaper than all online prices. Go there at 9:00 a.m., do sun protection, and play parasols and motorboats first, otherwise there will be a huge queue at noon! ! !
Finally, be sure to check the weather in advance. The sea is not so beautiful when the weather is bad.

The sea is clear, the beach is soft, and the reefs are full of marine life such as small conchs. It is a good place for children to hunt for treasures. Corals and shells washed ashore by waves can be seen everywhere. This kind of scenery is probably better than other seasides in China. Hard to see. Our family came after May 1st. It is really correct to travel on a staggered peak. There are not so many tourists.

msg:Very disappointed with a hotel booking, no more than one night stay here! The 4 points for the environment are for Wuzhizhou Island. The sea water is really clear and the sand is very white, but the Coral Hotel is really a waste of such a good resource. The hotel is outdated. It‚Äôs hard to believe that it was opened in 2018 in the previous booking introduction. The shower head was rotten when I first entered the room, and it was replaced later. There is no privacy in the shower room. Even if you live with a family, it will be embarrassing , The curtains are not tight, if you meet someone with a heart, you can really see it from the outside. The attitude of the cleaning aunt is also average. Cleaning may be just a change of towels. After staying for two nights, she didn't even change the floor towels that were dirty. There are few varieties in the restaurant. When the waiter clears the table, he just wipes it with a paper towel. When he reminded him to wipe the oily table again, the waiter said that it has been wiped. It is said that it is a so-called five-star hotel. There are so many hotels in Sanya. This one is not up to the level of facilities and personnel service. At most, it just monopolizes the advantage of Wuzhizhou Island. All entertainment items on the island are charged, and the cost is not low. After the flight stops at 6 pm, there will be no food and beverages on the island. You can only eat in the unpalatable restaurants in the hotel. Only those who have been there will know that Wuzhizhou Island is indeed beautiful, but it is not worth living in.

The hotel pick-up and drop-off service is quite good, Wang Qijie seems to be called this, the service is good, and the pick-up and drop-off is considerate. It's not because I don't have money, I will stay in it for another two nights! But don't just try the hotel's night buffet, there are few things in the barbecue area, and it's slow! The price is not cheap! The price/performance ratio is not high. But the hotel is good!

Bathing Beach - Lover's Bridge - Private custom walk. On the second day, the hotel bought a round-the-island tour ticket (hotel guests have discounts), stored the luggage and went around the island. Ocean Star, Sun Watching Rock... The route design of this round-the-island tour is the peak, and there will be no better ones in the future. I can't understand this kind of visually degraded design.
I booked a sea view room, which I understand is unnecessary. Anyway, I can't see anything, so there is a needless increase of 200 yuan. It was noon when I got off the island, and I saw the crowd on the opposite boat going to the island, oops, it was too hot and crowded. It's nice to stay one night on the island.

In terms of play, you can buy water sports at the hotel, which is cheaper than Ctrip Hornets, and there are preferential prices for hotel guests.
In terms of accommodation, I chose an elegant suite with a full sea view, with two sides facing the sea, a living room outside to rest, and accommodation inside, which is the same as the hotel picture, and the original picture is used directly here.
In terms of food, you can bring some food before going to the island, because there is less food at night. You can also choose the hotel's own buffet and Chinese restaurant.
In terms of itinerary, check in at noon and afternoon the day before, and then you can go to the beach for a stroll and rest. The next morning, go directly to the queue to play. If there is a diving arrangement, it is almost enough to play three other items.

msg:This hotel, in fact, really has nothing to say, why?
Let‚Äôs first understand the situation of this hotel: the only hotel in Wuzhizhou Island, the most heart-shaped island in Sanya, you are the most beautiful boy with a green bracelet (hotel identification)‚Ä¶
First of all, there is a separate VIP passage on the island, skipping the line to go to the island, and then the shuttle bus will take you directly to the hotel lobby after arrival...
Secondly, the hotel has an independent business depar**ent to order entertainment activities on the island. It can be said that the price of the project package you see on any website is more expensive than the hotel, and the hotel has the lowest price on the whole island...
Finally, all tourists have to leave the island at 5:30, so from 6:00 to 9:00 the next day, hotel guests occupy the entire Wuzhizhou Island. Do you understand the private beach? üòÇ
So the hotel itself is not important anymore, believe me, if you come to Wuzhizhou Island and book this hotel with your eyes closed, you will not regret it.

You can see the wonderful invincible sea view. I especially like the hot spring bath on the balcony and the seaside. The barbecue buffet and draft beer are especially like the leisurely walk on the coastline and see the peacocks taking a leisurely walk. The pick-up service is very good and I will come here for vacation if I have the opportunity

msg:Very disappointing hotel with no service to speak of. The only thing I was satisfied with was that the hotel arranged buses to take guests to hotels in Haitang Bay or Yalong Bay. Brother Chen Yiqun saw the child sleeping and helped push the luggage to the bus. The bus driver was also very service-minded. For the buffet dinner purchased at the hotel, the waiter for the grilled chicken wings ignored the children queuing up to get the meal and gave all the grilled food to the people who jumped in line, which encouraged the trend of queue jumping. He completely ignored the children who had been working hard and queued up normally to get the meal and ignored them. Manage children. It is impossible for a hotel with bad views to provide good service. After staying in so many hotels, Coral Hotel cannot meet the star standards from hardware to software.

For a family of three, living on the island is the best choice, because in addition to the island fee and boat tickets are free, you can also enjoy the hotel's special channel to board the boat and island. Thinking about it, the price/performance ratio is still very high! The public area of the hotel has a beautiful environment, and the coral-themed island is full of style. Hotel service is very good! I stayed for two consecutive days, and after breakfast the next day, I returned to the room and found that it had been tidied up, with great attention to detail and high efficiency! Praise! There are many swimming pools, the water quality is good, and the safety facilities are in place. Praise! The western restaurant is very big, and the breakfast is good. The 398 set meal in the Chinese restaurant is amazing, delicious and unforgettable. Praise! The barbecue bar by the pool, 258 people for self-service, is generally okay, a little expensive, but it is really pleasant to eat outdoors at night. The Internet celebrity island is full of people during the day, and there are many beach activities. It is indeed a bit noisy, but it is quite quiet at night. After 5:30, there is no place to eat except on the hotel island. The scenery on the island is really good, and it is still very worthwhile to walk around. The sea water quality of the beach is basically invincible in China, and this is a blessed place for those who like diving. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the room, which is very large, and I like the design of the pool and bathroom very much. The bed is comfortable, and some small things in the room are also very practical. The floor-to-ceiling windows are still old-fashioned, and the glass is also dirty, which affects the landscape a bit. Overall, it is very good, and it is recommended to stay for two nights or more.

If my reservation was late, would I sleep on the street and be unable to walk... The restaurant is also like a war, with long queues and mediocre taste. There is no wine at all in the bar, and there is nothing to order, and I need to teach how to mix the wine... The Chinese restaurant is not delicious, and it is also expensive.
I will never go there again, there are so many people. What about the oriental Maldives...not necessarily! You can only walk halfway along the coast, and you must take a 60-seat bus to get to the rest, which is the rocky sea. nothing special.

msg:In short, when I went to Wuzhizhou Island, I had to go to this hotel, and he was the only one. Therefore, the price environment was monopolized, and the attitude of the service desk was okay. I was not satisfied with the outdated facilities and catering. Catering this tiger crab, I ate 3 and had diarrhea for three days. This has greatly affected my overall opinion of him. In addition, when I checked in, I arranged for the air leakage in the room that day. They had a very good attitude and took me to 3 rooms. In the end, the more enthusiastic front desk was reluctant at first haha. After all, it's 11 o'clock. As for the sea view in the room, the explanation is that you can see 5-10%, but I want a sea view, well, I still don‚Äôt have enough money, and I can‚Äôt add money! There are no rooms left. This is the main logic of this hotel. Let me talk about the must-see places, island tour (both ordinary and luxury have to queue, 10 am and 4:30 pm, the least people, luxury means you can go to 6 places, it is rubbish, there is no need to take pictures! Choose ordinary Just go), boarding the island (there are few people at 9 am and 5 pm, you come in the middle? Try it, you can‚Äôt park), parking (the eco-parking area A is the closest, I suggest you bring less things, the road from east to west has not been repaired , stopping you to buy things along the way, surfing, too many things to walk), what else is there to do on the island? water. I can't play with the elderly and children, so, I took a photo. Catch the sea? Don't even think about it, go to Rongcheng, Weihai, Shandong in July, go to Tanmen Town in May, and go to Dadonghai at most in these two days from February to March, and add an unmanned classic ~ Hainan Dahuajiao. If you don‚Äôt have diarrhea, this trip will cost 90 points. This seafood is all you can do. Come and play, eat less of the seafood buffet here, and leave your stomach in Houhai Village!

The hotel is also good, the room is very spacious, the birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant. The little brother in the front office picked us up when we left the island.

Hygiene: The room and swimming pool are good, the breakfast room is too crowded
Environment: There are many green plants and the environment is good. The beach restaurant bbq has all the tourists gone at night, only the hotel is left. There is no one on the street. It is very quiet. It feels good to eat while facing the sea.
Service: The service staff in the bbq restaurant is very good, the Chinese restaurant is average, the guy on the shuttle bus in the lobby is also average, and the other staff are pretty good
Breakfast: OK, quite satisfactory, but there are still too many people
Wuzhizhou Island round-trip VIP channel: very fast and very good experience

The project chose to pack a yacht to go out to sea for 2 hours. There is a hotel discount. I caught two Samui and one grouper. I was really lucky.
Summary: If you come to Wuzhizhou and can‚Äôt live there, you may not be able to enjoy yourself completely, because there are too many people on the island during the day, and the projects have to be lined up during the day. It‚Äôs too noisy. You must stay for one night to experience the quiet island at night.
Remarks: It is said that the white sand pulled from Maldives is really good

It is cleaner to visit the island after breakfast in the morning. When it is near noon, the tourists on the island are in a mess.
As someone who comes from a coastal city in the north, the sea is indeed better, and the sand is finer and whiter.

msg:It's completely a fraud. Everyone should be careful about this hotel. I originally booked a two-bedroom suite with garden view for my children. Ctrip customer service called me and said I would upgrade it to a duplex family suite for free. At first, I was worried about the increase in price, so I asked Ctrip customer service to report it to the hotel. After confirming whether the room type is really better than the room type I originally booked, the answer given to me is that the room type is truly upgraded. As a result, when I arrived at the hotel to check in, I discovered that the duplex I was upgraded to was in a ba*****t with a pile of garbage outside the window. After I said no, they took me to see two other sets. One set did not have two double beds at all. An extra bed is needed; the other room is completely worse. I would like to ask how such a big hotel can deceive guests in such a way and even claim it is an upgrade. How can it be so embarrassing to say it out loud? I really regret that I didn‚Äôt take photos to provide evidence. Although I was later transferred back to the original room type, I followed him three or four times from arriving at the hotel to before and after check-in, which delayed me for nearly an hour. I was on vacation, and I ended up in a bad mood. Also, be sure not to book a duplex or two-bedroom with a garden view, but book a room for parents and children! Family room!

msg:My wife and I came to Wuzhizhou Island in 2010, and this time we revisited the old place with our children. The island is still the same island, there are places that get better, and there are places that don‚Äôt! Let me talk about the good places first. Wuzhizhou Island is not very big. One side is a beach, and the other is a seaside reef. The vegetation is lush, the scenery is beautiful and steep, and the characteristics are obvious. After 2010, a coral hotel was built. The living and entertainment facilities on the island are currently relatively complete! As a neutral place, because it is an island, the cost of water entertainment activities, accommodation and food on the island is relatively expensive, especially during the peak tourist season of the Spring Festival, the accommodation in the Coral Hotel will cost about 2,000 more than the usual price. Of course, the Coral Hotel is still good , The room is large, the environment is good, the facilities are perfect, clean and hygienic, living on the island, you can also avoid the flow of people and fully play. The downside is that we can no longer walk around the island on foot. We walked around the island in 2010, and it felt pretty good. This time, we want to take our children around the island on foot. When we reach the starting point of the walk around the island, there are already security guards, saying that they are no longer allowed. I have been walking around the island for several years. I have said some reasons, such as safety reasons, that I can only go around the island with battery cars. The walking is mainly concentrated on the side of the beach (there are also some reef landscapes at the very edge), but I guess the most important thing is to promote battery car tours. I 2010 When walking around the island every year, in the closed part, pedestrians and battery cars do not interfere with each other. The battery car has a special cement road on the seaside at the foot of the mountain, and the sidewalk is halfway up the mountain. And in the case of increased security (the mountain road is indeed relatively narrow, and there are a few places that can be climbed down to the seaside, which needs to be guarded against), I personally feel that there are no other risks, so it is entirely possible to charge a fee appropriately and adopt a limited number of appoin**ents to open the hiking route around the island , highlighting the characteristics and characteristics of Wuzhizhou Island! If you can't walk around the island on foot, if you go once, there may be no need to go a second time!

And after other guests leave the island in the morning and evening, the whole island is beautiful and quiet. The pier is now on the west side in winter, and the afternoon sun warms the beach, so it won‚Äôt be cold to play in the water now. And you can enjoy a very beautiful sunset. Take the bus around the island before 10:30 in the morning, there are few people, and the scenic spot experience is good. These are the advantages of staying in a hotel. Wuzhizhou Island is very suitable for sightseeing, next time you find a summer vacation and come to Coral Hotel again. I ate at the Chinese restaurant of the hotel last night. There was a short-haired staff member named "Li Miao" (I peeked at her ID card, I don't know if I remember it right) in the restaurant. The service attitude was very good, and the set meal recommended to us was very special. Delicious, it fit our liking and came out quickly. I am very grateful to her, and she also helped us serve soup and chat, which is very heartwarming. In the past few days, because of the travel time, it is basically solved by the noodles at the scenic spots. I can sit down and enjoy a very delicious dinner. I am very satisfied! Thank you Xiao Li.

3. The service attitude of the whole hotel is very good, thumbs up! üëèThe swimming pool is very clean, and the content of the children's playground is quite richüåπThe breakfast is very rich, and the room size is also very largeüíê
4. I personally recommend going out to take pictures after other daytime tourists leave the island. 7-9 in the morning and 5-7 in the evening are very goodüç≠

Facilities: There is basically nothing missing in the room. I asked for mineral water twice and it was delivered.

Hygiene: Clean and welcome fruit, children like to eat it very much

Environment: Look at the picture for the environment, it‚Äôs worth the price

Service: The service is not bad, but there is no luggage delivery. It is inconvenient to carry luggage with children and no one will help
Breakfast: Breakfast is not as good as the year before last, and the dumplings are not bad

Meals are a bit expensive, 68 for a dumpling and 58 for a bowl of porridge, which is already the cheapest... Seafood is not flattering

msg:The hotel service is very good. The door of the room we were taken to was under repair. After calling the front desk, a little brother took us to this full sea view room within a few minutes. The pool on the balcony of the room is also very comfortable, suitable for taking a hot bath in the cold December. The disadvantage is that there is always a smell over the sink, until I found out that the smell came from a floor drain, and then I temporarily dealt with it myself and it was temporarily cured.
The front desk of the hotel is beautiful and open, and birds fly here from time to time. The bougainvillea in front of the gate is colorful, and the peacocks and parrots in the hotel garden also make people feel alive.
The breakfast is rich in variety, and the environment by the window sill for eating is also very beautiful. The hotel will open BBQ in the evening according to the number of occupants, 299 per person, there is roast suckling pig, you can try it. There is a restaurant on the second floor that is not recommended, the taste is not very good.
After living on the island for 3 days, the worst experience was brought by the toilet aunt on Wuzhizhou Island. I scratched my foot near the reef booth, and then went to the bathroom at the entrance of the pirate bar restaurant to wash the wound. Two cleaning aunts ran out in a row and said that you can‚Äôt wash your feet here, you have to wash outside (use the one in the sand-filled pool in Figure 9 Still water?). After I explained that I was a wound, I still refused to let go, and asked me whether this is the bathroom, whether I came to use the toilet or flush my feet, and I went to the infirmary to treat the wound, not here. As far as this attitude and quality is concerned, I don't want to argue with them even though I'm already in a bad mood after being injured. Instead, after returning to the hotel, Manager Zhou in the lobby called a battery car for me and went to the infirmary to make me feel the humanistic care I deserve.

The only five-star hotel on the island is generally good, but there is no supporting facilities around it, and there is no choice for dining and entertainment (it is probably to protect the ecology of the island from over-development)
Ctrip's live broadcast package is very cost-effective (including Wuzhizhou Island ferry ticket for two people/luxury round-the-island tour ticket/one night hotel/choice of breakfast, lunch and dinner/

Obviously, I had already booked a room when I went to the island, and told me that I had a baby. When I arrived in the room, there were no children's bathrobes or beach shoes! I changed my beach shoes twice. I told them the size and they sent me a pair of slippers that were bigger than my size 36! Finally, one size fits all! After I repeatedly stressed, I changed to a double small one, so? How come there are small sizes in a one-size-fits-all size? What's even more outrageous is that the waiter was very impatient and told the baby to be a boy, but instead gave him a pair of pink slippers! Forget it! But because of the day I left! Check out day! ! The waiter checked the luggage of other tourists and bumped into the reception desk at the entrance of the lobby! The table was so heavy that it hit my baby. I blocked part of it with my body, but it still hit my baby and there was no serious injury. The ankle was movable at that time and no bones were injured! I left because I had to catch a flight! But when I arrived at night, my ankle was still swollen! Currently still in the resting stage! Even my nails were turned purple! The hotel didn't do anything! ! ! That table is very heavy. If it wasn‚Äôt for my quick eyesight and quick hands, it might be serious! The baby's ankles can swell just by being touched! Why should it be placed in the place where tourists go up and down? ! Very excessive! ! ! The more I think about it, the angrier I get! ! !
Anyway, bad review! Compared to Yalong Bay Mangrove, the service attitude is completely different!

msg:My family and I were very satisfied with this stay at the Coral Hotel. Wuzhizhou Island is the business card of Hainan, and Coral Hotel is also the facade of Wuzhizhou Island. In particular, the following aspects make us feel the enthusiasm and good service of the people of Hainan: 1. The hotel facilities are worse than being famous, and it is free to meet. The parent-child two-bedroom suite has been upgraded. The room is very comfortable, very distinctive, clean and quiet, and the environment is comfortable; 2. In terms of service, I have felt very warm hospitality since I went to the island. The service staff are professional and polite. I would like to say that Because of my own reasons, I missed the boat to the island. When we were at a loss, the hotel immediately arranged an exclusive luxury speedboat to pick us up to the hotel. If there was no hotel boat, we would be living on the streets that night; There are many small animals, and the breeders are very attentive to feed them, which makes the whole island full of life, and the greening is done well. The whole trip made our family very happy and comfortable. If I have the opportunity to come to Sanya and Wuzhizhou again in the future, I will still choose the Coral Hotel! ! !

msg:The Chinese restaurant tastes good, but the price is slightly expensive (surely, there is only one restaurant on the island)
The hotel includes going back and forth on the boat, and the boat I took when I went there was about to vomit. When I returned, the boat was a little bigger, and it was fine.
If you are not going to play water sports, there is no need to live on the island. (There is a membership price for staying in the hotel and playing the project)
First of all, the probability of swimming in the sea on the island is still small. It is not allowed to go into the water before five o'clock in the afternoon, and it is not even possible to step on the waves. There is no hotel private beach, only public. Lots of tourists during the day, hardly anyone after 5pm. The rest went to the hotel pool to play in the water.
I booked a double bedroom, which is very strange. The bathroom is only in my room. It is embarrassing to ask my parents to take a bath in my room (and the bathroom is not sealed, and the curtain of the bathtub can be completely seen) It is embarrassing... I have to go to the elder when he takes a bath. The room stayed (because there was no living room).

The hotel is in a ring shape, so I have to walk ten minutes every time from my room to the main entrance (to the beach or to diving or to the pool), and the corridor air conditioner leaks and the whole corridor is wet.

The breakfast is more distinctive, but I have nothing to eat (probably not to my taste.)
There is a barbecue bar in the swimming pool at night, which is more lively. Not cheap either.
The water on Wuzhizhou Island is very clear, and I saw a lot of fish in diving. The membership price of more than 800 packs of photography is still good.
The room is hygienic, there are mosquitoes, so bring mosquito repellent. The hot water is very poor, it becomes very hot when washing, and occasionally it is very cold...

I brought two children (one is 11 and a half years old and the other is 5 years old). ), the Coral Hotel was the first and only one to let me pay for breakfast plus a child. The second was that the waiter came at 12 noon to urge me to check out and clean the room. I was just cleaning up the things in three to five minutes, so it was not necessary. I don‚Äôt even say whether the food in the a la carte restaurant is worth it. If you clearly mark the price, I will accept it. I'm so ashamed of you for paying 1,500 a night for a hotel!

I especially like to find a hotel to stay in and dig crabs with the sea breeze, drink a little wine on the beach, and let the trivial things in the day go. Back with the tide! The pool room I booked is particularly pleasant. The big bed is also the best bed that I have slept in the most recently after high-intensity stress. It is very comfortable. When I go out, there is a hot flash and a non-stick sea breeze. When I enter the house, it is a fresh and cool circulating air. There are many animals on the island, water games, sightseeing cars around the island, the sea is crystal clear, and you can catch the sea at night.

msg:I came to Wuzhizhou Island again, and I stayed at the Coral Hotel. From the reception center at the boarding and disembarking docks, the battery car driver, the hotel front desk, the concierge, the room attendant, etc., the service attitude is as good as always, a cup of herbal tea is served, a smile greets , all make people feel at home. The hotel has added a small robot to lead the way, which can take customers to the door of the room, and can remotely open the elevator door and press the floor button on the way, which is very fun and practical. I ordered a two-bathroom family room. The room is very large and clean. There are many children's products. The children like it very much. They also gave welcome fruits. The green outside the window is also very healing. When you come to Wuzhizhou Island, you must play marine sports. Hotel guests have discounts when buying packages. Due to child restrictions and time constraints, we only bought two 11-choose 3 packages. If you have time, we recommend buying extreme players at the hotel. In addition to the discount of more than 300 yuan, there is also a buffet lunch, which is very cost-effective. I see a lot of people complaining about the hotel's catering. Everyone's standards in this regard are different. Although I don't think it's very good, it's okay. Breakfast is included in the room. There are many choices. To meet the basic requirements of most people, I ordered a set meal of 488 yuan for lunch. The soup, grilled fish, chicken and fried vermicelli in it are very good. Although the other items are average, they are not bad, with an average of 122 yuan per person. Against the backdrop of the invincible seascape, it is not expensive, after all, it is in the scenic island. I chose to stay in the flash room. When I checked in, I took the room card directly and did not charge a deposit. When I checked out, there was no room inspection. It was very convenient and fast. The front desk and room service were very patient with the guests' inquiries. When it was delivered to the room, the child liked the little doll in the room very much, and let us take it away when we checked out. It can be felt that the staff of Coral Hotel are more attentive to the guests. In such an environment, even if there are some flaws, The flaws do not hide the beauty. Wuzhizhou Island has complete commercial facilities and invincible sea views. I will definitely stay at the Coral Hotel next time I come again.

The front desk will provide bird food for free. The details are very good. The hotel's swimming pool is very good, there are deep and shallow water areas, various types of swimming rings and arm ring life jackets are free to use, and other hotels basically rent them. It is also close to the beach, and all aspects can meet the psychological expectations of most people for an island vacation. And in this holiday, when the price of five-star hotels in the first line of Yalong Bay is almost doubled, the price of Coral Hotel has not increased much, which is more conscientious. Hope the hotel is booming and getting better and better!

My actual experience: You must stay on the island and stay at the Shanhu Hotel for more than one or two nights before you can truly experience the beautiful Hainan and experience various activities at sea. Because if you are only on the island in the morning and leave the island before dusk, you can only queue up to catch up with time, and the experience is naturally not good. I especially like the Coral Hotel, which has various room types, one-stop service for eating, drinking, and entertainment. The key is to clearly mark the price and spend money with confidence.

Later, I found that it was unnecessary, because it was enough to play on the island for one day. The hotel environment is really average, and the rooms are very large. The smell of the sea and the queuing for check-in is also a waste of time. The most important room for me is the innermost room. I feel like I can walk for a century when I arrive at the lobby early. This design is very unreasonable! It was so remote that we put a bag of garbage at the door, and no one took it away when we checked out the next day. Next time I go to Wuzhizhou, I should not choose to stay in a hotel! But the entertainment on the island is very rich and cost-effective, and the tour around the island is really comfortable. If you choose to go on a windy day, you can see the white waves of the waves hitting the rocks. Unfortunately, the weather was calm when I went there, which is a pity

msg:This is a hotel without any competition as it is the only one on the island. Because I stayed in the Coral Hotel from Yalong Bay for five days, there is no harm if there is no comparison! When I arrived to check in at 1:30, the front desk told me that the room had not been cleaned yet and that we would have to wait until 3 o'clock. I insisted on going to the room to have a look, and I was assigned a room next to the helicopter landing platform. How can I put it... it was just the noise of a tractor circling overhead, and I had to yell when I stood in the room. I asked to change rooms, and after struggling for 20 minutes, I was moved to the 6th floor. It turns out that there are empty rooms that are not noisy and can be checked in directly, but they are just deliberately trying to embarrass early guests!
       Let‚Äôs talk about prices. The elderly and children didn‚Äôt want to eat barbecue for dinner, so they didn‚Äôt go to the buffet barbecue. I chose the only restaurant to order from, but half of the dishes were sold out. A small bowl of tomato and egg shaved noodles + Baoluo noodles costs more than 100. 108 for a portion of scrambled eggs. This kind of consumption can only be seen in revolving restaurants in New York and Tokyo. The taste is so ordinary that you can't believe it was made by the hotel chef. It is recommended that those who want to stay here bring more mineral water and instant snacks. Once on the island, this is the only one, and there is no room for rip-offs.
        Let's talk about the service. There were so many mosquitoes at night that my child was bitten so many times that he couldn't sleep. I called the housekeeping depar**ent and was told that there was no electric mosquito coil, only a mosquito killer lamp. The mosquito killer lamp was completely useless. Half an hour later, the electric mosquito coil was delivered. It was a three-no product and it did not kill mosquitoes at all when plugged in. The child finally went home carrying more than a dozen large and small bags all over his body.
        I finally stayed up until 7:30 to have breakfast. The hall was dark. I asked seven or eight times if I could turn on the lights. I was told that I didn't have permission and that I had to go to the supervisor. Heaven! It's just a matter of turning on a light, it requires a supervisor. However, the speed at which children‚Äôs breakfast money is printed and signed is comparable to the speed of light.
       The only advantage of this hotel is not the hotel itself, but the natural environment of the beach. In the morning, tourists can catch a lot of hermit crabs on the rocks without going to the island. The quiet beach is still very pleasing to the eye, and this advantage has nothing to do with the hotel's price.

There are electric vehicles to travel in and out of the hotel. There are many water play activities here, and the hotel can play in the water until late at night. Because on the island, the food is slightly less and everything else is fine. A place worth visiting, maybe next year, the sea view is really beautiful, and the sea water is very, very clean

Including breakfast for 3 adults, round-trip ferry tickets for 3 gates and luxury cars, only 899. Tickets stored by Ctrip are cheaper than Fliggy Double Eleven. The beach at the hotel doesn't smell very good as there are a few horses around there. In the evening, the tourists dispersed and the scenery was beautiful. The room is big, but a bit old, similar to the luxury old hotel in the township level. The breakfast is ok, not as good as five stars, but not bad. The rice rolls are lining up. Dinner is a barbecue, but it is not recommended to order a set meal, the seafood set waited for an hour. The fried rice in the Chinese restaurant is 78 yuan for children. The swimming pool is very recommended, the children have a good time, and there are swimming rings, water guns and other toys that can be borrowed. Then external services, such as picking us up at Yalong Bay, and when we left, we made an appoin**ent to deliver to the hotel in Haitang Bay. These services are good.

This is the second time I have stayed at the Coral Hotel. This time the service is really bad: 1. I used to come here, the weather was hot, and the waiter would bring cool and antipyretic tea while waiting in the lobby. If you are here this time, ask and let me go The lobby bar, huh, there is a fee, no wonder, no matter what kind of hotel there is no such thing; 2. When I stayed on the first day, I found a gecko under the bed. I called the room center and said that someone would be sent to deal with it immediately, and I waited for 20 minutes. No one came, so I went directly to the front desk to find someone, and said that I was looking for someone to deal with it immediately. When I came back from the outside and asked, I said that I couldn‚Äôt find it. I went back to the room, and the quilt we moved by ourselves didn‚Äôt change at all, and I don‚Äôt know. Did I really find it? The baby said it was itchy at night. I don‚Äôt know if the gecko has crawled. 3. The weather is very hot, and I saw many guests have a fan. I asked the front desk, and the front desk said it was delivered, and I said We don&#39;t have it. She said that we can find the concierge desk. The concierge desk was empty at first, and then someone came and asked, saying that only certain VIPs were available. Is it discriminating against me like this? But there are really many people. They don&#39;t want me to come again, so why upgrade my room? Another sentence: Haha... üîîService: Haha

On the island, there is a hotel battery car to pick up and drop off. This is a good job. There is room for improvement in the front desk service. How to use the sightseeing bus around the island was not explained clearly to the guests. It turned out that it could only be used by going to the hotel concierge to exchange for a ticket, and the reception staff did not smile at all. The place where the hotel room is used is hygienic. It may be a little old. Inside the cabinet The hygiene of the hotel is really bad. It is recommended to set a time to do it carefully. In addition, the breakfast is good and tastes good. The food in the Chinese restaurant is also very good, but it is a bit expensive. Wuzhizhou Island is worth visiting. It is indeed very beautiful. You must take a sightseeing bus around the island. In my personal opinion, it is more appropriate to stay on the island for one night!

üöó Transportation: The accommodation will send the round-trip ferry ticket to Wuzhizhou Island, which is cost-effective; DSD diving with video photos also has a discount price, roughly 300 cheaper than direct purchase; I arrived late on the first day, and the island was already 4: 40. I plan to take the luxury round-the-island tour, but I didn't wait for the battery car. During the epidemic, there are few battery cars. Everyone needs to control the time in advance.

üßπHygiene: It was a garden view room at the beginning. It smelled musty when we entered, and it was facing the garbage door. It stinks and was very dissatisfied. The manager of the housekeeping department immediately upgraded us to a sea view room.

üçÉEnvironment: It is the only hotel on the island, just a few steps away from the pier. The facilities and decoration are really outdated. If you have higher requirements for the environment, choose the one in Haitang Bay. In addition, I do not recommend staying in Centipede One of the reasons for Zhizhou is that there is really no food around, only barbecue, only barbecue, and only barbecue. As a Guangzhou person, I feel drunk;

üîîService: The guy at the front desk was a little impatient at the beginning, the guy who helped us change rooms and move things, and the girl who checked out were all very enthusiastic, so I hope the hotel will replace the inappropriate rat **** as soon as possible, don't smash it I have my own sign; because it is a chartered car, the airport shuttle is useless.

msg:As a Hainan Islander, I really regret coming to Wuzhizhou Island for the first time. I regret not coming before! The Coral Hotel is very pleasant, the room infrastructure is very good, the service staff is very nice and very enthusiastic (quietly said that it is much better than some five-star attitudes I have stayed in before), especially the little brother who took us to check in, with a smooth hair The oil head, who seems to have a little white hair; and the service staff in the breakfast restaurant, are really good!
The hotel and Wuzhizhou Island are actually quite suitable for bringing children to play. There are many animals. In the past two days, I saw N peacocks and their young cubs, as well as many parrots and white pigeons. The overall feeling is very close to nature. ~In addition, Wuzhizhou also has coral planting activities, you can also experience it and do your part to protect the environment~
All in all, this is a hurried but very good journey, and I look forward to coming back next time~

The little brother at the reception was eager to bring us our luggage and take us on board the boat. The reception on the island was also super enthusiastic. The two little brothers at the front desk of the hotel were very satisfied. One of them was very handsome. Haha, I also enjoyed the robot leading the way and getting every point.

It was originally planned to stay for one day, but the doll didn‚Äôt want to leave, so I made a reservation for another day, playing on the beach and swimming pool. At the end of the day, I had a full buffet at the coral bar by the pool. It was quite pleasant. During the period, all kinds of services were especially good. The little brother from the coral bar has been helping to clean up and take care of the children. In addition, Feng Dongxiang, the waiter who cleaned the room, cleaned up in a timely manner and left gifts for the children. Check in on slack, quite dedicated. Personally, I feel that only living on an island can I enjoy inner peace with the sea. Well worth the trip, it's worth coming again.

msg:New Year's Eve together with the male ticket, so I chose this hotel.


üöó Transportation: You can get to the island by boat from the pier near Houhai Village. We took a taxi from the Yalong Bay Asia-Pacific Commercial Center. It took about half an hour and cost 65 yuan. The coral pool room we booked includes round-trip ferry tickets, Wuzhizhou Island tickets and airport shuttle fees. After registering with an ID card at the Coral Hotel office at the pier, a wristband will be issued to wear and walk through the green channel. You can board the boat without queuing. After arriving at Wuzhizhou Island, there will be a hotel battery car to pick you up from the hotel. Check-in is very fast, only the ID of the person who made the reservation.

üßπHygienic: The hotel is cleaned very clean, the room, swimming pool and outdoor small bathtub are very clean. From time to time in the hotel corridor, you can see the cleaning staff cleaning up the fallen leaves near the hotel.


üçÉEnvironment: The environment is very quiet, the hotel‚Äôs greenery is very good, and there are many animals walking through the green spaces and woods in the hotel. The most encountered are the peacocks, which are leisurely and leisurely. You can also see the free-range chickens and horses. The chicks and peacocks are looking for food together, having fun. There are also a lot of pigeons on the promenade in the hotel, and there are several grass and mud horses on a fenced lawn next to them. They are brown and white.


üîîService: From the front desk staff of the office under the island to the little brother of the battery car on the island, to the hotel staff are very enthusiastic, basically greeted with smiles, and very patient. When we got off the island, the little brother who drove the battery car heard that we were seasick, so he ran back to the hotel to help us get the seasickness sticker to the pier. He was very considerate.


Special reminder: When going on and off the island, be sure to sit in the back row as much as possible, don‚Äôt ask me why ü§£‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîA seasick person‚Äôs adviceüò≠

You must take the luxury sightseeing bus around the island once, and get off at the first stop of Ocean Star to see the super seascape, which will be unforgettable for a lifetime.

        Catering: the breakfast is rich and varied, which can meet the requirements of the guests; the front desk service of the Chinese restaurant is warm, and the local dishes are acceptable, but whether it is steamed or hot fried, the heat is obviously too much, and the color and flavor of the dishes are lost. I hope it can be improved. .

1- Two rooms are booked, 1200 garden view room and 1600 sea view room. There are hairy, damp, moldy pillows on the bed, and under the dim light, the closed shower room has the smell of sewers, and the bath in the room is still There are grains of sand.
2- I told the hotel before check-in that there were elderly people with limited mobility. Try to arrange them as close to the lobby side as possible. As a result, more than 10 rooms were arranged to open, and the other one was more exaggerated, which was more than 40 minutes away. Imagine returning from the water project, you can walk a few steps.
3- Cold face, stinky face, hard face, ignore face, despise face, all collected.
Asking for the direction of the room, the voice was very quiet, I couldn't hear it, and I asked again, especially impatient, and would not stand up and give directions.
The air conditioner in the room was extremely cold. The outside temperature was already 18 degrees. The air conditioner could not be adjusted. After making 5 calls, no one came. Finally learned that the central air-conditioning could not be adjusted.
The bedside power supply in the bedroom is broken. All facilities are dilapidated.
The mattress is spring! If it weren't for the ship to go back inland, I really don't want to go!
The hotel drove the battery car, rushed to the pedestrians, and came quickly! Turn convenience into excitement, regardless of passenger experience.

Finally, there are two options for dining in the hotel at night. The first restaurant, from the cheapest more than 80 Mapo tofu, chili-fried pork, to a seafood dinner of 3,500 yuan, shouldn‚Äôt be the one who thinks that the consumption level is relatively comfortable. This wasted money, understands that the cost of materials is high, and it shouldn't be the reason for the overlord price. Because no matter the hue is not worth the price.

The second choice is 228 buffet, hot pot barbecue, all, not to mention whether it is fresh or not, after paying the money, no one cares about you, there is no place, and most of them are persuaded by more than 80 mapo tofu. It was said that the whole audience was free for self-service. Finally, we went to get a Coke. The first sentence of the waiter was 12 yuan each. I despised the attitude of impatientness. I said no problem. Give you the money. At this time, a boy stopped me. There are free ones here. You don‚Äôt need to spend any money, so you can guide me over. That girl just keeps her head down and doesn‚Äôt speak when she sees it? ? ? ? The biggest difference between robots and humans is to be considerate of people!
Ask the hotel for masks, but the hotel refuses to provide them! 2800 can't you buy a mask? ? ?
The hotel that opened in 2001, and in 2016 and 2018, I‚Äôve been here for the third time this time. It‚Äôs a repeat customer. This time I‚Äôve got my neck flashed. The island is a good island. You can also accept it, but you treat the hotel as a dormitory. It‚Äôs boring for guests to be fools. They treat everyone as a one-time consumer and as a guest who doesn‚Äôt have enough money. What will you eat in the future? It's time to refurbish! It's time to rectify and rectify. There is a good comment from a little brother. The little brother gave me a fan very intimately and edited it for me. Let me give the praised content and the service is in place!

msg:High cost-effective hotel, five-star recommendation!
The 1000 yuan garden view room, the hotel took the initiative to upgrade to a sea view room, who sees the sea in bed! The hotel is very large and beautiful. Wuzhizhou Island is recommended to stay for one night. After the tourists leave, it is very quiet and you can take pictures of the beautiful scenery everywhere. In addition to the colorful sea, there are also lush vegetation, surrounded by colorful bougainvillea, and watch the sunrise and sunset. , Very worth staying for one night.
In addition to the price, although it cost 1,000, it was equivalent to about 500. First, we picked up at the Atlantis Hotel. We saved dozens of dollars and sent the airport to the airport worth more than one hundred. I saved another 280. It was a Mercedes-Benz business. There were only four people in the shuttle bus twice, so it was very comfortable. In addition, guests staying in luxury round-the-island tours are 18 cheaper per person, not to mention fast-track access to and from the island, with a private car to the hotel.
The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is also very rich, the seafood noodles are delicious, the ingredients are selected by yourself, and the breakfast is near the sea, and the mood is beautiful!
There is a car pick-up at the sunrise, 50 yuan per person!

I was also very careful when getting on and off the car to help with luggage.
I stayed in the pool room with breakfast, the room was clean, the swimming pool was useless, one was just to play on the island and there was no time to soak in the pool, and the swimming pool was quite small, only 0.8m for children with children, you can consider it. Breakfast is cooked The powder is okay, you can try it. I only stayed for one night. I didn‚Äôt eat other restaurants on the island except for breakfast. Besides, the water is very clear and the sand is very clean. The sea in Bialong Bay and Sanya Bay is too clean. But part of the island is rocky and can‚Äôt go to the sea, but there are many places with sandy beaches. It‚Äôs enough to take pictures and play. The scenic spots are not big, you can choose this if you have enough time and want to take pictures; there are also many entertainment projects, if you want to play entertainment projects or recommend to come to the island, at least not in Yalong Bay or Sanya Bay, the island is more expensive, but the water is good And it looks more formal, because I don‚Äôt make too many comments if I don‚Äôt play.

The environment is good, the scenery is beautiful, the battery car brother Zhang/. Rui safely sent us from the hotel to the pier to pick up and drop luggage. It is recommended to travel around the island and give us a small gift. It is a very good trip.

My son‚Äôs ears were bitten and swollen. The hotel gave a small bottle of toilet water to no use, I just remember I slept drowsily all night beating mosquitoes, and I couldn't sleep well anyway.

There are still dead fish in the fish tank by the bed. Fortunately, the ferry tickets and the tickets for the island tour are sent, which can be regarded as an increase in the price/performance ratio. There will be a barbecue outside the hotel at night, which is quite lively. The swimming pool is pretty good, there should be two. But the breakfast is really bad, basically nothing to eat. The better point is that the hotel rooms are equipped with a small swimming pool. When you return to your room at night, you can have a dip and play with your children in the small swimming pool.

I stayed in the family suite four or five years ago and it was good. Now it is decorated and not refurbished. The service has also declined. I dragged my luggage to the room and left. It took a long time to enter the house and it looked like the picture. It had not been cleaned and it was a mess. We dragged our luggage downstairs and the front desk did not apologize. They just said they would change us to another room. However, the air conditioner was not working properly and there were some unknown hairs on the ground. We called the front desk. No one answered the phone for a long time. It was over 30 degrees Celsius and there was no air conditioning. We went downstairs to find the complimentary fruit in the order at the front desk. It took several times to ask for it before it was delivered. It was so sour that it was inedible. The only good thing was that the pick-up and delivery by battery car was relatively timely. I planned to buy a package ticket for marine activities at the hotel the next day, but was told that I had to check out before 12 o'clock at the latest. If we bought the package ticket, we wouldn't be able to finish it before 12 o'clock, so forget it. I also informed everyone that if you stay at the hotel at night, only the hotel has it. The cheapest dish I ate was 98 for a bowl of scrambled eggs. It was expensive, but it didn‚Äôt taste good. I won‚Äôt stay there again.

2. The smart watch was forgotten in the hotel. After I left, I called the room service and said I didn't see it. Okay, I thought I was unfortunate.

The worst part of the whole Sanya, it is better to stay in Houhai B&B and go in by boat.
But the hotel swimming pool plus buffet feels good, but don't have any expectations for the food, you still have to live without bad money. After all, the water on the island is so beautiful. There is no choice of hotel, only this one.
