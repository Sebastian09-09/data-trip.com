msg:Thanks a wonderful 3 night stay. It was amazing experience. Right from checkin to checkout it was perfect. The staff was extremely helpful. Request for a top view rooms, you will have the view of the mountains and the sea. The breakfast was perfect and there was multiple vegetarian options. I would recommend this hotel for family and business travellers. There is a massive pool open from morning till late evening. Children can enjoy with multiple pool toys and floaters. The beach is just 3 minutes walk. There is parking available for guests. There are multiple resturants right on the footsteps like Starbucks, and many Hainan resturants.

Really helpful even though they cannot speak English they did their best for us to have a nice stay,  but for us the premium sea view room with a bathtub in the balcony on top floor was the best feature and since there weren’t many people around at that time you could easily take a bath without someone seeing you. The rooms sundown view was one of the best. This hotel is 7 minutes walk from the bus stop and there is a plaza on -1 floor which was semi open due to COVID situation. The beach is intact and beautiful but we couldn’t find any water activities around us which we were told they are all centered in Yalong Bay at that time. I wish there were some info about these stuff. There was one major problem though, the water would spill everywhere everytime we took a shower in the shower booth.

First of all, I would like to mention the housekeeper Mark in particular. His service is really thoughtful. No matter what I need, he can always help me solve it in the first time, which makes me feel the meticulous care.

Wyndham's facilities are also very complete, with children's playgrounds, cinemas, and supermarkets. Whether it is a family with children or a friend traveling alone, you can find your own fun here. Especially the children's playground, which is designed to be safe and interesting. Children have a lot of fun here, and adults can enjoy their leisure time with peace of mind.

It is really convenient to live here, whether it is shopping or entertainment, you can easily satisfy it. Moreover, Wyndham's environment is also very beautiful, which makes people feel happy. In general, I have a very good impression of Wyndham, and I am very satisfied with both the service and facilities. Highly recommended to everyone!

The day before we arrived, he took the initiative to ask about our needs, which made us feel caring before we set off. After checking in, he personally led us to the room and gave us fruit attentively, which really made people feel warm.
The front desk service of the hotel is also very good, always with a warm smile, actively solving various problems for us. Moreover, they also delayed the check-out time for us, which is really humane, allowing us to arrange the itinerary more calmly.
In short, I am very satisfied with the accommodation experience at the Wyndham Sanya Lihe Hotel. The service staff here are very attentive and professional, allowing us to spend an extremely wonderful time here. If I have the opportunity to come to Sanya next time, I will definitely choose here again without hesitation.

I will stay here next time. I may consider staying in this hotel for one night on the last night. The most important thing is that the service of the hotel is really good, much better than other hotels. There are also many people eating downstairs. I ate coconut milk chicken.

msg:It was the off-season when we came, and the hotel upgraded us to a sea view room on the top floor.
To be honest, the room did have some problems, such as being a little old and a little damp, but I still thought it was very good. The day we arrived was Children's Day, and there were many children. The hotel's parent-child outdoor activities lasted for nearly 3 hours: crossing the river by feeling the stones, fishing in troubled waters, water gun battles, bubble parties, and dinosaurs. Our children participated and got small gifts, which made him very happy.
For two consecutive days, we also went to the children's playground to play. The sanitary environment inside was good, with indoor ocean balls, cinemas, game consoles, etc. The service was also good. The staff (Diana Yan, Koi Li) were very enthusiastic, helping to catch dolls and introducing delicious and fun things around.
Brand hotels may have some problems with the newness and oldness of the rooms, which is an objective existence and cannot be avoided. However, in terms of supporting facilities (gyms, cinemas, restaurants, etc.), services, and details, they still have their own advantages.

msg:This is a parent-child holiday paradise [strong] As soon as we arrived at the lobby, we were greeted by the housekeeper Vinnie in person. We were warmly welcomed, checked in efficiently, and sent our family back to the room with laughter all the way. Manager Hong introduced the hotel's restaurant information and business hours, children's activities information and opening hours in detail. The hotel store was fully arranged, and these arrangements were enough to prove that his professionalism and his dedication to customers were absolutely from the heart. Let the customers not feel a little hypocrisy, but we feel full of sincerity, sincerity from the heart. I often chat with him. He has been in Sanya for 17 years 👍An authentic northeastern person in Sanya 😄Such service is particularly cordial, just like a friend. The disadvantage is that the hotel lobby is too hot, which may be the characteristic of Sanya. When leaving the hotel, the housekeeper also gave the children a small gift, which the children liked very much. When the children are older, we will come again...

He introduced me to the restaurant and swimming pool along the way. The service of this hotel is very good. The surrounding environment is also good. It is close to the beach and some scenic spots. I stayed here for one night and later chose to take a bath in the B&B. In order to attract crabs, I chose to take a bath in this hotel. For convenience, I chose this hotel. The biggest feature of this hotel is that the concierge butler Vinnie Xiaohong provides comprehensive services. From picking up the airport to traveling, renting a car, and sending us off, the one-stop service is absolutely in place. The butler recommended that we eat their hotel buffet. The hotel buffet is quite good.

Every morning, he will ask how the breakfast is and where it is. He helped to send some hotel information for us to check. The hotel is quite grand and has been upgraded.

msg:I came to Sanya with my husband during the May Day holiday. Staying at Wyndham was the wisest choice we made. First of all, it is very close to the airport. You can get there by taxi at the starting price. When you get off the car, there will be security to help you with your luggage. It's very considerate. Secondly, the environment of the hotel is also very good. You can see the sea as soon as you open the door. The breakfast is also delicious.

msg:A very cost-effective hotel. It is close to the airport. I was picked up when my flight landed very late. There is a shopping mall behind the hotel. It is very convenient to eat there. The breakfast is very rich. The price is not too high during the off-season. There are many parent-child activities. The hotel facilities are quite complete. The service of the butler Alan is really good. He specially prepared child guardrails and strollers for us. The room he arranged is also very good. He also gave us fruits and game coins. I highly recommend it. It is very cost-effective. I feel very happy staying here❤️I don’t have to worry about anything. It is very suitable for mothers like me who just want to come to the hotel to take care of their children👍👍

msg:Stayed here for 5 days and 4 nights. First of all, I am very grateful to the housekeeper Alan for his care. He provided all-round support for my stay from the first day I arrived at the hotel. Because the view from the room was not very good at the beginning, I talked to Alan about it. Two hours later, Alan contacted me and upgraded me to a large suite for free. I am really grateful for this. Secondly, the free fruit drinks were delivered to the room as soon as they were delivered. If I needed anything, I could solve it with just one sentence. This is something I can't experience in other hotels. I am really grateful to Alan and all the staff of Wyndham Lihe. I will continue to stay in this hotel next time I come to Hainan. It's great!

msg:The overall planning of the hotel is reasonable. The renovation and design of the guest rooms are very good, which makes up for the shortcomings of the construction technology. The room supplies are well selected and the room service is well-trained. The front desk check-in process can strengthen the training and optimize the process. As a resort hotel, breakfast is a highlight. It is recommended to strengthen the process training or effectively optimize the table design. The buffet dinner is rich in variety, the quality of seafood ingredients needs to be improved, and there are too many frozen ones, which is far from the expectations of Sanya guests. The housekeeper service is well-trained and the communication is timely, which adds points to the hotel. Overall, it is a hotel with great potential for profitability.

There are also many children's activities. The baby likes it very much, making cookies, picking coconuts and other activities. The most important thing is that the service is very good. I especially praise the concierge Vinnie. He greeted us as soon as he got up in the morning and gave us a lot of help. Thank you again for making our trip to Sanya very convenient. There is also the lifeguard Xu Wandong, who greeted and helped the children warmly when they were swimming. I was really happy staying at Wyndham for a few days. I will come again next time! Thank you for the warm-hearted family of Wyndham Hotel.

I was in a bad mood due to the delayed arrival, but the housekeeper's careful arrangements - immediate check-in, free room upgrade, leaving two sets of sand digging tools for the two children, and recommending delicious and cost-effective small seafood food stalls... made our family feel relieved on the first day. Allen also printed homework for the sister who skipped school early, hahahaha, she didn't forget to study on the trip! The bar brother sang very well👍The hotel chartered car is also relatively cheap, and you can go directly to the hotel to arrange a day trip for the next day. The children were reluctant to leave. In terms of cost-effectiveness, this price and this service, I must stay a few more days next time👍

The hotel upgraded me to a sea view room. Since the flight was late the next day, the butler Chocolate also applied for a late check-out and sent Hainan specialties in the evening. This service was so considerate. The children were very happy and satisfied with the stay.

I was quite satisfied with it. The butler Oswald H provided great service and was very thoughtful. He arranged everything perfectly even though we arrived very late, and even upgraded us to a deluxe sea view room. He was like a friend from another country.

In the evening, we had a buffet, and there were many seafood varieties and they were relatively fresh, especially the sashimi salmon tasted very good. After dinner in the evening, we went shopping downstairs to the commercial plaza, where there are Starbucks, Pizza Hut, and a movie theater. It was really convenient.

The warm and polite little brother who was born in 1995😄The hotel breakfast restaurant is my favorite, the environment is very good Great, but I don’t know why the breakfast chef doesn’t make egg rolls? Also, the flavor of the braised noodles in the noodles is a bit bland. The toilet seat in the room needs to be filled with mud, otherwise it will always squeak. Two of the three welcome fruits are unpalatable, but the housekeeper Duoduo is very considerate and gives them to you. He bought us a lot of water and drinks and two golden coconuts. After we left the hotel, he was still able to answer our questions enthusiastically👍The travel photography service was not good. It may have been contracted to a third party. In the end, the photography was not taken due to time reasons. Overall For a five-star hotel chain, I would give it nine out of ten points.

The staff at the front desk were warm, friendly and attentive, making me feel at home during my stay. Special mention goes to the butler Louis. His service is really meticulous and made me feel truly attentive and caring.

Here, I not only enjoyed a high-quality accommodation experience, but also felt the sincerity and enthusiasm of the hotel staff.

He helped us check in and took us to the room. He also prepared snacks and white fungus soup for us. When we woke up in the morning My younger brother also sent a message to ask if we were resting well. After breakfast, we also went to the children's playground. The equipment and facilities in the children's playground are still very good, and the children had a lot of fun playing. Ocean ball, carousel, and a small cinema. When I checked out that day, our housekeeper also helped me postpone the room. I felt that Wyndham Hotel was still very user-friendly and humane, which was great!

A professional housekeeper will contact us in advance before we check in, provide warm service, upgrade the room for us, and decorate it warmly. The bedding was also very comfortable. The service quality of the hotel is very good, especially the butler Janet, who is very professional and enthusiastic. If I have any questions during my stay for a few days, I will answer them in seconds! Knowing that we had a baby, all the details were taken into consideration. She is the outstanding employee this year! Thanks also to the staff at the pool desk, Xiao Wu. Seeing that we were taking photos with our kids, they specially brought out all the magic tools for taking pictures: paddle boards, Internet celebrity little yellow ducks, and electric surfboards. Anyway, they provided us with all the props that can take perfect photos, and they always cared about us. Safe, thank you to the above two for your service.
The package we booked includes several major children's rides, breakfast, and a seafood barbecue dinner. The quality is also very good. (I would like to make a suggestion. In the breakfast area, the juice replenishment speed is a bit slow. In the past two days, the bottle has reached the bottom of the bottle. Everything else is praiseworthy)
Only when the staff at a hotel provide warm and considerate service will the vacation be more enjoyable. Wyndham has done just that. I highly recommend this hotel.

Especially my personal butler Tony, his service level is excellent and he is very considerate. He continuously delivered green coconuts and some fruits, and the hotel also provided a free mini bar for the first round. Tony asked the hotel to prepare it for us the next day. It can really be described as impeccably humane.

This hotel is very unique. They receive every guest in a friendly and thoughtful way. No matter what help you need or where you need to take you, they will try their best to satisfy you. I especially like their restaurant. The dishes are rich and varied and taste great. Whether you like light or heavy flavors, you can find the food that suits you here! And whether you want to dine with ocean views or in a cozy environment, the restaurant can always satisfy your needs.

In addition, we were originally here for our honeymoon. Tony called me one day in advance and upgraded our room to a supreme sea view room and decorated it. As soon as we entered, we felt that the room was very clean and tidy. The space is also spacious and bright. Some rooms also have excellent balconies, where you can overlook the beautiful scenery of the sea in the distance. It is a great choice to rest or meditate here. The beds here are so comfortable and the towels and pillows are of such good quality that it's hard to leave.

Also, this location is also very good. It's just steps from the beach, making it easy to get to and play in the sand. There are many shopping malls and entertainment venues around the hotel. You can buy your favorite souvenirs or various gourmet snacks right out of the hotel. It is very suitable for those of us who want to enjoy the full range of travel fun!

The afternoon tea prepared by the butler was also completed and the experience was very good. I will definitely come back and stay for a few more days. It was a very good experience.

Your trip to Sanya will be wonderful because of you. The location of the hotel is very close to the airport and not far from Nanshan and other scenic spots. It is convenient to go back and book it. Yes, I'm really surprised that the service is so good. The breakfast is not bad, but there are so many people. The swimming pool environment is very good. It takes about 10 minutes to walk from the beach to Xiahaikou. The free Chinese food with the order was the same meal for two. There was a waiter in the store who was very friendly and changed it to a dish of the same price. So again I tried the seafood dustpan board at the Molan Restaurant and the Huangchu Seafood Private Dishes nearby. They were not unreasonable at all. They were really good. I was bitten by an insect. The hotel staff took the initiative to take care of me and gave me anti-mosquito stickers. I had a pleasant stay. time

The hotel is generally good, very close to the airport, but not too noisy. The rooms are clean and tidy, and the breakfast is rich in variety. Both Chinese and Western food are delicious.

The environment of the hotel is very beautiful, and the service cannot be said enough👏! The sanitary condition is also very good, clean and tidy, which is reassuring. The facilities are very new and the afternoon tea for two is very pleasant😌.
There are many delicious seafood restaurants around, the prices are affordable, the taste is very good, it’s worth it🦀! This team-building trip became even better because of Wyndham Lihe. I highly recommend it to everyone🥳!

My wife casually said that yesterday was the child's birthday, and he ordered a birthday cake for us and waited for us to come back after 8 o'clock in the evening. The service was great. Our three rooms are also arranged close to each other, which is convenient for our family. The rooms are also very clean. I will choose Lihe Hotel next time.

There is also a butler recommended by the hotel to provide services for us. The butler Jin's service is very thoughtful and considerate, and he will arrange my stay according to our itinerary.

😀Twin rooms can share beds, which is really nice! It's a little far away from the Coconut Dream Corridor. You can't even take a taxi during the Spring Festival. You can only walk or take a taxi.
😀The children's playground is also available, children like it.
😀The cocktails in the lobby bar are delicious, and the resident singer sings well~~

After leaving the airport, a very cute driver from Wyndham, Rod, picked us up, which was very heartwarming🩵
Today is the birthday on my ID card. Wyndham upgraded me to a king-size room with ocean view and thoughtfully prepared a birthday cake and longevity noodles. The butler Ameng also gave me welcome fruit and two coconuts with the hotel’s logo. Full of surprises
Special thanks to Ah Meng. The problem was solved quickly and I was very satisfied. I feel that this housekeeper has a calm personality and is capable in his work. I hope the hotel will reuse him!

If you need anything, just send us a WeChat message, get a mineral water drink, watch a movie or go out for fun, everything is well arranged. I originally planned to stay in Haitang Bay, but the service provided by Alan the butler is really good, so I extended my stay for a few more days and asked the butler to order. Like it, I will recommend it to my friends. It is a great stay experience. I will come here every year and choose Wyndham [呲ya] as my first choice.

As soon as I entered the lobby, my eyes lit up. The decoration was modern and beautiful, the lobby staff were warm and friendly, and the receptionist Smiled throughout the process and checked in quickly. The overall decoration of the room is fashionable, clean and hygienic. If you need anything, you can get it done with just one phone call, which is very efficient. Breakfast is open until 11 o'clock, which is very friendly to vacationers. This time the hotel arranged for the service butler Jeff to communicate with us. Before check-in, he called us to discuss room preferences and other related matters. He paid attention to us every day and proactively served us. He was as warm as an old friend. The whole stay felt more worry-free. There is a heated swimming pool for children, a bubble show every afternoon, dinosaur appearances and other activities that children like. The children had a great time and will continue to choose to stay here next time they come to Sanya.

Because it was winter and I was afraid that the children would catch a cold, I specially chose the Wyndham, which has a constant-temperature children's swimming pool. The butler Allen was not only warm and friendly, but also proactively helped me book the airport shuttle bus. They also helped me delay check-out. In the end, my flight was delayed, so they delayed my check-out for another two hours. This made my originally troublesome return trip a lot easier. What surprised me the most was that the hotel also has a children's playground, which made my family happy. The children enjoyed it and had a great time. This is undoubtedly a perfect choice for families with young children. Here, we feel the warmth and comfort of home. Thanks again to Allen and all the Wyndham staff for their warm and attentive service, which made our vacation a great one. I have no hesitation in recommending Wyndham hotels to any traveler looking for comfort and convenience.

First of all, I have to mention that our butler, Oswald, was really nice! He always greeted us with a smile and served us warmly and attentively, making us feel as comfortable as if we were back at home. We were deeply moved by the meticulous care and service and made us enjoy the entire trip even more.
Then there is the hotel swimming pool! It is really big and has a variety of water facilities, such as slides, surfboards, etc. We played and had fun in the swimming pool every day and it felt like time flew by. Both adults and children will be attracted by this huge swimming pool.
Let’s talk about the room we stayed in. The sanitary conditions of this hotel are very good. The sheets and towels are changed daily, which makes people feel very at ease. Moreover, the hotel is located near the business district, with various shops and restaurants just a short walk away. Shopping, dining and other needs can be met, which is so convenient.

Wyndham Sanya Lihe has a five-star service experience. The room is very large. The double bed room also comes with a sofa bed. It is spacious for two adults and two children. The decoration inside is also very grand. There is also a desk and eye protection lamp. The eldest brother came with his homework, and he can also do homework at night, which is great. There is also a large balcony with wicker chairs and a large bathtub, facing the sea, super comfortable!

When you are on vacation here, you can have many water entertainment activities such as windsurfing, kayaking, etc., to make your vacation more fulfilling and colorful. And the restaurants here are also very delicious, with all kinds of fresh seafood and authentic Hainanese dishes, which taste great. The waiters are also very nice and make you feel at home.

First, let’s talk about its impeccable accommodations. The entire hotel gives people a relaxed and comfortable feeling. Each room is beautifully decorated and fully equipped. Whether it is a business trip or a vacation, it can meet your needs.
In addition, for those guests who have higher requirements for service quality, the hotel's butler service is definitely the best choice. Alan is one of the best, his warm and considerate attitude is impressive. No matter what questions you have or need help with, Alan will go out of his way to solve it. During the Laba Festival, Laba porridge is also provided. Such considerate service is really rare in today's business era.
Of course, the most important thing you can’t miss when you come here is the spacious and bright balcony with ocean view. Standing there, you can feel the fresh sea breeze blowing on your face, and the boundless sea is in front of you. More importantly, it is very close to the beach. It only takes a few minutes to walk to the beach and enjoy the sun and sand.
In general, Wyndham Lihe is a rare high-quality hotel in terms of environment, service and location. I believe that if you have the opportunity to stay, you will be attracted by its charm and leave unforgettable memories. Thank you again for reading my sharing. I hope you will also have the opportunity to experience this warm and beautiful place for yourself. I wish everyone’s life is filled with laughter and warmth!

After staying for three days, they also helped us delay check-out and provided us with a free bus to Haitang Bay, allowing us to experience Lihe's warmth and enthusiasm from beginning to end. Thank you Vinnie! The whole check-in process was very pleasant! All staff at the hotel greet you warmly and proactively ask if you need help. The hotel's seafood buffet barbecue is also very cost-effective, and it's a great value for money in time for Chris**as! The hotel environment is very clean and hygienic, with clear signs. Although it is not far from the airport, the rooms are single-sided rather than double-sided, so the sound will not disturb the guests' normal rest. The breakfast is very rich, but there are so many guests. Maybe everyone likes to stay in Lihe. It takes about 5 minutes to walk to the beach. You can watch the sunrise and sunset on the beach. The travel photos provided by the hotel are also very good!

msg:I rarely write reviews. I made a temporary reservation at the Wyndham Sanya Bay Hotel for my last night because it is close to the airport. I have never stayed at a Sanya Bay Hotel. I was heartbroken after reading the reviews. It turned out to be a surprise for this trip! After visiting Yalong Bay and Atlantis, I came to Sanya Bay and realized that I should stay for a few more days. Sanya Bay is quiet, has soft sand and small waves, and has many water sports. The main reason is that the Wyndham Hotel is very cost-effective. The room has a view of the sea. The decoration is quite new. The beds are clean and not trendy at all. The walk is very close to the seaside and the breakfast is rich. The children love it, especially the service. I have to give a thumbs up. The housekeeper has a beautiful girl named Susie Tang. He was soft-spoken and kind, so he upgraded the room type when I brought my two children with him. He also said he would let us see if the room is suitable first, which was very considerate! She also thoughtfully reminded us that the hotel service, breakfast, and travel photography were temporarily arranged for us. Knowing that we had a late flight, she specially gave us a late check-out. In short, this girl really cares about the guests. Next time we decide to visit Sanya Bay for a few days, we asked Susie to arrange this hotel service. Very good value for money😁👍🏻

The children's playground and other amu*****t facilities are very complete. The hotel also has one-on-one butler service, which is really great. No matter what the request is, the butler will try his best to meet it. If you have something to do after staying for two days, you can leave the hotel. I came back two days later and asked the housekeeper to help us arrange the room in advance. I really appreciate the housekeeper Louis. It’s so hard. The parking space is sufficient and free. I am really satisfied with this stay. Thank you again to the housekeeper. Louis, see you next time in Sanya.

The hotel staff are well-trained and you can feel the high-quality service everywhere. When we came to the hotel, the road was closed during the marathon event. After contacting the lobby, we immediately sent staff to the opposite side of the hotel to help us carry our luggage. The boys carrying the luggage all greeted me with smiles. When encountering problems, the housekeeper Alan communicated promptly and solved the problem quickly. Contact us proactively to provide airport drop-off service. The butler's service made us feel considerate and warm. I introduced and booked a room for a friend. They also felt the same way and entrusted me to express their gratitude and praise on their behalf. The breakfast is rich in variety and the ingredients are fresh and delicious. I will stay here again next time. Friends who are in need of a hotel of this quality should come here to experience it.

Like autumn! Four or five days here is probably not enough! The service at the hotel is great! The housekeeper contacted us in advance, and we happened to meet the housekeeper Jin who was working the night shift. He also received us at the door. The service attitude was very good! The hotel's facilities are very complete, and the housekeeper also helped our baby book various small items in the children's paradise! This stay was a great experience! I will continue to stay here next time I come back, it’s great!

I booked a sea view room and was upgraded to a supreme room for free. The sea view is amazing. There is a large bathtub on the balcony. The children have to take a bath every night. They also have to take a bath while looking at the sea view and eating snacks!
There is a heated swimming pool for children, bubble games, and dinosaurs.
Picking coconuts is great (4 coconuts for 35 yuan, you can drink coconut juice directly after the sticks are made, and you can also eat coconut meat), very fresh!
Children's playground, children can stay for a long time!
There are also places to eat nearby!
It only takes 10 minutes to go to the beach. In the evening, I went to Coconut Dream Corridor. There were little hermit crabs everywhere. I picked up a lot of them with my children!

I was afraid of being cheated. But in the end I felt that there was no bad review, so I decided to renew the room for two more nights. At night, since there were no rooms available during the peak season, the Rain housekeeper adjusted the room for me. He took a lot of trouble, answered all my questions and responded positively. Thank you to this handsome young man here. The seafood food stalls nearby are very delicious, and it is very close to the seaside, which is convenient for taking children to play. The coconut chicken downstairs is also very delicious. I will stay at Wyndham next time I come here

It’s a 10-minute drive from the airport. It’s very convenient to go to Tianya Haijiao, Nanshan Cultural District, and the Big and Small Cave Sky on the same route.

The hotel has a variety of breakfast options, including outdoor and indoor areas.
The resident singer in the hotel lobby at night is also great
The Lihe MoHo Plaza downstairs has a cinema and a variety of food. There is a free shuttle bus to the airport every day. Just make a reservation in advance.
Lihe Wyndham Hotel exceeded expectations. The warm service and comfortable environment made this trip to Hainan even more enjoyable.

We were really shocked by the traffic in Sanya. It was really congested. Although the hardware facilities cannot be called a great hotel, I would like to say that the butler service here is simply a perfect 💯rave review, which completely adds to the hotel experience! My housekeeper, Mr. Zhu Rufeng, is a shy and down-to-earth young man. He really responded to my requests and upgraded me to a sea view room, so that my baby could take a bath on the balcony and watch the scenery, and also see the beautiful sunset! In addition, they also arranged a warm and convenient airport drop-off service for me, which made it much more convenient for me to take care of my baby alone. They turned on the air conditioner early before check-in and brought me fruits and desserts. It was definitely a home away from home experience!
Since there is a children's playground here, babies can also have a lot of fun playing there. That's because of the careful care of Miss Chole, so the children have a lot of fun playing there.

For those who want to enjoy the beautiful scenery, the sea view of Wyndham Hotel Lihe must not be missed. Standing by the window and looking out, the magnificent scenery of the sea seems to be right in front of you, and your whole body and mind will be attracted by the charm of nature. Imagine waking up in the early morning with the fresh sea breeze, that feeling is so wonderful. Not only that, the open-air balcony is also an excellent viewing spot. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the bay and chat and drink with friends here. It is really a wonderful experience.

Overall, Wyndham Lihe is really a place full of surprises.

We met Vinnie, the concierge, who helped us arrange the hotel very well and made us have an unforgettable trip. This time we came with our baby and mother. The second time we stayed at Wyndham Lihe Hotel was even better than the first time. Vinnie, the concierge butler, helped us upgrade to a sea view suite for free. The kids and husband both thought it was great and even gave us a free upgrade. We arranged for an upgraded breakfast, but unfortunately we didn't use it because we had to catch a flight, but the hotel packed breakfast for us and arranged a special car to take us to the airport. My husband and children both felt regretful not to stay one more night, mainly because the plane had already checked in and there was no way to change the booking, otherwise we really wanted to stay two more days. I am very satisfied with the hotel, and the super concierge housekeeper Vinnie. I will definitely stay at Lihe Wyndham again next time I come to Sanya, and I will definitely look for Vinnie!

After all, the facilities and equipment in the hotel rooms are incomparable to those of newly renovated hotels. Fortunately, they are well maintained, complete with complete facilities and considerate services, which make up for the slight shortcomings. From the moment we entered the hotel lobby, the bellman at the door was attentive and enthusiastic, and the receptionist was a handsome man who patiently explained and carefully arranged the stay, making my son and I's stay in the hotel smooth and enjoyable. The room attendant is a little beauty from Henan. She cleans in time and always greets us with a smile. She really makes us feel at home. What I am most grateful for is that I contacted my Bingyu housekeeper in advance. There was nothing I could not think of, and there was nothing she could not do. The day after I checked in was my birthday, and she arranged the room decoration, sent me a small cake, and arranged for me after 10 o'clock in the middle of the night. During the drop-off at 5 a.m. the next day, breakfast was packed and taken away. . . There are so many, it really feels like home.

msg:Wyndham Sanya Lihe is really great, beyond my expectations.
✈It's very close to Phoenix Airport, just a few minutes' taxi ride away.
🏨The hotel is very new. Compared with the Sanya Bay Hotel where I stayed before, this facility is really new and the staying experience is great.
👍I particularly like the view of the coconut grove at the swimming pool. It’s great to take photos and check in at night. The food is also great and very delicious. As the first stop in Sanya Bay, you must stay here once. You will not be disappointed.

msg:The check-in experience was great. The service staff were very friendly and the hotel facilities are great. There is a swimming pool downstairs. Rain, the guy at the front desk, also helped us upgrade to a deluxe sea view room for free. We can see the sea from the balcony. It's really great. Great, there is a bathtub on the balcony. Taking a bubble bath is really a comfortable way to relax. We accidentally lost our room key bracelet. When the guy found out, his first reaction was to care about whether we had enough room keys. He was really considerate. After knowing our itinerary, he arranged for a car to take us to the scenic spots. Knowing that we had an early flight, he packed three breakfasts for us for free. Thank you so much Rain. I will come back to this hotel if I have the opportunity in the future. I must give it a thumbs up 👍

The hotel is not very big. There are singers in the evening. The breakfast is quite good and has a variety of varieties. The view is beautiful when staying on a higher floor. It is very suitable for children to play and it is very clean. It is the best choice for leisure vacation. I will choose here again next time I come!

The housekeeper Ada contacted her a day in advance. We understand the itinerary and come up with special needs, like pillows for children! Sand digging tools, cute cakes, etc. can all be arranged in advance. The housekeeper is also enthusiastic and considerate. He has introduced the hotel situation, food, accommodation and entertainment in Sanya in detail. If the child is not feeling well, he is always attentive and can be contacted at any time. It can make people feel like they have a friend in this city. They no longer feel strange. Although the trip is short, the warmth is always there.

The most satisfying thing is the service here. The housekeeper Tina is really considerate. Not only did she upgrade us to a supreme sea view room, the three of us also directly applied for an extra bed. We spent too much time at the attractions on the last day and didn't have time. When we came back in time, the housekeeper helped us delay check-out until after 4 pm for free. Finally, he arranged for colleagues to help us take us directly to the airport. I was really touched!

There are singers in the lobby after 8 pm. You can sit there and listen to and order songs without ordering anything. An hour passes before you know it.

The bed in the room is very soft. When you lie on it, you feel like your whole body is being wrapped. The quality of your sleep is directly improved to a new level.

I was originally worried that the family hotel would be noisy if there were many children, but in fact the soundproofing was very good and I couldn't hear any noise at all.

In short, this is the right hotel to stay in Sanya Bay, the experience is maximal

After booking a hotel, the housekeeper will thoughtfully call you to inquire about your check-in needs before arriving at the hotel, and will also recommend interesting attractions and lightning protection! (This is important) Free pick-up service was provided upon arrival. After checking into the hotel, the housekeeper Vinnie will communicate effectively with the guests and provide timely and considerate help!
The hotel's environment is very elegant. When you enter the room, you face the floor-to-ceiling windows facing the sea. The oncoming sea breeze feels very comfortable~
Breakfast 🥣 is also very delicious, the taste is in line with my expectations, and the service is also very good! There are many types of breakfast, especially the Hainan fried rice noodles, I love it!
The location of the hotel is very convenient, with convenient transportation in the city. It is adjacent to Sanya Bay and you can also hike to the Coconut Dream Corridor. The sunset there is really beautiful! And the coconut chicken is awesome!
Five-star praise is worth recommending!

Allen, the concierge butler, is very attentive and patient. Even though it was inconvenient to have children, he also helped deliver afternoon tea to the room and took good care of the children's lives.

There is a bathtub on the balcony, and the children feel good while playing in the water and watching the scenery. In just a few days, I felt so comfortable that I wanted to stay in bed every day. Now that I’m back, it’s so cold in the north🥶I miss my vacation days!

The key point is the hotel's service, which is really good. Every staff member is very enthusiastic. I would like to praise Miss Yang Amy at the front desk. The service is very good and enthusiastic, and she can solve the guests' needs very well. Like, like. I had a lot of fun these four days and I think I will choose it again next time!

msg:I am very satisfied with the hotel reservation this time. I specially chose a room with a view of the sea. The view of the sea in the room is very good, the view is very wide, and there is a bathtub on the balcony. Facilities: full marks. Hygiene: full marks. Environment: full marks. Service: full marks. There is a swimming pool downstairs, as well as a parent-child playground and a heated children's swimming pool. It takes seven or eight minutes to walk from the lobby to the seaside. Opposite the sea is the West Island, which is very close to many scenic spots. The room has no peculiar smell and is clean and tidy. There is also a small refrigerator, and there are free drinks on the first day of check-in. The front desk service/room service is also very good. They respond quickly to any needs. I must like it.

The butler Zhou Jianli started contacting me before I checked in. The service was attentive and thoughtful. I even bought delicious bird's nest fruit and brought a lot of extra water. The hotel's bathing water pressure was sufficient and the water drained quickly! There is a swimming pool in the yard, and there are people playing under it at ten o'clock in the evening! It’s not far to walk to the beach! The housekeeper also thoughtfully helped us apply for a late check-out. The hotel is not expensive and the service is beyond five stars!

First of all, the location of this hotel is quite good. It is relatively close to the airport, Sanya Bay Coconut Dream Corridor and the city. It is very convenient to take a taxi to go anywhere. Then the hotel itself has very high-end facilities and equipment, and the greening of the park is very good, beautiful and beautiful. It's quite comfortable to come here for a vacation and go for a walk and bask in the sun. The most noteworthy thing is their housekeeper service. Our housekeeper, Ms. Amy Yang, was very good. The room she arranged for us was very good. She also added WeChat. We can contact her at any time if necessary. This hotel is the first choice for vacation in Sanya Bay

First of all, the service of the ladies at the front desk is very good. They are gentle and warm in their speech. Our housekeeper, Miss Amy, is really good. We are really satisfied with the room arranged for us. The two rooms are right next door. It is very convenient for the family to travel. Moreover, since we have a child who is a bit too big, they very considerately arranged a sofa bed for us. We really can't say enough about the service. Let's talk about another highlight of the hotel, that is, there is a square downstairs with many restaurants. This is something I did not expect. There are many choices for dining and the prices are very reasonable. It is very convenient for our family to take our parents and children out to play. This hotel is still highly recommended in Sanya Bay.

I took a bus to the duty-free shop. We took the bus and went to the children's club, children's pool and adult pool at the beach, and then stayed in the hotel.

If you don’t understand anything, just ask him and you will understand! He told me how far and how long it would take to get to the island. He was very professional! The hotel also has quite a lot of entertainment facilities, including a children's playground and children's swimming pool for children, and the a**osphere at night is also very good!

msg:Service: This is the first time I write a review so seriously, because I have really felt the hotel's meticulous service from the first day. Because it is my first time to take children on a long trip, I compared many hotels in Sanya Bay when booking a hotel. I also stayed in Tiantong before. I have lived in Kangda (very close to Wyndham), so I decided to stay at Wyndham this time with the intention of not bothering my kids and having a simple schedule. Two days before I moved in, my housekeeper, Xiaomai, called me to learn more. The purpose and needs of my trip, and the room was upgraded from Deluxe Sea View to Supreme Sea View for free. When registering the room at the front desk, the front desk staff dispelled all my concerns with a simple answer. I reported my last name, and the front desk immediately assigned my room to After telling me the basic situation, I couldn’t help but reply: You have done such a meticulous job. I only reported my last name and you understood the situation so well. It can be seen that Wyndham’s internal management requirements are meticulous! During the trip, the butler Xiaomai always answered all the questions. He responded quickly and accurately, and solved the problem cleanly and without any sloppiness. It really made people feel safe while traveling! On the morning of my final flight, I even helped arrange a packed breakfast!

Hygiene: Waiters Fu Guojin, Zhou Jianli, and Zheng Caiding, thank you for your careful cleaning and care over the past few days. The room is very tidy, and children's bath towels are specially prepared for the children! The children and family all had a very comfortable stay. When I returned to the room every day and saw your messy data cables neatly stored, I was really glad that I chose Wyndham! I saw the notes you left every day. They were very warm. I checked out at 5:30 this morning. Although I was leaving in a hurry, I took a photo of your notes because I wanted to write your name in the comment. First, I sincerely thank you, and second, I hope that writing down my name can bring you substantial help!
Facilities: The hotel facilities are nothing to say. They are comfortable and clean. There is a heated swimming pool for children. I checked the thermometer and it was 32 degrees, which is quite comfortable. The pool lifeguards are very responsible! Big thumbs up! The children's swimming pool is full of children, and the lifeguards always tighten the safety strings and are almost attentive to especially small children!
Environment: It's very convenient to eat and drink around, and it's also very close to the airport!

Service: This is my first time to experience one-to-one butler service. The butler can handle all the problems you can think of, from making an appoin**ent for pick-up before check-in to consulting on various issues during your stay. They are all very detailed and thoughtful! I must give a big thumbs up to our housekeeper Guo Yingmao👍~ Secondly, let me talk about the sister who took my daughter to play in the playground. My daughter wanted to come every day and checked in every day after staying for five days. Thank you to Miss Lin Xia for her considerate care. My daughter likes it very much. ~ Let’s talk about the little brother next to the swimming pool, but I forgot his name. He had a great time chatting with my daughter, and even picked a coconut from the tree for her to drink. No matter how old he is, he is very friendly ~ In the hotel , you can see smiling and friendly faces everywhere. Living here makes my heart warm and relieves all the pressure from work~

Hygiene: What surprised me was that the person in charge of the hotel would knock on the door gently and ask about hotel accommodation and experience. There was nothing to complain about ~ and the cleaning lady even wrote us a letter after cleaning. I looked at "But The handwriting of “Lovely Love” moved me so much~

Environment: The standard configuration of a five-star hotel. The surrounding food, drink and entertainment are completely satisfying for parents and children. As a mother, I will take advantage of it. If it weren’t for the children, I might not stay in a parent-child hotel. After checking in, I suddenly found that it is suitable for contemporary young people and a good place to decompress!

I really want to think it over and praise it. Now that the work pressure is increasing, the emotional value is provided without any gaps. The whole stay is very comfortable😌

msg:Wyndham Sanya Lihe is the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in in Sanya Bay. I went there for its commercial plaza and large swimming pool! I was not disappointed after checking in. It was very beautiful and the service was very good. The pool guard went to work at 6:30! Very hard! Other hotels are at 9 o'clock! It's open until 10:30 at night, too.
The store also upgraded us to a sea view room! We also had a honeymoon! happy! The room was very clean! My girlfriend and I agreed that whenever we go there in the future, we will stay at the Wyndham Hotel! It’s not procrastination, it’s what I say from my heart, I really feel it! The housekeeper Oswald saw that one of our birthdays was a birthday and he made birthday decorations and a small cake haha. The hotel room is also beautiful! bring
strength! The travel photography provided by the hotel allows me to take photos and produce videos. Especially the photographer’s service is very good. He is very friendly and patient in taking photos. He is serious and great!

msg:A very nice hotel with a very good environment, a lot of green plants, the overall area is clean and tidy, and the environment is relatively quiet.
The housekeeper service was excellent. Before I even checked in, I called to ask about the specific check-in personnel and if they had any special requirements. We brought a baby, and we thoughtfully installed bed surrounds and placed children's supplies.
They also introduced us to which attractions are more interesting. We went to the Tropical Rainforest Park and saw the super beautiful scenery. It was a worthwhile trip.
The baby was sick on the first day, and they very considerately arranged a car to pick her up and take her to the hospital, allowing us to experience family-like service.
The service of the lady in the lobby bar is also very good. I always go to her to fill the baby with hot water.
The breakfast buffet is rich in variety and tastes pretty good.
The view from the room is great, you can see a wide sea view.
Have fun in the large swimming pool downstairs.
The overall experience was great.

The housekeeper had informed me that the pick-up driver would contact me. He was worried that I would be worried, so he sent me the driver’s phone number. When we arrived at the hotel, Vinnie, the housekeeper, knew that we were on a honeymoon trip. When we arrived, the room was actually decorated, and there were mandarin ducks on the bed.

msg:A very pleasant trip to Sanya started at Lihe Wyndham Hotel. It is worthy of being a five-star hotel in Sanya. It has pleasant scenery, convenient travel, complete hotel facilities, sanitation, and safety. The staff greeted each other with smiles and took the initiative to say hello. They felt at home. The housekeeper, Alan, was very enthusiastic. Whenever there was a problem with the accommodation, he would actively coordinate and solve it until he was satisfied. Staying here feels very solid and comfortable. Kind, no worries, such a thoughtful and thoughtful housekeeper made me decisively decide to choose Wyndham Hotel, and I will also recommend my friends. You must stay here when you come to Sanya. What you experience is not only the super-large swimming pool, the Coconut Dream Gallery, the beautiful view of the sea and the delicious food , more meticulous and thoughtful service here

msg:Give this hotel a thumbs up! First of all, the location of the hotel is really great, it is very close to everything, very convenient! Downstairs is the commercial street. It takes two or three minutes to walk out of the hotel elevator. The hotel has a lot of breakfast types! At first I didn't know what to eat first. There are a lot of people eating breakfast, but I also understand that they come out to play during the holidays, but this hotel opens for breakfast until 11 o'clock.
The swimming pool is very big. The park is not bad either. There are many flowers, plants and trees. The service is excellent! The staff are very friendly, especially the little brother Alan. The service is very good and he pays great attention to the needs of the guests. I still recommend this hotel and will come again next time. It is very recommended

The room was neat and orderly, the bed linen was clean and tidy, and the bathroom was also in good condition. The staff cleans and sanitizes every day, giving a sense of comfort and reassurance. If you stay at this hotel with kids, you will love it! The hotel provides a lot of children's activities. They can play all day and interact with other children. My baby met three children in half a day. The children's swimming pool is kept at a constant temperature throughout the year. This is really great, no Worrying about getting sick due to the cold or heat, you can skip other activities if you don’t have time, but you must come to the bubble party at the swimming pool after 5 o’clock, the kind that adults and children are very excited about.

When we arrived at the front desk, we were asked to add the butler Chocolate's WeChat account and send a message to open the hotel community. Time, we stayed for four days and asked if we had any itineraries for the past few days that we needed his help with. He also introduced us to Yalong Bay, Baifu Island and Wuzhizhou Island in Sanya. The room was also arranged to be upgraded, which is just downstairs of the hotel. There are two Coconut Chicken, Dregs and Vinegar restaurants in a plaza. The hotel also has a seafood buffet barbecue by the swimming pool at 6pm every night. There are also many seafood food stalls nearby. When staying at Wyndham, you don’t have to worry about eating. Where to take a taxi? They are also more convenient. Finally, the housekeeper chocolate likes likes [strong][strong][strong][strong]

msg:Three days in Sanya Bay and one day in Haitang Bay
Living in Lihe Wyndham in Sanya Bay, I can really push it
According to the map, it takes a short walk to reach the seaside, but it is only a small road away from the door.
There is no detour, it is actually very convenient
Mainly because the experience is very good
I called a day in advance to confirm the children's supplies.
When we arrived on Saturday, we upgraded the room type. The butler chocolate was really nice. When we checked in, the front desk asked the butler to take us to the room. After introducing the general situation of the hotel and room facilities, the butler added me on WeChat and said that if I have any questions, I can contact him. It is true that he had a lot of troubles in the past two days, and I did feel that the service was very meticulous. This kind of service deserves praise. The hotel provides free airport pick-up, which is really great.
Advantages (1. Downstairs is Lihe Plaza, which is very convenient for eating, drinking and shopping
Directly punch in the coconut chicken and Taiqiong dross vinegar hot pot
2. Children's activities are very rich, basically there are arrangements for every time period. Children's fun
The garden is spacious and tidy
3. It is acceptable to walk to the beach and not far from the Coconut Dream Corridor
But the price/performance ratio is much higher than that at the beach.
Little details. There is laundry detergent in the care bag. I really love it. I have a swim every day.
Swimming, taking a shower, etc. are really useful.
4. Now many hotels offer free travel photos
It’s quite affordable and the shooting process was quite enjoyable.

I arrived at the hotel around 2 o'clock, and I can check in directly. The butler Alan who arranged the service is very good. If I have any questions during the check-in period, I will reply in time, and any problems can be solved as soon as possible.
The hotel didn't have the humidity problem that I was worried about before I checked in. After I checked in, I was more worried. The hotel was cleaned very well and it was not humid. It is also very close to the beach. The beach is 200 meters away. It is very interesting to catch small crabs after 5 pm.
Although the children's activities are simple, there are quite a lot of them, and the staff are also very patient.
Next time you come to Sanya, you can stay here for a few days without the hassle and time-wasting of changing hotels. Strongly recommend

It’s only six or seven kilometers away. It’s very close to Yiheng Night Market! Just three to four hundred meters downstairs is the beach of Sanya Bay! There is also a children's club and a heated children's swimming pool inside the hotel. However, the weather has been cold these days and it is still very cold when you come out of the swimming pool. Overall, it is very good and the location is great!

It was the first time I stayed at Wyndham, the biggest surprise was that everyone inside the staff was very kind, especially the housekeeper Hong Tao, who had a very good attitude, was very enthusiastic and considerate, and would help you solve problems and make arrangements for us He is a very reliable man.

msg:Seeing friends go to Sanya to play, I decided to take my baby to Sanya to play. I originally planned to book a hotel chosen by a friend. After all, she just stayed there and thought it was quite good. When I planned to book it, I checked it again. The bad reviews on Ctrip made me hesitate. Later, I checked Wyndham myself, but it was also bad. The reviews made me hesitate again. My husband saw that I was still undecided, so he helped to read it, and then chose Wyndham. I was a little worried before moving in. The day before check-in, Allen-Guo, the hotel housekeeper, took the initiative to call me, offered to help me upgrade the room type and asked about my check-in requirements in detail, which gave me extra points for favorability.
I checked in on the night of the 15th. The procedures were simple and quick. The room was arranged in A902. I booked an elegant twin room, which is the basic room type of the hotel. I was upgraded to the room type. We are very satisfied with the arranged floor, and we can still see it When it comes to the sea view, the favorability is added.
After entering the room, wow, the room is so big, very very quiet, so quiet that we can't consciously speak softly, which meets our requirements, and the favorability is added.
Tour around, according to our requirements, the room is a non-smoking room, there is no peculiar smell, the space of 68 square meters is large enough, the cleaning is very clean, the bathroom is also quite spacious, the dry and wet are separated, the toiletries are complete, including children's, and the hangers are divided into two species, the quantity is enough. The wifi signal in the room is strong and stable. I slept very well after a night of sleep. The 1.35-meter bed will not be crowded when sleeping with a 5-year-old child. The room is not as noisy as the bad reviews said. It is really very, very quiet. My husband is a light sleeper, so I didn't find it noisy. The bed There is no comment on the product, saying that it is very humid, a good night's sleep, and the favorability is upupup.
Mineral water is provided every day. Seeing that we have children, we specially prepared extra. It is very considerate, and the electric card is not taken away. It ensures that the room is cool no matter what time of the day. On the first day of check-in, there were also complimentary fruits and minibar drinks. We didn’t eat the fruit until we checked out, and it didn’t affect the taste even if we put it in the small refrigerator. It was delicious. The hotel is also connected to a shopping mall with everything you need to eat, drink and play. You can also get a discount with the hotel room card (you need a blue room card, some stores don’t recognize the hotel wristband). The surrounding supporting facilities are also very down-to-earth. We will rent it by ourselves After getting off the small electric donkey, I rode around for a stroll at night, blowing the cool wind, and felt that I had become an authentic Sanya citizen.
Wechat butler for any problems, our Allen-Guo butler responded quickly, provided good service, and dealt with them in a timely manner. In short, I am very satisfied with this stay, exceeding expectations. I will stay again when I bring my parents to Sanya.
I can't help but say a few words, the room is really very quiet. Although it is close to the airport, once the balcony sliding door is closed, I can't really hear the roar of planes taking off and landing. The sound insulation is perfect, and the daily room cleaning is also in place. Cleaning After that, there was a question from the staff. All in all, I was very satisfied with the stay. Thanks to the butler, Allen-Guo. The deposit will be refunded upon check-out.

On the last day, the hotel also had a car to send you to the airport. I will bring my family to stay here next time I have time.

Secondly, the most unbearable thing is that the toilet is facing your head (forgot to take a photo), which is really unlucky. I have stayed in so many hotels and encountered the toilet for the first time. There is no blockage facing the middle of the bed. Please put a movable screen. The toilet, shower and sink are all facing the middle of the bed. The hollow design is really unappetizing. The mattress also creaks and the waiter in the breakfast restaurant also looks like I owe money like a poker face and ask where the things are. I look impatient. The only thing that is okay is the bathtub on the balcony. You can take a bath and watch the sea, but the privacy is not very good.

First of all, the supporting facilities are complete and very user-friendly. The swimming pool is divided into two pools for adults and children. The children's pool is still heated. Children who like to play in the water don’t have to be afraid of the cold water at all. There is Lihe Plaza next to it, which is very convenient to eat and drink, and you don’t have to be afraid of getting stuck. You can basically eat local specialties in Hainan.
Hygiene: The sanitation of the star hotel is very clean, the room service staff is very responsible, and the room is also very clean
Environment: The hotel is very new as a whole. There are two restaurants and a children's playground in the hotel. I have stayed in many hotels. There are too few children's playgrounds. Wyndham's children's playground is relatively large, and game coins are given away!
Service: Wyndham's service is the most worthy of extra points. The day before check-in, the exclusive butler will call to ask about the arrival time and check-in requirements. It is very considerate. My exclusive butler Wang Xinyu is a young man from Tieling, a big city. With a butler, we don’t have to worry about food, clothing, housing and transportation. This young man solved a lot of problems for our family. When we arrived at the hotel, we found that the room had been upgraded for free. He also prepared toiletries and bathrobes for the children, which made us feel happy. Wyndham has warm service! I am very happy to come to Wyndham, next time I come to Sanya, the first choice must be Wyndham!

There are many types and the taste is very good. All of them are CD-ROMs. During the stay, Susie cared and greeted me every day. When I first arrived in Sanya, I got a little cold. Susie specially helped to prepare ginger soup. I really felt the hotel’s intentions The service is really considerate. In short, I am very satisfied with my stay here. I will choose Wyndham Hotel in Sanya in the future.

Checking in was very careful and introduced us to every corner of the hotel. The service after check-in It is also very responsive and quickly resolved. Every time I come to Sanya, I will stay in this hotel. The service is really good. The most surprising thing about this stay is that the lady at the front desk arranged a very good room for me and took the initiative to help me extend the stay. Check out until 2 o'clock. Every young lady at the front desk is very enthusiastic, polite and worthy of praise. This time, the check-in experience is super invincible. The breakfast variety is also very large and delicious. The book bar is really good, very good. It's quiet and tidy. The afternoon tea is super delicious. It's very close to the sea. It's just two intersections away. There are many restaurants downstairs, which are also very convenient. The cinema is really amazing. I had a lot of fun. I'll still choose Wyndham for my next trip. It's really there. It feels like home. Staying in such a good hotel at this price is really worthy of praise👍

The most terrifying thing was that a male waiter came directly into our room at night and I pressed the do not disturb button. I opened the door and came in. I was so frightened that I asked my friend. Normally, two people are required for service staff to enter a guest room. And we, three girls and one boy, walked in directly. It was really scary.

At that time, I drove here from Guangxi with a large family, and I didn't arrive at the hotel until after eleven o'clock in the evening. But on the day of check-in, the hotel thoughtfully arranged for the housekeeper to contact me in advance. And ask carefully if you have any special needs for the elderly with children. It makes me feel very homely. I used to live in Yalong Bay, and many brand hotels did not have this service. At the beginning, I only planned to stay for two nights, and I went to Haitang Bay on the last night, but I felt so good that I stayed for another night! The overall service is remarkable:
1. The room is very clean! There is also a balcony for drying clothes. The overall supporting facilities of the hotel are not bad. In addition, the hotel saw that I brought two children, one 2 years old and one 5 years old. They specially upgraded a room for me. Children's guard rails are carefully arranged on the bed. This is a real surprise to the moms who are away from home! ! ! There is a small refrigerator in the room and drinks are also free.
2. Eating is very convenient. There is a big business around the hotel with various local snacks. Coconut chicken and Qingbuliang and the like. And hotel guests get 15% off! There is a seafood buffet by the pool, and the price is relatively moderate. It is very convenient to take children to eat. Adults can eat while watching children swim and play in the sand. There is also a bubble activity in the afternoon. This can play high son.
3. What I like the most is the children's playground in the hotel. There will be a variety of parent-child handicraft activities for children in the morning. Because my daughter is only two years old. The staff of the Children's Paradise are very attentive and will watch the children carefully. The outdoor slide and sand pool make my daughter want to leave every time she plays.
The hotel is not far from the beach, just ten minutes walk. The butler service made me feel at home from check in to departure. My child was bitten by the beach, and the aunt who cleaned the room immediately sent me toilet water after seeing it! ! I will definitely choose Lihe Wyndham Hotel again next time I come! ! !

msg:1.5-line price, 1-line hotel quality, it is worth staying again.

Let me talk about the disadvantages first:
1. The hotel advertises that it is 200 meters away from the beach, but there is a Muslim cemetery in the straight line, and there are hundreds of meters to the passage to the sea. There are many people and it is recommended to take a taxi. Moreover, the scenery at the first access to the sea is very poor, and there is a sand prevention forest. It is recommended to walk a little longer to Haihong Plaza and in front of Haiyun Hotel, where the normal level of Coconut Dream Corridor is.
2. The noise of the plane taking off is obvious, but it can be greatly alleviated after closing the windows.

advantage:
1. Go downstairs directly, there are many restaurants within zero distance, such as Coconut Chicken, Taiqiong, Pizza Hut, KFC, and there is a California beef noodle seafood noodle that is cheap and delicious.
2. The design of the hotel is grand, top-notch, and the design style is modern. The lobby is very large, and sometimes there are resident singers at night. But the chairs in the public area of the lobby are hard seats, which are not comfortable.
3. The breakfast is delicious, with many varieties and hard dishes, which is above the first-line standard.
4. The swimming pool is not small, but also relatively beautiful, with good playability, with a maximum depth of 1.5 meters.
5. The children's playground is very large.
6. The service is very good. The front desk, lobby reception, and cleaning lady are all good. There are two big and two young people in the family who have many things to do, so they took the initiative to thank the waiter Li Lingying for his care.

The hotel and the Ramada share the infrastructure, but the Ramada is cheaper and can be considered.

Service: No special service, there are pregnant women and elderly people in the same company, no
Felt what was being served.

Environment: You can't see any sea view, it's covered by the two buildings in front, the view is not particularly good, the surrounding area is full of shopkeepers, so be cautious when eating seafood. It's very close to the airport. You can hear obvious noise when you sleep at night. The elderly didn't sleep well.

Facilities: This bed is really sorry for the price of this hotel. It is easy to slide down when you sit on it, and your back hurts when you sleep. In addition, the air conditioner also makes a hu'hu sound. It is too cold when it is turned on, and it is too hot when it is turned off. All in all, except for breakfast, I was quite disappointed. The tickets sent are too far from the hotel, 3 hours back and forth.

Environment: There is a swimming pool for children to play in. It is 300 meters walk from the public beach. There is a commercial street downstairs. Life is convenient, but unfortunately there is no private beach.
Service: The biggest advantage is the service. When you check in, you will be contacted by the housekeeper, and you can also provide baby utensils. From time to time, you also care about whether we have needs. Tianyu has everything they want, the housekeeper never makes a sound, and the cleaning staff only clean up after sunset every day, which is too strong.
In addition, it is not very expensive to eat light meals in the hotel's own restaurant. The price is reasonable and the taste is good. Unfortunately, there is no children's meal on the menu. The children's club on the first floor of the hotel seems to be outsourced and charged. This Yanlord Crown and Tianyu It's all free to play.

During the Spring Festival, there are many guests. They can also provide one-on-one service for each room with the manager WeChat. It is really more attentive. Basically, reasonable requests will be met. Secondly, although the accommodation facilities are not too new, the room is very clean without any smell, and a torch for catching the sea is thoughtfully prepared. Every room should be equipped with a bathtub and a sofa, and it is very pleasant to sit outside and blow the air. It's just that it's relatively close to the airport, and the sound of the plane is relatively loud. Fortunately, the balcony door is relatively soundproof, so it's fine to sleep with it closed. Secondly, the hotel's own swimming pool rides are more popular with children, and parents can lie down and soak up the sun. The hotel buffet is not bad, with a rich variety and a long supply time, and the waiter will remind you to get some more when it is almost over.

The service is also very warm, even better than many super five-star hotels in Yalong Bay. The girls at the front desk and the restaurant are very enthusiastic. The cocktails made by the bartending girl in the lobby are really surprising. The girls in the children's paradise are super patient and accompany the children to do handicrafts. Special thanks to the housekeeper Alan, the service is really thoughtful. Everything I didn't expect can be thought of for me. During the special period of the epidemic with insufficient staff, everything was responded to, and everything could be properly arranged. This kind of hotel service is really very, very good! The hotel is a little distance away from the super-first-line sea view, but even if it is full, it doesn't feel crowded. There are business circles around, which is very convenient and lively. There is resident singing in the lobby at night, and it takes 10 minutes to walk to the beach. The walking distance is the same as that of Haitang Bay, and the sand is also very fine. In short, Wyndham is really worth recommending!

It is very close to the public beach, the sand is soft and you can watch the sunset, which amazed us. Compared with the excellent service, the weakness is that the hardware facilities are indeed slightly poor: the public area is small, the swimming pool is also a bit small and not heated, the wifi is a bit slow, and the breakfast is a bit simple. Overall, the price-performance ratio is super high, and it is highly recommended!

I would like to praise the butler, Xiao Sheng, who is also super nice, with a really good attitude, and he is not impatient at all! This kind of service awareness far exceeds that of other hotels, which is great!

Transportation: The transportation is also very close to the airport, about ten minutes by car. Friends who are catching a plane, don't worry.

Hygiene: When I came here, I found it was very clean. The cleaning staff were serious and responsible. I have observed the hygiene and it was handled well.

Environment: It is very close to the sea, and it is much better than the nearby hotels. There is a swimming pool that is very clean and I like it. It looks very good! I haven't tasted the taste of the restaurant in the business district downstairs haha. Next to it, very convenient!

Service: I want to praise the butler Xiao Sheng! I'm lazy and don't like to write reviews. He is the most responsible hotel practitioner I have ever met, and his service awareness exceeds that of many big brand hotels and other hotels. And the scale is well grasped, giving this hotel a lot of points. If I come again next time, I will recommend it for such a service.

Stayed for three days, very good, hot water is very fast, auntie cleaning is also very clean, little buddies are very enthusiastic!

msg:The first hotel in Sanya chose to stay at Wyndham this time. One is because Wyndham is an old-fashioned hotel. I believe they will not be too bad in terms of quality and service. The second is because Wyndham has stayed in various places before. , The feeling is good, so I chose Wyndham without much effort in choosing a hotel in Sanya Bay. Another one is close to the airport. I just got off the plane, and I want to check in the hotel to rest. If I choose to go to Haitang Bay It takes half a day to take a taxi to the hotel, so I chose Wyndham comprehensively.
The hotel called in advance to let us go to Ramada to check in, because Wyndham Building A is also the check-in lobby and was temporarily requisitioned as a hotel, so Building A is temporarily closed. In fact, I was a little concerned when I heard about the hotel. But the staff said that there will be no contact, so they are relieved.
The little brother at the front desk upgraded us to a suite, but unfortunately forgot to ask the little brother's name. The overall facilities in the room are equipped with Wyndham, and there is no moldy or damp smell in the room. This is very good. The fly in the oin**ent is that the socket does not have a USB port, so it can only be charged in batches when charging, which is a bit troublesome, but it is really not easy to renovate a hotel like this in the early years, so it is recommended that you bring that kind of multi-head charger.
The breakfast is Chinese and Western, and there are not so many varieties, but there are new varieties of stir-fried vegetables every day, and the overall is good.
The dinner in the Chinese restaurant tastes good, more than 200 yuan per person. I don’t know if it’s because of the masks. The western restaurant is not open. I really want to try the buffet dinner in the western restaurant.
There are also many places to eat around the hotel. Because it is in a commercial area, there is no need to worry about places to eat. There are two or three shops that are online celebrity shops, so it is very convenient.
Except for the noise from the main unit of the air conditioner outside on the last night, everything else is quite satisfactory. I contacted the staff and told us to change the room, but it was the last night and there were too many things. , So I turned off the air conditioner and turned on the fan to sleep.
Overall is good, next time I have a chance to live in Wyndham again.

msg:I highly recommend the Wyndham Hotel. I stayed for two days in a row. If there is still time, I would like to stay again. The experience is the best in the three bays. Picture 4 is the sea view from the balcony.
The hotel is really close to the beach, and the hotel has its own swimming pool, which can be used until 11 o'clock in the evening, as well as a children's swimming pool. There is also a large indoor children's playground during the day. There are many children in the swimming pool at night. been staring at the pool.
The front desk is very good. In the off-season, we upgraded the room type for us, and called in the morning to remind us to do nucleic acid. The room was also cleaned very well. When I continued my stay, my aunt helped to fold the clothes that were littered, and added a lot of water, but I didn't finish drinking it. The room has no peculiar smell, it is very spacious, and you can look directly at the sea, so happy.
However, the sea in Sanya Bay is not very suitable for swimming in this season. The sunset is still beautiful, and there are many people taking pictures.

msg:The last stop of the itinerary is the Sanya Bay Wyndham Hotel. First, it is a well-known brand hotel. Second, it is close to the airport. There is no need to go to the airport early the next day. First of all, I would like to thank the lady at the front desk for upgrading the sea view room for us, but what? I still want to raise some questions, hoping to pay more attention to it in the future. There is a musty smell in the room, which is particularly pungent. As an old brand hotel, it should not be. At that time, I wanted to ask the front desk to change the room, but I thought about it later. I didn't say anything about the room until the front desk called to ask me how I was staying at night. The management staff came to check the room and asked me to change the room, but my husband and I didn't want to toss anymore, and what about the room? Also messed up, forget it. The latter solution is to add a dehumidifier and aromatherapy. The air conditioner and fan are turned on to relieve the smell. The small needs raised later are also met in time. In fact, the service is still very good. We upgraded the room, and the problem was actually caused by the hotel's poor maintenance. Sanitation also needs to be improved. The bathtub on the balcony feels like no one has used it for a long time and no one has cleaned it. It is very dirty. (ps: The balcony design is so tasteless, is there really someone who takes a bath without proper privacy protection? Aren’t you afraid of being seen by exposure?) Due to the epidemic, many places to eat have not opened, and the shops next to it are very busy. Little, alas, it seems that the epidemic has hurt Sanya greatly. The hotel is not far from the beach. It is very pleasant to go for a walk by the sea at night and watch the sunset. Generally, I will give 5 stars if there is no major problem in staying in a hotel, but I can't give it this time, but the service of the hotel staff is still very good, and I will try my best to satisfy what can be satisfied. I hope that the problem of damp and moldy in the room can be improved in the future Bar.

The coconut I bought in the lobby turned out to be sour. 3. The hotel bathtub has an external balcony without any shelter. Using the bathtub is a live nude show for others? 4. The sound insulation of the room is poor, you can hear the voices of people outside after 10 o'clock in the evening. 5. The breakfast category is relatively simple. There is bread and fruit when you enter the door. There are very few meats. Steamed buns, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes are all placed in the console. Generally, people of normal height can’t get it. The steamed stuffed bun can be eaten, but I thought it was processed food. The beverages are the products of concentrated liquid and water. The freshly squeezed juice is just a dragon juice, which is much worse than the freshly squeezed juices in other hotels. I feel that this breakfast is similar to the 30 yuan per person in an express hotel, with a little more bread.

The Wyndham Hotel is actually a bit far from the beach, but when the weather is cool in the evening, it is also within an acceptable walking distance to walk slowly with young children. However, the children at home are not obsessed with playing on the beach, and for me, there is no pressure if I don’t stick to the sea.
As far as parent-child travel in Sanya is concerned, what I consider are indoor parks (children play during the day), outdoor amu*****t facilities, especially children's swimming pools (children play at night), convenient eating and shopping (safety), and Wyndham Hotel just meets all of them .
I stayed on the 19th and happened to meet the maintenance of the hotel's children's playground swimming pool, which made me more frustrated. I saw the announcement by the pool that the estimated maintenance time was from 7.19 to 7.31, but the staff said that the normal opening will be earlier than 31. No.
The indoor amu*****t park is very good. There are not many large-scale amu*****t facilities, which will not make the children scream and scream, but the layout is very warm. There are pillows and pillows everywhere, which are very comfortable.
There is a children's theater inside, and the steps are also filled with all kinds of pillows, which are very friendly to introverted and quiet babies, and it is also convenient for children to rest in it when they are tired from playing. Dabao is 8 years old and Xiaobao is 4 years old. Put a phone watch on Dabao and prepare a bottle of water for them at the counter. The old mother can even sneak out to let the wind out for an hour or two, take a walk in the garden, the lobby bar and the building. The Qingbuliang in the Yeyutang in the next shopping mall is very delicious. This is one of the Hainan delicacies that I have longed for. I finally realized the freedom of refreshing and nourishing for a few days, which is very satisfying.
The hotel is located in a small complex, with a shopping mall downstairs, a large supermarket, and several restaurants. I personally tested Ye Xiaoji and Xixi Tea Restaurant, which are all very good, especially Cantonese-style tea restaurants, because there are many restaurants in Sanya. I eat seafood and barbecue, which are not very cold for young children. The red rice vermicelli, rice noodles, and all kinds of noodles in the tea restaurant taste very good, and they are not spicy. My son especially likes to eat them.
In addition, go out from the main entrance of the hotel, turn a corner on the right, and there is a seafood restaurant about 200 meters away. There are detailed buyer reviews and seller's meal for four people on Dianping. You can refer to it and decide for yourself.
Some people may think it is boring to stay in the hotel for three days, and each has their own experience. When I came to Sanya once, I had already traveled to almost all the popular attractions in Sanya by car, and I couldn’t enjoy the exciting marine projects with young children, so for a lazy cancer mother like me, living here On the island, the goal is coconut forest, blue sky, and the sea that can be seen from time to time. Every breath is the sea breeze and the pleasant temperature. Walking around are people from all over the country who come to vacation with a beautiful mood. There are all kinds of tourists. Before going to the amu*****t park, my daughter will tell me expectantly every day that I hope to meet a good friend again today, which is the meaning of vacation.

It can be seen that the overall quality of the staff is very good. The aimee wang of the children's park is very caring for the children, so I must praise it; the housekeeper Xiaosheng is very enthusiastic. Help send it back. All in all a great hotel
If there is a fly in the oin**ent, one is that there is a small hotel away from the beach, and it takes three to five minutes to walk, but the hotel is very convenient to be together with a small commercial center, and it seems to be able to make up for it. There is a high premium; the second is that the business is really good, so it took a long time to clean the room when I checked in, and I waited for a long time. In fact, I don't have much opinion, but I hope that the notification will be more timely after cleaning.

I used to love staying in Yalong Bay, but this time I found that the sea in Yalong Bay is not as good as it used to be. The surprise is that it is next to Wyndham. The sea is very good, and the beach is very fine. My daughter and I found a lot of hermit crabs and small starfish, and we had a lot of fun!

The hotel also sent Qingjiang tonic and fruit. The set menu at the Chinese restaurant downstairs is very affordable and suitable for our small family trip.
All in all, the accommodation is relatively cost-effective, and the staff are friendly and polite. I will recommend it to my friends next time.

Disadvantages: The toilet lid does not have its own power, and when it is opened and closed, it will jingle and jingle to scare people. Water flows out of the shower, and after taking a shower, it flows all over the floor, which is very slippery. This is flawed.
Because it is booked on Ctrip, it is cheaper than the official website, so there is no requirement for the exterior of the room. It is facing the street, and a large piece of Huangtu Mountain is under construction. At 7:30 in the morning, there is only the sound of cars and planes. If you need to sleep late in the morning, don't stay here.
I have lived in every bay in Sanya. If you come to Sanya for the first time, it is recommended to experience Yalong Bay first. Although the hotels in Sanya Bay are not far from the beach, they still have to cross the road.

The room is nice, with beautiful sea view, spacious, clean and well-ventilated. I focused on the drains and drains on the balcony, which are easily overlooked, and the corners were very clean. I especially like the large balcony with a bar, which is the size of a large room. It is very comfortable there whether you are eating, playing cards or just sitting and relaxing. In the parent-child heated swimming pool downstairs, the laughter and laughter of the children make your heart feel soft. Hong Tao, the concierge manager who helped us check in, is the golden key to the highest service standards in the international hotel industry 👍👍👍.
There was a small problem during check-in and we couldn't get into our room for the time being. The hotel first arranged a sea-view king bed room for us to rest and transition. The decoration style of the standard room is newer and more fashionable, and the room is large enough. What's more valuable is that the ventilation is very good, which is particularly attractive in the current special environment.
There is a shopping plaza below the hotel. Starbucks, KFC, Pizza Hut, Tai Qiong, etc. are all open for business. Unfortunately, supermarkets, movie theaters and other facilities are closed due to the epidemic. There are many seafood stalls and snack bars nearby, and it only takes 5 minutes to walk to Coconut Dream Beach. It is very close to the airport, and you can see the airport's tarmac and planes taking off and landing from the corridor of the hotel.

msg:A very cost-effective Wyndham hotel, very close to the airport, within 20 minutes by car, which is very friendly for people who arrive late. The service of the hotel is very good, especially Xiao Guo, the concierge. I contacted the pick-up and drop-off in advance, arranged in place, and also delivered fruit 🍉 The outdoor swimming pool of the hotel, the children like it very much, and go swimming every morning and evening. It is about 200 meters away from the sea, and it is very convenient to go to Yemeng Promenade to eat and see the scenery! It would be better if the hotel food was more abundant.

Therefore, if the friends who have booked the room feel that the room is a bit unsatisfactory, they can apply for an exchange with the front desk.

Service is very good, definitely a five-star
Although the sea view is not the first line, the scenery is also very good
The swimming pool downstairs is very intimate, there will be many children's toys there
It's even better if you rent it.
Satisfying breakfast every morning
A lot of dishes and very friendly
For the elderly, the porridge every morning is a special satisfaction
If you book this room type, there will be free afternoon tea.
The environment is very good, the location is sunny
It will be nice to take pictures~

Finally, a staff member's WeChat is added, and you can contact us if you have any needs.
They also give away fruits every day. By the way, the daily fruit bar is free, and there are many drinks in it.

By the way, the hotel can help call a car
I asked, the price of the chartered car is cheaper than the few we asked on the way.
The key is that this little brother has a super good attitude and is very enthusiastic
Time has extended us a lot, but the price is still the same as the beginning
I will also recommend places to buy fruits and snacks near us.
The little brother surnamed Shan, you can rent his car when you come to live in the future ⊙▽⊙

This bad review will not be deleted for **100,000**! I also want to help you Wyndham to promote your brand image to our various parent-child groups! And the hotel group! ! ! You don't deserve to be a parent-child hotel! Not worthy of 5 stars either!
I take my children to travel about 6 times a year, and the hotels are all parent-child hotels or above 5-star hotels. Due to the epidemic! I don't want to say too much, so I chose this hotel close to the airport! People who are sensitive to smell and have very light sleep quality in this hotel should not stay here! The toilets are all open, and the sewer smells bad. When you wake up in the middle of the night to wash your hands, you will disturb the people who live with you. The key floor is still leaking. Hahaha, you are dying of laughter... Because the bathroom leaks, there is a problem with the floor. When I came out, my son almost missed it when he wrestled To the bed pillow ~ stayed for 3 nights! It's just a nigh**are...
🚗 Transportation: Garbage, 2 roads away from the sea! The 600 yuan room is not as good as the Haiyun Hotel next door at 280 yuan a night! (I stayed at Haiyun Hotel when I was studying. It is cost-effective! The sea is across the road)
🧹 Hygiene: Garbage, what 5 stars? Motel 168 in third- and fourth-tier cities probably. As far as I know, Wyndham is based on parent-child theme! I really didn’t feel where the kiss was, I begged for the kid’s toothbrush the next day, it’s a joke)
🍃Environment: Garbage, you can indeed see the sea! But any sea view room is a residential building at a glance! There are two buildings standing in front of it, and this sea is meaningless. (The room fee of 600 yuan can add 200 yuan to the MGM Hotel in Yalong Bay, which is highly recommended)
🔔 Service: garbage, garbage, garbage. Ask her to change the room for me, saying that the room has already been upgraded and can no longer be upgraded. The room I booked is a closed toilet. If there is no upgrade, the rooms are very rubbish, because all the buildings have the same room type! What is the difference between upgrading and not upgrading. Why do you have no idea about upgrading the room? (Because the hotel itself will become a quarantine hotel)
You can't live in Wyndham in this life! What the hell? ? ? ? Garbage, bah... The only bad review in this life is left at Wyndham. I don't want to see the word Windham in my life!

The Lihe Wyndham is the most recognized and satisfied hotel for our family. It looks very ordinary from the outside, and as soon as we entered the lobby, we were immediately amazed. It was really tall, big, and so beautiful. Special praise; the concierge guys at the hotel, the beautiful girls at the front desk, the chefs and service staff in the restaurant, and the service staff in the room logistics..., everything was done perfectly, perfectly, perfectly.

There is nothing to say about it, but the design is a little unreasonable. There is a range hood and induction cooker on the right side of the door. It seems that no one is using it. The most important thing is in the room. The only mirror is blocked by the sink, and it is very inconvenient. The towel can be placed on the partition under the sink. Although it is definitely not so convenient to take a shower, it feels a bit unsanitary to put it on the railing above the toilet. Wyndham is a lot worse. Even if it is a smaller room, I still prefer another Wyndham. The view from the window is better and it is 100 yuan cheaper. Hahahaha overall it is actually good

Now I have to say that I'm glad for the original decision, the environment is good, the service is good, it's very clean, and it's very convenient to eat~ Very good hotel👍 What moved me in particular was that the surfing leg was scratched, and the hotel also specially sent disinfectant cotton swabs and band-aids, thank you ! And when I left the hotel in a hurry to catch the flight, I left my pants behind. The hotel was even more anxious than me. I didn't see the call until I got off the plane, hahaha, thank you very much! When we came to Sanya, we looked for Wyndham Lihe Hotel, which would be the only hotel we stayed in.

1. After checking in, I found that there was a manicure left by the previous guest on the table next to the mineral water. Because I brought 2 children with me, I had to get up early the next morning to catch a plane, so I was lazy to change rooms;
2. When washing in the evening, I found that the last guest did not replenish the toiletries after checking out, although the contact was sent later; 3. When I went to bed at night, I found that the last guest might have put on a plaster, and the bed had a strong smell of plaster, which affected sleep too much; 4. The mattress needs to be replaced, the middle position is a little sunken, and I have low back pain while sleeping;

There is a cinema in the building, and the large and small swimming pools in the hotel are also very beautiful. The weather is cool and the water experience is not available. The hotel service is awesome. When I checked in at the hotel at 3 o'clock, only one room was clean, and the other two rooms were all ready at 7 o'clock in the evening, but the hotel arranged to send fruit to make up for it. The children had a good time in the playground downstairs. The room attendant The delivery is also very timely. There are many people at breakfast but the food is replenished quickly. It is indeed a Wyndham Hotel 👍👍👍 Since the hotel is very close to the Phoenix Airport, the sound of planes taking off and landing is still a bit affected.

msg:🔔Service: I asked a certain front desk for check-in, but the other party didn't respond to me at all (I don't point out which one). I was very angry at the time, and I thought I would give a bad review right away.
However, afterwards, another front desk saw me waiting for a long time and took the initiative to help me throughout the whole process. The professional quality was very high. I was really probated and let me know that Wyndham could still consider staying again. I saw the name The card is called Zhao Chengsi.

🍃Environment: If it’s a parent-child trip, this is the best choice. I came to Sanya for five days and four nights. The first two days I chose a famous hotel facing the sea. There is no parent-child activities and no playground, so children will be very noisy. If Dem, you can take your children to the amu*****t park, there are movies, parent-child activities, and various facilities for children to play, which is great!

🧹Hygienic: Overall hotel star standards are compounded

🚗 Transportation: Convenient for travel, there is a commercial street downstairs, although it is not big, there are still restaurants and supermarkets, and even a movie theater

Breakfast: great, I think the Wyndham Hotel is better than the Marriott Hotel

We are a family of five, four adults and one baby (12 months). The hotel is suitable for children of all stages. Wyndham is highly recommended for parent-child travel.

The service is also good. The waiter who is doing sanitation will leave me a note to remind me that the sanitation has been cleaned, and the weather is getting colder to wear more clothes and put some more water for us.

It only takes three to five minutes to walk. It’s really great.

When I checked in, the young lady at the front desk helped me upgrade the sea-view room. When I entered the room, I found that it was really facing the sea-view! ! An hour later, I called and asked if the room was full or not, of course I was satisfied~~
The Cantonese-style afternoon tea for two is of great value, and the important thing is that it tastes good.
Don't be too comfortable watching the sunset on the balcony in the evening!
Then the younger brother who is taking pictures will come to the hotel to pick him up, he will guide the action, and will also intimately ask what style he wants to take.
Highly recommended~~

The environment is nothing to say, and the swimming pool is also great. The afternoon tea delivered was delicious, and it would be even better if the drink could be made with fresh juice.
The breakfast is nothing to say, varied and exquisite enough, and plenty of fruits. This is an unforgettable experience for four days and three nights. It should be praised by the Five Elements!

Haha, of course, the hotel environment is still good. The twin room we booked is suitable for three people, and the price is cheap. If possible, you can book a sea-view room. Seeing the sea, we can see a little bit, in short, experience the leverage! Recommend everyone to stay, definitely not a care.

As a result, the two children started the play mode when they arrived at the hotel. They didn’t rest at all. After checking in, they went for a swim because they were I was afraid of being cold in the evening, but the hotel staff said that the children’s pool was constant temperature. It was really warm after a try. It was only after seven o’clock to have dinner. It’s super convenient to eat near the hotel, restaurants, supermarkets and cinemas are all available, and the rooms are also upgraded. In the deluxe ocean view room, the staff at the front desk saw that our two adults had brought two babies. They also suggested that we can live in a twin room, and then they can help us put together the bed. It is really super big, and it will not be crowded at all for four people. , The hotel is not near the sea, it needs to walk a short distance, but fortunately, we got up at 7 o’clock in the morning to see the sea, the dolls had a great time, and it was a pleasant surprise to go back to the hotel for breakfast. There are many types of breakfast, and the desserts taste great The egg tarts have the taste of KFC. I ate five of them in one go. When I was leaving, my daughter was still reluctant to leave the swimming pool. She delayed check-out until two o'clock. She went for an hour of swimming before packing up her things and leaving. When I left Sanya Must go to stay for two more days

msg:This is the first time I visited Sanya, and I am a person who values the comprehensive cost-effectiveness of hotels such as clean and comfortable prices. This time, the experience of booking hotels in Sanya Bay, Yalong Bay, and Dadonghai was very good. Lihe Wyndham took the lead and gave me and my love a great surprise.

🌿Hardware environment and facilities: Like Ctrip's mark, it is real and high-grade, and it is also very clean. I forgot whether the bathroom is TOTO or American Standard. The shower water in the shower room is super easy to use. Although the hotel is not as large as many other hotels along the coast of Yalong Bay, Sanya Bay, the courtyards, swimming pools, restaurants and other design are beautiful and well-maintained. There are several large pots of precious white butterfly orchids outside the western restaurant on the first floor. . It is much better than some large coastal hotels that are old and not well renovated in some years. Although it is close to the airport, the balcony door is very soundproof, which is very praiseworthy.

🌿Service: The comprehensive service is awesome! In particular, the hotel takes the initiative to provide us with 4 bottles of water every day, which is a bonus. In addition, after we arrived the first day, the hotel security and male waiter at the main entrance of the lobby took the initiative to bring us large suitcases... I was going to take the bus in the afternoon, and the waiter met me and my spouse to discuss the location for a long time and took the initiative to give us Give directions and so on... In addition, the housekeeping staff spread the absorbent towels in the shower room on the ground in advance, and we did not order room service but also cleaned up and so on. I forgot a worthless headset in the room, and the hotel also kept it and called me to notify me. This is really a good level of service 👍👍. I really don't understand how some bad reviews come, and those who live in a standard room of 1K～2K for one night may not have this hardware or service.

🌿Dining: The breakfast buffet is delicious, and there are many varieties. I regret that I was a little tired and had breakfast the next day. The afternoon tea served is also delicious.

🌿Travel shooting: One of the biggest surprises of staying at Lihe Wyndham: I have not taken art photos for 20 years, and I rarely take pictures of myself. NS. Therefore, the travel photos sent by major hotels were a "sweet burden" for us from the beginning (laughs), but the photographer, Master Yan, took us great photos with a few easy instructions, except for my fat body. A little bit, no need to retouch the level of wow (the photos posted here are all straight out without retouching). I didn't sell it to us either (it is said that some hotel travel auctions will sell it), and I even gave us beautiful photos on the wedding anniversary day. It's super open, thank you! ❤️❤️

👉👉Small suggestion: The shower shampoo is very easy to use (I find it easy to get oily scalp and dry tails), but the texture of the bottle does not match the grade of the hotel, see if this one can be improved. , Although the flaws are not concealed.
I hope that all my colleagues in the hotel will continue to provide high-quality services to tourists. It is not easy for the epidemic to be too severe. I also hope that some residents will compare their hearts to themselves. Don't give others a negative "death penalty" for one or two minor flaws.

After being bitten by an insect, he gave us grass cream and helped us recommend places to rent a car. I took a convertible at the best price, and we forgot to issue a ticket after we went back. He also specially helped us communicate. I pulled some things at the front desk, and he also specially helped me put them in the room.

Yang Bo at the front desk helped us upgrade our room for free, and gave us a location with a good location on the seventh floor and a particularly high price-performance ratio. The whole stay at the hotel was very pleasant. We originally planned to spend one day, but the experience of staying in was very good, the rooms were good, and the swimming pool could see the sea. The price-performance ratio was high. We ran outside every day and drove one by one. Click to go shopping, I have watched the sunset several times. So I moved from No. 1 to No. 6. Next time you have a chance, go to Sun Bay again~ Thank you very much for having a good stay, and will come again next time.

Thanks to Paul Yang, my little brother at the front desk. After learning about our situation, he patiently helped me coordinate the room, and finally successfully changed to a single room.
After checking out, because I don't have long eyes, and I left the charger in the room, fortunately, there was the enthusiastic help of Xiao Fei, the customer service center of the service center, to contact me in time so that I can get it back.

I was still a bit tangled after booking, but I received a call from Cheng Ni from Wyndham Hotel the day before I traveled, asking about my itinerary, check-in time, and listening The check-in requirements and so on, really moved me very much, and my goodwill for Wyndham grew spontaneously. After staying for three days, the staff on the 12th and 15th floors of the housekeeping depar**ent was very meticulous and attentive, which made me feel like I was at home. After I checked out, I had food left in the refrigerator, and the hotel specifically called me and saved it. I have stayed in many five-star hotels and I really feel that Wyndham's service is still very good! The hotel is located next to the airport and has good supporting facilities. There is a Hualian supermarket for shopping and an international cinema, which is convenient for people staying in the hotel!

It is 200 meters from the seaside and 20 minutes from the airport, and five or six kilometers from the city center. The room is large, the bed is dry and not damp and comfortable, there are welcome fruits, the balcony open-air bathtub is great, remember to bring a swimsuit. All the details used in the room are very considerate, in place, and very clean! The mineral water is also very good, unlike the hotel where I stayed the day before, a large bottle of 10 yuan! Toiletries are particularly easy to use, unlike most hotels, they are simply useless. In addition, in particular, their service is very good, it can be compared with Japan, and all the employees encountered will be very gentle and take the initiative to greet! Especially good. The bath water is very good and relieves fatigue. The restaurant service is very good, the large swimming pool on the first floor, the children's slide, and the breakfast is very good. I stayed here for another night because of my comfort. I have already recommended it to friends who come later, and I will stay here in the future! That's great!

msg:Let me talk about the service first. This one is very well done. Hello, smile, help open the door, and help with luggage. But the lady at the front desk may be in a bad mood that day, so she was not very enthusiastic. Let’s talk about the room. I ordered an elegant sea view. Bed room (don’t choose this, you can’t see the sea from the bathtub, and you can only see a missing piece on the balcony of the station), ask if it can be upgraded for free, the front desk says yes, but on the 3rd floor, the location is not ideal, add 200 per night Ascend to the Supreme. After looking at the room, add 200 to it. On the 15th floor, the floor view is all right. The overall layout and design of the room is a bit problematic. The balcony bathtub is a gimmick (not good for privacy), the switch of the mirror lamp is at the bedside (the main switch cannot be turned off yet, there is a separate switch), and there is no USB port at the bedside (the alarm clock has Interface, but no response after a few minutes of charging), there are no hooks in and out of the bathroom, the space for toiletries is not as big as a palm, and the minibar is not cooling. If you want to go to the beach, please walk 400 meters (you must go to the left when you go to the beach to see Jungang Restaurant. The sign shows 120 meters on the left and 100 meters on the right, but there is no way to go down to the right). The hotel also said that it doesn't want to comment too much on Biao Kangnian. He will come to Sanya for almost 7 days every year. This time I stepped on a small pit.

The check-in experience is very good, and the management's care can be felt everywhere. The hotel facilities and the quality of the staff are among the top five-star hotels at the same price. Park the rented car in the ba*****t parking lot, clean and bright. The hotel staff in the park, including on the floors, will greet guests with a friendly smile, and this is still something that the expensive hotels in Haitang Bay can do. The room facilities are in a good state of maintenance, unlike some hotels where the hardware facilities are broken and are not repaired and maintained in time. There are abundant activity areas, lobby bar, swimming pool, book bar, and children’s play area. The only downside is that when a large team comes over, the lobby will become very noisy in an instant. But there is no way at all.
The receptionist Xiao Li was warm and thoughtful. After checking in, he would call back to his room to check whether he was satisfied with the room.
In short, I have stayed in five-star hotels in Hainan Island, Wyndham Sanya Bay is still very cost-effective.

We were Wyndham who was selected based on Ctrip's rating. Overall, it was excellent value for money! Although it is not a coincidence to encounter rainy days, the children still have fun in the swimming pool! In addition, I would like to thank Miss Wang Xiaoyu in the lobby. We arrived earlier (arrived at 10 o'clock in the morning). She saw me with my child. The deluxe ocean view room was not available, so she upgraded us to the superior ocean view room. Take the room to rest! The room on the top floor is spacious, bright, clean and comfortable, with a great experience. Later, due to personal reasons, I lost my wallet. This time, Miss Wang helped me patiently contact the monitoring room and made many phone calls. Finally, I learned that Uncle Cleaning had picked up the wallet and gave it to the lobby manager. The wallet was lost and recovered. ! I am so grateful to the staff of Wyndham! Next time I go to Sanya, I must live again!

msg:Catch the morning flight the next day and stayed over.
The environment is not bad, the staff has upgraded to a supreme sea view room, and also sent welcome fruits as written on Ctrip. The service is also very considerate.
When booking the room, it was specifically requested not to have a musty smell because I would have a headache. However, there are still some living in, but fortunately, it will not affect the health anymore.
The room is big enough and comfortable, with a good view of the sea view, I like it very much.
The only pain is that the toothbrush that almost didn't kill me, the smell of plastic that was full of plastic that went straight into my nose, I felt that it would be poisoned if I used it. It made me wake up the next morning without brushing my teeth, and I brushed my teeth at hotels in other cities.
Wyndham still made my impression of it greatly reduced, not as good as the B&B in a village in Yangshuo I booked. A hotel with a difference of two yuan and 600 a night, with such bad toiletries...

The hotel’s breakfast buffet is very diverse and delicious. The hotel’s swimming pool is not particularly crowded and more comfortable.
Parking is very convenient, there are many parking spaces, it is very convenient for us to rent a car;
Recommended nearby Dolphin seafood restaurant and small island seafood barbecue, very close to the hotel.
I don’t like dumplings, I like quietness. Those who come to Sanya to relax on vacation strongly recommend staying near Sanya Bay.

The decoration of the hotel meets the five-star standard, and the area is not particularly large. Thanks to Xiao He at the front desk for upgrading us by one level. Although the area to see the sea is not too large, it is better than nothing...
There are also many types of breakfast, and Hunan’s stomach is also satisfied. There are many shops downstairs to choose from, but to be honest, I have stepped on mine for both of them, one Dongbei cuisine and one bibimbap. The hotel gym is also on the first floor. It is not only for hotel guests. Many people go to practice at three o'clock in the afternoon. Will come again next time I have a chance

The hotel is really a good place for locals to relax on weekends. There is a cinema, gym and restaurant downstairs, and Japanese restaurants are also recommended.

If it is not for a special period, it is estimated to double. . Second, the location is convenient. There are Hong Kong-style restaurants, Japanese-style restaurants, various hot pots and other delicacies downstairs, all of which are big brands, and the prices are reasonable. There are plenty of choices, and the hotel’s breakfast is exquisite and delicious. Knowing how satisfied I am, the rhythm of supporting the wall. There are so many delicacies, without such a big belly and time, I look anxious, next time I will find time to stay for a few days and savour it. Third, there is a lot of entertainment. Cinemas and various children's playgrounds are very close to Sanya Bay. Adults and children have a good place to go, not just staying in a daze and visiting scenic spots. There is nothing to say about the environment of the fourth hotel. I would like to thank the young lady at the front desk for upgrading us with the sea view. It is not an ordinary enjoyment to watch the sunset from the balcony. The service is also very enthusiastic and professional. Five-star praise!

When I checked in, I upgraded to a big bed room with sea view, facing the sea view of Sanya Bay, I feel very good. When we checked in, Zhou Jianping, a waiter, accompanied us to the guest room, and then we brought welcome fruits to her. Please leave the phone number and you can find her if you have anything in the future, so considerate! The breakfast at the hotel is also good, especially the homemade yogurt with fresh mango and dragon fruit cubes, which is very delicious and the children love it. The hotel’s swimming pool has a powered floating board that can be rented by scanning the code. It is very interesting. I played yesterday, and the child is going to play again today. The room delivery is also very standard. Children like Wenchang chicken. I like black pepper cowboy bones. The price is not expensive. It is much better than takeaway. I have eaten at the hotel these days. The rooms are clean and clean. The service staff Zhou Jianli, Ma Jiaru and Dong Yatiao provided warm and professional services during the stay, making people feel at home. The renewal has been processed, and I plan to stay for a few more days. Choosing Lihe Wyndham this time is really a pleasant experience!

When I checked in, I saw Sanya Middle School enrolling students at the lobby. I felt full of popularity. The girl at the front desk can smile , I feel very enthusiastic, the arranged room is really good looking at the sea, and the room is large in size, clean and hygienic. Before looking at the pictures, I was afraid that it would not have that effect. It is also close to the beach and there are many foods around. Generally speaking, it is recommended if you choose the Sanya Bay area.

msg:I watched on Ctrip for a long time in advance and found the acclaimed Wyndham Lihe Hotel. Booked for three days first, because I want to try other different types of hotels later. Unexpectedly, I don’t want to change hotels when I live in. I can’t say that this is the best hotel in Sanya. It would be objective. But it is definitely a comfortable and warm hotel for travelers. First of all, it is close to the airport, especially for guests who take the late flight and the early flight. It is very convenient. It will be there in 15 minutes, saving time and energy. Second, the hotel service is very warm and thoughtful. The taxi drove to the door of the hotel, and the waiter immediately came to drive the door to help with the luggage. When we checked in at the front desk, we originally ordered the elegant room. The waiter Wang Xiaoyu took the initiative to upgrade us to the sea-view room and gave us dessert coupons. As soon as I entered the room, the exhaustion and heat were swept away by the coolness. The hotel was plugged in early, and the air-conditioning was turned on to welcome guests. Just a few minutes after arriving in the room, the phone rang. Wang Xiaoyu called to ask if he was satisfied with the room. If he was not satisfied, he could change it. The service is really attentive. Give her a thumbs up 👍. Open the balcony door, the sea is in the distance, and the swimming pool downstairs, the view is very good. The toilet and bathroom have two doors respectively, which do not affect each other. Although the room facilities are not as good as the new hotels, they are very clean and well maintained. The showers in the bathroom are very comfortable and comfortable. The air conditioning is also very good. The sound is not loud, but the wind is full. These check-in details are for tourists who are away from home. Said, very comfortable. The waiters who clean us every day are also very dedicated and thoughtful. Zhang Yicheng, Ma Jiaru, and Ji Yanyan are all dedicated and serious in their services. There may be other unnamed service staff that I haven't seen. Thank you! Third: There are a lot of things to eat around the hotel, KFC, Burger King, grilled fish, stir-fry, Japanese ingredients, everything. There is a supermarket downstairs for easy supply. Fourth: It's very close to the seaside, just a few minutes away, the sand on the beach is very soft and fine. Along the way is the Coconut Dream Corridor, there are many people running and walking here at night, which is very pleasant. In short, everything about Wyndham is just right, and it can be called the king of price-performance ratio. Can't help staying for a few more days. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose here again.

Moreover, we wake up early to wash and will not disturb the children to sleep. The room is also very clean. The bath towels and towels have the fragrance of soap. There are ten bottles of five free welcome drinks in it. They are all popular brands of Wanglaoji coconut milk, etc. We usually know. The hotel’s service is also very good. The only flaw is delivery The afternoon tea and the free children’s playground. The afternoon tea is very rich. There are juices, snacks and fruits. They all look good, but none of them are delicious. (Maybe I’m too picky), since the children’s playground is qualitatively free, it shouldn’t put game consoles like doll catching with charged items in it. That’s a charge in disguise. (Maybe it’s my baby. I’m not sure enough), although it is a gift item, I hope to improve the quality and provide a good service. There is a Chinese restaurant next to the hotel, is it called Weilan or something, the dishes inside are very good, the taste is also good, you can get a 10% discount by staying in the hotel.

msg:This stay was really good. At first I thought about going to Nanshan to worship and which hotel I would stay in. I finally chose this hotel on Ctrip for a long time. The overall feeling is very satisfactory, and the price/performance ratio is super high. Because I am a family of three, I accidentally ordered the wrong exquisite twin room on Ctrip, and did not book the double room. However, when checking in at the hotel front desk, the front desk helped to upgrade the room type for free. I was lucky! ~~ I think there are 15 or 16 floors in the elevator. I upgraded to the 14th floor. From the room, I can see the sea level completely, the scenery is very beautiful, the view is very good, and I can see directly below from the upper floor. The swimming pool is refreshing. Because I went to bye bye on Sunday and came here after get off work on Saturday afternoon. It was a bit late. Fortunately, there was a lot of food in the square of the hotel. I also saw my favorite Burger King. The dinner was successfully settled at Burger King. After the meal, My belly is a little bit braced, so I took my baby to stroll around. I saw the introduction, there is a children’s playground here. I thought of trying it out to see if the door was still open. When I went, I was surprised, the children’s playground was still open. , I took a look at the time specially, it was already 9:40, and asked the staff that it was closed at 10 o’clock. We played with the baby until 10 o’clock. We didn’t pay attention to the time and the staff didn’t urge. Fortunately, I checked my phone, otherwise I might have to delay the staff’s time, although the staff’s attitude is really good; I had a buffet for breakfast. The variety is very rich, and the food is full. There are also many desserts suitable for children. My baby is also very satisfied. It's a pity that this time I am going to Nanshan to worship. I have to go out early. I haven't experienced the swimming pool and dinner buffet. I will definitely come next time! ! ! Looking forward to coming again next time! Ah, there is a book. It looks very beautiful and suitable for filming. I must enjoy such a good hotel next time. I am really satisfied. Forgot to say, the hotel bed is really really super comfortable, I want to buy it myself, ah ah ah ah

msg:Meet an old friend and take the summer baby out to relax. We thought it would be convenient to sleep separately, but the girl at the front desk enthusiastically upgraded us to a sea-view bed when we finally went through. Breakfast is also upgraded to VIP. Downstairs from the guest room is the pool and buffet location, which is very convenient. There is a shuttle bus time to the duty-free shop at the elevator entrance. Convenient for guests who can go to duty-free without driving. There are plenty of underground and ground parking spaces in the hotel, mainly free of charge. The configuration is much better than that of hotels in the mainland. The balcony has a wide sea view. There are many restaurants on the B1 floor of the hotel. Many of them are chain stores. Few Sanya has so many restaurants around the hotel, which shows the large passenger flow. In the evening, the front desk also called us for a return visit, which shows the importance of satisfaction. Paying attention to service will make progress. After reading the contents of the Children's Recreation Center, it is quite suitable to take the baby, but it is a pity that we need to get up early and rush to the next stop. It is the best hotel in Sanya Bay, clean and sanitary, and the interiors are all new. It is recommended, the price is not expensive.

msg:The hotel is relatively close to the airport. I arrived early in the morning on the day of check-in. Thanks to the lobby manager Xiao Guo for the free upgrade of the room specially arranged. You can see the sea view, which is very beautiful. The two-bedroom and one-living room has good soundproofing, and the fruit plate sent is five or six kinds of whole fruits. After eating for two or three days, the mini bar sent ten bottles of drinks. The amount of afternoon tea is also very large. The bathtub in the room is on the balcony. Although it is very large, it is not used at all. You need to wear a swimsuit, otherwise you can see it in the sightseeing elevator of the opposite hotel. The breakfast is pretty good, and the hotel's dinner buffet is also ok. Children's pool 1.2 My girl just can play directly. The dinner set menu in the restaurant on the first floor of Block B is very affordable. The set menu of 268 is three big snacks. I gave the movie theater ticket. The smell in the movie theater is not good. It is probably because there are no people at ordinary times. I watched the movie with a mask all the time. The details also need to be improved: the green tea bags in the room have not been refilled for three days; the breakfast of our room type can go to the restaurant on the M floor, and it was also the third morning that someone told us.
Overall is very good, the beach of Sanya Bay Bialong Bay has less people and fine sand, and the hotel experience is better than that of Long Bay Guest House, it is recommended.

You can put it at the takeaway table and get it yourself. Everyday we go out and have someone to clean it. There are also drinks from the minibar Then it’s even better to add towels and bath towels to the water. It’s better if you can bring your own swimming laps if it is convenient. Because where you need to rent, there is no needle and thread. Very good and comfortable central air-conditioning breakfast is good and very rich. I went for a day trip and packed a few breads. The flight changed the hotel and refunded the lunch or dinner rolls. The flight checked out in the afternoon and it was extended by two hours. Sanya Bay can go for a walk on the beach at night. The day trip site is also quite close. I think it’s very good

Compared with the hotels for a long time, one is the Sheraton in Sanya and the other is Wyndham in Sanya Bay, but based on the evaluation of Sheraton, the hotel is really too old, so I chose Wyndham (the choice is not wrong), at the hotel that arrives at around eleven o'clock in the evening, the baggage at the door will take the initiative to help you drive the door to pick up your luggage and check in at the front desk. The attitude of the young lady at the front desk is very nice and gentle. Helped us to upgrade the room type for free, and also told us where to eat breakfast, where is the children's playground area, and then called a baggage student to take us to the room. The breakfast on the second day and the third day was also very satisfied. The waiters inside were very kind. They would help coax the kids to eat if they didn’t eat well. 😂 If you come next time, I will choose Wyndham. After checking out, I checked into the MGM Hotel in Yalong Bay. The service is obviously not good here. It is estimated that the store is big and there are too many guests, so the service can't keep up.

這家酒店服務100分，從下車的那一刻，每個細節做的很到位，一直有引導辦理入住把行李送到房間。還給介紹了酒店設施，泳池挺大的，可惜去的太晚了都沒有去上。管家主動給送的水果還升級了房型，知道我們第二天要趕飛機，還安排了送機並打包了早餐，非常感謝，下次有機會再見！

設施：電視不能投屏，其他我挺滿意的

衞生：很乾凈

環境：公共區域寬敞，大廳晚上有駐唱，泳池挺大。

服務：管家Freya很不錯，我覺得工作熱情認真負責👍

環境：整體來説還不錯，設施稍有陳舊，酒店位置被面前的樓遮住了一部分海景，勝在性價比吧，適合帶孩子的朋友，樓下就是商場，吃的逛的方便

接機師傅Fei服務也很贊，到機場接待到酒店的過程中很友好和善。


設施：酒店設有獨立泳池，餐吧，音樂吧，房間有獨立的無線網，電視，智能家電，中央空調，設施齊全配套完善。

當然，最值得一提的就是這裏的管家服務了。我入住的那幾天，管家Tony對我的照顧可謂是無微不至。他會提前幫我安排好行程，提供詳細的旅遊指南，還會根據我的需求為我推薦當地美食和購物場所。這種貼心的服務，真是讓人感動不已。

旁邊漁民飯店很多，拉客的三輪車很多，點外賣選擇也很多，過去沙灘要走一段距離，會經過一段回民墓，如果介意的話慎選哦

從亞龍灣到海棠灣再回三亞灣，的確有落差，不過這個價格親子活動和早餐都挺豐富的，性價比也算可以了。

除了他們家的優質服務之外呢，酒店的整體環境和設施也是一級棒。整個酒店配色高端大氣，給人一種非常高貴奢華的感覺。一踏進大堂就讓人覺得特別舒服，濃濃的熱帶氣息撲面而來，彷彿瞬間就穿越到了美麗的海濱城市三亞。房間內部設施可以説是應有盡有，空調、電視、冰箱等等都是現代品質生活必備的東西，而且全部採用高品質的品牌。我還特地去試了試他們家的泳池，真的是無限暢遊深海般的感覺，完全不用擔心水質不夠乾淨或者水温不合適這些問題。

msg:自己一個人去海南玩了下，放棄了海棠灣、亞龍灣這倆很僻靜的地方，選了三亞灣，最初還在幾家酒店中猶豫了下，最後選擇了點評人數最多，好評比例最高的麗禾温德姆，現在想想選擇的真的很棒。

首先，到酒店門口就會有服務生主動幫提行李送到房間；在辦理入住的時候前台幫忙免費升級了海景房（無敵nice，樓層高可以看到海景，也沒有蚊子），入住當天贈送了歡迎水果和綠豆湯，管家Alex也非常熱心的每天詢問入住情況及入住體驗，屬於有求必應型，點贊。

其次，酒店位於三亞灣椰夢長廊中央，步行200m就可以到椰夢長廊啦，酒店的地下二層至地上一層有各種三亞美食，椰子雞、清補涼、糟粕醋應有盡有，還有大型電影院，地理位置非常方便。酒店內部也有自己的泳池，晚上會有歌手駐唱，泳池旁可以進行晚餐，非常棒了，下次如果還來三亞灣還會選擇入住的。

拿外賣要跑很遠到門口，沒有送餐機器人，酒店服務員也不幫忙送，也不讓外賣小哥上來（這個考慮到安全性可以理解）但是服務是沒有做到位的，作為親子酒店，如果正好帶着寶寶睡覺是很不方便的）
另外要説的是早餐，現煮的粉面類不是取號制的，要排隊，然後也不限制數量，看上去排了幾個人其實每個人都有四五碗，光等這個就花了半小時。如果是取號制的就可以先去拿別的完全不浪費時間。另外食物的蓋子全都敞開着，小飛蟲很多，衞生狀況堪憂。

地理位置不錯，離海灘近，樓下是個商場，周邊還有很多餐飲。酒店離機場比較近，但也沒覺得有噪音。房間很大很整潔，各種設施很全面。早餐很棒，每天早上坐在餐廳美美地吃頓早餐開啟一天豐富的行程，特別愜意。
管家Jessica貼心周到，及時安排事項，感謝。

msg:話不多説，直接表揚我的温德姆管家Alex朱威！他真的非常認真負責，也很貼心，事無鉅細。還沒入住就加上我詢問房間需要怎麼佈置，圍欄幾張之類的，入住以後更是對水果補充，雨具提醒，房間清理，物品需要這些都會詢問到我，並且還幫我免費借游泳玩的道具啥的，餐廳出了新品也會給我們房間按人數留並且送到房間，沒有對比就沒有傷害，遇見了這個好管家，我都難以忍受像機器人一樣你問他答的其他管家了。

設施：洗衣機幫了我們大忙，天氣炎熱每天都要洗衣服，真的是解放雙手了，兩個浴室都有了空間來洗漱，而且衣架啥的也都夠用。

環境：酒店總體來説面積不算大，但是麻雀雖小五臟俱全。游泳恆温對小童特別友好，沙池滑滑梯蹦床小童樂園啥的都有。三亞灣温德姆去景點很方便，推薦大家逛景點就住温德姆！

衞生：阿姨每天都幫我們打掃衞生，很乾凈，娃穿襪子跑來跑去，襪子都不算臟，而且衣服都疊的整整齊齊，及時補充需要的物品，出去回來一趟看見房間變乾淨了很舒心。
特別表揚酒店的自助餐，晚餐真的棒，不愧是海鮮大餐，蟹腿很大條！我一開始並沒有覺得温德姆的自助餐有啥出彩的，也就是好吃而已，當我入住了海棠灣酒店以後，才知道價格差不多的情況下，温德姆是多麼讓我想念。
酒店在三亞不算出彩，但是服務人員讓我們這次的旅行舒服很多很多，會再來的，希望温德姆越來越好～

還有就是這家酒店的位置了。比如説去南海觀音啊，天涯海角啊這些地方都很近，非常方便。樓下也有一個商業廣場，有非常多的飯店啊什麼的，星巴克肯德基必勝客都有，大排檔也有很多，反正吃飯是肯定不愁的。大堂吧晚上也有歌手唱歌，氛圍還是不錯的。

環境優美，樓下就有自己的商圈，就餐方便；小童游泳池是恆温的，還有一個室內遊戲場所，不太大，適合幼齡小童，我們家孩子兩歲半就剛剛好；距離海灘有一段距離，得走個3、5分鐘；
管家Allen特別好，是一個很温柔的小夥子，開車特別穩！有問題都能諮詢他，迴應也很快擔心有蟲子，Allen也安排了高層；給長者買的沙灘鞋不合適，退貨結果快遞小哥弄丟了，也幫我們及時的處理，最後酒店還給我們賠付了，這確實沒想到，服務真的挺好的；出發去海棠灣也是Allen幫忙安排的，價格比直接dd打商務車還是低一點，所以我們回程依然選擇了這裏，下次還是得定至尊海景房，房間比較大，適合我們帶娃家庭；

管家Cassie提前一天電話聯繫我，添加樂微信，到店後及時出來迎接，並帶我和媽媽去了房間。
晚上給我們送了入住水果和甜品，真的非常感謝她的服務。
最後一天退房，因為我們晚上航班，給我們延遲下午退房，謝謝。
酒店設施方面，餐飲也是很滿意的，送的中餐兩個人根本吃不完，下次來三亞還會考慮温德姆這家酒店的。

msg:三亞麗禾温德姆酒店真是讓人迷戀啊！這座美麗的度假村就坐落在三亞灣那邊，靠近大海。我可不是吹噓這裡有多好，而是真的是小哥哥Oswald的服務太到位啦！

這是個佔地面積非常寬廣的地方，同時也擁有世界級的設施設備。這裡有超級大的游泳池和一流的健身中心，你可以盡情地享受游泳之樂或在緊張的工作後進行健身體驗。還有，這家酒店的環境真的超棒！我敢説這個酒店的衞生狀況絕對值得信賴，因為我每天都會看到清潔人員來來回回地打掃。你懂的，其實你能看得出他們對於衞生問題的重視程度！

説實話，就在我們住下來沒多久，我就後悔沒有早點定下這個酒店。雖然這裏的價格有點小貴，但是當你躺在柔軟的床上，享受着大海和海景帶來的寧靜時，你就會發現這一切都是值得的。同時，這裏的客房與餐廳也都非常寬敞明亮，而且設計得相當別緻。站在窗前就能看到壯觀的風景，讓人心曠神怡。

msg:麗禾温德姆是大學同學給我推薦的，她每年都要帶娃來三亞玩，説温德姆很適合帶娃，於是這次我和我嫂子一起帶娃來三亞就選擇了温德姆。
入住以後發現自己的選擇太正確了。管家Oswald H提前一天就與我聯繫並且加了微信，讓我有問題隨時聯繫他，並且提前幫我選定了位置視野超級好的樓層房間，還幫忙給床加了圍欄。到達酒店時他已經在大門口迎接，幫忙辦理入住手續，一切都非常順利。並且每天都有親切的問候。退房當日也幫我們延遲到了下午2點半才退房。
酒店最讚的是小童泳池是恆温的，三亞3-4月氣温不算太穩定，有時候風還很冷。游泳特別怕小孩子受涼，但恆温游泳池就解決了這一問題。所以每天白天夜晚都有很多小朋友泡在水裡。特別開心。
温德姆酒店還有一個最大的優勢就是極其方便，酒店內部設施完備，離三亞灣海灘也衹需要步行300米即可。另外由於本身就和麗禾MOHO是一體的，所以樓下週圍飯店特別多，椰子雞、糟粕醋火鍋、清涼補等應有盡有，還有KFC和必勝客，對帶娃的人士來説實在是太省心友好了！所以立刻推薦給了下個月要來三亞的小夥伴，她也立刻就定了。以後來三亞還會帶孩子住麗禾温德姆！

關於這家酒店，我最喜歡的還是他們的小童娛樂設施。這裡有各種各樣的玩具，還有有趣的遊戲活動可以參與，孩子們都玩得不亦樂乎呢。所以無論是帶小孩來度個假，還是年輕人自己來尋求休閑之樂，這裏都是個好去處。
當然，這家酒店也沒忘了滿足成年人的需求，他們在健身房裡提供了一系列的有氧運動器材和重量訓練器械。不用出門，就能享受到專業級別的健身設備，這對於那些愛健康、追求生活品質的朋友來説，絕對是個福音啊！

房間很乾凈，高樓層海景很贊，客房配備的東西很齊全，電視、冰箱、空氣凈化器等等，最主要的是，酒店內部的服務員態度超級好，尤其是我的那位專屬管家Oswald先生，他的服務真的無可挑剔，提前讓管家幫我們把一床大被子換成了兩個單人被，並且加了床圍，到酒店的時候已經全都安排好了，第二天孩子過生日，管家幫我們安排佈置了房間，還送來了現做的生日蛋糕，非常貼心！
整體來説，至尊海景房性價比超高，服務也很好，非常推薦！

msg:酒店管家Oswald服務非常好，因為一個人帶娃旅遊，我衹匆忙留言給管家需要的物品，孩子參加的活動和巴士行程，一切都安排好了。酒店的工作人員都很熱情，對小孩子還很友好。小童樂園有很多小朋友的活動，泳池的水温屬於温熱的不用擔心水太涼激着孩子，園區也很大，早餐種類也很豐富，可能一個人帶娃得到的幫助比較多，感覺服務非常好！酒店周圍娛樂小廣場超市餐飲都很方便，下次還會再光顧！

巴士送機:離機場很近，路程20分鐘就到達了！就是班次較少最後一班14點，返航需要送機服務的親需要注意時間，17點之前的航班可以考慮酒店送機服務！

更為讓人驚喜的是，這家酒店的服務簡直無可挑剔。所謂真正的賓至如歸，我相信應該就是這樣的感覺吧！熱情周到的管家們竭誠為您服務，他們對待每一位客人都如同家人般親切、關心。有個名叫Kenny的管家尤其值得我們讚賞。不僅如此，這家酒店的環境也非常舒適宜人。無論您是想悠閑地度假，還是想要運動健身，這裏都能滿足你的需求。

從踏進酒店的那一刻起，你就彷彿置身於另一個世界中。那裡擁有出色的環境，優雅的設計，和令人印象深刻的設施。而且，還有那種貼心入微卻又親切自然的服務。
在此次旅途中，我有幸邂逅了一位名為 chocolate 的酒店管家。他熱情好客，詳細解答我所有問題，給我帶來了無與倫比的愉悦體驗。
麗禾温德姆酒店地理位置優越，交通十分便利。不論是出行或購物，皆可輕鬆抵達各個景點及商業區。對於認真工作，同時尋找舒適休閑環境的人來説，這裏無疑是理想之選。

衞生：要給打掃房間的工作人員一個好評，很細節，把充電線會收納盤起來。
設施：該有的都有，有些許老舊無礙使用，就是小冰箱不是很涼有待改進。
環境：總體還不錯，對比亞龍灣和海棠灣的酒店是沒有園林景觀的。當然這個價位在這擺着能理解。
服務：這是我想説的，因為我的套餐裏面是包含管家服務的，但自始至終都沒人主動聯繫我提供服務，導致我離店後也沒享受到管家服務。酒店需要跟進。
餐飲：酒店的早餐還行，午餐和晚餐可以點外賣，臨近麗禾廣場，也可以去品嚐網紅椰子雞，糟柏醋火鍋，吃飯還是比較方便
需要吐槽一點的是小孩用的游泳圈是需要額外收費的，按小時計。魚療就是一個池子裏放了一些魚苗挺敷衍的。洗衣服要跑到華美達酒店的樓上洗，很不合理。
總體來説 對得起這個價錢，但服務方面需要重點提升，管理方面有很大短板。酒店緊鄰麗禾廣場，

msg:三亞麗禾温德姆酒店。這家五星級酒店無論是從地理位置還是內部裝潢，都完全符合我們的期望。在這裏，我想特別提到一位名叫Oswald的禮賓管家，他給我留下了非常深刻的印象。讓我們一起來看看這家酒店有哪些亮點吧！
這家酒店坐落在美麗的三亞灣畔，距離海灘不過百步之遙。當您走近酒店時，會感受到它帶來的寧靜與舒適。璀璨奪目的建築和鬱鬱葱葱的熱帶植物相互映襯，不禁讓人心情愉悦。進入酒店後，細心的工作人員總能以微笑和關懷來迎接我。他們不僅舉止得體、富有禮貌，而且總是樂於為客人提供幫助。強烈推薦👍👍👍

説到服務，我覺得麗禾温德姆酒店做得很棒。服務員們熱情洋溢，細心周到，每次需要他們幫忙的時候他們都會快速且妥善地處理。就拿那位名叫Oswald的禮賓管家來説吧，他的服務真的挺好

首先，進入這個酒店給我的感覺就是很高雅、很舒適。這裏的裝修精緻極了，一走進去就讓你心曠神怡。然後，服務方面，Oswald真的是個好管家，他總是笑容滿面地問我需要什麼幫助，而且每次都能完美地滿足我的需求。無論是訂餐廳還是預訂旅遊行程，衹要跟他講一聲，他就會馬上幫我搞定。讓我完全沒有後顧之憂，可以盡情享受大海沙灘和陽光的美好。

特別值得一提的是，他們家還有個超棒的小童樂園呢！有好多好玩的遊戲設備和活動場地，孩子們肯定會喜歡的。而且，這個酒店的地理位置也非常方便。

msg:大家好，我在三亞住了一家超棒的酒店三亞麗禾温德姆。這裏設施全不説，最關鍵的是距離海灘特別近，出門就是大海。我的房務管家叫做Kenny Fu，人超級nice。
要説這家酒店有多貼心呢？舉個例子吧，人家還經常組織各種類型的小童活動，讓孩子們玩得不亦樂乎.
生活配套設施都相當齊全，比如有名的椰夢長廊啊，步行就能到。如果想換換口味，周邊的餐廳和商場都不少，選擇豐富多樣。以後有機會再來

msg:2024年2月14日，我們一家抵達三亞温德姆酒店，準備度過一個愉快的假期。在前台辦理入住的過程中，我們遇到了非常熱心和專業的前台Susie Tang唐小姐。由於我們帶着孩子，唐小姐非常貼心地幫助我們迅速辦理了入住手續，為我們提供了非常便利的服務。

不僅如此，唐小姐注意到有多餘的被褥需求，為我們增加了兩床被子，確保我們在温德姆酒店的夜晚能夠感受到温暖與關懷。這種細心體貼的服務態度，讓我們倍感温馨。

更為難得的是，當唐小姐得知我們家小孩發燒時，她不僅表示了深切的關心，還主動為我們送來了美味的甜品和小玩具，以此慰藉我們焦慮的心情，也讓孩子感受到温德姆酒店一份關愛與快樂。

這樣的服務態度與專業精神，不僅展現了唐小姐個人的優秀品質，更是體現了三亞温德姆酒店一貫的服務理念。我們深感榮幸能夠在這樣一家酒店度過我們的假期，也為我們此次旅行增添了許多美好的回憶。

在此，我謹代表我們全家，向唐小姐及三亞温德姆酒店表示衷心的感謝！希望貴酒店能夠繼續保持這樣的優質服務，為更多的旅客帶來賓至如歸的體驗。

再次感謝，祝願三亞温德姆酒店生意興隆，唐小姐工作順利，身體健康！

msg:這次三亞十天之旅，安排了三個酒店。海棠灣君悦，亞龍灣美高梅，三亞灣麗禾温德姆。前兩個酒店就是那樣，畢竟價位也高，沒太覺得有驚艷的地方。基本上價位和服務成正比。三亞灣是我第一次住，給了我很多驚喜，特別是温德姆酒店，管家特別好，Allen，人很好，聽我有個感冒的孩子，立馬就給安排了房間，並且在高峯期的三亞還給我們升級了海景房。特別好。本來定的是高級房。三亞灣的沙灘特別平，很適合小點的孩子。海棠灣的浪大，適合帶小孩子來。
設施：很好。
衞生：很好，服務員大姐還給放了留言條，很貼心。
環境：很好

服務：很好。
巴士送機一次:很好，司機師傅很熱情，主動幫助拿行李。

這家酒店叫做三亞麗禾温德姆酒店，交通真的非常便利哦！下飛機後打車衹需要二十分鐘左右就能到達。而且它們提供的管家Mark真是特別給力，從入住開始就充滿了熱情與耐心。他總是能及時解答我們的問題，併為我們推薦美食和景點。
此外，酒店本身也非常乾淨舒適。每間客房都配備了先進的設施，從柔軟的床褥到高清電視，樣樣俱全。
總的來説，這是我住過的很棒的酒店之一啦。希望家下次有機會再來體驗一下

再來説説這個酒店的環境，環境我覺得挺好的。綠化做得不錯，有不少花草樹木可以欣賞，而且設計佈局也挺有格調的。而且，因為酒店緊鄰着海灘，所以每天都可以看到大海，心情總是特別舒暢。
最重要的是，酒店的衞生情況做得很好。無論是床單被套還是洗手間什麼的，都感覺非常乾淨整潔，讓人用得放心，住得安心。
總的來説，我對這家叫做三亞麗禾温德姆酒店的地方非常滿意。我想，下次如果你們要去三亞旅遊度假的話，不妨考慮一下這家酒店哦。辛苦各位親們看了那麼多了，希望我的經歷能夠對你們有所幫助哈！

當我走進酒店的大堂，Tony微笑着迎上前來，為我辦理入住手續。他的態度親切，語氣和藹，使我瞬間感受到家一般的温暖。
在三亞的這幾天裏，Tony始終關注着我的需求。無論何時何地，衹要我有任何問題或需要幫助，他都會立刻出現在我的身邊，為我提供周到的服務。
在離開酒店的那天，Tony微笑着送我離開，他的服務讓我倍感感激。回到家中，我時常想起Tony那親切的微笑和熱情的服務。
