msg:I spent 4 nights in this hotel for my 30th wedding anniversary and it was a fantastic choice! Pool villa was very clean and quiet and the food at the restaurant and beach bar were all very nice. I hired photographer to shoot us and the result was very good.     I’d definitely recommend this hotel to others and I’d love to come back here again.

msg:Service exceeded my expectations in so many ways. It is the best service I have ever received in a hotel. We started with an unexpected upgrade, experienced the wonderful private pool  and ended with a late checkout. One example of the amazing hospitality is that when we asked if there were lights in the pool at night, they set up additional lights. I am now planning my next trip back.

msg:Banyan Tree, my home away from home ❤️ This was one of our best trips all because of the incredible facilities and services that Banyan Tree offers. You are treated like royalty from the moment you enter the grounds till even after we left. We forgot 2 items in our villa and the amazing ladies have shipped it back to us. The ladies at the front desk were amazing the buggy drivers were so helpful and the spa was incredible!!! We didn’t get everyone’s names but Acco on reception, Summer and Anna in the spa were some of the kindest hosts. Every staff member we interacted with, was so welcoming, helpful and friendly. Overall Banyan Tree is a 12/10.  The hotel wins for us in all the small details like our welcome gifts, fresh fruit daily, daily pool cleaning and fresh towels and robes.

The one and only feeling I have that isn’t 100% positive is the food prices at the hotel. Just be prepared for expensive food, especially if you want steak.

msg:The location is lovely - ocean on one side and mountains on the other side. Landscaping is beautiful. Our villa was very private with the vegetation. Listening to the birds and seeing butterflies made the experience even better. Mia (reception) was available whenever we had questions/concerns. She was very professional and kind. Whenever we had food delivered, the delivery personnel was always efficient. Housekeeping was friendly and efficient. The spa was enjoyed by my daughter. She had a scrub and a water treatment which she loved. That's why the Banyan Tree is well-known for their lovely spa treatments. The personnel was great. However, they took away the foot treatment which was disappointing. Consider bringing it back. When checking out, Hickey's friendliness and humor ended our experience at the Banyan Tree on a nice note. I wish I had known the villa pool wasn't heated. Though the temperature was nice in December, it was too cold to swim in an unheated pool. The resort's main pool was available though. The outside tub didn't have working lights which prevented a better experience from happening. More care in the maintenance of the villa might be an idea. For example, our pool umbrella had rips in it and the patio pillows were stained. That's an easy fix. Breakfast was nice in the selection of food. I'm not quite sure how to describe the experience at the restaurant. It was assumed that we couldn't speak Chinese (a natural thought since we are foreigners). When my daughter (fluent Chinese-speaker) spoke Chinese, she was conversing nicely with one female server when all of a sudden another one tapped her on the arm to stop when she proceeded to speak to us in English. I'm not sure if she wanted to practice her English or thought my daughter's Chinese was bad. It was an odd experience. The most bizarre thing was when one of the cooks (Louis Gao) acted as a personal butler for a foreign guest. It was disturbing to the rest of us guests in how the foreigner was getting special treatment... even having salt and pepper put into separate dishes. (Salt and pepper shakers were on his table.) The chef was excluding the rest of the resort guests. Why was this foreign man favored? What made him so special? All of us, other foreign guests and Chinese guests, looked at the "show" with a feeling of disappointment. Please treat us all with the same courtesy.

The resort has a lot of nature with wonderful old trees. In the amazing pool area it feels like swimming in a tropical river.

msg:Amazing stay. Truly relaxing. We urge you to get the deluxe villa at the very least to have truly complete privacy and to have that jacuzzi and massage jets - nice after a long day of hiking in the next door luhuitou hill or surfing in dadonghai. 

Unbeatable location. And yet, despite the proximity to everything, its in a secluded bay and once you are inside the compound, you will bask in absolute tranquility.

We also appreciated the small details in the design - the height of the villa plants blocking anyone's sightline from seeing into the bathroom, the burbling brooks, the beach buffeted by an immaculately tended front lawn, the view from the pool into the lagoon with plants all around as if you're looking into your own private rainforest. Each detail seems well thought out and each view from this property is like a painting. 

Our biggest concern was the age of the property as has been pointed out in other reviews. While everything was certainly not immaculate, it wasn't drab either. The age almost gives it a certain lived-in, charming character. And they took good care of the property, with top notch service and warmth from every staff. Cherry took care of us and gave us many small delightful surprises during our stay. She handled every request we have promptly and was instrumental in making our stay truly unforgettable. Thank you so much, Cherry!

msg:Stayed a week and had an awesome time. Lots of space in the villa and the villa pool is by far the best one I had to date considering size and features. Nice also that the property is spacious overall and never feels crowded anywhere. Main pool is basically empty all day. Awesome breakfast with different choices every day. Beach is pretty nice as well and no problem getting a cabana. Happy hour by the beach was ok but a bit repetitive after a while. Improvement suggestion to put a proper clothes drying rack in the rooms. Now we got a normal rack on request and is was ok but should be standard in all rooms. Also the prices at the beach bar are excessive. Now we basically didnt buy anything since it was 58 rmb for a basic beer you pay 3 rmb for in the supermarket. Had it been 30-35 we probably would have bought a couple drinks every day so all in all its a loss for the property. Theres also a pack of geese roaming the property and they get kind of aggressive when you get close. We learned after a while that offense is the best way and they run away but could have been mentioned sice they are pretty big and intimidating birds at first :) Narrowminded people might find some issues in English communication at times but not a problem for us. Last but not least big thanks to the amazing staff, in particular Colin Rao who took great care of us throughout and also to Devin who helped out with a delivery. The entire breakfast staff is a benchmark for other hotels and they did truly a standup job but staff in general a notch up from the other luxury properties we went to here previously, so well done. Banyan Tree is definitely a top choice for our next stay in Sanya, thank you for a great experience!

When the child had a bite on the eyelid, she contacted the person to help check it immediately and provided mosquito repellent stickers and mosquito repellent bracelets. The breakfast and tea break tasted very good, and the travel photography was also very good~ The big sister who helped with the cleaning was also very nice. She helped me apply hot compresses and medicine to the child's eyelids. In short, I was very satisfied~ The children were able to swim freely, but they never dried themselves. Hahahaha. I also did a double spa + the child made candles~ Both adults and children were very satisfied~ High cost performance and good service.

msg:Luckily, the hotel upgraded the room for free. Although it was off-season, the staff was limited, but the service attitude was very good. The hotel environment was really good, and the swimming pool in the room was cleaned every day.

The swimming pool was directly connected to the room, and you could go into the water by opening the door. The newly upgraded zero-gravity smart bed was also very comfortable, and the overall sense of space was very comfortable.

However, it may be because of the off-season that the restaurant lost some points. Whether it was the taste or the selection, it felt like Marriott or even Atour. It was a pity, and there were small insects and flies flying around in the restaurant.

A few other regrettable points:

1. The hair dryer has low wind power. If it can be replaced with Dyson or the same type, the overall experience should be much better.

2. The toilet is not a smart toilet, if anyone cares.

3. The bathtub in this upgraded room is open-air, so it was a bit tricky to use when it rained this time.

4. The sound of the TV in the room is a bit low. I saw that the room has a sound system, but it doesn't seem to be working properly.

msg:The most outstanding thing about Banyan Tree Sanya is the swimming pool. You can jump into the water as soon as you open the door. The water is clean and warm in this season. It is surrounded by green trees, red flowers, bougainvillea and tall banana trees. It is really very comfortable. There is also an outdoor bathtub where you can soak in hot water.
The biggest concern when staying in a hotel is that the air conditioner is cold. In this weather, the air conditioner is not turned on and the air conditioner is not working. One advantage of the Banyan Tree room is that the air conditioners in the bathroom and bedroom are separate. When sleeping, just turn on the air conditioner in the bathroom. It will not be cold. Hot, but not blown away.
Moreover, their service focuses on privacy. If you don't greet them, they will seem to not exist. If you need anything, you can contact them at any time, and your takeaway orders will be delivered to the door of your room. Also, the housekeeper Mia Meimei, who had added WeChat before moving in, sent us back the charging cable we left there. Thank you.

My mother fell and there was no other condolence feedback after asking the front desk when checking out. However, on the same day, I called to inquire about my experience and learned that I had arranged for replenishing anti-slip equipment when I slipped, and ice to reduce swelling was promptly delivered. It is also recommended to have a master control for the lights in the room, and turn off the lights at night until they collapse.
It is recommended that you give instructions when checking in. You didn’t say much when you got the keys. When we went during sunset snack time, we ran out of things. We had to explore the seaside plank road by ourselves, and we didn’t even give them a phone number to call.
But the environment and privacy are the best of all the hotels on this trip. Vehicles are asked to register when entering the hotel. The private beach is fenced off. The plank road in the sunset is so beautiful! The drinks in the room are also the richest. Blue Mountain flavored coffee, brewed Pu'er Oolongjing tea and tea sets, and bagged Chuan Ning are all of top quality. Go to Oita's barbecue bar at the end of the trestle. The price is affordable, the density of people is low, and there is a karaoke equipment next to it!

msg:I still feel unsatisfied after coming to Sanya for the third time🌊
Before the trip, I compared many hotels and finally chose the Banyan Tree, which I favored, because the previous stay experience in Chongqing and Xi'an left a mark of hotel culture that is too difficult to replace🍒🌹🌳🐿️🦐🐸👙💃💅🏻
Let's talk about the facilities, hygiene and hardware services first: Although it is a certain age, I also compared the Westin and Leeds in Haitang Bay, which are very modern. In the end, I chose Banyan Tree because of its spaciousness, privacy, independent garden, and direct access to the swimming pool🏊🏻. The smallest villa is 270 meters. Because I booked two nights in a row, I was upgraded to a villa area with a reception room and a sea view observation deck for free. The 310-meter direct bedroom to the swimming pool made my husband and I very happy. I don't need to wear swimsuits if I'm bored, and it's big enough for children to play together. The water temperature is too pleasant, which is great. Cleaning is done twice a day, and basic needs can be met. Bath towels, bathrobes, and flip-flops 🩴 are provided in a timely manner.
Let's talk about soft services: From the beginning of check-in, they are very considerate. The hotel's shuttle bus and waiters are very nice, and the soft voice makes people feel comfortable. The check-in fruit 🍉🍊🍇🍈🍌 is very fresh and delicious 😋, and there are fruits every day. What I like most is the hotel's incense and essential oils, which really feel refreshing. The quality of tea and coffee in the guest room is very good. On the first day, my husband and I drank tea in the living room while talking about the beauty of life in the music, as if everything was still 👩❤️👨
Finally, let's talk about other services of the hotel: the beach bar 🏖️ has sea swings and water houses (those with financial strength can make an appoin**ent for dinner in the sea water house, which is about 6,000 yuan). My husband and I had a lobster 🦞 barbecue meal for two in the beach bar area. Although it is a little expensive, the scenery and service are worth it. The breakfast is very exquisite, with enough variety. The most noteworthy thing is that it is from 7:00 to 14:00. I am really not afraid of sleeping in, haha. We went to Nanshan and Tianya Haijiao after eating at 11:00 the next morning.
The hotel is located in Dadonghai, surrounded by mountains and water, which is really great. It takes 10 minutes by taxi from the First Market. We bought seafood at the First Market the next night (the last two pictures), and then found an old store to process it. It was only 500 yuan in total, which is really great.
Finally, I still have to praise the overall service of Banyan Tree 👍. I sincerely recommend that friends who understand what you see is what you get and enjoy the current situation must experience it 🫰🫶🏻

msg:It was my first time to Sanya. I looked at hotels for several days and was very confused about which one to choose, because it was a family trip and we needed separate independent spaces to meet our accommodation needs. I booked Banyan Tree with trepidation. To be honest, it was really okay when I looked at the pictures online. It was not like those Internet celebrity hotels that looked very fashionable and chill. In fact, I was too confused. I thought I might as well book three days first and then change hotels, just as a way of traveling. However, after landing and entering the hotel, I felt very quiet and healing. The old money vacation feeling is not comparable to the Internet celebrity hotels. It is just pure enjoyment of your own vacation time. The shuttle bus is also smoother, and you basically don’t need to wait. The hustle and bustle of the city has faded away. The room is very quiet and clean. Although the decoration is indeed a little old, the details are exquisite. It is very addictive to live here. I don’t want to go out every day. I just want to stay in the hotel. I have also visited other hotels. It’s really a different feeling to stay in Banyan Tree. I think other hotels are gimmicks More than the experience, Banyan Tree is non-competitive, quiet and unique. In terms of service, they won't disturb you too much, but they will respond to your requests in time. The staff really puts themselves in the customers' shoes, which is rare in a tourist city like Sanya. The villa is also quite beautiful, just like my previous experience in Southeast Asia. We booked a double room, which is really big and comfortable. There is a balcony upstairs, a balcony and a swimming pool downstairs. The surprise is that there is also a large living room. We usually eat, play cards and watch TV there. It is convenient to buy anything around there. It is close to Dadonghai, and the sea of ​​the hotel is also quiet, where you can enjoy the sunset. Although the breakfast variety is not so dazzling, the advantage is that the time is from 7 am to 2 pm, and you can have lunch together, haha. The juices are freshly cut and squeezed, and the chef is also very friendly and can directly help you make some noodles, fried eggs and the like; I really want to keep it to myself, but such a good hotel should be known by more people.

msg:⭐️Excellent location
🎉The itinerary for this trip to Sanya is Banyan Tree➡️Sun Bay➡️Haitang Bay. The first stop is Banyan Tree, which is close to the city. It takes about 40 minutes by taxi from the airport. You can go to the First Market at night, which takes about 10 minutes by taxi. You can also rent an electric bike in the city to ride and blow the wind.

⭐️Excellent hardware facilities
🎉The most basic guest rooms are single-family villas. The private swimming pool can be directly entered from the room. The room is large and the ceiling is very high. The bed can sleep four people. The two passages in and out of the swimming pool are equipped with towels in advance. The public area is large, including the swimming pool, private beach, Internet celebrity plank road and Internet celebrity punch-in swing are all exclusive to the hotel, and there are rainforest boat fishing, karts and double bicycles and other recreational projects.

⭐️Service makes you feel at home
The duty manager Caesar Gao called one day in advance and added WeChat to ask for precautions. He told me that there were too many trees around the villa and there might be cockroaches. Manager Gao promised to do a good job of disinfecting cockroaches. As expected, I didn't see a single cockroach during my stay. At the same time, he helped to arrange pillows of appropriate hardness in advance and helped to book a floating breakfast. Every service staff in the hotel was very kind and took the initiative to greet. Maybe because there are only 49 villas, the work pressure of the staff may not be great. You can feel the sincerity, enthusiasm, peace and friendliness of every service staff.

This time I went to the seaside trestle to open and the scenery was beautiful. , In addition, Banyan Tree’s breakfast is at Mingyue Restaurant, which is of high quality. I especially like the healthy small salads, which are carefully prepared, healthy and delicious. The hotel’s garden should be the best in Sanya. After all, it is shared with the State Guesthouse.

There is absolutely no sea - the beach is not cleaned. There is no infrastructure outside the hotel. The hotel prices are unreasonably high and the food is not tasty. Hotel for a maximum stay of two days. The view and the area require major renovation, as does the villa itself. After moving from the same Ritz Carlton, of course there is a sense of abandonment and some feeling of old age and unkemptness.

msg:This is my first time to write a review, mainly because Banyan Tree Sanya left a very deep impression on me this time, and I express my feelings. The experience started when I met Mia at the front desk when I checked in. She patiently and meticulously helped me check in. When we needed to change rooms, she patiently helped us arrange room viewings and helped us strive for the best check-in experience. All considerations were very important. thoughtful! When we were checking out yesterday, the children all said in unison: This hotel is so good, I want to stay one more night! So we extended our stay for another day without hesitation. Mia helped us with the procedures as always even though it was a day off. Of course, other staff in the hotel are also very nice, such as the guy at the recreation center and the guy at customer service.

Since I had a baby, I have paid more attention to the hotel's quality, environment and related parent-child programs when choosing a hotel. But after all, these are hardware facilities. What impresses people are some considerate services/people and some warm people. Little things.

When I checked out, I told the front desk that I had to check out to catch a flight, and I had to wait twice. It took 10 minutes for the shuttle bus to arrive. The reason was that there were many people eating breakfast and we had to pick them up. Compared with Atlantis at a similar price, the service was quite different.

The hotel garden design is great. While walking with the children, you can learn about different plants and flowers, and distinguish the poinciana and sour bean trees. Picking up plumeria flowers that have fallen on the ground is a daily necessity, and you can find parent-child happiness in silence.

There are a lot of animal noises during the day and it is very quiet at night. I stayed for two days and did not go to the scenic spots. I stayed in the hotel the whole time, which was a bit boring. I could only spend time at the beach and I played in the room and played table tennis. I would like to praise the housekeeper Xiaobai and other staff. They all provided excellent service and were very polite and made people feel comfortable. They also did not disturb you too much. I told you to celebrate your birthday in advance. Birthday decorations and cakes were also given. The battery car came very quickly. The breakfast was average to that of a five-star hotel, not as delicious as the Banyan Tree Xixi. I recommend the eggs Benedict. I would like to mention a few shortcomings: the swimming pool water in the room is too cold. Moreover, there are trees above. Even if the swimming pool is cleaned diligently, dust and leaves will fall off. Therefore, the swimming pool in a room of more than 300 square meters occupies a large area, but we basically have no use for it. In addition, it is recommended to do more activities, otherwise it will be a bit boring, and Is it possible for the beach bar to open earlier? Otherwise, if you want to go to the beach in the morning and want to eat and drink, it would be better. It would be better if you can drink coconut, eat ice cream and have a BBQ.

However, our family of three valued its privacy and exclusive villa. As soon as you enter the room, you can feel the unique fruity aroma of litsea cubeba, and the private swimming pool in a shaded rainforest environment is very suitable for Chinese tourists who have just arrived in the afternoon but are afraid of the scorching sun on the beach. My daughter and I spent almost the entire afternoon soaking in the refreshing swimming pool, and all the fatigue from the trip disappeared. When you're hungry, it's time for evening tea at the beach bar. You can play with your children in the sea for a while. Couples can also take photos of the unique light and shadow in the evening. The light is soft and super beautiful. When you return to the villa at night, you will be greeted with exclusive essential oil scents and incense every day to help you sleep peacefully. The key is that the service quality of the hotel is excellent, five-star level. The housekeeper Mia thoughtfully arranged all the activities for us. The equipment is all available, so you don't have to worry about forgetting this or that. Most of them are rented for free. Therefore, a boarding suitcase is very convenient for a family of three to travel on weekends. It is especially recommended to avoid the peak season and go on a weekend vacation, it is really worth the money.

The first three hotels were for children, but I chose this one privately for my wife and me. It is quiet. Private, it just buffered us from the hustle and bustle of the previous few days. We quietly watched the sunset on the beach. The children ran on the beach by themselves without fear of losing them. Hahaha. The main reason is that the environment is good and the air feels sweet. I will do it again next time. If you come again, you must feel this tranquility again.

msg:The hotel 🏨 is quiet in the hustle and bustle. The entire 🏨49 villas 🏡 will be stayed during the Spring Festival. It will not be crowded and the privacy is very good. Every employee will greet you warmly and serve with a smile. Attentive service, but the water in the private swimming pool is a bit cold at a temperature of about 20-28 degrees, otherwise it will definitely be more comfortable. I sit on the lounge chair in the yard with a book in the warm afternoon, grateful for the quiet times☺️

msg:1. The cleaning was not timely and not in place. When I asked, I was temporarily transferred from another hotel. They did not do turndown. They only talked about sleep aid rituals. The worst Banyan Tree I have ever stayed at in 2 years. The quality of the night meal was not as good as that of a roadside stall. The fish was steamed too old, the beef tendons were too chewy and the soup was too fishy. 3. When checking in, there were no towels or water at the front desk, which was below the standard of Banyan Tree. 4. The rooms were old, curtains, etc. It doesn't work to block the light, and it can't be pulled up everywhere 5.
Sleeping ritual (different every day): No one cares about sunset refreshments, etc., no one asks. 6. The beach is unique to the hotel, but it is much worse than Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay. It is too dirty. If you come to Sanya for the first time, you will definitely be disappointed and your feet will be scratched. ! ! I don’t recommend hotels in Sanya. There are so many choices for a budget of 10,000 yuan! The only advantage is that it is quiet, but at the same time there are no activities in the hotel. Families with children should choose carefully.

Good service. Since everyone has different requirements for pillows when sleeping, Banyan Tree Sanya Hotel is very considerate and reminds passengers that there are about 6 types of pillows available (such as buckwheat pillows, sponge pillows, curved health pillows, etc.). It was so satisfying. The curved health pillow was provided and I slept very comfortably.

msg:This is the fourth time I have chosen Banyan Tree Sanya. I think this is the most suitable place for a leisure vacation, especially if you bring children. Staying in a pool villa or deluxe pool villa is not only spacious and comfortable, but children's favorite thing is to open the door to the swimming pool. Adults are in a good mood while soaking in the massage pool and watching the children splashing in the water. The afternoon tea a**osphere at Yuerongzhuang is also very pleasant and should not be missed. Afternoon tea beer, white wine, red wine and a variety of drinks and desserts are available at your disposal. The adults sip tea and wine and watch the sunset, while the children play on the lawn or on the beach. It is a bit of a paradise on earth. The service attitude is very good, the service is humane, and they help solve any difficulties. We were worried about not being able to accommodate our children, so we immediately came to add extra beds and quilts. If you need a carry strap to pick up something, it will be delivered immediately. The pool villa we booked also helped us upgrade to a luxury villa. The children liked the little turtle fabric art in the room. The two children fought for one. When the waiter knew it, he immediately added another one and brought it over. From the room to dining to the bar to hailing a taxi on the beach, we are always at your call without missing a moment. You really feel at home. The environment is great, among the greenery, the air is very refreshing. I think Banyan Tree is not to be missed when visiting Sanya for leisure vacation.

Serve:
Banyan Tree is indeed a well-established resort brand, and its service is very good. Both the concierge depar**ent and the recreation depar**ent are very proactive and considerate in providing services!
The beach bar has a self-service afternoon tea every afternoon, and the snacks will be replenished after they are finished.
The rainforest experience is very good! It’s easy to get hooked! Because the previous guest came, we waited a little longer, and both the concierge and the recreation depar**ent presented gifts. I was a little unhappy at first, but the experience was great and the attitude was great. In the end, I was really happy and satisfied!
When I checked out, I felt temporarily uncomfortable, but they quickly arranged attentive service to let me rest for a while.
Thank you very much to Xiao Yuan at the front desk for your introduction, arrangement and service throughout the entire process!


facility:
The state of hotel facilities is relatively traditional, but the hotel is also carefully maintained and decorated.
Personally, I am very afraid of bugs. The maintenance here is relatively good. There may be some floating objects in the swimming pool, but it will circulate once you enter the water, so it will be fine~

environment:
Very private and quiet, very suitable for couples or vacation-type travel who don't want to be disturbed. There are very few people on the beach, and there is an area dedicated to catching the sea.
Yuexiang’s 500-meter internet-famous pier into the sea is perfect for watching the sunset~ It is especially recommended to ride a four-wheeled family bicycle on the pier to experience chasing the sunset🌅

The handsome manager also recommended us nearby places to buy specialties and places to have dinner. Thank you for their timely help in solving some problems. Question ~ I brought my family here for vacation this time, so I want to stay in a villa with better privacy🏡 Banyan Tree is highly recommended! ! ! The environment is very high-end. The hotel's beach is also a private beach and is not shared with other hotels. Perfect! The sunset view is unparalleled and the sunset afternoon tea provided is also great, as shown in the picture ~
There is a lifeguard at the entrance of each building... In the park, you can take a battery car to the hotel lobby, which is very convenient~ The floating afternoon tea of ​​588 yuan is quite cost-effective~ It takes about a quarter of an hour after you book the delivery time and the little brother will deliver it to your door and start arranging the dishes. It’s ready. It’s very romantic and beautiful to shoot. It’s a real hit in the circle of friends. The afternoon tea is also very rich. My favorite is the caviar roll. It’s very delicious. If you don’t want to eat at the pool, you can eat it at the room table. Anyway, it was around 12:00 in the middle of the night. I started eating as if it was dinner, hahahaha

1. This is an all-villa hotel, but there is no butler service. I called in advance to verify the reservation information. I mentioned that it was my birthday and I had booked for four nights. I hoped to arrange a better room type, but I was told that it was impossible to arrange it during the peak season. Well, the row of sea-view villas in front of me cannot be arranged even if they are vacant. It is indeed the peak season.
2. When we arrived at the hotel, there was only one boy at the door, and there was no welcome ceremony because there were really no waiters. The girl at the front desk at check-in was lukewarm throughout the whole process, and she checked in like a robot. When I mentioned that I might have to check out a day earlier due to changes in my itinerary, she bluntly said that there was no refund, and that I would have to pay the full amount even if I didn't stay. Well, I can't understand it. I stayed in this hotel for three days and the occupancy rate may be less than 60%. It seems that refunds cannot be made because I have to make money.
3. The beach in the hotel is very poor. It is full of shells and pebbles. If you look closely, it is basically an artificial beach. There is a circle outside, otherwise it is just a rocky tidal flat, and it is impossible to go into the sea. Later, I couldn't bear it anymore and drove to the Ritz-Carlton, only to realize that the beach in Yalong Bay is the real beach.
4. The hotel facilities and equipment are obviously old, and the service staff just smile on the surface, which is not like the happy feeling of a resort hotel at all. There was no water in the swimming pool in the villa during this weather, it was too cold, and it was facing away from the sun and it was even colder. The fallen leaves in the swimming pool had not been collected for three days.
5. The breakfast was okay. The chef was more enthusiastic than the waiter, but after three days of eating, I really had no choice. After all, there were too few varieties.
6. Anyone can go on the plank road and swings in the sea included in the package. They are simply gimmicks.
7. Generally speaking, it is quite satisfactory, with privacy, poor beach, and rigid service. I do not recommend it and will not choose it again.

Yuexian Banyan Tree turndown gift: I gave the child a small turtle, and I also have a small turtle sandbag at home that was given to me by Banyan Tree Nanjing last year. That son was named Maomao, and this son was named Xiao Maomao.

The sunset is really beautiful. Just for this sunset view, it is worth the price.

My mother and I also had a 120-minute spa. The price was very normal, similar to the price of high-end spas in Nanjing. We do it for 1,500, but there will be a service fee, so it is 1,650/person.

The breakfast is very exquisite, better than that of a five-star hotel🏨.

We stayed for five days and the overall experience was good. The service staff had a very good attitude and the lady at the front desk was also very enthusiastic and almost did it. All requests are answered. The key card is in the form of a key, which is a bit inconvenient. You always have to hold a big one when you go out. There is a little turtle gift from Zeng in the room🎁, which is very cute. There are welcome fruits, all seasonal fruits, very fresh and mini There are also a full range of drinks in the bar (not free), and there are two amenity bags, different for men and women (don't take the amenity bags with you). I booked a swimming pool floating afternoon tea in the room. The taste was average, mainly because it looked good for taking pictures. The hotel also has afternoon tea for free from 5:30-6:30, but I don’t think it tastes good. The hotel has its own private beach and there are few people. The sunset is beautiful. The only shortcoming of the hotel is that the greenery is so good. They are full of small bugs. When I woke up, I had more than 20 bags on my body and it was extremely itchy. Mosquito coils, mosquito repellent patches, and mosquito repellent patches were completely useless. Later I found out that they were not mosquitoes, but called betel nut. , if the baby staying here can bring some insect repellent in advance, it is generally very good, and I will still go there next time.

2. I don’t know if it was because there were few guests and the breakfast was not very rich. In addition, if we wanted to eat at the hotel in the evening, we were told that the kitchen did not prepare meals and we would have to wait for more than an hour. The waiter simply did not recommend that we eat at the hotel.
3. Other services are basically available on call, but the above two points are unacceptable. There are so many hotels in Sanya, and this level has no advantage at all.

msg:The cleanliness of the room was very poor and there was a lot of noise around. One day we all went out for three hours, but when we came back, the room was half clean. The bathroom floor was wet, the glass door of the bathroom was not closed properly, and the cleaning towels were still placed next to the sink. In addition, every time I call Buggy from the room, it takes a long time to come. Also, on the last day, the slippers used in the room were missing and when I asked them to give them back, I found out that there were beach slippers provided. I think a hotel with good service should put them in the room for guests to use from the beginning. It's not given to guests until they take the initiative to ask.

msg:Preface: I was a little nervous before booking the Banyan Tree because the reviews said it was too old. However, after checking in, except for the restaurant which felt old, the rest of the place was in Southeast Asian style and did not look old. It can be seen that care has been taken to maintain it.
1. Overall environment: There are lush green plants. Because it is a full-villa room, there are not many people. Even during dining peaks, there is no need to queue. Almost everyone is swimming in their own room.
2. Service: Excellent! The waiters at the front desk, concierge, and beach bar are all polite and considerate. I called to inquire about my requirements before checking in. After checking in, I ordered various takeaways and the waiter brought them directly to the door of the room. It was also very quick to order a shuttle bus.
3. Activity experience: There are paddle boards, sailing boats, and sea riding experiences. There are not many entertainment facilities, but there is a beautiful tree house! There are activities such as painting coconut shells and making scented candles. You can enjoy a private beach and catch the sea!

Because the overall number of guests is small, the response to any needs is very fast. The front desk calls are answered in seconds every time. Special thanks to Xiao Yuan for helping with many things. Takeaway express delivery can be delivered to the room, which is suitable for people who lie down completely.
The staff are very friendly, including the concierge, restaurant chefs and staff, pool masters, etc. Everyone is very friendly to children. We also made mooncakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival
The beach is a bit poor. You can't go into the sea. There are many broken coral shells, ants and leaves. Children need to pick a place to dig in the sand.
The facilities in the house are just okay. The air conditioner was noisy at first, but it was solved very proactively later and I am very satisfied with the result.

The two-bedroom villa has a huge area, and it is almost impossible to find anyone for three people to live in. The service of the hotel is really super warm. The child has a sprained ankle. The hotel specially arranged wheelchair service, and the steps of the room were covered with wooden boards to facilitate the wheelchair. The room is provided with unlimited mineral water, fruit, and thoughtful small gifts every day. Roses and little turtles are also given on Qixi Festival, which is really touching. The aromatherapy in the room smelled so good that I couldn't resist buying the hotel's aromatherapy lamp and essential oils on the last day. In short, I will definitely come to Banyan Tree next time.

msg:🤣🤣🤣 This little **** actually has a follow-up, it’s really your own fault [shy][shy][shy]

Let me first talk about this *manager’s attitude towards guests. It’s quite funny how varied it is:
Yesterday when I checked out, I asked for a solution, but I was half-hearted. That evening, because the hotel saw the reviews, I called again and begged. It was extremely humble. The hotel refunded the consumption except the room fee to express sincere remorse, and begged not to go to Ctrip again for negative reviews. Already…

In this way, I thought it was okay to laugh about it...

However, the matter is not over yet. I received repeated calls from Banyan Tree Sanya today. I thought to myself that this apology was sincere. Isn’t it enough to do it again? When I got curious, the manager asked: Why hasn't Dianping deleted it yet? (Doesn’t it mean we’re not apologizing...we’ve apologized, so you can’t leave a bad review), completely changed his face again

? ? ? I was so confused at the time that I didn’t know what to say, so I had to ask him to stop harassing me, win more complaints, and then hang up.

This *manager kept saying "taking" guests' things on the phone yesterday, which is a taboo for hotel employees. This employee was immediately fired. So don't you know that harassing guests, asking for positive reviews, or deleting negative reviews is also a taboo for hotels? Are you also going to be fired immediately?

Congratulations on [Fireworks][Fireworks], you have won more negative reviews and complaints for Banyan Tree Sanya. I will continue to complain and negative reviews to Ctrip later, and then email Banyan Tree Group PR/CRM to complain.

Here are a few more points that I didn’t write about last time:

Old facilities:

The facilities in our room were so outdated that I don’t even want to mention them.
The hair dryer is broken, the faucet slides around and the nozzle switch between different sizes in the bathroom is also broken.

Dirty dirty dirty:

The swimming pool in the villa was only cleaned on the day of check-in and not the next day. It was full of leaves, dust and floating objects.

🪳🪳🪳[Horror][Horror][Horror] There are cockroaches in the room! ! ! Take a look at the video of "Xiaoqiang🪳 is at the scene" below (I can only post one video, and I can only post screenshots of the video). Have you ever stayed in a "luxury" hotel where there were cockroaches in the guest rooms? I'm afraid I haven't seen it even in budget hotels.

I’ll write these first as I’m about to take off, and continue after I land.

------------Dividing line------------
The following is the first negative review I wrote when I checked out of the hotel.

🤬🤬🤬I would like to remind everyone to pay attention to hygiene and property safety when staying at Banyan Tree Sanya. The hotel employees have unclean hands and feet, and their hesitant attitude in handling complaints to the hotel is ridiculous. Complain to front desk Yu Meng, manager on duty***

This is the first time I stayed at a Banyan Tree hotel that was so bad. The previous hotel had poor service. This one is amazing.

🤬🤬🤬The hotel’s private beach is extremely dirty, not to mention smelly fish and rotten shrimps, but also empty bottles, garbage and condoms! Other hotels have cleaners cleaning the beach every day, but here garbage is piled up every day!

🤬🤬🤬What’s even more outrageous is that things will be lost in the room! The hotel waiter's hands and feet are unclean

The swimming goggles placed by the villa's own pool were stolen. Three pairs of swimming goggles were stolen. I chose the best pair and complained to the front desk when checking out. Then magically, I found it and it appeared in the room at that moment! !

🤬🤬🤬What’s even more ridiculous is that the charger was stolen. The butler’s magical explanation was that the waiter took it and put it in someone else’s room? What is the logic? The personal items in this room were taken by the waiter to someone else's room by mistake? Shouldn't this waiter be fired immediately? Do you think it makes sense when you say it to yourself?

Continuing to be ridiculous: I asked the hotel to pick it up right away, but they actually told me that the guests in this room were resting and couldn’t be disturbed, so they couldn’t bring it back. They wanted to buy me a new one, but the Apple store wasn’t open. They took out a shabby old charger and said, “Please do it first.” Use it. ? ? ? In order not to affect the rest of a guest who "took" someone else's things, but instead delayed the guest who "got" something, what kind of hospitality is this?

Moreover, I asked the hotel to investigate this matter yesterday, and until check-out at 10 o'clock today, the hotel was hesitating without any explanation. What kind of efficiency is this? Is this Banyan Tree's code of conduct to remain silent and unresponsive when asked? Complain to front desk Yu Meng, the manager on duty ***. What the manager on duty said was very ironic. He said that hotel employees would not steal. If they wanted to steal, they would steal valuable things. Hahahaha. If you have valuable things, call the police. Check the surveillance. Police cars come and go at the entrance of Banyan Tree every day. ? I just want to steal worthless things, thinking that the customers won't care, so I can take advantage of them!

I wasted half an hour at the front desk dealing with this matter when checking out. It almost delayed me✈️. I will write it down here first and wait for the negative review on Ctrip booking page.

It is different from the regular assembly line service. You can really feel at home, and The Internet celebrity trestle is on the beach of the hotel, and there is also a free afternoon tea break by the sea. There are few people and quiet, especially suitable for us who like to stay in hotels😊

Because the plane was late and I arrived late, I was upgraded to a sea view villa for free. It was really a pleasant surprise! ! The viewing platform of the sea view villa has a wide view, and the large swimming pool is accompanied by a charming sea view! It's so comfortable!

I have been to Sanya many times and stayed in many hotels. Both adults and children feel that the experience of staying at Banyan Tree is the best.
Before we check in, the hotel will call in advance to confirm whether there are children, whether we need to prepare children's toiletries and slippers, etc. The service attitude of the hotel's battery car is very good every time.
Sunset time tea: you can eat tea and watch the beautiful sunset

msg:The waiters at Banyan Tree were very attentive, and the breakfast and dinner were delicious. However, the hotel has not had major renovations (rooms, restaurants) since it opened in 2008. As soon as I entered the room (although it was a villa style), I felt very uncomfortable and the Banyan Tree brand Starting from Thailand, the spa is very famous. Although the three technicians did a good job, we did not go back the second night because of the poor facilities such as the room.

No matter how good the service of Sanya Banyan Tree is, Sanya Banyan Tree is still the worst among the many Banyan Trees I have been to abroad and in the Mainland. I will not come back to this Sanya store again.

Banyan Tree in Lijiang, Yunnan is also a villa style but offers super five-star enjoyment.
Sana Banyan Tree prices are based on international five-star charges, but you can enjoy the enjoyment of three-star hotels in the mainland.

msg:The last stop of this trip to Sanya is Banyan Tree Sanya.
Mr. Yue, the housekeeper, communicated with us in advance before check-in, and arranged the children's facilities for us after learning that there were children traveling with us: children's bed rails, children's slippers, children's bathrobes, children's pillows and toiletries. They also thoughtfully prepared all kinds of mosquito repellent and anti-mosquito products and a whole box of mineral water for us.
The overall facilities of the hotel are a bit old, but it can still be seen that the quality is still very good.
The service staff are enthusiastic and professional. Even if we don't understand the dialect, we can still feel the simple and unpretentious enthusiasm from the smile on the face of each employee.
I like the tranquility and coziness of Banyan Tree the most, which is not comparable to other Internet celebrity hotels. The four-night and five-day trip to Banyan Tree made us feel as if we had come to a paradise.
The hotel's nightly turndown service includes: small gifts (received necklaces, small sailboats, little turtle dolls), and small snacks or fruits. Make the bed and the room, adjust the temperature and brightness of the lights in the room. The service is professional, meticulous and considerate.
Special thanks to all the staff of Mingyue Restaurant, especially the two chefs: Mr. Zhang and Mr. Gao. The two chefs are humorous, enthusiastic and professional. Seeing that my daughter was bitten by a mosquito, I also specially took essential oil. The meticulous and patient service left us with good memories.

msg:Banyan Tree Sanya is the best hotel in my trip to Sanya. The advantage is that the single-family villa with swimming pool is very private and quiet. It is very suitable for couples or small families to vacation. The waiters are very polite and the breakfast is also very Hainanese. You can order takeout and have it delivered to your room. Although the seawater beach of Sanya Bay is not as good as Yalong Bay, the location allows you to see a particularly beautiful sunset. The hotel also arranged a sunset party at 6 p.m. with free drinks and food, which is really thoughtful. The only drawback I feel is that the hotel was built relatively early and many facilities are older, but the design is perfect!

msg:This is a small essay with feelings. Why do you want to come to Sanya? I am fed up with the impetuousness and crowding of the coastal manufacturing cities, and the locals, especially the local taxi drivers and takeaways, make people PUA. Sanya Luhuitou Banyan Tree, although the Hotel crew has a service attitude supported by tourist cities and ticket thresholds, anyway, from ordinary storage staff to hotel administrative staff, they all greet with smiles and actively provide consultation and help. Frankly speaking, in some eastern regions In many cases, coastal manufacturing cities are not a problem of enough money. Advantages: Quiet, private swimming pool, especially suitable for a family, especially a mattress and pillows with excellent softness and firmness that can make people fall asleep quickly. The overall feeling is like a private plot found in a tropical rainforest. 1km next to it is the Luhuitou Scenic Area, where you can have a bird's-eye view of Sanya Bay. Disadvantages: The facilities are a bit outdated, and there are not many entertainment experience items. The experience of looking for the online celebrity store in Haitang Bay may be in the wrong place. Conclusion: Choosing a hotel in Sanya is to choose what you need. Finally, I would like to thank Naomi and Spencer at the front desk for their thoughtfulness Taking care, although everyone is working part-time, but the enthusiasm can be seen from the heart, and they understand everything. I wish you a happy life, and hope that the hotel owner can give these two (maybe all) salary increases, vacation rewards, etc. after seeing this comment. I wish all crew of Banyan Tree happy every day!

The hotel waiters have no sense of service at all. Having afternoon tea at the sunset bar to watch the sunset, the waiters even blocked the car directly in front of them! It was 9:30 in the evening, and I went to bed. I called and asked if I wanted to turn down the bed. I was also speechless! I really don't recommend it, you can choose other hotels at the same price, and I will never choose Banyan Tree again! Goodbye!

msg:The most expensive hotel I booked in Sanya, but it was really disappointing.
advantage:
1. The room is a pool villa with high privacy;
2. The sunset sea view is beautiful;

shortcoming:
1. The cleanliness of the room is worrying. On the first day of check-in, a giant cockroach was found in the room, the size of half a finger. This hotel has cockroaches, which is too unexpected;
2. The room facilities are old, very old and smelly;
3. The service is average, and the service personnel are not professional enough. Some staff wander around the public area of ​​the hotel and make calls
4. The sunset tea served in the room is too perfunctory. There are only a few low-quality cakes and cocktails with pigment flavors. It is not a star and a half worse than the executive lounge of Grand Hyatt.
5. The ingredients for breakfast are not as good as those of Grand Hyatt. The chef of Gu Restaurant said that he is unwilling to buy more expensive ingredients, but the room rate is 3000 per night
6. The beach can catch the sea, but it cannot enter the water. It is full of mud and dirty, and it is not comparable to Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay.
7. The soft drinks in the minibar are charged, and all other hotels are free;
8. The pre-authorization of 1.7 times the room rate is paid, and other hotels do not need it.

The overall disadvantages outweigh the advantages, especially the cockroaches, which are really unacceptable. The front desk of the hotel said that there are inevitably cockroaches in garden-style hotels, and they will not come again.

The only thing that is not perfect is that the decoration is indeed a bit old, especially compared with the new online celebrity hotels, but it is quite old-fashioned. If you are tired of staying in the same online celebrity hotels, Banyan Tree is totally worth a try!

As soon as you enter the door, you will be attracted by the big swimming pool in front of you.
When I woke up the next day, the sun was shining and the whole environment was very good

Environment: There are a lot of green plants, and there will be birds calling to wake up in the morning
There are more garden designs, as well as a children's playground and an outdoor promenade-style swimming pool
I saw the boat and wanted to experience the rush of time

Service: The overall service is very good, especially Mr. Xiao Guo at the front desk. He called one day in advance to ask what time to check in. He even upgraded the high-end villa for free when he arrived. Thank you~

Breakfast is so-so, hope it can be improved

msg:The fourth Banyan Tree hotel in China, the environment is very quiet. I think the location of each Banyan Tree is very unique. Even if all the 49 villas are full, there are only about 100 people. It is very private and suitable for couples. On vacation, because there are fewer people, the service can keep up. Unlike other luxury hotels with many rooms, even if there is service, everyone may not be able to take care of it. This time I booked a retreat villa, and the housekeeper Cherry upgraded the seaside villa , it is closer to the hotel's private beach, and overall I am very satisfied. I originally planned to take a two-day break and change to another hotel, so I continued to stay.

The room is much bigger. There is a living room and a jacuzzi facility. There is no way to do this, but the service makes up for it. this point

Sunset time refreshment: The hotel has free afternoon tea from 5:30 to 6:30 every afternoon. Facing the sea and facing the sunset, it still has a special flavor

Enjoy the 500-meter Internet celebrity trestle into the sea: the trestle was closed at the time we went, so we didn't go there

Overall, it was a good experience. I have stayed in Banyan Tree in many places. This one is a bit quiet, not far from the downtown area and scenic spots. It is very good to be alone at the end of the road.

msg:I have lived in several Banyan Trees at home and abroad. The brand’s intentional service is definitely no problem. It has never disappointed me. Even though the facilities are a bit old, they are well maintained and very caring. The housekeeper we stayed at this time The younger sister, Manley, is really kind. She took care of us in every detail, and she still greeted us with concern after leaving the store. As long as I live in Dadonghai, I will definitely come to Banyan Tree in the future!

Give Naomi a manual thumbs up 👍 Contact Naomi in advance to inform the epidemic prevention policy before departure and arrange pick-up
When I arrived at the hotel, Naomi’s enthusiastic service every day was so heartwarming. I can only describe it as "too satisfied" these days. I have prepared baby products, cribs, birthday decorations and cakes. If you have any needs and questions every day, you can get responses and help at any time. All the staff are so gentle
I haven't traveled for two or three years, and I'm finally on vacation la la la la

She can help me solve them in time and remind me of the time of various activities. Because I arrived early, the hotel room was not ready, so I had to wait in the lobby. Nicole was very patient and kept chatting with me. I was afraid that I would be bored waiting in the lobby alone. Violet explained the hotel's facilities to me along the way, and also took me around to let me appreciate the hotel's environment. And Miss Xiaomei from Sunset Bar, came to confirm breakfast with me. I was afraid that I would be hungry, so I ordered a few breakfasts for me. Unfortunately, I overestimated my strength and wasted a lot of Miss Xiaomei’s heart. In short I had a very pleasant stay at Banyan Tree this time, and I was very happy. I will definitely stay here again next time I go.

Now the epidemic can't go out, I can only experience it on the domestic island, and I am not disappointed, or only the Banyan Tree on the island can improve worthy of this brand. Strong privacy, Southeast Asian style design, each villa has an independent swimming pool, especially not too comfortable for us with children. I spent all four days in the hotel and didn’t want to go out. The best experience this time was the butler service. The handsome man Yue at the front desk, from check-in to check-out for four days and three nights, the service was so perfect, just for this service, let us Continued stay. Knowing that we are bringing a baby, we can directly upgrade to a parent-child villa for free. The whole process is also a car pick-up to meet our various needs. This service is comparable to the Banyan Tree in the overseas islands of the United States. After all, those foreign brothers will not take you unless they tip play haha! The hotel's lunch and dinner are good, the taste is first-class, except for the restaurant's decoration style is a bit lacking.... Everything else is impeccable. The sweet orange aroma in the room is very comfortable, making people return to Bali at once. The hotel is small to the door reception, restaurant waiter,

msg:I have been planting Banyan Tree in Sanya for a long time, and this time I hit the card no matter what. The decoration design is still in the Southeast Asian style many years ago, but the materials and supplies used are very high-end. The Duravit in the bathroom and the old furniture are all mahogany, which is worthy of this brand. The service is first-rate. The lady at the front desk, Nicole, did not sit behind the desk, but squatted on the ground at your resting place and asked you to sign and swipe the card. The handsome guy who drove the battery car specially took us to the hotel before sending the room. After making a big circle and introducing them one by one, one of the luggage rivets fell off, and the master from the engineering depar**ent soon came to repair it. The daily beach afternoon tea is free. Although it is very simple, it is better to enjoy the beautiful sunset when the beach is facing the west. The beach in Banyan is the best place to enjoy the sunset in Sanya. The swing of net celebrities and the trestle reaching the center of the sea are particularly dazzling against the background of the sky full of colorful clouds.

As the earliest luxury brand hotel in Sanya, Banyan Tree has only 39 villas, which are hidden in 130,000 square meters of various tropical plants. Privacy is greatly guaranteed. The service is very attentive. The aunt who is responsible for hygiene said that the mineral water in the room is not enough to drink, and she immediately sent a lot of water. The water quality of the swimming pool in the room is excellent, and the housekeeper Nicole also thoughtfully sent a swimming ring. The turndown service features Banyan Tree's classic little turtles. The bathroom is large and has a double basin configuration, and there is a surfing pool in the backyard.

The breakfast at the hotel is very good. Although there are not too many varieties, the ingredients are of good quality. Serving time from 7:00 – 11:00, see smoked salmon and more. Since the hotel is only full, there are only about 100 people, so the waiters in the restaurant can better serve the guests. The chef is of a high level, and will ask the guests if they have taboos and whether they are satisfied. The Hainanese special chee cheong fun and Zhapo vinegar are particularly authentic, but the taste is more delicious than the stalls in the market. It's arguably better than any hotel experience I've stayed in in Sanya.
  The public swimming pool of the hotel is also a wide circular swimming lane with a length of 260 meters. It walks through the tropical plant garden and the water quality is very clean. During the day, the roasting sun shines through the leaves, and the dappled light and shadow are projected onto the swimming pool. It will not feel boring to swim a few laps in this changing greenery.

It coincides with the hotel lawn BBQ on the weekend. The dishes are good and the taste is very good. The ice cream is delicious and the coconut can be supplied unlimitedly, and the price is not cheap. But the sunset afterglow as the background is also worth the price.

The housekeeper, Liu Li, contacted and communicated about check-in matters one day in advance, and thoughtfully changed to a more suitable room. During the 5-day stay, everything from food, hotel play, spa reservation, yacht reservation, nucleic acid test, etc. All aspects of enthusiasm and initiative to help, especially during the typhoon and rain to upgrade the room type, very nice! During the typhoon, it can be seen that the hotel's emergency management capabilities are quite good. The concierge, front desk, guest rooms, catering, cleaning and other depar**ents have a strong autonomy to work together, and the order and environment are quickly restored, ensuring a good experience for guests. Special thanks to the restaurant manager for helping with luggage in the heavy rain, coordinating meal delays for guests in bad weather 👍👍
The beach of the hotel is not big, but a few small furnishings such as sailboats and swings are very a**ospheric. Every afternoon on the HappyHour lawn of the beach bar, you can feel the setting sun, and the tree house at night is quite impressive.
The breakfast is exquisite and excellent. For a resort hotel with only 49 villas, it is really unnecessary to match other hotels in terms of variety and size. The dishes are very distinctive, and the quality and taste are quite guaranteed. The staff in the restaurant depar**ent are also willing to communicate with guests.

The layout and garden design of the hotel are not backward due to the positioning for so many years. Instead, they highlight the heritage. It is a rare relaxation to walk around.
SPA is the signature of Banyan Tree. Each Banyan Tree has a different theme and has a different SPA experience. But this time, for some unknown reason, I was allergic to it the next day, which is embarrassing 😅
The 500-meter trestle bridge not far from the beach is also worth walking. Looking at the silhouettes of the small sea on both sides under the sunset, the warm feeling comes to my heart.
The rainstorm is also unexpectedly fun. There are large and small fish schools on the road of the hotel. It is quite rare to see the fish schools on the road 😯
Unfortunately, due to the typhoon, I was unable to go to the sea in front of the door to play yacht projects this time, so let's save it for the next time.
A sure meeting, a rare time, see you next time

When checking in, I met Jasmyn Liu, who was very nice. The whole check-in was very smooth. Jasmyn was very professional and efficient. He also introduced us to the various facilities of the hotel. Check-in was done, and we arranged a lawn picnic for us, and also very considerately helped us arrange a courtesy car to the designated location. The breakfast meal was also very pleasant. Chef Louis Gao was very enthusiastic about introducing us to the hotel's meals and local delicacies. The breakfast products were also very good. The sunset at Banyan Tree Sanya is simply too beautiful to capture the wonderful moment. The trestle into the sea is also very beautiful. The staff of the entire Banyan Tree Hotel are very polite and will take the initiative to say hello when they see guests. Thanks to Jasmyn and Banyan Tree for giving us a perfect holiday experience, will definitely come back and recommend to colleagues and friends! ! !

1. On the tree-lined path in the hotel, if the staff is driving the car, they will give way to pedestrians first before driving
2. I ran into a staff member talking with foreign friends at the entrance of the lobby, who was very polite
3. Ms. Jasmyn is very caring and helped my family suddenly 🐑 get an extra free half-day rest time
4. I was taken aback by a little meow that strayed into the garden in the middle of the night. The meow at night is really not as cute as during the day
5. Even if there is a takeaway, it will be sent to the room thoughtfully, but once I forgot to inform that it has been delivered, I have a little complaint
6. The facilities of old hotels do have old and insufficient places, and they pay more for the service
Overall very good
Thank you hotel for the excellent service. It would be better if the facilities could be updated.

Over the years, I have been to the Magnificent Mandarin Oriental in the Capella EDITION in Sanya, and I feel that this one can be ranked first. More than 200 square meters (maybe bigger) villa, private swimming pool, jacuzzi, and separate living room, private and quiet, very comfortable! In addition, hotels in Sanya either have good rooms and good public areas, but the beach is not good, like Haitang Bay; or they have first-class beaches but average rooms, like Yalong Bay; this hotel has a large public area, tropical rainforest rooms, and the beach is even better. The service is also full marks. Miss Jasmyn is very considerate. Seeing that we are a couple traveling, she also sent honeymoon arrangements and red wine cakes, so that old couples like us can also be romantic; The plane has to help with late check-out, which is very warm! The trip has come to a perfect end~

🔔Service: The enthusiasm is still undiminished. Although there is no luxury and complete facilities of other hotels, it is important to make people feel at home and make people comfortable. Every waiter and staff will take the customer's business as their own. Arrived at the hotel at midnight, knowing that the kitchen worked overtime to make Hainanese chicken rice, and the front desk helped to replace the upgraded room type with enthusiasm and efficiency.
🍃Environment: Daily cleaning and layout are very timely

suggestion:
1. The toilet paper is of poor quality
2. The towel and bath towel are a bit old, and the face and body will be a bit rough
3. The essential oil is not added in time, and it is also added with more water, which does not have the unique taste before.
4. The concierge does not take the initiative to ask if you need help moving
5. The facilities are too old

Some unpleasant things happened in the middle. The beach dinner that was communicated with the booking depar**ent half a month in advance, told me that it was ok, and I paid an advertising company to set up a platform to buy fireworks from a flower shop, and told me that it could not be set up on the same day (check with the leader in advance to confirm After booking) was very angry. Afterwards, the young man surnamed Xue at the front desk and the leader on duty actively made amends and had an unforgettable Valentine's Day with his girlfriend. I wanted to vent the bad reviews, but I thought that I could not deny all my efforts because of one problem. I chose the encouragement method again. I hope that the enthusiasm will not decline. I hope that the next time I choose Banyan Tree, I can have better service.

The garden design and vegetation of the entire park are very comfortable.
The density is extremely low. Except for the guests who can meet during breakfast, they basically can't see it or only occasionally encounter a few tourists during the day. It is very suitable for families like us who like quiet.
The water in the villa’s swimming pool is very clean. There is also a pavilion in the yard.

The breakfast is very rich, and the variety will be changed every day. We also often eat lunch and dinner at Mingyue Restaurant. The ingredients are very fresh and the cooking is very authentic.

There is free afternoon tea at the beach bar from 5:30-6:30 in the evening. It is really pleasant to watch the sunset and face the sea.

I will definitely come again in the future!

The room fee is more than 10,000, the air conditioner is humming, the room smells bad, and the sanitation is not clean. The smell of the toilet persists all day long. Too disappointed, the Ritz-Carlton is also quite old. But the house is clean!

First of all, I would like to thank the little butler Jasmyn for helping me to book various activities during my stay. If you have any questions, you can consult her. I got a very positive response. All the staff have a good service attitude, and recommend the bad vinegar hot pot here! A little girl at the beach bar is especially attentive and hearty. There is also a car test drive in the hotel, which is very cool! Everyone hurry up and run away, go to Banyan Tree Sanya to play 😍

msg:This is the first time I stayed in Dadonghai. Knowing that the sea view should not be as beautiful as Yalong Bay, I chose the best hotel in this area. It really lived up to my expectations and maintained the consistently high level of service at Banyan Tree. The service staff are all attentive. Before I went, I asked if there are any facilities for children. The staff also said that there are relatively few facilities, but I did go. An open-air small playground is enough for my son to play for five days. It’s fun [covering face] because he has his favorite Trampolines, swings and slides [Insidious] There are also adult karts, and children's bicycles 🚴‍♀️ can be rented. The privacy of the villa is very good, the private swimming pool is great, the first few days of rain, it was a bit cold and cold, so the bathing pool was used, and told the staff in advance that the guests would basically heat up the bathing pool water before arriving at the hotel. , You can soak after returning to the room, comfortable [smiley face] In short, a great experience. The breakfast is good, there are few people, and the time is very long, from 7 to 11 o'clock. The bed is big! The living room of the luxury pool villa is not comfortable, and the children love it very much. Will choose again next time! [Love]

This service is super private and very private. There are not many people who recommend barbecue. Taking photos with the floating breakfast and the environment are super good. The barbecue will set up a table in the yard. The grill is super delicious. My boyfriend and I have a big appetite and can’t finish the floating breakfast. The bed ceremony also gave away Banyan Tree’s 🐢 and a pendant. The picnic tastes slightly worse, but the photos are also very good. The main reason is that the service is very good. I like to wait for the bus and send snacks and drinks to the housekeeper Liu Li super praised the service. good

The service is also excellent, the staff is on call, everything is handled properly for me
Because the flight was relatively late that day, the little butler, Vicky, kindly helped out the late check-out!

msg:Banyan Tree Sanya is on the Mid-Levels Peninsula. When I came to Sanya last year, I didn’t go to the Luhuitou Scenic Area. This time I wanted to make up for my regrets and booked the Banyan Tree Hotel next door to the scenic area. It’s not densely packed with luxury hotels like Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay. Sanya Banyan Tree is a quiet, private manor outside the hustle and bustle. After arriving at the hotel, the waiter helped to store the luggage. Vicky, the beauty at the front desk, helped us check in and gave us a soft drink for two. Then a shuttle bus took us to our room. The rooms here are in the form of single-family villas ➕ courtyards. Each villa has a separate swimming pool and a private outdoor bathtub, which is very private and cozy.
The greenery in the garden is very good. There is free afternoon tea every evening on the beach. It is very relaxing to drink some tea on the beach with the sea breeze. For the two nights staying here, I felt the butler-style service. The beauty Vicky who received us arranged to present coconut green and refreshing cool to the room, which was delicious. Generally speaking, the hotel is very good. It is suitable for couples or families to relax and take a vacation. They will still choose Banyan Tree when they have the opportunity in the future.

Praise Jasmyn Liu and her male colleague at the front desk. The meticulous and considerate service is the hallmark of Banyan Tree, which makes people feel the warmth of home. The little brothers of the concierge are very handsome, very powerful, without a sense of distance, and not artificial. It is very suitable for taking the elderly to recuperate.

He was very considerate to help us upgrade our room to Spring Valley Pool Villa. He also sent local special desserts every night to refresh and refresh. He must give five-star reviews. 👍 The service of every staff in the hotel is also patient and meticulous in all aspects, which is almost perfect! Whether it is the overall natural ecology of the hotel, or the private environment in the villa, including the hotel’s private beach, the a**osphere is particularly great, and it should be the biggest feature of Banyan Tree. Every time you stay in a Banyan Tree brand hotel, you must book the hotel's SPA. This time, I tried the new barbecue party in the villa. It was very good and worth experiencing. The wall is recommended! Looking forward to another chance to come to Banyan Tree Sanya next time!

msg:For this vacation, I chose Banyan Tree and a Haitang Bay Internet celebrity hotel for two nights each. It turns out that Banyan Tree can be regarded as a real resort hotel: 1. The density is too low, except for the sunset tea time, basically not hitting anything. Tourists, quiet and serene; 2. All room types come with a not-so-small swimming pool. You can close the door for a floating afternoon tea and take pictures and have fun for an afternoon. Isn't it better to check in and line up to take pictures under the eyes of the Internet celebrities? 3. The service is so good. I told the butler that it was the wedding anniversary. Not only the room type was upgraded, but also red wine cake was given. The afternoon tea under the million sunset is also free, with fresh fruits every day and a dessert delivered to the room every night. 4. Before I came, I was worried that there would be more mosquitoes in the pool villa, but there were no mosquitoes at all. I didn't get bitten in a bite. The water in the pool was very clean. It was amazing. 5. The private beach is very clean, and the pavilion design is very thoughtful. Although the hotel does not have much food, takeaways can be delivered to the door of the room. In short, Banyan Tree may not have ins-style decoration or stylish infinity pool, but this is a hotel that really cares about the feelings of guests. If you want to lie down in a daze, it is definitely a worthwhile trip.

msg:The location of Banyan Tree Sanya is quiet and quiet. After moving in, there is a feeling of seclusion among the jungles of Southeast Asia. It takes another 5 minutes to drive out to the bustling city. The hotel's room layout is low-density and emphasizes privacy. All rooms are villas with swimming pools. The decoration is a bit dated but has everything that should be. There is free afternoon tea not far from the beach at sunset every day. As a resort hotel, the breakfast time does not end until 11:00, which is also very considerate. There are not many types of breakfast but the menu is a boutique route. It can also be customized according to your taste and requirements. A bowl of Hou An Noodle every morning is really refreshing. The service of the hotel butler cherry is warm and meticulous, and all requirements will be met as much as possible. First, we upgraded the room type for free, and let people send refreshing cool and coconut. In short, it was a very satisfying experience.

I also ordered a floating afternoon tea, which was very good, but the taste was not as good as the sunset afternoon tea. You can call a battery car anywhere you go out of the room.
The public swimming pool is huge and there are no good people.
The disadvantage is that the beach is very general because of the geographical location, the room type is relatively old. But in short it's great! I will consider it later!

Because it is a villa hotel, I feel that there are not so many people. The hotel provides free afternoon tea on the beach. It is particularly pleasant to drink afternoon tea and watch the sunset on the beach.
The overall service is also very satisfactory, the housekeeper Vicky will always care about our needs, and the room service is also very timely.
There are some minor shortcomings, such as the division of room dry and wet separation is not reasonable, but overall it is quite satisfactory and the price/performance ratio is very good.

After waiting for 3 weeks, I finally felt that the epidemic situation had improved (thanks to the motherland!

Every day, I gave out fruits and three fresh coconuts, and prepared small dolls for the children. This is definitely the first choice for bringing a baby to the family!

🍃Environment: The hotel has a beautiful environment, quiet, and room privacy is very good, very suitable for vacation.
🧹Hygienic: The cleaning aunt is also good, and the tidying up is especially clean. If the guests are convenient, they can be cleaned twice a day.
Insufficiency: The lack of facilities is a bit old, such as air-conditioning, it is recommended to update slowly.
🍃Overall: 90 points! This is the first time I personally write so many words in a comment!

msg:What can I say, the overall environment of the hotel can't be said, it's first-class, but the facilities are really too old, and the overall sanitation is average, especially the sanitation in the yard, which is really bad. What, the waiter sent the luggage to the room and asked someone to clean it up, and no one cleaned it until check out. The bathtub in the hotel was stained with spots, and the luggage waiter said it was black stains that could not be removed, so he left Afterwards, I specially put water and wiped it with my hands. It was dust and particles that could be wiped off, and the bathtub suite he said did not have it. It may also be that the temperature was low in the days we lived, and the swimming pool in the yard was not constant temperature, it was too cold to go into the water at all. And there is a green stinky ditch next to the swimming pool, and there is no fence, just some messy green plants to cover it. To be honest, sleeping at night is really awkward, don't book if you are timid, walking from the bedroom to the bathroom at night can be scary to pee. The waiters are equipped with a bicycle per person, but no one knows if they really died in the yard at night. In a word, the environment really has nothing to say, it's great, but I don't recommend staying here. I moved from Yanlord Crown in Haitang Bay. In contrast, the overall service, hygiene and facilities of Yanlord Crown are better than Banyan Tree's. Zhuang is too much!

In the dozens of five-star hotels we have stayed in Sanya, it is the only one that can quickly deliver takeaway to the guest’s room every time, and the chef personally asks every guest about their dining experience during breakfast. The hardware and software are impeccable. The beautiful and wide private beach adds a lot of points. In short, the generosity and kindness of Banyan Tree makes us look forward to our next encounter.

Although Banyan Tree is a few years old compared to 2003, it is not as modern as some new hotels, but all the service staff who meet in the restaurant, lobby, shop, or on the road will make people feel at home. It was a wise decision for Atlantis to move here. I suddenly felt that it was a real vacation. It is more suitable to come here with a smaller baby. I am a loyal fan of Banyan Tree. By the way, Lijiang and Shangri-La’s Yue Banyan Tree is also great

The hotel added an extra bed for free, but the extra bed was squeaky, in fact, the bed can sleep 2 large and 1 small.
If you like privacy and quiet, I definitely recommend Yuerongzhuang.

msg:I took my kids on vacation during the summer ⛱️, first I stayed at the hotel in Haitang Bay, although the hotel there is relatively new, but the main focus is on parents and children. There are children everywhere and most of them are young! I thought that it would be too tiring to play there with my children the whole time, so I wanted to change to a hotel to relax quietly before leaving! Banyan Tree Resort is the first choice, the old brand is trustworthy! Although many people on the Internet have mixed reviews, I was worried at first (after all, the hotel has a longer time, many people say that the facilities are older). But when I arrived at the hotel, all my worries were overwhelmed! Walking into the lobby instantly made me feel the island and Southeast Asian style! Although the hotel is a bit old compared to other hotels, it is cleaned very neatly. They have their own beach 🏖️the crowd will not be disturbed by the surrounding crowds. There are net celebrity swing photos casually posing, don't mention how beautiful it is when the sun goes down! Although the beach is not as fine as Haitang Bay, don't have fun. You can take your kids to the sea, we caught a lot of crabs🦀️. I saw the Internet saying that there are few types of breakfast here, but we feel that more and less are not the focus. The point is that although they have fewer varieties, they taste good, and the entire hotel has 49 rooms, even if it is full, there will be no crowded and noisy scenes. The most considerate thing is their service. Because of the small number of rooms, their service can be more attentive! There are shuttle buses everywhere in the hotel! On call! Takeaway is also delivered directly to the room after the hotel’s younger brother collects it! Here I want to especially praise our housekeeper Carina. From the day of check-in (oh! It should be the day before check-in to call me to ask about the approximate arrival time and ask me what I need to prepare in advance) until check-out. We always ask what we need! She also gives timely feedback and solves problems every time she news! All in all, the surprise here is beyond my imagination. We almost renewed one night, but unfortunately, the ticket can’t be changed and we can only save our regrets until next time. ☺️

Moreover, the independent swimming pool in the room is good, and the circulating water is very clean. Although the various facilities are a bit old, they have no effect on their use. The breakfast is average, but it's better than there are fewer people. You don't have to wait fifteen minutes for the bowl of noodles like other hotels.

Our hotel arrived early, because the room was not ready, so I waited for more than an hour. After checking in, I went to the hotel by myself. During this period, no staff came up to deliver welcome tea or took the initiative to introduce the hotel facilities. One point is lacking. Because it is a villa hotel, the density is low, there are not many guests, and there are not many activities organized in the hotel. It is recommended to arrange some parent-child activities, such as organizing visits to pick coconuts. Turndown aunty service is very good. If the facilities are refurbished, you should choose to stay next time.

The day we arrived at the hotel happened to be a typhoon, the battery car was delivered to the door of the villa, and the waiter held an umbrella to the room thoughtfully, ignoring that he was getting wet during the whole process! In addition, whether it is a beach cocktail party or breakfast food, it is impressive! I did a spa with another mother and bought incense, because the scent I wanted was out of stock, and the beauty manager of the store specially arranged for the new product to arrive and send it to me! In addition, I strongly praise the spencer and enthusiastically arrange the check-out. We left the clothes in the room and contacted me to help us express it! Next time I go to Sanya, I still have to live in Banyan Tree!

msg:Never comment, send it out
Came to Banyan Tree Sanya 3 times and stayed for a week each time.
Next time I come to Sanya, I won't consider another hotel.
There are 3 reasons for recommendation:
1. Convenient geographical location and private forest repairing bamboo
        I don't like shopping very much, I like a quiet place and can take care of the food in the city center. Only Banyan Tree can satisfy both of these points.
2. The warm and thoughtful Spenser and Jimmy
        During the stay, the managers and catering directors have the most contact, each time there are improvements and changes. Help me to book a popular restaurant at the last minute; the daily breakfast is not repeated, and there are new dishes to be fed. People are very handsome, you can guess by looking at the pictures.
3. The only pool villa that can be called a private pool
        I often come to Sanya, and I have also stayed in pool villas in other hotels. Gangzhen, compared with Banyan Tree’s 1.5 meters deep and 55 square meters in size, many of them are nothing more than open-air bathtubs.
P.S. gives a turndown gift every night. There is a small Banyan turtle. If you receive him, you can turn him over and put him on the head of the bed to help sleep, if it has supernatural power!

For example, when I come out from the swimming pool and pass the master bedroom, it is always wet, and the toilet shower is a bit far from the swimming pool. A family of three with a common big bed is completely ok. The 4 of us have set a luxurious big bed. There is an extra living room, so we can sleep in an extra bed. Others are very good, the environment, sanitation, and facilities in the hotel are very leisure, the overall vacation is very good

The service is considerate and thoughtful. The WeChat reply is timely and appropriate. It is really a typical person of kindness! At my repeated request, I got flamingos for me (when the hotel does not provide them). Secondly, the waiters and chefs in the restaurant are very nice. Seeing the old people wearing short sleeves, they took the initiative to deliver shawls; the chefs come to ask about the variety and taste of breakfast every day, and talk to us about the local customs and where can I buy affordable sea food. Products and fruits, there are no pineapples in the fruit, but I went to the kitchen to cut them. Once again, the battery car service is really amazing, on call, because it is very close to the city and encounters thunderstorms, so I often order takeaways, but no matter how late, the security can deliver the takeaways to the room in time. Finally, let me talk about the environment of the hotel. The typhoon a few days ago failed to go to the beach. I went to the hotel’s private beach to watch the sunset on the last night. It was really beautiful.

環境真的不錯，對於喜歡靜的我來説，肯定是首選。尤其是傍晚時候的日落，更有一種獨特靜謐祥和之感。管家Naomi適時的關心和問候，親切又不過於殷勤，體現着悦榕莊一貫的水準，讓我有賓至如歸之感。到這裏即是歸來，身心放鬆也從這一種感覺開始。海灘自助的氛圍感也很不錯，衹是菜品略少了些，但這也不重要。唯一缺的，可能是一杯好酒吧。

缺點就是房間硬件比較老了，房間內的游泳池沒有加熱冬天下水太冷了，然後早餐質量相對於這個價格的酒店來説就比較一般了。

衞生：不錯
設施：唯一優點空調夠勁兒

出行前管家naomi就添加了微信，入住期間也提供了很多幫助，而且説到的要求都滿足了，對比後面某亞和某仁，總有些許小需求需要再次提出才能滿足。
酒店其實也有不少親子項目在康樂中心，另外也有室外小童樂園
鹿回頭的日落絕美，悦榕莊和國賓館公用沙灘，事實證明，要相信國賓館選址的能力！
另外
另外，酒店的早餐非常好啊，絕對是高端五星的配置，供應量不多，但都是精品，反正我愛的煙燻三文魚，芝士焗番茄應有盡有。然後廚師長看到小朋友還熱情問要單獨做份什麼麪嗎，小朋友説要番茄雞蛋麪，就單獨給開了小灶，充分感受到了度假村的熱情
其他的接駁車小哥們也都非常彬彬有禮，另外的另外，到了海棠灣才發現，很多出海項目都在大東海和鹿回頭，以後再來還住悦榕莊哈，泡酒店首選

餐飲方面，免費的下午茶還是不錯的，軟飲料，紅白葡萄酒，蛋糕等都有，早飯還是蠻豐富的，中午 晚飯單點菜品出品也非常不錯，就是作為一個啤酒愛好者，品類少了一點選擇，同時酒店的套餐是否也可以多一點。那就完美了。
關於景色，自己看圖吧，還有什麼東南亞，這裏就是薩瓦迪卡！咔咔咔。。哈哈
￼最後因為這次的三亞，也愛上了悦榕莊，感謝前台的小白，感謝Mr. 奧巴馬！
Ps 我現在在安吉悦榕莊，過兩天寫他們！哈哈

對一個錙銖必較的人來説，酒店房間的設施也許會有些out，但我想大多數人並非如此。更何況酒店已經用服務把設施的微小瑕疵補平，悦榕莊的整體服務不驚艷卻恰到好處，像極了酒店温暖而不張揚的風格。
最後要提一下前台接待薛先生，感謝他温文爾雅，貼心到位的接待。
三亞悦榕莊，期待再次相遇。

不足：客房服務要加強，衞生有待改進，比如室外的床墊和枕套一看就沒換，椅子的坐墊背面還有未乾的水漬，説明是打掃時候直接把坐墊換了一面而沒有換乾淨的，浴缸裏面還有樹枝和死蟲子沒打掃。雖説房間較大，打掃起來確實困難，很多犄角旮旯的地方很明顯沒有用吸塵器吸乾淨，但畢竟是悦榕莊品牌，衞生這種東西還是最基礎的，不能捨本逐末。還有個小細節，洗浴的水壓有點低，花灑出水噴射無力，有待提高。
總體來説還是很滿意的，價格也不算太高，衞生細節方面還是要注意，千里之堤潰於蟻穴，不能忽視。

同價格競品酒店裡性價比不高
優點：服務很好，260/人的自助早餐，雖然菜品不多，但是精緻。畢竟價格在這裏
私密性很好也有私人泳池，但是如果衹是奔着**泳池找房間，1000-2000這個價格可以很容易找到泳池別墅！
所以，我不會再來

重點要感謝我的管家 劉莉 Jasmyn 真的做到了24小時幫你解決任何事情 且任何事情反饋及跟進也很及時 態度也相當好 讓你來到悦榕莊就有一種回家的感覺
下次再來三亞度假 一定還會選擇這家酒店的

酒店也不是沒有缺點，房間設施有些陳舊，mini吧不是免費。我們三天換了三個房型，除了第一天，後面兩天的泳池都不是特別的清澈。
第一次寫這麼長的評論，總之真的很滿意。

另外就是相對於其他新開的三亞酒店，設施確實是落後了，雙床房間的床太小，帶孩子一起住會擠一些。
酒店的服務還是非常好的，遺憾的是早餐的出品，不能完全代表悦榕莊品牌的水平。
另外免費贈送的
夕陽時光茶點還是有驚喜，在海灘看夕陽落地，散散步非常愜意，如果下次和老婆單獨來，非冬季的話，還會考慮這家酒店

前台的cherry非常熱情，給我們細緻的介紹了酒店特色項目，退房時小朋友電話手錶忘房間了，還費了很多功夫幫忙找到，最後又給了小朋友很多小禮品，小朋友很開心，一定要給五星好評！
還有自助餐吧的Nancy、自助餐吧沒注意到胸牌的主管帥哥、美女、餐廳幫忙帶小朋友親自找手錶的selina都很熱情，最後還有海灘的漿板教練，很有愛心的帶小朋友玩漿板，最後給小費都不要……
非常棒的酒店，下次一定要多住幾天！

管家Vicky超細緻很贊，360度五星級服務👍
別墅也很大，很安靜接地氣，很舒服，最喜歡悦榕莊的住宿寬敞，有家的私密感覺，孩子隨便跑，又滿足酒店的五星服務
海景很美，酒店服務也好贊，每次早餐都預留好我們喜歡的位置，知道我們的喜好，給寶寶提前準備好卡通餐包，見到的工作人員都問好
SPA也舒服，外出夜市大排檔也很方便，滿足了愜意遊的需求。
很喜歡，還會一直訂悦榕莊。

真心是我們住過服務和環境最好的酒店！
我們訂的泉浴泳池別墅🏡酒店提前聯繫了我，還給免費➕了一張床（因為是2大2小）太感謝了！
特別感謝管家Colin，很周到很熱情，有問必答！推薦了買便宜海鮮和加工的飯店，還幫忙訂位，真的很棒！
私人別墅和泳池，私密性超級好！公共泳池也很大，爸爸和寶寶們玩的非常開心，我們在酒店泡了3天！
悦榕莊的SPA和網紅漂浮下午茶強烈推薦！真的的舒服&美美的！Candy理療師按摩💆手法超棒，完全不輸泰國的！下午茶公主感爆棚！
房間離私人海灘很近，旁晚風景超美！
早餐7:30-11:00，菜品雖然不多，但很精緻很有品質，12歲以內小朋友129，2歲小朋友免費，餐廳服務員和廚師都很熱情，會特地為寶寶燉蛋，做炒飯，口味非常好吃！下午5:30-6:30有免費下午茶（小甜品飲料）👍
除了地理位置出行稍有不便，其他全部💯
下次去三亞還會選擇這家！
感覺還有很多沒寫全，大家自己去體驗吧！

首先，酒店性價比很高，最大的特點就是細緻入微的服務，工作人員都很友善熱情，令人心情舒暢。

其次，疫情期間，如果是單純度假休息放鬆，這裏無疑是最佳選擇。別墅户型和茂盛的園林景觀，整個環境安靜又私密。大部分時間在園林散步都碰不到人，可以摘下口罩暢快呼吸。


最後，酒店由於開業較早，風格比較老派，但是設施保養和衞生保持方面，比我預想的要好很多。如果圖度假時光慢節奏、悠然自得，大家可以放心入住。

再次感謝管家小孫，以及酒店方每一位員工的熱情招待！

看酒店選了很久，還是想要去三亞的悦榕莊，對這個品牌情有獨鍾。離鹿回頭景區較近，在一片山坡上，旁邊就是國賓館，可見這裏的沙灘別墅的私隱性。在這裏足不出户2日也不覺得滿足，熱帶庭院和泳池，入住前前台會帶你坐車走遍酒店的長橋 園林 海邊；別墅裏1.5米的大泳池還有按摩池，連着親水的湖景綠植，前方是椰影茅屋和海景，清晨 傍晚 好似怎麼拍都是一張絕佳景緻，因此心情會格外放鬆；來個泳池漂浮下午茶呀，更是悠閑的下午時光；客廳裏飄着悦榕莊獨有的香薰，看上一本書或者可以來個椰子就坐在躺椅上感受着自然。
這裏最適合夕陽西下的景色呢 入住時還會安排夕陽下午茶，賓客們在這裏來個旅拍 鞦韆 浮台都是很出片。
早餐的水果品種都很豐富，晚餐的菜單選擇也很多 食材新鮮。

🍃環境：因為每間房是獨立的別墅，私密性還是很好的，人不多，適合度假休息，入住當天天氣還不錯，第二天就來台風了，花草樹木很多，不可避免的會有蚊蟲，房間配了花露水，也有驅蚊器。
🧹衞生：雖然酒店陳舊了一點，剛入住的時候還是比較相信品牌的質量，直到晚上兩點多感覺耳邊癢癢的，醒來發現老公還沒睡，一詢問原來睡着後有蟑螂爬到頭上，抓了扔地上後就不太敢睡覺，我立刻起床電聯了前台，沒一兩分鐘工作人員就來了，説完拿殺蟲劑來，我説我們密閉空間晚上還要睡覺，殺蟲劑對人體有害還是算了。然後我一直覺得耳朵癢癢的，也不知道有沒有蟲子跑進去，詢問酒店沒有耳塞提供，就自己塞了餐巾紙睡覺，老公一夜沒睡好，第二天起來上火喉嚨痛，去別家酒店一直在補覺，怎麼説呢，確實挺失望的。
🚗 交通：退房後有專車送去下一個地方，比較方便。
