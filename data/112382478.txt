msg:The environment is great✌🏻I heard that the hotel does not have a star rating, but the service is no different from other Hilton five-star hotels. My first check-in experience was due to the excellent service of the exclusive Hilton. All the waiters I encountered in the hotel were particularly enthusiastic and attentive, especially Cilia at the front desk and other front desk girls whose names I don't remember. DoubleTree special cookies, welcome drinks and fruits are also provided when you check in. After check-in, you will be given special instructions to take the elevator to the room, which is very attentive. When you ask for directions during your stay, all the waiters will be enthusiastic and smile to guide you and take you to your destination. Before I booked a room, I also read the reviews on Ctrip. There were good and bad reviews. I booked it for one night with some trepidation. I found that the check-in experience was very good, so I decided to renew my stay! Don’t be fooled by the online reviews. Yes, you will know when you come. It is indeed the first Hilton hotel in Guangxi!

The room is clean, comfortable and bright. Needless to say
The concert venue is within walking distance, which is great!

The room was big and quiet. You can walk to the sports center in 10 minutes, and you can have late-night snacks after watching the concert. This is very good. I will choose DoubleTree by Hilton again next time.

There are not many breakfast options in the hotel. The location is not very good and a bit remote.

The funniest thing is that the shower requires three switches to control, without any instructions! There is also a switch hidden underneath that cannot be seen! 😇Don’t you think about how the elderly use it? My mother is 80 years old and is too cold to take a shower. I can only say it’s weird

建議酒店更名為希爾頓逸林快捷酒店，並與當地的第一梯隊快捷酒店在價格上進行匹配，那麼這個酒店就滿是優點了。

msg:本來不愛什麼點評，差不多都是好，但是這酒店我確實覺得不好，比前一天住的那個酒店差的多，因為覺得離機場方便一點才換的，酒店感覺像小旅館，房間像小旅館，早餐屬於能吃飽不餓的那種，服務水平真需要改進，晚上去的比較晚前台硬是問是不是一個人住，我一個人住訂個雙床房，訂兩份早餐不行？前台太小，退房的時候一堆旅行團還是什麼的人在辦入住，等了一會後因為要趕飛機就把卡給前台就走了，回到北京後看按金也沒退，以為走的時候退房的時候沒説清楚是退房而房間沒正常退掉，在攜程上提供的聯繫打電話問酒店，酒店又把電話給前台，前台又要核實我身份，不是本人就不退錢？這種網上付款都按原路退的又沒風險的事非問這問那，給人感覺就是不情願退按金的那種，本身也就一句話的事，但是會讓人感覺不爽，蠻不在乎的口吻更讓人煩，弄的像求他們退按金一樣！幫找車位的小哥和回訪的經理給人感覺態度比較好，不然這個酒店讓我點評覺得應該是0分最合適，聽説南寧三月三挺熱鬧，週末去玩，確實很好，機場打車的小哥聽説我們去玩的都要送小禮物，説是政府和公司讓他們歡迎客人的，唯一覺得差的就是這個酒店，前面住的那個酒店還好，因為覺得這個酒店離機場近點最後一天就換了這個酒店，另外給攜程提個意見，以後別讓酒店給客人打電話，這樣第一可能引起騷擾事件，還有就是支持實際入住的客人寫點評，這種容易導致寫點評不能反應實際問題。

僅僅一點，不知道是因為入住率太高了還是什麼，打掃的不太及時，而且衞生間的用品補充不全，例如漱口水第二天都沒有補充。
瑕不掩瑜，整體不錯～

msg:來過南寧幾次，之前都住青秀區，這次想看下五象新區，就訂了這家逸林。酒店設施非常新，床品很舒服。令人印象深刻的是服務，從每次進門都有門僮開門，以及前台小鐘在入住前就安排好小童的一些設施，非常非常用心。
近兩年新裝修的逸林相對於以前確實減配了。很多都沒酒廊泳池。俘獲人心的是check in 時候的黃油香味撲鼻的🍪，早餐現做的手抓餅/生滾粥，以及無微不至的服務。
