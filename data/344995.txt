Rooms were very comfortable but appeared little old. So again, all in all fair, but time to change a little is due.

Here are the major negative thing that i personally feel
1. Centralized A/C which is too hot even though i have switch to the lowest degree with cool high air. 
2. Window too dusty as i was told to open the window if is too hot and stuffy
3. Shower top needs to change as the rubber tip turn brownish and water shooting from different direction
4. Breakfast expenses  need to pay on the spot and not able to settle upon departure
5. Lift is alittle scary to me even though is safe. The lift have not completely stop and the door open. 

Overall, staffs is good but hotel is kinda old.

Swimming pool was nice, sauna room was small but excellent facilities with shower and lockers .

Unfortunately the gym was under renovation .

Breakfast is amazing, with cheese , and western and Chinese options. 

Excellent package with the afternoon tea.

I would love to stay again soon in this hotel. Great job!

The room is big with a comfortable bed and excellent views of the neighborhood below. 

The bathtub was huge, shower immensely powerful and overall the room was clean.¬† 

If you need any toiletries you need to request directly. It's good to see hotels being more eco friendly and accountable.¬† 

Location is very convenient near Taojin metro or Xiaobei with lots of F&B available in the area.¬†

Service was very attentive with Jacky and Ella at the front desk. 
Their full service business center was very professional I was assisted  by Zoe and Ana on several occasions from scanning, printing, arranging an Int'l courier pick up and local bookings and reservations.

Their executive lounge also has an wonder full panoramic view of the city. Perfect for meetings and social gatherings. 
My room was spacious and clean.

I am used to staying in this hotel. I missed the plane due to traffic jam, and the plane was also rescheduled. I wasted time and made countless phone calls to cancel the hotel reservation. After many communications, I was finally told that I still could not cancel. They said that it could only be cancelled due to force majeure, but traffic jams caused me to miss the plane, which did not count? I complained many times but it was still useless. Moreover, after my flight was rescheduled, I still stayed in this hotel the next day. The next few days and subsequent trips in Guangzhou were all selected from this hotel. I am also an old IHG member. Your handling of this matter gave me a very bad experience. Ctrip customer service also repeatedly helped me communicate many times but still failed. I really can't understand your approach and experience. Extremely bad review

Cleanliness: Very poor. There were stains on the sofa and carpet, and the phone was covered in dust. This is not a question of whether the hotel is old or new, but a question of hotel management. A long-established high-end hotel like Crowne Plaza should not be of this standard.
Environment: pretty good. In the old town of Guangzhou, the skyline on the 63rd floor can also provide you with a panoramic view of Guangzhou City, saving you the regret of not climbing to the top of the Canton Tower.
Service: Most of the waiters at the front desk are male, but the young guys are quite patient, which deserves praise. In addition, there are doormen at the taxi stand outside the hotel who will help with luggage, which is a good review.

I understand that it was not the check-in time, but it was not available at 4:00 pm. After discussing with the front desk for half an hour, another room was provided to us. After the system's request for an extra bed was approved, the hotel did not provide it, so we had to fight for it at the front desk. The room had not been cleaned when the room was handed over, and the previous guest's own shower bottle was still there.

There is a smell of cigarette smoke in the room, which may be adsorbed on the blanket. The sofa is old and has drink stains. When I checked in, I found purple candy wrappers that had not been cleaned away. The scenery facing the mountain is average, but the wind noise in the upper floors is louder at night.

The hotel arranged to add 400 yuan for an extra bed for two nights. The room was upgraded to a suite and a free breakfast for two people was provided. We are very satisfied with this hotel. I am very satisfied with the arrangement and will stay here next time.

The location was pretty good. There were a lot of food in the two surrounding areas. In the middle of two subway stations, it takes at least 10 minutes to walk without waking up and taking the baby. The hotel breakfast is pretty good, especially the leek pancakes

The doorman of this Holiday Inn hotel took the initiative to open the door and carry the luggage, which is in line with five-star standards. The reception at the front desk was very welcoming, the service was in place, and the suite was upgraded. Stayed for two days. The room was large, the bed was very comfortable and the towels were clean and smell-free. The shower head is very flush and comfortable. There are a lot of delicious food around, and Yongqingfang is not far away.

msg:Crowne Plaza Guangzhou City Center: Indulge in your own world

I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza Guangzhou City Center too many times. It was once the tallest building in Guangdong (of course, this was a long time ago). Next to it is the headquarters of Guangdong TV Station, which is considered the city center of the city. . Surrounded by commercial ports, hotels, bars, cafes, old Cantonese-style buildings, subway stations, and bus stations, it is convenient to go anywhere. Whether you are shopping, doing business, traveling, or on a business trip, I think it is a good place to stay.‚Äã‚Äã

Women's hairpins were found on the floor in the living room and next to the bathtub. This reminds me of the quarrel between Fang Hongjian and Miss Bao on the return ship in "Fortress Besieged". It seems that the waiter also used the hairpins to make things difficult and defraud money, which is interesting. The hotel has a very high proportion of foreign guests. The outdoor food street outside the lobby has a great a**osphere and a**osphere, which is suitable for gatherings with friends. The hotel's Chris**as a**osphere is already quite strong, and the Chris**as tree is a good place to check in and take photos.‚Äã‚Äã

The seafood porridge for breakfast is really good, with ample portion and solid ingredients. The executive lounge is on the top floor. There are telescopes that can overlook the mountains and the bustling city of Yuexiu District (administrative trea**ent was given in the past, but not this time). This time the room was upgraded to an executive suite with city view (it used to be an upgrade to a one-bedroom suite with a living room, but after three years of the epidemic, some services have been reduced, I understand). Strictly speaking, it cannot be called a suite, just a suite. It can be regarded as a large bay or a corner room, but it has its advantages: first, the floor is high and the view is good; second, the free space is large, which is suitable for simple fitness in the room.‚Äã‚Äã

In terms of paper hand-held paper bags, CP is gradually replacing them with environmentally friendly non-woven bags, which have a similar volume to the previous paper bags and are relatively small; HI paper bags have a wide opening and an end; HIX is a standard and satisfactory paper bag. Deep and long; the quality of IC's paper bags is quite poor and often leaks; the quality of Indigo and Lijing's paper bags is not bad, mainly because the hand straps are relatively thick and feel good. Some people think that we, professional automobile and real estate presenters who often travel on business, just travel and visit hotels every day under the guise of work. This is really wrong. In the past seventeen years, I have eaten all the throat lozenges and used up all the sprays. There is probably a mountain of throat drops. After hard work, the hotel is our haven and habitat. We can't play, drink and entertain ourselves every night, which is fatal to our throats. Therefore, the outdoor swimming pool in the Crowne Plaza and the gym outside the venue have become my "feng shui treasures". A sweat is healthier than smoking a few packs of cigarettes, haha. Every time I go to the gym, I will see parents and teachers practicing with their children on the tennis court, sometimes until eleven o'clock at night. Hey, people from all walks of life, all cities, and all ages are practicing. No idea.

During the holiday and the Canton Fair, there were many foreigners. The room is clean and tidy. Although it is old, it is better than Crowne Plaza Shenzhen Dongmen. The square bathtub is very large, so the whole family can take a bath together. Children's supplies are taken care of, and tent toys are also prepared in the room. Baiyuelou was very deserted for dinner, and the service was not very good. The dishes were quite acceptable, and the breakfast had all kinds of varieties, but the raw porridge and Cantonese rice rolls were really subpar. Yinji is much better. The night view on the 63rd floor is very good, but the rooftop bar is really a failure due to its location, and going up to the 63rd floor can be said to be a security loophole. The location of the hotel is good, there are many taxis, and the shopping mall opposite is also very convenient. The air-conditioning in the room makes even Hong Kong people feel super cold. The hotel's children's playground is very clean and parents can play with confidence.

msg:The hotel is located in Yuexiu District, Guangzhou City, next to Guangzhou TV Station. It has a total of 63 floors and is called 63 by old Guangzhou. It is surrounded by Yuexiu Park, Guangzhou Station, Taotaoju, Shiguangli Shopping Mall, and is very convenient for entertainment, food, accommodation and transportation. The staff (Anne) is attentive and enthusiastic. In addition, if you stay in the hotel, you can go directly to the 63rd floor to enjoy the night view of Guangzhou.

msg:The price-performance ratio is very high. It is an InterContinental hotel and a long-established five-star hotel. I really have no choice. I called in advance and asked for help to reserve two rooms that are relatively close to each other. I reserved the next door directly. We also prepared children's slippers for the children. I was worried about the oldness after reading the reviews before. But when I came here, I realized that it is not old at all. The decoration is very high-end and the service is very considerate. My little friend had a great time. The 63rd floor overlooks the waistline, which is very nice. üëç

The bed and pillows were very comfortable while sleeping. There is a starry sky bar on the 63rd floor of the hotel, where you can watch the night view.

In addition, there was no room when I first arrived in the morning, but I was later upgraded to a room type, which was a good review.
There are many shopping malls and restaurants around the hotel, so you don't have to worry about food when you bring your kids out. There is a swimming pool and children's playground inside the hotel, which children like very much.
You can see your waist from the room, and there is an observation deck on the top floor, which overlooks the entire Guangzhou city, which is great.
Also, give Anne at the service center a thumbs up for her patient and attentive reception.

There is a supermarket and movie theater opposite. It is within walking distance of Taotaoju and Cantonese restaurants. It is very convenient to reach various attractions within about 7-8km. I didn‚Äôt choose breakfast this time just to experience the Guangzhou morning tea, but I didn‚Äôt get to experience it due to some reasons üòÇ

The hotel facilities are a bit outdated, but they are clean, the rooms are large, and the bedding is comfortable. The hotel services are generally good, and the cleaning and room service are in place. The observation deck on the 63rd floor is so beautiful, overlooking the entire Guangzhou. I wrote a positive review at Miss Pretty‚Äôs request. I will choose Crowne Plaza next time I go to Guangzhou.

msg:I made a comparison on Ctrip. Because it was a family trip, I chose an old hotel in the old city. The superior location and surrounding facilities will always be unmatched by hotels in new areas. Although the hotel is a bit old, the hardware maintenance is okay. It is a typical old Intercontinental style. The suite area is not small, the functional area is reasonable, and the bathroom is oversized. Due to the design of the building's exterior wall, the windows are generally small, and the living room sofa is a bit deformed and should be replaced; service Needless to say, it is at the level of Crown; the breakfast variety and quality are average in comparison. The hotel is located on Huanshi East Road, the former CBD of old Guangzhou. The location is great. It takes more than ten minutes to drive to any scenic spot. The Xingyue Restaurant and Taotaoju next door are 3 to 5 minutes' walk away and are absolute food check-in spots. In short, I personally recommend it when traveling, the price/performance ratio is quite outstanding!

The breakfast in the hotel is very good, and the executive lounge is especially great. It has a large quiet space. It is the largest lounge in the Crowne Plaza Hotel.
The hotel's service is very reassuring. I accidentally touched the emergency button at night and someone immediately came up to ask about the situation. Manager Zheng in the Executive Lounge is very enthusiastic and has the best service in any hotel I have ever stayed in. Thank you very much.

This time I also had a very good check-in experience because I arrived early in the morning and the room hadn't been cleaned yet, so I checked in first and stored my luggage. The overall service was great. The good thing is that when I went back to change the room card at night, a male staff member at the front desk always felt that he was not very patient. When he checked in my previous guests, he looked very impatient. Maybe it was because the person in front of me took a long time to check in. Anyway, when I arrived, I didn‚Äôt have a smile or anything, but I didn‚Äôt have any excessive words or deeds. I just didn‚Äôt have the good attitude of other staff.

Then I found that there were hairs on the toilet (not hair) as shown in the picture, and there were black things on the sheets. I asked the guest room to change the sheets and clean the toilet. The door was open while cleaning, and a waiter suddenly came in. Without knocking or saying anything, he put a fruit plate on the table and left. Is this a welcome fruit plate or an apology fruit? When I took a shower at night, I found that the counter where the shower gel was placed was once again covered in black dirt. The shower head was so thick with dirt that I could pick it off with my fingernails. Not to mention all of this, I used a bath towel after washing and found that inside the bath towel, Wrapped in a hair, it was definitely not hair. The manager on duty came over and said that he would upgrade me to a suite or send me breakfast. Sorry, I didn't have these needs. It's impossible for a five-star hotel to have such poor hygiene and service. . .

The hotel said there were no rooms yet and arranged room 3808 for me. However, they only gave me a card holder and room number, but not a room card. They said I could come back later to get the room card. I went to get my room card at 10 o'clock in the evening, but the front desk changed me to room 5516. I asked specifically why it was not room 3808, but she gave me a random reason to fool me. Then I took the elevator up. The elevator was dirty, full of water, slippery, sticky and had a bit of a smell. When I arrived at 5516, I opened the door and saw a room card plugged in to get electricity. The desk lamp was on. There was an open suitcase inside, clothes scattered on the floor, and a pair of red women's shoes. lie on the floor. So I went back to the front desk with my room card. The front desk didn't explain or apologize to me. When they got me a new room card, they took photos of the two new room cards twice. She said she would give me an explanation when the investigation was clear. I thought to myself that I would wait until then to hear the apology. As a result, the next day, a different person came to me, and the explanation he gave me was also read from the computer. I understood that the incident was not caused by him, so I did not need his apology. The "compensation" the hotel offered me was to give me breakfast, but it was almost 11 o'clock at that time, who still had breakfast? They said they would upgrade my room next time I stayed there, but I said I didn't dare to stay there anymore. I just want the girl at the front desk to call me and explain what happened and sincerely apologize. As a result, it has been 24 hours since the incident occurred, and I have not even waited for this apology.

Someone from the hotel engineering depar**ent came to repair it the next day and said that the sealant was applied, but it was not dry. It still leaks. Please tell me, I can't use water. The so-called parent-child room is just a gimmick to cut leeks. If it doesn't match the hotel facilities, it's too inappropriate. 2. The parent-child room is the same room type as the executive deluxe suite. Some family items have been added, and some prices have been added, but they still don‚Äôt enjoy administrative trea**ent. I don‚Äôt understand, but this may be Ctrip‚Äôs problem.  Overall, it's okay. It's understandable that the price is high during the holidays. I hope it matches the facilities and services. Another point to mention is that the check-in process is too slow. The service attitude is okay.

But the breakfast was not very good. It was close to 12 o'clock when I checked out. Because I had a lot of luggage, I had just finished unpacking it. I wanted to sit down and take a rest. I called the front desk to ask if I could extend my check-out for half an hour. The other party's reply was also amazing. I wanted to give a five-star review and then go to the front desk to take a screenshot. Show it to them before you can extend it. This is the first time I have encountered such a request. The hotels I have stayed at since my trip have generally given me an extension, and sometimes I ask if I can give a good review. But Crown was extended based on five-star reviews and showing screenshots to the front desk. I was speechless. I originally wanted to rest for a few minutes before checking out, but after receiving such a reply, I decided to check out without any fuss.

However, this hotel's service and ability to handle tourist peaks are too poor. The waiting time for check-in is very long, it usually takes 20 minutes for one person. Secondly, the room is not ready at 3:30, so we need to wait until after 5 o'clock to check in. Because of the busy schedule, we did not arrange the room according to the booked room type and did not inform us in advance. I was defending my rights on the first day I moved in. . . .

1. The view on the 45th floor is excellent, the room is grand, the dressing room is convenient, the bath water is large, and the top floor is good for drinking and viewing.
2. The famous 63-story building is a testament to the era of reform and opening up. The surrounding old town has a local flavor of Laoguang, and there are many historical buildings around it.

shortcoming:
1. The sofa is worn, dirty and stained. The edges of the seat cushions are damaged and are still in use. Other furniture is also old.
2. There are many varieties of breakfast but the quality is low. There is nothing to eat. The food trays are not collected in time. The dining table and dining area are not hygienic. It may also be due to the poor quality of customers during the Spring Festival holiday.

The holiday hotel provides free buses to scenic spots, which is convenient for travel. 2. The hotel is hygienic and clean. Although the hotel is old, the facilities are not old and do not affect the stay experience. 3. The hotel is located in the center of Yuexiu District, which belongs to the old city. It is close to Poly Shiguangli Shopping Mall and Taojin Subway Station, making it convenient to eat and travel. 4. The hotel is very attentive in running various activities during the Spring Festival. We enjoyed a lion dance performance on the second day of the ***** New Year. 5. There are indeed too many people at breakfast, and the service can't keep up. There are many snacks near the hotel.

Not the equipment that a star should have. In addition, the receptionist at the front desk didn't seem to understand the request or was it intentional? I told him not to arrange a corner, that is, a tail room. Then such a big hotel will arrange a tail room for you. The toilet inside has to turn a corner, which is super uncomfortable. Forget it, the air conditioner was making a lot of noise, but fortunately I called them to call the maintenance master to fix it. Otherwise you can't sleep at all. The swimming pool is small, but fortunately it is still clean, but there are children outside who have coaches training swimming in the swimming pool, and it has become a training class. There are relatively few types of buffet breakfast. The only thing that is directly praised is that the wave pool is relatively clean, and children are more at ease playing.

She also emphasized that you could contact her or her colleagues at any time if necessary. My colleagues and I are deeply grateful for this! In addition, the rooms are fully equipped, clean and tidy, which left a deep impression on me. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom facilities were great, allowing me to get a good rest after a long day. In addition, the hotel also provides a first-class gastronomic experience, including a sumptuous breakfast buffet and a variety of room service menus, with authentic flavors and endless aftertaste. Overall, my stay at the Crowne Plaza Guangzhou City Center was a great experience and I highly recommend this hotel to other travelers.

msg:I arrived late that day and helped me upgrade the suite. The hotel is not very new, but the room as a whole is clean and comfortable with a reasonable layout. The elevator may have been remodeled and divided into high and low floors, which is a little inconvenient. The breakfast variety is quite rich, but the Cantonese-style dim sum is slightly less, and there is no separate small plate for the ketchup in some details, and the cheese plate is cut in advance, which will affect the taste, and many meal clips are plastic. The tableware on the seat is not placed on the napkin but in a paper bag. These details feel a bit inconsistent with the five-star hotels in first-tier cities. The service staff is well trained and very nice.
Good value for money, suitable for business trips.

Although the price was high during the National Day holiday, I still booked the Baby Room Big Mouth Monkey Suite in order to have a wonderful travel experience for my baby. However, I can only say that this hotel is not worth it and is not recommended. When booking, it was said that we could check in at 2 pm, but when we arrived at 3 pm, the room was still unoccupied, and the baby could not catch up on his nap. We finally checked in at around 4 pm, and the baby started to sleep at around 5 pm. Dinner, night outing, sleeping at night, etc. are all affected. Before checking in, I saw comments from netizens saying that there were supplies for babies in the room, but after checking in, I found that there were toiletries for adults, but nothing for babies. Finally, we only had baby slippers, bathrobes, and toiletries after we took the initiative to call and ask for them. , small school bag, and the room service staff actually said that the baby can take away the baby's things after using them, but the small school bag cannot be taken away. Finally, it‚Äôs takeout. I ordered takeout on the first day, but it couldn‚Äôt be delivered upstairs. The front desk helped to collect it. On the second day, because the child was crying so much, I was in a hurry to leave when the takeout was delivered. I couldn‚Äôt go downstairs to pick up the meal in time, but this time The front desk said no matter what, they couldn't help with the takeout. After repeated communication three times, I asked the delivery person to call the front desk staff. I spoke directly to the front desk, but the front desk didn't answer, saying that they couldn't help with the takeout. Finally, after I strongly expressed my dissatisfaction, the front desk staff accepted it for me. I really don‚Äôt understand why I could collect it yesterday but not today. He said it was a hotel policy, so why didn‚Äôt it exist yesterday but today it does... How can such a service deserve five diamonds? How can such service be worthy of luxury? Not worth it, not recommended. I will never stay at Crown Hotel again.

It is understandable that the cabinet is not fixed well enough to be replaced, but the mattress is so old that it collapses when one sits on it, and the springs are not good. The room was discounted to more than 860 yuan, and my back hurt after staying for 2 days. It's not as comfortable as the bed of the more than 300 Holiday Inn Express.

The hotel takeaway cannot be delivered, and the takeaway personnel are not allowed to enter the lobby? ? ? The front desk of the hotel asked me to read my ID number when there were so many people in the lobby to verify my identity? Shouldn't the last four digits of the ID card be asked normally? It's really outrageous, the hotel with the worst experience ever! Only the cleaning lady is very kind!

Especially the bed, it was too dilapidated, the bed was sunken when lying down, it was not very flat, but some parts were hard and some parts collapsed, making it uncomfortable to sleep on. Also, the air conditioner had a musty smell. Like an antique hotel, the price is not cheap.

The best thing is that you can go up to the top floor of the 63rd floor to see the scenery, which is the only benefit.

When I checked in, the front desk asked if I smoked. I said no. She said that she arranged a very high room for me. When I entered the elevator, I saw that 40 was not too high. On the middle floor, when I entered the door, there was a musty smell mixed with smoke. My phone The customer service changed the room, and she said that she would change it immediately. I had a job and stayed in the room for an hour and then I was anxious to go out to see the exhibition. When the elevator came, the front desk person came and I said I was in a hurry to go out. I said I said I don‚Äôt need to change the room, the poisonous gas has been washed away... When I went back in the afternoon, the poisonous gas in the room volatilized again. I packed my luggage and put it at the front desk and said that the room would not be changed, and the poisonous gas would not be dealt with. Later she said that they would find someone to deal with it It‚Äôs poisonous, but that person didn‚Äôt do it... He didn‚Äôt do anything, and there was a lot of nonsense. Later, I saw that there was a review recommendation on Ctrip. I would not recommend others to come here. I gave a score of 0 for the recommendation. Ctrip called me and said I will deal with the hotel. After a long time, I finally changed to a room without poisonous gas. It is really not easy to meet hotel consumers with poor facilities and poor service awareness.

Talking about the children's room first, it is a very spacious and comfortable room suitable for family travel. It is a theme tent that children like very much. The beds in the room are also very comfortable. Children can have a good rest and relax here.

Next is the customer service Miss Pretty, she is one of the best employees in this hotel. Miss Pretty was very friendly and welcoming, always happy to answer our questions and help. She knew the hotel's various facilities and services and could give us great suggestions to make our trip smoother and more enjoyable.

The hotel staff was also very professional and friendly, always willing to help and answer our questions. We had a very enjoyable and memorable trip here.

There is a bus stop when you go out, and there is a subway station when you go further. The transportation is convenient. The floor of the hotel is high enough. You can see Xiaoman Yao from the toilet. The room service is warm and thoughtful. Tea sets are also provided to make tea. The Baileys afternoon tea set is okay. There are many choices for breakfast, but the taste is ordinary. Of course, the overall price of the extra room is cost-effective. But there is one thing I am very concerned about, which is the hygiene problem. Figure 1 is a piece of equipment placed on the bedside table between the double beds. It is in a conspicuous place, and the thick dust on it is also very obvious. Although I have long known that many five-star hotels are hygienic, and the crown is relatively affordable, the requirements cannot be too harsh, but the surface work still has to be done well... I hope to improve

msg:I will never give a bad review!!! Every minute in this hotel is torture! A platinum five-star hotel under the IHG InterContinental Group? Is it worthy? Did you give the good reviews yourself? Summary: The hardware is old, unclean, the facilities are patina, and the staff is extremely poor! 
1. There was no smile at the front desk during the check-in process. You can check out at 1400 when booking. I wanted to confirm it again. I asked 3 times before I got a reply. There was no explanation of where the elevator was. 
2. I expected that the old five-star hotel would be relatively broken. But I didn't expect it to be so broken and the facilities were old. This is simply a guesthouse! The sofa is very dirty and discolored. The headboard is a knitted fabric, yellow, patina, and I feel itchy all over my body without a pillow to cushion it when I sleep at night! The ceiling is also yellow. There are four very large and abrupt fire heads in the four corners! 
3. After washing the bathroom at night, I found that there were hairs left by the previous guest on the bath towel, which was extremely disgusting. The hair dryer was still broken at night. The shower gel was still fixed in a large bottle. There is also 0 exhaust in the bathroom, which is OK for one person. It is very embarrassing for couples to check in and the toilet smells bad!
4. The hardware of this hotel is poor. The staff is very poor! Except for the doorman who is very enthusiastic and will take the initiative to carry the luggage. The other staff have no service ceremony at all.
5. When checking out, it takes 15 minutes to queue up. At 12:30, the busiest time, more people should be arranged, but there are two empty seats. When I was told to check out, I just need to throw the room card somewhere (1. There was no explanation when checking in. 2. There was no guidance when checking out, so I could only queue stupidly). Other five-star hotels generally have waiters to guide and ask if I want to store my luggage.
6. I carried two suitcases and two small bags by myself. When I walked to the door, one suitcase fell to the ground. The two female staff members next to me just watched you and didn‚Äôt have any intention of helping. The soles of your shoes are painted with 502?

msg:On the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, I decided to stay in a hotel with my baby to enjoy the moon, but I didn't expect to meet her favorite cartoon character room. She laughed happily as soon as she entered the room. The room facilities are complete and clean, and the layout of the suite can be said to be quite cost-effective for this price. Recommended for parents who don't want to walk their baby outdoors in hot weather, but have to go out to walk their baby. A doll that is bigger than her, can play a little BB's little doll, a pillow and a tent~ The child can play the role of Jiajia for a day (think too much, at most one hour you will join the role of Jiajia). Take a bath in the bathtub when you are tired from playing, and take a lunch break seamlessly. The fly in the oin**ent is that there is no child fence on the bed, which is inconsistent with the content of the hotel's promotional video. I hope this facility can still be added to the parent-child room.
It is very convenient to eat. It is opposite to the Central Plaza. If you want to go out, you can cross the flyover. If you don‚Äôt want to go out, there are many takeaways around.
The sixth floor is a children's playground and an outdoor swimming pool. The space is very small, and it is still enough to walk the baby when there are few people. There are also theme activities during the Mid-Autumn Festival, which is very intimate~
The service staff at the front desk and the floor are very polite. Some staff can see that they are new employees and their business is not yet skilled.
The two-day and one-night hotel walking activities ended, and the children asked every day: Mom, when can we go back to the hotel?
I look forward to taking the baby to the 63rd floor to watch the scenery and admire the moon next time.

The staff are nice and courteous. Room and front office staff service is better than breakfast room. But as a five-star hotel, the maintenance and hygiene of the hotel are very different. In terms of hygiene and equipment maintenance, I think the level of a hotel that has been in operation for 11 years is not as good as some three-star and four-star hotels. Comes with a picture of a towel. Regarding the waiters, I don‚Äôt know whether it is appropriate to say that the hotel has cultivated a sense of belonging for the employees. We asked the room attendant what restaurants are better around. The room attendant said that there was nothing to eat around, so the hotel restaurant. In fact, there are all good restaurants around, and Taotaoju is only 300 meters away.

The room is big and the bedding is very comfortable. The bathroom is huge and the shower feels very relaxing, but the shampoo is really dry. I don't usually apply conditioner, but after using this shampoo, the conditioner is still dry the next day (maybe because of the climate in Guangzhou...) The only drawback is that the hotel has been built for a long time, the elevator is a bit slow, and the living room On the 38th floor, you can wait for 5 minutes when you go downstairs and wait for the elevator. It is a 5-minute walk from Taojin subway station. The location is quite convenient. It takes less than half an hour to take the subway to Zhujiang New Town. Btw, it happened to be a birthday during the stay, and the hotel also sent a cake, which is very heartfelt. Finally, I would like to commend Miss Sara for her attentive service and good attitude.

It takes ten minutes to drive to Taikoo Hui and Tianhuan Plaza~
Hygiene: This is the part that I am most satisfied with. I have stayed in many hotels, but none of them have such a clean liner as the kettle in this hotel. The picture above shows that the hotel was opened in 11 years, but the bathroom has no rust or yellowing. , this is very satisfied very satisfied!
Breakfast: relatively rich, fruit, bread, and Cantonese dim sum in Yangcheng. The point is that 90 yuan per person can have such a rich breakfast in a star-rated hotel in Guangzhou, üëç
Service, I would like to thank Miss Dong Jie at the front desk. We arrived at the hotel at 10:30 in the evening. She took the trouble to meet all my requirements and helped me upgrade 2 rooms. It feels really good to see the waist. The one bedroom and one living room fulfilled all the wishes of my two daughters, and the heart-warming tea set happened to be the dark green I liked during this time. Everything is so beautiful! I will come back next time!
Facilities: The only point deducted is that the TV in the living room is broken, you can only watch TV in the room, and then the TV should be replaced üôà, if you don't like watching TV, you can ignore it!
Last but not least, the hotel has free parking in the parking lot, and a room card is required to access the guest room, which is very safe! There are also many delicious takeaways near the hotel üê∑ Attached takeaway pictures üòÅüòÅüòÅ

msg:Unexpectedly, Ctrip‚Äôs first mistake when booking a hotel happened with an international chain. Let‚Äôs not talk about the outdated facilities of the hotel. It's rare to see such poor service. I arrived at the hotel at 5pm on the first day. After checking in, I was informed that it would take two hours for the room to be cleaned. Is there a question mark on my face? ? ? Everyone knows that hotel rules require check-in after two o'clock in the afternoon. This was the first time in so many years that I was asked to wait for two hours when I arrived at five o'clock. The service staff was indifferent and said it was because there were so many people during the Chinese New Year. Let me understand. I came to stay in the hotel to understand that you are here? Is this how you are trained in speaking skills in the service industry? Let your customers understand you every day? Are your services only available when business is slow? No service if there are too many people?
I originally thought about going to dinner for the Chinese New Year, and asked if I could let us know when the room was cleaned so that we could come back to check in, but I was handed a business card and asked to call and ask! Who do I ask? No room number? If I call the hotel, who knows which room is mine?
After dinner in the evening, I went back to the hotel and went to my room. Because I booked a room for four people with two large beds, there were only two quilts. I called room service to ask for two more quilts, and the answer was simply, no more! I made a strong request and after more than half an hour, two quilts were delivered. It was the first time I stayed in a hotel and experienced such poor service. This is the first negative review on Ctrip in eight years!

The hotel facilities are very old, the kind in the 90s, the breakfast variety is small, and the tableware is also very old. The biggest problem is that there are few service personnel at the door, only one person, weak service awareness, and do not know how to help with luggage. The most satisfying thing about the parent-child room is the bathtub, and the others are really meaningless. The hotel's outdoor pool was unavailable and there was no compensation. The most exaggerated thing is that you can check out at 2:00, but you return to the room at 1:40 to change clothes, and the door is locked and cannot be opened.
The service staff, especially the management staff, have problems with their abilities and attitudes.

The service is very good, and the basic needs and problems are solved immediately. Especially on the date of departure, because the flight is relatively late, I asked the hotel if I could check out a little later. Ella, who was on duty, immediately applied for a delay of a few hours for me to check out. At the airport, they also gave a cafe drink coupon, and they also got a snack gift when they checked out. It's very heartwarming. The swimming pool and tennis court have not experienced it due to the recent rainy days. I will try it next time!

msg:In Gold Rush, the former city center of Guangzhou, this Crowne Plaza Hotel should have witnessed the rise and fall of the Garden Hotel area. The room looked out and saw the night view of the Garden Hotel area. There were a lot less neon lights, and it was similar to the Pearl River New Town to the east. Much darker than that.
But the old hotel still maintains his previous heavyness. Little brother Li Bin will take the initiative to help with luggage. The front desk clerk consciously maintains the order at the front desk. When there are too many people, he will take the initiative to open an additional counter to take care of the passengers queuing behind. But the only thing I don't understand is a long ramp in the lobby, which is said to be convenient for passengers with luggage or the disabled, but this long ramp has to go a long way to get to the elevator, I would rather walk next to it with my luggage Stairs, a few steps to the elevator.
There is not much peculiar smell in the aisle of the room. For an old hotel, the maintenance is quite good. There is a welcome fruit at the entrance of the room, turn right out of the entrance, and you will see an oversized room with a classic office desk from the Holiday Inn. A round table with a chair. There is also a pile of sofas by the window, which can be used for meeting guests. There is also an ashtray on it. This room can be smoked. Now almost new hotels will not retain smoking rooms. This old hotel still retains smoking rooms. Traditionally, when checking in at the front desk, the waiter will also specifically ask if a smoking room is needed, which is friendly to qualified smokers. The bathroom that you enter by turning left is also very large, and there is a special compar**ent for hanging clothes.
In the evening, I tried the hotel's food delivery service. The 40-minute wait was not too long, and the price was high. The three dishes were almost 300, but I was satisfied with the taste.
After staying here, the overall feeling is that the price/performance ratio is high. This room only costs more than 500 yuan, which is almost 700 to 800 compared with other hotels of the same level. The facilities in the room are quite convenient for life. I am willing to live in this hotel for a long time. It is not a problem to stay for 20 days. I can negotiate a lower price with the salesperson, about 8000, and I should be able to win it.

More than 400 meters to the entrance of Metro Line 5 B, you can walk to Luhu Park in about ten minutes. The facilities in the hotel are well maintained! The room is clean and tidy without any odor. The breakfast is a typical Cantonese meal, and the product is excellent. The room is spacious and quiet. The phone told the guest room center to like a harder mattress, and immediately arranged for the service staff to turn the mattress over and laid the mattress intimately. In the evening there is a nice soup and supper, Guangzhou people are so good at eating, so happy! A heart-warming stay experience! A must-choice hotel when you come to Guangzhou.

First of all, the location is very good, the city center, less than ten minutes walk to Line 5; the room is large, the view is good, you can see the "small waist"; breakfast, very good, worthy of eating in Guangzhou. Disadvantages: 1. The elevator is not properly configured, and it takes a long time to wait for the upper and lower sides; 2. The electronic lock is out of power and closed outside. Although the problem is solved, the usual inspection facilities should be done.

       The hotel has been in the hotel many years ago, but I have never stayed in it. I think if it weren't for the epidemic, no one would take a vacation like this.
        The location of the hotel is excellent. The podium downstairs is the consulate of several countries. It is estimated that there were many foreign businessmen before the epidemic. After upgrading the deluxe room, the northeast corner can be near Luhu Golf Course and Xiaomanyao. It is true that the geographical location is incomparable to the later ihg.
         The hardware thought it would be very old, but I found it was repaired. Although the style is outdated, it feels good to have all the sanitary wares replaced.

msg:Gold Rush is the old CBD of Guangzhou,
The building where the Crowne Plaza is located was once the tallest building in Guangzhou.
The rivers and lakes are called "63 floors".
This hotel is a bit old,
But it has been reinstalled in recent years,
It also belongs to IHG,
OTA checked in last Friday but only over 600 mosquitoes,
In the case of business travel hotels such as Lavande and Ibis all over 400,
The price of Crowne Plaza is really cheap.

I don‚Äôt do much research on hotels,
In my perception (my perception is not necessarily correct [Wang Chai]),
in Guangzhou,
Crowne Plaza, Garden Hotel, China Hotel, Oriental Hotel, etc. belong to the third echelon,
The second tier is Conrad, Jumeirah, Yazhi, etc.
The first echelon is magnificent, four seasons and so on.
I haven‚Äôt stayed in many hotels in Guangzhou,
I have only stayed in the Four Seasons Tower View Room twice.
Maybe not yet the age to lie down and enjoy,
Maybe it's a person who is used to being free and loose,
I don‚Äôt like spending money on housing too much üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Speaking of Crowne Plaza,
The location is very good,
The opposite is Central Plaza, and a few hundred meters to the east are La Perle and Guang Bai;
But there are many hotels on this street,
The limelight of Crowne Plaza has been covered by gardens and white clouds.
The hotel lobby inherits the low-key style of Crowne Plaza.
Slightly cramped,
But the smell of the fragrance makes me feel comfortable,
This is for someone like me who is super sensitive to smell,
Too good.
The guy at the front desk is handsome and has a good service attitude.
Polite and gentle [insidious]
According to my requirements, a 50-story city view room was arranged.
Nice.
The most basic room type has an area of 40+ square meters,
The wind is very cool when the small window opens,
The line of sight is also very good.
Look at the Canton Tower from this angle.

The service of the hotel can be summarized as
"The service attitude is great, and the service efficiency is very hip."
It takes at least half an hour to order room service.
It may be a relatively large hotel,
The ratio of waiters to the number of rooms is not reasonable.
But the service attitude is very good,
The waiter who set me bathtub film was not skilled in business,
The business manager came to apologize in person and gave a fruit basket as a gift.
And helped me replenish six bottles of Nongfu Spring (I am indeed a buffalo)
Nice.
Although it is efficient to pull the hips, I am still satisfied

There will be a bit of musty in the room,
Very slight,
Just open the window for a while.

Although it's a long time ago,
The items in the room are a bit of a trace of time,
So much that it looks old
But there are a few details that I appreciate very much,
One is that the room is actually equipped with a Panasonic steam iron.
And there is a high ironing board (the disadvantage is that it looks a bit stained),
This is too convenient for residents,
After all, the hotel charges a fee for washing,
Even for members, there is a limit on the number of cleaning items per day.
Second, cleansing milk and body lotion are also available at the sink.
Saved the Forgetful Star.

In general,
Although the hotel software and hardware are not top-notch,
But also in line with its own positioning.
Part of the high-rise rooms look at Luhu Lake, and some look at the city.
The landscape is better than the garden hotel.
Really recommend staying!

msg:The room is very quiet at night, and the soundproofing is not bad.
But there is a little problem:
1. When the refrigerator is turned on, it is so hot that the heat comes out from the seam in the cabinet where the refrigerator is installed. The air-conditioned room is cooler than the refrigerator.
2. Although the bathroom door has a lock, the door cannot be completely closed and the lock is useless.
All in all, the experience was not bad, with good morning and evening scenery.

msg:The hotel has a good location, located in the hinterland of Zhujiang New Town, and offers free parking. The lobby is on the top few floors of the hotel, the scenery is good, and the tower view room can see the Guangzhou Tower, but it is certainly not as good as the four seasons and magnificent views. Of course, the price is far different. The rooms are relatively old, but are undergoing renovation during the stay. The hotel service is very warm, check-in and check-out are very fast, but the room service is a bit slow, ask to wait for more than half an hour with a pair of chopsticks. The hotel breakfast is very rich.

The guest room manager Fan Wenfan received us and gave us a welcome drink coupon and fruit and soup. It was really sweet , When we checked out, we knew that there was still a long time before our departure time, so we specially helped us to do late check out! ! ! This kind of service and attitude is really great üëèüèª Will continue to patronize next time I return to China! Thank you everyone

The ultra-luxury hotel 30 years ago was once the place I dreamed of. Today I am staying, and it is full of traces of years...

msg:Well-deserved old hotel, the room is quite big, but the layout of the room I stayed in is a bit strange, the bathroom is very large, it is a pity that a lot of empty space is not placed in the bedroom. It is very convenient to have an iron in the room, and the accessories include facial cleanser.
The blinds in the bathroom are too retro to be useful, so I studied for a long time. Turn the stick on the left to adjust the direction of the blinds, pull the rope on the right to lift the blinds, and pull the rope on the right 45¬∞ to the left to lower the blinds. Although there is a mini bar, it turns out to be charged ‚Üí_‚Üí
The breakfast varieties are quite plentiful, but there are no morning tea varieties such as dim sum. The chicken feet and rice rolls are quite Cantonese. The porridge made with hot and hot ingredients is quite special. The Shunde special double skin milk tastes good, and the others are common breakfast buffet varieties.
As a business trip, when we checked in, we booked four rooms, two with double breakfast, and the last four people had breakfast. Thanks to Peppa at the front desk for his professional service, skilled business, and fast processing, Amway!

La piscina, sauna, steam room, gimnasio y otros espacios como el bar del Lobby est√°n en una condici√≥n deplorable.
Se puede notar el paso de los a√±os en ascensores, el cierre de otros servicios etc.
El desayuno, como siempre muy bueno y completo, la ubicaci√≥n excelente y el staff muy atento.
