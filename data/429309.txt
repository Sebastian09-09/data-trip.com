Too many mosquito in room.
We have 4,6 age chilren. At the restaurant If you have two children, you must pay more one person even if they are lower than 120cm.
Hotel rule, 1 room only one child free. If you have 2 baby dont go hotel resturant. I have been visited too many hotels but this is first time. If I have two children so need to pay one nore , I agree. But hotel regulation like this ,it will be unfair.
Indoor pool is big. Good.

msg:The location is excellent, and the hardware standards of the construction were quite high. Many online reviews say it is old, which is true, but not to the point of being unacceptable. I just think you get what you pay for, so the room is worth the price. There is also a golf course and an ecological park, which is indeed the ceiling of "low-end vacation".
The only complaint is that the service is not in place, the training is not enough, and it is probably because the employees' salaries are not in place, so I understand.
The hotel did not generously implement Ctrip's free upgrade room type, and simply gave me a so-called landscape location, which is a bit of a pity.

The sanitation of the entire park was handled well, because the guest rooms in the park are now undergoing large-scale renovations, and the areas under renovation are all enclosed on a large scale, so the noise level is acceptable. The room was very clean, the beds were neat, and the windows were clean. The toiletries were of good quality, and there were stone benches in the shower room for sitting and bathing. The breakfast was very rich. My order included a Chinese kitchen dinner, which was sufficient in portion and tasted good. After dinner, I returned to the room and found a small surprise, two bowls of red dates, wolfberries, and longan syrup.

After checking in, the mini bar was immediately provided, with drinks, fruits and snacks, which is very considerate. It just feels a bit old overall, and the carpet in the corridor is a bit dirty.
There is a carousel in front of the door, which makes you feel like a child. The end of the Italian restaurant is the fitness room, which is convenient for exercise on rainy days.
After a short break in the afternoon, I took a special car to Jiulong Lake Ecological Park, and the service was thoughtful. The park walkway is relatively primitive, and it is best to start in the morning to walk around the lake. Looking down from the King Hotel, the mountains are stacked, the smoke is misty, and the reservoir at the foot of the mountain is like an emerald. The scenery is excellent and the mood is comfortable.
When I returned to the hotel at night, there was even sugar water delivered. Although the taste was average, it was thoughtful enough.
The overall trip was satisfactory and happy^O^

The service is really great! In particular, I would like to praise the cleaning aunt for practicing small profits and responding to requests. She is super warm ~

The breakfast is not bad, the noodles are delicious, and the Shunde fish porridge is also good~

I heard that the hotel is going to be renovated. I’m really looking forward to it~ I hope to come back in the future~

In terms of service: The lady at the front desk was pretty and attentive. She upgraded our room type for free. The hotel staff we met along the way were all smiling, which made people feel very comfortable. She also tried her best to understand and satisfy the guests' requirements.
Hotel: The rooms are very large and well-equipped. There are a lot of welcome fruit and snack gift packages, and the children are very excited. The hotel also has an indoor temperature-controlled swimming pool, an outdoor swimming pool, and an indoor hot spring. The surrounding environment of the hotel is good, with green trees and shade. Make a film
Areas that need improvement: I personally feel that there are too few parent-child activities. There is no children's amusement park and only a carousel. This may be related to the positioning of the hotel.

It is recommended to come here to relax while walking the baby.
The only thing is that the European town is still being renovated and houses are being built nearby. It is estimated that in two years there will be more people.

She has a beautiful heart and a pair of eyes that can speak. The massage skills are okay, and the noodles and cold dishes in the owner's cafeteria are good ~ A hotel worth staying in

Facilities: They are all quite complete and the hotel is very large.
Environment: There is a fountain at the hotel entrance which is great for taking pictures. I wanted to go swimming but I didn’t bring a swimsuit so I didn’t go. I heard it was very clean.
Service: The staff at the hotel are very friendly. They greet guests when they see them and are very polite. There is also a handsome guy named Pan Xiaodong, who is super nice. When I went to the King Hotel in the evening, he sent me and my friends there, and he happened to be there when I came back. He picked up the phone and was very polite. I didn't know the road and he even got out of the car and walked us there, which was a super bonus! Otherwise, it would be so cold and dark at night that I would have to search for a long time. Special thanks to him, Pan Xiaodong! !
Enjoy the minibar in your room: there are cookies, snacks, and my favorite wasabi macadamia nuts from Sam’s Supermarket!

msg:The room was clean, tidy, big and comfortable. The waiters are super friendly, the environment is beautiful, and it’s a great place to relax and unwind. The hotel is said to have been built many years ago. There was a slight musty smell when I first entered, but it became acceptable after ventilation. Other devices have no problem using it. The fruit biscuits and sugar water were given as a gift on the first day of check-in, but for some reason they were no longer available if I extended my stay. During the National Day, the hotel has a lot of activities, including handicrafts, small kitchens, and water battles. Experience each project, time flies by. There are also arrangements for outdoor activities, including marathons and hiking, which have given us a taste of them all. The funniest thing is that my husband took the wrong route and took a professional hiking route. The last kilometer was really difficult because it was a primitive, sandy road. The child fell and broke his knee. The volunteer medical team dealt with it in time. It is a pity that the European town is under construction, and I heard that it will not be completed until next year.

Checked in very late, around 12 o'clock in the morning. After entering the room, the front desk arranged for the guest room aunt to deliver minibar snacks, drinks, and welcome fruits...
The scariest thing is that I suddenly heard a rustling sound inside the trash can! I thought it was a mouse, but luckily it was a cockroach. After running out, he got into the gap under the table. I called the front desk and the guest room aunt was sent over calmly. A broom is all it takes...
I came here ten years ago, but it is not what it used to be. It is now a large construction site, and the construction area is mixed with scenic spots and public areas. It is best not to come here in the near future.

There was a strong damp musty smell, which was unbearable. I didn’t get to enjoy the European town decoration, so the hotel just added a carousel and a wave pool, which made the children very happy. The scenery on the viewing platform of the ecological park is not bad, but the surrounding facilities such as dining are not complete. The hotel's buffet breakfast does not have many categories and the products are average. The overall feeling is average.

Later, when it was necessary to change the room, they responded in a timely manner, and the efficiency was very high [strong]

Stay in the hotel and enjoy unlimited outdoor and indoor swimming pools. No matter it is sunny or raining, you can swim from morning to play. It is so comfortable to play like this in summer. Moreover, the pool water is very clean. There is a pool party at 4 pm every day. When there are few people, the children will get prizes as long as they go to participate. The children are very happy.

The hotel also gives free tickets to the Jiulong Lake Ecological Park, you can drive up the mountain, overlooking the Jiulong Lake from the mountain, it is very beautiful.

The hotel will also have many activities suitable for children to experience, such as making ocean bottles, making sushi or baking, watching the sunset on the top of the mountain, outdoor lawn movies...

The hotel's breakfast restaurant is not big, but it has a rich variety. I have tried the Italian restaurant and Chinese restaurant in the hotel, and the Chinese restaurant will be better.
For catering, we recommend the first canteen or the sea living room.

The rooms are large, all equipped with bathtubs, complete facilities, and 4 types of pillows to choose from. But after all, it is an old hotel, and charging sockets are not too convenient.

Aranya is stationed, and the entire European town is still being repaired. The European town is one step at a time, which is very suitable for taking pictures and checking in. The project is estimated to be completed after October, and there will be more playable parts in the future.

The service is very attentive and meticulous! Called the day before check-in to confirm details. When I learned that someone among us had a birthday, they enthusiastically helped me decorate the room and upgraded the room. As soon as the children arrived at the hotel, they became little chefs and made sushi. Xiao A’s ice cream is delicious! I arrived at the hotel late due to work reasons, and they arranged a car to pick me up at the subway station. During dinner, the beautiful Ms. Huang from the housekeeping depar**ent even made a special trip to give me a delicious birthday cake! What a surprise! After dinner, all the friends, big and small, went swimming together. There are not many people, and the afternoon sun heats up the water, which is very comfortable! After swimming, I got another surprise when I returned to the room! The considerate waitress brought hot red dates and longan syrup, as well as yogurt and fruit!
After getting up and having a rich breakfast the next morning, we went to the ecological park. You can take the hotel shuttle or drive yourself. The ecological park has a beautiful environment and is very suitable for hiking. Children love this large jungle maze the most! Wandering around inside is a completely different thinking angle than playing the maze from a God's perspective on paper. It's really a good immersive experience in a puzzle game! We went down the mountain to have lunch in the owners’ cafeteria, and used the vouchers given by the hotel to eat well. When checking out, the beautiful lady gave the children carousel tickets. All the kids, big and small, had a great time and went home satisfied! I look forward to visiting the European town after it is renovated.

msg:The hotel has convenient public transportation, is surrounded by mountains and rivers, and has beautiful scenery and environment. The building is in the style of a European castle, making people feel like they are in a foreign country in Europe. Although the hotel has been built for many years, the maintenance of the facilities is still in place. The room is spacious, clean and hygienic. We booked a balcony room with a view of the river. The view is amazing! The customer service staff are warm and courteous, and take the initiative to help carry luggage to the room, and also thoughtfully deliver desserts and fruits. The hotel has indoor and outdoor swimming pools, where you can enjoy swimming. It's a pity that the European town next to the hotel is still closed for renovation, and there are no places to take pictures and check in and children to play.

msg:We bought a package ticket, including breakfast, dinner and meal coupons.
Service: The service of the hotel is first-class. To be honest, it is similar to the domestic five-star chain hotels. After the entry, a person will take you to the room and introduce the hotel's entertainment facilities, children's activities, and package content one by one. Very sweet. Because there are more mosquitoes in the mountains, the front desk of the hotel also thoughtfully prepared mosquito repellent and mosquito repellent stickers. All the service staff are very polite, and they always answer with a smile when asked. The hotel is a parent-child hotel. In the afternoon, there are DIY meals for children, swimming pool activities, sunset watching activities, and outdoor movie watching activities in the evening. They are all well arranged, which is very good.
Facilities: The hotel is a bit old after all, and some plugs in the rooms have no power supply, but the hotel is still clean and the rooms are very large. Compared with the small rooms of domestic five-star hotel chains, it is very large and very good. And this price is very cost-effective.
Food: The package ticket this time includes breakfast and dinner. There are a lot of people at breakfast, and the hotel service is a little bit behind. After the people left and cleaned up, we were allowed to sit, but no tableware was given. We asked the waiter to put the tableware, and the waiter put chopsticks With the spoon, I said can I give the knife and fork again? Did the waiter say you need it? Isn't this a buffet breakfast of Chinese and Western food? Why not? At that time, we took bread and butter, and the employees also saw it, so how to spread butter? However, the overall breakfast variety is also rich and good. Let’s talk about dinner, we ate Chinese food. There should be a wedding in the Chinese restaurant that day, and then we moved to a banquet hall with package tickets or at our own expense. ...
But in terms of food, the ice cream included in the park package is very delicious, and it is also very user-friendly. There is an ice cream holder, which will not drip everywhere, which is very good. There is also the first canteen in the park, which is rich and thrifty.
There are also many farms outside the hotel, and the price is very nice, so although it is in the mountains, it doesn't feel inconvenient or not fun at all.
Finally, there is the scenic spot of the hotel. You can go there by car, but you must drive. Otherwise, you will be exhausted from walking. Children like it very much, and adults like it very much. In this summer vacation of retaliatory consumption, there are very few people, very comfortable, and very beautiful. . It is a very complete mountain forest scenic spot.
If there is a chance later, I will go again.

msg:The lobby manager of the Princess Hotel is super enthusiastic and nice. I wanted to say that during the summer vacation, there are too many people and there will be some things that I can’t take care of, but there is no one at all. I greet every child and family with enthusiasm. It’s really a comfortable time. experience. Tell me about your favorite points!
1. The bathtub in the room is very good, and the water drains super fast. The child Hanke brought a medicine bag to soak in it. The effect is very good, not to mention the recovery, but it is basically cured. I also tried the hot spring downstairs, and the big pool is also very good. That is, the water temperature will not be very high
2. The water quality of the swimming pool is very good, and there are some small water games, which are highly involved, and the children will be very happy
3. Watching the sunset and checking in at the ecological park are also very considerate. The surrounding towns are under maintenance, and the hotel’s activities are well arranged. The most important thing is that every staff member is very considerate and sprays mosquito repellent water on everyone before departure.
4. The children also experienced the activity of making sushi rolls by hand, which was very rewarding
5. The stewed sugar water at night is a plus, you can experience the happiness of soaking in the bathtub and eating dessert
6. The merry-go-round has already finished work, and I even opened the door to let the children experience the whole racecourse by themselves. The children are really happy and flattered. The romance of choosing horses and spinning at will is realized here. The sister in the lobby is so gentle and pampered Baby.

Above, if children like to play in water and like some small activities, I can recommend you to come!

msg:A stay that exceeded expectations.
The hotel is a bit old by visual inspection, but it can be seen that the maintenance of the hotel is very careful, and the sanitation management is in place. Even the European-style crystal lamps on the corridor are all polished and shiny. The water quality of the swimming pool is also good. I don’t think the water is irritating when I have rhinitis. The pool is 1.4 meters deep. If children can’t swim and are not tall enough, it’s best to wear armbands when going out.
The most unexpected thing is the service. All the waiters are very polite, they will answer every question, and they will find a way to arrange it if there is a request. After checking in in the afternoon, there are some small activities that are arranged reasonably. In the evening, a car will be arranged to take the guests up the mountain to watch the sunset, which is very beautiful.
This meal only tried the No. 1 canteen in the town, which is relatively economical and affordable, and the products are quite satisfactory. Hotel breakfast is also quite satisfactory.
Both adults and children played very relaxed and comfortable during this trip, and I feel that I can do it twice~

msg:My family and I affirmed the hotel's management service model:
1. What impressed me the most was that the front desk manager Huang personally led my family from the front desk to the room and introduced the relevant project information of the hotel. He has professional and senior business capabilities.
2. In the front desk depar**ent, including the front desk receptionist, concierge staff and team members, the service attitude is amiable. I believe there must be regular service training.
3. In the catering depar**ent, the cost of breakfast varieties is not low, and the number of internal splits is estimated to be fifty or sixty; It is slow, but the speed has improved after communication. The Chinese restaurant is busy at dinner time, and the manpower is a little tight. I believe that the service can be improved. Among them, there is an experienced male manager in the western restaurant, with a rich and magnetic voice.
4. The housekeeping depar**ent is warm and courteous. The hotel also gave fruit, yogurt and sugar water as gifts. When the waiter gave the fruit, he confirmed that he entered the room after three presses and three reports. The hygiene of the room is also very good, that is, the supervisor needs to pay more attention during the rounds The corner position of the balcony.
5. In terms of the recreation depar**ent, the swimming pool is well staffed, the environment is beautiful, clean and hygienic, and the waiters responsible for providing the locker keys are warm and courteous.
We look forward to seeing you again after the upgrade of the European town!

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first: the surrounding environment is really good, the room is also big, 65 square meters is very suitable for a family and parent-child living, my little YY likes it very much, the hotel has relatively complete entertainment facilities, and I have experienced a mini kitchen, a carousel, and a special car to watch the sunset on the top of the mountain The pick-up and drop-off service is warm, considerate and thoughtful. A small YY gift was given at the door, a simple fruit platter was served at noon, and three desserts were given in the evening, which tasted good. The buffet in the morning was rich and complete. Disadvantages: There are basically no supporting businesses in the surrounding area, only a market, sometimes it is inconvenient to buy some daily necessities, there are too few options for Chinese food and dinner, there are only an Italian restaurant and a Chinese restaurant in the hotel, and there is a South canteen outside, these Although it is inconvenient, it is acceptable. The biggest disadvantage is that the smell of methanol in the room is strong, especially when the air conditioner is turned on when you first enter the workshop. The children and grandma didn't sleep well all night. Summary: The overall is very good, except for the strong smell of the room, the rest are close to perfect. My little girl is very satisfied and reluctant to leave. I also think it is good, but the grandma of the child thinks it is not good.

Ctrip's customer service was very responsible to help coordinate and solve it properly, and recommended the Princess Hotel. I have been to this hotel several times before, the hardware facilities are the same as before, the swimming pool is big, and the rooms are big, but the service of the hotel is the best this time, maybe because the hotel has changed the management group. The waiters in the entire hotel attach great importance to the needs of the guests, with a good attitude, and try their best to meet the requirements of the guests; the hotel also arranges many parent-child activities, suitable for bringing children. I was very satisfied with my two-night stay! Will choose again next time.

The young ladies and brothers who serve are very good and really feel at home. To emphasize, I am not Tor. It's the first time I've come here for consumption. It used to be a hot hotel, but now it may not be as crowded as before. I came here today because there was an order meeting, and there was a lot of people. In the lobby with a huge flow of people, the young ladies and brothers at the front desk have a very patient and meticulous service attitude. I think if it is five-star, it will definitely exceed this price 💰.

The lady at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. She also took the initiative to upgrade to a VIP lake view room type. The room is 70 square meters, spacious and luxurious. There are many things to do in the small town. Because of time constraints, I only took the small train to the King Hotel. I feel very unique and very satisfied.

But there is no usb charging plug in the room, and the supporting data cable needs to be charged for 5 yuan for 12 hours!
The buffet can be paid on-site, the price is the same 168 per person, there are not many types, the supply of salmon sashimi is limited, and it closes at 8:30!
Unlimited outdoor swimming pools, indoor heated swimming pools, health bubble pools, fish therapy pools and acupuncture baths, etc., need to walk for 10 minutes to reach the entrance, and the swimming pools are not equipped with large towels, so they can only be used from the room in advance, and there are only a few One pool is open, but the other pools have no water. The changing room is too small, and there is no place to hang clothes, which is inconvenient!
Most of the European towns are under repair, many shops are not open, and because of the construction in many places, the road surface is not smooth, and it is the only way for the hotel to go to the swimming pool

There are a lot of swimming pools, several with constant temperature, outdoor, there are many children's amu*****t projects, and there are open-air movies, children have a lot of fun. The overall feeling is a bit of the grandeur of Luigi's castle in the game, and the kids feel like they have entered the castle in the game. European towns are great. The small train takes it to the top of the mountain, and one hour is not enough to play. Hesitating to make temporary arrangements, leaving in a hurry, golf and some recreational items have not been experienced, maybe I will go again when I have a chance to be bored.

msg:The second time I visited the Kowloon Lake Princess Hotel, the European design style of the resort area has nothing to say. My daughter said she liked it very much.
[Ctrip Butler Service]: As soon as you enter the lobby, you will be led to the exclusive area by Ctrip's in-store butler to check in. You don't need to queue at the front desk or crowd with others, which is a very satisfying experience. After completing the formalities, Ctrip's butler kindly added WeChat, introduced the activities during the National Day of the Jiulong Lake Resort, and said that if you need services, you can contact WeChat at any time.
[Hardware]: Ctrip's housekeeper took us to the room, a comfortable large balcony, a reclining chair, cloakroom, washroom, bathtub, shower, and everything we thought and did not think of is presented in front of us. This is the hardware that a resort hotel should have!
【Dining】: Dinner buffet at an Italian restaurant. Although the average age of all the service staff is relatively old, but the service awareness is very full! Everyone responds to their needs. The most surprising thing is that the daughter went to pick up the food by herself. When she came back, the waiter took the initiative to help her bring the food to the table. Having eaten buffets in many big-name five-star hotels, I have never seen such personalized service for children. I am very grateful.
[Park Facilities]: Some of the parks are being renovated and upgraded, the facilities and equipment are well maintained, and the buildings are very foreign.

Under the policy background of "advocating not to leave Sui", I will choose to stay here again.

European town style, white clouds and blue sky, every photo is a blockbuster. I chose the Longhu special room, and the receptionist Miss Zhang Jiayu recommended a Japanese-style room for us very carefully. The room is clean, with high privacy, it feels like going to Kyoto. We sleep on tatami mats, three of us, one and one small. The room has two indoor and outdoor pools, and we enjoyed a milk bath, which is more comfortable in winter. The room package includes meals in the spa club downstairs, and the meals are also good. There are many in-person activities in the hotel, princess coronation parade, children's trampoline, outdoor movies, graffiti, small train. We stayed for three days and two nights and didn't want to leave. It was a trip with a very high cost performance and a good experience. Special thanks to Miss Zhang Jiayu for her warm reception. Worth coming back next time😃

Because it is a staggered trip after the holiday, there are not many people. The hotel also upgraded us to a water view room. The room is very clean. Except for no refrigerator, other facilities are perfect. It includes two breakfasts. It is not very rich but manageable It's okay to be full, but the extra unit price of 98 is not worth the price. European towns and hotel swimming pools are included, and the indoor temperature is still constant, and the environment is very good. The weather was a little cooler and we only went to the health pool to soak. Generally speaking, the hotel is a little old, but the environmental services are very good. I haven't seen the hotel for a long time and the waiter smiles at you. The front desk and the manager provide you with intimate guidance and service, and will come again for this service experience.

Driving to the hotel, you need to scan the code and check the nucleic acid status for 24 hours. The epidemic prevention work is very rigorous, which makes people feel very relieved. As soon as I got off the bus, the staff helped with the luggage, and also led to help with check-in, which was very worry-free and considerate. I booked the Kupan parent-child room. The room is very large, and there are slides, swings and small tents. The baby can play all day in the room. The most suitable for summer is to play in the water. After a short rest, you can change your clothes and go into the water. There are indoor and outdoor swimming pools, warm water and cold water, and small fish ponds. My baby is relatively young, and the warm water pool is very friendly to him, and he is not afraid of getting too cold. There are also rose pools, milk pools and mint pools indoors for you to choose from. The best thing is that there are very few people, and it is the most suitable during the epidemic.
Dinner was settled at Taoyuan Chinese Restaurant, and the products were also good. Every dish I ordered was in line with the taste. After the meal, we went to the children's playground to check in. Only we and another sister were playing, and it was crazy! Go outside to see the lights, take a walk, and the beautiful day is over!
The old man is very satisfied with the hotel booked this time. He said that he will wait for the next time the park is renovated and then revisit it. Overall, the service is good, and the hotel is great!

The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are comfortable, the service is thoughtful, and you can enjoy all kinds of photos, games, food, and pools in European towns. It is quite worthwhile to come here this time! I hope that after the upgrade and renovation is completed, it will give people a richer play experience!

Unfortunately, there are no commercial facilities around, only a few farms. There are only a few stores in European towns, which are relatively deserted.

Ctrip members also gave us fruit, which the baby ate immediately. The parent-child room is very good value, the layout is very childish, and children can play in it for a long time. Although part of the town is being renovated, there are not many tourists, so it is more suitable for children to play. The hotel gave a children's park play coupon, worth 50 yuan per time, the baby had a good time and was very happy. The buffet breakfast is also very rich, with many foods suitable for children. The indoor and outdoor swimming pools are very popular with children. It is recommended that adults and children bring swimming suits, swimming caps and swimming rings to play. When you enter the parent-child room, you will receive a gift, and you will also receive a small gift when you check out. Worth to bring children.

Breakfast ends at 10:00. At 9:30 there was nothing left. There is also a great smell in the room. The so-called European town is just two streets away. I don't know, where did this so-called five-star come from? Who will be fooled.

European towns are relatively small, many buildings are being repaired, and photos are more photogenic.
Indoor swimming pools and small fish ponds are the baby's favorites, and they have to play once a day. The outdoor swimming pool is too sunny, and there are fewer people to go to.
The massage level is very high, the price is very high, and the elderly like it very much.
The service attitude of several Chinese and Western restaurants is very good, the price is not expensive, and the taste of the dishes is OK.

They specially got off the car to help us open the door, and also greeted politely. What's even more surprising is that the front desk staff has a super friendly attitude. They not only upgraded the room for us for free, introduced the locations of activities in the European town in detail, but also had someone take us to the room, and then they always greeted our needs and raised our needs. Immediate response and solution, great. The whole hotel is very clean, even the balcony of the room is spotless, stunned! The swimming pool in the hotel is big enough and the water is clean. Although there are a lot of people swimming, there is no feeling of "dipping dumplings". A very comfortable hotel stay experience.

As soon as I entered the room, there was a big damp and musty smell. I immediately opened the balcony door to ventilate, thinking it would be better in the future. Yes, it turned out to be very smelly until I went to bed at night. The sheets and quilts were also a little damp. I could smell it when I walked out of the corridor. I should have changed rooms as soon as possible. I really recommend removing this carpet. , it won't be so wet if you replace it with marble. You can see traces of damage and dust in the corners of the wall. There is a small strong in the bathroom. It is recommended to change the door of the small room to the toilet to a sliding door. What did you think at the time? Actually, the decoration style and the overall environment are good, but the maintenance is too poor. We live on the first floor. I don't know if this is the case upstairs. Breakfast and indoor pool are ok

You can check in if you have a room in the morning. It rains in the afternoon but there are indoor warm bubble pools and indoor swimming pools to play. It is very convenient to walk from the room.

The layout of the parent-child room is very cute. There are slides in the room. You can have entertainment without going out. The children who gave the tickets to the children's castle also had a good time.
The breakfast is quite satisfactory and the variety is relatively complete, and the time span is relatively reasonable. Service staff are more enthusiastic.
Special thanks to Xiaowei, the vip customer service at the reception, who is polite and warm, and can answer any questions in a timely manner.

2. A voucher of 138 was added for the buffet dinner, which is expensive. There is not much to eat inside, three adults and one child do not eat much.
3. The bubble pool is very dirty, the swimming pool is very cold, and the optional bubble pool is very small. If you don't go for ten minutes, go back to the hotel to take a bath. Because there are not many and small pools, men and women are together, and some old men are in the pool, which is particularly embarrassing.
4. There are only 2 booth activities, and the cute baby park is also very dirty, not as good as the usual shopping malls.
5. "I am a little chef" needs to make up money, and the spa in the spa also needs to make up money.

msg:This was a very beautiful vacation experience. We chose a two-bedroom suite with one living room. The room was very large, and the elderly were stunned. I don’t need to talk about the environment of European towns. Everyone knows it well. I especially want to praise the environment of the ecological park. In the morning, we took the sightseeing train to the observation deck of the ecological park at 9.45. A small natural lake with crystal clear blue water, so comfortable. Originally thought that 1 hour of play time was too long, but it was not enough to really stroll around. Next time we come back, we will definitely choose to walk.

I called the front desk to deal with it, but the stench still persisted for a few hours... I had no choice but to change to a twin room. . . Forced to accept ~ I can accept the old hotel, but the sanitation is not so bad ~ The first trip on New Year's Day, a frightening trip ~ At the end of the check-out at the front desk, there is actually a thing called "remarkable and polite"? ! Really long time to see ~ I hope the next traveler thinks twice! This time the princess room is very impressive~

This is my first choice for a hotel vacation in winter. Fortunately, it did not disappoint me, and it is very clean and comfortable. Also, the service attitude of the staff here is very good, and the VIP exclusive customer service Xiaolin is also thoughtful. This arrangement instantly improves the goodwill of the hotel a little bit.

Booked two royal deluxe rooms, the front desk upgraded us to royal water view rooms, and they are connected together, very intimate, there are not only small fish kiss pools indoors, children love to play, the indoor swimming pool is also very large, so afraid of us The black man was too friendly. I had afternoon tea at the Long Bar German Restaurant. The beer and pork knuckles were very good. The dinner was eaten at the Chinese restaurant. The quality and low price was affirmed by the whole family. I did not expect the restaurants in the scenic area to be able to do it. It's cheap and delicious, great! The only downside is that it’s a bit far from the room to the swimming pool. It takes five minutes. If you can open the entrance close to the lobby, it would be great. The epidemic is still repeated and you can’t leave Guangzhou. This is also a good choice.

The fly in the oin**ent is that the room has some peculiar smell, and there is no warm air in the weather of more than 10 degrees. But these are negligible in the face of attentive service. Perfect for a family outing when it's warm. Can only stay for one day due to other things. The children didn't have enough to live, and they were arguing that they would come to play next time. Give a thumbs up to the housekeeper for her attentive and thoughtful service throughout.

msg:I heard a long time ago that the Princess Hotel of Kowloon Lake was unable to leave Guangzhou this year due to the epidemic, so I just went to experience it. The hotel is European style. I booked the little yellow duck room. The room is very large, more than 70 square meters. There are also children's swings and slides in the room. The children like it very much. Dining in Princess Town, there are Chinese and German restaurants, Western food is good, and sausages are very authentic. The children liked the stickers in the bathroom. I asked the front desk and said that there were no more. I was a little disappointed. Later, the waiter Gao Peixia specially sent them to the room, thank you very much! Princess Town also has a large children's playground, with trampolines, wave pools and slides. It is very comfortable with few people and large space. It is a very warm and comfortable suburban trip, suitable for children. On the way back, I passed by Sujun Strawberry Farm. The milk strawberries are big and sweet. It only takes more than 40 minutes to return to Guangzhou city.

服務：本次最滿意的就是服務，彌補了硬件上的不足，無論是餐廳還是客户關係方面的服務人員，都很熱情貼心，小朋友住不慣親子房，服務人員還專門幫忙不厭其煩地看了七八間房，確保讓小朋友安心睡覺，還送了小朋友很多小禮物，感激不盡；
餐飲：意大利餐廳踩雷了，剛好碰上有團餐，2個小時都沒上完菜，披薩應該是中廚廚師做的，齁鹹…湖畔餐廳還不錯，攜程和**上有套餐會比較划算。

酒店所有的設施風格一致，給人很温馨的感覺，設施都很乾凈和方便。房間寬敞明亮，該有的設施都有。吧枱小食、水果質量和味道都很好，甚至還有糖水，可惜我們忘記喝了。
酒店的早餐可選的品類非常多，味道也都很好。我們在樓下的意大利餐廳點了意麪、披薩和沙拉。披薩是先做的，要等四十多分鐘，如果着急，建議選擇其它菜品。我們是以放鬆休閑的心態來遊玩的，所以很有耐心等待，最後證明我們等待是值得的，我們點的每一樣菜的味道都不錯。
酒店有室內和室外游泳池，可惜室內游泳池最近在裝修，暫時不開放，據説6月份會開放，室外游泳池倒是有不少小朋友在游泳，水質看起來不錯。酒店門口就有一個住店可免費玩的旋轉木馬，上午不斷地有小朋友在玩，小朋友喜歡得不得了。
酒店後面也有一些場所在裝修，我們沒有去探索，工作人員告訴我們大約6月會裝修好對外開放。
酒店附近有九龍湖生態公園，環境非常好，有好幾個不錯的遊玩項目，包括皮划艇、金錢迷宮、親子釣魚、環湖徒步等。因為小朋友比較小，我們衹玩了金錢迷宮，九龍湖的景色非常好，本來我們想去環湖徒步的，不過近期雨水較多，有一些棧道暫時封閉了，走到半路就沒法走，衹好折返，希望過幾天天氣好轉會重新開放。公主酒店離九龍湖生態公園有3公里的路程，酒店有車接送，可以免費遊玩，自己開車過去生態公園也是免費的。
總體而言，這次遊玩完全超出我們的預期，小朋友甚至哭着不肯回家。下次有時間我們還會再回來遊玩。

3，下午三點多去游泳，太陽曬了一天，室外游泳池水温正舒服，小朋友也不會覺得水冷
4，帶娃走了九龍湖邊棧道，爬了山，看了夕陽西下，對於想帶娃鍛鍊，或者是親近自然的話，是個很不錯的選擇
5，室內泳池水温相對冷，泡的池子也很少，衹有五個左右，有的還沒有水，想泡温泉的話，肯定不是一個好的選擇

3.舞台的親子游戲，主持人直接忽略1歲的孩子，完全當看不到，不讓參與遊戲。
4.小童遊樂場的環境，空氣不流通，很悶，場地也很小。
5.室內游泳池的更衣室，非常簡陋，不是按照正常使用來設計的時候，連個掛鈎都沒有，而且超級多蜘蛛網，我以為進了盤絲洞！

早餐不算好，雖然是在意大利餐廳，餐品到裝潢卻一點也沒有意大利風格（巴瑪火腿、帕瑪臣芝士、橄欖油/黑醋配麵包/餅條、卡邦尼意粉之類的都沒有，虛有其表）
因為歐式街道很多都在施工，有點煞風景；直通車是坐私家車只來一程前往太和站，吃晚飯得自己打車，預早店去，非常不便（位置比較像鄉村郊外的地方，基本很難找餐館吃飯，酒店不提供晚飯，唯一的中菜館貴且菜品不好）

——幾乎每位服務人員都是柔聲細語的，管家服務也為我們爭取到了一些意想不到的待遇和驚喜。很愉快，很休閑的一次度假之旅。
——度假村的餐廳雖然衹剩兩家，但是出品個人感覺都非常不錯，是實實在在油鹽醬醋的烹飪菜式，不是那種大眾調料包的味道。值得一讚！
——可惜園區正在升級改造，有明顯的施工現場。待升級改造、設施更新後，一定再去一次。o（^▽^）o

🔔服務：入住當天由於客流量大，服務員會分散辦公，避免人流聚集，不用全部人聚在一個地方。而且每個房間都會有一個專人負責，我們是許小姐負責的，隨叫隨到，儘快解決我們的問題，服務真的很棒棒，還有酒店贈送的小禮物，小孩子也是喜歡得不離手啊😄
🍃環境：整個莊園都是歐式的，讓小朋友活在童話世界裏，晚上還有公主的小劇場。
🧹衞生：居住的環境也很棒，大致床鋪廁所，小至地壇桌子，都很乾凈。
🚗 交通：我們是從荔灣出發，自駕遊就1個小時就到了，非常的方便。

但是服務對於五星來説還是有差距，水療會所更衣比一般游泳池差多了…轉不開身，沒有掛鈎…
所謂音樂劇吧，就是兩個人跳了個舞…
泡泡就比較吸引小朋友啦…
周邊也沒啥好吃的…

除了上面的小細節外，其他挺好的，攜程的工作人員挺貼心的。

msg:優點：
1、性價比是可以的，房價不貴。
2、生日還送了一個大蛋糕，份量很足還是水果夾心的。
3、設施可以。水療館很齊全：户外泳池，室內恆温泳池、温泉、小童池，桑拿，挺不錯的，就是小童池有點點淺。還有籃球場、小童樂園。
缺點：
1、歐洲小鎮比較小，太多人拍婚紗照
2、小火車項目比較坑，2大1小170元自費把我們帶到另一個酒店（國王酒店）參觀，做營銷還要客人自費也是夠了。
3、早餐太差，而且餐廳很小，座位不夠，露天的桌子曬到飛起！
4、來這邊真的沒啥好吃的東西，附近也沒有啥好吃的。
5、停車位太少，非常緊張。

很好的假期。也幫我們升級了房間。謝謝你們。

msg:第一次來公主酒店，非常適合親子家庭遊。新年很多活動，新年市集巡遊飄雪，小朋友玩的不肯走，水療館的泳池泡池，老少咸宜。小鎮遊客不多，很多網紅打卡點，隨手一拍都是歐式大片，很好看。愛攝影的朋友們千萬別錯過！幾個建議，電梯需要調整，開門時間太短，經常夾到人；恆温泳池多配備一些毛巾，塑料袋等簡易用品更好；小童樂園略顯老舊，波波球不夠多，很多修復痕跡不知道是否能夠確保安全。

酒店有免費班車在新和地鐵A出口服務，衹需提前一天預訂即可。即使衹有我們訂車，酒店也會派車出來接我們，而且是別克商務車哦。司機師傅全程禮貌服務。
到酒店後也很快安排，人性化，假期酒店爆滿收拾房間需要時間，但酒店不會讓客户乾等。靈活可以先讓客户遊玩套票。待有房會致電通知入住。
每個小朋友會派送泡泡。
不過歡迎水果就很一般啦，那個酸奶是冰凍得太硬了，這個如果改一下會更好。
我們是騎士房，給小公主加冕過程我小孩要上廁所耽誤了一些時間，但所有工作人員也是很有耐心等候，不會黑臉，謝謝大家理解。而且我們是基本享受一對一服務，還給小朋友送禮物，小朋友很開心。
房間大大的，也挺乾淨的。有很多玩具，小孩子待一天都很有趣，很開心。
園區有餐廳，價格相對園區和春節期間來説是可以接受的。如果服務費考慮改為百分之十會比較好。
服務不會很讓人有不舒服的感覺。
園區以小朋友為主，親子游不錯的地方。值得推薦。
如果房間配上一次性刮鬍刀和潤膚露那就完美了。

國際餐飲自助早晚餐吃的東西一般，而且基本上都冷了，保温措施做得不好。晚上基本衹能吃自助火鍋，和現煮的湯麪。
園區中餐廳和龍吧德國餐很不錯，中餐廳分量足，德國肘子很正宗！

公主小鎮環境很好，空氣清新，遊人稀少，歐式建築風格比較有特色。

入住和退房時有一對一接待，工作人員熱情而禮貌，服務細緻而周到。

雖然是很多年的酒店了，但內外部設施維護得很好。傢俱略顯陳舊，但清潔很到位。房間隔音效果挺好。

房間裏各種需求物品一應俱全，親子房空間很大，有各種嶄新而可愛的玩偶，還有帳篷和滑梯，小朋友玩得很開心。建議增加個樂高積木桌更完美。

早餐品種豐富，性價比比較高。

從環境、衞生、服務各個角度綜合考慮，是相當滿意和舒適的。

msg:趁着寒假帶着孩子來花都九龍湖遊玩，第一次來這裏的感覺，哇，好漂亮啊，到處都是歐陸風的建築，天氣正好，很適合出去外拍，多給孩子留下好看的照片！

從廣州市區來九龍湖很方便，我們可以乘搭地鐵再轉搭酒店的專車過來，整個流程大概一個半小時能來到了。

我們在攜程上訂的是騎士夢幻豪華家庭房，還包含了騎士加冕的儀式，還有美茵河貢多拉遊船，在來訪之前，孩子滿是期待。

首先，我們一家大概二點多來到酒店，先在前台登記了健康行程還有穗康碼後，就正式登記入住，還有漂亮的小姐姐，帶着我們去五樓的親子樓層。

進入房間後，最興奮的是孩子了，因為有一張大大的汽車床，還有帳篷，有滑梯，有木馬，有星空燈，有各式各樣的玩具，還有大大小小的娃娃。這房間真的很讓小孩子興奮，有樂迪的棉拖鞋，還有豬豬俠的浴袍，還有一個大浴缸，還有特別為孩子定製的刷牙工具，就算出門在外，也會讓孩子喜歡上刷牙。

客服小姐姐和我們約定了03:30，進行騎士加冕活動。讓我們提前五分鐘下去就可以了。因為孩子期待着，所以我們都提前了十分鐘下來大堂！

大堂上早已為小孩鋪墊了紅地毯。在地毯的盡頭，已經有一位公主和一位皇子在等候着我們了！然後陸陸續續大堂多了很多工作人員，哇，小孩越來越緊張了，因為今天的主角衹有我們家孩子一位，所以他比較羞澀。然後，孩子爸爸和公主一起牽着去地毯的盡頭進行加冕儀式。加冕儀式很多道具，有着披風，有寶劍，有的盾牌，還有護甲。最後還有一份宣誓詞：我要做一個勇敢善良的人……很長很長我忘記拍視頻了，因為當時作為大人的我也很感動。

在加冕儀式結束後我們帶着孩子在九龍湖到處遊覽，穿着披風戴着面具的孩子，他真的太開心了，因為有很多注目他的目光，羨慕他的小孩，這個套餐推薦小學以下的孩子。

而且因為準備春節了，這裏也很有特色，很合適過年假期來這裡帶上家人度假，有充氣的大大的招財貓，有紅色黃，充氣的大老虎。還有各種各樣可愛的卡通形象，卡通的娃娃海報，在這裏，享受着慢生活，慢慢地拍照，慢慢地瀏覽，慢慢地和家人在一起。

不知不覺，我們來到美茵河邊乘坐貢多拉遊船，實在太爽了，第一次坐上這個船，暢遊這麼長的河，一來一回大概10分鐘左右，足以拍下過百張照片，衹因這裏太美了！除了這些設施，這裏還有小童遊樂館，還有蹦蹦床館，還有草叢迷宮。還有旋轉木馬，還有海盜船，真的樂而忘返的一天，一切為了孩子，為了留下美好回憶和時光。

除了這些，這裏還很人性化的設定了華潤萬家超市，這裏日常所需的商品都應有盡有，價格和市內一樣，沒有溢價，這真的太便民了。

而餐飲方面，晚餐我們是在龍吧進餐的，也是包含在套餐內的，兩份主食味道還不錯，湯也好喝，衹是果盤太大了，吃不完有點浪費了，下次希望適當減量，以免浪費。除了晚餐，這套餐還包含了家庭自助早餐，早餐種類不算多，但孩子吃得也很開心。

吃飽後，我們再次在九龍湖到處閑逛，呼吸新鮮空氣，能在這裏和家人共度美好的兩天，真的太開心了，套餐價格也不貴，物超所值。

最後回程我們是預訂了13:10分的酒店專車，目的地可以是新和地鐵站或者機場，主要是住客這趟交通費都是包含的，十分合適廣州市內的夥伴搭地鐵轉駁過來，也合適外地遊客來遊玩。

衞生：衞生也還行，不偏不過。但我們定了兩個房間，一間的拖鞋都發黴了。
環境：有點失望，房間還行，但周邊沒有什麼亮點。歐洲小鎮充其量衹能算十字路口。游泳池恆温的比較臟，户外的還算可以。小朋友玩的東西也少。
服務：我們定了兩個房間，一間房間的拖鞋發黴了，打電話讓送兩對新的過來，後來衹送了一對。因為是兒子接的，兒子跟服務員説是要兩對，她説沒有了。因為先生有事處理，大概12點多一點回到酒店，我帶兩小孩在酒店等他。電話總枱審批延遲退房，但總枱説客房緊張不能延遲，最晚12點半退（但我們隔壁的幾間房從我們入住到走都沒有人入住）。我跟總枱説那我們就12點半退（我一個人在大堂裏也不好帶兩小孩），總枱從12：10就開始打電話讓我們退房。
總體感覺比較差，不符合5星級的標準。
再説一下，早餐的種類比較少。對於5星級酒店來説咖啡是速溶的，那就過分了。
建議好好搞好服務和環境，不用用小禮品客户也會給5星好評！

msg:景點沒啥好逛，水療就幾個冷水池，衹有一個熱水池，泡沒一個小時就走了，七百多一間房一點都不值，房間一般不説，説給我升級豪華房，換得窗又小，光線也不好，牆紙好幾個地方都裂開了，服務也不好，給的香蕉蘋果也是爛的，還不如不給，別家酒店退房退按金用不了幾分鐘， 這個酒店就不是，下午六點了也沒給我退，打電話問説系統延遲，再打電話説我的房間在中餐廳消費了，我連那裡的中餐廳在哪都不知道，怎麼就消費了1500，就算消費了，也得打電話確認吧，一下午一個電話訊息都沒有，是不是我不打電話就不退我按金了，就這服務態度，誰還會去？

msg:首先，針對酒店住宿及住宿方面的服務值得肯定，這裏的五星好評是給住宿的：衞生整潔，設施齊全，房間大，難能可貴的是在入住時主動提出房間瑕疵並表示有任何不滿意可以換房。停車也很方便，公主加冕儀式也很到位，感謝相關的工作人員。早餐的自助餐也很不錯。
其次，針對旅遊區（小鎮）的經歷，僅在這裏做客觀分享，不做評價，因為可能有主管原因或有客觀原因沒有時間分清：
1.腳踏船的大叔人很好比較熱心
2.龍吧的下午茶和晚餐建議提前預約，免去製作等待時間。工作人員的態度很好。
3.中餐廳有15%服務費，會提前告知，不過整體價格不高，可以接受。上菜快。
4.10號樓附近的室內遊樂區沒什麼人較冷清，設施也是沒有完全開放，跳床價格是88，另強制額外交10元買防滑襪，工作人員周先生解釋稱雖然你第一次來，但是我沒有義務告知你要帶防滑襪，想玩必須買襪子，這是規定，其他你自己看着辦。我至今還在領悟他的教導。
5.在小鎮的禮品店買了一個小豬佩奇樓梯的玩具，價格肯定比外賣貴，個人可以接受。但是回到房間打開一看，裏面的玩具非常臟，由於已經準備退房，就沒有再追溯此事。回頭一想，可能是買到了曾經擺在外賣的樣品，又裝回盒子直接售賣了。

酒店的環境維護得相當不錯，衞生做得也很好，還收到了酒店的歡迎水果和酸奶，還有送給孩子的小禮物，服務非常周到。孩子在小鎮兩天一夜玩得也非常開心。一開始酒店還給我們的房型免費升級。但是我和老公都比較偏愛小鎮那邊的房間格調。接待我們的專員謝燕小姐姐也非常貼心地幫我們進行了房間調整，根據我們的喜好找到了一套我們非常滿意的房間。後來發現跟了我好幾年的梳子落在了原來的房間，謝燕小姐姐也很熱心地幫我們找了回來。還有我們在小鎮遊玩期間遇到的每個工作人員，都非常地熱情體貼，隨時提供需要的幫助，讓我們覺得這趟旅程非常地舒心。我們非常願意在這個酒店度過更多的紀念日，期待下一次。

msg:🚗 交通：方便，不錯，一路高速過來。
🧹衞生：也不錯，挺乾淨的，沒發現不好的地方。
🍃環境：環境很好，空氣也清新，最棒是兩個泳池，小孩子特喜歡，室內室外各一，但池底有小石頭，把閨女的腳趾都擦傷了，走路都痛😣再去游泳的要注意下了。
🔔服務：很棒，服務人員很主動，看得出來臨時工比較多，實習生也多，國慶期間的度假酒店都這樣，但真的服務主動態度好。

美中不足：如圖四，訂的是水景房，外面陽台看出去就是一棵樹，完全擋住了所有景色。家人勸説去換。我説不換了國慶期間再換都不知等到什麼時候有房（我和朋友同行一共四個家庭，我是最早拿到房間的一個，其餘等了半小時至一小時左右，我早拿到房小孩子可以先睡會，這也是比較幸運和不想再換的原因之一），但這房的景色着實令人掃興。水景房國慶期間也不便宜。

另外小鎮也的確是小，不用30分鐘都可以走得完，裏面設施還算豐富，運動小孩吃的等等都有配，也算是能樂呵樂呵一下。

總體來説，四星半。

對了，還有自助晚餐和早餐，早餐比晚餐好些，但其實也差不多，小孩半價，其實也不太值。不過國慶就這樣，能想到了，吐槽歸吐槽吧。

🧹衞生：不太滿意，估計是年代久遠的緣故，房間裏一些地方存在衞生死角。最誇張的是一樓早餐的地方，烤麪包的地方竟然可以看到小強🪳……
🍃環境：周邊環境宜人，也很安靜，隔河相望有20幾棟別墅
🔔服務：酒店服務人員還算熱情，攜程有專門入住的地方，但因為是假期，所以人多的時候也有些忙亂。辦理完有專人送到門口，介紹景區和酒店等。但這邊一樓早餐的服務太差了，根本沒有基本的服務意識。喝粥的碗沒有了，反映了半天，還是沒有，最後很多人用咖啡杯裝粥，你説這是五星級酒店服務嗎？我真的不信！
🏨設施： 因為酒店07年建造，所以設施陳舊感很重，房間地毯發黴的味道也不小。我這次的套房，除了大以外，我感覺很不值。。。

給五星是因為工作人員都很努力工作，但是硬件方面也需要適當投入更新。

下了訂單後，就有客服跟進，溝通方式令人很舒適，特別感謝vip客服小燕，大小事宜都與溝通，還安排得井井有條
粉紅夢幻般的公主房，一進房間，孩子們都很興奮，房間很大，可以跑着玩，房外面還有滑梯，孩子們玩得停不下來哈哈
最令人驚喜的是公主和騎士加冕儀式，户外應該接近40度的高温，工作人員穿戴整齊，還有穿着毛絨玩偶服的工作人員，列隊巡遊，把孩子們送去加冕儀式點，很感動，工作人員太辛苦了！
加冕儀式感滿滿，圓了孩子的公主夢和騎士夢，很開心🥳
小燕也就是白雪公主陪同着貢多拉遊船和旋轉木馬，還去龍吧餐廳幫我們打點一切……
酒店的工作人員都很和善，令人舒適的週末度假時光，下次還會再來，也會介紹朋友來！

因為我兒子還想住公主酒店，過些天還要過來，冒昧的給酒店提2點建議

1：騎士房小童床上有蟑螂，一個晚上有三次被蟑螂爬在臉上弄醒。 衞生要加強。
2：9月13號上午10-11點，游泳池男性工作人員服務惡劣。 當時租了游泳池的小船給孩子玩，就説你們一定要去小孩游泳池，不要在大人游泳池。 翻了船我沒空也沒有人撈你們，有什麼事不關我的事。

發現這樣的情況我馬上打電話給前台希望換房間，服務員快速的幫我換了一間大很多的房間，酒店態度很好，但是房間的熱水要開很久才有，浴室的淋浴頭水量很小，像是有故障的樣子。
另外一樓西餐廳自助餐128元一位，味道非常難吃。早餐如是。
第一次點評些這麼詳細，總之是價格又貴且非常不好的體驗。
