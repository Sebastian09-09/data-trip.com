msg:Excellent service from the front desk staff, who provided so much useful help with ordering things, locating lost deliveries, providing helpful nearby recommendations, couriering last min items etc. Beyond grateful! Hengshan Ascott is a wonderful tranquil serviced apartment set on beautiful eucalyptus tree-lined streets. Super comfortable stay for my family of 6 with spacious rooms, floor heating, large bathroom with both shower and bathtub; also loved the Dyson hairdryer, furry slippers, and Appelles toiletries for that touch of pampering.

msg:The hotel was exactly as expected, and I was able to stay on the first floor as I wished. I felt very good. The room is large, clean, stylish and quiet. There are green plants outside the window and the air is fresh. The hotel is very close to the subway, making it easy to go everywhere. The neighborhoods around Hengshan Road are excellent choices for city walks. Walking around makes you feel refreshed and unforgettable. It's just that the breakfast at this price is too perfunctory and seems to be outsourced. There is only one kind of porridge, and if you are lucky, you can get a stir-fried vegetable. The others are intestines, eggs, and several kinds of bread. There are only two kinds that can be heated, fruits, and vegetable salads. Barely full, the options are extremely limited, so those who have high breakfast requirements should choose carefully. The last two pictures attached are of the restaurant. You can see how small the dining table is. It is really not as good as the breakfast in a budget hotel. Also, check-in and check-out are quick, which is great. All in all, ignore the breakfast, the rest is perfect.

There is nothing, and it feels below the floor compared to the Zhujiang New Town in Guangzhou. The following is the shoddy filling of the coffee machine with instant coffee in a bag.

msg:The design is very suitable for short-term living, the room is bright, spacious and comfortable, and the necessary electrical appliances are readily available. Although the floor is low, it looks like a rich green, very beautiful and down-to-earth.
The surrounding environment of the hotel is very good, and the nucleic acid test is also very convenient. I have experienced the living environment and lifestyle of an old house in Shanghai. I like it.

msg:The TV in the room had two inexplicable failures and could not be adjusted. The service attitude of the engineer from the engineering depar**ent was very good and actively dealt with it. For apar**ent hotels that can cook, the lack of humanized design in the supporting facilities is a failure. I have given feedback to the front desk and hope that it can be changed. All in all, it's still good. By the way, there is another point. The price adjus**ent of the hotel is very exaggerated. In two days, the price can be reduced by nearly half from the original price, which makes the guests who book in advance very uncomfortable (for example, I am)

What is especially heartwarming is that the front desk greets meticulously when checking in, and after checking out, we also specially asked if an express delivery was missed by us. I will take care of everything, and I will come back to live in a larger room again in the future.

They will smile and say hello when they meet the cleaning aunt and the front desk. The young lady at the front desk also gave a small gift when checking out For children, the service is really attentive. The western restaurants around the hotel are more convenient to check in. The family thinks it is very good. The next time a family travels to Shanghai, it will be the first choice.
