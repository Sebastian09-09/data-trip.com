msg:A spring outing in the countryside🌿, full of fun in leisure☺️Everything you see is green mountains and green waters, and the natural vitality is all you feel🍁🪻🌻I like Ashan Daping so much, the service is good, the room is spacious, the room decoration is warm, and the selected bedding is comfortable. The tent room I tried this time has a great environment. It is surrounded by green trees and you can watch the sunrise from the tent. I love it! There was a heavy rain this night, but the room was not cold at all, and the sound insulation effect was acceptable👍It is the season to see maple leaves recently, and the patches of red maples and green maples and green dragons are so beautiful. Highly recommend a B&B worth staying in. It feels great to be completely integrated with nature👏

msg:The environment is beautiful, and the plants are carefully arranged. I believe there will be different scenery throughout the year. The food is also very good, the small hotpots for breakfast and dinner are generous in portions and the ingredients are fresh. The housekeepers and store clerks were very kind and helpful, and were busy picking up luggage to answer questions. If you want to escape from the city life, this is a quiet and comfortable place.
The disadvantage is that the location is a bit remote and there are no places to eat or play nearby. The mountainous path to and from the house where I live is quite difficult for the elderly. Hot water is relatively slow and requires "skills". The design of the bathing area and toilet is a bit inconvenient, and the privacy is a bit lacking. It's okay for a couple, but it will be inconvenient if there are children and the elderly together.

The coffee doesn't taste good, I suggest you choose better beans. Overall satisfied, it was nice to watch the stars and sunrise.

I would like to stay for a few more days in summer or autumn. The scenery should be very different.

In addition, the dinner and breakfast were really delicious, especially the stir-fried dishes for dinner, which were much better than the restaurants in the city.
The hotel is 950 meters above sea level and can overlook the mountains. If it is not raining and snowing, the scenery must be invincible. In short, highly recommended!

There is also an electric blanket. The hot water supply is also sufficient. It has opened the door to a new world of B&Bs.

Because it is in the mountains, two fart bugs were caught in the room, and there were some dead flies. They should have just been treated with insecticide.
In addition, there is a single-family cottage, which is a little far from the parking lot. Fortunately, there are service staff to help with the luggage, otherwise it would be a bit tiring to walk all the way to the room.
In addition: the small hot pot tastes and has a good portion

msg:It is indeed a bit of a disadvantage to choose to go in winter. The environment is really good and clean, but the plants are withered and withered in this season, and their beauty is not fully displayed. Because it was before the Spring Festival, I was a little worried that the service could not keep up, but the staff are very enthusiastic and the service is responsive, which is better than most homestays. The floor heating and air conditioning in the room is very warm, and the sanitation is relatively good. But there is one thing that makes me very uncomfortable. On the day I went, the hot water equipment was broken, and it was not restored until midnight. The two of us could only wash our faces and brush our teeth in a hurry without hot water. Because of this, the experience was greatly discounted, and the two days I originally ordered were also refunded for one day. If it weren't for the lack of hot water, it could have been rated five-star. I hope the store will strengthen the maintenance of the equipment so that this situation will not happen again. After all, the price of more than 1,000 yuan is not cheap.

帶娃很棒，輕鬆愉快，田地放敞，也很容易在稻田抓各種昆蟲。
餐食不驚艷，但是水準也不差。
視覺聽覺被照顧的妥當。
提個建議：民宿配置烘乾機和抓昆蟲的小裝備。

衞生：房間很乾凈，設備也新，阿姨會每天打掃衞生，蚊子不多，但因為生態太好，其他蟲子也不少，晚上開燈一定一定一定要把簾子拉好

從成都出發開車1:30小時車程到達，道路好走
在山上氣温舒適，不開空調都可以很舒服
強烈推薦這家山上可以看日出的民宿。

msg:優點：景色不錯，酒店設施比較頂級，新風系統和空調都有，吹風機是戴森的，比較實用，因為山裡比較潮濕，投影儀亮度也可以，哈曼卡頓的，設備都比較新。前台小哥服務好，很貼心，感謝幫忙。餐食不錯，比較有特色，味道好。景色很優美，服務挺好，有求必應。
不足：交通不便利，打車的話不加價的話不去，這塊酒店其實可以完善下，提供接送會更好，總共就六間房，其實接送的過來，這才是真正的貼心，不然的話對外地尤其是我們這種外省的相當不友好。另外，衞生打掃還是要勤快一些，要是有空房的話，希望可以提前入住，兩點入住這點，對於這個價位的酒店來説，真是沒必要成硬性規定。小木屋密閉性不是太好，晚上有寂靜嶺的感覺，膽子小的謹慎考慮下。
