msg:One of the most special hotels we‚Äôve experienced in our China trip. Â∞èÈÇ∞ Xiao Tai was super helpful throughout our stay from arranging airport pick up to nearby activities like Naxi family visits, complimentary photoshoots, campfire experience and mountain sunrise trips. He even delivered the afternoon tea set to our room since we arrived late from the airport! We really enjoyed our stay because of him. 

The room is super clean and has floor heating if it gets cold. The staff provides water, snacks and pot noodles free of charge every day. Breakfast was lovely especially the noodles and chicken hot pot! You can also ask for medicines in case you experience high altitude sickness for free.

The layout of the room, every detail shows your hotel's pursuit of quality. I can feel the comfort of a new look every day when I return to the room. In terms of dining, whether it is the rich buffet for breakfast or the exquisite local specialties for dinner, every dish is delicious and delicious, which makes my taste buds enjoy a feast.

msg:A resort hotel I like very much, with local characteristicsüëçüëçüëç
Environment: The environment of the hotel is first-class, quiet and can make people instantly enter a slow life and enjoy the holiday mood. It is in Yuhu Village, which can be reached in a few minutes. The photos are very good and the scenery is very Zen

Service: The service is very extreme, and the housekeeper Xiaotai is very nice , responsive and timelyü•∞

Hygiene: There are some minor flaws in hygiene. Because it is at the foot of the mountain, there are more mosquitoes. The sofa seats on the balcony are also moldy, which affects the appearance. The water in the humidifier has not been changed, and there are still bugs in it, which is a bit disgusting

Facilities: The hotel has complete supporting facilities and rich activities. The basic full-day itinerary is fully arranged. There is a photo service. I didn‚Äôt expect that there are all kinds of medicines in the room, even Rhodiola rosea, which is a very considerate little move, a little heartwarming, and there are oxygen cylinders. I am very satisfied

Meals: Breakfast and afternoon tea are relatively simple, but you can eat enough. It is recommended to make it more refined. It will be better with the snow mountain view. There are rice noodles for breakfast, which taste good. The watermelon there is really sweetüòÇüòÇThe green pepper hot pot is a feature, the taste is good, and the dishes are also very fresh

msg:This is a unique designer hotel that wins with service and human touch. The hotel is not big and has few rooms. The environment is elegant and integrated into the entire Naxi village. From airport pick-up to check-in and check-out during the stay, the exclusive butler provides meticulous and proactive inquiry services throughout the whole process, and responds to all requests. The hotel group also regularly notifies various activities and hotel information. My butler Xiaoxue, driver Jiang Ge, hotel general manager Yang Ge, and several sisters in the restaurant, etc., everyone is so enthusiastic, patient and careful. It can be said that this is the hotel where I feel the best service and attitude! 
There is no perfect thing in the world. The hotel still has flaws in service and hygiene. For example, some of the curtains on the bathroom windows of the room I stayed in were severely moldy, which affected the appearance. I hope the hotel can clean more carefully to make this warm place at the foot of the snow-capped mountains better!

The home visit experience in the package was also great. It was the first time to grind beans with a stone mill, taste the tofu pudding I made myself, and see many old items of the horse caravans on the Ancient Tea Horse Road.

In the morning, you can watch the sunrise, hike in the snowy mountains, do tie-dyeing in the afternoon, visit Naxi people, take photos in ethnic costumes, etc. The village is also worth visiting. There is also a bonfire party in the evening, and there is a good night service and good night sweet soup before going to bed. It feels so worthwhile to stay here. The special forces itinerary for a whole day is not enough to play. It is recommended to stay for two nights. Finally, I would like to praise the housekeeper Pan Pan. The service is really great! Help us solve various problems at any time, help us arrange the itinerary, remind us of the activities at each time point in time, and take special care of the baby. It is really considerate and makes us feel like home. I give Pan Pan a hundred likes!

msg:Stayed for one night on New Year's Eve, it was great!
Service is the ceiling! Before check-in, the housekeeper Miaomiao communicated on WeChat in advance and arranged a 24-hour activity itinerary. She was very enthusiastic, considerate and appropriate. Guests come first. Jinmao Puxiu will infinitely surpass it, not to mention from the perspective of cost-effectiveness.
From leaving Banyan Tree to staying at Jinmao Puxiu, you don‚Äôt need to think about anything. You will be picked up and dropped off in a car decorated in Naxi style, turning on the mindless enjoyment mode.
The home visit to the Naxi family was very interesting. I saw Herm√®s from a hundred years ago~haha~
Light hiking, accompanied by snowy mountains all the way, to see that lonely tree~
The free travel photography is indeed for a magazine, and it is more attentive than Bojue's travel photography. There was no makeup appoin**ent, so the little brother said he would put on lipstick and leave the rest to them to produce a high-quality film!
I had a slight headache, but there was a free oxygen room. The clerk was very worried and asked if he had any other symptoms.
After leaving the store, the housekeeper Miaomiao was very caring and sent her New Year wishes~
Very happy! I chose Shujia Yulu, recommended! After booking, leave everything to the B&B, no need to make any strategies or plans, enjoy!

Thank you very much to the housekeeper Xiao Tai for upgrading our room to the Snow Mountain Garden Naxi Family Suite. You can see the Rizhao Jinshan Mountain from the room. The architectural design, external environment design, and interior design of the entire hotel have regional characteristics, are unified as a whole, and are harmonious and beautiful.
The guest rooms are more than 90 square meters and fully functional. Living room, bedroom, tatami, kitchen, bathroom with dry and wet separation; children's slide, children's tent, floor heating, humidifier, heated drying rack, etc. are all available.
There are also many activities in the hotel, including viewing the Golden Mountain in Rizhao, light hiking in the snow-capped mountains, tie-dying, travel photography, Naxi home visits, fence fire parties, etc. The day before the event, the butler will confirm the itinerary with you and will remind you when the time is up. All services in the hotel are considerate, thoughtful and humane.
The food is also very good, including breakfast, dinner, afternoon tea, and sweet soup before going to bed.
Love this hotel and had a wonderful holiday here with my family.

Staying at Shujia was the biggest surprise of our trip to Lijiang. The hotel includes breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the products are pretty good. Secondly, there are many free activities to participate in, such as tie-dying, Naxi cultural experience, bonfire, hiking, etc. Friends said that next time I want to bring my parents here to experience it. Thanks again to all the staff at Villa for their hospitality. My only regret is that I only stayed one night.

msg:This is a treasure hotel at the foot of the snow-capped mountains. I stayed here when it opened. I must stay here again this year when visiting Lijiang. The service stewards and staff are very considerate. The hotel is located in Yuhu Village at the foot of the mountain, a primitive Naxi village. The buildings in the village are all made of wood and stone. This hotel also perfectly restores the local humanistic culture. Friends who like humanities should not miss it.
        I brought a friend here this time. Before I came, my friend looked at the order and asked why it was so expensive? I explained that it included breakfast, a hot pot meal, and some activities. The most important thing was that it had a 360-degree view, so there was really no need to visit scenic spots. You can see the snow-capped mountains and the golden mountains illuminated by sunshine from your room. After returning home, my friend said it was worth it! Really worth it!
        Room: I am a starry sky duplex suite with 360-degree floor-to-ceiling windows and skylights. It can be said that there is a view outside the windows, the floor is heated throughout the house, and short-sleeved shirts are worn on the second floor during the day in December. There are incense sticks, multiple humidifiers, and it‚Äôs full of details.
       Restaurant: The hot pot set menu and stir-fry dishes in the hotel are delicious and there are no surprises. It completely subverts the concept of "Can hotel restaurants be delicious? Let's go out to eat something special." The hotel restaurants are all special and taste great. The breakfast rice noodles are rich in toppings. There are beef brisket, special stone pot chicken, white-cut yak meat, and chanterelles. If the hotel's breakfast wasn't so rich, I would definitely have had another meal at noon to experience a few more dishes.
       In addition to breakfast and dinner, afternoon tea, good night sweet soup, and fruit are delivered to the room. There are also snacks and drinks in the refrigerator, all for free.
       Activities: As soon as we entered the hotel, the housekeeper pulled us into the group. The activity schedule will be notified in the group. In the evening, the hotel will have a bonfire party or make tea and watch movies around the fire. These are free. Because there were so many people, the hotel contacted Murakami‚Äôs battery car the next morning to take us to Longnv Lake to see Rizhao Jinshan Mountain. We only had to pay the driver 20 yuan per person for the ride. The Longnu Lake attraction is free, and the most important thing is! nobody! I almost froze to death in Ganhaizi a few days ago because of the huge crowds of people.
      There are Yuzhu Qingtian, Longnu Lake, and Locke Memorial Hall nearby. You can ride horses, stroll around the village, and stare at the snow-capped mountains in a daze. At night, you can see the stars and bend down to see the bright lights of Lijiang at the foot of the mountain. If I have another chance to come to Lijiang, I will definitely stay here.

At 11 o'clock in the evening, the housekeeper Joe received me on WeChat. His straightforward and enthusiastic style gave me an instant confidence in being a demanding guest. After staying for one night, I firmly wanted to stay here until I left Lijiang.
This is an unexpectedly warm hotel. In addition to the excellent hardware, the sincere enthusiasm of the Naxi employees made us feel as warm as living at home. Cooking tea around the stove, having bonfire parties, visiting Naxi homes, hiking in the snow-capped mountains, and organizing a trip to see the Rizhao Jinshan Mountain together, allowed us to experience the warmth of a big family while enjoying a private rest during the trip. Special thanks to our butler Joe. His thoughtfulness is mature and meticulous, not at all a formulaic smile or formulaic process. He also personally drove us to see Rizhao Jinshan in his car. I have to mention that the food in the hotel is so delicious. I will never want to go to a five-star hotel buffet again. Every food is delicious and I won‚Äôt want to waste it. Snacks that the children like will be brought to us. When you go back, especially if you have men at home, you don‚Äôt have to worry about your taste at all, and the meal is definitely large enough to satisfy you~~
On the day we checked out, we made an appoin**ent to take a photo shoot at the hotel. It happened to be snowing heavily. The photographer was neat and tidy and the photos were very pleasant. He even used our photo to promote it on WeChat Moments. It is said that he is a photographer who shoots for many celebrities and Internet celebrities. It is humorous. It‚Äôs fun, and you can easily bring back beautiful travel souvenirs without leaving the hotel. I almost missed it, but luckily I didn‚Äôt~~~

msg:I stayed in a total of 7 hotels during my trip to Yunnan. In addition to Shujia, I also stayed at an internet celebrity hotel in Shuanglang, Dali that costs more than 2,000 a night. Among them, the best one was Yulu. I checked in on February 7th. , that day happened to be the 28th of the ***** New Year, and I stayed for one night. The most real feeling is that my husband and I were well taken care of by the hotel friends. I am very grateful ~ I have been with my husband since I checked into the hotel. He said that I would write something down to record the [goodness] of Jade House and give it a valuable reference for those who need it in the future.

First of all, if you want to choose Yulu, then I have to tell you that Yulu is a niche, it is forgotten, and it is one of the few secluded corners in Lijiang that can make you "slow down". It does not have the so-called Internet celebrity hotel. The "most beautiful" photo location, in my opinion, he doesn't even know much about "marketing";
So what does he have? What it has is the pure and beautiful Naxi civilization and Naxi architecture, which is the opposite of the bustle of the ancient city. This quietness can make you really stop and observe yourself and the Jade Lake.
If you are like me and want to be more immersed in nature, choose Yulu~ He will not let you down~
And he will also give you surprises, like me. I was pleasantly surprised by the light in the housekeeper Xiao Tai's eyes when he talked about the things in the hotel; I was also pleasantly surprised by the smiles on the faces of the Naxi sisters who helped us prepare three meals a day.
Of course, I was also surprised that a hotel can cook dinner and breakfast so well. The local stinky tofu is also commonly known as "hairy tofu". My husband said it tasted more authentic than the restaurant we went to. My husband is from Yunnan. His evaluation is still useful for referenceü§£Please see the pictures and videos for details~
In addition, the sky in Jade House will also surprise you~ The night I went there, the sky was filled with stars...
Let‚Äôs talk about another activity that made my husband feel a lot, that is, the Naxi home visit organized by Yulu. My husband is from Yunnan and he had a great time during the home visit. The host of the home visit, Mr. He, even used Naxi pictograms for us. The text contains the best wishes of "love each other"~ Friends traveling with us also received a wish of "peace and joy".
In fact, we spent less than 24 hours in Yulu, but I gained a lot... This much is completely different from what I gained when I spent two hours taking photos in Shuanglang Hotel. Although I had a lot of good-looking photos, when I After I left, I felt empty. I couldn‚Äôt even recall what it was like there, but I was very satisfied with the time I spent in Yulu. When I came back, I could still remember the people I walked by and the people I saw. Want to go again.

Thank you Shujia Yulu~Thank you the housekeeper Xiao Tai~

I only stayed one night due to my travel schedule, but I was very satisfied.

The appearance of the entire hotel combines the local Naxi traditional and contemporary architectural styles, and it is beautiful no matter how you take it.
The interior of the room is comfortable and warm, with complete toiletries, including bathrobes for children.
The hotel arranged quite a lot of activities. From morning to night, there were viewing of Rizhao Jinshan Mountain, hiking, tie-dye experience, Naxi home visit, and bonfire party. I once again lamented that staying for one night was really a waste~
In terms of catering, the dinner was quite sumptuous. We chose the mushroom and local chicken pot for the set meal, which was very delicious and had plenty of side dishes. Although there are not many brunch options, the best is the taste. In addition to three meals, there is also afternoon tea and evening sweet soup. I can hardly eat anything else at the end of the day, hahaha.
In addition, Yuhu Village itself is also very visitable. In the morning, we hiked to Longnu Lake from the hotel and rode horses there.
The original ecology of the village has a hint of modernity. There are local shops and nice cafes. I took my children on a home visit to Naxi and was so impressed that I grinded soybeans and made soy milk and tofu. I also saw many interesting old Naxi objects.
In short, summer will come again~

msg:When going to Lijiang, you must go to Yuhu Village, a quaint Naxi village with the most authentic customs and customs. After choosing from thousands of options, I decided on a villa, and it was surprisingly good. It‚Äôs definitely because I think it‚Äôs good that I‚Äôm willing to praise it at length. First of all, all the staff in the hotel are warm and hospitable, which is not easy. Pan Pan, the private butler, is attentive and patient, answering all questions, and considers every detail of the customized itinerary. The driver who picked us up and the uncle who accompanied us on foot were as kind as family. Three days and two nights in the hotel, every day was spent in warmth. Next, let‚Äôs talk about the environment. The hotel rooms are of high quality, very comfortable, large in space, clean and hygienic, and have a good view. The floor heating, air conditioning is powerful, and the shower equipment is all Hansgrohe. The water output is large, making bathing and bathing comfortable. It is especially suitable for families, especially families with children. The dishes in the set menu are also a highlight, and the yak hotpot is a must. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about activities. I must go to Naxi for a home visit. The soy milk and bean curd made by myself are still unforgettable when I think about it. It's worth taking a light hike, it's wild and interesting, and you can see the mountains and lakes from a different angle. Next time I go to Lijiang, I will choose to stay here again.

Because we checked in during lunch time in the afternoon and did not have lunch, the butler immediately took the initiative to arrange three bowls of rice noodles to be delivered to the room. My husband said that this was so much for him. The only food in the world that I feel is the most delicious. They sent us to Jade Dragon Snow Mountain and sent our luggage to another hotel. They were full of details and heartwarming praises, so that we can feel the feelings of customers with our heart. They kept feeding us food all day long, and our mouths and stomachs were not busy.

It‚Äôs a plus for tourists to choose from. The B&B is very large, and there are many filming locations. Among the supporting photography services, Naxi costumes are provided, and three photos are free (the excess is 100 per photo). I thought it was too expensive, and we brought two cameras to take pictures, so I only chose 3 photos as souvenirs. In addition, I also experienced the tie-dying process, and the short cloth made can be taken away as a souvenir. Light hiking involves climbing over a hill to Longnu Lake. If you don't want to hike, you can go to Changshou Pavilion and take a sightseeing bus back and forth. One way is 10 yuan per person.
There is a lotus pond in front of the lobby on the first floor. In the lobby there is a place for roasting tea with a national furnace and a quiet tea room. The surroundings of the B&B are full of flowers, which are beautiful. You can see the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain from the pavilion on the second floor. The public restaurant and rooms are also on the second floor.

First of all, there is a free pick-up service (we were picked up in Dayan Ancient Town the night before). As soon as we arrived at the hotel, we were given hot towels to wipe our hands and sour cream. Sweet and savory plum soup. Except for the light meal at noon, which is relatively average in taste, the portion is very generous, and both breakfast and dinner are very good. All services during the stay were very good. If you have any questions in the group or if you ask the housekeeper, they will respond quickly and implement them. After staying at Shujia once, I really want to go to other places to continue the experience. The only regret is that due to weather problems, bonfire parties, sunrises, and hiking, we cannot experience these projects. I hope that the same situation will happen in the future. Other items can be used instead, and it would be better to prepare some cold medicine and fever medicine.

The most impressive thing for me is their butler service, one-stop service to arrange what you need. When we booked the hotel this time, airport pick-up and breakfast, lunch, and dinner were included. However, because we were going to Jade Dragon Snow Mountain on the second day, our housekeeper Pan Pan arranged a car for us to be delivered to the entrance of the scenic spot. The point-to-point service did not include waiting. It costs RMB100, which is great value. The car was very new, and the driver even explained to us interesting places in Lijiang on the way back. So when staying in this hotel, you only need to inform the little housekeeper what you need, and she will take care of everything for you.

In addition, when booking this hotel through trip.com, in addition to meals and airport pick-up, it also includes ethnic minority home visits and ethnic costume photography. The handsome guy who took the photo for us was very attentive in teaching us how to pose. Although we had to change into national clothes, he took a lot of beautiful photos and gave you 3 photos for free.

Finally, their food is really good, especially the yak hotpot at night, which is really delicious. Next time I come to Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, I will definitely stay in this hotel again.

msg:The room has no odor, is spacious, and has complete facilities. However, the floor can creak and make noises when walking upstairs in the middle of the night. The dinner in the restaurant was delicious, and the environment outside was also very good. I participated in the activities organized by the hotel, including bonfire parties, Naxi home visits, artistic photos, tie-dying, etc. Among them, Naxi home visits are highly recommended, but artistic photos are not recommended. , makeup and hairstyle are not included, only clothing is provided. The cost of buying photos is expensive and the effect is very ordinary. You can take better-looking pictures with any mobile phone. The angles taken by the photographer are all crooked, and the post-production is not done well for the fee. , doing it is the same as not doing it. If you want to take good-looking photos, you have to go to ancient towns outside to find them. At least makeup and hair are included, and the charges are not expensive.

First time staying in a wooden villa, a good experience
The hotel has one-stop service. I especially like the housekeeper Miaomiao. She arranges everything in detail, is considerate and attentive, and is also very good to babies.
The baby's needs are taken care of when it comes to handmade tie-dying and meals. They will help make arrangements for everything. The three meals and afternoon tea in the hotel are delicious and very appetizing. The aunt, the brother who carries the luggage, the security guard, and the uncle who makes tea are all very helpful. Very good, warm hospitality, recommended

Unfortunately, this time the stay was too short and there was not enough food. Take the time to feel the local life and taste more delicious food, and save the regrets for coming back next time. There are also many activities, especially suitable for parent-child travel. My baby was very happy to stay, and I will never forget the delicious food.

The food provided by the hotel was also surprisingly delicious. I had the mushroom and chicken hot pot for dinner and I was amazed! The hotel was very considerate in every aspect and even provided an oxygen concentrator. My friend who was traveling with me had a high fever, so the hotel immediately sent an oxygen concentrator. The housekeeper Pan Pan was also very considerate. We felt that the room was a bit dark, so we immediately applied for an upgrade to the duplex room next door. The hotel also arranged many activities. The schedule was very full in the afternoon, and it was not boring at all. The good night sweet soup in the evening was not perfunctory at all. Very satisfied and hope to have another chance to stay there for a few days next time.

Compared with the room price, the hotel's hardware facilities are really average. But the service of the housekeeper Pan Pan completely makes up for the lack of hardware. Everything is thought of for us and is very thoughtful and attentive.

The hotel room rate is all-inclusive and the catering is pretty good, especially the breakfast options. Compared with the catering in international five-star hotels, it has more local characteristics.

The hotel's activities are also very rich. Thank you Pan Pan for always reminding me of tie-dyeing, visits to Naxi people, and bonfires at night... At night, in the dark village next to the hotel, we also saw the sky full of stars.

The hotel is not far from the "main road" in the village. You can buy coffee within a seven- to eight-minute walk in the morning. I stayed for two nights and experienced horse riding twice, especially the horse riding around Longnu Lake after 5:30 in the evening. The children were very happy.

Overall, it‚Äôs still a hotel worth staying in

Let‚Äôs talk about the advantages first:
I stayed here during the National Day. The service attitude was good and the hotel environment was acceptable.

Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings:
1. Low cost performance. High-end is not like other hotels that charge 4,000. I also charge 4,000 and it‚Äôs high-end. This hotel can't cost more than 1,000.
2. The hotel facilities are old, the rooms are slippery, and there are stains everywhere. According to Ctrip, the opening date is 2017?
3. Breakfast was served until 10:30. Many of the snacks were gone at 10 o‚Äôclock and were not replenished. There were many flies lying on the snacks, and they were indifferent despite being reminded.
4. This hotel is in Yuhu Village. A certain group in Yuhu Village scored 3.8 to know what the folk customs are like. Be careful not to get cheated after you go out to play.
5. I won‚Äôt complain about the others one by one.

If you have money, just go to Club Med. If you are stupid and have a lot of money, please come quickly.

The housekeeper Pan Pan was very enthusiastic and made our stay experience even better. She reminded us to order food every day at lunch and dinner, and the activities were arranged reasonably and abundantly. It was great. If we come to Lijiang next time, we will continue to stay.

The package I ordered includes three meals and afternoon tea, so I don‚Äôt have to go out to find food by myself. The hotel also provides a wealth of activities. It is very interesting to visit the Naxi family. The Naxi couple who hosted us are also interesting and loving people. We can wear Naxi national costumes, experience grinding soybean milk and learn Naxi characters (Dongba script). Tie-dyeing in the hotel is also fun, and the patterns that come out often exceed expectations. It‚Äôs a pity that I couldn‚Äôt participate in the morning hiking activity.

All in all, it was a wonderful experience, totally worth the room fee, highly recommended!

I deliberately avoided the peak period and went to Yuhu Village, a niche resort in Lijiang, and finally had the "holiday" I wantedüòÄüòÄ
Clothes
Naxi ethnic costumes and Hanfu allow children and mothers to dress up beautifully every day
Food
Breakfast, in-room fruit, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, late night snacks... all kinds of delicacies are served throughout the day. The taste is as delicious as the Hyatt's. The portions are really generous and a great deal.
It really makes me, an old mother, worry-free when adults and children can have enough to eat.
live
I paid the price difference and upgraded to room 502 on the second floor. The view is better. I like it very much. The bed is very comfortable. I personally think it is on par with the bedding of So-and-so Man. The children like the room very much. They ran around barefoot excitedly and visited various places. Make facilities and play house with tea sets...
OK
The entertainment activities provided by the hotel accommodation are children‚Äôs favorite. Hiking to pick up bacteria and tie-dying.
My husband and I most like the Naxi home visit that the hotel helps us contact. We can experience tofu grinding, paper making, visit private museums, learn about Dongba culture, and listen to historical stories...
There is also a billiards room that is also very good, children like it

The hotel's butler service was very attentive and the communication was smooth and pleasant. He really responded to our requests and left a deep and good impression on us.
Thanks to our considerate butler Mr. Tai, and to the kind sisters in the catering depar**ent for giving our family a wonderful holiday.
There will be a follow-up date, and we will arrange to come back on a sunny day in Lijiang.

Also, the little housekeeper Miao Miao who is always there every time is so niceü•π She knew that I might be a little uncomfortable on the first day of my stay because of the altitude, and she really took it to heart. After that, she asked me about my situation every day and worried that we were hungry. We were not hungry or cold. We took the initiative to communicate with us. If the breakfast was too cold, they would send me messages to remind me of too many small details. This is why I always choose this restaurant.

It is still very comfortable to book a duplex room for the room. If the weather is good on the second floor, you can watch the stars. But this year Lijiang has too much rain and there is no such a good opportunity, so come again next time.

The housekeeper will contact you a few days in advance, and then communicate the details of the experience in detail.

We stayed for 3 days and 2 nights. The overall feeling was very good. The hotel environment is also very beautiful. It is at the foot of the mountain. The Naxi Yuhu Village next to it is worth visiting. The scenery is good and very unique. The hotel's breakfast, lunch, and dinner were also good. The night we checked in happened to be their annual meeting, and they also arranged very delicious hot pot and buffet meals for us. The hotel will also provide sweet soup at 9pm. It is very comfortable to have a bowl and then rest. In addition, the hotel has floor heating, which is still very warm.
The next day we went to climb Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, and the housekeeper was very considerate and prepared two bottles of oxygen and glucose for us. Because we set off very early. So the hotel also prepared a simple meal for us in the morning.
If I have time to go to Lijiang again, I will continue to choose here.

At the foot of the mountain, inside the ancient Naxi village, you can enjoy the mountain scenery and the charm of the ancient village. Butler Miao Miao's service is particularly thoughtful and meticulous. Because the plane was delayed until two o'clock in the morning, there were still people who greeted us kindly and sent our luggage to the room. The hotel meals are very local and delicious. The Naxi family visit is very distinctive, and the children like tie-dye activities. The hotel tea room is also very professional, and tasted the authentic Icelandic ancient tree Pu'er. In short, give this trip 100 points.

In just two days, I experienced tie-dyeing, light hiking in the snow-capped mountains, horseback riding in Yulong Lake, home visits of the Naxi people, Locke‚Äôs former residence, etc., with rich content. The staff of the B&B are very warm, courteous, meticulous and thoughtful, and the food in the restaurant is delicious, making you truly feel at home! Highly recommend! The time is too short this time, next time I have time to stay a few more days. The favorite hotels and scenic spots during the trip to Lijiang were just well developed, but seeing that there are many homestays in the village for rent, I can't help but worry that over-development will bring excessive noise and worldliness to the small village. I hope that hotels and small villages can keep this refined and simple as much as possible.

Special praise to Ms. Pan Pan by name, she is super nice, and our children like her very much. In addition to picking up the airport, they also sent us to the small cableway of Yulong Snow Mountain for free.

msg:The significance of travel is not punch-in tourism, but to feel the natural and cultural scenery through a relaxed state. The villa is located in Yuhu Village at the foot of the snow-capped mountains. It is about an hour's drive from Sanyi Airport. The hotel will send a car to pick you up. After arriving at noon, I tasted the simple meal provided by the hotel for free. The fried rice was very delicious, and the child ate a big bowl. A major feature of the hotel is the local cultural experience. Through the Naxi home visit, you can communicate with the locals, learn about Dongba culture, and taste the delicacies made by the locals. The children even grind the soy milk with their own hands. In addition, there are many art activities in the hotel, and arrangements will be made according to the situation of the day, such as bonfire parties, children's experience of tie-dyeing, etc. The activity on the day of our stay is to cook around the stove and watch movies. On the second day, the hotel had a hike, because I brought children, I didn't participate. There are not many varieties of hotel buffet breakfast, and the rice noodles are delicious. After sleeping until you wake up naturally, take the children to feel the nature in Yuhu Village. Lijiang entered the rainy season at the end of June. Although the snow-capped mountains could not be seen clearly, there were very few people at Longnv Lake. I felt that I had entered the picture scroll and had an excellent experience. I stayed in a basic room type, but I fully felt the hotel's wild luxury positioning, and truly achieved the combination of nature, humanity, and art. The caring housekeeper gave me a small gift before leaving, and found that I had left something in the hotel, so I immediately contacted the courier to deliver it to me.

Finally, the happiest thing is the home visit activity. Mrs. Lei Ge Lei is really enthusiastic and warm, and the baby is also very cute! I really stayed at Lei Ge's house for two hours and didn't want to leave. Love this event so much, love it so much, 100%! !

Let me talk about what I am not very satisfied with. I made an appoin**ent to take pictures in the afternoon, and I finished taking it for 15 minutes. Just took me to shoot, I said to change clothes, the photographer said no, I took it, I came here for this Naxi costume! The photos I took were ugly, and I was really convinced that I was either squinting or rolling my eyes. If you don't want to do this activity, then don't do it, it really affects the experience. It was so ugly, I wanted to cryü•≤.

In short, except for the unsatisfactory photography, I like everything else very much. Will consider staying at this hotel elsewhere in the future.

In the picturesque #ÁéâÊπñÊùë at the foot of the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in Lijiang, the village is surrounded by mountains and rivers. You can see the snow-capped mountains when you look up, and you can overlook the ancient city of Lijiang when you look down! B&Bs are built from local characteristic stone houses, with a large area, most of which are single-family small yards, which are very suitable for friends, couples, and family vacations.
It is quiet and lonely here, away from the hustle and bustle of the world. People often say: This is the original Lijiang.

hotel room
The rooms are large in size and fully equipped.
There are tea sets and Puer tea, as well as a humidifier and an induction cooker~ The details are really perfect. What I like most is looking at the outside world through the window. This is quite a movie~
You can enjoy the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain from the room. With the design of the skylight, you can lie on the bed and watch the starry sky at night. The bathtub is facing the window. You can take a bath while watching the snow-capped mountains in the room. This feeling is really great!

hotel food
The hotel's breakfast can be said to be super rich, and the rice noodle set is my favorite. Lunch and dinner can also be eaten at the hotel for different tastes. The ingredients and taste are carefully prepared, and their vegetable juice hot pot is especially recommended. Every time I come to Lijiang, I want to come and eat it.

Leisure and entertainment
Here you can also experience the hotel's hand-dyed tie-dyeing and Naxi home visits with a special flavor!

First of all, I chose this hotel because it is close to the snow mountain, and the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain is just outside the room. The hotel is in Yuhu Village, and the neighborhood is very quiet and not noisy. There are also rooms for three people, which are relatively rare, usually either double rooms or quadruple rooms.

Secondly, the hotel includes three meals, and also includes pick-up and drop-off from the train station and airport and some entertainment activities. We only choose to eat breakfast and dinner at the hotel every day, especially recommend the yak hot pot, the beef is very tender! Stir-fry is okay, but not as good as hot pot.

Furthermore, the butler service is really the most distinctive service of this hotel. It is really caring. It will remind you to order meals every day, etc., and the reply messages are very timely.

Finally, the facilities and environment of the hotel are very good. The best trip of the whole trip to Lijiang is this hotel except for the trip to Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. I will stay here again in the future!

The bedding is comfortable, the body wash is L'Occitane, I like the smell of verbena, and the good night sweet soup every night is very considerate.

This is the worst room layout I have ever stayed in in 5 years. The room is really shabby and unsightly‚Ä¶

When the photography teacher saw me selecting and deleting the photos until there were only 8.9 left, he kept a straight face and refused to let me delete them. Then he said that it would be better if I spent only 50 yuan a photo. The result was the same as my own. Adding a filter to a beautiful picture makes no difference. Originally, it was a bonus that the hotel had a travel photography service, and it didn't matter even if it was paid. However, the quality of this kind of photographer will only bring down the quality of the hotel. I will still go to Yunnan again in the future, but I will definitely not stay in this hotel again.

msg:At the foot of the snow-capped mountains, as soon as I entered the courtyard, the check-in was very fast. Every staff member greeted us with a smile and took the initiative to say hello. The room is quite big, the drinks and snacks in the refrigerator are all free, free fruit, and a midnight snack is provided in the evening. The yard environment is quite quiet, and the meal in the restaurant is also delicious. We ordered stir-fried dishes. We tasted the Naxi afternoon tea. We like the taste of Pu'er, a bit waxy, different from the Pu'er we used to drink. Breakfast is also good and customized Plus self-help. No matter where you are in Lijiang, you can pick it up and send it off. There are two nearby attractions. The hotel has free bicycles. You can cross the village to the lake. The scenery is also very good. There are also farmhouse restaurants in the village, and the environment is also good. A lot of wedding photos. There are souvenirs when leaving the store. In short, I am very satisfied. I will come next time and I will stay a few more days.

There are bonfire parties, watching the sunrise and other hotel activities, staying for two days is very fulfilling, staying for three days is physically and mentally refreshed, and staying for four days is refreshing. Highly recommended, this time staying at the housekeeper, Keer took good care of and the quality of service is first-rate

msg:This time I chose a small hotel in Yuhu Village of the Naxi nationality at the foot of Yulong Snow Mountain in Lijiang. It is said that it has won the Italian award and is integrated into the village. Looking up at the blue sky, looking down at the green grass, surrounded by mountains and gurgling streams.
Our room is very large, there are slide tent dolls, children have fun playing. The breakfast is plentiful, with various steaming points. There is also afternoon tea and good night sweet soup.
The hotel provides various activities, ethnic costumes, horseback riding, mountain biking, light hiking, parent-child handicrafts, and it feels like you can visit the snow-capped mountains and participate in activities without leaving the hotel for a day.

There were many mosquitoes and I changed rooms for free. I changed to the top-class toast suite and earned it! ! Butler Kerr is also super attentive, from the hotel to the check out! ! The barbecue at Starry Sky Bar is so delicious! ! Drinks and drinks are free and you can watch movies. The staff in the hotel are so cute and nice. There are many upgrades on the project. The experience is great! Everyone rushed to me!

The environment is beautiful, quiet, the room is comfortable, butler service is in place, and the dishes are also distinctive. It is very suitable for leisure and relaxation.

Very very satisfied with a staying experience. Special thanks to our housekeeper literary girl for serving us, watching the sunrise with us at 6 o'clock in the morning, taking pictures, and answering all questions, all arrangements are satisfied!
The morning meal is so good that there is nothing to say. The authentic Cantonese morning tea, local baba, butter tea, there is no fancy extra, every dish and rice will fall into the stomach.
