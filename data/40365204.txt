msg:Awesome location if you are going to Disney Shanghai, just a ten minute walk to Disney's main entrance. The rooms were extremely nice. The restaurant in the hotel had only a small selection of dishes to choose, was very good, but definitely overprived (especially considering there is nowhere else to eat).
I would say a better choice than the disney hotel.

msg:What a beautiful hotel with the amazing scenery! We felt like we are not in SHA with well maintained green grass with flowers inside the hotel which was really relaxing. If you would like to be away from busy city with full of high buildings I definitely recommend this hotel. We will definitely come back again! Thank you for preparing the special gift to my family since we were celebrating special day! 
Room: very spacious with good amenities, unlike many hotels in SH it was convenient that bathroom and bathtub is separated! Having yard at the back was so lovely as we were able to have happy hour drinks in the evening! 
Service: They’re trying to be helpful but it seems less stuffs so when I needed room service and called nobody answered my calls so I had to wait for a while to be answered. 
Breakfast: The food was good but with this amount of price of stay I wished the had more variety of food.

Everything else was great.  The shower and bathtub were top-notch.   Plenty of room for kids to run around in the grass area surrounding the hotel as well.  

Very close to Disney Land as well.  A short shuttle to the road and a 10 min walk to the ticket gate.  

would recommend to travelers with and without a family.

msg:To clarify: the hotel shuttle bus is only responsible for sending guests from the lobby to the hotel's main gate near Shendi West Road, not to the Disney entrance as other guests on Dianping generally introduced. The shuttle bus ride takes about one minute.
The hotel combines Spanish style with Shanghai-style garden architecture, quiet and elegant. But the garden is a low shrub, and when there is plenty of sunlight, there are no tall trees to provide shade, so it will be more sunny.
The room air conditioner leaks: Shanghai's night weather is cooler during the stay, and the hotel air conditioner cannot heat alone. After turning off the central air conditioner in the room, there is still a perceptible cool breeze blowing in, and there is a leakage phenomenon. (The skylight is closed)
The washbasin is narrow and there is no trash can. The closest one is in the bathroom behind you. Because there is a door that needs to be opened and closed, it is very inconvenient to throw away the garbage for washing.
The breakfast is very exquisite, but there are many people going to Disney in the morning, which will be noisy!

msg:I originally booked a hotel on Yanxiu Road. On the way to the hotel, I read the reviews. Some people said that it only takes 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to the town, so I changed to this hotel.

First, let’s talk about the location: it’s impossible to get to Disney Town in 5 minutes from the hotel gate (I’ll talk about the lobby to the gate below), and it may not be possible to ride a bicycle. It took us 20 minutes to get there.

I bought an early morning pass, got up at 5:30, walked out of the door at 6:00, and went to Starbucks in the small town at 6:30 to queue up and wait for admission.

Let’s talk about the facilities and services: We checked in at around 3:00 or 4:00. After checking in, a staff member took us to the room. However, in the original single-storey hotel, he only took our luggage to our room, but did not give us any information. Location, I am a road addict, and I couldn't find my way back to the lobby, so I saw a map at the door of the hotel.

Besides, it turns out that the hotel has a shuttle that can take guests from the lobby to the main entrance. We walked twice using our legs. We couldn’t help but ask the lobby staff and found out that there is a shuttle that picks up guests from 7 to 11 a.m. every day. Why can’t we apply? Tell your guests when you check in!

And clean, perfect, no complaints.

Except that they didn’t proactively say that there is a taxi service, the hotel is also very good. After the Disneyland show, I saw many people taking taxis in front of the hotel gate. I guess it is impossible to get a taxi at Disneyland. .

There was so much greenery, everything was green, and there was a large grassy area where the children could run around freely. The hotel is in the style of an old Shanghai bungalow. The room is large and clean. The front desk checked in quickly and helped bring luggage to the room. Good reviews 👍. The breakfast is delicious, everything is carefully made, and the small wontons are the children's favorite. The hotel also has a shuttle bus that can be delivered to the gate. It is only a few minutes' walk to Disney, which is very convenient. Most of the hotels are for children to play. They are very independent, very quiet, and can't hear any noise. Overall, I am very satisfied with everything. I will choose this hotel again in the future!

It had to be able to accommodate three adults and one child, and it also had to be close to Disneyland, and the conditions had to be slightly better. I looked around for a long time, but because I was planning to travel in a leisurely manner and not rush in with my parents and kids early in the morning, I didn't need to enjoy the early bird privilege. Until I saw this hotel, I felt that it basically met my above requirements. It was in the resort area, but it was not a theme hotel. The hotel environment and humid climate were very comfortable and pleasant. The kids could play in the park. The design of the small western-style building had a little style (my mom liked it very much). It would be nice to have a spacious and high-ceilinged room. It would take about ten minutes to walk to Disneyland. It was worth my time to choose, except that there were not many types of breakfast.

From the main gate to the lobby, there is a shuttle bus from 7 am to 11 pm, and it only takes 2.3 minutes to walk...The security guard at the gate said it takes 3 minutes to walk from the main gate to Disneyland...It's a bit exaggerated. We walked for a while, crossed the traffic light opposite, and walked along the fountain pool. It still took 10 minutes. In fact, there is a road that is closer, which is Wishing Star Park, but I saw that the gate is closed all year round. If you walk from here, it really only takes 3 minutes...
Breakfast is here in the lobby. It seems small, but if you really want to Everything you want is there, and the taste is pretty good...
The courtyard room I booked has a small courtyard, the room space is pretty good, and the overall comfort is very high...
When you order takeout, the food will be placed in the front hall, and you need to go out and get it yourself, and you have to look at the store. Many stores deliver by themselves, and you don’t need to pay extra. Because there are no electric cars in Disneyland, you have to drive in, so a few stores will require extra money... Especially the Zhang Liang Malatang, although they charged us 50 for the car fare, and then asked us if we needed anything else, he said he would bring it all in one trip...
Highly recommended, I will stay here again when I go to Disneyland next time

The check-in procedure in the hotel lobby is very fast. We stored our luggage first when we arrived early🧳The front desk will arrange for a waiter to deliver the luggage to the room. Every time the service is very good, the service attitude and tone of voice are also very good.
The hotel is very convenient to Disneyland, and you can reach Disneytown in just ten minutes' walk. February 14th is Valentine’s Day, and the restaurant waiter also gave me roses🌹It was really a surprise, thank you very much🙏
Today when I checked out, the front desk gave me many 🎁 gifts. They were all Disney doll gifts. The kids liked them very much. Thank you 🙏
When you get off the bus and come to Disney, you will also choose the Meliá Hotel. It is recommended that friends who want family vacations or parent-child travel can choose the Meliá Hotel.

msg:Disney. Disney's two themed hotels are expensive. Not to mention that they don't have a two-meter double bed room. Are they still parent-child hotels? A three-year-old child lives in the TV cabinet by himself? This hotel is pretty good. Two-meter big bed, free drinks at the mini bar. I made a reservation for the park's privileges but didn't make a reservation for parking. Fortunately, the hotel is closer to the hotel than P1. I will stay here next time.

Instead, I bought a concierge, slept until I woke up naturally, had a leisurely breakfast, and entered the park before nine o'clock. I was tired from playing at noon. Come back and take a rest, then continue working on projects after checking out. Thank you very much for helping us delay check-out until 2 o'clock. The rice noodle boy also liked the breakfast.

It takes about 10 minutes to walk. The scenery along the way is beautiful and there is a large green area. On the lawn, if you are not in a hurry, you can have a lawn party~ When you checked in, the little girl at the front desk decisively upgraded you to a suite. The child loved it so much that he said he stayed in the deep forest villa🏡~ When I come to Disneyland in the future, it must be this hotel. Wow, I really feel at home~ The restaurant is also delicious😋, and the kids said the breakfast was very satisfying😀 Also worth mentioning is that the room is really clean~ Because my feet were blistered after a day at Disney G.I.~ I simply went barefoot In the room, I indirectly measured the cleanliness of the floor. When you take your little friends out, it’s good news for families whose children like to go barefoot. Moms don’t have to worry anymore. In short, as long as it’s a trip to Disney in the future, I will always stay here.

msg:Because this trip to Disneyland was recommended by a friend, I chose this hotel. I bought a hotel ticket, which was slightly more expensive than the last-minute reservation, but I came and didn’t mind.
Some really, really great value:
1. Distance - It’s so close to Disneyland, it only takes ten minutes to walk. The next day I went to Disneyland to watch the fireworks and I was able to quickly return to the hotel without having to squeeze into the subway or take a taxi. I was really moved to tears! I also went to Disney Town for a bit the night before. There are no restaurants around the hotel, so you can go to the town to eat (the price is not low). In addition, the hotel can also go to Bicester, because it is suitable for a hotel, and the round-trip taxi fare can be reimbursed.
2. Breakfast - really good 👍 delicious! The noodles made on site are really good.
3. The hotel park is a large area of ​​green. After the rain, the smell of grass and rain is so fresh and comfortable.
Some inevitable flaws:
Room: The day we went happened to be extremely cold in Shanghai. The air conditioner was not hot and the sound was too loud when working.
Afternoon tea is included in the hotel ticket, how can I say it? I won’t order it if I can’t.
Some services:
Not very friendly. I was going to Disneyland the next day and asked about the breakfast time. The earliest meal time might not be enough to eat. The restaurant person said: We will start serving meals at this time. There will also be something around 6:30, but only enough to fill up.

All in all, I would still recommend this hotel to my friends and choose this hotel. Hope it gets better and better.

There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the wontons are better. There is a shuttle bus at the entrance of the hotel that can be delivered to the front desk. To go to Disneyland, you need to cross the road with traffic lights and walk for nearly 10 minutes.

If there is a chance next time, I will stay at Meliá next door.

In addition, the bathroom uses a shower curtain because it cannot effectively block the water splashed during bathing, causing the bathroom to be damaged that night.

(Because I have a young baby, the price of the paradise hotel is too high to consider. The price of this hotel is basically the same during the two days I stayed.

Then you walk to Disney for about 10 minutes. To be more rigorous, you It takes about five or six minutes to walk to Disney Town, and about four or five minutes to walk to the entrance of the town. We pushed the baby. If you don’t have any burden, it will probably be faster. Sisters who are afraid of distance, don’t be afraid, just rush and it’s over!

Disney’s current policy is that you can have unlimited entry and exit with a one-day ticket, so it is necessary to have a hotel nearby to take a rest, otherwise you will not be able to last the whole day.
	
About the hotel facilities: A typical Shanghai small bungalow, very distinctive. I was attracted by its characteristics at the time. The room is very large, and it is still spacious even after putting a crib. (A large room is very important to me now. I have to put some things in the room. You need to open the suitcase and put down the baby stroller. Compared with Wuzong, I personally think it will be more unique. Of course, some benefits and privileges of Wuzong will definitely be better. I stayed in an elegant courtyard king-bed room with a small courtyard outside, so it wasn't too comfortable.
	
About the hotel service: It was Chris**as when I made the reservation. The price was high and there was not much room to choose from. I only booked the remaining elegant courtyard twin room. Two days before my stay, the hotel called me to confirm the check-in information. , because it coincides with Chris**as, all Disney tickets for the two days are sold out. The hotel informed us whether we should continue the trip and reserve the room if we did not book the tickets. This is still very good. I informed that if there is a king bed room, I would like to change to a king bed room. As for the bed room, the hotel moved me to a double bed room after searching for a room. I don’t know if the room was vacant because the tickets were sold out. I always emphasize the need for a crib when confirming with the hotel, but so far, no hotel has brought the crib to the room in advance. Although it was brought to me when I arrived, it did not affect my use, but I always felt that the service The taste is a little bit off.
	
About the hotel breakfast: The hotel's breakfast is very rich. Because with a baby, the requirements for food will be very high. This is also one of the important reasons why I gave up playing games and chose Meliá. When going out to play, eating, drinking and playing should be placed on First of all, the breakfast at the hotel includes porridge, sweet potatoes, steamed buns and so on. Our one-year-old and two-month-old baby tastes particularly delicious. From this point of view, it is highly recommended. When I left, I went to the restaurant to ask for a glass of warm water for my baby. The staff gave me half a cup of boiled water and half a bottle of mineral water. They also asked me if the mineral water was okay. This really felt good.

Environment: The hotel environment is quite good. Whether in the public area or in the room, it is beautiful and quiet.
Hygiene: clean and tidy
Service: We have informed the child of his birthday in advance and need to surprise him with a cake the next day, but the hotel forgot about it! The children were very disappointed. Although they received cakes and dolls through Ctrip’s communication, they liked them very much. But I hope this kind of hotel, which is considered a "paradise bonus", can improve its service.

1 The scenery of the road and the internal grassland of the hotel is okay. You can open the door on the first floor and go directly to the grassland outside.
There were not many people there, maybe it was not in time for the statutory holiday. I felt that I didn’t see many people in the two days I stayed.
3. The hotel cost nearly 2,000 per night and there was no doorman to welcome or pick up the luggage. It was all on my own.
4. Breakfast is so good that I can count it. There are very few types. For example: it is a small area in another hotel. Imagine how many types there are. The restaurant is also very small, but this is usually where I go. At Disney, we can’t even eat breakfast, so it’s understandable.
5. There are many bugs on the first floor, the kind that will enter the house.
At 6 o'clock, the delivery person needs to pay an additional delivery fee ranging from 20 to 40 yuan, and there is no takeout, so you can buy delicious food in advance.

Then I planned to go to the Shanghai Wild Animal Park and the newly opened Transformers and My Little Pony Land. So I planned to stay nearby for another two days. I decided to change it. Meliá ~ I chose a suite at the same price ~ The room is twice as big as the Paradise Hotel ~ The Spanish-style old Shikumen building is quite unique ~ It’s very impressive ~ The service is also very good ~ Free first round mini bar ~
For meals, it’s very close to Disneytown or Bicester~
If I have to pick something that can be improved, I hope there will be an open trash can next to the sink, otherwise it will be too far to throw away toilet paper, cotton pads, etc. In addition, the sound insulation of my suite next to the elevator is poor, and the elevator dings after the children go to bed at night. It's so loud that every person riding in the elevator can hear it in the bedroom. It would be better to adjust the small ding-dong sound~

msg:I took my baby to Disneyland and stayed in a hotel in the park for one night. Then I moved here. There was too little water in the hotel room. When I came back in the evening, I called the front desk to ask for water, but it was not delivered. The room was nowhere to be found, and there was no store at the back. I almost died of thirst in the room. . .
It is inconvenient to go to Disneyland from the hotel. The hotel's battery car can only be delivered to the hotel door. It has to be a long walk to get out. It is not as good as the Park Hotel and Toy Story Hotel.
The hotel's battery car is very small and not enclosed. It's very windy when it's driven. We can't sit down. We chose to walk back. There is no separation between people and cars on the road. The baby ran on the roadside of the hotel and was almost hit by a car. There is no speed limit in the hotel? ? ? That car was going so fast it was terrifying. . . I followed the baby, but when I grabbed the baby's clothes, my hands were still shaking with fear! I will never come here again. I hope families with babies will choose carefully! ! ! The floor is not clean! The sound insulation is average! Not recommended! ! !

msg:The hotel is located in the Disney Resort. It takes about 10-15 minutes to walk from the hotel to the park. There is a shuttle bus from the gate to the front desk. It is about 300 meters away, but it is better to take the shuttle bus on a hot day to save effort. The hotel has a total of 6 buildings, 5 of which are residential, Shikumen architectural style, the room is generally about 40 square meters, the first floor has a courtyard, and the second floor has a small balcony. It depends on the guest's choice~ The check-in deposit is 300 yuan per night. Breakfast is at the front desk of Building 1. It's not big, and the food is average. You can eat whatever you want. The meal time is 7:00 am to 10:30 am. The service attitude is good, and it is much more cost-effective than staying in a Disneyland hotel...

Our family of four has two rooms on the same floor in the same building. , it was very quiet at night. The room was very large, with a bit of industrial literary style, with iron-framed windows and interior doors. The room was very clean. There seemed to be only one place for a light meal inside the hotel, which was in the breakfast room. We walked there the night before Meals in Disney Town

msg:I brought my children to Disneyland during the summer vacation. I carefully selected this hotel. When I arrived, I found it completely exceeded my expectations. The hotel is very quiet and located in the courtyard, but there are convenient shuttle buses to and from the gate of the compound and the hotel at 10 o’clock at night. The shuttle bus is still in service. It only takes ten minutes to walk from the entrance of the courtyard to the Disney town, but the price and environment are not inferior to the two hotels in the park. Although the breakfast is not as diverse as other big five-star hotels, it is very delicate and you can definitely eat well. All kinds of fruits are fresh and delicious. When I checked out, I was delayed until two o’clock in the afternoon. The only thing to note is that this kind of small western-style hotel has a lot of green plants and a lot of mosquitoes, but the mosquito repellent is thoughtfully prepared in the room. I want to ask for it again A drink in the refrigerator in the room was delivered quickly. There are many kinds of drinks for free during the stay. In short, I will come again in the future and recommend it to my friends.

The room type I booked has a balcony, the room area is large enough, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and a single sofa can sleep 180 people. The room faces a large lawn, and there are white magnolias planted downstairs. I feel that there are not too many people staying during this period, and walking in the garden in the morning is very clean. It is better than a Paradise Hotel. The windows can be opened for ventilation, and it is a ten-minute walk from the Paradise. There is a battery car from the lobby to the gate of the hotel park, which is very convenient. There are enough types of breakfast to meet nutritional needs. After coming back to pick up the luggage on the last afternoon, the service staff in the lobby didn't say goodbye. I felt unprofessional. Don't you want to have repeat customers? Still don't want me to recommend the hotel to my friends? It is recommended to improve it.

msg:Because the hotel I chose was close to Disney, I left early and returned late, so I basically didn't stay in the hotel. Arrived at the hotel around 8:00 p.m., there was no welcome at the door, and there was no service staff to help pick up the luggage. The front desk service awareness was relatively average.
In addition, the hotel shuttle bus is only delivered to the entrance of the hotel parking lot, not the entrance of the Disney park; (Disney needs to go to the hotel gate to catch a taxi to the taxi drop-off point to meet with the tour guide in the morning. The girl in the hotel shuttle bus repeatedly reminds that you can directly call the online car to come in with your mobile phone, and you are not willing to drive the shuttle bus to the door)
The bedding is not too dry and slightly damp; because you are in a hurry, breakfast is basically a simple bowl of small wontons. For families with two children, it is not necessary to add another three or four hundred for breakfast. If you are in a hurry, you can prepare some small dry food for breakfast.

Facilities: The basic facilities are complete, and the hotel walkway has repair cloth, which is not particularly beautiful;
Hygiene: basic clearance
Environment: I just went back to the hotel to sleep, it was quiet and deserted, I didn’t take a walk to appreciate the surrounding environment;
Service: The overall service awareness needs to be improved

msg:As a mother of a second child, I always have to give a good review or not. I have to take time out of my busy schedule to talk about how bad the experience of this hotel is. It’s really hard to say: 1. I regretted the decision as soon as I entered the lobby. hotel. As soon as I got off the taxi, there was no one at the door to greet me and help me with my luggage. When I entered the lobby, there was a pungent and unpleasant smell in the air. They said it was the smell of essential oils. Then there were only 2 people at the front desk rushing to process the registration. The smell was so strong Staying in the lobby for a second longer is afraid that the air will be harmful to my children. I was almost nauseated while waiting to check in. 2. I regret it even more after entering the room. After registration, a staff member took us into the room. We didn’t see any other guests along the way. There was still a pungent smell when we arrived in the room. After opening the drawers, there was a strong smell of formaldehyde. My baby also likes to open the drawers to play. I really think It is poisonous and not beneficial to children. The most frightening thing is that when you enter the room, you feel a spooky and scary a**osphere. The decoration has a kind of gloomy and cold wind. It’s also dirty, (the sofa forgot to take a photo) All helplessness is still thinking that it’s not easy to bring 2 dolls, just think about it and get used to it. 3. I really regret it after checking in. According to Ctrip’s introduction, this hotel is very close to Disneyland, but it’s not. In addition to the distance from the lobby to the entrance of the Disney town, there is a tram pick-up and drop-off, and it takes more than 20 minutes to walk to Disneyland from the gate. , the back and forth is really terrible, and the energy is spent outside Disney. It takes more than an hour for takeaway here, and it takes more than 20 minutes to go to Disney Town. For dinner, I have to go to the hotel kitchen to see what to eat. Sure enough, the so-called beef pasta is the kind of instant packaged pasta, and there is no meat. , children can't be hungry, this cheating 98 bowl of beef pasta can only be bought... 4. After checking out, I almost want to complain about this store. Why, after I checked out, I called and said that the bed sheets and towels in the room were dirty and couldn’t be washed out. I was sick to death. It was my child who accidentally got the bed sheets while eating blueberries. The hotel said that the bed sheets couldn’t be washed out all morning and they would be scrapped and asked me to pay 500 yuan for compensation A lot, later I said for a long time that the cost price was 200, and in the end 180 couldn’t be any cheaper, because I was too tired to quarrel with my children and I didn’t want to cast a shadow on the trip. I didn’t argue with them. It’s my fault, but to be honest, I I deeply feel that this hotel doesn’t wash the bedding at all, and they will be unhappy if my children get a little soiled sheets and they have to wash them, so they ask me to pay for it. Living in this store for more than 2,200 is really miserable, plus the compensation will cost 2,500 to live in, which is annoying... Dear friends, I advise you to be careful when choosing this store. My 3 and a half-year-old daughter told me that my mother no longer wants to live Here it is...

From the moment they entered the hotel gate, every staff member smiled, introduced enthusiastically, and interacted happily with the children. The luggage was delivered to the room in person, and I helped install the camper van to Disney, making me feel at home. 2. The hardware of the hotel exceeded my expectations. The hotel is mainly a garden-style two-story bungalow surrounded by a large area of ​​grass and flower beds. The room is very spacious. I booked a courtyard twin room with a big sofa and can sleep an adult. The staff immediately brought a set of bedding. The bathroom is big 🛁, you can relax! For me, a clean freak, the hotel's cleanliness is super satisfying! 3. The most convenient thing is: it takes only 10 minutes to walk to the entrance of Disneyland, which is great. It is guaranteed that we will enter the park at the entrance of the town early in the morning, and we can go back to the hotel to rest soon if we are tired. 4. It is also very convenient to book a car at the entrance of the hotel, or you can choose to walk to the Disney subway station.
When I come to Disneyland in the future, I will still choose this hotel, hoping to build a swimming pool and gym in the future.

Although the dining table is not big, it has everything you need, and the service is very good. Breakfast is only served at 6:30 in the morning, but I need to start around 6:10 at 6:00. The restaurant is very user-friendly for me. I brought breakfast, and I would like to thank the service staff in the restaurant and the lady at the front desk again. On the first night, we ordered two baby carriages on Taobao. When we picked up the car at night, the guy at the front desk took the initiative to help me pack the car and sent it to the elevator door of the room. When returning the car, he was also very proactive. Help me complete the procedures, thanks again!
The overall quality of the service staff is very high, active and enthusiastic, the hotel facilities are complete, children's slippers and toothbrushes are provided, and the mineral water in the room is replenished in a timely manner, and multiple bottles can be provided.
I have a very good impression of staying at this hotel this time! Strongly recommend friends who go to Disney, this hotel is definitely the first choice! ! !

The environment is quiet and comfortable, with a feeling of being in a Southeast Asian country, which will make people really feel like they are on vacation without the sense of urgency of the city.
The service attitude at the front desk is very good, and it is very convenient to store luggage.

The portions were very small. There was nothing around the hotel to order takeaway. You had to go outside the hotel to get it. You couldn’t even have it delivered. The food delivery robot did not ask the front desk to help deliver it. It was not possible. You had to go outside the hotel to get any service. There was no check-in. If you go to Disney, it is not recommended to stay in a hotel with more than 500 yuan. It is better than this one. There is a shuttle service and meals are not so expensive. There are Disney ticket locations that can also deliver takeaways. Not recommended. Very dissatisfied. It’s the same as the self-service one. They won’t help carry the luggage when leaving.

Environment: In the Disney resort, there are trees and grass, which can be used for elderly care. As long as you don't get sick, if you do, the poor place can't even deliver medicine. If you want to deliver it, you have to add 20 errand fees.
Service: The men inside are "very distinguished". Two girls are moving boxes there. The man sits at the front desk, either as the manager or receptionist... Oh, by the way, a bowl of wontons is 78, if you choose this hotel Yes (takeaway delivered by car), then you have to order 168 before it is delivered. In addition to the normal delivery fee, the delivery person will also add you 20 errands, and give him two bottles of water by the way... I am going back and forth during this trip. It cost almost 50,000 to 60,000 yuan to play for 7 days, which is not even less than 20 yuan. I am very angry because there are too many hidden expenses. Disney has become their gimmick. Not to mention raising prices, I really didn’t know that domestic service fees can be like this now. High... My service charge in London is only 12.5%, and their service charge adds up to almost 18%... Don't be ridiculous, in a country with a population of 1.4 billion, labor is so valuable... The hotel's management system is very poor, I I get angry just thinking about it, you can charge me, 3k a bowl is no problem, if you go a little higher, 4k a night is the same price as the Waldorf Astoria... Then at least you make me feel that you are making money and not cheating me. Everyone comes out to play during the National Day, and all they spend is their hard-earned money. You are falsely promoting and raising prices. It is really "Chinese people only make money from Chinese people", right?

The hotel has a quiet environment, the rooms are large and exquisite, and although there are not many dining options, they all taste good👍The most important thing is the service attitude of every employee, who is kind and courteous, and can proactively provide help when we need it. Makes me feel warmer. When we checked in, we learned that our family was traveling and upgraded the room type for us so that we could stay together. Every staff member at dinner was very friendly and accommodating. Especially Mr. Li Weiya, not only reminded us to get the free ride discount, but also took the initiative to help us call a taxi. There was also a gentleman who picked us up by electric car (sorry, because I couldn't see the nameplate clearly at night). When my child was a little disappointed that he didn't sit in the seat he wanted, he offered to take us back and forth again. He was more understanding of the child's mood. I was so touched. Meliá provides not only accommodation, but also the warmth of home. I think the way to express my love for Meliá is to leave a five-star review, so that everyone who sees it will choose Meliá next door without hesitation😆

A hotel that is not good for celebrating the New Year. It is the Spring Festival Paradise Hotel 5K+. I think I will stay in the park every time. I read the comment earlier that Meliá is only a 10-minute walk from Disneyland. The overall environment is impressive. Compared with the price of Toy Story, which is about 3K, it is comparable, so I chose the neighbor Meliá. I checked in with joy and never expected such a bad experience. I returned to Meliá at 11 o'clock that day after playing in Disneyland. Because the restaurants in the park were closed, the children ordered takeaway when they said they were hungry, and the delivery arrived. I was told that I couldn’t be delivered to the resort, and it was freezing cold, so I contacted the front desk for a battery car to take us out and pick it up at the gate, but the front desk said they couldn’t help (check in in the morning, depart from Disney, and come back from Disney, aren’t they all connected by battery cars? ) In the end, after a lot of twists and turns, I paid 100 yuan to the takeaway brother to take a Didi car to deliver it... I really can't understand what this is. I didn't expect the hotel staff to help us pick it up, and there was no way to send it out with a battery car...Meliá originally There is no food or drink when it is late, what should customers do? Keeping kids hungry until tomorrow morning? After the child washes up, look at the bed, not to mention ~ 99.999...% The bedding has not been changed, and the man's short hair is still on the pillow below... So I couldn't sleep well all night, and I didn't eat breakfast the next day. Hurry up withdraw…
When I came back, my friend told me about the house price on weekdays, and I didn’t even want to talk…
I looked through the reviews of other guests, and I really hit the point~
It's natural to increase the price during holidays, but such a beautiful hotel has poor sanitation and poor service. It really shouldn't be

msg:1. It is indeed very close to Disney Town, but the location is difficult to find. Disney employees and passers-by didn’t know where the hotel was, so I spent a long time looking for directions on the night I checked in🤷🏻♀️
2. The hotel fragrance is a bit strong and not very comfortable. It is recommended to switch to other higher quality fragrances...
3. It’s not a smart toilet🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻… I’m a little surprised…
4. Praise the cleaning lady for folding my clothes 😂😂😂, she is really dedicated~
5. Don’t all hotel front desk uniforms have uniform uniforms? It feels like everyone’s clothes are messy, unbuttoned, and colorful private clothes are exposed underneath, and there are even employees who have dyed their hair?
6. If you buy an early access card, it is actually very inconvenient because the hotel does not pick you up to the door before seven o'clock... I am a bit speechless.
7. The training of waiters really needs to be strengthened. They looked at us carrying large and small bags and showed no intention of helping us...
8. The male staff who pick up and drop off the shuttle bus at night are very nice and will help with luggage. The service is very considerate🙋🏻♀️

Maybe it's my problem. I thought this kind of service would be provided by a hotel at this price. They are all standard. The attitude of the staff is okay. Maybe the price is just because of the location. You shouldn't ask too much for other things. In addition, the bedside is like a decoration and has no effect at all.

It's our fault that we didn't know how to bring a thermometer and a thermometer when we came out to play What about medicines? I had to order takeaway, but the park was not allowed to enter. It was the first time for the delivery man to deliver to the park. We didn’t know how to get there. We were also a little confused. We asked the staff on duty at the front desk for help to point out the way and find a way. At the beginning, we were told to talk to him It's nothing to do, can't help, and the attitude is pretty bad. Later, we said that we can call a car for the delivery guy to send it in. In the end, the medicine was delivered after one o'clock. We are very dissatisfied with the service attitude of the staff on duty that night. After the complaint, the hotel's handling method and attitude are still acceptable. I hope the hotel will strengthen its service training, otherwise I am really sorry for the price. Furthermore, the doors of the toilet and bathroom are not closed tightly. There are people working outside around 7:00 every morning, which is a bit noisy.

msg:Everything else feels good and is worth the price. However, the breakfast experience was very poor and there were few varieties. For breakfast on the first day, I asked the omelette staff to make me an omelette. They replied expressionlessly. When I came to pick it up after a while, someone else had already taken the egg away. Sorry, it's not sincere at all to say sorry. For breakfast the next day, I asked the omelette man to make me an omelette again. This man was even more ridiculous and didn't make it. I went to get another omelette after a while. I asked him if the previous one didn't do it, but he didn't answer. I asked him to make another one without saying a word or smiling. He made it by himself. After frying it for me, he put it on the plate without saying a word! A noodle and wonton cook named Xia asked him to cook a bowl of wontons and a bowl of rice noodles directly for you. I later told him that what I ordered was wonton stew and asked him to cook it. He only cooked a bowl of wontons for you. Those should be cooked. Even the side dishes were not cooked for me! Fortunately, I don’t eat those side dishes, but what do you mean by not cooking them without asking me for my opinion? ! ! Is it wrong to use polite language to you? I think our guests treat you politely! You are still in heaven! It's really annoying, even if there are not many breakfast varieties, it can't even keep up with the average hotel breakfast! The attitude of the restaurant staff makes it difficult to eat! Fortunately, the girls at the front desk were very enthusiastic, and there was also a concierge who was a bit tall and handsome, and his attitude was also very good. The hotel environment is very good in other aspects, but the breakfast is too moody. Just imagine, when the guests wake up early in the morning to have breakfast, they are faced with these faces, and they can't eat!

msg:The location of the hotel, which is close to Disney, is the only advantage. There is only a lobby bar inside the hotel. Relatively speaking, the starting price of 1800 yuan/night is too expensive, and the content is too small. To put it simply, it is impossible for the residents of the hotel to stay in the hotel for a whole day here, because the hotel does not have such a function, just to go to Disney next to it, that is not the function of sleeping! On the other hand, hotels starting at 1,800 yuan per night in the urban area have richer internal supporting functions. So the price is still too high.

I called the front desk, and the front desk also told me to find another door, so that I lost countless heads at the door, walked countless circles, wasted 40 minutes, and wanted to cry without tears.

We went to the amusement park first and then returned to the hotel on Friday. There was nothing to eat, not even instant noodles. So we had to prepare enough food. We ordered takeout and asked us to come out to get it ourselves. We entered the park again the next morning and paid 199 after two o'clock when we came out. It is still recommended to stay at the Paradise Hotel.

msg:I didn’t stay in Shanghai during November, so I made an appoin**ent for Disney’s annual pass and the Meliá Hotel next door three weeks in advance. It's such a great value here, although there's a premium on the holidays. Ctrip's package is very cost-effective, and the afternoon tea sent is very Chinese, which is difficult to eat on weekdays. The whole hotel is very green, and the baby likes to run on the big lawn very much. The room floor is not good, the indoor space is also very large, the environment is very quiet, and the air is also very good. The facilities all look new and clean. The service staff is very in place, and the enthusiasm and meticulousness are just right. If you arrive early, you can go through the formalities first and then get the room card, so you won't feel crowded even during the eleventh period.
The best thing is the buffet breakfast, as everyone said, although the variety is not particularly rich, but there are all kinds of classics, and the taste is very good, if you try each, you can eat it all Eat well, do more than waste.
It is very suitable for playing two days and one night with the Disney annual card, and it is also very close to Disney. Although the golf cart can only be delivered to the hotel gate, half of the journey has been solved. I hope that the package price will always be the same, then it will kill all other accommodations in the resort.

msg:Transportation: Very convenient, self-driving cars can park in the hotel parking lot for free and then we walk to Disneyland for about 10-15 minutes

Hygiene: We live on the first floor of the courtyard room. There is a damp and moldy smell when we walk into the corridor. The corridor hotel uses fragrance to cover it up, but it feels more serious when we enter the room.

The shower room is on slate floors. My daughter accidentally slipped and I tried to open the anti-skid pads, but all of them were densely covered with mold. At that time, my scalp was numb from nausea, and black mold was found on my hands. There is also mildew under the rain curtain, which is really uncomfortable to watch, so the environment is greatly negative!

Environment: The most speechless thing is that there is no door in the bathroom and no door in the shower! What do Spanish designers think! This design is neither moisture nor smell, I don't understand it at all! The overall environment of the hotel is still a plus, the courtyard design and interior design are very tasteful. You can still take pictures!

Service: The service is quite satisfactory, front desk service and concierge service are very timely. The breakfast is rich, Chinese and Western food choices are complete, and there are special Spanish sausages. There is a shuttle bus to and from the hotel lobby and the hotel gate directly, which can slightly shorten the distance to Disney.

Xiao Shen took us to the guest room. The restaurant, the shuttle bus brother and the cleaning aunt are all very polite, and the service is also proactive; breakfast and afternoon tea are very nice; last night, I went back to the hotel after watching the fireworks from the park. Although it was raining heavily, the battery car was still waiting to take us to the lobby ; The decoration of the guest room is simple and a**ospheric, the night light is very distinctive and convenient; the bathroom with dry and wet separation is very comfortable, in short, the hotel brings us a comfortable feeling, and will come again.

msg:This is the 4th time to come to Melia next door, this time with the elderly. Booked two rooms and was upgraded to a courtyard room as desired.
The little girl at the front desk has a very good attitude. The fat brother next to us took us all the way to the room with our luggage.
In the evening, I asked the front desk for four bottles of water (two for each room). During the period, no one answered the three buttons of "Front Desk", "Room Service" and "Housing Depar**ent" in the room. After waiting for half an hour, I called and got through. But the little brother who answered the phone said that he could give him two bottles of water at most, and he couldn't give him any more. As a hotel of this class, it's a bit stingy. On a hot day, I think it is not necessary for customers to give two more bottles of water within a reasonable range.
During the epidemic, the hotel did a good job in epidemic prevention and control
When checking in in the afternoon, everyone who drives into the gate must show their personal code (including children), and they need to show it again when entering the lobby. I think it is strictly right, very time and actively cooperate! But when I visited Yiou in the evening, when I came back, from the time I entered the door, I asked if you have checked in? can come in. Entering the lobby is even more unobstructed all the way, no one asks a question... I think this is a loophole in epidemic prevention
Others are very good

After a long time of inspection, nothing happened. I asked again after two hours and it was said that it was taken away by a guest in a certain room. If it was taken away, why don't you go to him to get it back? You want me to come to you again and again. The customer who took my mask is really of low quality. He took it if it wasn’t yours? I took it wrong and still want to use it? I'm so convinced. Although they helped me recover it in the end due to my tough attitude, I was still very angry. I found that something was missing. The staff told me that the other party didn't use my things... Did I buy less things myself? You are better than me. Still clear? If you have to wait for me to tell the hotel to compensate, I should go find the guest in that room and ask him to compensate, then the hotel can make up for it, and the staff should be trained again😅😅😅

I went back around 8 pm to wash up and get ready. I found a pool of blood on the quilt cover while sleeping, so I called the waiter to change it. After leaving the hotel on the 25th, we went to Disney Town to buy some things. When we came back and drove back, we found that our sunglasses were missing. We went to the front desk and asked the hotel to find them. They said the room had been tidied but nothing was found. I insisted on going to the room and found that it had not been tidied at all. However, the sheets and duvet covers were removed and the trash cans were collected. No one in the hotel admitted that they had taken my glasses. Now think back to the next day. Someone must have gone in, because the child was too young and played too crazy and got a little feverish, so I had to leave first, but I will never come to a hotel like this again.

We live on the 2nd floor, and the small balcony is so refreshing. The first breath of air in the morning is so fresh that I can't help calling my mother, come and take a breath, hahaha. The hotel's afternoon tea and buffet breakfast are all very appetizing. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to Disney Town, and it is only 3 kilometers away from Yioulai. It is very convenient to eat, stay and play. I will come again next time.

🍃Indoor environment: There is a multi-functional restaurant in the lobby on the first floor, breakfast in the morning and afternoon tea in the afternoon. After checking in, the waiter took us to the 3rd floor. As soon as we entered the door, there was a walk-in corridor with a large space. The bathroom was separated from wet and dry, and there was a shower and a sitz bath. After that, it was a big room with a big place. The furnishings are simplified. Except the floor feels a little old and everything is fine~

Due to working days and during the epidemic, there were very few people staying and it was very quiet~

The child is eight months old. The shuttle bus arrives at the hotel, and the customer service helps with luggage. T pushes the trolley all the way to the room. Not to mention the high-quality service, I think each room type is spacious enough, with a wide view, and the first floor has its own garden. The balcony on the second floor is also very spacious. The hotel has its own large lawn. In addition, the afternoon tea and buffet breakfast are strongly recommended. It is also delicious. It is no less than any five-star restaurant in Shanghai. Parents, don't go to the Disney Hotel, just go to the neighbor's house. The Disney shuttle bus will take you to the door of the hotel, and it's a 10-minute walk. The price is also affordable and close to the people, it is really a treasure hotel

Breakfast the next day was also very good.
Some commented that there were few varieties, but we were fully satisfied with the impression that each one was carefully made and the appearance and taste were good.
It was a stay just to sleep on the way back from Disney, but I was satisfied with everything ◡̈♥︎
Thank you for the pleasant time.

The location of the hotel is very good, there is no pressure to walk, and a six-year-old child can walk the whole journey by himself. Personally, it is more convenient and quieter than Disney and Toy Story. The two companies are noisy because there are many children and it is unavoidable. Now in winter, the house is full of heating. After watching the fireworks at Disney, I returned to the room tired and cold, and was cured in a second. The breakfast room is not big and there are not many varieties, but it is simple and refined. There is even Wangzai milk. Although it is not a rarity, I am very happy to see it. Another very simple and delicious, that is, white porridge is delicious, everyone's eating habits are different, I drank a bowl of hot white porridge with side dishes in the morning, and I woke up, but not every hotel's white porridge is delicious. of. In short, I personally think Melia next door is great, and I will choose to stay when I come to Disney in the future.

Children like the oversized lawn very much, and it is quiet at night. The breakfast place is not big but the food is very complete, no need to wait in line. I ordered the room service in the evening, the portion was large and the taste was good. The only thing is that it is mainly noodles. There are not many choices. It is recommended to add more categories. In addition to asking about Disney’s route, the front desk clerk responded vaguely. It would be more intimate if the hotel could provide a map to Disney.

Fortunately, the check-in was late and only stayed for one night. The only service is ok The advantage is that it's not far from Disney...

msg:In the current situation, it is not suitable for inter-provincial tourism, so you can only relax in the local Disney Resort in Shanghai. In the end, I chose the Melia Hotel next door, which is very close to Disney Town, a 10-minute walk from the gate to the park. Back to the hotel, although the overall scale is not large, the green coverage rate is very high. Surrounded by a large lawn, the buildings are surrounded by golden osmanthus, which makes it quiet and comfortable. The hotels are all two-story Shikumen style, the rooms are large, the layout is spacious and there is a small courtyard in the courtyard room, if a family of three does not need an extra bed (the sofa is huge). The breakfast is not rich, but it is absolutely exquisite, and the small wontons are delicious. Perhaps the only shortcoming of the hotel is that due to its small size, there are no swimming pools and children's leisure facilities, but since it is adjacent to resorts and small towns, these are actually not important.

I was very happy. I carefully felt the hotel’s equipment, bedding, bathtub and sanitary ware. The five-star hotels I have stayed in before are not inferior.

msg:The overall feeling is very good, can give 4.8 points. The reasons for giving this point are:

First, the location is good! It’s really only a ten-minute walk from Disneyland, which is very convenient, and half of these ten minutes are wandering on the lakeside path of Starwish Lake, enjoying the music in Disneyland, which is very immersive!

Second, good service! The handsome and beauties at the front desk and the service in the breakfast room are also very kind, without any sense of disobedience! It's also not like some comments that there are few people and poor attitude, maybe the training and quality have been strengthened 😄!

Third, the facilities are good! We live in 5019 on the first floor with a courtyard. It is very quiet. The decoration is what my wife likes. The colors and materials match the positioning and environment of the old bungalows.

The only downside is that I ordered a 1188 package (breakfast + accommodation + afternoon tea) for one night, and I ordered two for two nights. But I will check out at 12 noon on the third day. I went to the front desk and asked if the second afternoon tea is not available. When there is any way, a middle-aged man with a stomachic head (he said he lives in Dongfang Road, Pudong) The answer was very rude, and I just said there was no way. I didn't even say a second sentence with him, so I said: I know. Because it's my wife's birthday, I don't want our mood to be ruined by this man!

Finally, I would like to thank the little butlers of Ctrip for helping my wife to fight for two free cakes🍰. I have always regarded Ctrip as my family and backstage. If there is any grievance, there will always be Ctrip butlers for their meticulous care and care! ❤️❤️❤️

msg:Transportation: It's really close to Disney. Let's put it this way, I started walking from the hotel entrance, waiting for a red light in the middle, and went to Disney Town to check the application code and itinerary card. It took 10 minutes in total. After watching the fireworks, you have arrived at the hotel with the effort of others to go to the parking lot. The price is similar to that of Toy Story, but the environment should be much better, so I think it's a good deal to buy an extra early card when staying in this hotel.

Hygiene: I live on the first floor, there will be a little smell when I just walk in, maybe it's greening. The overall sanitary condition is still very good. I made a small suggestion. I couldn't take out the toilet paper, so I opened the leather box. The inside was velvet and quite dirty.

Environment: All rooms have bathtubs. What I am particularly satisfied with is the design of the bathtub and shower room together, so that you don't have to work hard when cleaning the bathtub, just use the shower to rinse directly. Soak in a hot bath after a day of play, which is much more comfortable. And the water out of the bathtub is very large, and it will fill up quickly.

Service: The overall is good, you will greet you when you enter and exit. The front desk is about 500 meters away from the gate. It’s fine to walk around in good weather. It’s tiring if it’s hot, but the battery car to the hotel’s entrance is open on demand. The point is good. But I want to remind everyone that this is located in the resort area, and the mode of transportation is either walking or 4-wheel motor vehicles. So if you order a takeaway, you must confirm if it can be delivered. I ordered a fruit takeaway. The takeaway drove a battery cart and was stopped more than 1 kilometer away.

If you buy an extra breakfast for 159 yuan, there are really not many types, but the quality is still good, you can eat enough, and there are freshly cooked small wontons and noodles.

I lived in a courtyard twin room on the first floor. I was worried about the security on the first floor, but found that he had two doors. One screen door close to the room could only be opened from the inside to the outside, and it was locked. The outer door can also be locked. And the door glass facing the courtyard is a mirror from the outside, so you can't see the inside of the room.

Finally, let’s talk about the mattress. Generally speaking, the mattress is neither too hard nor too soft, but it may be because of my poor waist. I am used to sleeping on a hard mattress. It cannot be concave downward. But their mattresses will still be concave downwards, so in the end I slept on the sofa circled in Figure 2, which is long and wide. The key is that the cushions fully meet my standards and people will not sink when they sleep.

The hotel provides a shuttle bus from the lobby to the hotel entrance. The hotel is very new as a whole, with rows of bungalow-style two-story small buildings inlaid in the hotel’s green spaces and gardens. Because the two days were booked separately, the hotel was upgraded to a room type with a small courtyard on the first floor. The room is very large, the Shikumen style design is very distinctive, the bathroom separates dry and wet. The bedding is clean and comfortable. The air conditioning in the room is very good. The room cleaning was very intimate and helped us put the toothpaste, tooth cup, facial cleanser and other items neatly on the new hand towels. There are not many types of breakfast, but they are exquisite and delicious. There are pumpkin seeds, raisins and other ingredients in the fried rice, which is a pleasant surprise. If you have any shortcomings, you will stay at this hotel when you go to Disneyland. Apart from not being able to enjoy Disney's shuttle bus, the experience is even better than that of the Disney Hotel, and it is more cost-effective.

msg:To go to Shanghai Disneyland by car, there is a parking lot in the hotel which is very convenient. There is absolutely no problem for two adults with a child who stayed in a double bed room of 2 meters * 2 meters. It is also possible to add an extra bed, but it will be charged separately. The hotel is very close to Disney, about 10 minutes walk, very convenient. The style of the key hotel is very fond of being able to take pictures beautifully, breakfast is also good, and children will be charged another 105 yuan. It was rainy weather, and the sheets were not too dry, but everything else was OK.

The service staff is very polite and friendly, and reminded to send the children's toiletries and slippers. The room is very spacious, but the single bed is too small for two adults.

I had to re-select the hotel to see that the location of the hotel is very good. It only takes more than ten minutes to arrive at Disneyland. The hotel environment is good. Very quiet and clean, there is a large lawn in the backyard where you can take your children to play, and it is very cost-effective!

msg:On Saturday, I came to Disneyland with my daughter, and compared it on the Internet for a long time, and finally chose Melia next door. Mainly because of the discount, I did not expect the hotel to upgrade the room type for free when checking in, with a balcony, Nordic decoration, separation of dry and wet, large sofa, mobile phone music effect is very good, we are very satisfied. The bed is also very comfortable and will not cause back pain when sleeping.
The breakfast room is not big, and the variety is not too large, but the taste is very good. The tables next to us praised the breakfast as good as we did.
We left our luggage in the hotel and went to Disneyland to play. We returned to the hotel after tired of playing in the afternoon. There was free afternoon tea, as shown in Figure 1. It tastes good, just to replenish energy, macarons are especially delicious.

msg:Will not stay again in the future. Ctrip marked it as a five-star hotel, but the price of five-star, 3-star environment. The sound insulation is very poor, the sound of children walking on the second floor and the sound of talking in the corridor make it impossible to sleep in at all. The hotel room delivery time is from 11:30 am to 11:00 pm. The price of the room delivery belongs to the five-star price. A bowl of beef noodles is 128 yuan, but five-star hotels should all deliver meals 24 hours a day. ? If you are hungry in the morning or in the middle of the night, there is no way to provide catering services. There is no gym, no indoor swimming pool, and the color of the interior of the room is also dark green, which feels very depressing. I thought it was close to Disney, so I chose him and stayed for 3 nights. I wanted to relax, eat, drink, sleep, and sleep, but I didn't sleep well and didn't have many dining options. The hotel feels no different from a homestay. If you have a car, you can choose a five-star hotel a little further away. The price is half cheaper and the service etc should be twice as good.

酒店前台幽幽地説，我們這裏可以叫外賣，有的餐廳老闆會自己開車送進來，言下之意是，我叫的外賣遇人不淑。
然後我又問，那酒店有什麼辦法嗎？前台再次幽幽地説，這個和他們酒店沒關係，建議我以差評要挾騎手步行4公里送進來，或者打12345投訴上海文旅局和公安局。
就這樣的酒店，你指望他們的服務？

缺點是距離迪士尼小鎮衹能走過去，雖然衹要十分鐘，但是在迪士尼暴走一天以後，這十分鐘就很漫長，而且就算中午想回酒店休息也很難（太遠），冬天都要走一身汗，夏天真的不敢想。
還有一個是酒店環境真的好，一片草坪，不過夏天應該蟲子會多。
總的來説，這個酒店性價比要遠高於迪士尼酒店，有很多優點，對於情侶和帶長者來的住這裏沒有任何問題，吃飯、住宿水準都在線。但是有一説一，如果想體驗全天泡在樂園的體驗，那就必須住迪士尼酒店，在迪士尼酒店的感覺就是你一直都在遊樂園（當然了，物價也是與樂園內看齊的）

房間還是比較大的，迪士尼2家酒店的房間整體偏小，他這的房間就寬敞很多，雖然不像迪士尼的房間有各種主題，但是我們一家子人比較多，哪怕房間有一張大床再加張小床的情況下也沒顯得擁擠，房間小冰箱裏的飲料首次也是免費的，咱基本全喝完了，迪士尼這邊超市實在太少了，房間外是個小庭院，配了個躺椅，小孩子在裏面散養着也不錯。這次也很感謝前台沈經理還有羅夢瑤的貼心服務，臨走還送了個樂高小玩具給孩子，孩子非常開心

小孩在房間推椅子，不小心把牆角磕掉了一塊，早上很忐忑的跟酒店工作人員説了，以為要賠錢，結果對方説沒事，會讓師傅去看看修補好，可能會產生一些費用。晚上回到房間破的地方已經修補好了，而且最終也沒有讓我們出錢。退房的時候還送了孩子一個小禮物。很貼心。

早餐很精緻，咖啡可以讓服務員幫忙製作。
酒店有很大片草地，早上不趕時間就帶娃在草地玩了會飛盤。
酒店距離迪斯尼很近，應該是可以提前辦入住，車子停在酒店，再坐酒店班車去迪斯尼的，這樣可以免費停車，有需求可以提前諮詢酒店，我們當初是直接去的迪斯尼再去的酒店

msg:住了有一段時間了，如果要去迪斯尼特別推薦入住哦……老上海的石庫門風格，裝修很精緻趕緊。總體來説小而精。大片大片的綠色草地，適合天氣好的時候在草地上放飛，而且去迪斯尼也特別方便，走路的距離跟把車停在停車場走過去的距離差不錯。

  早餐方面種類也不多，用餐高峯期也需要等位，印象深刻的，有養樂多。選這家酒店，是喜歡它西班牙式的風格，陽台，大落地窗，還是貴妃沙發，個人感覺，如果夏天入住的話讓人更舒適。

msg:去年剛回國的解除隔離的時候去迪士尼玩，訂的就是這個酒店。前幾天女朋友過生日，於是我們今年第二次打卡這個酒店想尋回去年的同等極致體驗。酒店服務還是很棒，環境愜意，我訂的一樓帶院落的大床房。

唯一感到略有不爽的是，給女朋友點蠟燭的時候發現沒有打火機，跟前台要打火機的時候前台不幫忙弄，前台解釋説酒店禁止吸煙沒有打火機，在我再三請求並解釋吹完蠟燭就好之後，下前台依舊保持觀點。無奈的我最終在大堂向其他客人借了一下打火機，並回房間把蛋糕和蠟燭搬到室外庭院裏。外面蚊子很多，風也不小，幾經波折終於為女朋友成功慶生。

客觀來講酒店前台沒有問題，但是我之所以選擇這個酒店給女朋友過生日就是對這個酒店的服務抱有很強烈的期待，並不是住不起迪士尼。這家酒店之所以效益還不錯，因為它離迪士尼很近，走路衹有10分鐘，且價格要遠低於旺季的迪士尼酒店。但是，做服務行業的要放正心態，千萬不能抱有“我是不可替代的，你們不住，反正有人住”的心裏。

房間禁止吸煙並不等於酒店不能過生日點一支慶生蠟燭，房間做不了完全可以站在客户的角度提出一個解決方案，而不是一句“房間禁止吸煙”直接把天聊死，讓客户自己原地懵逼無可奈何。

另外酒店的房間送餐好像到晚上十點就結束了，我十二點的時候非常餓，還好酒店有自動販賣機，我買了一碗35塊錢的方便麪。

房間可以佈置氣球之類的，但是我呼籲大家合理佈置，離店之前幫忙收拾一下，我把東西整理好了才辦理退房的，畢竟阿姨們自己去弄也會很辛苦。

最後附上一張女朋友的照片。

有一天晚飯沒吃，在酒店吃的，價格有點離譜，葱油麪將近100，紅燒牛肉麪128，mini bar和自動售貨機也很貴，總之999的價格含雙早，每天含兩個冰激凌球還是很推薦
另外，推薦租小推車，省去孩子很多體力，家長累點就算了
後邊住了一天萬怡，比較之下更推薦鄰家，房間設施可玩性什麼的，萬怡住的好憋屈，房間跟迷宮似的，飯好難吃

但是，酒店的服務需要提高，早餐一般，午晚餐衹供應簡餐，來度假沒啥好吃的，感覺就缺了點什麼。
另外，此次買的是套餐，除了冰淇淋劵，其他福利一概沒有享受到。

唯一的缺點就是，酒店不負責把客人送到迪士尼門口（檢測體温那個位置）需要客人自己出門繞過半個心願湖。大概5到6分鐘路程，平時還好，夏天曬**
