msg:Hotel is not bad, but during our stay, most of the common areas were quite cold. Also, water in the main pool was quite cold, as well as the air temperature, making it unpleasant. It is ok for pure swimming, but since it is a family hotel, temperature should be fine also for kids playing. Service in the Merket restaurant was quite poor, while in the Chinese restaurant the service was very good, as well as the food, much better than in the Market. Breakfast is good.
There is a small outside playground with animals. Some of the animals (the cow, the small rodents‚Ä¶) look a little bit suffering. 

If you don‚Äôt speak Chinese it is quite difficult to understand what kind of activities can be done (in the hotel or with hotel support), and nobody is proposing anything at first.

All in all, not thinking to come back.

msg:The location for this establishment is great but, for a 5 star hotel, this has been my worst experience and stay. Many of the room switches does not correspond with what was labelled eg: master switch only turns off the lights by the curtains, bathroom switch turns off the dining room lights. The dog park located in the hotel does not have light at night, which was a disappointment as we took our dogs along expecting to be able to let them run around at night. Upon leaving, we decided to have a quick bite at ÂíñÂï°ÂéÖ. We were informed that there will be a 45 ‚Äòminute wait time which was completely understandable knowing it is the golden week in china. But what we did not expect was to have to have 15 minutes for a canned sparkling water, hot milk and a cold latte. The food came out quickly after, they served the burger on a shovel, for the ease of eating, I requested for a plate. Having to wait 20 minutes just for a plate was just unreasonable, I had to remind them to bring the plate to me, by then the burger was cold and inedible. I requested for a new burger which they accepted, but to my surprised,  the person in charge came to ask if I would like a new burger after 20 minutes and it is after previous waiter and waitress confirmed that the burger was already being re-fired. 

The only thing that made our stay warm and brighten up our experience was Martin Zhu in the F&B department. He was great to help arrange seats for us in varies outlets so that we could bring along our two dogs. On our second day, after a disappointing meal outside of the hotel, Martin also quickly came to our rescue by preparing food for us when we were back. Overall, the experience would have been terrible if it wasn‚Äôt for him.

The next morning, the housekeeper confirmed the check-in time in advance, added WeChat and took the initiative to remind me that the Yangtze River Tunnel toll on the day of check-in could be reimbursed. The hotel staff, whether at the front desk or on the road, were very friendly and would greet me with a smile, which made me feel very happy. This trip was mainly for children. The indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds are relatively small and suitable for small children. The hotel swimming pool is quite good, and it is not the peak season. There are only about 20 people throughout the whole trip, which is very comfortable. There are quite a lot of breakfast varieties, but there don't seem to be many that suit my taste. I wanted to find a tofu pudding but couldn't find it. Although the room facilities are a bit old, the hygiene work is still good. Overall, it is a relatively satisfactory stay experience.

We chose this place because it is relatively close to Disney, the environment is good according to the introduction, and it is a brand hotel.
We had a butler in advance, and we could get quick feedback on any questions.

Facilities: The facilities are old, but my family doesn't like too new ones. This kind of old but well-maintained one is more reassuring.

Hygiene: The room is clean and tidy, and the public area restaurant is very clean.
Environment: The hotel is relatively large, with several buildings connected, and it is easy to get around.
Service: Check-in and check-out are very convenient, and the staff are relatively friendly. Because it is a pet-friendly hotel, I saw someone bring üê∂
Advantages: The rocking chair in the room is good, the breakfast is not too much, but the dining a**osphere is good, and the coffee quality in the lobby bar is also good.
The disadvantage is that the swimming pool is closed for maintenance on Friday, and the buffet is only available on Saturday.

If compared to Yuyou, the room size was okay. There was a swing double seat on the balcony and a coffee table to dry. Clothes hangers, the Internet speed is indeed very slow, I use my own network, the hygiene is not bad, the equipment is complete, the towels are not new, but they are clean, the pressure, temperature and drain of the bath are OK, the air conditioner is not loud, mini The bar is a bit noisy but it doesn't affect your sleep. The mini bar has 3 kinds of beer and carbonated drinks for free. The beds and pillows are a little soft. I forgot to ask if the hotel provides hard pillows. The environment of the swimming pool, gym and children's playground It's also very good, clean and tidy. Everywhere we go, there are staff who greet us warmly. From the hotel lobby to our room, we need to walk through a very long corridor. Personally, I think it's acceptable. It takes about 5 minutes. There are two lovely corridors in the hotel. The dogs, Lucky and Maomao, work from 9 to 5 o'clock, and 6 Birds is open 24 hours a day. The breakfast is very rich and tastes good. The egg pancakes are freshly made and thoughtfully cut into several sections. , all kinds of pickles and porridge are delicious, fruits and vegetables are very fresh, but I am a bit regretful that I didn't eat Chongming cake. The hotel gave me a small cake for my child's birthday. I don't care about the taste and size. It was quite fun to take pictures to add to the fun. Yes, the buffet dinner and pet park were not open, which was a bit disappointing (I had no choice but to choose Youyou‚Äôs buffet and stepped on the trap). If you have plans, it is recommended to call the hotel in advance to confirm. In addition, there are not many places to eat and play near the hotel, and it is not far away. Some scenic spots, such as Juanjuan Ranch, Dongping Forest Park, and Wanda, require a 40-minute drive. The butler's service presence is very average, dispensable, and has no substantial help. He is also asked to comment, front desk and customer service , the security service is very patient and careful, the pet breeders are very enthusiastic, and can make people feel that they really like small animals. Overall, they are quite satisfied and have good reviews.

The overall feeling is that the hotel is really too old, and the facilities are very old, such as the dilapidated tissue box, the dusty towel box in the corners, the moldy silicone *****s in the shower room, and the toilet is not smart. The power supply is turned on blindly. The right side of the bathroom and the right side of the desk in my room have no power.
The most need to complain is the food and beverage. The breakfast is relatively simple. I have eaten in the hotel‚Äôs two restaurants: 799 and Pinyue. The taste is average and the price-performance ratio is average. I especially want to complain about the casserole bacon and vegetable rice. The rice used is really bad. This may be the worst rice I have ever eaten. Chongming produces Dongtan rice, and the rice used in the hotel is so bad, dry and hard!
The hotel is not big overall, there is nothing to visit. Some cute pets are quite cute, but there are old aunts chattering and noisy everywhere.

By the way, the Chinese restaurant Pinyue in Hyatt is absolutely better than all the farmhouses in Chongming. It can be said to be the best in Chongming.

msg:During the May Day holiday, I was lucky enough to stay at Chongming Jinmao Hyatt Hotel because I attended a 3-day wedding banquet. In order to avoid the traffic jam on May 1, I chose to leave the city at noon on the 30th. Although I reluctantly paid the 50 yuan toll, it took only about 10 minutes to reach the hotel after getting off the highway. The first meeting gift was that the hotel reimbursed me for the 50 yuan toll, which made me feel warm. 
The design of the hotel lobby is simple and elegant, and the various areas are connected by fully enclosed corridors. Due to the large number of corridors, it is easy to get lost when I come here for the first time, and I have to linger among the pavilions. The room is spacious and comfortable, and the decoration is elegant but not without modernity. Especially the super comfortable big bed, which is the largest bed in the hotel I stayed in. Lying on the bed, I almost didn't want to get up. From the window on the sixth floor, you can enjoy the beautiful view. In addition, the hotel's catering is also a highlight. I tried their buffet breakfast, which has a wide variety of food and tastes very delicious. Whether it was fresh fruit, steaming buns, or exquisite Western-style pastries, every bite was a feast for my taste buds. Although I didn't have the opportunity to have dinner at the hotel, I was impressed by the hotel's food.
In addition to the comfortable rooms and food, the hotel's leisure facilities are also excellent. I went to the gym and swimming pool, which are equipped with advanced equipment and comfortable environment. Especially the swimming pool, I must praise it highly, the water quality, temperature, environmental hygiene and safety are all excellent. Although I didn't have time to visit the surrounding attractions, on the way to and from, I found that there is a straight Chongming Avenue not far from the hotel. I even saw a national cycling team training on this road. This road looks very suitable for cycling, and I would like to try it on my next trip to experience the magnificent sunset and the beauty of the river. Overall, I am very satisfied with my stay at Hyatt Regency Chongming Jinmao, and I believe I will choose it as a destination next time I travel.

The Yangtze River Tunnel Bridge toll on the day of check-in (no more than 50 yuan), but it cannot be reimbursed if you check in the next day.
There is a swimming pool on the first floor, which is almost reserved, so comfortable. The children's playground is relatively young, and the outdoor one has been upgraded again. This needs to be improved. The kids have nothing to do except swimming. I had Pinyue for lunch, which tasted good. You can drive to Dingba to have a look, but there is nothing else to do.

The pink tent was also an unexpected surprise. The baby didn't want to come out and wanted to sleep in it.
I would like to praise the butler service of Kaiyue. Although the hotel did not provide a bed guard, they helped me get a child's bed very considerately. When I was not sure whether the baby could use it, I didn't feel troublesome and still brought one over!
Because the first day was too comfortable, I stayed for another day on the second day. The hotel actually upgraded it to the Little Yellow Duck Suite. My god, it was so cute. The child kept saying that he liked this hotel. We have also been recommending this place to friends around us.
Before leaving, the child was very reluctant. Let's invite friends to come and experience the service here next time.

The view outside the window was also quite good. Although the hotel breakfast did not have too many varieties, the taste was ok. The only small drawback was that there were not too many parking spaces. I heard that other group guests had reserved parking spaces. I could only park my car on the roadside of the hotel park later, but it was harmless.

The children's playground is not large, but the two children had a lot of fun. It's a pity that it has been drizzling outside, and the outdoor playground is also being renovated.

msg:I originally planned to spend a wonderful holiday in Chongming Island during the Qingming Festival, so I searched for local five-star hotels üè® and booked this one

I felt very disappointed when I got here. The price of about 950 is totally unworthy of the location and facilities at this price. The location is very remote, the hotel lobby is also very old-fashioned, the entrance is very small, and the staff also use very unprofessional registration equipment (laptops). There is nothing fun in the hotel. Except for a swimming pool to kill time, there is really nothing else to play. If it is in the city, it is at most 3.5-4‚≠êÔ∏è standard.

The taxi driver was complaining, saying that he didn't understand why he came here to play. He drove for three years and only came twice.

The next day I had to go to Dongping National Forest Park, and my mood improved. The scenery inside is very beautiful, there are Chongming cakes on the roadside, and there are many ways to play. I played for a total of three or four hours.

In summary, I will never come back to Chongming Jinmao Hyatt Hotel again! ‚ùåExpensive and a rip-off‚ùå

It is better to book a homestay near Dongping Forest Park, which only costs two or three hundred yuan, is cost-effective, and is convenient for eating, drinking and having fun.

We decided to take Nuomi to Chongming for a walk

üöó
We chose a weekday so the hotel was relatively quiet

The journey was also very smooth, compared to at least three or four hours during the Chinese New Year

This time it took less than 1 hour to reach Chenjia Town, and the toll was üí∞100 round trip

The housekeeper who received us was Amy. If you book through Ctrip, the hotel will also reimburse ¬•50 for the toll (but be sure to get the invoice at the highway toll gate)

üí≥
You can bring your pet to stay with a cleaning fee of üí∞500

There are no other hidden costs

You can also buy a pet room directly (there is a small courtyard on the first floor)

üè†
We stayed in a pet suite with a little French bulldog sign at the door

There are also many peeing French bulldog ornaments in the room, super cute

There is even a slide for dogs in the courtyard, full of detailsüõù

The living room and courtyard are each equipped with dog activity areas and food bowls

The only two disadvantages are that my family has mysophobia and refuses to eat from the public food bowl [laughing and crying R]

Maybe it‚Äôs because of the pet room The room facilities are relatively old and worn out (I stayed in a regular room in 2012 and it was newer and cleaner)

I would like to thank the housekeeper who helped me upgrade. I am very grateful, but when the occupancy rate is not high, the equipment room and the courtyard are full of garbage and leftover cigarette butts. I really don‚Äôt understand, because your large courtyard and The lobby is very clean and tidy everywhere. Forgive me for not agreeing that for a daily customer, the dust and melon seed shells in the room are a cleaning problem.
The number of housekeepers is the same, but there may be more than one. What I said before cannot be done later. If it were a two or three-star hotel, I would most likely relax the bottom line, but at what level do I position myself and what are the requirements for myself? Should I think about it? I hope my country and Shanghai will be good, so I will continue to support the hotel industry, support Ctrip, and try my best to consume, but I may still read more comments next time.

Compared with two years ago, the horse farm is very clean, but the lawn of the pet park has been dug up. I don't know if it is an upgrade or something. The yard is kept very tidy, and as doting parents, we also maintain it carefully (pick it up). Although the pickles are my intention, I am allowed to refuse. In the service industry, you need to put your heart into your heart. Customers will see whether you have your intentions or not.

When we checked in, the front desk did not proactively provide us with a pet gift package or provide us with the room card, nor did they proactively inform me that we could provide photos of our pets. We all have a good guide to the room card, and we all know the hotel well. It is really inappropriate to treat guests carelessly like this! ? After entering the room, there were no pet beds and utensils provided in the room. They were not delivered until we called at almost night. The lock on the bathroom unit in the room was also broken and the door wouldn't close. When we need. When introducing food and beverages in the hotel, the front desk pushed them back and forth and refused to give them. One time they said they would be behind the round table in the room, and another time they said they would call to get them. I called several times to get them, but in the end there was no paper introduction. Just give us the iPad ordering machine. Fireworks at night are still okay. These are not nearly as good as the service jobs in five-star hotels. This stay was disappointing. Totally inconsistent with the price. The pet rides are totally inconsistent. Won't come next time

The room is well soundproofed and the hotel is very pet-friendly. We met many families with dogs and many elderly people pushing wheelchairs. The language heard around breakfast is Shanghainese. The bed in the room was very comfortable. The mother-in-law at the company said that I could eat well and sleep well here, and asked me to book it for half a month next time. The only drawback is that the network is not very smooth and children will get stuck while playing games. There are toothbrushes, slippers, etc. for children. The hotel housekeeper will contact you in advance to arrange a room. The lady at the front desk was also patient and considerate. The swimming pool has a baby pool with a suitable water temperature, similar to a hot spring. Recommended for family outings.

He led me to the room and filled out a form about the dog's health. Let them pay more targeted attention to the little residents, and sent them a doghouse, a dog basin, and a dog gift bag.

Because it‚Äôs a rainy day and you want to go out and relax. , you can stay in the room, because there is a bathtub where you can take a bath and listen to music. The hotel is also quite large, with several lawns, a small animal paradise, and an equestrian field.

If you really want to go out, there is a wetland park or something right next to it, and it‚Äôs not too far to drive there. By the way, there is also a dog swimming pool, so you can play there again in the summer~

msg:I took my 10-month-old baby to stay in the hotel, which was upgraded to a parent-child room. He loved hiding in the small tent and crawling in and out. I contacted him in advance and arranged a crib, but the bed was really only a temporary place for the baby. It was too low for sleeping, and it was troublesome to pick him up, pat, and coax him in the middle of the night.

The baby was very happy to see many small animals. It was the first time in his life. There was also a children's playground where he could crawl around. There was no hair or dust on the ground, and the toys were quite clean. After all, the ten-month-old baby couldn't play with much else. Just crawl and play with ocean balls.

The hotel still has a certain sense of age, such as the floor in the corridor creaking. I think the software can still be rated high. The staff were very friendly along the way, and yes, Angel was also the receptionist. The housekeeper Amy is also responsive.

There were very few people checking in on Thursday, and the set menu I had in the cafe in the evening was quite large and delicious. I thought that the breakfast the next day would be discounted due to the lack of people, but in fact, it had all the things I should have, and I didn‚Äôt neglect it. The taste was beyond expectations. I like egg pancakes and fried dumplings. But when we went there, there were no nameplates for the dishes in the pastry area, so it was easy to not know what they were. However, they were all placed in the Chinese food area. I don‚Äôt know if they were missed or not put there all the time.

Finally, I would like to say that the outdoor cute pet park should be managed by a third party, and it is cleaner than I thought. With so many animals, it is inevitable that there will be some smell, but it is still acceptable. It is actually difficult to build this kind of cute pet park, and you want to please and interact. I also felt that it was pitiful that they were trapped in such a small place. Fortunately, most of the small animals are in good spirits. Except for a sika deer that looks very sick, the dog is also very active, the cat is clean and has no tear stains, a few ducks, and the big white goose are particularly white and plump when we went there. I happened to see the beautiful management lady helping the animals clean the boxes where they were staying, just to see if they would be too cold in the winter.

The 24-hour trip was pretty good. Before leaving, we went to the big lawn to see Angel basking in the sun. We will try to bring him to play next time when the baby can walk.

There is a swing rocking chair on the balcony, but it was too cold to sit there. The hotel breakfast is also OK, and I can fill up my stomach haha. Wait until the weather gets hotter and then come and stay in the hotel.

At the buffet breakfast, we saw a female guest using our dining plate and putting it on the sofa in the restaurant to feed eggs to her Bichon Frize. It was really unhygienic because not everyone likes it. Dogs, I hope the waiter will stop him when he sees them in the future, otherwise people around him will say that our dog owners are of low quality. It's best to upgrade the TV in the room. It's too small, maybe a 40-inch one? I couldn't see the subtitles at all when I was lying on the bed. Yesterday, my friend and I moved two chairs to watch it against the TV. Now, is the lawn outside being renovated? It‚Äôs all deserted. My friend said it was okay for him to come here before, but now it looks so deserted. There is no place or lawn to play in the dog hotel, but everything else is okay. The parrots are well kept, not afraid of people, and their feathers are also very colorful. The service attitude of the staff is very good and very caring. The water in the bathroom is huge and the bath is very comfortable. There is an air purifier in each room and there is no smell. I also hope that a bath bag can be provided in the future. The back and bottom of the balcony hanging chair need to be cleaned. I saw a lot of dead leaves and so on.

It's a bit far from Dongtan, about half an hour's drive. Dongtan is also beautiful in this season, but it's a pity that there are no birds.

I have also traveled during the long holiday before, and many hotels felt overwhelmed and had discounted services. However, Jinmao Hyatt is quite good. The hotel housekeeper Kitty came to contact me a few days in advance to remind relevant matters. After check-in, she paid close attention to it and solved any problems in time. It is really a rare good hotel during the holidays and is worth recommending!

msg:I stayed here for the second time and the experience was very bad!
We booked a garden view room and were initially assigned a room in Building 2. The view was good and we were quite satisfied. As a result, we returned to the hotel after having fun. At 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening, as soon as we entered the room, a pungent smell of oil smoke hit our face. It was so pungent that we couldn't stay in the room. The smell was even worse when we opened the windows and opened the door! ! I'm shocked why a five-star hotel allows guests to stay in this kind of room.
I immediately contacted the front desk, and they were obviously not surprised. They were not the first to complain about the smell in the room. The plan they were given was to send me an air purifier first. After thinking about it, I realized that it was useless, so I rejected it directly. Then the front desk told me that the hotel was fully booked and there was no twin room that I had booked. They told me that they would downgrade my room and that they could only give me a king-bed room. I said this was unreasonable and it was the hotel's problem, and then downgraded the room to us, and you had to refund the difference to me. The front desk changed his mind and said they would check again right away? ? ? After checking, they said there was a room with twin beds of the same level, and they immediately took us there to change. Anyway, it was very confusing, and I felt like I could get away with it. The service awareness was relatively poor, and I didn't express any apology. I have stayed in hotels so many times, and this time I felt really bad. Then I returned the room at 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning. There was a big forklift driving back and forth, which was so noisy. I was really convinced. I originally wanted to stay for two nights, but I just stayed for one day and checked out. Blacklisted, try the Sheraton next door next time.

Before departure, the hotel's butler took the initiative to add WeChat to answer questions in advance, and was able to reply in a timely manner during the stay, which is commendable.
There were even more surprises on the day of check-in. First, because we were afraid of congestion on tunnels and bridges, we drove out early to avoid peaks. Unexpectedly, the journey was smooth and we arrived at the hotel in an hour. Second, since we arrived too early, we wanted to store our luggage first and then go out for a walk. Unexpectedly, the hotel had already prepared the room. We checked in directly, and it felt like a two-night vacation turned into a three-night vacation. Third, as an ihg member, this Buddhist family stayed at the Hyatt. Unexpectedly, the hotel helped upgrade it to a 100+ square meter family suite. The children were very happy. I recommend the room in Building 4. It has a wide view and you can see the Shanghai Yangtze River Bridge. It is also good to walk through the corridor from the main building.
Although the room is not new, it is well maintained. The pancoat parent-child room is lively and cute, with sufficient supplies and comfortable linens. The cleaning lady is hard-working and enthusiastic, and she is very good at replenishing supplies and replacing linens. After playing outside for a day, I feel refreshed when I return to the room.
In terms of catering, the breakfast is quite satisfactory, with a little less variety of Western pastries. Dinner at Pinyue tastes great, but there are so many people that you can‚Äôt order more than a few dishes. Lanhai's mutton skewers are very good, and we also watched a volleyball game inside.
There were very few people in the swimming pool when we went there, and the water was warm enough. The children had a great time swimming. There is no special place for parent-child cycling next to the hotel, so the hotel bicycles are a bit useless. The racecourse is not very popular either.
With the late check-out and the small gifts received when leaving the hotel, the hotel's guest service team has truly implemented "the Peak-end rule".

As a holiday and pet-themed hotel, the hotel has a good environment and is an hour's drive from Shanghai. It is very suitable for parent-child and pet families to relax. recommend!
Finally, thanks to the two Hyatt housekeepers Effie and Amy for their attentive service, making this vacation trip beyond expectations.

The only shortcoming is the breakfast. It is understandable that there are many people during the National Day, but there are too few varieties (1. There are too few Western-style meals, except for bread, and no cakes; 2. Is there any Chongming specialty? Chinese pastries do not have the basics of Chongming cakes. 3. The yogurt is Mengniu bought in the supermarket. There is no sugar-free autonomy that a five-star hotel should have.) Coffee ‚òïÔ∏è needs to wait for more than ten minutes. It is recommended to add a coffee machine during the holidays. I still hope that the hotel can improve it. After all, it must be in line with Kaifa. Love this brand
image.
Last but not least, since the pet park charges a fee, the small animals should be well-raised. The current condition is not good and it seems that they don't have enough to eat. The hotel should pay more attention to these small animals raised in captivity.

msg:Many people say not to go to Chongming during the National Day holiday! It‚Äôs too congested! I don't believe it. It's very smooth coming and going. The red traffic just means there is heavy traffic. We will leave on the 3rd and return to Shanghai on the 5th. It only takes 2 hours one way to solve the problem. When traveling with two children, a family hotel is a must. As a Hyatt member, Hyatt Chongming Jinmao is definitely my first choice because of its stable quality! The little housekeeper Effie is very considerate and responsive to all requests, which is very important for families traveling with children!

The hotel facilities are quite satisfactory, and the welcome birds and golden retrievers are very pleasant; the horses at the racecourse and the sheep encountered during the walk are relaxing; the hotel is not far from the dike dam, and fishing for small crabs is very interesting. During my stay, I encountered a door lock failure and was unable to enter the door. After calling for feedback, it was properly handled. During the long holidays, the passenger flow is relatively large, and the overall experience is quite comfortable and relaxing.

When booking a room, although the three rooms have different room types, the hotel still arranges them as close as possible to facilitate walking around.
There are also many activities in the hotel, which can be catered for both children and adults. The little bird is so happy.
In addition, the butler also added WeChat immediately, and the reply was very timely and very nice. Thank you to the butler Effie for bringing us a great experience.

msg:Facilities: Hardware cannot keep up with the brand. Staying during the National Day period, you can feel that the overall hotel is overloaded and the service manpower is tight. Even though the WLAN showed that it was connected that night, the network was still unavailable. Furthermore, there is almost no signal in the room. If the 5G card is stuck in the room, the signal is only 2G. The USB interface is intermittently intermittent, which is very unfriendly to charging mobile phones. I originally planned to work on the mobile phone and reply to emails after the children fall asleep, but there is nothing to do at night. The whole plan was disrupted by interference. I contacted the hotel housekeeper and reported that the network engineering depar**ent had been negligent in management and maintenance, but the response I received was that they were constantly trying to educate the guests and were not enthusiastic about solving the problem. The reply was almost the next day, which was even more inefficient. If you don‚Äôt want to go overboard during your vacation, then go during the off-season.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chongming. The first time was five years ago.
When I came here for the first time, I knew this was a pet-friendly hotel, but since I didn't have any furry children yet, I didn't know much about it. But now that I have a dog, I don‚Äôt hesitate to choose Hyatt Chongming when traveling.
The hotel's service is as considerate as ever, with all kinds of pet supplies prepared, and the gift packs are also for dogs. Sure enough, furry children are given priority.
The hotel has an animal park, equestrian experience, and KTV. These are not common in most five-star hotels in Shanghai, and the parent-child programs are also thoughtful. My son carried out the purpose of staying in a hotel to the end, experienced it one by one, and had a lot of fun. But maybe due to various reasons, I feel that the animals are not healthy, which is a bit sad. I can only say that these three years have not been easy...
The hotel has a quiet environment. The building courtyard has a Chinese style of simplicity, with lush green plants. It is far away from the busy area. It is a place where you can always take your children and dogs to relax. I hope you will have a new experience next time you come.

There were not many people and the service was very good. I explained patiently. Living in Building 2, the balcony faces the racecourse, with a wide view and pleasant scenery. The sheets were accidentally stained by a child and were changed promptly. The buffet was quite rich the next morning and I was very full. Although it was raining outside, I could play in the children's playground and swimming pool for a long time.

msg:Take the Shen-Chong Line to Chenjia Town Hub Station. When you get off the bus, there is a queue of metered taxis waiting for customers. Very convenient to the hotel.
Jinmao Hyatt Regency Hotel is green and environmentally friendly. The hotel rooms are spacious and bright. Each room has a balcony with clothes racks and hanging chairs.
Food, drinks and entertainment are all included in the booked package!
We arrived at the hotel at 11:30 and it was already ready for check-in. The first run of the minibar in the room is free.
The package includes Yingdong Village tickets and free bicycles for two people for one hour. Tickets for the Shangshi Fruit and Vegetable Picking Garden have been sold out. Because it is far away, forget it if you don‚Äôt have any. Just tell the waiter that you can ride a bicycle instead without a time limit.
The weather is cool, so I went to Yingdong Village by bicycle at noon, and there was a farmhouse on the small road diagonally opposite the hotel. After lunch, the white-cut chicken is a local specialty, fresh and delicious, and the hairy crab rice cake tastes good too.
Chongming Island is very suitable for cycling. The roads are lined with green trees and all kinds of unknown flowers are blooming. Yingdong Village is not far away, only half an hour away.
There is a fishing gear museum and electric boat projects in the East Lake Scenic Area. The cockfighting and sheep fighting performances are at 14:00 and 15:00. I went late and didn't see them. The scenic spot is not big, there are few tourists, the lake is shining, and the scenery is quite quiet and beautiful.
Around 5:00 pm, we returned to the hotel to return the bike. Take a break in the hotel lobby. There are various game machines next to the lobby. The package includes 10 game coins, which are all used on the claw machine to catch a cute plush duckü¶Ü.

After dinner, take a walk in the hotel. There are billiards, darts, table tennis, table football, and music rooms on the ground floor. Because it's not a weekend, there are very few people, so you can have a lot of fun.
You can sleep late the next day and go to the cafe on the second floor before 9 o'clock for a buffet breakfast. Chinese noodles, pancakes, egg rolls, porridge, etc., Western bread, coffee, milk, juice, salad. Fruits include watermelon, cantaloupe, melon, apple, pear, etc., which should be quite complete.
At 10:30, I went to the swimming pool on the first floor of Building 5. The swimming pool is clean, the water temperature is suitable, and the constant temperature is 28 degrees. I am the only one in the entire swimming pool, and I can do whatever I want, such as supine, prone, breaststroke, or freestyle.
Checked out at noon, and ordered two cups of coffee in the cafe, included in the package.
I called an online car-hailing car back to the Chenjia Town bus hub station. On the way back, I visited the Chenjia Town Farmer‚Äôs Market and bought two bundles of Chongming‚Äôs special sweet miliflower, pumpkin and Chongming cake.
Take the Shenchong line back to the urban area, and complete the two-day and one-night free travel of Chongming Island!

msg:For my mother's 70th birthday, I wanted to go to Chongming Island, so I studied the reviews and booked Jinmao Hyatt. The family of five stayed for one night, and the experience of the stay was not very satisfactory.
1. The design of the twin room is unreasonable. The toilet takes up a lot of space in the room. As a result, the two beds in the twin room are too close together. The bed frame is bigger than the mattress. It is easy to be ignored visually. As a result, my mother I tripped over the bed frame while walking, accidentally fell down, and had multiple skin scratches, but fortunately no bones were injured
2. Many facilities are aging. The bulbs of the two bedside lamps in our room are broken and flickering. The reading light in my parents' room is also broken.
3. There are no paper towels in the room, only in the toilet, so you have to go to the toilet frequently when you need to use paper towels
4. The selection of toiletries is a bit poor, and it doesn't match the star rating of the hotel.
It is worth mentioning that the service attitude of the hotel staff is still very good, and the little housekeeper promised to give feedback and improve after knowing our check-in experience.

Every staff member would greet you proactively. During our stay, we ate at the Chinese restaurant. We would like to give a special compliment to our service Ms. Liu Houyan, greeted us with a full smile, served us with a full smile, and was able to think of details that we did not pay attention to, such as the child did not want to be a child seat, she saw that the child was too short to sit comfortably, and offered to help us Add a cushion, and put the child on the seat. The service and character are reflected in the details. I am very grateful to her. At the same time, the food in the Chinese restaurant is also delicious. Food + service = 100 points

Maybe it was just a little slippery on the floor. Have fun with other dogs, prefer Hyatt because it's great to bring pets

The service is very good and the attitude is very good.

The breakfast is very good, there is also decaf coffee, the ice cream in the lobby is also good, the hotel is very big and has everything

Bike to Dongtan Park on Saturday, sleep in on Sunday, and go home in the afternoon, a perfect weekend! Thank you Hyatt, especially thanks to the support and help of Amy, the little housekeeper, we will come againü•∞

The hotel room is clean, there are two swimming pools, large and small, as well as foosball, table tennis, billiards and darts for children. Staying in the hotel will not feel boring. The most surprising thing for the children is that there are bunk beds in the room, and there is a small tent to hide in and read books, which is a lot of fun. We also rented the hotel's tandem bicycles for an hour ride, and the children couldn't think about it. Looking forward to having the opportunity to go again in the future.

There were no pet supplies or mats in the room, and no one asked. There was no room directions, hotel facilities, or breakfast time and location. The so-called housekeeper added WeChat and never appeared. The most interesting thing is that after leaving the store, she called me at 4pm to ask how my stay was. I said it was very average and she directly asked me if she could stop commenting and deliver some souvenirs to me... What were you doing while I was in the store? Is it too much to put the cart before the horse? I'm really sorry for not giving this bad review to this service.

Facilities: It's just like the Hyatt style. The Chinese-style corridor on the second floor is quite nice, but the room facilities are very old. The three-separated sliding door in the bathroom is broken and cannot be closed.
Health: Very clean
Environment: It's quite big. The environment is pretty good. The staff is very sp****. It's back to the previous question. I have no idea what's inside.

msg:Very disappointed, it really has a better reputation than Hyatt. The hotel contacted us one day in advance to inquire about the arrival time and the gender of the baby. In order to have two rooms on the same floor, they upgraded one of them to a suite. It felt very thoughtful. Who knew that one of the rooms would be bigger than the other after arrival. First, the hotel is undergoing major renovations. Many places are surrounded by scaffolding and are unsightly. The smell is very strong. We were not informed of this when booking the room. On the way to the room, we had to walk through a corridor with a strong paint smell. It was very unpleasant to be forced to breathe paint. I was angry, and there was a sewer smell throughout the fourth floor of Building 5. Second, the hotel gave me a pink room for some unknown reason after knowing that the baby was a boy. After the hotel reacted, they said they would rearrange the existing room. Half an hour after unpacking their luggage and leaving the room, they said they would change to another room. Afterwards, they gave me two plates of fruit to make up for it. . Third, there were holes in the sheets, the guest room was rough and careless, the pajamas were randomly rolled into balls and thrown in the suitcase, the bathrobe dropped on the floor was picked up and folded randomly and then thrown back into the closet. The details were poor and the overall feeling was untidy. Fourth, on the first night, when the baby fell asleep immediately and wanted to turn off the lights, he found that the porch could not be closed. After informing the customer service, an electrician was sent. In the end, it took 20 minutes to say that the circuit board was aging. It can be seen that this is not the first time that a similar situation has occurred. This happened once, making guests feel that the inspection and maintenance of hotel equipment was not in place. It is really unreasonable for a hotel of this level to have so many problems. It is difficult to deny the existence of top-down negligence and management problems. pity!

There are two large ramps from the basement garage to the hotel door (makeshift, no special lighting near the basement garage) and one of us nearly fell. When entering and exiting the hotel for the second time, I discussed with the doorman whether I could park in the parking space at the entrance of the hotel, and the answer was that I could not park because it was reserved for the employees. Later I learned that any vehicle can be parked in the parking space in front of the hotel! Why would the doorman do this! We are not asking for special trea**ent for the elderly, but we cannot discriminate either! We went in and out of the hotel with big and small luggage, and none of the staff offered help, even a polite word: Do you want to help? Is this the service of a five-star hotel? This is the first time I have given a bad review to a hotel after so many years of traveling.

Sitting on it with the children and shaking gently with the breeze, it is very pleasant to enjoy the snack time! The disadvantage is that there are mosquitoes easily. The next morning, my child and I were bitten twice. There are electric mosquito coils in the room, but the mosquitoes are only found during sleep, and they cannot be caught at night! The indoor pool is spacious and comfortable, not fancy, but clean and warm enough for kids to discharge. Cute Pet Paradise is an outsourced project, and there is an extra charge, 98 yuan for two big ones and one small one, including a basket of carrotsü•ï, feed the rabbits, feed the sheep, the children are happy. I brought my own children‚Äôs bicycles, plus the free 1-hour cycling activity for adults in the package is enough. Riding next to the hotel, there are no other cycling lanes that are very suitable for children. There are still quite a lot of large trucks and trucks, so half an hour is enough. it's over. The hotel seemed to have contracted the event that day, and there were quite a few people staying there, but the service was still in place and the sanitation management was good. After returning from staying at the hotel this time, the housekeeper Amy added WeChat to ask about the satisfaction of the accommodation and whether there is any room for improvement. At the same time, she explained that she can contact in advance to arrange a room for the next stay. She is proactive and communicates well. Overall, I am satisfied with this trip to Hyatt, and recommend it as a parent-child hotel suitable for children!

Because Jinmao stayed in Lujiazui last month and felt very good, I chose Hyatt Regency Jinmao in Chongming again this time. It was already late and the surrounding area of the hotel was very quiet. After booking, the service butler added me on WeChat and asked about my preferences. It was very warm! When I arrived, I was given a pleasant surprise. I was upgraded to a 160-square-meter executive suite with a balcony for free. I walked along the path-like corridor to the room. It has a noble and elegant decoration style, a wide sense of space, and a humanized design. Makes me happy after a day of running around! The hardness of the mattress is very relaxing and decompressing. In the morning, I heard the birdsong in the distance. I opened the balcony and had a panoramic view of the green bamboo forest. When I came to the restaurant when the meal was about to close at about 10 o'clock, the chef cooked a steaming bowl The small face, against the drizzle outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, very pleasant travel time! Recommended! On the way back, you can also enjoy the scenery of the Yangtze River Bridge! Awesome üéâ

The hotel is suitable for parents and children. There are also many campsites and coffee shops around for check-in. The children had a great time.
The only regret is that there are too many people on May 1st, and it is understandable that they can't keep up in various aspects. In addition, the level of dishes in the Chinese restaurant has dropped slightly, which is a bit disappointing.
This itinerary was coordinated by the little housekeeper, I got a lot of help, and the response was very timely. Come again next time.

msg:This time, two rooms were booked for a total of 10 nights. The unhappy experience of staying in the room has been written in the previous order, so I will write down the experience of staying in this order.
Service: basically all the needs are met, the aunt cleans the room, the restaurant packs food, etc.
Administrative courtesy: The Regency Club has one more administrative courtesy than the basic room, that is, you can have snacks, fruit, and coffee soft drinks from 17:30 to 18:30. Dessert cake tastes bad, even the cakes bought with money taste very average, not recommended.
Room facilities: very old, it can be seen that the age is very long, and there is no washlet. There is no need to swipe the room card to take the elevator, and it is dangerous for anyone to go upstairs.
Restaurant: I ate two meals at the Chinese restaurant Pinyue. The set meal costs more than 800 and the price is 1000. The environment is good and the price is expensive. Some dishes are acceptable and some are not.
In addition, I had a meal at the 799 Lanhai restaurant. The lack of staff on holidays, no one to clean up and no one to order. The two restaurants share the same kitchen. There is a Sanxian soup that is sold at 158 in Pinyue, and it is sold in Lanhai. Selling 128, incredible.
We also went out to eat. Uncle Gu was nice and clean, but the Hu-style local dishes were too dirty.
Baby Paradise: Toys are rarely a bit old, you can only play with ocean balls, free of charge.
Zoo: There is a fee, 100 yuan, but the children are very happy, and it is the only fun place in the hotel
Bicycles: Some bikes are not very good and difficult to ride, 100 yuan for two hours
Garden: The garden is very small, there is no place to play, the basketball court is the construction site
Generally speaking: when I came to Chongming for the first time, the traffic was very difficult. Thousands of troops crossed the single-plank bridge, but there were not many people in Chongming. When I came here, I was stuck for 7 hours. I thought about taking a boat when I went back, but the ferry was cancelled. I finally went back at 7:00 in the morning and arrived home at 9:30. It was too hard. Moreover, if there are less than 6 business seats in Chongming, you need to book a car one day in advance. We always take two cars when we go out. Based on this experience, I will not go to Chongming again in the future. I can consider Sheshan, which is very convenient with the subway.

Ms. Angel at the front desk has a kind attitude and has been helping us take our luggage to the room after checking in. As soon as we checked in, the aunt from the housekeeping depar**ent sent a dog kennel. The little housekeeper, Amy, also cared about customers after leaving the store. Next time I take my dog to Chongming, I will choose it again this hotel
Overall, the hotel service is excellent and dog-friendly

Knowing that our children want to join the bed but it‚Äôs inconvenient, they arranged for us for free. There are not many dinner dishes in the Western-style cafe, but the steak and pasta are delicious. There are also Chinese meals. The Chongming braised lamb has been well received by my father. The buffet breakfast is also here. The waiter in the pet-friendly area even let us try printing coffee, which is quite Surprised, the next day I also printed the small balls and Xiaoyu haha~ The room card is provided according to the pet species and does not need to be recycled for pets. The hotel comes with a lot of entertainment. When the baby grows up, he doesn't go to the children's playground. He just loves horse riding, and has a good time at the hotel horse farm. Overall, I am quite satisfied. I want to bring my parents to stay again next time.

msg:After reading a lot of bad reviews on the Internet, I hesitated for a long time between the B&B and the hotel. Based on the previous pitfalls of the B&B (poor breakfast, no meals, no entertainment, no service, it‚Äôs like living in a model room, except that the room is softly decorated and you can check in and take pictures. Nothing else) plus the problem of eating in Chongming, I finally chose Hyatt. Although the room is not newly renovated, it is clean everywhere, and the towels and sheets are also very clean, so there is no worry at all. The breakfast is a rich buffet breakfast as always. There are coffee, drinks, all kinds of meat and vegetables, bread, yogurt and so on. This is completely incomparable to the B&B, and the price is not as expensive as the B&B. All famous hotels in Chongming have to 1-2 thousand, the credit-to-price ratio is too low compared to Hyatt. In short, this stay is quite satisfactory overall. Will come again next time. In addition, thanks to the housekeeper Amy, WeChat has been contacting the service in place, thank you.

msg:This is the first time I bring children to stay in a hotel. Before checking in, I was worried that there would be some lack of this or that, so I called the hotel the day before to confirm children's supplies and so on. The housekeeper, Carol, was very careful. Before the trip, she confirmed the number of people traveling and the situation of the children, and helped arrange the children's bath and toiletries, small slippers and bathrobes, and a few small dolls in the room. The children fell in love with it immediately after seeing it, and they felt no discomfort at all, and immediately regarded the hotel as their own home. Not only that, but in order for the children to play on the slide even in rainy days, Carol specially arranged to send one over. This time, the children had a great time playing. In the evening, the child walked unsteadily and accidentally fell down and bumped his lip. The hotel immediately sent ice cubes to stop the bleeding and reduce the swelling. Not long after, they called to confirm the recovery status. They were very concerned. The hotel is not only equipped with complete entertainment facilities, but also has many places suitable for children to play, such as the Shar Pei House, children's indoor entertainment room, and coin-operated game machines in the lobby. We spent almost a whole day in the hotel. When it was time to check out, the children kept clamoring to continue staying in the hotel. Thanks to the caring care of the housekeeper, Carol, we had a great experience. It seems that the standard for children‚Äôs first stay in a hotel is a bit high, and the mother‚Äôs future choices will be ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù, haha. In short, this is definitely an excellent experience of taking a baby to a hotel. One day is not enough, and next time you will stay for at least two days.

Transportation: Shanghai can only go to Chongming by car. It is not far from the Yangtze River Bridge to the hotel. It is more convenient to park in the underground garage.
Environment: There are small parrots welcoming guests when entering the hotel. The environment is good, and the small gardens between the buildings are also easy to stroll around. The Pet Paradise has a large lawn, but it is not very open because it is full of saplings.
Facilities: Children's Paradise is a bit small in terms of parent-child parks. The 2-year-old daughter had a great time playing, but the 4-year-old son seemed not interested enough. The Shar-Pei House has a lot of animals, big and small. It is a joy to feed rabbits and piglets.
Service: I received a phone call from the hotel one day earlier to inquire about check-in matters. The housekeeper Amy added WeChat in advance, and I can answer any needs during the stay at any time. After arriving at the hotel, I upgraded to a suite. The minibar in the room is quite complete. The balcony is very large, and it is very comfortable to bask in the sun.
The breakfast at the hotel is okay, without dragging the tail, fried dumplings, omelets, and fried potatoes are impressive.

I originally wanted to come during the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, but I had to give up because of the mask. Now finally have a chance. We booked a pet king bed room and a garden view twin room in total. Before check-in, we added the WeChat of the hotel's little butler. The warm service of the little butler accompanied the whole trip. On the day of check-in, the beautiful young lady at the front desk warmly reminded us that the service was considerate, and she was pleasantly surprised to inform us that the little housekeeper had upgraded the pet room to a suite. I experienced the service of the suite. There is a special area for pets in the room, with a dog mat, a large stainless steel food bowl, and next to it are the wonderful fresh bag sent by the hotel, a teething stick and a poop bag. If you have a big dog at home, it is very good. Suitable, there are pet rooms and slides in the outside yard. Our dog is too small, and was tricked by my sister to slide twice, so scared that I dare not go out. , Friends of all ages who like horse riding can also go to the equestrian club to experience it. There are many varieties of breakfast buffet, and picky mothers are satisfied. In short, this short two-day tour left good memories. It is a good choice to add the little butler of Hyatt Hotel before check-in, there will be surprises waiting for you üëçü§©üòÄ

Facilities: On the first day, I felt that the whole room was very big and spacious. I was quite satisfied with it, but there were still some small flaws: the water in the shower was small and not as big as the water at home! You can only take a shower with the üöø shower head, and it won't get wet if you put it on the shelf! The wiring of the bedside lamp should be installed backwards. Press the left button to light up the right side, and press the right button to light up the left side! The bed is very big, with two single beds put together, it is estimated to be more than 2 meters tall.
Hygiene: The room is generally clean. There is a bathtub but no disposable bath bags are provided (the hotel does not sell them either, so those who like to take a bath should bring their own). There are two bathrooms in total and they are quite user-friendly!
Environment: Because of the masks, there are almost no guests in the entire hotel. It is very quiet and the hotel smells good. It is best to get a hotel map. It is a bit big. If you live in Building 4, it is a bit far to walk to the lobby or dining place!
There is a Shar Pei dog park, which is chargeable. There are some small animals and other things in it. It is okay for children to play, but it is not interesting to bring dogs in.
There is also a horse farm, which is very big, but there is no one there. Next to the racecourse is the pet park, which is quite big, but there are no people or dogs, and it is full of trees. It is a bit desolate and a bit in the way!
Eating: There is only one decent Chinese restaurant open (Pinyue). The price is relatively expensive, and the environment is not bad. The average cost per person is estimated to be 300, which is enough for a meal! (Dogs are not allowed) The barbecue at the farmhouse next door was not open either, so we went out to eat at the farmhouse the next day for 100 RMB per person.
There was no afternoon tea either, I was told by the pastry chefüêë, so I had very little to eat, so I ended up ordering pasta 108 and Coke 28! The price is also a bit scary, and the taste is not worth 108 (dogs allowed). I stayed for 2 days. The drinks in the room are only provided for one day. Are they not replenished? It‚Äôs said to be related to masks! ? I stayed in a hotel that cost 500 a night for 5 nights and received drinks and water every day!
After staying for 2 days, no one came to clean the room. It was also because of the masks. In the end, the trash can could not be filled! No one came to change or bring new towels!
After booking this hotel, I found that the price was only over 1,000. I booked more than 1,400 and lost 800ü•≤

Service: The lady at the front desk was very gentle and provided a complimentary breakfast (but it was not much and the taste was average). One thing worth mentioning is that when we met the hotel maintenance staff while taking the elevator, they consciously walked out of the elevator when they saw us taking the elevator. Let us take the first ride while they wait for one! This is quite unexpected and deserves a thumbs upüëçüèª
Overall: It's pretty good. There are few things to do, and it's okay to relax. If the price is 1,000 per night, I will come again next time. Over 1,400 feels like the price/performance ratio is a bit low!

The hotel staff are very friendly to dogs and sent pet bowls and nests. It was windy outside yesterday, and it was very pleasant to drink afternoon tea and eat freshly fried sweet potato fries in the sunny cafe in the afternoon. The animals in the pet park in the hotel are very cute. My daughter went there twice and was very happy.

I have to say that this hotel is really suitable for babies to play!
Let‚Äôs talk about the configuration firstü•≥
The rooms all have small balconies and swings, which the baby likes very much. The bed in the king bed room is so big that it can roll over! A family of three is not crowded at all üòé
Indoor amu*****t park (smaller, suitable for preschool babies), swimming pool, outdoor amu*****t park, feeding small animals, basically everything babies like to play! There are so many small animals, babies can play for a long time!
Suggestions üëèüèª
The hotel can prepare disposable bath bags. Babies need to take a bath in a bathtub. Bath bags are cleaner and more hygienic.
Service üìû
The day before check-in, there will be a little housekeeper on WeChat, so I can contact you at any time if you need anything, which is still very good.
meals üçó
The breakfast in the hotel is relatively rich, and there is something that babies can eat.
Overall a happy trip!

Due to the relaxation of the epidemic, I decisively gave up all kinds of B&Bs and chose the established five-star Jinmao Hyatt. Except for some minor problems such as outdated facilities, everything was wonderful. During the epidemic, there are actually executive afternoon tea and light dinner. Although there are not many things, the quality is good and there is wine (there are some barbs on the sink and wooden furniture that pricked my husband's hand. The five-star hotel does not even have a smart toilet, and the nap is next door) I was woken up by the sound of decoration, and the breakfast was quite satisfactory.) Special mention to the little housekeeper Sasa, who gave me a comfortable garden view room from the beginning. Although the guest suite is not open, the sun is warm and the big swing is a favorite of children. In addition to solving all the above problems, they also warmly gave the baby a fruit plate to eat, and took the initiative to help with late check-out. The next day, the baby played football all morning, and was able to take a bath and eat comfortably. Taking a nap in the car, thanks for the hospitality, my body is cold and my heart is warm!

msg:First of all, I would like to thank the housekeeper Kitty for her thoughtful greeting and service. From the whole process of travel, room arrangement, check-in process, and check-out, I have the intimacy of being a guest at a friend's house. We have never met before, and feel at home.
Regarding the room, the layout of the twin beds is a bit compact, but the swing on the balcony is really a highlight. Whether it is the evening of the sunset or the first ray of sunshine in the morning, sitting on the swing, looking at the yellow and green courtyard, drinking a cup of tea, breathing the fresh air of Chongming, is extraordinarily comfortable. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the bathtub is very comfortable, but you need to bring your own bath salt or bath ball.
Regarding the pool, the 15 x 25 (should be) courtyard view indoor pool is very comfortable and the warm water is clear enough. If you are not swimming with your family, put on shoe covers at the door, and you can take a nap on the sofa by the window. The fly in the oin**ent is that bath towels are only provided in the locker. The swimming pool is relatively large.
Regarding the restaurant, there are not many comments on the buffet breakfast, and we are full. Pinyue used dinner, the dishes and service were very good. The mutton is really as described in Dianping. It has no smell at all and is very delicious. Chongming Cake does not stick to the teeth, and tastes sweet and delicious. Although there is a little time to wait for the food, drinking tea also increases my appetite. The waiter poured the tea in a timely manner. The hot tea was replaced in time before the winter tea was cold. He was very attentive.
It was a very good staying experience. When I meet Chongming next time, I will choose this place again.

msg:The trip originally scheduled for Chris**as was canceled due to the epidemic. Since the children had been looking forward to this trip for a long time, they quickly booked it again. I checked the weather forecast on the night of 1-6 and saw that there were still rooms available for the weekend, so I placed an urgent order. That night I received a call from the hotel housekeeper KITTY. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised, because I was in a hurry and didn‚Äôt think much about it. But it felt very considerate when the hotel came to greet us in advance and asked us carefully what we needed to prepare. On the day of check-in, I arrived at the hotel early. Thanks to KITTY's advance arrangements, I went through the check-in procedure smoothly and prepared toiletries for the children. The hotel environment is very good, clean and tidy. Although the occupancy rate may not have fully recovered yet, it can clearly feel that it is about to recover. As the back garden of Shanghainese, Chongming should be a good choice.
Let‚Äôs talk about eating, drinking and having fun: The tickets to Yingdong Village provided with the package can go around and cleanse your lungs ü§≠The Little Shar Pei Home is a paradise for children. With the coffee included in the hotel package, you can bask in the sun and take care of your children. Very worry-free üòÇ The hotel breakfast is quite satisfactory and has everything you need. The temperature of the heated swimming pool in the hotel was okay. We went there in the afternoon and it was reserved. We didn‚Äôt use the hotel for dinner this time because we wanted to try some farmhouses nearby. Later we found that several of them were closed. The last one we went to was the "Hu Style ***", which tasted very good. It‚Äôs good, the food is large, and fireworks can be set off. There won‚Äôt be much advertising here. Everyone can experience it for themselvesüëçYou can meet all kinds of cute pets at any time in the hotel, which is a very interesting experienceüê∂
Finally, I would like to thank KITTY. For someone like me who is afraid of social problems, someone is very considerate for you and takes the initiative to ask if you have any needs every day. It is really considerate. üëç This play experience is five stars. I will talk about it in the future. ü§≠

There are many farmhouses around the hotel. It is also a good choice to eat at the farmhouse if you don‚Äôt mind the environment~
There are happy hours in the guest house at night, snacks, cakes, beer, soft drinks~~ There are not many varieties, but it is enough to chat and eat~

The hotel has a cute pet park, a horse farm, a swimming pool, and an entertainment room, which is suitable for parent-child play. The hotel has a rich breakfast, and in the evening, you can eat all-you-can-eat hairy crabs and delicious seafood barbecue. The surrounding picking gardens and Dongtan Wetland Park are very convenient.

There are a variety of simple meals to choose from, even the dog's meals are hot. During my stay, Wei Huanhuan, the little housekeeper, impressed me a lot. He responded promptly to any questions, and took the initiative to ask for suggestions and feedback when he left the store. The only shortcoming in terms of facilities is that the Shar Pei dog park is being repaired and has not been opened. Next time I come to Chongming, I will choose Hyatt to play.

msg:On Ctrip, I saw that the Hyatt Regency Chongming Jinmao Hotel had an accommodation package, and I immediately snapped it up and made an appoin**ent. The first time I came to the large-scale five-star hotel resort on Chongming Island, I was amazed at once. The Jinmao Hyatt Regency located in the natural environment is a designer brand hotel. The buildings are of antique Chinese style, and different room types give different needs. Whether it is a business trip, a family parent-child activity, or a person who loves pets, it can be used as a holiday destination.

It is particularly worth mentioning that Hyatt Regency Chongming is equipped with a special butler service, which was communicated the day before check-in. After arriving, because we waited for a long time, it took the initiative to help us upgrade the room type, and also provided 24-hour inquiry service. Feel right at home.

We had dinner at Pinyue Chinese Restaurant. The antique double moon arch at the entrance is quaint. This restaurant specializes in Shanghai local flavors and Chongming specialties. Seats in the hall must be reserved in advance, otherwise it will be difficult to get a seat if you go directly. The box is luxurious, the dishes are exquisite and the service attitude is very good.

Check-in experience was great. Five star rating.

The variety of breakfast is very rich, soups and water are very popular in my heart, and there are toppings of this gang, yah, fried noodles are also delicious~ There are also many choices of porridge, which health care people need.
The service of the hotel is also very considerate. Before we arrived at the store, we were contacted by the housekeeper. We could contact someone if we had any questions during our stay. This time we left the store with baby bath towels, which were specially delivered by courier.

Because the dog at home is 15 years old, it is rare to have a five-star hotel where pets can live. Although the facilities (such as furniture) can be seen to be some years old, the service is still relatively OK. I didn't expect the breakfast business to be so good on a weekday Tuesday morning. It can be seen that the popularity of the hotel is really high. (The arrangement of the humidifier in the room is very considerate)

At the same time, many of the hotel's facilities highlight parent-child elements. In addition to the regular configurations such as parent-child suites and indoor heated swimming pools, the cute pet paradise and equestrian club are unique. Parrots and starlings can be seen everywhere in the lobby, which arouses the strong interest of parents and children. The queen room has a large use area and ample space for activities. The wet and dry separate bathroom, in addition to the shower, also has a bathtub that can take a bath. In the spacious balcony, a swing hammock is placed, which is very relaxing and comfortable. The breakfast provided by the coffee shop is rich in variety and sufficient in preparation, with Chinese characteristics.

msg:Aiming at the Jinmao Hyatt brand, I thought I should have a good stay experience, but the result was rather disappointing.
1. Hygiene, on the first day of check-in, I saw a huge dead cricket in the elevator hall on the 5th floor of Building 6. Until I checked out and left the hotel on the third day, the cricket was still lying there peacefully. There is a layer of plastic wrap outside the buttons in the elevator. It must be because there are many people touching it during the epidemic. It is convenient to replace the plastic wrap in time to prevent the possibility of cross-infection. However, the plastic wrap has been pressed to a hole and has not been replaced. Zhang has been using the plastic wrap for how long, I really don't know what the plastic wrap outside the button is used for? Is it to hide the dirt or to meet the regulations? I stayed for two days in a row. The next morning, I found that the pillowcase was a little stained. I thought that the room cleaning should have changed the pillowcase, but I didn't change it at all at night!
2. Facilities, the night light in the guest room except the one on the bedside table can be turned on, the other night lights are useless and do not light at all, the TV set-top box has been repaired many times, but it is still good and sometimes bad. Part of the exterior walls and decorative pieces have been dilapidated and dilapidated.
3. For fitness and entertainment, it is usually after 20:00 when you return to the hotel after dinner in the evening. If you want to go to the gym at that time and your child wants to go to the game room, you can only say sorry. The fitness and entertainment facilities end at 8:00 p.m. I thought I was in a nursing home.

The butler helped arrange a connecting room and upgraded it Got a suite with a living room, which is very suitable for a large family. The hotel is actually a few years old, and the decoration cannot be carefully looked at. The room on the first floor is really humid. The dehumidifier fills up a large box of water in half a day. The overall cleaning is OK, the room is fairly clean, and the drinks in the small refrigerator are free. The breakfast stall is not big, but basically everything you want to eat, the service is still ok, especially the butler responds very quickly and basically responds to your needs. The most distinctive pet hotel has small animals everywhere, and the family likes it very much.

The epidemic just turned and I wanted to find a place to relax and take a vacation.

Jin Mao Hyatt has been brushed many times and decided to experience it.
48h nucleic acid certificate and antigen test are provided at check-in, and the dog should bring the dog certificate and immunization certificate.
There were no dog kennels and bowls at the beginning. After calling the concierge, they brought them and brought small snacks.


The staff in the hotel have a good attitude towards dogs, there is a special area for eating, and there is a large dog park.
A small suggestion is that there are currently no supplementary bags on the roadside~

Mid-week activities are relatively light, but clean. It is very convenient to go to the nearby farmhouse and Dongtan Wetland!

There was no room, and it was not weekend. In the epidemic environment, I took my child to feed. Although the concierge gave me a room upgrade under my anger, it is really not recommended to spend money to buy a crime. I feel that this is the same policy if I go to other places.

The child wanted to take a nap, said hello in advance, and gave the room in advance (usually check in at 3 o'clock) and then check out later (usually check out at 12 o'clock)
A lot of care is really a pleasure. Although the children's park is not open, the cute pet park is open. It is outdoor. The children feed cats, rabbits, and goldfish. It's so happy ü•≥, except that it is a little hot, the swimming pool is not open. Chongming's strict management of epidemic prevention and control is still possible. The antigen is checked first, then the nucleic acid is checked, and it must be in 72 until you leave the store. The environment is good, there are hammocks on the balcony. I'm afraid of the cold, and it's cool to blow the air outside at night. Thanks again for my butler service. thanks

So when I couldn't leave the province, I chose the Hyatt again when I went to Chongming this time. The hotel's epidemic prevention measures were in place, which was reassuring. When I checked in, I was offered a room upgrade and enjoyed administrative benefits. I was also very friendly and invited to add a housekeeper wx. If I have any needs, I can contact the housekeeper as soon as possible. Full marks for favorability. We made a reservation at Pinyue Chinese Restaurant for dinner. The dishes were just like the photos, with all the colors, flavors and flavors without any surprises. After dinner, we took a walk in the hotel. It was very pleasant to walk around casually. Finally, we went to 799 to pack up the barbecue and returned to the room.
I have also stayed at Youyou Sheraton. Although it feels good, in terms of service, I still prefer Hyatt's meticulous and thoughtful service. Next time I go to Chongming, I will still choose Hyatt.

msg:As a Shanghainese, I have come to Chongming countless times, but I have missed Jin Mao Hyatt countless times. This time, because of the masks, I didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to take my children out to Shanghai to play in the summer vacation. I booked a pet room one day in advance, and brought my child, puppy, and mother to the hotel.

Hyatt's butler service is very attentive. We confirmed the hotel's epidemic prevention requirements in advance, asked about the floor preference, and told the children that the swimming pool was not open due to the epidemic, which made the children a little disappointed üòû But after arriving at the hotel, from the time of check-in, Hyatt made me feel Surprises are everywhere

The front desk staff saw that my family had a 14-year-old child and offered to give us a free breakfast, saving 88 yuan in extra meals. Because I booked a pet room, I also prepared a pet gift package for the dog, a lot of ******** and snacks, very thoughtful

In the afternoon, I take my children to the coffee bar to do homework. The location is very spacious, the light is sufficient, and there are many plugs. There is no need to worry about the phone and computer running out of power.

The pet-friendly hotel deserves its name. Not only does it have a small zoo, but there is a large lawn where dogs can walk. There are also many beautiful bird watching, puppies and ducks everywhere.

The Hyatt campus is a small activity center, with small games such as billiards, darts, manual football, etc. The children also had a good time.

The room includes happy hour. If you want to lose weight at dinner, go there and have a little sandwich, a small cake or a fruit salad. It's enough to save a dinner.

In the evening, I asked the waiter for a bed for the dog to sleep in. Unexpectedly, the waiter sent some ********, molar sticks and other products. My dog is too happy

This Hyatt is no longer new, but the overall maintenance is not bad. The attentiveness of the service staff has really added a lot of points to this trip. I should come to live in the future.

The Chinese restaurant in the hotel tastes great, but the price is a little high hhh. It is best to book in advance for many people on weekends. The overall level of the buffet breakfast is also above the standard. In addition, there is barbecue in the hotel at night. The price is also the level of a luxury hotel, so in the end We chose to drive 20 minutes to Chenjia Town. The fly in the oin**ent is that there are some problems with the rain shower in the room, and the customer service has also dealt with it in time.

The swimming pool and children's playground are not open. , The speed of the Chinese restaurant is very slow. The buffet in the morning is not delicious, but the weather in Chongming is very good. There is a wild lake behind the potato pet park where you can drive a toy boat. It does not feel like a parent-child hotel but a dog hotel.

Bacon ü•ì is fried and dry and hard, it is suitable for decoration on a plate. Don't live in Building 3, it's too far from the front desk, and it takes a long time to walk out.

The service is also good, especially the manager of the breakfast depar**ent is considerate. The facilities are damaged, the floor is creaky when you step on it, the toilet lid also slips, the cabinet door is loose, and there is a musty smell in the room, which is still far from the quality image of Hyatt. The swimming pool is still open, it should be closed due to the epidemic. Nucleic acid testing and on-site antigens are required. There is a Dongtan around, which is very popular. We went back to Changxing Island, which was very fun. All in all, still a good hotel.

A lot of disgusting and unknown garbage came out from the dead corner of the bathtub in the bathroom. We had to block it with towels. The result was even more weird and disgusting. After cleaning the next day, the towels were still there, and the garbage was still there.
[Services] The attitude of the security guards at the front desk and the door makes people feel completely relieved. The front desk inquired about some things about the tour, and there was no smile throughout the whole process, and he liked to ignore it. The security guard at the door is even worse, the exit is wrong, the female security guard is full of disgust and black face, seems to owe her five million? Really no sense of service.
[Question] I really have no confidence in Jin Mao, but is Hyatt just a name? Not involved in the management of the whole process?

Comments, I hope to be a little help to the guests who stay in the future. But we really won't be staying again!

msg:1. Parking without a concierge. There is a one-year-old child at the entrance of the lobby. It takes at least five minutes to pick up the box and push the cart, and then wait for my husband to drive the car to the side and park it. There is no concierge in the whole process. As soon as I entered the door and saw the concierge standing there, the first sentence was to call us antigens, instantly? ? ? ? You are here. . Then I take the luggage and you can&#39;t see me? I consulted twice by phone before check-in, and both told me that it only takes 48 hours for nucleic acid. When I arrived at the door, I told my one-year-old daughter to do the antigen (my daughter came with a 24-hour nucleic acid report), and told me that the antigen cannot be used. Check in? ? Why didn&#39;t you tell me on the phone before. And I have made two calls. 2. After apologizing politely, the manager of the lobby said that the room was upgraded to a parent-child room. In fact, everyone knows this kind of parent-child room, that is, the same room has a cartoon bed sheet and a small chair tent. 1) However, the bed sheets and quilt covers in the room were washed and faded, and the bath towels. . Anyway, there is definitely no mother to use, there is no laundry basket in the room. 2) The small bed is full of holes, and the bedspread on the big bed cannot cover the mattress. 3) This is a rare hotel that claims to be a family-friendly hotel without a bed fence. 3. About dining 1) There is no menu for ordering in the room. If you do not eat in, you can only call the restaurant and ask while ordering, or go to the restaurant door to watch the iPad to order. 2) The breakfast for two days was not on time, one hour late on the first day, half an hour late on the second day, less fruit for breakfast on the first day, less breakfast on the second day One serving of juice, two servings of fruit, and two servings of tableware, one large and one small, I am afraid that my daughter will eat it Just ignore the staff. Only a small, dark-skinned concierge said hello politely, and the lobby manager who dealt with problems on the first day would say hello. 2) The rubbish of other guests in the corridor was put there on Friday afternoon, and it was still there when they went downstairs at night, until they returned to the room at ten o&#39;clock. During the period, it is impossible for no staff to pass by, right? Just let the trash lie there? 3) The sense of service is extremely poor. In addition to eating once in a Chinese restaurant and a Western restaurant, there are also takeaways. When checking in, I specifically asked the staff how to get takeout? The staff informed that someone would be delivered to the takeaway in the lobby. As a result, I went downstairs to the lobby 45 minutes after the delivery was delivered to the takeaway at noon today, but it was still not available. Called the hotel and even told me to go to the door myself. . (In the end, we drove to pick it up by ourselves) 4) The shooting in the game room next to the lobby was broken (for this reason, we also bought game coins specially). After playing in the lobby for about half an hour, the garbage on the game machine is no one. to receive. As an old-fashioned parent-child hotel in Shanghai, it is really disappointing

The hardware of the hotel room is very good, and the double bed can take a 10-year-old child to squeeze with the mother without any problem. Although the breakfast only included 2 breakfasts when I booked the room, I didn't charge the child's breakfast fee when I checked out. I was very happy, and the breakfast variety was very rich and everything was available. Meal, because Chongming vegetables are really delicious, so I think it is the right choice to come to Chongming to eat more vegetables. Then those who have dogs at home can bring them to the hotel, and the dogs can be walked within the hotel, and they are also very happy. Yes, everyone must visit Dongtan, which is not far from the hotel. It is really good and the tickets are not expensive. Compared with the Shar Pei House in the hotel, feeding small animals is not suitable for big children like us. There is an equestrian home, maybe the price is too expensive, and I didn't see anyone riding it after a look around.

Especially from Yangpu and Hongkou, the Wuzhou Avenue in the Central Ring has been very smooth (not during the peak of the festival), and about an hour is enough. Hotel parkingüÖøÔ∏è is quite convenient, there are underground or on the ground, and there is charging at the entrance of the lobbyüîã, but I have not tried it.

üßπHygiene: The hygiene of the hotel has actually been tried very hard to maintain. But maybe in order to satisfy guests with pets, dogs can be brought here. Some guests are quite attentive and take care of their pets, while others may be too ignorant of the feelings of other guests. However, the hotel will reserve some areas for dogs, and there will also be buildings dedicated to pets. I am also an animal lover, but I still hope that the hotel can use its brains in this area to satisfy both pet owners and guests who generally require five-star hotels.

üçÉEnvironment: Chongming's environment and ecology are all good. The unique natural environment, the air is also very fresh. However, it is still far from the lively place of Chongming. The dishes of several nearby farmhouses are delicious, but I can't eat them all at once. üòÑRecommendation: Mom's small workshop, Dalong, and Lanhai and Hepinyue downstairs in the hotel. Lanhai can order delicious dishes.

üîîService: We arrived at the peak occupancy, and many rooms have not been cleaned. The front desk was very polite and helped me find a room. At first I agreed to go to the twin bed in building 4. But we were still cleaning, so we went to the restaurant for free, there were teaüçµ, coffee‚òïÔ∏è, and soft drinks to drink. However, there was no movement until 4:30, so we went to look for it again. This time it might be too late. The hotel upgraded us to a suite. The experience of the suite is still very good!
The staff are also great, which I think is good.

Finally, this time, there are also Yingdong Village ticketsüé´, the Shar Pei dog park downstairs for feeding small animals, and game coins... Maybe Chongming's entire tourism plan is not very mature, and there is really nothing to play. . However, swimming downstairs, resting in the hotel, walking around, eating farm food, if you are not in a hurry, it is actually quite leisurely.

msg:After returning from Chongming, I received a call back from Hyatt this afternoon.
All true feedback. The hotel has been collected for a long time, recommended by a friend, and the expectations were originally high. After moving in, the facilities are outdated. How can a hotel that has only opened for eight years be more vicissitudes than the Huating Hotel, which opened in 1986? ! The wood in the corridor leading to Building 4 is creaky, the room looks passable at first glance, turn on the bathroom light when washing at night, water stains and rust on the bridle, rust on the hanger, unwashed cups, upturned The wall covering and so on are all unbelievable that they are staying in a five-star hotel room. Chongming builds an international ecological island, and Jinmao Hyatt should be the top brand of the local hotel. To achieve this situation in the basic work, there must be long-term and serious problems in management.

Seeing that I was bringing two children and the elderly, he specially helped me to arrange a check-in as soon as possible, and a room was upgraded for free, which was convenient for taking care of my family. The hotel has an elegant environment, the rooms are clean, and there is no peculiar smell. You can see the starry sky from the balcony at night, which is a very good experience! I will continue to choose when I go to Chongming in the future!

msg:Seeing that it is Hyatt regency has actually lowered expectations automatically
I just didn't expect it to be so bad,
Room facilities are old,
Toilet paper is the worst and thinnest I've ever used,
Kind of can't believe it's Hyatt,
The bedding is damp, and it smells musty when you enter the house.
Only half of the air conditioners are turned on in the public area, restaurant and children's playground. It's ridiculous, even a five-star hotel should save this money.
Seeing a few outdoor slides for pets costs 98 yuan.
The children's pool is also closed.
The air conditioner in the indoor children's playground is not turned on, which is very unsuitable for bringing children. There is nothing for children to play in the hotel.
What's even more funny is that the housekeeping depar**ent waited for more than 40 minutes to disinfect the bathtub, and was urged many times before coming. It was the worst stay experience ever.
I hope the hotel can spend more time on improving service instead of asking guests to write good reviews.

In winter, I can only open the window and open the door to let the air The smell can be dissipated after convection (when the window is opened, the smell of the kitchen wafts over) but at night, I always have to close the window and close the door, and I still wake up in the middle of the night... The stench in the sewer, the trash can in the toilet and the moldy chair in the tissue box on the sink The footrests are damaged... The restaurant is not very cost-effective, especially the duck and white-cut mutton gave up after eating a chopstick... Before checking in, I asked Ctrip if there was a birthday cake that could be given away. The reply said that there would be a 0.5 pound small cake arrangement, which would be delivered later. It was a small cake. Fortunately, it was very difficult to eat. Otherwise, one bite for four people is not enough... In addition, the translation of "caring for pets" is also quite intoxicating.

Seeing that we brought our baby, they immediately upgraded us to a parent-child suite, which added a lot to this trip to Chongming. The entire hotel is well-equipped, especially the zoo, and the richness of animal species amazes me again and again. In addition to the regular sheep, rabbits, ducks, there are actually camels, foxes and snakes. The children had a great time playing, and it was a great experience.

msg:To be honest, I'm very disappointed~ I was recommended by major public accounts to plant grass before, and I was thinking of letting the baby fly for two days before school started. As a result, it was full on Sunday, and the problem of insufficient reception capacity of the hotel was suddenly exposed.
1. Arrived at 2 o'clock, said cleaning, checked in at 3 o'clock, arrived at 3:15 o'clock, it's still not good... Finally, I got the card at 4:20
2. I have booked a parent-child room, and no one asked me whether it was a boy or a girl during the whole stay. When I checked in, I said there were two babies, and I didn't ask me anything. Finally, I gave it to Thomas, and the baby was not happy when he entered the door. The hotel sent two small cakes, but still couldn't change rooms.
3. The cleaning should be in a hurry, and an old slipper was dug out from under the tent. . . Not to mention the visible ash under the bed in the corner...
4. The next morning, I waited for half an hour for breakfast to enter the restaurant. It was past nine o‚Äôclock. The restaurant was obviously overwhelmed, and the dishes couldn‚Äôt be served, not to mention the services such as withdrawals‚Ä¶
5. The Little Shar Pei Dog House, the front desk is 98 yuan, two big and one small, one ticket, which is extremely deceitful...I won't say it if the taste is heavy. After turning around, people kept sighing, "These animals are too pitiful. ". Different animals are mixed together, the dog is trapped in the frame, and the eyes are helpless and stupid... I feel like I just grabbed a few animals and trapped them in a small piece... By the way, a few carrot sticks cost 20 yuan.
6. But if you don't go to the Shar Pei Little Zoo, what else can the baby play? The hotel's own free amu*****t park is very small, and it's next to the swimming pool and gym! ! The familiar smell of disinfection in the swimming pool has always filled the entire amu*****t park. The key is that it is hot and stuffy. It feels stuffy without ventilation all the year round... There is no staff in the amu*****t park, just a front desk and swimming and fitness are registered together, and it doesn't matter inside, so the things It is common sense to be bad seven, seven or eight.
7. In addition, the garden in the hotel turned around for ten minutes, and found that it was finished. . . There's really nothing to turn around...
8. Only swimming and balcony swing chairs are left to pass the time, but in winter...the balcony is extremely cold. . .
9. By the way, when I left the store, there was a return call, saying that they would send me Chongming cakes? ? And then no and then...it felt like a scam call. . .
As I write, I feel that I have given a high score... I don't know how so many good reviews that are suitable for parents and children come from? ? ?

The most basic thing is to not have hair or dirt, but the last guest‚Äôs paper balls and hair are still on the noodle pool. It was all water stains, and there was a lot of ash everywhere. When I turned around and saw that the lights were not on here, the door here was broken.
At 8:55 in the morning of the first day, the cleaning uncle came and knocked on the door and asked if he needed to clean the room. He knocked on the door and came in, telling the uncle to come in at 11:30 when the staff came in and asked to change all the bedding. I was happy but replaced it. At the same time, there were engineering problems mentioned at the beginning of the above, and I reported to the staff that the staff immediately asked us to apply for repairs by ourselves. He was just a temporary worker and didn‚Äôt know the policy of the hotel. I think the training of the staff is sincere. There are big problems.
On the first day, I arrived at the hotel at 3:30 pm, and I went with one room, and the other one waited until 5:00, which is understandable. When I waited for the room at the same time, I came to Coffee Bar and wanted to order afternoon tea. The staff looked impatient and their attitude was neither salty nor light. Here, the manager who took the lead for breakfast the next day was very polite and thoughtful.
As a Villa, since the cleaning is not good and the service is not in place, what is the selling point of the hotel? I hope ********* can train his employees more. He is also Hyatt. Why has Lujiazui Hyatt been doing so well for so many years?

The hotel room looks fine at first glance, but doesn't stand up to the details. The top of the bed protruded a lot from the mattress and our family kicked it several times...the carpet on the mattress was a little dirty. The lights in the wardrobe flickered inexplicably after the lights were turned off, and I was too lazy to apply for repairs in the middle of the night, but it affected our sleep... The swimming pool is quite small and the water temperature is high, suitable for parents and children to play in the water, not suitable for swimming. There are not many kinds of breakfast, really less. There will be a long queue for the guests who come from behind, so it is recommended to go early.

We chose Western food for dinner. Now, steak, pasta, fruit salad, and some snacks. The price is high for more than 500 yuan. The taste is not bad. The children like it. The breakfast the next day is very rich. The service of the staff is very enthusiastic, especially reminding that there will be noise outside the door from 4 to 5:00 in the morning, which will affect sleep. Overall, I am satisfied with the stay at the hotel. It is more suitable for bringing children and families to play. It is quiet and comfortable. The traffic is also convenient.

I chose a more expensive one the next day, and there were not as many restaurants nearby as Nanmen. The disadvantage is that the children's playground does not match the grade of the hotel. In addition, the season may not be right when winter comes, and it is impossible to pick when it rains... There is no way to get out of Shanghai.

The balconies of the two rooms are corners, not due to the south, but the rooms are relatively large. The bathroom has two doors leading to the corridor and the room, which is relatively rare. The hotel can bring pets, and the pets and the guests do not intersect. The hotel also provides pet park tickets, that is, the pet park is too small, and the variety of pets is crowded. The hotel's service attitude is enthusiastic, and it helps us solve any difficulties in time, reflecting the five-star standard. The only parking lot is a bit lacking.

This is my second time staying at the Hyatt. My friend originally wanted to book a B&B, but I strongly recommend this place. Although this Hyatt is a bit old and the decoration is not that new, the service is very good and basically responds to all requests. We had an extra friend who wanted an extra breakfast, so we gave it as a gift. As a second-child family, both children are free of charge, which is very generous.
The hotel focuses on parent-child care, and this time there were more small animals than before, and we even gave them carrots for feeding. The breakfast was quite satisfactory, but what stood out was the Chris**as coffee served during Chris**as, which was full of ritual. It's been warm these days, and it's really comfortable to sit in the warm winter sun and have breakfast.
Personally, I prefer big hotels, where I can spend a long time walking around. B&B costs over 1,000 yuan, dried tofu place, porridge and steamed buns set meal for 38 RMB for breakfast. Hyatt 699, isn‚Äôt it delicious, delicious, delicious and funüòèI will also send you Chongming cake after the trip~

The waiter Liu Houyan's enthusiasm and patience made us enjoy a very satisfying meal.

In addition, the dog's set menu is too expensive, and the dog does not eat too much. The meal is 88, it is recommended to improve

The hotel has been around for some years, and the appearance is well maintained. The Chinese and Western decorations are distinctive but they also take up some space. The toilets are also very large, resulting in the rooms not being very well laid out. The swimming pool is clean, fully furnished, with doll pool, and the doll pool water is very hot, considerate. There are not many people in the adult pool, so you can swim happily. The ticket for the Shar Pei Dog House is actually a children‚Äôs playground plus a small zoo. The children are having fun. If the ticket is not sent, it is also recommended that adults can take their children to play, which can kill a lot of time. Dinner at Pinyue, worthy of the standard of a five-star restaurant, no matter the taste or the environment. In particular, I want to say that the hotel‚Äôs service is really in place.

I remembered that the overall experience of Hyatt was better, so I booked it again. But because I didn't use the pre-sale package only one day in advance, and the double bed room was not booked, I booked the garden-view double bed, and noted the combined double bed and taking care of the two-year-old baby. I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at the hotel and was told to upgrade to the Big Mouth Monkey themed suite for free. I actually never booked a parent-child room. I thought it was just a tent slide or something. It was a gimmick. I never thought that the baby would actually eat this set. I was very happy and kept playing. On the way home, I still reluctantly asked when I would go to the little monkey's house. In terms of service, there was no hot milk in the dinner buffet, but the service staff saw that they took the children to help and picked up a cup in the coffee shop. The plates were collected in a timely manner. Most of the service staff would also take the initiative to say hello, and the service was pretty good. In terms of facilities, the interior decoration does have a sense of age, and the sanitation is okay; when we went to the swimming pool, it was only our family and I felt very good, but the indoor park next to the swimming pool was really shabby, too small, and relatively old. It‚Äôs free to play. Play to pass the time; Shar Pei‚Äôs house is outsourced, and it costs 98 yuan. There are many types of animals, but I feel that the staff does not care about animals. Shar Pei‚Äôs eyes are red and swollen, and there are a lot of eye feces. I don‚Äôt know if there is any For trea**ent, the aunt who cleaned the sheeppen scolded while sweeping because the sheep kept barking. She felt that the animals were very pitiful and had a bad impact on the children. In short, if you bring your children to Chongming, you will come here without worry.

The room is large and has been upgraded, thank you to everyone in the hotel.
The hotel‚Äôs parents and children are excellent, with a small zoo and an equestrian field.
The hotel‚Äôs recreational facilities seem to be open 24 hours a day, and it should be the only one in Shanghai.
There are billiards, table tennis, and KTV on the first floor of the hotel.
Breakfast starts at 7 o'clock, and there is a seat service, there are many types of breakfast, and the replenishment is very timely.
You can upgrade from Hyatt to Grand Hyatt, too!
I will check in next year and barbecue in summer! Especially Effie sister! Thanks!

I have heard of this old pet-friendly hotel for a long time, and I can really feel the love and dedication of this hotel for pets in this personal experience. First of all, I would like to thank the hotel manager Gu Gu. She was very enthusiastic to help us check in and took the initiative to upgrade us to pet suites. She also introduced us to various hotel facilities, dining venues, and activities with pets very enthusiastically and professionally. Thanks again to Gu Gu for his considerate service. In addition, the other staff in the hotel are very enthusiastic and professional and very friendly to pets, making us feel at home. The hotel is all pet-friendly, including the western restaurant, which also has a special area for pets. For those of us who often travel with pets, this is really very considerate, and there are very few similar hotels that can do this. There is also a large lawn in the hotel for pets to play, let the puppies run freely. Very good experience, will come often in the future.

The staff has always hoped not to give bad reviews. Let me talk about me. I asked whether the hotel is a five-star hotel. The staff said that it is not a five-star hotel, but it is a hotel built according to a five-star hotel. When the parking lot of the hotel is reached, the charging pile parking space cannot be charged at all. The piles are all furnishings. I asked the staff that the charging piles are indeed working and cannot be charged. On the first day of the stay with the children, it was already more than 5 o‚Äôclock in the evening. I was too lazy to eat at the hotel‚Äôs Chinese restaurant. The waiter was very far away from us. It‚Äôs far away, it‚Äôs not just a call, there are service charges, dizziness, there are flies in the restaurant, the next day, we have the VIP Club card, that is, you can enjoy some fruits in the hotel from 5:30 to 7:30 in the evening. Cakes, snacks, etc., there is nothing to eat until 7 o'clock... The waiter saw us coming, so he added some dates and ham... There were two remaining cakes. The next few tables were on the dining table. The food is quite plentiful and we are not hungry. After all, we just finished our meal, but the experience is very bad... Shar Pei‚Äôs House, not bad, you can spend most of the day with the children, the hotel swimming pool, so-so, there is no waiter... Self-service swimming mode... I have to ask something, but no one asks... The overall experience is really mediocre, a hotel that won't come back again

msg:The five-star hotel deserves its name.
In terms of service, all the hotel staff I met were super friendly, always smiling, and took care of the children many times during the stay.
The room was very clean, although it was written to check in at 3 o'clock, it was basically OK at 2 o'clock. There is also a swing sofa on the balcony, so the children have fun. The only downside is that the main building, the check-in building, the swimming pool, and the children‚Äôs playground are scattered in different buildings. It is a bit tiring to walk with the child for a long time.
Children's entertainment facilities:
There is a game machine world in the main building. Checking in gave 20 game coins. Because there were 2 coin-operated card machines, I found the front desk and gave the children 30 game coins directly. The children enjoyed playing gashapon.
There is a swimming pool in Building 5 with a constant temperature of 28 degrees and a children's pool, which is very suitable for young children. Next to the swimming pool is a gym and an indoor children‚Äôs playground, with ocean balls and some learning toys, enough for children to play.
There is also a cute pet paradise outdoor, there are some small animals and slide rocking horses, this is a ticket, we got coupons for staying in, for 2 big and one small, because there are not many people, it is very user-friendly to us 3 adults are hired, and there are carrots for sale to feed small animals, 20 yuan a basket.
In addition, there is a football field, basketball court and equestrian club, because the children are too young to play.
Riding: There are single bicycles, double bicycles, and bicycles with baby seats. I mistakenly thought that our package had a free ride coupon. After checking, we didn‚Äôt. The front desk also gave us bicycles very friendly. The baby was riding for the first time. , Very happy and grateful.
Breakfast: 7 to 10 o'clock. The food is rich and tastes good. There are baby chairs and baby tableware provided.
The check-in package also comes with a ticket to Yingdong Village. It takes about 10 minutes to drive and basically 2 hours to play. There is also a children‚Äôs playground, crab catching and boat cruises.
4 big and one small 2 days and 1 night, very enjoyable, I will definitely stay a few more nights next time.

The staff inside love small animals very much, are very patient, and can deal with them immediately when they see a dog peeing.
We checked in because the cleaning was late, and the enthusiastic manager took the initiative to apply for an upgrade to the suite. The room was very clean, the environment was very good, and food was prepared for the dog. Very considerate, this time it was worth it!
In this hotel, there are many dog owners who bring their dogs to play, and there is a swimming pool for dogs, and there are rooms for dogs to blow their fur.
In addition, üê∂ also enjoyed the pet set meal, very fresh chicken head and beef balls.
What makes the dog most happy is that there is a large lawn where we can socialize with many dogs. It is also the first time that we have brought a 1-year-old dog to let it run freely. It is also safe for the dogs to play together.
I have already recommended friends around me to play. It seems to be a must-visit hotel for the whole family after we have a dog.
I hope that the Hyatt Regency Chongming Hotel can host dog activities, and we will actively participate.

Only the big-mouthed monkeys are the tightest listings. Fortunately, the children like it very much. There are also mini slides and big-mouthed monkey puzzles to play. The suite is not big, I don't know if it is because of the view of the layout. The room always feels that it is not enough. The children's washing and nursing supplies in the bathroom are very complete. In the suite, there is a butler with WeChat, so you can find the butler for anything. We asked the butler to reserve a place for dinner at Pinyue, and the service was very enthusiastic. There are not many parking spaces in the hotel, which may be due to holidays. Every night there is no place in the underground garage and it can only be parked on the road.
Another major feature of the hotel is the children‚Äôs playground. The name is Little Shar Pei Dog‚Äôs House. You can enter and exit freely on the day of a fee of 98 yuan. In addition to the playground, there is also a small ranch. There are alpacas, peacocks, rabbits, pigs, Mianyang and other animals that can be fed. Children love it. Interact with animals.

msg:Taking my family out on Mid-Autumn Festival, the overall feeling is quite tidy. Arrived earlier in the morning and couldn't check in, so I went to the nearby Yingdong Village to play around. After eating the farmhouse, I came to check in more than 2 o'clock. One room has been cleaned, and the other one needs to be waited. There was no news until 4 o'clock, and then I went to the front desk to ask, and then said that it was cleaned. The entire hotel is courtyard-style, there are about 6 buildings, we are staying in 2 buildings this time, we need to walk for a while, winding and twisting, like walking the Jiuqu Bridge. After check-in, I found that the bed in the room is very big. It may be a combination of two beds. It is especially suitable for our two big and one small. Said that the twin rooms are full and cannot be combined). The parents‚Äô room is an ordinary 1.8-meter bed. The room is quite big, the balcony has a swing, the toilet has a bathtub, and children can play. The pillows in the room are too soft, suitable for people who don‚Äôt like to use pillows. There are two problems with two doors in the room. One is the balcony door, which cannot be locked. It should be because the lock has moved down. If you are wrong, it has been unable to lock the door. The other is the sliding door of the bathroom. Location, so it can't be moved. Fortunately, the toilet and shower room have separate glass doors inside, so we didn't bother to find the front desk to repair the door.
I don‚Äôt think there are many places for children‚Äôs activities. Pippi has a slide but it costs an extra charge. The package I bought this time just happened to be a free ticket, otherwise it is estimated that the tickets are not cheap. There is also a small children's playground at the entrance of the gym, suitable for young children, but not much for older children.
The breakfast at the hotel is good, with a lot of variety and good taste~ I am very satisfied with the overall stay.

There was a small problem when I started to check in. The waiting time was too long. It took about half an hour and then I got the room card and found that I couldn't enter the room. I went to the front desk to come back and still couldn't enter the room. At this time, I waited for 15 minutes and I had to go to the front desk directly. I apologized for helping us upgrade the room this time


üßπHygienic: I think it‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs not as dirty as other reviews say. If there are too many mosquitoes, don‚Äôt open the door of the yard.

üîîService: What makes me happier here is the pet service. The pets are friendly everywhere. Dogs can go almost everywhere. You can dine together in the afternoon tea area. Breakfast can also be used with the owner. Of course, the owner should bring dog tableware.

üöó Transportation: It‚Äôs really convenient to come from downtown Shanghai on weekdays without traffic jams and arrive in an hour without getting tired. It‚Äôs suitable for a short trip for the whole family.

üçÉEnvironment: Although the decoration of the hotel is not so new, it also meets the standards of a five-star hotel. There are a lot of things to play around the hotel. KTV chess room, horse farm, swimming pool, gym, and various facilities basically have places to eat. Western food, Chinese food, farmhouse dishes, and barbecue. The choice is not too small

During the holiday, make an appoin**ent with a small partner to bring your own baby on vacation. The dog will be very happy. How can a friend who loves a dog like this pet-friendly hotel miss itüòÑ

Location traffic:
    Hyatt Regency Jinmao is located in the eastern part of Chunming Island, üöòself-driving from downtown Shanghai üëâüèª As soon as you cross the Yangtze River Bridge üëâThis garden villa hotel in the forest is less than 1 hour before your eyes!
üìçAddress: Lane 799, Lanhai Road, Chenjia Town, Ming Dynasty
  Ten kilometers away from the East Wetland Park, far away from the downtown area, the environment is clean, if you are like us, and you are lazy [naughty] don't want to work too hard, just want to vacation, then eat and drink here, even if you don't go out, you won't be bored.
    There are several cages of parrots in the corridors of the hotel. Every time you pass by, they will tease these little cute ones. There are children's playgrounds and clubs for children to play; there are also cute alpacas, incense, sandpi, rabbits, and ostriches in the cute pet park. It is a good place for parent-child vacations.

Room facilities:
     Although the hotel room is not big, the bathroom is large enough, and the hotel balcony is my favorite. There is a big sofa rocking chair. Sitting on it, drinking coffee, watching the scenery, lying on it, reading magazines, and looking at the mobile phone are all extremely enjoyable.

     The hotel is adjacent to Dongtan Wetland Park Migratory Bird Reserve. Standing on the balcony of the room early in the morning, the birds whisper and the flowers scent, embracing the new day [color]

Pet room pet park, you don‚Äôt have to worry about traveling with your dog
Overall, I recommend this parent-child tour to give children a happy paradise
One of the few hotels where you can bring pets, you can take your dog to walk on the lawn of the cute pet park, or put the dog in the pet room to be supervised by someone.

swimming pool:
    In the heated swimming pool in the hotel, the little guy just learned how to swim üèä just to play freely! Of course, the swimming pool also has a special baby paddling pool.

I arrived at the lobby at two o‚Äôclock and checked in for five minutes. I got two rooms smoothly (compared to the other house I checked in the day before and got the room only at 4 o‚Äôclock). The cleaning aunts I met along the way would say hello politely and in a mood It also gets better in an instant, this is the correct way to open a resort hotel.
The hotel hardware is indeed old, but üßπThe sanitation is not bad, the interior is tree-linedüçÉ The environment is also ok. As a parent-child hotel, there are many recreational items, but it is still a bit insufficient in the summer vacation: the activity room is very good. Big but only one ping-pong table, the racket wear and tear is serious. I am afraid that there will be too many people to swim. The cute pet paradise does attract children, but the hygiene is really a bit... and the state of the animals looks a bit poor. The son said this is the ugliest alpaca he has ever seen. The hair is clumped, and it is also Jin Maokai Yue, the Lijiang family raises alpacas more seriously (the last picture)
Regarding breakfast, I went there at 8:30. It should be a high score for the flow of people, but I still found a seat under the guidance of the waiter. The dishes are not rich but the quality is good, and the supplement is very timely.
In short, this package is still very good value for money.

The first is the variety of breakfast, there are really not many options. On Sunday, because of the crowds, breakfast was delayed until 11 o'clock, but Chongming cake was not added from 10 o'clock.
The second is the parent-child area. If it is a parent-child hotel, there is really nothing other than an indoor swimming pool and a small indoor children's play area. Before leaving the store, I found that the pet area is much larger than the children‚Äôs area in Tudou Pet Park, and there is a swing that has been in disrepair in Tudou, and a slide with a lot of spider webs. In addition to feeding animals, there is also an outdoor slide in the Shar Pei Dog Park. , But if you don‚Äôt want to feed animals and just want to slide, you have to buy tickets for 98 yuan/person, which doesn‚Äôt feel very reasonable.
Finally, the service is really average. I don't know if it is because of the policy of not leaving Shanghai because of the epidemic. There are many guests in the hotel, so the attitude of the service staff is very indifferent. When staying at Hyatt in other places, even if it is not a lower-end brand hotel, the service staff will greet the guests of the hotel. Not at all here. The hotel is a bit roundabout, usually someone will take it, or under the guidance, there is no place at all, and there is no staff to help push the luggage.
In addition, since 8/6, Chongming has launched a hotel or homestay, and you can enter the Flower Expo Cultural Park for free with the store‚Äôs certificate. I feel that the staff are not very familiar with the rules, such as check-in time and admission time requirements. Although the facts have proved that the park is not strictly controlled, the original intention was to attract everyone to go, but it is quite sad to ask the staff if they don't know.
It would be better if it could be improved!

msg:The quality of Hyatt has always been guaranteed. As a resort hotel, its content is relatively rich. There is a small zoo, an equestrian experience, a pet leisure area, etc. Because it is purely a holiday, I choose to stay in the hotel. Relatively speaking, the hotel‚Äôs facilities are very suitable for us who love to make a hotel. In terms of catering, the sanitation and quality of food are worth experiencing. The carefully selected ingredients are relatively amazing. What makes me feel more attentive is the use of many Chongming specialty ingredients, which are very regional. Although it is a pet-friendly hotel but without pets, we found out that the pet room was separate from us. This is worthy of our care... It's very safe and caring. And even if they meet families with pets, their upbringing is very friendly. Will come on holiday again next time hee hee.

Otherwise, it must be very pleasant to sit on it at night and read a book. A cup of coffee in the hotel is 48 yuan, which is delicious and beautiful, and the swimming pool is also very large. The only drawback is that the air conditioner is too cold to adjust the temperature. We adjusted it to 30 degrees. The room was still only 20 degrees. It was a bit cold. Finally, the air conditioner was turned off and it was just right to sleep. The hotel is still worth choosing, especially recommended is the breakfast buffet, small wontons, noodles are delicious, freshly made omelette fritters, we took four times, memories of the school door when we were young.

msg:I stayed in a homestay for 2 days before, and then I thought about staying in a five-star hotel.
Overall evaluation, very disappointed, will not come again in the future.
To be specific: the gate is very impressive, the security services are not bad, and the set of epidemic prevention procedures can be said to be fine.
When I checked in, the sister at the front desk did not wear a mask, and the other one was. As a guest, I wear them all, and you should wear them too, because you are a receptionist and you come into contact with many guests from all corners of the world every day. Then during the process, a male waiter came over and talked to this sister. She was helping us with the process and was scolding the man. Although the voice was not loud, I was right in front of you and made mistakes in the hands of the man. Things are torn, my sister is very "powerful", some things are locked up and solved by yourself, it would be nice to show the good things to the guests!
When I entered the room, I found that: the air conditioner is not working well. No matter how many winds you adjust, it is the same size and the door lock function is still broken. I immediately contacted the front desk, and then it was gone. I waited for 10 minutes and didn‚Äôt give it to me. In reply, I took the initiative to call the front desk again, and, as a guest, I directly gave a solution. The content: You can find someone to repair the air conditioner and repair the door casually, but you can‚Äôt let the guest wait unlimited. You should reply to Solution, now I take the initiative to call you and ask for a room change. The front desk will reply and ask, I said, please call me back, and I will wait for you. This time I called back within a few minutes and said to change the room. I took the initiative to mention that I would come to the front desk to change the room card. Fortunately, she said that there was someone in the concierge that I asked him to send you to your room and take you to the new room. At this point, I am still satisfied. Before leaving, I ran into the air conditioner repairer when I left. When I walked in, I didn't ask anything. First, I thought the air conditioner was pretty cool. I don't want you to think that both of me now feel that the air conditioner is not working. Changing the room is slightly better, but the air conditioner is still not very cool, and the wind speed has not changed. To sum up the front desk, customer service, and maintenance depar**ent, the training is not in place. I personally think that your grassroots or middle-level leaders have problems. Where do the management concepts start from? ! Your leadership is biased, so your employees have problems in every depar**ent. This is the case for an employee. It may be his own problem. If the entire team has problems, please reflect on the leaders above!
Come back and talk about breakfast, there are not many varieties, and they are crowded in a small place, but there are really too many people eating. I went at 9 o‚Äôclock on the first day. There were many people. There was nothing to eat. I had noodles. Finally, The green vegetables are gone, and the spicy pork topping only has a layer of oil. All the little chefs who cook are a little unhappy, and there are also a few who come over to make breakfast part-time, not to mention which stall is the little brother. The next day I chose to come at 7:30 in the morning. There were more people and I was arranged to be far away. It was too exhausting to take a trip. There were too many people and few things, and I had to concentrate in a circular meal area. not too good.
I went to the barbecue for dinner. I wanted to have a barbecue set meal. I was told that I didn‚Äôt have it. Then I had a shovel of fresh food. My husband said that my stomach was uncomfortable after eating. 68 A bowl of 10 wontons, expensive is expensive, but, as others have commented, it is delicious, it can be said that it is very delicious, the meat is tender, and the taste is a little sweet. The edamame and green eggplant are also fried well, very fragrant, the eggplant is very soft, and the edamame is very crisp, so I added a bowl of white rice.
The hotel recommends 28 pieces of special cakes. I only bought one piece. I think it's average. It depends on the individual.

msg:The pet discount hotel has been growing for a long time. I didn‚Äôt come to experience it when it was more than 900 years ago. Now the pet room at Jiabinxuan has increased to more than 1.4k working days. It is more expensive on weekends and holidays. This time I checked the weather forecast. It‚Äôs hot and sunny. Come here to check in and experience the pet room. I have stayed in countless star-rated hotels at home and abroad in the past. Hyatt‚Äôs quality is still well-known, and the facilities are a bit old, but the bathroom raining equipment I care most about is still OK. The shower water pressure is sufficient and the temperature is well controlled. The bathtub did not have a disposable bath bag, so I didn't enjoy it. The pet-friendly large lawn can be used for flying dogs, which is great! You can also have dogs in designated areas for meals. There is no odor in the entire hotel. There are air purifiers in the rooms and corridors. The only drawback is that the road to the room is a bit boring. Building 3 is a bit far away, all the way to the nine districts and eighteen bends, the best road It‚Äôs a bit of a painting exhibition feature, and the automatic door is well received! The swimming pool is also a highlight, clean and comfortable! Have the opportunity to spend a leisure vacation with family and friends again!

There is a cute pet paradise and horse farm in the hotel, there are slides, you can feed small animals, you can ride horses, although there is an additional charge, but the children like it very much and have a good time. Had a lunch in the hotel's Chinese restaurant. The environment was good and the dishes tasted good. It was much more expensive than the farmhouse, but it was a restaurant in a five-star hotel with a different grade. There are many Internet celebrity farmhouse dishes around the hotel, it is very convenient to drive there, you can try it. In general, Hyatt Regency Chongming Jinmao is worth staying at, good, recommended, and will come back again in the future.

msg:I checked into the Hyatt Regency Chongming Jinmao with a joyful mood. I checked in at the front desk at around 1:30 pm and told the booked room has not yet come out and I need to wait for the room. At this time, the hotel began to sell! Add 350 yuan to upgrade the parent-child room, and 800 yuan to upgrade the executive suite. The executive room enjoys executive benefits. Drinks, snacks, and light meals in the evening are also good to think about. The Hyatt Hotel is a 5-star hotel with good executive benefits, so decisively add 800 yuan to upgrade. When I entered the room, I was surprised that the room smelled of musty, the decoration and the equipment were outdated. After checking on the Ctrip website, I actually wrote that the decoration of Ctrip in 2018 was rated as a 5-diamond hotel. I am speechless too üòì! After a short break, I took the children to the swimming pool to play in the locker. The slippers were wet and repeatedly used without changing each customer. The toes of the child who had just been swimming in the water was also slid by a sharp object under the pool. Finally, return to the room early for disinfection trea**ent. At about 5:30, I went to the coffee bar to see the administrative trea**ent that I enjoyed in the evening. The good guy opened my eyes (see the picture below). A bucket of rice, a bucket of beef tenderloin, a bucket of chicken with mushrooms, and a bucket. Green vegetables, a bucket of soup of unknown things, two pots of fruit without any drinks. This is too far from what I had previously promoted. This is an administrative trea**ent, and it is simply a roadside fast food restaurant. I would like to ask the hotel management, do you know what the executive floor trea**ent is? What services do you need to provide to guests on the executive floor? Adding 800 yuan feels like being cheated. Finally, contact the hotel through Ctrip's complaint and refund the 800 yuan upgrade fee. After the money was returned to the account, no one from the hotel came to communicate with the guests. In conclusion, the service environment grade is not in line with the hotel brand. We hope that the hotel will cherish the valuable comments made by every guest.

msg:I think the only reason why this hotel recommends it is that you can bring pets~ The overall service and hardware of the hotel can‚Äôt be rated as 5 stars to be honest, from the fact that there is no welcome at the door, to the indifferent service attitude at the front desk to check in. Birth points. Because it is a pet room, it is not very good to enter the door without preparing pet supplies in advance. After all, those who book the pet room are taking their own pets on vacation, so I called the front desk to inform the needs, and I probably waited for it. It took half an hour...
Room facilities and decoration are old. The design of the bed frame beside the bed is very unreasonable... I accidentally injured it many times, maybe because of the limited space...
For various reasons, I originally wanted to stay. Then I stayed for a day and went home decisively~
Also talk about the hotel‚Äôs breakfast. I read the reviews before going, so I didn‚Äôt expect it to be rich, but it was actually better than expected. The buffet breakfast in the five-star hotel is also not satisfactory. The bread in their baking area is really not as good as expected. The bread in the ordinary bakery outside... Kazun has no appetite after seeing it...

The management is in place, and any requirements will be resolved quickly. We brought two children under the age of 12, and there was no problem when we checked in. Although an extra bed could be added, it was too crowded. The original sofa in the room was enough to sleep one person. The breakfast is very rich. Although the package stipulates that you can bring a child under 12 for free, but you don‚Äôt care about bringing an extra child. There is also a lot of content for children to play, and the children are very happy. One of the shortcomings is that the pool ends too early, 8:00 in the evening. After eating dinner and preparing to swim, I was told in the past that it was about to end. The second is that the price of the Chinese restaurant is too expensive, because there is no commercial area around, you have to drive a long way out to eat. In addition to the hot weather, many customers want to eat in the restaurant nearby. If the price is more favorable, they will be given to the residents and brought. It is very convenient and affordable. Hope it can be improved. Overall evaluation five stars!

There are a lot of green plants but no mosquitoes. It is a pet-friendly hotel. The staff like the dogs in the corridor very much. The dog can‚Äôt hold back peeing or someone will come to clean up the smell right away, but the families with dogs are also very harmonious, at least the dogs we encountered did not fight or anything. Many families with children deal with dogs. The highly receptive swimming pool is open until nine in the evening, and there are many people in the hotter weather. If friends with dogs want to order a set meal and afternoon tea for the dog, it is recommended to order it in advance. It takes an hour to make and the self-service in the evening is OK. For those who bring the dog to eat, the location is in the afternoon tea area, as it is relatively rare, it is recommended to go in advance

Parking is free. If you drive out, it will be more difficult to find the location when you come back at night. We went to the big lawn to play before we left. We haven't found this lawn on the first day. It is very suitable for big dogs. The lawn can be run with a rope.

The overall evaluation is good, mainly to take the dog out to play, it is recommended to stay in for parent-child and pet outings

A total of 2 rooms were booked for family outing. MM at the front desk heard that there were children, and thoughtfully upgraded a parent-child room. As soon as the child entered the room, he flew happily. The parent-child room originally arranged is her favorite Hello Kitty! I wanted to go to Dongtan without raining, but the weather was raining one after another, so I couldn't make the trip. But in the hotel, there is really no idle time for a minute, the indoor children's playground, outdoor cute pet playground, indoor swimming pool children's pool, and racecourse are not pulled down!
The catering is also remarkable. The set menu comes with dinner and breakfast, which are very rich and the dishes are guaranteed. There is a large flow of people on weekends, and the staff are actively solving various problems. give it a like!
Will choose next time I go to Chongming!

In addition, the hotel will buy a free shuttle bus to eat at the Flower Expo, and it is very convenient to open 4 classes a day, so we stayed This hotel. The service of this hotel is very good. After the shuttle bus is scheduled, the front desk customer service will confirm in advance that the parent-child Fangxiang is beautiful, and the political Huangmeiji also has a moisture absorber that can dry clothes. The most important thing is that the political child is the first birthday, and the hotel will also make the children‚Äôs birthday decorations to make the children feel very happy, and I am also very touched. We will definitely come back to such a cozy hotel, the most important thing is that the children are reluctant to leave.

The environment is comfortable, there are birds singing in the lobby, and the air is filled with beautiful fragrance. There are many green plants outdoors, the grass is clean and hydrated after the rain, and the small mushrooms emerging from the grass are even more interesting.

msg:The hotel is very new, there are dolls of kaws at the door, and there is a small train at the door, which is full of parent-child style.
Seeing that I was holding a child, I directly upgraded the parent-child room. I saw many people who came to the hotel holding Hongwu. The pet room is also its feature.
The parent-child room is slightly larger than the standard room and has more cartoonish furnishings. The furnishings of the rooms are very new. There is mineral water, Cola, Sprite, and beer in the refrigerator for free use. The bath is a little bit more than three-piece. It is an unknown brand customized by the hotel and has a common verbena flavor.
The entire hotel is low-rise but built in the woods, and the cloister is located at the second floor height, which makes people feel like walking through the woods with a sense of design.
Let‚Äôs talk about the buffet breakfast. It is quite satisfactory. There are not many pastries and snacks. It is mainly Chinese style, and there is no early snack that impresses me. It belongs to the next five-star breakfast buffet. The hotel buffet dinner is only available on Friday and Saturday, and there is no chance to taste it.
There are swimming pools and gymnasiums, but most of them come for walking their babies or dogs, and I didn't pay attention to how this facility is. The ice cream stand at the door tastes good, it is recommended to buy one.
