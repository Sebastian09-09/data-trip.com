The room that I was given was an upgrade . The room is very nice and I really like the bathroom. One can watch TV while soaking in the tub. The only snag was the supposed clever WC did not work. The balcony also provided a good convenience for me as I am a smoker. Have ash tray provided, so no need to go down to street level every time that I want to enjoy a cigarette. Price is a bit high but still might consider coming back. Had dinner at the japanese restaurant at ground floor of hotel, pricey but food was average.

msg:I believe it would not be wrong if we divide the luxurious/upscale hotel industry into two clubs. The first is those standardized hotels, like Sheraton and Crowne Plaza. Everything there, be it the people or the hardware, is decent; decent in the sense that a guest would not identify anything particularly bad to be concerned with. However, it is also just decent, only ‚Äì nothing can induce deep appreciation. The second group includes those respected players in the hotel industry, like Mandarin Oriental and the URC hotels. In terms of services, their ladies and gentlemen treat guests with passion, temperature, and tailormade care. In terms of hardware, they have things that even architects and interior designers can stop for at least a while to taste. While it is easy to put many luxurious/upscale hotels into one of these categories, I struggle to do so with Kempinski Guangzhou ‚Äì It is very much in between.

One major reason why Kempinski Guangzhou is very much in between is because of its hardware. Things would be very straightforward if we only referred to its public area, which is literally equivalent to the lobby. To be very plainspoken, Its lobby is boring. We go in, we see a few no-more-than-normal sofa, then we see the conventional check-in desks laying against the wall. I would not be surprised if someone tell me everything in that small rectangular lobby is copied and pasted directly from the many Hilton hotels in the US (not a compliment, as everyone how ‚Äúgood‚Äù Hilton is in the US). That is why I wrote that things would be way more straightforward if we just looked at the lobby of this Kempinski ‚Äì we could confidently put this property into the decent (vs respected) category. However, things get a little bit complicated when we also take the room into account.

My suite at Kempinski Guangzhou is definitely not the same thing like those dry, boring, and perhaps factory-designed Sheraton rooms. I would describe the suite as ‚Äì rich. Please allow me to use a metaphor here. Those factory-designed Sheraton rooms are like a piece of cheap sweet dessert: we eat it and all we can taste is a strong, monotonous, and perhaps disgusting sweetness. What distinguishes the dessert from Mandarin Oriental bakery from those cheap desserts is that we can get different layers of slightly different tastes and textures within a single bite of the MO cake. It is more or less how my suite at Kempinski Guangzhou is: the entire suite adopts the balanced and relaxing color match of wood and white, but we can clearly feel the different vibes in different sectors of the suite. The living corner is chill and adeptly spaced; the bedroom is enclosed, neat, and small thus radiates a strong sense of security; the kitchen‚Ä¶ my apologies, I never cook so have no idea how it really feels like working there. However, though the kitchen and the living corner have merely ten steps in between, the transformation of the atmosphere is dramatic. Therefore, I definitely enjoy the suite in this Kempinski ‚Äì so rich in texture but still harmonized as a whole. However, to be fair, even if it is not wrong to say that the design of the suites in Kempinski is interesting and deserves appreciation, it may not have much competitiveness in front of those hotels in the respected category. To illustrate it a bit: Kempinski‚Äôs suites can make me unconsciously say, ‚Äúoh, it looks nice.‚Äù Meanwhile, the rooms at Mandarin Oriental Guangzhou are adorable to the extent that I cannot control myself but sit down and appreciate every corner of the room for one good hour. However, having said that, I still want to emphasize that the suites at Kempinski Guangzhou are spaces extremely relaxing and comfortable to stay at.

msg:This time, some of the Trip recommendations were pushed into the trap! When searching for hotels in the past, I gave priority to Trip.com ranking recommendations. This time I went to Guangzhou with my family to visit friends. Since I haven‚Äôt been to Guangzhou for a while and I was not familiar with the hotels, I looked at Trip.com recommendations and chose Guangzhou. Hotel D'Anchor Kempinski, in addition to its recommendation, also has certain confidence in its brand.
Arriving at the hotel, it is located in the old area of ‚Äã‚ÄãYuexiu District. The environment is average, and there is a road construction project nearby, which makes it feel a bit messy. After checking into the hotel, the service was very good and friendly. I was very satisfied with the room. There was a big bathtub. My wife planned to buy some bath salts to soak in the spa when she went out to eat. It felt good.
But the nigh**are started slowly after I came back from dinner... After my wife took a bath, she planned to soak in the SPA. Who knew that the water purifier was broken? She could only add water but not drain it. In order to avoid flooding, and it was too late at the time, I had to Give up going to bed early.
But in the middle of the night, I heard people shouting in the building opposite from time to time. My wife couldn't sleep when she was affected. Later, when she went to the bathroom, she almost slipped and fell, and then I discovered that there was water in the toilet. I said it might be water leakage during the shower. I'll see you tomorrow morning. It was okay, so I had to continue sleeping.
At around 7 o'clock, there were screams from time to time, which also woke me up. I had to get up, but when I was going to go to the bathroom to freshen up, I found that half of the bathroom was flooded. I didn't know why, so I had to call the front desk to complain and find someone. Soon a waiter brought a towel and a squeegee to deal with the accumulated water. He was very satisfied with the waiter's attitude. However, for new hotels that have only been open for a few years, hotels with the Kempinski brand will have such problems. It was really unexpected. In addition, seeing the waiter's quick and skillful movements, I felt that this was not the first time that this happened. Why were the guests allowed to check in despite this problem?
Not long after the trea**ent, when the family members had finished washing up, they discovered that water was seeping out of the toilet floor again. It was probably a leak in the drain position of the shower room floor, which caused water to seep out from the floor. After a while, the toilet was flooded. üòì
In fact, it is not surprising that the sound insulation is poor and the toilets are flooded. However, for a 5-star brand hotel, the charges are not cheap, but it makes people feel like a 3-star hotel. It is really disappointing. I hope they will take good care of it. Review and reflect.
But for me, Kempinski, there is no next time‚Ä¶.

The heated swimming pool is good, which the children like. There is also an indoor hot spring, which you can try.
The restaurant tastes good, self-service ordering + buffet, and you can take away the food at the end, which is good.

The second time, the electric toilet was broken, and we came to see it in time, but it was broken and could not be repaired for a while.
The clothes drying rack in the Octonauts room was tied with socks left by the previous resident. It was not obvious, and the cleaning lady might not have noticed it.
The air conditioners in both rooms were blowing on the head. I hope the air outlet can be adjusted. The overall environment and service are still very good.

üß°The hotel is on Jianshe Liuma Road, near the Garden Hotel. It is not a conspicuous bag on the main road, but in the cross road, which is a bit inconspicuous. But the service is indeed five-star, which can be felt from the entrance.
üß°When checking in, you will be kindly informed that because it is near the subway, there are many cars, and there will be a bit of traffic noise at night. The room has earplugs and eye masks to help you fall asleep. I also upgraded the room type. The room card is very mini and cute, with Guangzhou and characteristic buildings written on it. I live on the 11th floor. The room has a living room, a dormitory area, and an island for dining. I think the layout is quite ok.
üß°If you are traveling to Guangzhou, you can choose it. The geographical location is close to Tianhe and Yuexiu. You can go to the gold panning nearby. After all, it is also a new hotel, and various hardware and software are relatively modern. It is still recommended.
üß°Breakfast is at De'an Pavilion on the 3rd floor of the hotel, from 7 to 10:30, semi-self-service. Some are ordered from the menu, and others are self-service. The overall product is OK.
üß°The gym and swimming pool are also on the 3rd floor, and you need to swipe your room card to enter. The swimming pool is heated, and there is also a bathing pool.
üß°The view of the hotel is a nearby residential building, which actually has a Guangzhou feel. The small items in the room are also very Cantonese, and a Guangzhou food map is thoughtfully prepared.

The subway construction next to the hotel didn't end until 2:30 in the evening. I measured the decibels and the hotel also thoughtfully prepared earplugs and eye masks for me to check out. The hotel found out that those who mind can only wait until the subway is repaired. The hotel upgraded us to a children's room. My daughter liked it very much. We only stayed for one night this time, so we reluctantly passed by. We can only hope that the subway will be repaired soon. Bar

You can hear the construction sound from the 18th floor, but fortunately it is not loud. The two-bedroom parent-child room only has a tent, a slide, and two dolls. There are no puzzles or anything like the ones on the promotional pictures. A hotel that costs thousands per night doesn't even have a welcome fruit, and there are no small gifts for the children. This shouldn't be the case. The large dining table in the living room has many stains, which are difficult to spot because it is black. You have to pick up the takeaway you ordered. There is no robot to deliver it, and there is no hotel staff to help deliver it. The butler service is not adequate. The two-bedroom apar**ent only provides breakfast for two people. If there are more people, you have to buy it separately. It costs 120 yuan each. There are not many kinds of breakfast, and it can only be said to be average. When I checked in, I had to pay a deposit of 1,500, probably to prevent guests from taking things they shouldn't. When I checked out, I asked for a child's doll. The hotel staff questioned why I wanted it from them when I had it in the room, and asked the cleaning staff to go there. Check, are you suspecting that I have bad eyesight or that I want more after taking it? In short, this service is a bit unaffordable at a price of more than 3,000 per night. The only thing I'm satisfied with is that the doorman service at the door is okay.

There was a lion dance performance in front of the hotel on New Year‚Äôs Day. The toiletries in the room are good, and there is a TV in front of the bathtub.

Second, the disadvantage is that the hygiene of the room needs to be further improved. The dust on the table and the lint in the air in the room are obvious. Breakfast is very average, the restaurant is small, there are few dishes, and you need to queue for a long time for Cantonese-style shrimp dumplings and chicken feet.
Third, the last thing is that when I checked in during the New Year's Eve, I didn't get any New Year's gifts, not even a fruit plate or even a small keychain, which was not very friendly.

After raising the issue, the maintenance staff came and said there was no problem. However, after comparing with other rooms, there was indeed a problem. The hotel's attitude was also very good. Changed to a family room.

The guest room space is not large, but the hard decoration workmanship is very meticulous, the soft furnishings are also of good quality, and the stability and speed of the elevator car are perfect!

The most important thing is that the service is in place. I accidentally forgot my laptop at that time. As a result, just 20 minutes after leaving the hotel, the hotel called me to verify, and finally the laptop was perfectly recovered. Evening service response time was prompt. The only regret is that the surrounding municipal roads are being built and the environment is a bit noisy. It should be fine in the future!

It is a good choice for business trips.

msg:A rare new hotel in the old town

Facilities: Standard five-star configuration, with charging piles in the ba*****t, basically everything
Hygiene: Basically up to standard, no star stains visible to the naked eye
Environment: Personally, I prefer the old city, but there are many private houses nearby and roads are being built. It may not be a good impression for tourists who are coming to Guangzhou for the first time or who are interested in the bright avenues like Zhucheng.
Service: There is not much sense of presence, but it is not bad. It is the first echelon in Guangzhou. There is no problem.
The Cantonese style breakfast for breakfast is really good, and there is also a menu, but the preparation is a bit over the top. It feels like it is made just for the sake of it.
To sum up, I think it is suitable for people who live in the suburbs of Guangzhou to come for a staycation. As a tourist hotel, location may be the biggest constraint.

The soundproofing of the hotel is good, but when you go out, you can enjoy the local food and feel very immersed in it. I especially recommend the buffet restaurant on the third floor, which is open at 7 o'clock and has a special menu, which is very different. The cart helped me. Special emphasis: Because of the excellent location, I can order takeaway from many Internet celebrity restaurants without having to queue up. I will definitely stay here next time I come to Guangzhou. I can already give it a 100-point rating.
Something you might mind: There is a construction site building a subway next to it, so it feels a bit messy, but it is fenced off, so it doesn‚Äôt have a big impact.

It wasn‚Äôt until I saw the room introduction on the hotel TV that I realized that the room type I was staying in was not big enough. It was not within the usual sales range. Then I tried to search for the hotel at other times. The room type I stayed in was always sold out. It was clear at a glance. This room type must be to cope with the last room during the peak period. Alas... more than 2,600 It‚Äôs hard to say enough to stay in such a room at such a price, and I‚Äôve completely lost my good impression of Kempinski.

The children do not want to go out after playing in the hotel. Even now, they often say that Kempinski is great. It‚Äôs so fun! Every time we go out and come back, we never say that there is no one at the door. They always open the door for us and ask if we have any luggage that we need help with. The service attitude at the front desk is also incredibly good, patient, attentive and loving. Before I arrived at the hotel, I called the front desk to ask for help to collect a courier, but the courier boy put it in the courier cabinet. In the evening, the front desk took the initiative to call to inquire about the courier status, worrying that it had not been delivered. He was very responsible. I also gave a small gift on New Year's Eve, which was warm and thoughtful. In the words of my baby, I will stay at this hotel next time I go to Guangzhou. Finally, there is a suggestion. The breakfast standard and the service quality of the stalls need to be improved. Now it has lowered the quality of the hotel.

2. The attitude of the front desk staff was very bad. One point was given to the young man who helped with check-out. What age was it? When I wanted to check-out, I was shouted at "Come here and line up."
3. Later I learned that I still need to pay a deposit of 3,000 to check in... I don‚Äôt find many hotels in China that require a deposit...

In addition, the bathtub is comparable to a small fish tank in a Japanese hotel.

msg:Collision of Guangzhou Kempinski German style and Lingnan characteristics
This time I stayed in the Yayi one-bedroom suite. I didn‚Äôt live in a new hotel. The only Kempinski in Guangzhou opened in 21 years. The hotel is an apar**ent hotel.
advantage
The room is very large, about 80 square meters, just like living at home, without the strangeness of a hotel, the activity line is very reasonable, equipped with smart horses
The TV in the bathtub is pretty good. You can lie down and watch TV while soaking in the bath, drink a little wine, and sleep soundly at night. Although the subway is being repaired, it is not very noisy, which is acceptable. The bathrobe is my favorite, and Like JW Marriott's bathrobe, the velvet fabric inside is very comfortable. The tea bags are from Singapore TWG, no miscellaneous brands are perfunctory
Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, it is produced online, and everything tastes good. It does not lose quality control for the sake of looking rich. This is better than Marriott hotels, and there is also an a la carte menu.
shortcoming
The hair dryer is very average and can be upgraded. It would be nice if the suite can be equipped with a Dyson as standard. The toiletries can be upgraded, and there are no big brands. This may be improved compared with other hotels of the same type.
The shower in the bathroom of my room was loose and couldn‚Äôt be hung. The shower fell off several times while taking a shower. It was very inconvenient. I hope more maintenance is done. This is also a detail.
Alcoholic liquids cannot be checked in on the plane. There are many mosquitoes in Guangzhou, so you can mark them
With toilet water, this enhances the sense of experience, which is very considerate for tourism parties and business trip parties.
The last sentence! The hotel is very close to the ceiling of Guangdong Cantonese cuisine, the Cantonese cuisine chef Whampoa Military Academy Lee Garden Restaurant, less than 100 meters away, it is really great for foodies

The subway is under construction near the hotel, but the hotel's sound insulation facilities are great, and there is no noise at all. Our room also has a big balcony. It is very artistic to see the night view at night, and you can also dry clothes during the day, which is great!
There are also a lot of delicacies in the nearby alleys. Takeaway is very convenient and can be placed in the takeaway box. However, one of our takeaways was locked in the takeaway cabinet because of the delivery boy's problem, and the takeaway merchants did not deal with it.
The hotel is quite close to Beiyuan and Beijing Road, a few bus stops away

She was probably the front office manager. This time, I chose the Liyue room of 43, probably because it was a little yellow duck themed room before. I feel that the room space is very small this time. But the overall soft service is still in place. The fudge for breakfast was delicious, as were the baked chocolate buns. There is construction around, and it has been arranged to a higher floor. Relatively construction noise is still acceptable. The room is also helpful, and a Bluetooth speaker is prepared, which is very good.

I came back in the evening and asked the manager before he finally called me back. In short, he said he was sorry and the compensation offer was a breakfast. Of course he didn't accept it. I had no choice but to stay another night and received no follow-up feedback.

Back at the hotel on the second night, I was delighted to see that the exterior wall was lit up for a special photo shoot.

The room is big and new with a balcony outside. The hotel should be in the old district, surrounded by residential buildings. There are also shopping malls, garden hotels, Guangzhou restaurants, and Diandude nearby. It is very convenient to have morning tea. The hotel's facilities are very simple, just the restaurant and gym, and the food delivery ends at 21 o'clock in the evening. For night owls, they can only order takeaway. This is the first time staying at Kempinski, I think I will continue to choose this brand in the future~

I am a man and I used the skin care wipes. Then the hotel gave me three more sets. Hahahaha. It was the first time I experienced the joy of wool. I haven‚Äôt brought anything with me from the hotel for a long time. Friends here in Yuexiu can really try the Alex service at the concierge. It‚Äôs also very comfortable and the luggage is light. The image of "take it easy" is not bad. In fact, the overall experience is really good. The price-performance ratio is really high. The price of similar competing Mandarin apar**ents is twice that of the Rosewood apar**ent. It is incomparable to the W apar**ent in the same price range. It is really good except for the fireworks in the lobby. There is no other problem with being overweight. It is a benefit that Kempinski has done poorly in domestic marketing. It is really a super benefit.

msg:As hotel lovers
This is the first time I really want to write these comments
The experience of staying at Kempinski this time can be said to be very bad!
This trip is two big and one small, originally planned to stay in Rosewood Mansion!
Amway, who read Xiaohongshu, said that the service attitude and all aspects of this store are very good
So I want to say give it a try. . The result was really thunderous! ! !

1: The price booked half a month in advance was 600+ higher than the price of the day. I checked in and communicated with the waiter that my reservation amount is enough to live in a suite and I hope to change to a larger room type. It‚Äôs a bit bigger because the amount I paid is right there. In the end, I was arranged to go to the back of the standard room. I refused to say that it was unreasonable to deal with it... It took about 20 minutes to check in. The efficiency can be said to be very slow

2: The door of the hotel feels old and has abnormal noises, both the toilet/wardrobe door and the room door. . .

3: The air conditioner is leaking. . All the supplies on the bar counter were wet. I was really speechless. I called someone from the engineering depar**ent to fix it. They said that the ceiling pipe was blocked, and the cleaner was sent to wipe it with a rag. The whole experience felt like I was living in a Samsung apar**ent. . It feels very casual. Afterwards, there was no call from the front desk to apologize and explain the incident.

4: The attitude of the breakfast waiter was very bad. He asked me if the noodle soup was mine. I asked four times before responding, and said impatiently, "Yes, the distance between us was less than 30cm at that time." . impossible not to hear

5: The room depar**ent called twice but no one answered... I went to the front desk to get it done. Why is there a so-called five-star hotel that can make the service like this? ?

6: Maybe the curtains have not been swept since the opening.. The dust on the whole head of the child walking by is just too scary. The hygiene is worrying. When you check in, there are hairs on everything on the sofa.

There are still many speechless moments and I don‚Äôt want to list them. I really don‚Äôt understand how those good reviews come from, especially those who are young and can clear mines. There are no facilities suitable for parents and children... If the hotel wants to provide long-term service, it is fundamental, otherwise the food looks too ugly. Come on! Absolutely no turning back series

However, there is still a lot of infrastructure construction in the surrounding area, which is quite noisy. The facilities in the room are average. I guess they are trying to make it feel more like a home. However, I personally feel that the sink and kitchen utensils are not practical and are in the way. The toilets are not clearly marked. It is estimated that older people will have to figure it out for a while. The elevator is not sensitive when swiping the room card.

msg:This hotel will definitely not stay again. Truthful evaluation for your reference. Let‚Äôs talk about the desirable places first! 1. The location is in the city center, there are small supermarkets and restaurants nearby, but the surrounding area is old and dilapidated. The surrounding area is noisy and noisy due to subway and road construction. When I checked in on the first day at night, it was 10 o'clock at night, and the sound of impact was still under construction. Because the construction was occupying the road, there was a traffic jam in and out. It is estimated that it will be relieved after the repair is completed. Visually, it has not been a year I can't do it half a load! 2. The check-in speed is relatively fast. I booked a childlike parent-child two-bedroom suite, four adults and two children, but each room only has two breakfasts. I plan to add breakfast to each room. The girl who checked in is very considerate Reminder that you can combine two breakfasts into one day, and you can often have local morning tea on the other day. This girl is really a rare caring person I met during the entire hotel stay! 3. The room is relatively new, and there is an open kitchen in the living room (you can‚Äôt cook without tableware, and I haven‚Äôt asked the front desk if tableware can be provided). There is a simple layout with a dining table and children (you can refer to the official map of the hotel, there is no difference between the picture and the real scene ). 4. The concierge brother was very enthusiastic when he entered and exited several times, he took the initiative to open the door, and answered any questions enthusiastically! Next is slot 1. Refrigerator drinks are not replenished the next day after drinking. 2. There are two extra beds. The boss of the first waiter who came in to add an extra bed was unhappy. The boss looked unhappy. Is it because I think I‚Äôm poor and shouldn‚Äôt have an extra bed? (The second one who came in was very enthusiastic. He responded to every request, and the husband refused to accept the tip again and again.) 3. There is a restaurant outsourced by the hotel on the second floor, which was recommended by the doorman. We thought it was good for lunch, and we plan to go there in the evening eat. If you call the restaurant, you have to wait in line, and you can only pick up the number on the spot if you don‚Äôt accept phone calls and mobile phones, so you call the hotel on the way back to the hotel in order to let the children eat as soon as possible. A lady in the guest service center who claimed to be surnamed He answered the phone! I said that I still have 20 minutes to go back to the hotel, and I am afraid that I will have to wait too long when I arrive at the restaurant. Can I ask her to help me get a number (it is on the second floor of the hotel, one minute past the lobby) and tell the restaurant that this is a hotel guest Give me a number first! She told me coldly that the upstairs restaurant was outsourced, and I emphasized again that I knew it was outsourced, but because the same hotel could help me get a number, she still replied coldly: She does not have a phone number for the upstairs restaurant! In fact, I know this is not my job, but anyone with a little sense of service will not deal with it like this! As a guest of mine, I can find the phone number of the restaurant upstairs in your hotel from Dianping. You said you didn‚Äôt have one. It sounds like you don‚Äôt even bother to be perfunctory! No empathy at all! I believe that in other hotels, at least I will ask you or I will try it for you. Even if it is a lie, at least I will not refuse it. I am too lazy to go to this. Your salary is too comfortable! 4. After returning from breakfast on the 9th, the family waited for the elevator. They pressed the elevator button and an elevator came. An old cleaning lady knew that we pressed the elevator and saw us and our children going into the elevator. , deliberately dawdling and rubbing one side of the door frame with her body, and when we avoided her and planned to enter the elevator from the other side, she deliberately blocked the elevator door again and slowly wiped the buttons inside. I really can‚Äôt stand it anymore After I said something to her, I saw that she also walked out with a face of indifference, which is simply outrageous, ****? The hotel can check and monitor my description to see if I have any fiction! With the dignity of this old aunt, you can verify it yourself! Anyway, after these two days, I planned to stay in Chimelong for four days and come back, but now I decided to change the hotel!

The lobby manager arranged for us to rest in the restaurant on the third floor, and arranged for us to have coffee and refreshments. Thank you very much. It is worth mentioning that the service of the staff in the restaurant is very good, the coffee and tea are also delicious, and the environment is very quiet, which eliminates the troubles of the journey. The room is large, with a reasonable layout and a certain design feature. After a day of play, you can come back to the room to drink tea and have a rest. You really feel at home and feel very happy. There are many distinctive restaurants around the hotel, which can meet the needs of different taste buds. There are authentic Cantonese snacks and Cantonese cuisine, and there are also unique petty bourgeoisie light luxury restaurants. The hotel's breakfast is also a highlight. The Chinese and various Western dishes are very authentic, especially the desserts of various flavors. They are super delicious. The overall quality of the hotel staff is high. This trip to Guangzhou gave me the best mood. Hotel, thank you, I will choose to stay here next time I come to Guangzhou

msg:This is the first time I take the initiative to write a review for a hotel on Ctrip. This Kempinski Hotel in Guangzhou is really good! I had already booked the Jumeirah Hotel Guangzhou. After reading the reviews, I found that this Kempinski has a good score. Compared with Jumeirah, it is closer to the old city. It is more convenient to eat and go shopping around. The most important thing is that the price is relatively affordable. 2000 For less than the price (Spring Festival holiday), you can live in a suite with one bedroom and one living room (very suitable for families traveling with children), so I decided to return Jumeirah and book this hotel.
Facts have proved that this decision is very wise. On the plane back to Shanghai, we all agreed that the Kempinski Hotel has added a lot to this trip to Guangzhou. Of course, our room hardware is very new and the facilities are very good, but this is not the most important thing. , From the concierge at the front desk, Check in, room cleaning and other services, we really experienced a "home away from home" feeling, which is something that we have rarely felt in so many hotels (including many international five-star brands) over the years , so I came here to call the hotel, keep going!

It‚Äôs in the old town, next to the one-Michelin-starred Lee Garden Restaurant, and nearby is Dian Du De, which is famous for its dim sum. The food can be said to be very good. The environment is also very quiet, suitable for a family to take a leisurely vacation. The girl in red at the front desk and the little brothers are also very professional and polite. I like it. Jessie is also very professional in handling problems when checking out, and the service is very good. The only point is that Panhaligon, who was looking at the hotel's spare parts before, did not know why they changed to some miscellaneous brands this time, the quality is so-so.

The breakfast is very high-quality, all the service staff are very kind, and the professionalism is very high. I was very disappointed that I didn't get the rabbit sister in the lottery at the front desk. The beautiful sister gave a special gift to the little princess. happy. When I checked out, my brother couldn‚Äôt find the watch, so he searched the room all over. Later, he asked for help from the hotel and found that he had lost it in the restaurant. He felt a lot when he got it. It‚Äôs a pity that it‚Äôs located in the surrounding old town, and it‚Äôs still under repair. On the road, it is not very convenient to enter and exit, and there is no German beer bar with other Kempinski.

Smart toilet, large refrigerator, small kitchen, you can make a la carte by yourself. The disadvantage is that there is a residential building outside the window. The 1.8-meter bed is actually not that big, and the bed is relatively hard. It belongs to the old city, and those who like the taste of Laoguang can choose to live. There is a Luhu Park and a golf course nearby.

The front desk can also draw candy figures and make balloons, and the mood was instantly super good. . The breakfast is also very rich. It is a full buffet. It is not the semi-buffet and half-a-la-carte mode as mentioned in the previous comments. It may be that people are too busy on the National Day. If there is still a chance to come to Guangzhou, I will choose this place.

msg:üè® Kempinski Apar**ent Hotel, a five-star hotel, the service must not be said. Get out of the car to get your luggage, go out to help open the door, be on call, and respond to your needs.

üìçThe geographical location is also excellent, it is convenient to go anywhere, and it can be done within 20 yuan by taxi.

There are a lot of food nearby, the first floor is a Japanese food store, the second floor is a Chaoshan food, you can find it on the reviews.

üè™ There are convenience store Family Mart and 7-11, fruit store Baiguoyuan and McDonald's within 100 meters. There are also many nearby Hong Kong-style restaurants and Cantonese restaurants (including Lee Gardens), as well as a local restaurant recommended by the locals (it is said to be an old couple's 40-year-old store that opens occasionally every afternoon).

The hotel helped arrange a higher floor with a good view. If the weather is good, when you wake up in the morning, you can see a whole piece of blue sky and white clouds, which makes you feel good.

The layout of the serviced apar**ent is what I like. There is a bar at the entrance of the room, which is convenient for dining. Then there is a small living room with sofa, table and chairs and TV üì∫. Then there is a large bed on one side, with a good view from the window. The bed and living room can be separated by a folding door. The toilet has a shower bathtub üõÅ and a smart toilet. There is also a full-length mirror at the door.

Fully equipped, refrigerator, washing machine, oven, induction cooker, coffee machine, kettle, etc. Also, drinks in the fridge are free and will be replenished daily. This is the first time I encountered a hotel room with so much mineral water, I don't need to ask the front desk to add it.

There is a gym, swimming pool and dining area on the third floor of the hotel. The breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western, and the variety is complete. But there is not much to eat, and it is not very cost-effective to buy it alone.

The only downside is that napkins and trash cans are only available in toilets and desks, and it is relatively inconvenient to have no living room and bar.

msg:I have stayed here many times and this time I was really dissatisfied.
Facilities: There is always a strange noise from the glass side of the room. It is quite loud, about once every few minutes. It is very annoying.

Hygiene: As soon as I entered the room, there were two band-aids under the curtain next to the bed. Looking from a distance, I thought they were TT and I felt very bad.
Environment: Takeout cannot be delivered upstairs, and there are no robots. The takeout rack downstairs is a mess.

Service: Ordered ice cubes to the room around 11:30. After waiting for a while, a bottle of water was brought over. I said I wanted ice. Bring the ice. The point is that the waiter knocked on the door at 5:00 in the morning and I said, what are you doing? He said I want water! A wrong order bothered me endlessly. The key is 5 o'clock in the morning... It's terrible. No one apologized afterwards. The front desk service is also average.
I originally thought it was convenient because there was a road at the door. It is not convenient to drive or take a taxi. Five-star apar**ents are really incomparable to Jumeirah and W. So sad.

The hotel seems to be in a residential area / downtown, but the room is very quiet, there are too many delicious restaurants around, which is very convenient. You can also pack desserts and snacks to eat at the bar.

Transportation: It takes 10 minutes to get to the nearest subway station, and it takes a while to walk. Sometimes the sun is too hot to suffer.

Service: The little brother ray at the front desk is very nice (should be this name), check-in and check-out are very efficient, and according to my remarks, he chose a room with a better view and not facing the school. The next day, I left a note for cleaning the room. I wanted more capsule coffee and added a trash can in the kitchen. They also helped me put it away very thoughtfully.


Hygiene: The room is very clean, and the table in the living room is shiny and reflective. There was a little hair on the floor that was a fly in the oin**ent. I told the hotel and arranged for someone to suck the floor again as soon as possible.


Environment: Very quiet, I like the curtains, they open automatically as soon as people come in, and the microwave is super convenient.

The surrounding environment is still very characteristic of Guangzhou, and there are many famous landmarks. The hotel is also newly opened, and the overall is relatively new. The combination of Chinese-style decoration style and modern and fashionable elements looks pretty good. However, what is worth mentioning about this trip is their service attitude. From the time of check-in, they have been very patient to communicate with us. In addition, we missed the normal breakfast time early the next morning because we remembered the wrong time. The staff also served us very patiently. First, Zoey and Jimmy at the front desk of the restaurant greeted us politely, and then provided us with a take-away breakfast. When we wanted to eat in the restaurant, they also Instead of rejecting us, they welcomed us to sit down. Jimmy and Sweeney also prepared tea and more breakfast for us. Jimmy and the kitchen staff also specially prepared one of their hotel's breakfast features for us - smoked salmon eggs Benedict , I have to say, the taste is really pretty good, it is the first time I have eaten it so many times. Many thanks for their service. All in all, this experience is still very good, and if you have the opportunity, you can go to other places and stay in their brand again.

I accidentally found that the hotel's parent-child suite was very eye-catching, so I quickly booked a night to experience it with my baby. First of all, the location of the hotel is very golden, the bus and subway are very convenient, and there are many restaurants around. It is only a few minutes walk from Poly Central, so you can get all the activities in Central. Secondly, the check-in and check-out services in the lobby are very warm and in place, especially on Saturday when I met Tommy, the manager on duty that day, who was very considerate. When meeting our guests with babies, he would provide further assistance if needed. It is worth mentioning that, due to my carelessness, after checking out the hotel and arriving home, suddenly the child's phone and watch were forgotten in the room. Tommy also took the initiative to help find it. Thank you very much, this may be the feeling of being at home. Finally, the facilities and design in the room are very considerate, especially some details are especially friendly to those with children. Next time you have enough time, you must come back to the hotel again to check in again. BTW, the hotel swimming pool is very good, and the privacy is also very good. I didn't have time to experience it this time, just took a quick look. Change the room type next time and try again.

Let's talk about a little bad, 1) There is a live broadcast in the next room, when there is no sound in the corridor or room.

Therefore, if other rooms eat food with a strong smell and turn on the range hood, the smell will be disgusting, and the smell of other rooms will enter the room.
Environment: Gym and swimming pool are good. If you are a guest, you will not be given a hand card when you enter the pool, and then you will not know where to put your room card when you are swimming.
The gym basically meets the needs. good.

One more thing I don't know where to do laundry? There is no laundry room. Because I used to live in suites with washing machines, and I don't actually need laundry services for my clothes, so this is inconvenient.

Later, I asked what solution would be available to us, and the answer was that we would get a free room upgrade next time we come to the store? Haha, is there really a next time? During the process, they repeatedly emphasized to me that all five-star hotels are like this and the equipment used is imported from abroad. Who has never stayed in a five-star hotel? Having stayed in so many five-star hotels, this is the first time I have encountered such a speechless thing, which ruins my mood!

msg:I have always wanted to stay at the Kempinski Hotel, and finally opened one in Guangzhou. Although the hotel occupies a small area, the planning is quite good. The overall look is a post-modern luxury hotel. The garage has a Tesla supercharged, and the lobby The layout is exquisite, the front desk staff are warm and polite, and clear instructions are given for check-in and check-out (after all, this is the first time I stayed here), the design of the room passage is not vulgar, and there is no sense of depression; the room lighting is very suitable for me, and the light temperature is just right. Clear every corner of the room, the light reflected on the items is warm and comfortable, the room is absolutely suitable for the activity space of 4 people, and it is not crowded. The breakfast quality is Western-style and semi-buffet-style. Although there are not many varieties, it is enough to meet the various needs of taste buds. Thanks to the service of Jay/Zoey/Sweeney/Jimmy in the restaurant.

msg:Before booking the hotel, I checked the information and found that it opened in 2020. I thought the new hotel would be very good. I didn't expect that after I moved in, I found that many places were disappointing.
There are not many kinds of breakfast, only Western style, basically no Chinese style. Even dishes such as eggs have to be asked by the staff before they are given to you. I don't understand why they are not displayed.
I was in a hurry when I checked out. After two days, I remembered that there was no invoice, and I called the front desk, but the staff said that it was my own reason, so I had to pay for the express delivery. Ask why you can't issue an electronic invoice, and you can't give a reason. It's hard to understand that a 5-star hotel would have such a service.
Because of frequent business trips, I was also in the OTA travel industry on Ctrip before, and I stayed in many domestic and foreign hotels. This Kempinski in Guangzhou is indeed a bit disappointing. I will not choose it again in the future, nor will my colleagues from ByteDance come here. Guangzhou travel choice.

The service staff encountered throughout the process are very sincere, very caring, and can take into account all aspects of customers.
I was most impressed by the waiters who provided breakfast in the hotel. Because I went to Guangzhou for a medical examination on the first day, I might not be able to catch up with the breakfast, so my friends who accompanied me asked the waiter if they could extend the breakfast time, which surprised me. It was a few very considerate people who helped me so that I could finally have breakfast when I got back to the hotel late. During the meal the next day, I just mentioned that I wanted to eat salmon, and the waiter who passed by heard it and brought it to me directly, even though it was not in the buffet that day. Thank you very much to the people mentioned in the pictures below, you have impressed me with my stay experience this time, and I hope to stay at the Kempinski Hotel next time I have the opportunity! !

msg:The first Kempinski in Guangzhou is a surprise overall. Both the lobby layout and the intelligent effect of the elevator will make a good first impression. Because it is a new hotel, the electricity, smart toilet and various hardware that should be in the room are in line with the usage habits. The wardrobe design is interesting, but it‚Äôs a bit laborious to open and close... I live in a one-bedroom apar**ent, and the space has the compactness of a modern apar**ent, but I think it‚Äôs quite appropriate. The accessories are my favorite European brands, which are in line with the hotel‚Äôs youthful tone.
Having a terrace is a big surprise! The husband can smoke cigars on the terrace at night.
The Guangzhou-themed sticky notes and some anti-epidemic supplies are also very detailed.
Public facilities: The swimming pool is very comfortable and the temperature is pleasant. The water quality is good. The gym is very large and well equipped. The equipment in the shower room is the same as that in the room, which is quite a**ospheric.
Say something regretful. The holiday package I bought included executive benefits, but the hotel was informed the day before departure that it was canceled because the hotel wanted to adjust the menu of the afternoon tea in the executive lounge...btw is not the lounge decoration or something, the breakfast the next day is as usual, that is, I was suddenly cancelled. Ah, this... Actually, I bought the set meal because I could eat and drink from the afternoon to the evening. Later, through various back and forth communication with Ctrip, the room type was upgraded and the red wine compote was given, but in fact, it was different from my vision-not for eating and drinking, but for the original intention to have different event scenes, which is more like Vacation... (Life has been so difficult, so I don't want to play more).
Thank you Ctrip for coordinating with the hotel's compensation measures. Next time you want to change the menu and cancel the experience item, you can tell when you make a reservation instead of 18 hours before check-in.

üîîService: The front desk is more enthusiastic. Continued to send me the keys, and also gave me a late check-out.

The hotel is cost-effective. The house at this price also has a kitchen. The area is relatively large at 60 square meters. It is already a hotel apar**ent. It is more convenient for families and businesses to stay for a week. There are also many delicious food nearby, from the streets to high-end restaurants.
This time I feel a little lacking is that the pillow is not very own. Either it is too soft or too flat and too hard, and the neck will be uncomfortable the next day. The facilities in the hotel are relatively new, the gym equipment is quite complete, and there is also a heated swimming pool. If you feel like traveling by yourself, it is recommended to relax on weekends.

msg:I won't talk about it in general, let's talk about the details of the hotel
1. It was my birthday on the day of check-in, and I upgraded to a one-bedroom. As soon as I entered the door, I saw that snacks were delivered. I simply arranged it, which is great! Use your heart!
2. The lady at the front desk is gentle and service-minded. One thing is that she has to collect a deposit. When I made a reservation, I called 3 times without telling me, and suddenly told me that the deposit was 1500. I was scared, but in the end I was very happy and quickly resolved.
3, Intelligent hidden floor elevator, this is great, the door card is very chic, small. It's cute for girls.
4. The house has double balconies and a smoking area. This is great. It's too friendly for someone like me who cares about the smell of smoke. Like üëç
5. Equipped with a large refrigerator and an induction cooker, and finally found out that there is also a microwave oven. It's silly. The takeaway is cold. I don't know if there is a microwave oven to heat it.
4. There are 6 cups, juice cups, red wine glasses, foreign wine glasses, everything is available, and the cups are super clean, you can't see any flaws, it's amazing
5. The floor is super clean. You can walk barefoot and pick up and eat chicken wings if you drop them (hahahaha, exaggerated). Walking between the floor and the carpet is a super reassuring feeling. Other hygiene is also super good, and the toilet The ceiling flusher is awesome, and the toilet is also a smart toilet that can flush.
6. Surprisingly and intimately, there is a hair remover in the wardrobe. I just wore a fur coat and the black skirt was covered with fur. It was a great relief.
Overall, it's really amazing, so convenient, and so much love. The new hotel is incense
Oh yes, thanks for the birthday card prepared by the hotel!
The bathtub is also great

1. The internet in the room is terrible. The wifi connection is so bad that it takes more than ten seconds to open an app and it‚Äôs almost impossible to watch a movie or video. So during the few days I lived here, my 4g data was used up for an unprecedented time, and finally I could only buy data. Bag. Of course, I called the staff to deal with it during the period, and the staff did their best, but the effect of wifi is really sorry for the grade and positioning of the hotel.

2. When I ordered Ctrip, I saw that there was a free model X that could be sent to several locations around the page. After I arrived at the store, I called and was told that the event had been cancelled.

3. The hotel staff in charge of welcoming guests and opening the door seems to be in a state of affairs. I don't know to help me lift a little when I get on the bus with so much luggage.

4. There are stoves in every room, but pots, etc. are not provided. The first time I called and wanted a small milk pot hot milk, the staff seemed reluctant, and then discovered that we had lived for a long time before providing a small pot.

5. In the 2110 room I stayed in, two of them basically didn't sleep at night, because the 2109 guests next door (about 3 or 4 people) were drinking and having a party, and the noise continued until 1 or 2 in the evening, and it was useless to call the front desk. , During the period there were several times to play 110. The front desk just said to help remind, and then never followed the situation, in fact, the noise continued for a long time before it quieted down.

The location of the hotel is not bad, it is very convenient for eating and shopping around.

After reading the reviews, the score is very good.

The design style of the hotel is a fusion of Chinese and Western elements. The quality is very good, the lobby is simple and elegant, and the hotel service personnel are of high quality.
The room card is very special. You can see the quality and technology of the new hotel when you enter the elevator. There is no floor display, and the room card is swiped to the display floor, which protects the privacy of customers.
Entering the room-the level of intelligence is very high. The moment the door is opened, the room is activated, the curtains are automatically opened, and various power sources are automatically turned on. This experience is good, and there is no need for cumbersome things like taking a power card.

The layout of the room is very good, as soon as you enter the door is a large dining bar, I bought something at that time, I put it down easily~~
The room is a design of one file and one hall, the bed and sofa have a foldable door, the space is small and the design has a certain degree of independence, which is very good.
The gym facilities are complete, basically enough, and there are also supporting facilities for swimming.
Simple and comfortable~

The location of the hotel is still very convenient. It takes about 20 minutes to go to Zhujiang New Town. It is OK to go there. I personally like it here. New hotels in the old district can be integrated with the down-to-earth culture of Guangzhou city when you go out. middle.
People who often surpass major cities on the go, occasionally can feel the urban a**osphere of Guangzhou when they are free, and have a hot rice roll.

Finally, I would like to thank the hotel service staff Carmen, who helped me with a lot of services when I left the store, and delivered the invoices. Thank you very much for having such a caring hotel service staff.

A recommended hotel.

1: In the room shopping bag, there is a pair of ultra-light carbon board running shoes. When I mentioned the entrance of the hotel, one of the straps was broken. After walking for a while, the other strap was broken. Now the fading of the paper tape dyes my running vest. Use with caution.
2: Check in near the early morning last night, and after running the next day, I want to get a good night's sleep. Contact the front desk and want to check out late and inform you that you can‚Äôt charge half the day‚Äôs room charge. I suggest that you can express that today‚Äôs occupancy rate is relatively high, so you can only postpone it. At 2 o'clock, it will feel much better in this way;
3: The hotel's price/performance ratio is indeed very high

Many electrical appliances are of Bosch brand. From the design, decoration, to the furniture, we can see that the owner of the hotel is very demanding, and the money is not little spent. (The most surprising thing is that the towel bar can be heated, you can see how much attention to detail.) The staff at the front desk, Mavis Max, not only has good service, sweet sound, and beautiful people. Talk to the guests, polite, and feel like going home. There is also a lot of food around the hotel, and shopping is also convenient. Living here is a good choice.

I didn't choose an apar**ent-style hotel, but the experience this time was amazing. Guangzhou elements are well reflected on the room card and sticky notes! My only regret is that I want to borrow the HDMI cable, but I was told that the IT depar**ent does not work on weekends, so no, and the drain of the bathtub does not fit tightly.

Apar**ent hotel | Small footprint | Convenient transportation | Unique
‚≠ïÔ∏èThe accommodation type is Yayue two-bedroom 56-70m¬≤ divided into living room, bedroom, bathroom, balcony, and open kitchen. There is a balcony in the living room of the room, and you can smoke outside the balcony, but the scenery outside the window is not much to see.

‚≠ïÔ∏èEquipped with refrigerator, oven, washing machine, TV, iron, coffee machine, safe, heated towel rail, etc. The most special is the oven and washing machine, which also reflects the apar**ent-style concept
‚≠ïÔ∏èThe hotel is equipped with a swimming pool, gym and restaurant. The restaurant has a good a**osphere. The breakfast is said to be semi-buffet and there are more pasta and egg products. The style of the dishes is average and needs to be improved.
Environmental configuration review score ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

üíÅHotel Service:
Overall I have no idea about hotel services
The door will be opened by welcoming guests, and the temperature measurement fully reflects the importance of epidemic prevention[Âº∫]
However, there will be no greet to check in at the front desk. The check-in attitude at the front desk is not bad. The upgrade of the room type adds to the cost.
I feel that the response speed is relatively slow for room service, and there is no uniform voice when calling the service center, which is a bit casual.
As a five-star hotel, the service is completely substandard. Hope it can be improved

ü§îGenerally speaking, the main configuration is to improve the hotel's grade. The hotel is very new and some warm configurations are good, such as a heated towel rail and a bright mode a**osphere switch. I hope I will go again next time and the service will be improved.
The cultural history of the brand is still very good

The decoration style of the hotel is what I like, and the home facilities in the room are equipped with big brands of smart appliances. It feels very intimate and very user-friendly (for example, the towel rack in the bathroom has a heating function, and you can wrap it after a shower. The large warm towel is very useful for families with children; the toilet is also smart;......); the sheets, quilts, etc. used in the room are all of good quality.

Overall, the service attitude and settings are very good, especially the security at the door and the cleaning lady on the floor where I live. Room service on the phone is polite and thoughtful. The only fly in the oin**ent is that one of the elevators may be broken, and the card can‚Äôt show the floor I‚Äôm going to. This makes me a little panicked as a first-timer, and I wonder if I‚Äôm in a big town. I didn‚Äôt take another elevator until I went back to the hotel at night. I saw that the floor will be displayed... and the door card has been dropped many times, but the door cannot be opened. After calling the hotel to inform the room, the auntie in the room quickly came to help open it, but this episode also made me a little embarrassed. I wonder if I don't know how to open the door. I hope that the hotel will pay attention to it and improve it. After all, if I have the opportunity, I would like to bring my mother to experience it again. I hope that I will not encounter it again when I stay next time.

msg:The sanitation and decoration of the room are ok, the space is large, and the facilities are complete. There are single-door refrigerators on the upper and lower floors, an oven, a living room, wine glasses, tea cups, beverage quilts, coffee cups, and cooking tables. Equipped with a capsule coffee machine and imported tea bags, soda water, and mineral water. The bathtub is equipped with TV, bath salts, bath towels, and the bathroom is equipped with mouthwash, alcohol-free hand sanitizer, and body lotion. Mouthwash is too irritating to the mouth, and the inner wall of the mouth is hot after use. Shampoo, shower gel and conditioner are local brands in Guangzhou.
There will be a concierge to help open the door from the moment you enter the door. It is very hard to stand outside on a hot day.
There are subways around, one-way streets are prone to traffic jams, and there is a little noise, but the front desk has explained it in advance when checking in, and it is acceptable.
It's very convenient to eat, restaurants, restaurants, night snacks and convenience stores are very close and complete.
There is a gym and a swimming pool, which are very clean, with a lot of fitness equipment and three lifeguards. My husband and I bought swimsuits to experience it hahaha.
Three suggestions:
‚ë†It is very inconvenient to go downstairs to get the takeaway by yourself outside the gate. It was originally because the weather was hot and I didn‚Äôt want to go out. Later, when I came from other places and got sick, I ordered the medicine and had to go downstairs to get the medicine. The room rate of such a big hotel is such a price. Fully equipped with food delivery robots;
‚ë°The wooden comb provided in the room was uneven, and a wooden thorn was stuck in the hand, which was very painful, and it took a long time to pick it out;
‚ë¢The service at the front desk is a bit anticlimactic. When you enter the store, the service is very enthusiastic and the process is very standardized. Although you are very polite when you check out, the process is useless and can only be called routine. If you need to issue an invoice, please write your email address, and the remaining room fee will be refunded to the original route. Then there is no more. I have stayed in many hotels with different prices. When checking out, many hotels will ask more about the check-in experience, do you have any good suggestions, and send two bottles of mineral water, small biscuits, and a small manual fan on hot days. Waiting for customized gifts for customers, in fact, the cost is nothing compared to the room rate of more than 1,000 a night, let alone we stayed for four or five daysüòÇ

msg:Bringing children to check in on Children's Day, book cakes in advance, the hotel helps to receive cold storage, which is very good üëçüèªThe hotel staff are also very kind, but the room card given on the day of check-in cannot be recognized when entering the elevator, and they take a pile of luggage out of the elevator to change rooms Card... If possible, I hope to avoid such things as needing to change the room card! The rooms are clean and warm, as advertised, suitable for parents and children.
