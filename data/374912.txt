We would have a happy hour at the lobby every day with sparkling wine and some finger food, and the room was completely controlled by an IPad, which was very nice. Room service was excellent ; served with quality and care. We would recommend it to anyone looking for spacious place near Xintiandi.

msg:Selected the hotel as a trip.com diamond member and was offered to be given the benefit of accessing the hotel lounge which turned out to be a disappointment as the so called happy hour had nothing much except a couple of plates of snacks and some drinks. The lounge service is pretty ordinary, staff there were kind of so bored standing round. This is a total gimmick from both the hotel and Trip.com . However, the breakfast was good with a nice range of selections and decent service. Overall, the hotel amenities are starting to look dated and tired and the pool was tiny with the surrounding facilities look also a bit shabby. The 5 star status remain to be challenged.

He explained the reason for a longer check in time, and acted very professionally, friendly and genuine.

The hotel staff are friendly and professional, particularly the cleaning staffs for Room 1120 and 1006. Restaurant staffs for morning breakfast were well trained as well, making the breakfast experience relaxing and enjoyable.

We stayed two nights, and checked out with Mr Zhu as well. 

Overall, very satisfied with the stay and would recommend friends if they were to also stay in Shanghai. 

The happy hour drink is a kind gesture, however the limited time from 6-7:30pm is not so friendly. Would be better if it can be used anytime of the day.

As for swimming pool - super small and cos it was so freaking cold outside, we didn‚Äôt even try it. The walk from the gym to swimming pool looked like it was cold there. But can‚Äôt tell for sure. Breakfast - good variety - try Benedict‚Äôs eggs - amazing. Great coffee, enough food, very pleasant service. First day we ate at 10am, not so many people, the next day we went at 9:30 - more people and no tables, everything was nearly eaten, poor chefs had to work super fast. The last day we had to line up - it was around 10‚Äô, but it‚Äôs understandable cos we were at the hotel during Spring Festival. Overall, I‚Äôll recommend this hotel. Ps. Cocktails are great! Especially Appletini and Negronis. üòåüòå

I guess soon will need to be refurbish to stay up the the Andaz/Hyatt clients are expecting for. A great YES to food, thanks to Benjamin and his staff, from breakfast to night time room-service the food was good, fast and well presented. Good service and overall good attitude of the hotel staff, including every dept from reception, concierge (the only one should actually improve‚Ä¶), dining and room-service, all very professional and nice.

The facilities are very good - especially the gym and swimming area. Also, the room is very comfortable and convenient with an IPad controlling all functions e.g. TV, AC, lighting and curtains etc.  This matters a lot to me because I‚Äôve stayed at several hotels which are supposedly 5-star yet their AC system is fixed by central controls.  These details make the difference for me. I‚Äôll be happy to return again.

Mr. Chang at the front desk is very impressive.
This time, I arrived at the hotel very late in the morning. Not only did he help me upgrade to a view room, but he also gave me a luggage tag, which satisfied my collection habit!
The room is smarter than before, all controlled by an iPad pro, which is much more convenient than before.
The room is large and very quiet, so you can sleep well at night
The bathroom has dry and wet separation + smart toilet, and the iconic colored light bathtub, which I like very much
The brunch at Xintiandi downstairs is getting more and more fancy, very convenient, and I can't eat it all
The hotel bar is also very good, the wine is delicious, and the service is super good!

However, the curtains and lights are all controlled by pads, which is not very friendly to older guests, and the pad response is also quite slow.
This package also has an evening buffet, with a lot of choices and good flavors, and the service is also very responsive.
I feel that there are fewer choices for breakfast in the morning. I prefer the semi-self-service service in Shenzhen.

The soft drinks and snacks in the minibar in the room were thoughtfully prepared. The snacks provided in the lounge in the evening were great! The hotel's breakfast is also delicious. The a la carte waffles, muffins, and eggs Benedict are all exquisite and delicious. Shopping here is also very convenient. K11, Hong Kong Plaza, and Huaihai Middle Road are nearby.

The overall service of the hotel is indeed very good! However, the hardware facilities are imperfect and a bit old. Things that need improvement are:

1. Takeaway cannot be delivered upstairs, you have to take it upstairs yourself, which is really inconvenient.
2. The hotel TV picture is very unclear and blurry, and the sound quality is also very poor. People who want to watch TV may be disappointed.
3. The washbasin in the bathroom is too small, and the water will splash out every time, which is inconvenient.
4. For girls, there is no makeup mirror in the bathroom, making it inconvenient to put on makeup.

Hope it improves.

I booked a morning flight this time and arrived at the hotel at 11:00. I was very worried that I would not be able to check in. The front desk beauty Betty was very warm and told me to check in immediately if there was a room. I was still feeling a little unwell at the time, and I was very warmed after hearing that. I checked in very quickly! The location is also great. You can go to Xintiandi and K11, and it is also very close to the subway. It is very convenient to go anywhere. The hotel itself is very fashionable. All room controls are operated by iPad, which is very convenient. It is the first choice for business trips and travel. The only shortcoming is that the view room I booked was not arranged for me on the Xintiandi side, but if I want to check in first, the options are limited. In short, I was very happy these days.

msg:Avoid Shanghai Andaz Hotel!! I have stayed here for 11 days and 10 nights and I have the right to speak for myself. It was an extremely unhappy stay. If I hadn't felt unwell, I would have changed hotels long ago.
1. The hygiene was extremely poor and dirty. There was a hair from the genitals on the bed sheet (see Figure 1). I immediately called the customer service number to ask them to change the bed sheet. When the room service came in and saw it, they said lightly, "hai", and didn't care. It can be seen that they are used to it. Then they took off the genital hair with their hands and continued to make the bed... I couldn't stand it anymore and gave the waiter alcohol to disinfect her hands before letting her continue to make the bed. After the waiter left, I saw two body hairs and long hair on the floor. It was really disgusting. When I picked up the hair on the floor, there was a layer of dust on the floor that was visible to the naked eye.
2. There is no service at all. I stayed here for 10 days. I opened the door myself every day when I went to work and got off work. No doorman would help me open it. Is this a service provided by high-end hotels? I helped open the door a few times after getting off the car to the hotel. If I hadn't felt unwell, and Andaz was close to the company, I would have moved to another place long ago.
3. Any food delivery cannot be delivered to the room, and the hotel will not help deliver it. You can only go downstairs to get it yourself. Of course, many hotels are like this, and I understand this point. It is convenient for management and guest safety. However, on the last day, a ** rider knocked on the door of the room and said that the takeaway had arrived. I really don't know what the security of this hotel is doing, and who helped the takeaway rider swipe the card to get on the elevator (see Figure 4). The takeaway was really placed at the door.
4. The wireless network is basically unavailable. Mobile phones, computers, and iPads are disconnected from the network all the time. The mobile phone 5G signal is also very poor. It is recommended that those who need video conferencing for business travel should not stay here (see Figure 3)
5. During the stay, the room card inexplicably did not work. I didn't take anything with me and was locked out of the door. I was really convinced.
6. The shower head in the toilet fell down 3 times and almost hit someone (see Figure 2). Another time in the middle of the night, it was really scary and had a heart attack. Then there was a lingering smell of urine from the public toilet in the toilet.
7. The front desk is very unprofessional. When I was about to leave the room at 7:55, the invoice was issued at 8:15. They were always late for work. Either the days were short or the money was not right.
8. In addition, there was a fat waiter wearing rayban glasses at the front desk. If you like to be so arrogant, you should not work in the service industry. After checking in for the first time, I changed floors. I walked to the elevator entrance and couldn‚Äôt press the elevator because I forgot the room number. I turned back to ask if I gave the wrong room card. The rayban brother had a very bad attitude. It was like a dislocated jaw when he spoke. "Yes, yes." It's normal to forget. Can't you talk properly? The second time I went to renew the room, I reported the room number and it was the fat brother's turn. He couldn't hear clearly and asked me again. Then the renewal process felt like he was going to throw the mouse, making a loud noise. His attitude was really bad. As for?

The staff member I met during check-in, Betty, was very enthusiastic. She came at a time when there were many people. Betty was very efficient and helped me take care of things quickly. The twin room booked this time is very suitable for a family of three. Great reviews as always.

msg:The transportation is very convenient and the room is very comfortable. Alan, who checked me in at the front desk, was very enthusiastic and provided free breakfast, but asked me to make a review. I didn't eat it, so I can make an objective review without any psychological burden. After the check-out time, the front desk guy took me upstairs to get my luggage. The location, environment, and service are all highlights.

But I especially need to mention the problem of facility experience. When it was close to 8 o'clock, the curtains suddenly closed automatically, and the lights turned off automatically, and then the lights turned on automatically again in the morning. You can imagine the scene of feeling **, and I was still scared at the first time. Personally, I think it is really unnecessary to add this kind of automated program design on your own initiative. It is not high-end and it also affects the experience. There is also the shower mixing device shown in the picture. It really doesn't know which direction it should be adjusted. It is easy to get scalded by hot water.

We brought a half-grown child with a free extra bed and gave the child a free breakfast. These small favors will make the trip more enjoyable. Thanks to the unsmiling Mr. Jay who received us that day, he was so awesome!
The room was a bit old, but the air conditioning was warm and the hot water was strong. Coupled with the smart toilet and the mini bar that was replenished every day, I stayed comfortably for two days. The housekeeper is an old man who is also very friendly and easy to talk to.
I went to have breakfast. The service, variety and taste were excellent. There were pancakes, glutinous rice cubes, curry beef vermicelli and other delicacies.
Coupled with the super convenient location and great value for money, I will definitely choose Andaz next time!

msg:I came to Shanghai for a business trip and stayed at the Andaz in the middle of the week. The hotel is in a great location and is close to the subway station, which is convenient for travel. It is surrounded by the Xintiandi business district, which is very convenient for shopping and eating. Jay, the guy at the front desk, was very friendly and thoughtful. When checking in, he asked me if I wanted some hot tea or coffee to warm me up. He also helped me upgrade to a suite for free. The room is very spacious, with an elegant and warm design. The bar is equipped with free soft drinks and snacks, which is delicious. The 2-meter large bed is suitable for me, who has ADHD. The toilet has separate wet and dry areas for rain, and there is also a large bathtub. It is very comfortable to take a dip to get rid of the cold during these two daysüòå

I drank red wine in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows and didn't want to leave until check-out time. Thanks to the breakfast coupon provided by Lance at the front desk, the breakfast was also very rich. The sentence printed on the window glass was particularly healing: Humor is when a person can laugh when he wants to cry.

I've stayed in hotels so many times, and this is the first time I've seen a guest call the front desk. Isn't it funny? Is your front desk service like this? Check-in was done wrong, registration was done wrong, if I remember correctly, you violated the accommodation industry management regulations? This is a mistake that no budget hotel would make.

The happy hour dry white is delicious.
The location is good. It is very convenient to visit Herm√®s House, Xintiandi and surrounding shopping malls.

Later, I went to the front desk to check in. Since the room type was only on the 9th floor, Betty, the guest experience manager at the front desk, found a way to help arrange an upgrade. We went directly to the 20th floor without waiting for long, and even gave us drinks in the lobby bar. Thank you very much, you are such a beautiful and kind-hearted lady.

msg:Having stayed here too many times, I really need to point out this time: 1. After booking the room, the front desk did not inform me that the big bed was made up of two small beds. 2. Press the 0 button when entering the room. I called twice to ask for a room change. Two different people answered the call. They both said that the front desk would give feedback immediately. As a result, I waited in the room for more than 20 minutes without any feedback, so I decisively took my luggage and left the front desk. 3. Asked the front desk, and directly responded that he was busy (nor did he mention whether he knew whether he asked for a room change), and there was no other explanation of the service. 4. Waiting for room change, about 10 minutes to arrange a room next to me. I offered not to stay in a side room, so I changed rooms again. Although it was upgraded to a landscape in the end, the process was very quiet. 5. During the entire process, the zero-key operators (two different people) never asked, gave feedback or confirmed whether the room had been changed. It felt like they were just manual operators. Summary function label reference: hotel front desk service standardization, 0-key customer service function service process.

The decoration is artistic and youthful, with some fusion style. The view of the bustling city has different temperatures during the day and night. The color-changing breathing lamp in the room can be regarded as a check-in feature, including the bathtub lamp that also changes color~
In addition, I really like the breakfast at Andaz. It has a rich variety and there are not too many tenants. I often skip breakfast when traveling for business. But when I stay at Andaz, I will definitely wake up early and have a good breakfast. I especially recommend the fried dumplings. They are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They are juicy and delicious. The wontons are also delicious.
Also, Hank who helped me check in this time was very warm and thoughtful. Like itüëç

In terms of service, when checking in at the front desk, the front desk guy helped upgrade the room type for free.
The location is great. The hotel is above the subway station. Downstairs is Xintiandi and Tianzifang. It is very convenient to go to the First Congress site, Tianzifang and Xintiandi.
Room, the overall style of the room I booked is more mahogany. It is very suitable for solid wood lovers to come and experience living. All the windows in the room are large floor-to-ceiling windows, with a very broad view. The shower room and washroom are also very large. I won‚Äôt focus on anything else. I arrived at the hotel too late, so I didn‚Äôt take any photos and just went to bed.

Although the hotel has been open for a long time and has some shortcomings in hardware, these are made up for in software. From the comprehensive room supplies to the integrated iPad control panel, there are details everywhere.

It is worth mentioning that the hotel‚Äôs scenery and breakfast are also unexpected. Five-star recommendation haha

There are many places to eat and play around Xintiandi. The hotel service is very good overall, especially the ispa service is very good, I really love it! There are many kinds of breakfast. In short, the price/performance ratio of a five-star hotel at this price is quite high!

msg:I have never stayed in an international five-star hotel with such poor hygiene. I changed rooms three times in one night. The soles of the slippers were very dirty. There was no outer packaging and pilling on the uppers. There were obvious signs of wear. There were foreign objects on the bath towel and the sink. The first room I changed had long hair on the bedding (I have short hair) and stains on the pillow case. The night shift manager said that he had hired someone to clean it carefully. He took me to the third room and worked there until almost 1 o'clock in the morning. When I was getting ready to go to bed, I lifted the quilt and saw something foreign on the bed. At this time, I no longer dared to "discover" other problems and just slept for one night.

Andaz is in such a prime location, but its facilities are outdated, the receptionist is unfamiliar, the non-smoking floors have a strong smell of smoke and musty, and the fresh air system is completely out of order. The key points are It's a hygiene issue. This hair dryer is put in a roll in the basket, and I don't know when the old stains were accumulated. The towels were probably from pre-pandemic times, they were tattered and threadbare after being washed.

As a brand under the Hyatt Group, the service is also very good. I arrived early in the morning, because Weasker, who is in charge of the front desk, coordinated the early check-in because of the video conference. On the day of check-in, it was my daughter's birthday, and I was given a freshly made 4-inch birthday cake, which was beautiful in appearance and taste.

The room is quite large in size and well-equipped. It is in a busy city but the sound insulation is good and quiet. The minibar in the room is free, and there is happy hour in the lobby from 18:00-19:00 on the day of check-in, providing drinks, fruits and snacks. But because I went out, I didn‚Äôt experience it!

The hotel gym is fully equipped for various sports. After checking out the next day, I had afternoon tea with my friends in the lobby bar, and the experience was also very good! Overall, all aspects are very good, and I will choose it next time.

The noise problem is also consulted with Hank, and this problem cannot be solved for the time being. If you have poor sleep quality, you must communicate with the front desk first. See if you can change the direction of the room type.
The service is still great. Opening a bottle at the bar on the first floor is still great. I will help deliver the room~ If it is not noisy in the future, I will definitely come again

The front desk said that the room had not been cleaned yet and asked us to wait. It lasted more than an hour and asked us to check in. The luggage was stored and they were told to get the room card and send it to the room for us, but they only took it outside the elevator and let us pull it by ourselves~ We were traveling together and they were told to arrange us on the same floor, but in the end we found that each room was on a different floor~ Experience The feeling is really bad ~ The last three points are for breakfast. Breakfast is quite good, the service is very good and there are many choices ~

It‚Äôs really good to be able to consume some calories while being full‚Ä¶. The hardware is already very goodüëç But the service of the gentlemen and ladies of Andaz is really great, especially the personalized service of Jayden at the concierge is really impressive. When I celebrated my mother‚Äôs birthday in advance, I arranged a clean room at 13:00. The room was decorated with üå∫ and the birthday gift made of towel bears was so touching. In addition, wine and wine were also thoughtfully prepared. The cake is amazing, it's really really a surprise.... I would like to thank Jayden very much, we really had a very Magic Day!! In addition, I would like to mention the hotel's restaurant, the buffet dinner is very rich. There are not only crayfish, but also small The hot pot, bolong, and small seafood are very rich...the price/performance ratio is really high...I recommend everyone to come to Andaz for dinnerüç¥Because there are many gentlemen and ladies like Jayden serving the guests, I will definitely choose Andaz again My hotel to celebrate every big anniversary for family and friends....U are the Best!!

The air conditioner in this hotel room keeps vibrating... very noisy. You can turn on your mobile phone in the video and listen to the sound. It should be caused by the air conditioner not being overhauled for a long time...

Location: It is very close to Xintiandi. It is also very convenient to go in and out of the side door for shopping around, and it is more convenient for vehicles to stop and get on and off at the door.

Facilities: It's a bit old, the bed feels a bit crooked, and the TV channels are few and unclear.

Sound insulation effect: It's too bad. The sound of entering and closing the door next door is very noisy. In addition, I can hear the sound of pulling tables and chairs from upstairs or next door. I didn't have a good rest.

Hygiene: Nothing but nothing.

Service: OK.

From the aspects of sanitation, facilities and hotel operation, there is no one at this price range. After checking in, it was far away from the hotel elevator, there was no one to guide the way, and the staff was laughing and joking. The elevator corridor is old and unclearly marked. As soon as I entered the room, the TV turned on loudly. I thought I had entered the wrong room and thought there was someone inside.
The layout of the room is very unreasonable. Only one side of the bedside tables on both sides has a power supply. The sheets and towels are very poor. The TV was broken and it took 4 calls to get answered. It couldn't be repaired and there were no follow-up arrangements. They said they would be arranged tomorrow. Check out decisively

The receptionists at the front desk are also very enthusiastic and professional. The only fly in the oin**ent may be that the check-in time is relatively late, and no one answers the call to the customer service center from the guest room.

msg:Family trip this weekend. I deliberately chose the Andaz Hotel, which is located in the downtown area. Before I came, I was a little apprehensive. After all, there is a big construction site next to the online reviews. During the check-in process. Mr. Jin, the lobby manager at the front desk, was very enthusiastic and had a great chat. In so many hotel stay experiences. Mr. Jin's service and reception left a deep impression on me. Let's talk about the check-in experience. The room may be a bit long due to renovation. In terms of bathroom facilities, some are not satisfactory. Basin for washbasin. There are some traces of history. Bathrooms feature stone workmanship. It doesn't always look so bright and clean, and the ambiguous luminous bathtub may be more suitable for young people. Of course, the overall hygiene of the room is acceptable, and there is no peculiar smell in the room. The air conditioner is a little loud. But not to the extent that it affects sleep, the guest room also has spare 3M earplugs. The bedding is relatively comfortable, the pillows are very comfortable, and the temperature and humidity are fine. It is very convenient to operate the room with a tablet control system. Looking out of the room window, the city view is actually pretty good. It may be because of the dust storm in the past two days. The glass on the exterior wall is somewhat blurred, which affects the perception. Hope to be able to do exterior wall cleaning frequently. The location of the hotel is truly blessed. Whether it is to the bustling commercial center or to the lively alleys, it is only a short distance away. Overall, it was a very satisfying hotel experience. Once again, praise the hotel reception manager Jin.

msg:Services and facilities are not good. Not a very pleasant stay experience

First of all, let me talk about the service of the hotel: I would like to praise the waiters in the restaurant and the concierge brother at the door. This should be the only aspect of this hotel that is worthy of praise.
1. From the time of check-in, the attitude of the front desk is very impatient. I asked about the breakfast time, and asked again when I spoke in a low voice and couldn't hear clearly, emphasizing it very loudly.
2. The cost and standard of the deposit was not informed in time, and it was only explained clearly after I repeatedly asked.
  

again,
1: I called from the ipad to send a pair of men's slippers to the room, but it didn't arrive after waiting for 40 minutes. It didn't come until I called again to urge it.
2: I called to ask if there is a late check-out. The service staff was ambiguous, and finally told me that there was a late check-out. As a result, the room door could not be swiped at 12 o'clock. Fortunately, there were people in the room.

The air conditioner was clearly adjusted to a low wind of 23 degrees, but suddenly it started to turn on the high wind for me, and the sound was very loud. It didn't work until I got up in the middle of the night and adjusted to the low wind again.
And I searched for the charging port beside the bed for a long time and couldn't find it until I moved the bedside table. However, the various sockets behind the bedside table were damaged or broken, which was unsightly.

Hygiene: Hygiene is not careful enough and the bed is not clean enough.

Environment: There is construction at the construction site next to the hotel. Piling is being driven at 7 o'clock in the morning. It is impossible to sleep.
Service: The level of the hotel's engineering maintenance personnel or management staff is indeed limited. After changing rooms, the engineer was repairing the door next door at 10 o'clock in the morning. After a while, the door was violently outputting. I was convinced. Didn't the hotel know this? Are there other customers on the floor?

The delivery boy said that the concierge refused to let them use the food delivery robot because it could only be used to deliver items such as medicine. A cup of milk tea is too heavy and cannot be delivered. I met some weird groupies in the lobby. In the middle of the night, I sat in the lobby with a bunch of things and waited. Because you need to swipe your card to take the elevator. The star-chasers even tried to follow her into the elevator. The concierge and security staff may need more training.

msg:At that time, I arrived at the store quite late, but the check-in service still did not reduce the points. I originally booked the Xintiandi landscape, and I was upgraded to a loft suite for free. After entering the room, it was the living room with increasing space, and the panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows facing me. , because I arrived late, it was a pity that I didn't see the night view. When I woke up the next day, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a three-piece suit, which can be said to be a pleasant surprise.
The texture of the sofa and bed is impeccable. When my girlfriend is taking a shower, I don't want to move directly on the sofa.
Next to the bed is a recliner next to the floor-to-ceiling windows, matching the urban landscape of Shanghai, directly cyberpunk
The double washbasin and the thick carpet at the standing place are very thoughtful and meticulous designs, and the texture of the bathrobe is also very good
The stone-textured wall design in the bathroom seems to be in a hot spring room, and a bit like a stalactite cave, very comfortable
The two fly in the oin**ent are: 1. The TV cannot be mirrored 2. The takeaway cannot be delivered to the room, even with a robot?

msg:Within three months, I stayed at Andaz for one month successively. The location of the hotel is very good, but there are a few things that make me very dissatisfied. Let me mainly talk about the shortcomings
‚ë†The hot cocoa for breakfast was sprinkled when it arrived, and there was a piece of plastic packaging inside the cup. It is normal for fried eggs to have eggshells, but it is not normal for fried eggs with eggshells at this price. Basic services are not available.
‚ë°The front desk asked to write good reviews. The front desk actually dared to use my mobile phone to write good reviews, and wrote several in a row. This is something that a normal hotel can do.
‚ë¢It is inconvenient if the takeaway is not delivered upstairs
‚ë£ The facilities are old, some rooms are under renovation, some ipads don‚Äôt work, some toilets don‚Äôt work, some lights don‚Äôt work

During the rest period in the room, the equipment in the room automatically started up twice and was inexplicably woken up. The waiter only pressed the doorbell when entering the room and came in without being allowed. Please do a good job in training at Andaz. The front desk is also extremely inefficient.

msg:This year when I came to Shanghai for the Spring Festival, I stayed at Andaz again, and I also stayed here on the second day of the ***** New Year last year. This is the third time I have stayed at Andaz Shanghai Xintiandi. I like the eclectic and fashionable design style here, which makes it easy to make an appointment. The ceiling lights of different colors can be switched in the room, and the cave-style natural bathroom with magic crystal bathtub is the main feature. It is novel and creative.

This time I arrived at the hotel at 12 o'clock on the second day of the new year. I thought I would have to wait for the room at this time. I didn't expect the front desk to tell me that the room had already been arranged for me, and I was welcome to stay many times. Indeed, the floor of the room is relatively high this time, 22nd floor. You can see the Pudong three-piece suite from a distance, and you can also overlook Xintiandi. Very satisfied with this arrangement.

Shanghai Xintiandi Andaz is located in the core of the Xintiandi business district, surrounded by major shopping malls, Xintiandi Fashion Plaza, and a large conference site. The subway transportation is extremely convenient and extends in all directions. If you come to Shanghai to play, you must live here.

I am very grateful to the hotel staff for the wonderful experience of every stay. I would also like to thank the concierge John Tang for his help during the farewell.

We were standing in front of the computer and didn't understand why they didn't answer the phone. They told me that maybe there were too many reservations, which I could understand, but I called five times and I just couldn't figure it out! The room is small and smells bad. It is better to stay at the Langham next door. There are too many options at the same price, but Andaz is the worst!

The dessert buffet at the hotel dinner is OK, and the Le Koufu cake is also very special, but other meals are really average. The luckiest thing was that I sat down on a chair in the dining room for breakfast the next day. The viscose chair was unglued, and I fell heavily. It was the two diners who were dining next to me who helped me up. It was a real fall. Silly. Embarrassingly embarrassing for the first time in public.

The hotel also sent a small cake to congratulate my husband on his birthday. I think the service is very considerate.

msg:N years ago on a business trip, I came to the hotel for dinner. The service was good and the location was good. So this time I took my children and wanted to find a hotel with good transportation and location. After comparing this hotel with Ascott, I finally chose Andaz.

How should I put it, I feel that geography is an advantage. I feel too scary when I enter the room. The lighting, including the bathtub and sink, is also red, green, yellow and blue. It has a strong a**osphere of an improper place. I don‚Äôt know the selling point of the Internet celebrity hotel. Could it be this light, the child went to the toilet at night and pressed the wrong sink to emit green light, so frightened that he couldn't sleep for a long time.

In addition, the design of various buttons is not very friendly, the lack of charging head, especially the USB is inconvenient, the shower has no door, and the overall design of the bathroom is particularly strange. All in all the kids and I didn't feel very comfortable.

The overall service is good, although the breakfast is not a lot but the quality is good. However, I can't accept the careful selection of neon lights.

The room also has a large workshop, which is also very comfortable to work. The hotel is very close to Xintiandi and Huaihai Road, you can walk around at night.

Special thanks to the hotel staff for their careful arrangements, and Erin to make people feel the same warmth and comfort at home when they go out.
In addition, I met many business travelers in the hotel, and it seems that Andaz is also the first choice for business personnel.

I have stayed in this hotel twice, and this time I was very disappointed
I ordered a bowl of beef porridge to the room in the morning. When it arrived, the waiter said that the porridge was a bit hot, so I opened the porridge and was ready to drink it 15 minutes later. At that time, I took a spoonful of it with a ceramic spoon and brought it to my mouth very carefully, but I burned a piece of skin directly at that time, and it swelled up tonight.
Reflect this situation with the hotel, as a five-star hotel, and a non-low-end hotel belonging to the Hyatt Group. The deputy manager of the hotel restaurant does not put himself in the shoes of the guests. Instead, a few paragraphs were sent over to shirk responsibility. This way of dealing with problems, I think it does not match its brand positioning and price! ! !

Fortunately, the front desk staff helped me upgrade to a larger suite on the basis of the original suite, and the service was praised! The room of more than 100 square meters is very large and the facilities are also very complete. The lower floor is the living room, and the upper floor is the office area, bedroom and bathroom. It is worth mentioning that the bathtub is super large and can basically lie flat.
The transportation is convenient, and the two commercial districts of Xintiandi and Huaihai Road can be reached within ten minutes on foot.
The spa located on the basement level is also very good, except that the price is slightly expensive, it is worth a visit.
But the fly in the oin**ent is that while the facilities are complete, the sense of delicacy is slightly weak. For example, the door frame on the side of the main entrance of the suite is loose, the imitation wood veneer of some furniture is lifted, and the seam between the bathtub and the ground is slightly leaking, etc. I look forward to a new look in the future. of refurbishment.

The Lobby Lounge provides Chinese and Western light meals, tea and coffee. The environment is elegant and the seats are very comfortable, so people can't help but rest here. Before leaving, we had yellow croaker noodles and kung pao chicken rice here, the taste was very good, the yellow croaker was tender and delicious, very delicious, chicken rice is also my son's favorite. The twin room is about 41 square meters, with Chinese style decoration, electric curtains, and the Shanghai Center can be seen from the spacious floor-to-ceiling windows; the bathroom has TOTO smart toilet, TOTO large bathtub, and Methwin shower set; the bedding is of good quality, soft, clean and skin-friendly , a good sleep experience. Breakfast and dinner are in the dining hall on the 2nd floor. Breakfast is from 6:30 to 10:00 and dinner is from 18:00 to 21:00. The breakfast is semi-self-service. The bread and drinks are taken by yourself. The rest of the meals are ordered. The taste is relatively ordinary and has no special features. The crayfish for dinner tastes good, the fried fish hot pot is also good, the sushi and sashimi are acceptable, the steamed seafood is OK, but there are not many varieties.

He also arranged an adjacent room for us to take care of us. On the day of check-out, he also took the initiative to tell us where there are fresh meat moon cakes sold. Very responsible ~ I believe I will choose this one if I have the opportunity! This stay felt really good! It's worth recommending~

msg:Andaz has heard its name for a long time, but never found a chance to live there. Taking advantage of the opportunity of this Mid-Autumn Festival, he booked a king-size bed room with a view of Xintiandi. Maybe the expectations are too high. The so-called Xintiandi landscape is as shown in the fourth picture. Basically, what you see is what you get. There is no lighting night scene at night.
Andaz's hardware environment is a bit old, and the service is quite satisfactory. The front desk on the first floor is also very special. The waiters and guests have to stand to check in. The bathtub in the bathroom turned out to be lighted, and combined with the overall style of the room, it felt a bit like a love hotel, which is really not suitable for business people.
If there is something worthy of praise, it is a partial Chinese breakfast that can satisfy the taste buds of Chinese people. Freshly made noodles, noodles and small wontons are all good choices. Long Bao, are very authentic Chinese food, in line with the taste of Chinese people.

This time I came to Shanghai and booked Andaz. It feels like a three-star standard, and I deliberately chose the one with breakfast. It turned out to be the worst breakfast I have ever eaten. There are few categories, and many are not replenished. The croissant is soft, which is unacceptable. I ate two mouthfuls of salad. , I gave up a piece of bread, and my friends who accompanied me paid 280 yuan to accompany me to dinner, which was simply not garbage.

The positioning of the hotel itself is also based on trend design. In addition to business guests, there are also many young hipsters punching in. The little details and thoughtfulness of the hotel can be seen everywhere.

Special thanks to Neil in the front office for arranging the paid upgrade, which allowed us to experience the hotel's special room type super large room, the room space is very large, and the equipment is well maintained, which is a bit beyond our original expectations for the hotel.

The bathtub is particularly interesting. It can be switched to different colors as the light changes, which is one of the highlights.

During the epidemic, the hotel's epidemic prevention policy was also in place, which made our stay very comfortable.

Overall, the stay experience is very good, next time we will give priority to Xintiandi Andaz

Although the choice of breakfast is small, the taste and quality are still excellent.
I don't understand why so many have to take out the brand. Is it to control waste or to highlight the service. I eat a lot of empty plates in one meal, which is not environmentally friendly. I don't know if it's for epidemic prevention requirements after the epidemic or what
There is also a small gym, some of which are outsourced, and the swimming pool is as small as a bathtub and a lot of teaching.

I went back to the hotel at 10:00 pm to prepare to take a shower, but there was no hot water. I called the service desk and they said that they sent engineers to check the door and waited for 40 minutes. Called many times and still no one came. Later, I finally couldn't help but asked to change the room. After changing the room, there was still no hot water. Later, I had to tell us the truth. It was because their pipes were aging and needed to be repaired. Now the engineers are checking and repairing, and there are people in other houses. Complaining about the lack of hot water, I think this is too inhumane, completely unsympathetic, keeps making people wait without telling us the real reason. Since the hotel is an old hotel, the floor of the shower room and the wooden floor of the room make people feel damp, dark and dirty. I called the front desk to ask for a shower cap, but I actually waited for 20 minutes. The experience was very poor and I won't go there again.

msg:The location of the hotel is unique. It is Xintiandi when you go out, and Huaihai Road to the north. The dining and shopping are excellent! As the first Andaz in Asia, although the overall hardware is slightly outdated, the sense of design is still there. The front desk is open, and coffee and ginger tea are self-serve and drink, which is more heartwarming!
The parent-child room has a large area and is a small suite. There are two TVs. You can directly watch online content such as iQiyi and Youku. It is the opening of the Winter Olympics. Watching programs at night will not affect the children's rest. PAD control, strong sense of technology. The service is on call and the attitude is friendly. The only drawback is that the windows of the room cannot be opened. If a humidifier is needed for drying in autumn and winter, the number of the hotel is insufficient, and it is very old and has a lot of scale. It can be replaced.
The variety of breakfast is average, but the taste is good. I recommend fresh meat moon cakes and noodle stalls, which are generally praised.

Looking at Ctrip, it was renovated in 2017, but I feel that the materials in the room are not advanced enough, and the craftsmanship is also very general. The sliding doors of the wardrobe in Room 1611 where I lived have cracked and collapsed. The marble design of the shower room in the bathroom is quite beautiful (picture 2), but it is not clean enough and feels uncomfortable.

The overall appearance design is very novel. The door is low-key, but it is still very recognizable. Masks are placed directly at the door. Guests use the concierge to check their health codes dutifully. Although the lobby is not big, it is well-appointed. It is decorated for Chris**as and is full of festive a**osphere. Be sure to name and praise Patrick at the front desk! When he saw me checking in, he greeted me warmly and helped me carry my luggage. Knowing that it was my first time to Andaz, he also carefully introduced me to the hotel's facilities and equipment because the epidemic in Shanghai was recurring. He also patiently told me the nearest nucleic acid testing location. The service awareness such as time precautions and so on is really great! The room is also quite satisfactory. You can use the iPad to control the lighting, curtains, bathroom lights, and adjust the color of the room service. There is no need to pick things up. The customer service center is very fast and the service is good. The restaurant is also quite complete and has a variety of cuisines. I like it when I check out. I had the nerve to ask for room cards of different colors, hahaha. All in all, it was a very satisfying stay! Will come often in the future!

The view is OK and the lighting is OK, but there is a big pillar in the corner room, which affects the vision and mood.

health:
The sanitation is so-so, the main room is too old and looks very dirty; and when the toilet enters the door, it smells and is extremely uncomfortable.

wifi:
The Wi-Fi speed is acceptable.

bed:
Hard, skin-friendly bedding is also average.

Room facilities:
Unexpectedly, it was really broken... The room was very small... The whole decoration was old and broken, and it felt very bad; fortunately, it was an electric toilet; the shower, the water flow was very small, and the temperature was not easy to adjust. It's always high and it's very uncomfortable to take a bath.

Cost performance:
1400 in one night, in addition to the brand premium + good location, it is really not worth it, it should be the last time to choose to stay.

When I drove to the hotel entrance, because I couldn‚Äôt find the parking lot and the concierge John was very enthusiastic. Tell me where the parking lot is, and then took me to park the car personally.

There is no parking space, let me park in the underground garage opposite to someone else‚Äôs house... Parked and pulled the suitcase and walked to the hotel. When I checked in, I found a parking space. Okay, then I‚Äôll get the car and park it because I‚Äôm not familiar with it. The entrance to the underground garage is not there. I had to make a detour around the hotel on the other side, and then drove to the door of the hotel to ask the security guard at the door. The man in red could see that he wanted to help me solve the problem, but the other in black was wearing it with his hands. In red, don‚Äôt you want to help the guest solve the problem? ! The key point is that I explained again for the second time that I am a guest, and what kind of arrogant attitude he is. The security guard at the door of another hotel is very enthusiastic and showed me the way... I have no special feelings. The room facilities are all digitally controlled, which is a highlight. .

1. The front desk of the hotel was not in a good mood
2. The air conditioner was broken and the temperature could not be adjusted. Someone came to fix it. The point is that they entered the room without knocking. Afterwards, we asked the employee why they did not knock. The employee said that they were used to entering the guest room without knocking... I want to ask what if you got the wrong room?
3. At 12:45am, before going to bed, I found that there was a light that could not be turned off no matter what. I tried all the switches in the room and still could not turn it off. I called the hotel to fix it and it took half an hour before someone came...
4. This light could not be turned off no matter what, so the room attendant directly unplugged it and then there was no air conditioning! There were so many problems with the room and they told us that there was no way to get the air conditioning. We had to turn on the lights until dawn. I was really angry. I said, even so, why don‚Äôt you arrange a new room for us? Even so, they arranged a new room for us
The most speechless thing was that after we arrived at the new room, we were about to fall asleep and suddenly all the lights in the room were on... Really ****!!! Then we checked out at 2am and ordered other things.

This is the first time in my life that I give a bad review... I am really speechless üòì

Floor-to-ceiling glass windows directly overlook the entire Xintiandi, with a red roof. The rooms are intelligent, the lighting can be adjusted, and the bathtub in the bathroom can change the color. The location of the hotel is really great. Before you go out, you will find Xintiandi, and Hong Kong Plaza on the left.

msg:I haven't returned to Andaz for a long time. Indeed, compared with three years ago, the facilities have seen the traces of the years. The wood lacquered surface, marble and bar carpets in the lobby have all begun to show a mottled feeling. I arrived at the hotel around noon. I was deeply impressed by the concierge‚Äôs seriousness in checking the health code. I just carried a backpack and walked straight into the lobby with the appearance of a hotel employee. The employee caught up and checked my itinerary code and health code. I stored a Suzhou health code on my mobile phone and was told that it could not be used, so I rescanned the Shanghai health code before letting me in. The front desk estimated that there were not many people due to the epidemic. A young lady named Pan received me by the Andaz characteristic reception desk. She was very polite and caring. She served me ice towels and sour plum soup, which immediately drove me away from the hot summer. Of distress. The arrangement for me this time is a 26-corner room, which is still familiar and the scenery is quite good. The invincible night view of Xintiandi adds a lot to this stay. When I was leaving, I ran into another young lady with the surname Li, who should be their front desk manager, with the same enthusiasm and politeness. Not only did they inquire about my stay experience this time, but also specially left her contact information for me to facilitate my next time. You can make some early communication and arrangements for check-in, which is very considerate. In general, the obsolete facilities did not bring me any discomfort. On the contrary, the meticulous service impressed me deeply. It seems that software is the most important value of a hotel.

After co, I sat on the sofa in the lobby bar to take a taxi, and was politely asked to leave by the waiter. This was not very humane.

The design concept of the hotel, maybe because the hotel is open early, the whole room is red, yellow, blue and green ambiance lamp can also be warmed lamp, but when you are not careful, the ceiling is green, red, purple or something, and the bathroom is opaque. The lights are not turned on during the day. It is dark with the ice bath tub blue. The tone and the blue sink make people sweat. 
The equipment in the hotel room is old and many hardware is still falling off and damaged.
The most incomprehensible is that the hotel actually outsources the lobby to others. There is only one place to check in. This means that there is no seat for the sofa and chair. 
It's a couple of chairs, and it's three or four tall chairs that are up against the wall. 
And the front door and the hotel waiter looked at the hotel guests without a seat or reference. 
Feel a sense of service in Shanghai
Pros: The only thing to be desired is the location and the breakfast was ok

Before I went to call the hotel, could I try my best to arrange a room that could see the venue of the conference? The hotel also thoughtfully sent people to each room to take a look around, and then helped me choose the best and clearest view of the conference.

The reception desk provides iced plum soup, which quenches thirst, and children love to drink it.... .. The room is very spacious, with a connecting door in the middle, which separates the office area from the bedroom. A family of three is very comfortable. There is a small bar on the first floor.

The occupancy rate is still quite high, after all, the location is there. To be honest, the so-called view room has no view at all. That Xiaoxiaoxintiandi doesn‚Äôt know what to look at; the 41-square-meter room still feels very cramped, small everywhere, even the door to the room is small; the elevator is too loud, whirring The TV is too old, the pictures are all flowery; the floor and bed cabinets are also scratched... The hardware is not good, the software is available, but the service is uneven, so many people need to queue up, the front desk attitude is relatively indifferent, the same situation I was also on a business trip in the breakfast restaurant. I had to wait for a cup of tea for a long time. I was upset when I had to go to the other party. When I brought it up, the waiter didn‚Äôt say a word.

msg:The worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. The facilities are totally not up to the five-star standard.
1. The hair dryer is actually the kind of old hair dryer that needs to keep pressing the start button to use, and the wire is also the kind of looped wire, very short! And the contact is not good either. My friend can still use it in the bathroom, but I can't use it at all. The power supply in the room is only behind the bedside table, so I can only use it by squatting on the floor by the window and pressing the plug. Can't such a big hotel get more power supplies? ! Not at all humane!
2. The intelligence is also very poor, and the logo is not clearly written, only scene 1 and scene 2 are written. But who knows what mode scene 1 is üò¢
3. The aging of the circuit is also very serious. It trips twice a night. In the bathroom at night, all the lights go out for no reason! In the morning, the TV suddenly failed, and workers were still needed to repair the circuit in the room.
4, the attitude of the front desk is also very poor. After checking out, I wanted to use a nail clipper. The front desk staff told me that the front desk did not have it, so I asked other depar**ents to ask. Excuse me? ! Why don't you help me find other depar**ents? Even if you don't, at least let me know that you are willing to help, instead of such a perfunctory sentence.
Compared to other five-star hotels, the service is really far behind. Will not live again in the future.

msg:I have never stayed in such an outrageous Andaz, but this is also the first time I booked a hyatt hotel in China. I will never live in China again in the future. If the service is not good, please do not come to China to do business again.

1. Ctrip is not allowed to book this restaurant for hyatt points, but the Hyatt points in Hawaii Maui andaz, Mexico Cancun, and Les Cabos that we booked in the previous booking can all be points, and the service is very good. We never believe that a certain hotel group booked a hotel, but because the vacation experience was very good, this time we also chose the Shanghai andaz. Not points are not a big problem. Will not let me give bad reviews.

2. Here comes the best place
Room 1818 was given to us on the night of our stay.
After two o'clock in the morning:
I watched the movie and went to sleep, and found that there was a square and very strange pink light on the top. I didn‚Äôt know when it turned on. I pressed all the buttons and used the tablet control to turn off the light. I realized that Andaz's positioning in Shanghai turned out to be a love room. . So I called and the front desk staff sent an uncle electrician who might be the only polite electrician in the whole hotel to open the switch on the top of the closet and restart all the circuits. When the electrician left, he said, "I'm sorry, it's too late, I can't fix it carefully or it will delay your sleep." This is the only apology we received in this hotel.

3-5 a.m.:
The pink light turns on by itself two or three times to wake us up. My boyfriend learns to be an electrician every time to restart the switch. But after tens of minutes, the weird and magical lights will come on. On the phone call, the uncle mechanic got on again and pulled the cord of the pink light. At this time, the uncle leaves, the time is 4:13 (Picture 1)

For the last time, not only was the pink lamp turned on, but a light ***** on the top of the bed also turned on, and I couldn't sleep at all. Look at the watch (4:38, see Figure 2). I couldn't be too tired. I really just wanted to sleep, so I just turned off all the gates. We slept without blowing up the air conditioner.

How long did we slept in your hotel this night? Have you done all the most basic functions for people to rest?

3. This hotel is not soundproof. You can hear someone drunk in the hallway in the middle of the night, and you can hear the footsteps upstairs; the reason why we stayed in Room 1818 is because we read the comments from Ctrip netizens and said that if you are close to the elevator, you can hear the elevator. sound. The front desk said that 1818 is far away from the elevator to arrange this for us; it‚Äôs useless, people who don‚Äôt lose hearing can definitely hear it.

4. What asked me to give a negative review was the attitude of the hotel. From the midnight call to the check-out, no one said sorry; the young lady who checked out even thought it should be: "We can't help this problem arise." Yes Say sorry? And I think this reaction is very abnormal, as if this problem has occurred in this room or other rooms.

5. Finally, the new service at the same price in Shanghai is much better than this hotel; the decoration of this hotel is very strange, just like the 21st century style envisioned in the 1940 science fiction movie, the pink lights make me puzzled. . Whoever lives is unlucky. Maybe this is also the taste in the eyes of some people?

msg:The location is very good, you can feel the charming vibe of Xintiandi when you go downstairs, which makes this hotel flawless but not concealed. What needs improvement is that the toilet paper may be very damp because of the rainy season. The flushing sound of the toto toilet is loud and not very beautiful. But what I like most is the bright smile of the waiter who delivers the items, which makes people feel happy. The bedroom light control button is only when the drawer is opened, which is relatively old. Another feature is that the bedroom ceiling lights, wash basins and bathtubs are all discolored, very creative and young. The mini bar has cute white rabbits and other sweets as well as sea****. There is a charge for alcohol, but a whole bottle of wine is still quite rare.

msg:The Dragon Boat Festival experience was average. The front desk often had problems with internal communication. I asked for something three or four times, and the room card failed to open the door and elevator after three times. The attitude was very good and I was tired.
There are everything in the surrounding area, just two steps away. The decoration is suitable for couples, and the a**osphere lights are nice.

msg:Checked into room 1106, and was woken up by the sound of the air-conditioning pipe at 2:00 in the morning (the air-conditioning was not turned on at all)! In the early morning, I was forced to collect boxes and change rooms, and the next day I was told to charge the difference for renewing the room! However, no matter whether it is an ordinary room or an upgraded room, ANDAZ makes you unable to find a charging socket in the whole room, and the only socket at the bedside is loose and cannot be used! There is no way to charge at night, and there is no facial tissue in the room! The blackout curtains are not drawn tightly, and it is impossible to sleep in! When the sun rises, you can get up at any time... As someone who has stayed in various hotels on a long-term business trip, I can say with conscience that this is the worst hotel to stay in Shanghai! none of them! Andaz really made the journey more tired and sleep less! Convinced! Awesome! üôÇ üôÇ üôÇ üôÇ üôÇ

msg:The four words of being at home are really affordable! From the beautiful Miss Penny Pan at the front desk to the warm room cleaning sister on the 22nd floor, plus the decent Chinese and foreign young handsome boys and beauties in the restaurant, let us move to the famous deep pits, Jinmao and Kai after a month of staying. This feeling is not found in major hotels such as Binski. Finally, I chose to return to Xintiandi Andaz to relieve the exhaustion of living in Shanghai. I am grateful to meet and thank every Andaz employee! Love you guys!

msg:I stayed at Andaz for three nights this time, and I am very satisfied overall! The room was spacious and clean and slept very comfortably. The set package includes Andaz Lounge benefits, and there are free snacks and drinks every evening, which are very good. The service is also very good. Mr. John Tang, the foreman of guest service, is very enthusiastic. He helped us book a taxi when we left, and gave us water in hot weather. Thank you very much! The location is also very good, just across from Xintiandi, the subway to the Bund and other attractions is very convenient, I will stay here again in the future.
