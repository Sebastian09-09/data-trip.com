The rooms are modern and comfortable. When I was there the weather was dusty and smoggy, so the view weren't as stunning as they could have been.
The breakfast buffet had lots of choices and was hot and satisfying each time.

There is a fantastic Western style breakfast and the large open spaces in the lobby make this a lovely entrance. It's a little pricier than the Orange hotel though - but I guess for a 5 star it's very good value. There are not many places apparently that accept tourists so this is a bonus. the Orange does though (at the point of writing this) and given their modern feel, location and cost was better value though.

They say they offer an airport shuttle if given prior notice but when I wanted a shuttle service, they said the drivers would not take us to the airport so early so had to find my own taxi. When leaving they also said that I had made a scorch mark on the ironing board cover which I did not but because of language barrier, I could not argue. They said they would deduct ¥50 from my deposit but I have yet to have the balance of my ¥500 returned to me. I do not recommend staying at this hotel - our stay at Luxemon Qinibagh Hotel was much better. I am sorry I moved!

msg:Today I especially want to give a thumbs up to the lobby manager Amy Zulla and the front desk manager Elias of the Radisson Blu Kashgar. I took the night train and arrived at the hotel early in the morning. The two did not ask me to check in at noon as usual, but upgraded the room level when there was no similar room so that I could check in and rest. I was very moved by this concept of considering the guests, and it also eliminated my worries about traveling to southern Xinjiang alone. Manager Ai is very professional and dedicated. I often see him in the lobby when I go in and out, and he can remember my last name very accurately and greet me warmly. The service management in the lobby and restaurant is particularly good. The staff are all good at Chinese and their appearance and dress are very decent, which makes the guests feel at ease and happy. I will stay at the Radisson Blu Kashgar Shenzhen next time, and I am willing to recommend guests to Manager Ai!

After returning to Kashgar from the Pamir Plateau, especially after climbing the 7,688-meter Muztagh Ata Peak, I needed a good rest. Before I arrived at the hotel, the room had been arranged and confirmed to be clean and hygienic. 2 The Western restaurant is convenient, the order is fast, and the price-performance ratio is high. 3 There was a friction problem when parking by car, and Bijiaji quickly helped to contact the duty manager to coordinate and solve it. Thank you very much! Staying in this hotel in this border town feels more intimate on the basis of safety. If I go to Kashgar again in recent years, I will continue to stay and recommend friends to stay.

msg:The first time I came to southern Xinjiang, I stayed in Kashgar for 4 days. I stayed in a hotel near the ancient city for one day and stayed in the Radisson Hotel for three days. I still think the Radisson Hotel is worth the money. Convenient parking, first-class hardware facilities, rich and superb breakfast 👍, and the hotel service is even more first-class 👍, especially the guys at the lobby front desk, Aikebaier of the Golden Key, the handsome Bijiaji, etc., all took the initiative to introduce the hotel service facilities and travel suggestions, and they responded to our requests, making us feel like we were back home! I will choose the Radisson Hotel next time I come to Kashgar.
A small suggestion: whether the hotel considers adding shuttle bus vans to and from the ancient city, hotel-Khan Bazaar-East Gate of the Ancient City-West Gate of the Ancient City-Id Kah Mosque-Hotel, so that a circle will not exceed 1 hour, 1 car is enough in the off-season, and up to 3 cars can be used in the peak season. Many hotels in Hong Kong have similar circular shuttle bus services, which bring great convenience to guests and better reflect the grade of the hotel under controllable costs.

There was a humidifier and more than 10 bottles of mineral water in the room. The service of the catering depar**ent is also great. The breakfast is a typical Cantonese style, which is very characteristic of Shenzhen Aid Xinjiang Hotel. It is a surprise to be able to eat authentic Cantonese porridge, dim sum, and French toast in Kashgar. In comparison, Xinjiang cuisine is not up to standard, and the big plate chicken tastes so-so. The next day, the Han girl at the front desk helped us stop a taxi to the airport for a long time. Thank you. Overall, I highly recommend everyone to stay.

During the past few days in Xinjiang, the hotels or B&Bs we stayed in were relatively dry and hot at night. Although the air conditioning in this hotel was not dry, when Charlie checked in, he heard that we were coming from the mainland and sent a humidifier to the room in advance, which was very considerate. I noticed that he was also very fluent in English, and it was impossible to tell that he was not a native English speaker. Spectecular! Check-in was fast and very professional.

The hotel service is good. The front desk upgraded us to a room with a wider view for free. The staff are quite polite.
The whole room is large, clean and tidy. The wet and dry separation in the bathroom is relatively good. The only drawback is that the bathroom has a bit of an odor. I hope the hotel can improve it.

Without saying a word, Manager Wang went upstairs to get the shoes and ran around until 12 at night. :30 to be repaired and sent back without charge. Very touched. The suite is very large, costing more than 2,400 yuan, with bedding and sofa. Very comfortable and the view outside the window is pleasant.
The front desk service is very good, the breakfast is rich and the service is good, and the Chinese restaurant is very good. It is worthy of the assistance from Shenzhen state-owned enterprises. Awesome. It is the best hotel in Kashgar. Although the price is on the high side, it is worth the money and includes free laundry. Highly recommend to stay.

Hygiene: The room is very clean, the housekeeping ladies are great👍 and the gym and swimming pool are free to use and can be used almost all day long.

Environment: There are various small restaurants and large supermarkets within a 10-minute walk.

Service: The hotel staff are very enthusiastic. The Uyghur beauty Buhai who checked in had a sweet smile, and the handsome Uyghur guy Tony enthusiastically introduced the characteristics of Xinjiang to me. Thank you to Manager Li in the lobby for upgrading me to a suite, and to the tall concierge for delivering my luggage. I can’t remember my name. It seemed like it was a competition. Uyghur names are too long and hard to remember. There are employees greeting you in every area, and I feel like I'm home.
I will choose this hotel next time I visit!

The waiter in the lobby had a bad attitude. When asked if she had a room, she kept saying there were no rooms with a cold face. However, she booked a room on Ctrip. When she entered the room, she saw old facilities. It felt like she had spent more than a thousand yuan on the room. It’s really not worth it, I feel like I’ve been cheated.

However, there was a power outage on the day of check-in, and the corridor was completely dark just as I was about to go out. Fortunately, I didn't get into the elevator, otherwise...! It took ages to get a call, but the wifi didn't start at the same time. The hotel seemed not to be surprised and did not take the initiative to explain to the guests. We did not know the reason for the power outage at the time. We lived on the 17th floor and could not go downstairs to ask how long the stay would be. We contacted Ctrip, but Ctrip customer service could not contact the hotel. There was no explanation from the hotel until the last check out.

In the afternoon, the two staff members of the executive lounge, Minaval Mina and Ma Yanxia Winnie Ma, served very thoughtfully and answered our travel inquiries enthusiastically. Seeing that I couldn't remember the name of the place, Mina wrote down the key words for us in a note, she is such a warm girl.
Mr. Pan Xingyu, the person in charge of breakfast, is an elegant gentleman who provided us with a high level of thoughtful service.

Facilities: The hotel is beautiful. We stayed in a beautiful room, and the visibility was very good on the second day of our stay. You can see the continuous Kunlun Snow Mountain directly from the bathtub window (see picture 1), which is extremely beautiful~~
The hotel is not far from the old city, and it is not expensive to take a taxi. It takes more than ten minutes to get there.
I would like to thank all the staff of the hotel for making our journey in Kashgar comfortable and enjoyable!

It is 20 yuan to take a taxi from the ancient city of Kashgar, and 30 yuan to take a taxi from the Xiangfei Tomb. The ancient city recommends 150 yuan to invite a Guli at the visitor center. Buy a 75 package ticket at the entrance of the Xiangfei Tomb, you can watch the show and have the tour guide Guli explain it. When you go out to take a taxi, pay attention to showing the map to the driver, because they can't speak Mandarin Chinese. It costs 30 yuan to pass the hotel at the airport.

The breakfast and buffet are very good. In addition to local specialties, they also provide a wealth of vegetables, fruits, seafood, etc. The service awareness is strong, especially the two staff members Steven Pan and Watson Yang are very professional. The location is far away from the ancient city, but there are many Haro mopeds in front of the hotel, which are easy to use. It takes about 20 minutes to ride to the ancient city.

In the peak tourist season, the hotel is full. But the service is good. Special thanks to Eikober and Bijaji at the front desk. Helped me check in very quickly, very patient and friendly.

Environment: The location is somewhat biased, but it only takes about ten minutes to drive to the ancient city.
 
No USB charging, bring your own plug.

Breakfast is the most hearty thing I have eaten this time from southern Xinjiang to northern Xinjiang.

The time we stayed in happened to be when the epidemic prevention in Kashgar was tightened, so I called the hotel two days before we checked in, but the answer from the switchboard was ambiguous, which made people listen. Monk Zhang Er was puzzled. He talked about the nucleic acid within 48 hours, and then said the nucleic acid report within 24 hours. Can't explain it anyway. I asked him to call the front desk. As a result, there were six times the front desk went unanswered. Leave your phone number to the switchboard and ask him to reply after saying hello. As a result, there was no reply. After checking in at the hotel, we booked a room with four twin beds. When I got to the room, it turned out to be a four-bed room. speechless. The amount of shower gel and shampoo in the room is too small, it is recommended to use more in the future.

Then my wife called the front desk and told the front desk to get a few bottles of water. The front desk gave us a very strange answer that a room can only have two bottles of water a day . What do you mean you can't take it again? At this moment, the speechless lover can only say, can you bring me tomorrow's in advance? The front desk only gave up. This behavior has made me unforgettable to this day. A five-star hotel has the style of a fast hotel. It is very strange who you are and you can check it yourself someday without contacting me. You are not allowed to drink water when you are thirsty. You are not here in Hong Kong and Macau. There is no tipping.

But there are two things: 1. When checking in, the young male waiter offered to use his private car to drop off the plane, the price was 100 yuan, and said that there is no Didi to call in Kashgar. I declined. In fact, I used the Kashgar Airport bus for only 15 yuan. 2. When returning the deposit, I clipped a broken coin, and when I gave the deposit, it was almost consecutive brand new banknotes. Why are the glued broken coins clipped in?

First of all, the location is not good and it is not easy to take a taxi. After arriving at the front desk, the male and female waiters talked about their own things and ignored us. (Including the front desk, guest room), and did not tell us at breakfast time, almost missed breakfast the next day. The room WiFi said that it can be connected directly without a password, but we have not been able to connect. After telling the front desk, no one came to solve it. In the end, we still used our own traffic. The TV in the room couldn't be turned on, so I asked the room attendant to wait for a long time before coming over, saying that the TVs in all our rooms were just like that, and we left without a way. The TVs were not fixed after we checked out. The bath towels in the room are also old, with raw edges. The price is more than 800 yuan, this towel is too bad. The sink in the bathroom doesn't run into water, so we remove the stopper and wash our face.
Finally, the breakfast is very general and there are not many varieties. What is written on the Internet is 118 yuan per serving, but the one posted at the entrance of the restaurant is 88 yuan per serving. What's the meaning? Are Ctrip's users a lot of fools and money? Speechless...

Decisively choose to change the hotel the next day, the Radisson Hotel did not disappoint me! The hardware equipment and hotel services have nothing to say, they are worthy of the international five-star chain hotel brand! The room is clean and hygienic, the toiletries are good, the rain shower has a lot of water, but the water temperature seems to be not hot enough! The breakfast variety is acceptable, the fruits are particularly rich, and the clear noodle soup is especially recommended! The location of the hotel is a little outside the city, there is no place to eat nearby, my three meals a day are resolved in the hotel, although the taste is not as good as the mainland, but it is already very good! If you come to Kashgar again next time, you must first choose the Radisson Hotel!

After checking in, when I asked when entry to the executive lounge would begin, the front desk staff closed his eyes, thought for a while, and then said, "We have to wait until the end of the month." Ha, check-in is May 1st. This is the most upscale hotel in Kashgar, but it does not meet the standards of a five-star hotel. Another point is that the air conditioner there is both cooling and heating, only cold wind. Open the window and the wind and sand are strong, and the quilt is thick, so it is not possible to cover it. If you don't cover it, you are afraid of catching a cold. The price and service do not match at all. Only the breakfast and evening buffet are acceptable.

I asked help to adjust the temperature before going out in the afternoon. When I came back in the evening, it was still very hot. The luggage was already packed in the room, and I was finally told that I could change rooms, but it was already 1 a.m., and I flew out the next morning. Xinjiang is beautiful and the people are very welcoming, but Radisson's brand and price are really not suitable for Kashgar. BTW, the service level also needs to be greatly improved. There are no waiters to carry luggage. More and more people are traveling to Xinjiang, and they also need well-known hotel brands, and they can really improve their service quality. Don't hold back Xinjiang's tourism industry!

以後有機會還會再來喀什入住麗笙酒店！

服務：因為在去塔縣的前兩天就已經入住過，感受很好，所以回喀什當晚又入住了。在前台問起是否可以升級套房時，服務生阿不都瓦依提主動幫忙免費升級套房，還送了行政酒廊的用餐券和商場購物優惠券。去了行政酒廊後，服務生米娜瓦爾熱情介紹菜品種類和擺放位置，還主動問起是否需要咖啡，並邀請我們第二天還可以繼續去用餐。在第一次入住酒店時因為要辦邊防證，服務生艾山江主動開車送我們去附近警務站辦理，辦理完後又將我們送回酒店。
體驗：總體體驗感非常好，不愧是喀什排名第一的酒店。設施和服務都是一流的。

The hot water in the room was not available until the engineer came and ran it for 20 minutes. However, the hotel manager Aiko Baier has a very good sense of service and is responsible. He gave the service a five-point rating. I hope the hotel can work hard on hardware and reach five-star standards.

msg:When you check in after two o'clock, the front desk is arrogant and makes you wait for 20 minutes, even though there is room available to clean. There is no one to pick up your luggage. They don't even show you which way to go upstairs to check in. They warn you when you go the wrong way. The shower room in the room was not hygienic, and the unopened toiletries were greasy. The service is particularly poor. I borrowed an umbrella and reported my room number but they also charged me a deposit. Because it was raining, I parked my car at the door and was not in the way. I had to move my car. I went to the parking lot to park in the evening. It was clearly empty and I didn’t let you park. In the morning, I saw that the parked area was full of cars. There were very few breakfast options. I communicated in advance that check-out would be postponed until 2 o'clock. I called you at 1 o'clock to ask if you wanted to go. After extending my stay, the cleaning staff knocked on the door again a little later and asked if the cleaning could be done now. It was completely baffling. I have never seen such a bad five-star hotel.

酒店軟件不錯，小夥子小姑娘很精神，服務品質很好。但是酒店硬件明顯老化了，電梯裏背景玻璃破碎了，還沒有修補，房間裏浴缸檢修口瓷磚已經脱落（我臨時把掉下的瓷磚放了回去），固定花灑的位置也鬆動了，搖搖晃晃。馬桶沒有衞洗麗是個遺憾。

I don’t know where the confidence of this hotel from the security guards to the waiters comes from. There are two big words on the face: "owed money". ! I usually don't leave comments like this, but the service is really bad, the equipment is old, and the toiletries are the same as those in hotels. I don't even bother to take pictures~

🚗 交通：酒店離市區是有點遠 但是不影響 酒店可以給你叫車，滴滴也很快的 因為入住了很多次所以沒怎麼拍照📷
 酒店超級方便 酒店裡麪就有做核算的地方 不用特地去醫院🏥

🧹衞生：衞生也很乾凈 酒店疫情防控做的也很棒 

🔔服務：酒店裡面有叫餐 外賣也很方便 房間也賊熱賊舒服😌 
 每次來喀什的第一選擇
