msg:The hotel’s staff were very friendly and helpful.  The hotel manager,Vincent was patiently listened and solved our questions. My husband and I stayed at the seventh floor and they’ve provided afternoon tea for the executive floor members. The executive lounge was super clean,quiet and comfortable.  We really enjoyed the afternoon tea. If there is one thing I can suggest, I will strongly suggest to change the guest room carpet  and update the hair dryer.
马可波罗酒店的前台以及其他工作人员的服务态度都非常温馨贴切。酒店经理，Vincent耐心的帮我们解决问题。八楼层的行政楼下午茶，点心虽然不多但很精致，很开心享受下午茶时光。酒店客房若能换新地毯以及吹风机，会是厦门最高级的酒店之一,因为它的地理位置优越，闹中取静，俯瞰湖景…….

msg:We recently stayed for 1 night. But we need spend more time in Xiamen for an unexpectedly long time. So, back to this hotel and stayed a few more days. We received a very warm welcome at check-in and a welcome back gift in the room. Beautiful room with a wide and nice view, good desk to do the work and a lovely sofa to relax. Neat cleaning of the room every day. We gratefully made use of the Continental Club on the 8th floor. Very tasty, high-quality and delicious food. The furnishings feel like a living room where you immediately feel at home and at ease. The wait staff is professional and friendly with an appropriate distance. The hotel manager and the relationship manager made an effort for a personal conversation. Very attentive.  Sufficiently qualified restaurants and lobby for your high tea with friends or business meetings.
Highly recommended.

The only point I would advise the hotel about is the presence of mosquitoes in some common areas.

Enjoyed the pool table near the fitness facilities, which was a nice option on a rainy day.  My second time in this hotel, and a good option near to the city centre, and halfway from there to the airport.  Recommended place in Xiamen.

The rooms and facilities are quite off considering the name brand. The lounge is nice, and breakfast was ok. I was not impressed with the pool amenities or the shower/bath/water/carpet. Please update the carpet in the rooms.  Also, there was not an option to crack open the window for fresh air. Circulating air conditioner and less than stellar pipes make it unpleasant. The staff helped with a lot. The gym area and tea time were great.

Excellent location with many restaurants linked to the hotel, we ate twice at the Thai, which was delicious and very reasonably priced. The hotel is beautiful with an old style charm, the only minor complaint is that the rooms are on the small side, but everything else was wonderful! Good sized gym, slightly small outdoor pool but didn’t feel crammed.

msg:The Marco Polo is in a great location and the cleaning staff is superb. However when we tried to check in the staff was behind on cleaning the rooms due to “Chinese New Year” I would recommend that the MP hire temp staff to accommodate for the holiday season when they know they will be busy. As we’d come in from a long flight and hadn’t had much sleep in the process, it was really disappointing to have to wait an additional 2 and a half hours to get into our rooms and sleep in our beds. The other thing MP could improve on is their amenities. Since we have to put down a hefty deposit for our room in case of room service and additional surcharge it only makes sense that we should be offered full dining options during the times stated in the menu. My friend and i went out with the assumption that we would be able to order a midnight snack due to the menu having an all day section that said certain dishes would be available from 10:30pm to 6am. We were very disappointed when we called down to discover that the only options available were noodles. We even called TRIP to try and understand the reasoning behind this change but they just sent us in a loop back to the manager on duty who had no explanation. I expect more from a five star hotel. Lastly we were put in a nonsmoking floor however throughout the week I smelled smoke several times in the halls. While the hotel had great heating a nice bath tub and a good location, I would expect for the nuisances to be absolved upon my next return.

msg:It was okay but nothing special. I was surprised that the reception was incapable of answering the easiest questions like "which places do you recommend to visit". Also I didn't like that in the (already expensive cafe) they didn't tell me -in advance - the the is a service charge as an add-on. It's not about the money of the service charge, it's about not informing me in advance. I expect such information in a professional environment. The rooms were okay. In general a good stay and I can recommend the hotel. But DON'T expect anything from the employees with regard to informations etc.

msg:When we placed this order (plus we requested), the hotel said this room is suppose to be non smoking. We could smell smoke in our room from the second day we arrived. The hotel said they could change us rooms but we are on the top floor. This is already the second hotel we have stayed in where we requested and hotel made it clear when we placed this order that room would be non-smoking. The hotel only let us use an air purifier. I don't even think hotels in China  can even claim to have non smoking rooms because they allow other guests to smoke next to your room and the smoke will travel into your room. This is not good for our health since we both have upper respiratory problems. I think hotel should enforce the rules and policies and quit falsely advertising  and misleading consumers and guests.

But the location cant be beat… Now that being said we were very disappointed with the lounge. We booked a room on the club floor only to find out its closed. So the lobby is the club lounge not wuite the same feel…. You order your drinks ( cant make them yourself ) and very little food is provided. Now i dont blame the staff as the girls went beyond trying to give us good service but at the end of the day you cant call it club room with access lounge when you are sitting in a lobby. Unless they go back to the original lounge then we will not pay extra for this service. Again the staff is amazing

Cafe street is also next to the hotel though we chose to visit Starbucks which is located in the hotel. Breakfast had a good array of Western and local food. We were upgraded to the club floor, the rooms had been refurbished. My only complaint was that the room is very cluttered. I would stay at this hotel again should I return to Xiamen

Breakfast options were varied - western and Indian. 
Check in was relatively smooth, just the usual request for multiple codes but that’s in any hotel. Concierge was extremely helpful, helped us book tickets for the ferry, spoke to the next hotel we were going to arrange a car pick up for us. I would definitely recommend this hotel. And it’s not too far from the international ferry terminal. Close to a metro stop if you plan to use public transport

My only slight problem I had during my whole stay was the piped music in the common areas of the hotel, the same music mix on about a 40 minute loop which could drive you a little crazy when sat by the pool for the day! haha

Other than that, a 99% satisfaction rating - keep up the good work Marco Polo and many thanks to your kind, attentive staff.

I asked for a soft bed and it was very comfortable.  The bathroom is a bit outdated for such a nice room but the view from the living room, a spacious desk from which to work, and a free stocked minibar made up for it.  The location is PERFECT, within walking distance of a small supermarket as well as some really delicious western type restaurants including Coyote, an amazing Mexican place, and Fanzone which had a house band and turned into a bit of karaoke as well.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and this city. It's a nice break from the hustle of the big cities.

msg:I stayed at this hotel during the Spring Festival and I was dissatisfied with two things about the room I stayed in.
1. There is no ceiling light in the room. When you go back to the room at night, you must turn on all the table lamps and even night lights to barely illuminate it. Otherwise, the room will be very dim; 2. There is a door between the room and the next room. This door has two points for the check-in experience. The biggest impact is that, firstly, the sound insulation is extremely poor, and the conversation in the next room is relatively clear, which disturbs the rest. The second is that it is not very comfortable psychologically. On the second night of the stay, around 12 o'clock, the next door room may be occupied. Having a problem with that door and tugging on that door multiple times weighs on us, at least psychologically.
To sum up, this check-in experience was quite bad. When the hotel arranged this room for us, it did not inform us that there is a door between the room and the next room. When we went out in the morning, after observation, at least most of the rooms were independent. There is no door between the room and the next door, but the hotel concealed the actual situation and arranged us a room with a door between the room and the next door. I can only think that it was intentional. The defective room was arranged first without the user mentioning it. Objections are treated as if nothing happened. It is a pity that we stayed in this room at a premium price during the Spring Festival.

The quality of the slippers is the same as that on the high-speed train. The exhaust in the bathroom does not have an independent switch, and the ventilation fills the room with a roar. There are inexplicably multiple doors in the room, so there is no sense of security. The TV is very small! There are not many breakfast styles, but the overall quality is fast! What a shame this location is!

The hotel service was good and very warm; the room facing south facing Yuandang Lake was also good; the catering (breakfast) was okay; overall I felt that this hotel was good. If there are any shortcomings, in addition to the high housing prices during holidays, firstly, the washbasin is small and shallow, and water often flows out; secondly, the damping of the toilet seat is broken, and the sound of free fall is loud.

My husband went to the front desk and asked. He said that we ate instant noodles, but we didn't eat them. And we ordered takeout when we checked in in the early morning. Who is so confused that he can't eat the midnight snack he ordered and eat your 18 bowl of instant noodles? ? ? Because we booked two rooms and have not been in that room since we came out after 10 o'clock, the hotel did not find out any truth and directly deducted the money without confirming it with us. I feel that there are still big loopholes in the hotel's management. If a cup or kettle is lost, Do we also need to take the blame for the hair dryer? I chose this hotel after reading reviews from Ctrip users, but I will definitely not stay there again next time. Think about it for a second. If I say that I lost something in your hotel room, will you directly compensate me without investigating? The only good thing I can give is to Chris at the front desk. His service was very good and he even upgraded our room type.

msg:This was an unpleasant stay experience. I booked the hotel for my parents and my daughter. Considering that the hotel is leaving the checkout and only includes two breakfasts, in order to avoid the troubles of the elderly and children, I made a special phone call to the hotel. Because the child is already 160, the breakfast fee must be charged as an adult, and I proposed to add a breakfast every day, and paid the room fee in advance. At that time, the young man at the front desk was quite enthusiastic, and added me on WeChat. The amount paid.
As a result, my parents and children went to the restaurant on the first day and told them that they only had two breakfasts in the room itself, which caused my mother to not have breakfast. I immediately contacted the hotel’s WeChat account again, and I could see it through the screenshot, but there was no news after that. I can only call the hotel front desk again.
The girl who answered the phone said, I will confirm with the restaurant for you, and I said yes, then I have prepaid for breakfast, you can see what other services can be given to my parents or children, and there is no need to refund it. Li said that I asked them if they would like to have afternoon tea, and I said yes, you can call the room and ask them, but after verification, they did not provide any additional services to my family, and the pre-charged breakfast fee was ignored.

When I checked in, I politely asked for help. The girl at the front desk looked impatient and looked up at me without raising her head🤣In order to show my cultivation, I also tried my best to squeeze out a little smile and took the Get the room card and say thank you! And the front desk still treated me like a ***~~
For a hotel with such a resounding brand, the usual training really needs to be strengthened. (a little bit of rant)
In addition, I must praise the bellmen at the door. The friendliness of the service is beyond words. It is so hot outside that they still play their role, which makes me respect them even more. A simple action "help me drag a 20-inch bag" OK." I politely tipped 40 yuan. Although it was not much, it was a sign of respect and recognition for the bellman.
The above are my thoughts on staying at Guisa store this time. I hope to see a smiling face greeting me when I check in next time~
May Marco Polo get better and better🌹

msg:Second stay. Let me talk about the summary first, Marco Polo can only make a bottom-up plan for Xiamen without a place to live in the future, but it will not take the initiative to choose.
First of all, let’s talk about the bad physical experience. The overall hotel staff worked hard to provide good service, but they were affected by individual employees, resulting in these bad memory points that left a deep impression on the guests.
Specifically, an employee at the front desk was a little impatient and rolled his eyes when he received a call from a guest. When we asked for electric mosquito coils at night, they all ran out, and instead of providing a new solution, we hung up the phone in a hurry.
In addition, the details of the room and the order are different, and I did not inform, nor did I actively follow up. We need to take the initiative to confirm and change rooms.
To put it bluntly, the hotel's facilities are ok. Although they have a sense of history, they are well maintained.
The bed was comfortable but the pillows were average.
The breakfast is quite satisfactory.
The gym and swimming pool staff work hard and are enthusiastic.
Jason at the front desk (should be called by this name, I heard it) actively solves the problem and has a warm attitude.
The location of the hotel is very good, and the overall is very quiet, especially suitable for rest. There are also some interesting shops nearby, leisurely.
The room is quiet, and the facilities will be a bit old-fashioned. I don't know why it can't be updated during the epidemic?
The lighting design of the old house type really needs to be changed.

By the way! The healthy multigrain drink machine for breakfast, eye-catching, warm and delicious, recommended!

msg:I picked this hotel during my National Day trip to Xiamen, thinking it had a bit of a brand. I thought it was old, but it said it would be renovated in 2019. I didn’t expect the hardware to be so good😰
The bathroom ceiling is dripping. The sink has cracks and the hand wash will leak. It took me back to the feeling of living in a guest house thirty years ago. The sound insulation effect is relatively poor, and guests in the corridor can often be heard talking.
The toilet button will not pop up by itself.
We managed to stay for four nights because we were too lazy to carry our luggage, so we admire our endurance.
The location is relatively good. It's not far from anywhere. There is a coffee street right at the door.
The waiters are very diligent and polite.
Really, there is no problem with the people, but the hardware facilities are not.

msg:The reason why I often stay in this hotel is that I like the surrounding environment. I must stay in a lake view room. The price is also suitable. It is relatively cost-effective in Xiamen. Because it is an old hotel, the facilities will be worse. There is no air conditioning in the lobby and aisles, and the breakfast is not good. , there were very few things, and the waiter barged into the room directly, which surprised me a little. We only drank one can of Coke in the refrigerator, and did not check with us at the checkout. Two cans were deducted, which was an extra 18 yuan. After I called to complain, the relevant personnel called me and asked me to add my WeChat account to refund the money. I refused. I should have spent tens of thousands in this hotel over the years. I still appreciate the service provided to old guests. Very uncomfortable.

One day we arrived late, and the fried dough sticks were left for a long time, and breakfast was over in 15 minutes. I just happened to see the waiter, so I asked by the way. I didn't expect the kitchen to make a special decision immediately Blow up one for me, the service attitude is very professional👍👍.
The front desk staff of the hotel are also very attentive, and specially upgraded my room to the executive floor. The side of the room faces the lake view, which is refreshing.
The surrounding environment of the hotel is quiet and comfortable. Next to it is a street of Internet celebrity bars, in front of it is a street of coffee, and behind it is a small vegetable market, and there is also a small high-end supermarket, which is very convenient for shopping.
Although the room is a bit small, it has a well-trained service attitude and quality, so I will choose this hotel again next month.

msg:I have stayed in almost all the five-star hotels in the core area of Xiamen, and the overall situation of Margo Hotel is in the forefront. The hotel is truly beautiful with beautiful scenery, quiet amidst the hustle and bustle, and convenient transportation. The facilities and services are the tonality of an old five-star hotel. The welcome card is handwritten in English. The hotel inevitably has a sense of age, but the overall architecture, design style, and service facilities reflect the high level of that era.
      The service staff is very friendly, a**ospheric, and cordial in communication. Take the child for breakfast, without worrying too much about height. The late check-out of the suite is in place. The executive lounge cocktail hour is good.
      The existing problems are basically related to "oldness".
      One is that there is really no way to change it, only the expression can be understood. For example, the room type, even a luxury suite, has only one bathroom, and there is no separate shower area. You can only stand in the bathtub and take a shower with the shower curtain closed. Hot and cold water should be adjusted separately. Another example is the room furniture, which is relatively old.
      Second, it is recommended to change.
      1. Slippers. The quality is too bad, the soles are thin and the fabric is poor, which is too rare in today's five-star hotels.
      2. For service personnel, the implementation of the first question responsibility system is not in place. I have experienced two things. One is that a car does not have a license plate and cannot automatically take pictures and raise the pole when entering the venue, so it keeps honking the horn. I kindly reminded the concierge, and the concierge said that it was a matter of security and had nothing to do with him (I do think that a car honking at the door will not only affect the a**osphere of the hotel, but also cause traffic jams); the second is that my own car has to leave the venue , the concierge went to serve other guests and was not on duty. I wrote a note and wanted to give the car number to the front desk service staff, but the service staff said it was useless to give it to her and had to wait for the concierge to come back. These two incidents show that the employees of the hotel have the mentality of "each section of the railway police is in charge", and the coordination and cooperation are not enough.
     These problems are potential details, and it does not affect that Ma Ge is a very good hotel, and I will still stay again.

msg:For so many years, I seldom give a hotel review, let alone a bad review. After all, it is not easy for everyone. It is really difficult to work in the hotel industry in recent years, and I can understand it.
But this time I'm not complaining.
First of all, the room size is too small, and the decoration of the lake view room I booked is too old. There is no ceiling light in the whole room, and the lighting is all relying on a few small lamps, which feels very depressing. Napkins are also not provided in the room.
I feel that I am not familiar enough with the business of the service. Regarding the refund of the deposit, let me complain. I checked out after 12:00 pm, but when I arrived at 5:00 pm, I did not receive any information about the deposit refund, so I called the hotel first. The front desk, the front desk said with certainty that they have done it. I checked my bank statement again and there was no refund. I called the front desk again and asked for a long time. The answer is that I will definitely refund it. Later, I said that it will be available in the account tomorrow morning.
I was speechless and fainted. If you are familiar with the business, just say that the refund will arrive tomorrow morning.
In short, this is the experience of this stay.
The photo was taken through the glass, the floor is low, and the platform is underneath. The high-rise view will be fine

msg:One of the oldest four-star hotels in Xiamen, with a superior location, beside Yuandang Lake, and the coffee street is within easy reach. The response speed of the room order should be praised. Two shortcomings: 1. The hardware facilities in the guest rooms are aging. There may be no solution to this problem unless the owner is willing to invest heavily in renovations. 2. There is a problem with the response speed of room cleaning (maybe it happened to me, not necessarily a general problem). At around 8:00 in the morning, I got up to drink water and noticed a card stuck in the door, to the effect that I could not provide room cleaning service because I reminded of Do Not Disturb. If necessary, please let me know. Around 9:30, I went out and rang the bell to remind me to clean the room. Around 11:40, I went back to my room and found it hadn't been cleaned. I called to ask for immediate arrangement. After that, I waited in the lobby bar until nearly two o'clock in the afternoon. When I went back to my room, I found it was still not cleaned. I'm really angry, I shouldn't, I hope to pay more attention in the future. PS. The Napoleon in the lobby bar and the roast suckling pig in the Lianyuan Chinese restaurant on the second floor are the best in Xiamen, and I highly recommend them.

The gym is also very good, with reasonable layout and facilities, and a good view. The room is more ordinary, not big, there is no separate shower room. The lake view room is not a front lake view either.
Special praise is the boy on duty at the front desk at 9.10pm. Because the girl at the front desk had some problems at the checkout, I was very angry at the time. But the boy handled it very sincerely, in place and decently, which turned the original bad feeling into a good feeling. There is a chance to stay again.

msg:Booked a hotel package for two nights in advance. The experience is not bad [naughty]
Originally, it was two nights with a city view king bed including breakfast plus minibar, fruit plate, daily food package for two people and afternoon tea. The total is more than 1,000, which is equivalent to more than 500 a night. However, due to the temporary change of the last day's plan, I did not experience a little bit of afternoon tea. pity. [crazy]

🌳Environmental introduction
The location is very good, near the subway entrance of Jianye Road, Siming District, only 300 meters away from the subway entrance and a few minutes walk. Next to it is Yundang Lake and Bailu Lake Park. It is quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle. It is not far from the high-speed rail station, and it takes less than 20 minutes to drive there. The hotel also has an airport shuttle service. There are many delicious shops and coffee shops around.

🏠Layout/Room Type
Originally it was a big bed room with a city view. Because we arrived late, we were upgraded to a big bed room with a lake view. Hehe 😁 The room is on the 7th floor. After looking at the room that belongs to the side, you can see the side lake view. , There is also an outdoor swimming pool on the 3rd floor.
The room is slightly smaller, light European style, and the bath amenities are elle's ok. The free minibar includes Tsingtao Beer 🍺 Coke Sprite soda, daily replenishment, regular coffee and tea, two packs of snacks, and unlimited drinking water.
It is very convenient for a business type to have an internet desk. The bathroom is glass transparent, that is, the shower needs to be in the bathtub. But after all, it is an old hotel in the 1990s, and this style is understandable. I still like the Marco Polo series. They are all complete, spare pillows, ironing, and even shoelaces and hiking routes are prepared for you. The TV is relatively small, but basically I don't watch TV anymore.

💁 Facility Services
Hotel lobby: The ceiling is very high. It seems that the hotel design of that era loved this style. It looks luxurious and a**ospheric. It reminds me that many hotels I have stayed in in India are similar, and now it feels a bit retro. More than 20 years old hotel, really well maintained.
Welcome service: very in place, from the time you get off the bus, you will help with luggage and guide you to the front desk to check in. [Naughty]
Elevator: There are several, so you don't have to wait long.
Exercise: My favorite is the 24-hour gym. For foodies, if they want to eat and maintain their body, exercising is a must. The gym has treadmills, climbing machines and iron equipment. There are plenty of water and dry towels, and the locker room is also convenient. The swimming pool is also here, there should be a small hall with billiards and a bar. After reading the introduction, it turns out that there are yoga classes on Mondays and Thursdays. The swimming pool is really beautiful at night, you can see the night view of the city on the other side of the lake, if you can take pictures, it can be very good.
Lobby bar: It's a pity that I didn't go to experience it, and the coupons were wasted.
Hotel breakfast: It's a good one. Coffee and fruit drinks are complete, there should be espresso coffee. There should be Xiamen-specific noodle paste and peanut soup, and the noodles are also delicious. There is also a favorite croissant, which combines international Chinese and Western styles with Xiamen's local breakfast bar.
General Japanese: The lunch coupon given is a set meal, one person eats the portion for two people haha, only two main dishes are served, the side dishes are the same, and the side dishes are not repeated. The environment is very good. house. The taste is passable. If you eat Japanese food, you still have to look at sashimi, sushi and roasted birds, but I didn't try it this time.
Disadvantage: Well, I forgot to ask if the fruit plate was not delivered. And after 12 o'clock in the evening, the front desk phone was called and no one answered, I don't know why

Let's talk about the advantages: the room is big, the view is good, the afternoon tea and light meals in the executive lounge are very satisfactory, and the concierge staff are very polite!
Disadvantages: The front desk arranged a problem room 701 for my parents. As soon as I entered the room, I saw that the engineering depar**ent was repairing the TV. After repeated debugging, I finally changed a TV. The sewers in the room always smelled bad. Every time I entered the room 701 of my parents, I felt the stench was overwhelming. I wanted to change a room, but my parents were old and inconvenient to move. After packing the luggage, I gave up. There is also the shower room. Please go and see. Is the shower head fixed in the shower room crooked? The water flows to one side, and people can only take a bath against the wall. For three days in a row, I can imagine how my parents took a bath and endured the stench of this sewer. Another problem is that the hotel is being renovated. There will be noise in the middle of the night and in the morning. The elderly have very short sleep. They say that they have not had a good rest.
Summary: The front desk staff were cold. . . Since it is a problem room, why did the front desk arrange for us to stay? We are bringing the elderly and children and do not need your extra care. Is it so difficult to arrange a normal room? We were so disappointed in the specially booked distinguished lake view room, we can imagine what the basic room type will be like. Be careful when booking!

When checking in, the front desk will upgrade to a lake view room for free. Later, because the lake view room had a bathtub, it was inconvenient for the parents to use, so the front desk changed the room type. Considering taking our parents with us, the front desk manager provided us with great courtesy, thank you very much for the front desk manager 👍! The room type includes lunch, but sometimes it is not possible to have lunch in the itinerary. The front desk staff also flexibly arrange the date of lunch according to our requirements. Thank you very much 👍! The aunt in the room is very friendly and will ask the needs of the guests, and the service awareness is professional👍. In and out of the hotel, the concierge staff opened the door in a timely manner, polite and dedicated. We need cardboard boxes for checked luggage, and the concierge staff provided it in time for us, thank you very much👍! Very satisfied with the experience of staying at the hotel this time👍!

msg:Overall a very comfortable stay, will definitely come back again. When I first arrived, the concierge was very enthusiastic to help open the door and take luggage; the check-in at the front desk was also very fast, and explained various services and facilities in detail.

The back is a very good experience in the buffet breakfast and Japanese restaurant, the food is also delicious!

The swimming pool looks good too, it must be very comfortable when the weather is warm

The room is very comfortable, but it can be seen that it is a little old, and the central air conditioner is not very strong; the hot water pipe for the bath is also a bit out of time. However, someone came to solve the problem immediately after the feedback.

The surroundings of the hotel are quite quiet. Apart from the Duji Lake, it is also close to the subway. The transportation is convenient and the environment is pleasant. Incidentally, the hotel’s Napoleon cake is superb. I really recommend it and never step on the thunder.
I dare not say Marco Polo Hotel is the best in Xiamen, but it is definitely a great choice in Xiamen.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. Facing Yundang Lake, it takes one minute to walk out of the hotel to the lake. The scenery is excellent. Buses and subways around the hotel are very convenient.
Besides the hotel itself, the service has nothing to say, worthy of five stars. But the age of the hotel is a bit long, and although the room facilities are well maintained, they are still a bit old. Because it is a patio structure, all room doors face the corridor, the corridor space is large, and the echoes are obvious. All room doors are basically not soundproof. When you pass by the door of your room, you can hear your speech, especially at night! The bathroom is a bathtub, so if you take a shower, you need to stand in the bathtub. First, it is very inconvenient, and second, there are potential safety hazards, especially when there is water on the bathroom floor, wearing the slippers provided by the hotel is very slippery! Very slippery! In Xiamen's weather, you need to shower every day, so it is not recommended to live with children and the elderly. At the same time, the hotel is a foreign-related hotel, and there are foreigners living there. The foreigners basically don't wear masks. I saw it when I first checked in, and I was a little murmured in my heart. I really don't want to change the hotel. Generally speaking, the service can be scored full marks, and the hotel hardware can only be scored 50 points.

At about 3 pm, there was a sudden power outage and the fire alarm was broadcast, urging me to escape by stairs. I dragged my 82-year-old mother who suffered from heart disease and severe leg disease from the 5th floor to the first floor with difficulty. I found the lobby receptionist and was told that it was a fire drill. Since then, my mother's knees have been in so much pain that she can't walk. I would like to ask why no one told me that there was a fire drill at 3 pm when I checked in. Secondly, when the alarm sounded, we opened the door to the corridor and did not meet a floor attendant to provide guidance. It was really a bad experience.

But——the surface of black furniture will look greasy due to scratches and scrub marks. The allocated "lake view room" just doesn't have a lake view but is located in a corner. You can only squeeze to the window to see the lake, and you can still see the side window. The various scenery in the room included a naked uncle standing by the window, so I didn't see much. The service is dedicated and professional but not humane enough, including when checking in at the front desk and spending in the lobby downstairs, I feel that the waiter is not smart enough in reminding consumption and dialogue and communication about check-in issues, and I hope to improve as a five-star hotel as much as possible.

The facilities are easy to build, but the heritage and service quality of the old hotels are unmatched by many new hotels. The location of the west embankment cannot be replicated either.
After I stayed for two nights, I changed to a new hotel, but I stayed for one day. My husband felt that the buffet breakfast and the location of the hotel were not as good as Marco, so I had to leave the remaining two days and move back to Marco.
The small downside is that the room has a faint smell. I don't know if it's a refurbished carpet or something. My sensitive nose can smell it, but my husband said he didn't smell it.
In addition, I suggest that families with small children can arrange other rooms in other directions or downstairs. Our first night listening to kids bouncing around in the upstairs room until well past 11. Through such a thick carpet, I can still hear and really speechless...

Although it is a bit dated, the style of the hotel is very unique, just like staying in a European hotel. The service staff in the lobby are all in suits and shoes, and they are very stable. The attitude is kind. The bathroom in the lobby room is very clean. Personally think it is worth recommending. I booked a twin room, but the size of the bed is not about 1.2 meters as described on Ctrip. It is only about one meter. This caused trouble for us to take the children out. Hope to improve this data. The surrounding facilities are quite good, it should be the rich area of Xiamen. More suitable for business accommodation.

The room facilities are a little bit old, which is mainly reflected in the slower running of the bathtub during the shower. Will choose here next time.

廈門住了很多星級酒店，綜合下來馬可波羅的感受最讓人失望。
酒店整體偏老舊，年代感強。地庫限高一米八，房間小而暗，早餐單調味差。下午一點多到酒店，到傍晚還住不進去。到前台投訴協調才給了間打掃好的房間。春節期間人數多，打掃衞生的服務員都滿負荷運轉，各方面有延遲可以理解。但酒店管理層未及時應對調整就有待商榷。

環境設施：我住的房型在8樓，風景好、較為安靜，隔音效果好，房間也很安靜，房間裏面燈光較暗適合情侶入住！迷你酒吧的酒水食物均有標明價格！
特色服務：由於這次時間較短，個人原因沒有體驗酒店早餐、下午茶和行政酒廊，但是包含在房費套餐裏個人感覺很划算！
改進方向：停車場通道較窄、行駛時有些害怕剮蹭，出停車場需要按鍵，我坐車裡按不到哈哈哈不過門衞叔叔人很好！！
