Nearly 500 a night, there are only two bottles of free water, which is really too stingy. There is only one side of the bed with a socket.
No disposable bath towels and towels are provided, which are too dirty.
No alcohol wipes are provided to disinfect the toilet seat.

They think they are the best in the area. They basically reply to service questions in a condescending manner. The experience is very bad. At around 7 o'clock in the morning, they were woken up by calls from guests in other rooms. They said they didn't know who called and couldn't solve the problem. The service attitude and service awareness really need to be improved. The breakfast is very ordinary, and the milk is basically not authentic? There is no executive lounge in the executive room. The swimming pool and gym in the introduction facilities are actually charged separately. The house is large and high, but it looks very empty. The furniture is not placed reasonably. Some things that should be equipped, such as coffee tables, are not available for two people.

By the way, I asked the front desk, is there no service staff to help deliver it? The other party was playing with his mobile phone with his head down, and he replied that there is no such service without looking up. Very cold, this should not be a problem in a star-rated hotel, at least a warm reply is required. There is no waiter like that. It is past eleven o'clock the next day. I remind you that when you check out at two o'clock in the afternoon, you will feel uncomfortable. First of all Asked whether to continue the stay, told not to stay for a while to check out, and directly replied "before two o'clock" in a tone that felt like a government official notifying his subordinates, and felt uncomfortable.

msg:The hardware of this hotel is really good, the price is not too expensive, and the price/performance ratio is quite high. But, but, but, the front desk staff I came into contact with when I checked in was the worst I've ever seen! The service awareness is relatively poor, the business level is relatively poor, the work efficiency is not high, and there is a lack of training and assessment. At the same time as I checked in, the two staff at the front desk, besides me, had a guest who consulted. The room was full at that time, and the guest who consulted had no room and was introduced to the apar**ent. It's time for me to handle it, so I gave the ID card to Zhang Shuo, the front desk clerk! Holding the ID card, Zhang Shuo didn’t go through the formalities for me as soon as possible, but chatted with another staff member next to me while going through the formalities. There were no rooms, the reservation was full, and the team was picked up. During the period, he stopped his hands from time to time. I even chatted with the staff next to me, until the staff next to me realized that it was not appropriate to leave me, the only customer at the front desk, there, and told Zhang Shuo, "You go through the formalities for the guests first", and Zhang Shuo came back He continued to handle the formalities for me, and received two more calls during the period, and stopped handling business for me while answering the phone. Until I said, I'm sorry, can I finish my business first, I have been waiting patiently with restraint. Zhang Shuo actually said that she was very busy and was answering the phone just now! At this point, I am the only guest, and the hotel leader can watch the video, how long has she been doing it!
Once again, I seriously criticize Zhang Shuo, the receptionist of Jiujiang Hotel. If the hotel management pays attention to it, they can get the video of the front desk. Zhang Shuo is very slow in his work. Although I was very restrained at the time and did not have any conflicts, I could see very clearly that it was just slowing down. Zhang Shuo's service awareness was too far from the hotel's positioning, which made the guests feel very bad.

The toilet is an electric toilet and the electric curtains in the house. The biggest advantage is that it is very close to the Tianyuan Valley Resort, which is very convenient. This time I went to Tianyuan Valley to coincide with the opening of the Oktoberfest and the Rubik’s Cube Kingdom Music Festival. The night was very lively. There is a Wuzhou Bathing Palace in the surrounding area where you can take your children to go to the hot springs and play on the trampoline, and the price/performance ratio is very high. The hotel breakfast is quite satisfactory, you can eat, and the price is reasonable. I will choose this hotel next time I visit Qian'an.

房間的水温比較低，洗澡很冷，放到浴缸泡澡也很冷，最後加了三壺熱水壺的水，才勉強不哆嗦。
退房時沒有讓我們等查房，就説可以了，按金會原路返回。然後離開了20分鐘後，按金退了，扣了12元。到現在為止沒有人跟我們解釋扣的是什麼錢。
入住全程我們用了牙刷，浴袍，拖鞋，浴缸袋，沒有看到任何一項寫着付費使用。
9點去吃早餐，閉餐了，可是入住的時候明明説的早餐到10點。最後總結就是，早餐沒吃上，莫名扣了12元。
此次行程遇到的其他唐山人都很熱情很友好。唯獨最後一晚選擇打卡網紅酒店，讓我們很後悔。
希望以後打卡的人好運。
