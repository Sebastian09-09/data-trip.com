The dim sum on the second floor (I think ot is 2nd floor, I  not too sure as I am writing this review aost 10 days after) is also delectable!

The five-star Holiday Inn I booked is next to the subway station in the city center, which is very convenient for shopping and sightseeing! The city's attractions can be reached by subway, and you can call Didi if you are in a hurry. I missed the flowering season of the garden city in May, but it's okay! I work hard to make money and hope to come again in April next year, specifically to see the #romantic flower sea... It's my first time in Nanning, and the transportation in this city is so convenient #two-rail travel. The night market also makes me feel like I can't leave. Eating, drinking, playing and taking pictures, leaving me with good memories!

The breakfast is very rich, with noodles, hot dishes, sushi and pastries, and the taste is really good. The front desk is very polite and the service attitude is particularly good. I especially thank Miss Aili at the front desk for helping me change the room in time and delaying my check-out. I will stay at this hotel next time I come to Nanning.

You can take the subway to the hotel. It takes only 15 minutes to get to the East Railway Station, and it is only a few stops away. It is convenient and fast. When checking out, Miss Anna asked about the stay experience and gave a small gift. I will come back next time if I have the chance.

The hair dryer was pulled out of the socket many times due to vibrations, and the shower leaked water from the gaps and flooded the floor. The air conditioner button looked like it was about to fall off. I was really disappointed because I had high hopes for a 5-star hotel.

msg:The location of the hotel is good, very close to the subway entrance, convenient for travel, and there are Mixc and Shengtiandi nearby, so you don't have to worry about eating. The overall hardware facilities of the hotel are OK, but the service does not meet the standards of the InterContinental Hotel. My wife and I brought our two-year-old child with us from the beginning. No one came to help with the luggage, and no one came to greet us. We had to go to the front desk to check in. The front desk service was pretty satisfactory. The variety of breakfast is not as rich as described in the comments. Of course, everyone has different dietary standards. For example, the noodles for breakfast are not freshly cooked, but have been cooked in the kitchen and then boiled. The taste is not good. As an InterContinental Hotel, there is not even a child guardrail. I don't understand it. Are the management standards of InterContinental Hotels in each region different?

Next to the hotel is Vientiane City. There is also an ASEAN Shengtiandi shopping mall nearby, where there are many places to eat. The place is right out of the hotel and you can reach the subway station, which is very convenient for eating, drinking and traveling. The hotel lobby is very elegantly designed. I would like to thank Xiao Shi at the front desk for the warm reception and upgrade of our room. The bed in the room was very comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and equipped with a bathtub. The breakfast room on the 17th floor has a very nice environment and a wide variety of items. The hotel staff are very welcoming, and Manager Chen at the front desk was very thoughtful and gave me a small gift when I checked out. The experience of staying at the Crowne Plaza Nanning this time was really good, making people feel at home. Very recommended!

Equipment: The shortcoming is the hair dryer in the room. When I checked in, the hair dryer was covered with oil. Apparently the equipment was not checked after the previous guest left. The interface was still broken after changing it once. I had to change it to another model for the third time before it could be used.

Service: I waited for five minutes when I checked in after checking out. There was no staff at the location. However, I lost my tag and called the hotel. They checked the information responsibly and solved the problem.

In addition, it is worth mentioning that the gym is great, with a lot of equipment and a separate yoga room and stretching equipment, which is a surprise.

He took the initiative to ask for birthday benefits and immediately called A colleague came and arranged a birthday cake (the cake was delicious 😋). The star service did not keep up in advance. The hair dryer socket in the bathroom was not working. I didn’t want to bother changing rooms, so I asked the front desk to send a wiring board. I had to drag it away. It worked when I went to the tea place, but the ward check was not in place. When I checked in, I was told that I would stay for three consecutive days, and I was charged for three days. However, when I came back the next afternoon, I could no longer use the elevator. I went back to the front desk to try it again. The other card was not with me. I wanted to do it when I went out in the evening, but the front desk was busy and they just said perfunctorily, please wait a moment. No one looked up to ask the guest holding the room card what happened! When I got impatient, I left directly and got the card back again when I came back in the middle of the night. When I left at noon the next day, I hung the cleaning sign on the door, but when I returned to the room at three o'clock, it was still not cleaned, so I had to ask someone to come immediately. The original plan was to go back to the room and take a nap right away.

There are a lot of delicious food nearby, all within walking distance, and the gym is on the first floor, fully equipped like a professional gym. Ms. Zhu upgraded the room for me when I checked in. I worked in the hotel room early in the morning, with a wide view and the rain scene outside the window. When it’s check-out time but the flight time is still early, you can continue to order a cup of coconut milk at the drink bar on the first floor, and continue working quietly. There are three types of plugs in the room, which is very considerate. I planned to go downstairs in the middle of the night to borrow a power bank.

Heart, there are masks and disinfectant wipes, the bed is equipped with a three-point charging cable (this is the only one among the nearly 10 five-star hotels that have stayed in this year), and a dehumidifier (for people who live in the north all the year round, it is really friendly ).
The breakfast on the 17th floor of the hotel has a rich variety (especially western point), and the rice noodles with local specialties (old friend soup) are delicious.

[Service] The service in the restaurant is not good (no seating, no active asking if you want coffee/tea). The service at the front desk is equally difficult. I booked a family room, but this type of room is no longer available. I upgraded it to a yellow duck theme room (but my child has grown up, and the tent in the theme room takes up a small space, which is very tasteless). There are even bigger problems with this room. It is highly suspected that other guests are not satisfied with this room, and the hotel compensated us for the room we booked. The concierge service at the door is good.
[Room room] The most dissatisfied part of this trip is that I never imagined that the bedding can be so wet. The dehumidifier equipped in the room is full of water every 4-5 hours, and my wife has red spots on the legs the next day (extremely itchy, highly suspected of mites). The toilets are cramped, the toilet doors affect the use of the washbasin, and the floor-to-ceiling windows need to cross the bathtub for ventilation...
[Facilities] The facilities are old, not like the hotel opened in 2019, nor does it conform to the brand positioning of Crowne Plaza. The 2 USB charging ports at the head of the bed were faulty and could not be charged. The sockets of many sockets are very tight and difficult to plug in and out. The ventilation switch of the floor-to-ceiling windows is concealed and difficult to rotate. The switch operation icon card provided when the room is cleaned the next day is contrary to the icon on the floor of the floor-to-ceiling window. After actual measurement, the card is wrong...
[Dining] Breakfast is very average, quasi-four-star level, and the juice is not freshly squeezed.

The doorman at the door is very attentive and thoughtful, which is in sharp contrast to the one-night-a-night hotel next door. It is also within walking distance to Grandma's Handicraft in Vientiane City, and there are many places to eat around.
Front desk service staff: Very good attitude, caring, and very strong sense of service. As soon as we saw a child, we immediately gave out drink coupons, small toys, and children's toiletries.
Hotel environment: The lobby is very a**ospheric and comfortable, which is very suitable for punching in and taking pictures. Looking out of the room is a place surrounded by greenery, very comfortable😌
The price/performance ratio is really high... When you meet the staff during your stay, they will greet you warmly. These small details are worthy of being the best, but it's a pity that I only stayed for one night and then went elsewhere. I suggest that you stay here without hesitation...

msg:Arrived at the hotel around 11pm. The lights on the dome of the lobby shine on the quiet environment and the front desk of the hotel. Watching the service staff check in softly and quickly, it gives people a very warm feeling. Maybe it was the empty period before the 5.1 festival, and the night was approaching, and there were not too many guests coming in and out; because of the fatigue of the journey, I felt hungry after checking in to the room. I called the hotel to ask if the hotel had room service, and the front desk replied "sorry The kitchen is closed, and you can order takeaway from nearby." The reply is still understandable. Through the food delivery platform, the family quickly received different takeaways in the hotel lobby. I ordered a beef rice roll and slid it into my mouth with a snort. To be honest, after traveling all over the years, I feel that rice rolls made from rice in Guangdong (especially Guangzhou, Shenzhen, including Chaoshan) are not as good as rice rolls from Hunan and Guangxi (including Guizhou). I don’t know why? After supper, look around the decoration and layout of the guest room, a well-behaved five-star standard (why there is no night delivery service), clean, comfortable and tidy, located in the center of Nanning, from the floor-to-ceiling windows of dozens of floors Looking out, the night view of Nanning is still quite bustling, full of high-rise buildings and interlaced roads illuminated by colorful lights, which have changed quite a lot in recent years. Although it was raining outside the window, it had a different smell. The breakfast is on the 17th floor. There are many varieties and the quality is very good. Compared with the breakfast varieties of many five-star hotels I have stayed in, the breakfast variety is richer and more exquisite, and the waiter's service is also very professional. Thumbs up for the executive chef of the hotel👍Before leaving, the front desk gave us a rabbit plush doll. My wife is a rabbit and was very happy. After returning home, I placed it on her piano and said to me: Come to Nanning next time Also live in this hotel.

⚠️ There are two main disadvantages:

1. There is no supply of hair conditioner in the bathroom and it can't be squeezed out.
2 is also the main problem. The hotel's own hair dryer doesn't match the hotel's positioning too much. It's been a long time since I've seen a hair dryer like this. It's too small, probably in the early ten centimeters. The line must also be pulled very close otherwise the plug will fall off. Sisters with slightly longer hair should pay attention⚠️When blowing, the hair is easy to roll in from the back (the hair dryer is too short).

msg:【Eternal Crowne Plaza Nanning City Center】——Very suitable for business people who are new to Nanning
This store is located directly above Exit B of ASEAN Metro Station, only 20mins drive from Nanning East Station, the transportation is very convenient~
There is a very gorgeous spiral staircase in the hotel lobby, and there are four elevators leading to the guest rooms for guests on the 20th floor.
It's a pity that the hotel's swimming pool is not open. Only the gym and yoga room are left.
The 32nd floor of the hotel is the executive lounge, and the executive rooms are basically in the corridor and above.
The number of ordinary luxury rooms is not high, but the scenery is good, because there are not too many high-rise buildings around to block the line of sight, you can see the road below is a highlight ⭐️
The hotel room facilities are still complete, the wardrobe is too small, and the TV is a bit outdated. After all, in a newly opened hotel with a non-advanced TV, there will be a gap.
There are two air purifiers next to the bed, and one of them is very noisy, which can easily affect sleep💤
The shower room in the bathroom is still small, the mobile shower 🚿 is a bit out of tune, the water in the spout is uneven, and the bathtub 🛁 is still large, but the bath salts that should be matched are not actively matched, so you need to call 📲 to collect them; the bathroom door is hygienic If you don't do it right, you can wipe off a lot of fingerprints left by just wiping it with a tissue 👋
It is very good that the room has a corner arc wall design, if this is missing, I am afraid the room grade will be lowered
Breakfast is located on the 17th floor 🍴 The variety is quite complete, the only bad thing is that the cups in the drinking area 🚰 are disposable, the glass or ceramic cups that should have appeared have been replaced, and I always feel uncomfortable
The front desk service of the hotel is also good. If members can get a drink coupon every time they come, I believe that the impression points can be doubled~

The platform is very bad, and it has risen by a hundred yuan in the past on the 11th holiday.
"First time in Nanning
The location of the hotel is very good. It is the CBD of the new city. There are subway stations around, so it is more convenient to drive.
The spiral staircase in the lobby is very beautiful. The lady at the front desk, Eva, is even more beautiful. She thoughtfully explained the hotel's extra trea**ent and Nanning's epidemic prevention policy. She gave an executive light meal (similar to happy hour in the lounge) every day at noon and evening, and helped to upgrade In the view room, the view from the window is not bad.
Although the building where the hotel is located is not low (p3 left), it only rents the 20th to 34th floors as guest rooms. Skyline lovers recommend choosing the luxury collection or Shangri-La next to it (but it is much more expensive).
The overall hardware facilities of the room are OK, the standard five-star level, but there are two regrets. First of all, lighting, as the most important part of creating an indoor a**osphere, has been ignored here. Many cold light lamps are used in the room instead of fluorescent lamps, such as p5 toilet room and bedside spotlights, for some reason; secondly , the sliding door facing the room was blocked (probably due to moisture-proof considerations), the view was not wide enough when taking a bath, and the experience was not very good.
There is a problem with the coordination between the hotel and the owner's property. The property security guard on the driveway has an arrogant attitude and no basic service awareness.
On the whole, Crowne Plaza is a benchmark at the price of 500 yuan, a stable choice. "(Adding a ticket is a bit expensive)

Xiao Zhou and Xiao Pan saw that I brought a child and specially upgraded the view room on the 30th floor. The view is very good. Just open the curtains and you can see the Ferris wheel. It is very beautiful when the lights are turned on at night, and children like it very much. The room is well-equipped and cleaned very well, and the children's toiletries and masks are also provided, which is so considerate. Each room is equipped with a separate bathroom space and bathtub, and the separation of dry and wet is very hygienic. The most important thing to choose here is the indoor heated swimming pool. There are not many people taking children to swim at 10 o'clock in the morning. It is the first time for children to come to the swimming pool. The water temperature is suitable. The most praiseworthy thing for you is the water delivery robot. The children opened the door and saw a pleasant surprise, cute fat doll, very convenient~~ I left the next day to go to another city to do a nucleic acid, and asked the lady at the front desk. , I recommended the place where nucleic acid is done next to it, and it is very close and few people. All in all, it was a very pleasant trip~~

msg:I read the reviews on the Internet and compared the Marriott Luxury Collection and Shangri-La in the same area. It was quite tangled at the beginning. Some of the comments did dissuade me a bit 😀. Also read some good reviews that the service of the hotel staff is also very friendly. Room hygiene is also ok. Later, with the idea of giving it a try, I first called and consulted some of the hotel's facilities and supporting facilities. The person who answered my call was Bonnie at the front desk, who enthusiastically and proactively informed me about my problem, which gave me a good first impression. Then I chose to book this hotel. Maybe the location of this store is good. When I checked in, I queued up a bit. Miss Tang, who received me, helped me upgrade my room type for free to a room on a high floor. I was tired from working in the evening and looked downstairs and had a panoramic view of Minzu Avenue. The room hygiene is also very clean and meets the five-star standard. Although the swimming pool is equipped with fitness, it is not used. It's a pity. . . Overall it was a very good stay experience!

msg:The room is small, and the musty smell is very heavy. When I changed a room, I encountered a dehumidifier. It was also very heavy when it was on 24 hours a day. At first, the phone was broken, and I replaced it with another one. After watching the TV, there was no sound. I had to restart the phone to hear the sound. If I wanted to change to another channel, I had to restart the phone to hear the sound. I simply showed my child's mobile phone, but the roller shutter in the bathroom could not be opened. It was said that it was broken and had to be repaired. The parent-child room just had an extra tent and a doll, and the space structure was unreasonable, not a boxy apar**ent. If the space is too small, it should not be a parent-child room. The sense of service is weak. We booked three nights, but the room card was set for one day, which led to the inability to go to the elevator, and the two children fell asleep, which made people angry. For this reason, they gave small gifts. Not enough attention, our two children have registered at the front desk, a gift will inevitably be arguing, do not ask you to send an expensive gift, at least be careful, when you check out on the third day, you will be given two cola and 4 drink coupons at the bar, This makes people laugh and cry. Before I checked in, I asked if there was an airport pick-up service. I should have known that we were going to take a plane. This drink coupon and Coke are really not suitable for us. We have no friends to meet at the hotel for 3 days. Filed for us, checked out for us. This detail doesn't work! Five-star hotels, including Crown Hotel, are not worthy of this positioning in terms of hardware and services. It feels like a boutique hotel inside and out. Finally, I commend the two boys working in the concierge depar**ent. They are very enthusiastic and serious, and they have helped a lot in these three days. Thanks both.

It is very convenient for self-driving or public travel. Self-driving is downstairs in the B3 parking lot. Every time you scan the fare, you can go out to Metro Line 1. It is easy to go to other areas. The service of Bonnie who helped me check in was very good. He helped upgrade the high-floor double room, and the view on the National Avenue is good. The hotel's spiral staircase and background wall attracted a lot of people to check in. The room is also very clean and tidy. The overall service is very good and the price is very high. The swimming pool fitness is open normally, and the matching ratio is also possible. Worth staying again. Thanks again Bonnie for the warm reception!

In addition, Xinkai gave up Luxury Collection and Shangri-La and chose CP; 2. There was a phone call on the day of check-in, saying that the room was full today, but it was just to confirm whether I would go there or not. This is understandable; 3. The staff at the front desk wrote my room number incorrectly that night, so I ran I tried to swipe the card on the wrong floor, I thought the card was invalid, but when I thought I could swipe the elevator card, the card was OK. I called the switchboard and was told that I was a different room number because the staff made a mistake and promised to send fruit to make up for it. , Fortunately, no one stayed in the room I went to clean, otherwise it would be a big problem; 4. The next day I came to the restaurant for breakfast, and the guest asked casually: Which room? (I answered the room number mechanically, thinking what kind of service is this???) Immediately, I looked at her standing posture, with her back to the dining table and her hands on the reception desk, fiddling with her mobile phone, her legs still up, seeing this, okay… . And then found out that the five-star is a paper cup? ! Oh, it is estimated that the epidemic has affected the cost of control, but aren&#39;t we calling for carbon neutrality and no-waste hotels? Why are so many disposable paper cups used... The wonderful scene is here, when it&#39;s time to receive the meal, I look around for a week and there are still many guests, but the staff quickly operates the menu to accept the menu, the sugar cup on the table, etc. The key is that there is no Asking the guest who was having breakfast directly took all the things in front of him. I couldn&#39;t help but ask, I&#39;m still having breakfast, can you ask the guest when you accept this? The staff looked embarrassed and put down the sugar cup, and then I saw an extra mustard on the side of the table? ? ? Excellent! 5. The check-out speed is OK, and the invoice and water list are prepared in advance, praise! All in all, the service is remarkable, and the content is a little detailed and lengthy, and I hope to see it; at the same time, the management team has a long way to go and needs to improve the service quality.

msg:Especially for a brand hotel that I want to complain about, if I am InterContinental, I would consider withdrawing the license. First of all, the owner should be a small owner? For those who are stingy and reluctant to spend money, it is more appropriate to change the card to the Express Hotel. Guest room supplies and decoration materials are all worse than Jinjiang Inn... Hair dryers, kettles, toilets, showers, small refrigerators are all local brands that have not been heard of. Among them, 39 hair dryers are free of charge, and 69 of the United States are at least one. I've heard that I won't blow dry for half an hour without drying. It takes 3 minutes to wash the faucet throttle to wash your hands. The Philips TV looks like an OEM. Carpets and wallpaper are really inferior to Holiday Inn Express. The floor stones are cracked and yellow, and the wood finishes are covered with hair balls...
Secondly, the sanitation of the housekeeping depar**ent is in a mess. Save detergent, it turns yellow and black, and the bedding in the guest room is sprayed with water. It is estimated that the windows and air conditioners are not turned on for the money-saving vacancies... In fact, the gain is not worth the loss.
Fortunately, the service from the front desk lady is very sincere and responsible. …But the quality of the breakfast is worrying… But there are 3 employees serving in total, what's wrong with them…
In summary, it is suspected that the high score is brushed out. The management and hardware are really sorry for the brand and the location.

msg:因為就在公司附近，因此這是第三次入住這家酒店了。我不得不説這是我有史以來住酒店最噁心的一次。不是衞生條件多噁心，而是整個酒店從我入住進來就一直有一股潮濕發黴的味道，在房間揮之不去，走廊也是。
一開始給我安排的29樓房間味道住了一晚上，我實在是接受不了，第二晚上給我安排到30樓，結果住進去不到兩個小時不知道是空調還是走廊傳進來的味道，整個房間又是有非常重的發黴味道。這次入住一共三個晚上，每一晚都想煎熬，給前台員工打反映非常冷漠。
前台早餐的水平也非常一般，競爭，我覺得完全配不上皇冠的水平。
希望大家一定要避雷，一定要避雷，一定要避雷！！！
我每個月都會出差來南寧，至少一次我以後再也不會住這家酒店！！！

環境不錯。服務也好。
可以走路去盛天地、萬象城。坐地鐵1站到萬象、2站到航洋，
最好看的還是大堂的這個樓梯了吧
不多説了 看圖。特別建築的酒店沒幾家。像這個商務酒店，大堂做成這樣已經很特別了像“盜夢空間”一樣。開心南寧能有這樣有設計建築感的酒店總體價格我預訂的時候 490配比的設施，這個價格還是蠻漂亮的。
前台James 到服務區的服務人員態度都很好
主動把寄存 幫抗行李 會介紹樓梯怎麼上去。
夜色下橋樑亮起彩燈，你可以欣賞到迷人的夜景在高空看，南寧的許多城市地標看得很清楚天晴時，還能看到絕美的日落
遠處青秀山公園和民族廣場，國際會展中心等地標這些地方在夜晚也非常美麗

msg:vocal ！！剛開始訂酒店看到一些負面評價還有點膽戰心驚，但是實際入住體驗非常好，酒店整體高端大氣，性價比很高，地理位置也很好，客房設施設備齊全完善。我是一個偏社恐的人士，在辦理入住的時候我安安分分排隊還有人插隊過來，前台小黃還會制止並告訴別人是我先過來的，先給我辦。還害怕人生地不熟可能不知道咋安排行程，但是入住的時候小黃就能給我介紹很多好吃的好玩兒的，加了微信根本就是管家級別的服務，連我要去三街兩巷、高鐵站…怎麼安排行程、怎麼坐地鐵都能幫我建議的明明白白。退房的時候正好也是小黃接待，知道我離店比較早怕我路上吃不上早餐還給我準備了小食包。這個酒店是真能處！！！以上都是發自內心的真心話，住過這麼多酒店從來沒寫過這麼長的評論，但是這家酒店值得！！！

相思小鎮離酒店很近，先去打卡，是一個適合旅拍的景點，當天下雨很冷，幾個漢服小姐姐衣衫單薄堅持拍攝，真漢子。不拍照的寶子要是時間不夠這個景點可以省略。
然後去青秀山，也是個人認為整個南寧最值得去的景點。非常大，綠化極佳，但路牌指示不明確，容易迷路，建議乘坐景區內車。山頂的觀音寺建議去拜拜，對，就是克羅地亞隊拜了之後點球無敗績那個寺廟。
夜晚可以在市中心一帶活動，傍晚先去碼頭拍照，那裡也有很多吃喝玩樂的小攤，拍照比較出片。
晚上逛三街兩巷，暢遊亭、百盛步行街還有好幾條夜市都在附近，吃的不要太多，解決晚飯宵夜順便買特產一條龍解決。

唯一不足的就是外賣送餐的問題。
外賣到了之後不會主動送上來（有送餐機器人），要電話聯繫禮賓部，要求他們送才會送。

佈置也是蠻認真的，衞生條件這些都不錯，客房服務也響應及時，總的來説，在南寧已經算很不錯的了，希望下次能看到皇冠掛牌變成洲際。

最後想說就是床好大！而且有浴缸，這幾天也是很舒服地度過了～

酒店的大堂的設計奢華大氣1竺空中旋轉樓梯彷彿置身於魔法世界裏，細節滿滿太容易絕美出片了，很多建築攝影愛好者會來這邊打卡晚上燈光全開的時候拍照更好看~
入住體驗感也很好，客服人員James

1 沒有高鐵站機場接送

2 門口酒店服務員，從來不幫忙提行李，甚至推嬰兒車的媽媽也不會幫忙開門提行李

在這麼好的地段又是國際品牌酒店，酒店主管應該更注意細節自我要求給消費者更好的服務

服務扣一分，主要是剛入住就有阿姨敲門送水，但本人並沒有叫，應該是搞錯了……這個屬於基礎問題；第二就是早餐的桌面清理太慢，基本一個客人離桌10分鐘之內沒有人清理，導致新客人衹能坐到更遠的位置用餐，這一點和上海差距非常大……

設施扣一分是因為冰箱裏麪衹有一瓶可樂，其他配套都沒有，説是需要可以打電話給前台要……這個明顯就是為了管理責任偷懶，差評……

其他前台服務和早餐的水準都在線

衞生給了 4 分，是因為打掃衞生的阿姨比較認真負責，這是唯一可以及格的地方。
前台入住的時候，工作人員説話幾乎是一種蚊子叫的狀態，需要詢問幾遍才能聽明白對方的意思，普通話也很不標準，拜託，你是服務行業，不是展現你南寧普通話的。點了外賣，需要聯繫前台配送，前台登記以後，半個小時未見外賣，打電話，前台像失憶一樣完全不記得有這個事情。
房間設施糟糕，不配備一次性浴缸套，使用時聯繫工作人員，那你安裝浴缸的意義在哪？衞生間的插座松的無法使用電吹風，電吹風的線還很短。前前後後反覆拔插，吹頭髮用了半個多小時。
房間空調聲音大的像飛機起飛一樣。
麻煩也 update 一下你的房間設定，躺在床上你覺得客人能看到這個電視畫面嗎？
退房以後，詢問酒店開發票，還故作關心的問候一下入住體驗，我回答體驗很不好，還假模假樣的 回覆會請值班經理聯繫我，等了3天，沒有一個電話。

還有一點兒和以後入住的客人重點説一下，酒店的窗户是不能打開的，但是窗户下面配有通風條，可以打開通風。

回想之前在吉隆坡的文華東方酒店住宿，離店的時候，前台説按金會14天返回。結果把按金悄咪咪的，在幾天後，用消費的方式全部扣出。我們每天不停的跟吉隆坡酒店聯繫，他們永遠用的拖延法。明天退，後天退，下個星期退。
最後在攜程幾十個電話，郵件不斷的催促下，快過了一個月，那個酒店不捨得似的，終於把按金還了回來。
真是形成鮮明對比。

msg:酒店管理水平太差了，下午五點多辦入住，因預訂的房型沒打掃好，給換了房型，第二天要求我們再換回原來的房型，讓客人天天收拾行李，填了一堆麻煩。第二天換房，早上8點多就把鑰匙交回前台，下午3點多辦事回來居然還説房間沒收拾好，讓等，前台對此沒有一點歉意，一臉你愛住不住，我們生意就是這麼好的樣子。建議酒店入住率高的話，可以多請些清潔人員。
酒店大堂一到晚上熱鬧的跟夜店一樣，人超級多，好像都是去餐廳吃飯的，怕吵鬧的不要住。

msg:設施：硬件還可以，也算比較新。家庭房很大，舒適度不錯。可是洗澡洗着洗着掉下一塊天花板算怎麼回事？事後客服短訊來問入住體驗，我反映了此問題，然而也沒回復，也沒然後。

早餐作為五星級連鎖品牌，我覺得算不太合格。8:00荷包蛋就不做了，衹給茶葉蛋。荷包蛋這麼精貴？還是非常難做？西點的品種和我前幾天住的那些四星酒店差不多，絲毫沒體現出皇冠假日應有的水準。

位置很方便，500米到萬象城，吃飯便利。網約車去青秀山7塊錢左右，很快。如果想吃小吃逛逛吃吃，建議還是住三街兩巷那邊老城區，小吃氛圍到位。這裏更適合出差。

Toutefois, il y a un domaine où il pourrait progresser: l'utilisation des emballages plastiques. Lorsque l'on fait laver des habits, chaque pièce est restituée ensuite emballée dans un sachet plastique - 3 paires de chaussettes = 3 emballages! Non seulement, cette pratique est superflue, mais elle est source d'un gaspillage qu'il serait facile d'éviter.

msg:這酒店都是攜程裏看到評分超高慕名而去的，去到就感覺不好了，大堂步行到酒店入住電梯，發現人員很雜，一看發現酒店裡還有茶市什麼的，等電梯都等到發火了，特別是吃早餐高峯，又遇上茶市高峯，我硬生生等了接近10分鐘的電梯。酒店裡麪配套的礦泉水是冰露，一次性用品全是雜牌。五星級酒店這樣的配置我無語了，配的茶包跟雀巢咖啡，全是體驗很一般的東西，吹風機雜牌，線很緊逼着人要往牆靠來吹頭髮。洗澡那個空間也很奇怪，做的架子上並不放東西，也沒法吊毛巾，完全就是多餘的。居然是IHG旗下的酒店，跟之前體驗的其它五星級酒店差距有點大。房間裏面沒啥好拍的，也就早餐滿意點。
