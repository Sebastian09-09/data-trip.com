I only stayed here for one night to see how it was, but I wish I could stay here for months! 

The kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bathrooms were all great and filled with amenities. I had a nice shower and hot soak in the bath, while also enjoying the TV installed for the bath tub. So awesome and relaxing. The curtains also blocked out the light well and the view from the 29th floor was cool. 

I didn't try out the washer or kitchen appliances, but everything looked very new and high quality. The fridge was also spacious. Highly recommend this place for short or long-term stays!

msg:Loved our stay at this hotel for the Chinese new year Holiday. Nearly everyone at the front desk speaks English, they are very polite, friendly and helpful with anything. They're so kind it makes me want to stay again just because of the front desk haha. Apart from the staff, the room was beautiful, large, big bed, great bathtub, well maintained, stunning view and a very well equipped kitchen. The kitchen had everything you possibly could need in terms of utensils. Gym is well equipped with technogym all though a bit small, but it has everything you need, very clean. Shame the pool wasn't open, so if you book hoping to swim, be sure to call and check if the pool has opened. For families with kids the location is perfect as it's in between multiple shopping malls and great indoor play places for kids, even has it's own mall attached to the hotel with a very cute play place on the third floor, if I remember correct. We tried a new place every day and they were all located within walking distance, happy Daughter! A play place called Mamatata is the only one I'd avoid if you want to shield your kids from nightmares, nasty zombies and skeletons growling are frequently appearing on the big screen. It's in a shopping mall on the opposite side of the road, one block away. Our Daughter cried her heart out because she got so scared when they suddenlt popped up, we had to leave as they didn't want to turn it off... Anyway, The play area they have for kids by the lobby could need some improvement, very cosy but many toys are broken etc. Deposit is high, 1000rmb a night, which is a little bit unnecessary I feel but it is what it is, you'll get it back if you don't break anything haha . We did break a glass though but they didn't want to charge us for that, very kind. I'd definitely come again!

msg:It is also a good place that I often come to before.
A good choice for a short stay, really good.

The facilities are quite durable and full of new Chinese style.
It is not like a hotel, but more like a small apar**ent for quiet living.
Basically, everything you want is there, except that the air conditioning is awkward.

The customer service is very considerate and thoughtful.
Basically, everything you ask for can be met quickly, except for takeout.
It would be even better if there were robots to deliver it.

The location is not very ideal, and the surrounding area is a bit desolate.
But there are a lot of small bars and small midnight snacks, which is great.

However, when I checked out, I was immediately disgusted with the evaluation of this hotel! After checking out, they said we damaged their table and asked me to pay 350 yuan for repainting? I was wondering, are we going to damage the table? ? Slandering guests without any facts should be unacceptable to anyone! I climbed up the stairs and read the reviews of this hotel. Of course I knew that this hotel had a history of slandering guests! As you can see from the pictures below, this table is obviously an old scar! Remind everyone to be careful when checking into this hotel! ! I live in room 3110! ! !

The positioning is not very accurate. Although it is also T1, it enters from the side.
Check-in is on the L floor.
The hotel floor plan is not very good, there is a kitchen but no dining table.
The overall design is average, but the supporting facilities are complete. There are air fryers.
From cutlery to wine glasses to microwaves.
After checking in, I couldn't watch the TV. Two waves of people came to check it out. Alas, I'm a bit sorry for the price.
There are only two bottles of water, and there are too many areas that need improvement.

If you ask the waiter, he will say, we all have private rooms here and you can cook by yourself! I stay in a hotel! What to cook for yourself!
There is no night view on the 30th floor! All covered, deluxe room!

There is no makeup mirror and the whole room is very warm and yellow light. I can’t put on makeup because I can’t see the colors clearly and there are too few sockets. I can’t use my laptop or mobile phone.

Since I was not very familiar with the Oakwood brand before, I made a special call to the front desk after placing the order. After some consultation, Yi Shen very patiently introduced the hotel rooms and supporting facilities as well as some scenic spots in Beijing and the approximate distance to the airport. The lady at the front desk who checked in and the boy who checked out were very enthusiastic and the process was very fast and saved me time. It’s really nice. I’ll stay at Delta Oakwood next time I go on a business trip!

msg:The second time I stayed here, I booked it because it was close to a friend's house. The light switch in the room was very inconvenient, and the oven and microwave had no operating instructions. I originally wanted to heat things up but gave it up.

I gave the service 1 star. I bought an express delivery on JD.com and it was delivered early the next morning. No one from JD.com called me. I went to check in the afternoon and found that it had arrived in the morning. The front desk didn’t tell me, so I called the front desk. Ask about the situation. As a result, a man answered the phone and told me that they do not provide the service of notifying guests of courier arrival. I was speechless at the moment. Many fast hotels will now proactively contact guests to inform them, asking me if JD.com did not notify me? The fact that JD.com informed me that the service was not provided by the hotel is completely different. Then the man went on to say, "If you need it, please come down and get it yourself"... I can only say that your hotel is too high-end, and we don't deserve to hear you say a thoughtful word at this time! I bought express delivery, can I not use it? Please tell me that if I need it, I can go and get it myself! Even if you don't take the initiative to tell guests that I understand the hotel's rules, can you still talk to them? Later, when I went to the front desk to get it, a man was indifferent and didn't even say hello. Maybe the hotel business is too good and the brand is too high-end.

When I checked out, I went to the front desk around 5:45 because I had an early flight. When I saw no one was there, I called out and saw that the front desk staff was sleeping on the sofa in the lobby seating area next to me... and then I didn't say hello after I came over. , he told me that the deposit would be refunded within 24 hours...

We stayed in 2607 at first, but as soon as we entered the room and turned on the light, the circuit breaker tripped. The lady at the front desk They quickly changed us to 2608. This time it went smoothly. The room was very clean and tidy. The shortcoming of this room was that the toilet door could not be closed or opened properly and would rebound a little. Therefore, my two children and I were affected by this. The door handle of the toilet was bloody. Contact the hotel and be sure to pay attention to this safety issue. In addition, the hair dryer in this room is broken. I found out after washing my hair that it can only be dried naturally. I waited until very late, hoping for improvement. Everything else is very satisfactory, hotel storage is also very convenient. I will consider it again next time I come to Beijing. There is Joy City nearby and I heard it is very popular recently.

msg:I understand that you need to pay a parking fee to stay in the hotel, but you don’t understand that the parking fee is collected by the hour. I didn’t mention it when I stayed in the hotel. It cost 600 yuan to park for three days. When I was inquiring with the doorman, the accomplice came and asked if there was anything I didn’t understand. The attitude was arrogant. I was afraid to pay silently and drive away. Then I called the hotel and asked the hotel if I didn’t care about the property. I didn’t expect to be cheated like this.

You can eat, drink, and have fun at one stop. My husband likes to cook. I don’t understand, so he fell in love with him deeply. The kitchen there is no worse than the one at home. The kitchen utensils and utensils are clean and full of a**osphere. I also like the decoration style very much. The gray dark-tone glass is high-end and a**ospheric, and all kinds of furniture are definitely of good quality! The little brother at the front desk is very nice, maybe because there are few guests, he arranged the top floor for us. At first, he didn't know the intention. After we came back from playing in the evening, the beautiful scenery in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooked half of Beijing city. It's so beautiful, I love it. , It would be great if parking is free, underground parking is a bit expensive

The oven and dishwasher are all available, and it is very convenient to prepare a New Year's Eve dinner by yourself with some pre-made dishes. The hotel parking lot is charged, and we parked elsewhere 5 minutes away. The hotel is very good, more than 4 stars, less than 5 stars, there is no buckwheat skin pillow for pillows, 4.9 stars hahaha. Please note that the bed is a bit high, and it is a little difficult for the elderly with inconvenient legs and feet. All the staff encountered during check-in were very good, from the doorman, porter, front desk, and room service. Very happy Chinese New Year!

1. Check-in is available at 12:00, and I arrived at the front desk at 15:30 and waited for 20 minutes to get a room.
2. After checking in, the room smelled very strange, and the air conditioner was also broken. I went to the hotel for repairs. After two workers repaired it for more than an hour, it still didn't work.
3. There was a power outage. Fortunately, the power was restored quickly, but the wifi waited for a day to recover.
4. The sound insulation is ok, but no matter how good the sound insulation is, it can't stop the noise of the children in the next room at 1:30 in the morning, and the two communication with the front desk did not improve. (The night before when my friend and I were playing games at eleven o'clock and the sound was loud, the staff came to remind us in time..)

The hotel didn't talk nonsense, and readily agreed. In fact, according to the reservation regulations, there is no refund. Even after the epidemic, the breakfast room of the hotel has not yet opened, but there is a food street supporting the office building in the ba*****t of Delta, and there are many eating places nearby, so it is not a problem.

msg:Stayed for 10 days in a row, I am not satisfied and will not continue to stay, but the overall feeling is not perfect.
shortcoming:
1. The wifi in the room is too poor, and the TV can't be projected, so I can only watch stock photos on my computer
2. The bath water is hot and cold
3. Auntie is very responsible for cleaning, but it is better to wipe the trash can a little when cleaning the garbage bag. Some sauces that splashed on the outer wall of the trash can still be cleaned the next day.
4. There is no hot spring in the hotel now. The introduction booklet of the room also says that there is a hot spring. The restaurant is closed due to the epidemic and did not say it in advance.
5. There have been more than one problems with the access card. If you go to the first floor of Lawson to buy things, you can't swipe in, or you can't swipe the gym. You need to go to the front desk for help.
advantage:
1. The service attitude is good, and the things I left in the room also help to send them back (but is it a bit inappropriate to send the cups I drank without washing them by express, because they smelled after covering them on the road for two days)
2. Flexible and considerate. When I left, I borrowed a lunch box from a room because I had to bring some food. The hotel helped me and agreed, and refunded the deposit as soon as I sent it back.

In general, it's ok, worthy of the price, and will stay again if the wifi and hot water can be repaired. It would be better if the details were improved a little more.

In a very inconspicuous location, there is a dedicated door, but it is small and the signs are not clear.
Seeing the guests at the front desk, they didn't say hello. They didn't have the politeness and enthusiasm of other five-star hotels, and there was nothing wrong with them. It's like the front desk of a company, not like a hotel. This feeling was obvious when checking in, the front desk was better when checking out, and there was no warm service. It's okay too.
The rooms are very good, and one bedroom and one living room have been upgraded. The size and facilities are very good, and the bed is very comfortable. The kitchen and hot spring bathtub are especially recommended.

msg:I hope that the so-called "expensive" hotel of the American brand will have time to organize staff to go to the "Qingdao Seaview Garden Hotel" for intensive study and understand why our customers stay for 20 years.
I used to live in Oakwood in Hangzhou. The experience was very poor, the internet was not available, the air-conditioning was poor, and the service was even more important. A group of Hangzhou people learned the free and easy way and indifference of Americans.
Picture ①, the shower head in the rain, we need to bend down and bow to see this Chinese description. Like a Japanese salute, I really want to remove it. And, 99% of people can't understand it.
Picture ②We stayed in a room of 2500 yuan/night, breakfast was 138 yuan/person, a total of 6 breakfasts, 3 actually attended (5 year old children not counted), and the other 2 guests drank too much, uncomfortable, and wanted to bring some Things, picture ③ is a few whole-wheat breads, the waiter in this picture ② is in the restaurant, shouting loudly without a respectful sentence, and can’t take the bread. Very "human" American brand.
Picture ④ Picture ⑤ is the mobile phone signal and network signal of this hotel, which is exactly the same as the experience in Hangzhou. Those who need a mobile phone and the Internet must not check in.
Figure ⑥ There is a big hole in the bed sheet, which is really rubbish!

If these facts are offensive to everyone, then I should spend money to experience it for everyone. In addition, the deposit requirements at the front desk are the same as the room rate. Children need a household registration book to check in. There is a record number in the opposite parking lot and you can complain to the relevant authorities in Beijing. Yuan/hour) or the underground parking lot (6 Yuan/hour, empty 3-story parking lot).

It is the first time that I have used so much "pen and ink" to review a hotel. Never stay at Delta Center for the second time and never trust American brands.

This is an American brand hotel-style apar**ent with guaranteed quality.

The environment is really good, the location is good, and there is Chaoyang Joy City nearby where you can eat.

There are also swimming pools and fitness centers, you just have to ask the staff to swipe your card to enter.

Although there are not many choices for breakfast, it is enough~ I took the initiative to season the eggs with soy sauce, and the service was good.

The environment is clean, tidy and quiet, sleeping well, the swimming pool is booked in advance because of the epidemic, and it is more reassuring.

msg:Not very good, the room itself is very general, there are no supporting services, all kinds of disposable items are not good, and the shower in the first room is broken, and it is very troublesome to adjust itself, I don't know how many five-star hotels I have stayed in for the first time See such a speechless design. In the middle of the night, I was too embarrassed to call the waiter, so I asked by phone and communicated back and forth for an hour. As a result, the shower was about to be removed by me, but the adjus**ent was not successful. In the end, I only had to trouble the waiter to come in in the middle of the night, and found that it was really one. The beginning is broken, super silent. In the middle of the night, I opened another room to let me take a shower, but found that the shower was still broken...? ? It's just a different method. The first room is that there is a problem with the controller at the lower part of the shower. The second room is that when I turn on the shower, the water is sprayed in all directions. The adapter is loose in many places. The degree is too sprayed, it is really a big speechless incident burning with anger. I feel that there are very few employees. I have never seen a few internal employees except as the doorman of the card surface.

The next day, I communicated with the front desk, just recording (I am still very grateful to the staff at night for coordinating for me in the middle of the night. Although it was also his accusation, I did trouble him. It is not his responsibility for the shower to break. Look It's just like a security guard), without any sincere apology or explanation, uh, I can't take a shower in the middle of the night, and I've been in a bath for at least more than an hour. I have to wear a bathrobe and run to other rooms to take a shower. I was tortured by the shower and blood. I didn't sleep well all night. I couldn't get up the next day. I had to book an extra night. Am I here to be a repairman or troubleshooting? ? ? ? I couldn't bear it and asked me to change a room without any problems this time, and if the room status allows it to be a five-star hotel, it should be upgraded. The handle is broken again... Forget it, I'm too lazy to say it...

It is estimated that the good houses have been rented out for a long time, and the surrounding area is also very desolate. The hotel conjoined office building is ok. The rest of the place feels very rural. The floor of the upgraded room is also very low. Dilapidated building experience can not be said to be good, do you deserve to have no attention to family travel when you travel alone?

msg:위치: 차오양 기차역에서 가깝지만, 자금성, 천안문, 이화원 같은 주요 관광지와는 거리가 좀 있는 편이나, 내부시설로는 1층에 까페가 있고, 지하에는 푸드코트와 쇼핑몰과 연결되어있어서 너무 편했음. 
시설: 부엌이 너무 잘 되어있고, 밥솥, 오븐, 식기세척기, 세탁기까지 있어서 너무 좋았음. 
친절도: 오후 2시로 체크아웃 부탁했을 때 가능하다고 했는데, 막상 당일이 되니 11시쯤부터 전화와서 가급적 빨리 나가달라고 하여 정신없이 짐 챙겨서 나오게 됨. 그럼 처음부터 레이트체크아웃이 안된다고 하던지 매우 불쾌했음. 
총평: 침대도 쾌적하고 주변 편의시설이 있어서 시설은 너무 좋았으나 관광지로 이동하는 데 시간이 많이 걸리고 주변에 지하철이 없어서 택시만 타고다녔음

這次去秋冬季節了，公寓關了空調，整個房間超級悶熱，送風開了當沒開，窗户也小，整個很難受。這個季節住着很悶，不舒服。以後如果有投屏就更好了。

因為某露和某ONE的緋聞而著名的酒店，前來打卡

位置交通：
離我家很近，雖然很多年沒生活在這裏了，熟悉又陌生的感覺。交通還是很方便的～

房間景觀：
視野還OK，採光也還行。

服務：
服務態度很不錯，還給免費升級了房型。

衞生：
衞生條件還不錯。

床：
稍微有點硬，而且感覺是兩張床墊拼在一起的感覺，中間有條縫的感覺，不是很舒服，睡着有點累。

wifi：
速度有點慢。

房間設施：
房間蠻大，還有廚房；冰箱味道有點重，不知道之前放過什麼，建議竹炭吸附一下；設施總體還OK，沒什麼大毛病；還挺適合常住的。

性價比：
性價比其實蠻高的，900塊錢，這麼大的面積，設施也都還比較新，這個位置，還是挺不錯的，推薦來達美辦事的朋友可以優先選擇。

msg:之前在三亞就住過奧克伍德，刷攜程找酒店時，看到北京的奧克價格很平價以為會不好，也許是品牌效應吧，還是決定要試一下，預訂了2晚。到酒店後，真心覺得訂這裏真的沒錯。在北京這個價格訂到這麼大的房間，真的已經很良心了。再加上帶孩子入住，家用電器應有盡有，幹什麼都很方便。我想，他們家的價格這麼便宜，唯一就是輸在了地理位置上，不挨地鐵，周邊沒有豪華夜景。但換一角度，旁邊就是達美商場，吃喝玩樂幾户都可以在方圓一公里內解決。還是很方便的。因為不在熱門景點周邊，旁邊的飯店吃東西也很好吃，價格也很親民。能感受到北京居民平時的生活氛圍，還是很好的。還有特別值得一提的是，平時入住酒店，退房後會要求我給5分好評，但這個酒店至始至終都沒有跟我要求過半句，可能就是這種真實的管理，才沒有讓這個酒店刷到高分而讓更多的人瞭解他們，我喜歡這裏，我真心為你們點贊，下次來北京，我一定還會住在這裏，像回家一樣舒服。
