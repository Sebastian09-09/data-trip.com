msg:Such a great hotel to stay in Juizhaigou üòç
It's only 5 min walk from the Park entrance and about 400m away from restaurants and shopping area.
The room itself is so big and bright with the floor heating ü§©
And we also enjoyed the tea room
They're also a hot springs in the hotel and some free snacks in the lobby
The breakfast is not a buffet style, and the food was Chinese, so be ready for that, but for us it wasn't a problem
Overall it was a pleasant stay!

The hotel is located just 5 min away from the main street with all the restaurants and stores as well as just 5 min walk from the entrance of the Jiuzhaigou Valley. 

We took a coach from Songpan Station and asked the driver to drop us off/pick us up right in front of the hotel.

Big plus also for the breakfast which offered both Chinese and continental options as well as for the hot bath, which was really relaxing after a long day! Overall would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely come back next time!

msg:The room is beautiful but a little noisy due to the neighbours doors opening and closing as well as the cleaning staff room was next to the room I stayed in. Yes the view outside the window was ugly with the stalled construction but generally I kept the curtains closed anyways. The tea and coffee set are really good, and the heated floors are the best for a cold morning! The included breakfast was also worth it! I chose the hotel because it has the hot springs but because they close at 9pm I did not have time to enjoy them after my hike in the park and after having dinner because I spent more time outdoors. Keeping them open until 10 or 11pm would be best for people like me!

Room was quite large with tatami styled beds. They have airport pickup service which is great considering the airport is about 90-100km away with windy roads. 
Service was prompt and attentive but all front counter closes after 10pm with no one at the counter in the evening. I guess it is ok considering it is a small town. Do get your required services and questions before dinner. Overall, good stay. Lobby has a huge sitting area with bottled water and biscuits provided.

Breakfast was lovely and nice. They had laundry room (washer and dryer) - free of charges but you must bring your own detergent. Some free drink at the lobby. It was one of the hotels that were close to the JiuZhaiGou entrance but a bit far out from the center of eateries (need to walk at least 400 m. - during the cold weather, we considered far). Anyway, near the hotel, there were a convenient stall, milk tea shop and a BBQ restaurant.

Service: After arriving, you can add the front desk WeChat. If you have any questions, you can ask at any time. It is very considerate. There is also free hot American coffee at the front desk.

Facilities: Overall, it is pretty good. The only thing that has a little impact is that the flushing sound of the toilet is a little loud, but it does not affect the living all day.

Service: Good, warm greetings, willing to help. The floor heating is turned on in advance, which is worth praising
A**osphere: relatively quiet and leisurely
The biggest advantage: hot water in seconds
The disadvantage is the design and construction quality of the decoration, which has nothing to do with the service team, but the boss's fault. Design problem: I live in a room with a meditation space. There is no table of normal height in the whole house except the sink, and there is no place to put sundries. It is a little troublesome for people who have a certain degree of cleanliness and don't want to put the sundries brought back from outside on the bed. The meditation space occupies a large area and can only sit cross-legged. The left and right sides of the space are decorated with stone floors, which cannot be used. In addition, there is a lack of space for hanging clothes. There is a small movable shelf, which is full of two down jackets. The wash table is too narrow, resulting in the toiletries placed to occupy the entire table, and there is no available depth. Construction quality: The faucet is obviously crooked, and the water comes out in lumps, which is difficult to control. There is no seal under the wash table, and the pipeline is exposed, which is slightly indecent.

Breakfast drinks, bread slices and porridge are self-service, and the other side dishes are served per person, which is quite simple.

msg:Environment: A very elegant hotel with a warm Japanese style. Three-story villa courtyard.

Location: Only 600 meters away from the scenic spot and 600 meters away from the bus connection point.

Facilities: There is a smart toilet and floor heating yyds, which are very comfortable. I am worried that guests will be too dry, and they also prepare facial masks.

Service: Whether it is the front desk of the hotel, the manager, or the waitress in the restaurant, they are all very enthusiastic.

There are also exquisite tea sets, and the breakfast is in the form of a set meal, which is completely enough to eat, and prepares enough energy for the ditch.

We really put our heart into building a hotel and welcome us to come from afar.

msg:Location: Very close to the entrance of the scenic spot, and also quite close to the restaurant area and several supermarkets. The location is really great.

Room: The floor heating is really comfortable, especially during the few days we went, it was very cold in the morning and evening. As soon as I entered the room, I shouted "Long live!" Smart toilets are also great. The only drawback is that the toilet and bathroom are very cold. Maybe they should have a heater instead of just a dryer. It also takes three to five minutes for the water in the bathroom and wash basin to be hot. The window of the arranged room directly faced the construction site where a house was being built next door, and it looked dirty. In fact, during the off-season, there are quite a few vacancies. If you can generously arrange a room with a better window view, you can improve your stay experience and increase your return rate.

Breakfast: The room booked includes breakfast - the breakfast aunt is friendly and attentive; the breakfast is simple but abundant, including hot porridge, side dishes including eggs, steamed buns, dumplings, potatoes, etc. There is also a toaster and hot drink machine. The dining location is not in the hotel building. On a cold morning, you have to wear multiple layers of clothes and shoes and socks and step out of the main building to have breakfast in the next building.

Service: Before arriving, I called the hotel to ask if they could arrange a pick-up. Sister Zhu enthusiastically found a driver to contact me directly. The driver drove very safely and securely!

The decoration style of the hotel is Japanese-style. The room has floor heating and unified tatami. Children especially like the feeling of tatami.
Breakfast is not a buffet. Each person has one meal ticket. It usually includes fried eggs, boiled eggs, pickles, fried peanuts, flower rolls or steamed buns. The restaurant provides a buffet of lemon tea, milk, coffee, toast and rice porridge.
The hot spring that the children dreamed about did not come out. The hotel said that it was difficult to boil the water because the water temperature was low. My daughter asked the front desk clerk, "If you can't take a hot spring bath, why is it called a hot spring hotel?" Ha ha!
The overall impression is still very good. The waiter cleaned the room very quickly and replenished the goods well.
Recommend everyone to consider this hotel

msg:How should I put it, the overall environment of the hotel is very good, but there is something wrong with the design of the washbasin in the room. The faucet is very long and it is in the way when brushing teeth and washing face. The washing water is very small and it is not very easy to use. Furthermore, it was not pleasant to have dinner at the hotel restaurant. We arrived at five o'clock in the evening and asked about places to eat near the hotel. The front desk recommended the hotel restaurant where you can have yak hot pot. I was tired from the long journey and didn't want to leave, so I thought of giving it a try. It was quite convenient. The front desk said enthusiastically: "Put your luggage in the room. The restaurant will be ready in about half an hour. They will call the room to notify us of the meal. However, we waited for almost an hour and there was no notification, so we went to ask the front desk if it was ready." The front desk said it was ready, and enthusiastically led our family to the restaurant to eat. When we arrived at the restaurant, we saw three service aunts in their fifties. We were very surprised. They didn‚Äôt know what to say. No one informed us that the hot pot was ready. An aunt who responded quickly said: It doesn't matter, just sit down and it will be fine soon. We waited patiently, and the food was indeed served very quickly. The yak hotpot was really different from what I expected. I pulled a power ***** and put it on the induction cooker. In the pot, there was very dry beef tendon, a little cabbage, tomatoes, and lettuce. Three hundred is quite expensive. The most important thing is that the beef is very hard and hard to chew and swallow. It makes my throat sore. I don't know if the yak hotpot is like this or if we can't eat it ourselves. There wasn't any seasoning for dipping either. Then because I have a five-year-old child, I asked my aunt if she had rice or other staple food, such as fried rice, fried noodles, etc. I thought about ordering another one for the child. The most annoying thing at this time was that an aunt said out of nowhere: No, there is no need to eat, just eat hot pot. I said the children wanted to eat and were hungry. The brainless aunt said in an understatement and rudely: You figure it out yourself. Forget all the small twists and turns in the past, I immediately became angry when I heard this sentence. I said: That's really interesting. I paid to come over to eat. I asked if there were any other staple food or rice. Tell me: You can figure it out yourself. Two aunties next to me whispered, saying that she talked too much. One aunt who knew how to look at her eyes came over to comfort me and said that there was leftover rice from the staff meal in the kitchen. The pot was clean. If you don't mind, you can help me make a bowl. The children will eat it now. Serve the main course. I just want to urge the person in charge of the hotel to make a long speech. Although your hotel accommodation and front desk service are okay, there are still many small details, have you noticed them? Worthy of promotion

3) BREAKFAST - IT CAN BE SAID THAT IT IS NOT AVAILABLE! individual serving of tasteless products. There isn't even proper coffee or tea. In general, if they don‚Äôt make a buffet, you need to look for another place for breakfast.
4) when I checked in, the room was poorly cleaned (hair on the sofa, toothpaste residue on the table near the sink, stains on the sofa)

Service: The front desk service was very good when checking in, and the introduction was quite detailed. After staying for two days, we would greet the front desk when we passed by. We had a pre-booked hot spring, and the front desk was also very active in helping to arrange it;
Environment: The hotel style is a bit Japanese, and there is a stream next to it, which feels like a Japanese hot spring town. The lighting in the lobby is relatively warm, and the overall cleanliness is also very simple. It should be very nice to take photos and check in. The environment of the room is quite satisfactory, the smart supporting facilities are good, and the floor heating is also very comfortable. The hotel will help you turn on the floor heating in advance, which is also very considerate;
Hygiene: Hygiene should be the only thing we are not satisfied with. There were some problems with the hygiene of the room we stayed in at the beginning, but the hotel actively dealt with it and helped us upgrade the room for free. It was good in dealing with the problem, but the overall hygiene of the washroom still couldn't stand a closer look. It is really excessive to ask so much for a hotel of more than 300 yuan. I also hope that the hotel can continue to maintain its service level. It would be even better if the hygiene standards can be improved a little bit.
In summary, it is a hotel worth staying in. After all, this price is really reasonable in Jiuzhaigou. I like the sincere owner of the hotel.

The sound insulation is poor. I live in the end room, which is isolated from the tool room. The staff was picking up tools from 7:00 to 7:30 on the first morning. It was so noisy! Fortunately, after reporting it to the front desk, things improved the next day! üëçüèª

First of all, the room decoration is very stylish and more spacious than expected. The mattresses and pillows are particularly comfortable and definitely of five-star quality. The toothbrush head is also extremely soft and comfortable, far better than many hotels. In addition, Xiaodu can control TVs, curtains and lights, as well as smart toilets, which is full of technology. All the furniture and supplies are exquisite, beautiful and of high quality. Although it is a new hotel opened last year, there is no peculiar smell.
Breakfast is also quite unique, with coffee, milk, soy milk, eggs, buns, and side dishes provided.
All in all, very satisfied.
The service is also good.

The hot spring described is the pool in picture 1. It is empty. He will ask the guest, "If you want to soak, I will put some water for you. It is not a natural hot spring." You can't refute him!
The room was cold, the lobby was cold, and the attitude of the lobby attendant was as cold as the weather. I was so cold that I kept sneezing and had runny nose, but I didn't have any awareness of wearing a mask.
Because the rooms on the second floor did not have air conditioning or floor heating, they were moved to the third floor. The bedding in the two rooms was arranged as shown in the picture, with handprints on it. I wondered if Ren had stayed there before. The waiter‚Äôs answer was, ‚ÄúThey all have tatami mats.‚Äù so"
Final summary! Good location, poor service, and the hot springs are fake!

msg:The hotel is located very close to the entrance of the scenic spot, but far away from the dining and shopping areas. The facilities are average, always a little bit worse. The yin and yang of the floor heating that was turned on all night was both hot and cold at the same time. The air conditioner was not heating and there was no wind. It was funny that the clerk didn't check it and just said it was broken and used the floor heating. After contacting me three times, he reluctantly came up and adjusted it to 24 degrees to wait for the wind. There was no wind all night. The hot spring is also a joke, it's just not natural. There is no heating equipment in the glass room. In the cold autumn and autumn, the jacuzzi will not be turned on, and the water will not be heated when the water temperature is low. The overall service focuses on answering questions and not answering, and I don't even bother to raise my head when asking about things. Not a five star experience at all. The most outrageous thing is that there is an airport shuttle service, but there is no high-speed rail shuttle service. Asking the front desk to call a car costs 98 per person, and the price is only 56. For the same car, people who are staying together will only know when they get on the bus.

msg:I took my parents in their seventies to travel to Jiuzhaigou. After landing at Jiuhuang Airport, I contacted the hotel one day in advance to arrange a free pick-up. After getting off the plane, I went directly to the hotel. The location of Four Seasons Manju is very close to the mouth of Jiuzhaigou Valley, but if you go to the place where restaurants are concentrated in the opposite direction from the mouth of the ditch, you can't have your cake and eat it too.
Our room is on the first floor and is not arranged next to the rushing river that other netizens mentioned, so the environment is very quiet. However, because there is still construction behind the location, the view outside the window cannot be viewed directly, but we went to see Jiuzhaigou Valley. The beautiful scenery is really just for rest in the hotel, so just ignore the environment outside the window.
The hotel is decorated in Japanese style. The rooms are not big but the facilities are exquisite and compact. On the left side of the door is the bathroom and shower. My parents were satisfied with the 37-degree constant temperature and various flushing functions of the smart toilet. On the right side is the washing area, which is a bit small, but for the sake of the centella asiatica mask, I don't care. There are two 1.2-meter single beds on the Japanese tatami, with a bedside table in the middle. You can rest and chat without disturbing each other while sleeping. There is also a small chaise longue, which I directly used to place my suitcase. The tea set on the small coffee table is quite exquisite, but I put it aside because I had to use the only table for breakfast (the hotel provides breakfast, but my parents don‚Äôt like it. So I always buy them from outside). The sideboard provides four flavors of tea bags and ear-hanging coffee, which are pretty good after trying them. There are very good quality slippers and an imitation Dyson hair dryer in the drawer. I feel pretty good after using them.
Highlights: 1. Floor heating. At the end of October, the night temperature in Jiuzhaigou was around 0 degrees, and the room was as warm as spring. 2. Drinking water. The hotel provides 4 bottles of drinking water every day. If you don't have enough, you can always ask for it. 3. Smart toilet and constant water temperature. The water and temperature for washing and showering are very stable. After a long day of traveling, it is really comfortable to take a hot bath every night and sleep. 4. Catering. There is a self-operated restaurant next to the hotel parking lot. The spicy chicken, wontons, and barbecue are all delicious, and there are discounts for hotel guests. 5. Hot springs. We all brought our swimming suits, but we didn‚Äôt go. I heard other customers wanted to make a reservation directly.
Overall, this hotel is very good in a tourist area. If I have the chance to go to Jiuzhaigou again, I think I will still choose this hotel.

Breakfast is served at 7 o'clock in the morning, and you can eat at 6:50. You can order a meal. After eating and drinking, 7:30 is just the right time to go to the ditch.

2. The hot water in the hotel is not good. After running the water for 10 minutes, the water is still only warm. I took a "cold shower" with tears in my eyes for two days.
3. I have a complaint. When I was doing laundry at night, the waiter told me that someone complained that the sound was too loud and asked me to stop. Okay, so I took out other people's clothes and threw them in for washing. Um? ? ? Are you taking me for granted?
Considering the hotel price and location, it is better to go directly to Jiji

Although the room is small, the layout is very reasonable, and everything is carefully designed, taking into account the general needs of the public. There is no peculiar smell in the room. In addition to being hot, the only drawback of the smart toilet is that the pre-flush water pressure is too high and it easily splashes on the buttocks. This may be a common problem with some smart toilets, and it is the same in my home. The hotel lobby has a hollow design and is very transparent, but there are some shortcomings. I was tired on the first day of check-in and turned off the lights very early. As a result, I was woken up by the loud noise of the new guests in the lobby. Fortunately, it did not last long. It wasn't long, it was quiet at other times, and the front desk staff also explained it to us. Next time I stay, I will consider and recommend it to my friends. Considering the cost-effectiveness, I will give it a 5-star rating.

It is hard not to suspect that this is because the hot spring bath is not open during the off-season. The leisure level of vacation is greatly reduced. I had high expectations for staying here, but I was so disappointed.

The feeling is obvious if you don't draw the curtains at night. The service is also good. Facilities: The hot spring is not available and is said to be under maintenance. Then in the gym, the treadmill was broken and the dumbbells were rusty. There really is no advantage except being closer to the scenic spot. Breakfast is very simple! Next time I come, I probably won‚Äôt stay here.

Hygiene: We stayed on the first floor, the room smelled bad, but everything else was fine
Environment: The environment of the hotel is okay. The family room is too small for the three of us to stay in. We are a family of three, and the son is an adult. One bed is 1.2 meters, and the other is 1.8 meters. No problem, the room space is really crowded

It would be better if there are more choices.
Hygiene: very good, clean. The only dissatisfaction is that the water from the rain shower faucet is too small, and it feels a bit unclean, which needs to be improved.
Environment: very comfortable. It's very close to the scenic spot, and it takes six to seven minutes to walk there, and it's on the other side of the side street. The quiet facilities are more mature
Service: The front desk is good, and the waiters are also polite. Overall praise, I will choose to stay again when I go to Jiuzhaigou.

msg:The whole family went out to play and chose this hotel. It is very close to Mizoguchi and you can walk there. The decoration is relatively warm, very clean, and the intelligent facilities are complete. My daughter said that it is equipped with a Dyson hair dryer, which is deeply loved by her. I even forgot that this store has a free airport pick-up service, which wasted hundreds of dollars. If you come to stay, you can enjoy this free service haha. I stayed here for three consecutive days, and sent us to the bus station when we left, which deserves 5 points of praise.

However, the room card I was given when I checked in could not open the door, so the front desk brought a second card over.
The yak hotpot coupon shown in the order cannot be used.
The front desk did not mention the hot spring experience from check-in to check-out. If it is not open, I hope you can inform me in advance.
Generally speaking, the sanitary facilities and environment are ok for hotels of the same type. Maybe the service can't keep up during the off-season, which is understandable.

Although it is close to the scenic spot, you still have to walk a while, and you also have to walk a while from the commercial area. It becomes a situation where you are caught in the middle and you have to make your own decision.
Similar to the reaction in the comment area, the water pressure and temperature are abnormal. At first, the hot water pressure was not very hot and the pressure was low. After the hotel replaced the accessories, it became very hot and the water pressure was slightly lower than normal.
There are also old problems in many hotels where TV content basically requires a TV platform membership to watch. Other places are okay and there are other places to go shopping, but here there is basically nothing to go to at night.

msg:Environment: It can be said that it is the second closest hotel to the entrance of Jiuzhaigou Scenic Area (the nearest one looks very old-fashioned). It takes 5 minutes to walk to the scenic spot. There are many restaurants (including KFC) within 5 minutes in the other direction. The entrance is The main ditch, you can see the wild peach trees on the mountain when you open the window in the room, the location is superb
Service: Every service staff is very gentle, will take the initiative to understand the needs and try their best to meet them. The day before I arrived, I made a phone call to explain that there would be another guest on the same flight besides us during the free pick-up, and asked if we would mind. When checking in, I took the initiative to explain that the buffet breakfast is temporarily closed due to the off-season. The meal is prepared directly according to the customer, and the meal time for the next day will be confirmed every day. When we said we wanted to sleep in the next day, he helped us keep the pasta warm until we woke up and then delivered it to the room
Hygiene: Will take the initiative to clean every day, very clean
Facilities: constant temperature toilet seat, hair dryer (although there is no logo, but the feeling of wind is Dyson), Xiaodu intelligent voice control, full of sense of technology, feel the "new" of the hotel
Great staying experience!

Children's toiletries are provided after asking the front desk; the most important thing is that many shower outlets do not discharge water and the water is relatively small; the air conditioner does not respond when it is turned on, and it was so hot that I couldn't fall asleep all night. , the children were also sweating from the heat, the worst check-in experience ever!

msg:I didn't want to comment at first, but I thought about it. I thought the small breakfast in the room was almost enough, but after eating breakfast, our family had diarrhea. I was afraid that the food would be dirty when I went out to play. I still have to complain: the breakfast is really bad! ! ! When I entered the restaurant, I found that the bowls were not cleaned. The breakfast is not self-service, it is porridge, eggs, steamed buns and pickles, served in a small bowl for you. Even so, it will not be served after 9 o'clock. I went to refill a bowl of porridge later. I saw that the back kitchen was really dirty. The floor was so greasy that I could skate on it. I saw the bowls and chopsticks used by the previous guest and passed them in a dirty sink. I just used it for the next customer. The not-so-fresh cut watermelon was placed in a not-so-clean basin, and I lost my appetite instantly after watching it. It can be said that this is the worst breakfast in a hotel where I stayed for more than ten days.
Two-person hot spring experience: This hot spring is not a real hot spring, but a few bathtubs with a layer of dirt floating on the water surface. It is really embarrassing to think about squatting in the bathtub with a few strangers. I couldn't get into the water and went back to the room!
By the way, let‚Äôs talk about other things together. I plan to go to the laundry room to wash clothes. There is a bottle of laundry detergent on the countertop, but I found that the laundry detergent has been changed. It is a yellow viscous liquid, not the normal transparent light blue laundry detergent. I Why do you know, because the carved plaque used is the same as the one I used at home, and I don't know who did it.
Other good points: the room has free facial masks, which is not bad
Summary: At that time, I wanted to find a place closer to the scenic spot. It doesn't matter if you set a fee of seven or eight hundred a day. The key is that you must ensure the minimum hygiene! After having diarrhea, I changed the hotel decisively, and found that several five-star hotels are not far from the scenic spot, and they provide free shuttle buses to the scenic spot. The breakfast is simply much better.

In winter, the room has floor heating (adjustable temperature) which is very useful. However, we did not provide food and beverages when we went. If we provide food and beverages, we must first ask the front desk. Walk two or three hundred meters nearby, there are many restaurants, and it is 600 meters away from the scenic spot, which is very close and quiet. When I went there, there was a free hot spring, but the store said that it was freezing in winter and I couldn't soak in it, which was a pity. On the return journey, the store took us to the passenger terminal. Praise~

msg:The only advantage of this store is that it is very close to the entrance of Jiuzhaigou Valley, and it can be reached in three or four minutes on foot. However, in terms of facilities, I really can‚Äôt complain about it. There is no air-conditioning... These days, hotels that cost one or two hundred yuan have air-conditioning... This The weather, living without an air conditioner is really bad... If I hadn't checked in, I really wanted to leave right away... Closing the window is not opening the window, it's stuffy and hot... The room is not big, I stayed for two days, and there was hair on the ground Didn't see it and cleaned it again... The service is not good... I don't recommend you to make a reservation...

msg:1. The hotel has a parking lot. It is very convenient to park if you stagger the peak hours. 2. The size of the room is suitable, and the bed and pillows are very comfortable.
3. The hot springs are reservation-based, and each room has a hot spring pool. (In fact, it is an open-air bathtub with spa function)
4. The front desk service is not bad.
5. The overall environment belongs to Japanese style, the environment is good, and it is a five-minute walk from the gate of the scenic spot.
6. The ventilation effect of the room is very poor, there is no air conditioner, and it is very stuffy at night.
7. There is no partition in the hall, and the guests who come at night are very noisy, which can be heard clearly in the room.
Generally speaking, the price is reasonable if there is a member VIP, but the price/performance ratio is relatively low if the original price is available.

You don‚Äôt need to drive a car to go to the scenic spot. You can check out in the morning. You can just drive when you come out of the scenic spot. The details determine that the hotel is definitely considered in Jiuzhaigou. It's a good hotel~ The configuration is in place, the room is clean, and the breakfast is full~ It's really good. I went too early and there is no ordinary room. I directly upgraded to the best room in the hotel. The price difference reaches 50%~ The scenery of Jiuzhaigou is good~ that's it Maybe too many people on weekends~

The parking lot is its own, not as congested as other homes. It is also petty, smart Xiaodu and smart toilet, suitable for bringing babies.

Facilities: The hotel room is not big, but it has functions. The room also has a facial mask and a Dyson hair dryer, which is very considerate. The hotel is also equipped with hot spring services. It is very refreshing to take a hot bath in Jiuzhaigou after playing for a day.
Environment: The decoration of the hotel is exquisite, there are free parking spaces, there is a river outside the window, and the windows are also very soundproof.
Breakfast: Breakfast is not a buffet, one serving per person, with balanced nutrition. There was no milk on the first day, but after the reaction, there was milk immediately on the second day. great.
It is worth mentioning that Xiaoxue at the front desk has a very good service. I left something in the hotel and helped me find it and mail it home.
Disadvantages: I hope the hotel can have something like electric heating, it will be a bit cold at night. The plugs in the room were a bit underwhelming.

It is recommended that you live in a guild hall closer to the entrance of the scenic spot. It will cost tens of dollars more. It is only a few tens of meters away from the scenic spot, and the room is equipped with air conditioning.

msg:When booking, I specially read the bad reviews of the hotel and complained: there is no air conditioning. The hotel replied: The air conditioner is not installed but there is a cooler. Then I made a reservation with peace of mind. As a result, after checking in, I told me that the second floor was full, and the room arranged on the first floor didn't even have a cooling fan? ? It was stuffy and hot at night. The only window in the room that could be opened for ventilation was a place where people would pass by outside. Opening the window = no privacy for talking in the room + hearing the noise of passers-by. In the end, I could only close the windows and rest, I was so bored... When I was in a hurry to go out and drive out, there were a lot of cars parked indiscriminately at the door. This hotel has no advantages except that it is close to the entrance of the scenic spot. The room is not ventilated and the comfort is really low. Living in a room with no fan and no air conditioner for five or six hundred a night in summer is like a big injustice! ! ! ! It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve booked a hotel for many years, but I didn‚Äôt expect such a high score and such a bad experience
