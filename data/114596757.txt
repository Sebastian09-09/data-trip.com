This said, I had the chance to meet Mr.Wilson at the desk who can speak Chinese and English fluently which makes a big difference as a foreigner he also seemed to understand my culture which is a big plus . 

I highly recommend this hotel for the decor setting and exceptional service , I hope to meet Mr Wilson again 

Thanks

msg:During the Qingming Festival, I took my family to visit Oriental Oasis and stayed at Kuanjing Hotel. I found out from the Internet that the hotel was newly opened in 2023. It costs about 12 yuan to take a taxi from the subway.

The hotel is not big, with a garden style, a nice and quiet environment, and a very elegant and fairy-like landscape.

There are not many rooms in the hotel, and even on holidays, breakfast does not feel crowded. The breakfast is average, with everything you need, and the place is not big. There are not many dining options in the hotel. The Chinese restaurant is Huaiyang cuisine. The dishes are small but exquisite, and the price is slightly expensive, but the taste is very good. We ate there twice. If you don't want to eat in the restaurant, you can also order takeout.

The suite we booked is still very spacious and the hygiene is also acceptable. We added additional supplies such as purified water, quilts, toothbrushes, etc., and they were delivered quickly after a phone call. It's just that I didn't find a night light at night, and it was pitch black when the main control was turned off 😂😂

In short, I am quite satisfied with staying at Kuanjing Hotel this time.

msg:Overall, the sign is not clear. There is no sign to guide you when you drive in. You drive to the basement of the next community without any suspense. You have to go around a long way to find the hotel basement. From the B1 floor of the hotel basement to the front desk, you need to take two elevators and transfer in the middle. There is no sign for transfer. There are steps at the transfer elevator entrance. The lighting is dim, there is no sign to guide, and there is no staff. It is particularly unfriendly to drag luggage. If you don't meet enthusiastic people, you may have to look for a long time. The hotel has garden characteristics, the room is not big, but it is relatively clean. It is convenient to go to Rainbow Bridge, Oriental Oasis, and Zhujiajiao nearby.

In general, the hotel staff are very enthusiastic, the hardware is also good, mainly because it is really close to Oriental Land, and it is not so tiring to play.

msg:How to say it, this is not a pleasant accommodation experience.

Environment: The hotel environment is good, and the small courtyard surrounds the entire guest room. The hotel is in the villa area, I don’t know if it is the same developer. I always go to the wrong door when I drive out. I stayed for two nights until the last day when the security guard told the guests to go through the north gate, but I didn’t understand where the north gate was.

Facilities: The swimming pool and gym are good, not many people, especially the swimming pool, it’s quite comfortable to swim every day. I booked a double bed room, but because of the room facilities, I changed to a superior room. The room is quite large and the facilities are all brand new. Unfortunately, because it is new, the whole hotel is full of formaldehyde. It is in the elevator, and the smell in the room is even more. If it is a windowless guest room, it’s a few days to stay, and it’s really not recommended!

Service: Checked in on the first night, it was already 9 o'clock when I arrived at the hotel. The child said that the water was very hot when he took a bath. His father went to adjust it, but it was still very hot. Later, it was found that the hot and cold water pipes in this room were connected to hot water, and cold water could not be discharged. An aunt came and couldn’t fix it. The equipment master came and adjusted it for a long time but couldn’t fix it. The key is that the bathroom floor was full of water. Finally, I couldn't stand it anymore and called the hotel manager. He came in and took a look. He said that our master had adjusted it and said there was no problem. I was instantly furious! When the master left, he said that the water pipe in this room was connected incorrectly, and the manager said it was fixed right after he came? ! He also ignored the water on the ground. Later, after arguing for a long time, he asked me to change the room for you? He felt that I had given you the best service. His attitude and tone were really bad and he had no way to deal with it! I can only say that it is not a 5-star hotel. It doesn't even have the basic standard words for dealing with people and handling complaints! In the middle, I also said that the room smelled bad, and the hotel manager said that our hotel has been open for half a year and there is no smell! It's really a lie, probably because he has no sense of smell! 
Breakfast is also quite simple, only noodles and wontons are edible, and the replenishment of ingredients is also quite slow! I don't know if it's because there are too many guests staying in the hotel during the May Day holiday and the waiters can't keep up, or they don't want to replenish it at all. 
In short, it is not recommended to stay! The pictures are beautiful, but they are just pictures. There is no need to stay in a hotel without service!

This time I came to the Shanghai Xinjia Clothing Exhibition and arrived at the hotel a little late. The person who received my husband and me was Xiao Gao at the front desk. He was very enthusiastic. Our requests were also addressed one by one. Nowadays, there are very few front desk staff in hotels with such working conditions. They helped us to the elevator door. We stayed for three days and always responded to our requests. The hygiene and environment of the store are also super good. It is very new. Very clean. No odor. No moisture in the sunny room. I especially recommend the swimming pool. I really love it. I came here in June. I’m going to lock in this hotel. It’s so comfortable and I didn’t want to leave after staying there for three days.

The head chef also gave me donkey rolling ➕yoghurt. The manager also gave me 2 zaos of grape juice

Due to the new decoration, it is normal to have a slight smell. The service is very good and responsive. The voice assistant in the room is a bit easy to wake up by mistake, which is a bit confusing. Please adjust it. The distance from the bed to the TV is too far, which seems very small. There are few takeouts around, and it is not easy to order. Fortunately, you can order Chinese food in the room, and the breakfast is also very good. Overall, it meets expectations.

After reporting it to the customer service, the hot water was available, but all the water came out was yellow. It took half an hour for the water to become clear. , one can imagine how long it has been since the room had been occupied by guests. Let’s talk about breakfast: when we went there after 8 o’clock, there were only three people in the entire restaurant, not as many waiters as there were. The variety of breakfast is also pitiful, which is completely incompatible with the room price of more than 1,000. All in all, the experience is very poor.

打着療愈的幌子，沒有任何細節的處理，整體鬆散沒有亮點，佈局不合理，管理沒制度，一家體驗比較不愉快不推薦朋友來的酒店
1.窗户玻璃厚厚一層污漬，幾乎是不做任何清理工作
2.地板有灰塵，厚厚的一層。滿屋的飛絮。
3.衣櫃把手有灰，浴室角落很臟!
4.房間無垃圾桶?很離譜，不知道為什麼，沒法丟垃圾，衹能去廁所!
5.傢俱折舊嚴重，2023開業的酒店彷彿是2手傢俱，全都是劃痕磨損
6.冰箱不製冷!冰箱製冷max依然是常温!
7.熱水壺裡有不明污漬，本來想喝點熱水，都不敢使用
8.浴巾起球掉絮，使用後身上有毛絮
入住後看到所有一切以為房間忘記打掃，友善的提示重新做一次打掃，結果回到房間後一切如初，沒有絲毫變化，甚至以為沒有阿姨進過房間做過清理!
自助早餐好幾個菜是冷的，一整個早上從8:50-9:40用餐最高峯時間算上我們自己一共衹有4桌客人。

服務方面也是見到客人從未點頭打招呼，整體接待能力也比較薄弱，另外酒店的設計乍一看還不錯，但每一處細節都透露着粗糙感，用料很不講究，很不療愈。電梯不捨得開空調，走道里甲醛味嚴重。酒店地理位置也很奇怪，在一個類似居民小區的裏面??

地理位置:比較偏，靠近東方綠舟，從朱家角古鎮開車過去5公里左右，這一片都屬於城投集團的，裏面是開發的別墅和公寓，外面規劃成了酒店，目前來看可能更適合自駕。
服務:工作人員挺主動的，幫忙推行李，登記車號，前台的Sophia得知小朋友要做作業，還主動升級了房間，因為原本預訂的高級雙床房是不帶寫字枱的。登記完之後Jerry一路把我們送到客房。房間裏的水給足的，🈶8瓶。冬天必須調研！
餐飲:在酒店用的晚餐，除了上菜速度慢了點沒毛病，總廚還親自來對接問口感。早餐自助的，這個感覺一般，品種不是很多，如果定位4⭐或者5⭐之間的話，感覺有點差距。
環境:定位中式園林風，酒店公共區域不是很大，如果想要宅酒店可能衹能去健身房或者游泳池了。周邊配套還不齊全，便利店還沒有，這點不是很方便。

msg:拔草上海朱家角一家新開的酒店，就在古鎮旁邊。整個酒店裝修風格很別緻，適合打卡拍照🤳。房間裏是智能化設施，非常人性化。因為這次要去古鎮沒有時間使用酒店的健身設施，但是健身中心Tony經理熱情的做了介紹，看到帶着小孩，還拿了脈動給他，服務很貼心！最後不得不提一下早餐的羊肉麪，味道太地道啦！點贊寶藏酒店～～

msg:這是住過最滿意的酒店，首先是整個園林式的環境，佈局很好，如同一個小小景區，前台辦理入住時候還免費升級到了套房，真的驚喜萬分，因為我們是帶小孩入住，給我們配了小童拖鞋，小童洗漱用品，入住跟退房時都送了水果，工作人員服務很好，再是早餐也很豐富，用餐的餐廳有落地窗，窗外就是園林小橋流水，讓人心情舒暢，下次出行需要還會再次選擇入住。

msg:古鎮遊玩後，選擇寬璟酒店入住。整個酒店是在住宅小區內的，找酒店停車場費了些時間（晚上看不清指示牌，一開始停到住宅停車場去了）。
   酒店設計頗具巧思，客房內所用材料、傢俱及設施均一流。原來覺得新酒店裝修味道會很大，完全沒有。浴室很大，還有座椅（非常人性化），讓我眼前一亮。
   服務可與兩三千一晚的酒店相媲美，牙刷和刮鬍刀等不等我們提，前台小哥就主動給到我們了。電話客房服務多給雙拖鞋，不一會兒小哥就來了，並且是雙手遞送的（印象深刻）。我們家14歲小朋友的早餐是送的，開心😃。退房時，前台小哥哥也是全程微笑服務。
