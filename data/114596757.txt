This said, I had the chance to meet Mr.Wilson at the desk who can speak Chinese and English fluently which makes a big difference as a foreigner he also seemed to understand my culture which is a big plus . 

I highly recommend this hotel for the decor setting and exceptional service , I hope to meet Mr Wilson again 

Thanks

msg:During the Qingming Festival, I took my family to visit Oriental Oasis and stayed at Kuanjing Hotel. I found out from the Internet that the hotel was newly opened in 2023. It costs about 12 yuan to take a taxi from the subway.

The hotel is not big, with a garden style, a nice and quiet environment, and a very elegant and fairy-like landscape.

There are not many rooms in the hotel, and even on holidays, breakfast does not feel crowded. The breakfast is average, with everything you need, and the place is not big. There are not many dining options in the hotel. The Chinese restaurant is Huaiyang cuisine. The dishes are small but exquisite, and the price is slightly expensive, but the taste is very good. We ate there twice. If you don't want to eat in the restaurant, you can also order takeout.

The suite we booked is still very spacious and the hygiene is also acceptable. We added additional supplies such as purified water, quilts, toothbrushes, etc., and they were delivered quickly after a phone call. It's just that I didn't find a night light at night, and it was pitch black when the main control was turned off üòÇüòÇ

In short, I am quite satisfied with staying at Kuanjing Hotel this time.

msg:Overall, the sign is not clear. There is no sign to guide you when you drive in. You drive to the basement of the next community without any suspense. You have to go around a long way to find the hotel basement. From the B1 floor of the hotel basement to the front desk, you need to take two elevators and transfer in the middle. There is no sign for transfer. There are steps at the transfer elevator entrance. The lighting is dim, there is no sign to guide, and there is no staff. It is particularly unfriendly to drag luggage. If you don't meet enthusiastic people, you may have to look for a long time. The hotel has garden characteristics, the room is not big, but it is relatively clean. It is convenient to go to Rainbow Bridge, Oriental Oasis, and Zhujiajiao nearby.

In general, the hotel staff are very enthusiastic, the hardware is also good, mainly because it is really close to Oriental Land, and it is not so tiring to play.

msg:How to say it, this is not a pleasant accommodation experience.

Environment: The hotel environment is good, and the small courtyard surrounds the entire guest room. The hotel is in the villa area, I don‚Äôt know if it is the same developer. I always go to the wrong door when I drive out. I stayed for two nights until the last day when the security guard told the guests to go through the north gate, but I didn‚Äôt understand where the north gate was.

Facilities: The swimming pool and gym are good, not many people, especially the swimming pool, it‚Äôs quite comfortable to swim every day. I booked a double bed room, but because of the room facilities, I changed to a superior room. The room is quite large and the facilities are all brand new. Unfortunately, because it is new, the whole hotel is full of formaldehyde. It is in the elevator, and the smell in the room is even more. If it is a windowless guest room, it‚Äôs a few days to stay, and it‚Äôs really not recommended!

Service: Checked in on the first night, it was already 9 o'clock when I arrived at the hotel. The child said that the water was very hot when he took a bath. His father went to adjust it, but it was still very hot. Later, it was found that the hot and cold water pipes in this room were connected to hot water, and cold water could not be discharged. An aunt came and couldn‚Äôt fix it. The equipment master came and adjusted it for a long time but couldn‚Äôt fix it. The key is that the bathroom floor was full of water. Finally, I couldn't stand it anymore and called the hotel manager. He came in and took a look. He said that our master had adjusted it and said there was no problem. I was instantly furious! When the master left, he said that the water pipe in this room was connected incorrectly, and the manager said it was fixed right after he came? ! He also ignored the water on the ground. Later, after arguing for a long time, he asked me to change the room for you? He felt that I had given you the best service. His attitude and tone were really bad and he had no way to deal with it! I can only say that it is not a 5-star hotel. It doesn't even have the basic standard words for dealing with people and handling complaints! In the middle, I also said that the room smelled bad, and the hotel manager said that our hotel has been open for half a year and there is no smell! It's really a lie, probably because he has no sense of smell! 
Breakfast is also quite simple, only noodles and wontons are edible, and the replenishment of ingredients is also quite slow! I don't know if it's because there are too many guests staying in the hotel during the May Day holiday and the waiters can't keep up, or they don't want to replenish it at all. 
In short, it is not recommended to stay! The pictures are beautiful, but they are just pictures. There is no need to stay in a hotel without service!

msg:I have been working outside for a long time and often stay in hotels. Because I am a bit obsessed with germs, I have to make repeated comparisons when choosing a hotel. This time I came to the Shanghai Xinjia Clothing Exhibition and arrived at the hotel a little late. The person who received my husband and me was Xiao Gao at the front desk. He was very enthusiastic. Our requests were also addressed one by one. Nowadays, there are very few front desk staff in hotels with such working conditions. They helped us to the elevator door. We stayed for three days and always responded to our requests. The hygiene and environment of the store are also super good. It is very new. Very clean. No odor. No moisture in the sunny room. I especially recommend the swimming pool. I really love it. I came here in June. I‚Äôm going to lock in this hotel. It‚Äôs so comfortable and I didn‚Äôt want to leave after staying there for three days.

The only complaint is that the bottom of the glass door of the shower room is not waterproof, so a lot of bath water leaks outside.

Due to the new decoration, it is normal to have a slight smell. The service is very good and responsive. The voice assistant in the room is a bit easy to wake up by mistake, which is a bit confusing. Please adjust it. The distance from the bed to the TV is too far, which seems very small. There are few takeouts around, and it is not easy to order. Fortunately, you can order Chinese food in the room, and the breakfast is also very good. Overall, it meets expectations.

After reporting it to the customer service, the hot water was available, but all the water came out was yellow. It took half an hour for the water to become clear. , one can imagine how long it has been since the room had been occupied by guests. Let‚Äôs talk about breakfast: when we went there after 8 o‚Äôclock, there were only three people in the entire restaurant, not as many waiters as there were. The variety of breakfast is also pitiful, which is completely incompatible with the room price of more than 1,000. All in all, the experience is very poor.
