msg:We had a great experience staying at Ship hotel for a long weekend. The kids were so delighted with the boat and nautical theme of the hotel, a big playground, and a nice clean pool. The service was kind and thoughtful, decorating our room and giving us a cake for my daughter’s birthday and providing kids’ amenities.   The staff are friendly. It’s a paradise for kids.  The cost was not high, but our kids preferred this hotel to many others.  

The room is a little old but still in good condition and also has nice touches like a ships’ window, ocean shore carpet, and we had a very nice view. Room was clean and bed was comfortable and there was a pillow menu.  Good water pressure in the bathroom and nice bathtub.  

The hotel is also next door to a ecological park which has boat rides, and about a 10 minute drive to paopao park which is a huge, beautiful recreational area with lakes, lots of grass for picnics, bike paths, gardens and a kids play area.   We could’ve easily spent 2-3 days just in paopao park alone.  

We arrived on Friday night and Saturday morning was quiet at breakfast with few people.

msg:During my recent stay at the Shanghai Ship Shaped Hotel, I found several positives to highlight.

Firstly, check-in was a breeze, and the service provided by the staff was commendable throughout my stay. Their attentiveness and friendliness made me feel welcome.

Cleanliness was another strong point of this hotel; I didn't encounter any issues in this department. The rooms were tidy and well-maintained, creating a pleasant atmosphere for my stay.

However, it's worth noting that the hotel's location is quite distant from most attractions in the city, which might not be ideal for travelers seeking a more central base. Additionally, while the rooms were clean, they could benefit from being a bit more spacious.

*Free breakfast so that was a plus

We were told that the main control was turned off to save money, and we were asked to open the window to cool down... Which five-star five-star hotel would take care of its guests like this? Is it because we didn’t deserve the money we spent? When we went swimming at night, it was clearly written that the hotel closed at 21:30, but they started to chase guests away at 21:00, saying that they were going to get off work and do the finishing work of disinfection. Then why did they write 21:30? It would have been better to write 21:00! Then they told us that the swimming pool was outsourced! I don’t want to say more about the rest. If you want to stay here, go and experience it yourself!

Went to Jiuke Shuyanzi Academy, an internet celebrity check-in spot 2 kilometers away. On the second day, we checked into the 3-kilometer Bubble Park ~ Ant Paradise, where we could fly kites, slide, dig in the sand, and swing...

(We arrived late) There are no small shops around, so we can only go to Baolong. The Chinese food on the third floor is too expensive and the quantity is small. Not recommended ~ Breakfast is basically okay, you can eat whatever you want, it has everything you need, just a normal breakfast. There are several children's play items that are okay. The rainbow slide is a chargeable item of 10/1 time. I recommend that the hotel gives this item as a gift. Because you pull it up yourself and have a staff member push it up. Each child can be appropriately limited (2_3 times)

I was satisfied with the room and everything. The only thing I wasn’t satisfied with was that I was dissatisfied with the buffet dinner in the restaurant from the waiter's attitude to the manager's ability to handle things. Also, what does it mean that you are reluctant to give out salmon and barbecue? If the salmon is not cut, put it out. If you don’t ask the waiter if you want it, it will not be grilled. After asking for grilling, you will only grill a few skewers. If the dishes are missing, ask the manager if he will replenish them? The manager said it would not be repaired. The outdoor children's playground facilities are a bit old. I hope they can be maintained! Before leaving, a beautiful manager in the lobby asked us for our opinion. I also gave a dissatisfied attitude. The manager had a very good attitude and let us play the rainbow slide for free. I hope the attitude of the restaurant can be improved in the future.

After we checked out and left, the ship found the gloves we had missed and enthusiastically delivered them to us directly from the hotel. It was very heart-warming. Thank you very much. Will continue to stay next time.

msg:Hotel package purchased on Ctrip (room rate + buffet dinner + two free glasses of beer)
First of all, the room was not cleaned properly, and there were unknown objects stuck to the side of the sink. It must be that the housekeeping service did not pay attention to the details.

Secondly, the hotel swimming pool is too dirty and turbid! To be honest, it would be better not to have this swimming pool, wear swimming goggles and dive under the water, with tiny particles visible to the naked eye floating in the water. There is actually a coach giving swimming lessons in the hotel swimming pool. It is the first time I have seen such a "multi-purpose pool" to make money. The manager also drops something like eye drops in the swimming pool from time to time. I don’t know what kind of liquid it is. After swimming, my daughter still had a few bumps on her arms...

Then I want to complain about the buffet provided. The buffet dinner has very few varieties, but there is even toast as the staple food for dinner? It can't help but make people think that it is leftover from breakfast. The meal bag is still tangled with hair, the roasted sweet potatoes are also cold and not kept warm, the red trout is used as salmon, and the meat in the hot pot is all synthetic meat. The only buffet dinner was not full. I don’t know what to eat either.

After dinner, I went to pick up the delivered craft beer at the bar on the sixth floor. While I was waiting, I saw that the place where the ingredients were placed in the bar was really messy and dirty, with ham hanging on the top. Is this food hygiene really good?
Then when it comes to service, the service in various areas is not very good. First of all, you can’t see bath towels provided when you go around the swimming pool. Our family brought the ones in the room by ourselves, but my friend’s family didn’t bring them. The children came out and were all covered with towels. I was shaking, and I heard other guests say that I had to ask the bar for it, but the bar was far away from the swimming pool and it was unscientific. Next, we ate at the buffet and went to register. We were obviously together. The service staff arranged two separate dining tables for our two families. The person leading the way didn’t know where the seat numbers were. Later, I found out that everyone was sitting casually, and there were many Seats eight. There are cleaners in the corridor. If I ask them for a new pair of slippers, they will also be asked what room I want to use. I just want a pair of slippers...

When I finally checked out, I went to the front desk to refund the deposit. My friend asked me why I paid the deposit. I said it was requested by the front desk, but you didn’t pay? I asked the front desk why he only asked me to pay the deposit. He said that it was because the two orders were made together. When I checked in, my friend and I didn't speak to each other during the separate check-in. How could they tell me apart? We are together. If a guest I don’t know is also bound to me, what is the significance of this deposit?

Some people may think that the price of 910 per night including dinner is hypocritical, but I think in the service industry, if the food and hygiene services are not in place in all aspects, then it is better to close down early...

It occurred to me that there is a deck at the Grand Boat Hotel, so I should be able to see it. The result was an unexpected surprise. My daughter was very happy watching the sun rise at a speed visible to the naked eye. I also gave her a detailed lesson on geography. Give Big Boat Hotel a thumbs up.

msg:The economy is sluggish, and I want to take my baby to relax while keeping my pockets, so I bought a package, and my expectations were not very high. For a short trip, I didn't expect the price to be very high.
The natural landscape around the hotel is very good, the appearance is like a cruise ship, and there are many elements of a cruise ship in the interior details. Although the hotel is a little old, it does not affect the original a**osphere and fun of the cruise ship.
What is remarkable is the catering. The food in the buffet is not high-end, and there are not many varieties, but I personally think that the ingredients are fresh. Among them, the boiled chicken is amazing, and it is a long-lost childhood chicken fragrance. The package also comes with supper in the evening. There are not many varieties, but the hotel's hospitality is commendable. In addition, I went to the bar after dinner. The decoration of the bar is very distinctive, and there is a dancing machine inside. The bartender that night was a lady. She was very enthusiastic about making machines for the children. She also introduced us to many facilities that the hotel owner cares about. , Children's pool table... In short, this leisure trip is very pleasant. The Ship Hotel does not have the coldness of the hotel, but more down-to-earth services. By the way, when I left the hotel, I found a great treasure, a cultural corridor introducing the origin of currency. I browsed it with my children and gained a lot of knowledge.

msg:Absolutely bad review. The deluxe twin room is dirty and the old furniture is broken. The service is unreasonably poor. The room of the two mothers has not been cooled because of the air conditioner (about an hour after checking in), and the staff came to see it. Not good, I can only arrange to change the room, and the cleaning aunt told the old man that the room has been messed up. . . The two old men still had to look at her face. Please, is it us who are bothering you? After moving around, I have encountered a broken air conditioner, and I still have to suffer? ? Where did the high scores on Ctrip come from? The same is true for breakfast in the morning. The child took an extra tea egg and a small bread because he couldn’t eat it and felt it was a pity to throw it away. He asked the waiter if he had a fresh-keeping bag and was told that he could not take it out. I understand the rules, but I also I explained that I discussed with her because I didn't want to waste food, and she replied that you should eat it! Either it can only be wasted, in short, it cannot be taken away! It turns out that the philosophy of your hotel is that food is willing to be wasted and there is no room for other negotiations. The label of CD-ROM action on the table seems to be just for show. The front desk didn't show a good face when I checked out, and asked me to wait. . Now when you check out from the hotel outside, you just give the room card and you get the refund. I have to wait for a long time here. The final purpose is to ask, have you eaten the drinks in the refrigerator? What about the pattern? What about trust? The service staff guided in the lobby was also outrageous. I went to ask him where the rainbow slide was at noon, and let my child and I walk from the outside to the end. I went all the way under the sun, only to see that it said that it started at 2 pm. . . Then why not remind me beforehand? ? Then when I came back, I realized that I could walk from the inside of the hotel, and I didn’t need to go outside to bask in the sun. It was really a very speechless and angry experience!

The front desk will not tell you the time of breakfast when you check in, and will not take the initiative to inform you about the contents of the package and the toiletries! No service whatsoever! The male janitor in the lobby has a bad attitude towards children! There is also a package that includes supper, which starts at 10:00 p.m., and I only found out by phone that I will use it at the restaurant, and the price will be the normal price when it is delivered to the room. Excuse me, at this time, the baby is already asleep. Do you want me to leave her and go to the restaurant for supper? Since you choose to give benefits to guests, as a hotel, please don't be petty, there are no guests with children! The breakfast is quite rich, but no one collects the dishes, and the place where the swimming pool changes clothes has a bad smell and is not disinfected at all! Hotel consumption is high, 88 yuan for a cup of latte! Since it is positioned as a high-end hotel, I hope the service can keep up, and it will be eliminated sooner or later in the fiercely competitive Shanghai!

The overall design of the hotel is like a ship, and the decoration is still in the marine theme style. The hardware facilities in the room are old, and the area is relatively large. The lighting control is relatively convenient, the WiFi connection is relatively stable, and the supporting facilities of the hotel are relatively complete. The hotel is equipped with Chinese and Western restaurants , The lobby bar, banquet hall, office, gym, swimming pool, children's playground and other facilities are now outdoors, which is windy and not suitable for long-term play. The private room of the captain's cabin has a good view.
The service aspect is not bad, the waiter is polite, and the phone response speed is quite fast.
The breakfast quality of the beach restaurant on the seventh floor is very good, above average.
In terms of price, the price of Ctrip Diamond still has a little advantage, the price is moderate
All in all, although the location is far away, the facilities are good, the service is considerate, and the price is moderate. It's not bad to bring children to live in a hotel in the suburbs.

I thought I could spend time in a hotel, but there are too few parent-child programs and outdoors, so the experience is so-so. The rainbow slide is boring even for children. The deck club on the 6th floor is suitable for adults and group building. It should be more lively and more fun. , but because it is not very popular, it looks empty and deserted. I didn't experience the swimming pool because of Yangkang. The room is ok, as far as living is concerned, it's good.
Apart from the interior of the hotel, there is really nothing to do around. The Four Seasons Ecological Park looks like it has been in disrepair for a long time, and the only so-called manor that can be seen is under maintenance. Nine Trees' repertoires are too niche, and there are few parent-child shows, let alone eating, it's just a restaurant. Shanghai Fish's Bubble Park is not bad, you can take your baby around, but there are many similar parks, and it doesn't feel like a tourist. The Fengxian Museum didn't go as planned. There are only permanent exhibitions and no temporary exhibitions.
Summary: There is nothing fun in Fengxian. With this money and leisure, it is better to go to Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

msg:The appearance of the hotel is quite distinctive. From the underground parking lot to the lobby to the rooms, there are elements of the ocean and ships everywhere, but the maintenance is average and it feels old. The room is relatively large, with a balcony, and the bedding is relatively comfortable. Each room is also equipped with a bathtub. The breakfast is relatively rich. The only thing that is not so good is the fried rice and pot stickers, which need to be lined up.
There are also the following disadvantages:
1. The cooling effect of the air conditioner in some rooms is not good. The space in room 0917 is useless. I woke up in the middle of the night, sweating all over, and immediately adjusted it to 17 degrees. When I woke up in the morning, the room temperature was still 25 degrees, which is really unacceptable.
2. Regarding the 15% service fee, the hotel is not a standard five-star hotel, at best it can only be regarded as a luxury hotel, but it still charges 15% service fee according to the five-star standard, which feels unreasonable, and the hardware does not fully meet the standard. But the fees are the same.
3. There is still a gap in the service. The hotel was full on the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival, but when I called room service at night, there was only one service person, and I waited for a long time. There is no active introduction to the content included in the package, just passively waiting for me to ask. After the feedback of the problem, there is only apology, and there is no substantive response and processing.
4. The entrance is very unclear, and it is difficult to find according to the navigation.
In short, it belongs to a hotel with characteristics, but also has obvious shortcomings. If you have never been there, you can experience it once. It's no wonder that the score has dropped all the way, and has fallen below 4.5 points.

Because it is too hot, the children only play for a while. The indoor swimming pool is very large, but there are many people. The hotel buffet dinner and breakfast are good and rich in variety. Finally played Rainbow Road, not bad.

Will take the initiative to help, will take the initiative to say hello, to the room also take the initiative to provide children's wash bag and children's slippers!
The address and location are also OK, half an hour's drive from Bihai Jinsha and 10 minutes' drive from Shanghai Fish.
However, the hotel facilities are not very new, and the floor area is not large, but it can be regarded as "the sparrow is small, but it has all the internal organs)
In terms of food, it's average, no one in particular stands out.

msg:I went to Fengxian to play and was recommended by a friend to stay in this hotel. First of all, the deluxe room was good, as shown in the picture. It was spacious, bright and a**ospheric, but there was a little episode at night. The housekeeping depar**ent is responsive, there are children's bathrobes, slippers and toiletries provided, and the room is full of garbage and it will be cleaned up in time. Thank you very much for the hard work of the cleaning aunt! The only hardware that needs improvement is the lack of a clothesline in the bathroom. Next, let’s talk about the facilities on other floors. The swimming pool is the highlight. It is divided into a baby pool and a regular swimming pool. The water depth is at most 1.6m. On weekends, more people go to the dumplings. The dressing room is not cleaned in time. The floor is full of hair and water. There is a Four Seasons Ecological Park next to the last hotel of the rainbow slide. If the weather is not hot, you can stroll around. The nucleic acid point is about 500 meters away from the Four Seasons Ecological Park.

Not many people go there on weekdays. The overall room is relatively comfortable, but , the swimming pool environment is very poor! As a hotel with a swimming pool as a selling point, the guests who stay in must go there for vacation purposes, but the swimming pool of the Big Boat Hotel is open to the outside world, and there are a lot of people, there are many coaches and students, let us go on vacation and leisure We couldn't swim at all, and even told us that we didn't even have a locker. We had to go back to our room and change our swimsuits before entering the pool, and until 9 pm, there were still a lot of people, which was a very bad experience.

The breakfast is very rich and there are many varieties of dinner. Although there are small crayfish and no salmon, there are sea bream.

msg:Big Ship Hotel, when you hear its name, you know the style of building decoration. As soon as you enter the lobby, it is like stepping on the deck, looking up at the starry solar system, and under your feet are the waves. After checking in, I followed the &quot;sailor&quot; down the cabin corridor for a long time, and then came to the elevator at the stern. Paper and alcohol gel are placed next to the elevator buttons, so that guests can press the floor buttons without contact, which is very considerate. As soon as the elevator door opens, there is a painting in front of you. It is very distinctive. You must not think of it. It is a landscape painting arranged and combined with thousands of pushpins. The room is also a cabin style, with a large bathtub, a sloping bedside table, and a characteristic &quot;boat window&quot;. The most eye-catching is the oasis outside the floor-to-ceiling window. It is an ecological park, and the hotel has direct access, which is very convenient. After settling in well, I can&#39;t wait to play the rainbow slide and watch a 4D movie. The waiters are very enthusiastic, with good service, good attitude and good speech. The rainbow slide is infinitely playable, and 4D movies are also a good experience. They were tired from playing and rested in the room. I sat by the window with the tulle drawn and quietly wrote down my feelings...

The buffet dinner has small hot pot and crayfish, and the juice is also freshly squeezed. There is also a small children&#39;s playground next to the restaurant, which can be said to be very intimate. When the hotel learned about the baby&#39;s birthday, it also prepared a big cake, very hearty!

It is suitable for bringing children, but children's entertainment facilities are mostly outdoors, and it is a bit freezing in winter. The room is good overall, and the bathroom is well-appointed. The interior is also not fancy. The bed is more comfortable. The breakfast environment is good. Although the room is full, it is far less crowded than imagined, and the variety to eat is quite rich. The six-deck entertainment program is rich, and it really feels like being in the cabin, with a gym, swimming pool, bar, billiards, and a huge outdoor platform. Home-brewed beer is the specialty here, but it doesn't feel like it's freshly brewed. It's been left for a long time, and the gas is gone. I wanted to order a long island iced tea, but there was no bartender at the bar, so the clerk couldn't make it, and even took out a handwritten production instruction, which was very funny, but the attitude was still very good, and finally gave up. Hope to be able to do enough in the details. The surrounding environment can only be said to be average. The advantage is that it is very close to the Shanghai Fish, and you can bend it when you have time. Overall, it's ok, and there is room for improvement in the price/performance ratio. Mainly in the refinement of services and further optimization of entertainment space can also spend some effort.

Booked two premium double rooms, one is not bad, the other is obviously not worth 1500 a night, the bathroom is dark and windowless, the bath water is very small, there is no stepping stool in the parent-child hotel, children can't reach the sink Various inconveniences.
The banquet hall was full on Saturdays, so the parking problem was very irritating. The temporary meal occupied the parking space, and we had to be stopped outside the door to wait for the parking space!
During breakfast, there was a burst of smell of disinfectant water in the swimming pool, and the diners were slow to add more food, and there was nothing to eat when it was late. The point is that the waiters and chefs have already shown their impatient attitudes, and there is no time. There is no longer a meal.
There are only a few children's entertainment facilities on the deck, which is not fun! The swimming pool has personal swimming lessons. The swimming pool is open to the public, so it is crowded with people and the water is dirty! The rest of the entertainment in the bar will cost money, plus 15% service charge, a glass of watermelon juice is 43 yuan!
In short, the experience is really bad.

msg:I may have high expectations for the hotel, so I was a little disappointed after staying for 2 nights. First of all, there was a problem with the air conditioner in the room I booked. The high temperature of 40 degrees made the room extremely hot. After negotiating with the hotel, I changed the room, but there was obviously a problem with the room layout. Then I changed a room without a bathtub under the coordination of Ctrip customer service. The problem is solved. When it comes to hotel services, I always feel very stiff, and whenever there is a need to pay, I will first talk about the money issue. Children who are taller than a little bit have to measure the price very seriously. As a parent-child hotel , I really can't love it. The water in the swimming pool feels particularly turbid, and there are many private teachers teaching the children outside, so many people are messy.
Shouldn't recommend other friends to this hotel.

Due to the check-in on Friday, there are not many people in the swimming pool in the evening. The water temperature of the children's pool is relatively warm. Several faucets in the shower place are broken. The hotel can repair it. We will take the baby back directly. After taking a bath, it will be warmer to avoid catching a cold. The next day I played the rainbow slide and 4D movie. The children still think the rainbow slide is more exciting and the height is not high. It is suitable for children to play. Hotel, the price/performance ratio is quite high, not as bad as said in the previous reviews, maybe we are off the peak, the hotel service staff are very enthusiastic

Location: Fengxian, but there are shopping malls in the surrounding area, Baolong is close by, and Suning and Bailian are a little further away. Basically (within 1-4 kilometers)
Hotel environment: very good, the appearance of the cruise ship is also clean. We live on the 16th floor and are given VIP trea**ent. The room is very large, especially the bathroom, which is very large.
Hotel service: The staff is very friendly, from the front desk to the dining bar to the housekeeping depar**ent. . We all say hello when we see it. Problem solved immediately. Very satisfied.
Hotel Facilities: The swimming pool of the hotel is not very big, but the design is very beautiful. The bed and utensils in the room are very good. The air conditioner is too hot, hahahaha. . Turn off the air conditioner at night, sleep with the window open, cover the quilt, and sleep until dawn. Get up early in the morning, the lighting is good, don't do it. There is also a rainbow slide next to the hotel, and the children had a great time. The open-air children's play facilities on the plywood on the 6th floor are more suitable for young children.
Hotel food and beverage: I ate a buffet breakfast. Because it was a VIP, I arranged to dine on the 6th floor. The 7th floor is open to all rooms in the hotel. In order to prevent overcrowding, the hotel was careful during the Chinese New Year, thinking about the crowds and noise, so a breakfast spot was added on the 6th floor, and the dining was quiet and comfortable. Basically, the waiter brings it to the table, very considerate and attentive.
Another: Because the electric toothbrush of a child was leaked in the hotel, the hotel immediately called me twice to ask, which was really unexpected. It will also be shipped to me. Really appreciate the staff at Ofuna Hotel. thank you all! !

After checking in, I can only say that the price is okay to walk the baby, but it should not be brushed twice. The hotel still feels more casual to me (not doing things according to the inherent rules)
You have to say that there are baby walking facilities (trampolines, 4D movies, swimming pools), but they are not surprising enough. Like walking my baby, I may prefer Kerry Hotel Pudong and Bo Rui, two styles of parent-child hotels in Sanjiagang Greenland. Baby walking facilities are more abundant and larger.
Although the breakfast is not expensive (68 per person in the hotel, 35 half price for children), it is relatively ordinary.
You can experience it on a big ship, and you won't brush it twice.

There were important documents in it. It was Ms. Zhang, the supervisor on the 6th floor, who called the next day and found that she lost her handbag. . Fortunately, the service staff who cleaned the room picked it up, thank you very much, this is probably the biggest highlight of my stay this time. Thanks again to the service staff on the night of February 2 on the 6th floor, and the supervisor Ms. Zhang. The gym and sports hall on the 6th floor are also worth a visit.

As soon as they stepped in, they immediately asked three times: Where did you come from? We're eating here, did you pay? What is your room number? ! I won't go there again.

The hotel's room service is not bad, but the outsourced swimming pool open to the outside world has lowered all expectations and goodwill. No slippers and towels provided, hair dirty all over the locker room, disgusting, and suffocating from the pool heat, the lifeguard kept fanning. There are too many people, and this density is deliberately avoided on weekends, and it still feels like dumplings are served from morning to night. There was a lot of people in the swimming pool. The heat wave and noise scared the two-and-a-half-year-old child twice. He cried and said that he could not swim.

msg:To be honest, I was quite disappointed from the check-in to the buffet at the beginning. 1) I took my parents to check in a total of two rooms, and there were no rooms connected together. I asked the front desk and said it was okay whether they were far away, but they were at the two ends of the aisle separated by an elevator corridor. The check-in did not inform the normal process of the hotel facilities and the breakfast location time. 2) Take your parents to the room first, and the tabletop is greasy or something. I don't know if Auntie puts the cup for making tea in the bottom of the coffee cup drawer to wash the two cups less or why. At first, we thought that there was only a coffee cup. 3) Ask the room service aunt at the door can you give two more bottles of water. The child needs to make milk. The aunt is very unwilling to say that he can give two more bottles at most, otherwise it will cost money to buy. This is the first time I have encountered it since staying in a hotel. 4) The pool is a bit cold and be prepared mentally. 5) The swimming pool should wear a shower cap (of course this is normal). There was no reminder when registering. When I went in, I said that both adults and children must bring it. Then I ran to the registration office to buy a swimming cap. Pay, ask if you can come out and pay again because the phone is locked in the fitting room, and you can’t just pay in cash. Okay, go in and get your phone and come out again. Two hours before the check-in, it was almost a day of refund if the room hadn't been paid for. 6) The buffet, breakfast and dinner are really average, there is nothing to eat (not something is still there) and I don’t know how to start with a plate. The steak counter for dinner is always empty. 7) There are several hidden safety hazards in the amu*****t equipment on the deck. There is a danger that the screws of the slide have fallen off. There is nothing to fix the slide beside the climbing frame, which is dangerous. There is a danger of breaking the swing.
—— But but but, the child had a good time, replacing all unsatisfactory. In the future, it will be for the baby's swimming pool. It is estimated that they will not come again. Praise for the receptionists who answered the phone after check-in, and will always provide service needs quickly. There is a small restaurant opposite the hotel, but the menu is very cost-effective and tastes good. The eco-park next to the hotel is great for camping with tents.

🍃Environment: 55 square meters of room is very spacious, the big bed room is international five-star standard, the temperature is also very constant, all rooms are marble style. Tucao: Don’t put stickers on the bathroom glass, it looks like an express hotel. The furniture used is also very particular and very comfortable.

🚗 Transportation: in Fengxian. It's driving anyway, so I don't feel like not commenting on the traffic.

🔔Service: Very satisfied with the service! The front desk gave us exclusive courtesy. On each floor, there are different activities and discounts, we went to each one! Especially the chefs of the Cantonese Chinese restaurant on the third floor are superb! It is recommended that you do not go to the buffet, the level of the buffet is just as ordinary as the price. In Cantonese cuisine, the level of the restaurant is completely Michelin-grade! Don't be greedy for cheap, buffet is not recommended. Tucao, the price of Cantonese Chinese restaurant is a bit high, if the price can be adjusted slightly, it would be better, but the taste is really good, so you can accept it!

The bar, the environment is very good, is American style. There are many game facilities to play, but because the main product is beer, the beer brewed by the hotel is very distinctive. But we are all girls who don't like to drink beer on the spot, and we don't have the ability to mix drinks. The aunt in charge is still very patient, enthusiastic and responsible. Thank you very much.

In short, it was a very satisfying and surprising journey.

The hotel has a unique appearance and looks like a ship as a whole. She especially likes the swimming pool of the ship hotel. There is a separate small pool, which is very friendly to young children who can't swim. It is possible to open classes to foreigners. This time there are obviously more than twice as many swimmers than last time.
The Premier Room is on the 16th floor and is relatively quiet. The room is large and the view is very good. It would be better if there is a balcony. It is very convenient for the hotel to order takeaway. You can watch TV in the shower or bath. There are many types of breakfast in the hotel, and the service staff are enthusiastic.
This time there is an episode. I left in a hurry when I checked out and left my daughter’s swimming quick-drying towels. Here, I would like to thank the foremen Xu Mei and Xiao Ling for getting in touch with me at the first time.

Stayed in Dachuan for 3 days and 2 nights. Overall it is a very good hotel, especially the hotel’s cafeteria. The price of 120 adults and 65 children is very beautiful in Shanghai. The food and beverages inside are what they should have in a cafeteria, as well as free draft beer and red wine. This must be liked👍
Then talk about the service of the hotel, the service of the housekeeping depar**ent is very enthusiastic, and we have tried our best to meet our requirements, and the cleaning aunt is very lucky. But the check-in service at the front desk is still lacking. The elevator at the bow of the hotel cannot reach the floor of our room, and we need to take the elevator at the stern, but the staff at the front desk did not give a reminder. For the guests who have just checked in, they are dragging large bags to find the elevator. The experience is not so good.
Finally, I want to talk about the hotel’s swimming pool. In the peak summer season, there are many residents and many children playing in the water, but there are also many coaches who take their children to learn to swim in the swimming pool, making the small swimming pool even more crowded. It can be said that this is the most crowded hotel pool I have ever stayed in. It is not impossible for the hotel to take advantage of its own swimming pool and coaches to conduct swimming training, but it is mixed with the guests, and the children playing in the water are kicked by the children learning breaststroke from time to time. This experience is really not good The points to be deducted are the smell of the water in the showers and toilets in the swimming pool, which I hope the hotel can pay attention to. so. It could have been awarded a five-star hotel, but because of the hardware and software services of the swimming pool, half a star has to be subtracted.

msg:A characteristic hotel with a ship-shaped appearance can be regarded as a landmark building. The indoor swimming pool, the children’s playground on the deck, and the cafeteria are all pretty good, a good place to go on holiday. For epidemic prevention and control, even the sea lions at the door had to wear masks😷

msg:For a weekend trip, I specially booked a distinguished double bed room. Want a bathtub with a view of the scenery... However, this stay was the most disappointing five-star hotel experience ever. This hotel can only be regarded as a budget hotel at best.
First of all, Shanghai has been banning smoking for some time, but the elevator reached the 17th floor where we were staying, and there was a very strong smell of smoke! The room also smelled of smoke, and the bedding also smelled of smoke. I don't understand, is this huge hotel ignoring Shanghai's fire protection and smoking bans? Can I smoke in the room?
Second, because an 11-month-old baby was staying, I asked for a crib, and when I made the bedding, I found that the mattress was severely moist and moldy! Wasn’t it checked during layout? How can such a thing sleep a little baby?
Third, there is a strong smell in the bathroom! Communicate with the hotel and ask me to open the window... open the window? Isn't it terrible? The smell in the bathroom seems to be normal. The exhaust air in the bathroom is bad. I don't do it or change the room for us, but tell us to open the window? The window that let us open is a floor-to-ceiling window. A child can easily climb out... What a terrible thing! While the hotel does not solve the problem of room odor, it has no sense of safety!
Fourth, the sanitation situation is worrying. There is dust everywhere. Where do you wipe the alcohol cotton? I didn't come here to check in. I came to help you clean, or paid to do the cleaning, right?
Fifth, the hotel buffet is very cheap, 120 per person, but super super super unpalatable! My husband had diarrhea at night after eating. Fortunately, I didn’t eat much because I had to take the kids, so it’s a blessing in misfortune~
Sixth, the hotel swimming pool is all here to learn to swim! There are so many people! Obviously it is not a standard swimming pool, and it is not so clean. During the epidemic, there is no need to green code the itinerary. The parents of the children are like dumplings, which is deeply disturbing.
Seventh, the waiter handles it during checkout. Ask me if I need an invoice, but no answer. Then please check and sign the bill. Isn’t this a normal process? After all, I also have a hotel to sign the bill! Do you want to cancel the credit card authorization, must I confirm the bill? I only gave it to me after I asked repeatedly. It doesn't seem to be necessary for me to sign it, it's just for me. Doesn't it need to be confirmed? Then how do I know if you're doing the billing for me? The process is messy!
Overall it does not meet the requirements of a five-star hotel. My husband and I did not leave happily, but flee! Yes! The double enjoyment of smoke + smell, service + unclean 4D experience, for us, let's escape! too frightening!
The only thing that can be exaggerated is the appearance of the hotel. The look of a ship can be regarded as a landmark, right? There are little arrangements of boats everywhere. But it is indeed quite township, soil! Children like it, but there is no one to care about it. Parents must take good care of the children, not to mention hygiene, anyway, children have to wash their skins when playing.
Generally speaking, no! push! recommend! It's an experience that makes the scalp numb when you want to come! Please pay attention to the relevant person in charge! ! !

Environment: looks like a ship outside, there is a four seasons garden next to it, because it is too hot to go inside, there are many models of ships and art portraits, there is also deck park on the 7th floor, although not much to do, enough for children
Service: Restaurant service and room service were superb, very polite and kind to customers
Amenities: The only downside is that it was going to the pool, but many children learn to swim in the pool, is outsourced to others, and the children are learning to swim, parents are watching it, very noisy and noisy, originally a relatively small dressing room, more and more crowded, this points deducted

msg:Bring my parents and the whole family to spend a weekend in the museum to see the Sanxingdui cultural relics. Surrounded by forests, small rivers and crooked rivers, nearby Powerlong Plaza is full of food, drink and fun. It is indeed a good place for urbanites to spend their weekend leisure and vacation in the suburbs. The rooms are spacious, bright and comfortable, and the facilities are worthy of five stars. I needed extra room supplies and Bundy soon. The breakfast was rich and delicious. In addition to the waiter's service awareness and enthusiasm, it needs to be improved. I wanted a room card as a memorial and was taken away, a bit stingy, overall the experience is good

msg:The deluxe double bed room is the same color as the photo. Facing the Four Seasons Park, the bathtub is really a long time without hot water. It is faster to use the shower head to drain water. The other beautiful glass chandelier scenes are not as disappointing as the photos on the website. The swimming pool is the same. But there are no slippers, no sauna, no steaming, no massage loungers, no towels for us, and there are kids coaches who are noisy and can’t swim. The steps on the side are very slippery and dangerous. The breakfast is generous and the buffet is good. Dinner prices are affordable. If you are connected to the park, you can swipe your room card to get in. Many places inside are completed within half an hour of maintenance. The hotel KTV seems to be very hot at night and I heard people’s voices and I didn’t go in to experience it. It’s a bit far away from the subway for 15 minutes to walk.

The breakfast fruit in the morning was very stale. The most important thing was that the meat in the steamed buns and pan-fried was sour. It’s deteriorating, but when checking out, the lady at the front desk was sincere and called me to say compensation. I don’t need compensation. I hope you can make corrections. As a star-rated hotel, it’s true that you can take out such fruits and breakfast food.

Floor-to-ceiling windows, the scenery is great, the sofa will rotate 360 degrees, and the baby has been playing for a long time😄. The bathtub is also good, and the hottest water temperature is not very hot when the water is discharged, so it is more comfortable. Swimming pool, children's playground for a long time, the buffet in the evening to close the stalls, some first made egg cones, crispy and fragrant, I ate several 😄 Not far from there are Powerlong Plaza and Bubble Park, where you can play a lot.

It is estimated that it has been contracted out. Without the services of a star hotel, it has become a swimming club. After 5 o’clock there is a lot of learning to swim, after 8 o’clock. I'm here to take a bath, it is recommended to divide a learning lane

幾個小建議：
1. 室內裝修方面，還需要提升一下品味感，客房區一半走廊藍色燈光着實費解。
2. 晚餐的選擇是否可以回覆一部分幾年前原有的本地風味菜，價格更親民的那種。現在衹有下午🍵🈶這類選擇。
3. 客房衞生間的清理需要更上心一些，淋雨放置物台還留有之前客人遺留的垃圾。
4. 展板設計品味有帶提升，比如船頭婚宴的廣告，入味滿滿，p圖不到心…

小朋友完全的還是很開心的

5層冰吧非常值得去看看，海螺的前台造型，冰川的柱子。
6層健身房、游泳池、酒吧。泳池是特色，小童泳池有點小，就一個小圈。6樓通向甲板層的户外有個室外的小童樂園，類似亞馬遜探險樂園，需1.4米以上小童玩。
7層沙灘餐廳，自助早餐、晚餐都是在7樓用餐，
環境非常好。
11層的船長室其實是個大的宴會廳，做得30個人，環境不錯聚會好地方。
酒店旁邊就是一個生態園，白天可以過去散散
步，裏面有歐式涼亭、小橋河流，還有足球場，
是個不錯的天然氧吧_
附近還有個壹品倉，游完泳逛個街，完美的一天！

另外，自助餐廳中規中矩，沒有特別好吃也不難吃～

本來是想定總統套房的 把年底工會的津貼給用掉 
不過老年人有自己的想法 還不如拆分幾天出來她們自己開開心心逛逛商場 

很多小地方都很親切 適合小朋友自己玩 

天氣適宜。感謝ship hotel的接待

缺點：1，泳池都是對外開放學游泳的，下餃子一樣，人多水質差，更衣室環境也很差，一股消毒水和 臭味結合的味道。2，中餐廳和自助餐廳收費不合規，不用pos機刷，而是要求客户轉入員工個人收款賬户，請問這些款項最終到公司了嗎？管理層知道嗎？公司股東知道嗎？這是嚴重的管理漏洞，或者説基層聯合起來的明知故犯。

msg:不值這個價格，現在疫情剛剛結束，游泳池沒開，彩虹賽道沒開，就6樓一個小童樂園開着，玩的東西和小區健身差不多，根本就沒有亮點，幾百塊在外面睡一晚吧，自助餐120一個人，看上去吃的東西很多，實際毫無東西可吃，主要8點半結束，服務員7點3刻就可以收東西準備下班。並且也不會加東西，服務態度還好。早飯也是在同一個地方，依舊沒什麼吃的，荷包蛋的阿姨到付把荷包蛋煎了又煎。住房條件也就3星，還好有個浴缸能滿足下孩子想游泳的心情，房間很多都破損，毛巾浴巾特別特別舊。前台服務員辦理入住也冷冷的態度，反正現在又不差生意對吧。外賣還要自己下樓拿。 要走很長的一段路。挺後悔去的，真心建議不要去，也不會二刷了

開車過去挺方便的，酒店停車免費
因為是疫情剛解封就去的，所以酒店很多項目設施還沒有完全開放，游泳池在重整，自助早餐種類也少的可憐……
好在附近有寶龍，走過去大概10分鐘左右，邊上還有個公園，就是酒店邊上的出入口暫時封了不能進去，要從公園正門進去，稍稍要走一點路
中規中矩的酒店，便宜的時候可以帶娃去去……

攜程應該注意下，作為商務休閑酒店，就還算可以的，畢竟房間設施算新算乾淨。親子酒店就算了吧，會令人失望透頂，還浪費寶貴的度假時光。實在沒啥可拍，就拍了一張房間窗外景色，其他的看看酒店官網圖片吧。

訂外賣咖啡，酒店大堂也有專門的取餐桌擺放不像有些酒店是要到大門外面拿的。泳池夜景挺好看的。
酒店的房卡可以直接刷鐵門到隔壁的生態園，很方便。

不滿意房間製冷過於冷，出風口對着床，開着冷，關了又熱，但是因為帶了小孩生怕一晚上凍感冒了，衹能關掉。
另外選擇酒店的很重要的原因是看中了他的游泳池，可是暑假來的體驗真的很差，從早到晚的外來私教培訓班，一泳池的人絕對對住店客人很不友好，第一天去被告知更衣箱沒有了，第二天去居然連毛巾都沒辦法提供，讓我們自己去房間拿。如果是住店客人多絕對可以理解，但是真的這種情況真的讓人很不愉快。呵呵……住酒店不就是因為社會泳池暑假人多，想要好一些的游泳體驗嘛！結果……糟心。

msg:好的地方我就不説了，提三點不足吧！一是房間的空調，住過其他高檔次的酒店就不説了，譬如錦江之星，維也納一類檔次的酒店，空調的四大功能也通常僅僅是除濕沒有，但是看到這裏的空調我震驚了，居然換氣功能都沒！僅有製冷和制熱，房間温度已經很低了，但是很悶，窗户又不能看，然而並沒有任何辦法，你衹能開製冷，而且還要把温度設定的比當前室温還要低，否則他完全不工作！就算風量調到一檔也大的要死，結果就是要麼悶死要麼凍死，想要個通風換氣功能這麼難嗎？相比酒店別的設施，這個中央空調太差了，一星酒店的水平！二是甲板有小童樂園，確實有人打掃衞生，但是設備完全無人維護，鞦韆連接地面的鉚釘已經完全脱落了，想想如果哪個小朋友盪鞦韆的時候，設備倒下來砸到，恐怕賠償起來遠比僱傭一個維修工每天去檢查下要貴得多吧？三是自助餐的酸奶機，不論早餐中餐晚餐一律維修中，貌似其他地方70元左右的自助餐，酸奶也可以無限量提供吧？這裏155的收費，連酸奶都提供不起，實在有些塌台！

3.第三要説下攜程，我是提前差不多一個月定的酒店，卻比現場定貴了好多，不知道什麼原因。我是攜程的忠實客户，如果是這樣的話，以後不用提前定。希望能得到回覆。

msg:特意給小朋友定的圓形浴缸的房型，結果入住給的完全不一樣，價格不變，沒有圓形浴缸之前根本就不需要多加錢定這個房間，給的解釋就是沒有房間了，房型價格亂開，非常失望。
