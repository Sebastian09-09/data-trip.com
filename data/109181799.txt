msg:Very suitable for recuperation, vacation, relaxation, and cure of insomnia.

The hotel is in a prime location in the center, only 50 meters away from the sea and only a small path away from the beach. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the church and the library. There are perfume shops, bluegrass, and castify mobile phone cases on the road. You can stroll around, and there is also a bar.

The hotel is very new, with marble decorations in the room, and no damp smell. The bed is very large and comfortable, and the sleep is very fragrant. The sea waves and breeze are a paradise for insomniacs! ! ! ! The cool and humid climate is suitable for recuperation and vacation.

Room 10 is very nice, facing the sea, and it also has a huge courtyard. You can light a bonfire at night, sit in the yard, grill beer and listen to the sound of the waves. There is also a small tea room on the side of the courtyard, which is very quiet. Lying on the table to play games is amazing, hahahaha! The bed is facing the floor-to-ceiling window. Lying on the bed, you can watch the sunrise over the sea. When it is clear at night, the sky is full of stars falling on the sea. The indoor bath is large enough for swimming, and the insulation effect is also very good. Taking a bath is like bathing in Huaqing Pool. I guess it's also amazing to come here in winter, with bonfires on the ice sea and hot spring baths.

The service is responsive at any time to meet your needs, and even the rental power bank can be delivered to the room. If you go to eat nearby, you can also ask the hotel to pick you up. The housekeeper is very handsome, hehe. Unlike other hotels, this hotel cleans the rooms twice a day, and the rooms are kept very clean, which doubles the comfort of living.

The water in the lobby swimming pool is very clear and well maintained, which is pleasing to the eye. Lying on a lounge chair during the day, looking at the blue sea and blue sky, and the moist breeze blowing, it is especially healing. It's lively and leisurely outside the hotel, and it's quiet and secluded when you return to the hotel.

The afternoon tea is also good, and the breakfast is actually the most delicious meal I have eaten in Aranya in the past few days. Damn~

The scenery was really nice. The yard was big and you could light a bonfire at night. It was perfect for three or five friends to come together, drink and chat. It was very comfortable just thinking about it. The location was also very close to the auditorium and the Lonely Library. I have stayed in many hotels, but there are not many hotels with such good service. The super gentle housekeeper Mengmeng provided super good service and solved any needs as soon as possible. Next time I go to Anaya, I will choose to stay here without hesitation!

msg:The ceiling of Aranya Hotel is completely the first echelon among local boutique luxury hotels.

From the hardware facilities of the hotel, you can see the taste and care of the owner. This is an absolutely obsessive-compulsive disorder-friendly hotel. From the coffee machine to the mini bar, to the hotel's toiletries, the color scheme is uniform and warm. When you enter the room, you will feel high-end and wrapped. The public area also surprisingly chose a lot of master furniture, and the housekeeper also introduced many collections of the owner. Every place is very good to shoot and film. The choice of supplies can also be seen with care, slippers and bathrobes are well received, and the toiletries are diptyque.

The soft service can also be called a perfect experience. From the beginning of the reservation, the housekeeper took the initiative to contact me to ask about many check-in needs. After entering the hotel, the housekeeper was very patient and professional to introduce the hotel and the park to me. The room rate during the stay includes afternoon tea and breakfast, and every point is just right.

The room was also surprisingly prepared with Ifidean's welcome products, which is really thoughtful!

If you want to come to Aranya to play but are afraid of crowds, I absolutely recommend eoso. It has high privacy and good service, and the butler-style service throughout the whole process has received five-star praise.

A WeChat group was set up the day before check-in to confirm the arrival time. The housekeeper was warm, beautiful and considerate. Seeing that we were with girlfriends, she specially prepared double gifts. The manager was very handsome and gentlemanly. He was afraid that we would queue for too long for the meal, so he helped us to get a number in advance and notified us when we were almost there. The driver was also very enthusiastic. The 24-hour shuttle bus was available at any time, and someone helped us with the luggage throughout the journey. The breakfast ended at 2 pm, which was very delicate and tasted good.
Yunsong is worthy of being the ceiling of Aranya accommodation. The location is also very good. The beach is right outside the door, and the library and auditorium are only a few hundred meters away. It's a pity that the trip was too short and I only stayed for one night. If I come to Aranya again, I will definitely choose Yunsong and look forward to staying there next time.

msg:What should a good hotel look like? I can't help asking myself.
Is it the accumulation of big brands, the exquisite ingredients or the perfect service? These things can be done by old chain stores, but they are definitely not the core competitiveness of Yunsong.
Yunsong is a "homestay" with rare humanistic care. Each staff member has a distinct personality, but there is also an inexplicable obsession, which is to find ways to make guests more satisfied. This kind of humanistic care requires a high standard, and it should be just enough without making guests feel abrupt. Yunsong has achieved this.
Driving me to buy wine, prepare red tulips, and make reservations at restaurants, these are almost zero from a cost perspective, but it is still very touching to actually do it.
This price is not high, and it can be higher. The hotel and the guests meet by chance, which can be a two-way rush.
Here I would like to emphasize the praise of Comrade Kiki. Comrade Kiki loves to laugh, but she has to hold back her professional ethics, which results in a case of failed expression management. Kiki is very meticulous, and holding back her laughter brings out simple tenderness.
I will often come to Yunsong to see my friends.

msg:This is the second time I stayed at Yunsong during the Spring Festival. The first time I stayed here, I felt that this should be the kind of "back garden" hotel where you can stay regularly and relax. I stayed for only one night last time and felt a little unsatisfied. This time, I took advantage of the holiday to stay for two nights and still chose Room 13 on the 2nd floor. I plan to try Room 12 next time. Let me talk about it in detail:
[Facilities] The hotel is designed by Shuhei Aoyama. The sense of space is very good, and the combination of various facilities is just right; the hotel's soft furnishings, accessories and supplies also reflect the owner's taste and tonality everywhere. The hotel is in an excellent location, facing the sea on the easternmost side of the villa area, and is very close to the Sea Breeze Bar, Aranya Auditorium, and Lonely Library. The window of the room on the second floor of the hotel is the sea view. It is very comfortable to sit on the bed and watch the sea. In the morning, you can watch the sunrise on the balcony of the room, or walk out of the front door of the hotel directly to the beach to watch the sunrise. The public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel on the first floor is also very comfortable.
[Environment] There are only 12 rooms in the hotel, and children and pets are not allowed. The purpose is to create a completely comfortable and relaxing environment for guests, which is very good! During the Spring Festival, you can avoid the noise of the crowd of people walking their kids, and have a quiet place to rest and relax. The rooms and public areas are also cleaned very cleanly.
[Service] The butler service is very considerate. Before checking in, the hotel will contact you in advance to ask about the arrival time and travel method, and the butler will come out to greet you. During the stay, if you are in the Anaya Park, the hotel will have a special electric car to pick you up. Just tell the butler on WeChat, which is very convenient. When you go out in winter, the butler will take the initiative to ask if you need a warm pad. When you go to the beach, the clerk will also take the initiative to ask if you need to take some bread crumbs to feed the seagulls.
During this stay, it happened to be my wife's birthday. I contacted the hotel in advance to ask if there was a place to order a cake during the Spring Festival in the park. The hotel took the initiative to say that they could help prepare a small cake. On the birthday, they also decorated the room. It was a very considerate service, and my wife was very surprised!
[Meals] The hotel has free breakfast and one afternoon tea, but no full meals. 1. Breakfast is in the form of a set meal, and the presentation and content are very exquisite. The general content includes: drinks (choose one from tea, coffee, or juice) + a small fruit platter + 4 small cold dishes + bread + a small main course + staple food (choose one from noodles or porridge). The content of the small dishes, main dishes, and staple food will change every day. The main dishes for two days of stay were fried fish and salmon + poached eggs, and the staple food was basically a choice between Yangchun noodles and porridge. One day was vegetable porridge and the other day was seafood porridge.
2. Afternoon tea is also very exquisite, including desserts + fruits + tea. The tea can be refilled with water. If you sit for a long time, the clerk will take the initiative to help change the tea leaves and brew a new pot. 3. The main meal can be solved in the Aranya Park. If you want to eat at a restaurant, you can ask the hotel to help make an appoin**ent in advance or queue up. If you go on holidays, it is recommended to ask the hotel to help make an appoin**ent for the restaurant you want to eat 1-2 days in advance, so that you can reserve a better position. Before going this time, I asked the hotel to help make an appoin**ent for Tangxin Sichuan cuisine and y sea. Tang Sichuan cuisine reserved a booth and y sea reserved a view seat, which is great. Oh yes, Yunsong and Tangshe have the same boss. Yunsong helped me make a reservation for Tang Xin Sichuan cuisine on the first floor of Tangshe in advance, and I could get a 10% discount (I only found out that the original location was on the first floor of Tangshe Hotel after I arrived at the restaurant, and I only found out that Yunsong guests could get a 10% discount when I checked out).
[Easter Egg] This stay happened to coincide with the Spring Festival. I wanted to watch a movie at the seaside cinema in Aranya. After consulting the hotel butler, the hotel butler said that the hotel could help me book tickets for free. I was happy. It should be noted that the hotel will give a handwritten ticket after booking a movie, and you need to exchange the ticket at the front desk of the cinema a few minutes in advance.
[Summary] Overall, I had a lot of new discoveries and new experiences when I stayed at Yunsong for the second time. I was very satisfied and felt that Yunsong was also optimizing its services. For example, when I checked out after the first stay, I suggested to the butler to add a trash can at the sink in the bathroom (there was only a trash can next to the toilet in the entire bathroom when I stayed for the first time, which was inconvenient to throw things when washing). When I checked in for the second time, I found that there was indeed a trash can at the sink; and when I checked in for the second time, I would pull a service group where both the butler and the front desk were, which made communication more convenient, etc. I hope Yunsong will continue to maintain its current positioning and service level and get better and better. See you next time!

But I paid extra to change the room because I liked the fireplace. I was told that the fireplace was not working when I checked in. It was a bit uncomfortable. The bed was very soft and my back hurt. If there was a hard mattress, I might consider coming again.

Five-star quality control, five-star taste, five-star service
Many designer hotels with strong styles are not satisfactory in details after check-in, but every corner of eoso can withstand scrutiny.
Evidens skincare gift box, exquisite check-in fruits and small desserts, complimentary sweet and savory afternoon tea, and on-call concierge car service, each of which justifies its quality.

Thumbs up for the butler serviceüëç
Next time I come to Aranya, I will definitely choose eoso

The hotel's environment is very comfortable, and Shuhei Aoyama's design highlights every detail. The most satisfying thing is probably the butler-style service provided by the hotel's young brothers and sisters. There is no detail that they could not think of. It is really considerate. Thank you for taking care of me these two days. If I come to Aranya again, I will definitely come to Yunsong again...

msg:The room was spacious and bright, and the housekeeper at the reception thoughtfully prepared fruit snacks and small gifts to upgrade the room. The service is very good and responsive to all requests. Thank you to the management staff for hosting us these past few days. It was a very pleasant trip, and the view from the room and hotel was amazing ~ I suggest you consider this hotel for your vacation if you have enough budget ~

But not many rooms
The hotel is small

Good service
Hardware facilities are unsatisfactory

Compared with this price, it seems not worth it. If the price is reduced by half, it will still be a very good choice.

msg:A very pleasant trip. The hotel is quiet, beautiful and exquisite, with a strong artistic a**osphere. There are art books in the lobby, artist Dali's limited edition sculptures, etc., and Wu Guanzhong's signature carpet in the room. All kinds of facilities are complete. It is a small and beautiful boutique hotel. The waiters are polite, considerate, considerate and careful. Special thanks to the official Mr. Mike, the driver who picked us up and sent us out, and Xiao Wang Meimei who is in charge of our catering. Thank you for making our trip more moving! Going to Aranya, Yunsong is a place not to be missed and recommended.

Very close to the sea, the afternoon tea on the first day was also very beautiful
