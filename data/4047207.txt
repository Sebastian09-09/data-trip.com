msg:The environment is quiet and far away from the city center. The hotel calls itself a scene, which is the natural style I like. The rice noodles for breakfast were delicious, but the coffee was not good. Maybe we made a late reservation for dinner because of the large number of guests. We had to wait for an hour. It is recommended to book a dinner time with the butler in advance. The Osprey Night Tour is highly recommended, both children and adults like it. You can also see the stars in the sky on the river. My only regret is that I only stayed in Guilin for one night this time, so I couldn't fully enjoy the artistic and natural a**osphere of the hotel. I will stay for a few more days next time.

Luoji's holiday package, the hotel has its own vegetable garden, you can make reservations for organic vegetable hot pot, and the last thing is the service. Special thanks to Butler Liu Wenyan, who received the hotel call on the train. We booked the Ink Villa and upgraded us to the Watermark Study Room. , from the time we checked in to the time we checked out, the service was in place and the response was timely.

There is only one car in the hotel, starting from 100.

The scenery is superb. The room was good, but the sheets were a bit old, discolored, and pilled, but they were slippery.

The sanitation of the main location is okay, but some glass doors in the room have not been opened for a long time. There are many health blind spots.

The hotel housekeeper is very enthusiastic. Good service. It is suitable for family travel. If the weather is good and not too hot, you can have fun.

But comparing the price, I still hope for more improvements.

The road signs are not easy to read and the house numbers are not clear enough. The street lights were not bright enough at night. On a rainy night, my girlfriend and I walked around five times before we found our building. It‚Äôs my fault that I misremembered the word ‚ÄúÊÄùÊÄù‚Äù as ‚ÄúÊó†Á†Å‚Äù, but building 70, really 70 is not visible without light. It is recommended to add some street lights. And make the house number bigger and brighter!

Can't find a house. I hope no one will ever experience the feeling of being a ghost again! !

I brought a swimsuit to experience the private swimming pool, but the child jumped into the water and suddenly swam to the edge of the pool in a panic and got up quickly, only to find that his foot was entangled by a lamp that had fallen off the wall of the pool. The numbing feeling of electric shock scared him so much that he jumped up desperately. Fortunately, there was no accident. It is recommended that hardware facilities, especially safety hazards, should be checked more thoroughly.

The entrance is very inconspicuous and I almost missed it, but it is really a different world when I enter. The villas full of design are hidden in the deep-rooted green plants, cicadas and birds chirping, the breeze is blowing, and the impetuous heart is immediately at peace~ The room decoration is quite stylish, the facilities are complete and convenient, and the Guilin rice noodles for breakfast in the hotel are super delicious, not inferior to the old brand at all! I can only enjoy it after eating two bowls. I personally strongly recommend the beer fish and cured meat rice for dinner. If you dine in the hotel, you must eat these two~ The hotel privately owns a section of the Lijiang River with extremely beautiful landscape. If you don‚Äôt immerse yourself in it and savor it carefully, it‚Äôs simply a waste of natural resources. However, what surprised me was that in addition to the perfect accommodation experience and the ultimate Lijiang scenery, the hotel also provides treasure halls, Beidao Bookstore, kayaking, paddle boards, osprey feeding, RV experience and other projects to make the hotel experience more abundant. It‚Äôs really a perfect holiday! !

First of all, the hotel can take a taxi to Elephant Trunk Mountain and Reed Flute Cave. It costs 50-80 in one afternoon and you can visit all the city attractions.
The hotel's osprey night fishing project is a must-experience, it is not available in other places, and this is one of the main reasons for staying at Watermark.
When arranging your itinerary, it is recommended to stay in Watermark in Guilin first, and then take a boat to Yangshuo. Watermark is very close to the pier. Taking a boat to Yangshuo is a great experience~
The service at Watermark is very good. Drinks and cups of noodles are provided free of charge. The Guilin rice noodles for breakfast are really delicious. Dinner is also very good. I left a very unforgettable memory at Watermark. The children all said they would like to buy it again.

Kayaking, paddleboarding, going to the rural market, exploring the farm, delicious food and wine, and a pet sheep interacted frequently and fun. However, even so, there was still a lot of time to be in a daze during the three days.

Friends who have not experienced the villa hotel can really come and try it! There are so many things to do here! My children had a lot of fun~ They can climb mountains to pray, ride bicycles, swing, pick fruits and vegetables; visit the mine treasure museum, which contains dinosaur fossils and ***** meteorites, which can be touched by hand; the most attractive thing for my children is various water sports~ kayaking on the Li River, feeding ospreys, and ospreys catching at night (follow the boatman to take the osprey to fish in the Li River in the evening, and come back to fry the fish and make soup, which is so sweet! I heard from the little brother at the dock that someone flew here for this purpose) You can also ask an international paddle board coach to teach paddle boarding. There are ospreys accompanying you all the way. The children quickly got the hang of it and can stand steadily on the paddle board and paddle by themselves. The children like it very much and have a sense of accomplishment! Children can stay in the park for a few days without going out, which saves them from the fatigue of traveling and crowded attractions. There are beautiful mountains and water here. Adults can drink tea at Yinzhen Pavilion and savor the ink painting of Guilin, feeling free and at ease! In short, it is very fun. My children always ask to come here to play once every year! We also visited the RV here, and we will stay in the RV next time we come.

msg:Stayed for one night from Watermark Promenade and rushed to Yangshuo to stay at Banyan Tree. If I had a choice, I would definitely reduce the number of nights at the Banyan Tree and save the time for the Watermark Promenade.

Upgrade to live in the North Island Book House.
Two days before arrival, the customer service lady added WeChat, various interactions, and answering questions.

It was too late that night. I went to have breakfast the next morning. The service was good, the food was unique, and the environment was good. I happened to be renovating my home, and I took pictures with my phone. The manager saw it and asked me if I wanted a tape measure.

The point is here. We originally went to Banyan Tree Villa immediately after eating. The customer service lady on WeChat showed up. While we were still having breakfast, we accompany the children to shoot and play football on the first floor... We went to the river to take pictures and punch cards. Follow the little sister to continue playing....What? One-to-one customer service? The lady invited us to cook bamboo rice and pizza together at noon... Temporarily change the time to go to Banyan Tree.

Then take the children to feed the osprey, which are really live fish, and let the children catch them and feed them to the osprey in the pond.

At noon, I saw bamboo and made bamboo rice and pizza... The parent-child activity is too real. I couldn't finish eating it and took it to Banyan Tree for dinner.

We were invited to climb the waterfall in the afternoon, but really couldn't put off going to the original theme Banyan Tree. According to other guests who participated in the activity together, it was more fun to have a bamboo raft night fishing with eagles on the night of the stay.

If the hardware of the watermark gallery is given 9 points, I will give 12 points for the software service.

The one-price all-inclusive parent-child package launched by the Watermark Gallery is too great value.

When I arrived at the lobby of Banyan Tree, I recalled the quietness of the watermark corridor and the one-to-one butler customer service...


This is the first time I have written so much without a red envelope when writing a review. Because it feels so good! Great service! It is very rare to serve so diligently now. I have seen many luxury hotels with first-class hardware and service standards, but the intention of the watermark corridor is missing.

Recommended.... especially with children

Quick check-in and accommodation upgrade made me feel good from day one. The hotel is quiet and clean. Photos come out well. The manager helped me with all my heart, so there was no disruption to my schedule. The concierge service is very good. It is difficult to find a van in Guilin, but I was able to travel comfortably with the hotel's 6-seater van. On the day I got home, the results of the sample test did not come out on the mobile phone, so I was embarrassed, but the manager quickly solved it. I was impressed until the very end. This is a good hotel for a quiet break with the family. However, it is recommended to prepare snacks for children or beer in advance as it is far from downtown and there are no convenience stores nearby. The food at the restaurant in the resort is also very clean and tasty. In particular, fried fish and brown sugar flower bread are unforgettable. I want to come again if I get a chance

The hotel is built by the water, the Li River is close at hand, the villa-type rooms, the garden-like environment, the warm and polite staff, and the considerate butler-style service. The hotel arranged a variety of items. On the night of the stay, I experienced osprey fishing on the Li River, and immediately tasted the freshly caught live fish, which was delicious. The BBQ dinner by the pool on Saturday night was also commendable, with a musical bonfire and gorgeous fireworks. The breakfast is exquisite, and I must eat a bowl of Guilin Braised Vegetable Noodles every meal. On the day of departure, the hotel presented pizza and children participated in the activity of making bamboo rice, and the trip was a success.

The name of the hotel is actually a homestay run by renting several villas in a dilapidated villa community in Lingchuan County. I booked a two-bed room with more than 3,000 yuan for two nights. The hardware in the room was extremely poor. The toothbrush box in the bathroom was moldy. There was no refrigerator in the room. The TV broke twice in two nights, and the hair dryer was also broken. Everything the hotel can arrange is extra and outrageous. The surrounding area is extremely desolate, and it is inconvenient to eat and shop. Meituan shopping will take at least 80 minutes to be delivered. At night, I wanted to watch TV, but after finally fixing it, I found that there were basically no channels to watch. Finally, I had to log in to my iQiyi account to appease the child.

msg:The environment of the hotel is very good, but we were out of luck. In the heavy rain for several days, the river water became turbulent and muddy, which greatly reduced the scenery. The first time I experienced a caravan, the hotel also gave us a large caravan for free, with a double bed, a high and low bed, and two bathrooms. The RV facilities are relatively complete, but the space is still too narrow, but the experience is good.
The service of the hotel is very good. The staff is basically polite and attentive, trying to meet the requirements of the guests as much as possible. Later, considering the rain safety issue, we changed our suites. Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, it is quite exquisite, especially the rice noodles are very good. It is the location of the hotel, which is inconvenient for lunch and dinner. The hotel restaurant has few dishes and the price is more expensive.

msg:The Watermark Corridor has a very good ecological environment. The butler, Miss Lu, has a warm and thoughtful service, and the food in the restaurant tastes good. There are many parent-child activities in the hotel, such as playing basketball, kayaking, and cycling. I also saw RVs and tents. You can choose to stay next time.
