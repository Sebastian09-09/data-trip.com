The service at the reception is friendly , English is spoken. The room is compact and might not have enough space if you have many pieces of luggage. It was fine for 1 piece of luggage and 1 medium size luggage. Bed is and pillows are very comfortable.

I experienced a high-grade fever with chills during the night, yet there was no household medication available at the hotel. They didn’t even try to help me find medication; I had to figure out how to get the pills on my own. It was a truly negative experience. I would not recommend this place for English speakers!

msg:Great location walking distance from Shanghai railway station. Got there a few hours early but hotel allowed us to leave luggage there whilst we went for lunch. Lovely hotel, staff, breakfast etc.. 

Only downside is that the pool is 6th floor in next building so you have to come down, go past reception and lobby and take lift to the 6th floor there. The small jacuzzi was not available when we wanted to use it as it was safer with our 3 year old so had to go into the main pool but we felt like we were getting in the way as others were using it to do their length swimming. Also, to get to the pool you have to climb up some stairs and at the bottom what looks like a rubber grip flooring was full of cold water but it was clear so when i stepped into it with cloth sandals that the hotel gave us in the room, they got soaking wet and the water was freezing cold. There should be a sign there to say there is a pool of water (see picture attached)

Other downside in the room is that the lighting system is very confusing - we had an executive suite and wanted to put our infant to sleep in the main room whilst we relaxed in the living room but if you wanted the lighting on in the living area you had to go to the bedroom to turn it on and the lights next to the front door were also confusing as there was no option to turn on the lights in the lounge area and if there was, it wasn’t stated hence why we say it was all very confusing.

Closest is Exit at SouthEastern side. Connectivity to Shanghai city by Shanghai Metro via Line 1, 3 and 4 at Shanghai Railway Station Stop. Exit Via Exit 5, turn right and walk literally less than 30m to the front lobby.

Cleanliness is spotty, I saw a strand of air on the hand towels. Otherwise pretty good.

Breakfast was a pretty standard spread for a 4 star western hotel.

I requested for the same floor or connecting room but was rejected bcos I had booked different room types. My son’s room in the 26 floor has hot water issues when bathing. The hot water was not consistent sometimes hot and cold. My room on the 10 floor overlooked the roof top of the next building and other apartment windows. Somehow I felt the hotel does not give priority or consideration to bookings from Trip. They were quick reject my requests without giving due consideration. Maybe something Trip can look into this. I may also not book with Trip or other apps as we were not treated the same as other clients. Thank u.

Reception rudely letting other people cut in front of me while I was first in line waiting, generally felt ignored.

On the day of departure I needed a taxi to the airport.  The concierge ensured he would call one and used his own means of communication. The taxi tried to rip me of with an obviously rigged meter. The receipt showed 20 km extra than what the distance should be. The driver came up with excuses such as that there was an extra fee because the hotel organized the ride. Left a bad taste leaving the city this way. In short can't trust the taxi called by the hotel. I send a message via this app to the hotel about this, message was read but not responded on.

People are rude, arrogant, pretentious and cold unless you are shanghainese.
Upon check-in, the receptionist clearly made a mistake on the input of the different information, which then asked me to sign off, which I clearly refused. Upon that, the receptionist continued as this is not relevant and not important... at the end, understood that the receptionist was just lazy and did not want to amend (bravo!)

Regarding clealiness, many stains on the carpet, shower which is not acceptable for a hotel of this standing. This Pullman hotel should be given 3 stars maximum, no more.

However, location is very convient closed to metro station and easily accessible to main touristic areas.

The bed was poorly made and the bathroom had marks everywhere. The pool bathrooms were filthy and they didn’t provide towels inside the bathroom to us. Finally, we booked a suite in order to have executive lounge access but this is a waste of money. The lounge in under equipped and if you are not Chinese, it appears you won’t be served.

msg:It’s not super luxury but if you’re looking for a good nights sleep it’s perfect. The beds were amazingly comfortable. It’s not a staycation hotel; gym and pool are fine (more 4 than 5 star) nothing special but they are better than many other hotels in Shanghai downtown area. For the price I’d say it’s a solid deal. You can get a room for under 100 euros and the rooms are comfy and clean. It was a good Shanghai stay: prefer of closer to the action in Jingnan though. I’d stay again for work.

The room size was good, and the beds were comfortable, but had railway station view.
Disappointed.
The front desk didn't want to upgrade me
They did not welcome me ,not made any friendly approach.
Later, when I asked for complimentary drinks, the girl at the front desk helped us.
The swimming pool was too small and too many kids , no steam.room not sauna 

In fact, you need to notify the property management in advance whether you want to use a steam room.


No beauty salon.

No sound proof, we heard the people next door early in the morning.

Overall, this hotel does not meet a 5- star hotel expectation.

Bathtub was dirty (or should I say “hairy”), curtains didn’t close completely and no curtains on the bathroom window so the place never got fully dark, bathtub drain leaked, so I could enjoy a great bath….for fifteen minutes.  Seems they are understaffed or overworked / everyone was in such a hurry. Instead of bringing my pizza/wine delivery to my room the staff texted for me to come down to the front desk.  I asked them for a wine glass but the staff did not believe me that the room didn’t already contain a wine glass. Had to argue to get someone to check my room and see that, really, there was no wine glass inside. I don’t mind drinking out of a coffee cup, but not when you pay for the best room! Bed was comfortable but woken up in the morning by a maintenance man who came to change a lightbulb…. Turns out he had the wrong room. Too bright inside to get back to sleep. Breakfast was okay—there was fresh juice and a couple of western options. Don’t think I’ll stay here again.

msg:we stayed there for 2 night to take a little break ( staycation )
I choose it because it s very near my place so no need travel that far 
Front desk girl was very nice and we got an upgrade on our room 
the 2 things that we usually like to do on staycation is enjoying the pool and the câble TV 
sadly none of these 2 were possible 

we went to the pool the same day we check in , and was very surprise to see that it was turn in to à kids pool party   were kids will play with water gun , splash , and make so more noise that we left it after few min 
not even mentioning that all these kids are not even kids for people staying at the hôtel,  but from outside 
so maybe you should give priority to the guest that are staying in and pay much more money than these kids 
also the jaccouzi was empty , so can t use it 
maybe you can update information on these booking plateform 

now the room , was descent enough   , but sadly very poor quality of equipment 
first mini bar never got cold even when set up thermostat to the coolest 
and the TV , small size ,all the sounds and images was extremely poor quality and also very limited choice of channel 

we went down for breakfast,  was cheap : 88rmb 
but quality are so so ( not even fresh juice but some juice made from concentrate that taste very sour...
also for food ,only very small choice of western food 
I know this is China , but as an international brand , don t should you provide more western experience ?
if wantlical food only,  then I will just book in a local hotel without any expectation 

so at the end ,I can t recommend this hotel for a staycation 

regarding cleaning , guess it s also local standards, please check the frame of the decoration on top of the bed and also inside this decoration,  it s full of dust that been laying there for years

The front office staff was friendly and the breakfast was ok, if you go early. The room lighting kind of dark same as the atmosphere in general. The value for money is good.

msg:Great location in Jingan very close to the Railway/metro station hub. Makes it very convenient for getting around very easily. The room was very nice and clean with a spacious bathroom. The gym was top notch. Very well sized with top of the line equipment and plenty of room to workout without being crowded. The pool was adequate, but the hot tub was out of service at the time of my visit. The staff was absolutely great. The front desk staff were very helpful and polite. The staff at the gym and pool were also very kind and cheerful and were able to answer all our questions. The cleaning staff were also very efficient and friendly and kept the room in excellent condition. We didn't get a chance to eat at the restaurant as we took advantage of the location to eat out, but the area looked very inviting. My only complaint is that when we did order room service it was somewhat lacking in quality and service. My wife actually had to go to the restaurant to pick it up. A trivial complaint to an otherwise excellent stay.

Checking in there was an issue finding my booking and then when I went to use the elevator the room key wouldn’t work, which meant I had to ride aimlessly up with other guests before being able to go back to reception to get another card. In the room, the aircon was not working so I had to call reception and they sent an engineer who couldn’t fix it so I was moved rooms. After that everything was ok. The room was comfortable and the view was nice.

They helped me switch rooms when I didn’t care for the room layout, they helped my friend order a TAOBAO purchase to be delivered to the hotel, and they are truly just nice. The only reason why I didn’t give the hotel five stars is due to their internet and cell phone service. Their WiFi is terrible and if you stay in a room kn the right side of the hall you will get 1 cell phone reception bar (I had them change my room to the left side after the first night). Hopefully they can fix their WiFi and then I would definitely give them 5 stars.

The lobby is spacious and bright, with exquisite decoration, creating an elegant atmosphere. The room is even more amazing, the bed is soft and comfortable, giving you a good night's sleep. The details of the room are also very well done, showing exquisiteness everywhere. The hotel's service is impeccable. The front desk staff are warm and friendly, always able to meet guests' needs in the first time, and their professional and efficient service is impressive. In addition, the hotel's geographical location is also very advantageous, with convenient transportation around, making it very convenient for business trips or vacations. In short, Pullman Shanghai left a deep impression on me with its excellent quality, excellent service and ideal location. It is definitely worth recommending!

There were no supplies in the room. You had to ask for toothbrushes at the front desk. There were slippers, but no cotton pads for girls. The towels were relatively new. The worst thing was the hair dryer. Five-star hotels can use better blowers instead of the current ones that pinch your hair at the back. The robot that delivers takeout or items to the room is very cute.

They are the bright business cards of the hotel and deserve high praise and recognition!

This bad review is for parking fees! I can pay to stay in a hotel, but I can't tolerate charging fees and the security has a bad attitude! If you drive to check in, please consider it carefully!

But occasionally I would have a better experience if I moved here. Facing the street, it was a bit noisy. There were earplugs in the drawer, but I didn't use them.
It's close to Shanghai Station and can be reached by walking. It's better than Intercontinental and Courtyard. Taking a taxi is just as easy as taking a taxi from the station takes a little longer.
The swimming pool is pretty good, equipped with a small sauna, open to the public

The service staff on the floor also greeted us very warmly, and the usual training was done well. The guest rooms were cleaned carefully and there was enough bottled water. The small Hansen natural spring water from the previous period was replaced with the Bichun drinking water that has been used all the time. 😁 The water quality and water temperature of the swimming pool have also improved.

msg:Bad, bad, bad... This is the first time I stayed in such a bad Pullman!
The lobby is not so grand, but acceptable, and the color is very dark.
I opened the room card, and when I got out of the elevator, I saw a small door, and I wondered why it was almost the same as the Four Seasons...
I was shocked when I opened the door of the room 🤯, such a small room, marked as 31 square meters, but it was estimated to be only about 20 square meters, and the height was unbearable... It was so depressing, looking at my photos, the room height was not much higher than my head, and the height was 2 meters?
The bathroom was also very small, just like the decoration of a fast hotel, and the toiletries looked very low. I was dissatisfied with all kinds of things. When I turned on the water, I was speechless. It was yellow after a long time. I had to give up taking a shower. It was already midnight, and I was so tired. I could only say that I was unlucky to book this hotel.
Strongly not recommended! Seven or eight hundred, more than a thousand... You can stay in a hotel that is ten times better, and this configuration is only worth three or four hundred...
I would rather choose a cost-effective hotel like Four Seasons.
The next day I met Amy at the front desk. Her service was very good 👍, which kept me from getting angry. By the way, parking is also very inconvenient. There are very few parking spaces, and they are not owned by the hotel. The hotel will only pay 20 yuan for parking, and you need to pay the rest yourself. If you stay overnight, it will be 50 yuan... a bit of a rip-off. There is always no parking space. Fortunately, the security guy is very good. He will let you throw the key to him, and he will move the car from time to time. It's hard for them.

It takes 30 minutes to take a taxi to Disneyland in the morning and evening, and more than ten minutes to other attractions in the city. Then the executive suite is super awesome! Spacious and has a good view! Free breakfast and dinner, and various drinks, fruits and desserts in the executive lounge! Finally, the service is really top-notch. Miss Jinqiu at the front desk is beautiful and thoughtful. She took the initiative to upgrade the room for an underage guest who was traveling with us, so that we could take care of him on the same floor, and also arranged breakfast so that he could eat with us!

In order to save energy with the child, we decisively chose the animal theme of the parent-child room. The child loved it. He started to build Lego in the morning and recognized giraffes and various animals. He was not bored even if he stayed at home, which softened the hard mode of two-to-one. The zoo theme that can be seen everywhere in the room is beautiful and bright, which is pleasing to the eye, and the child also had fun.

Hygiene: Daily cleaning is done with great care, simple or deep cleaning according to my needs. The aunt is very responsible and patient, thumbs up.

Environment: It is across the road from the train station, and the location is great. There are many convenience stores and restaurants around, and I rely on takeout to solve it. I have to say that ordering takeout in the hotel is so cool! It’s just that the hotel’s robot is not very useful, so I have to go down to get it myself. . .

Service: The front desk is really not good at checking in and out. It takes more than five minutes for each person to do it. I don’t know what they are doing. It’s a clumsy idea! Moreover, it was already past 11pm on the first day when I checked in. There was no one in front of me and the service was so slow. I couldn't find my reservation at first. After I checked in, they didn't give me a disposable toothbrush. I had to call room service to bring it to me in the middle of the night. I think the most lagging person of this hotel is the beautiful front desk ladies. Haha

msg:A very good value for money hotel. The hotel is a bit old, but the facilities are well maintained. The hotels in the old city don't seem to be too new. What impressed me most was the front desk service, which treated guests warmly. When it was not busy, they would take the initiative to take guests to the elevator. Any problems would be solved promptly. The room is not big, but the hygiene is pretty good. Toiletries need to be picked up at the front desk, and there is a robot that can deliver things. To deliver food, you need to call the front desk to verify your identity. They have a strong sense of security. All in all, it was a good stay!

msg:I joined Jing'an Pullman in early April and was very satisfied with my stay.
First of all, the hotel's interior is elegant and comfortable, in line with the elegance of Shanghai. The decoration and facilities are good, and the staff are polite and willing to help quickly. For example, my wife asked for some services, and the hotel reception was completed quickly and exceeded expectations. Special thanks to Miss Lucky for her assistance, which made us have a comfortable and pleasant hotel experience. The friendliness of the staff and going the extra mile can indeed make customers more confident.
The advantage of Shadian is its convenient transportation. Shanghai Station is just across the road, and it is very convenient to take the high-speed rail. However, the station is quite big, so you need to reserve time to find the platform.
We had lunch at Pullman’s Chinese Restaurant that day and enjoyed all the dishes. The food is delicious and there are discounts. If you are interested, please check out the menus. 👍👍

It has a standard large bed and the sofa bed was prepared in advance through communication with the lady at the front desk before check-in. It is comfortable and satisfactory. The big bed is equipped with memory pillows, extra points! The bathroom is very large, the toilet and shower are separated separately, the sink is very spacious, and there is a separate dressing table for putting on makeup. The overall hygiene and configuration are good.
The location of the hotel is very convenient, just near Shanghai Station. You can see the night view of Shanghai Station from the room. It's also very convenient if you're catching the high-speed rail. Even if you don't dare to take a taxi, you can walk directly to the hotel. The location is perfect. I highly recommend staying here if you are traveling~
The breakfast time is very long, from 6 o'clock to 10:30, and extended to 11 o'clock on weekends, which is very suitable for traveling at different times. There are not many varieties, but everything is available and the taste is quite good. Recommend~

msg:As a five-star hotel, I am very, very disappointed with this hotel. The reason I originally chose this hotel was that it was close to the subway station and had good reviews, but I didn't expect it to get such good reviews.
  After checking in and entering the room, the room was very hot and stuffy. I called the hotel customer service at first, but they didn't answer. I called the front desk several times, but the front desk blamed the manager again. I added the manager's WeChat account, and the solution was to bring an electric fan and a fruit plate. Since it is a five-star hotel, this is how it is handled. I was asked to turn on the fan at night and sent your manager a WeChat message for half an hour. In the end, he replied coldly, "Sir, we are a fresh air system." I am here. Live, what does this have to do with me? I'm not from your hotel. Do you need me to empathize with you? I couldn't stand it anymore, so I went downstairs to find the front desk.
  The only good thing about your hotel is that the front desk has a very positive attitude. After clearly informing us, he took us to change rooms and upgraded us to a cooler floor. His attitude was very good throughout the process. But when I asked about it that day, no customer said they had to change rooms because the room was very hot. But I was surprised. When I came back in the evening, I saw a foreign tourist at the front desk who also said that the heat needed to be solved by you. Your attitude was like playing football and kept saying that it was the engineering depar**ent's problem. Do I need to know that it was the engineering depar**ent's problem? What I need is you to give me a good solution attitude. So I can give your front desk a lot of credit.
  Finally, I don’t know who your manager is. Although I am very grateful for helping us find the items that were lost in the room, his reply was perfunctory. At the end, he called me "Mr. Zhang". I don't know what this means. I am "Mr. Li", and I don't even have the most basic respect. In the end, I am still asked to write a good review. After the good review, I can upgrade the room and send breakfast. To be honest, I don't need these. I think your attitude and your service This is what we need. If you can attract customers by getting good reviews, you are also deceiving yourself. I hope you can make good progress.

Environment: The environment is okay. You can see the Shanghai Railway Station from the window. After exiting the hotel, turn left and then right to the three subway lines, which is very convenient.
Service: The service is okay.
The breakfast is very good at 138/person and you can pay directly at the restaurant. No matter what time it is, no matter how many people there are or how few people there are, there are always enough ingredients and a wide range of varieties. There are only four types of milk, hot, cold, skim, and soy milk. Good. Details, the fruits include whole fruits and cut fruits, very fresh. There are also many types of bread and cereals.
The executive lounge on the 27th floor is also good. In the afternoon, there are three kinds of whole fruits and three kinds of cut fruits, as well as simple salads and small cakes. There are juices, Perrier water, soda water, and tonic water in the refrigerator. Next time, I will try a simple meal in the evening.
I booked an executive suite for three people. The waiter made the sofa bed and it was very comfortable to sleep on.
Generally speaking, it's okay. It's just for delivering food. If the robot can't deliver it, you need to go downstairs and pick it up yourself. It's in the cabinet on the left side of the door. When checking in, the bellman was very enthusiastic to help with the luggage. When leaving, the contrast was huge, and there was a lot of luggage, so I had to silently carry it to the car...

When I checked in, I was served by Joy Chang, who was very friendly and upgraded us to a CEO room.

As usual, I'll start with the location. For me, the location of the hotel is very convenient. First, it is close to the airport shuttle (number 5) stop (if you decide to take the bus from Shanghai Pudong Airport to the city).
Secondly, the hotel is close to Shanghai Railway Station (you can get there in about 5 minutes on foot!), so if you want to go to nearby cities, such as Hangzhou, Suzhou, etc., it is also very convenient.
Thirdly, the bus terminal is less than 5 minutes walk away (if you prefer to take the public bus and do like a local). If you prefer to take the subway, the entrance to the Shanghai Railway Station subway station (No. 5) is right next to the hotel. This station is an interchange station for Line 1, Line 3 and Line 4.

The hotel itself is very nice. The lobby is not too big but tastefully decorated. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable

There were only two cups, bathrobes, towels, and slippers. I packed my luggage in the middle of the night and was about to take a shower, but I realized that there were none. Although they were finally delivered, the operation was really poor. When I entered the bathroom, the sliding door wouldn't close. What the hell, so I had to use hotel slippers to stuff it under the door, otherwise it would slide open. The hotel had no air conditioning in early March, only heating. The room was extremely stuffy when it was turned on at 16 degrees. I turned off the heating and opened the windows for two hours and still felt stuffy. When I asked the front desk, they could only provide me with a fan. I was speechless. In the end, I was too tired and fell asleep. Because the temperature depended on the sky, I was woken up by the cold in the middle of the night. It was such a bad experience.
Advantages: The front desk staff are very polite. It is very close to Shanghai Railway Station, about 300 to 400 meters away. It is more than 100 meters away from the subway station Line 1. We came from Hangzhou and it was very convenient to go to the airport when we left.

msg:Service: Five-star comfort: The five-star hotel has a good location, a 5-minute walk from the train station, and convenient transportation. In terms of service, safety, and cleanliness, it is really suitable for people traveling! For business trips, office trips, and tourist accommodation, I I think it really impressed me from the perspective of cost-effectiveness! I think the service is really exquisite. The staff at the front desk enthusiastically told me that if I need anything, I can call the front desk at any time. There is also a food delivery robot downstairs to deliver takeaways and so on, which is super convenient! It's really great.

msg:When coming to Shanghai, choose a hotel near a high-speed rail station. The house price is not very expensive, but the price-performance ratio is extremely high! The breakfast is also very rich, and the swimming pool and gym on the 6th floor are also great! It only takes 10 minutes to get to Shanghai Station, and there are subway stations nearby, so it is very convenient to go shopping! Very recommendable. The key is that the price is not expensive, and the service at the front desk and concierge exceeded expectations. It feels very professional and attentive, and the various supporting facilities are very complete. Highly recommended!

When I checked in at the front desk, I happened to arrive at a time when there were a lot of guests, and there was a queue of two people. The guy at the front desk smiled and motioned for me to wait. I was very happy that they noticed me when checking others in, and apologized to me for keeping me waiting when they checked me in. This is what a five star should be. He knew I wanted to travel and recommended some places to me. Eat and play. The service at the front desk is really warm and professional. Being able to pay attention to me in line.

The hotel is very, very clean, and the staff at the front desk are also very enthusiastic, and they are all handsome men and beautiful women! Opposite the room is the train station, and the night view is great. This area should be regarded as a relatively prosperous area in Zhabei. Shanghai Station is just a few steps away. It is very convenient to take the subway to Nanjing Road for eating and shopping! The entire hotel is decorated in a post-modern style. The lobby is low-key and luxurious. The rooms are not big but have a washing area and a separate shower. There are sofas and writing desks on the first floor. There are not many people staying there now. The breakfast has a full range of hot food, including meats, vegetables, fruits, fried foods, desserts, breads, and sandwiches. It can be said to be very conscientious! ! There will also be someone to greet you when you check out, and the concierge service is really top-notch, no worse than some luxury brands. Although the hardware is defective, the service is better! Overall, I highly recommend this hotel, great value for money.

I have read many reviews saying that this front desk has good service. It is really well-deserved. A good service is really a very important part. The room is also very clean. The location of the hotel is very good. The subway station is very convenient and it is convenient to travel. I recommend everyone to experience it. I often stay in hotels, and I think the service and management of this hotel are the best. I will come again next time!

msg:This time I stayed in a room at the Jing'an Pullman Hotel, which is modern and simple. The service at the front desk is very good. From observation, every front desk person is very good. This is not an isolated phenomenon, which shows that the management is really excellent! The room is very clean. Traveling around, shopping, eating, and transportation are all very convenient. The hotel's breakfast is also unique in Shanghai style, with many varieties and good taste. The only drawback is that parking is not very convenient. After all, it is in the city center. During the stay, There are so many people. Fortunately, the hotel service has always been good. The Shanghai Railway Station is downstairs, and it is very close to Suzhou River and other places. The subway station is very convenient for the Bund and People's Square.

      Check-in was very convenient, and the full service was very good. I was upgraded to the executive floor for free and wanted to have dinner on the executive floor. Each cubicle was very quiet.
      The bathroom in the room is separated from wet and dry, the shower room is very spacious, the breakfast is very rich, there are many kinds of salads and cold cuts, the fruits are all fresh, the sunshine roses are full, the freshness is very good, freshly made scrambled eggs and fried rice You can see the chefs cooking on the spot, stir-fried vegetables, and the fried dough sticks, prune vegetable cakes, and shredded radish cakes are very distinctive.

msg:This is my first time to Pullman Shanghai Jing'an. This hotel gave me the biggest surprise during this tight business trip! Because I had to catch the early high-speed train the next day, the location of the hotel became the reason for my choice. However, I was constantly surprised on the way from the train station to the hotel. First, it’s really close. I arrived at the front desk within 5 minutes. Second, when I checked in, I met a fellow villager. Not only was the service professional and friendly, but he also thoughtfully upgraded the room type. Although the interior was a bit old, it didn’t stop me. Great experience, clean and spacious room with all the equipment functioning. When I returned to the room after work in the evening, I was pleasantly surprised to find that there were many TV channels, which made me feel even more satisfied!

The location is excellent, close to the subway, Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, large shopping malls, and most importantly, you can eat a lot of delicious food. If you prefer to take the subway, the subway station is right next to the hotel. Please contact us promptly if any leftover items are left in the room. Really good! It's also very convenient to catch a train, the train station is right opposite the hotel. After many days of long travel, you can have a good rest in this clean and spacious room. The front desk staff are sincere and friendly, and their smiles and greetings are warm and welcoming. Of course, the rooms are a bit dated, but that's what I wanted to experience the real old Shanghai feel - a deep sense of history. All equipment in the room operates normally. Especially like the wide range of TV channels. Enjoy your time here!

This time I had the opportunity to stay at Pullman Shanghai Jing'an, which is considered a mid-to-high-end brand within the Accor brand. I feel that the inspired design and service level have always maintained the excellent level that we should have. The lobby has the warm colors that we like, with flowers and decorations. The buildings and culture with Shanghai characteristics are all in the corridor. It is really classical, elegant and A combination of modern fashion. The room is small but has everything you need. The service staff at the hotel front desk are patient, professional and warm. When we arrived at the hotel after 12 o'clock, they tried their best to help coordinate the room check-in. When I went to the guest room, the air and temperature were adapted to it. The lack of a bathtub in the room may be due to the geographical location and the size of the room. But I will come again because of this service.

She is very patient and makes people feel very comfortable. There are also some drinks in the small refrigerator in the room. Although there is a fee, the fee is still very reasonable. The hotel does not have its own parking lot, but the front desk will give a 20 yuan discount coupon to guests staying in the hotel. I personally think that charging 30 yuan for a night in Shanghai is very cost-effective. I will definitely stay again if I have the opportunity.

Second, the room stated that there is a hairdressing bed. When placing the order, I made a note to prepare the bed with quilts and pillows. The other party replied that it was impossible to meet the requirements. I had to confirm with Ctrip again to get a positive reply, but in the end, no pillow was given. , only a thin quilt was given.
Thirdly, the location of the hotel is very good, the subway station is just downstairs, but apart from this, there are no other benefits.
Fourth, the room has signs of use to a certain extent. The bathtub is leaking and the curtains are dirty. One of the two wash basins has a strong flow of water. When the water is boiled, the whole body is covered with water.
Fifth, there is always a cleaning lady knocking on the door/ringing the doorbell every morning and asking loudly if there are any clothes to be washed? I have never stayed in a hotel that operates like this, even if the do not disturb message is turned on. It's absolutely amazing.

All in all, apart from the convenient location, nothing else.

It is quite a wonderful feeling to watch the people flowing in and out. The nearby hotel office buildings are reflected in the photos. After checking out, some people came to ask about their stay. After staying in so many hotels, I really feel that the front desk of this hotel is really attentive. It’s not just a few people, but basically everyone is very proactive. It’s really rare. . There is that kind of heart-to-heart communication, and the feelings for the hotel may start from here.

msg:As a former hotelier who has worked in hotels for more than 10 years, I think it is more appropriate to evaluate a certain hotel. I stayed here last time and my experience was not very obvious. I didn't appreciate it after being in a hurry all night. First of all, its location is very advantageous, right next to the Shanghai Railway Station. I took a quick look and found that it was probably the nearest international chain hotel to Shanghai Station. There was also an Intercontinental hotel that looked very close (but I was advised not to leave after looking at Ctrip’s ratings). Although it is very close to the train station, Shanghai Station is divided into South Square and North Square. If you accidentally take the wrong exit, you will be faced with the embarrassing situation of having to take a taxi and being complained by the Shanghai driver. The entrance of the hotel is behind a slightly complicated small shopping mall, which is a bit inconspicuous, but I found that the subway station is right next to the main entrance of the hotel, which is very convenient. For transportation in Shanghai, the subway is a good choice. The security guard at the door was dull and unhelpful (it was later explained that they were outsourced parking lot personnel, but at the door of the hotel it is easy for people to misunderstand that they were hotel staff). When entering, the concierge at the door politely asked whether to check in and took the luggage. Go to the front desk. The highlight is that the front desk staff greets guests more actively, and there are even situations where two staff members invite guests to check in at the same time. It can be seen that the staff's enthusiasm is very high. The check-in process was very smooth, and my preferences were mentioned and asked. Because I was quite tired from work, I was still worried that there would not be a ready room when I arrived early. But the front desk still gave me a room after receiving my request, and also told me to take a rest. Very heartwarming. After entering the room, the room is not big, but I understand that in a place like Shanghai Station where land is at a premium, the facilities in the room are furnished according to standards, and the mineral water provided in the PS room looks quite high-end. But there is still obvious dust in the room. Because I was tired after all, I didn’t reflect on this situation too much. There is still a problem of poor sound insulation in the sleeping room at night. You can obviously hear the noise from the corridor and the next room, but the bed is very comfortable and I have a good rest. The service center is an AI robot, which is convenient and fast but also a bit stiff. The breakfast room is not particularly large, but you can clearly feel that the dishes are all available. It has everything you would expect from an international five-star hotel, and the taste is pretty good. The only drawback is that the service staff in the restaurant are a bit casual, and the empty and dirty plates on the table are not collected in a timely manner. To sum up, I would have given the hotel a 3.5-4 rating on the platform, but I received a phone call from the hotel on the night I left. It should have been GRO or something like that. I didn’t want to say more. After all, the hotel’s advantages outweigh its disadvantages. But despite my hesitation, I still hope that I can leave some comments. I truthfully told my experience about my stay, and the staff listened to my opinions sincerely and said they would give feedback to the leadership. I also invite you to come next time, there will definitely be improvements. I thought it was over. Unexpectedly, I received another call from the front office manager, who apologized and offered to upgrade to breakfast next time. It makes me feel embarrassed. To be honest, my 5 points are because subsequent hotels attach so much importance to guest feedback. I have also been a hotel operator and I know how difficult it is for hoteliers and how hard it is to maintain reviews. In summary, the hotel's hardware is not particularly outstanding, and the overall taste is acceptable. In terms of software, the management of the front office is very good. The employees have high basic quality and proactively serve guests, including follow-up. However, if a hotel wants to achieve complete customer satisfaction, it only relies on the efforts of a small group of people. Effort is clearly not enough. I hope to have a better experience next time I stay, and I look forward to coming again. A little wordy, but totally from the heart.

msg:The overall stay was very satisfying. The manager on duty, LUCKY, welcomed me when I checked in. The service was very good from the first moment I walked in. LUCKY also actively contacted us after checking out to ask about his experience. He kept the beginning and end, and hoped that your work would go well.
Let’s talk about a few small details about the service.
1. Wake up early. I don’t know how many people still have this habit, but I still rely on the hotel’s early morning service if I need to get up at a certain time when staying in a hotel. As a long-established hotel, Pullman has a clear time and whether to call early after calling the service center. The experience is obvious here.
2. Breakfast. There are not many types of breakfast, but it is enough for dining needs, but it does not pursue too much category, and the wooden room card is practical.
3. Breakfast staff. Some people who would like to make an additional comment may be the service staff in the breakfast room. The service staff who ushered in the seats only brought people in, which was actually only 2/3 steps. If there was no other service or guidance work, according to the current principle of sitting wherever there is space, there was no need to accompany me to walk these two steps and tell me where to go. Even if I can sit down, especially on the second day, I will use the same words and get the same results, even if I don’t understand them a little, I will also deliberately answer the sentence of thank you. There is also a wave of staff who are service staff in the breakfast area. Maybe it’s a position I’ve seen recently that I don’t know much about or no one has arranged the job well. Taking the service staff next to the milk area as an example, I don't quite understand what the job responsibilities of these people are. All I can see is collecting plates, and at the same time standing, using toothpicks when the milk jug is clogged. Because I am not the one pumping milk, let’s not talk about my ability to handle the work. When I watched the whole process, what I didn’t understand may be the expression. Compared with some people in the same position or in the same hotel, their expressions sounded wooden. Most guests who stay in a hotel come into contact most with the supplies in the room and the service staff in the dining area. As users, we think the wooden furniture in the room is very good, and the older ones are better, but the service in the dining area The metaphor of people being like wood is always a bad one. It’s not a complaint, I just hope it can be improved~
The facilities are pretty good and it doesn't feel very old.
The gym has a wide variety of equipment, but there may be fewer people going there. The air-conditioning heater is not turned on very much, so it is a bit colder than the lobby. Although the goal is fitness, there is still a slight difference in room temperature as soon as you get to this floor. of.
I thought of a very small problem. Next to the sink is usually a small bottle of moisturizer. This time, after two days of cleaning, all that appeared was a conditioner. I hope this kind of small problem can be taken seriously. I am one of them. People who just pick it up and use it are easily influenced to take another shower.

msg:After reading a lot of online reviews, I chose Jing'an Polman. I found that most of the reviews are quite fair. The hotel is not on the side of the main road. Many hotels in Shanghai are like this. The hotel is a business hotel. It can be seen that many people on business trips stay there, including many foreign guests. The service at the front desk is really good, and the attitude is very good in all aspects. Every front desk employee I encounter is very proactive and manages well. Don't expect too much from the room. The rooms in this area are not too big and there is no bathtub. The room is adequate and the service is very good. I will choose to stay here again next time I have the opportunity.

It only takes less than a minute to walk to the subway station, and it only takes 5 minutes to walk to the train station. It is very convenient for business trips and other things, but Hongqiao Railway Station is relatively far away and is in a hotel in the city. The rooms don't feel too big, and most of them don't have bathtubs. The hall is decorated with great quality. In terms of service, the front desk service is great. Whether it is check-in or check-out, it is efficient and friendly. The front desk staff are all very positive and friendly. The service elsewhere is unremarkable. In short, it is a relatively cost-effective hotel.

The executive lounge here is very good, with a certain degree of privacy and a lot of variety. As expected of a French hotel brand, it has homemade butter, which goes well with baguettes, and the buns are also delicious. Especially the breakfast on the second day, the scallion oil noodles were very authentic and had Shanghai characteristics.

The room is not too big and does not have a bathtub, but it is comfortable enough. Overall, the price/performance ratio is quite high.

msg:First of all, I wanted to choose a hotel closer to the train station when I was on a business trip, so I chose Pullman Jing'an. The service of the front desk staff was very, very good. Needless to say, check-in was very quick. The surprise will be told later. First of all, for sisters who are on a business trip, it feels safe to enter the elevator and swipe the room card. The room layout is reasonable, clean and tidy, the TV is very clear, and it can also cast the screen, which is really great. The wifi speed is not too fast, but it is sufficient. In the cold winter, the hot water is very comfortable and the water pressure is very strong. The bedding is super comfortable. One thing that's not good is that for me who travels on business all year round, it doesn't feel so friendly if it takes a day to get the laundry back. But everything else is really great, the breakfast is rich and there are all kinds of fruit drinks. It's worth mentioning that I asked the front desk for a bite. I felt a little uncomfortable and wanted to eat two pieces of fruit. I thought I would have to wait for a long time to order takeout. I didn't have any hope, but a male manager in the lobby brought me a large plate of fruit and some pears, saying that it would be good to eat more pears when I have a cold. He also prepared a cup of hot milk for me to drink before going to bed. I was almost moved to tears. I felt that someone cared about the working dog while he was away on a business trip. My family members are not so considerate, so I complained to them as soon as I got home. You are not as good as a stranger in the hotel. What a handsome and kind person! I will choose this hotel every time I come to Shanghai in the future.

It was also thanks to my son that I stayed in an executive suite for the first time. The moment I opened the room, I was a little surprised. I was very satisfied with everything.
Because my sleep quality is not very good and I have high requirements for sound and light, the isolation effect of the room is quite good.

In fact, this is not the first time I have stayed at Pullman. I always choose this hotel every time I come here. I think the price/performance ratio is pretty good among five-star hotels.

The young man at the front desk, Xiao Yang, was great. There seemed to be construction noises outside at night. I sent him a message in the middle of the night and he went to deal with it immediately. Thank you very much.

The second thing is that the bedside light switch on the right side of the bed is really scary when I turn on the oily one. Apart from these two things, the hygiene is generally OK and the bed has no peculiar smell.

Although there are many guests, the front desk is very efficient and invincible. The swimming pool upstairs in the hotel is great. If you come early, there will be fewer people. The room equipment is a little old, maybe because it has been there for many years. But the maintenance is pretty good, and the service is really good. I will choose to stay here again in the future.

Because my schedule was full every day and I wanted to take my kids to eat with special features, I booked a basic room type without breakfast. After checking in, Lucy at the front desk saw that I was raising my child alone. Not only did she upgrade me to a deluxe king room, but she also provided me with daily breakfast and asked me to add WeChat to contact me if I have any questions. First of all, the breakfast quality was very good, the noodle soup and Japanese steamed eggs were delicious. We didn't go out to eat specialties in the next few days. Secondly, during the stay, Lucy had to print learning materials for the children every day, and Lucy responded very quickly. After playing every day, she would pick up homework at the front desk. Third, I accidentally injured my leg outside on the last night. When I returned to the hotel, I called the room and asked for some iodophor.

I think the room is not big, but the price is quite normal in Jing'an. The decoration is simple and elegant. The only thing is that the room is not bright enough. There is no noise. The bed is okay.
There is a restaurant downstairs where you can eat and there is also an executive lounge.
This is a hotel I will consider next time I come to Jing'an

msg:Checked in on 24/04/22-4/25. Thanks to MR. Moses Suen for his kind and active service. Everything about the stay was very good. The following only describes the areas that I hope can be improved. When I stayed in the executive suite, the water pressure in the shower head was not strong enough, which caused me to take a shower. It takes a lot of time. The exclusive network for the TV in the executive suite is very weak. As a result, it cannot be used until night during the entire stay. The toilet is made of quite transparent glass, so it is a bit embarrassing. Except for the above three points. Everything else is fine. ￼

Although the hotel is a bit old, the experience is much better than the InterContinental and Indigo I stayed at before. At least the staff are very welcoming. Keely at the front desk has attentive service. He adds WeChat as soon as possible and can respond promptly if he has any questions he doesn’t understand. The breakfast is also very rich. It is quite comfortable to bring children. The executive lounge can meet the basic needs. I will consider staying here next time.

The room is not particularly large, but the oversized floor-to-ceiling windows in the room can easily see the bustling city view. The price/performance ratio is first-rate. It is worth recommending. The hotel software and services are even better! The connection with the little brother at the front desk was very smooth, he had a great smile, he was very professional, and he was very patient in dealing with others. He took the trouble to go through the check-in process and was extremely attentive and thoughtful. Feeling the sincerity, meticulousness and enthusiasm of Jing'an Pullman's service, it was easy to fall asleep on the bed. Service: The service attitude at the front desk is great, and the manager on duty is always online to help us coordinate the process. It feels very comfortable. Jing'an Borman is really attentive.

Although the room has seen better days, it has been well maintained. The key point is that everyone at the front desk is very service-minded. When you walk to the front desk, you will hear everyone saying hello. Really good!

msg:My first stay at Pullman was so disappointing that I would never want to stay there again.
First of all, as a five-star hotel, there is a charge for the parking lot. The hotel front desk told me that the parking lot does not belong to them, but the security guard is from the hotel.
Second, when I checked in, a middle-aged hotel staff helped us carry our luggage, but when I checked out, my friend took two large boxes and went to the parking lot first. The doorman at the hotel door looked at my friend. One person struggled to pull two large suitcases and didn't know how to open the door. Just watch with cold eyes.
Third, the hotel room is really small, not even 30 square meters in size, and the suitcase can't even fit in it.
Fourth, the air conditioner in the hotel is too hot. The person in the guest room said that the air conditioner has the same control and cannot adjust the temperature. A heater is needed in the dark room.
Fifth, the takeout order was too big and I had to go down to get it myself. The downstairs was very messy at night and the lobby was very unsafe.
In short, the experience of this hotel is really bad. It is not at all the standard that a five-star hotel should have. The room is small and pitiful.

But the most annoying thing was when I checked in, I didn’t know if the front desk had a brain problem or something was wrong. They emphasized over and over again that they upgraded my room. It was obviously me who had added money to the xc to upgrade myself. I’m telling you what is the relationship? Later, I tried to explain that I had added money myself, but the front desk interrupted me and said that their hotel had upgraded me. I spent money to stay in a hotel, not to ask you to be my uncle.

msg:When traveling in Shanghai, I chose this hotel after being recommended by a friend. The location is really convenient. It takes only five minutes to walk out of Shanghai Station. The surrounding traffic is also very convenient. There is a subway station just outside the door, and it is very convenient to go to Xintiandi on the Bund. There is a concierge to help with the luggage when you enter the door. Because I arrived at the store early and there is no clean room, the little brother at the front desk helped to upgrade the room and store the luggage. When checking out, Amy, the beautiful lady at the front desk, prepared a small gift for our children, which was very considerate. Various problems during the stay were resolved in a timely manner, and I am really satisfied with the service. The room is generally good, but the facilities are really outdated, the toilet seat has no cushion, which is a bit scary, and the shower in the room's shower doesn't work, either facing the wall or facing the shower door, which is a bit embarrassing. The breakfast on the first floor is quite rich, especially the Shanghai scallion noodles, which my family is full of praise. I don't know if it's because of the summer vacation, but the hotel's business is really good. Every time I pass by the front desk, I always line up. Generally speaking, I am very satisfied with my stay. I will continue to choose it when I come to Shanghai. Very recommended! !

Food: Quite average, not many categories, the taste is okay, and the beer is added diligently. The beer was canned Heineken at first, and then Qingdao. The amount of salmon sashimi is not much and the quality is average, but it can be added continuously to the end. The only juices available were orange juice and apple juice which was terrible.
The hotel rooms are generally large, the view from the upper floors is okay, and the toiletries are all in large bottles. Drinking water and room key are slightly unique. The air conditioning is adequate.
The front desk has a very good attitude and thoughtful service, which is the most satisfying thing about this hotel. The reception staff at the pool and gym were also very nice.
The swimming pool is about 25cm tall and well maintained. Children's floats are prepared.
The overall environment of the hotel is relatively dark, which is quite uncomfortable. The worst dinner experience. I contacted me many times beforehand, including a return visit to confirm my reservation with the hotel. The hotel called me one day in advance to confirm the number of people and seats. In the end, no relevant reservation information was found on site. , I had to fight for two round tables, which was very disappointing.

After checking in, the front desk was very considerate and helped to send the luggage to the room first, which is great. The female goose especially likes it!

The handsome men and beauties at the main station are warm and thoughtful, and they are also very patient in consulting information. They also gave children slippers, which is very good. The room is comfortable, clean and hygienic. The cleaning lady is also very considerate. Seeing us taking care of the children, she brought extra water. The breakfast in the hotel is good, with rich varieties and good taste. Thanks to Manager Sun in the front office, who gave the children favorite biscuits and fruits, and helped arrange the continuation of the stay.

msg:I rarely write reviews. I generally give good reviews by default when I stay at a hotel. However, I must give a good review of what the Pullman Hotel has done, so as not to let my friends down the road! Let’s talk about reservations first. I went to Shanghai on a business trip and thought I would get off at Shanghai Railway Station, so I booked a high-rated hotel near the train station. However, I found that my alighting station was Shanghai Hongqiao Station, and I also wanted to go to Shanghai Hongqiao the next day. Departure, I found out about half an hour after I placed the order, and immediately contacted Ctrip to discuss whether I could unsubscribe! It turns out that the hotel is very tough and cannot refund the reservation. It also said that it is very convenient to take the subway from Hongqiao. Please, let's see if it is convenient! I had no choice but to check in. As a result, I can’t comment on the decoration and environment of the hotel room. It’s hard to say enough, and the soundproofing of the room was very poor! As for why the hotel has a high rating, it’s because WeChat was added to the front desk when you checked in. Please give it a good review! Whether this counts as a positive review or not will be determined by the Ctrip platform! Anyway, I won’t stay there again!

This time I took my children out to play. I booked two twin rooms. The rooms were large in size and my friends enjoyed their stay very much. When we left, we left our children's pillows at the hotel (very old and hard to find) and called the front desk to help find them. The first reply was that they couldn't find them. I said they must be in the hotel because they were there when we left. Forgot to pack and take away. Then Manager Jin from the front office took the initiative to contact me and communicated the location of the small pillow. After more than half an hour of searching, I finally found it. I would like to express my special thanks to Manager Jin for solving this big problem for us!

2. The hotel facilities are still very good, and the price is also cheap. The room is much larger than expected, and the price/performance ratio is extremely high in Shanghai
3. The attitude of the service staff is very good. When we left, I forgot that the fruit was in the refrigerator. My aunt chased it all the way to the elevator and delivered it to us. She forgot to take the ring, and she notified us as soon as possible. I am very grateful and considerate

Environment: The location of the hotel is very good. It takes only 2 minutes to get out of the subway exit. It is very convenient to go to various business districts and alleys. It is basically controllable for a one-way trip of 30 minutes

Hygiene: The overall is good, but the details really do not meet the standards of a five-star hotel. Breakfast is in the restaurant, and the dishes picked up are not cleaned; the room needs a water glass, and the water glass delivered by the robot 🤖️ is also stained

Service: The service experience in every part of the hotel is good. The ladies in the room are friendly and enthusiastic. The concierge depar**ent is also good at answering questions. The front desk feels understaffed. Check-in and other procedures take a little longer, but the staff have tried their best

Facilities: The suite I stayed in this time has a spacious layout and a reasonable layout. It is quiet outside at night, so I can sleep well. The breakfast is okay. The noodles and wontons are good, but the quality of the fruit is really not good. The honeydew melon I ate on the first day actually tasted sour.

The front desk told me to wait for the cleaning. I waited for an hour and a half without eating or drinking. There was no feedback or statement during the period. Finally, I asked for it. I got a room card upstairs by myself. The things were on the table as they were, and the room was not cleaned. No one came to check the items left by the guests. I didn’t go to the room to take a look until I returned the room card. Knowing that something was taken from me. Extremely disappointed and angry.

msg:The worst staying experience in history was actually at Shanghai Jingan Pullman Hotel. When I brought my children to the Shanghai Natural History Museum during summer vacation, I chose PULLMAN nearby. During breakfast time, the welcoming staff arranged for us 4 adults + 1 child (three-year-old baby) to a four-seat table. When we brought our breakfast and asked for another chair, the welcoming staff said that all the seats were occupied. I made up for the baby, do I need to pick it up and eat? Then I asked her if she has a baby chair? She didn't answer yes or no, but kept answering that there were only four chairs for four people. I asked her if the baby needs to stand up and eat? At this time, a male waiter also joined the front line of welcoming sisters. He insisted that four seats are four chairs. It's really deceiving, this kind of breakfast can't be digested. Will never order Pollmann again

Because I came back late, I didn't contact the hotel to deal with it. What's even more surprising is that there are some long hairs on the non-slip mat in the bathroom (I am a male and my male colleagues who stay with me do not have the habit of growing long hair). I originally stayed in Shanghai for two days, but after seeing this situation, I really had no intention of extending my stay.
From check-in to check-out, every waiter I met was like a robot, expressionless and unfriendly!

The chair back of the writing desk configuration is broken and very uncomfortable. The geographical location is both an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage is that it is very close to Shanghai Railway Station. The disadvantage is that you can feel the operation of the railway station at any time. The sound insulation of the room is not very good, you can hear conversations in other rooms, and the sound from the bathroom next door feels like it has passed through. The cleaning is obviously not thorough. I don't know if the paper on the door mirror has been used by the previous batches of customers.

There are many restaurants within 3/5 kilometers, and the hotel breakfast is also very good. Ethan, who left the water glass in the concierge of the hotel, quickly found it for me and arranged to send it. Thank you very much!

msg:Except that the lobby is a bit like a five-star hotel, the guest room environment and facilities feel not as good as a three-star hotel. It is completely different from the description in the photos. It is too old and simple. The area is not 31 square meters. The bed is so small that I will wake up if I turn over in the middle of the night. I haven't spent a whole night. Sleep well. Except for the front desk staff who are very good and skilled in their work, other staff feel that they have been put on duty without training. When I arrived at the hotel in the middle of the night, several security guards were standing, but no one came to help with the luggage. The breakfast waiter had his hands in his trouser pockets. They stand in various postures and are not polite when talking to guests. I really don’t know how the five-star rating was achieved. The price/performance ratio is too low.

msg:For a weekend get-together with my best friends, the three of us wanted to live together but didn't want to sift through the many B&Bs. We just wanted to find an apar**ent hotel. After looking through all the options, we couldn't find anything suitable, so we chose this suite. The transportation location is very convenient. The sofa in the living room is equivalent to an ordinary double bed when opened, but the living room space becomes more cramped after the sofa is opened, but it is not important. Then the bathroom is very big, but in addition to the bedding on the bed, you have to ask the front desk for anything extra, and there is no extra in the room. The room comes with breakfast, but because I got up late, I didn't pay attention to the experience. Overall, it was good.

The lobby manager was also easy to communicate with and quickly solved my needs.

I will recommend it to other customers or bosses next time if they want to live near Shanghai Railway Station. More convenient than nearby intercontinental.

This time, there was a musty smell when I entered the 20th floor. I checked in at night and didn't choose to change rooms. How come this 2016 hotel is facing the road and smells musty?
Mold easily breeds mites. I told the front desk after checking out that they would change my room next time. The smell of a room costing 770 yuan is worse than that of a chain hotel.
I gave it 4 points for the toothbrush and toothpaste. I like it very much, but I can’t resist the musty smell.

You have to ask the aunt to come in and get the key to dig the panel to cool down. The noise is very loud, and there is no kettle, so forget it
The management is very chaotic, and the check in is very slow. After queuing for a long time, the person on the other side cuts in front of me.
Obviously there are robots that insist on putting the takeaway in the takeaway cabinet, so is your robot just a decoration?

Both the environment and the service are quite satisfactory. Once you arrive at the hotel, you will feel clean and comfortable. The service at the front desk is also very good, and Manager Sun is very enthusiastic. He will be very considerate to understand my needs and introduce the hotel's room types. Post a picture for you to see~ It’s great!

msg:Worst hotel I have ever stayed in. When I drove in, I started to get upset even before I entered the lobby. The parking attendant had a bad attitude. I was also told that parking fees are charged for staying in a hotel, which is simply unheard of. Room facilities are very old. There was basically no choice for breakfast. Except for some noodles, everything else looked stale. I ordered egg rolls, and the girl who made them started making them immediately after picking out her ears without putting on her gloves. In the end, I went out twice and paid parking fees twice. I was speechless.

msg:It is rare to comment negatively on the hotel, and this time I am really not satisfied.
Pullman had a good experience in other cities before. This time, I booked a hotel near Jing'an for the convenience of traveling with children. On the day of check-in, a lady at the front desk arranged the smallest room on the farthest side. Not to mention the small room, the light is very dark, the window is a small bed, and it is not like the reserved room at all. Went downstairs to negotiate and a man helped to upgrade the room, but I think it was like this. The sheets and quilts we stayed in were not very clean, there were black unknown objects! Children are prone to allergies. Are the sheets really disinfected and replaced as required? Isn't this the most basic requirement of a hotel! There are no other facilities, the public area is very small, the only advantage is that the subway station is just downstairs! I won't stay again next time, I hope it's just a hotel problem rather than a brand problem.

First of all, Xiao Zhu, the girl at the front desk who checks in, has a good understanding attitude and communicated with her before. Even if the check-out is delayed, the booked package could have been delayed until 4:00 p.m., and the happy hour in the evening of the executive room will also be delayed accordingly. I like this humanized management. Overlapping, although the executive lounge on the 27th floor is temporarily closed, you can still enjoy it on the first floor. The room manager on the 26th floor, Xiao Huang, provides services in place, and responds to guests' needs in a timely manner. The suite is quite satisfactory, and the Shanghai New Passenger Station is outside the window. The Fanlu Western Restaurant on the first floor had a western dinner for two, breakfast, and happy hour. I enjoyed the service very satisfactorily during the meal. The restaurant waitresses Sylvia Wei and Mia Cao were very considerate. Thank you for the fruit and two bottles of Perrier in the room. , The fitness equipment in the fitness center is quite complete, but the indoor swimming pool is not open. There are quite a lot of people in the hotel during the Spring Festival, but the various services have not reduced points. Not bad 👌

The view outside the hotel window is average, but it is relatively quiet. The bed is very comfortable to sleep in. Although the hotel was renovated in 2016, it is actually well maintained.
The breakfast is rich in variety, omelets and tea eggs are delicious, and there is freshly squeezed cucumber juice, which is very friendly to sugar control. There is a supplementary fee of 69 yuan for children's breakfast. This kind of star hotel is relatively good. I will recommend friends who come to Shanghai to stay.

Because of sleeping problems, Aileen, who works at the front desk of the hotel, helped to upgrade the room type to a quieter floor. After checking out, I accidentally left the charger in the room. After contacting Aileen, she immediately arranged for free express delivery to my home. Very recommended!

I called again the next day and said that I would get it back. It took a little longer for a whole day. No news at all, isn’t this a bad idea? Is it so difficult to refund the deposit?

The most amazing thing was that the weather was so sultry. Since there was a power outage in the middle of the night, I came to repair it the next morning and said that the switch was broken! Later, when I complained, an unknown staff member came and didn't have a solution, so he said self-righteously: Next time you come to upgrade your room! Hahahaha how funny! Where does the confidence come from? Do you think we will definitely come again? The worst star hotel I have ever stayed in, not one of them!

Disadvantages: The lobby on the first floor is close to the western restaurant, and the smell of oily smoke is a bit strong; the bathroom in the room has an aftertaste; the hotel parking lot is a public space, there are few parking spaces, and guests staying in the hotel also need to pay.

The hotel hardware is a bit old, but Pullman's service is online, so the experience is still good.
The complimentary dinner was good, the two adults and the children were full. Breakfast is quite satisfactory, normal star hotel standard.
The bathroom door of the room is a double door, which looks more advanced. There is a row of floor-to-ceiling windows in the south, and the sun is very hot in winter.
The room faces the street, but the sound insulation is OK.
The hotel parking lot is not free, with a cap of 50 yuan for 24 hours, and 10 yuan for an hour if it exceeds. There are several charging piles in the parking lot, and the visual inspection is slow charging.

After parking, it was already 8 o’clock when the room was opened. When I charged my phone, I found that the socket was not working. When I picked up the phone, I found out There is no telephone line, so I can only contact by mobile phone. I waited for 40 minutes, and it was not easy to change the room. I waited for a long time, and the room was changed at 9:20. When I woke up in the morning, I was told the hotel when I asked for a parking ticket There is a fee for parking. I would like to ask why the security guard didn’t inform me at that time, and there were many cars parked beside the door. There are many exclusive parking spaces opposite. I sincerely hope that Ctrip will review this hotel carefully. It made my stay very disgusting. I don't know what benefits the hotel gave to Ctrip's review

The service and breakfast seem to be quite satisfactory. The young lady at the front desk is very enthusiastic, skilled and efficient

My companion suddenly felt unwell, and I wanted to ask if there was a cart to help deliver the luggage. The little brother was very enthusiastic and helped us deliver the human flesh to the entrance. The weather is very hot today, and there is a lot of luggage. I am really grateful to the concierge and Pullman for their considerate service. I will definitely stay again next time. I highly recommend it!

2. Although the swimming pool belongs to the hotel, it is open to the public. Half of the originally small swimming pool is blocked for tutors to teach swimming. Only half of the pool can be used. It is very crowded and cannot swim.
3. The hotel does not have its own parking lot, and the next door charges 10 yuan an hour, with a cap of 50 yuan
4. In the restaurant on the first floor, the 68 Chinese set meal at the door did not say that it was only available at noon. I feel like it's been a long time
5. When I checked out, I forgot something in the room. After waiting for more than ten minutes at the front desk, the waiter said that I was not available, and made me a new room card and told me to go up and get it by myself. The service is really not bad

The area is in the city center and the price is reasonable. There is a subway station downstairs. The price/performance ratio is okay, but it is not suitable for business trips.

When I moved from the 8th floor to the 15th floor, I still heard the roaring singing until 2:15 in the morning. It was so noisy in the middle of the night that I couldn't sleep, and the hotel couldn't solve it. The experience was extremely poor.

The hotel does not have a parking lot. When we arrived, we asked for parking. The valet waiter didn’t explain clearly, so he pointed in the direction. After we got off the bus, I heard the driver being scolded by the waiter. I asked what your attitude was, and he said it was because you turned around here, and I said you didn't speak clearly, and even cursed people.
Bringing a one-year-old baby, arriving at 14:30, there is only one person at the front desk. Regardless of whether we are carrying big bags or holding children, let us wait. I met a person in front of me who was very grumpy, and the baby was stinking again and was about to change the bag. After I asked if I could come to another person to handle it, someone came slowly. After checking in, the luggage cart was left unattended. The baby's change is in the suitcase. He called someone to deliver the luggage by himself.
The suite, but very small, the table and bedside bay windows are covered with dust, the facilities are old, and the mattress is soft and the baby over 1 year old sinks into a big hole when sleeping. Adults can't sleep at all. On the 20th floor, the noise is still very loud, it seems to be the noise of the equipment on the top floor.

The location of the hotel is excellent, next to Shanghai Railway Station, there is a subway, the center of Jing'an District, and Jing'an District is in the middle of the 8th district. It is very convenient to other Huangpu District, Putuo District, Xuhui District, etc. Online car-hailing taxis can be called to the lobby door. There are also many ways to eat around. You can order meals in the hotel. When you go out, turn left and exit the passage. There are many restaurants on your right. There are Lanzhou Ramen, Ajisen Ramen, Xiao Yang Shengjian, Shanghai Xiao Wonton, and several convenience stores, it is very convenient to buy water and drinks.
I booked a special big bed room on Ctrip. The room is small, only 20 square meters. At the front desk of the hotel, I was upgraded to a superior double room, 31 square meters. The room is much bigger. There is a small desk in the room, which is great for business people. There is a separate office area where laptops can be used. The bathroom is big and the bed is comfortable.
Next time I come to Shanghai, I will stay at Pullman Jing An Hotel.

You can have a room to stay on the club floor with an additional fee of 220, because you are in a hurry to spend money to check in. As soon as I entered the room, it was not ventilated, very stuffy, and smelled like a sewer. According to the front desk, there was almost no difference in the size of the room, but the difference was in the floor. The breakfast is quite rich, but it is crowded and the sanitary conditions are average. The service attitude at the front desk is very poor, it doesn't look like a five-star hotel at all. The location is next door to Shanghai Railway Station, very close. Generally speaking, I will not go there again.

The room I stayed in on the first night was better than the stove, and the air conditioner was turned off, and it was stuffy and hot, so I couldn’t sleep. The wind and air from outside the window couldn’t come in at all. It was so dry and stuffy that I couldn't sleep at all. On the second night, I changed the orientation of the room, which was much better than the first night, but the room leaked electricity, and the hands would be numb from the static electricity when touching any object, and the walls would be numb, isn't it too outrageous? ? In addition, the hygiene of the hotel's beds is worrying. After staying for two nights, I developed an allergic reaction to red dots all over my body. It was extremely itchy. It was worse than the Express Hotel. Hurry up and get the stars

The service was really average. I booked an executive suite and wanted an extra chair for guests to sit on, but they said there wasn't one.
The afternoon tea in the executive lounge only starts at six o'clock, which is very insincere. It is already dinner time and this gift is completely meaningless. Other hotels start at three or four o'clock.
Then there was no humidifier or dehumidifier. If you wanted to heat the takeaway, you had to take it to the restaurant yourself. I called and asked for two small plates to put fruits in, but they were forgotten when I left the store and they were not delivered.

Generally speaking, when I stayed at other hotels, I would call the manager to report the details of poor service. This hotel told guests in every detail from the first day of check-in to try not to cause any trouble to our hotel. I was completely disappointed. There is no mood feedback, and their attitude makes people feel that if you give feedback, they will only make you more angry, because their overall a**osphere is that they don't care what you think.

By the way, the breakfast was terrible. We went there to eat on the first day and ordered takeout for all the rest of the breakfast.

Because all the people who come to live here are from other places, all kinds of procedures are very convenient, and the whole process of check in is very smooth. As a person who wants to quickly return to the room to rest, I feel very good, without procrastinating.
When I came and left, someone helped me with my luggage and sent it to the outside of the hotel all the way. The service was very nice
The accessories are lavender-flavored, it smells very good, I like it very much
The takeaway is delivered upstairs by a robot, very cute
Overall, it is very suitable for a journey, or a hotel that you don't want to go out for a day when you just arrived. The price is very high.

msg:I booked two superior double rooms. When I checked in, the front desk lady told me that there was only one room left, and there were no other rooms, so I could only stay in these two rooms. After checking in, I found that it was not only at the end of the corridor, but also two rooms recessed inside. After entering the room, I found that it was not the room type we had booked, nor was it the floor marked on Ctrip. After turning on the lights, the room was very dark, and the bed faced A floor-to-ceiling mirror. Then when I went to the front desk to communicate, I changed a younger brother. After reading my reservation information, I was told that there were still six rooms left in the reserved room type. I asked why I was not given the originally reserved room type at the beginning? He said that the last service person gave me an upgrade. Really speechless, the front desk lady didn't tell me to upgrade my room when I checked in, and told me that there were only these two rooms left, and I had to choose a last room (the other room was not mine either. The booked room type was not informed to me). About the guest room: very dirty, the table, bedside table, and screen are covered with a layer of dust, there is blood on the pillow, the quilt looks broken, and the toilet is not to be touched. It doesn't feel like a hotel at all with the Pullman I have stayed in other places. By the way, the plug of the bedside table snapped and cut off the power when it was in use.

Because it is very close to Shanghai Railway Station and it is a brand hotel, I placed an order decisively. 1. After checking in in the morning, the electric kettle in the room was broken. After calling 3 times, it was delivered in the afternoon. It was repeated calls. 2. There is no hair dryer in the room, so follow the waiter to get it. 3. Service calls are often made, but no one answers. 4. The carpet in the hotel room is dirty. Dear friends who will book later, please be careful! Friendly reminder.

2. General: The lobby is a bit small, and the breakfast variety is a bit limited (maybe there are too few people during the epidemic). During the epidemic period, the executive lounge was closed, and the administrative trea**ent was changed to the restaurant in the lobby. The feeling is average.

It's okay to live by yourself.

I couldn’t stand it anymore. I contacted the front desk and gave me another room. , it turned out that the slippers were used and the toilet sounded all night, and the hair dryer was still broken. Then the front desk misheard and brought me an electric fan, and finally brought a broken hair dryer. Then I was so sleepy at night and told me Give me an upgrade and I say no. The next day a manager came to contact me and said that he would give me an upgrade next time I stayed. I said that if I stay for one night, I will get one night for free. I said that I can’t give it away.

After taking a shower, the whole bathroom is flooded with water. Yesterday It took almost half an hour to take a shower at night before the hot water came out. Then there are at least five, six, seven or eight small flying insects in the room, enough to hold a group meeting

One thing to say, this is not the first time I have stayed at this Pullman. It is cheaper, but this difference also surprised me.

It is a little troublesome that it is not connected to the floor where you live! Overall, this hotel is not bad, and will choose it in the future.

The room area is ok, the hygiene is very good, the first-line bathroom brand Duravit for the bathroom, the shower gel and shampoo are also customized products, the hotel standard is good, it would be even better if you give a fruit plate. When checking in, the front desk saw a child with a child, and took the initiative to give away a children's toiletries kit, and the service was very good. The breakfast is rich in variety, and the most important thing is that children under the age of 12 are free, which is very good. There are few hotels that are so generous. The water temperature of the swimming pool is good, but it is a little small, and the gym is not bad. All in all, it's a five-star hotel with good value for money

I am really speechless🙄, I checked in at 23:00, went back to the room to put things, went to a friend's room to chat, 02 :00 The first time I went back to the room, the door could not be opened. At 04:41, I sent a charger to a friend and was locked out of the door by an invalid card. In the early morning, I went to the lobby in a bathrobe to go to the toilet. Really speechless, the door problem of a five-star hotel is not as good as that of an express hotel. The manager on duty the next day replied with a simple apology and no explanation. In an understatement, I will give you a 20% discount on the room rate. Haha what a surprise. You Pullman is a basic five-star hotel. I'm sorry I don't need this kind of charity.

It is from Exit 5 of Metro Line 1. The interior decoration is also very elegant. The restaurant is mainly the Panlu Western Restaurant on the first floor.
There is also a Chinese restaurant on the 6th floor.
But it's been a while, and some devices are still a bit old. The waiters are a little less hot than the new hotels.
However, some of the package activities launched are really very cost-effective.
It's good for business trips and weekend stays.

During the epidemic period, there was no particularly cumbersome and inefficient inspection. The overall check-in experience is very good! The point is that the duty manager Isla is very friendly. On the first day of check-in, the check-in time was relatively late, and the room was cold. On the second day, I reported to Isla and directly upgraded it to the executive suite. I was very considerate of the guests and felt like I met relatives! The hardware facilities of the hotel are the first impression. The caring care of the lobby duty manager to the tired business travelers is the most important! Great praise! !

msg:The hotel is very close to the Shanghai Railway Station, but it also means that some noise is inevitable. The hotel has prepared noise-cancelling earplugs. There is no own parking lot, you need to park in the parking lot of the outside community, the passage is narrow, and you need to pay 50. In addition, Pullman's common problem is that the mattress is too soft to sleep well.

msg:The service attitude of the front desk and floor of the hotel is very good and very user-friendly. In particular, I would like to thank the concierge Mr. Tom jian for his warm service and concern. When I accidentally injured my finger and bleeds, Mr. Tom jian immediately took out the disinfectant iodophor and band-aid, and helped to disinfect and affix the band-aid. Special thanks to Mr. Tom jian. This also fully shows that the hotel management is very formal, very humane, and respects every customer.

The hotel staff are very well-educated, especially Harry, the staff member of the western restaurant, who is attentive and courteous! 👍👍When I come to Shanghai, I will still choose here.

msg:The train station is only 7 or 8 minutes walk away. The environment is a bit noisy but the location is easy to find. It just so happens that the company's office building is also nearby.

There are big windows in the room, the bed is more comfortable, and the breakfast is not as good as Intercontinental but it is not bad. TV shows are abundant.

msg:Pullman downstairs opposite the train station is the exit of Line 1. The executive suite is very convenient. The room is very clean. There is a special small coffee machine. It is suitable for my needs for a cup of coffee a day. There is a free administration on the 27th floor. Meals, snacks, soft drinks, free to eat delicious and delicious. Children like the outsourcing of the parking lot downstairs for 50 yuan a day. If you insist that the disadvantage is that the room will have a music after the phone call, the front desk said that the engineering depar**ent is off work

Staying for two consecutive nights, the overall feeling is good, the service is attentive, the quality of the bath products is good, the bedding and pillows are comfortable and soft, and there is no discomfort when sleeping ! 👍 The only thing is that it’s close to the railway station, the public area downstairs is a bit noisy, and others are quite satisfactory~ I will stay there again if I have a chance👌
