In addition to the warm hospitality and services, there are star-awarded restaurants in M.O. that are very family friendly. Strongly recommended for those, especially families with kids, who look for a quality time in Shanghai.

msg:Beautiful hotel with superb service. I booked a 2-night stay as a surprise for my partner's birthday. When we arrived, we had been upgraded to a room on the 21st floor with a fabulous river view. There was also a rose petal decoration on the bed and a chocolate birthday cake waiting for us in the room - such a nice touch! The room itself was lovely - spacious, clean, huge comfortable bed, fantastic shower. 

I had contacted the hotel prior to arrival to ask about the breakfast buffet and whether there were any vegan items available. The hotel got back to me with a full list of everything on the menu that is vegan. Added to this, during our first breakfast I was approached by the Executive Chef of the restaurant, who presented me with a plate of freshly-made quinoa bread, because he was concerned there might not be enough options for us. The following day, he had made us a special corn bread. I was astounded by this level of service and attention to detail! Amazing!

We used the swimming pool/fitness pool which were lovely (remember to take your swimming cap!) although the sauna/steam rooms are located in the male/female changing rooms, so you will have to do this separately. 

Check out was super easy and efficient and the lady helped to arrange a taxi for us. All of the staff we encountered were lovely, very friendly, super-helpful. I was sorry we could only stay for 2 nights! Highly recommend, especially for a special occasion.

msg:It was my first time staying at Mandarin Oriental Pudong, Shanghai. I felt very good! First of all, I am most satisfied with the location. It is right in Lujiazui, close to the Huangpu River. I love the riverside trail full of flowers downstairs. I walk once in the morning and evening. It is very suitable for walking and relaxing. Secondly, I am very satisfied with the hotel's rooms and facilities. I booked 2 room types, a Mandarin River View Room and a Deluxe River View Room. The Mandarin River View faces the Huangpu River, where you can see the ships on the river and the buildings opposite. The Deluxe River View faces the Oriental Pearl Tower, and the scenery is super beautiful at night. Both rooms are very good, and the Deluxe River View Room feels larger. There are no disposable toothbrushes in the room, because the hotel advocates environmental protection. There are no plastic products in the room, and even drinking water is in glass bottles. Disposable toothbrushes and combs can be asked from the front desk, and the hotel will provide them. Although there are not many types of breakfast, the quality is online, especially the bread is very delicious, especially the croissant is so delicious! The hotel service feels very considerate, the waiter is warm and thoughtful, and he will respond to any request, making guests feel at home. Very satisfied! I stayed with the elderly and children, and I felt very warm. I will choose Mandarin Oriental next time I come to Shanghai. The hotel is conveniently located close to major attractions, and a taxi ride is possible within 20 yuan. It is within walking distance to the Lujiazui Three-Piece Suite. Citywalk on Yincheng Middle Road is very pleasant~

On the day of check-in, it was this Mexican man with glasses who couldn't speak Mandarin well. On the day of check-out, he was also there. Sometimes he said he was busy, and sometimes he said he was looking for other colleagues next to him... Then there was no one around... There was no one for a long time... Attitude If it‚Äôs not good, forget it... you refunded the deposit after checking out (Is it so difficult to unfreeze credit card pre-authorization???)
Pre-authorization by credit card üí≥ is ‚Äã‚Äãthe most convenient way to pay the deposit! First time encountering this situation. . . Experience for yourself the strange experience that other Ctrip netizens had when they had their deposit refunded. . . A week after checking out, I found that the pre-authorization was not unfrozen... I went to the hotel and said it was the banküè¶ There was something wrong there... I went to the bank and the bank said it was the hotel and it didn't work... Then I called the hotel and called the front desk for a while. . . You won't give up until you try a few times... I really don't know what this Mexican Lounge manager does! ! !
It seems that I finally understand why the Executive Lounge in Shanghai Pudong MO is so poor! What kind of menu can a Mexican lounge manager come up with? The problem of too few happy hour meals reported before has been ignored and has not been improved [see pictures 4 and 5] This time the hot dishes are pork ribs + fried spring rolls (vegetarian) and snacks of lobster slices, and the cold dishes are salmon + cold meat , another soup and those salads. I can‚Äôt complain. I can‚Äôt complain. I can‚Äôt complain. [Say important things three times]
MO overall is still very good! But this manager of Executive Lounge in Mexico single-handedly earned this 1.0 negative review

The night before the Qingming Festival, I decided to check in at dawn. Thanks to the front desk Kent and Mia for their thoughtful service! Mandarin River View Room

msg:It is not the first choice of Mandarin Oriental. It is a very good experience. Because of some episodes during my previous stay, I got to know a director named Elaine. She always brings unexpected surprises to guests. It is also because of her that I chose to come back to Shanghai again. Such service is worthy of praise. I also experienced the executive lounge. The breakfast was very quiet, but orderly. The menu of zero points also suited us. I also met Zoe from the Club. She also helped me check out last time. The thoughtful and considerate service still remembered our preferences. I am very grateful for her care everywhere. The staff of the Club are very good. It would be better if there were more varieties for dinner and afternoon tea. But such service can be called Mandarin Oriental. Although there were many people confirming in the lobby these days, it still did not affect our experience. The switchboard efficiency is very high, which is very good. If there is a need, it will be arranged immediately. This is a Mandarin that is worthy of praise. I also thank these colleagues for their help. Praise

msg:I booked a Pujiang Yijing Suite with a high floor. When I checked in, the executive lounge manager Angelia was very friendly and professional. She arranged a Pujiang Yijing on the 20th floor (with a great view). Alaia in the executive lounge is a warm, generous, energetic, sunny and nice lady. The service is very considerate... Please praise the manager! 
The only drawback is that the executive lounge has too few meals! Afternoon tea only has 4 salty and 4 sweet scones. Happy hour is even worse... One chicken soup (there is no chicken in the soup! It's all mushrooms like enoki mushrooms) two hot dishes (chicken nuggets and shrimp corners) snacks are lobster slices, two cold dishes (salmon and cold meat) [see Figure 5] There are 8 kinds of cocktails on the menu (plastic-sealed card) üçπ It's really incomparable with the Mandarin Court in Hong Kong MO... It's simply... There is a world of difference... 
Surprisingly, the breakfast is surprisingly good! It can't be said to be rich in content, but rich in content! ! There are so many that it feels like it's about to burst out~~~ There is really no harm without comparison! ! ! Why is the executive lounge so simpleüâêÔ∏è and can't it be simpler... Is the feature of the executive lounge that there are few? ? ? Can we take some of the leftovers from breakfast and put them in the executive lounge to make it look more lively... It's really "dry or wet"! Really speechless. . . . . . 
Usually the executive lounge is arranged on the highest floor and is also a great place to enjoy the scenery! The executive lounge of Pudong MO is placed on the second floor. It is conceivable & obvious that the original intention of the hotel is not to take executive guests seriously! Hotel lovers who like to hang out in the lounge should be careful to enter Pudong MO. This lounge does not have its own name, it is just called Lounge. 
After all, it is Mandarin Oriental! The service is still online! Once again, I sincerely thank Angelia, the manager of the Executive Lounge, for her enthusiastic service and return visit. Angelia, who is dignified, smart and capable, also does the work of the guest relations depar**ent! Angelia has a service spirit of "thinking about what the guests think and worrying about what the guests worry about", which is particularly valuable in today's society! I wish Angelia good luck in her work and great success!

msg:The first time I stayed at Mandarin, I was actually skeptical. Overall, I gave it a five-star rating. First of all, Mandarin is a high-end representative of low-key luxury and connotation. The moment I entered the room, I felt the warmth of home. After staying there for two days, I was looking forward to coming back. The food was delicious, the environment was very sophisticated, the guests were very friendly, and there was a free car within 2 kilometers. You can reach the river as soon as you go out. It's a pity that I stayed in Shanghai for too little time. If I have to write a little hope, it would be more perfect if there were more public children's entertainment facilities. Indeed, Mandarin is positioned there, and the comments of frequent travelers are very pertinent. Friends who book for the first time, please rest assured to stay, you will find it is really worth it. Looking forward to seeing you again. By the way, Zhao Wenbo, the duty manager, gave very patient guidance and help. Thank you!

msg:I went there with high expectations, but the Mandarin Oriental Shanghai broke my trust in this brand. The room lost the Mandarin fragrance and had a smell that was not cleaned. The service capacity was seriously insufficient and the service level also declined. At nearly 4 o'clock, there were still guests complaining that they could not get the room. The administrative service was not reflected and was bland. The breakfast and afternoon tea were no longer exquisite. The location of the hotel is still good, with a unique bicycle path by the Huangpu River and a pleasant climate, but such a service level is really unworthy of this brand.

However, there is obvious vibration when the air conditioner is running, which will affect the rest.
Environment: quiet in the bustling city, with a greenway in front and no main road next to it, no car noise, more than 1 km away from Lujiazui subway station, etc., but the hotel provides 2 km delivery service, and the driver has a good attitude.
Service: The front desk staff is enthusiastic, understands the guests' demands, and will help the guests solve them.
At the same time, when evaluating each hotel, I hope that the room can actively provide small bottles of bathing supplies, because of the Yaduo Hotel incident reported in the news, I always feel that large bottles of bathing bottles will be used by some guests with ulterior motives.

The most considerate person is WenBo, the duty manager.

The room faces the Oriental Pearl Tower with the Huangpu River on the right. Guests are greeted proactively and enthusiastically, and luggage is carried by dedicated personnel from the moment you exit the elevator to getting on the bus.
The shortcomings are:
1. Toiletries such as toothbrushes and combs are no longer provided in the hotel. Although there are reminders in other cities that the environmental protection policy will be cancelled, they are still provided. As a result, you have to go out alone to buy a box of toothpaste at night. I hope you can provide them when booking or checking in. Make reminders.
2. This is the first time I have stayed at Mandarin Oriental. I opened the door and found that there was no welcome fruit prepared. I thought I missed it on the first day, and then waited until the second, third, and fourth days...
In general, I will choose Mandarin Oriental Pudong next time I come to Shanghai. The tranquility of the hotel planning, the homely feeling of the lobby staff, and the homely feel of the room layout are all unmatched by other hotels.

Service: Wei Rui Nais. I don't know why some people complain about the bad service attitude. From the check-in lady to the check-out guy, the attitude is very good. The lady saw that we wanted a quieter river view room and specially upgraded the floor. The view of the 21st floor is really good.
Hygiene: No obsessive-compulsive disorder, no perfectionism, and no itching when I came back. I think it's good.
Environment: Very good, very quiet, and the view is very good. Although it is not a river view, you can still see it very well when sitting on the sofa.
Facilities: This is not very user-friendly, but it is not a deduction. I just think it can be more perfect. 1. The location of toiletries is fixed, which makes it very troublesome to wash your hair if you are not taking a shower. You have to go to the bathroom to wash your hair; 2. The faucet in the bathroom rotates. There seem to be quite a lot of complaints about this. If you have shampoo or conditioner on your hands, you can't turn on the water at all, üòÇüòÇ, because it is very slippery; 3. The location of the paper is on the sink, so it is not convenient to use paper or something. You have to go to the sink to get it. I wanted to take the spare roll of toilet paper, but it was not easy to take it out from the top and bottom, which was embarrassing; 4. The curtains are not fully light-transmitting, and I was woken up by the sun's light at 6 o'clock. 5. The breakfast bar is not very friendly to Hunan people. There are too many Western dishes, and there is no spicy food if you want to eat, hahahahahahaha, but overall it is not a big problem, and I am not that picky. All five-star reviews, highly recommended.

I stayed in other five-star hotels and always had one pot. However, all other tables had pots on top. It was quite helpful to ask the manager to explain it. People don't understand. He said they would ask guests first whether they prefer a pot or a cup. So since you would ask first, why didn't you ask me? This principle cannot be explained in five-star hotels at present, because they all serve one pot. Even if I go to five-star lounges in other hotels, they only serve me one pot. There are many small problems that cannot be covered by service.

msg:I really love Wenhua. It is low-key yet powerful. You can feel very relaxed and comfortable in Wenhua. This time I stayed at the Mandarin Hotel in Shanghai, and I waited at the front desk to check in. In fact, after only a few minutes of waiting, a pretty girl at the front desk took me to the executive lounge on the second floor to check in (actually, she didn't know what room I had booked at the time.) Thumbs up for this personalized service. Besides, the manager at the reception desk saw that I had to wait for the Mandarin River View Suite, so he upgraded me to the Premium River View Suite. He only paid for the children's executive lounge fees. Thank you very much. Once again, I was warmed by Mandarin's service. The hotel has an unrivaled view of the river, and the only shortcoming is that it is far from the subway station, which is made up for by the use of commercial vehicles (within two kilometers, only drop-off and no pick-up). It‚Äôs very suitable for people like me who are prone to motion sickness when taking a taxi from a long distance and just want to choose the subway. Another great stay experience!

The Mandarin City room I booked was upgraded to a river view room. The scenery on the high floor is particularly comfortable and the breakfast is very rich. , there are also eggs benignon and ice cream, highly recommended!

msg:I booked a Mandarin river view room on New Year's Eve. I called in advance to reserve a room with a great view and I checked in in advance. Arrived at 2 o'clock, there were many people at the front desk, so we had to wait for a while. The receptionist was very nice and arranged room 01 and late check-out. The hotel staff are polite and considerate, and the service is very good. Although it is an old hotel, the facilities are well maintained, clean and not outdated. The room view is great and the bedding is comfortable. It's a pity that I didn't feel the unique round bathtub in person. Although the swimming pool gym is in the basement, there is no smell. On the first day of the ***** New Year, we also encountered the blessing ceremony of bosses and senior executives, which added to the flavor of the New Year. Looking forward to your next stay.

Manager Zhao Wenbo also upgraded the parent-child room, which is much better than Seagull Regent. Seagull Regent has no guardrails or cribs, and the bed is 1.8, the three of us were squeezed in and didn't sleep all night, and the bedding was not comfortable. I finally came here for a cultural break and stayed for another two days. It was great.

There are police everywhere around the hotel, and security checks are required for entry and exit. However, the hotel is quite attentive and there are many service personnel outside the hotel to guide and assist. , so overall it doesn‚Äôt feel like a hassle. A week before check-in, Ctrip's customer service had already called to notify us of this situation in advance. They also explained that they could assist in changing hotels if they felt unwell. I would like to thank Ctrip and the hotel in advance for their attentive service.
After arriving at the hotel, we upgraded to the executive ticket. You can also enjoy afternoon tea in the executive lounge every afternoon. The service in the executive lounge is very good, the service staff are professional and attentive, the quality of fruits and snacks is also good, and it is good value for money.
The hotel is in a very good location, very close to the Oriental Pearl Tower. It can be reached in ten minutes by walking along the riverside trail. Although it is located in a busy city, the surrounding environment of the hotel is excellent. It is close to the Huangpu River, and there are riverside parks and riverside trails. Overall, it gives people a feeling of tranquility in the middle of the bustle, and the whole family likes it.
I would also like to express my special thanks to Allen, a tall and handsome classmate in the restaurant, who met all the "unreasonable requests" we made during the meal one by one, and the service was attentive and thoughtful, which can be said to be both professional and witty. By the way, the Hainanese chicken rice at Mandarin Oriental is definitely worth trying. It is much better than what I have eaten in other restaurants before. The only one that can compare with it is the Hainanese chicken rice at Mandarin Oriental, Sanya. I had it at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Sanya many years ago and I felt it was very unusual. This time I tasted the same taste at the Mandarin Hotel in Shanghai, which shows that the Hainanese Chicken Rice at the Mandarin Oriental in Shanghai is indeed of a high standard.
The hotel room is clean and tidy, and the facilities are very good. The large round bathtub is super cool. My daughter likes to play with her Disney brothers in Yuzangli most.

Details can be seen everywhere in terms of facilities. The city view room also has half a river view. The drinking water is still soft water from New Zealand. The capsule coffee cup is equipped with an insulated cup with a vacuum layer. I even wear their disposable slippers. The most comfortable ever. The service is also considerate and will not cause embarrassment. When checking in, the little girl thoughtfully helped enter the names of family members who need to arrive late so that they can make new room cards directly. When the room service saw the do not disturb light turned on, they would put cards at the door. It was suggested that you can ask for the turndown service. What I particularly liked was Angelica Gan when I checked out. She issued an invoice and canceled the pre-sale at the same time when I checked out. She also specially helped me choose the room card. She talked without affecting the smoothness of my hands in a short while. Done. The hotel has its own parking lot, with free entry and exit throughout the day, which is definitely a plus among established hotels in Shanghai. MO may not be the most popular on the Internet, but the experience is impeccable, worry-free and comfortable.

msg:I stayed in an executive suite this time, and to be honest, I was a bit disappointed.
1. Facilities: The facilities and decoration are actually quite good, but they do not meet expectations. The main reason is that the electrical control equipment is a bit old. It is recommended to refer to the practices of some new hotels (such as touch screen control,...), especially in the rooms. The temperature-controlled room is really old-fashioned. It is recommended that the sofa be replaced with a massage chair (for such a high-end hotel, it must be amazing for customers). In addition, I want to complain about the design of the elevator, which does not clearly indicate that certain floors will not stop. It leads to a waste of time. In addition, I also saw that many people don‚Äôt know where the elevator button is and keep pressing the indicator light next to it. This is recommended to be improved. In addition, the vegetarian part of the breakfast is really recommended to be improved. In addition, the dishes should be Change (it is a high-end hotel after all)
2. Hygiene: Acceptable, but subtle aspects can still be improved (around the toilet, bathroom)
3. Environment: The surrounding environment is good, but there may be new buildings nearby that block a lot of the scenery. There are not many general businesses nearby, so be prepared to spend a lot of money.
4. Service: This service really makes me feel that it needs improvement.
A. Checking in for too long: During the holiday period, you should know in advance that the number of staff will increase, and emergencies will also increase. It is necessary to increase service staff in a timely manner. After waiting for a full ten minutes, the aunt was there later. What's going on?
B. The dining restrictions in the executive lounge were not informed in advance: I saw many families mistakenly entering the executive lounge for breakfast, and they had already started to pick up food, so I informed the guests that this was an executive lounge, which increased unnecessary disputes. It is really recommended. Placing the executive lounge on the top floor will firstly be more pleasing to the eye, and secondly it will be clearly separated and less likely to cause confusion.
C. The intrusion of the bed-turner at night: This is the most ridiculous thing to me. I provided my phone number to the front desk. When the bed-turner knocks on the door but I don't respond, shouldn't the first step be to contact me by phone? When there is still no reply, will you come back in 10 to 20 minutes? Instead of opening the door and barging in, which makes me feel super embarrassed (because I am using the toilet), this kind of service quality is incredible to me. Bad experience

msg:I haven‚Äôt been to the center of Shanghai for a long time. I was always in a hurry to transfer flights in Pudong. Finally got a chance to visit Lujiazui and the Bund again. Among the many hotels in this area, I chose Mandarin Oriental. Very satisfied with the result.
The service is friendly and attentive. We will ask guests if they have specific requirements and provide some details. Special thanks to Angelia Gan in the front office. Although I arrived at the store a little early, I was still assigned a good floor. The room type has a very beautiful view, you can see the Huangpu River and the Oriental Pearl Tower, without being too complicated. After having dinner on the Bund and taking a walk, I returned to the room and had already turned down. This is great! The bathtub is huge and very comfortable to soak in. Rested well too. Breakfast arrived a little late and there were many people, but the restaurant service and food quality were very good.
As a classic luxury hotel, Mandarin Oriental has always had a high standard. I will stay here again next time~üëçüèª

msg:I suddenly decided to come to Staycation with my daughter to spend Chris**as together. Choosing Oriental Mandarin is really the right decision. First of all, because of my Ctrip points, the front desk helped us upgrade our room type for free when we checked in, which was really great. Directly outside the window are the Huangpu River and the Oriental Pearl Tower. The room is very comfortable and the bathtub is perfect! However, it is recommended to provide shower gel next to the bathtub, otherwise it will be difficult to have a bubble bath. The breakfast was delicious and they also serve ice cream which was perfect. My overall experience at this Oriental Mandarin exceeded my expectations. The only flaw is that I ordered hot cocoa at night, but it was already cold when it was delivered. Maybe I need to think about how to do this better.

The beautiful and generous Angelia was very enthusiastic to help me check in. Because it was my birthday, she also helped arrange an upgrade to the room and a birthday cake. When booking, I wrote a request for a simple decoration of the birthday room. I said no, it was fine. She still arranged for colleagues to help decorate it in advance.
Special thanks to Daisy and Liu, the two ladies who helped decorate the room. They also left me a note of blessing after decorating the room.
Mandarin Oriental, Pudong, Shanghai is a newly discovered treasure hotel this year. It is quiet in the bustle. The rooms are neat, clean and spacious. Every staff member is very friendly. The staff will try their best to meet reasonable requests in a timely manner. We will come back next time.

Then I arrived at 23:00, and there was no one at the door. I had to do it myself to move my luggage. There was a man in a suit standing at the elevator entrance. He was sleepy-eyed and ignored me, which made a bad impression.
The buffet breakfast is also different from the Mandarin Oriental buffet in my impression. It is all self-service and quite confusing. You have to queue up to get porridge, eggs and noodles by yourself. I don‚Äôt like this kind of full self-service. It is much worse than the MO in Hong Kong. There is also a gap compared with Park Hyatt and Four Seasons. I think it is not even as good as the breakfast service at Langham. You will see that people are very busy, but the drinks are not served quickly, and the replenishment of vegetables and fruits is not very timely.
Therefore, throughout my stay, I felt that the owners and operators of Shanghai Mandarin Oriental did not want to provide high-standard and unified services. I can feel it and understand it.

msg:Facilities: I booked an executive Mandarin River View room with a round bathtub. The bathtub is really big and the room is very spacious. The executive lounge is quiet and less crowded, but the air conditioning is cooler. The quality of breakfast and afternoon tea is good, but if you want to eat richly, it is recommended to go to the Mandarin Kitchen on the LG floor. What is more criticized is the night light in the bathroom, which always flashes and makes people feel weird at night.

Hygiene: It can be seen that the velvet fabric and cushions on the sofa by the window are not very clean. It is unlikely that every guest will change or clean them after leaving the hotel. When the hotel aunt was cleaning the room, she didn't take away the drinking water from the previous guests, but she immediately replaced it with new ones after talking on the phone.

Environment: The overall environment is very good. The characteristic of the river view is that you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower and the winding turns of the Huangpu River, which is better than the picture.

Service: I requested the decoration in advance, and the flowers and fruits delivered were acceptable. Since the room had not been cleaned when we checked in, we chose to leave our luggage at the concierge. When we returned to the hotel in the evening, we went to the front desk to ask for the room card. A thin man wearing glasses interrupted our expression in a very business but impolite way, which made me feel very uncomfortable.

msg:Although it is a hotel renovated in 2016, the room decoration is of high quality and does not look old! We booked a few rooms with different viewing angles, but in general, it is recommended to book a river view room, especially on the upper floors. The line of sight is very good and there is no obstruction. You can get close to Huangpu at 270 degrees! There is a plump young lady Dorais at the front desk (I don‚Äôt know if I remember the name correctly, and Ctrip is not allowed to upload photos of people). The service is very good, and our rooms are coordinated and arranged on the same floor, although I have to wait for three hours for this. ! (There are too many people traveling, and high-rise rooms are in short supply.) From this lady at the front desk, I saw the unique vision of the hotel manager, and I am used to seeing too many meticulous and warm smiles. The affinity of this lady at the front desk is impressive. Light up!
The hotel's Chinese restaurant is much better than the Western restaurant. The dining environment is quiet, and the service level shows the level of a five-star hotel. The price is directly proportional to the service. Three or four orders are almost the room rate for one night! I would like to complain about the hotel's breakfast. The food is very good, and there are many choices of yogurt, especially the porridge cooked to order, which is great! However, the dining environment is uncomfortable, noisy, and the seats are crowded. There is no feeling of enjoyment at all. After eating a bowl of porridge, I want to eat and leave quickly. I don‚Äôt know if this is just the daily management or because it is summer vacation?

The hotel's Chinese restaurant has good service and dishes. Four or five dishes cost me a night's room fee. The quality is directly proportional to the price! For breakfast, I'm going to complain about it. The dishes are quite rich, especially the freshly cooked porridge, which is especially delicious! But the dining environment makes people feel like they have entered the vegetable market, noisy and crowded, not at all the quality that a five-star hotel should have. Maybe it is better if there are not so many people dining in earlier or later! But I still feel that the seat setting of the restaurant looks messy and not pleasing to the eye!

The only bright spot is the mosaic wall in the lobby. The room is quite large. The round bathtub is in front of the floor-to-ceiling window. The bedding is comfortable. The minibar configuration is out of class and does not meet the standards of Mandarin Oriental. But the drinking water provided is really great and of high quality. The breakfast was quite satisfactory, and the front desk service was not very professional. All in all, it was much worse than the fans in Wangfujing in Beijing and Guangzhou.

msg:The room type is very good and the view is great. The service is very friendly. The low score for the service and facilities is mainly due to the queue for breakfast and the staff who asked me to write a good review before leaving.
I have stayed in various five-star hotels from home and abroad and I have never encountered a queue for breakfast, and the queue lasted for 30 minutes. There is still a queue from 6 to 11 a.m. during the opening hours. This shows that the number of seats in the restaurant is completely insufficient and the categories are very few. It is really not good. It's worth making a special reservation for breakfast. The breakfast, lunch and evening dining experiences in the cultural oriental places abroad are very good. I didn't expect that it turned over here in Shanghai, and I was quite disappointed.
Another point that gives me a low score is that before leaving the hotel, as a staff member of a five-star hotel, they did not dare to look me in the eye. They clearly stated that I had booked the room but stood on the side of my friends who were traveling with me and asked for a positive review. Not even once. I am willing to look me in the eye. Since I have chosen a trustworthy brand to stay, I hope to get good service, not a service staff who dare not look directly at me and talk to me. Even if I try to have a conversation with a gentler tone, this A staff member named Kelcey didn't even look at me once.
The front desk at check-in, the doorman, and the staff who provided cleaning and supplies services for the room all had great attitudes. It's a pity that I can't give a good rating because of this staff member.

Environment: Some of the Mandarin River View rooms have a view of the Oriental Pearl Tower, which is inconsistent with Ctrip. Friends who stay later should be careful to ask the service staff. However, the service staff only communicated with me about whether to upgrade the room. I feel that even if I make a request, I may not be satisfied.
Facilities: The most unacceptable thing is that the water pressure in the shower is too low. I have never paid attention to this problem because the brand hotel with low water pressure has stayed in the memory of ten years ago. I doubt my life when I take a shower at night because it is late. I am too lazy to change rooms. The supervisor said that he will upgrade my room next time. Thank you and I won't come. If you still think about it, just fix it and don't cheat the friends behind you. In addition, the air conditioner was very loud. I slept okay, but my wife usually slept a bit noisily. There was nothing I could do about it.

You can walk to the Oriental Pearl Tower and IFC Center on the Bund trail when you go out. I left a lot of good memories from previous stays. This time, in order to recommend this hotel to friends, I booked 4 rooms in total. Surprisingly, the front desk management of the hotel was extremely chaotic. The lady at the front desk was ho**** and still working. I complained. I don't know, she just made a bad face at me, and asked me to queue up again to find someone else to check in. After I refused and complained, she slammed the door and left twice. Seriously wasted my time and messed up my mood. Later, the front desk manager finally came out, and another sister next to her was very friendly and efficient to check in, and even gave fruit as a greeting. Things are different, people are different, culture has fallen behind, the Bund is a good hotel, next time we must avoid pit culture.

Then the next morning at 7 o'clock in the morning, Jiulu began to come in and out one after another. It was noisy. Awake. Second, I didn't realize that the towels lost their hair at the time. I thought it was paper scraps from paper towels, or the towels fell off. There were so many third people. When we had breakfast at 9:00 the next morning, there was a line of more than 30 people at the entrance of the restaurant. After waiting for more than 10 minutes, the ordinary buffet inside was completely rushed. It takes 10 minutes for porridge, which once made me suspect that I was waiting for a similar hotel in the whole season instead of a 5-star gourmet hotel. But considering that it was the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, I didn‚Äôt say anything, and I didn‚Äôt plan to make a negative review. After all, there are too many people on holidays. I understand. In addition, the manager at the check-out lobby the next day knew that we were being quarreled by the staff room opposite, so he sincerely apologized and said that the note is good, and he will help me avoid it next time, which is also a comfort. This time I stayed for the second time on July 29. When I first booked a room on Ctrip and prepared to place an order, I saw that there were only double beds and no twin beds. I called the hotel to ask, but the hotel reservation depar**ent didn‚Äôt know whether it was due to performance pressure or some other reason. I have to recommend that I am a member and can book directly at their front desk. The twin beds are gone, but I learned that I will get a free upgrade when I bring a child, and free extra beds until the end. From Ctrip‚Äôs 2,700 yuan executive room type, it‚Äôs for me. I quoted a price of more than 4,150, and made it clear that it was very affordable. I refused and asked to place an order directly with Ctrip. To be honest, if I go to 4-5,000, I will stay in J Hotel, even if the weather is bad, but the service The environment and altitude are unique. After placing the order directly with Ctrip, I arrived at the hotel at 2:40 the next day. As a result, the check-in at the front desk was messy. There were 3 counters to process, and I waited in line for about 10 minutes. The first time I stayed in the hotel, I arrived early to check in. At first, I thought It's fine if you come during busy hours, just wait! In the end, when it was time to wait for me, I finally realized that it turned out to be accurate sales and recommended upgrades. No wonder it was so slow. I booked the recommended upgrade of the city view and the river view plus 600 yuan, because we are an executive suite, which only includes two adult breakfasts. , children aged 6-12 need to charge 318 yuan, and it is very cost-effective to recommend us to add it. In addition, there are other executive lounges and afternoon tea. I said that I will go out and come back at night after checking in, and then I will leave early tomorrow morning. Their front desk is really under the pressure of sales performance. Because of the lessons learned, they are afraid that there will be too many people in the ordinary breakfast buffet. Under the watchful eyes of the public, there will be people waiting behind. In the end, the room type was not upgraded, and a child's executive meal was added. It really felt to me that it was not a service at all, but a sale, and then I went to the room part. This time I really realized that the towels were lint-free, and the whole body was covered after washing. After washing, the whole body is covered, completely speechless. In contrast, some waiters are rude, not high-quality, and did not help with luggage. The conspicuous mineral water in the room and the drinks in the entire refrigerator are charged. These are small problems. After all, mineral water drinks It doesn't matter if it's worth it or not. I don't mind if it's too expensive, but I can't live without towels. I hope I can check it myself. Although there are few types of breakfast in the executive lounge the next morning, there are not many people. The service staff It is also very professional and good. It is worth the money. Seeking truth from facts, I am not afraid that you will be expensive, but I am afraid that you will not be able to meet the expected service after charging the money. Written at the end, the first time I heard about Mandarin Oriental, it actually came from 20 years ago when Leslie Cheung jumped at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong on the news. At that time, I was only 16 years old and didn‚Äôt know what Mandarin Oriental was. , I found out later that it is a hotel. Usually, the company or other people book rooms for business trips. These two trips by myself, I thought it was by the Huangpu River, next to the Oriental Pearl Tower. Living in the Mandarin Oriental is very suitable for the east, and the fan The LOGO is very oriental and has a good impression. The so-called love is deep and responsible. I hope these can be improved. The positioning and price of each hotel are determined by the market. If I live in a hotel that costs 1,000, I will naturally not ask for the environment and Experience, there will be no such complaints, but 3000 hotels provide such services, especially the towel incident, I can only say that there will be no next time, at least the Mandarin Oriental in Shanghai is not worth it.

msg:I saw many hotels along the way, and the reviews were mixed. I finally chose Mandarin Oriental, but I was worried that it might not be the hotel I wanted. From the moment I entered the hotel at night, there were foreign affairs activities, and I was very understanding. The room is clean and tidy, and the service is thoughtful, meticulous and comprehensive! The furnishings and living utensils in the room are also of very good quality, and the hotel and food delivery staff are very enthusiastic and pay attention to etiquette. The only downside is that there are pencil graffiti in the service guide. There are few varieties of breakfast, and the quality needs to be improved. Among them, there is a baked pumpkin, which is not tender enough, it is very old, and the entrance is still silky. In the end, Shanghai is a municipality directly under the central government. My friend didn‚Äôt bring his ID card to stay in the hotel, so he couldn‚Äôt use Alipay or the Uncle Police App to scan the QR code to stay in the hotel. He had to go to the police station to apply for a temporary certificate.

After checking into the room, toiletries and welcome fruit were delivered. Because it is the anniversary, I also sent a cake, including a lot of drinking water. The layout of the room is average, the curtains are not tight, light is transmitted on both sides, and it is just facing the head of the bed. Before going out, I asked the front desk to help me release the water in advance, and they did it very well. The floors are scratched a lot. It looks dirty.

In addition to the friendly service staff, the Check-in / Check-out speed is very fast, and the bedding in the room is comfortable and dry, which allowed us to sleep well for both nights. Coupled with the invincible window view of the Oriental Pearl Tower, it is really a comfortable journey.
It‚Äôs just that when we first checked in, we found a few hairs left in the round bathtub and on the small square towel, which made us dare not use the bathtub to take a bath on the first day. It was quite a pity. After reacting to the counter service staff, we promised to improve and next time Upgrade our room. In fact, the purpose of our reaction is to hope that the hotel can have better quality management. Whether it is upgraded or not is no longer important. After all, the next time the whole family will travel again, we don‚Äôt know when it will be.

Quiet amidst the noise, it is very convenient to go out, take a walk, or go shopping.
Check in and arrive at the hotel, the concierge is very enthusiastic to help with luggage and guide.
Ms. Doris at the front desk is very professional and warm. She chose the river view double bed for check-in and gave her the best location. She convinced Doris's choice and took the initiative to arrange for the housekeeping depar**ent to deliver children's supplies and macaron desserts.
Sure enough, when we arrived at the room, we were greeted with a huge and moving river view. The room was spacious and comfortable, clean and tidy, and the guest room center was cleaned and cleaned in a timely manner, so we could stay in a fresh environment all the time.
The drinking water in the hotel is imported from New Zealand, and the Olon full set is used for washing. When the room is cleaned, it will clean every position and every countertop.
The location of the hotel is especially recommended. It is very quiet to walk along the riverside promenade, and the flow of people is much less than that of the Bund. It is very suitable for quietly enjoying the beautiful river view and the a**osphere of Shanghai on busy days!
Thanks again to Doris at the front desk and Iverson at the concierge for patiently helping me check the Mandarin River View room and change the room! The oversized observation deck and oversized bathtub are really a great experience! Thanks to Sofi at the front desk, who dealt with the episode very patiently and meticulously! Very moved!
They are the best endorsement of MO's ultimate quality and service!
If you come to Shanghai and want to experience the humanistic feelings, experience the ultimate service, and enjoy the Oriental Pearl and the invincible river view, MO is the best choice!

The only fly in the oin**ent is that the scenery of the hotel is worse than that of several high-rise hotels in Lujiazui, but this will not affect the experience in other aspects. What is worthy of recognition is that their membership mechanism does not distinguish between high and low grades, and there is no need to collect room nights to maintain grades. All guests are treated equally, and each stay can choose 2 of the 8 benefits. It is very friendly to guests who do not travel frequently and want to experience hotel benefits (such as breakfast, upgraded room types, etc.)! Worthy of recognition!

The river view room has a good view. Go downstairs and walk for a few minutes to the riverside runway. While exercising, you can have a panoramic view of the North Bund.

msg:The room is as comfortable and spacious as before, and I am very satisfied with the floor, especially the breakfast in Pudong Mandarin is really rich. As a Shanghainese, I like to eat a bowl of small wontons in the morning since I was a child. In that restaurant, the aunt made freshly wrapped stuffing, the stuffing inside was very fresh, and the taste was really good. There are many varieties of yogurt, and the ice cream is also good. What is particularly distinctive is that guests can choose various ingredients they like according to their needs, such as shrimp, preserved eggs, shredded chicken, etc., put them in a small bowl, and then take the special porridge after 5 minutes , This is too humane, too distinctive! So Oriental Mandarin is a good place for me to relax. After eating, it is also very good to take a walk beside the Huangpu River.

msg:I have been to Shanghai many times, but this is the first time I have stayed at the Pudong Culture Oriental Hotel.
I arrived early that day, so I kept my luggage and went to have lunch and waited after returning.

The ladies and brothers in the lobby have a very good attitude, helping to coordinate and urge.
Because seeing that we have two little guys, let us go up to the executive lounge first.

Afternoon tea in the executive lounge starts at 3 o'clock and ends at 5 o'clock, and it was around 2 o'clock when we went.
The waiter was also very serious in the reception, helped to make coffee, and even filled the takeaway cups.

After the room was cleaned up, we didn't ask us to go downstairs to get the room card, and directly helped us press the elevator.
There are also a lot of welcome fruits and desserts. There are three types of desserts and four of each, so there is no fight.

The usual room cleaning actions are very neat, skilled, and professional, and the laundry is really amazing! ! !
I have never been stingy about replenishing items. If there is a shortage, I will replenish it immediately when I use it, and I will give extra at night.

Whether it is hardware or software, we felt a very good experience on the first day.
The bed and quilt of the extra bed were also shocking, they were not ordinary bedding for fooling around.

The breakfast on the second day was really good, the best breakfast in this year's trip!
There are many varieties, but the tastes of the ingredients are all online, and the children eat well.

The Chinese restaurant next to the restaurant must be tried if you have the opportunity, the Michelin restaurant.
There is really nothing to say about the taste, but it‚Äôs really impossible not to go to the 58-degree party room next to it.

During the four days of stay, the children played happily, ate well, and slept soundly. It was really great.
When the waiters see the children, they will go to play with them from the bottom of their hearts, and they will not be angry if they make trouble, and they are super gentle.

Mr. He immediately decided that he will live here when he comes to Shanghai. After all, we have been here so many times, and there is no one we want to stay in again.
When checking out, I also asked about the experience of the stay. If I made a comment, I would record it and make specific adjus**ents in the next check-in.

Perfect, the first trip with children alone, thank you to all the staff of Pudong Culture Oriental.

I only love to live in Wenhua when I go to play, and I trust it very much. It is the first time I stay in Pudong Mandarin, and the standard is online. I booked a deluxe river view room with an excellent view. Going to the spa, who knows that the Newman spa is too popular, and the appoin**ents are too full. I will only come to experience it next time. The breakfast is rich, and it will be extended until 11 o'clock on weekends. The pillow will be uncomfortable, but Wenhua's pillow is very comfortable and will protect my cervical spine very well. I must mention Wenhua's bed-turning service. I really like it. When I saw slippers on the white mat before going to bed, And sideways to the direction of the guests, the quilt opens a corner, and the familiar feeling rushes over. Choosing Wenhua is choosing a way of life, trust! Recommend everyone to stay

The rooms are large, clean and in very good condition. The only regret is that it is not facing the river view, but the night view is still very good (see picture)
The breakfast restaurant is not big, but the variety is enough and the taste is good. The waiters in the restaurant are diligent and polite.
Downstairs of the hotel there is a clean riverside walkway and a small garden. There are few people and quiet. It is very pleasant to sit down and enjoy the river view (see the picture "Shanghai")
Joe took the initiative to help when checking out, and I would like to thank you~
Next time I come back to Shanghai, I will choose to stay again.

I originally planned to book the Peninsula Hotel and then I booked the Mandarin because it was more convenient to go to the Science and Technology Museum. As a result, the hotel booked the Science and Technology Museum to be closed for renovation for two years. The overall hotel is quite satisfactory and there is nothing special about it. It feels like a modified office building. The fragrance smells good. The reception and concierge are well-trained. The shower and bathtub water valves in the room do not have hot and cold water and the direction of size. It is recommended to install a knob on it. When you are ready to sleep at night, you will find electric curtains It can‚Äôt be fully closed, so I called the front desk to arrange for the engineering guy to come over and work hard with technology to solve it quickly. In addition, the room is not facing the river view. The kid asked me why I couldn‚Äôt answer it, because I didn‚Äôt know when I made the reservation. I don‚Äôt know, there are not too many varieties of breakfast. One stall for bread, one stall for steamed products, one stall for porridge, one stall for noodles, and one stall for fried eggs. The breakfast is almost all covered. The quality is at the upper-middle level. The juice (orange juice) tastes not as fresh. Squeeze, if it is a family trip or try to avoid the peak price and experience, it will be more friendly!

Friendly service with a smile on everyone's face

Really nice to meet Mandarin Oriental Pudong
Will definitely choose again next time!

It is understandable that CI has to wait. After all, during the Chinese New Year, it was also given to LCO. The front desk is very professional and always serves with a smile.

The room has a wide view and a sweeping view of the river. Although it is relatively old, it is very clean. The sound insulation of the room is poor, and it will be noisier near the elevator.

The worst part is the catering. How do you make the afternoon tea, dinner and breakfast unpalatable? ? ? The Scone in the afternoon tea was cold, and it was dry in the mouth, and the dessert was so sweet that it was greasy. . . The Happy Hour in the evening is on the LG floor. There is a simple four-course dinner. Except for the staple food, everything else is unpalatable. The Chinese soup is still cold. There are quite a lot of stalls for breakfast, but in fact the choices are the same, and there are not many delicious ones.

The service and scenery are very good, and the food and beverages hope to be strengthened.

msg:When I went to the front desk of the hotel, I decided to upgrade the Mandarin River View Room. The two rooms have their own characteristics. One room has a full river view, the shower is very spacious, and the other room has half Oriental Pearl and half river view, with a large round bathtub. Even though there are a lot of guests during the Chinese New Year, the Mandarin service has maintained a high standard.

The things in the minibar are expensive, and a small box of peanut beans with sugar is more than 100. There is a lion dance at the gate on the first day of the new year, which is very festive

Facilities: Not bad, the air conditioner is not too hot, and the room is a bit cold, but the electric heater was added later and it was barely acceptable (wanted to add an extra bed and quilt, but unfortunately the hotel has no more);
Hygiene: Five-star hotels are normal, nothing special;
Service: It can only be said that it depends on the personal quality of the waiters. Some services make people feel very comfortable, but some service staff seem to have not been trainedüòÇ
Disadvantages: 1. Can't delay check-out, and the attitude is very blunt: 2. The attitude of the eldest sister at the breakfast noodle cooker is arrogant, making people feel uncomfortable

msg:Taking advantage of a city tour a year ago, I looked at the hotels on both sides of the Huangpu River for a long time, and finally chose Mandarin Oriental. The overall experience was very good.
Service: The service is very good, fully in line with the positioning of a luxury hotel. From entering the lobby to the layout of the guest rooms, dining and other details, you can experience the sincere, enthusiastic and meticulous service.
Guest Room: We stayed in the Mandarin River View Room. The room size is large enough. The layout of the entrance and bathroom is the type we like. Although it has been open for a while, the facilities in the room are well maintained. The round oversized bathtub is amazing, and it feels like soaking in private soup.
Scenery: Binjiang Avenue is at the entrance of the hotel. You can take a walk here in the morning and evening to enjoy the scenery of the Bund. The window of the room faces the Huangpu River, but you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Puxi Bund at the same time.
Meals: Since I played outside for two days, I only had breakfast at the hotel. There is nothing particularly amazing about the breakfast. It should be slightly higher than ordinary luxury brands, and it meets the standard.
Overall, I highly recommend staying here, and I hope to experience Mandarin Oriental again in other cities in the future.

msg:My husband and I brought our children to stay at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel on my birthday. After choosing for a long time, I decided to come to Mandarin Oriental. I like its low-key luxury and high-quality service. When I checked in, I decided to upgrade to the Mandarin Executive Suite, because I really like its large bathtub with a view, and I can also get an extra bed for free at night, and enjoy executive benefits, including afternoon tea, dinner, and breakfast and lunch the next day. The advantage of upgrading is the feeling Been enjoying it non-stop, trying every restaurant. Swimming at night, sauna, perfect day.
What I feel the most is the hotel's service. From the front desk to the restaurant service staff, they are warm, polite, and patiently answering questions. In order to allow us to have enough time for lunch, they also took the initiative to extend our check-out until two o'clock, a really heart-warming service.

The facilities are mediocre, the toilet is also manual, the bathtub is very dirty, I asked someone to clean it in the middle, it was still dirty,

Environment: The environment is average, there is no particularly amazing place, I rushed to the bathtub, and the Oriental Pearl Tower still has a certain degree of shelter
The high floor was upgraded for free, but the blockage was still serious. After waiting for two hours to upgrade the floor, we didn't take the initiative to inform us. We still gave us the new room key card after asking several times.

350 yuan no threshold for catering or spa consumption: the dishes and tastes of the Chinese restaurant and breakfast are really not worth that much, and the portions are also very small

I came here specially for my birthday. The hotel said that there would be decorations and cakes. The cakes were delivered after I kept asking for them. Actually, there were no decorations. The later response said that there were no decorations, so I sent some rose petals.

So I decided to experience the brand for the second time in Shanghai. But I was irritated before I checked in. First, I drove there. After getting off the ba*****t, I walked around n circles before I found the entrance to the hotel. After parking the car, there was no reception when I checked in. I explored the whole process and walked a lot. detour. Finally, after finding the lobby, I was told that a deposit is required, and the mini bar is not free.

At least after check-in, I agreed to deliver the toiletries, and they will be delivered to the room in a few minutes. When I left at noon the next day, I didn't wait until I needed to use the toiletries from other hotels that I brought. I think Wenhua has failed in this kind of service industry that needs to be done with heart. For a so-called luxury brand, you can have outdated hardware, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that the electrical socket in a river view room will fall off and there will be no electricity. I used to like staying here and I won't go there.

msg:It is necessary to give an objective, fair and realistic praise!
First of all, I would like to thank Ctrip's customer service for their patience and care, as well as their excellent and high-quality service, helping me communicate with the hotel, and finally meeting my small requirements, so that my baby and I have a pleasant and comfortable anniversary experience! Thank you so much and praise! Hope it gets better and better! Maintain and further enhance the service concept and quality!

Secondly, I would like to thank the hotel, especially the hotel's front desk service staff (Carson), who is very warm, very nice, very good service, very high-quality and excellent, able to do what the guests think, and completely put the star hotel as it should be Some of the quality is reflected incisively and vividly, and then it is completely from the customer's point of view, very humane, and also very patient and careful!
The location of the hotel is very good. Needless to say, the high-end decoration and artistic style show its taste and level. Needless to say, the breakfast is very rich. I haven't had time to try other restaurants including Michelin. I believe I will come later Yes, let‚Äôs experience it again then.
As I said earlier, this is a special anniversary. Through the communication on the platform, the hotel also took the initiative to express it very thoughtfully, arranging small decorations and exquisite pastries to express congratulations. The a**osphere and sense of ceremony are full. Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the hotel and its staff! thank you all! Thanks for your hard work! Regardless of whether the guests know it or not, they will take the initiative to help and remind them to enjoy their rights and interests. The room service responds quickly and efficiently, and pays great attention to details. From the doorman to the security guard to the front desk to the guest room to the lobby bar, we can provide consistent high-quality services. It seems simple but it is not so easy. I have stayed in many high-end hotels in different cities. Objectively speaking, not all high-end hotels can be exactly the same in all aspects like Mandarin, and The details are the same, not to mention that it is a hotel with a little time, which is really much better than many Internet celebrity hotels nowadays. There are still many details and feelings, so I won‚Äôt be too wordy here, I have already said a lot, in short, I am not promoting, not advertising, it is purely a personal test experience, and I am expressing my feelings. In addition to what I saw with my eyes, there are more It is the spiritual and emotional feeling, the most real, my baby also thinks it is great, the view is good, the service is good, the room is comfortable, the floor of the room should pay more attention to it, and the breakfast tastes richer and better.
In addition, I also used the hotel's fitness center during my stay, which is also very good. It does not provide residents with sports suits and sports shoes. This is one of the few even in high-end hotels. The gym I am in has this This service is very user-friendly, so I will compare it intuitively. The fitness centers of many high-end hotels are also very good, with facilities, environment, etc., but they are basically lacking in this point. I can‚Äôt say because This is a bad review, but it is definitely not excellent, because it is not good enough, not humane enough... But Wenhua has it, it is very good! Very good, the fitness facilities are also very new and complete, I enjoy it very much, and thank you!
That's it, it's already very long-winded, I will come again next time, maybe in the near future, I hope it can also help other friends who want to stay. I hope to keep this attitude and get better and better, like it üëç!

Second, we talk about the hardware. The hotel facilities are relatively outdated. The automatic opening and closing of the curtains is basically bad. Lastly, it is about service, because the epidemic prevention policy in Shanghai has changed from 72 hours to 48 hours. When we checked in without our knowledge, the reception kidd claimed that he was the person in charge and asked me to immediately I did the nucleic acid test and waited at the gate until the results came out before I could check in. At that time, it was 8:00 p.m. Generally, it took 6 hours for the nucleic acid results to come out, so he asked me to take my child to wait until 2:00 in the middle of the night in the late autumn wind at the door, without asking for any instructions. The relevant depar**ents did not put themselves in the customer's shoes and did not even think about it. The attitude was extremely indifferent. They did not really want to really help customers or give them real and feasible opinions. This kind of service staff felt serious dereliction of duty from the code of conduct to the ideology. Can't match Mandarin Oriental's hotel concept. There are also less varieties of breakfast in the hotel, but the bread and desserts are still commendable.

msg:The first time I stayed at this hotel, the overall experience was poor.
When I checked in, because I didn't bring my ID card, the check-in staff impatiently told me that only the Shanghai household registration can use the ID photo or check in with the application. The local people are very willing to cooperate with this work, but could you please tell me where the police station is nearby by the way? Because there was no guidance, it took half an hour to find it. Compared with other hotels in the same price range, the rooms of Mandarin Oriental obviously feel that the facilities are relatively old, there are many marks on the table, and some of the corners of the table are cracked, and if you touch it, you may scratch your hand. The bathtub and toilet felt leaking all the time, obvious during the day and affecting sleep at night. The same goes for the air conditioner. Tried to call for repairs but didn't ask again as no answer.
The room was not cleaned well, there were scraps of paper under the bedside table, and a dice suddenly appeared in the drawer of the bedside table üé≤, maybe it was left by the previous guest. In the middle of the night, touching the flashlight and touching a dice is still quite scary. And the dice are facing the bed, is it some kind of superstitious activity?
When I left the hotel, I was afraid that the hotel would recommend a membership card and register as a member again, just like when I checked in, so I left directly. So no check out experience.
The hotel's breakfast and the price of the hotel are even more unmatched, worse than the average Marriott, Sheraton, etc. I heard that the Chinese restaurant is a Michelin restaurant. I hope to have time to eat in the future, but I will not want to stay in this hotel again.

msg:The room type of the hotel has been researched for a long time and only know after checking in. Why are so many people taking pictures from the corners? Compared to several previous locations, this one is definitely not good. The most surprising is the cultural kitchen. Because the room we booked has a coupon of 350 a day, there is no place for 2 people to go on the Mid-Autumn Festival. In the end, I chose the cultural kitchen. I went to make an appoin**ent in the afternoon and told me to leave a phone call and other notices. It is possible to have a seat after at least 8 o'clock. At 7 o'clock in the evening, I plan to try my luck. Who knows that there are already many empty seats. The dishes are really few and disappointing. Some people rate the level of 150, which I think is overrated. There is no way to mention the toilet room. It is said that the management depends on the toilet culture, and it is extremely dirty and messy. This is where the management of a five-star hotel should be. The only remarkable thing is that when it comes to service, it does a good job. At the moment of the epidemic, the impact on the hotel industry is still quite large. In terms of food, housing, transportation, and food, it is recommended to improve and improve.

I have repeatedly recommended that we increase the price to upgrade the buffet, but I really don't like buffet, and I am allergic to seafood. There are a lot of people during the festival, and the kitchen is slow, so we have to finish packing and then take it to the room to eat. Dinner was a bit disappointing. The impression of 58 Steak House before the main is very good, and the expectations are high. The sony TV in the room can mirror the screen of the mobile phone. Although the hotel is very old and the floor is obviously old, it can mirror the screen, which is still very good. I watched a movie and accompanied the night scene. I am satisfied

Secondly, the level of Wenhua's facilities is not bad, but the reason why I give four stars to the facilities is because some details still need to be improved, maybe because Wenhua has been in Shanghai for some years, and the damage to some facilities is still forgivable, but If you are more careful, it should be avoided
When it comes to food and beverages, I am a little disappointed. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, with too few varieties. There are no ready-made stalls such as wontons and egg cakes. There are only two kinds of toppings for noodles. The coffee is coffee, there is a special bar, and the coffee flavor is not bad, but it is too weak... It is said that the breakfast is open until 11 o'clock on weekends, but if you go late, many of them are gone.
Finally, I was pleasantly surprised by the room. The scenery is invincible. For office workers who work from 9 to 5, they still feel that they have jumped out of everything when they see such a beautiful Shanghai river view. The hotel has a reasonable layout and is very clean! My favorite is the oversized bathtub, my son loves it very much. Others aside, it is definitely worth brushing again and again.
The water quality of the swimming pool is clean, there are not many people, and the gym facilities are complete
I also went to eat 58 ¬∞ grill during my stay, which is another evaluation.
Staying for three days, I feel like I don't want to go, I will go next time!

msg:Mandarin Oriental has been in business for a few years, and I have always liked his brand very much. It happened that a friend met and said that there was a cheap package, and he came over to incubate the hotel for two days on weekends.
The package on Ctrip is the Wenhua River View Room. The lady who stayed in the room was directly upgraded to the Executive River View Room. The room size is the same, the higher floor has a better view, and the food and beverages on the executive floor can be 20% off, which is quite satisfactory.
Wenhua's service is still very kind. Basically, most of the staff are of high quality, especially the young lady who likes to welcome guests in the breakfast room. She is beautiful, warm and attentive. Room service is also good.
The room facilities are a bit old, but they are well maintained. I think it's ok. The river view and the Oriental Pearl on our 19th floor are still very good. There is also a large bathtub by the window.
The location of his home has always been a relatively less lively place, and it is also here in Shanghai. It is a bit far from the subway, and the surrounding shopping malls are not all office buildings. But I still like it very much. Quiet in the midst of the hustle and bustle. The happiest place to go downstairs is the riverside green space and the ferry terminal. Whether cycling, walking or taking the ferry to the opposite North Bund, it is a good activity (note that the last ferry is currently available) It is 19:10, if you want to sit, please say hello to the shift in advance).
Then, this Wenhua still seems to be more business-oriented. There are basically no recreational facilities for children. The swimming pool and gym are also downstairs. It is still incomparable with the infinity pool sky swimming pool of the new Internet celebrity hotels, but the advantage is that there are fewer people. , basically three or four people throughout the venue.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the food. The package that includes a light meal for dinner is the one from his Wenhua kitchen. To be honest, the quality of this package is very average, or I shouldn‚Äôt order Chinese food. The whole set is just one main dish of shrimp. The ball is ok, it feels like a decent business package. The breakfast is now in the form of a buffet, but it is estimated that because there are few people, it feels that there are not too many things.

msg:I have stayed in Wenhua many times, and I feel that once is not as good as once. When the epidemic just recovered, we could still feel the enthusiasm and full working attitude of the hotel staff. It may be that the epidemic has been repeated too much, and the employees have lost patience. Many hotel employees feel absent-minded, without any spirit of service, let alone proactive awareness. As a business trip party who often lives in the hotel, I think there are many problems in the management of the hotel.
The hotel facilities are very outdated. If you are watching the World Cup or want to watch TV in the hotel, I strongly recommend you to choose other nearby hotels. The clarity is poor and it is difficult to connect to the mobile phone. If you have higher requirements for hygiene, you can also move. The carpet, bathtub, and toilet are not very clean. If you want high-speed Internet access, you can choose Mandarin Oriental, and the hotel generously donates wireless Internet access. Surprised or not!
The food and beverages in the hotel, except Yong Yi Ting, are in a mess. The price of Yongyiting is also quite explosive.
Overall, this is an extremely, very, very, very cost-effective hotel in the Lujiazui area. Think twice.

The location of the hotel is good, but the management is chaotic, motor vehicles and non-motor vehicles park randomly at the gate, and no one manages it. Someone is responsible for asking to scan the health code when entering the door, but it seems to be a fake, and it is useless. During the stay, I saw many people entering and leaving without scanning the code. I don't know whether it is because of the epidemic or because of the hotel itself, the hotel occupancy rate is very low. But check-in is also very procrastinated, there is no introduction around the hotel facilities, paid upgrades and free Internet access for registered members are very enthusiastic to share. I booked a room with river view, but what I actually saw was the river view of the office building, which is very heavily blocked. It is recommended to consider the nearby Shangri-La and Kempinski, which have real river views and better service. Jimei avoid lightning.

Maybe because of the closure and control for a few months, the owner has no intention of running it, and just wants to save money and make money. When the occupancy rate is very low, I just want to ask the guests to pay for an upgrade. If they don't pay, I will arrange a room on the 6th floor (the floor is below the 18th floor), disgusting guests. Registered members get high-speed Internet access. In fact, my mobile phone also has 5G. Toiletries are top-quality eco-friendly packaging. Very environmentally friendly, ranging from Bulgari to Courtyard by Marriott, they are not as environmentally friendly as Wenhua. Are you afraid that the guests will take it away? The restaurant Yong Yi Ting is still very good, and the production and service are very good. Breakfast at Mandarin Kitchen is really bad. The sanitation of the room is relatively poor. It is recommended to bring a disposable bathtub cover if you take a bath. The location of the hotel is far from the business district, it is awkward to take a taxi and walk. It is strongly recommended to pay a few hundred less to live in Kempinski or Pudong Shangri-La.

msg:Before the trip, I spent a lot of time choosing a hotel. In order to live this anniversary well, it can be said that it stemmed from my trust in MO and finally chose to spend the Spring Festival plus the anniversary plus Valentine‚Äôs Day in advance. Overall, I am satisfied. ~
Although the window of the room is not facing the Pujiang River, the Oriental Pearl Tower (including the three-piece suite) can be clearly seen. No matter what type of room it is, there is a free shuttle bus within 2km (note that it is only delivered but not picked up). All the sets are available, the room is very clean, and sometimes some small requests can be satisfied. Every service staff will smile politely when they see the guests. When they ask to arrange the anniversary, there are flowers, cakes and The petals are very warm~ In addition, the audio-visual equipment in the room also makes people feel very warm and romantic.
I happened to meet the lion dance team during the day and it was quite lively. There were a lot of people in the gym and swimming pool downstairs. It may be because of the holidays. I didn‚Äôt try it because the arrangement was relatively tight. If I have a chance next time, I will experience the swimming pool~
The temperature of the hotel is 22¬∞C all year round. The very detail is that there will be a heating device between the two doors, so as long as you enter the first door, it will be hot. The aunt who turns the bed at night is also very professional and will ask our needs to determine the time. , the humanized service deserves to be praised again.
Among the hotels I stayed in, I only gave detailed reviews to hotels above the Golden Diamond, whose quality requires it to be the ultimate. Therefore, I also put forward some suggestions for the hotel: 1. You can put another pack of paper towels in the bedroom in the room, only the bathroom has paper towels;
2. If possible, you can upgrade the hardware in the house price again, such as hair dryer, smart toilet;
3. The sprinkler in the room we live in cannot be directly facing the sprinkler when it is hung on it, it will be left or right, and we hope to adjust it;
4. It may be due to the larger room and better lighting. The light isolation effect of the hotel needs to be strengthened. There will be light leakage, because sometimes the rest is late at night, and I hope to have high-quality sleep during the day. I hope the hotel will pay attention to this.

msg:The hotel is located on the south side of the Oriental Pearl Tower and faces the Huangpu River. If you live in a Wenhua River View Room, you can see the river and the Oriental Pearl River at the same time, with a first-class view. Go out the small gate in the south of the hotel and turn right, you can walk directly to the riverside, about 20-30 meters, the sunset on the riverside is very beautiful. If you have a meal, you can go to Shangyuewan to solve the problem, and you can eat whenever there are fewer people. If you go to Lujiazui restaurant, remember to make a reservation

msg:You can't leave Shanghai during the Spring Festival, you can only check in hotels in Shanghai. Between Kempinski Hotel and Mandarin Pudong, I chose Mandarin Pudong, because the Hong Kong Mandarin made a good impression on me a few years ago! Since this check-in coincided with the Spring Festival, we only came to check in at around 4 pm in order to avoid the peak, but we still made our family wait for nearly an hour! I booked a Wenhua Riverview room, and I gave it on the 9th floor. The riverview can only be said to be average, and it was blocked by the building in front! At night, you can see the Oriental Pearl, because the floor is relatively low, so you can only see the sphere! The facilities in the room are good. There are all the things that should be there. The dry and wet separation is done well. The toilet and toilet are separated! After checking in, I took my child to the swimming pool I was thinking of, and it was told that there was no storage box in the men's locker room, so I was given a bag... This left us speechless! It's the first time I've encountered this! The pool is quite big and there are not many people, and there are two hot pools! It's still very comfortable in winter, and it's more suitable for children! After swimming, I wanted to take the children to a buffet, because I ordered a 2 large and 2 small buffet on Ctrip in advance, but I mistakenly read that 2/2 of the day was restricted use, so I had to drive to Guojin for dinner! By the way, the hotel's toiletries are from Oulong. There is a big body lotion won my heart! Because the configuration of the room is a 2-meter large bed, it is OK for the two of us to take a nap, and the pillows and quilts are also very comfortable. There is a sofa, so even if you bring a big or small friend, you can sleep in it! You can ask the hotel for more quilts! The breakfast variety of the hotel is quite rich, that is, there are many people during the Spring Festival, and there is a long queue waiting for a seat! Our two children did not overcharge us for our meals! In addition, the hotel offers free parking for guests staying at the hotel! This is still good! It seems that many hotels in Shanghai have to pay for parking! In addition, praise the attitude of the waiter is very good!

It was my first time staying in a hotel under this brand and the experience was great! Babies like breakfast, afternoon tea, and swimming pools, and they are happy every day. The only downside is that we booked a suite with only one bathroom, but other room services were super helpful! The view from the hotel is also very good. The indoor heated swimming pool on the LG floor makes the baby rejoice.

Finally asked the lobby manager for a room. The room facilities are a bit old mainly due to poor maintenance. For example, the sliding door of the bathroom is broken, and the other side cannot be pulled tightly. One of the bedside lamps was broken. The light control system and its tasteless, after all the main switches are turned off, there is still a light that will turn on at night, which is incredible. The bed is soft and not suitable for friends who like hard beds. Other overall services are ok, I use Oulong's toiletries, which I like very much. Too many people for breakfast! At half past nine, there was a long queue. Apparently, peak hours are not adequately arranged.

At the beginning of New Year's Eve, there are too many people, and there are people everywhere, which affects the service level. Generally speaking, Guangzhou Mandarin Oriental is much better than Pudong except for the view. If you have the opportunity, you can go to Sanya and Beijing to check in.

The weather was not good, the drizzle was continuous, and the visibility was not very good. I stayed in the executive river view room and could only hope that the sunshine would be better the next day. (Sure enough, the sky was clear the next day, and outside the large floor-to-ceiling glass window was the Bund Marina)!

Because I stayed in an executive room, I was led to the front desk of the executive lounge on the 2nd floor to check in after entering the hotel from the 1st floor. I was very satisfied with the full service. Afterwards, I could enjoy "afternoon tea" starting at 15:00 and "HappyHour" starting at 18:00 in the executive lounge. ‚Äù, the overall catering is online, and the taste is good; but the top 3 best executive lounges in my mind are still (in order) Shanghai Jing‚Äôan St. Regis Hotel, Guangzhou Four Seasons Hotel, and Nanjing Ritz-Carlton! This time, I took my new favorite Peninsula Hotel limited-edition "Deer Bear Cubs" to hang out in the executive lounge of Mandarin Oriental (za~chang)!

The Chris**as decorations at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel are still very beautiful, especially some of the details. For example, my favorite is the Chris**as stocking decoration in the middle of the escalator! The gingerbread house in the lobby is also so cute!

The hotel is located on Binjiang Avenue, facing the North Bund in Puxi. You can see the child-shaped river surface and the Oriental Pearl from the room. You can park in the hotel‚Äôs exclusive parking lot. You just need to get a parking ticket every day. There are plenty of parking spaces.
The hotel has been upgraded to an executive double bed room. The executive double bed room has more than 60 square meters, which is very comfortable. There are many special rights in the administration building, I have tried them all, haha.
Let‚Äôs talk about the executive lounge, breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening cocktails. Every time in the past is full of delicious food. People who don‚Äôt have a big appetite can basically not go out to eat. The hotel‚Äôs refreshments are absolutely full! Two pieces of clothes are dry-cleaned for free every day. This can‚Äôt be accumulated. We stayed for three days and had two pieces of clothes a day. It was very convenient and very fast. The fastest two pieces were delivered in the afternoon, and they were cleaned and returned at night!
Private car, free delivery within 2 kilometers, because the hotel is in Lujiazui, there are many high-end shopping malls and commercial buildings nearby, and the parking fee is very expensive. No matter you pick it up, it‚Äôs not easy to park around, but it‚Äôs already very convenient. When we come back, we basically walk along the Binjiang Avenue to see the river view, and we will arrive in a while.
The first time I lived in Wenhua, I was still attracted by his service. The service staff in any post were very polite and proactive. I never carried my luggage when I entered the door. Very good!
Well, I have to say something that is not enough, that is, the toilet does not have a smart toilet seat, and I don't like it. For the hot and cold faucets in the bathroom, if you don't know the direction of rotation at the beginning, you can stick a reminder.

1. Back to the hotel at 1:00 in the morning, there is no hot water, the equipment is broken and needs repair, 20 minutes, wait
2. At 2:30, the hot water came and it was all sewage. Call the front desk, and the answer is as follows, "It has just been repaired, let's put some water, drain the sewage, and it will be fine", okay
3. At 4:30, the water has been released, it is still the same, there is no change, and the image is not released, it is exactly the same as the image 1, so forget it

Emotional description:
1. This should be my first bad review on Ctrip. It‚Äôs really not a break. I usually forget it. At most I won‚Äôt be able to stop next time. But this time it really seriously affected my work and rest. I have to say
2. The equipment is broken, it's normal, I'm unlucky. Need to wait, normal, no one is a fairy. But, lady at the front desk, if you said "the equipment has just been repaired, just put it in the water", I really broke the defense directly. I was so angry that I paused for 5 seconds. I can only say, let someone come to the bathtub for disinfection. Please empathize with me. I waited for an hour and a half, and found that the water was hot, but it was dirty, and it still couldn‚Äôt be used. At 3 o‚Äôclock in the morning, is it really okay?
3. Here comes the most broken defense. After disinfecting the bathtub, then listen to the young lady at the front desk, drain the water until it is drained, and I will help your colleagues in the maintenance depar**ent do all the work. But after another hour and a half, at 4:30 in the morning, it was still the same. Big guys in the maintenance depar**ent, didn't you know that there was sewage when you were repairing it? In theory, isn‚Äôt your row faster? Do guests need to arrange themselves? Take 10,000 steps back. Okay, the residents will arrange their own arrangements. Please tell me in advance. It makes me feel a little expectant. I won't think about life in this tank of sewage! I also reserved a tank for you, so that you can empathize, 1905, thank you for going!

Conclusion:
1. Good location, quiet and convenient
2. The scenery is good, facing Jiang Jing in a daze, very comfortable, and come here in March, there is a row of cherry blossom trees at the door, really beautiful
3. I believe that this happened because of my bad luck recently. If a friend with a weak European a**osphere does not have expectations of the hotel‚Äôs emergency response, then consider it carefully.
Personally, I dare not. I have really bad luck recently and want to sleep well.
It's not the first time to live, it is indeed a bit emotional. The last two photos, commemorate the days and nights here, goodbye, never see you again!

What's not the location, the center of Lujiazui
I booked the Wenhua River View Room. The floor was very high and the river view was unobstructed. The room was very large. The most comfortable one was the huge round bathtub. I liked it. After a day, the bath is very comfortable. There are also two sinks. There are few hotels, and overall the price is really high.
Will definitely choose to stay in the future

msg:In the early morning, when I returned to the hotel parking lot from Haidilao with my boyfriend, the screen showed that the parking space was full, so my boyfriend went back to the hotel door and got off the car to ask about the security guard at the hotel door. The security guard had a bad attitude, so I started arguing with my boyfriend and bumped into him in the process. He deliberately fell to the ground and started his performance to extort money. The hotel staff did not do anything to stop the security guard from performing the clown show, so the boyfriend had no choice but to call 110 and 120. After 120 arrived at the scene, he was clearly told that he could not be driven while he was acting. We stayed up all night and went to the police station with him to spend the whole night. We didn't go back to the hotel room until dawn, which meant that we didn't stay in the hotel the whole time. There was no explanation that the employee was outsourced, and his bad behavior had nothing to do with the hotel. It's really a five-star hotel with such poor service. I am disappointed and will never stay in this hotel again in my life.

Room: I chose a river view room when I made the reservation. On the first day I got the room, it really met the written standard of 15 o'clock. When I entered the room, I saw that the river view was a small corner of the bathtub. I was too tired to bother changing rooms because it was really difficult. I wanted to take a rest after waiting for too long, but I didn‚Äôt know what time I could get the room if I kept waiting.

Catering: Breakfast included, there was a long queue in the morning. The point is that the breakfast was nothing, there was nothing to eat. The guests walked around with plates and grimaces. How much could they eat in the end? The sausage is not even as good as Shuanghui ham sausage. It is understandable that the reception volume is larger than usual, but the procurement of ingredients has seriously fallen below the breakfast standards of a five-star hotel. There is also a father in the restaurant who complained about the breakfast production standards on the spot, which is even lower than the three-star standards. It cannot be achieved. Hotels with room rates above 2K are too inconsistent with your star standardsüòñüòñüòñ

The hotel staff are very enthusiastic, but when we visited the suites, they also helped us compare the prices of several platforms. It was best to book two nights on Ctrip. After seeing them, my parents also booked one night.
On the day of check-in, the hotel had already laid out the red sheets in advance, the room was very comfortable, and the river view looked super beautiful! The pick-up on the second day was also very smooth, and the staff were very helpful!
The breakfast options are very rich, as many as they should be~

There are jogging trails and cycling trails. It is very quiet and comfortable to stroll around in the morning. There are also many foods in the surrounding area. In the evening, I went to the next shipyard to eat steak in 1862, which really satisfies all the imagination of vacation. The hotel's service is also very good. The waiter will take the initiative to open the door and take the luggage. The security guard sees that I don't understand how to lock the shared bicycle, and will also take the initiative to ask for help. Although MO is not in Lujiazui's most golden location, it is more quiet and beautiful because of it, and I really can't fault it. The buffet lunch provided was a bit overwhelming but don't care about these details. All five points were given to the Mandarin Oriental who stayed for the first time, and the favorability was full.

Floor-to-ceiling windows have river views, you can see the Pearl of the Orient, you can also see the scenery outside the window in the round bathtub, the dressing table and clothes are also exquisite, and the bedding is comfortable.
üëâThe facilities in the room are well maintained. Except that it is not a smart toilet, the rest are quite ok. It is very convenient to have a smart control panel at the head of the bed. For toothbrushes and combs, you need to ask the front desk or call to get them. The hotel provides solid chewable toothpaste. Guests who are not used to it can bring their own toothpaste.

The hotel has a certain age, but it is very well maintained. The breakfast is very good. The food at Mandarin Oriental has always been of very good quality. I still remember that I went to the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong for breakfast with my sister. It was excellent! The pool water temperature is low, but it does not affect the use, because the equipment and services are really nothing to say!
The service at the front desk is also very good, the reception should be Fion (I should remember correctly) beautiful women, upgraded the panoramic room, the view is very good, some items of the hotel are also very clear, really very good, and will come again in the future!

msg:Since the beginning of the epidemic, there have been few opportunities to go out and play. I like Shanghai very much. It has the prosperous scene of Pudong with tall buildings and the different architectural styles left by the Puxi colony. I took advantage of the annual vacation and went there. Because it was an annual vacation, I didn't have a plan and didn't go to the scenic spots. I just wanted to find a hotel with river views and lie down for a few days.

After brushing the hotel for a few days, I finally determined the Mandarin, with river view, five-star, acceptable old and new, and the price met the budget within 1800, and I was very satisfied. I have seen many other hotels, either the river view room price is too high 2500+, or it is too old, Oriental Mandarin, just right.

I can only say that I am so satisfied. The service at the front desk is very good. I still remember that the young lady named FION arranged for us to check in. The service was perfect!

Needless to say, the room is quiet, clean, and the service is very attentive. In the evening, the room service will ask if you need to open the bed. In short, there is no dissatisfaction! The location is in Lujiazui, so be wise to meet people, and it's totally different styles from Puxi. It is quiet at the weekend because the surrounding area is full of office buildings. Most of the demand, takeaway can solve it~

In general, five-star recommendation!

As such an old high-end hotel, the water stains on this cup are the hygiene you should have. Level? ! There are also water stains on the faucets of the tables and sinks. Have you wiped it? Has it been checked? How can I ignore the details so much that I don‚Äôt care about the guests‚Äô opinions? 2. I ordered the Wenhua River View Room. This room is more expensive than the ordinary River View Room. Of course, I think the River View will be better. As a result, there are three windows in the room, the river view can see a seam, you can tell me about this room It is more expensive than other river-view rooms because it is a bit larger. Then you can call it Wenhua City-view Room, or just Wenhua-view Room. A room that can also see a small river view is not called a River-view room in the Shangri-La next door. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much river view you can see, but it‚Äôs not good to mislead the guests. It‚Äôs uncomfortable to spend two thousand nights and feel fooled. In addition, the floor of this room type turned out to be wooden floor, only a small place under the bed. The carpet, the ground is simply the visual sense of the hotel.

You will navigate to the wrong place. Parking is free. When you go out, go to the concierge on the 1st floor or the front desk on the 2nd floor to get a parking ticket.
[Guest Room] When I checked in, I was told that all the executive rooms have two get one free activities, and it is a long-term event. I knew I would stay here for 3 nights. It was a very cost-effective event. The room type is not a river view room, so the hall and the room face the city view, but the toilet can be said to have half the river view. If you are not afraid of looking across the river, you will have a nice view lying in the bathtub, as well as watching TV. The room has free wifi, which is basically enough. If you want to download or have high network requirements, you can also pay 80 yuan/day to use the high-speed network. The hotel provides solid toothpaste, which may not be very accustomed to use. The curtains cannot be closed automatically and need to be pulled again manually. The bed in the room is large and comfortable. With a child, three people sleep at all without feeling crowded.
[Service] The hotel provides a see-off service within 2 kilometers, but is not responsible for picking up. The departure on the first floor is first-come first-served. If you don‚Äôt have a car, you can try it. The staff are pretty good, the service attitude is very good, can take the initiative to ask and provide help, the explanation is very clear when checking in.
[Meals] There are three meals a day in the lounge, including breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening cocktails. The service is in place and the attitude is very enthusiastic. The requirements are basically met. The taste of the things is fair, but the type is not available for any meal. Considered rich. The entire lounge is L-shaped and is divided into a dining area and an office area. It is pretty good. People with different needs will not be interfered with each other. The hotel can also allocate staff reasonably to improve the overall service quality. The executive rooms can also go to the first floor for breakfast without paying any more. There are more people on the first floor. You may have to queue up after 8 or 9 o'clock. There are slightly more types of meals than on the second floor. The taste is slightly worse for various reasons. If the sunlight is not very strong, you can go to the sun room where you enter the door and turn left. There are not many people and the environment is good.

msg:-Location: Located in the Lujiazui area of Pudong, which is not the most central area of Lujiazui. Since I have a child, I can better understand the meaning of this location, and be quiet in the chaos-it allows guests to have a better rest, and it is also easy to calm down and think. Talk to it. (BTW, by the way, I will give you popular science. Well-known hotels in Shanghai Lujiazui Center include Ritz Carlton and Shangri-La)
-From the first check-in to the present, I have always selected rooms on the executive floor. The privileges enjoyed by the executive floor can be filled with half a piece of paper. For us, they are all very practical! For example, you can check-in and dine in the administrative corridors, you can send a car for free when you travel within 2 kilometers from 7 am to 8 pm, use the meeting room for 2 hours, and you can wash 2 pieces of clothes for free every day. And often you can encounter preferential packages for staying two, get one free.
-Baby welfare: If you bring a baby, you can add an extra bed, or you can request a guardrail on the original bed in the room (see picture). We did not choose an extra bed, but added a double-sided guardrail to the double bed. In addition, there is a children's menu here. I found that the children's menu for ordering in the room is the same as the children's menu of zest downstairs. You can eat in the room or go to the restaurant downstairs. It is grilled salmon + medallion steak on the children's menu.
-The a**osphere is great. The overall environment makes people feel clean, simple and relaxed. Except for holidays, winter and summer vacations, there are usually not too many people (we live on the executive floor, and usually go to the executive corridor for check-in and dining, so I feel that there are not too many people. ). The service is not 100 points, after all, perfection is too difficult, but it is good, and overall satisfaction.
Example: The cleaning aunt takes the baby into consideration when making the bed. The baby will sleep more at ease when the bed is made up and improve the quality of sleep! We really like this kind of proactive problem-solving service. Not every aunt can take the initiative to think about the guests, so I gave this tip and thanked her for her hard work.

msg:The first time I lived at Mandarin Oriental in Shanghai, I felt very good overall.
Now let‚Äôs talk about my opinion: I was always satisfied when I checked in at the executive lounge, but then suddenly a lady in a black suit and heavy eye makeup came to her, and her painting style changed suddenly. I can't help but arrange another floor for me. I asked if the newly arranged room has a full river view? She said that you have a specially designated river view or you have lived in a room like this before. I didn't want to pester her too much at the time, it's just weird that the hotel has allowed such heavy makeup? Can I change rooms without consulting the guests? At that time, I did not say that I was anxious to move in!
Of course, the overall service of the hotel is still very good. For example, as soon as the coffee was drunk during breakfast, I immediately asked whether to add it (and it has always been this kind of service). I also recommended this hotel to my friends for the first time. I will patronize when I have time in the future!
There is also the bartending tricks in the executive lounge. I hope that there will be more bartenders. I wanted to have a glass of mojito and I didn‚Äôt drink it. I‚Äôm a bit disappointed that such a good hotel can‚Äôt mix such wine...

msg:The hotel is located by the Huangpu River. I originally wanted to watch the light show in the room, but later found that the direction was wrong, so I could only look at the boat. The Pearl of the Orient is right at the window, and ships on the river are also interesting. The hotel service is very good, the staff is very enthusiastic, I upgraded the room, after I checked in, there was a waiter to ask if there was anything missing, the hotel is at the entrance of the pier, you can take a boat ride on the Huangpu River. The hotel has a special car to take guests to the surrounding areas, and it is very convenient to go to the aquarium, shopping malls, and subway stations. The breakfast is so-so, neither Chinese nor Western, with no special features, and not many varieties. The room is very comfortable, but it is not a river view in the true sense. It is just a side view, half of the view is blocked by the building on the side, which does not meet the predetermined requirements. The hotel itself is not big and there is no view inside. Overall, it is still very good.

msg:Apart from the unique location, this Mandarin Oriental is indeed a bit poor. In addition to hardware problems such as dirty floors in the rooms, falling shower accessories, etc., the hotel received several groups that day, and the check-in in the lobby was not reasonable. The diversion arrangement caused all customers to complain. This echoed the line up for breakfast the next morning. It was obvious that the five-star hotel could not handle such a large number of passengers. In the face of performance, the five-star hotel also lowered its service standards. Such a culture can only be blacklisted, and we will not patronize it again in the future. .

Especially the check-in process, each staff member is very attentive and professional, very patiently handling all my requirements, and I will give you a detailed explanation. The room is very comfortable. The only drawback is that the TV over the bathtub is too high. It is suitable for bathing and you can hardly see the picture. I will try other room types in the future.

msg:Staying on weekends, Mandarin River View Room, two breakfast included, less than 1600, and 350 in-store dining or spa coupons, comprehensive price-performance ratio can give 5 stars.

River-view rooms in hotels of the same level in the riverside area are basically 3k+.
I chose this for comprehensive price/performance ratio.

The location is not the best, but it is also a river view. Walk to the center of Lujiazui for 1 km and walk along the riverside. The weather is very pleasant~
Go a little closer to 1862,
There are many bikers and runners in Binjiang~

Free parking, but there are plenty of parking spaces in the lower garage, and parking is convenient~

Wenhua River View Room, all with big beds,
The design of the bathroom area is reasonable, and the partition utilization rate is high.
Various switches, charging ports, wireless chargers, etc. at the head of the bed are very convenient~
Lying on the sofa and watching the river view,
Soak in the bathtub and watch the river view~

Breakfast, it can be until 11 o'clock on weekends, but there is still a line...

There are more choices, and the level of the five-star hotel is quite satisfactory...

TWG for tea bags in the room, not bad~

What is more impressed is that it is very convenient to check out.
No need to go to the front desk,
When we walked to the lobby, the staff took the initiative to ask questions.
You can leave after you hand in the room card,
Very efficient~

In consideration of environmental protection, the hotel does not take the initiative to provide disposable toiletries.
You can ask the front desk or the guest room for more information.
The toothpaste given is solid, a bit unused...
Guests in need are advised to bring their own dental appliances, shower caps, etc...

msg:Every time I come to Shanghai, I choose Pudong MO. The service of MO is difficult to replicate in other hotels. The waiters have a sense of active service and can remember the needs of guests.
For this stay in the Mandarin River View Room, all the room requirements before check-in have been met. The rooms are spacious and you can see the river view and the Oriental Pearl Tower. Due to garbage sorting, the guest room has cancelled disposable items.
The breakfast is very rich, the bean curd with vinegar and soy sauce is especially delicious.
This time I also experienced the Lobby Bar and Hui Bar. The drinks and dishes are excellent, and the desserts are also very delicious, which is worth recommending.
Outside the hotel is Binjiang Avenue, where the greenery is particularly good, and the weather is good and you can go for a bike ride.
I really like the hotel, I will continue to choose, and I will recommend friends to stay.

msg:Compared to the Jw Marquis Hotel next door, I was so pissed off next door. The people carrying big and small bags were exhausted and went to the door and the doorman asked, "Are you here to check in?" Is it gone? ? Ignore me? ? I'm so tired that I can't breathe, you help me carry my luggage, will you die? ? Is the doorman used to look good? ? The front desk also has an uncontroversial attitude towards immortality. I was so angry that I quit my room and changed to Mandarin Oriental. Compared with the following, China Oriental did a good job. When I got off the bus, someone would help me with my luggage and lead the way. The attitude is also very good. Originally, these are the things that a luxury hotel should do at least, but I am suddenly grateful for this set of contrasts. Okay.
Other than that...a standard luxury hotel, the service and sanitation environment are all first-class, there is nothing that makes people feel bright, but there is nothing disappointing, maybe it is the feeling of staying in too many hotels. That's a bit numb üòÇ

msg:The epidemic hadn't completely passed away, and a little baby was uneasy about going out, so he ordered Wenhua along the Huangpu River.
This brand is still good. Thinking of having children, we are very lazy, so book an executive room and go to a hotel!
It seemed that there was a meeting when I was staying, and I had to line up when I checked in on the first floor, so I took my husband to the executive floor on the second floor. The waiter had a very good attitude. While helping with the check-in, he invited us to enjoy afternoon tea and repeatedly confirmed whether the room was ready. In addition, because of the birthday, the room was simply decorated, and fruits and cakes were also given. Because I booked it earlier and said that lunch and dinner were also delivered at the time, I was pleasantly surprised to send us dinner and lunch in the cafeteria~ it was so profitable!
When the waiter sees us, they will greet us and provide baby dining chairs. Especially the baby dining chair in the cafeteria I really like! Before we checked out, we also asked if we would like afternoon tea, and gave us a box of macarons. Husband praised macarons for their deliciousness.
Three meals and afternoon tea are all eaten in the hotel, the variety is complete, the taste is not bad. Because I bring my baby, I can't feast on it, but communicating with the restaurant can also boil some vegetables for the baby. I am very satisfied. The dinner buffet salmon and alcohol supplements are not very timely, and some points are deducted.
In terms of hygiene, they are basically satisfied. Because we bring the baby ourselves, we will bring him a crawling mat, and wipe everything with alcohol cotton.
The crib has a relatively high bed circumference, and it is a bit difficult to put the baby in, but there is no problem with safety, and the overall is very good.
In addition, the birthday cake is delicious! Thank you very much~ I will order their executive room if I have the opportunity in the future

The front desk was also very kind. It was early and the room was not cleaned out. We went to the swimming pool at noon. I just received a phone call. When the room is good, I see that the luggage has been delivered. I need to give full marks to this point.
Turning down everything is quite satisfactory. I experienced the Xia Yong Yi Ting in the evening. Nothing was done. I ordered the beef tongue and said it was burned. There were no ingredients and only two ingredients were prepared. Okay, let‚Äôs change the dishes.
The checkout also quickly handed the card to the concierge staff. It was good for the whole trip, but in the afternoon I received a phone call from the hotel asking if I took the children‚Äôs bathrobes and small towels home by mistake. After taking a swim with the baby in the morning, I went back to the room to take a shower, and then I told the housekeeping depar**ent that I used the towels and bath towels and threw them into the bathtub. Does the housekeeping depar**ent just throw them in the laundry basket and ask the customer to remember where the bathrobes are? Satisfied place

msg:I booked an external connecting suite and the overall environment was satisfactory. Unfortunately, the paper towels on the washbasin in the bathroom had a foul odor. After washing my face, I used paper towels to brush my face. I smelled the stench. It was the smell of feces. I felt disgusting. I washed my face three times. This is the worst in a hotel. The most important thing is hygiene, and it is a five-star brand hotel. I called customer service, and it took 15 minutes to arrive. He was an ordinary waiter. When he saw it, he said that the paper towels had no smell. It was normal. Even children could smell it. He said there was no smell and called the manager. He also said it was no problem. It smelled like logs. It was difficult to tell the difference between the smell of **** and the smell of logs. We often stay in hotels but never leave any comments about our stay. I just need to know the reason. No need. What kind of compensation, but this so-called manager said that there is no way to find out the reason, okay, then just treat us as unlucky, but I think I must make some comments here.

msg:The location of the hotel is in Lujiazui, which is a little more remote. There are no shops or convenience stores around the hotel, which is not too convenient. We drove by ourselves, which was pretty good. The room has been upgraded and can see part of the Oriental Pearl Tower.
When you have a baby, there is no entertainment at all. The variety of breakfast is not rich enough, and some old-fashioned snacks feel like they were taken out of the freezer and have not been completely defrosted.
In addition, the most unpleasant thing is that the price was reduced the day after booking. I called the reservation depar**ent to ask if I could cancel and rebook. The attitude was extremely bad (probably due to the xenophobic nature of Shanghainese). If you don‚Äôt like this job, don‚Äôt do it. , it‚Äôs really quite speechless.
Later, I contacted Ctrip customer service to coordinate, and Ctrip unilaterally paid the price difference. The Ctrip customer service who helped coordinate also said that the female employee in the reservation depar**ent had a tough attitude and was difficult to communicate with.
Although the duty manager of the hotel finally helped us upgrade the room type, the female employee's bad attitude and lack of service awareness really affected our mood. I feel angry just thinking about it now!

First of all, when I arrived at the entrance of the hotel, no one took the initiative to help you with my luggage. A bunch of people stood and watched, because I had noted in advance that I needed an extra bed. After I checked in at noon, I asked if I wanted an extra bed. But when I came back at 10 o‚Äôclock in the evening, there was no bed left. Plus, I laughed and called to remind me to add it. The same delay was today. I ran out of water in the room. I called the hotel service at 9.30 am and asked if I could deliver water. The answers were all good. I checked out at 11.30, but I didn‚Äôt send a bottle. What I said was different from what I did. It‚Äôs great. Awesome. The only good thing is that I asked for a room with a better view and was given a corner room. In addition, if you want a car, you ask the front desk, and the front desk asks you to ask the concierge. It feels like a government depar**ent, each doing its own thing, and then everyone has nothing to do, just stand and don't ask. Laughed.
