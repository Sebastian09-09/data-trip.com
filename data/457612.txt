msg:Very satisfactory hotel. We arranged to go fishing in the evening and sailing in Wuyuan Bay in the afternoon, so we found this hotel nearby. The hotel is in the wetland park, and the location is very secret, so it is very quiet and comfortable. The park is better than a botanical garden, and there are black swans to feed. I think it is the first choice for parents and children. It is really a treasure hotel. When I arrived at the hotel, the lobby manager came out to greet me immediately and sent me to the room after check-in. What satisfied me most was that I could check in 4 hours in advance and postpone check-out until after 2 pm. Special thanks to Xiaolin, the room supervisor, who played sailing in the afternoon and washed a lot of clothes after fishing in the evening. After a night, they were still very wet. He dried them for us for free, which solved our ** troubles. There are also Meihui and Hailin, the two front desk staff in the lobby, who always solve the problem as soon as possible! The breakfast shacha noodles and peanut soup are delicious. The experience is great! Oh, the hotel also provides floor racks and clothes hangers to cool clothes.

In addition, the coffee, tea, and drinks outside the swimming pool were also free. I felt that I could not get enough of the benefits. The hotel environment was very elegant, and the only quiet thing was the sound of birds singing and falling flowers. The most pleasant thing was the staff. From the restaurant to the front desk, they were full of smiles and would greet each other on WeChat when they met on the road. Xiao Fu, who had just started working, was cute and enthusiastic, which made people's eyes light up. I like Jianfa's hotels very much. From Haiyue Villa to Wuyuan Water Village, from Quanzhou Yuehua to Fuzhou Liyuzhou, I feel that Jianfa will be my first choice for Fujian hotels. The hardware of the hotels is similar, and the service is the soul. The souls of Jianfa hotels seem to be very beautiful.

msg:This time I chose a five-star resort hotel through Trip.Com, which is Wuyuan Water Village Hotel. As a city dweller, during the holidays at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, I hope to have the opportunity to relax and have a good rest. We arrived at the hotel early, and they allowed us to check in early. They also gave us a late checkout on the day we left, which was very considerate.

Wuyuan Water Village Hotel is located in the Wetland Park, with an excellent location. The hotel is a three-story classical building. The rooms are elegantly decorated, comfortable and of good size. They have balconies with a view of the beautiful scenery outside. The hotel package includes breakfast and one-hour bicycle free of charge, which can be enjoyed in the park, which is very relaxing. The hotel also has an indoor heated swimming pool for guests to enjoy.

The most important thing is that the hotel provides breakfast and lunch, rich food, beyond imagination, and high value for money. The hotel steward mentioned that if you don’t need breakfast, you can pay an extra $30 for a buffet lunch. Try it this afternoon and it’s definitely worth the price!

Because there are still scenic spots that I cannot go to, such as Tulou, etc., I will definitely come to Xiamen again next time and will definitely stay at Wuyuan Water Village Hotel again.

The hotel staff's good attitude and enthusiastic service made us feel like we were welcome guests!

After comparing the prices, Ctrip’s was the cheapest under the same conditions and I placed an order. After booking, due to personal reasons, I did not enjoy the benefit of free breakfast for my first order. Ctrip customer service took the initiative to help me apply for a cash rebate worth two breakfasts, which was directly credited to my Ctrip account. Marvel at Ctrip’s a**osphere!
I will re-evaluate the hotel. The environment, service and catering are very good. The waiters have great attitude. They greet me warmly when we meet. If there is something left behind after check-out, I will call you immediately. The minibar is rich in food, so you don't need to prepare snacks and water yourself during your stay. Potato chips, Snickers, Coke, Sprite, beer and orange juice drinks are replenished in time every day. Mineral water is not like two bottles in ordinary hotels, but five bottles. If there is less, it is replenished. There is also homemade bottled tea for self-service at the front desk. Afternoon tea snacks are also delivered every afternoon (I don’t know if it was hot weather or too busy during the Spring Festival during the few days we stayed. Most of the products delivered were purchased products such as milk and pineapple cakes. It is a pity that there are no homemade desserts as seen in other reviews. Because the hotel's desserts are so good! Looking at the ordinary cupcakes and puddings, the taste is better than that of many specialized cake shops, and the ice cream is better than that of many buffet restaurants. Every day at breakfast, I just regret that I don't have more stomachs. ), and there are also pastry snacks in the evening, which are not big but very delicious. If I were from Xiamen, I would be willing to take a special weekend vacation just for the food. There is also a unique starry sky swimming pool and bicycle riding service. My son goes to the swimming pool to play every night and rides to feed the black swans in the morning. It was a very comfortable stay during my trip to Xiamen! Recommended to every friend who goes to Xiamen!

Let’s talk about the shortcomings. The hotel’s service was not proactive enough. They didn’t proactively inform us that the room was available. However, they later helped us add breakfast for two children, and we were quite satisfied with how the problem was handled. The balcony of the family suite we stayed in was directly opposite the hotel entrance, and the traffic was very noisy. There is still room for improvement in terms of parent-child care. The only toiletries for children are adult toothbrushes and toothpaste. Overall, quite satisfactory.

I have stayed here for six or seven years, but the most recent stay is said to be managed by Jianfa. It can be said that this is the worst service process and quality among the more than ten stays! ! …

First, when I got off the car, I had a lot of bags, but there was no doorman. The only female security guard just looked at me with so many luggage, but she didn't move, just like watching a play. It took a long time for the front desk staff to come out to help...

Since the phone was next to my ear, the sound of the phone was actually more piercing than the noise of the drill! (The key is that you have already reminded me when I checked in. There is no need to remind me again the next day. For a weaker noise, you used a stronger noise to "wake up the guests to listen to your drill")

If you really received an alarm in advance that the whole hotel needs to conduct frequent drills, then you should not accept people to check in. After all these safety procedures are handled, you should accept guests to check in. This is a very bad feeling, and the hotel management looks like a mess!

msg:A hotel well worth staying in and comfortable to live in. The hotel is located in Wuyuan Wetland Park in Huli District. There are many beautiful black swans in the park's lake, and the scenery of the wetland park is also very beautiful. We particularly recommend the hotel's starry sky swimming pool, which is equipped with a gym, wet and dry steam rooms, and a SPA pool. There are also coffee drinks and snacks at the front desk. Xiaolin's service at the front desk is very enthusiastic and will remind you to replenish some energy after swimming. And Coach Shen, when he was on tour, he saw that my swimming posture was not standard, and he patiently guided me on my movements for half an hour, which is a trea**ent I don’t have anywhere else! ! It is highly recommended when you come to stay that you must go to the swimming pool for a swim.

It's very tidy. Although it's a pity that it doesn't have a flush toilet, there are plenty of fruits/tea/snacks. Once the balcony opens, you can see the beautiful view of the park. You can take a walk and relax after a meal. It's not boring to stay all day long. There's also a supper in the evening. You can eat it at night and it will make you want to keep coming back.
But there are not many choices for breakfast. There could be more varieties.￼

You can drink tea and enjoy the scenery on the balcony, which makes you feel like you are on vacation. You can also ride along the wetland park and feed the swans. It will be a better experience to stay with children. The buffet breakfast is particularly worthy of praise: there are not too many varieties, but it has everything you need. The restaurant is very hygienic, from the ground to every tableware. The fruits of the day include mangosteen, lotus root, kiwi, strawberry, cantaloupe, etc. Wait, I recommend trying the noodle paste, which is better than the "Rui Yi", "Waldorf", and "Conrad" that I stayed at later. There is also a children's breakfast, equipped with children's tableware and meals, and a manager who looks like a manager The staff and colleagues were there for a long time to pay attention to the details, such as the placement of tableware and the adjus**ent of the position of the meals.

The lake and the sea are next to each other, and the sunrise and sunset are all beautiful scenery. Without leaving the hotel, you can take a stroll by the Swan Lake and listen to the chirping of birds, which is super healing. The upgraded room has no odor, is very hygienic, has a large area, powerful and silent air conditioning, comfortable bedding, and good quality tea, unlike some hotels that only offer a pack of Liptons, which is not suitable for southerners who love tea. Eating at a restaurant near the lake is also a great experience. It is recommended to experience afternoon tea. The slow time passes in the afterglow of the sunset, forgetting the world and feeling full of vacation. Special thanks to Manager Hu for carefully preparing the birthday cake and gifts, and Manager Zheng of the restaurant for the warm reception. Wuyuan Water Village Hotel is a garden of the soul that you won’t want to leave once you’re here. It’s so beautiful that it’s worth your time.

The environment is very good, there is a wetland park next to it, where you can feed black swans and visit the maze. You can rent bicycles (free for 1 hour every day), but because we have children, it is not easy to ride a bicycle with a back seat.
The room is quite pleasant. It was just renovated in the first half of the year. It is not outdated at all, and the switch instructions are very clear. I am very satisfied. The room has a terrace, which is great for drying clothes.
Before I left, I visited the swimming pool. It was the first time I saw such a standard swimming pool in a hotel! sharp! It's a pity that we can't swim, otherwise it would be worth swimming a few laps
The location of the hotel is good. There are several shopping malls 1 km away. It is convenient to take a taxi for meals. It is also very close to the sailing center.
The service was also good, and the problem was solved in a timely manner. The hotel also has free snacks, which are also delicious.
I hope to stay in the Swan Room if I have the chance.

The hotel is right next to the Wetland Park. When you walk out, you can feed the black swans in the park. It is no problem to spend most of the day playing in the Wetland Park. Elderly people say that the environment here is clean, far away from the hustle and bustle, and the stay is very comfortable.

The first day I came to Xiamen happened to be the Mid-Autumn Festival. The hotel prepared a large box of moon cakes. Drinks, fruits and snacks were also provided for free in the room. Different types of desserts were served every night, which made the elderly and children very happy.

The only drawback is that due to the remote location, although you can order takeout, there may not be many riders to take orders. I ordered breakfast and waited for a full hour to eat it. It would be better to have breakfast in the restaurant. There are quite a lot of breakfast types. It tastes pretty good too.

If you are here to relax on vacation, it is recommended to stay here.

The hotel is located in the Huli District Wetland Park. The surrounding environment is elegant, quiet and not far from the urban area. The decoration of the hotel is in the style of a Chinese garden. It is built near the lake and is surrounded by woods, grassland and lakes. It is indeed a perfect place for family leisure vacation. Best place to stay. The hotel also has a huge swimming pool with clean and clear water. There are several lifeguards around the pool who are very dedicated to guarding the pool. The beautiful customer service staff and room attendants at the hotel lobby and front desk, including the restaurant manager and staff, are all considerate and enthusiastic. Their language is polite and gentle. They are eager to help us solve some problems, such as delivering clothes drying racks and providing snacks at night at 9 p.m. There are also late night snacks until ten o'clock, and the refrigerator in the room also has drinks, beer, cookies and snacks, all of which are free! Everything here makes us feel at home. All in all, our two-night stay at the hotel left the best memories for our family. Finally, our family hopes to have the opportunity to choose Wuyuan Water Village Hotel again and continue this wonderful and comfortable stay experience!

msg:The hotel is located in Wuyuanwan Wetland Park, and is uniquely positioned to enjoy the scenery of the wetland park. The room has a balcony. You can sit on the balcony to drink tea and look at the lush greenery outside. It is indeed a standard feature for vacation. The unit price of the hotel is high, but the added value is also high. First of all, the eight-lane swimming pool has clean water and not many people (maybe because of the high price). The deepest point is 2.8 meters. I stayed 2 nights and swam 3 times, which is a good deal. There are a lot of things in the small refrigerator in the room, including Coke, Sprite, beer and a Lux bar, which is not perfunctory. The complimentary tea is Tieguanyin in a small box. It is not an ordinary tea bag. When guests come, they use an exquisite small teapot to make tea for the guests. It is very stylish. The snacks given are fish skin peanuts and egg drop cakes, which are Xiamen specialties. On the right side of the lobby entrance are chrysanthemum tea and lemonade, as well as Xiamen salty cakes and water chestnut cakes. In the evening, the hotel will deliver sweet soup to each room. The restaurant on the first floor prepares late-night snacks from 9:00 to 10:00. It is different every day. Each guest can cook a portion, not a big pot dish. If you want to eat, it's convenient. There is a 202 food stall at the entrance of the park. You can walk out for a few minutes and the food is good. The hotel has bicycles available for guests to borrow. It feels great to ride along the bicycle path of the Wetland Park all the way to the seaside.
Let’s talk about the shortcomings: First, the breakfast is relatively simple. There are only four or five hot dishes and there is not much to eat. I cooked Shacha noodles for two days. On the first day, all the ingredients for the Sha Cha Noodles were empty. The second is the service. When I arrived on Friday at 12:30 noon, the front desk said there was no room, so I went out for lunch. It was already 2pm when I came back, and there was still no answer. Then there was only one person at the front desk, and there were a lot of check-out and check-in guests. There was probably a small leader in the small room behind the front desk. The front desk kept opening the door, asking questions, and then getting instructions and then coming out. Later, there may be too many people and he called directly to request. People came out to help, but to no avail. One person was in a hurry. This situation should not happen during the peak period of check-in and check-out at noon. When I checked in, I was not given the hotel's special welcome drink that was displayed when I made the reservation, and no one told me where the breakfast was or any other information. It was just a matter of throwing away my room card. I asked how to use the close-range feeding of swans shown when booking a room, and I was told that you can just get some vegetable leaves from the kitchen. . . You have to ask for cycling energy packs and special drinks by yourself. . . . So don’t believe the pile of benefits shown when booking a room
I will probably stay there again if I have the opportunity in the future, mainly because of the environment and supporting facilities.

msg:The bed in the room I stayed in last time was recessed. When I checked out, I reported the situation. The front desk staff said that if I come next time, I will make up for a free upgrade. However, this time I made a reservation, I specifically stated that the bed should not be recessed. The front desk also called me specifically about this matter. When I went to check in, they said that the room facilities in Building 3 were very old and the bed was like this. Yes, if I don't want the sunken bed, I will pay an extra 100 yuan to upgrade, but I can only accept it.
Pay to upgrade from building 3 to building 2. The facilities in building 2 are slightly better, but the mattress is also a little recessed and too soft, I can only sleep on the edge of the bed. The next day, I went to the front desk to renew my stay. I reported the situation to the front desk. The front desk said that I can only help me put a wooden board on the bed, so that it will not sag. Deal with the two extremes, speechless! Just slept on a plank all night!
At eight o'clock in the morning on the third day, I saw that the passageway of Building 2 was full of cars, and many people came and went in and out of the conference room. Then I heard the host doing motivational training. I was shocked when I saw this scene. Last month, a training session in Wuhan spread the epidemic to several provinces. Now I dare to hold such a large-scale gathering. I was afraid. I changed the schedule and checked out immediately. !
Finally, I want to say that there is no discount for booking a room as a member of the hotel. The member booking is more than 100 more expensive than booking a room on Ctrip. The member of the hotel is just a temptation, and there is no discount but more expensive charges!

I am very thankful that this trip was at the beginning of the month, and I did not take the plane and high-speed train. I drove the whole journey, so I was not affected by the subsequent epidemic. This hotel is also a five-star hotel, but it is older and the decoration is outdated, especially the room has a musty smell, which is unpleasant. I reacted to the front desk and helped us adjust the room very kindly, but it still smelled of musty. It will really affect the mood of living, the hotel environment is still very good, the swimming pool is very good, the fun is very fun, the breakfast is average, which drags the hotel back!

This time it is really bad! When we checked in last time, the front desk didn't remind them that they were being renovated. As a result, it was noisy before 8 o'clock, and the negotiation with the hotel did not stop. The problem was that no one told us that it was being renovated when we checked in the day before! Later, I got really angry, and I apologized for changing to a better room. As a result, I had a migraine attack because of the noisy decoration in the morning, and I went to the emergency room after checking out. If you still want my praise, forget about it. At that time, they finally apologized, and they didn't comment at all. This time, it was also because I came to the nearby hospital for a minor surgery, and I decided to rest here because it was the closest. I booked a garden-view room. Actually, there are still many rooms. This time, the front desk had to give a room that looked at the roof of the building next door and called it a garden-view room! I didn't book the cheapest room! It's an elegant garden view room! Then negotiated again, and changed another one, which resulted in a strong smell of smoke in the room. The smell of the last guest smoking didn't dissipate! ! Don't deal with it either! ! In the end, we were so angry that we said we would change the suite and we would make up for it. As a result, the front desk said that we have to look at the price of the suite online. They are more expensive to book a suite at the front desk, they just want us to book it at the front desk. Also, is there any listing on the Internet? ? Then I said that you should call your manager, I'm just angry. Management is chaotic. Hearing what I said, I quickly changed to a normal room for us, so what is this for? ? Do you have a room to put away for guests? ?

2、酒店環境很好，在公園裡麪，很安靜。
3、酒店能加微信，提前詢問居住注意事項。但是服務不及時，可能比較忙吧。
4、第一天居住，我們都是自己從酒店走到公園大門口，太遠了，帶小孩走，太折騰了。後來看到別人才知道，可以讓酒店送、接從酒店到公園門口。
5、沒有送機服務，評價裏有人説有免費的送機服務，實際沒有。挺無語的。

酒店位於公園內，環境不錯，對於親子度假來説絕對夠用
但正如很多評論所説，房間面積較小且設施有些陳舊，不知是否沿海的關係，房間裏有些受潮的味道，入住體驗談不上舒適（我們兩間房住三晚，退房時據説是有設施較新的房間，當時如果我們需要，也是可以提供的，可我們辦理入住時明確表示我們都是長者小孩，住的間夜數量也挺多的，請安排舒適一些的房間，當時的前台服務由禮賓暫代，説其他同事都在開會，衹有這兩間房可提供…我感覺有些懵，説好的五星級酒店的服務在哪裡呢？）
前面有些囉嗦了，但作為高分酒店，還是希望能夠加強對於員工整體服務意識的培訓培養，不要衹是在客人準備離店時，由經理人員表現出“我們下次可以做的更好，希望君再來”的態度，下次什麼時候能來呢？
