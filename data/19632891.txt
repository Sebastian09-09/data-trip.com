msg:The hotel is located halfway up the mountain in the scenic area. There is a viewing platform on the third floor, and they also helped upgrade the room for free. The guy who picked us up also helped us carry two heavy luggages, which was really hard work. Afternoon tea includes freshly baked egg tarts and cakes. In this cooling weather, it feels good to have hot afternoon tea in the room.
It is recommended that you just bring a backpack when you go to Miao Village later and travel light.

After getting off the car and waiting for a while, a young man came to pick us up. The young man enthusiastically introduced the restaurants and took photos. Very good, very practical for those of us who have not done any strategies. Give me a thumbs up👍
The rice noodles for breakfast are so delicious. The young lady said that the older sisters made the meat sauce themselves. I like it💕

The terrace view is very good, and I didn’t even go to the observation deck at night. Fruits, candies, drinks, and mineral water are all provided free of charge. It rained when we left, and the guy sent us to the bus stop and gave us souvenirs, which was very nice. Will recommend to friends!

Along the way, he introduced us to the delicious places in Miao Village, where to go, and how to get there. If you have any questions Must answer, it’s really great. The hotel environment is just like the photos when you enter, clean and very well designed. I slept very well, it was quite quiet, and the hotel bed was very comfortable. If I come back next time, I will definitely choose this hotel again. All in all, it was a very satisfying stay! The main thing is that the guys and girls at the front desk of the hotel are super enthusiastic and the service is very attentive! Very happy!

I'm afraid you still can't see the beautiful view for 900. The service is very good. The little brother helped to carry the luggage and gave souvenirs when checking out! The only drawback is that there is no hot water. Can you bear this? The temperature was still a bit cold on the night of May Day, but the three of us really took a shower with warm or cold water. This really made people very unhappy. This really needs to be improved, because we stayed in B&Bs and hotels in the next few days, and we all took a comfortable shower. Now thinking back, I feel that the price is not worth it, hehe

msg:The hotel's viewing terrace is beautiful. There is no need to go to the viewing platform. The house as a whole still retains the wooden structure, reinforced with cement steel frames. Only the stairs make creaking sounds. Other places are okay, but it is inevitable to be noisy in the scenic area. You can only live in the scenic area if you accept this. This noise does not affect the children's sleep at all, because they are too tired to get up. The room facilities are complete. Everything you can't think of in the hotel is here (as shown in Figure 12). Coffee is free, the terrace is available at any time, and fruit cookies are prepared for you to take. The only shortcoming is the hygiene of the details. Don't treat it as a five-star hotel, but as a humane homestay, and your mentality will be different~

The night view on the roof of a building behind is also very beautiful and quiet. However, for someone who has to get up early to catch the 9:00 scenic spot direct bus, I have to complain that their breakfast is a bit late, and they have to prepare it one by one. Fortunately, I arrived early and urged them to hurry up, so I didn't rush. However, the flaws do not outweigh the merits. In addition, I sigh that the chairs on the corridor bridge are comfortable to sit on, which meets the needs of the human spine.

The hotel is in the middle of the mountain. It is enough to see the night view. There is no need to go to the highest point, because it is too tiring to climb up, especially for those with children.
Go down and walk for a while and you will arrive at a restaurant where you can see the night view and eat delicious food. There are many restaurants along the river.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank my little brother for helping me with the luggage, physical work is not easy. This hotel was the only hotel that didn't take the initiative to call and add me on WeChat during the 7-day journey. Service awareness is not high. Of course, with the addition of WeChat, there are answers to all questions. The quilts in the room were all wet, my stomach was itchy when I slept at night, and there was a row of red bumps in the morning. What's more terrible is that the water is boiled to the hottest, and it can't meet the requirements for bathing. I won’t complain about other things. The requirements of tourist attractions should not be too high, but I am very concerned about the hygiene of bedding and bathing. More than 1,000 accommodation fees, it shouldn't be like this

The rest is beyond description. There is basically nothing to eat for breakfast.

msg:It’s the first time I came to Guizhou... We had limited time and could only choose one scenic spot. Finally, we chose the largest Miao village in the world. We thought we must stay one night to experience the local customs and customs. After reading up, we chose Xingzhe Shangju Hotel has good online reviews, so I decided to give it a try. The experience was quite good. I drove to the north gate first, and then took a minibus when I got off the bus. The hotel will send someone to pick me up. Come on The guy who picked us up was a guy surnamed Hou "Xiao Hou" who was very enthusiastic and helped us take pictures and carry our luggage, a very nice guy! The hotel is also very clean. Although it is an old house, the interior is very hygienic and the service is very good. You must give it a good review. There are a few recommendations for dinner at night. One is the Houjiazhuang Restaurant and the Thatched Cottage. Both are good. This Two are for dinner, and there is another beef noodle restaurant that is very good: the rural farm noodle restaurant, eating a bowl of beef noodle is very refreshing... Watching the performance at night, strolling around the stockade for snacks, a very good experience, and will come again ...recommended, remember that if you live in Xingzhe, you can find Xiaohou 👍

The hotel is not big, but small and exquisite, the room facilities are also very good, the bed is very comfortable, and the room hygiene is also very good, unlike some Internet celebrity hotels which are fancy. The public area is also very good, the platform is very beautiful, it is definitely the most upright viewing C place.
The service is also very good. The younger brother is responsible for picking up and dropping off from the ferry station and climbing the mountain with luggage. The breakfast is also delicious.
In short, the experience is very good and I would recommend it to my friends.

msg:1. Location: The hotel is located in the scenic area, enter the scenic area with luggage from the parking lot, and then take the scenic bus for three to five minutes to Xiaobeimen. After getting off the bus, it will take ten minutes to reach the hotel. I am very anxious, but this is a common phenomenon in B&Bs or hotels in the Qianhu Miao Village Scenic Area. The hotel is about 100 meters away from the river, so it is quiet and convenient. There is no doubt about this.
2. Service: After getting off the bus from the north gate, the hotel staff will come to help take some of the luggage and lead the way. This is the normal level of the local hotel. But after check-in, only the front desk told me where to eat breakfast. Other hotels did not provide basic information, such as what facilities are available in the hotel and what activities are suitable for taking photos of internet celebrities, but they were not introduced on the way to the room. The next day, the little girl at the front desk gave me a bottle of rice wine. Although I told him the wrong person, I insisted on giving it to me after learning the truth. This seemed generous and decent.
3. Facilities: The hotel is in the style of a homestay, an old stilted building. I will not use it to match the five-star hotel, but at least maintenance should be done. The downlights flashing in the corridor and an empty space above the tatami The lamp holder, as well as the lamp ***** plug that fell off the washbasin, seemed lack of maintenance. This season is humid, hotels of this grade should still be equipped with dehumidifiers, because the temperature in Xijiang is not too high, children with air-conditioning or people with weak physical conditions may feel cold, but they will feel damp if they do not open the bedding and the room. There are many mosquitoes in the room. It is understandable that there are no screen windows in the antique building on the stilts, but the mosquito-killing supplies are not placed in advance in the southern summer, and you need to contact the front desk to send them.
4. Hygiene: The lid of the kettle looks dirty, there is a small blood stain on the bed sheet that has been cleaned but not completely washed off, there is a spider web standing on the bed, there is a spider in the corner above the bedside table, sleeping at night Another spider fell on my wife and was knocked out. The spider that fell on her body is understandable. After all, it is the stilted building in the lofty mountains of Miao Village and it cannot be completely enclosed. But as mentioned earlier, the four places should be solved when the room is cleaned and linen, shouldn't they show up?
The overall feeling is that I can understand if it is a hotel or homestay in a scenic area within a thousand that can achieve this level, but the price of more than 2,600 high-end homestay hotels, and the type of hotel ranked sixth by Ctrip, disappoints me. This type There are not many hotel rooms, unlike the hundreds of guest rooms in major hotels, the selling point should be exquisite service. Although the room is a stilt building, the selling point should be a clean and tidy environment. As a user of Ctrip for the past ten years, I can't help asking whether Ctrip has continued to follow up after ranking hotels?

msg:This hotel recommended by a friend, arranged directly. From the beginning of the booking, I felt all kinds of considerate services. Tell us where to park and then buy tickets is the most cost-effective, and then tell us how to get there. As soon as we enter the scenic spot and get off the bus, a little brother will come to pick us up, because it is the kind of unevenness. On the road, the little brother carried our two suitcases (fortunately, they are not big, otherwise it would be too embarrassing for him). The hotel room directly sees the night view, which is very beautiful, and you can see it directly by lying on the balcony. It is really comfortable. The breakfast is also perfect, there are noodles we like, haha, and they taste delicious, and then the hotel can take photos and play, and the hotel will send fruits in the evening, which is really great, in short, it is a perfect stay Experience. When we left, the little brother also helped us send the suitcases to the ticket gate. Thank you so much for the handsome and cute little brother Xiaoyou.

msg:The hotel is located at No. 4 Wind and Rain Bridge in the center of Xijiang Qianhu Miao Village Scenic Area. It has its own independent viewing platform with a very good view of the entire Miao Village.
Once you book a room, the hotel staff will contact you to inform you about the route to the store, arrange the pick-up service, and remind you to bring less luggage. After arriving at the hotel, the butler at the front desk is also very considerate in introducing the attractions, tour routes, and special Miao Village restaurants, so that people will be relieved from the fatigue of the journey. ! The room facilities and sanitation also meet the standards of the five-diamond hotel. Kohler sanitary wares and Jinkeer mattresses are matched with the minimalist style of the Australian brand of cleaning and care. They are clean and tidy, giving people a relaxed and comfortable check-in experience. Breakfast, rice noodles, bread, salad and co**** grains are all nutritious and healthy. In Miao Village, where the transportation is not very convenient, it is very attentive and rich! Generally speaking, when I came to Qianhu Miao Village this time, I felt the comfort of life and the sincerity and enthusiasm of the hotel staff!

Only after I stayed in did I realize that there is no view at all, and the windows are also very small. I can only see the walls and roof of the hotel next door. Half of the windows are blocked by vegetation. When I open the door, I can only see the hotel yard and a small road. The hotel bed looks like a small hotel, and the quilt is a bit damp. The room looks The clothes are also very old, full of sense of age, and the sound insulation effect is poor
2. The hotel is quite expensive, the same price as a five-star hotel in the urban area, but the hotel's service can't keep up with it at all. I read the reviews and said that there is a staff member to pick me up, but I didn't go there at all. I called and told me to go there by myself. The scenic spot It's very devious. It took me half an hour to find the hotel. I was dragging a big box and walking on the gravel road on a hot day. I was so tired that I was sweating profusely. I had no sense of experience at all.

服務：服務 優秀！酒店下單後立馬有管家對接 管家詳細解答了景區各項細節 關鍵是獨自出行沒有人拍照店長耐心幫忙拍了很多照片 還有專業的相機和打光燈一個人來這裏 真的沒問題🆗
酒店酒吧：大堂吧有室內和室外 晚上有提供免費的飲料 隨便拿
禮賓：入住/退房 都有人提行李來回小北門
酒店不足：有蜘蛛！晚上睡覺前遇到了大的黑蜘蛛在床邊的牆上 關鍵沒打死真的會嚇得睡不着 洗澡前發現沒有洗浴用品 凌晨2點50分發消息萬幸酒店立刻有人送來
服務是超出預期👍如果不是酒店衞生髮生問題不然將是一次完美的體驗
請店方加強客房清潔力度雖然有苗寨客觀因素但蜘蛛還是不能接受的

到的時候傍晚開始下大雨，酒店工作人員（小王）小哥哥冒雨來接我們，提行李上坡。
酒店位置觀景視野好，乾淨衞生環境美，飲料水果自助，所有工作人員態度超好。
早餐粉兒比外面的好吃，想念ing
離開的時候小王小龔同學幫忙把行李送到北大門。

第二天晚上回到酒店，就看到小潘在生火説準備晚上烤肉大餐，説這烤肉箱今天才拿回來，想試試。原本想着是他們員工內部的烤肉大餐，結果沒過多久他和小蘭超級熱情地跑到房間來邀請我們一起去吃，他們準備了好多吃的…主打就是一個吃肉撐到嗓子眼兒，小潘還特意為我們準備了他們當地的米酒，説一定要讓我們嚐嚐。這天晚上正好是520，小蘭説還給我們準備了520的伴手禮😭
關鍵來了，所有以上我提到的全程都是他們自掏腰包來招待我們哦，真的***感動😭（以上名字如有打錯字的話，還請你們見諒哦，我也沒過多詢問具體是哪幾個字兒😆）
最後真想實名at酒店老闆，一定不惜一切代價好好對待他們四位，好好犒勞他們😭

msg:西江民宿千千萬，唯獨他家屬最贊！

西江千户苗寨因為其特殊的地理環境限制，住宿問題一直被很多網友們詬病——小！舊！破！隔音差……所以，在預訂之初，我始終忐忑不安，恐怕會在此經歷一場噩夢

後來，在同事及很多當地朋友都強烈安利下，我選擇了位於半山腰的千户行者上居酒店。酒店分兩家獨立樓棟，都在從四號風雨橋穿過，沿着小路向山上前行的途中

一處叫得月樓，在路邊，未到半山腰處。走過一段曲徑通幽的小橋，即可見一棟古色古香的木質別院。場地有限，房間偏小，顯得侷促。不過，麻雀雖小，五臟俱全。該有的基本硬件設施都有，軟件服務也不錯——熱情有禮

一處叫千户樓，位於半山腰，沒有明顯標識，不容易尋找到，必須穿過一些破舊不堪的民房才能抵達。但是，當你苦苦尋覓到，再哼哧哼哧地爬上三樓，步入大堂，寬闊的露台所帶來的視野開闊，儼然會讓你覺得一切一切的辛苦都是值得的！上什麼景區的觀景台啊！這裏，足矣！美哉

説實話，房間也不是很大很大的那種，但是在西江這塊寸土寸金的地方，已然誠意滿滿！尤其坐在房間的小陽台上，泡上一壺雷山銀球，一邊喝一邊看遠處炊煙裊裊，夕落星升，那份愜意或許就是來西江的意義所在吧

可能西江民宿太多，所以內卷相當厲害！這家酒店似乎也不甘落於人後，不僅提供免費搬運行李服務，水果飲料小食更是可以無限暢吃，管家小姐姐小蘭做的泡魯達更是好美好好吃

最後，我必須狠狠地點名表揚這家店的幾名員工！我們的行李很多很重，靦腆的小王帥哥，戴眼鏡的一位小哥哥，還有一位肌肉滿滿的小哥哥，還有一位話不多的小哥哥，超級給力！幫我們老老少少扛上拎下，跑前跑後

還有，一位戴眼鏡的管家小姐姐始終温柔地向我介紹着這片她熱愛且熟悉的地方——西江

正是這樣的一羣年輕人，用他們的朝氣、真誠、熱情、努力，全心全意地服務着住店的每一位客人，盡心盡力地做着自己的這一份工，即使老闆不在家，也沒有倦怠，沒有偷懶，沒有抱怨……感謝他們帶給我的這份超級棒的入住體驗！正是因為他們的辛苦付出，我心甘情願為他們寫下這篇點評！為千户行者上居酒店打call！

msg:景區裏的酒店，所以進入費了點勁兒，預約門票我預約了，我家爸爸沒預約上，所以付了90塊錢門票。到了之後有個四樓的榻榻米房間空出來了，店家幫我們免費升級了一下，窗景無敵，夜景和日出都可以在被窩裡看。酒店是老房子，那些老柱子還在，走路也需要輕一點，一直提醒孩子別跑。房間裏給準備了兩瓶泉水，很有趣，有特色，我們都競相品嚐，雖然剛開始還不確定。
不足之處呢，房間裏忘記了放拖鞋，和管家説，然後送來一雙布拖，問説沒有可以洗澡穿的拖鞋，光腳洗澡，孩子覺得剛進去有點涼，不像家裡浴室有墊子。一次性沐浴用品裏的沐浴液不是全新的，封條被拆開過。
早餐很簡單，但是食材很好，挺好吃的，地瓜玉米都很甜。可能我們比較早，咖啡機裏沒有咖啡豆，做飯的阿姨也不會用，所以我們在寨子裏的咖啡店買的咖啡。提供的水是Panna的，兩個娃每人拿了一個。
總體來説，應該是設計的服務理念不錯，品牌感在的，就是某些小細節能更關注就更好啦 ！

還是提一點建議：房間燈光其實不太夠，有一點暗哈；早餐份量不太夠我老公；還有房費2400多還是有一點虛高，心裏感覺1500-1800左右哈

房間：整潔、衞生是做到了的。

服務：感覺得到服務人員是希望顧客住的滿意的，熱情的幫助顧客解決問題。小蘭和小賴兩位姑娘幫着運送行李箱、提供水果熱飲。

苗寨裏的居住條件和大中城市相比存在差距，不能有過高的期望。總體而言，這家酒店在有限的條件下還是做的可以的，服務人員也在努力去做好，還算不錯的。

msg:環境：風景挺好的，房間內設施也還行，缺點是可能由於原建築的原因，房間層高特別矮，伸手就能碰到房頂那種（我身高160），還有就是走路樓板會很響，我能聽見樓上的，想必樓下的也能聽見我的。

服務：除了餐廳外，每一個工作人員都非常温柔友好，也會主動詢問住客有什麼小需要。

最後來講講我在餐廳的經歷吧。
在我的主動詢問下得知早餐時間是8:00～10:00。在我過去的經歷裏，10點意味着收餐、不能再取餐了。於是我9:53從房間出發去往得月樓，其間酒店前台、餐廳前台的工作人員（和前一天入住時行者樓/樂居樓是同一位）都非常友好地給我打了招呼，隨後我進入餐廳，問餐廳內的工作人員是否可以隨便坐，得到允許後我於9:58落座，此時餐廳除了我以外衹有兩位客人，我巡視一圈並沒有取餐的地方也沒有工作人員上前詢問我。10:02分，我主動詢問工作人員得知“我們下班了”（此時還有其他住客在用餐），我問還可以給我一份早餐嗎她同意了，隨後她去到後廚，非常大聲地模仿我説話“可以給我一份早餐嗎”並且伴隨方言吐槽（沒聽懂她具體如何吐槽的）。再之後，給我端來了一份白粥、一份粗糧、一份沙拉，我有説“我要白粥就可以了”，但是她仍然全部給我了，此時我才意識到早餐是配餐制。隨後她又給我端來了一份粉/麪，我謝絕了，她説“那你怎麼不早説”，我説“我又不知道有這個”，於是她把粉/麪端回後廚並伴隨第二次的模仿我説話+吐槽，音量比第一次還大。
我知道踩點這個習慣很不好，但是我踩上了，就算沒踩上我也不會有怨言。但是這位大姐的行為和態度是什麼意思呢？嘴巴長來不會好好溝通衹會學顧客説話+吐槽顧客是吧，還是當面那種，生怕我聽不見？這種行為已經是挑釁了。一大把年紀的人了，火氣不要那麼大，平靜一點對血壓好。

總的來説，是比較滿意的一次住宿經歷，除了餐廳的插曲外都很舒服。就是價格有一點點過高，1500的水平吧（在今年暑期瘋狂溢價的情況下）

親身入住體驗，絕絕子～
提前就聯繫，把我們出發的每一步都做成路線這一點真的不要太貼心。不僅如此，到景區以後怕路線不熟悉還親自過來接我們，因為沒吃午飯，還帶我們去吃飯，推薦的飯店菜品也很棒。
因為到得早，酒店的雪琴（是個超級好看的小姐姐）還特意陪我們出去逛，還給我們講解了很多苗寨的歷史，很用心。
晚上在酒店的露台坐了會兒，太愜意了吧，景色也很棒，一開始來的時候覺得都一樣，聽雪琴講完以後我們放棄爬觀景台，選擇在露台跟她喝茶聊天。
早餐也很好吃，以至於忘記拍照了～

Ps:一定要加雪琴小姐姐的微信，她不經意間還給我和我對象拍了一些特別珍貴的圖片，感謝🙏，她的朋友圈也很絕，這個視頻就是她朋友圈偷的。

一定還會再來的。
