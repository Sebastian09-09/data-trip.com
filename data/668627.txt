Hot spring ticket for two: You can enter unlimited times if you stay in the hotel, but it is not open the next morning. It will not open until 1 pm. If you stay for one night, unlimited times is a pity

Special thanks to the supervisor at the service desk, who was serious, careful, and patient in helping our group of 9 people. The room in Building 2 is not only large in size, but also has a balcony, where you can see the rain and fog in the distant mountains, which is very beautiful.

msg:Yichun is not well-known in Sichuan. I accidentally saw a short video and immediately planned this three-day vacation. I thought that it would miss the holidays and the hot spring bathing season in winter... Because I didn't understand it at all, I booked the flight and stayed there. Confused about which hotel to choose‚Ä¶
In the end, I was quite nervous and chose this hotel, but the room I wanted to choose the most was no longer available. Initially, I wanted to have a separate bathing pool. It was best not to be in the bathroom, otherwise it would feel the same as a bathtub. I also wanted a balcony. The room makes it feel like a vacation... I left a message to the hotel on the platform, and if a relevant room type comes out, please contact me to change it... I didn't have high hopes for it, but the front desk staff contacted me on the morning of check-in and kept it. A room, let me see it after arriving at the store and then decide!
After checking out the rooms at the hotel, I decisively upgraded to the executive pool suite! highly recommended! The floors are high, the rooms are large, and the zoning is reasonable. There is a balcony next to the swimming pool, and it is separated from the bedroom. It will not be too humid. The sink is large, and the shower and toilet are large... I have seen netizens say that the hotel is relatively old.
In fact, a hotel is not afraid of aging; I had expected that a hotel in the mountains would not be very good at keeping up with the climate. As a result, the overall maintenance of the room was very good. Although the new decoration style was not trendy enough, the overall equipment and facilities were not outdated at all, which shows that the daily management is still in place... The hot water comes out very quickly. I soak in it every day. It‚Äôs so comfortable. I don‚Äôt have to go to the public hot spring pool at all...
The bedding is also good and very comfortable
Food delivery service is fast and tastes good
The breakfast is very surprising, it's more Chinese style, the noodles are delicious, there are many kinds and the taste is good...
The gym opens at 7 o'clock. The equipment is not new, but it is sufficient... There are also table tennis and squash... and it's big! The environment is also good
Recommended!

When I went to the hot springs at night, there were a lot of foreign objects in some pools, such as hair and dead skin. You need to buy a swimming cap to play in the swimming pool (this is not the point). The point is that if you bring your own swimming cap to swim, the lifeguard will obviously have a bad tone!

Because only 30 seconds of video can be uploaded, I can only take screenshots for everyone to see. The total length is 7 minutes. The video not only shows the dirty sanitary environment of a 5-star hotel, but also reflects the professionalism of the hotel staff. Shirking responsibility shows no sincerity in solving the problem. There were not only fur, hair (you can imagine what kind of hair it is), dander, black and green unknown dirt, but also fallen mosaic tiles in the pool. There are fingernail shells left by previous hotel guests on the floor, a layer of dust on the body of the lotion bottle in the bathroom, the hotel charger on the bedside table, and the power grid is also covered in dust... Is this just what the hotel manager said "maybe it's service" Didn‚Äôt the staff clean it up?‚Äù Could this be the dust accumulated over the day? Hair? Dander? Unknown dirt? I would like to ask the hotel, have you fulfilled your basic obligations? Have your management systems been implemented? Is there a health inspection and supervision mechanism? Is it also just talk on paper? Your crisis public relations skills are so poor! Is your full sincerity only reflected in collecting money? What is the conscience of your hotel? The room fee is more than 2,000 yuan, and the sanitary condition is like this? ! After negotiating with the hotel to no avail and proposing to resolve it through complaints, the hotel just proposed to send two hot spring tickets as the final way to solve the problem? ! If the room pool is so filthy, how can the hygiene of the public hot spring pool be guaranteed? ! All travelers, please keep your eyes open. Once you stay in such a hotel, what kind of harm will it cause to your body and mind? ! It‚Äôs unknown what kind of diseases you might contract?

The layout of the room is a bit unreasonable. The downstairs of the duplex has a 1.5-meter bed and the upper-floor is 1.8 meters, which makes the space upstairs very crowded. And when the wooden stairs go up and down, the stairs vibrate with the screen baffle upstairs, which is very noisy.
The hot springs are not bad, but some of the pools are not open, I don't know why. New bath towels cannot be replaced near the pools on the mountain. Fortunately, the weather is hot. If it is cold, you will catch a cold with soaked bath towels.
The hotel has a good environment, but there are still many shortcomings in details. Hope it will be better.
