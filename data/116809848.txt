msg:Stayed at the Rensheng Hotel in Banna. It is located on the top of the mountain. The mountain is very cool and the scenery is also very good. The whole hotel is high-end, quiet and private. 😍All rooms are stand-alone with outdoor swimming pools. The rooms are also surrounded by various tropical plants. It really feels like living in the jungle. In the evening, you can swim while watching the sunset. You can also overlook the Xishuangbanna city and the Xingguang Night Market. You will know how romantic this feeling is only after you stay here. 💕 - The hotel is a little far from the city. But it provides meals, coffee and drinks. The view of the restaurant is beautiful. It feels like a cliff restaurant. You can go to the restaurant in the afternoon. You can have a drink here and relax.
You can enjoy the sunset in the evening.
The food is fusion cuisine, and the taste is quite good.
📷After dinner, you can go back to the room to take pictures.
The infinity pool is paired with the sunset.
It is really beautiful.
The next day, I woke up to see the whole mountain view.
The breakfast is also very exquisite.
-
The room is very large and the supporting facilities are very complete.
The toiletries are of good quality.
💿The most surprising thing is that there is a record player to listen to music.
The hotel staff are also very patient and enthusiastic.
You will not be bored staying here all day.
It is so comfortable that you can forget all your worries.
💯

msg:I have been to Xishuangbanna four or five times. This time I chose the newly opened Xiye Hotel in Xishuangbanna. The flight was delayed and it was past midnight when we landed in Xishuangbanna. The hotel thoughtfully arranged a pick-up service. They also prepared midnight snacks and fruits for us. It was too dark at night and I couldn’t see the hotel environment clearly. The next day, when I opened the French window, I was completely amazed by the view outside the window. I felt like I was in a tropical rain forest. Listening to the cicadas and birds singing in a room surrounded by scenery. Watching the scenery outside the window brought a good mood. Located on the top of Nanlian Mountain, it is a rare quiet place. You can overlook the entire night view of Xishuangbanna. The extremely private single-family villa is equipped with a private swimming pool. Let me start my perfect vacation~

From the front desk to the cleaning lady, the service was perfect. The room service was online 24 hours a day. The room hardware and software were very good!!! The swimming pool was cleaned by staff every day, so there was no need to worry about it being dirty. The check-in experience was really great! ! Next time I come to Banna, I must choose Xiye!

msg:This is my fifth time in Xishuangbanna. This time I stayed at VINVANA•Hidden World. This B&B was newly opened this year. The hardware facilities and decoration are great. Banna has high temperatures all year round. The B&B is located on the mountain, and the mountain breeze is particularly obvious, which is the most unique experience of my stay this time. The mountain breeze will bring coolness to the hot weather. When the wind blows, the whole mountain forest rustles, which is a good interpretation of the fact that the wind is free and so is breathing. The whole B&B is in a secluded and quiet environment, which is particularly comfortable. The B&B overlooks the entire Xishuangbanna. The 270-degree floor-to-ceiling windows and panoramic rooms make it so romantic to watch the sunset and sunrise. There are not many rooms in the B&B, but each one is an exquisite stand-alone building with a private swimming pool and basin hall. The private space is great and soundproof and quiet, especially at night, when you can quietly hear the symphony of nature in the garden. The private butler is very responsible and attentive. He will contact you the day before arrival to arrange pick-up and drop-off. All your problems can be solved in the WeChat group in the most timely manner. All iced drinks in the room Mini bar are free, and there is a fruit platter. The butler will also deliver hot soup to the room in the evening. The toiletries are all very classic international five-star hotel facilities. Because I personally pay attention to the amount of water and hot and cold showers, I like to have enough hot water showers. I am also very satisfied with the experience here. There is also a phonograph in the room that can play music or connect to Bluetooth. This is very unique. Everyone must not forget to experience it. The sound quality is very good! In terms of catering, Chinese food is currently the main food. The dishes have local characteristics and taste good. The whole plating decoration is also very good. Breakfast is a buffet breakfast with many categories. In short, the feeling of staying here this time is very relaxing. It is very suitable for vacation travel. The service quality of the B&B is also impeccable. The warm feeling of home. The fusion of nature and B&B will make you gain many impressive and beautiful memories during your stay. I strongly recommend it to everyone! As the saying goes: Return from the hustle and bustle of the city into the sunset!

The service is also very considerate~ It rained heavily on the day of check-in, but they still sent welcome fruits and good night sweet soup to the room in the rain. Every time they saw us in the park, they would ask if there was anything they needed and if they wanted to help~

It is said that it was opened this year, so the single-family villas here look very new, and the environment is so comfortable. I will bring my friends to see the sea of ​​clouds next time~

msg:Hidden in the mountains and on the edge of the clouds, the dreamlike sunrise and sunset, every scene is soul-stirring.
When staying in a B&B, you can't just look at the good reviews, you have to look at the bad reviews. I've seen too many photo-deceptions, and this B&B exceeds expectations! The environment, service, linens, and toiletries are all carefully designed. The taste and environment of the restaurant are very good. I personally don't like the bustling feeling of the night market. I ate in the hotel for two days when I came to Banna. It's life to relax.
If you have to make some comments and suggestions: 1. The weather in Banna is hot. If you know the approximate check-in time of the room, it is recommended to turn on the air conditioner half an hour in advance. 2. The air conditioner is the only thing I want to complain about... It's really a bit loud when it runs, even if you turn on the mute and sleep mode, and adjust the air volume to the smallest gear. Toshiba's air conditioner is not good. I hope to find an engineer to take a look.
When a homestay has good service, human touch, and hardware facilities, it will definitely be a highlight and memorable point in your trip. If you come to Banna again, you will still choose Xiye. Mountains and seas have their own return dates, and wind and rain will meet again. I wish that "Xiye", built on the mountain, will shine brightly in the mountains and fields🌹

msg:The hotel is great. My friend recommended it to me. As a hotel lover, I want to stay in any newly opened hotel. This time, my friend and I stayed for two nights. It was great👍
The entire resort hotel is made up of houses, which cured all my obsessive-compulsive disorder. The design is very modern.
The terrace where we stayed has a circular swimming pool, which is super beautiful. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery of Banna while swimming.
The hotel has achieved the ultimate aesthetics. The glass in the living room and bedroom are all made of large floor-to-ceiling windows. There is no obstruction. The whole house smart system makes the room warm, especially when you go to bed at 12 o'clock at night, you can enjoy the lights of the night view of Banna city disappearing little by little. Waking up at the top of the mountain is a great feeling👍
It is worth mentioning that the toiletries are actually packed in a hotel-customized cosmetic bag. The toothpaste is all medium, which is very considerate and warm~
The bedding is very comfortable, and the whole color design is very warm. It uses Morandi color matching and mixes orange + red, which is very holiday🏖️
You can go to the terrace of the restaurant to enjoy dinner in the evening. The sunset a**osphere is full and romantic~

msg:Xiye Banna is a high-quality, luxurious, independent hotel hidden in the rainforest of Xishuangbanna. The butler service and the dishes are really good👍; their hotel is located on the top of the Nanlian Mountain, where you can enjoy the night view of the city and the starry sky. In the dining a**osphere of the hotel restaurant, the full sense of happiness comes from the quiet and soft night, which makes people feel comfortable and romantic. The environment is very good!
The chef of the restaurant is said to have worked in Black Pearl. We ordered several of their specialties carefully, and we were not disappointed. We gave a thumbs up on the spot👍
In Banna with a temperature of 38 degrees, we didn’t feel very hot in the evening on the mountain. It was still very comfortable when a breeze blew! Walk through the internal passage to the private courtyard, enter the room and open the door to see a large plate of fruit and two bowls of sweet soup. The service is so warm.
At night, I was talking to my friends about the owner of this store who understands the importance of teeth. The hotel is equipped with imported COCOAIMEE brand classic mint toothpaste, which is 45g. It turns out that travelers need a high-quality toothpaste to save their mouths from the sweet and sour taste after eating a lot.
Facilities: A new hotel with complete and new facilities. Don't worry about it not being easy to use.

msg:The hotel has just opened for more than a month, and it feels like all the staff are working hard to serve customers and win praise. From airport pick-up, to welcome coffee and fruit plate, to night desserts, to early group communication, to farewell snacks, to luggage delivery, it is simply 100 points of service.
I went on vacation alone, and the others were small families, but I didn't feel neglected at all. I was upgraded to a 270° view deluxe room halfway, which was very thoughtful.
The high-end brand hotels in Banna are too old and have no service. It is really a good choice to choose this homestay. On Nanlian Mountain, you can see the night view of Gaozhuang but it is far away from the hustle and bustle, and you can enjoy the swimming pool.
The hotel fleet is also great. I have contacted three drivers before and after, and they all gave you a detailed introduction to the service and thoughtfulness, which made me understand a lot about Banna culture.
The handsome guy at the front desk is also very supportive, thank you

msg:This time I came to Xishuangbanna for vacation, and stayed at Wanda, Intercontinental, Bodu, Jianglu, and I can say that Xiye is the ceiling of Banna vacation! 😆
First of all, the hotel has a very advantageous location. It is not far from the city center, about 30 minutes by car, but it has a sense of tranquility in the wilderness, and you can overlook Xishuangbanna.
🌃The wild luxury vacation experience is simply full. Each room is a stand-alone with a swimming pool, and the view is very good, which is much better than Wanda, which is also a villa.
❤️The hotel's facilities are basically all super first-line brands, Duravit toilets, and designer furniture sofas. It's hard not to love them, hahahaha
There is also the hotel's restaurant environment, the taste is also very good, and the view is really very good. There is a feeling of overlooking all living things on the mountains and fields, hahahahaha.
The hotel butler service is very good and considerate. It was very smooth to carry luggage and check in along the way, and it was on call.
Overall, whether it is from the convenience of location, decoration design, the size of the room, and the view, it can be said to be the ceiling hotel in Banna. This price can be said to be very cost-effective! I really recommend it and will come again next time.

雖然衹住了一晚吧 但是真的很舒服很治癒
雨後清晨自然的味道 喚醒了我開啟新一天的能量
吹吹山林的微風 看看窗外的大自然 
真切的感受到我真的一個人出來了 離開了那喧鬧的街道和急躁的生活 能享受就享受吧 
傍晚的日落晚霞 在天空禮堂和泳池邊與日落相伴 與天空一起入夜 喝點飲料 戴上耳機 極致的放空 
哈哈哈滿足了 這一趟很治癒 也會再來的！！
各種設施環境衞生服務就不用説了
很到位 也很熱情 讓我享受孤獨的同時感受了温暖

msg:坐落在西雙版納山頂的夕野VINVANA隱世度假酒店，簡直是我們這次帶娃出遊的完美髮現！每棟豪華獨立別墅不僅私密性滿分，內部空間超大，設施也是一流的，讓我和家裡的小寶貝都超級享受。整個酒店風景美呆了，每一個角落都能拍出大片來，我和寶貝的朋友圈都得瑟滿了！

孩子最愛酒店的室外泳池，水質清澈又安全，他能在那兒玩上整天，偶爾抬頭就能捕捉到那絕美的日落景色。真的，這裏不衹是孩子的樂園，對於想要放鬆的我們大人來説也太合適了。想給家人一個難忘的假期！夕野VINVANA絕對是個不二之選！

首先酒店是新開的 裝修 設施都很新。
因為喜歡住安靜的地方 所以沒有選擇在夜市附近 
入住前還會電話詢問你住宿的喜好 最最最想誇的就是酒店的工作人員都超級nice，永遠都是笑眯眯的 十分熱情的幫忙抬行李 
房間內一次性的用品很齊全質量也很棒，床品也很乾凈舒適。
