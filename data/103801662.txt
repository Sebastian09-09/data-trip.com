The breakfast was decent, it would have been better if it could go a little later at the weekend.

They had good coffee at the executive lounge, but starting only at 10am, so most days I couldn’t get some.

The bed and room was very comfortable.

Furthermore the hotel should crack down at people smoking at its premises especially since they are a non smoking hotel. The staff was very helpful when alerted them about this issue so that’s a plus however we only stayed one night.

2. The hotel staff is very good (Huang Changtian). Knowing that my feet were blistered, they brought me band-aids and prepared wormwood foot baths. They also prepared rain boots for rainy days, and provided coffee, snacks, and fruits to guests for free... It is a very heartwarming hotel. I will continue to stay next time I come to Guangzhou!

Although there is air conditioning, the glass of the preferential room we booked faces the mall. Assuming that the window can be opened, it may not be breathable, because it is not facing the outside. I blame myself for not paying attention to it in advance.

You can watch many free channels on TV.
The selected room has windows that can be opened but is very close to the building opposite, so the curtains need to be closed for a long time.
The laundry room is on the same floor. The washing machine is clean and hangers and laundry bags are provided.
The refrigerator is not cold enough and does not dissipate heat well. You have to open the cabinet for a long time to dissipate heat before it gets colder.

The surrounding a**osphere is very rich, with many delicious food and time-honored shops. It is very convenient for traveling and finding food. And the hotel has its own parking space, which is very friendly to friends who drive by themselves. On the first floor of the hotel, there is KFC on the left, Taotaoju on the right, with Starbucks and Naixue Tea in the back. There is a Sichuan restaurant on the second floor. There is also a delicious wonton noodles opposite the hotel. There is also a Diand Dode about 500 meters away from the hotel. It has everything you need! The hotel's location is close to Huachenghui Square and Canton Tower. It is very convenient for a night tour of the Pearl River. It is very convenient to travel by subway or taxi. There is a "robot worker" in the lobby who can take the elevator to deliver food by himself. The butler AD provides very good service. He always pays attention to my needs and really responds to my requests. The only regret I have about this trip to Guangzhou is that it happened to rain for the past two days, so I couldn’t have a good time. Fortunately, Guangxi is not far from Guangzhou. I can’t check out the scenic spots and food for my next trip. If you come to Guangzhou again, you will still choose Wanguo Yuanbao Hotel!

But the room is really average, the sound insulation is very poor, and the conversation in the next room can be heard clearly. Maybe my expectations for Ctrip's Five Diamonds are too high, and I feel it's still far behind traditional five-star hotels.

msg:I suggested that the manager give me a VIP, because it was my first time to receive a five-star review, and I highly recommend it, especially after experiencing the terrible hotel on the first night. After comparing it, I felt that this place is simply great! The room is big enough at 25 square meters, unlike some that are rated 25 square meters, which is only a dozen square meters. The location is simply too good. There is a subway station more than 200 meters from the door, which is convenient to go everywhere. The room is very new, but the decoration style is a bit vulgar. affect aesthetics. The most convenient thing is that the lobby on the first floor is Taotaoju. It is 700 meters away from the hotel. The price is too good. The disadvantage is that it is a bit close to the residential building and has little privacy. You can only hang gauze curtains. Next time Will stay here again

The subway 🚇Line 5 is about 300 meters away. The hotel has complete facilities and equipment, including a gym. There are super large equipments for all kinds of sports. There is also a sauna and steam room in the locker room. I love it so much. There are restaurants on the first and second floors. Taotaoju’s opening discounts are pretty good. There are also gourmet restaurants near the hotel. There are a lot of places to eat and drink, and it’s super convenient. The staff, AD Ca, and the room lady and concierge service are pretty good. Booking a hotel package will give you better value for money!

msg:This is my first time writing a review, and I am so angry that I have to write it.
I am a Ctrip platinum member. Four words: Don’t! live! this! inside!

The hotel is under quarantine and is repairing the subway. When I checked in, the front desk had clearly informed me that the renovation would start at 8 a.m. So I woke up really early in the morning and it was already very noisy at 8 o'clock.
Just when you were about to fall asleep, the hotel phone rang. It was around 11 o'clock in the morning. I thought to myself that I didn't have enough time to check out. What emergency could wake me up? Here comes the weird one:

The front desk clerk hesitated for a long time, saying that they needed to replace the shower head, and asked me if I would mind if a colleague from the engineering team came in to take a photo.
***I became angry instantly. Isn’t this too baffling? Has the hotel conducted staff training?
I checked out at 12 o'clock and can I take pictures again after the guest leaves?
Construction is already going on next to your guests, who are already resting badly. Do you still want to make another phone call to harass them?
Aren't shower heads purchased uniformly across the hotel? Can't you take pictures of other empty rooms?


The staff of these hotels, which cost more than 700 yuan a night, provide absolutely **** service and even call themselves five-star hotels. I will never come here in the future, and I will do my best to tell my friends not to come!

I have never encountered such a disgusting hotel! I wish you a good business!

msg:Overall: For a family trip, the family members said that the price-performance ratio was average. It was an enhanced version of a chain hotel with average environmental facilities and services. The hygiene was good. The breakfast was not delicious. It had no characteristics of Cantonese cuisine and the variety was pitiful.
Environment: The door of the room is very soundproof and lightproof. The corridor was noisy from 23:00 to 0:00 for two consecutive nights, and the hotel management did not stop it until the customer couldn't bear it and called to complain. The light isolation is also very poor. There is serious light leakage from the crack of the lower door of the room, and it becomes bright when the lights are turned off.
Facilities: The room's air conditioning control and various button controls are anti-human. If you don't get out of bed for a long time, you won't be able to complete some of the simplest operations. The outermost part of the curtain cannot be opened, and the inner side operations are speechless, such as the master control. As soon as I opened it, the curtain automatically stuck, scaring my wife half to death.
Service: The only things worthy of praise are the waiter at the gate and the food delivery robot. These two are responsible for their duties. The others are no different from transparent people. The breakfast waiters are even more outrageous, like a group of outsourced people.

msg:Booked a hotel on the last day in Guangzhou. It seems that it has only been open for a year, and the equipment is indeed very new.

Room facilities:
The room is not large in size, but the furnishings are complete and relatively new. The design of the restroom is relatively new. The bathroom and toilet are on both sides of the sink, and the shower room is large. The curtains are electric which is very convenient.

Value for money:
Taking into account the comfort, the surrounding environment and the fact that it is a new hotel, the price-performance ratio of less than 700/night is relatively high.

wifi:
high speed.

bed:
It is very comfortable. The height of the bed is relatively high. The softness is soft but the support is good. It has a wrapping feeling. I slept well at night.

health:
Very clean and tidy with impeccable hygiene.

parking:
The hotel has an underground parking lot, but the number of parking spaces seems to be limited.

Room view:
It is relatively average. The hotel is located in the Zhujiang New Town area. It feels like the surrounding area is mostly in the old city. The view outside the window is the old city + downtown, nothing special.

Location transportation:
The surrounding area is very popular, and it is easy to find places to eat. You can also walk about a kilometer to the Guangzhou Bridge and see the night view of the Pearl River and Canton Tower. However, since the neighborhood is mostly populated by downtown neighborhoods in the old city, traffic jams are relatively easy.

Serve:
All the services expected of a hotel of this level are provided.

There are many restaurants nearby: Xingfu Mingdian, Yinji Rice Roll, and Jiulong Ice Room are all delicious. The lobby design is also nice, and you can take beautiful photos. It’s a hotel worth returning to!

msg:Before the end of the summer vacation, Mr. He and his 3 daughters traveled from Hong Kong to Guangzhou and Shenzhen for 5 days and 4 nights. During the period, they stayed in 3 hotels. Before coming to Guangzhou, I checked many hotels on the Internet and saw many 5-star and good reviews. Content, I decided to choose this Wanguo Yuanbao Hotel. The decoration of the whole hotel is very high-end and clean. The check-in at the front desk is also very fast, and the staff are polite and friendly. Free coffee, juice and fruit snacks are provided in the underground lobby at 10:00 in the morning. There is a faint fragrance in the corridor on the floor. The room is neat and clean. The supplies are complete. The area is not very large but it is sufficient. The air-conditioning and washing water pressure are sufficient. I heard that some rooms have smart toilets, but the toilet in our room is not. In addition, I I want to praise the hotel. Maybe when I checked in, the front desk staff knew that one of my daughters was taller. After we checked in, I found that the cleaning lady had put the cleaning supplies and towels of the three daughters in the bathroom before we came to the room. Slippers are given according to the height and size of the three children, which is really considerate. Coincidentally, the day before in a hotel in Shenzhen, I was unhappy with the small matter of asking children to wash supplies, so when I saw that Yuanbao Hotel had prepared these supplies for me, I was really touched, very pleasantly surprised, and admired the efficiency of the hotel, because it took less than 10 minutes to get the room card, wait for the coffee, and then take the elevator to the room!
We live on the 3rd floor, and there may be a lot of guests during the summer vacation. Every time we go out, no matter whether we come back at 2:00 in the morning or late at night, there will be guests coming in and out, but fortunately, the sound insulation of the room is very good.
The cleaning aunts all smile and greet each other kindly. There is also a gym on the third floor. The gym is very large, with a lot of fitness equipment and a yoga room. There are yoga mats and yoga balls. There is also a place to wash exercises in the gym. Dry and wet steam room, but we don't have time to use it. I like the massage chair in the gym the most, but there is only one. It is difficult to wait during the evening peak hours. It is recommended to go to the gym after breakfast in the morning. There is no one. There are 24-hour laundry rooms and dryers on the 5th floor, but many people wash them. Breakfast In the underground, the variety of food is acceptable. I don’t know if it is often leaked when someone pours the juice. After two days of breakfast, I found that there was juice in the juice area underground, which made my feet sticky. I didn’t see a coffee spoon next to the coffee. , In addition, the husband is not used to the hotel rice noodles. He said that the rice noodles are too thick and the soup has no taste.

The hotel is considered to be very cost-effective nearby. I have stayed in four hotels around, and the Yuanbao Hotel has the best value for money.
The room is relatively large compared to the surrounding areas. It is newly decorated. It is not only clean and hygienic, but the service is very good. The staff in the store are very enthusiastic. Not only is hot tea provided during check-in, but there is also free coffee and snacks downstairs.
They helped us upgrade the room type during both stays, and once it was a suite. It was not too cost-effective. On the day of check-out, they offered to postpone our check-out until 2 pm, but because we had a full schedule, we checked out in the morning.
Overall, it is a clean, cost-effective hotel with considerate service.
I will stay here again next time I come to Guangzhou and will recommend it to my friends.
Also thank you AD Calcium for your considerate service. A very pleasant trip.

msg:First of all, this is definitely not a five-star hotel, just an ordinary business hotel that is a little better than a Seven Days Express Hotel! It is very unreasonable to list five stars and five diamonds on Ctrip! Second, the hotel is newly renovated, and the smell of formaldehyde is still very strong. After sleeping all night, I had a sore throat, cough, and phlegm. Although the hotel said that the formaldehyde must not exceed the standard, I also believed it, but it was uncomfortable, and I was sure that no one would die. of! Thirdly, I can tolerate the price of 658 and the room of 20 square meters, but what I can't bear is that it has an internal window that cannot be opened and there is no view. Of course, the hotel agreed to upgrade me to a room with a window, but the hotel said that the room with the window faced the road and was very noisy, so it was up to me if I didn't mind. So, no change! Suffering from formaldehyde all night! Fourth, the sound insulation of the hotel is extremely bad. I hung up the sign of Do Not Disturb, just because I was afraid that someone would disturb me in the morning, but the waiter knocked on the door of the next door and the opposite room one by one early in the morning, and they could hear it clearly. The hotel has no sound insulation at all. In other words, it is easy for this kind of problem to happen when an old hotel is renovated into a new one! Fifth, the way the hotel staff handles the problem is also extremely inappropriate. If you don’t deal with the problem, you will just blame it. Manager Yang, I am convinced by the way you handle the problem. If you say that your leader does not give you rights, then You can only blame yourself for not having a reliable leader. The final suggestion for everyone is to either stay in a business hotel like Atour that costs 400 to 500 RMB, or stay in a true 5-star hotel with RMB 1,000 or more, such as Rosewood Four Seasons. Don't be like me, looking for cheap, spending 700 yuan to stay in this old and renovated shabby hotel, I really regret it! I hope this review can help everyone avoid lightning and stay away from this hotel! If one day the price of this hotel drops to two to three hundred, you can still stay there!

There is free parking in the hotel. There are not many places in the ba*****t, but we can still enjoy free parking. Geography The location is unique, and it is convenient to go anywhere, because it is very convenient to eat, drink, and have fun because it is close to Tianhe. From the moment you enter the hotel gate, you can experience the visual impact of the decoration. The concierge staff in white shirts carry luggage, and the housekeeper, Ms. Li Yashan, is enthusiastic Greetings, service is really good! The room is clean, tidy and well-equipped. It can be seen that the service and facilities have been worked hard, and the gym is also good. Even if you don’t exercise often, there is a sauna room to relax. It has all the introductions in the package! The price is worth it compared to the quality and service!

The overall service is very considerate. There is also free coffee and fruit in the lobby. I have stayed in many hotels, and I think it is a good one. Here is a small suggestion. The entrance of the hotel parking lot is a bit small, and there is no direct elevator, but the impact is not very big Big, the decoration of the hotel is quite new, all aspects are good, I will come again next time I have a chance.

The decoration of the hotel is very new and luxurious, and the check-in and check-out at the front desk are very fast. Thank you very much for Xiaolin's thoughtful service. I can basically meet a little request, and follow up our experience throughout the whole process. The other staff are also very enthusiastic and professional. Foreign guests are also very satisfied with the service and environment. The seating area in the lobby is great for working or talking. The soundproofing of the room is also good, the courtyard side is very quiet, the supplies in the room are neat and tidy, and the toiletries are also complete~. They also introduced us to the service facilities and equipment of the hotel. I learned that the hotel has a large gym, which is very good. There is also a self-service laundry room all day, which is really convenient for going out for fun or business trips. The transportation near the hotel is also very convenient. There is a subway station 200 meters away. It is also very convenient to go to the surrounding area to enjoy delicious food and play. For example, Canton Tower, Haixinsha, Zhujiang New Town, etc. are all very close. It was a very good stay experience , I will come again next time~

msg:I rely on my brothers and sisters to go directly to this place, okay, I can’t live in Guangzhou without this place Zundu, because the cp originally wanted to change and then was violently attacked by Poly D Hotel, I crawled back overnight and this is the only one I have in Guangzhou Home, there is a car arrangement service, but you can also get a car according to your own needs. If you ask someone to arrange for the customer service depar**ent, Xiao Zhou can also arrange a car for you. In the first three days, when I opened the curtains in the inner room, my mother had a shopping mall and KFC, so I put on my slippers and rushed downstairs to eat. The sanitation is very clean. Even the elevator room is so shiny that I am amazed. The body lotion in the bathroom smells so good, I really beg you to use it. After applying it, I feel like a princess. Lin Lin at the front desk saw that I had climbed back to live again and gave me a bunch of small gifts. She was so cute and dizzy. The sound insulation in the room is very good. As long as there are no ghosts in the corridor, the room is as quiet as a morgue. I woke up in the morning, noon, and night. The room is completely free. It’s really refreshing. Auntie watched us drink water straight away. Give one bottle and give another bottle and give another bottle, and there are some Guangzhou special drinks, pineapple beer and root beer, although I don’t know much about them. When cp came back, the massage chair in the gym saved my dog's life. Although I jumped up after the massage, I felt super comfortable and super refreshed after pressing my waist. I declare that the laundry room is the coolest of all the hotels I have stayed in! Who needs to do laundry when staying in a hotel? I put one in the washing machine and one in the dryer with my backhand, and take a box of clean clothes home. It’s just that the food delivery robot is a little slow. Maybe it’s because I have too many takeaway spots and always hit the robot and run out of battery, so I have to go downstairs to pick it up. There are so many delicious restaurants around. Just don’t order barbecue and spicy food. Don’t worry about it. Just go straight to it. I’ve lived in other places before. I’d still announce that there is a laundry room. Number one in the world!

msg:The overall experience of the hotel is very good, the room is clean and bright, the service is very friendly, it is very convenient to eat around, and the location is in the downtown area. The hotel's self-service laundry room is also very useful, you can wash, dry and iron clothes, and there is also a 500-square-meter gym. There is also a dry and wet steamer in the dressing room, which is very good. It is very convenient to go to Yuexiu District of Tianhe District and take the subway. It is only a few hundred meters away from the subway station. You can enjoy it at three stops. The iced American style in the lobby bar is delicious. ~The hotel is also very new, the rooms are very clean, the facilities are good, and the hotel service is also very good. I especially like Ms. Fengfeng at the front desk. There are morning tea, ice room, milk tea shop, snack bar, bakery, and fast food nearby. Yes, the price/performance ratio is very high. If I go to Guangzhou next time, I will choose this hotel~

The hotel is a 3-minute walk from the subway entrance, and it's only 4-5 stops to the Xiajiu subway on Beijing Road. There is a robot on the first floor to deliver food, and it can also help you store it if you are not at the front desk of the room. There is a self-service laundry room on the 5th floor. The laundry detergent for the washing machine and dryer is free, which is super convenient, but sometimes you need to queue up to use it. It is very convenient to eat and drink around the hotel. Ms. Shanshan has a friendly smile. The only downside is that the hotel has a lot of rooms, and some rooms are a little far from the elevator, so you will get tired after walking😅

This hotel is very cost-effective, and I recommend it to everyone.

It wasn’t because of my low quality. My wife was bitten by 3 mosquitoes that night. My child was bitten 8 times and his ears were swollen. Later, they moved me to a hotel on the 6th floor and said they would compensate me for a breakfast. I worked until 2 o'clock in the morning and I really didn't eat. There was construction work on the subway next to me in the morning. There was no movement from 8 pm to 9 am. In fact, there was a loud buzzing noise. This hotel is terrible. The mosquitoes in Guangzhou are so powerful that the swelling doesn’t subside after being bitten. I’m going crazy. I want to find a really big one on the 6th floor. The room was as cold as an ice cellar. I wore a sweater to sleep, and my child kicked the quilt at night. I covered the child over and over again. I didn’t get much sleep at all, so please check in with caution. Please review the entire experience. , I dare to swear to God, there is not even a normal drink in the water bar. I didn’t drink it. It was so cold during the three nights I stayed there that I didn’t dare to take a shower. The shower I took in Hong Kong today was about the same temperature. Hotels in Hong Kong are not cold at all. This hotel really makes me want to cry. The most important thing is that I feel sorry for my children.

The hotel has a circular design, and there are no head and tail rooms. The room I live in is facing south, although I can't see a good view. But the overall scenery is quite good, that is, whether it is shampoo and body wash, gel water, including things like facial cleanser, it meets the needs of different groups of people. The gym is large and has more than 500 square meters. There are all of them. The most thoughtful thing is that there are some big bath towels in the gym, as well as drinking water. The laundry room is fully equipped with laundry, drying, laundry detergent and irons. The hotel's robot can deliver food to the door of the room. Finally, I would like to add that Miss Song at the front desk is very good at serving and her attitude is very gentle. The rooms are bright and tidy and spacious. The service is very attentive! ! !

msg:Before arriving at the store, Coco, the customer service depar**ent, called to greet us, asking if we had any special requirements for the room, and then added WeChat to follow up with us from the time we left the store to the time we checked out, which was very heartwarming☺️. The room is very clean and the area is large. The view is mediocre, but it doesn't affect it hahaha. Amway Hotel's laundry room is equipped with drying, ironing, and laundry facilities. It is very convenient for us to stay for several days... I found that the location is really good. It is two minutes away from the subway entrance, and you can go to the nearby Beijing Road at any time , Canton Tower, museum, convenient to travel~ You can drink coffee at the bar on the first floor every day when you come downstairs☕️Eat some snacks and fruits🍉, it’s also very pleasant. I found that the hotel has a lot of guests these days, it should be a summer trip Well, I think the hotel is also the first choice for family summer vacation~

There is no service if you want it. The price/performance ratio is just that. The room includes a mini bar. All-you-can-drink service, but there are only two cans of drinks in the refrigerator. It’s so funny! ! Won't stay again. Very bad experience

The fitness center is available from 7 am to 11 pm. The sauna room and steam room can be used for free. The hotel service and environment are good, and there is underground parking The old library has fewer places, but the advantage is that it can be parked for free. When the parking lot is full, the security uncle who is looking for the door will guide you to the free place to park. The breakfast tastes good too. It’s good enough for a four-star hotel to reach this level. It’s recommended to increase the variety. The hotel is located in Wuyang New Town and is very close to the Zhujiang New Town business district. If you don’t want to eat breakfast in the store, you can go to a nearby teahouse for a drink Guangdong morning tea, enjoying the retirement life in Guangzhou is not bad. Butler RAY Shanshan's service is good. Will stay again.

msg:3 years ago, my current husband and I staged a show at the last hotel at this address. He accompanied a friend to check out and I took my cousin to check in. After 3 years, we got married for a year and accompanied me on a business trip for fun 2 My God, after choosing for a day and a night, I finally chose Wanguo Yuanbao. I was shocked when I got off the car at the hotel. It was really a fate...
The first time we stayed in a new hotel, we were greeted by the customer service coco. The little girl explained the hotel's facilities and equipment to us very considerately, and specially added wx.
Although the size of the room is small, it is very clean. You can see it from the floor drain in the bathroom and the bedside of the room. The facilities and equipment are very new. The location is excellent. Our favorite thing is that the window just faces an elementary school. Check in Afterwards, the scene of sitting directly on the small sofa and watching the parents come to pick up the children from school is amazing!
There is a huge gym on the 3rd floor, and there is nothing to say about the equipment! There is also a self-service afternoon tea on the 1st floor where you can try it for free, pour over coffee, seasonal fruits, and snacks... At night, coco also sent good night milk and fruit. For me, who must drink milk before going to bed, it’s great👍
The breakfast is really good, there are even freshly cooked wonton noodles! My husband has already started Amway and friends around him can move in! We decided to consider this hotel first every time we go to Guangzhou for business, it's so delicious! The price-performance ratio is super high, you are not afraid of stepping on thunder, you can just close your eyes and rush!

Although not all of them smiled and greeted, they all stopped and nodded. The hotel guests have free coffee. In particular, the free coffee is not instant coffee powder mixed with water, but is made by a special person. The coffee maker Mr. Piggy is very kind, thank you for the latte he made (although the latte art is a bit overturned) . Another point is that there are 4 bottles of beverages in the refrigerator in the room, all of which are free. Because I chose the coffee in the lobby, the beverages in the room are too much to drink. The hotel has such a large gym and is equipped with two dry and wet saunas.

msg:Ctrip app is awesome, recommended hotel. ### After calling the main station, the hotel switchboard huahua Huahua answered the phone. The facilities and equipment introduced were very detailed, the service was good, and the room types were explained patiently. When I checked in, I saw welcome fruits and cards on the table. The service is absolutely praiseworthy. The auntie cleans up very meticulously, and the room is hygienic and clean. The hotel has convenient transportation and is close to the Wuyangcun subway. Generally speaking, it is more comfortable than the Hilton next door; the gym is good and relatively large. Because I had an appoin**ent with a client to discuss matters, the hotel had breakfast near Diandude, and we arrived just after crossing the overpass. After eating at noon, I woke up, and the pork knuckle rice downstairs was very delicious... Generally speaking, the tourism industry has not been easy in the past two years. I have stayed in many hotels. Guangzhou Wanguo Yuanbao is still my first choice. I hope We will have the opportunity to come and go frequently in the future! ! !

I came here after seeing the location before booking. The starting price is to take a taxi to the Provincial Museum and K11. There are quite a lot of value-added services in the hotel, such as unlimited freshly ground coffee and a 24-hour self-service laundry room. There is nothing wrong with the hygiene of the new hotel, it is very clean.

The facilities and equipment are equipped with good brands, and the shampoo and shower gel are quite good. The products are also very good, and the softness and firmness of the mattress are quite suitable.
2. The hotel also has a pick-up service. When I see me next time, I will come over and open the door for me, help me with my luggage, and guide me to the front desk to check in. There will be tea and towel service immediately during the check-in process. After the stay, he helped me with my luggage and took me to the room. I took a look at the girl named Zhou from the customer service depar**ent, and I liked it! Xiao Zhou’s customer service is really great, very meticulous and considerate, and he has achieved the same service as when I go home. Although many hotels now have value-added services, among the many hotels I have stayed in, they will consider the guests and everything It's all from the customer's point of view, which is great!

I don’t know how to access the TV in the room, and even pressing it continuously doesn’t work. Am I wrong? Indeed, because this has happened more than once. Do you have to send a video of the front desk not answering the phone for a full minute before admitting it? I hope it can be improved. Recognizing the problem is actually progress.

After checking in, I feel that the hotel as a whole is still very good. The housekeeper is small Liu explained to us the surrounding special snacks and tourist check-in spots, and provided a good tourist route. However, the hotel's gym and sauna room are very good. The introduction said that the area is large. Seeing is believing. We were really surprised. The housekeeper also I recommended a noodle shop that tastes really good. I asked about my experience every day, and the service was very considerate. I think it is really wise to choose Wanguo Hotel this time. When we leave the store, we also suggest that it will be cheaper to book a car with Ctrip and go to the airport. I look forward to the next time Come to Guangzhou to live here again.

And the decoration of the hotel lobby is new. There is a shopping mall behind the lobby. The environment is very chic and makes people feel very comfortable~. This is the first time I stayed at Yuanbao Hotel. I feel that Huahua, the front desk staff of the hotel, has a very good service attitude and check-in is very fast. Check-in gave me recommended itineraries~. In addition, the hotel is more convenient to travel to Guangzhou East Railway Station. The subway is only a few stations away, and it takes about 20 minutes by taxi. The overall price/performance ratio of the hotel is relatively high. In the urban CBD, the prices of surrounding hotels are high, but the price of this hotel is very moderate, the room facilities and equipment are relatively complete, and there is a cute intelligent robot that can deliver food to the room. If you order food, you can download it Just note the room number, ask the delivery person to put it at the front desk, and the cute robot will deliver it. . . Hahahaha~ The curtains in the room are automatic. And the weather in Guangzhou is very hot recently, Huahua at the front desk will be kind enough to introduce mosquito repellent liquid on the top of the wardrobe, open the wardrobe, and then find umbrellas, two sets of nightgowns, hangers~ Hey, the room has a mini bar and a small refrigerator. Free to use. There is a charger next to the bed, which is quite complete. Next is one of the key points of the room: hehehe, the mattress is soft and comfortable, with four big pillows, the bedding is clean and tidy, and the hygiene is clean and tidy. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry. The key is that the service is very good. The staff in the lobby will greet everyone when they meet. There is free afternoon tea and fruit. It is in the executive lounge on the first floor. A warm reminder: the hotel has hand-made coffee, drinking coffee, enjoying the air-conditioning and sitting and chatting is very comfortable comfortable. If you have time to travel here, you can stay for a few more days, and the accommodation for business trips is also very good. The facilities in the hotel rooms are very user-friendly, the network speed is good, and the scenery outside the window is good. The most important thing is that the hotel has a 500-square-meter gymnasium with a yoga room, and the equipment is divided into aerobic and anaerobic areas. It is a very good staying experience. Finally, let’s comment on the breakfast. The breakfast is self-service. The ingredients are very fresh and rich. Let’s not say more, just look at the picture!!! I will continue to stay here in the future. I highly recommend it to everyone. It’s really good.

Honestly speaking, the hotel is in a good location and it is convenient to find something to eat.
But, but, what I'm saying is but.
For a hotel at this price, the room is small. When I checked in on the first night, the room had a smell. Moreover, the highest guest room in this hotel is on the 6th floor. My room on the 4th floor opened the window and faced the road and residential buildings. I didn't dare to open the curtains during the day.
The best thing is that I checked in in the middle of the night and started to decorate at 8 o'clock on Saturday morning. The sound of impact and rotation was intermittent. Well, I endured it and came back after shopping around. I wanted to take a nap in the afternoon and continued the decoration. I told the hotel that this was It complies with the regulations, and there is a note in the room to remind you. After I was really convinced, my family said it was not as comfortable as Atour.
Let’s talk about service. If you don’t go out before 9 o’clock in the morning, there is free coffee for residents in the lobby. The waiter said that it starts at 10 o’clock. I was thinking, since the guest mentioned it, how about you make two cups? Anyway, I will never stay in this hotel again. Even though it is a new hotel, I don’t feel anything new. Instead, I feel angry.

There were a lot of hairs on the toilet door (there were some hairs on the bed too) not the one or two hairs seen in the camera and pictures, but seven or eight hairs and the door was photographed At that time, it was wiped off by their front desk, and some felt very sticky. Then we called them to change my room. The process was at least half an hour, and the price we lived in was not cheap. The experience was extremely bad. I booked a five-star hotel. In a normal five-star hotel, when we arrive at the store or check out, there are security guards or etiquette to help me carry my luggage, but they don’t have any. I remember that when I went to the hotel gate with my friends, there were security guards standing at the gate, but there was no It was the uncle driver who helped us carry our luggage. When we checked out, we hailed the car. When the car arrived, there was actually a security guard standing there, but he didn’t help us and told us to carry the luggage with us into the trunk. He just put it there and looked at it. It is very speechless and the experience is extremely poor and rubbish. I will not stay in a hotel next time.

msg:This is a five-star hotel that I have listed, that is, a more advanced business hotel. The hotel is near a residential area, and there is a construction site next to it. There are only a handful of parking spaces in the parking lot, and the entrance and exit are the same. If you come late, you can only park nearby or on the roadside. There are very few breakfast items, and it was already empty at 9:30. The coffee was as weak as water. The sound insulation of the room was poor, and the air conditioner was hot and cold. This Ctrip recommendation is not reliable.

msg:It was the first time I came to Guangzhou and I fell in love with Wanguo Yuanbao Hotel. First of all, I would like to talk about the location of the hotel. The location of the hotel is very good. It is very close to everything. The subway is right at the door, and there are many delicious foods. The hotel lobby is very eye-catching. The decoration of the hotel is very stylish, the decoration and lighting are beautifully designed, the service of the hotel is also very good, and the service staff are very polite and enthusiastic. As soon as I came in, I could see the two oracle bone inscriptions, which were very artistic and touching. Before I reached the door, the service staff came up to pick up my luggage and then led me to check in. The service staff at the front desk were also very enthusiastic, polite, and the check-in process was fast and professional. ! When I got to the room, I found that the sanitation was very clean, and the toiletries were complete. The small refrigerator and the mineral water on the table are free to use. If you have any questions, dial 0 to contact the staff. It is very efficient! This time, I stayed for two nights. The experience is very good. There is a free gym on the 3rd floor. After you are tired, you can go to the steam room. There is also a self-service laundry room on the 5th floor. The hotel is very thoughtful and meticulous. The staff you meet in any corner will greet the guests. It feels good. In the lobby on the first floor of the hotel, there is a free afternoon tea, coffee, fruit and snacks for hotel guests. There is also a preparation on the second floor of the hotel. The opened shopping malls are currently open with Nayuki and a KFC worth looking forward to! There is also a Wuyang Tianjie opposite the hotel, where you can eat, drink and have fun. I checked out today and got off the elevator. Before I got to the front desk, a young lady came up to catch my room card. After checking out for 0.1 seconds, I checked out and took a look. The name is Lingqin. The service is very good. She is very proactive and patient. Thank you for helping me find the courier that was delivered a few days ago and for helping me push my luggage! All in all, it was a very good experience. I will choose to stay again next time I come to Guangzhou!

As soon as I entered the lobby, I felt that the decoration of the hotel was good, and it tended to be light and luxurious. When I checked in, I was received by manager Martin. My check-in was very fast and professional because I arrived at the store The time was relatively late. Manager Martin also helped me to delay the check-out time for free. This really made me feel very comfortable. The elevator in the hotel needs to swipe the card to get to the room. The privacy is not bad. The room decoration style I also like the room very much Clean and tidy. Although the hotel opened last year, the rooms have no smell. Guangzhou Yuanbao Hotel is very different from other hotels. Their bedding is all custom-made, and it is very comfortable to sleep in. The drinks in the minibar in the room are also full. It’s a pity that I didn’t experience the hotel’s fitness center. I’m 100% satisfied with my stay. I’ve added Manager Martin’s WeChat account. Next time I have a friend who comes to Guangzhou, I must recommend you to stay at Guangzhou Yuanbao Hotel or if I come to Guangzhou again. Look for Manager Martin's service! I still live in Guangzhou Wanguo Yuanbao Hotel. Recommended

It is very close to the Wuyangcun subway station, so it is very convenient to travel. It is also about 3 kilometers away from Canton Tower. The decoration is new and hygienic, free self-service laundry is provided, the breakfast is very rich, afternoon tea is provided in the lobby, drinks and water in the refrigerator are free in the room, there are many authentic Cantonese restaurants in Wuyang New City opposite the hotel, and there is a little Dude nearby, just a short walk away Seeing the beautiful night view of Xiaomanyao, I can choose this hotel next time.

msg:The design of the newly renovated hotel is not bad. The items you see are pretty clean. The minibar in the room is also free. Although there are only a few drinks, some hotels charge for the ingot hotel, which is slightly better. There is a fitness center and a laundry center in the hotel. And they are all free to use, which is very convenient for business trips or short-term tourism. The sauna room in the fitness center is also good, and the whole person is comfortable with a lot of eating and drinking around. The room I booked did not include breakfast, so I don’t know how the breakfast is, but if you come to Guangzhou and don’t try the morning tea culture in Guangzhou, it will be a bit of a waste. The parking space allows me to park for free, which adds a bit of extra points. When I booked the room, I didn’t pay attention to the size of the room, so I booked a room casually. When I arrived at the store, I was not sure, so I asked the staff to show me several rooms and helped to upgrade the room type. The bedding is also very comfortable and warm, and the sleep is good, so I am very satisfied with the experience of staying this time. I recommend friends who travel with family or business.

1. The security service at the entrance is okay. They help with luggage when arriving and leaving the hotel.
2. The front desk staff is too pushy when it comes to providing individual services. I stayed in a suite for 3 nights and ordered takeout for late night snacks every night. I asked the front desk staff to help the robot deliver the takeout upstairs. I feel like it’s not that difficult to ask for help. It’s not a robot. Electricity, there are various reasons. One time I felt sick to my stomach and bought medicine from takeaway. I wanted the front desk to send a robot to deliver it, but I was not available for various reasons. Not recommended for those with a large demand for takeaways.
3. In terms of facilities, the toilet in the restroom is too small. It is a toilet for children. It is embarrassing for men to have a large ***** outside. Then the glass partition separates the toilet with only a little space, so you can only stand and wipe your butt~~

Customer service Lingqin He was really considerate and considerate at the front desk. He casually said something about his birthday.

There is a 500-square-meter fitness center on the 3rd floor. The hotel is very thoughtful and meticulous! It is also very convenient to go to various interesting places nearby. The hotel is a 2-3 minute walk to the subway entrance. It is very convenient to travel. This time staying at Wanguo Yuanbao is a very pleasant experience. I will contact you in advance next time. If you come to Guangzhou, it will be the first choice!

There is a bus stop at the intersection of the hotel, and there are many taxis passing by. The hotel is newly opened and decorated well. The brothers and sisters at the front desk have a very good service attitude Well, I was greeted by the customer service Xiaoya, who introduced me to the hotel facilities and equipment and helped me to carry my luggage to the room. The room was also relatively clean and tidy, and the bedding was not at all. It felt very warm and luxurious in a hotel. The room in the hollow lobby is relatively quieter. It may be that my nose is sensitive and the window of the room cannot be opened, so the whole room feels a little stuffy to me. After leaving the room, there is always a card to get electricity. I think it’s okay. If you have high air requirements like me, it’s recommended to book an exterior room. There are also hotels with food delivery robots. The information will be delivered to the door of the room after the note is made. You can get it as soon as you open the door. It’s not too convenient to go downstairs to pick up my takeaway. The lobby bar on the first floor is very comfortable, and the sun shines in the morning. It’s really pleasant to have a cup of coffee and read a book. When you’re tired, you can look up at the road Pedestrians, vehicles and green plants on the side, there will be a kind of tranquility in the busy city, the a**osphere of fireworks in the world. Checking out is also very convenient. You can go straight away after you give the room card and get the invoice, because I gave the invoicing information when I checked in, so I don’t have to wait in line for the invoice like other people. Babies who have the need for billing can really try to give the hotel the billing information in advance, and experience an effective check-out hahaha

msg:This hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.
1. The decoration money of this hotel is spent in the lobby, and the room is only about 300 yuan. During the Spring Festival, it can be sold for 2600 yuan
2. There is no elevator from the parking lot to the lobby
3. It was found that the sanitation was not done well, and I was dismissed by saying that I was too busy these two days
4. Doors and wardrobes are not soundproof like cardboard
5. Toiletries and tea bags are the same as those in more than 100 hotels
6. There are only two cups, and the suite does not even have a tea set

The bathroom was also very clean, but the sink was a bit small, and there was a very bad one. The point is that the hotel turned off the air conditioner during the two days I stayed, saying that it was because some customers thought it was cold. As a result, turning on the air conditioner in the room didn't work. The temperature in the room reached 28 degrees at night, which was hot and stuffy! Can't sleep at all! I haven't heard of such a hotel until now. . Let's open the windows, but most of the guest rooms are closed! This is very bad! ! I feel a bit short for the bed!

The fare from Beijing Road is more than 20 yuan, and the starting price is the starting price from Guangzhou Tower and Gaode Landmark Plaza. The facilities are very new and elegantly decorated without any peculiar smell. The lobby is very warm and the service is super good. All the staff at the guest room bar at the front desk are patient and caring. The water bar in the guest room, toiletries, slippers and other supplies are of high quality. The hot water is excellent. The bedding is comfortable and down, and the high-end automatic curtains. Robots deliver supplies to the door. Free handwork at the bar on the first floor The freshly made coffee is very good, and I will continue to choose. I would like to praise the staff on the first day of the ***** New Year. The luggage was delivered to the car, and two small cute toys were also sent. It was a very pleasant experience. Happy New Year.

msg:Staying at the Wanguo Yuanbao Hotel is quite accidental, because basically the hotel I stay in is not the same every day in Guangzhou. After seeing many hotels on Ctrip, I thought that I hadn’t experienced the new hotel before, so I booked to stay for one night to experience it. When I checked in, it happened to be the time for their shift change. There were many brothers and sisters at the front desk. At a glance, they were all very enthusiastic. They even helped us upgrade the room for our family of three to experience. Brother Ma and us I introduced the hotel facilities in detail, but I didn't try the gym. My feet were really soft after walking outside. I didn't want to move when I got back to the hotel. The standard toiletries in the room are for two people. Our family of three stayed here. Ms. Shanshan also An extra set of toiletries was sent to our room (it would be even better if there were children’s toiletries). They really do a very meticulous service and you can feel the warmth brought by their service. It is indeed the facilities of the newly opened hotel. They are all new, and the rooms are very warm and feel like home. The hotel also has a food delivery robot. Ordering food is delivered to the room by the robot, which is very fast and convenient.

msg:Why book this hotel? Because I stayed for one night when it first opened, and I felt pretty good. Then my friends came to Guangzhou to play. I thought it was close to my home. The hotel is only a hundred meters away from the subway entrance, and the bus station is also at the intersection of the hotel. Anyway, in terms of transportation There is no need to worry. When my friend and I checked in, we were all received by the same receptionist, Xiao Ma. He is a very responsible and considerate man. In the evening, he arranged for his colleague to deliver hot milk to my friend. My friend commented: Very warm person, very warm hotel ! If you want to go or where the food is better, you can never go wrong by asking Brother Ma. The hotel's gym is also very large, close to the road, with a good view. When running, you can look at the pedestrians and vehicles on the street, and the running time will increase unconsciously, hahaha! There is also a yoga room for the ladies. Of course, I can play in the gym for an hour with all kinds of fitness equipment. If there are fitness experts, it is estimated that they will not be able to get out for 3 hours. The most special thing for me is that there is also dry and wet steaming in the gym. After a tired day, steaming for a while can really relieve fatigue, and I feel much better at night. It is a very special hotel, and I recommend everyone to experience it. My friends and I will stay again many times. See you next time, Brother Ma!

I didn’t expect it to be so good. It is especially suitable for parents and children. Every waiter is very enthusiastic and will chat with us like a family. The laundry room is large and fully equipped. It has a dryer directly, which solves a big problem for families with children traveling in the South! Here we moved to the Chimelong Panda Hotel. The children themselves were clamoring to go back to the original hotel.

msg:This time, I compared several hotels on the Internet and finally chose Wanguo Yuanbao, which did not disappoint me. The location of the hotel is very good. It is only two minutes away from the subway station. As soon as you enter the lobby, you can feel the enthusiasm of the service staff. The service staff is already there before getting off the bus. I came up and helped me take my luggage and guide me to the front desk to check in. The front desk staff is very professional, especially the customer service housekeeper Lingqin is very enthusiastic and handed me tea and hot towels and took me to the room. Along the way, I introduced the hotel and I can feel her. The hospitality is very warm. The room is very large. The washing utensils are complete. There is a gym of about 500 square meters on the 3rd floor of the hotel. There is a self-service laundry room on the 5th floor. The hotel has considered it very meticulously! After going out for dinner at night, I came back to find that the hotel gave me a cake. I was so surprised that I didn’t mention that it’s my birthday. The hotel is very meticulous, and the housekeeping depar**ent also put a foot bath bucket, which needs a lot of praise! I stayed for several nights this time and found that the hotel is really good in all aspects. Yes, there is an executive lounge on the 1st floor that is open to hotel guests free of charge. You can drink coffee, eat fruits, and enjoy this wonderful afternoon tea! Including check-out is also 0.1 seconds. Seeing the guests step out of the elevator, the service staff will immediately come over to pick up the room card. It really feels like home when you come here. It must be the first choice next time you come to Guangzhou!

msg:I really don't understand that the five stars of this hotel are added by myself! And good reviews. It's really a pit.
First of all, the bathroom is very smelly. It is the smell that comes back up, and the door can't stop it.
Second, the carpet is very dirty and there are hairs all over the floor, can you clean it up please? !
Third, sleeping at night is very noisy, even if the cars outside are not stopping, the main road outside is not good, so the sound of cars passing by is very loud, which especially affects sleep.
For the room rate of nearly 2k a night during the Chinese New Year, it really fell into the pit.

msg:Traveling to Guangzhou during the Spring Festival, due to the late booking time, there are not many choices. Mainly talk about the advantages and disadvantages of the hotel:

Advantages: The hotel was newly opened in September 2022, and later served as a hotel for shelter medical staff. The facilities are very new and clean, there is no peculiar smell in the room, the sound insulation effect is good, the bathroom is separated from the wet and dry, and the shower water is very comfortable; the service is good, The staff are well-trained, courteous and thoughtful, and the room type was upgraded for free during the Spring Festival; the transportation is convenient, it takes about 5-10 minutes to walk to Wuyangcun Subway on Line 5, and the breakfast is clean and delicious.

Disadvantages: Although it is only one stop away from Zhujiang New Town, the surrounding facilities and restaurants are slightly less, and even fewer doors are open during the Spring Festival; the elegant double room itself has closed windows, facing the interior of the shopping mall, in fact, the windows cannot be opened or opened at all The curtains, after the upgrade, face the outside community, the view is poor, but at least you can open the windows to ventilate; the room is not cleaned in time, maybe there are few people during the Spring Festival; the price/performance ratio is poor, the room is usually 500 to 600, and the room is not big, and it is about 1300 during the Spring Festival -1500 a night.

Generally speaking, the stay is not bad. If you come here on weekdays, you will feel that the price/performance ratio is better.

msg:The experience is not bad. During the Spring Festival, the price should have increased by more than 900. A big bed has a good service and will help you to deliver it to the room. Usually, you will say hello when you go in and out. Compared with the heating room in the north, the temperature in Guangzhou is not high these days. The floor-to-ceiling windows in the room are windy It's relatively big and airtight. It's not as good as the north. The curtains are closed. It's a smart hotel. The breakfast is relatively simple and not rich. The surrounding area should be the old city. It's not very open during the Chinese New Year, but it's more convenient to take a taxi to Canton Tower. You can't walk there.

msg:Environment: The newly renovated hotel is a three-minute walk to the subway. It is convenient to transfer anywhere. There is a milk tea shop next to the subway entrance. The milk tea is prepared with fresh milk, and several flavors are good. The tea restaurant here tastes good and the price is moderate. There is also a pastry shop downstairs in the hotel. All kinds of pastries are delicious. It’s not like I’m a foreigner who has never seen or eaten delicious ones. It tastes better than the ones on Beijing Road. Before leaving, I went downstairs and bought another ten boxes.
Facilities: The hotel is very quiet. I am most satisfied with the 1.35-meter bed, which is spacious and comfortable. Many hotels are 1.2 meters wide if you bring a child to sleep together. The hotel also has special slippers and toothbrushes for children (toothbrushes and slippers are several times better than those in Chimelong Hotel). The front desk thoughtfully sent them to the room without calling for special inquiries. The room is also spacious and comfortable. After taking the children to rest for a day, they can write on the two writing desks in a timely manner with their homework. It can be said that everything is meticulous. Toilet paper, toothbrush body lotion, slippers, bedding, and most importantly, there is warm air in the cold room in this season! ! ! There is also a washer and dryer upstairs. Is it sweet. This is why I stayed several nights in a row.
I also stayed in two hotels in Chimelong, not worth it, not worth it. Let’s not talk about food without desolation, and laundry without warm air. In short, take the subway for half an hour to Beijing Road, half an hour to the zoo

服務：超級好，凡事有迴應！
酒廊禮遇雙人現磨咖啡:反正我每天喝了一杯！
房間MiniBar免費暢飲1次:房間所有消費都是免費的，雖然我沒喝，我就是讚賞！
酒店健身房不錯，健身器械特別新，酒店我拍照拍少了，但是點個贊！

msg:體驗感非常好的酒店，位置非常好，算是廣州中心地段了，酒店挺好的是新酒店，服務也對得起價格附近美食娛樂博物館圖書館地鐵等，應有盡有！酒店內部用兩個字形容：精緻講究，給人的感覺就是大方得體高端。行政酒廊有免費咖啡可以點，酒店的商場也新開了星巴克，還有奈雪肯德基網上很多人説萬國元寶酒店好，我是兩者都對比的真實感受，萬國體驗感更好而且更新一些，可能很多酒店服務略好一些。附近去吃的喝的應有盡有總體來説，酒店的前台小姐姐鬆鬆服務周到熱情給個大大的贊！萬國元寶酒店應該是廣州體驗感極好的酒店了，下次去廣州還會首選！

環境：一開始還擔心入住的房間會不會吵後來發現擔心是多餘的，隔音還不錯。周邊居民樓沒啥景色可看的，好在視野還算開闊。
衞生：入住的8572房間面積不算很大20多平方兩個人也夠用的吧，市中心這個價錢性價比還算可以
設施：酒店有免費提供24小時的洗衣房。早7晚11的免費健身中心，房間有迷你吧，有半自助式的大堂吧。

服務：還沒到店就接到了客服coco的問候電話，小姑娘很不錯，發來了具體位置，並且幫我們安排好了房間，到了店之後，工作人員都很有禮貌，比如保安小哥，樓層阿姨，跟前台的小姐姐們…
位置：地理位置優越，距離附近的廣州塔，北京路，海心橋都很近，酒店距離地鐵口步行2分鐘，去哪裡都非常方便！
設施：設施設備齊全，房間對外景色一般，附近是居民樓跟小學，但是房間的衞生乾淨整潔，毫不猶豫的又續住一晚。
性價比很高，第二天一大早要趕飛機，客服coco還幫我們叫了車過來接我們，服務真的很好，對萬國元寶酒店印象很不錯，下次有機會還會過來。

房間鋪設地毯，我很喜歡這種，可以赤腳走路。
有些地方稍微改進下，配合服務流程，就會讓人更加覺得酒店高級別：
1，房門居然沒有機械反鎖釦，安全感不足
2，冰箱贈送的飲品讓我覺得小氣，礦泉水都當做贈送飲品了

提個意見，可以準備一下小朋友的床欄，半夜小朋友翻身掉床下了，還好有地毯，沒事。
酒店位置去哪裡都很方便，吃飯坐地鐵一個站就能到珠江新城，太方便了。體驗感很不錯

過程中有一個問題值得提一下：
上午11點多打電話到酒店，問能否辦理入住，回覆説因為訂的兩個房間，目前無法確定，建議下午2點來辦理。好。下午兩點辦是正常時間。結果，到下午兩點十分鐘左右來辦入住手續，還是衹有一個房間，另一個要等一等。我們也同意了了。一家五口人窩在一個房間午休，很不爽。我們提的要求是兩個房間靠在一起，就個並不過分。但，一直到下午3點半左右，才拿到第二個房間卡。
按照規定也好，約定也好，下午兩點辦入住，再正常不過。讓我們等到三點半，無法正常休息。對於這樣的酒店出現這種情況，無法理解無法接受。重要的是，上午11點多、下午兩點多，兩次提出要求，還硬是讓我們等了1個多小時才拿到第二張房卡。最終酒店方也沒有任何解釋，好像一切都在情理之中。

環境很新，房間設備也還行，和五星級比不了，但個人感覺很乾凈簡潔，早餐種類葷素搭配，品種也比較多，整體感覺滿意￼。
唯一感覺不好的就是房間裏的空調，一到晚上關完燈後不管怎麼調温度都貌似恆温26、7度左右，在炎熱的夏季的確有點難熬
其他的都算滿意

酒廊禮遇雙人現磨咖啡:咖啡是現磨的哦！

環境：近地鐵站，不過旁邊有修地鐵，出行要安排好時間，有些時段很堵。還有一個就是房間空調默認設定20℃，晚上注意調一下，否則很容易吹感冒。
服務：前台小劉服務很好，辦理入住速度很快。客服小周服務很周到，詳細引導客户入住。

在酒店一樓大堂還有對住店客人免費提供的咖啡，下午去喝一杯簡直不要太開心！房間面積很大，洗簌用品都很齊全，入住的第一天就先看了一下衞生特別乾淨整潔沒有一點毛病。miniba裏面的飲料也是免費使用的！
在酒店的5樓有一個自助洗衣房，對於入住幾天的人來説太友好了，洗衣機烘乾機熨斗都配有！酒店2樓是一個商場，問了工作人員説是暫時還沒有開業，但是裏面的氛圍感很棒，可以去拍個照打個卡。在3樓居然還有一個500平的一個巨大健身房，汗蒸一下也很不錯哦！
總之萬國元寶是近期入住過體驗感極好的一家酒店，下次來廣州必定還會首選的！

到達早上國際航班到達酒店早上5點多，又值廣交會。前台留下我電話，早上8點，第一時間打掃衞生，通知我入住。非常感謝前台體貼，人性化服務。

大堂咖啡，飲料和小吃免費供應給住客，贊！！

2. 周圍環境非常有人間煙火味，方便

3. 房間不大，但設施齊全。

唯一不足，房間衹有一條通道，去有些房間離電梯很遠。
