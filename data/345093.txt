msg:Hotel staff was very friendly and can speak basic English. I went early for checkin at 11:45 pm and my room which I booked was not cleaned so room was upgraded to premium room for free where sea view was good and sea can be seen 180 degrees.Beach is just few minutes walk from the hotel. 

I stayed in that hotel for two nights but mine bed sheets were not changed. There were some stingy strains on the floor nearby bed and also on mirror in bathroom. There was small hole in my bed sheet. There was no refrigerator in the room so I requested them to use hotel staff refrigerator to put my food. Mine air conditioner was not working well so I requested them to fix it and it was fixed. 

Other then that I had very good experience staying there and I would definitely recommend it to others if they work on negatives when I’ve mentioned above.

msg:Stayed with two friends on a girls getaway. The only good thing about this hotel is the convenience to the beach, which is clean and quiet. 

The hotel itself was also very quiet with very few guests. The front desk assistants didn’t even greet us when we arrived, just shouted to hand over our passports. We booked deluxe suites and it had such a bad smell so we asked to be changed to non-smoking rooms. They changed us to a “ladies only non-smoking” floor but the rooms were below standard with smelly sheets, moldy showers, very dirty bathrooms and floors that you couldn’t walk on barefoot. The hotel pool was closed and all facilities including the restaurants were too. 

We were woken up at 1am to the hotel room phone ringing and the front desk assistants saying our codes had changed yellow and we all have to quarantine. They insisted that we come downstairs and head off to a quarantine facility. We refused as all of our codes were green and we have all been tested every single day since Jan 2022! 

The next day, after chilling at the beach, we wander back to the hotel and they run to us yelling for us to put our masks on, while we are dripping wet and clearly getting ready to  change and there was not a soul in sight so the aggressive covid protocol was unnecessary, uncalled for and accusatory. 

The hotel staff were clearly very paranoid to have foreign guests. Given that we were some of the only guests booked in, they made us feel very unwelcome. We understand that Sanya has had a recent outbreak and hotels are cautious, but we had no problems at other hotels during our stay on the island. 

We were very disappointed with their service and do not feel that this hotel is worthy of a five star rating.

I actually extended my stay for 4 additional nights since having the beach across the street is extremely convenient, especially if you like to take dips early in the morning. The boardwalk along Sanya Bay is right there as well; very shaded and clean, perfect for long walks or running. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and the pool was super clean. I will definitely stay here again when I want to escape for short vacations on a weekend!

msg:I have stayed at Sunshine Hotel before. This time I also chose to stay here first. Because of the poor sleep quality, I left a note to the hotel that I wanted a quiet room. The front desk lady changed me to a very quiet room next to it and upgraded the room type for free. The whole room was bigger. The service was very good and considerate. The receptionist helped me with the luggage and sent it to the room.
The room facilities are very complete. Two room cards are given after registration. The bathroom has a lot of water, which is very good. The bath is very comfortable. The bed is also very soft. The room has been air-conditioned in advance before check-in. It is very cool as soon as the door is opened. The room is equipped with an extra electric card. The room is cool when you go out and come back. It is very considerate.
The swimming pool downstairs is open from 2 pm to 10 pm. You can take your children to the swimming pool. There is a beach behind the hotel swimming pool. You can walk directly to the sea in the morning to swim.
The environment here is very quiet and it is also very convenient to go to Xidao. It is just a little far from the place to eat. Everything else is pretty good. I will stay for a few more days next time.

msg:It is really worth traveling to Sanya during off-peak hours!!!
Thanks to Sanya Sunshine Hotel for making me feel at home
From the moment I arrived at the hotel entrance to the moment I left the hotel and set off on my return journey
I could feel the attentiveness and care of the hotel service staff
When I got off the taxi, the lady took the initiative to help me get my suitcase off the car
And! Helped me to the door of the room. I really love it!!!
When I checked in, maybe because I brought a child
I was upgraded to a parent-child room for free❤️
This may be a benefit in the off-season. It really can't be forced in the peak season
The parent-child room is super spacious, and there are small tents and wooden horses for children
The bathroom is also super large. I like this big terrace the most!
There are coconut trees full of coconuts next to it, so charming
The most heartwarming and touching moment of this trip
Please allow me to dedicate it to a staff member named Chen Yuan
The story is that I left the household registration book for my child at the hotel. I didn’t find it until I checked in at the airport
I was worried that it might be left at the hotel, so I called to ask
I asked them to keep an eye out for it and keep it for me if they saw it when cleaning the room. As a result, it was really left at the hotel
Thanks🙏🏻Brother Chen Yuan for sending it to me
The household registration book is really important!!! It helped me avoid the trouble of reissuing it
I have been to many countries and stayed in many hotels, big and small
But I really like Sanya Sunshine Hotel
And it is very close to the airport, maybe only ten minutes by taxi
If I have the opportunity to come to Sanya again, I believe it will be my first choice❤️

msg:I really don’t know what to say. I can only say that the sunshine this time made me stand out and left a deep impression on me. I have lived in Sunshine for nearly twenty years, and except for special circumstances in the past few years, basically every year I am going to Yalong Bay to stay for a few days and then come here again. On this trip, we also visited the Sheraton Mangrove Forest first, and the last stop was Sunshine. I was given a surprise when I came here! It is actually being renovated again. It has been renovated for two or three consecutive years. In the past, the renovation did not affect rest, but this time it is different! I started chipping away at the wall at a little after 8 o'clock in the morning. I called the front desk and didn't stop until after 8:30. I basically didn't want to sleep anymore. Then there is no refrigerator or iron in the room of the five-star hotel. I called the waiter to bring one. The waiter threw the refrigerator on the table and left. I originally wanted to make do with it, but the noise was too much. If you can put it into the cabinet with difficulty, you will know this by watching the video below. The hotel's swimming pool was surrounded by a cordon all day on the first day, and the staff were cleaning the pool. They cleaned it all morning the next day. When I asked at the front desk, I was told that you can swim after 2 p.m., and you can also swim yesterday. . What’s funny is that you can swim, why do you have to surround the cordon? The weirdest thing is the afternoon tea that comes with the package. The electronic screen in the lobby shows that it is until 6:30 p.m., but when I asked the staff in the lobby at 4:59, I was told that it can only be until 5 o'clock, and it is no longer available! In fact, it doesn't matter whether you want to have this afternoon tea or not, but having a five-star hotel with such a service attitude and racing against time to give you points is really annoying! Fortunately, the hotel manager appeared in time and handled it properly, resolving this conflict that should not have happened. It can only be said that Sunshine’s senior management still has a deep understanding of service, which is worthy of recognition! The newly renovated room has no smell. The type-c interface on the wall is very convenient. The black one is simple and elegant. It realizes intelligent control of most of the equipment in the room. It is finally considered to be advancing with the times. It's a pity that the pool bar has not been able to restore its previous self-service barbecue and resident Filipino singers, but the affordable a la carte prices and the chef's exquisite craftsmanship can be regarded as a small bright spot in a place like Sanya Bay. The above advantages are also the reasons why I can give it a neutral rating this time. Finally, I would like to say that I still feel a little sad when I see the deserted lobby of Sunshine. I hope Sunshine can regain its original shadow and restore its former glory through this renovation, both in terms of hardware and software.

When we arrived at the hotel, we originally wanted to store our luggage and wait for check-in in the afternoon, but Lu Zhongqi at the front desk said that there was a room available and let us check in in advance. It was just in time to make some repairs. Thank you very much.
The room is also very large, and the parent-child suite is cute and has many elements for children.
You can see the airport and planes taking off and landing from the balcony. It was a little noisy, but I didn't feel noisy when I closed the door, and it didn't affect my sleep.
The swimming pool downstairs looks good, with a dedicated area for children and a slide. The two lifeguards also kept an eye on me, which was very reassuring.
There are also many varieties of breakfast, including freshly ground coffee.

msg:I booked for 2 nights and stayed for one day. On the second night, there was a problem with the toilet. There was always the sound of water leakage and abnormal noises. It was late at that time, almost 2 o'clock in the morning, and the room phone was out of order. I couldn't contact the front desk. Try it yourself. The trea**ent didn't solve it, and I couldn't sleep very well the whole night! I contacted the front desk the next day, and it took more than half an hour for the maintenance technician to come over. After a brief operation, he said that there was a problem with an accessory, and he didn't replace it with a new one, so he couldn't see the problem and left. After that, the two staff at the front desk didn't have any explanation. When I reported the problem, they repeatedly emphasized that I would check out immediately.
Reason for negative review:
1. As a hotel with relatively high prices (especially during the Spring Festival, the price increases a lot), there is a problem with the toilet accessories. Why not replace it? Just leave it like this and bet on who will be unlucky in the future? Or do you require customers to be able to repair toilets themselves?
2. The customer raised a question with a perfunctory attitude and did not apologize properly. The experience was extremely poor.
3. There is dust on the ironing board in the room, and the hidden areas are not cleaned carefully.
The state of the facilities and follow-up services make it hard to believe that this is a hotel that has been open for more than ten years. Or is it that it is in ruins because it has been open for more than ten years?

Also: a separate reminder for subsequent tourists who want to book a room. The homepage shows that the hotel has hot springs, but they have to pay separately.

msg:I went there once when I was in my 20s, as a couple, and it left me with very good memories, so I came again during the Chinese New Year with my whole family, but! ! I don’t know if it’s because the entire service team has been replaced, or it’s almost full every day, which leads to 1. The front desk supervisor is arrogant in treating guests, and even threatened to deduct my breakfast if I didn’t follow her instructions! ! ! (The attitude is tough and arrogant, and I must check out the hotel my mother rents for a long time before I can register. Even if you have a policy, you can be flexible. For example, you can only register me. Is this how other hotels operate?)

2. Another younger lady coldly refused every request I made. She was very unprofessional and felt like an untrained intern.

Then 3. The facilities are seriously aged, and I feel like I don’t want to spend money to repair them. 4. The swimming pool buffet is boring, 5. The breakfast meals are average.

Just rely on the passenger flow in Sanya to make money day by day, right?
6. We have recruited many young people, but they do not have the spirit of youthfulness and professional service...

That's it, I expressed my dissatisfaction objectively. Only the free seaside is beautiful, so I don't live anywhere else...

It is close to the airport but there is basically no noise. Maybe it is because of the distance. The airport is too close and the plane has slowed down or stopped and the sound is muted. Exiting the hotel's courtyard is the sea, beach and woods, and opposite is the West Island and East Island. It's so beautiful. It is also close to Tianya Haijiao, Xiaodongtian, Nanshan Scenic Area and other convenient transportation. Especially close to Yifenghe Life Plaza, it is convenient for eating and shopping. In addition, the hotel's manager Xu is warm and thoughtful in hospitality, making people feel at home.

msg:This is the most expensive hotel I booked during my trip to Sanya, and also the most disappointing one.
The waiters in the hotel lobby and at the door are very nice.
Every New Year's Day restaurant is quite expensive. I spent a long time choosing it. I wanted to wish you a better New Year's Eve, so I chose this five-star one.
I was very happy to get a free upgrade to the room upstairs. But when I entered the room, I found a letter of apology saying that the elevator was being renovated. The room was next to the elevator. I contacted the front desk to change rooms and was told that if I changed, I could only stay in the room type I booked. There was no upgrade. I was ok to change. I went to the room to take a shower and sleep and found that the bathroom walls were moldy.
I don’t dare to stay in the bathroom for a long time. The page says that it will be renovated in 2022. As a result, the bathroom is moldy. The elevator renovation is not shown on the page when I check-in without informing me. What’s the use of apologizing after entering the room?
The two towels on the sink in the room were stacked differently, the mouthwash cups were not arranged neatly, and there was a fingerprint on the makeup mirror.
The hotel runs directly towards the takeoff. Even with the windows closed, there is a lot of airplane noise. The introduction says it is 6.6 kilometers away. In fact, the straight-line distance is only one kilometer. It is super noisy.
If I hadn't checked in after eleven o'clock, I would have definitely checked out and changed hotels.

msg:Before coming to Sanya, I did my homework in advance when choosing a hotel. Based on the hotel's regional division, rating, price range, and overall cost-effectiveness, I chose Sanya Sunshine Hotel. The final experience exceeded my expectations, and it was a perfect score ~
Hotel location - The hotel is located in Sanya Bay. It is not close to the city so you won't be disturbed, but it is also convenient for travel. You can choose here for your first impression when you first arrive in Sanya and the perfect ending when you leave Sanya. It is very close to the seaside and beach. It is separated by a road, so it is convenient to take a taxi or bus. You don't have to worry about going to the airport, shopping at Sanya duty-free stores, or visiting scenic spots. It can be said that it is the C position of Sanya Bay, a very good location.
The service is very good. If you are serious about traveling to Sanya, you should choose a star-rated hotel. As soon as the car arrives at the lobby, the concierge will come to pick up your luggage. After checking in, you will be sent back to the room. The concierge Li Ning will introduce the hotel and Sanya along the way. He is very professional but It's not overly professional, comfortable and down-to-earth. It makes people feel like they're back at home. They won't feel unfamiliar with Sanya and the hotel at all. It made a very good first impression. There was a little hiccup when I first checked in, but after contacting The hotel staff was impressed by their professionalism and solutions during the process. The service is really good and comes from the heart. Thank you Manager Lu and concierge Xiao Li, because their sincere and enthusiastic service helped the hotel avoid problems. Despite some shortcomings, I will still choose Sunshine when I come to Sanya in the future and when my friends come to Sanya! ! !
Hotel facilities - everything that a star-rated hotel should have, such as swimming pools and gyms, there is nowhere to go even if you don't leave the hotel. On sunny afternoons or in the evenings when the sun sets, when the sun warms the swimming pool, you can Go for a swim in the swimming pool to relax your tired heart. Watch the sunset over Sanya Bay on the balcony in the evening. All your worries will be forgotten. I don’t know how comfortable it is~
The room - spacious and comfortable, large space, hygienic and clean, stable water pressure and temperature, and powerful air conditioning. Although it is close to the seaside, it will not be very humid if the doors and windows are closed and the air conditioning is turned on.
Restaurant - The only thing I didn't experience this time was the hotel's restaurant. When I made the reservation, I didn't order breakfast because I wanted to sleep until I woke up naturally. I will definitely make it up next time and enjoy it!

The hotel is very beautiful and has a Southeast Asian resort style. I recommend the sea view room in the hotel. You can preview the entire Sanya Bay and see the West Island. There is also a slide in the swimming pool. Both adults and children had a lot of fun. The price/performance ratio is very good. The hotel room is as described on Ctrip. It is very spacious and comfortable, with good lighting. Parking downstairs is very convenient. It is easy to take a taxi to the scenic spot. Public transportation can also go to the entrance of the scenic spot. The front desk is beautiful and generous, and the service is warm. All in all the experience was very good

Because it takes a long time to eat with children, the buffet mainly focuses on seafood, including shrimps, crabs, oysters, and sea fish. , being born in the north, I feel very satisfied.

The same high-quality service as before. The hotel floors are also being renovated one after another, and the hardware is upgraded. The 180-degree panoramic sea view is even better. It was my father’s birthday on the day I checked in. The hotel immediately made a birthday cake and delivered it to me after learning about it. What a surprise! Front desk staff Li Shiping must be commended for sending us package information and detailed introduction when booking a room; before check-in, he helped arrange adjacent rooms according to our needs (because we booked two rooms), and was considerate after check-out Satisfaction return visit, I am very satisfied with this stay.
      If I have to make some comments, 1. The minibar in the room is no longer there (it was there before when I stayed there). It is recommended that as the renovation is completed, a small refrigerator must still be provided; 2. The password safe is no longer available. It is also recommended to rearrange it. .

The hotel has a complete set of things. The beach of Sanya Bay is just across the road. It is convenient to travel. The attitude of the hotel staff is very good. Especially Ai Qing, the lobby manager, and Wen Huiting, the lady at the front desk, are really nice. Because I brought my children with me, I was able to upgrade to the Supreme Sea View Room for two consecutive levels. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Sunshine Hotel again!

The view from the sea view room is very good. In the evening, the kids played in the pool. The beach is right in front of the hotel. I feel that this beach should be the best part of water and sand. More importantly, it is very close to the airport. It is very close to the West Island and not far from the east. I rented a car and the whole Sanya feels pretty good.

I booked a free upgrade to a 180° supreme sea view room in a high-end sea view hotel. The room is very big and clean. The big balcony faces the sea, and the view is very good. The hotel provides extra mineral water, and the water guns for the children are also prepared early. The location of the hotel is very good, just across the road, and the beach here is relatively quiet and there are few people. It is very suitable for taking pictures and playing, and the breakfast is also richer. The nearby hotels are very cost-effective. Come here again next time.

The hotel's meals and self-service hot pot set meals are delicious, and the service staff are also very enthusiastic and always serve with a smile. The security of the hotel is very good, and the swimming pool and children's playground are guarded by staff. Although I only stayed for 4 nights this time, I will stay here next time I come to Sanya.

The most important thing is to buy a dinner for 2 people for 2 nights, which is super cost-effective. The front desk service is also very good and enthusiastic.
You can catch hermit crabs and shells on the beach, and occasionally you can catch small starfish.
It is close to West Island and Tianya Haijiao, so you can stop by for a visit.

It was too hot, so I went to the front desk to register the reserved apar**ent with the heart of trying. He got the warm care of a supervisor in sky blue clothes. Assigning the front desk on duty solved my problem. Thank you very much!
In addition, when I came back from a night out, I forgot to turn off the car lights. The attentive hotel staff checked the video repeatedly, found it in the middle of the night and notified me. Let me return the car and catch the plane early the next morning, avoiding the embarrassment of the battery being exhausted and unable to start. Thank you very much!

But ask yourself, the Sunshine Hotel is definitely the most cost-effective and favorite five-star hotel I have stayed in. I have also stayed at the MGM Grand Yalong Bay, but I still prefer the Sanya Sunshine Hotel in terms of overall cost performance! Absolutely the best in Sanya Bay, bar none! ! It is close to the sea, and it is convenient to eat, live, and go out. I use a lot of water. I ask the hotel to get several bottles of water every day. The hotel has no complaints, and it is delivered to the room very quickly. There are air purifiers in the corridors of the hotel, and the hotel is also specially equipped with ladies' floors. The room decoration is amazing! Love it so much, nothing else to say

The room is quite large, but the overall equipment and facilities are still relatively old, and the grade of utensils and sanitary ware is also average. Maybe it's not the peak season, the swimming pool is only open in the afternoon, is it forcing guests to go to the sea in the morning? The breakfast is quite rich, but the timeliness of the service is almost lacking. If something is missing or water is cut off, you have to remind the waiter to make up for it.

You can see the sea from the south, and the Phoenix Airport from the north. It's a great experience. Just a suggestion, it would be more perfect if there is a tea table and chairs on the balcony! Crossing the road is the seaside. Although it is not as good as the beaches of Yalong Bay and Dadonghai, and even the beach is a little sandy, it brings a different experience to children. Walking on the beach by the sea will not be full of sand. It is flat and there is no sand on the feet. It is like walking on flat ground. The children like it very much. The most surprising thing is that they can really pick up a lot of shells, which is something I have not experienced on other beaches. The scenery inside the hotel is also very good, the breakfast is also very rich, the tree-lined path between the hotel and the beach is very comfortable to walk, and the scenery is also beautiful, great! Will consider staying next time.

It is very nice to get up in the morning and come back to have breakfast after catching the sea. There are many bus lines nearby. It is also very convenient to take a taxi to various attractions.
Service: The welcome is very polite, they will help open the door when getting on and off the bus, take the luggage, and send it to the room, making you feel at home. Every time I go out and return to the hotel, I greet them warmly.
Diet: Breakfast is rich. The breakfast restaurant is on the second floor. It is an open restaurant. You can see the coconut trees next to you when you eat. The coconuts are hanging on the trees so close. It is a very pleasant time. In the evening, you can choose to have a buffet dinner at the hotel, with a variety of varieties, music, and barbecue. The swimming pool is right next to the restaurant, and you can play by the pool while eating.
Facilities: open-air swimming pool, buffet seafood barbecue dinner, full of a**osphere. There is also a children's playground. The room was clean and tidy. This time I stayed in a suite. It has a large area, good sound insulation, and a small tent. The children like it very much.
Field of view: Open the door to see the sea, and you can also see the West Island. You can open the window to sleep at night, and you can hear the sound of the waves.
Thoughtful: On the first day of check-in, there will be snacks as a gift. The quilt was also folded in a special way and decorated with fresh flowers, which amazed the children.
In short, it was a particularly satisfying experience, staying for three nights. If I go to Sanya in the future, I will choose it again. Even I still have more to say, let's live again next time I have a chance. Haha 😄.

One room can enjoy three kinds of scenery. In the morning, you can also see the sun rising from the roof of the building in the distance, which is very spectacular. The size of the balcony and the size of the room are very large. The only point that needs to be complained about is that the layout of the bathroom in this room type is a bit cramped.

Sister, she is very caring and enthusiastic. I checked in within an hour after I arrived. The room is very clean.

Although there are not so many recreational activities, I feel that the room design here is more reasonable, and the bed and quilt are more comfortable. In terms of cost performance, this is really a win. It's not far from Tianyahaijiao and West Island, but the problem of eating is a little farther away, because we ordered takeaway directly, so it doesn't feel much, I sincerely recommend staying here! I was not bitten by mosquitoes, and the staff also took the initiative to help carry the luggage when I left, especially the young lady who checked in at the front desk. I am sorry because I didn't remember her name. The children also like her very much, and I am very grateful to her.

msg:This is my first trip to Sanya and the first time I stayed at the Sanya Bay Hotel. It’s really nice. First of all, it’s close to the airport. It takes about 10 minutes by taxi. The lobby of the hotel is also very spacious. . The hotel room is also very clean. I personally pay more attention to the hygiene of the hotel when staying in the hotel. Sunshine Hotel does a good job in this regard. I would like to give it a five-star thumbs up👍👍

msg:The newly renovated room is not bad. The room is very clean. I saw it was disinfected. We stayed for 4 nights in a row. On the first night, we didn't have a deluxe double bed with sea view because of the rush booking, so we made do with the garden view suite for the second time. One night, the experience of that night was very bad. Out of 5 points, I can only give 2 points. The price/performance ratio is almost 0. The walls are also peeling, and the carpet is so dirty that I can’t wash it out. It was as dim as a candle was lit in the house, and then changed to the luxurious sea view on the sunny side the next day. I was very satisfied, and finally I could lie on the bed and watch the sea

How to use it without a disposable bathtub cover? This is the first time I have seen that there are no seats on the balcony. The only advantage is that the shower head has a lot of water and it is very pleasant to wash. You have to cross a road to go to the beach. There is no food or beach chairs at the beach.

I asked that the phone was broken, and it was said to be repaired, but there were no ghosts. After checking out, a woman named 1291 had curly bangs and said loudly that it was not assigned to you later? The other male waiter was not great either. Let us understand what the epidemic is saying, but we can't understand! There are not enough staff and so many guests are received! Don't use excuses! Such a nasty attitude! Disgusting!

The room number of the landline was different from ours, and I didn’t come up after 5 minutes. Afterwards, the staff who came up not only didn’t apologize, but they didn’t take anything. Instead, they came in and asked us why we didn’t have one. After that, they insisted on seeing if there was no hair dryer, and went outside to get one before giving it to me. If everyone can see my order, Let's see how many hotels I've stayed in. Can I find a hair dryer and call you guys? Afterwards, at 7 o'clock in the morning on Sunday, there was more renovation upstairs, and I called the front desk several times to try to change the room to no avail. As a five-star hotel, the room change given is to automatically downgrade the room. You have heard of such a solution everyone? Automatically change to a lower level room. If this comment is deleted, I will repost it through various channels and methods. He said that an old hotel is being renovated, and the service is not good at all. Not to mention that I drove down with two luggage and the concierge would not accept it. These hypocritical things, even the most basic sleep can't be guaranteed, why should I stay in your crappy hotel? I commented, don't reply me, I don't want to listen to your hypocritical words to others, I feel disgusting, rubbish hotel, I wish you an early closure

The beach in front of the hotel is clean and soft, the sea is extremely blue, the small islands in the distance, the fishing boats in the distance, the sweetness of the coconut grove... Everything is in line with my most beautiful fantasy of Hainan Island. What makes me feel warmer is the hotel staff. They are enthusiastic, patient, and considerate. After spending 5 days in Hainan and staying in Sunshine for 4 nights, I like the view on the observation deck of the room the most. Bathtub, taking a shower under the light of stars and moonlight at night is so pleasant. We warmly remind everyone that the view will be better if you live on a higher floor. My happy trip to Sanya🌵💐

It's a pity that there is no refrigerator in the thousand-yuan suite, and it feels that the configuration is slightly lower. By the way, the water quality of the swimming pool can be improved further. However, drinking the afternoon tea with the sea breeze blowing, the mood is still very happy. Thanks to the front desk and the concierge staff, especially kathy, who are warm, meticulous and thoughtful. I will have the opportunity to visit the same place again in the future.

msg:The hardware conditions meet the five-star standard listed. The service details are far from standard. The seafood hot pot buffet dinner only has drinks and beer on the drinks table. When I asked a male waiter with a little fat and small eyes, he actually said that this buffet does not provide ordinary drinking water, so let me go to the first floor by myself. Bought in hotel supermarket. This is the first time I have encountered a star-rated hotel where the buffet cannot even provide drinking water. I can only turn to the other side to find a more delicate waitress, but she quickly brought a few glasses of plain water. If the manager of this hotel should really be ashamed of the male waiter, in the final analysis, the training of the staff is not enough, and there is a lack of a listed five-star waiter's sense of responsibility and sincere service to customers!

msg:This hotel is really love and hate. First of all, because it is a morning flight, I want to book a hotel close to the airport. The location of this hotel is really good. The airport is in front of Sanya Bay and behind it. We booked a sea view room. The first room was because the ceiling light was broken and kept turning on automatically. The cleaning aunt happened to be there. She couldn’t help it for a long time, and then changed the room. The second room is a smart toilet. The water and electricity master came and said that it could not be repaired, so he changed the room. From 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock, I changed three rooms before I could rest. I feel that the hotel front desk and concierge service are average. There was a time in the middle that I couldn't open the room, and it was cold when I went down to re-swipe my card. The concierge at the gate often has no one, and I carry my luggage by myself.
However, this hotel is close to the edge of Sanya Bay with not many tourists and not many businesses. It is a clean and good place, and the swimming pool is open all day, unlike many that only open in the afternoon! The cleaning aunt is really good and responsible, and the cleaning is also very clean!

During this trip, I brought my children to stay in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay first-line foreign-related five-star hotels with full sea view rooms or sea view suites. I feel that if you look at the sea, Sanya Sunshine is the best. And the corresponding Sanya Bay sea area is not as messy as the Internet. The concierge service of Sanya Sunshine is also very proactive, and there is no love and care from the Internet.

I remembered that I saw an hourly room on Ctrip, and I booked it immediately. Hotels near the airport can open hourly hours. I really want to praise the hotel for the service of the room. It’s so caring. The hotel is really old and the facilities are outdated. The air conditioner has been in the room for more than 1 hour and has not been able to bring down the temperature. After the engineering depar**ent repaired it, the hotel gave it to me It's much better to change a room. The other 4 hours of hourly room ended up with the hotel staying for 5 hours. This service still needs to be praised.

As soon as I got the room card and walked into the corridor, an ominous premonition came to my mind. Sure enough, as soon as I walked into the room, I wanted to check out. The whole room was filled with musty odor, and when I opened the balcony door, it still lingered. The quilt was very damp even for the ignorant baby. I thought about staying up all night, but after taking a shower, I found that the whole bathroom was full of water, running all the way to the bottom of the bed. Hygiene is not good, nowhere is very clean, there are many mold spots in various small corners in the bathroom. The price is really cheap, but it can't be done. A word to yourself: Don't settle for such a cheap hotel, even if it's just for a transition night. Basically, it does not match the five-star, and it is almost the same as the Express Hotel.

People who are sensitive to sound should choose carefully. The hotel is relatively old, the phone in the room is broken, you can only call the front desk with a mobile phone, and the TV can't be turned on. It was too late that day, so I was lazy to change it. There are small mushrooms growing on the skirting line of the room, but the cleaning is done. The room service staff are expressionless and choked when they talk. The hotel can be old, but the facilities should not be broken, and the cleaning should not be sloppy. It's a pity that such a good garden, the management can't keep up with it so badly.

The shower room tiles are covered with dark mold spots, my scalp is numb, and the room service is very poor. I have to wait more than 30 minutes to get some toiletries. I encountered a large number of MLMs when I checked in last year. The team is engaged in activities. This year I met the uploading team again. It was very noisy during breakfast. It seems that MLM companies especially like this hotel. The only advantage is that it is close to the airport. Of course, the noise of planes is also very loud.

msg:The first stop in Sanya, stay at Sanya Sunshine Hotel. This season is the low season for tourism in Sanya, sp****ly populated. One person owns an entire pool.
🚗 Transportation: The biggest advantage is that it is very close to the airport, and the straight-line distance is less than 2 kilometers. The taxi is 20 yuan, because the taxi is not a straight line.
🧹Sanitation: qualified level. There are paper towels and trash cans in the elevator. There is a bathtub on the balcony, but the hotel does not provide disposable bathtub sets. There is a fixed reminder board on the balcony that says that the water in the bathtub is hot spring water. The hotel staff informed that there is no hot spring water, but ordinary tap water.
🍃Environment: This is an earlier five-star hotel. The facilities are average. The room is large in size. The environment is good, only one road away from the sea.
🔔Service: There is a freezer in the hotel lobby with some drinks. However, it is not an automatic sale, and manual sales are required, but there is no service staff on site. To buy the drinks inside, you need to call the front desk to inform the restaurant staff to come, and the price is inflated. For example, a bottle of Wanglaoji in the room is 6 yuan, and the same bottle of Wanglaoji in the lobby is 28 yuan, because the price is the same as the restaurant. But in the end, the employee consulted a manager and settled according to the room delivery price.

After checking in, it was found that there was a decoration smell and it was too close to the airport. I was worried that the noise would affect the rest. , I added money to upgrade the sea-view room. All the problems were solved. The sea-view room was still comfortable. I don’t know why the swimming pool was not open. Maybe there were few people. I couldn’t see a few guests. Breakfast was okay. Seeing a few guests, the type and quality are still guaranteed. It’s a three-minute walk to the beach of Sanya Bay. The environment is okay, but if you have high water quality and beach requirements, you have to go to the Dadonghai, Sanya Bay and Haitang Bay. You get what you pay for. It is indeed the truth.

服務：跟酒店提意見也沒用，規定好了就是死的了，小孩子去游泳池玩不讓下去遊，衹能在小童池玩水，沒有理由。可能是懶得配救生員吧。前提是我們孩子都會游泳，也不行。


環境：環境是老舊酒店的環境，衞生也普通，開了兩間房，其中一間衞生間無門，開大號的話整個房間都是味兒。豪華園景房，唯一的優點就是床夠大，其他也沒啥，普通。


早餐:早餐攜程購買50一人，現場孩子超過1.2米要68一位，所以還不如叫外賣給孩子吃。早餐除了簡單的雞蛋包子粉，豆漿牛奶，沒其他啥好吃的，麪包硬邦邦的，有德國麪包的硬度。

酒店設施老舊，完全沒圖片上那麼靚麗。房間一進去一股味道，地板牆面發潮起霧。被子跟床單一樣薄，更嚴重的是在床上躺了一會就開始渾身發癢，也不知道是細菌還是蟎蟲，床單被套就很不衞生的感覺。
第二天因為要趕飛機就沒和酒店當場反映，在平台提出後，酒店工作人員還扯皮，沒有任何解決措施，服務堪憂。
空調聲響也很大，操控不靈。隔音很差，基本樓道什麼聲音都能聽見。

早餐的種類不夠豐富，但是能基本滿足需求啦。自助晚餐，品種太單一啦。
酒店的位置還是不錯的  ，隔一條馬路就能走到海邊。酒店的泳池也是定點開放，有免費浴巾提供，還有一些小童遊玩的項目都是免費開放的。

海景房：海景房的視野非常棒，能夠讓住客享受到度假的感覺，早上起床可以看到波光粼粼的海面，像是鍍了一層薄薄的金，對面是熱鬧繁華的臨海商業區。12
環境：酒店的環境寧靜，適合放鬆心情，野鴨愜意，海鷗飛旋，是個能讓心變安靜的地方。

食物：酒店提供的早餐和管家自製的缽缽雞、糖葫蘆等小食都得到了好評，晚上還有温暖的肉桂紅酒，按照江浙的口味加了甜甜的糖。

去市區20分鐘左右，去天涯海角和南山文化旅遊差不多3-40分鐘。
五星級度假酒店標準，服務品質等都應有盡有,唯一美中不足可 能就是酒店年齡，和裝修風格,偏向於國企商務風（以前那種）比上不足比下有餘，在三亞灣同價位五星級酒店優勢秒殺存在，尤其是每間海景房都是180°海景視角超讚，陽台帶浴缸，能完美欣賞日落

中餐廳的服務員，兩晚去吃飯，都有些晚了，小夥子服務很熱情，點個贊！
説説硬件的感受，沒有批判性，衹是想讓自己喜歡住的酒店越來越好，吸引越來越多的人成為滿意的回頭客。
十年間去了9次三亞，入住三亞陽光6次。談談自己的感受：
1，硬件設施越來越差，很多房型的衞生間洗漱間的立柱下方都是黴爛的。三年前入住就是黴爛的。
2，沒有裝修的房間，淋浴頭水垢斑斑，出水量小。
3，熱帶，五星級酒店的房間裏，竟然沒有小冰箱。
4，五星級酒店。房間沒有體重秤。
5，55平方米的房間，配備的竟然是32寸的迷你小電視，眼神不好都看不見字幕。
6，健身房設備陳舊，很多鐵製器材銹跡斑斑。而且不規則的散落一地。我去健身了，負責的小夥子，看見我來了，他走了，直到我離開，他也沒回來。
     綜上所述，服務五星，硬件一星，希望在疫情過後，儘快完善，迎接更多遊客的光臨！

表揚的是工作人員態度好。

設施：個別地方待改進，如房間電話、智能園景房衞生間需有隔簾、智能馬桶的功能要能用、樓道層缺少一個公用服務電話

衞生：乾淨，有一次性洗漱用品；注意，布拖鞋可以使用，但不可以帶走，帶走要交費。

環境：離海邊近，過條馬路就是三亞灣的海邊；離市區遠，不開車的話，路上有25、26路公交車，可直達市區；園景房雖然直麪三亞機場，但關上門窗還是安靜的。

msg:   定的2室的海景套房，在7樓。辦理入住後一進房間滿眼的破舊，説實話是相當失望的，但窗外美景很好，床上用品也算乾淨，也就感覺還好。接下來拿出泳衣打算和孩子們去泳池玩，就想着要擦防曬剛下飛機先洗個臉，結果洗手枱的龍頭沒熱水，怎麼放都沒有。也罷，轉戰身旁的浴缸，用浴缸手持噴頭也一樣，結果一開崩潰了，不但熱水沒有，整個浴缸的設施都是壞的，瘋狂噴水，地上身上全濕了。連着兩個2個設施都不行，而且滿頭滿臉噴了個透心涼，已經不爽了。結果孩子那會也在洗漱間被淋濕了，我喊孩子先出去擦一下，這裏找人來看，結果孩子剛一挪步，咣噹摔了一跤，手臂和尾椎骨那邊直接摔得不敢動了，這會我其實就很火大了。壓着火氣給前台打電話，好久沒上來，第二次打我就有些不高興了，要他們快一點。師傅倒很快上來了，結果他們維修人員也修不好。最後勉對付上了。前台經理也確實上來道歉並做了問候，並提出可以幫我們更換房間。當時想基本修好了，我們進來也東西散的到處是，換房間人家還要2次打掃，而且想着換了樓層這家酒店也是這個條件，不想麻煩就説算了。結果接下來的兩天永遠是沒熱水，龍頭不好使，設施陳舊到根本不是能修復好的，忍着住了2晚。結果走的時候前台經理告知我10樓以上都翻新了，衹有下面沒翻新很陳舊。我當時聽到心裏是很不爽的，這家酒店人很少，他們也知道10樓以下設施不行，明明一樣的價格又有空房怎麼就不能把我們安排到高一點的樓層，非要出事了才來問可以調整，而且説可以調整的時候也沒告知高樓層設備沒有這些問題。
    以後再也不會來。
