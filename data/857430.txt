msg:I have to give it 7 points. I have been to five-star hotels, even six-star and seven-star hotels all over the world, and the service of this hotel is unmatched.
From the moment you book the hotel, there will be a dedicated person to follow up to ensure that the scenery of the room you book is what you like
When you step into the door of the hotel, you will feel what it means to be at home. Whenever you go out or come in, there will be someone with a smile to accompany you to the elevator until you put it at the door.
When they found that there were guests in our room, they immediately took the initiative to send two chairs over.
When they saw that we had children, they took the initiative to heat a cup of milk in the room.
When they saw that we had elderly people, they would provide foot bath water.
…..
This kind of meticulous service is really surprising
In addition to the service, the scenery of the hotel is also very good. The hotel is manor-style, and all kinds of flowers are in full bloom in spring, which is beautiful. There are also free electric buses to take you to enjoy the garden.
I didn’t stay for 4 days this time, and I didn’t stay enough. I will stay for a few more days next time.
There is such a hotel in Hengshui, which is really a treasure of Hengshui City. Highly recommended.

The front desk staff is quite professional, especially the service staff Ms. Shi, who is very kind and professional. The service attitude is until we check in the room. It is the best service staff I have ever met on a business trip. If you come to Hengshui for business next time, the hotel will definitely be my first choice, and I will also recommend it to my colleagues to stay here

We booked two business suites, and the service staff led us directly to the door. There was a fruit plate in the room, and slippers, toothbrushes and hot milk were specially prepared for the children, which was very worry-free and thoughtful. Han Meng and Li Yu at the front desk made special praises, called in advance to confirm the itinerary, and patiently and punctually helped us adjust the room according to our needs to ensure that our family checked in smoothly. The park environment of the Yingbin Hotel is beautiful, with flowers and water, very quiet and elegant. I didn't expect that there would be such a high-end team in my hometown of Hengshui. I am really happy and proud! I must come to the Yingbin Hotel again when I return to my hometown next time!

We have stayed in many hotels with government hospitality. I suggest you go and experience them. Accommodation, food, environment, and service are better than 99% of international five-star hotels.
Hengshui Guest House is worth coming back for vacation. Good location and convenient transportation. Good environment, garden style, especially the barbecue hot pot by the lake, very romantic. Whether it is stone or cooking, the food is very suitable for the taste of northerners. The service is very friendly and thoughtful. There are waiters everywhere to ensure that you are in place. In the evening, you will also be sent a foot bath bucket, and they will not chase you for good reviews. The facilities are very good, the quality is good, and it is very quiet to rest at night.
It is worth coming again.

msg:It was a very embarrassing experience. It was the last night of the Spring Festival self-driving tour. I booked here to rest before returning to Beijing because I had driven too long. Then I felt the characteristics of Hebei. A book in the room specifically introduced that the hotel is a depar**ent-level unit.
In terms of hardware, it is magnificent and has swans on the river.
In terms of service, it is confusing and inexplicable. First, when checking in, she insisted that I sign a leader form and write my mobile phone number. I said, can I stay without writing it? She said yes. The attitude was tough and there was basically no service. Then several particularly active doormen and greeters wanted to help you take the box. However, I was pouring water there to drink, and no one paid attention to me. They watched me drink ice water.
I won't go there again. The service in Hebei is really not meticulous at all.

msg:真的非常想多拍幾張照片來着，哈哈，但是帶着兩個寶寶的我真是力不從心也搞忘記了。迎賓館非常的棒！從前台接待到服務人員從態度到服務質量，堪得起一個五星評價，房間很乾凈，床上用品也非常好，甚至連貴妃榻上都有鋪單子，這是絕大多數酒店都沒有的，早餐也很豐盛，吃得很舒服，服務非常棒！五星

msg:賓館環境挺好的 有水系有天鵝有錦鯉。環境修剪地過於整齊了。前台工作人員挺專業的 非常熱情甚至都有點過於緊盯顧客了。最不滿意的就是餐廳服務員。首先是門口某位賣晚餐券的 表情全程不耐煩 當聽到要從她那裡買晚餐券的時候甚至流露出有點失望的感覺。最最讓人難受的是餐廳裏的某服務員 我們一行人是在開餐前兩三分鐘到的 在餐廳門口的屏風外等待 這時她拉開屏風探出半個身子 我本來以為是招呼我們進去等 或者是打個招呼讓我們在外面再稍等一下 結果卻是看到我們在屏風外後她臉色一變 本來可能是還和別人説笑時的殘留的微笑也變成冷若冰霜 還瞪了我們一眼後重重地 注意是非常重重地把屏風拉了一下 好像是我們非常招人嫌 把屏風關的更嚴密了。我們一行人感到難受極了 這種花錢被嫌棄、被侮辱、買罪受的酒店餐廳 永遠印刻在大家印象裏

缺點是早餐太過單一，不對的星級標準，也就經濟型酒店最普通的早餐，我住了3天，每天早餐一模一樣，一個菜都不帶換的，服了
