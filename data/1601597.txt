msg:One of the best resorts I have ever stayed in. Initially, I was skeptical about visiting China due to some negative hotel reviews I had read. However, this trip completely changed my perspective.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable. Chelsey Yang was incredibly attentive when my daughter had a splinter in her foot, providing medical care right at the breakfast buffet. My daughter was in so much pain that she wouldn't let me near her, but Chelsey managed to calm her down and treat her effectively.

Our butler, Fiona, was always responsive to our requests, making our stay even more enjoyable. The photographer captured beautiful photos of our family, creating memories we will cherish forever.

The room was immaculate, and with only 200 units at the resort, we enjoyed the beach and restaurants almost entirely to ourselves. The privacy and lack of crowds were a significant plus for us.

The kids had a fantastic time at Club Hyatt, participating in various activities such as oil painting, soap making, clay modeling, crab catching, tent making with coconut leaves, and even climbing coconut trees. This allowed us to have much-needed time to ourselves, knowing our children were well taken care of and entertained.

Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with this resort. The excellent service, clean facilities, and engaging activities for kids made our stay unforgettable. I highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for a relaxing and family-friendly vacation in China.

msg:My review is based on the price and quality ratio. Since this resort is one of the most expensive in Sanya, I would certainly expect certain standards:

+
The rooms and ocean view was nice a clean.
The environment, lounges, library are all fascinating especially with several decor of different artists.

Breakfast was nice in pair with other international 5 stars brands, the bread was my favorite. Suggesting to go before 8:30am or it will get super crowded.



-
The service was nonexistent. They barely greet you.
It was hard to get proper information even in Chinese

At the bar they didn‚Äôt even have LEMON, I asked perhaps the restaurant might have had it, but the staff repeatedly mentioned that it was out of stock. Interesting‚Ä¶

Mini bar food was poor. Just sweet items

Indoor pool changing room locker didn‚Äôt work,
Everything time I went to take a shower, the shower gel dispenser was empty in both showers and one of the shower didn‚Äôt work properly.

I would like to mention that we are talking about ‚ÄòPark Hyatt‚Äô

‚ÄòPrivate beach‚Äô beds were limited and seems that everyone could go there, since there is another access for the public. 

Well, overall. The rooms and environment are interesting, however I wouldn‚Äôt go back again for the reasons mentioned above‚Ä¶.

üè∞interior of the castle is incredible. Every small detail is so beautiful. The only minus is that hotel is huge, so you have to walk a lot, and it‚Äôs easy to get lost in the first days.
ü•òfood depends on the place. The foreign restaurant totally disappointed me,. Not that many dishes, hot, strong smell because of open kitchen and compare to the rest of the hotel, interior isn‚Äôt good üëé. Breakfast at that place have very few options of food. 
On the other hand, the Chinese restaurant looks great, match the hotel and during breakfast has big choice.üëç
In room dining is mediocre, forgot to put addons that we were asking for, in salad was too much souse. 
üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èspa is great, totally recommended!

The 130m swimming pool is the signature of the hotel. We need to change 2-3 times elevator in order to get to Our room. The view is so spectacular which makes you feel like you are wow. The hotel looks like a maze in a art gallery so we got lost all the time. It took us a while to know all the ways to the lobby.

The staff was great, many speaks English. I want to give a special recommendation and thanks to Ira from the pool restaurant and to July from the Hot pot restaurant. We had some minor issues but I believe all the staff is doing their best. The interior of the hotel is amazing and relaxing. The kids club is good yet they can promote it more and have more unpaid activities. If I come back to Sanya, I will definitely stay in this hotel.

msg:Facilities: It is not a parent-child hotel. I am traveling with 3 adults, which is good. Although there are still children, it is much better than other hotels. The facilities are excellent. The style of the whole hotel is very design-oriented, and it feels solemn and majestic. The lights are not very bright, which I like. Toto automatic toilet, Lefen hair dryer, Le Labo washing and care set, except soap and lotion are small packages, the others are large packages~ The No. 22 of the whole Park Hyatt, bergamot series, the fragrance is good, very healing. 5‚≠ê

Hygiene: Cleaning is very timely. If you turn on the do not disturb mode, the cleaning lady will leave a card at the door, and you can tell the cleaning time at a convenient time. And if there are any special notes, you can call the front desk to inform it. I have experienced it, and the notes are all completed with care~4‚≠ê and a half

Environment: Park Hyatt‚Äôs environment is excellent. Platinum follows the shooting, and every photo is very good. The scenery is really amazing. And the beach is different from others. There are hotel staff watching, so everything should be cleaner. When I passed by for breakfast in the morning, there were staff members who cleaned up the fallen flowers in the pool in time. 5‚≠ê
Service: This is really beyond words!! Fiona is very nice!! Although I saw comments before that there is no butler for non-villa rooms, it is not true. It is just that there is no dedicated person in charge. It is understandable, after all, the occupancy rate is still very high. But Fiona is still very responsible. During the stay, she will send WeChat to ask what is not satisfactory, or if there is anything else she needs to help communicate. It is really a good experience~ During the stay, Qingbuliang was also sent. Because there was not enough manpower, it was not delivered on the same day. I was still saying sorry to me after get off work in the evening, and I specially sent 3 coconuts for free the next day! YYDS! I was given a small gift before leaving~ Thank you so much~
I stayed in Park Hyatt for a total of 4 days and 3 nights. I booked a Supreme Sea View King Room. Because there were 3 adults staying, an extra bed was added. It was 700/person per day including breakfast, which I can accept. And the room is very large, and it doesn‚Äôt feel tight to add a bed~ The minibar is all free, replenished every day, and there are 3 small desserts in the afternoon. All requirements were met. There was a special person to lead the way for breakfast every day. When the TV was turned on, it would say who checked in. When I called the front desk, they would directly say Ms. So-and-so. It made me feel very good. Except for going back to rest at night, I didn't stay in the hotel much. Because I have to accompany my parents to visit the attractions üòÖ I will definitely stay here again to experience it. Recommended! 
The view of 1128 is amazing! ! ! You must choose this room type! ! There are 3 rooms on the entire floor, and the privacy is absolutely amazing!

msg:This is not a review, this is a paper, the title is "On how to eat down the beautiful Sun Bay Park Hyatt Hotel". Hahaha, I almost burst out laughing. I arrived at Sun Bay Park Hyatt Hotel at noon on the 23rd, and was assigned room 5511. I like it very much, which meets my requirements of "higher floors, non-front and rear rooms, far from the elevator and close to the beach". My Park Hyatt master Lisen talked to me about the main facilities and routes for a long time, but I couldn't remember them at all. Haha, I really can't remember them. I just remember that the tall foreign receptionist was very beautiful. I asked to visit the sea view room and saw 5901. I think 5511 is still the most cost-effective.
I changed my clothes and came out of the room. I followed other guests to the elevator in a daze and was confused again. Fortunately, I met Zeng Weiyu, a handsome boy. He took me around very enthusiastically and told me slowly how to find the elevator, how to find the observation deck, how to find the restaurant, and took me there one by one. Finally, he sent me to my favorite beach and took a picture of his name tag with his permission.
The beach is so beautiful! This is why I came to Sun Bay Park Hyatt Hotel.
Isn't it because I'm old and greedy for money and afraid of death that I don't sleep enough? I reported to the Yue Hall before 6 o'clock in the morning on the 24th. I went to the beach first, came back to eat, and then went to the beach again. At 11 o'clock in the morning, I wanted to pack coffee to go back to the room, but breakfast was not over yet, so I ate some more hahaha. The same thing happened on the morning of the 25th. I won't tell you that I ate three Benedict eggs, they were so delicious! Benedict eggs are comparable to those of Waldorf Astoria Shanghai.
The Hainanese chicken rice delivered to the room at noon on the 23rd was also delicious. (This is considered to be treated by Ctrip haha. Because I called the Park Hyatt Hotel and learned that "the beach is no longer purely private" and asked to cancel the reservation but was rejected, Ctrip officially subsidized me 200 yuan) Here, I want to say that the girl who answered the phone can't speak. How to answer her can refer to the wording of the tall and handsome executive of the front office of the room director.
Let me talk about Lisen, my Park Hyatt ambassador. During my stay, she was on vacation. She arranged it very well. She replied to me on WeChat at any time and gave me surprises at any time. She gave me fruits when I checked in, made a night bed, and gave me various desserts (chocolate, macarons, qingbuliang, coconut), free sleep-aid fragrance, and a gift for leaving the hotel. She reminded me in time to participate in the happy hours on the observation deck. Chen Guoliang also gave me Park Hyatt's homemade vanilla ice cream.
On the 25th, Lisen helped me apply for a delayed check-out until 2 pm, so that I could go to the beach after lunch without any worries. The surprise on the beach was that I caught the tall and handsome guy in the front office of the Sun Bay Park Hyatt Hotel, the room director. Haha, I complained to him that I couldn't have dinner because I left the hotel at 6 pm. He went to verify it, and then came back in person to tell me that I could go to the Tea Garden for dinner.
The regret of this trip is that three days and two nights are too short. Next time, I can stay comfortably for a week.

It is very beautiful and textured, and is very suitable for couples or individuals who want to spend a quiet vacation away from the hustle and bustle. The room is also very clean, and the solid wood floor is well maintained. Although the toiletries are all in large bottles, I like the smell very much~ Sun Bay Beach is the whitest, cleanest, and finest beach I have seen during my vacation in Sanya this time. Although it seems to be open to the public now, there are very few people on the beach because it is the off-season. The hotel also arranged lounge chairs for rest on the beach. The sea is a glass sea, very transparent. I originally planned to go to Xidao to see the glass sea, but I gave up the trip directly hahahahaha. My housekeeper fairy is very good. If you need something, just tell the housekeeper directly, and it will be solved quickly. This time I went alone to celebrate my birthday, and the housekeeper helped me arrange a small cake and red wine~ Very considerate~

Before check-in, the butler Lisen has been following up on the service, asking when to arrive and if there are any special requirements. Thank you very much for Lisen's full service, it's so thoughtful. I was amazed by the view when I entered the room. It's really a surprise to arrange my birthday at Park Hyatt. The little brother at the beach pool is also very good. He will take the initiative to give you a bath towel and ask you if you want ice water or room temperature. I forgot what it was called, windsurfing is really fun! The bar is also very cost-effective. Drink until closing time.

The white beach is really the powder sand mentioned on the Internet, soft and clean, not many people, and the privacy is still very good. It is also very enjoyable to stay in the hotel to watch the sea and swim.
The service is also very good. The housekeeper who added WeChat responded quickly and responded to every request. When walking around the hotel, the staff passing by would smile and say hello, and the emotional value was full. During the stay, drinks, fruits, desserts and other food were delivered. It was more convenient to order takeout and travel than expected.
The quality of the hotel is worth the price. It is highly recommended if the budget is sufficient.

You can go to the sea. Park Hyatt has the best service, good food and the best environment. It gives people a very relaxing feeling. The largest children's water park in Atlantis was closed without notifying us in advance. The food in Edition is average and the price is still very expensive.

msg:Only when I came to Park Hyatt, my trip to Sanya was complete.

Before I checked in, the housekeeper Lisen contacted me in advance. When the car arrived at the hotel entrance, the receptionist came over and moved the luggage. It was scary to take a child out with so much luggage! The luggage cart sent me directly to the room. Knowing that I was traveling with an 11-month-old baby, Lisen checked me in quickly. We booked two rooms. Lisen was waiting for me when I checked in at the front desk, and then accompanied me to choose a room. After confirming the room type, he prepared a baby bed. He also sent a cake on the baby's birthday. All needs were handled in a timely manner. Park Hyatt has many types of breakfast and is delicious. When they met the staff on the road, they would also greet them attentively. The auntie was also super nice. Knowing that the baby needed to make milk, she sent me a lot of water every day. The singer on the observation deck sang very well, and the baby was a loyal fan.

Park Hyatt is very big. We stayed in the hotel to play. Lisen also prepared a stroller for me. It was very convenient to take the baby to visit the hotel and eat.

I will come to Park Hyatt again next time. The housekeeper Lisen is enthusiastic and professional. Thank you.

The service is getting better and better every year. I am happier every year.
This trip was for my son's first birthday, so I came to the hotel specifically. Whether it is the service environment, it is always the best in Sanya.
This time, I booked a 2-bedroom villa with a swimming pool. It is really private and not noisy at all. You can play whatever you want. I decorated the room. I had a very happy first birthday.

Service: This time I met a very, very good butler. He served us throughout the whole process and was very patient. I just asked specifically, his name is Wang Fei, I hope I can meet him again next time.

msg:Park Hyatt Hotel lived up to expectations as always ~ The average value of the Hyatt team is very high ~ This time I took my baby to Park Hyatt Sanya for a few days on vacation, actually it was to have fewer people, so that the little friends could wade in the sea and play in the sand with fewer people. Special thanks to the two young ladies, one is the housekeeper Fiona ~ She is attentive and considerate, and meets many of the needs of the little friends. The other is the young lady in the Chinese restaurant (I don‚Äôt know her name) who always finds the little baby to play with for a while every breakfast and dinner. She really likes children ~ Next time I come to Sanya with my family, I will choose Park Hyatt again ~

The white sand beach and 130-meter infinity pool are extremely private. No one can enter without a hotel reservation or visiting guests. The hotel is built on the mountain, facing the sea with its back to the mountain. The scenery is pleasant. The hotel's breakfast is also great. 1700 points every night. There are free cocktails and snacks on the viewing platform. Facing the sea, a drink is a special flavor. There is also a thoughtful butler service. The butler will call the day before check-in to ask if there are any requirements. We brought a baby with us. The butler provided great help during the stay. In addition, the hotel's travel photography is also very good, recording our wonderful vacation time.

Service: Little Red Potato is a bit anxious. From the warm reception of the check-in concierge to the attentive service of the hotel butler, the whole family is very satisfied.

She kept in touch with us throughout the whole process. The service was really nice. The hotel is indeed a different view at every step. The 130m swimming pool is the most satisfactory.

msg:The environment is good. The hotel and the housekeeper Lisen contacted one day in advance and helped record the license plate number for free parking in advance. Otherwise, you can't park in the hotel and you will be charged. As for the netizens' comments that the room decoration style is old, I think it is acceptable. The room is relatively large, and the housekeeper reserved a room on a higher floor for the convenience of sea view. The layout of the hotel is indeed like an art gallery, but it is too maze. Although the map was introduced in detail when checking in, I still went wrong many times and it took a day to get familiar with the road. The free drinks and snacks at the room bar are quite rich, and they are replenished every day. Fruits and snacks are delivered every day. The housekeeper also delivered a few Qingbuliang one night. The free drinks and snacks at the observation deck every afternoon are good, the environment is good, and sometimes there are two foreigners singing performances. Next to the breakfast restaurant is the longest outdoor swimming pool, which is open until 10 pm. It is the kind that goes from diving to deep. One thing about their family is that if there are multiple adults, whether there is an extra bed or not, breakfast or not, you must add 700 yuan per night. There are no other facilities around the hotel. It would be inconvenient if you don't have a car. It would take at least 20 minutes to drive out to find food.

The recreational facilities are also well designed, especially for swimming in the swimming pool and the beach. There will be lifeguards and service staff to prepare towels. The sand on the beach is also very fine, and the sea water is quite clear, but because it is cloudy, the feeling of the glass sea is not shown.
The attitude of the service staff is also very good. The parent-child activities are rich in content, interesting, and very interactive. There is a foreigner leading the team, who is very good at creating an a**osphere and the children are very happy.
The service of the housekeeper is also very detailed and considerate.
Although there are not too many choices for breakfast, the service is very good. At least they will not take me to measure my height when they see me with two children (some hotels are very disgusting in this regard. They don‚Äôt make it clear when checking in, and they insist on measuring their height when eating breakfast in the morning. A group of guests see your child being measured, as if you want to escape the bill, which is really embarrassing!), in fact, how much a child can eat, just one or two bags plus a glass of milk, it‚Äôs not a matter of money, it‚Äôs not a matter of detailed service, Park Hyatt does this very well!

msg:It's rare to write a serious review, this review is for Park Hyatt!
I have been to Sanya dozens of times and stayed in many hotels. This is the first time I chose Park Hyatt. The online reviews were not ideal in the early stage, and I had some concerns in my heart. Later I realized that everything was unnecessary!
1. Two days before check-in, the hotel staff called me to confirm the flight number, number of people, hotel room location, sleeping pillow preferences, etc., and added WeChat housekeeper fairy
2. Pick up at the airport on the day of check-in. The front desk introduced the various areas and routes of the hotel in detail. It is indeed a bit complicated. I have to walk a little to understand it. They also gave me mosquito repellent stickers. The bites of the small insects here are more itchy than mosquitoes. I didn't bite them after I put them on
3. The mini bar is rich, and fruits and desserts are given. It is recommended to choose a room with a balcony. It doesn't matter whether you can see the sea or not. I personally don't like the more closed space. There is lavender sleeping spray next to the pillow... The details are still very good
4. The public area and the beach are nothing to say. It is the best in Sanya. At first glance, I thought of the sea and sand in the Philippines. It is transparent and the sand is as fine as ash... At night, when the tide recedes, I take my children to catch crabs, small fish and shrimps. It is a good parent-child experience! Breakfast: Thumbs up! There are not many varieties, but I really think every one of them is delicious. The yogurt is from Kashi, and Yakult is standard.
5. About the staff: front desk, concierge, room service, public area aunt, lifeguard, restaurant staff, all politely nodded and greeted, I don‚Äôt know why some people think the attitude is bad
6. Special praise for the housekeeper Fairy. I thought it was just like other hotel housekeepers, just add WeChat. This is the first time I really experienced the housekeeper service in China. She took the initiative to greet on the day of check-in, sent a set of beach toys to the children, and arranged to send them if they like latex pillows. On the first night, she took the initiative to send us a set of double-layer afternoon tea for the children... and asked for feedback on the stay. On the second night, she sent three cool supplements to the room for our family of three. The most important thing is that because the children have to do homework, there are homework for various subjects that need to be printed at any time. It will be delivered in a short time after sending it at any time, which makes me embarrassed. For the first time, the child took the initiative to say that he likes this sister very much. She is beautiful and enthusiastic! I made a small figurine for fairy. On the day of check-out, the parents and children sent us to the door and gave us a small figurine! I hope the hotel management will cherish such excellent employees!

I have left a deep impression x, I believe I will visit again soon!

Let's talk about the service. The service staff is quite enthusiastic when entering the lobby. The Qinyuan breakfast is good. It is very comfortable to eat breakfast by the window!
In terms of hygiene, I think the carpet inside the room really needs to be cleaned well. There are a lot of stains. The biggest dissatisfaction of this trip is that no one reminded that there are a lot of gnats in the outdoor swimming pool. Standing there for ten minutes, the two calves and arms are horrible. There are more than fifty bags of all sizes. It is really itchy and uncomfortable. I have been to so many hotels in Sanya. This is the first time I have encountered this situation, which adds a haze to the beautiful trip!

Luxurious European and Chinese breakfasts, many types of fruit, coffee with oat milk, delicious pastries and bread, salmon. Already in the evening I was dreaming about breakfast, since there are difficulties with food in China)). Knowledge of the language leaves much to be desired (English or Russian), a couple of people in the entire hotel do not know or understand the word at all. There were few umbrellas and sunbeds, but there were almost always places available. Non-hotel guests occupy umbrellas and sunbeds and relax as if at home. Of course the hotel should keep an eye on this. The menu in a European restaurant can be made more extensive.

msg:Advantages:
This hotel by a famous designer did not disappoint in terms of experience
The a**osphere was quiet and the exclusive beach was also very clean
The indoor and outdoor swimming pools were clean and beautiful
The maze-like corridors were full of artistic a**osphere, and you could still enjoy it even if you got lost
The new Chinese-style rooms found a perfect balance between Chinese classical and Western simplicity, and the design and matching of windows and mirrors were also very clever
The service experience was generally satisfactory except for the check-in stage

Disadvantages:
The check-in experience was not good. I arrived at the hotel at around 1:00 p.m. The front desk first gave me a room on the fifth floor and said it had a good view. When I asked about the direction, I was told that it was facing the building. After communication, I was given another room , but was told that no room could be checked in, and that I had to wait for notification, and that I could not be upgraded. The explanation was very vague. I understood that although there were rooms available, they would not upgrade the rooms booked by Ctrip. Their attitude was also quite arrogant. Finally, they notified me to check in at 14:59. In short, I did not understand this series of operations. As a service staff, convenience for guests is the top priority. Since they asked me about my room requirements and told you, they should not give me a room with such a bad orientation. Secondly, there were rooms one level lower, but they could not be flexible and not upgrade the rooms. They had to make the guests wait for one minute before they could check in. I think it was a bit of a embarrassment on purpose. Is it necessary? Besides, the discrimination on this platform is quite funny. I booked through the platform for convenience. I have also stayed at the Park Hyatt Maldives, which costs 10,000 yuan per night. What is there to discriminate? Where does the sense of superiority come from?

Hotel training staff should be friendly and enthusiastic, and don't always show off, which will give people a sense of artificial drama

After the final processing, I felt that you should stay in whatever room you are given, and wait as long as you are asked to wait. Don't ask too much, asking is asking for trouble, so I can only respond with a rating, after all, I don't buy this set and don't like to wait

Then add that in order to distinguish it from the villa area service, it is not called a butler here, but a Yuexiang Ambassador. The ambassador's service is basically in place

In general, in the environment where the overall service of Hainan hotels cannot keep up, Park Hyatt has done a good job. The service of the restaurant, swimming pool and guest room is very good. If there is no unpleasantness during check-in, this will be a perfect experience

msg:Service: Fairy, my housekeeper, is so considerate, warm and careful. She gave me a hat to protect me from the sun when I went to take photos. I got a lot of bites on my legs at Mandarin Oriental but no one cared. Fairy saw me as soon as I checked in at Park Hyatt and gave me mosquito repellent stickers. She also gave me delicious Qingbuliang at night and actively coordinated the travel time for me. She really solves problems for everyone and responds quickly to any needs. Before leaving, she gave me a cute doll of the hotel. This is really a model in the industry. Other hotel housekeeper services should be comparable to Park Hyatt.
Facilities, hygiene, and catering are all very good, and they are all Park Hyatt's usual high-end configuration and style.
The hotel environment is good and the design style is online. It is really a tasteful hotel. I am still not satisfied after staying here. I will come again next time.

1. The outdoor swimming pool is very good, 130 meters long, and the swimming experience is very good;
2. The sea water is relatively clear. We can see a lot of fish when we snorkel directly from the hotel beach, even more than on Baifu Island, but we need to swim far away;
3. The breakfast is rich, with many choices and the taste is also good.
Disadvantages:
1. The room arranged for us this time is in Building 2, and the view is not particularly good, which is not satisfactory;
2. No fruit was delivered on the day of check-in;
3. The hygiene of some details and blind spots is not in place.

The magnificent beauty of Sun Bay outside the window is presented in the guest room like a painting. The design without balcony is "anti-Sanya" to a certain extent. The design of a different way needs to be quietly appreciated. Although the beach hotel is no longer exclusive, the sand is fine and does not prick your feet, the color of the sea water is also great, and the more than 100-meter outdoor swimming pool is really amazing. There are only more than 200 rooms in the whole hotel, scattered in different buildings, which keep a relative distance and will not affect each other. The catering level and staff service are very online. Thanks to fairy for the good service throughout the whole journey, and sent desserts every night and small gifts at the end. A great trip!

msg:During my stay, I was scratched by a broken protruding sharp object from the hotel's mobile shower head. I then communicated with the hotel manager and was delayed until checkout on the grounds that I had to report it to my superiors. I just wanted to ask the guest to accept my apology by sending red wine and a spa in a formal way. I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal. The more I thought about it, the more annoyed I became. Such a big hotel is owned by Hyatt. This is an apology and sincerity. I took a shower and almost cut an artery. Haha. Moreover, the hotel knew that I had to check out on the 23rd. I am given free afternoon tea and free dinner on the 23rd. Can this be achieved? I can only ask 12315 for help. I look forward to a fair and just answer from the market supervision depar**ent. Oh, by the way, the hotel also wants me to upgrade to a suite for free next time. What do you think about this? How will it be handled? Will I come back next time? In my opinion, a room fee of 3,000 or 30,000 or whatever has nothing to do with the expectations of the experience. It is estimated that this hotel will encounter such large and small hurtful incidents in a day. It is not uncommon for a few people to have such a disapproving attitude. I would like to remind you to be cautious when choosing Park Hyatt for vacation with children. It seems that the hotel hardware facilities are not properly maintained. Now it seems that the harm caused to customers has to be paid for by themselves. I deserve it. I must be sincere now. The purpose of writing you a great review is to use this review to subvert customers' perception of the Park Hyatt Hotel. The experience is really bad to the extreme.
Here‚Äôs another little tip. There are so many cockroaches and midges in the hotel. Basking in the sun by the hotel pool is like falling into a nest of bugs. I got 15 bites in two hours. It‚Äôs extremely itchy. Let‚Äôs forget it. Now I‚Äôm so swollen that I doubt my life.

Mainly on the beach in the morning and evening, I didn't see anyone throwing it actively during these two time periods, so I guess it is likely to be drifted.

The hotel itself has a great sense of design. At first, I felt it was a bit difficult to remember the way, but after mastering the rules (the 2nd, 5th, and 6th floors can connect to each other), I will never get lost. And every corner is a good photo, which is good news for photography enthusiasts.
The hotel can also make an appoin**ent for art explanations at 11 o'clock every day, which successfully increased a little bit of artistic literacy.
In addition, our housekeeper fairy sister is super awesome, and gave us Qingbuliang and coconut for free. Qingbuliang tastes great, it is a dish of the hotel tea garden, and I personally feel that it beats a lot of Internet celebrity stores outside.

Walking in the corridor, you can enjoy the carefully designed landscaping on both sides. It is different during the day and night. It is worth walking more.
Fairy, the butler, contacted me early and answered all my questions. She did a good job in service. There is free flow of water and drinks in the room. Even if you bring your children, you won't be able to finish them all. When I needed to replenish supplies, they were delivered immediately after just one phone call, which is worthy of praise.

You can forgive the whole world for sitting on the beach for half a day. The hotel itself is large and full of design. Although service staff are not everywhere, there are details everywhere. It is the hidden service that I like. I would like to give a thumbs up to the butler Fairy. If you need anything, just contact her directly. The response is very fast.

The mango milkshake for breakfast was great, but the pasta and preserved egg and lean meat porridge had no taste. I hope the staple food can be improved. This trip was originally planned to be a solo trip to relax. Later, when my colleagues heard about it, we immediately made an appoin**ent. The addition of friends gave me many more blockbuster movies in my life. Overall, I am very satisfied and highly recommend everyone to stay at Park Hyatt Sun Bay.

msg:Room 5502 can barely see a little bit of the sea, and there is a sp**** vegetable garden downstairs, which is a bit unsightly. The sand on the beach is relatively fine, but if you come here, you will regret it. The beach is right opposite the hotel, which is okay. If you walk to the side, it is full of garbage. No less than Baylong Bay, the coastline is full of hotels, each sweeping away the snow in front of their doors. Originally, I wanted to directly swim, snorkel, and watch fish in the safe area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel. But because there were waves that day and there was sand in the sea water, I couldn‚Äôt see anything clearly. There are also rocks in the safe area, which are a bit dangerous. There are waves under the sea water, and it is difficult for people to stand firmly. Occasionally, your feet may step on those rocks, so you must wear beach shoes. The sea water is clear, but there are many small sea****s in the sea water. There is no sea**** in the sea water of Yalong Bay.

The carpet in the room is what bothers me the most in a room worth more than 2,000 yuan. The carpet should not be so dirty.

The 20-meter swimming pool is a special feature, but it is not constant temperature and is a bit cold.

The butler service is good and the hotel staff are nice and enthusiastic, but the front desk is a bit cold and needs improvement.

When the tide is low at the beach at the entrance, you can catch the sea and go inside. At 5 o'clock in the morning, there are many prawns and sea white shrimps, which are very big. Some are on the rocks and some are in the water. They lie on the sand very quickly and disappear in 2 seconds.

The minibar is good, much better than AT. The service is also better than Ate. I haven‚Äôt booked breakfast because the price difference for breakfast was 400üò¢ when I booked the room. Takeaway is very convenient, and the grouper served by Buzike is delicious.

It's okay to stay for one day but it will be boring for two days. The scenery on the road leading in and out of the hotel is so beautiful. There are big beauties and a lot of sports cars to see on the roadside. The scenery is beautiful and the cars are beautiful. It's them who blocked the road.

msg:After hesitating for a long time, I scored 5 points for service. These 5 points were given to Manager Yuan and Manager Xiao Jia.
I booked the Park Hyatt Hotel for the 29th and 32nd nights on the ***** calendar on January 14th. When I arrived at the hotel, I was told that dinner would not be available until after nine o'clock. I asked the hotel: I booked for thirty nights because I wanted to spend my thirties at the hotel. Why? It's been nearly a month since I placed my order, and no one has contacted me in advance to tell me that dinner needs to be reserved in advance. And the elderly cannot wait until nine o'clock for the second meal. In this case, I cannot accept the hotel's service. While communicating with Manager Xiao Li for 2 hours, I insisted on checking out... The hotel disagreed. I kept insisting that if I booked the Park Hyatt in advance on New Year's Eve, wouldn't it be just to have a reunion dinner? Could it be that the only hotel we stayed in was so remote that two elderly people over 60 years old couldn't have a reunion dinner on the night of the 30th? You made a mistake first, why can't you check out? Finally used everything and finally checked out.
Because Park Hyatt is in a remote location, and it‚Äôs almost Chinese New Year. I opened all the ride-hailing apps, but there were no rides. While we were waiting for an hour and a half, the hotel's air conditioner was so cold that we were shaking all over. No one came to care about us. We didn't have any humanity at all! ? Finally, I made a call for help and had to go back and forth several times to communicate with manager Xiao Li at the front desk. I don‚Äôt know whether Manager Xiao Li is the temporary manager or just like this. He has a very poor sense of responsibility. His professional standards are far from those of the Park Hyatt Hotel. He needs to improve.
We both fell ill when we came back. We went to the Park Hyatt Sanya for the first time and spent the Spring Festival of 2024 like this.
On the first day of the new year, I went to the hotel again to report the situation, and received warm service from Manager Yuan: not a single strong word; he always patiently listened to my expressions and appeals. It gradually relieved the anger in my heart.
This time I booked the Park Hyatt Hotel again and really experienced the hotel's environment, facilities, hygiene, and excellent service. Manager Xiao Jia's service was very good. He patiently drew the hotel's logo and took us familiar with the hotel. Very friendly to the elderly, thank you, Manager Xiao Jia.
I hope that in the future, Park Hyatt will serve travelers wholeheartedly and its managers will be dedicated to their industry. Travelers cannot be made to feel that there is a huge difference between managers. My cold is still not cured.
It‚Äôs great to take pictures in Bojue, thumbs up for the photographer! When selecting films, Wanwan did not forcefully buy or sell them, which was very considerate.

Hygiene: Perfect. When I went to eat in the morning, I could see staff everywhere maintaining hygiene. The room was cleaned in a timely manner. Except for the carpet being a bit old, the hygiene in other aspects was impeccable.
Service: It‚Äôs great. I added WeChat the day before check-in and there are some thoughtful tips. Welcome fruits and coconuts are provided when you check-in.

The beach is dirty, and beach chairs are used casually by people outside the hotel. There were many fewer crabs on the rocky beach last year, and the public changing rooms are also very dirty. Suspicious, this issue needs to be managed by the hotel. Several restaurants are still very delicious. Apart from the breakfast, I am very satisfied with the twelve meals in four days. The breakfast pastries are very good. However, the cart with special local delicacies last year disappeared this year, but the pancake and fruit stalls remain. ; The portion of the tea garden served for the New Year‚Äôs Eve dinner was so large that it was impossible to finish it. For the rest, nothing has changed much. The rooms are still the same, the services are still the same, the peach blossoms are still the same, and the big chrysanthemum in the lobby is still the same.

When checking in, the hotel staff enthusiastically handed everyone warm water, took the initiative to help us carry our luggage to the room, introduced the room facilities in detail, and also delivered freshly made desserts, snacks and fresh fruits from the restaurant. When I returned to the room at night, in addition to the same turn-down service as in other luxury hotels, there was also a bottle of sleep aid spray. On our way to the restaurant in the evening, we met a hotel employee in the elevator and casually asked "how to get to the restaurant." The employee enthusiastically took us directly to the restaurant instead of just telling us how to get there. The housekeeper Fairy and the person in charge Jia Ershao were very enthusiastic and professional. They not only upgraded the room type for free, but also provided timely support when we needed help. Every hotel employee will smile and say hello when they see you, and other guests in restaurants and other public places will also communicate softly. You like this kind of comfortable space. This is a feeling that can only be found in platinum-diamond hotels. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the sea view. You can see the unparalleled sea view through the huge glass window in the room (see photo). The sea water is clear and translucent near, and gradually turns blue with increasing depth in the distance. When you walk on the beach, your feet are pure white. The fine sand and the gentle sound of water are in your ears. Only by experiencing it yourself can you feel the beauty. Looking forward to seeing my family here again next time.

When I came to Sanya, I changed hotels one day just to experience the hotels on Ctrip's luxury list. The prices on the luxury list are all about the same. The Park Hyatt is the most annoying hotel. The service is extremely poor. The hotel is like a maze. I can't find it after walking around a few times. The kind of road where Didi took a taxi for an hour and no one took the order. The location is too far away. The hotel‚Äôs business car charges 500 yuan to go to Haitang Bay. What about grabbing money? In the end, there was no way to ask the front desk to help us call a taxi that was 100 more expensive than the Didi platform. Otherwise, we would not be able to get out of Sun Bay. The first room was not given to us until after 3 o'clock on the day of check-in, and the second room was not cleaned until 5:30. For us, the room price was more than 4,000, and we didn‚Äôt check in until after 5 o‚Äôclock. When we checked out, the front desk didn‚Äôt apologize at all. The weirdest thing was that when we arrived at the next hotel, we were told that our documents had not been canceled by Park Hyatt, so we checked in. No, we've been gone for two full hours, and they didn't even help us check out. The room is so small, and the management is so crazy! The most bizarre thing is that we went to the wrong place for breakfast in the morning, and the waiter blocked us from the door and said, "We only accept villa guests here, and your ordinary rooms are in another restaurant. There is no training in speaking skills. We looked embarrassed." We left with embarrassed faces. The breakfast was also terrible. The hot soy milk was cold. After being asked, it was served lukewarm, not hot. The breakfast options were very limited. In short, this hotel did not make people happy. A little bit of satisfaction! Extremely bad! The washroom near the afternoon tea on the second floor is extremely dirty. I have never seen such a dirty restroom before. If you live in the Park Hyatt, be prepared to step into some pitfalls. I will be pissed off... The employees must be untrained, cold and cold without any warmth | Park Hyatt is finished, I feel sorry for the boss

If it weren‚Äôt for the postponement of the trip, I would have stayed here for a few more nights. The mini bar is very good and it is probably the best in Sanya. The drinking water provided is also very good and the scenery is charming

If you like a quiet vacation, there are a few activities. It is not a family hotel, but there are a lot of children these days. The housekeeper Stella provides full service and communication. They are all very good, please praise them! It is still necessary for Bo Jue to follow you and take photos, so that you can perfectly record the beautiful scenery you see in your own eyes!

The view is beautiful, the pool villa is so beautiful, the facilities are good, the 24-hour service is very attentive, all snacks are free, small desserts will be given in the afternoon, and a bowl full of fruit will be given in the evening , and milk, freshly squeezed watermelon juice and coconut juice. When the children were sick at night, they ordered medicine, which was delivered in time, and they also made ginger tea. The sand on the beach is also very fine and very comfortable to walk on. The waves at Sun Bay are very big. Although you can't go into the sea, it looks really beautiful. The hotel's travel photographer, Earl, is also great at taking photos. He is great at producing photos. I like it very much and recommend it~

msg:After staying at the Ritz-Carlton for four days and the Park Hyatt for three days, there are three main points to compare: 1. The lobby of the Ritz-Carlton has a particularly messy feeling, and the queues are messy. There is only one check-in entrance and if You wouldn't know what it is for unless you ask. The first thing you notice when entering the lobby of Park Hyatt is that the fragrance smells very fresh, which calms down your irritable mind. It is also very convenient to have several check-in windows.
In terms of food, the Ritz-Carlton is better in this regard. The breakfast is rich, including beef rice noodles, Western food, and Japanese food. As a foodie, I went to the buffet three or four times in three consecutive days, and there was no repetition every time. Yes, and there is a night market near the hotel. Although the taste is average, the price is quite suitable compared to the hotel. The grilled durian is delicious! The Park Hyatt Hotel is relatively inferior. Although the breakfast has fewer varieties, it is very hot, including bread. It will be repeated twice. Due to the remote location, you can only have lunch and dinner in the hotel. The price is a bit expensive. The Chinese restaurant It's very average. The western restaurant is quite delicious. The hot pot restaurant tastes really good. I like it. The chicken in the coconut chicken hot pot is freshly fried (although it is written about the experience of the Park Hyatt Hotel, but the Ritz-Carlton includes the nearby markets in general. Really great and convenient)
Regarding accommodation and hotel experience, the Park Hyatt Hotel beats the Ritz-Carlton. The Park Hyatt Hotel is as comfortable and comfortable as an art museum. You feel very relaxed as soon as you enter. There is also a smart toilet in the room, and we live in a 10th-floor building with sea views. Very nice. You really don‚Äôt have to worry about five buildings. The ocean view from one is already great and it‚Äôs relatively close to various entertainment facilities. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that Park Hyatt has an indoor swimming pool! ! It‚Äôs not very warm in Hainan these days and you can‚Äôt swim in the 130-meter large swimming pool outside (what a pity), but the indoor swimming pool is still warm and the water is very comfortable to swim in after breakfast in the morning. No one is there. The Park Hyatt also has a private beach with fine sand. The sea breeze is very comfortable, there are no busy people, and the privacy is great (I couldn't help but dance for a while). The only advantage of the Ritz-Carlton is that it has a large balcony. The room is really a bit old, and the room phone is very confusing. I contacted the front desk and didn't know what to do.
To sum up, if you want to travel around and have food requirements, stay at the Ritz-Carlton. If you want high-end enjoyment, go to the Park Hyatt (assuming you have some funds haha). Finally, it is recommended that you don‚Äôt rent a car when going to Sanya during the peak season, because Sanya‚Äôs peak season is There were a lot of cars on the road and it was very congested. When we went to Luhuitou, the traffic control stopped us halfway. We finally walked up. If we go to Sanya for about seven days, it is more suitable to stay at the Ritz-Carlton for the first four days because we can play everywhere. You can fully enjoy yourself by staying at the Park Hyatt for a few days, and the cost will not be too much. Finally, I am very grateful to the fairy housekeeper, who responds quickly and responds to all requests.

In the tourist peak where there are so many people, such quiet time alone is really rare. The service is excellent, especially the one-to-one butler service provided by Lisen throughout the entire stay, which is very considerate and warm. Next time I go to Sanya, Park Hyatt will still be my best choice.
The service was excellent
nice environment
The only drawback is that it is inconvenient to take a taxi, and you can only choose a fleet of vehicles cooperating with the hotel, and the price is 30% higher than Didi's private car.

The hotel also includes free happy hour cocktails and special red wine drinks in the afternoon, with different themes. The day we checked in, it was chocolate brownie dessert, which was delicious.
The hotel has a great sense of design and is very suitable for vacation. I will definitely come back in the future.

I arrived in advance and arranged a room in advance. In the evening, they contacted me promptly to deliver welcome fruit. I think this is very important. I have stayed at the St. Regis in Yalong Bay before and got a license plate number. They didn't register me until the evening. All the service staff at the front desk were very foreign and fawning over foreigners. In comparison, the service at Park Hyatt was much better. The service staff were very friendly and there weren't so many noisy Westerners.

Environment: Nothing to say. Sun Bay may be the only white beach after Yalong Bay was filled with sand. The hotel itself is also very designed and quiet. There will be no interruptions from selling small commodities on the beach.

Facilities: The hotel facilities are also relatively new. The smart toilet Toto and toiletries are all imported brands. The public areas are all Duravit, which is in line with this brand level positioning.

In addition, the breakfast is very good. This time I have chosen a Hyatt hotel. I will come here often in the future.

The most important thing is... the Park Hyatt has the best food among all the five-star hotels I have stayed in, and it is worth the price.
But let me tell you, the children's products in the hotel are really not good. I didn't bring them to my children when I went out this time. I didn't expect that they were not branded. Another problem is... Ctrip's premium users will not upgrade the room type if there are vacancies... hum.

There are two kinds of people in this world, those who have never been to Park Hyatt Sanya and those who have been. The former are wondering when to go there again, while the latter are wondering when to go there again. I went to Sanya in November this year and chose the Park Hyatt Hotel, one of the top five hotels. I saw many reviews in advance saying that the rooms were seriously aging, the service quality was average, the public area was too winding, the location was remote, etc. But I want to justify the charm it brings to me

price:
I bought the Ctrip Double 11 pre-sale package for two nights in a supreme sea view room + double breakfast for 6K+, but I paid the price difference of 400 on site to upgrade to a full sea view room. A free meal of your choice, free airport pick-up and drop-off service, and travel photography

Location:
It is located at the end of Sun Bay, passing through the most beautiful road in Sansanya. After the winding road, you will find another village with dark willows and bright flowers. The beautiful scenery of half a mountain and half a sea seems to open up a beautiful picture. There are tourists who drive by the road and take pictures beside the road.
Its remote location also makes it inconvenient to travel, eat and drink. It‚Äôs very suitable for lazy people like me who don‚Äôt like special forces going out;

Lobby and public area:
Before entering the hotel, the security guard at the door will check the check-in information before letting you in, ensuring privacy;
The hotel lobby is on the sixth floor, and cars can drive up;
The first thing that catches the eye inside the lobby is its red corridor;
The reception desk is on the left and right after entering the corridor;
The entire public area was built by JMG, the royal designer of Aman Group. The hotel itself is an art gallery, with every step of the way, full of details. More than 1,300 pieces of art are scattered throughout the hotel waiting for you to discover;
You can play in the public area to feel like you can escape from the room, which has also caused criticism.

Serve:
Special thanks to Crystal, the housekeeper from the Guest Experience Depar**ent. The young lady called one day in advance to inquire about check-in requirements and added my WeChat ID. When I arrived at the hotel, the young lady personally received me and took out a map to patiently explain to me the locations and opening hours of the entire public area, restaurants, swimming pools, beaches, etc., and arranged for the waiter to pick up my luggage and take me to the room. After arriving in the room, he explained the room layout and other matters to me. Any questions I had during the period, including restaurant reservations, travel photography, airport transportation, and room cleaning, were quickly responded to and arranged. After checking out, he gave me three beautiful postcards as a souvenir;
There are different good night desserts and fruits every day, and coconuts are also given to me;
When the room is cleaned, the clothes will be sorted for you. Things on the table, cosmetics, jewelry, etc. in the bathroom will be arranged for you, and even the charging cable of your mobile phone will be rolled up for you.

Room:
This time I stayed in a selected room with a full sea view, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã60 to 70 square meters;
The interior of the room adopts a new Chinese style, with wood and red as the main tone. However, the hotel is 15 years old, and even though it is well maintained, it still has a sense of age compared to other hotel rooms;
The room is not very large, but its bold design of abandoning the balcony and adopting narrow windows and mirrors highlights the designer's ingenuity. The narrow window and glass mirror extend the entire sea view, making the space more comfortable and creating a sea view pattern with a skyline. Also because the windows are long and narrow, the room appears to be very high;
The bathroom also uses the same long mirror pattern, which further enhances the sense of space.

Dining room:
There are three restaurants, namely Yueting (providing breakfast + hot pot in the evening), Tea Garden (Cantonese cuisine), and Qinyuan (Western food).
Breakfast is a buffet style, but compared to other hotels, the dishes may be less, but they can DIY tomato eggs or braised pork noodles, which is worthy of praise;
I ordered a steak at Qinyuan Western Food. The steak without any seasoning was quite salty, so you might not be able to bear it after the first few bites.
Yueting Hot Pot, my set meal was for two people. Because I was worried that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to finish it, I specifically told the waiter about the ingredients for one person, but I still couldn‚Äôt finish it. When I left, I saw that I had barely eaten any seafood. The waiter said He would ask me thoughtfully if the food didn‚Äôt suit my taste.

other:
Beach - Due to its geographical location, the hotel has an entire private beach, where you can swim directly in the sea, and various paid sea activities are provided next to it. The sand is very soft and the sea water is jelly sea. There was a beach party at the hotel but I didn‚Äôt participate;
Swimming pool - 130-meter-long infinity swimming pool and indoor heated swimming pool;
Gym - provides free morning yoga;
Observation Deck - Happy Hour is provided every evening, with free drinks, cocktails and snacks, and foreign singers singing on site, which is great for killing time.
No SPA experience but the price is reasonable

Summarize:
Park Hyatt Sanya is suitable for couples, photo parties, individuals escaping from the hustle and bustle of the city, and people who like quietness, but it is not suitable for parents and children. Care must be taken when bringing children, and special forces tour groups should also be cautious. You need to slow down and experience it carefully here;
Taking pictures takes a lot of energy. I spent two hours taking pictures as a boy. There are so many beautiful places;
If you can, bring your loved one with you and come to this hotel to experience the time that belongs to you two.

msg:Let‚Äôs talk about my Park Hyatt experience
‚ù∂The hotel is very large. It is more of a scenic spot than a hotel. It is very private and has exclusive access to the entire bay and beach of Sun Bay. If possible, it is recommended to choose the high floor of Building 5. You will know it after you stay here. Tips: You can leave the curtains open, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about privacy, and the sun won‚Äôt dazzle your eyes. The boundless sea view will amaze you when you open your eyes the next day.

‚ù∑The entire hotel is full of works of art, and every step of the way is worth boasting. Every place is worth checking in and staying in. I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya, which is the most cultural and profound manifestation. You won't feel bored after spending a whole day in the hotel. You can sleep until you wake up naturally in the morning. The breakfast in Qinyuan Hall is a semi-self-service ordering system.

‚ù∏The premier 130m swimming pool is really YYDS. When I looked at the pictures before coming here, I thought it was an enlarged version of a standard swimming pool without any features. However, wherever it is placed, it is a landscape and is functional.

‚ùπFinally, let‚Äôs talk about the design of the room. After reading online reviews and pictures, I felt that the hotel in Sanya did not have a large balcony. Instead, it had a long ***** of glass, which felt a little missing. However, it turned out otherwise. I think this design is quite amazing. The entire depth of the room is A piece of seamless glass, with an extension made of mirrors at the end, brings the entire view of the bay into the room. You will understand after you open your eyes and live there the next day.

Summary: let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings. The hotel is too big and it‚Äôs easy to get lostü´†There are thousands of hotels in Sanya, and Park Hyatt is my favorite at the moment‚ô•Ô∏è

msg:I haven‚Äôt been to Sanya for a few years. This time I decided to go on vacation first and then visit. I stayed at the Park Hyatt for two nights. Before I came, I kept it in my favorites. I didn‚Äôt have time to go to other places during the summer. I wanted to check in during the National Day holiday, which I personally found very rare. I stayed in Building 5 with a front view of the sea. Regardless of the floor, I could see blockbuster movies with just a touch of my phone. The sea water was deep blue and clear green. There was a hotel with its own paddle rental on the beach. The diving in the three directions seems to be crowded and a little messy. The sand quality is slightly worse on the other side. The sand on the hotel's own beach is very fine and well managed. This hotel was immediately recommended to friends. Before checking in, I added Crystal, the Park Hyatt butler, for thoughtful and patient service. I would like to give some ideas. I am very satisfied with the Park Hyatt. Except for the high price during the 11.11 holiday, I am very satisfied with the food and environmental services. Will come again

msg:This is my third time staying at the Park Hyatt Sun Bay, and it shows how much I love this hotel.
First of all, the location of the hotel is very good. It is located in Sun Bay at the corner of Yalong Bay, far away from the bustling city. The exclusive road requires checking the reservation record before entering. There is no disturbance from tourists and the privacy is very high. Of course, it is recommended to drive there by yourself, otherwise it is still a bit far to call a taxi.
The overall design is full of international style. Many international artists have representative works in the hotel, which are worth savoring and the museum style is full.
The guest room is relatively large in size, separated from wet and dry, and equipped with a large bathtub. The room has an outdoor terrace and leisure chairs, with a unique view of the mountains and sea.
The outdoor swimming pool is the highlight, with a 130-meter swimming pool, which is very good.
The catering is generally good, but the breakfast is a bit thin and does not match the quality of the Park Hyatt.
Before check-in, a dedicated housekeeper added WeChat to follow up throughout the process. This time, the housekeeper Claire left a good impression on people. She responded promptly, provided considerate service, and was not overly intrusive. It felt good.
The maintenance of some guest room facilities is slightly insufficient and I hope it can be improved.
Overall, the Park Hyatt Sun Bay is one of the luxury hotels worth experiencing.

msg:Before departure, we read a lot of hotel guides and hesitated for a long time between the Edition and the Park Hyatt. The reviews in the little red book had mixed reviews. In the end, we chose the Park Hyatt because of its good privacy and exclusive access to Sun Bay.
  ‚Ä¢ Before departure - I was actually very nervous, but the day before I received a call from the guest depar**ent asking about our arrival time, room needs, special requests, etc. I felt at ease in an instant, and my husband joined us in the evening The butler "fairy" who was in charge of our hotel trip officially started the trip. Here I want to praise fairy in real name, which will be explained in detail later.
  ‚Ä¢ Arrival - We drove the rented Tesla from the airport and went straight to the hotel. On the way, the housekeeper asked us about the license plate, which needed to be entered in advance. We arrived at the first gate outside the hotel, checked our check-in information, and then entered the "park". This is also another line of defense for privacy, and not too many tourists will enter. After driving for about 3-4 minutes, we arrived at the Park Hyatt. The concierge at the door was very enthusiastic, helped us get our luggage and registered it, and informed us that the luggage would be delivered to the room later.
  ‚Ä¢ Front desk check-in - the butler was waiting (confirmed the arrival time with us before). After check-in, the butler introduced the hotel's facilities and special Halloween activities, and then sent us to the room.
  ‚Ä¢ Hotel facilities - The hotel upgraded us to a full sea view room (my husband used Ctrip's membership rights to upgrade), among the 5 buildings with the best views in the hotel. It takes about 3 minutes from the room to the beach. Many people complain that the hotel is like a maze. In fact, we feel okay, but the distance is really not close. You can easily walk thousands of steps in the hotel every day without going out. The hotel's gym faces the sea and has a stunning view. It is well-equipped and well-maintained. Hotel guests can also experience morning yoga, which is very friendly to female friends. This time I also experienced the hotel's seaside spa, which is located in a single-family villa at the back and has great privacy.
  ‚Ä¢ An impromptu idea - This trip coincided with my birthday, so I asked the hotel if there could be a simple decoration. The butler arranged red wine, cakes, and handwritten blessing cards, which was full of sincerity.
  ‚Ä¢ Checking out - We have the habit of collecting hotel room cards, so we asked about it this time (we thought if we gave them, we would give them, and if we didn‚Äôt, forget it), the front desk said it was no problem, and specially helped find two different new ones. card and a heart-warming departure gift.
  ‚Ä¢ Postscript - If I were simply asked to comment on the experience of staying at the Park Hyatt Hotel, I would say it was pretty good. At least it exceeded my expectations for domestic hotels, and it was not as bad as the little red book said. I was originally here for a vacation. Don't be picky. If I have to point out a shortcoming, it is that if there is a wedding or event on the outdoor lawn, it will be a bit noisy (usually it won't end until ten o'clock in the evening), which is a bit difficult for people who go to bed early.

This stay coincides with the sixth anniversary of my baby and I. On this special day, in the face of my endless requests, the hotel will be very patient in arranging decorations for me.

From the moment we were picked up by Master Yu at the airport, we have been taken care of by the hotel. They arranged for Lisen butler to accompany us to check in, show us around the hotel, familiarize us with the location and services, greet us every day, communicate our needs, and remind us to go and talk to everyone. Cocktails and canap√©s served at the hotel. Every employee in the hotel greets you with a smile, which makes you feel at home. The hotel is very close to the sea. The beach is rare white and the water is clear. It is like a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãglass. I particularly like it. The 130-meter blue swimming pool with an edge is very charming. There are trees next to it for shade, so it will not be too sunny and comfortable. I have to say that the fruits, snacks, and various kinds of drinks that the hotel provides to guests every day are very considerate. You must see the pictures. Everything is almost perfect, fans of Park Hyatt Sun Bay have fallen in love with it!

Facing the sea, the seven square buildings are staggered in height, left and right, maximizing the ability for every guest to experience the beautiful gifts brought to us by the most beautiful coastline.

msg:It‚Äôs actually quite complicated to write a review. I feel aggrieved when it comes to giving good reviews. If I don't give a good review, I think subjective factors may also have an impact. After all, the service didn't make me particularly comfortable.
Let‚Äôs talk about the uncomfortable part first. We flew to Sanya on Friday, but it rained heavily in Guangzhou and the flight was severely delayed, so we had to go through all the trouble to get to the hotel at 2 a.m. on Saturday. There were no drinks or snacks at the front desk, and we didn't even have any water. We were tired and hungry. When I entered the room, I thought that there would be a room layout in advance, but there was no such thing. Of course, there was no need for it so late, so I went to bed directly. Then it rained heavily in Sanya on Saturday, the ground was wet, and the plastic slippers in the hotel were not slippery. I slipped and fell by the swimming pool in the evening. I ended up going to the hospital overnight, hungry and tired. There was a heavy rain in Sanya on Sunday. Although we were delayed to check out until 1 o'clock, shortly after 1 o'clock, they made three phone calls to urge us to check out. I received the first call, told her that I had packed up, went to the bathroom and left. Then not long after, the phone rang again, but I didn't receive it. Then the landline rang again before going out, and we were already opening the door with our things in hand. Let‚Äôs put ourselves in our shoes. It‚Äôs raining heavily outside and our arms are swollen. We‚Äôve packed up and are ready to leave. We still have to catch a flight back to Guangzhou. As for making three phone calls and chasing people away? It suddenly felt quite desolate. I stayed in the hotel for two nights, only had breakfast and took some travel photos, but basically didn‚Äôt enjoy anything. We just went to a hotel in the same category last quarter. We also stayed for two nights on the weekend and traveled to Sanya and Guangzhou. We booked a late flight and arrived late. As a result, they upgraded the room type and delayed check-out until 2 o'clock. They also gave us a small gift when we left. . Although it is not expensive, the psychological feeling is different.
Let‚Äôs talk about the good aspects. The housekeeper had a very good attitude and a sweet voice. She followed up all the time. She also sent cakes and refreshments, and helped make reservations for various activities. However, she didn't go when an accident happened later. After the fall, the manager on duty came over to care for us as soon as possible. There was a car behind us to take us to the hospital, and he kept calling us to care about us. I would like to commend my travel photos. They were very beautiful. I spent more than 2,000 to upgrade the package. The hotel is indeed beautiful.
I didn‚Äôt really enjoy the hotel this time. I wanted to go diving at Momofuku Island, but I couldn‚Äôt go. It rained heavily and I got injured again. It's a pity anyway.

The hotel's beach and sea water are indeed beautiful when the weather is good. The rooms are quite large and have a reasonable layout. Even the fragrance and supplies in the room seem to be consistent. The service is also impeccable. My housekeeper Josie has been doing her best from the day before check-in to my check-out. I must praise her. It's a pity that I only stayed for two nights this time. I'll come again next time.

The Park Hyatt was the best among the four hotels. The best value for money, the best environment, one step at a time, very private and quiet, and you can catch the sea every day. The infinity pool is clean and large. Hotel snacks, minibar, fruits, and desserts are free and refilled every day. The service staff greets you warmly. The butler Crystal was enthusiastic and caring, and even gave us coconuts and refreshing drinks. I highly recommend it to friends and colleagues. It‚Äôs worth coming back!

Service: When I learned that I had an afternoon flight, they offered to extend my check-out until 2 o'clock. I was very touched. The minibar is free, and there are so many drinks that I can't finish them all. There are good night chocolates and welcome fruits, great.

The hotel has a sense of design, a combination of Chinese and Western, and the design is very textured. It can be seen that the designer has put a lot of thought into it, and there are many decorations, calligraphy and paintings with Chinese elements, which perfectly embody Chinese culture and integrate aesthetic elements. Design Teachers are doing well. Although I don't know who the designer is, I can see that the skills are very profound.

Maybe the hotel is relatively large, and breakfast can only be self-service, not the semi-self-service I like. The breakfast is not as rich as the Capella Hotel. But overall, it's really worth living.

The glass sea is well-deserved, and it is more beautiful than many beaches in Thailand, which is very good. The water sports are just next door to the hotel, very convenient, inexpensive, and worth experiencing.

To be honest, I am not too impressed with the other ones. The reason why I think the Park Hyatt is good is mainly because of the sun. Bay, the hotel occupies an exclusive bay. It is rare to be able to swim and swim in the sea without leaving the hotel. Generally speaking, hotels with private beaches can swim in the sea but not swim in the sea. After all, swimming and swimming are in the same area. The environmental requirements are different. Otherwise, you can't go to the sea or swim in the sea. You can only look at the scenery and play with the sand. It's rare to do all three, but it's all possible here in Sun Bay. [Let me see] [Let me Take a look] [Let me take a look] Because the two villa hotels we stayed in were too damp, both of us developed eczema and couldn't get into the water. Especially Virgos, who were covered in eczema and could only lie down in the hotel room, but I was the only one. The middle-aged girl herself had a great time in the hotel. It was so much fun to see all kinds of weird marine life without leaving the hotel! (There are many water sports in the hotel that I haven‚Äôt tried yet) The rooms are also very good. There are not many varieties of buffet breakfast but everything tastes good. You get a coconut when you check in, and there are welcome fruits and free afternoon tea and cocktails every day. As for the shortcomings, the inconvenience of ordering takeout can only be solved within the hotel. Never mind that Chinese and Western food basically costs about a thousand yuan per meal for two people. By the way, in fact, the breakfast buffet is open until 11 noon. It‚Äôs perfectly fine to have the breakfast buffet later and then have free afternoon tea at 5 or 6 o‚Äôclock [laughing] [laughing] [laughing] [laughing] I was at 3 p.m. I didn't eat after ordering, so I didn't try any of the complimentary dim sum cocktails, which was a pity.

Fruits and snacks are welcome for two days, and you can eat and drink at the mini bar every day (2 Coke, 2 Sprite, 2 Voss water, 2 juices, 2 beers, as well as potato chips, biscuits, tea bags, capsule coffee, etc.)
Facilities: Sanya's most beautiful beach, 3 outdoor swimming pools: 130m Sunny Bay swimming pool, children's pool, family pool, and 1 indoor swimming pool.

Snacks and drinks on the observation deck: 1 free per person from 5:30 to 6:30 every night. It's a pity that I didn't go. I took my children to the sea to catch small crabs and shrimps.

Disadvantages: There are few breakfast categories, and I feel that there is nothing to eat, but there are 6 or 7 kinds of fruits, which is satisfactory.

It was after one o'clock when we arrived at the hotel. The room was not cleaned yet, so I walked around the hotel. It was indeed as mentioned on the Internet, like a maze. I asked questions as I walked. The hotel has a strong sense of design and is full of art everywhere. . After the room was cleaned, the housekeeper Musk personally took us to the room and asked about our needs.
We booked a full sea view room this time, and were finally given a room on the 10th floor of Building 5. The view was unparalleled and the beautiful scenery of Sun Bay was unobstructed. Although the room is not very new, it is relatively clean, the bedding is relatively hard, and the supplies seem to have been replaced by large bottles in all hotels now, which is a pity. What I especially want to praise is that the minibar is really rich. I stayed here for two days and replenished it once. I couldn‚Äôt finish it. And it‚Äôs free. Desserts, snacks and fruits are also given every day. Although the hotel‚Äôs service seems cold and cold. , but it is full of details.
Of course, the hotel‚Äôs biggest bonus is the beach at Sun Bay. Compared to Haitang Bay, where you can‚Äôt go into the sea, you can go into the sea here, and the water is very clear. Although the weather is not sunny and sunny, you can still take photos with the effect of a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãglass. The waves are far less big than Haitang Bay, and because it is a private beach, non-hotel guests cannot enter. There are not many people on the beach, so it is very private. After swimming in the sea for a while, I went to swim in the hotel's special 130m swimming pool. It was really shocking. I was very tired after swimming 130m back and forth.
The food and environment of the hotel's Chinese restaurant are excellent, and the dishes are by no means overwhelming. Although the hotel's breakfast does not have too many varieties, it is very exquisite, and the noodles are especially delicious.
Although this trip only lasted three days and two nights, it was very fulfilling and unforgettable. I still haven‚Äôt figured out the structure of the hotel. This is also the charm of the hotel. It has a completely different feeling from other resort hotels in Sanya.

msg:Great hotel, the butler fairy's service is super good, patiently answering my various questions every day, and the response is also very fast, always meeting my various needs, very considerate. I felt that the price was quite expensive when I booked the room, but it was worth it after the stay. We live in room 1107 in building 1, the view is superb! It feels like staying in the room is a kind of enjoyment. Waking up at 5:30 in the morning and seeing the sunrise in bed is a great feeling. There are not many types of breakfast, but the taste is good. My dad eats all the egg series every day, and praises it while eating. The juice is freshly squeezed and fresh, and the yogurt is custard. relatively expensive. There are also free special concoctions and snacks on the viewing platform every afternoon. I feel that people with small appetites can skip dinner. The 130-meter swimming pool is really going to explode, and the shade on both sides allows you to swim without fear of the scorching sun, which is great for people with sensitive skin like me. The hotel has many designs that are very beautiful, and it is really a scene at a time. There are so many beautiful flower decorations! There are not many parent-child activities in the hotel, and we often make appoin**ents but can‚Äôt catch upüòÇ, compared to other parent-child hotels, it is much quieter. The beach of the hotel can catch the sea, and many small crabs can be caught. If you really want to say that you are not satisfied, it is that there is no dryer, and the clothes are not easy to dry after washing. Of course, there is a paid laundry service. For families who take their children out to play in the water and have 20 pieces of clothes a day, this service is really costly. Blame me for being too poorüòìüòì

The service staff and staff are friendly, responsive and helpful. The breakfast fruit is very rich, the pineapple is so sweet, and the bread is also good. The seafood fried rice and abalone seafood porridge in the semi-buffet breakfast at Qinyuan Restaurant are delicious!
The small slides in the children's pool are very popular, and the lifeguards will warmly remind you that the slippers will be slippery. Thank you very much, because I almost slipped and fell.
The beach is beautiful and the hotel is very quiet. You can only see so many people when you go to the sea in the evening. Hahaha, you have to be careful of mosquitoes when you go to the sea at night...it's too fierce

I added WeChat the day before check-in to arrange the next day's activities clearly. During the stay, various small gifts and thoughtful services are really good experience. I come to live in Sanya every year I have been to many parent-child hotels such as Yanlord, Ritz, etc. I will still be like my friend Amway, the hotel is full of children's activities, and the adults' eating and drinking are not inferior. The room has unlimited minibars and the viewing platform is free. Drinks and snacks are arranged from evening to night. It really feels like a vacation. The sandy beach is fine and white, and the shallows are very suitable for children to catch up with the sea. You can enjoy a private and quiet bay all by yourself. The price/performance ratio is highly recommended

Hygiene: It is cleaned every day, and employees are often seen working in the public area.
Environment: It is the resort hotel with the most sense of design and experience that I have stayed in so far, and it can definitely meet your needs for punching in and taking pictures.
Service: The staff will greet you warmly, and will take the initiative to ask you if you have needs, which is worthy of the price.
Breakfast for 2 children: Other hotels have to charge separately, but here is directly waived, and there are quite a lot of tricks to eat.
Daily minibar drinks and snacks: All the room types I live in are free, and you can eat and drink as much as you want every day, and there are also fruit gifts every day.
Snacks and drinks on the observation deck: It seems that the service will be delivered when you stay in the hotel. The drinks and snacks are not bad. It is also very pleasant to take pictures and listen to songs in windy weather.
Summary: Generally speaking, Park Hyatt is the hotel I will stay in next time. The price is slightly higher in exchange for a private beach, private sea view and a wonderful stay experience. It is definitely a wise choice to bring a baby. It's just that the hotel is a bit like a maze, and it will be a little difficult for people with a bad sense of direction. The indoor swimming pool, the infinity pool and the children's pool are enough to meet everyone's play needs. It only costs more than a dozen yuan to take a taxi to the surrounding area for dinner, and you can also order takeaway, which is convenient for you to choose. In the last sentence, you will never regret coming to this store.

The layout of the room, the layout concept is particularly amazing. Oversized landscape windows provide a panoramic view of the first-line sea view. The hotel includes many buildings. Walking through the hotel is full of art museums, and you can see it every step of the way. It is worthy of being "a palace of art that lives in mountains and seas". Doors and courtyards are cleverly set up between buildings, and the airflow of mountains and oceans shuttles leisurely. The location of each building has been exquisitely designed, and the light and shadow are mottled everywhere. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose here again.

msg:Let me start with the conclusion: Park Hyatt Sunny Bay is really beautiful. It was a very satisfying vacation, which greatly exceeded my expectations. I believe we will meet again in the future.
This time I took my 17-year-old son on vacation together. I looked at a lot of hotels in advance. The hotel I was looking for was: quiet, delicious food, beautiful sea view, good beach, and able to catch the sea. Don't want a hotel where many children are noisy and parent-child. After looking around online, I booked Park Hyatt Sunny Bay on Ctrip. The day before the arrival, the person in charge of the hotel would take the initiative to call me and ask me what needs they would try their best to meet. They also arranged for the beautiful butler Daisy to add me on WeChat to confirm the arrival time at the hotel. The next day when I arrived at the appointed time, the beautiful housekeeper had already greeted me at the front desk. Her gentle, meticulous and considerate service made me have a good influence on the hotel immediately. As long as I needed help during the next three days of my stay, Daisy would respond immediately lend a helping hand. This feeling is great! Let's talk about the hotel. Although the occupancy rate is high, the overall environment is not noisy at all, which may be due to the large dispersion of hotels. Thanks to Ctrip for helping me upgrade the room, and the butler Daisy helped me get a room in the middle of the top floor of Building 5. The scenery in this room is really beautiful, with a panoramic view of Sunny Bay. What if there is no balcony? It is so satisfying to lie on the bed and enjoy the stars and the sea. We are also very satisfied with the catering, how satisfied are we? Both my son and I have gained several pounds, and now we have to find a way to lose weight when we get home! In short, I am very grateful to Ctrip, Park Hyatt Hotel, and Daisy the housekeeper. Let me spend a very happy holiday.

msg:For a hotel of this level, whether it is service or hardware and software, they are basically impeccable. Tell me a few feelings.
Service: The service is very kind. The waiters are basically soft-spoken and not high-pitched. There are dedicated docking staff who are serious and careful. They said it was an evening flight, and they took the initiative to delay the check-out time. Before leaving, they even gave a small gift Gift.
Facilities: The hotel is said to be the work of a famous designer, like a maze. The advantage is that the guests staying in the hotel will be dispersed, and the guests will not be gathered together, which increases the comfort of staying. The disadvantage should be that the view of some rooms is sacrificed. There are also many works of art in the hotel, and it is fun to explore every day like a maze.
        The outdoor Internet celebrity swimming pool is very amazing. It is recommended to go in the morning or evening. In the morning, there is shade from trees, which is quite pleasant. The indoor swimming pool is very standard, but there are basically no people, and those who like swimming can enjoy it exclusively. And the indoor and outdoor swimming pools are separated by a door, which is super convenient.
        The facilities in the room are also very good, the toiletries smell very good, and the water bar is rich in content. It's just that the air conditioner is not enough, the public area is very cool and comfortable, but the room is a little hot, and the temperature is difficult to cool down. I read a lot of reviews before coming here, and they seem to have some opinions on the air conditioner.
Catering: The breakfast is very good. You can order Eggs Benedict a la carte. The freshly made soup noodles are delicious, and fruit juice yogurt is also available. In addition, I ate a Chinese meal at the tea garden. There were several dishes that were worth mentioning. There was nothing wrong with it except that it was expensive. I ordered room service once, and it was not bad.
Sea view: The bay is not big, the water quality is clear but there are a lot of reefs, and a small area is enclosed where you can go swimming in the sea, but I didn't try it. That is to say, it is the hotel's private beach, but it is not. Many locals who are obviously not hotel guests saw workers or locals picking coconuts at the hotel on the first afternoon? With a lot of family members, it is still a bit üòî for children to run back and forth on the beach with no clothes and bare buttocks. The bright blue agricultural tricycle transporting coconuts is parked on the landscape lawn, which is another kind of scenery. Furthermore, the bay is not very big, and there are motorboats running back and forth for business, which is very noisy and a bit noisy.
Takeaway: Takeaway is also convenient, but you need to go to the locker outside the lobby on the 6th floor to pick it up, just like walking.
        The only regret of this trip was that I had noted that Building 5 was the closest to the sea, but we arranged for Building 2, which is the farthest from the sea, and the floor is not too high. It is said to be a supreme sea view room, but in fact it can be seen that it is the roof of other rooms, and the sea view is a bit far away.
        Thinking of this for the time being, I still recommend it overall. If you go to Sanya for vacation, it is worth staying for two or three days.

msg:I just checked out and waited for the plane‚úàÔ∏è. I have nothing to do to make a review, as a reference for parents and families. The most important reason for locking this hotel at first is that there are few people and the sea view is invincible. After that, I started to read hotel reviews mainly to browse bad reviews. There are many Bad reviews do not rule out personal reasons or super high requirements, and basically have no impact and can be ignored, so choose decisively.
First of all, let‚Äôs talk about the general environment. The internal environment of the hotel is more Chinese-style, decoration + ornaments + lighting + decorative paintings = full of artistic sense
In fact, every hotel has a different style, Thai style, European and American style, modern style, Chinese style, etc., each has its own favorite. The hotel garden is not too big compared to several hotels in Yalong Bay, and the greenery is very good. It would be even better if you can put a few park seats or swings on the lawn near the sea.
       The size of the room is enough for a family of four. We added an extra bed and everyone slept very comfortably. The lighting in the room is mediocre. Maybe it‚Äôs because we are on the second floor, and the make-up light in the bathroom is very dark. What‚Äôs interesting is that many beauties have yin and yang makeup. Face, that's why.
       Then we are concerned about the service. After all, we are in the mood to appreciate the beautiful scenery after enjoying high-quality service. Every room in the hotel has a butler, and the reviews will comment on how good their butlers are. Of course, our butler Daisy is also very responsible. Although I haven't met her, it doesn't affect her service attitude and quality. She always responds and solves my problems and requirements in the first time, but I want to say that not only the housekeeper, but also every service staff, restaurant, viewing platform, and children's playground , cleaning, lifeguards, they are all licking bricks and tiles for high-quality services, at least I have experienced it, so I won‚Äôt list them here one by one. Our check-in time is from 17-23, room number 52. Thanks to the cleaning lady during this period for the children An extra supplement üòÅ, the viewing platform broke the rules and sent me cocktails to the room every night. Thanks to the lifeguard, Master Huang, who jumped into the water as soon as my child was in danger to get him out of danger. In fact, not all my requirements were met during our stay, but even if they were not fully met, we did not find it unreasonable or unacceptable.
        As for the sea view, let‚Äôs see the photos for ourselves! There are no filters. Snorkeling in Sunny Bay, catching the sea, the beautiful scenery is in place in one step, we just lie flat!

msg:It is indeed the number one hotel in Yalong Bay, and one hotel in one bay brings better privacyüëçThis is more similar to Mandarin Oriental. The cultural Oriental swimming pool is much more than here. The overall environment of the hotel feels less crowded. It is a pity that Mandarin Oriental is a natural coral coast without a beach, which is not suitable for us! There are not many people staying in Park Hyatt during the summer vacation season. The guest experience depar**ent Crystal is very friendly. Because it is the first time to stay in the hotel environment and make reservations for meals, etc., I am not familiar with it. Thank you for her responsiveness. A few years ago, I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Yalong Bay. The white sand beach üèñÔ∏è brought by Park Hyatt and the small waves here in Sun Bay are suitable for adults and children who like to swim and play in the sea. The water quality is also clearer than Long Bay. The reason for the free upgrade to the sea view room is that the floor is higher. The view is also beautiful. Park Hyatt and Ritz-Carlton will also have some personal comparisons: 1. Park Hyatt‚Äôs three restaurant packages are more cost-effective than Ritz, and a 3-person package is about 800. The taste of the Chinese restaurant and Western restaurant is also suitable for our lazy people who like bubble hotels. The key point is that there are no umbrellas, and the service staff is pitiful. There is only one lifeguard, and there is no service point for drinks and towels on the beach. It is a pity that such a beautiful beach has to go to the swimming pool far away to ask the staff to get towels. 4. The key sea view room is better than the Ritz, the area is larger, and the internal facilities are more well-maintained. In the words of my son: You can see the sea while lying down üëç5 It is also the first time I have harvested so much from the beach. It is also the first time I have caught sea urchins, crabs, shrimps, and shrimps! In general, it is worth staying here, white sand beach + sea view room + few people + delicious food = the reason why I will come again

msg:This time staying at Park Hyatt, I have an extraordinary feeling. First of all, let‚Äôs talk about the environment. I really can‚Äôt be picky. The quality of the sea water and the beach should be second to none in Sanya. I hope the beach can maintain its independence. If there are no outsiders coming in It might be better to bother. (Another digression: You can sign up to go to Baifu Island to play water sports near the hotel, but it is found that environmental protection is still very important. When diving, I found that there are a lot of submarine garbage. I hope that the Sanya government will still strengthen environmental governance and protection. After all, Sanya is As a tourist city, protecting the marine ecology and natural environment is the top priority)
Let me talk about the check-in experience: Although there was a small episode at the front desk when I checked in, the hotel manager Liu Bao paid great attention to customer opinions and experience after hearing about it, and immediately rushed over to explain and help coordinate and deal with it on the spot. Basically, the problem was solved within 5 minutes. Liu Bao The manager is so gentle, humble and professional, which makes people feel very comfortable and makes us feel a sense of politeness and respect. When we left the store, Manager Liu also entrusted his colleagues to send us off and took the initiative to contact us. Meet our needs and ask us for advice on staying.
In addition, I would like to praise the fairy of the hotel guest experience depar**ent. She is very polite. She has been in touch with us since before check-in. She explained the situation of the hotel to us clearly. During the check-in period, she has actively kept in touch with us and provided us with guidance as much as possible. And help, butler service, makes people feel very caring.
Next, let‚Äôs talk about catering. The hotel‚Äôs buffets are relatively small. This may not be perfect. After all, it is a five-star luxury hotel. I hope that the hotel‚Äôs catering level and menu choices will be more next time, so that it can be suitable for different people. The customer base will also increase more popularity.
Next time I have a chance to come to Sanya, I will stay at Park Hyatt again!

msg:I brought my children to Sanya during the summer vacation. It was too busy to change hotels during the previous few visits. This time I chose the Park Hyatt Hotel and stayed for five days and four nights. The experience is very good. The children also had a great time
Location: Although the location of the hotel is a bit remote, it is very quiet, and there is no problem with calling a taxi for travel. You can get on the car in about five minutes by Didi taxi.
Environment: The environment in the hotel is very good. The sand on the beach is very fine, and the children had fun digging in the sand. I especially like the outdoor pool. The children are clamoring to go every day. The water is also very clean.
The room is quite satisfactory. The hotel is huge. relatively expensive
Catering: The breakfast variety is very rich, and the juices are all freshly squeezed. Every day, there will be a dining car offering a local special food in Hainan, which is also very attentive. The food in the Chinese restaurant in the hotel feels average and the price is high, but there is nothing amazing about the food bar. Western pizza is delicious. The coconut chicken hot pot at night is my son's favorite. In the afternoon, there will be happyhour for snacks and drinks on the viewing platform. The variety of snacks is different every day. Drinks include freshly squeezed juices, daily cocktails, white and red wines. After 8pm there is a free cocktail. There will be resident singing on the viewing platform after 3:30, and it will end at 10:15. Living in a balcony room is a bit noisy at night. Those with children may be affected
Service: The hotel service is good.
Daisy butler service is also very good. Will contact me in advance to understand travel needs. During the stay, I will often ask if I need help, and will answer my questions as soon as possible. If you have any problems, just ask the housekeeper.
The room is cleaned every day, free drinks in the mini bar, turn down service.
This is the operator who keeps getting the room numbers wrong. A few times things from other rooms were delivered to our room by mistake.
Suggestions: 1. There should be a foot bath next to the beach. You can wash the sand off your feet when you leave.
2. The resident singer is the same person every day. It is recommended that one Chinese singer and one English singer update the song list. The four days were all the same songs.
All in all, the trip was a complete success. Thank you üòä Next time I have the opportunity to choose Park Hyatt Hotel

The hotel's beach is definitely worth mentioning. The sand is very fine, and children like it very much. It's fun to catch the sea when the tide is low.

I came back from the sea and saw the beach a few days ago, so I decided to choose here. The beach of Park Hyatt can be regarded as the ceiling of Sanya. The sand is white in Bilong Bay, Haitang Bay and Dadonghai. There are broken corals but not too much. Bilong Bay is much better. The beach can be used for swimming or snorkeling. There are several people Lifeguards are on duty and accommodate the kids. The hotel has a strong artistic a**osphere, and you can take random photos in any corner, and designer works can be seen everywhere. The youngest son likes the library the most, and has collected a lot of design books, and the eldest likes to walk around and take pictures. Cocktails and snacks are presented on the viewing platform every afternoon. The Fairy girl in the guest experience depar**ent is very kind. She gave the children a fruit plate, a double-layered dessert table, a children's care set, and special children's bathrobes. Our family of four didn't drink much soft drinks, mainly pure water and mineral water. The water was not enough on the first day. Fairy immediately asked the housekeeping depar**ent to bring another ten bottles after reacting. The youngest son had a bad throat and went downstairs to vomit at noon. After mm knew about it, he asked a colleague to send a comfort bear. In short, the service was very good, and he would choose Sanya Park Hyatt if he had the opportunity.

Walking through a corridor and turning a corner is like visiting an art gallery. Non-resident guests cannot enter and keep it quiet and private. The hotel exclusively occupies Sunny Bay, the best beach in Sanya. There is the most beautiful glass sea and the most white and delicate milk sand in Sanya. In the evening, you can take your children to the sea to catch small fish and crabs.

msg:A very nice hotel with a strong sense of design. It was designed by the world-renowned design master Jean-Michel Gatti from Belgium. The hotel is very large and enjoys a bay all to itself. It has a strong sense of privacy. It is a distance away from the hotel. On the Sun Bay Highway, we started to check whether it is a hotel guest. Privacy is guaranteed. Entering the Sunny Bay Highway, you will be attracted by 6 square and unique buildings with distinct water chestnut angles. The hotel is very large, like a maze. There is a long infinity pool. The sand on the beach is very fine and the sea water is crystal clear. very blue. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, and the hotel service is very good, especially the front desk and housekeeper Lydia, who are the most outstanding and outstanding staff during my hotel experience. Before leaving, the front desk staff who checked me in also gave me a souvenir of the hotel, thank you very much. On the one hand, the design of this hotel is very top-notch, and the service of the front desk and Lydia is the embodiment of the luxury of this hotel. The room is large in size, designed with double basins, the sink is very long, and the bathtub is a rare stone bathtub. All minibars are free. Under the trend of hotel environmental protection, this hotel is still equipped with small bottles of laboratory equipment, which is really amazing! The whole hotel is like an art palace, full of surprises everywhere! At night, the facade of the building is extraordinarily advanced under the embellishment of lighting effects. Next time it must be the place to compare and choose. I also recommended this hotel to some friends around me, telling them that it is a must-stay hotel in Sanya.

msg:This is the most comfortable hotel for this trip. The artistic a**osphere and delicacy of the hotel are paved the moment you enter the door. The entrance of the lobby is extremely narrow at first glance, but when you step into the lobby, you will feel that "the beginning is very narrow, only the people can understand, and the complex Walk dozens of steps, suddenly see the light, the otherworldly feeling. The hotel has a famous designer, Jean-Michel Gathy, one of the three masters of Aman. Integrating the concept of new Chinese style and modern simplicity, the hotel is divided into 6 gray bluestone brick buildings of different sizes, which are connected by corridors. Every part of the corridors is carefully decorated with artworks and paintings. Park red is the The most brilliant color of Park Hyatt Sunny Bay is bright and individual but unobtrusive, reflecting the classical Chinese aesthetics. From a distance, the 6 buildings look like Anhui Anhui style buildings, with a large area left blank. At night, the lights on the fa√ßade light up, like six gold bricks standing on the sea. The color temperature of about 3200K takes into account the lighting, making outsiders feel that the hotel is brightly lit, revealing a sense of unobtrusive luxury. Most of the hotel's partitions are embellished with artworks, allowing guests not only to enjoy a unique perspective feast step by step when they enter, art also surrounds them.
As for the hotel's beach, some people think that the coral reef is very harsh, but the soft sand can cover up this defect. It is worth mentioning that the swimming area on the beach is divided into adults and children. The deep water area for adults is the deepest. There are many kinds of coral and stone fish under the chest (I am 185cm), which is the clearest water quality I have ever seen and the beach with the most fish in the shallow sea swimming area. The staff will also go into the water to clean and check at night to ensure the safety of guests .
There are 4 swimming pools, among which the 130m-long Sunny Bay Pool is the most distinctive swimming pool in the hotel, and it is also the place where many Internet celebrities check in. Guests who like to swim can choose to swim with a length of 130m. If children want to have entertainment facilities, they can go to the family swimming pool next door. The hotel's swimming pools can meet the needs of most people as much as possible.
The room service is the most commendable place. The rooms have windows with a ratio of 16:9. Although most sea-view rooms do not have balconies, clothes can be dried through the air conditioner in the bathroom. Room service, all drinks in the mini bar include free drinks, and there are snacks and fruits every day. The detailed service is really good and full of surprises.
Additional services: It is recommended to experience Earl Travel Photography for 30 minutes, but the suggestion is to choose 5 photos as much as possible, because more than 5 photos are 80¬•/sheet for quick repair or 50¬•/sheet for no repair is really expensive
There are not as many types of breakfast as the Edison, but they are all high-quality goods, especially the freshly squeezed juice is really popular, and the honey is really dripped directly from the bee net.
Overall, next time I will really choose Treasure Hotel for the second time.

msg:The deputy manager doesn't talk too much, the service is very bad, the room we wanted to live in added an upgrade fee when we checked in and had already taken the room card to enter the room, and suddenly said that this room was reserved for someone else at the same time, and we brought our children as well It was easy to talk, so I agreed to change it, but when I entered another room, the child saw that the floor was still wet, and it seemed that it hadn't been cleaned up. The deputy manager said that we would be free for one night. We have already tossed about two rooms and agreed. , Finally, when I checked out, I didn't admit it, and the deputy manager didn't come out to solve the problem. Is this the attitude a hotel should have? Is it the habit of Park Hyatt to solve problems with lies? It is recommended that guests who stay in the future take selfies and photos. We were too honest and did not record evidence. Now the deputy manager does not show up. This woman was very kind at the time. We only agreed because of her good attitude. . As a result, one set in front of the face and another behind the back. We know people and face, but we don‚Äôt know what we know. This summer vacation, we took our children to play for a long time and stayed in five or six hotels. This deputy manager is really the worst manager in a long time, which seriously affects the mood of guests staying. Finally, I would like to advise everyone to start recording and communicate with their mobile phones from the beginning of check-in. I asked the deputy manager's name and said it was Lily, but he didn't give me a Chinese name. Very poor hotel manager. Such a person can still be promoted to manager***.

msg:Park Hyatt Hotel owns the entire Sunny Bay, the sea water is clear and bright, the effect of the jelly sea under the sunlight, the beach is white and delicate, picking up shells on the beach is a lot of fun! You can also see groups of small fish, which should be the number one on the beach and sea water in Sanya. The key is to be able to go into the sea!
The design of the hotel is really a masterpiece. The six buildings are connected by corridors. Each corridor is beautifully designed. Walk in it and appreciate the masterpieces. Many people say that Park Hyatt is a maze, but it is fun to solve the maze. My son and I Walking through the maze every day, admiring the designed corners, even drinking afternoon tea in the corner of the hotel, is a very relaxing moment!
The hotel's 130-meter-long swimming pool is great, the water is very clean, and the photos are very good. The children spend a lot of time here, and the paddle boards are very exciting. We made new friends here!
Park Hyatt's breakfast variety is not too much, but there are hard goods and good quality. The hotel has three restaurants for lunch and dinner.
The hotel service is very good. We were accompanied by Fairy from the guest experience depar**ent throughout the whole process. She greeted the children at the store and gave the children sand digging tools and desserts. She gave timely feedback on the needs during the stay. She gave us a small gift after check-out, which is a great experience. Very beautiful customer service, give us extra points for this trip! Also a big thanks to the beauty Fairy.
Perfect vacation experience, will come to Park Hyatt again!

Thoughtful, answer all questions. The room was clean and comfortable, and the breakfast was of good quality. The beach management is better than last time. Not only are there comfortable beach chairs, but the beach service will also provide fruits thoughtfully. There are more fun items such as kayaks and paddle boards. And the water quality is clear, swimming in the sea every evening and watching fish is the most exciting moment of the day! The service of Qinyuan Western Restaurant is very good, and the steak is delicious! The Chayuan Chinese restaurant is a little bit worse, but it's okay. In short, spend a pleasant holiday in Park Hyatt, and the Park Hyatt experience is the most perfect among all the five-star hotels in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay that I have stayed in! A good hotel that I will always go to in the future!

The breakfast is humanized, free for children under the age of 12, although there are not many varieties, but it is good, shrimp dumplings, salmon and daily recommended bread are all very delicious. During the happy hour in the evening, there are foreigners singing, and the a**osphere is also very good. It was a lot of fun to catch the sea at night. Unfortunately, I didn't prepare tools in advance, but I also caught 2 hard goods. The design of the hotel is also very good, like a museum, but it is a pity that we can only go around at night. During the day, a group of people are taking pictures during the trip, which is a sight to behold. Although there is no proactive service in terms of service, it can still respond quickly to any needs. Will come again next time.

msg:We stayed in two hotels in Sanya this time, one internet celebrity hotel (I won‚Äôt mention the name, one famous for its scenery) and one Park Hyatt. In terms of facilities, sanitation, environment, and service, the two hotels are obviously about the same price. Park Hyatt may be higher than one grade.
1. First of all, the room facilities. Park Hyatt has enough outlets, even wireless charging, equipped with electric curtains, smart toilets, and the rooms are large and soundproof, making it very quiet to live in. (In a certain Internet celebrity hotel, you can hear the speech next door at night).
2. The second thing that shocked me was Park Hyatt's service. First, there is a housekeeper who contacts me in advance, such as my housekeeper Crystal, who will inform me in advance of the benefits that are available to me, and if there is anything I can help, I can contact the housekeeper if there is any need. Our housekeeper Crystal is very nice! Help arrange travel photography, arrange drop-off, make an appoin**ent for the complimentary crystal boat time, invite us to participate in the free observation deck, etc., in short, very considerate and thoughtful service! The second is the gift of the room. Park Hyatt is very generous. Compared with other hotels, the daily mini bar is more, and there are many types of snacks. There are fruits in the afternoon and desserts in the evening. There are too many gifts to eat. The room is cleaned twice a day. I even feel that I will replenish the shampoo every time, which is really generous! There is even a pot of boiled water when you check in, and an ice bucket at night. The mineral water will be replenished automatically every day. We checked in in the afternoon on the first day, and when we came back after dinner in the evening, there were already 10 bottles of water in the room. Really Unexpectedly caring, and some netizens said that they need to ask the front desk to ask for more.
3. I was also worried that the hotel was like a maze as netizens said, but after we experienced it, as long as we remember that the 2nd floor and the 5th floor are linked floors, we will not get lost. The signs of each place in the hotel are very clear, and the housekeeper will also explain it carefully before check-in The business hours and geographical locations of various places in the hotel, in short, we did not get lost, and we can enjoy various artworks along the way, which is a very good experience. Some of the corridors are open and directly connected to nature, but the hotel management is very good, and there are no mosquitoes and small bugs, so you can feel at ease.
4. The location of Park Hyatt is relatively remote, but takeaway can still be delivered, and Park Hyatt is much more cost-effective than a certain restaurant. It is also possible to eat directly in the restaurant of Park Hyatt. We tried the coconut chicken hotpot, It is definitely the best tasting coconut chicken during our trip. It has a strong coconut fragrance and does not make people feel that the soup is watery. The service of the restaurant also makes people feel that it is worth the money.
5. We originally ordered the Supreme Sea View, but we upgraded to the Supreme Full Sea View when there was a discount on that day. The scenery in front of the window is very worthwhile. The beauty seen by the naked eye cannot be captured with a mobile phone. I adjusted the color in the seventh picture, which is close to the naked eye. The scenery I saw was so beautiful that I could sit in front of the window and watch it all day.
All in all, this trip to Park Hyatt was an impressive and unfinished experience, and we will choose Park Hyatt again next time!

4. The hotel has high privacy, and the beach is not open to the public. The lawn of the hotel leads directly to the beach. The sea water is clear and fish can be seen, and the beach is white and thin.
Next time I have a chance, I will stay again!

There is also a happy hour from 5:30 to 7:00 pm every day, with free cocktails and snacks. In addition, the hotel also gave a travel photo, which is really good.

msg:Hotel recommended by friends. It really is very tall. The check-in environment, hotel facilities, surrounding scenery, and hotel services are all very good.
Children especially like swimming. The hotel has multiple swimming pools, and the water in the pools is very clear and hygienic. The fun camp activities are also great.
The beach is very beautiful, the sand is also very fine, and the sea and sea breeze are very good.
Breakfast and afternoon tea are also very delicious and rich.
Although there was a small episode in the process, it was quickly and perfectly resolved. In particular, I would like to thank the duty manager Li Dafang, Manager Li, for his patience and sincerity, and for arranging this itinerary very well.

When I actually arrive at Park Hyatt, I just want to say: I am grateful to my friends.
One step at a time, the inside and outside interact, the waves are gentle, and the beach is delicate. The service of the butler Musk is also very attentive.
It's a place where I will definitely come again~

msg:The unique geographical location, the perfect integration of the hotel and nature, is very beautiful. Because I came from another parent-child hotel with very good service, I was a little uncomfortable. 1. The hotel room does not provide any children's facilities and supplies. 2. The only children's fun camp is not scheduled to participate in the event, one day in advance! ! ! Even if there were not many children at the time, the staff only cared about whether you made a reservation. 3. The speed of serving food in Chinese restaurants is so slow that it doubts life. The happy hours on the viewing platform on the 4th and 6th floors are very tasteless, whether it is time or food. Good points: The breakfast variety is not particularly large, but the quality is good; the place is large and the area per capita is large, clean. The beach is delicate, the environment is beautiful, and there are enough swimming pools.

msg:Checked into the Park Hyatt before the pool was filled before the summer vacation.

Location: The hotel is backed by mountains and faces the sea, with good privacy, which is very suitable for relaxing. Although it is about 40 kilometers away from the airport, the hotel provides a free pick-up and drop-off service (one-way option), which saves the waiting time. Here, I would like to praise the driver who sent me to the airport. The driving was very stable throughout the journey.

Hotel environment: My favorite is the corridor of the library, the color matching is very comfortable.

Room facilities: I booked a supreme sea view room, which was arranged on the 7th floor of building 6. When I opened the door, I found that it was facing the center of the landscape, and the view was not blocked, which was very good. It's just that when you open the door and enter, the welcome message on the TV is only the name, not the title. Compared with other hotels of the same level, this is not very good.

Service: Everywhere you walk in the hotel, when you meet the service staff, they will greet you warmly. Under the scorching sun, you can see the staff working hard to clean up the withered flowers in every landscape with water, just to present the most beautiful side.
The housekeeper who received me this time was Jimie, who would inform me of my daily happy hour arrangements in advance, knowing that my plane was late, and specially helped me to extend the check-out time, so that I could wait comfortably in the room. Here I would like to give this housekeeper sister a big praise.

Restaurant: During the stay, I only had breakfast at the hotel. There are not many dishes to choose from, and the replenishment is also missing.

Swimming pool: The outdoor infinity pool is great, and there are lifeguards sitting along the way, which is good. It's just that the smell in the locker room is a bit big, and I hope to improve it in the future.

The garden view is also better, and there are many swimming pools! The service is not as bad as the previous reviews! You can drink the drinks in the freezer casually, but it's a pity that I didn't drink a bottle after staying for a few days! The breakfast is generally not particularly rich, and the management of the beach is generally simple. Most of the activities on the beach seem to be outsourced, and the service is not good! The hotel has no staff to serve on the beach! It's messy! The advantage is that the hotel has a huge beach, and it feels like a bay belongs to his family. It is quite secluded and private, and outsiders can't get in! The guests staying in the hotel are almost young and young people who are in love. In short, they are quite satisfied. It is a relatively luxurious hotel! It is expensive! too expensive!

And the breakfast in this hotel is simply too strong, and the breakfast is until 11 o'clock, basically there is no need to eat at noon. Needless to say, the scenery is very quiet and beautiful.

The hotel is about 40 minutes' drive from the airport, next to the most beautiful internet celebrity road, Sunny Bay is less crowded than Long Bay, so you don't have to go out after staying here.

Thank you, Ms. Jimie, the housekeeper, for your considerate service. Explain the map to us, send warm reminders on WeChat every day, and reply to solve temporary problems in time.

There are three restaurants in the hotel. We recommend Qinyuan's western food and the barbecue hot pot buffet in Heyue Hall. The observation deck bar has free drinks and snacks during the happy hour from 5:30 to 7:00 every day, and there are also very nice resident singers. The experience is very good~

During the stay, travel photography and yoga classes were given as a gift. I was very pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect the results to be so good. If I come to Sanya again in the future, I will choose to live in Park Hyatt.

msg:The night view is beautiful, the location is quiet and there are few people, and the comfort is high. The staff were very responsive, we were served by Jimie from Guest Experience, a great job, thank you very much. The hotel beach will have a special sand forklift to level the beach early in the morning. The white fine sand is suitable for children to play, and broken corals are washed up in some places. The beach on the far left is the most comfortable, and there are more reefs on the far right. The fifth building is relatively quiet and comfortable to live in, but it is a long way to take the children and then I changed to the sixth building. On the viewing platform, the singing in the bar at night almost ends at 10:30, and the a**osphere is quite good. The exteriors of the lawn and coconut trees are good, and I also gave five free quick repair photos. I bought three of the excess parts. I like it so much that I feel that there are some check-in points and less photos. From feeling mediocre to leaving on the last night, I feel a little bit reluctant and like it. The long infinity swimming pool is also the highlight of the hotel. The food and beverages in the hotel are good. The serving speed of the Chinese restaurant in Chayuan is relatively slow, so it is necessary to arrange for people in the same company to order in advance. I like Qinyuan Western Restaurant the most, and the coffee is delicious. The staff are very good, because I was traveling alone with my baby, no one helped me to take pictures, but there were staff who helped me, I took a lot of nice photos, I am very satisfied overall.

Originally booked a garden view room, but later upgraded to a sea view room for the view. Thanks to the housekeeper, Crystal, for her help, I found a lot of hidden surprises in the hotel~ The road leading to the hotel is still so beautiful, and Sunny Bay really made me feel what is called the same color of water and sky! It's just that it's a little remote and it's not convenient to order takeaway. Fortunately, there are many dining options in the hotel and they are all delicious. The small lighthouse by the sea is also very charming, and it is very easy to shoot. The overall environment is very quiet and does not feel noisy. It feels that the whole rhythm has slowed down. Many beauties in the hotel make appoin**ents for travel photography, and you can often see handsome men and beauties taking pictures by the beach. So the attitude of the service staff is very good, very patient and super efficient! The food in the hotel is also outstanding, all the pastries are delicious! Every day, I will come to the room to deliver small snacks, and there are happy hours in the afternoon. It is so pleasant to enjoy the beautiful scenery and eat free snacks... There are not many types of breakfast, but the taste is super good. Although the sparrow is small, it feels like it has all the internal organs. (One more thing, I really like the hotel‚Äôs meals) Looking forward to the next Park Hyatt trip to Sanya

        This time, I stayed at Capella for two days before coming to Park Hyatt. I feel that Capella is really new and big, but my favorite is Park Hyatt. I like the quietness and comfort here, the sand is soft and the sea is clear, the staff are very warm and friendly, and the service level is online throughout the whole process. The breakfast food is delicious. The oysters in the western restaurant are the best I have eaten this year. The Chinese restaurant even has Dianping lobster The hot pot set meal is really super affordable.
        There are a few new experience points this time: 1. The experience officer has been added, Ruby is super awesome, the inquiries are quickly answered, and the problem is solved very efficiently. I also gave the baby a Park Hyatt co-branded bear, which is super cute. 2. The beach bags and shawls that came with the room before were gone. I consulted and said that a lot of them were taken away by the guests. I also didn‚Äôt understand the behavior of some guests. In the end, I was very enthusiastic and took a shawl and returned it when I used it up. 3. There is indeed a big gap between Joy Camp and Capella. The main lighting is too dark, and children are afraid to go in. It is recommended to upgrade. 4. Like Capella, Bojue travel photography is provided, but fortunately, it does not affect the experience of guests who like quietness; 5. The hammock on the beach is gone, will it be installed again, I miss it so much.
        Others are very satisfactory. The photos are a collection of photos taken in recent years. Every time a photo is posted, someone asks if they have gone to Southeast Asia, which shows that Park Hyatt is indeed different, and it is a hotel I will stay in again and again.

msg:We stayed in a suite for two nights, about 120 pings, very very very good.
The location of building 7 is the most reasonable. The beach, breakfast location, swimming pool, heated jacuzzi, and lounge can all be reached in 2 minutes.
The walls of the hotel are basically works of art, and you can get great satisfaction when you walk around.
The spa is intoxicating, stretching the body and mind.
The Chinese food is delicious in color, fragrance and taste (compared with the quality of hotels of the same level).
In the morning and evening, the room is cleaned up and small meals are served.
6 A free alcoholic drink at the poolside bar at sunset.
Believe me, two days is enough to enjoy it!

Building materials such as doors and wooden edges on the road are closed or collided with each other, poor maintenance, and cracks due to temperature differences over time. Accelerate hotel aging.

The Rambo housekeeper is awesome! When I went there, the weather was neither bad nor particularly good. It was foggy in the morning and there was sun at noon, and it was dark around six in the afternoon. Whether the water is beautiful or not depends on the weather.

First of all, I would like to thank the staff, Ms. Stella, for her enthusiastic service and help throughout the whole process. All kinds of inquiries were answered in a very timely manner. Where I needed help, I did a good job. I also gave a small gift when I left the store üéÅ

Facilities: I feel that the design of the whole hotel is very consistent, and the scenery is very beautiful wherever you go. There are no broken parts in the room. The items in the room are relatively new. The intelligent part of the room is also ok. The breakfast in the morning is quite good. There are a variety of different styles every day. The various breads and snacks in the morning are really delicious.
Hygiene: Neat and clean, room cleaning did not bother us, very good üëç
Environment: The hotel is really big and there are many buildings, but the guidelines are very clear. Walk through and get familiar with it. I really like to shuttle and walk between the various buildings of the hotel. I feel that I can exercise my muscles and bones while enjoying the scenery. The occupancy rate is relatively high, but in the hotel You hardly feel that when there are many people, you hardly meet people. It is very quiet. There are many artworks, ornaments and sculptures that you can check in. The hotel is very suitable for taking pictures. The travel photography experience given by the package is also good.
Service: It is in place and the staff in every place are doing a good job. From the infinity pool to the restaurants to the room service and customer service center, they are very considerate. I enjoyed two daily snacks and special daily categories at the observation deck. It's different. I'm really surprised that the technician at the spa is also very good!
In short, I am really happy to spend three days and two nights here~

Compared with Atlantis where I lived the day before, Park Hyatt is much quieter and suitable for real relaxing travel. The scenery is beautiful, the entire coast is contracted, the sand is white, very fine, and the sea water is blue. Every day, people clean up sea**** and coral. The service is good, the butler Fairy is professional, polite and enthusiastic, responds quickly and responds to requests, and even gave a small gift before leaving. The breakfast is rich, several restaurants are very beautiful, and the standard is relatively high, especially a male waiter in the Yue hall, unfortunately I didn't remember his name, he was very polite and impressive. Two suggestions: One is that the sanitation of outdoor swimming and bath towels provided by the sea needs to be improved. I am not the only one who mentioned that it is too dirty, with rust spots and blood spots. The second is the swimming pool and the transparent boats and surfboards on the seaside. It would be great if they could be provided to residents for free. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt care about the 200 yuan, but I just think it‚Äôs not good to pay for it.

In general, it is worthy of being the work of Jean-Michel Gathy, the royal designer of Amman. No matter the site selection, architecture, landscape and interior design, inside and outside, it is beyond the reach of other hotels in Sanya.

Those who like art and petty bourgeoisie feel that it is worth experiencing. Apart from various art exhibits that can be traced back to the original author, the design style of the entire hotel is very artistic, and even a corridor and a hall are not unique. make you feel pale
When I first arrived at the hotel and saw their lobby, I felt that being the front desk is also a happy job, because the appearance of the lobby is full of ritual. Here is a real name like the lady at the front desk [Carol Hu Luolong] who provided detailed explanations and helped us mark the various places we need to go and the business hours on the hotel map. For this big hotel that will get lost if you are not careful, The map is simply super friendly
We live on the 7th floor of Building 5, which belongs to the echelon with excellent viewing angles. The full-frame horizontal windows provide a panoramic view of the coconut grove, the sea, the small white boats and motorboats on the sea, the lighthouse and mountains in the distance. It's just too good to take pictures!
On the night of check-in, because it was a honeymoon trip, the hotel arranged themed decorations for us, and also prepared a dessert made by the hotel. You can eat in places like this. Like our butler [Gary Wang Fei] by real name here. After we asked, he directly prepared another dessert and put it in our room. It was pleasantly surprised and heartwarming.
Park Hyatt Hotel also has check-in gifts. I didn‚Äôt forget to ask the hotel staff. What we got was a huge straw hat and a cute teddy bear. [Jack Zheng Yishu] the housekeeper specially came to give us gifts, really So delicate, beautiful and practical
There are two breakfast restaurants here. One is the full buffet restaurant in Yueting Hall. There are quite a variety of varieties. Remember to go early. We arrived at around 9:30 on the first day, and Yueting Hall could not accommodate it. Liked the staff [William Jujiahao] by real name. Seeing us waiting for a seat, he immediately helped us coordinate another semi-buffet restaurant in Qinyuan. It is a small and quiet space with few but fine dishes.
Others include a 150-meter-long outdoor infinity pool, a family children's pool, a visual library of a house of cards, and a soft white sand beach. The whole hotel is a place where you can slow down and play for two or three days, and the service experience is also superb ,highly recommended! ! !

Park Hyatt Sanya is located in the private area of Sun Bay, Longshou, Yalong Bay, surrounded by mountains on three sides and the sea on one side, with an extremely superior geographical location. The most beautiful mountain-sea highway is to enjoy the magnificent sea and sky. It has become a check-in point for Internet celebrities. Along the way, you can see many self-driving teams and people queuing up to take pictures.

The hotel is ingeniously built by internationally renowned design masters. It is a post-modern, simple and retro Chinese style that I like. The interior and exterior are full of design. More than a thousand collections of artworks are displayed throughout the hotel, as if you are in an art museum. My favorite is the Yuehai Library, which is more transparent, brighter and more artistic than Capella's living room and book bar.
The 6 buildings of the hotel are designed like a labyrinth. At first, I was a little dizzy. I love and hate each other haha üòÇüòÇ But after walking back and forth for a few times, I became familiar with it and found the best route. Buildings can be connected by the 2nd floor It is connected with the corridor on the 5th floor, or you can take a short cut from the outdoor path to connect in a straight line. One scene at a time, one scene at a time, one turn around and one corner at a time, it is a different kind of scenery, big love, big love, great praiseüëçüëç

Hotel catering is remarkable! The all-day restaurant's open kitchen Yue Hall, breakfast has your favorite freshly squeezed orange juice, smoked salmon, and your favorite croissant, which is freshly baked and delivered to the table, and you can eat three in one goüòãüòãüòãTraditional and diverse Chinese style The tea garden where you can cook, you can taste the signature Cantonese dim sum at lunch time, the shrimp dumpling spring rolls and fried rice are excellent, and there are also indoor and outdoor lounges and observation decks Happy Hour with daily special cocktails and snacks with different themes, beautiful scenery Food and wine should not be too beautiful üòçüòçüòç

In short, this Park Hyatt vacation experience is perfect‚Äº Ô∏èOut of 5 starsüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüPraise‚Äº Ô∏èSpecial thanks to Tingting Fairy, Guest Experience Depar**ent, for the service indexüíØ‚Äº Ô∏èAlthough we have only been together for a short time, they are like friends who have known each other for a long time.

There is also a specially rented boat in the swimming pool that can be used to take pictures, but the film must be released when the weather is good!
Let's talk about the service again, thank you very much for Sily's care and Mina's arrangement. There will be a butler in each room to serve you at any time, and will help you with everything big and small, really caring! The hotel's activities are actively arranged at any time.
The beach and sea water are also very good, because there is only this hotel around here, the privacy is very good, and there are few people, so the natural environment is very well protected, the sea water is very blue and very clean!
In the end, parents also had a lot of fun on this trip, which is very suitable for families and girlfriends! It is worth choosing Park Hyatt üíì

msg:Room: The experience of the full sea view room is really great, and it is refreshing to look at. There is nothing to dislike about bedding and bathroom. But the traces of the years can be seen, the ground and tables with mottled traces. If you like a brand new room with no traces of use, you may mind, but cleanliness is more important to me, so there is no problem
Hotel environment: As said on the Internet, it has a museum a**osphere. I personally think that the design sense is very strong, and I can feel the charm of the design. The light and shadow effect formed by the lights at night is particularly charming. Walking in the hotel, I feel that the whole soul has been sublimated. Quiet, quiet, very enjoyable feeling. All kinds of Internet celebrity check-in points in the outdoor environment can be patted, and my wife is very happy. The wind on the beach is really strong, and the sea is beautiful
Diet: All are settled in the Chinese restaurant of the hotel. The breakfast buffet was good. Lunch and dinner are eaten at the Chinese restaurant. There are no surprises but no surprises. It is no problem to eat a few meals a day. The highlight of the audience is the delicious green vegetables, especially wild vegetables.
Service: Musk from the Guest Experience Depar**ent of Joyful Ambassador is responsible for the reception. The overall experience is very good. You can ask any questions you don't understand, and you can find them for any help you need. This time I was in a hurry, otherwise I really wanted to stay for a day or two longer.

Sometimes, walking on the hotel's private beach to pick up shells, accepting the waves beating your toes and looking at the boat on the sparkling waves in the distance can be self-consistent and healing. After eating breakfast, Chinese food, afternoon tea, and going to the bar in the hotel, I felt that it was a hassle to go out, and it made people like the feeling of escapism.

Environment: beautiful! One step at a time, I often feel that shopping is not enough, so I must take the time to go around

Service: Except when we checked in, it was said that the front desk computer was not working well, which took us more than half an hour to check in successfully. The supreme sea view room I originally booked was not as good-looking as it was on Ctrip. It was said that I went late, and all good room types without obstructions were selected. I thought that I have come all the time, and I must live without hindrance, so I spent 350 a night to upgrade to a selected sea view room. I also thank the housekeeper, Ms. Ruby, for giving us two small gifts as a welcome gift~Thank you

Overall, it is recommended, and I will come again in the future

msg:This honeymoon trip specially arranged for two nights at the Park Hyatt Hotel, which has been planted for a long time. I experienced the services that a luxury hotel should have, from the honeymoon decoration in the room to the fruit plate, and then the butler Xiaodong responded to our calls at any time. There are many meticulous details Things are well organized. Share a few small details: 1. The housekeeper specially prepared two bouquets of red roses, one big and one small. I am very happy. 2. The room service aunt helped us clean the wheels of the suitcase, and my wife was surprised. 3. My wife ordered a pair of slippers on the phone, and then we went out for a stroll, and when we came back, we saw the slippers in the bag at the door, and there was a meticulous handwritten note. 4. When the weather is good, you can snorkel directly in the glass sea yyds on the beach to see the fish. Are there any more? There are still schools of ten and eight kinds of fish. I really enjoy the feeling of chasing fish freely in the sea. 5. Find a good time to go to the sea, small crabs are also easy to catch, my wife and I have a lot of harvest... In short, this is a trip worth remembering.
Special reminder, the hotel should be booked in advance, check the weather and other conditions, if the weather is bad, it will affect the experience if you can't go to the sea. The hotel has the elegant temperament of an art gallery, and the corridors and libraries are very good!

msg:Park Hyatt is really YYDS! Getting a welcome text from housekeeper Ella long before check-in was a big relief. When I checked in at the front desk, Carol's warm reception made me feel like a spring breeze. Park Hyatt is full of works of art, and the feeling of walking into an art museum and palace is especially my appetite! The window of the supreme sea view room looks very vast, and the mood suddenly brightens. Park Hyatt's beach is also the most beautiful, but it's a pity that the wind has been strong and the temperature has been low these two days, otherwise I really couldn't help but jump into the water, and the 130-meter infinity pool is simply too tempting, even at night it is beautiful. The price of Park Hyatt during the Spring Festival is not low, but it is actually full of rooms. It can be seen that Park Hyatt is really popular, and there are still many people with good taste hahaha! The most commendable thing is the enthusiastic and sincere service of every service staff in Park Hyatt, who are very professional and kind. The snacks and drinks delivered in the room are of high quality and can be eaten all day. Park Hyatt is full of scenery, and Bojue, who I found a partner with the hotel, is very good at taking pictures. In the end, I spent 2,000 yuan to make a photo album. The attitude of Bojue is much better than that of Lizi‚Äôs Bojue. It is not so pushy and there is no pressure. I was very satisfied with the whole process, and it will definitely be a place I will come to often in the future.

You can shoot blockbuster movies in any corner of the hotel. There are many online celebrities, but they will not be very noisy. Although it is not a parent-child hotel, the baby still had a good time, the band performance was great, and the Valentine's Day check-in also caught up with a couple's engagement ceremony, which really revealed romance everywhere.

msg:The overall environment is very good, like an art gallery. This year's windy waves and low temperature have reduced the fun of playing in the water. The sea view room booked by a friend is cheaper than the supreme sea view room I booked, but the view is even better. I was full of questions and the hotel staff responded quickly and explained. Basically, the supreme sea view is closer to the sea and more convenient, but the floor is relatively low, and the view may not be as good as ordinary sea view rooms. The restaurant is basically full until the meal is not pleasant, even after public holidays, which is surprising. Stayed for 5 days, it would be perfect if the weather was warmer. I will go again next time I find a chance

msg:After passing the most beautiful Sunny Bay Seaside Highway, you will arrive at Park Hyatt. There is a check-in counter in every corner of the lobby with a great sense of design. The flow of people is not crowded, and there are many rest areas. You can see the scenery everywhere in the hotel, just like walking into a museum and art palace.
Let me talk about the service and details first: I have to say that they are meticulous. The day before check-in, a staff member came to confirm the itinerary with me and briefly introduced the restaurant. After check-in, the exclusive butler Fairy came to greet us immediately. He clearly explained the convenient paths of each building and the business hours of restaurants and swimming pools on the small map of the hotel, and marked them well. At the same time, there are check-in tips, in addition to welcome Fruits, we also specially gave us coconuts, the hotel's special souvenirs; on the rest day, I did not forget to send cut fruits, and the messages were replied in time, very considerate. The little bear is really cute, and my friends like it very much. It‚Äôs also fate, we went around a few times but couldn‚Äôt find the place, and we met Fairy on the way to work. It was she who first noticed that we seemed to be "lost", and then followed her... The importance of the housekeeper (we must always remember the housekeeper‚Äôs reminder ). It should also be mentioned that the room service is also very good, it will be replenished when it is used up, and I feel that there are new surprises every time I go back to the room. In the afternoon, chocolates and Madeleine macarons were also delivered, and it was too late to eat. The telephone at the elevator entrance is very useful, and you can talk when you lift it up (because you forgot to bring your room card when you went downstairs to swim, you don't need to go to the lobby, the staff will come).
In terms of food and entertainment: the breakfast is rich, and I like crispy chocolate rolls the most. Go early and avoid queuing. If there are many people for dinner, I think the set meal in the cafeteria is pretty good. The western restaurant is also good, I like black truffle pizza, lobster soup and cappuccino soup are delicious (but the amount is a bit small). I have eaten at Tea Garden three times. I personally think it is the most cost-effective restaurant in the nearby hotels. The taste is good and the environment is beautiful. I like rice with lobster and black pork barbecued pork. I have eaten both.
The hotel also provides a special art tour, with a special person to lead the explanation, walk in the promenade to understand the displayed artworks, suggestion: add some hotel design concepts.
The 130-meter swimming pool is beautiful, and you can rent paddle boards and kayaks to take pictures on it. The sand on the beach is very fine and white, and the independent bay is beautiful, which is different from other places.
Finally, the room: clean and bright, with an unobstructed view of Sunshine Bay, the effect of the mirror is more open, the washing and washing are good, the toothbrush has small soft bristles, and the folding comb has some static electricity. A suggestion: The switch is adjusted on the drawer of the bedside cabinet instead of the usual wall. Because the colors are relatively similar, it is easy to be ignored, but it is beautiful. You can remind it when you check in next time.

Location traffic:
Located in Sunny Bay, as far as I know, there are only Park Hyatt and St. Regis in this area, so it is very quiet and very convenient to drive here. Passing by the holy land of Internet celebrities, the coastal road connecting the sea and the sky, the aerial photography must be very good. All kinds of open-top trotting girls on the road are very good. interesting haha

Service: The service personnel in each position perform their own duties, are professional and well-educated, which is very rare and very satisfying! Special thanks to Sily from the Guest Experience Depar**ent who has been in touch with us on WeChat from the very beginning. The service is very thoughtful and warm. Compared with other five-star hotels in Sanya that we have stayed in recently that also provide butler service, the service of Park Hyatt Hotel is mature and successfully meets the requirements. Our expectation!

From the overall building to the public area to the rooms, the whole hotel is full of scenery every step of the way. The artistic a**osphere is extremely strong, the taste is very high, the light, the details of the internal and external landscapes reflect the intentions everywhere

Exquisite fruit snacks, chocolates and various drinks in the Mini bar, turndown desserts, sleep aids, essential oils, a wide variety of everything you expect, a buffet breakfast, everything reflects high-quality humanization, and a Happy Hour is given every night. The male singer's voice is especially charming

In addition, I feel that the sea view here is the best compared to Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay. The color of the sea and the prospect of coconut groves are so beautiful. I like this hotel so much. I hope it can be maintained forever!

msg:Park Hyatt Sunny Bay is located at the end of the Internet celebrity seaside road, surrounded by mountains and rivers, with pleasant scenery. The design of the entire hotel is very fashionable, and it is also very pleasant to walk in the corridors full of artistic a**osphere. The window on the front of the room faces the sea, and the mirror on the side desk extends the sea view in front of the window, and the privacy is very good. Although the room is not big, the division of functional areas is very reasonable. The only regret is that there is no balcony and no ventilation. The fashion design of hotel buildings always abandons some functional requirements.
The hotel's outdoor 130-meter infinity pool is sure to be a major feature. Since it is not a heated swimming pool, the temperature was low during the stay, so the children experienced paddle boards and boats in the outdoor swimming pool. It is easy to get stuck on the paddle board and the boat at the edge of the swimming pool, and it will be a little rough. Children should pay attention to safety when playing.
Although there are not many types of breakfast, but the taste is very delicious, our family likes it. The quality of Cantonese cuisine in Chayuan is also good, but the serving is really slow. The happy hour on the observation deck at 5:30 pm every day, drinks + snacks + wonderful music, the experience is very good, especially if you choose an outdoor location.
But for boys aged 9+, this hotel is not very playable. The temperature picked up on the day we left the store, and the children finally had a good time in the kiddie pool.

I am very grateful to Ella, the guest experience depar**ent of Yuexiang Ambassador, for providing a lot of help during the stay. Wechat inquiries or reservation services are very timely responses.

There was also a little unpleasantness during the stay, which also made us meet Sam, the guest experience manager. Thanks to Sam for communicating with us in time, so that the unhappy mood can be calmed down.

Things to improve: When we got off the car and entered the hotel lobby, we didn't meet the welcome staff, so we wondered if we got off at the wrong location. It is suggested that the hotel service staff can be more enthusiastic and considerate, so that guests can feel that this is a warm hotel.

msg:The most satisfying part of my trip to Sanya this time was the Park Hyatt Hotel. Unfortunately, I arranged Park Hyatt two days before my itinerary, which made me miss Park Hyatt every time I changed hotels, haha!

Service: Enthusiastic, caring, meticulous, and very attentive to the sense of boundaries. The butler silver is very nice. He added WeChat in advance and upgraded me to a sea view room for free. He also arranged a super honeymoon layout and wrote a handwritten letter. It was warm and move.

Facilities: The hotel has a great swimming pool and gym. There is a happy hour in the afternoon. You can listen to nice jazz songs and drink~ There are also many landscapes full of design. We don‚Äôt even bother to go out. We go twice a day in the hotel Ten thousand steps to take pictures.

Hygiene: The cleaning is quite good, cleaned twice a day, and the bottles and jars on the dressing table are neatly arranged for me.

Environment: The garden landscape design is very beautiful, the lawn is very soft, the sand on the beach is very fine, and there are guards checking whether you can check in when entering and leaving Sunny Bay, so the privacy is quite good, and there are few people on the beach.


Breakfast: Some points may be deducted for this. The breakfast variety is not too rich, and the desserts are the best. The Chinese food is not particularly suitable for my taste.

Daily mini bar drinks and snacks: This is a big compliment to Park Hyatt, very generous, prepared delicious chocolates and Snickers bars, desserts will be delivered every night, the drinks in the minibar are my favorite, apple juice, and The front desk said generously and sent me three bottles, which was so touching.

Snacks and drinks on the viewing platform: the songs are nice, the cocktails are delicious, but the snacks are not particularly satisfying haha~

The only hotel in Sunny Bay, the scenery is beautiful, the beach can be seen to be paved with white sand like flour, and there are employees cleaning and tidying it up.
Service: During the stay, the butler Fairy cared about my needs every day and fulfilled my wish in time, thank you very much.
Daily minibar drinks and snacks: The drinks and snacks are of high quality, and there are too many to eat.
Snacks and drinks on the viewing platform: the scenery is beautiful, there are more seats, and there are many types of drinks.
Facilities: The Internet celebrity swimming pool is quite beautiful, but the weather is too cold to get into the water.
The overall feeling is very quiet, this is still the peak season. In case there are few people in the off-season, people who are afraid of loneliness may feel a little deserted. It is suitable for couples to nest together and spend time slowly.

msg:This time, I was looking forward to the hotel in Sanya, but I was also very disappointed.
First of all, the public area of the hotel is very good. Everywhere you pass has a sense of design. Every place is beautiful and surprising. In addition, the service is the most disappointing. The service of Park Hyatt...
From getting off the car to pick up the luggage to the front desk, they are almost passive, and we call people to help
The check-in at the front desk is also quite ugly. I am impatient to ask anything, and I don‚Äôt care if you can understand it or not after talking to the map.
After arriving at the room, the welcome fruit Shatangju is very good. I thought I could ask the front desk to send more. If there is no problem, I can also send it. In the end, I waited all day and did not see the fruit delivered... You can directly say that you can't send it, it's fine...
The service of the hotel's Chinese restaurant really doesn't match the positioning of your hotel. From ordering to serving, it's all in ink, and there's no service to speak of. The hot pot is not lighted when it is served, and no one cares if we don‚Äôt ask... Anyway, it is a hot pot with 800+ per capita, and the taste is the same. The bottom of the coconut soup is extremely bland...

Furthermore, the hotel bar has a very good a**osphere. We came over for a drink after dinner at night. At the end of the checkout, we also reported the room number, but the power bank was omitted. The hotel cashier knew our room number. Why didn‚Äôt we contact the front desk to deliver the items we picked up? return? We didn't find out and no one told us. A little disappointed
Finally, the day of departure. I called the room service to take the luggage over there. I waited for more than 20 minutes and no one came to pick it up. I was really speechless. I walked over and checked out by myself...
In short, to experience the environment and entertainment, it is a good choice to come here for vacation, but if you are looking for service, this place really does not match their positioning.

msg:Service: Thanks to the butler Xiao Du (Mint) for allowing me and my family to have such a good holiday. It is widely praised, especially the elderly like to take pictures, and the children like the beach. The hotel is No1 in Sanya. The keyword is less people, beautiful scenery and good service . I have stayed in several other hotels, and the service and all aspects are not as good as Park Hyatt, from the tea break when waiting for the room (as shown in the self-service style), to the beautiful scenery, to the gift of various fruits and snacks in the room, which leads to five meals a day, to the observation deck Cocktails (live singing), breakfast, tea garden (live guzheng performance), all are considered by the whole family to be the best in Sanya, even if the room is close to full, the service has not declined. The child accidentally dropped the fork, and I didn't notice it. The waiter immediately sent a new one. All in all, 200% satisfied with the service.

Facilities and hygiene: very new, very clean, the elderly like toilets, children like bathtubsüõÅ, all kinds of children's products are provided in place.

Environment: Not to mention the interior of the room and the environment of the hotel, it enjoys an exclusive bay with few people, white sandy beaches, and blue sea water. It really catches up with the seas of the United States and Australia, and is even better than the Maldives I have been to.

In short, I will come again, thank you Miss Mint for taking care of our family, and give Hyatt Park Hyatt a super praise!

msg:Strongly recommend Park Hyatt Sanya Sunny Bay, it is a hotel that you want to buy again!
One of the biggest advantages compared with other hotels is that there are about 200 guest rooms, and the flow of people is controlled, so the service quality has been significantly improved! There are obviously fewer guests with children than other resort hotels, so it will not be too noisy, suitable for those who want to have a private vacation!
Because there are a lot of people in the Spring Festival season and the weather is a bit cold, I only stayed for one night and did not get into the 130-meter net red swimming pool and private beach. I am a little regretful. I plan to check it out on April 2!
Service: Ruby, the housekeeper, contacted in advance one day before check-in, and the service was very considerate until the check-out period, super nice! Because of the peak season, we waited for a long time after arriving at 1 o'clock. Ruby arranged a tea break for us and gave us a small gift. Fortunately, we also planned to rest at Yuehai for reading, which is acceptable. The staff at the front desk, Chinese restaurant, observation deck, breakfast, etc. are all very good. I haven‚Äôt encountered any bad service attitude or inadequate service.
Environment: The environment of the hotel is so lovely. I like the interior and exterior design very much. It is a painting from different angles. In Yuehai, you can calm down and read a book, look up at the sea in the distance, and see the Chinese-style and modern interior design nearby.
Daily minibar drinks and snacks: all are free! The welcome fruit is very fresh, and the chocolate and macarons are really delicious!
Snacks and drinks on the observation deck: don‚Äôt miss the free happyhour in the evening! Cocktails are sweet and suitable for girls!

Still very satisfied! Ruby from the guest experience depar**ent contacted me before I checked in, asked about my check-in needs, and greeted me in the lobby when I arrived at the hotel. During the two days of check-in, I tracked all my needs and gave guests an excellent check-in experience. The hotel environment and facilities are first-class. Although the breakfast is not as rich as that of Haitang Bay, it is still exquisite. Apart from the serious problem of queuing up during the Chinese New Year, there is nothing wrong with it. The service in the hotel is also very good. The room is well organized without over-service, making people feel comfortable. I called and asked for more mineral water, and immediately delivered 10 bottles. The hotel's beach is particularly good, the independent beach, the sand is very white and fine, and Sunny Bay is one of the few beaches in Sanya where you can go into the water. If you come in a warmer season, I believe it will be a good experience. There are a few shortcomings: First, there are forklifts cleaning the beach all the time, which is a bit unpleasant; second, the outdoor swimming pools in the hotel are not heated. The family swimming pool is completely a decoration at this time, and the children are all crowded in the small room. In the swimming pool, there is a lack of outdoor experience that Sanya hotels should have. Thirdly, several flush faucets along the way back from the beach are broken, and there is no place to wash the sand on their feet. Many guests can only go to the outdoor swimming pool to wash with water. This is not good. Aside from these points, this place can be described as perfect, it is really good, and I will definitely come again!

I made the birthday arrangement in advance~ In the evening, I also gave me a birthday cake and a big straw hat (I really appreciate this hat in Sanya all the time. Wearing hahahaha) also recommended super delicious restaurants in the city!

The butler was very busy, but he still took us around the hotel. The three days we stayed in the hotel were not monotonous at all. We also had a spa session and ate western and Chinese food. They were all delicious!

I have lived in many five-star hotels, and Park Hyatt is really the yyds in my mind, both in terms of service and aesthetics!

I will definitely recommend Park Hyatt to everyone! ! And my butler! ! Hope 2023 will be smoother because of this trip!

There are bedbugs in the room, and there is a moldy smell. There is no wifi in the swimming pool. The breakfast room is very poor, very small, and there is no tableware. Four people were given a fork for dining. The waiters in Yuequ Camp are quite friendly, and others are indifferent. The room is quite old. The plug of the hair dryer is a British plug, but the bathroom socket is broken. The whole hotel feels old, although there are many artworks on display. , and all kinds of hanging paintings, sofas or benches on various promenades, but we don‚Äôt live in corridors, aisles or corners.

The whole experience is very good. There will be a dedicated butler to contact you the day before check-in. It is very heartwarming. The gate will check the order to enter, and the privacy is very strong. The hotel has an entire beach to itself. The white sand is beautiful and soft. Walking with my husband feels that all the troubles have disappeared, and there are few people. There is no noise and hustle and bustle. Immerse yourself in the beauty of the beach , enjoy time slowing down
The entire display and facilities are very high-end, like participating in an art exhibition, there are Chinese and Western styles, a perfect combination, many times a day and lingering
The service is very thoughtful. Ella, the housekeeper in the experience depar**ent, is very gentle and caring. Fruits, pastries, slippers, etc. were placed in the room when we went out for afternoon tea. We were also invited to participate in some activities and gave us a small gift. We were very happy
What I like most about the room is the picture frame window and the bathtub. A large picture is produced in minutes. The moment I open the door, I feel relaxed and happy. I also like the deep but continuous pattern design of the washing area and the front hall. It has a sense of design, and the texture of the bathtub is very good. Take a bubble to relieve the fatigue of the day
All in all, it was a great staying experience, and I will come again next time~

msg:One day before arriving at the Park Hyatt, the hotel's cultural and tourism specialists had already contacted in advance. It is not ruled out that there are differences in the policies and benefits of different booking platforms. This alone increases the enthusiasm of guests to give the hotel a good review in the future. Until check-out, all aspects of the hotel left people with too many impressive and perfect experiences. In the end, they changed from giving the hotel a good review to spontaneously wanting to write a long review.
When you meet a beautiful woman on a beautiful journey, there is good news when you watch the sea. This time I brought my wife to the store, we were greeted by Ms. Lily, who has a sweet and gentle voice. During the stay in the store, Lily gave the most considerate service with great enthusiasm, and praised by name. May I ask the store where I can buy rockets~
The following is to share some of the beauty of Park Hyatt Sunny Bay in as much detail as possible, hoping to provide reference for visiting guests.

Hotel environment: five stars. Sitting in the first-class bay area, the water quality and sea view are well-known throughout the country. The only "glass sea" in Sanya can only be photographed on the beach of the hotel. On the one hand, Sunny Bay is an estuary for ocean currents. After years of seawater washing, this sea area is very clean. On the one hand, it is not located in a densely populated area like several other luxury hotels, so the possibility of commercial pollution is extremely small. On the other hand, the hotel also pays attention to the protection of the bay area. The two buildings closest to the sea are estimated to have stepped on the 50-meter red line , the store also directly disables it. Therefore, if you come to Sanya to watch the sea and play in the water, you must consider the quality of the sea water first. You are right to choose Park Hyatt Sunny Bay! The second is the unique outdoor sea view. The hotel retains a large area of palm gardens, so that no matter whether the floor of the room is high or low, the proportion of palm + sea in the mirror only exists, and there is no good or bad scene. Any lens can become a work. This time we are in the No. 3 room on the top floor of the 5 buildings that are close to the sea but far away from the functional area, and we have harvested the beautiful pictures of this season.

Room experience: five stars. The reviewer is a movie fan, and has a special liking for the 16:9 ultra-wide interface. In addition, the common sense in the film industry that "widescreen is more like a movie lens image", when entering the room for the first time, it was designed by the Park Hyatt designer. Attracted by the wide viewing window‚Äîisn‚Äôt this an ultra-wide "movie" that makes people fascinated and lingering in their dreams~ Soft drinks in the minibar and regular desserts in the afternoon can make people enjoy the whole afternoon happily Time, staying at home is also a comfortable paradise!

Artistic a**osphere: I want to add more than five stars. Let me mention a small detail here first. The store is too friendly to the guests. The doors are open everywhere. It feels like it allows and encourages the guests to walk around and visit freely. At night, I have been to business banquet halls, restaurants, various functional areas, and even almost walked into the back kitchen. The hidden door opened as soon as I pushed it. Compared with other hotels' closed management that cannot be entered without a reservation, it can be called humanistic care. . Thousands of works and decorations by artists from all over the world. Every corner is extremely elegant. While waiting for the elevator, touch and take a look for more than ten seconds. After passing through multiple public areas, go to the bar for a cocktailüç∏Entrance, the glass is empty Yes, but the heart is full. It is beyond words, and you can taste it slowly after you check in. After leaving the hotel, I went to a certain hotel with the highest price in Haitang Bay. It has its own characteristics, but I can no longer taste the a**osphere of art, which is a kind of gap.

The above three points are just the three best impressions of staying at Park Hyatt Sunny Bay for the first time. I plan to save the compliments of thousands of words and tell them the next time I bring my family over.

Finally, I would like to like and thank Lily again. The beauty has a natural affinity, so I hope the store will consider it and keep it.

If you are poets, mountains and stars, you can come to Park Hyatt.

The beach of the hotel is privately enjoyed, the water is clear and the sand is fine, and the color of the sea is lovely.
The hotel service is very meticulous. Ella, the guest experience depar**ent, gave us meticulous service arrangements, reminders before check-in, afternoon tea arrangements during check-in, and she also took the initiative to help us because I forgot to issue a catering invoice after leaving the hotel.
Should have the opportunity to come again.

When I arrived, the hotel housekeeper, Xiaodong, gave me a detailed introduction to the hotel situation and location, and helped me arrange the room. The service is warm. The rooms are stylishly designed and comfortable. In the past two days, the overall feeling is "home away from home". Sun Island Haitang Bay is well-deserved of its reputation. I met two drivers who said that this hotel is better than other famous Internet celebrity hotels. I will definitely come again next time~ I added a good memory to my trip to Sanya

The housekeeper Xiaodong is also very good! The introduction is very detailed and the service is very thoughtful!
The little friends said that when they come to Sanya in the future, they will live in Sunny Bay Boyue every day!
The beach here is also very blue, and the sand is very white and fine. photo perfect

msg:Since the epidemic began in early 2020, this is my fourth trip to Sanya and I have stayed in more than a dozen hotels. In this special case, only Sanya is the safest.
Park Hyatt is considered a super five-star hotel, and all luxury hotels in Sanya can be regarded as the best. In the innermost part of Yalong Bay, it is very quiet.
The overall design of the hotel is very elegant and beautiful, especially the use of red, which reflects the designer's superb artistic level.
The decoration materials are also very good, many of which are made of wood, which looks high-grade, especially in the old days, even if it has a sense of time, it will not look shabby. The hotel also uses a lot of marble materials, which are much better than those of many five-star hotels.
Sculptures and handicrafts can be seen everywhere in the hotel. Strolling around during your stay will not be boring. The bathroom is also very nice.
The outdoor swimming pool is 130 meters long. It is the first time I have seen such a long swimming pool. It is very beautiful and people who like swimming will like it very much. There is a heated swimming pool indoors. There is also a pool. The swimming pools are well decorated and designed everywhere. The staff of the indoor swimming pool opened multiple floor-to-ceiling doors, and the ventilation is very good. During the epidemic, guests can rest assured that they have no worries.
We will check in on December 19, 2022, balcony sea view room, 3500 yuan, including breakfast. The rooms are beautiful. If the chairs on the balcony are replaced with sofas that can lie on, it will be more comfortable and more holiday-like.
Breakfast is available both indoors and outdoors. We eat it outdoors. It is very safe and will never be infected with the virus. You can also enjoy the scenery while eating. This is one of the main reasons why we choose to come to Sanya for vacation.
During the two nights of stay, I participated in the activities of cozy time. Very good, the male singer sang English songs very well.
A suggestion to the hotel: Ventilation is not good enough. In the face of this epidemic, ventilation is the most important, far more than disinfection of furniture, elevators and other facilities, because this is a respiratory disease. I will tell you this with the professional knowledge of a medical staff importance. There are many windows in the corridor of the guest room. I tried, but none of them can be opened. The lobby should also open the doors and windows as much as possible for ventilation.
The gym facilities are very good, but the doors and windows are closed and cannot be opened for ventilation, so I dare not exercise.
Generally speaking, the hotel is high-end and a**ospheric, and of course it is more expensive. But the price is reasonable. Recommended to stay.
Finally, I would like to praise Cora from the Guest Experience Depar**ent for her caring, considerate and polite service.

We booked an ordinary room for 2,000 per night. Butler Xiaodong worked very hard to help us apply for a room upgrade. Sanya had just released the regulations. At this time, the resources for sea view rooms were extremely tight, and we were actually upgraded! Although it is not the Supreme View Building No. 5 of last year, at least you can see the sea when you open the window.
Every time I go out and come back, the water I drank, the towels I used, and the bathrobes I used are all replaced with new ones. I go out in the afternoon and come back with a bowl of fruit, and when I come back in the evening, there is a dessert on the table. No matter when I come back, the ice in the ice bucket will be replaced with new ones, just like Santa Claus who keeps surprising me.
The most important thing is that the breakfast at the Park Hyatt is the best breakfast buffet I have ever had in a hotel. Even though the breakfast room is small, everything is carefully prepared and delicious.
Anyway, if I had money, I would come every year

After staying for one night, it was too hot, so I checked out immediately. I booked the Park Hyatt temporarily. After I came, I regretted not booking earlier. There are very few people during the epidemic. But the service and the physical goods didn't cut corners at all.
The beach is white, clean and very quiet. We took a look on the map and it should be the Hilton Marriott, and the right side should be Wild Boar Island.
I came to Park Hyatt just for breakfast. Really worthy of the room rate price. Relatively speaking, the breakfast in Atlantis is so-so
Park Hyatt's breakfast is exquisite, with waffles and muffins and plates. All kinds of delicious food. The belly is round.
In addition, there are LELABO toiletries, which are really tall.
Special thanks to Sam, Guest Experience Manager. If you have any questions, please reply in time. When we left the store, we were sent to the garage downstairs. Thank you!
I hope I still have time to come next year, so I don‚Äôt have to hesitate to go to the hotel directly.

As Chris**as approaches, there are Chris**as elements everywhere in the hotel. I have to say that the Park Hyatt goes well with Chris**as and New Year‚Äôs Day. The black, red and gold tones are extremely timeless. The person who received us was Taylor, the head of the housekeeping depar**ent, who was very nice and considerate. It was my birthday and he gave me a cake and red wine. After arriving at the hotel, we paid to upgrade to a full sea view room. Living on the highest floor, you can have a panoramic view of the entire Sun Bay. . Breakfast is okay, I recommend the Baoluo noodle soup, wontons, radish beef brisket noodles, papaya guava, and the birthday noodle soup is also very delicious. It‚Äôs nice to take a photo on the swimming pool lawn after breakfast, but it‚Äôs cold in Sanya in winter, so it‚Äôs not recommended to go into the swimming pool, it‚Äôs very cold. At the happy hour at the observation deck, the food was average and the singing was okay, but I didn‚Äôt really like it. On the first night, I simply had Chinese food at Tea Garden, which was very average. The second night I had Western food. The bread before the meal was average, the ham was okay, the soup was recommended, and the steak was average and not recommended. . I recommend everyone to experience an art journey. Just like visiting an exhibition, you will take photos with you to check-in spots to unlock some hidden beauty. . Overall, the environment is very nice and private, full marks üíØ. The room facilities are good and hygienic. It would be nice if there is facial cleanser. Service is normal. Meals are generally passable. A small suggestion, it would be great if the maritime safety area could be expanded a little more, and more reefs could be added so that you can snorkel and see small fishes. By the way, wear a life jacket. .

msg:Sanya Bank didn't plan to come to Park Hyatt, because I didn't like the overall black and red style of the pictures, but I always wanted to find a place where I could go to the sea and catch the sea, so Sanya Bank chose Xiaodonghai for the last two nights, there I stayed for one night and decided to check out. I won't say much about how bad it was. I decided to change to Park Hyatt temporarily. After arriving, I regret not coming earlier! ! It's so comfortable, the service, hotel environment, and the beach are all so good~
The design of the hotel is very beautiful, of course it is indeed a bit dark, but it is still very classy;
Sun Bay is the beach with the most foreign island feel that Sanya has seen this time. It is very beautiful. The pictures have no filters. It looks like this. Of course, it is an exaggeration to say that it is comparable to the Maldives. It's already great. The two-year-old baby is very happy to swim in the sea. It is much better than Yalong Bay. The sand that has been repaired in Yalong Bay is terrible. It is thicker than the sand in Haitang Bay. The color is brown, not good, and the waves are not small. let the baby go to sea;
In terms of service, I think it is very good. I booked a sea view suite. The hotel originally arranged a room on a high floor with a good view and a sea view, but I didn't want to live too far. It would be troublesome to walk to the seaside, so I asked to change it to Building 7. The floor is on the lower floor. The hotel quickly adjusted the room for me, and also arranged the baby's starry sky tent. Every staff member of the hotel is very kind and caring. There is a customer service butler. Special thanks to the housekeeper vivian sun, who is very thoughtful and attentive ~
Because I especially like Park Hyatt and Sun Bay, I finally decided to change the ticket and stay at Park Hyatt for one more night~
However, I have to talk about the shortcomings. The hotel is very good, but there are few children's facilities and activities. If the baby doesn't like the beach and doesn't like going to the sea, it will actually be boring. Generally speaking, Park Hyatt is more suitable for couples.

I casually asked if there is Lingshui acid powder for breakfast. I didn‚Äôt expect that Jeffrey would help me to confirm the menu for tomorrow morning, and a colleague came out to explain the preparation of the dishes to me. Quite unexpected. Although there is no sour powder, I was very moved by his intentions, and his attentive service was not at all for a good review, so when I asked him what his name was, he obviously didn't expect it. The special juice for breakfast is very delicious. The resort a**osphere of the whole hotel is particularly strong, and the scenery is superb. The room is on the 9th floor, with a really invincible sea view, and the hotel's beach is also beautiful, but what I like the most is the coconut grove next to the 130-meter swimming pool. Although it was rainy the next day, the coconut grove is still beautiful. Great, I will go again next time.

The 130-meter-long swimming pool, with shaded trees on both sides, looks like a green and clean road. After swimming in the swimming pool for a while, it is also called going to the sea for a while. The waves hit him, and he was as happy as a child.

After changing and washing, I went to Chayue for dinner. The two-person set menu is still very suitable. It refreshes and cools a lot of fruits and eats it all.

The pleasant time at the observation deck bar is given by the retro jazz brother on the stage. The lazy vinyl record is very intoxicating.

The breakfast is very satisfying, raw porridge, steamed grains, ham, French toast. There are not many choices overall, but they are all fresh and delicious, not some frozen instant food, so I am happy to eat.

The Haiyue Library in the hotel is a treasure. Many architecture-related books are heavy industry books like picture albums. It is easy and rewarding to read.

Light and shadow is also a very characteristic point I see in the hotel, the various reflections and depths formed by water light and light together. The entrance of the restaurant is very typical. The effect of stairs and marble tiles makes you walk into the restaurant as if you are leading to a mysterious underground palace.

The waiters are young, attentive and not intrusive. In fact, I don't think it's really the ceiling, but it's really a hotel I love, and I leave with satisfaction.

Because it was a honeymoon trip, he made arrangements in advance and sent us a honeymoon cake. They were very pleasantly surprised. They told us a lot of precautions before coming here. They were very caring and responsible. They answered them carefully throughout the whole process. They served us until we left the store and even gave us a small gift. In addition to being particularly satisfied with the impeccable service, the hotel is also very satisfying
Knowing that Park Hyatt was created by Belgian designer Jean-Michel Gathy, it is the most artistic hotel I have seen so far. From the entrance, every corner is worth savoring carefully, which is different from the "net celebrity hotel" in Haitang Bay. "Park Hyatt Sunny Bay brings me a greater feeling of a comfortable vacation.
The Yuehai Library is a quiet place to enjoy the sea when you are leisurely. It has a large collection of books for travelers.
Everyone in the library is very quiet. I can‚Äôt bear to break the silence. When you arrive at the hotel, you will pass the most beautiful road in the legend. You will have a feeling of discovering beauty by driving all the way to the hotel.
There is an outdoor swimming pool with a length of 130 meters. Surrounded by green trees, it is not too beautiful. I will swim in the morning and evening. The water quality is clear
There is also the iconic net red underwater lamp outside the lobby, and the scenery in the morning and evening has its own characteristics
Walking in every corridor of the hotel will make people feel artistic
All in all, it was a very satisfying trip! Special thanks also to Monica for adding comfort and thoughtfulness to this honeymoon trip~ Will come again!

msg:This time I came to Sanya alone and stayed in the Edition and Park Hyatt. The two hotels are at the same price. After staying in the Edition, I came to Park Hyatt with one feeling: it is very worthless.
First things first: the scenery is really beautiful, but you need to book an expensive room with a high floor to see it, otherwise you can go to the beach to enjoy it. The meals in the western restaurant are also pretty good.
Then I started to complain: the whole hotel is really old, not only the room facilities are old, but you can see rotten wooden chairs and tablecloths with holes everywhere in the whole hotel. Frizzy napkins. The price of a platinum diamond five-star hotel is so high, I would like to ask where the money is spent?
The staff in the hotel are very unprofessional. When you walk around the hotel every day, you can see the cleaning staff sitting on the deck chairs to rest, and hiding in the swimming pool changing room for a while. After the rest, they go to the beach and take pictures a landscape photo. Twice, the cleaning staff next to the swimming pool quarreled loudly with another staff member, and the staff next to me ignored it. There will always be a bunch of staff by the pool doing nothing, playing on their phones, chatting, and not offering towels. The whole thing felt very unprofessional to me.
The housekeeper didn't know much about the nucleic acid situation. He told me that there was no national nucleic acid result that day. The answer to the housekeeper is only: ah, why is mine not yellow? I really don't know what the policy is. Shouldn't a housekeeper take the initiative to understand these things?
Finally, here comes the important point: the facilities in my room for the first and second nights were too old to look at. When the sliding door of the bathroom was opened, something like mold was found. The bathtub hadn't been cleaned at all and it was full of water stains. On the third day of my stay, the smell of the sewer was getting stronger and stronger. After telling the housekeeper, I asked the staff to check the room and told me that they didn't smell anything. How can I say this? Is there something wrong with my nose? That night I was moved and upgraded to a room, which was appreciated. As a result, after changing the room, I wanted to make some tea. When I opened the teapot, there was still water in it. The water still smelled like tea leaves, and it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned at all. It was the first time I stayed in any hotel and I didn't even dare to use the cups inside.
Summary: I just want to express that a hotel that costs more than 2,000 yuan for the next night has no real value or any special service. Instead, it is the most heart-wrenching experience I have ever stayed in. Hotels under 1,000 will be cleaner and have better service than this one. During the time I was there, the hotel received a lot of groups, and it would be very inconvenient for individual residents because of these groups. For example, the swimming pool was so crowded that there was no way to swim, or the western restaurant was reserved at night and no one notified. There are professional photographers everywhere in the hotel for publicity, but the experience of the guests who really saw your publicity and stayed here is so bad.

msg:A great experience~
Because of the anniversary, I temporarily decided to stay one more night. Facts have proved that Park Hyatt is worth our expectations. The Rosewood in the past few nights was really disappointing.
When I came to Park Hyatt, I regretted not staying for a few more days. Stella was very responsible. After coming to the store, she helped us upgrade the room type. When I selected a full sea view room, the impression was very good once I entered. There were welcome fruits and night room service (dessert and mangosteen were provided as gifts) ), reminded me that happy hours provided two glasses of wine and dessert of the day for free, and also helped us make an appoin**ent for a free travel photo~
The hotel will really get lost without a map. The whole design is really thoughtful, and there are scenery everywhere. For a hotel that opened in 2015, the hotel facilities are a bit outdated, but it does not affect its charm. The details can be seen everywhere, and the sense of design completely
The beach is exclusive to Park Hyatt guests, and the privacy is very high. The beach was very clean this time. Maybe it‚Äôs because there are few people in the epidemic.
The downside may be that the air conditioner is too cold üòÇ It‚Äôs useless to adjust it, and there are too few breakfast items, and there is almost nothing to eat
Before leaving, Stella also presented two small gifts. Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely choose Park Hyatt again. It is a very good experience.

msg:How would you describe the feeling of staying here? It may be appropriate to say that: gold and jade are inside, and the waste is on the beach.

Ever lived in Dadonghai Oriental Mandarin, Shimei Bay Westin, Lingshui Westin, Yalong Bay MGM, but strangely the best Park Hyatt beach is the most messy? I'm helping them figure out why, probably
- Located at the end of the Gulf Stream, some rubbish will float and accumulate on their beaches
- But it doesn't make much sense, there is also a lot of garbage at the top of some beaches
- Could it be that some parts of the beach do not belong to them, and they can only sweep the snow in front of the door?
- Or is it affected by the epidemic and lack of manpower?
- Or is the leader too busy and forgot to patrol the beach?

Looking forward to their improvements...

msg:A very pleasant stay, the experience is better than those of the top luxury Internet celebrities in Haitang Bay under the premise of the same price, which greatly changed my impression of Park Hyatt.
The first is privacy. There are not many rooms, and it occupies a bay. It is a rare hotel in Sanya that does not allow non-residents to enter. There are few children and it is very quiet.
Then the whole hotel is a huge piece of art. It's so beautiful. Such a large modern hotel has the feeling of a Suzhou garden step by step. Every corridor and every piece of art are exquisite and harmonious. The ecological environment is good by the mountains and the sea. I saw a wild owl for the first time. I am not afraid of people at all. It is cute. üòç
The outdoor 130m long swimming pool is also very beautiful. It has a boundless feeling when swimming. The indoor swimming pool is a little bit less interesting. The water temperature of the pool is low, and there is no such thing as a sauna.
When the service is perfect in other aspects, it seems to be a little short... Although the required services can be met, the response is also very fast, and the butler Stella's service is also very considerate. But on the whole, I feel that there are very few service staff. I don‚Äôt know if it is the cause of the epidemic. At night, I can‚Äôt see anyone except the front desk. The overall feeling is not as good as those famous for their service.
Another disadvantage is the beach. Although you can go into the water, it is recommended to clean up the beach. At least throw the big stones out. Swimming feels very easy to hurt.

Due to time constraints, it's a pity that I couldn't experience the hotel's super-long Internet celebrity swimming pool! If you like to experience hotels like me, it is recommended to visit the hotel for a day and experience the various activities arranged by the hotel. It is really very pleasant!

[Traffic] Because it is self-driving, the distance is acceptable. You may encounter people who rent a car and take pictures when passing the Internet celebrity highway. Pay attention to the driving speed.

msg:Park Hyatt is the biggest and only failure of my trip to Sanya
This time, I stayed in four hotels: Grand Hyatt, Atlantis, Capella, and Park Hyatt. It is unfortunate to arrange Park Hyatt at the end of the journey, especially after checking out from Capella, the sense of difference is even more obvious. The overall experience is very poor, reflected in 4 aspects:
1. The luggage pick-up service we reserved before leaving the hotel, but the room staff entered the room directly without knocking on the door without confirming whether there is a guest in the room, which is reckless and lacks basic training.
2. The hotel has repeatedly called the guest‚Äôs personal mobile phone at any time to notify the nucleic acid test and other matters. Depending on the situation, the hotel can fully authorize the housekeeper to remind the guest on WeChat (the housekeeper sam has reminded him). Personally, I feel rude and disrespect the guest.
3. On the afternoon of October 14, 2022, I (female) returned to the guest room from the lobby with coconuts and other large fruits in both hands. During this period, I passed at least 3 male staff and 2 female staff members, and neither of them asked if I needed necessary help. Personal feeling Indifferent and impersonal.
4. At 9:00 on October 15, 2022, I was in a hurry to take a flight to leave Qiong, and called the hotel front desk, hoping to pack 6 croissants and 2 cups of ice American for breakfast, so that I can eat it on the road, and my room rate already includes breakfast, this is my breakfast. The rights and services that should be enjoyed, I personally think it is reasonable, but the hotel refuses to provide it on the grounds that take-out is prohibited. It is understandable that the hotel has its own rules, but the cost of 6 croissants and 2 cups of ice American take-out is more than if I went to the hotel. The cost of on-site dining is much lower (service cost, price cost). Finally, after repeated communication and the help of the housekeeper sam, the breakfast was successfully packed and left. Personally, I felt that the service was rigid and would not be flexible.
To sum up: Park Hyatt's service is not pragmatic, especially when compared with Capella. Capella is expensive because it is worth the money.
Advantages: 1. The croissant is delicious. 2. The housekeeper sam provides thoughtful service

msg:Park Hyatt Sanya Sun Bay Hotel has a very good stay experience.
This time, I went on a trip with my girlfriend and planned to check in various ports in Sanya. The second stop was Sun Bay. First, considering that the development level was relatively low, it was closer to nature. Second, it was specially for Park Hyatt.
I have long heard that Park Hyatt sits on the entire Sun Bay, isolated and independent among the mountains, quiet and peaceful. At night, I was shocked when I looked at the famous winding mountain road in Sun Bay: a pure white building group among the ultramarine greens, decorated with warm-colored light *****s, and opened their arms to welcome guests home.

Location: 4 stars, for those who like quiet, Park Hyatt is the best choice, very quiet. Although the number of passengers during the epidemic was not large, the hotel's natural geographical location, scale and layout can greatly alleviate the pressure of social fear. Even those who like to be loud can find their own fun during the daily happy hour and on the beaches of Sun Bay. The only downside is that it is located in the mountains. It needs to travel a mountain road, and it is indeed a little far from the commercial area. Basically, dining and entertainment can only be digested in the hotel, which is not particularly friendly to car-free people.

Service Experience: 5 stars, special thanks to Sam, Park Hyatt's Guest Experience Manager. I did some homework before the trip and wanted to book the room with the best sea view, so that I could have a panoramic view of Sun Bay; Sam not only provided room type guidance and upgrade services, but also presented hotel souvenirs and red wine designed by himself when he settled in. The hotel layout, circulation and concierge items were also explained patiently. In addition, the overall service experience of the hotel is also in place, which is worthy of praise.

Check-in experience: 4.5 stars, in addition to the famous Sun Bay Highway nearby, the hotel can take pictures of sunset sports cars; the infinity pool has a very high film rate; the hotel has rich works of art and well-designed corridors. Every corner is a rhythm worthy of your clap. There are also a wealth of recreational activities on Sun Bay, which is just outside the door: deep diving, snorkeling, motorboats, water dragons, etc., which are enough to meet the multi-day play plan. The only point of deduction is that the hotel layout is complicated and the buildings are far apart. For Lu Chi‚Äôs friends, you need to contact the housekeeper for advice, but it is an advantage for quiet guests.

I saw on Ctrip that if you stay for two consecutive nights, you can upgrade from a normal sea view room to a supreme sea view room. I originally wanted to book this supreme sea view, but I found that I could upgrade directly. I did not hesitate to choose a normal sea view and then upgrade.
Save 1200üí∞

Check-in time is October 3-5, total 8080 for two nightsüí∞
Including free mini bar for two days & breakfast for two days

When I checked into the hotel, I encountered two boys riding motorcycles in front of me. I told the security guard that they wanted to go in and visit.
The service at the front desk when checking in is relatively routine, and patiently explained the layout of the hotel to us on the map, and the route to the room, restaurant, and beach. Then provided the map to us. I saw someone on the little red book saying that it was like a maze and it was easy to get lost. I felt that it was acceptable after listening to the explanation from the front desk.
No. 3 sunshine is very goodüëç I can't wait to take pictures when I enter the room, the color of the sea is really beautiful
‚ö†Ô∏èRemind everyone to take pictures when the sun is good. The second day we stayed was cloudy... There was no sunshine, and the color of the sea was too gray to take pictures.

üè® When I entered the room, I found that there was no welcome fruit. By the way, I asked the young lady Stella who brought us to the room. She said that she would deliver it later~
(It turned out that there was only one bunch of grapes üçá, which was a bit disappointing. After all, I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya, and the first time I saw this simple welcome fruit was at Park Hyatt)
Stella sent me a message and told me that she was an ambassador for Yuexiang (I don't really know what this title is üòÑ), and again texted me some activities in the hotel, and also helped us make dinner reservations for the day & the art event the next day. Brigade, I will talk about the dining experience and art tour activities in detail later.
During my stay, Stella basically responded to my messages in seconds. Greatüëç
üçΩAs for food, this time I ate the coconut chicken set meal and the Hainan style set meal respectively. Since there is no takeaway near the hotel, it can be delivered in as little as 50 minutes, and all meals will be served in the hotel.

On the evening of the 3rd, I went to eat the coconut chicken set meal for two people üí∞688, we were very hungry... Waited for 40‚ûï minutes... I don't know why it took so long...
The waiter in the restaurant simply apologized. After serving the food, a man explained the food. After seeing the liquor on our table, he asked if we needed to get a small glass for us... We feel the service...
However, I observed that the family who came behind us üë™ served the food in 25 minutes (the same coconut chicken), expressing helplessness...
But it tastes good, and the ingredients are fresh
üç¥Hainan style set meal for two at night on the 4thüí∞588
The dishes are rich and the service is attentive, but what I want to complain about is that the waiter serving us is really really really heavy... Even the whole restaurant is filled with this smell. The service, I asked another waiter to serve us out of politeness... I smelled the waiter's body odor while eating... I have been enduring this meal, and I have no mood to take pictures... Every time he comes. I'll hold my breath when I'm done cooking üëÉüò≠

üñºAbout Art Journey
On the 4th, we gathered in the lobby at 11:00 and took part in the art tour, accompanied by a couple. I have always heard that Park Hyatt has a lot of artworks. It sounds like the name of the art tour should be very eye-opening. However, the explainer did not answer the questions we asked. The problem and can do some expansion, it will make me amazed. The overall feeling is just to arrange a person to take us around the hotel... There is no strong sense of art work experience...

üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Going to the swimming pool in the afternoon, the biggest bug‚ùå appeared in this trip
First of all, the male waiter by the pool is very service-minded. Since I can't swim, they still try to lend me a swimming ringüëç
Later, I changed into my swimsuit and found that there was no head rope to tie my hair. I went back to the service desk by the pool again to ask a waitress if I could borrow a head rope (long hair will fall into the pool if it is not combed, causing blockage, I think it is common sense)
The waitress rejected me directly and replied that I didn't (I could accept that the hotel didn't have it, but she didn't look for it, and she didn't make any effort to reject me directly, making me speechless üòì) I just stood there awkwardly...then she just directly Get back to your work...
At this time, the male waiter came back, and I asked him again... He took one from below and lent it to me... It can only be said that the service awareness of hotel waiters needs to be cultivated, not everyone has enough service awareness.
Since I don't know how to swim, I just took pictures and ate something near the pool, so I won't comment on it. The 130-meter length is really beautiful~ It's also very good~

üç±The hotel breakfast is ordinary, not very amazing, the area is slightly smaller and there are not many varieties. It's not bad until 11:00. The good news for the bedridden ~ the restaurant waiter's service is not bad, and will take away the garbage and dinner plates on the table in time.

üì∑The hotel can make an appoin**ent for free travel photography for 60 minutes, and 5 free intensive repairs. I only chose a few locations that I liked to take pictures, and it was over about 30. The photographer is very good and patient~

üîô When checking out, the front desk asked about the check-in experience and gave a small gift üéÅ Park Hyatt's luggage tag (the texture is average)

üöóAfter checking out and leaving, I received a call from the duty manager Mina, asking about the experience of this trip. I described the problems I encountered, and added my WeChat to say that I would definitely ask the relevant situation to deal with it. And asked my address and wanted to send me a limited edition bearüêª to apologize~

‚ù§Ô∏èIn general, the experience of staying this time is not bad. The interlude in the middle did not affect me too much. Personally, I think that no hotel is 100% perfect. I accept this imperfection and expect a more perfect experience. Next time I will still choose Park Hyatt~
Give five stars üåü

The beach and sea water are also very good, but due to the epidemic, the children's swimming pool and indoor swimming pool are not open, and it is a little difficult to walk in the hotel.
The manager Mina was very enthusiastic and gave the baby a lot of small gifts. He also humbly accepted our suggestions for improvement.
I can only say that for Sanya, I should not choose another home.

msg:If you are looking for a sense of luxury with charts and tables, but not a sense of service-relaxed vacation, then Park Hyatt is the best choice.

In a high-end hotel, the sheets are not clean, the beach is chaotic and there are no service staff, the lounge chairs are sp**** and there are no blankets.

The staff took a charger and urged it twice, but it still took 40 minutes

The wet floor of the spa room almost fell down, but the room manager told me that he changed my room in time at that time, shouldn't this happen? A room of 6k a night, such a service standard?

On the TV in the guest room, it was not my name. After informing the hotel, the name was correct and my gender was changed. It's ridiculous

Later, when I checked out, the duty manager said that I was waiting for me at the front desk (yes, I didn‚Äôt come to the door to apologize), and when I got to the front desk, I was told that she had gone to eat in the area.

Isn't Mandarin Oriental delicious? Or is Capella not advanced?

I won‚Äôt put the above in the accompanying picture, let me show you a more interesting one, it is the only way I have to pass through the restaurant, lobby, etc. in the Japanese area‚Äî‚Äî"The Hanged Tree Behind the Dirty Glass"

msg:The last stop of the trip to Sanya
Graduation trip is purely for vacation. Decided to choose Park Hyatt instead of Atlantis on the last day; I personally think that the two hotels have different positioning: Atlantis is suitable for tourism and entertainment, and Park Hyatt is suitable for leisure and vacation.
It can be said that Park Hyatt has the top design in Sanya, with a strong sense of art; every place in the hotel is worth stopping to watch, and the various works of art in the corridor are dizzying. The hotel rooms are also very high-end and a**ospheric. The design of this cloakroom is very comfortable. It is the best cloakroom in the hotel where Sanya travels. The room we stayed in was relatively economical (after all, we went with classmates...) but its interior/design made me very satisfied (I personally like this kind of Chinese style) with many details, such as afternoon tea, free snacks, The quality, location and placement of fruits, drinks, tea, coffee, etc. can all show the importance Park Hyatt attaches to each guest, and it can also be seen that Park Hyatt attaches great importance to quality and details. It can be said that details determine success or failure.
At that time, the check-in was on July 1st, when the typhoon was passing through, and the wind and rain were mixed. I originally wanted to enjoy the pure private beach on the last day, but it is not beautiful. . . I still went out and took some pictures of the rainy days. The beach on a rainy day and a sunny day can be said to be two completely different landscapes. The beach after the rain has the purity and beauty of the Chaka Salt Lake, and the beach after the rain is the opposite; even so, it cannot stop Park Hyatt's unique geographical advantage from showing its beauty.
üöó Transportation: Located in Sun Bay, it is convenient to drive, but it is more troublesome to take a taxi. . But it is definitely not a loss to come to Park Hyatt.
üßπHygiene: The hygienic conditions are OK, and the rooms are clean and tidy, making people very comfortable.
üîîService: First class! Miss Stella was very enthusiastic. She took us to the guest room and added WeChat to communicate at any time. And whether it is the front desk or the restaurant, the corridor, the hotel staff are very polite, which can better reflect its first-class standard.
In my opinion, Park Hyatt is absolutely suitable for couples on honeymoon, vacation (the kind that don't go to attractions very much), etc.; the unparalleled privacy determined by its unique geographical location is what I like. If you are thinking about playing water sports or something, it is not recommended to stay in Park Hyatt.
Let's talk about Park Hyatt's dining. Due to the weather, there were many flying insects in the tea garden at dinner, and many fell into the dishes. . . It's a bit embarrassing.... Fortunately, the dishes were changed in time and a certain amount of compensation was given. It can be said that the handling was very decent. The food is exquisite and the taste is top notch. Desserts are very delicious (I thought it would be nice to bring back one for my family/girlfriend) I will definitely repurchase next time. The chicken soup of the coconut chicken is delicious, except for the flying insects, I am very satisfied, and I can understand the difficulties of the hotel. This is the first fly in the oin**ent.
The second fly in the oin**ent is that due to the rainstorm, water leaked in some parts of the hotel. . Later, when I was at the airport, the staff specially called to apologize for this. Although I can understand it, I still hope that the hotel can avoid such a phenomenon. It can be said that the hotel's trea**ent is also more appropriate.
This is generally the case. I am very satisfied overall. I will definitely bring my girlfriend/family to the hotel in the future. I am very satisfied with the hotel as a whole. The environment in the store is very good, the lighting is very well arranged, and it is also suitable for taking pictures.

Transportation: It is not very convenient. There is only one two-way two-lane road known as the most beautiful road leading to the hotel. The road is really beautiful, but there is no taxi within 5 kilometers. It is recommended to charter a car and drive by yourself.

Service: Laundry is charged, and there is no washing machine in the private room, but the housekeeper can provide basins and washing powder. On the other hand, the apar**ents in Tang'an, Haitang Bay have washing machines, which is really not satisfactory.

Then, there is nothing wrong with this hotel.

Environment: Not to mention, the above picture, I think the definition of luxury is probably like this, private beaches, quiet coasts, architectural masterpieces by internationally renowned designers, plus the most beautiful road, in contrast, Capella‚Äôs 10,000-dollar suites are only You can see the roof, it can be said to be the most cost-effective luxury hotel in Sanya.

msg:Location: 45 minutes drive from the airport, in the innermost part of the roundabout
Facilities: 1. The 130-meter swimming pool of the Internet celebrity is very good. It is very good that all the swimming pools are constant temperature, and it will not be cold outside at night. 2. The price of water projects is too expensive, which has nothing to do with the price. The charges are a bit unreasonable and have little meaning. 3. The mini bar and coffee machine are standard. 4. The hotel is built in the middle of the mountain. Every place is very long. There is no shuttle bus, so you can only walk by. It is normal to get lost within two days.
Catering: Chinese restaurants and western restaurants have a good environment, the food is not too amazing but not bad. The breakfast is well received, the exquisite taste is also very good, and the coffee is ordinary.
Service: It's quite satisfactory, all the staff who encounter it will not take the initiative to say hello, and many of them are unfamiliar with the business, which seems to be lacking for this brand and the positioning of a resort hotel. The place is very big, and there is basically no one to ask any questions. The place to change clothes in the swimming pool is very far away, and it is not connected. You need to change your swimsuit and go out from the normal area of guests. It is embarrassing. On the contrary, the cleaning aunt inside asked me how to open it, and I said I would not.
Butler: One-to-one butler service, except for being enthusiastic when secretly selling items, the rest of the time will not take the initiative to ask for needs, and you will not be able to see it when you check out.
Summary: The place is good, the vacation is also suitable, and the overall is comfortable because the location environment of this piece is really good, and the design of the hotel itself is also good. Software services have to keep up, and there are fewer staff in the hotel. Although it will be said that it is affected by the epidemic, the price of the summer vacation has not been affected at all. This is something that should be considered and improved. When I left, no one sent me, so I left quietly. Before I left, the computer at the front desk was broken and everyone was waiting. The services of resort hotels in Southeast Asia can really be used for reference, not just the price.

Don't worry about bringing a baby, there are many parent-child activities, the key is not so noisy, the quality of the beach is very good, and the 130-meter infinity pool is very good. Afraid of the sun and an indoor pool. Both my kids love it here. Of course, it is more recommended for couples than parent-children. The hotel facilities are well maintained like a hotel opened for 1-2 years. Be sure to book a sea view room, the scenery is simply a painting. The breakfast was delicious, not tried in other restaurants. It's just that more people check in during the summer vacation and wait until 3:40, and the front desk is a little confusing.

msg:I chose this Park Hyatt Hotel in Sun Bay for the first stop in Hainan. Considering that I had to do two inspections for three days, I basically didn‚Äôt plan to leave the hotel, so I chose to stay for three nights. Overall, it was a good stay.

First of all, the environment of the hotel is really quiet and elegant. Walking inside the hotel, there is a strong sense of art, and I feel that everything has become noble, haha... üòÜ The beach outside the hotel is really private, because people outside can't get in at all. Come, so it is relatively clean, especially the sea water, very clear, swimming in it, you can see a lot of small fish and small crabs around, a bit like snorkeling, very beautiful.

The only downside is the hygiene of the room, which can't stand a closer look. I booked a basic sea view room, which was upgraded. I was assigned a supreme sea view room, but I found a lot of ants when I first moved in the room. After the feedback, my housekeeper Stella was very good and changed it for me At the same time, I was upgraded to a selected sea view room. The sanitary condition of the room I changed to is not bad. The main reason is that the sea view is really invincible. It belongs to the kind without dead ends. It is so beautiful. . As an apology, they sent me a lot of fruit and coconut again, very happy! üòäAnd my butler, Stella, even helped me take pictures inside the hotel on the day I left the store, and also designed the photo action for me. The results were very good, very good butler, I would like to thank her again, sorry, thank you!

To say that there is still a shortage, it is actually the breakfast. This time I stayed for three nights. The daily breakfasts are not many, and they are quite similar. After all, it is a high-end hotel. I feel that the hotel can do more after breakfast. But the ingredients for breakfast are good, and it is very comfortable to eat. This one should also be praised.

In general, this hotel is still recommended, because the environment is really good and elegant. Whether you take pictures or wander in the hotel, you can enjoy it, and the environment is also very quiet. It is suitable for a hotel. Said to be worthy of praise, and recommend it to everyone. üëç

It took half an hour to repair the door in the middle of the night and it still hasn't been fixed. In addition to constantly changing rooms, did not get any compensation. This kind of service attitude is simply arrogant and terrible.
I don't know if Park Hyatt is too confident in itself. The hotel is almost full of college student service personnel who can be employed after two or three days of training. The service is full of unprofessional and perfunctory.
The 3,000-night hotel coincides with the small peak season, but only one swimming pool is open, and the others are idle. The funniest thing is that the so-called welcome fruit is three peaches... that's it.
The hotel is really big, with design, artistic sense, exclusive access to the whole Sunny Bay, everything is beautiful.
But its service does not make people feel respected at all.
Fortunately, I finally met a manager from Henan, who apologized professionally and warmly the next day, which made me feel a little sincerity. Otherwise, it will really be blown up this time...

It is a good place for vacation and is highly recommended. When you stay in the hotel, you will have an unprecedented perspective experience, full of design, the integration of modernity and nature, so it is a good place to take pictures. The maze-like path forces oneself to slow down in this fast-paced life and the word vacation perfectly blends.

msg:This year, we stayed in three hotels in Sanya, Le M√©ridien, Park Hyatt and St. Regis, with Le M√©ridien first, St. Regis second, and Park Hyatt I can't rank it directly. I booked three hotels on June 12, Le Meridien is 1200 per night, St. Regis is 2794 per night in pool room, and Park Hyatt is 2373 per night. As a family outing with two children, Park Hyatt is definitely not the best choice.
In addition to this hotel is very, very high, you can feel the extravagance of this hotel from the entrance hall and various luxury sports cars along the way, and the water on the beach is very clear, I can't think of any other advantages. . . . .
I want to emphasize that this hotel is like a labyrinth. It's not called a maze, it's a labyrinth. After we checked in, we had to go out. As a result, two adults and two children walked for a long time and passed through several doors. It turned out we were back upstairs where we were. . . . Except in the lobby and restaurant, we hardly saw any staff, which directly caused us to ask for directions and no one asked. It was very crashing, and there was a feeling of breaking through the game. . . .
Then the hotel arranged a twin room on the first floor for us. As soon as my husband entered, he quickly closed the floor-to-ceiling windows leading to the outside and lit mosquito coils. As a result, when I woke up the next morning, I found a bug in the bathtub. I don't know what it is, my husband said that the seaside bugs are normal. When I checked out, I showed the photo to the front desk, and the front desk said something, they will arrange to disinfect it completely, and they will not wait until I show the picture to others later. Tell me it's a cockroach, a giant cockroach. . . . . It disgusts me. In such an expensive hotel, the room on the first floor should at least close the doors and windows before checking in. It is also good to have a screen window. I am really drunk.
The next day for breakfast, we and the baby were lucky to see a staff member on the lawn, and after asking the way, we successfully arrived at the restaurant, but the husband was miserable and lost his way again. . . . . Do you feel my speechlessness? If you bring your baby to play, you really don‚Äôt want to stay here. 4 of my friends waited abruptly for 40 minutes to check in, and the receptionist‚Äôs attitude was not good. They also lost their way from the pool to their room at night, seriously Fear. . . You must know that we are in Amy, and the baby can go to the beach and go back to the room by herself. It is very safe and the road is easy to recognize.
When I left the store, I used the bathroom in the lobby. My god, it didn't make me sick to death, it was terribly dirty. . . . . Then the attitude of the staff is lukewarm, in stark contrast to the staff of Le M√©ridien and St. Regis, in those two hotels, almost every staff member who saw the guest either smiled or said hello, good morning, Good afternoon, you can also see the affinity for children from the eyes.
There is a feature of this hotel. I read it on the Internet, and it is true. You can see a lot of people in the restaurant, but there are not many people on the beach. Are all those who come to this hotel on vacation in their rooms? ? It feels like a bit of a net red punch card, and it is definitely not suitable for family outings.
In addition, it is not recommended for those who want to take pictures of the seaside. The beach here is sloped into the sea, and the distance to the shore is very short. Not only the photo effect is greatly reduced, but children can't play in the water, and they will accidentally go to the depths of the water. There are still many underwater reefs, which are very unsafe. The beach suitable for babies is the Coconut Dream Corridor in Sanya or Amy in Shimei Bay.
Amy added my WeChat in advance and contacted me by phone. St. Regis added my WeChat after I checked in. No one added WeChat from Park Hyatt from check-in to departure. It was really cold.
In addition, I would like to praise St. Regis. In a typhoon day, the slippers were directly worn by the baby, and the umbrella was taken directly to the airport. However, when I was in the Park Hyatt, the penultimate toe was cracked, and I couldn‚Äôt wear my own shoes. Wear hotel slippers and discuss with the front desk if you can send me a pair of slippers to wear. The front desk said you can only take cotton disposable slippers. Well, don't argue, just endure the pain, anyway, the next hotel is better than this.
The core of a hotel is definitely not the hardware. No matter how good the bathroom is, how expensive the faucet is, and the so-called design that is blown up again, if people don‚Äôt have temperature, then everything is meaningless.

The feeling is not much different from the one or two thousand Westin, but the hotel's hardware facilities and glass sea are definitely first-class.

Especially the rooms above the 10th floor of the main building can look out over Yalong Bay and Sun Bay. The invincible South China Sea View, which is connected to the mother and mother, will definitely become a must-stay hotel in Hainan after Capella. In addition to the hardware conditions and design intentions, the hotel provides high-quality services, but also takes special care of the personal preferences of the guests. Special thanks go to Mr. Gino He, the deputy manager of Yuedian, for his excellent advice and flexibility during our meal. The response has also become one of our unforgettable memories during this stay. Anyway, I will miss it here.

In the past, when I came to Sanya to choose a hotel, I always disliked Park Hyatt's thin windows and no balcony, and then I realized that I missed something. In every sense, Park Hyatt Sun Bay is a hotel with a threshold of appreciation.

This should be a large hotel in Sanya that can bring the highest private experience. It is also a magnificent art palace. Most of the public space is dedicated to works of art. Combined with indoor and outdoor plants and landscaping, it can be said that the scenery is different and interesting. abundant.

The hotel offers butler service, thanks to my butler, Vivian, for her warm and attentive service during my stay, as well as a lovely parting gift.

I am very fortunate to choose this hotel to relieve the depression accumulated in the past three months.

The housekeeper, Lucky He, added WeChat a day in advance and accompanied her throughout her stay at the hotel. She was warm, thoughtful and attentive. Thank you very much! A special surprise is the spicy radish No. 22 full set of washing and care products configured by the hotel, which smells so good. To mention two points that are not satisfactory, the electric curtain switch is not at the bedside position, and the toothbrush set is too incompatible with the hotel's lofty temperament.

msg:I chose Park Hyatt Sanya under the great efforts of my friends. I heard a lot of labels before I came here, and I was full of praise. So I "overcame" the slightly expensive house price during the May 1st holiday and did not hesitate to choose to try it. On May 1st, the weather in Sanya was not very good. Before my wife and I came, I was a little worried that the scenery was not good. If the hotel did not meet the expected experience, the feeling would not be very good. After 3 days of experience, I can only say, too! Wow! stop! . The label of the hotel is very clear: (1) The private beach is very private. There are not many people. They are all hotel guests. people); (2) a very strong sense of design, literary and low-key luxury. For someone like me who has no artistic cell, I feel a little ashamed that I can't appreciate deeply in such a hotel with "arts at every corner". From the architectural design, to the use of colors, to the seamless integration and harmonious coexistence of the exhibits and the colors, every place is a visual enjoyment. (3) Excellent service and excellent products. Since Sun Bay is basically a Park Hyatt hotel, meals, leisure and entertainment are basically only carried out in the hotel. Butler-style service, caring, warm, and well-arranged welcome cards, little tigers, daily desserts, and a rich selection of free drinks in the mini bar. Although there are not many types of breakfast in the hotel, each product is a boutique. I would like to express my special thanks to Manager Liu for his arrangement. Manager Zhang Hua solved the problem with enthusiasm and felt the enthusiasm and care.
Finally, I want to talk about the scenery of the hotel, which is absolutely unique. Even if it is cloudy, it will not hinder you from seeing the most beautiful sea in Sanya. Sun Bay is worth your many visits, and Park Hyatt is also worth your frequent visits.
Very recommended! ! !

üèùÔ∏è
Under the night, the splendid luminous building complex perches at the end of Sun Bay Road, facing the sea and the mountains, standing silently.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The hotel was designed by Jean-Michel Gathy, the world's most expensive hotel designer, with Chinese red as the main color, and artworks, sculptures and paintings embellished in the exquisite and elegant space. When entering the lobby, the view becomes wider as the ceiling is gradually raised. Behind the floor-to-ceiling windows is the most famous view of Park Hyatt Sun Bay, the light ball floating on the infinity pool.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The six buildings of the hotel are connected by indoor corridors, and "labyrinth, gloomy" has the most complaints about this design. However, depending on the floor plan of the hotel you will come to when you check in, after going back and forth to the room once, as long as the sense of direction is not too bad, you should not get lost. It is limited to the room to the lobby, and exploration of other areas still requires patience.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The sea view of the five high-rise buildings is really good. The wide banner windows bring a movie-like visual enjoyment. The cancellation of the balcony also isolates the outside noise, making the indoor environment more quiet. The black stone bathtub set by the window is spacious enough to make it difficult for people to Refuse to take a bath in it.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

But the building is far away, and every hotel guest who is willing to go out frequently between the room and the beach is a real warrior. If it weren't for the soft sand of the hotel beach and the crystal clear water like glass, I really wouldn't want to leave the room and take the long road. (I asked the hotel staff and was told that there are five elevators going downstairs to the beach but I couldn't find it, so I had to go from the room to the lobby to the swimming pool to the beach :)

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Compared with other aspects of its excellence, Park Hyatt Sun Bay's service may be a weakness, but avoiding the summer vacation and choosing to stay in the off-season may not cause bad problems. After all, it is inevitable that there will be omissions after overcrowding. During my stay, the lady named Zhang Hua at the front desk of Park Hyatt was very thoughtful and impressed. If you miss Sun Bay Park Hyatt because of some bad reviews, it will inevitably be a pity.

msg:It is a hotel worth checking out. I have stayed at Ritz and Mandarin Oriental in Sanya. The design and service of the hotel, as well as the breakfast, are the best. The service is very friendly. Taking advantage of the holidays of June 1st and Dragon Boat Festival, I took the children to play, and I was upgraded to the supreme sea view room for free. The child's Bingdun pier was forgotten at the seat next to the pillar at the front desk. Yes, the child is very happy. The sea view of the room is invincible, but the 6th floor is not high enough, and the line of sight is partially blocked by two big trees, which is a bit regrettable; the room has a good sense of design, and there is a picture in front of the window. It's just that there is no balcony. The original balcony was not facing the sea, so it was upgraded. My husband can only smoke outside, and it's a pity that there is no balcony to blow the sea breeze in a daze. But the hotel's beach, beautiful scenery and design style can completely make up for the small sadness of no balcony. Personally, the most recommended thing is the breakfast and the dinner in the same restaurant, which are exquisite and delicious. The waiters are very friendly and professional, always paying attention to the needs. I tried the smoked salmon for breakfast, and the mackerel was super tender; my husband said ham, Cantonese morning tea is also very good. Yes; there is a kind of bread with butter that is very fresh (comparable to Marriott by the Thames, no other family has eaten such fresh and delicious bread); I only had one meal in a Chinese restaurant for dinner, super recommended, fried East Goat slices with ginger and spring onions It goes well with sliced abalone and rice with silk seedlings. Lunch was in a western restaurant. My baby likes spaghetti bolognese very much. Our adults ordered Matsutake Pizza, and the taste buds absolutely enjoyed it. All in all, Park Hyatt is very happy for three days and two nights. There are few tourists in the off-season. After checking in to the hotel in Sanya that you want to stay in, you will definitely come back to this hotel, even if it is for delicious food. By the way, since I can‚Äôt go abroad after the epidemic, Sanya comes to Sanya two or three times a year, and the restaurants of Park Hyatt and Mandarin Oriental are the most amazing.

msg:This is a luxury hotel that perfectly permeates art into every detail. Its geographical advantage allows you to stay away from the hustle and bustle and feel at ease. Its artistic a**osphere makes you feel like living in a fashionable city.
Not much to say about design and hardware, there are many pictures on the Internet, when you walk into the room, when the lights are on, the curtains automatically rise, the beauty of interior design and the sea will bring you healing power. Not much to say about the intuitive beauty, I think the design of the two mirrors in the room is very good, which directly expands the visual care and uses the sea view to the extreme.
The service of the hotel team will make you feel the strong influence of the brand, which comes from the efforts of every staff member.
Sanya brings together major international brand hotels. I chose four hotels during this trip, and staying at Park Hyatt is undoubtedly the most satisfying choice for this trip.
One day before check-in, a staff member took the initiative to contact me to ask about the time of entering the store, personal needs, etc. VivianSun from the guest service added WeChat to keep in touch from the time of entering the store to the time of leaving the store, and was very patient. On the day of check-in, Zhang Hua at the front desk gave a warm reception, arranged the most suitable room, went through the check-in procedure quickly, gave away a hotel hotel and a toiletry kit, added WeChat, kept in touch, and paid attention to your accommodation needs, very thoughtful. When you enter the lobby, if there is a stopover, the staff will bring drinks, which is very thoughtful.
I stayed for two days and ate at the Chinese restaurant throughout the whole process. The quality of the buffet and ordering was very good, and I could see the skill of the chef team. The restaurant waiter, Ju Jiahao, is familiar with the dishes and will patiently help you choose meals that suit your taste. The service is very considerate. The waiter Zhong Hailong always has a smile on his mouth, which makes people very comfortable. The overall level of the restaurant's service team is good, and the waiters will carefully observe your needs at any time and respond as soon as possible. One day, the photographer and I were sitting at the empty table outside the western restaurant and talking. As soon as we sat down, the staff in the western restaurant brought two glasses of water, and the service was always by our side.
The cleaning team in the room is also very attentive. A cleaning staff surnamed Geng always smiles every time he comes over and responds to requests. When I went out in the morning, I hung up Do Not Disturb, and when I came back, I saw a reminder card on the door to remind me to clean. Going back to the room at four or five o'clock will find that the night bed is always made.
The passage leading to the swimming pool is very beautiful. Every day I walk by, I see a master working hard to salvage the fallen leaves floating on the water.
The staff at the swimming pool are also very patient. Knowing that I can't swim, they will keep a distance of one or two meters away and explain the essentials patiently when I play paddleboard, which will make me feel more secure.
The smiling service from Lawrence Liu and Agnes Xu before leaving the store is also very comfortable. The driver's car service is also very polite and courteous.
The road in front of the hotel is the most beautiful road in Sanya, and those who like to run should not miss it.

He contacted us before check-in, helped us check in early, and warmly informed the location of the nucleic acid testing agency. We are on a honeymoon trip, and the hotel specially upgraded the sea view room for us, with a very good view, and helped us arrange the honeymoon room, which is warm and romantic. The hotel's facilities are well maintained, and it has exclusive access to the Sun Bay Beach. The seawater quality is very good, it is convenient to go to the sea, and the length of the infinity pool is very acceptable. Before leaving, Sam also gave an exquisite gift. Next time I will choose Park Hyatt Sun Bay.

The service of the hotel is really first-class. I was very unhappy on the road. After arriving at the hotel, the front desk Zhang Hua and Manager Liu responded immediately after learning about it, so that their restless emotions were very calm. The hotel facilities and swimming pool are really beautiful, the service staff are very professional, and the western restaurant The product is very good, I am amazed üëç It is suitable for family and friends to come together!

msg:I was a little worried before going, but the overall experience is still very good. The hotel is designed according to our liking, and we will not feel lost. Instead, we feel that various corridors, paintings and sculptures are quite interesting.
The housekeeper Lucy Zhang Luyue is very caring and can answer all kinds of questions quickly.
Except for the waiter who was very impatient when he was waiting for the room at the observation deck before check-in on the first day, the overall service was still online, and the service in the three restaurants felt that the tea garden was the best.
Many parts of the hotel are beautiful and suitable for taking pictures.
In terms of eating, I feel that if we go before 9:30 for breakfast, there is basically no need to queue. After 10:00, it is hard to say. We go earlier every day. The western food is average, there is no special image, the Chinese food tastes good, and the hot pot in the evening is also worth a try.
Finally, I complained about the reservation depar**ent. Because of the temporary extension of one night, the reservation depar**ent only reported the pre-tax price, and did not remind us that there were service charges and taxes. In the end, we were unwilling to let us listen to the phone recording to verify, our own work mistakes made the customer bear.

msg:The service is terrible. There is not even the most basic welcome at the door. The hotel entrance looks dead. There are only two or three people at the front desk of such a big hotel. In addition to adding a waiter's WeChat to ask if there is anything, Others have no service to speak of. As a hotel near the sea, the environment is also average. It is said that there is a beach, but the beach is full of coral stones, and it is impossible to swim in the sea. The hotel facilities look old, especially the hair dryer in the room does not match the price at all. The decoration of the hotel is not good, it is relatively old, the skin on the wall is molted, and the skin is peeled off due to moisture. The most amazing thing is that I walked more than 10,000 steps without leaving the hotel. Staying in a hotel is like walking through a maze. There are 2-3 elevators to go from the lobby to the room. Is the design flawed? After eating breakfast, I was already digested and hungry when I walked to the room. Breakfast is generally not in line with this price. Generally speaking, the price of this hotel is much inflated. It‚Äôs okay to take pictures with those internet celebrities, but it‚Äôs not recommended to stay by yourself! ! !

msg:first evaluation. I like to say one thing, straight male comments. Let's talk about it first:

I am still very satisfied with the hotel environment. It is a hotel that has really left the hustle and bustle of the city since I came to Sanya so many times. It is very suitable for people who want to stay in a quiet and comfortable place without any noise. The hotel is also very artistic, you can feel it when you walk around the hotel. The hotel is in Sun Bay and is the only hotel in Sun Bay. Because the waves of Sun Bay are not very big, you can swim in the sea! This is also a plus point.

shortcoming:

Service: I don't think the service is up to Park Hyatt's brand standards. First of all, when I checked in, the small plates and dishes and cutlery in the drawers of the room were all uneven and unclean. I reported this problem to the hotel in a timely manner, but no one dealt with it for me. It was not until the second day of my stay that the matter was really solved, and the dishes and cutlery were cleaned up for me. For this matter alone, I went to the hotel three times, and it didn't give me any peace of mind. In order to make up for this mistake, the hotel manager wanted to do something for me, and I made it clear that I didn't need anything, but in the end she forced a bottle of red wine into my room. My take on this is that if the customer makes it clear that he doesn't need any compensation, the hotel doesn't need to do anything. But if the hotel insists on giving customers some benefits to express its apology, it must express its sincerity, especially on behalf of the Park Hyatt brand. I also have a standard for red wine, and I won't drink it indiscriminately. In the end, I didn't touch the wine provided by the hotel, and only drank the red wine I ordered on the wine list. Service standards need to be improved, but also need to be generous.

Location: Because of the privacy, there will be no restaurants or takeaways around. This means that it is difficult to get a car. Suitable for self-driving travelers. It depends on whether you want to be lively and convenient or quiet when you travel.

All in all, this hotel still left a deep impression on me. I still like the design style and a**osphere inside, but the service really needs to be improved.

Hope it helps other travelers to make travel decisions.

One last tip: Not every unit has a balcony. If you want to sit outside and enjoy the sea breeze, you must book a unit with a balcony. I still recommend it!

msg:The most anticipated and previous favorite hotel, this time a big rolloverüí£

1. The attitude of the front desk staff is very poor, and the work efficiency is extremely low. If you ask three questions, everyone should be on duty without training.
2. The staff of the concierge department privately introduced the non-hotel sea amusement facilities to the guests, which was unprofessional.
3. Room service, it takes a lifetime to receive food slowly, the food is unpalatable, and the phone can't get through.
4. The facilities in the room are aging, and the curtains often have problems.
5. The breakfast was unpalatable, and the waiter didn't have enough time to take a teacup for a meal.

After encountering a problem, the manager in charge of the front desk of the hotel seemed very ****y to solve the problem. He pulled out the deputy manager and supervisor of the concierge department and the catering department as a shield for himself. The response he got was basically "suffering." Feeling a little powerless.

In any case, Park Hyatt should not be like this, nor should it be paid for by calling a car for afternoon tea without a meal delivery fee. Such poor service does not match the original design and atmosphere of the hotel. It can also be said that the service alone has dragged down the aura that belonged to Park Hyatt. So disappointing!

It's a pity that the feelings have been wiped out by the service.

For four days and three nights, I basically don't want to leave the hotel. The hotel has its own beach, a children's playground, and a children's swimming pool, which can basically meet my needs. From checking in, my housekeeper Molly was very thoughtful and considerate, and the hotel also prepared a small gift when I left. I am traveling with a small baby, and the baby supplies are well prepared. Babies are skinny and often mess up the room, make room calls, and tidy up the room in time.

msg:I stayed at Park Hyatt on the day of Xiaonian, and the overall feeling was very good. During the Chinese New Year, the room was slow to clean up, so there were some problems with check-in upon arrival, but the front desk and the manager had a very good attitude and actively cooperated to solve the problem. Yuexiang Ambassador Jessica Tang Wenjia introduced the hotel's facilities carefully, and also helped to book dinner in Yuexiang. Another staff member, Sam, took the initiative to help us check out directly when checking out, avoiding waiting at the front desk, which is very considerate~~

msg:When I chose a hotel before, I saw Park Hyatt‚Äôs comments on everything, and there were many bad ones. In fact, the experience was very good when I checked in. The main reasons are: First, the service is really meticulous and considerate. Second, the overall environment is very good, the taste is very online, and the holiday feeling is full. His sense of vacation is different from the serious Chinese style of Capella with the romantic island style. Park Hyatt's overall pursuit of artistic sense, partial Chinese style and partial a**osphere is very harmonious and unified.
Regarding service: I would like to praise Daniel Zheng Zirui, the housekeeper, and see that we loved eating his snacks when we checked in, and immediately sent a large plate to the room; I was photographing his accessories (Le labo, a brand with the perfume I used) , I sent a set of my name üòå before I left, and the invoice check-out is all about taking the initiative to ask instead of waiting for us to make a request. The same is true for other times. On the first day during the breakfast rush hour, there were so many guests. We asked for a glass of warm water to take medicine and we were remembered by the restaurant brother. The next day we were asked about taking medicine as soon as we sat down. Massage soup. As soon as we entered the pool, someone brought fruit cups; the little brother in the 130-meter infinity pool has been tirelessly taking pictures and videos for us, and successfully recorded the moment of capsizing.
I originally thought that his home was not suitable for parenting, so I went to Yuequ Camp and saw the childcare service and thought it was also good [Âë≤Áâô].
The winter in Sanya will be colder in the past year or two. The heated swimming pool and bathing pool of Park Hyatt House are recommended. The bathing pool is even equipped with gauze curtains, which is very suitable for guests who pursue privacy (in fact, there are very few people in the indoor swimming pool) .
Regarding the environment: There are very few people in his family, so there is a strong sense of vacation. It's quiet everywhere, there is no hustle and bustle, and there are not too many internet celebrities. All the space environments are particularly tall, empty, and full of large-scale artworks. It feels a little solemn at night. It feels particularly good when there is light during the day. The 130-meter infinity pool is super beautiful. When the weather is good, you can play the crystal boat and SUP, which is very popular.

He led us to the room to introduce the hotel's facilities. Knowing that this time we were celebrating the anniversary, he also specially served delicious cakes and wines, which made me the most happy. The happiest thing is that I received a warm handwritten card and le labo accessories with a surname printed on it. This time I was 22, and I was 33 in Suzhou Park Hyatt before~ This girl is so cute ‚ù§Ô∏è All the arrangements for this trip made me feel more about Park Hyatt. Added a deep love

Park Hyatt Sun Bay is different from other Internet celebrity hotels. It has a unique and calm style. Every corner of the hotel, the use of light and shadow has a great sense of design. The most important thing is that it also has privacy, which is too important for a resort hotel. .
By the way, Park Hyatt Sanya also has a lot of photo check-in spots. I highly recommend everyone to unlock and experience this artistic hotel~
üöó Transportation: It is recommended that you drive here and feel the most beautiful road in Sun Bay

The Park Hyatt Hotel is so popular that there are five free photographers to take pictures for you, and the customers who come here send them to Moments, so Xiaohongshu has advertised for free! In fact, I was very disappointed when I came! The sea is not big either! If you walk halfway through one point, you will not be allowed to leave! The photos are all clear and the sea is not so beautiful on the first day to disappoin**ent! Don't mislead everyone... It's not worth it to raise three or four thousand for summer vacation!

msg:From Beijing Park Hyatt to Shenzhen Park Hyatt, and then to Sanya Park Hyatt. Park Hyatt has never let me down.
New Year's Eve at Park Hyatt Sanya is lively but not noisy, which is in line with Park Hyatt's consistent style. Like me, who is afraid that the hotel is full of children jumping and screaming and screaming, it is right to choose Park Hyatt.
Joy Xiang Ambassador Jerry Zhou Jingrui is warm and thoughtful, very considerate but not too disturbing, the service scale is just right, and he takes good care of the elderly.
The hotel has a first-class environment, and you can easily make a blockbuster. I'm writing a review on my spare phone, I don't have any photos for you to look at. The view of this room type I booked is invincible. The elderly are very satisfied.
The buffet for breakfast and dinner in Yue Hall almost covers Hainan's specialties, so you can rest assured of Park Hyatt's quality control. The Baoluo powder, the eastern goat, the suckling pig, the spare ribs, the lobster, the roast goose, and the fish maw soup were very impressive. The breakfast also realized the freedom of strawberries and blueberries, which won my heart.
The taste of the catering and the service of the staff personally think that the Yue Hall is better than the Tea Garden. However, the three-course tea in the tea garden is still good.

If I must mention one point that is not a disadvantage, it is that the hotel is too easy to get lost. It took two days to figure out the route. Lu Chi is not friendly. Fortunately, the staff will be enthusiastic and patient to guide the way.

Compared with other high-scoring hotels in Sanya, I dare to say that Park Hyatt Sun Bay is the best choice for vacation in Sanya.

msg:1. The room was not ready at 15:30 when we checked in, and the room we booked still needs 1 hour of cleaning time. There was no explanation or apology from the front desk. Finally arranged for us a room on the ground floor
2. The service is indifferent with no warmth and emotion at all. Almost no one pays attention to you in all links from the restaurant to the front hall
3. The trees in the hotel don‚Äôt seem to have been taken care of. The trees next to the swimming pool are supported by iron bars. It seems that the water in the swimming pool seeps into the roots of the trees and slowly rots the roots. The bark It all looks unhealthy. The surrounding plants also don't look well taken care of
4. The facilities are not well maintained. Although the hotel was only built in 2015, it already feels very old
5. My boyfriend woke up to find the beach was full of plastic waste

The overall experience is very bad, we stayed here twice this time, and the experience was not good both times. During our stay, we were not taken seriously at all, and we didn't feel any service at all. The swimming pool is beautiful, the beach location is good (but it is very noisy because a third-party amu*****t company is outsourced), and there is nothing else for us to remember.

The overall feeling is that no one is taking good care of and managing this hotel. It feels like it is supporting the fire in Sanya, charging high prices, and purely making money. Compared with the price we stayed at the Capella Hotel, although the price is high, the experience is better than here and it is worth it!

msg:The second stop of this Spring Festival self-driving trip to Sanya was changed from Capella to Park Hyatt. The deepest impression is that Park Hyatt's sea view location is unparalleled. This hotel must book a sea view room. It was raining when I checked in on the first afternoon. I can't help but feel disappointed. The sea view is quite beautiful after the sky clears up the next morning. I regret not booking an extra night. I was worried that the Park Hyatt will be outdated after a long time.
Small suggestion: The large canvas bag in the room should be given to guests like Capella instead of charging 100.
I like the tasteful hotel very much, and I will choose to stay in the future.

There is only a set menu of 1288 per person. We are 3 people with about 4,000 yuan, each with a glass of red wine, and then the funny child didn't have any drinks. I spent money to buy a bottle of "specialty drink", which is boiled milk with coconut milk. It cost more than 200 yuan. By the way, it was the coconut tree brand coconut milk in the supermarket. I can only sigh that there are too many rich people. The price is still the worst room in the hotelüôÅüôÅüôÅ, the only thing that can be linked to the price is probably the hotel's private beach.

Our housekeeper, Lucy, welcomes red wine and desserts. Dinner positioning. Room cleaning. Photo recommendation. Everything is arranged properly. Really happy trip. If I have to say some shortcomings, the location is relatively remote, and it is more convenient to drive out by car. If you take your baby to eat at the hotel every day, it will be a bit expensive and a bit monotonous. I hope the restaurant will introduce more affordable packages. That way you can stay longer next time.

Then the hotel's cooperative travel photographer, Chen Fei, has good photography skills and is cordial and easy-going, making your trip to Sanya Park Hyatt more perfect and the icing on the cake!
Hotel advantages: The hotel has 3 Chinese and Western restaurants, both Chinese and Western food.
There are cuisines that allow you to experience the different flavors of each country. Park Hyatt Hotel is relatively close to Yalong Bay. Although it has to go through a mountain road, it is very beautiful. The location is secret, so no outsiders come in, basically all hotel guests, and the privacy is good.
Hotel advantages:
The water quality of Sun Bay is very good, and the sand of the hotel beach is white and fine. I stayed in the supreme sea view room. The landscape window is really beautiful. As soon as you enter the bedroom, you can see the sea. Whether you wake up in the morning and open the curtains or lean on the sofa to drink coffee during the day, the sea is right in front of your eyes. How can I describe my love, super comfortable. The Chinese food here is really good, I still want to eat it. The breakfast is rich in variety, parking is convenient, and the overall service is great, especially warm.

It turns out that the end of Sun Bay is the Park Hyatt Hotel, and it also enjoys the most beautiful highway of Internet celebrities (the hotel is only a 20-minute walk away). Arrive at the check-in point on the most beautiful Internet celebrity highway, where you can enjoy colorful sports cars and handsome men and women posing for photos), the unique environment is secret and quiet, and it is a good place to spend a vacation away from the hustle and bustle. Slowly appreciate the art in the hotel. Park Hyatt is simply An art exhibition hall, any corner will make you stop and appreciate your slow taste. Sometimes your eyes are so amazing that you really want to take it home ü§≠Every piece of art has a living soul, and every corner is comfortable and soft. You can sit or lie down, you will be completely relaxed. It is really a private residence of bay art. I stayed for two nights and shuttled through the corridors on the 2nd and 5th floors and the lobby like a labyrinth every day. During the stay, I am very grateful to Stella (Zhao Zijun) for his warm and considerate service, which made me feel at home. The waiters in the restaurant were very kind and attentive, and the other service staff were warm and courteous. This experience made my journey happy and perfect. Thanks! Two days passed very quickly. Many things in the hotel have not come to appreciate carefully. Wait for next timeüôèüòÉ

msg:Two years later, I stayed at Park Hyatt again and felt that the hotel was well maintained. The minibar was completely free, and the breakfast was very rich, but there were a lot of people. Originally, I was going to check in Capella this time. The price of temporary reservations in Capella has increased across the board and only suites start at 7,000... And to be honest, looking at the photos, Capella's "Moving Easy Scenery" is a bit difficult to get, really It is to collect seven Dragon Balls to summon Shenlong and prepare to check in. After all, the sea water color of the bay over there and the white sandy beach of Sun Bay are incomparable... In contrast, I think Park Hyatt's panoramic sea view room is very cost-effective, plus I have stayed in the Edison before, but I am satisfied but not as amazing as Park Hyatt, so I decided to stay in Park Hyatt again. After a careful experience this time, I feel that Park Hyatt is not only really good at the design of the hotel, which makes people feel unsatisfied after visiting it twice, but also in the details. Everything you need is available in the room, and there are many types of bags, which are easy to use. And the service is considerate and low-key, unlike Addison who has been calling you and asking you what you need without substantive representation... Here I have to mention Lucy, the housekeeper, who is very kind and attentive, because he paid to upgrade the room, Lucy sent it Ordered red wine coconut and handwritten cards and children's items. Park Hyatt's children's toiletry set is also the most complete. The downside is that children's slippers and bathrobes are too small for seven or eight-year-old babies, but fortunately, the housekeeper has changed to the smallest size for ladies. There are too many people for breakfast, but the quality of the products is good. The restaurant landscape has no features. The rooms with the first-line sea view in the overall design have no windows, which is rare in a resort hotel after all. But at the moment of stepping in, the bamboo curtains automatically rise slowly and the full 270-degree sea view is displayed in front of the eyes, which is still very ceremonial. The room is very comfortable, the hotel is very interesting, the beach scenery is beautiful, and the service is in place. After this stay, my husband said that he will come later Sanya don't bother, just live in Park Hyatt...

The hotel is located in the Yalong Bay National Scenic Area. Before entering the hotel, there will be a coastal road, backed by the mountains and the coast, slowly driving in, overlooking the entire Yalong Bay seascape, many people will park their cars on the side of the road to take pictures
The overall design style is like an art museum, bypassing the lobby is a water lamp and art works scattered in various areas of the hotel, which add a lot of artistic a**osphere here
What I like the most is its private beach, the sand is fine and soft, and very clean at the same time, the sporadic tourists on the beach make me feel a little bit of the illusion haha

üîîService: Specially named Lucy Zhang Luyue butler for providing us with a beautiful sea view room and also prepared red wine as a surprise üç∑ When leaving, a small gift was given. The whole stay experience can feel the attentiveness of the butler service

Hope to come soon next holiday, can't wait to stay again

Room: The Supreme Ocean View Room was set at that time. It is on the 15th floor of Building 2, with a great view. According to the reviews, Building 5 is better. You can see the blue sky, white clouds and the sea every day in the room. I love Park Hyatt. The room design details are very good, the bathtub is oversized, you can take a bath while watching the sea view.
Beach: When I was doing my homework, I said that Park Hyatt was the best beach in Sanya. When I came to MO, I found that Park Hyatt‚Äôs beach was really great. After eating, I went to the beach chair to lie down and listen to the tide. The sea breeze was blowing on his face, and I felt sublimated.
Service: The service is very good. I especially praise the Ambassador of Yuexiang Jason. Every day, I will ask you how you live and whether you need any services. Also helped to apply for late check-out. Warm, generous and meticulous, it is a very comfortable service.
Breakfast: I think it's okay, there are not many categories, the product is ok. Chinese food is better than western food.
Transportation: It's really far away, there is nothing to eat nearby, only hotel or takeaway, takeaway to the entrance of the lobby, the hotel is slightly around, the first night to find the lobby to find curse.
Overall, Park Hyatt is great. Will go again! ü•∞

  The environment, the location of the hotel is secret, and the exclusive beach allows you to enjoy a unique leisure time without the hustle and bustle of the crowd. Moreover, the Sun Bay Highway that enters the hotel is also an excellent place to take photos, don't miss it.
  The service is in place, decent and thorough, especially Daniel and a girl with a round face and glasses in the breakfast room are very satisfied.
  The rooms are very good in all aspects. I stayed in a big bed room with sea view balcony. It is recommended that a friend with rice in the bag choose a big bed room with a 270-degree panoramic view. (In addition, the sound of the smart toilet in the room is a little louder, making it easy to noisy people in the middle of the night).
  The decoration, hotel design and decoration reveal the designer's ingenuity and ingenuity everywhere, and you can take beautiful photos everywhere, depending on your photo level üòÇ
  In addition, the hotel has a standard swimming pool in the city, an outdoor leisure pool (the hotel provides many shooting props), and a parent-child pool to meet the needs of all parties. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is also very rich, and from time to time I will recommend special meals of the day, which is great.

The first way to go was beautiful (but it was a shame that it was cloudy and rainy in the past few days we went)
All staff on arrival at the hotel are friendly and polite. Then from the lobby, the hotel is beautiful, and every detail is designed. The hotel is very large, there is some distance from the lobby to the room to the swimming pool hotel and the road is more complicated. But it doesn't feel far away at all. All the corridors on the road are beautiful and designed, and the guidelines are very well in place and will not get lost. I think it‚Äôs too messy, but I think it‚Äôs really good and I like to stroll around in the hotel. Look around the artwork.
The room we live in is a king-size bed with sea view, and entering the room is like unfolding a picture! The rooms are also well designed, super beautiful, and all the facilities are very good! (The toilet is the one-piece toilet of toto. This is a surprise because the other hotels in this trip are ordinary toilets.) The service is also super good, what is needed, the waiter came very quickly! The bathtub is oversized!
The public facilities of the hotel are also super good, and the outdoor swimming pool is super beautiful and super movie. Another good place is the beach‚û°Ô∏èoutdoor swimming pool‚û°Ô∏èindoor swimming pool‚û°Ô∏èbubble pool‚û°Ô∏èThe changing rooms are all very close to each other on the same route, which is very convenient!
Breakfast is really like what many friends said, there are fewer categories...but, the point is that everything is very delicious! There is no thunder, there are not many things of that kind but nothing to eat. His breakfast is super appetite.
Many netizens will compare his home with Capella Lebi. I didn‚Äôt go there. I can try it next time. This time I live in other places like Addison and Westin. To be honest, I feel that they are also very good, but there are no surprises. . Sun Bay Park Hyatt is so pleasantly surprised!

In terms of service, I saw the comments that everyone posted before saying that there is no butler service, it is not! I even think that the butler of a Pegler, which is characterized by butlers, is super general and can be said to be useless. This time, when we first checked in, little brother Jerry helped us introduce the map of the hotel and the opening hours of various restaurants. Super sweet! Thank u! I also gave me a little bear (I wanted it when I saw someone else had it before I came, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to appear as soon as I checked in. Hahahaha, so happy!)
-Location and environment
The most beautiful Sun Bay Highway, at the end is Park Hyatt, which is really a bay with mountains and the sea. The sea is a glass sea, so blue, so blue, and the hotel has circled an area where you can go to the sea, and if you have few people, you can go to the hotel and go to the sea~
The hotel environment can be said to be like a garden and a museum with many artworks, and the introduction of the artworks on the mini map is really moving.
-Hotel facilities 
Compared with various hotels in Haitang Bay, the hotel is relatively old, and the facilities can be maintained in this way and it is already very good. The only problem is that the bath water is not at a constant temperature, which affects the experience. And the room type is really good, with the supreme sea view and a 270-degree view of the sea.

Hotel casual shots are indeed works of art. After all, it's almost all made by jean. There are many ways to design the match against the hotel. Because the indoor corridor links all the 6 buildings, I often get lost. But rest assured as long as you ask. The hotel staff will send you back, and the bathroom supplies are also lelabo
Of course walking in the Park Hyatt is like a museum. Anything you want can be a blockbuster

msg:On November, a five-night itinerary was arranged, of which the last two nights were arranged at Park Hyatt. One: Because the villa has its own swimming pool on the mountain, the water temperature is colder than the sun At one time I thought it was because of my eye problems and the whole design was depressed. Staying in the room was a little depressed. Two: On the first day of check-in, I went to the bathroom and saw the filth on the toilet immediately reduced points and the tentacles on the glass door Why don't you wipe off the blemishes that are within reach? Just wipe it off. Three this room type can only be considered a mountain view, not a sea view! ! It‚Äôs too far away from the first-line sea view where I stayed in other homes before

The sharp lines complement the soft bay.
In the library area of Dazan Hotel, unfortunately there are fewer books on display, which is suitable for punching in.
But if you bring your own books, you might as well settle down, sit by the window and read for an afternoon, order a cup of afternoon tea, and forget about the daily trivial matters. It's not beautiful! It's just better to avoid the summer vacation.

If you want to take pictures and stay with a couple for a night or two, it‚Äôs a good choice

msg:Very good hotel, the beach is clean and the sand is fine, it should be the best beach in Sanya! The breakfast in the hotel is average, but it basically meets the needs! The Chinese food in the hotel is good, much better than Jia x Le! The hotel is suitable for couples holiday ‚õ±Ô∏è There are few facilities for children! But you can go out to catch fish and crabs after low tide on the beach! Next time you can stay in this hotel directly! Really like

msg:Sun Bay Park Hyatt is definitely a good place for vacation üëç 270 degrees ocean view room, open the curtains in the morning to open the sea view, the soft sandy beach is very quiet, step on the waves in the morning and evening to relax ~ afternoon fitness swimming and visiting the library, a day is very fulfilling. The buffet breakfast, western dinner, and tea garden hot pot are all delicious. Every corner of the hotel is like an art exhibition, and the scenery reflected on every window is a picture of changing scenery. A wonderful Sanya experience. 4 days are too short. I will choose to stay next time!

msg:The environment facilities can be full, the environment can also be a little additional points. But the health and service is 80 points. The whole hotel has a tidal taste. I came from the Intercontinental Peninsula in the mountains. The butler there added a WeChat one day in advance to ask me for my needs. The service is warm and the room is clean and bright. The drink sent can be drunk at 10:30. Here, the Bai Yue is dark and cold like a maze, don't say the housekeeper, out of the front desk basically no one answer, the observation deck at 7:30 no drinks. After 7 o'clock at night, the road has been long, except for the restaurant not even half the waiter saw. Pass a few good-looking hotel pictures to see, want to net red photos, want to experience the quality of the sun vacation service even.

msg:Share the experience of staying at the glamorous and utterly pseudo-five-star hotel Park Hyatt Sanya Sunny Bay:
The Park Hyatt Hotel was designed and built by a famous designer, and it is indeed remarkable in terms of the hotel's architectural design and artistic presentation. But as one of the top five hotels in Sanya for room rates per night, consumers are not only paying for your design, but also hotel services, hotel facilities, meals and so on. Let me talk about my staying experience in these aspects.
Very poor internal communication and non-existent sense of service:
I arrived at the hotel at 12:30 noon on the check-in day and was told that due to the hotel‚Äôs network system failure, I could not check in temporarily and I needed to wait. What can usually be done in 5 minutes, my partner and I waited in the hotel lobby for 30 minutes to get the room card. During the waiting process, no hotel staff came to apologize to you, as if your long wait should be the same. Well, this kind of accidental event of hardware problems is inevitable and understandable.
Entering the room expectantly, guess what you saw? I saw someone in the room was fixing the leaking air conditioner! ! excuse me?? After waiting for a long 30 minutes, a star hotel will arrange for you a room whose air conditioner is leaking. I instantly felt that I was staying in a fake Park Hyatt.
I went to the front desk without any explanation to reflect the situation. Undoubtedly, they agreed to change the room. At the same time, I asked them to send the luggage in the leaky room to the new room. They also said it was okay. Because I was hungry, I took my new house card and went directly to the western restaurant-Qinyuan for lunch (I will talk about the restaurant later).
After the meal is over an hour later, enter the changed room. Guess what you saw again? I saw the lush coconut trees outside the window and a little sea view in the distance. Seriously Park Hyatt? I booked the Supreme Ocean View Room, so that only one line of the sea is also called the Ocean View Room? In the case of arranging a leaky room for the first time, you should no longer reduce the guest‚Äôs check-in experience. The first room has a sea view but leaks. This room is leak-proof but has no sea view. More than that, one hour later, the luggage in the leaky room has not been delivered to the new room. No luggage, no change of clothes, no sun protection, which means you have to wait in the room.
For the second time, I came to the front desk for another room change and the baggage that had not arrived. After expressing my dissatisfaction, the front desk apologized and exchanged rooms again. I have no choice but to accept their arrangements for a room change. This time is the most exciting part of the room change experience. Enter the room to be changed again, guess what? The gorgeous is another room with a leaky air conditioner, and a used carpet is randomly placed under the leak. Park Hyatt, are you like this? The customer just followed you to change the room, wasting the consumer‚Äôs vacation time and visiting your leaky room? ? All of the above.
Finally, the room change ends with an upgrade of the room type.
Outdated facilities:
Air-conditioning leaks are not only in hotel rooms, but also in boutiques and western restaurants in the hotel-Qinyuan. In another restaurant in the hotel, Yue Ting, the shading equipment of the outdoor dining venue has also been broken for a long time. When dining in the morning, guests can only dine in the sun. Why be outdoors? Because many people have to line up for breakfast in Yue Ting, go outdoors without queuing.
There are no sunshades on the beach, and there is no standard place to provide towels and meal services. Lifeguards provide towels part-time. When ordering, you can see if there is a waiter passing by. Some are recliners without arc adjus**ent. You need to maintain a posture for a few hours. .
The dining chairs and tables in the Western Restaurant and Yue Hall can make you feel the feeling of the food stalls in the seaside city, because the touch and look and feel of the cheap and inferior plastic, iron, and woven products make you immersed in the seaside in minutes. Stalls instead of a star hotel.
Where is the sense of service:
Western restaurant: It seems that the restaurant service staff can only order, serve and pay for the three things. The rest of the time, they stand in a daze. You need to ask the waiter for water, and you need to ask the waiter for napkins. The red wine ordered is warm. We need to ask for the red wine to be chilled. Isn't this common sense in western restaurants? ?
Chayuan: Same as the western restaurant, you need to ask the waiter for everything. More humorously, the waiter took away the dinner plate and cutlery halfway through the meal, thinking that it was necessary to change the cutlery and dinner plate. After taking it away, there was no new cutlery and dinner plate for 5 minutes, and asked the waiter why, the waiter said I would go I paid for other customers.
The level of meals is comparable to cheap western food:
Breakfast: The choice of meals is pitiful compared to hotels of the same price. The breakfast choices of the 1 hotel (normal room type less than two thousand per night) before moving into Park Hyatt are about twice that of Park Hyatt.
Western restaurant: Tomahawk steak is half-ripe, and the one that comes up is almost fully cooked; when the red wine comes up, it turns out to be warm. When the waiter was about to open it, I asked him if you can ice it? He realized that he had to freeze it. At this level of Western food, Pizza Hut is better than you.
