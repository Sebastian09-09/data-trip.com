msg:Always wanted to experience Aman Beijing, finally booked a one night stay.  

Upon arrival, Jason at the front desk was very helpful and patient in explaining various items and was pleasantly surprised to hear my room had been upgraded.  

The property and the room are just like the photos but actually physically being there and seeing all the details of the architecture, courtyards, and surrounding nature and birds is like being transported back in time to another era.  In this sense, Aman Beijing accomplishes what no other modern five-star luxury hotel can come close to achieving - making one feel a certain emotion or feeling that they've never felt, or perhaps only experienced in their dreams.  

Everything from the furniture to the layout to the art to the lighting is so tastefully executed and done, the courtyards and grounds are kept immaculate (saw people sweeping away leaves), they even have the older style bicycles available to ride there.

Ate at the Chinese restaurant twice, the environment and lighting is so nice, their dumplings are excellent and also really enjoyed some of their soups and vegetable offerings, very delicious.  

Unfortunately, I was quite sick that day and also had injured my knee the day before.  One of the staff at the front desk noticed my limp and asked if I was okay.  I told her I was fine, just a little sprain.  She went to the back and brought out a traditional Chinese 'Ban Lan Gen' pain relief spray can which she kindly gave to me, saying I could use it and take it with me, very touched.  I think it is moments like these which one will remember many years later.    

All the staff I met there were very kind, during lunch was fortunate enough to meet Ivy, the F&B Manager who was very warm and hospitable.  Then during dinner, after I saw down, a restaurant staff asked if I would like an ice pack for my leg, I asked her if she thought it would help and she replied, "Yes."  They proceeded to bring out a huge ice pack that was able to wrap around my entire knee, providing instant relief.  Finally, when it was time to leave, the very lovely and kind Lucy asked if I would like more ice packs to be sent to my room so I could ice my knee before retiring for the night.  

Even though I was not feeling well, it was an unforgettable experience due in large part to the kind and wonderful staff there.

The staff are so friendly and the service is just amazing. I would give them more than 5 stars for service If I could. I am an executive for Resort development with Universal and I got a lot of great ideas during my stay. It is very quiet and peaceful and especially at night. I also had one of the best massages I can recall with a Shifu massuer. I am not sure what herbs he was using and I was dubious at first; but the proof is in the results. You just have to stay here at least once in your life!

In terms of catering, birthday bags, ice cream, drinks, etc. were also given.
I participated in two cultural interest classes, which were so fun... such a happy experience.
There was something wrong with the air conditioning. There was no air conditioning for two nights and it was too hot to sleep well.

msg:Just came back from Aman Beijing Summer Palace, I really think this place is amazing! First of all, I have to praise their upgrade service, which upgraded me to a super large room, which was awesome!

Their private cinema has to be mentioned, with a rich selection of movies, great picture quality and sound effects, and watching a movie at night is simply a great way to relax.

However, there was a small episode, that is, a staff member accidentally entered our room at night. Although it was a misunderstanding, it was indeed a bit embarrassing at the time. But the hotel handled it quickly and the attitude was also very good, which made me feel very comfortable.

When it comes to service, the hotel staff are very enthusiastic and thoughtful, which makes people feel very comfortable. So, in general, except for that little episode, I am still very satisfied with my experience at Aman Beijing Summer Palace.

Highly recommended to everyone, if you have the opportunity to go to Beijing, this hotel is definitely worth a try!

msg:There are many things to complain about the hotel. Let me first say something positive, because the location is indeed very unique. In such a historically significant place, there is such a quiet environment in a bustling city. It is really blessed by nature. The surrounding trees are all centuries old, and the environment is also very good. I think it is a very good choice to have a good rest here and enjoy the leisure time. Now let's talk about some software issues that really affect the quality of our stay.

I have stayed in many hotels. For example, Capella is the same price. Aman is not just a street away.

On the first day of check-in, I had a suitcase. They sent my suitcase in, and then they didn't care about it. I found that there was no place to put it in the room. I could only put it behind my sofa, which meant that my suitcase was spread out on the ground. First, it would block my way to the bathroom. Second, it could only be placed on the ground, so I squatted on the ground for two days to get things. Well, the same situation, well, it should be equipped with a luggage rack, but they didn't.

I found that my clothes needed to be washed, but I was afraid that the water would be stacked in the cabinet, so there was no place to hang them. I didn't want to hang them in the yard. , I need a place to support myself, preferably where water can drip on the floor. After I reminded them repeatedly, they put a piece of cloth under me when they made the night bed.

I don't know why there are some bugs and flies in the room. I told them, and they said they didn't see any flies. To prove the existence of the flies, I took a photo. I don't understand why there are flies and bugs in such a clean and comfortable place.

Well, the funniest thing is this desk and his chair. When I want to sit on the desk, the chair directly hits the bed, which means I don't put my feet in. Maybe I have to sit sideways to sit in. In addition, the cushion on the chair is also very interesting. Well, it is easy to move. It is actually very inconvenient. After I made this desk, I actually blocked the bed completely. That is to say, if I want to go to bed to rest, my family can only go to the other side of the bed. There is no way. We are poor and can only afford such a big place.

The noodles were all lumpy on the first day of breakfast, but it was much better on the second day, but I ordered a pot of Dahongpao. No one added any hot water for me in the middle, so do I only deserve to drink one pot?

When I was watching a movie, I was very grateful that the movie was shown as if it was arranged for me. But when I left, no one turned on the light for me. I walked out in the dark, and my hat fell in the movie room. Fortunately, they returned it to me in the end. But if you think about it, it is a bit scary to walk out of the movie room alone in the dark. Fortunately, it was not at night, but in the afternoon. On the last day of leaving the hotel, I asked Ctrip’s butler to help me confirm the time of leaving the hotel on the last day. They told me that they had tried, but the hotel only let me check out at 12:00, so I arranged my next trip according to this time. I never expected that I received a call a few minutes later. They said that the hotel front desk said that they could help me upgrade the process, but I had already arranged other trips. I was just curious why they didn’t reply directly to Ctrip’s butler? On the last day of my departure, I needed a plastic bag, so I called the front desk to ask if they had any. The front desk told me that they didn’t have any. Well, actually, I had no place to put my wet towels and some other wet things. They said they only had paper ones, as if they were very environmentally friendly. When I got to the front desk, the front desk also gave me a plastic bag. I didn’t understand why it was so hard to ask for a bag?

To be honest, with the same quality, these details management and service really can’t keep up. The most interesting thing is that there was a cultural class of paper cutting. The teacher saw that I was the only one coming, and I finished it in about 10 minutes. I wanted to talk about the paper cutting culture, but the teacher didn’t have the patience to talk, and then kept complaining there, saying that after the epidemic, no one asked him to go to class. Maybe it was because the economy was not good, but the question was why? Even if I was alone, they didn’t have the patience to teach me this culture? It is said to be an intangible cultural heritage. The funniest thing is that after cutting the paper, they didn't do anything to me, they just gave me a plastic bag to put it in. I really didn't want to spoil my fun, so I left quickly.

Maybe it's because we are in the north, the management is really not meticulous, I think he doesn't deserve the price, I am very grateful that they are trying their best, of course the person in charge will also work hard to implement it, but if you have to find the leader for everything, isn't it very troublesome? Isn't management about standardization? I really can't understand why such a small thing has to be so troublesome

I have stayed in so many hotels. If they are of the same level, I think Capella's service and details are a hundred times better than theirs

Capella makes me feel at home, while Aman makes me feel depressed and uncomfortable, and inconvenient, just like putting conditioner in a very beautiful gourd bottle, but have you ever thought that conditioner is so sticky that I can't pour it out at all, and I don't know if the faucet in the shower is designed like this on purpose, or it is broken from the beginning, anyway, the handle is always loose

The faucet of the washbasin and the porcelain countertop are almost in love, and I have to touch the sink every time I wash my hands, and the water is also very slow

I think such a comfortable courtyard is refreshing, not uncomfortable everywhere. It's a pity for such a good view, it's a pity for such a good location

The last thing I want to mention is that I brought another relative to the hotel on the first day. Although they did not stay, they also wanted to go to the Summer Palace, and they were all over 60 years old. So I told the front desk person in charge that day that the hotel can bring two people in, can I bring two more people over 60 years old? Because people over 60 years old can get free tickets, so we don’t have to act separately. Before I finished speaking, the person in charge said: This matter has nothing to do with age, and directly rejected me, so that I had to let two elderly people over 60 years old separate from us. Such inhumane management is simply a bad review. It seems that he saw so many of us with disgust. Even if my relatives are visitors, you don’t have to treat us like this, right?

There are four Amans in total, and I have stayed in two of them. Beijing Summer Palace Aman is garbage!

I don’t need any compensation, I don’t need any reason, I just want to tell everyone the management of this hotel truthfully, that’s all, he doesn’t deserve this price!

msg:It's been a long time since I last reviewed a hotel [not easy] After eight years, I came to Aman Summer Palace again. It was as quiet as ever. It was separated from the Summer Palace by a wall. During the May Day holiday, it was like two different worlds... I would like to praise the food. Every dish in Aman House tasted just right. It was a pity that I didn't order the roast duck in advance. Breakfast was self-service ordering. The eggplant and pork shaved noodles reminded me of the taste of my parents' hand-rolled noodles when I was a child. It was so delicious. The wontons and sesame cakes ordered by my husband were also good! The hotel service was up to standard, especially the food exceeded expectations. If I don't have a new goal when I come to Beijing again, Aman will still be my first choice.

msg:The hotel was originally part of the Summer Palace, with an excellent location. Guests staying in the hotel can enter the Summer Palace through an exclusive channel unlimited times. It is especially important to enter the park earlier than other tour groups. Those who understand will understand. The geographical advantage is unique. This is very good.

It has been built for a long time, and some hardware needs maintenance and upgrading. Objective reasons can be understood and accepted. The hotel is currently making improvements in parts.

But as many netizens commented, the hard flaw of Aman Beijing is the software. The flaw is too hard.
The quality of the staff is uneven. It really needs to be improved. Although I was mentally prepared before, I was still surprised.
First of all, the car welcoming master, doorman, and front desk staff at the gate are all very qualified and qualified. I thought it was very good when I first arrived. It was the netizens who were too much.
Later, I was quickly slapped in the face by reality (the eyes of the masses are really sharp).
The service staff in the imperial kitchen (excluding several managers) were extremely inappropriate. I won’t go into details, but I was surprised when I encountered such a situation in this level of hotel for the first time. It was absolutely not an exaggeration. After the feedback, the manager's attitude and compensation can be felt to be sincere, but it does leave a bad experience.
The big sister of the cultural center has a warm attitude but her behavior seems to have not been systematically trained. There is no standard speech. She chats with employees in front of guests, who is scheduled for the night shift, how many pairs of mandarin ducks are sold, how much is a pair, whether she is tired, etc.
How big is the gap between the staff of the Imperial Kitchen and the Cultural Center and the front desk staff? It is so big that there is already a sense of separation. The staff of these two places makes people feel like they have returned to a state-owned hotel. Are they outsourced employees? . . Why is this happening? The front desk manager keeps cleaning up, and I can feel that she is tired.

The second is the management details. In the afternoon, the Cultural Palace activity was told that it was dough modeling. When I arrived at the Cultural Center, I was told that it was face painting and fan painting. Later, the activity started, and other guests who came over thought it was dough modeling.
The face painting is the kind that children play with in the children's center of the shopping mall. There is no experience and no teaching, and the quality of the brush is shabby. I don't believe that the teacher can draw smooth lines with this kind of pen. The teacher only taught how to paint fans, but he was not proactive. There was no communication throughout the whole process. The elder sister said that the fan was brought by the teacher himself and sold separately. If you buy it, you will bring the painting. Because there is no need for teaching, the elder sister continued to chat with the teacher.
The product introduction page shows that there is a tea room for tea tasting, but it is not actually open. . . And no reason was given. If the hotel focuses on culture, please show sincerity and pay attention to details. The original intention of the policy is good, but the implementation is shattered.

Those who only talk about requirements without talking about price are playing **. The above problems may be ignored in other four-star or even five-star hotels, but this situation should not occur at all when booking Aman for more than 10,000 yuan a night.

I am a local, there is no regional discrimination. I only compare domestically. Our Beijing Yihe and Shanghai Yangyun are three seasons apart in terms of management and personnel. I have always liked this brand. I just hope that Beijing can improve as soon as possible and get better and better.

msg:Service: First of all, let's talk about the service. Aman is great. It is one of the few Aman hotels that I have experienced and I want to stay in again.

Environment: There are fewer street lights at night, but it does not affect the street lights in my yard. The 28-bar bicycle reminds me of when my grandfather sent me to school when I was a child. This is more touching. Watching my mother riding the 28-bar bicycle again and taking a video is very meaningful to me.

Hygiene: The room hygiene, including the yard hygiene, is beyond reproach. I think it is within the range of carefulness.

The waiting time for check-in is a little long, which is easy to delay the subsequent plans. It is also because I stay consecutively, so this small shortcoming can be digested. It is super convenient to go to the Summer Palace. It can be said that I can flexibly avoid the crowds and take pictures for my mother. My mother is very happy. This is enough for me.

The hotel itself is very beautiful, and everything looks like a painting. But compared to the architecture and scenery, the service is the most disappointing. What touches people is that the services of many hotels are now good, but Aman gives people the feeling that the service is completely integrated into every detail of your stay, and there is no feeling of being disturbed at all. Especially thanks to Li Chen in the lobby, From check-in to check-out, we can think of the best solutions for guests in every step. They are very comprehensive, thoughtful and meticulous. They even took the trouble to open the door and carry our luggage for us. Even, it is very simple and service-minded. Xiaoxue, who has a very sweet smile, is always friendly.

We walked around the Summer Palace in the afternoon and made an appoin**ent to watch a movie in a private theater in the evening. The whole family was very relaxed.
The hotel knew that we had children and helped add bed surrounds. The service was very attentive.
Dinner and breakfast were also eaten in the hotel. The ingredients tasted very good, and we also had Beijing specialty shaved noodles with tofu and so on.
If I have to nitpick, I think the mattress is a bit too hard.
I hope I can stay at Yihe Aman again when I have the opportunity to go to Beijing next time☺️

I was also given 4 ice rink tickets. I didn’t need to queue up at the back door and had unlimited access to the Summer Palace. ! I booked a suite and was upgraded to a deluxe suite for free. The room called a Hao is very big. The mini bar inside has free drinks, which I can't finish. The room is very quiet and can make people completely relax. In the end, we provided 3 costume photos for free. The photos we took were so stunning that we all liked them and spent a lot of money to buy them. The overall feeling is very good. It would be nice if there were more dishes, because it is Semi-self-service. Every time I travel, I choose the top three hotels in the region and I will definitely not fall into any trap. I always believe that price equals quality. When I travel occasionally, it is better for myself, hahaha.

msg:Very dissatisfied. As a regular guest at Aman, I have felt that the service has been unsatisfactory since last month. My feelings this month can be described as shocked. The security guard at the door can never remember the license plate number and has to intercept and ask questions every time he enters the hotel. The process of getting takeout is extremely cumbersome and inconvenient. The doorman cannot help contact the front desk if he does not accept the takeout. Guests have to communicate with the doorman and call the front desk at the same time, as if the internal communication system does not exist. The most disappointing thing is the breakfast. There was a reception at the hotel on the first day, which may have exhausted all their energy. I only asked for two pieces of bread to be toasted and waited for 20 minutes. In the end, it was too late and I asked for packing. The hotel that charged us 7,000 a night didn't even have a packing box. If you don't want to give it, you can wrap it in plastic wrap for me. As for the handbag, there may be an additional charge. The next day I was too nervous to work anymore, so I just asked for a cup of black coffee to be packed and delivered to the room. The reply said that there would be a charge. The problem was that when I checked in, I repeatedly checked whether there was a coffee machine in the room. After getting a positive reply, I found that there was not one. I had no choice but to Just asked for a cup of coffee. Regardless of the charge, I got a cup of coffee as a gift - why, can I still go out with a coffee cup? I don't even bother to mention that the sink is always blocked. This stay experience can only be described in one word: outrageous. The overall experience is simply a disgrace to the Aman system. We don't recommend outsourcing services, so don't make the guests feel uncomfortable.

msg:Aman Summer Palace has the most satisfying breakfast among many luxury hotels. Even an omelette will be served on the plate right away and exquisitely. Hot and sour soup, xiaolongbao, shrimp dumplings, waffles, pancakes...the buffet breakfast can't be compared to the freshly made ones. I love the breakfast here so much! The service was even better. My child had a cold and asked if there was any brown sugar ginger water. He was told that it would be delivered to him soon. I thought it might be brewed brown sugar ginger tea, but I didn't expect it to be freshly brewed. It was particularly delicious. The last time I had such an experience with such attentive service was at Beijing Cultural Oriental and Shanghai Peninsula Hotel, but the breakfast at Summer Palace and Aman was still one of the best! Special thanks go to the front desk manager Miaomiao, who found a pocket for us to put several small bags in before leaving, otherwise it would be difficult to take things.

It is really convenient for old Beijingers who like to visit the Summer Palace and fill their childhood memories. There are fat tabby cats fed in the courtyard, which are very cute. It's a pity that it's too cold. I just saw it when I checked in. I guess I usually keep warm. Come back next time when spring comes and flowers bloom to experience the unique style of the Summer Palace. PS: Apart from the noisy air purifier, the room is still quite warm and comfortable. The food is delicious and I also got a 600 yuan meal ticket~Tiger Group loves it~

msg:I booked the most basic room type, which is small and has the same configuration as an average five-star hotel, but without a bathtub. The characteristic of Aman Beijing is its excellent geographical location, which is connected to the Summer Palace through a back door. You can enter the Summer Palace directly from the hotel and be guided by hotel staff. The Summer Palace is very big, so it’s good to get up early and take a walk. The service is quite satisfactory, unlike the personal butlers provided by some resort hotels. After all, the room is not big, so these services are not really needed. The breakfast is really worth recommending. The buffet is a la carte, with Chinese and Western food and Beijing specialty snacks, and they are all delicious. The self-service meals are also great, as well as sparkling wine. I also experienced the private theater on the 2nd floor underground. The private theaters all feature classic films, giving you the feeling of watching a movie in a private theater. The ba*****t level is a fitness and spa area. The gym equipment is very complete. In short, because of the reputation of Aman, you can still come and experience it. It is suitable for couples or families.

msg:Most of the hotels I selected have good reviews. I actually want to give a negative review, but out of respect for Yihe and Aman, I’ll leave it to you to review: I won’t say much about the facilities. The rooms are small and the furniture is a bit cramped. Because it is an old building and is acceptable, the focus is on service. To sum up, I say, you are very polite no matter what happens, but you will show up when something happens! 1. We took pictures in a courtyard. There was no guest in a guest room with the door open, and the waiter was cleaning inside. We took pictures at the door. Pay attention to the door! The waiter said with a straight face that you can't take pictures here and closed the door without touching it! 2. We went to the Summer Palace because we didn’t bring our mobile phones to charge, so we agreed with the waiter that we would return to the hotel at 1:00 and you would open the door. However, when we arrived at 12:55 and no one showed up at 1:10, we had to take a detour back to the hotel and ask at the front desk. Reply with 5 words, something was delayed, and then nothing happened! 3. The only breakfast I was satisfied with after staying for three nights was the breakfast. On the morning of the third day, the place was changed without anyone notifying me. There was no reminder in the restaurant. I found the Chinese restaurant by myself. There were many people in the space and there was no ventilation. It was very depressing and rushed. After eating…

There are also activities for children every afternoon, which is very fun. Their roast duck is delicious, much better than the ones outside. Special mention goes to Selina Lu from the Chinese restaurant. Her service is professional, enthusiastic and patient. The child was not feeling well one day and vomited while eating. Together with another waiter (sorry I forgot her name), she helped clean up and cooked the food thoughtfully. Congee, you are so considerate, thank you so much.

(It’s a pity that the Aman map was not placed in the room for us at that time. We wanted to take it back as a souvenir.)

I experienced an Aman-style "travel" and started my trip to the Summer Palace through the mysterious door. The Summer Palace is really big, but my physical strength is not commensurate with my ambition, so I didn’t finish it in one day. Just save it to meet Aman next time.

In the evening, I had an impromptu meal at the Aman Hotel, but unfortunately I didn't get the roast duck and the claypot rice was sold out. (Crying quietly) But several other dishes are also good.

At the end, I would like to thank the Aman concierge and hotel staff again for preparing birthday decorations and surprise gifts, and also upgraded the room without hesitation. At the same time, I would also like to thank Aman Hotel for the small desserts sent in the evening.

Looking forward to seeing you next time.

Two-thirds of the entire hotel is an old house from more than 400 years ago, maintaining the layout of the royal courtyard in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. It is full of antiques, carved beams and painted buildings, and graceful. It is worthy of being a representative of luxury hotels in the capital.

msg:First time staying at Aman. The location is perfect. A small door can enter the Summer Palace. But you need to be accompanied by the staff because the lock of the small door needs to be opened from the inside, and when you come back, call the service staff to open the door. Some of the rooms inside are said to be old floor tiles and foundations. Mainly the former Galeries Lafayette's dining room, pharmacy, flower house, stables and so on.

The hotel itself is integrated with the Summer Palace, and you can come and go at any time. The service is very good, responsive to every request, full of sincerity! The breakfast must be praised, the ingredients are fresh, the workmanship is exquisite and unique, it is the best hotel breakfast in all kinds of five-star hotels at home and abroad that I have stayed in! In the scorching heat of Beijing, it is very comfortable to visit the Summer Palace in the morning and evening, and spend the rest of the time in a hotel!

The hotel is near the East Gate of the Summer Palace, and there is a back door that can be entered and exited at any time, which is very convenient. The front desk service is in place, and it is very heartwarming to borrow an electric fan for personal use~

There is a small door that can directly go to the Summer Palace scenic spot, and you can go back and forth unlimited times a day to avoid the flow of people into the scenic spot. Even if you don’t go to the Summer Palace, the hotel is full of scenery. Looking forward to the next stay!

Before getting out of the car, many people came to open the door, take luggage, deliver drinks and water, check in was quick and simple, and gave us a detailed introduction to the general location of the hotel and the Summer Palace. It's a pity that we arrived a little late, we didn't eat the roast duck, and then sent us all the way to the room. The environment of the quadrangle is really good. When there is a heavy rain, the air is fresh and it is very suitable for visiting the garden. I ordered room service and waited for a long time. It may not be a quick product, so I made it now. It was still hot when it was delivered to the room, and the two big food boxes were delivered, so artistic. It was very late after dinner, so I just strolled around the lobby, played table tennis, squash court and indoor swimming room.

The sour plum soup is made by myself, it is delicious. The service is very professional and comfortable. The entire hotel room is a typical courtyard house, quiet and beautiful. I upgraded the courtyard room for free, and I like it very much. As soon as you enter the room, there are free snacks, which are beautiful and delicious, and the baby eats them up quickly. Went to swim in the pool at night, very few people, very comfortable. The private passage leads directly to the Summer Palace, which saves a lot of walking. The semi-buffet breakfast is also very good. The hotel will give you a free day in the MINI bar and a lot of mineral water. In short, five-star recommendation, and will check in other Aman.

msg:The style of Aman is still there. The biggest advantage of Aman Summer Palace is that you can enter the Summer Palace from the small gate of the hotel at any time from 6 to 19 o'clock. We went to the park at 6:00 every morning for a stroll, and at 8:00 a.m., we drove to the lake to feed the ducks. We played until 9:00 a.m. and returned to the hotel for breakfast, then went back to the cage for a sleep, and then went swimming. There will be some cultural activities in the hotel from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Children like it very much, and they can also take photos in ancient costumes in the hotel. Take a walk in the Summer Palace at 6 o'clock in the evening and then come back for dinner, avoiding the huge crowds in the summer, and having a comfortable time. The breakfast at the hotel is delicious, and the dessert tiramisu is also very delicious.

Although Aman Summer Palace is not a very modern new hotel, and the toilet is not smart, it still cannot conceal that she is a great hotel. From the geographical location to the service, to the beautiful environment, and the quiet living space, the sanitation is clean, and the carefully prepared fruits, nuts and night snacks all reveal the hotel's intentions. During your stay at the hotel, you can visit the Summer Palace unlimited times within a few steps, and you can enjoy private theater reservations. Chinese food, Western food, Japanese food are all delicious. All in all a wonderful journey.

msg:The Aman Summer Palace Hotel in Beijing used to be the place where officials of the late Qing Dynasty rested before meeting Empress Dowager Cixi. The antique lobby, elegant garden environment, and quiet courtyard are worth experiencing. Moreover, the hotel is only separated from the Summer Palace by a wall, and you can enter the Summer Palace through a small red door in the hotel. It is a different experience to enter the Summer Palace without tourists in the early morning.

msg:1. There is a strange smell in the room. I personally think it is moldy. 2. There are no curtains in the bathroom. The straw curtain can be seen from the outside when the light is on at night, which is very bad. 3. There is a huge gap in the service level. I went to the Chinese restaurant for dinner at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. There was an empty table and one table was used up but not taken away. I went to dine as a staying guest. The two waiters ignored me and took the initiative to ask questions. Their attitude was disrespectful. It was too good to say that there were no seats for the time being, so I asked them to look elsewhere, and rushed the customers directly without asking them to wait or other solutions. After complaining to the front desk, they arranged for a Japanese restaurant next to it, and it turned out that they could still dine. Such an expensive hotel, this level of service is really poor.

When checking in at the front desk, they will provide homemade sour plum soup, ice cold to relieve heat, and wet towels. Room offers fresh fruit and refreshments. Bedtime desserts and a small gift are provided every day when the bed service is opened, which is very considerate. In addition, I found that when the customer service entered the room, they took off their shoes and entered, which is great! There are many varieties of breakfast, which is quite satisfactory. The environment of the private theater is very good, but there are not many films and they are not too new. Ordered a "Sweet Honey", in Cantonese, without subtitles. All the service staff you meet will greet you warmly and provide help. Afternoon tea is a highlight, the environment, variety, and taste are all very good, recommended. The downside is that there are no seats in the yard, you can only sit or stand on the stone platform, and the courtyard room is not an independent small courtyard, but shared by two or even four families! I communicated with the front desk when I checked out, and they said they would improve the hotel introduction. Overall, it is quite good.

msg:In the summer, I took my baby to visit Beijing, brought the old and the young together, and chose Aman Summer Palace. It was noon when we arrived at Aman Summer Palace, and a delicious pear soup was served as soon as we sat down. When checking in, all the details were explained clearly one by one, and finally I got an exquisite hand-drawn map covering the overall layout of the hotel and the Summer Palace.

The little brother who helped us check in accompanied us all the way to the room, carefully introduced the layout of the hotel, the history and characteristics of the building along the way, and patiently answered our questions one by one, and felt at home.

The long corridor leads to individual courtyards, and soon we arrived at the courtyard house where we lived. With blue bricks, gray tiles and red window frames, tree shadows and green corridors, and traditional key unlocking, there is a simple and quiet scene in front of you.

The green bamboo curtains hang down, and the wooden screens cover it, and the Qing Dynasty-style home outlines an elegant scene. The mud at the bottom of Taihu Lake has been tempered at high temperature and turned into gold bricks alone, glowing in the dark, and the courtyards are not brightly lit, which adds a bit of shade in midsummer.

There are exquisite pastries and fresh fruits on the table, and the seasonal bayberry is quite delicious. There is Lapsang Souchong in the teahouse, and it is just right to soak in a pot with dried fruits.

The mini bar is ready to take, a fresh lemon is in place, and you can mix it with tonic water or soda water.

The bathroom, toilet and washstand are separated on both sides, and the place where the eyes can see is not eye-catching, and the layout has perfect privacy. The spare parts are packed in gourd bottles, which are small and exquisite, and have an elegant fragrance that makes people like it.

The small door to the Summer Palace was one of the reasons why I first chose Aman Summer Palace. From 6:00 am to 7:00 pm, I called the front desk and someone would open it. An ancient copper key seemed to connect time, opening the past and Now. The child has never seen such a key, so the young lady taught him to try it by himself, and the child was very happy to experience it.

The roast duck at the Aman Hall is delicious, and the old Beijing series in the breakfast is quite appetizing. The morning sun shines through the window, as if dining in the lush bamboo forest, which is a quiet and peaceful place.

The 8*25 swimming pool is a perfect size, and the children had a great time.

Ask the brothers and sisters at the front desk for travel information, and you can always get satisfactory answers. Even though there are no answers to questions such as "how to get to Tsinghua University and Peking University", they do their best to help with inquiries, which is really touching.

A good hotel not only has a luxurious positioning, not only has excellent hardware, but also has considerate service and thoughtful arrangements, making people feel comfortable and friendly. All of this has been achieved by Aman Summer Palace.

However, the courtyard door cannot be closed, and there are no tables and chairs in the courtyard, so I can only rest in the room. The room layout is very Chinese style, and the welcome desserts and fruits are even more surprising! A few Chinese dim sum, exquisite chocolate, big red bayberry and flat peach. In short, I stayed in the hotel for a day, welcome snacks + afternoon tea + breakfast, not only did not spend any more money on meals, but even had to pack more than I could finish. The fitness facility has a squash court, which is also very distinctive.
Some places are weird, for example, the pen holder is full of pencils... don't worry about it. The speed of afternoon tea is a bit slow, and the waiters should be more professional. I watched an embalmer in a private theater, the seats were too wide, and I was too tired to hold hands.

Enter the Summer Palace through the small gate at 6 o'clock the next morning, and you can take pictures of no one! Some people say that the rooms of Aman Summer Palace have no design, but I think it is a perfect combination of architectural features, especially the use of light and shadow effects (the weather is so good these two days, the sun shines on the bedside through the trees that sway in the wind outside ), especially beautiful! Of course, because of local conditions, the design of the room does not have any modern facilities, from the key to open the door, the panel to turn on the light, to the shower room and the toilet. There is no modern experience. If you are used to modern brand hotels, you will not be able to adapt! I think it's okay to experience it for a day or two! As for the service, many people complained about it on the Internet, but I think it is still good. Maybe Beijing as a whole does not have a strong sense of service, so I think Aman’s hotel service in Beijing is very good! All the staff who served us at Aman this time were enthusiastic, proactive and thoughtful! The snacks and chocolates provided in the room are really delicious, the drinks and beer in the minibar are also very rich, and the mineral water is replenished within a day and gave us 18 bottles! There are not many choices for breakfast, but the products are exquisite and taste good! In short, this May Day, because of Aman, we had a wonderful holiday!

msg:I feel that the overall cost performance is too average. I guess it is more suitable for people who don't think the difference of 3,000 yuan is considered money, or who simply think that living next to the Summer Palace is sacred. Even if the Summer Palace is a selling point, most of its building surfaces are obviously refurbished, but the basic buildings may be from the past, and there is no special sense of simplicity. At the same time, the facilities you really want to use are very old, such as no smart toilet, no whole-house lighting control, no projection, and you even have to manually open and lock the door with a key every time.

The check-in experience is indeed not what a hotel can give at around 2,000 yuan. Kneeling to introduce the hotel facilities, and then two people take them to the room with a deep courtyard. But the parking experience of staying in is very lucky, because the interior does not only serve hotel guests, there may be a lot of cars parked in the yard from morning to night, and because many vehicles come in instead of guests, there is no corresponding service. For example, the valet parking that should be available at this price (you can apply, but you need to wait), even when we parked at the door to pick up our luggage, no one greeted us...

Finally, I feel that a brand like Aman should treat customers more like flesh and blood people, rather than a product. During the period, I asked them to borrow a small thing. This is not what hotel services "should" provide as a product, but they have extras. I have seen it all, and they just don't want to borrow it.

Finally, I offered to check out at 14:00, which is great.

The room is a bit cramped, but it’s understandable that the renovation of historical buildings is limited. The design of the shower room is not very user-friendly. The dew is a small unsealed jar, which is difficult to handle with one hand when taking a bath; the breakfast variety is simple, semi-self-service, and there are few hot dishes that can be ordered. , Introduce the room facilities and tell the men to listen, obviously the ladies also need to know.
The welcome pear soup is delicious, the snacks, fruit and mineral water are generous, and it is very quiet to go to the Summer Palace through the small gate. In short, if it is not for the brand of Aman, the experience of staying in a hotel is around 2k.

The garden selling point is separated from the Summer Palace by a wall (there is a separate small gate, but it will not open after 19:00, and if you go shopping for a long time, you have to walk back to the hotel from the main road). Apart from the fact that the bed is high enough and hard enough, there are no other facilities in the room. There are lumps in the usual canned toiletries...
Chinese restaurants and cafes are not bad, but you don't have to stay or come here to eat.
Perhaps the only interesting thing is to book the screening room, and order an old movie to pass the time.

How should I put it, if I want to throw out trash, I will definitely find a trash can within a radius of one meter. The swimming pool closes at 9 o'clock in the evening, we swam until almost 10 o'clock, the staff has been waiting patiently! The breakfast is simple and full of old Beijing features! Hot dishes are all ordered, it would be even better if there were more types of drinks! Quite satisfied! Will live again next time!

msg:In mid-February this year, I arranged a trip to the imperial capital with my family and children. During this trip, I took my young master to Universal, climbed the Great Wall, visited Tiananmen Square, and went to the Palace Museum. But the most important thing in the itinerary is today's theme, Aman Summer Palace Beijing ❤️❤️.
I remember that a few years ago, I once saw the experience of a top tourist V who had stayed in the hotel. At that time, I deeply planted this Aman hotel located next to the Summer Palace.
The day of check-in was a rainy Sunday noon, and the occupancy rate was relatively low. So I communicated with the front desk in advance and checked in smoothly at noon. Because our extended family reserved three rooms, they were arranged in the same courtyard. It is convenient for everyone to take care of each other and move around. The decoration style of the lobby is a typical front hall style of an ancient house, which is also quite in line with the personality of Aman Summer Palace.
This time I stayed in the most basic room type of Aman Summer Palace. The layout of the room is relatively simple, the bedding is very comfortable, and the welcome fruit and snacks are delicious after check-in. We went to live in the guest room on the second floor. There is a magnolia flower outside the window. It will be more beautiful when the flowers bloom in spring.
After the room is settled, please ask the little brother at the front desk to take us through the small door and enter the Summer Palace. This is also a hidden benefit of staying at Aman Summer Palace. You can enter and exit the Summer Palace unlimited times during your stay. Although the weather was really average that day, the Wandering Earth version was actually photographed in the misty rain.
As the sleet was getting bigger and bigger, we went back to Aman Summer Palace after a hasty stroll around the Summer Palace to take a good look. Aman Summer Palace itself occupies a corner of the Summer Palace. It used to be a temporary resting place for dignitaries who came to the Summer Palace to meet the Empress Dowager Cixi. When we went, the entire imperial capital hadn't completely thawed out. The children in the south had never seen such battles before. They were so happy to see the frozen lake.
It is said that when the little brother at the front desk took us on the hotel tour, he passed by the only presidential suite in Aman, named Jinyu Mantang-Royal Court Suite, because we didn’t stay that day, so we could visit the courtyard. There are two magnolias and two crabapples in the courtyard, implying that the house is full of gold and jade. Here is a short video for everyone to experience.
After returning to the room for a short rest, we went to the swimming pool to discharge electricity. Since the occupancy rate was really not high that day, our family booked the swimming pool again. The swimming pool is very beautiful and the water temperature is also suitable. The rest area next to it is also large and comfortable, which is in line with the positioning of this level of hotel.
🏊 After finishing, it's dinner time. When I checked in at noon, Director Li of the food and beverage depar**ent had already added WeChat in advance and helped to book a seat for dinner. At the same time, I read the electronic menu in advance and completed the order. Everything went smoothly. When it was time for the meal, Director Li insisted on personally welcoming him at the front desk and taking him to the table. This little insistence left a very good impression on me. Let’s talk about the dishes. The free-range chicken is delicious, the cod fort is tender and delicious, the shrimp balls are delicious, the barbecued pork is delicious, the roast duck skin is crispy and the meat is crispy. At the end, there is a bowl of fresh duck soup with eyebrows falling out for each person. Dinner without the pitfalls.
After dinner, the whole family can book a private movie theater, a perfect parent-child moment. Before you check in, you know that Aman Summer Palace has its own private theater for 32 people, and you can reserve a private time when you check in. Since we brought the young master and the little princess here this time, we decided to choose the family carnival type of Kung Fu Panda. Before watching the movie, the lady at the front desk also thoughtfully helped prepare popcorn 🍿 and the two children in Shui's family were so happy. It was the first time for the elderly to experience it. The whole family was very satisfied with this rare big family parent-child time.
A few years ago, when I first planted grass at Aman Summer Palace, what attracted me the most was the garden gate shared by his home and the Summer Palace, which allowed the guests to experience the private garden environment in the early morning. Compared with the misty and rainy afternoon yesterday, the next morning was another different makeup. The 🌅 of the Summer Palace is very quiet and beautiful.
In a hotel of the level of Aman, breakfast is usually made to order from the menu. The Chinese dim sum of Aman Summer Palace is really good, but the western dim sum still has room for improvement.
After breakfast, the weather was exceptionally good that day, and I walked around the hotel again, which was completely different from yesterday's foggy and rainy days. The sun shines in the garden, no matter how you shoot it, no matter how you look at it, it is a beautiful picture.
This time our family booked three rooms to stay at the same time. Finally, I would like to talk about my views on the service of Aman Summer Palace. Friends around me know that to be fair, I am a picky person, especially when it comes to staying in high-end hotels. My theory has always been that there is no problem with the high price of luxury hotels, but please come up with the corresponding service quality to match your price. During the entire check-in process this time, whether it was the check-in at the front desk, ordering meals during the stay, or delivering water and quilts (I want to emphasize here, I haven’t called the front desk for a long time, and someone will definitely answer it within two rings) experience), every time I bothered the young lady at the front desk to take us to the Summer Palace (including when it was less than 6:30 in the morning) to the final check-out, the whole process did not happen any part that made me feel uncomfortable. [Victory] [Victory] Here, I would like to thank the manager of the front office, Ms. Fiona Zhou, and the director of the food and beverage depar**ent, Li, [applause] [applause] for their help during the stay. [Come on] [Come on] and the front office Ladies and gentlemen in the depar**ent, it is your hard work that gave our whole family a very good experience and memories of staying. Before leaving, I made an appoin**ent with Manager Zhou to stay until the flowers are in full bloom, and we strive to come back to experience a more beautiful and more vibrant Summer Palace [yeah] [yeah]

The location of this Chinese-style hotel is very good, close to the Summer Palace, the transportation is convenient, and the surrounding environment is also very pleasant. When I checked in, the manager Fiona at the front desk was very thoughtful and enthusiastic, and patiently introduced me to the hotel's facilities and surrounding environment. The room is very spacious and bright, and the decoration style is full of Chinese classical culture, which makes me feel very warm and comfortable. The bed was also very soft and comfortable, which gave me a good night's sleep. The bathroom facilities are also very complete, and the quality of toiletries is also very good. The service of the hotel is also very thoughtful, the staff are friendly and provided me with very meticulous service. The hotel's facilities are also very complete. In addition to restaurants and coffee shops, there are also gyms and swimming pools, which are very suitable for leisure and vacation. Most importantly, the hotel is very close to the Summer Palace, it only takes a few minutes to walk, so I can easily visit this famous attraction. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here, the hotel is in a great location, and I highly recommend it to other travellers!

msg:We still have to thank the hotel for upgrading our room. We are very surprised and grateful. Also, the staff serving in the bar and restaurant are very friendly. Thank you to them!

But unfortunately, the overall Aman experience this time was very disappointing!

First of all, when we checked in, we were suddenly told that "because it was Monday", the Chinese art activities, the cultural hall and the Japanese restaurant were "not open". We already felt something was wrong, because the hotel website stated that Chinese art activities were held from 4 to 6 o'clock every day, but the Japanese restaurant was not open on Mondays, which was not mentioned at all on the hotel website! !

Next we were in the Summer Palace, abiding by their rules, and called the hotel staff to open the door for us to go back to the hotel. As a result, either no one answered the phone (we called for nearly 15 minutes), or we were asked to wait at the door for more than 10 minutes!

Finally, after we "checked out", we left our luggage at the hotel. After going to the Old Summer Palace for more than an hour, we came back to pick up our luggage. As soon as we entered the lobby, two people at the hotel's front desk suddenly stopped us. The first person asked us to pay. We spent more than 500 yuan to buy dirty laundry bags in the room. At the same time, the second staff asked us to return the room keys. As a result, the first staff immediately replied to him and said, "Yes! Their keys have been returned." The second staff asked us to return the room keys. The talented people backed away. This was obviously because they had poor communication or internal confusion. They couldn't find the key, so they questioned us in the lobby.

In fact, there are some small things overall, such as the hotel does not have decaffeinated coffee; the hotel’s front desk staff did not know where the Old Summer Palace is; or the hotel door staff watched my husband and I walk out of the hotel, and it has only been more than an hour since we left. When we went back, the same staff stopped us abruptly and asked who we were. You know, there were only "6 groups" of guests in the entire hotel that day. It sounded like we were the only ones "walking" out of the hotel gate, but he could actually do it. Can't remember. Of course, these last three items are indeed small details, but they really shouldn’t happen for a hotel of Aman’s level.

Our final conclusion is that Aman Yihe made us very disappointed, but also very surprised. After all, we never thought that these things would happen in a hotel of Aman's level and world-renowned. In the end, I can only say that the experience this time was really not good, and therefore we will not recommend people to stay at Aman Yihe.

msg:Not recommended, the facilities have not kept up with the needs of modern society, and are still the same old private club furnishings. Maybe people don't care about these powerless individual travelers. Let’s talk about some fatal injuries.
1. The underground garage feels like it was built in the late 1990s. The turns and corners inside are like taking a test for Subject 3. As an old driver who got my bachelor's degree in 2005, I am terrified. The walls are covered with scratches, which shows how heroic he is. If you're a newbie, just wish yourself luck.
2. The price and taste of the dishes are two notches higher. I have eaten a lot in five-star luxury hotels. This one is really hard to praise. I can understand that it's expensive, after all, the local environment is here, but the taste can't be worth the price. It's salty and unpalatable. Maybe they don't pay attention to individual customers, and all the good chefs are waiting for the boss.
3. It is said that it is a hotel that is convenient for entering the Summer Palace, but it is not like a hotel close to the park like the Villa of Reclining Buddha. Without a room card, you have to call and wait for the waiter to pick you up. It takes a long time. It's not surprising that the waiter is slow. The place is big and people have to walk on their legs. But it is really inconvenient for guests.
In short, let’s just say goodbye. Spending less than 10,000 yuan per night with food and accommodation is a big injustice for a Beijinger.

Environment: very quiet
Service: Everything is good, except that when we left the hotel after going out to play, we waited in the lobby for a while. But there is no such enthusiasm as when I first arrived at the store. Water is also asked for before giving it. It feels weird. In fact, it’s okay to give a cup of hot drink or towel, or be more enthusiastic like checking in. After all, there are so many waiters at the front desk. Waldorf does this very well. Masks, water, and protective wipes will be prepared for you when you leave. It really feels like your mother is thinking about you when you leave home.
The fruit sent was broken, so I made up a lot, and the response to problems was very fast. Overall not bad.

Breakfast: average, too few varieties. I am allergic to eggs and cannot eat 80% of everything. You can add some soup noodle soup or fried noodles and milk cereal yogurt.

Hygiene: Overall OK. The details still need to be controlled, the shower gel poured out of the gourd is too dirty. Unhygienic. Multiple contacts.
There is no waiter at night and the corridors are horrible. Do not live alone.

msg:Service: Warmly introduce the layout of the hotel, and there are people to guide you to various places. After check-in, there are welcome snacks and fruits. The snacks are really delicious. However, due to poor sound insulation everywhere in the hotel, the room cleaning staff and the staff in the movie projection hall speak loudly in the work room, which inadvertently disturbs the guests without knowing it.
Room: The ordinary guest room is really too small. The introduction is 45 square meters. I guess the one I stayed in is only 35 square meters. It is really cramped. The sound insulation is so poor that you can hear a little sound from the corridor. The sound of work in the linen room next door can directly wake up the sleeping person.
Facilities: Toilets and showers are too old-fashioned and can no longer keep up with the needs of modern people. The bath liquid in the gourd bottle is too difficult to pour out, and the method of digging with a spoon is not hygienic enough. It is recommended to change the pressed bottle. We can understand the antique style of the hotel, but we also try our best to consider the convenience of using various appliances.
Hygiene: Hygiene is still in place, and there is no unclean place.
Catering: The taste of the Chinese restaurant is good, and many people come to the hotel for meals, so it is recommended to try it. Breakfast is a semi-buffet order, with rich varieties and good taste.
Features: The hotel is very convenient to go to the Summer Palace. I sent two tickets to the ice rink, and it was also in time for the opening of the ice rink on the last day. I am very happy. You can book theaters in advance, and there are some classic old movies that you can watch on demand, so you can experience the feeling of watching movies in private.

The only consolation is that it is very convenient to go to the Summer Palace, the hotel has a door directly to the park.

msg:Facilities: Summer Palace remodeled square footage. The air conditioner is unstable and sometimes hot and cold, but there are dehumidifiers and electric heaters in the house. The drainage is not very good. If you take a long shower, it will overflow, but these are all understandable
Hygiene: very good
Environment: Not to mention, Aman Summer Palace combines ancient Chinese architectural styles and retains many features
Service: The exclusive butler contacted me one day in advance to find out what my bestie needs to stay in the hotel. He also made a big bed with double quilts, which is very considerate. I arrived late on the first day and worried that we were hungry. I prepared sandwiches 🥪 and orange juice. The next day was Yuanbao cookies. Big set of snack nuts 🌰
Fly in the oin**ent: Breakfast is a bit disappointing. Nowadays, luxury hotels in Beijing usually order buffet. The American style is obviously brewed, and the mince is in the ground, which is a bit low. Most of the rest, such as shrimp dumplings, wontons, and steamed buns, are semi-finished products with a bad taste.
Liubiju pork knuckle and mustard mustard are well received. Eggs Benedict and other Western-style breakfasts are quite satisfactory. The breakfast score is too serious!
Generally speaking, it is very comfortable. I will choose it again next time.

On the second day of check-in, the children will go to the front desk to find the younger brothers and sisters to play with. Later, due to the epidemic, I couldn’t dine in the restaurant. The hotel delivered the food to the room. The little brother who ordered the food said that the menu in the room was limited. The heat preservation is very good, and the small pastries are exquisite and delicious, which is a little amazing every time. Walking in the hotel, resting in the garden, the little brothers and sisters passing by will play with our children, making our life in the hotel warm and warm. During the stay, I did nucleic acid every day, and the security guard gave me warm guidance every time. As soon as you enter the hotel gate, you don't have to worry about the safety of your children. If the parents don't keep up with the children, there are waiters in the pavilions and waterside pavilions, and they will help take care of them. We originally booked a 3-day room, but we stayed for another 6 days. The hotel helped upgrade different room types. Before check-in, we turned on the heating and air purifier in the room. Once we entered the room, it was warm and there was no smell. Thanks to the little brothers and sisters of the hotel for allowing us to spend a few days of happiness and peace of mind. Next time I will choose Aman Summer Palace.

The first time the reservation was cancelled due to the emergency hospitalization of the elderly at home, the second time I had already packed the box and was about to go out, and found an unexpected pop-up window, it was delayed until November, just in time for the beginning of winter, but it was a sunny day of 17 degrees, and it was Monday again. Enjoyed various "private rooms", the Summer Palace at sunset, the Summer Palace at 7 in the morning, the quiet and warm Aman, not only the temperature of the room is comfortable, but also every waiter, housekeeper, including the maintenance worker who came across the wrong way from the private cinema. , they all lead us to the correct elevator warmly and considerately; Manager Zhou Miaomiao, who had a special fate and never "missed" no matter what, upgraded us to the courtyard room, a wonderful gift when we parted 🎁 Finally, we got into the car and stood in the courtyard all the time. I watched our car drive out of the gate, and it was a beautiful picture. As for the room facilities, welcome snacks, breakfast... Let's take a look at the pictures! All in all, it was an amazing experience! Will come again when the spring flowers bloom.

msg:Very nice stay experience. The first time I came to Aman Yihe, I chose the Courtyard Suite. I have read a lot of reviews, and only after a truly immersive experience can I know that Aman really lives up to its reputation! In the past two years, because of the epidemic, I couldn't go out of Beijing, and I also went to many hotels around Beijing, such as Banshan Hot Spring, Yanqi Hotel, Yanqi Lake Kempinski, Pushen, and Xitan. First of all, the service, in comparison, Aman's service is the best! From the beginning of check-in, there is a butler who serves the whole process. You can sit on the sofa and enjoy delicious sour plum soup while checking in easily. (Enjoy this service at the Four Seasons Hotel Hangzhou West Lake). Then a special person took us to the room and introduced the facilities in the room in detail, as well as welcome fruit snacks. The a**osphere of being at home makes people feel happy. The afternoon tea at the hotel and the Chinese food at Aman are also great! Secondly, Aman Yihe continues the tradition of Aman’s regional culture. The century-old royal courtyard is simple and elegant, overflowing with ancient fragrance, and it is easy to see. The environment is perfect! Aman's care can be seen from the interior and exterior decoration. There is also the Summer Palace, which is separated from Aman by a wall. In order to facilitate the guests to visit the park, the hotel has a special person to open the door to pick up and drop off. All in all, Aman's perfect environment and impeccable service make it the first choice for future vacations! highly recommended!

Although there are some flaws in some places, it can be seen that the hotel has been working hard to maintain it!

After arriving at the store, the staff gave a small surprise, and directly coordinated and upgraded to the golden and jade-filled courtyard suite. The single-family courtyard is very quiet and beautiful. Well, the Chinese restaurant was full in the evening. Considering that pregnant women were afraid of crowds, the restaurant provided meals to the courtyard, as well as gifts and moon cakes. After the suite is updated and maintained, the facilities are satisfactory, and the service of the staff is also very considerate, especially thanks to Martin, who plans to come again during the Spring Festival with his parents.

The hotel environment and services make people feel relaxed and happy. The cleanliness of the hotel is surprising. Not only the interior of the room, but also the entire hotel courtyard floor and corridor countertops are spotless, which is really rare in the environment of Beijing. Stayed for 3 nights and ate Chinese food, Western food, and Japanese food. The taste is not good, especially the Japanese food's buckwheat wakame noodles and bean curd oil sticks. The ingredients are very simple and the taste is not simple. The most unforgettable thing for me was seeing the rare big bird egret by the pond in the hotel courtyard. Finally a thumbs up to all the service staff because their service makes you so relaxing.

It is not convenient to go out of Beijing during the epidemic, but this year is also the fifth anniversary of being with my husband, so I decided to order Aman and experience a different kind of Summer Palace. The hotel has upgraded the room type for us. The room is very spacious, there are a lot of fruits and snacks in the mini bar, and the sound insulation is OK. Occasionally, we can hear the inexplicable screams of children, which is acceptable. It is difficult to avoid it during the summer. The room facilities are not new from blingbling, but this sense of use seems to be more in line with the entire courtyard. The toiletries are packed in a small gourd, which is very cute. The whole service is in place, the service staff are very polite, speak softly, and there is no too much interruption, and the level is very comfortable. There are more people at breakfast, but the speed of serving is ok, and the selection of categories is also rich. The spa chose Chinese massage. The technicians are very skilled. After pressing, the whole body is relaxed. There is a passage between the hotel and the Summer Palace. From the hotel to the Summer Palace, the number of people is really geometrically multiplied. I especially want to say that there are AMAN pictures at the head of the bed that are carefully reviewed. Book, I am very emotional, I hope to follow aman to all kinds of fun places in the world~

The room should be the smallest standard room in Aman in China. The hotel's mini bar is also free. Fruits, snacks, desserts, etc. are presented. It should be the hotel's lobby manager who also gave the children two cute little souvenirs, as well as luggage tags.

The first time I met a lady who looked like a lobby manager holding a child's ID card and chatting privately with the waiter in front of me, in fact, she wanted to charge... Sure enough, I guess By the way, after some sales, I didn't answer the call and took us to the rudimentary room in the hotel. I was fine, but my family said: How can there be no bathtub in this level of hotel, the most amazing thing is that there is only a chair... Yes The photo is proof, my baby and I can only sit on the high bed and eat snacks.... Today, I looked through the photos of other ordinary rooms. They are all spacious rooms with large sofas. From the breakfast the next day, the flow of people Look, because the occupancy rate of the epidemic is very low, can't we also give us a slightly larger room when we look at our family of three? Amman charges such a high fee, it's a bit embarrassing!
Let’s talk about surprises. Breakfast is powerful, Western food is powerful, and the density is extremely low. It is just a corner of the Summer Palace. The sense of satisfaction is multiplied. You can enter and leave the Summer Palace at any time, especially in the morning. The Summer Palace is very quiet and beautiful. The attitude of the waiters is very good!
I would like to come again, I hope the hotel can give a regular trea**ent at that time, treat a family of three with children kindly, and don’t make you spend a lot of money to upgrade to a room type of nearly 10,000 yuan! ! !

We went to the anniversary, and there was no special arrangement and arrangement except for the room upgrade, and there was no sense of ceremony. This is very fatal as a high-end hotel, and I won't go to spend any special days again. Last year, I spent it in Shanghai aman. The difference really feels that Beijing is pirated. The taste and price/performance ratio of Chinese restaurants are also very low, which is really unpalatable. The breakfast is also very bad, the leaves of the vegetables are rotten, the hot dishes are disgusting, the coffee is like traditional Chinese medicine... I really suggest that the high-level horizontal comparison should be improved. Beijing is really bad, if it is the first time aman is here to estimate Won't go to the aman range again...only hotels in the location but without any of the added value we expect from aman. Disappointed, shouldn't be here for an anniversary.

Very good hotel experience.

It turned out that I was worried that the service was not good when I read the reviews, but it was actually superfluous. The courtyard in the room is clean and tidy, and every waiter is polite and friendly. The breakfast is rich and delicious, especially the sesame biscuits are crispy and fragrant! Although it is a bungalow, it is not cold at all in the winter. It happened that snowflakes floated in the capital early the next morning, and the courtyard with blue bricks and red columns covered by snow was very beautiful! What is particularly commendable is that every time a guest goes to the Summer Palace, the service staff needs to walk through the entire hotel yard from the lobby to unlock and lock the door; when the guests come back, they have to trouble them to unlock the door again, which is very hard! The private cinema in the hotel is also very good and worth experiencing! All in all, this is a very good hotel and we will definitely go back! I also recommended it to a few friends, and I hope to have the opportunity to live with my family!

msg:Came here in admiration. Siheyuan is suitable for a large family or a group of friends. Due to the low occupancy rate. Breakfast is delivered to the room at 0:00. It is cold outside, which is much more convenient than going out to the restaurant early in the morning for a buffet. The private theater can accommodate thirty-eight people, such as business-class electric seats, which are very comfortable. It's just that the optional videos are a bit old, but there are cartoons that children like. Pool, sauna, fitness seems to end at 7pm, a little inconvenience.
The booked package includes afternoon tea for two at Jingyingxuan. When the dim sum was served, it was found that it was not on the menu at the time of reservation, and most of them were sweet. The waiter asked the foreman to explain that the menu was a long time ago, and it has long since been changed to the spring menu. (But we clearly booked a set menu event that was launched in mid-March. Is it a long time ago that it was just over half a month? And we didn’t inform about the menu changes in advance after we sat down.) When I went back, I saw online group purchases of more than 300 people from his family. The afternoon tea menu is almost the same as the afternoon tea for two people served to us. There is only one refreshment for each type, but there is an extra cup of ginger tea, and this group purchase seems to be a few months earlier than the package activity I booked 😏 Previously at Marriott The afternoon tea for two people is two of each. And Aman's afternoon tea for two is only one more drink than the afternoon tea for one person, and the amount of refreshment is the same.

At the end of each year, the whole family spends one night in the Summer Palace + Summer Palace Garden. The sense of ceremony should still be needed sometimes. Aman Summer Palace and others The experience of the hotel is different. It is such a special existence. I booked the movie screening room after the Chris**as Eve buffet in advance. The next day, although the cold wind was bitter but the sun was shining, I entered the Summer Palace from the small gate and saw Kunming Lake and the Seventeen-hole Bridge, and the royal garden. How many times still feel that beautiful. The hotel’s service staff are all kind and warm. The manager gave the best price to upgrade the deluxe suite. The whole yard is our family, and the quietness at night is unparalleled. If you have this Aman complex, you must understand what I'm talking about. Tucao a little bit, the Chris**as Eve buffet is a bit watery, except for the meat salad cake, there is no other staple food such as spaghetti fried rice. Later, I had to order the udon noodles from the Japanese restaurant for the children, but the lucky draw won the order of Jingyingxuan. The afternoon tea set for people is balanced. It was used after visiting the Summer Palace the next day. It coincided with the working snow machine on the surface of Jingyingxuan Lake. It was a slightly reduced version of the artistic conception of fishing alone in the cold snow. It was a wonderful day!

msg:I rarely write hotel reviews, but I really couldn't help it this time. As Amanjunkie, Aman Yihe has the worst comprehensive experience in the Aman family I have ever stayed in. In some respects, it is not even better than many three- or four-star hotels. Stayed for two nights, entangled again and again whether to check out early.
Let me talk about the good things first, there are two main points: style and location. The hotel is rebuilt from the back kitchen and dining room of Empress Dowager Cixi. It is separated from the Summer Palace by a wall. The architectural style and location of the hotel are unique.
Then there are shortcomings, share some objective problems:
1. Poor sanitary conditions: when you enter the room, you find hair in the bathroom sink and unidentified blood stains on the pillow;
2. Disrepair for a long time: the sewer pipe is aging, every time you take a bath, the water in the bathroom does not have ankles, and the water outside the bathroom is full of golden mountains;
3. Insufficient staff training: The wrong dishes are frequently served for breakfast. In 2 days, 5 different waiters before and after served the wrong dishes 6 times, and they were mostly at a loss after asking;
4. Lack of hygiene/safety awareness: The fruit fell on the floor when the waiter received the dish, and the waiter behind passed by and ignored it. More than ten minutes after the diners left, the floor was still a mess that was not cleaned up in time;
5. The public area is not maintained in time: I entered the movie theater. It has been a period of time since the last screening, but the empty water bottles and popcorn cans of the guests were still left on the sofa before being reminded to clean up.
There are also some hardware problems, such as serious water in the road area outside the hotel on rainy days, water leaks in many public areas, and humid and smoky rooms in the room, so I won’t comment much.
This time I came to Beijing to check in Yihe Aman specially. I read the comments before I came here, but I was actually a bit nervous and entangled. But because of the Aman plot, it still came. Afraid of the gap, I even made psychological construction ahead of time. But the final experience was still far below expectations.
Bottom line: If it is for Aman's feelings, every Aman hotel is irreplaceable. But if you want to consider comfort, you must think twice before deciding to come.

I feel that there is no one in the hotel at all. The business is very general, but the price is adjusted high. Prices will never drop. It's a marketing strategy. The boss is not in a hurry to make money. Of course, it cost more than 4,000 yuan to live in. If it is still overcrowded, it may be in a worse mood.
We ate at their Chinese restaurant at noon on Saturday, and we were the only table.
I think if they are willing to adjust the house price to a slightly normal level, such as more than 2,000 yuan, I am afraid the business should be much better. It took me a long time to decide to live this time, but I feel that it is impossible to spend more than 4,000 yuan to go back for the second time.
The service was excellent

msg:The breakfast is semi-buffet, hot foods can be ordered as many times as you want, cold foods are served out, the dining environment is good, the ingredients are fresh and the service level is high. In the suite, the sofa was changed into a single bed, which is very suitable for children to sleep. The constant temperature swimming pool is on the B1 floor, 1.2-1.6m, the depth and water temperature are enough for children to play. The location of the hotel is good, quiet and quiet. The toiletries and lotion taste great, right...because they are all in gourd-shaped utensils, shampoo and body lotion can be poured out well with good fluidity, conditioner and Lotion can only be deducted. . It affects the use a little. In addition, the hot water pipe should be kept a little longer when washing. The overall feeling is very good, will stay, contact the front desk to say to play in the Summer Palace (need to unlock), directly from the small door is the East Palace Gate.

msg:The environment and service are not said, is first-class level. But there are also some places worth improving. Several times of inquiring about the service, I didn't know that I was a resident customer, I thought I was coming to have afternoon tea and punching in. There are only so many rooms in total, and the guests should remember who they are. In addition, the daily meal is average and there is nothing special. The bar of Jingyingyi needs to be improved, the menu content is too little, the level of the blending is not enough, and many wines are in stock, waiting for the blending time is very long. Breakfast is still good, you can order it yourself, the choice is rich. It is very convenient to go to the Summer Palace. You can also tell the staff that they are guests of Anzhen and enter the park free of charge.
Overall, for the brand of Anzhen, can not only rely on historical heritage to collect brand premium, all aspects must be refined.

When we arrived it was raining heavily and there was nowhere to go, we went to the private cinema in the hotel to see two films.

I asked for two common rooms and a suite, and the three rooms were arranged together, which was very user-friendly. The environment is the same as the royal garden, and the decoration has Beijing cultural heritage. The buffet breakfast is exquisite, the swimming pool is clear and there are few people, and the services of various depar**ents are also in place. I went to the Summer Palace from the hotel secret road four times in two days, and it was very good. Leave a good impression on the whole family!

地理位置和房間覺得獨一無二，有機會應該感受一下。

美中不足的是，酒店的餐飲和下午茶味道比較一般，我猜可能是因為離頤和園太近，不能用明火，影響了廚師的發揮吧。另外，酒店裡裝拖鞋的袋子很好看，但不讓免費帶走，卻沒有明確説明，退房後接到酒店電話有些尷尬，平時我們住類似酒店都不拿這類東西，這次是覺得很喜歡又以為沒什麼大不了才拿的，希望以後酒店能明確告知。

中餐廳菜品不錯，沒有踩雷，價格確實稍高，但是原材料都很好，新鮮度絕對夠。我覺得標價是在合理範圍的。
私人影院空間大，爆米花也很不錯，不是很甜（優點！年紀大了就不愛吃甜的）。影片確實都比較老，但是給小朋友打發時間一部小黃人就足夠！
缺點是游泳池水太涼了，據説在換水？孩子在水池裡麪遊抽筋了…（我家孩子是請的國家隊退役教練一對一教出來的，第一次在泳池裡麪抽筋…）淋浴換衣間沒有跟泳池直通，是我第一次在國內豪華酒店見到（東南亞的不算，那邊暖和，走多遠都合理），出來找淋浴快凍死了…幸虧有温水泡池取暖。
工作人員的衣服可以更美一些，明明有很多貌美人善的小姑娘，穿着大袍子一樣的工作服太可惜了。

結果出意料的好，準時入住還給升級了豪華套房，服務超級nice，如沐春風。晚餐味道也非常不錯。最後想説的，還是景色，是真的美，夜景的美更是出乎意料。
不愧是世界頂級酒店，所有的夜間燈光都經過精心設計，沒有雪亮的如同白晝，就淡淡地在門邊，草間、樹梢、水岸亮一盞小燈，然後你就隨便拍吧，無論哪一個角度都美成一幅畫。
最後感謝酒店準備了我屬相的小蛋糕，貼心且美味。這是一次非常美好的旅程，我們會一直記得。祝福安縵，越來越好！所有服務我們的人，辛苦大家了。
🍃環境：超讚
🔔服務：超讚
【設計師酒店】獨具匠心的設計非常養眼
【帶娃愛住】孩子高一，習慣高端酒店出行，安縵的感覺他非常滿意。（唯一覺得早餐有點嘈雜，很多小孩子，不過趕上十一好像也沒辦法啦）

建築及內飾都是北京宮廷風，很美很大氣。酒店房間不多，所以整體很安靜、私密性極高。優點：
服務很好，有求必應，過生日送了鮮花還有壽桃，太有心了！
私人影院提前預訂，提供爆米花和礦泉水，太用心了！
中餐、西餐、日餐以及鏡影軒四個餐廳，西餐、日餐水準很高，鏡影軒下午茶環境絕佳、晚上可以喝酒，太好吃了！
缺點：最低4000一晚的房價，畢竟是京城最高，但是基礎房型略小。#北京旅行

3）客房服務人員素質相對較高，敬業精神值得誇獎。
4）餐廳價格雖然小貴，中餐廳廚師的水平不錯，味道地道。西餐廳及日餐廚師水平一般，食材一般，與酒店等級匹配有差距。
5）酒店很安靜，很好。綜合服務水平離高檔酒店還是有一定的差距，需要提升。
6）若今後沒有改善，那可真是可惜了這塊地方了。
