Library and billiard room were also very great. Proximity to the mall and metro make it so you can get around without ever leaving the building! Bikes are available for no additional charge. I thoroughly enjoyed taking them out to see the  city and surrounding countryside. Hotel restaurant is japanese food. It’s strictly ok. I would advise ordering through your favorite delivery app instead and getting your food delivered to your door by the hotel’s friendly  robot! Outstanding hotel. Would book again!

msg:A very good stay experience, no matter in terms of hygiene, environment and service, all aspects are as good as they should be. In particular, the room service takes the initiative to provide more bottled water according to whether you drink tea, because the single-occupancy king-bed room takes the initiative to put the extra pillows into the cabinet the next day, and proactively provides ashtrays according to smoking habits, etc., which can be used according to the room usage. Flexibility to respond to service content is very rare. This kind of detail-oriented room service standard is the ceiling level.

The equipment and facilities are relatively complete. It is equipped with DAIKIN's central air-conditioning system, so there is almost no air-conditioning noise. The kitchen tableware and cooking utensils are also available. However, the washing machine is not equipped with laundry detergent, and it is a pity that the bathroom does not have a smart toilet.

In other hotels, the robot usually calls outside the door and then opens the door to pick up the goods. In this hotel, the waiter calls before the robot delivers the goods. If the door is pressed "Do Not Disturb", another call will be received. I think the first call is a bit redundant. Maybe there are fewer robots and the waiting time is relatively short.

Disadvantages: The washing machine feels like it has not been used for a long time, and there is a smell when it is turned on. It is recommended to provide a user guide for the microwave oven, otherwise you will not know how to use it. Indiscriminate pressing can also damage the machine. The soundproofing of the room is average. Late at night, you can hear the sound of residents upstairs walking and the sound of dripping water coming from nowhere.

When I came back at night, I saw that the wet slippers were not given new ones, so they were just put aside. The used bathrobe was not changed but folded. The empty toilet paper in the bathroom was still empty. Two new toothbrushes were replaced with disposable items, and the rest were also empty.

Hygiene: The shower head was leaking. I didn't pay attention when taking a shower. When I turned on the switch, it was everywhere, just at the nozzle... It seemed that it was unscrewed and not screwed back...

The outsourced restaurant said it was too busy and would not serve after 7pm. The swimming pool was unwilling to let people in after 9pm. People were changing clothes in the locker room. The guy at the service desk ran over and muttered at the door. The hotel locker room has no door, which is very embarrassing...

They were very enthusiastic. The little robot delivering takeout and water was very interesting, and the children were very interested. Billiards is not very popular among children of this generation, and I liked it the first time I played it. However, the air conditioner was not turned on by default and it was very hot. I had to call the front desk to hire someone to turn it on. It took a while, and it was not very cool. Another regret is that there are relatively few free parking spaces on the ground, and underground parking spaces have to be paid (25% off). Although the money is not much, it gives people a bad feeling, because I have stayed in several five-star hotels around here, and I have never seen parking fees. It is recommended to change it to free as soon as possible, which is nothing more than registering the license plate. Overall, I am quite satisfied and recommend it.

Sorry for not remembering their names. One of the night shifts at the front desk at 4:30 was a young man who was polite and appropriate. When I applied for a late check-out on 5:30, he was able to accurately say my last name and gave me good support; the other was a female employee. After I expressed dissatisfaction with the poor communication in the early stage, she provided breakfast for one child in each of our two rooms (although children's breakfast has not been charged separately in various five-star resort hotels for so many years, the hotel is indeed very strict in this regard. I understand, but I think it is not humane enough).
Therefore, I hope that my previous objective negative review will not affect the evaluation of these two excellent employees. If every employee of the hotel, no matter what position they are in (the responsibility of customer service cannot be thrown to the front office, housekeeping, reservations, and catering depar**ents, each link represents the hotel's attitude towards guests and the hotel's service concept), can be like these two employees, starting from the guest's perspective instead of thinking about how to "manage and educate" the guests, and can start from the overall situation of building and maintaining the overall reputation of the hotel, I believe that this hotel can have a higher occupancy rate in the future golden period of tourism and vacation with its certain location advantages and price advantages.

I will choose to stay here again when I come to Dalian in the future.

It's not just the decoration and location of the hotel, but the warmth brought by all the employees you encounter in the hotel, and everyone's smile and enthusiasm. Before I went, I made a note to the front desk and asked if it was my husband's birthday and could you help me arrange it. The staff not only called me to confirm the birthday information, but also wrote a sincere birthday card word for word and sent me a birthday cake. When I checked in, my husband was greeted at the front desk with a sweet smile and said happy birthday. What was even more surprising was that I met the cleaning lady when I checked out today, and even she remembered it! Saying belated birthday wishes.
The location of the hotel is super convenient. The subway station and shopping mall are downstairs. The facilities are complete. The rooms, corridors and halls all smell good. Overall, I am very satisfied! Thank you for your service!

It takes a few minutes to walk to the beach to enjoy the Donggang Musical Fountain. The Venice Water City is also very close. You can just walk along the beach to enjoy the sea view and play with seagulls. , The service is good, the hygiene is good, and the stay is comfortable, so I stayed for six nights in a row, it is worth recommending.

msg:Facilities: The hotel room facilities are relatively complete, including a kitchen, refrigerator, washing machine, pots and pans... Especially the washing machine has a drying function. For swimming with children, we are a lifesaver. We also provide laundry detergent every day. If you are worried about hygiene Question, first prepare a few washing machine effervescent tablets to disinfect the washing machine. There are children's toilet gaskets, footstools, and children's toiletries in the little yellow duck parent-child room, but the slides and tents in the parent-child room are for children under 3 years old to play. The most satisfying thing is the shower water pressure in the bathroom, which is particularly strong.
Hygiene: Hygiene is a bit uncomfortable. On the first night when I was going to sleep, I picked up the pillow and put two long, long hairs under it that definitely did not belong to our family.
Environment: The biggest advantage of the apar**ent is its geographical location. First, you can go directly to the hotel when you get off Line 2 from the airport. Exit A of the Convention Center Station is the Kaidan Commercial Plaza. The commercial plaza is below the 4th floor, and the hotel is above the 4th floor. With the room card, guests can go directly to and from the shopping mall, one-stop for eating, drinking and having fun. The hotel is more than 10 minutes' walk away from the seaside of Donggang. If you get up early and the weather is good, you can go for a walk before breakfast. There are few people in the musical fountain square, only some fishing uncles, and the view is very wide. It’s not far from Xiding. It’s very convenient to take a taxi or the No. 13 bus. Dalian’s buses have a QR code, which can be scanned by one person to pay for everyone’s fare. If you eat well at Xiding, you can take a walk around Venice, and watch it at 7 in the evening The musical fountain at half past one, I walked back to the hotel without any risk of traffic jams.
Service: The room service is basically satisfactory. Whatever is needed will be delivered as soon as the call is made. Whether it is water or a wooden comb, sometimes a robot will be sent to deliver it. The happiest moment for children is seeing the robot.

msg:This is the most convenient hotel I've ever stayed in, bar none. The 4th floor of the hotel is connected to Kaidan Plaza, where you can find everything you need for food, clothing, housing and transportation. There is a Lawson convenience store open 24 hours outside the hotel, and there is an online celebrity swimming pool on the fifth floor. The conference center is outside the curtain, and you can see the Donggang seaside directly. From the hotel to Donggang to see the fountain and feed the seagulls, it is very close to walk for ten minutes. It is only one or two kilometers to the old pier or to the Oriental Venice, and the starting price of a taxi is only one or two kilometers. The hotel room is very large, twice the size of a standard hotel room. The bathroom is also very large. There is also a bathtub where you can take a bath after disinfection. Yes, excellent. The linen is very clean, and the 2-meter-large bed is very spacious, so a family of three can sleep without being crowded. There is a washing machine with drying function in the room. We specially brought washing machine tank cleaner. After cleaning and disinfecting, we wash and dry the clothes every day when we come back. There are no dirty clothes when we leave, and we don’t need to wash a lot when we go home. In addition, the room also has an induction cooker, boiler tableware, chopping board and knives, etc. The seafood we brought back from the sea bought some condiments from the supermarket downstairs and processed it by ourselves. Except that the hotel lobby is not as grand as a five-star hotel, the rooms and services are not inferior at all. Only when you arrive do you know that Fraser Suites is really a world chain. The only regret of the whole trip was that it rained in Dalian on the last day, our plane was delayed quite late, and the hotel was unable to provide late check-out service because the room was full, but the overall service during the seven-day stay was very good. I will come to Dalian again next time. I would still choose Fraser Court.

msg:This summer vacation, I took a family of four with two children to stay in this hotel. I compared many hotels before I went, and finally chose Fraser Court, which did not disappoint us. I didn't have much hope for the apar**ent hotel, but I found out when we arrived. Better than some five-star hotels. First of all, the service is very enthusiastic, and they also tell the surrounding areas where there is fun, and actively help to check the routes. In addition, the room is very large, and the kitchen is fully equipped with pots and pans. It is also thoughtfully equipped with a washing machine and laundry detergent. The washing machine is very clean! The cribs booked in advance are also neatly arranged, the bath products are also very high-grade, and there is a big bathtub! Although the window is not facing the sea, you can also see part of the sea view, the scenery is very good! There is a shopping mall next to it, so it is convenient to eat and drink. The only downside is that the hair dryer is not in good contact. For two nights in a row, we had to call home for repairs. The child touched the makeup mirror and leaked electricity, and was electrocuted. When I checked out, I reported it to the front desk. It may be because the electricity hit the children, so I sent a gift box of towels as compensation. Overall it is very good, my family likes it very much, and I will choose Fraser Court again when I go to Dalian in the future.

The 4th floor is directly connected to the shopping mall, and there is also a swimming pool and gym. The bathtub is from Weibo, and the quality is worth it. In addition, on the day of check-in, the lady at the front desk was very helpful. She introduced the details of the hotel very well. The parking master at the entrance was also very good. When I left the next day, the parking master was also very good. She was very discerning. This is better than many five-star hotels in Dalian. Strong, didn't eat breakfast, don't know how breakfast is. In short, it is worth recommending, especially for families with children. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the room does not have floor-to-ceiling windows. But the main cost performance is high!

msg:Overall it's OK. If you note your birthday, it will be decorated and a small cake will be given. The location is very good.
The bed and bathroom facilities in the room are good, and the toiletries are also very good.
But there are a few things that are surprising:
1. The hair dryer is very difficult to use. You need to hold it firmly to blow dry. There is only one socket that meets the voltage, but it is not firmly plugged in. The plug falls out while blowing. I didn’t blow dry my long hair for 20 minutes (the actual time is not exaggerated)
2. There was body hair in the bathtub when I checked into the room. After staying for 3 days in a row, the hair was not even cleaned in the bathroom. It was piled on the floor. The room was poorly cleaned.
3. The young boy at the front desk has a poor sense of service. When he encounters a problem, he will say, "It's useless for you to tell me about this." He didn't arrange a robot to deliver the takeout for 18 minutes, and his attitude on the phone is lazy.
4. There were noises while sleeping at night. There were different noises outside the window and in different places in the room. They continued. There was also a sudden shrill chirping in the middle of the night for more than two days. I don’t know what was coming from it. It was very scary.

There is nothing to say about the front desk service. I helped check in as quickly as possible. The room I arranged was very comfortable (although it was the most basic room type), and I thoughtfully arranged for a late check-out at 2 o'clock so that I could have a good rest .
The room was well arranged, with a view of the conference center and the sea from the window. The facilities in the house are very complete, including pots and pans, coffee machine, and laundry detergent. The bath amenities are Oulong's.
This apar**ent is an international chain brand apar**ent, so I registered as a member at the first time, and this apar**ent is the first choice when I come to Dalian in the future!

It is really convenient, but there are also times when I go to watch a movie at midnight and the passage is locked at 12 o'clock in the middle of the night. The embarrassing thing about running back from the outside. Oulong for bathroom supplies is well received, and the rest are basically at the normal level of a five-star hotel. However, it is a sea view room, and the view is basically blocked by the tall buildings outside the building. If you mind, you need to consider it carefully. I booked a room type without breakfast, so I can't comment on breakfast.

msg:Hotel short review:
Hotel with super convenient transportation and great service!
beginning:
Sichuan has been extremely hot at 44 degrees these days, so I came to Dalian to escape the summer and blow the sea breeze. Because it is a vacation, it is very convenient to take the subway directly from the airport to the downstairs of the hotel. The hotel is very new, and it is also very close to Venice Street across the street. Anyway, it is highly recommended!
hotel service:
The best thing about Fraser Court is that the room comes with its own kitchen and washing machine. Everything is ready to make a simple meal. Of course, if you stir fry, I suggest that you forget it, and it is completely okay to cook something simple. The front desk staff at the swimming pool (the lady) was very kind and helped me to solve the problem of forgetting my password in embarrassment, and also because we came from the south without a swimming cap. (In other words, I have never seen anyone wearing a swimming cap in the South Pool).
Surrounding:
The hotel is on the Kaidan Plaza, and the 4th floor is directly linked to the Kaidan food floor, which is so happy. If you make your own food, there is a supermarket downstairs on the first floor and it is convenient to buy clothes.
travel:
Venice is very close, you can walk there. It is very convenient to take a taxi from other places within 20!
Summarize:
The hotel is great! I will recognize this place when I come here! Hahaha, the photos attached are from the vicinity of the hotel. The view and the pool ha!

The service staff are basically bilingual, because the lover is a foreign guest, so we should praise the communication skills and high quality of the hotel staff 💁‍♂️
There is nothing to say about the environment, so I deliberately chose a newly opened hotel, which is better than other old hotels in Dalian. The New World or Shangri-La that I lived in before are a bit outdated, but the overall equipment and facilities of this time are very new. Food delivery is a robot, which is very convenient. Kadan Plaza and Donggang Pier are just a stone's throw away🛍️
The fitness equipment is very complete, the swimming pool scenery is pleasant, and the stay experience is very pleasant😊
After all, who doesn't want to face the sea and see the clear sunshine after waking up☀️～

The fourth floor is directly connected to Kaidan Square. It is very convenient to eat and shop. You can walk to Donggang for 10 minutes, watch the musical fountain, and sail to the sea. There are subways and buses at the entrance of Kaidan Square, and you can travel green when it is inconvenient to take a taxi during peak hours. The hotel management is no problem, the room is comfortable and clean, the breakfast is slightly simple, and the dining place is slightly less. Will consider staying next time.

In the second room, because the previous guests checked out late, the front desk even called me to say hello and apologized frequently. When we didn't understand the nucleic acid policy, a fat man with a big belly at the front desk specially called us to inquire about the airline to soothe our anxiety. It is really urgent for the guests, and I think for the guests wholeheartedly, which really moved our whole family. This trip to Dalian has left a very good impression on our family. Thank you for the service of the hotel! Feel at home!

msg:I was going to stay in Dalian for two days, but at 11 o'clock in the middle of the night when I checked into the parent-child room, the wind was very loud, and there was a sloshing sound. The child was very afraid that he could not fall asleep, so I called the front desk and saw a few rooms. Finally, I changed to a low-floor room. After the room was changed, the sound of the wind was so loud that I could hardly fall asleep. After forcibly coaxing the child to sleep, the two adults barely slept at night at 6 o'clock in the morning, and the sound of the wind awakened the child. The experience is really bad. The environment and equipment are okay. The hardware conditions cannot be avoided. The next day the child wakes up and the state is not good. I decided to go home and stop playing in the morning. Unless the wind problem improves, I will really blind the apar**ent.

When we went to renew the room later, our attitude was also very good. One of my sisters might be a manager , I also care about our accommodation situation, whether we are satisfied or not~ I also helped us change the money into a small denomination, (God knows how difficult it is to take the subway if you want to break the cash now 😂)
3. The cleaning aunt of the building is also very enthusiastic, and her work is also very meticulous. Even if I don't need to clean the room every day, I will ask, and the water delivery can be diligent and fast~
4. There is also the little robot that delivers food and express delivery——Baby, hahaha, talk a lot in the elevator, super cute~

就價格而言，800出頭的水平肯定比平時貴不少，但是橫向對比其他網友力推的一些所謂網紅酒店，感覺性價比很高。
酒店服務很好，剛下的士，服務員就主動上前幫忙搬行李。前台也直接幫我們把單間免費升級了到了一居室套房。升級後的房間正對大海，風景極佳。給前台打電話，反應很及時，外賣送得也很快。最滿意的是房間裏配了帶烘乾的洗衣機，去海邊回來洗衣服太方便了，一天換幾套都沒問題。
酒店出行也很方便，樓下就是2號線地鐵站和眾多公交車站。去星海廣場的建議坐16路，起點站坐雙層巴士上層第一排不要太爽。離東港音樂噴泉和威尼斯水城都可以步行，周邊吃飯的地方也多。
要説不好，唯一就是酒店網絡不太行了，衹能坐在客廳裏上網，卧室裏的信號就不行了，建議加個路由器。
