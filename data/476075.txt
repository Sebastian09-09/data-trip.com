Because the baby was small, we mentioned some small problems we encountered to the hotel after checking in on the first day, hoping that the hotel could help us. The hotel room service attitude was warm and thoughtful, and provided a bathtub and bed fence! Because we had to stay for two days, we asked to change to a parent-child room series on the second day, and we upgraded to a suite in the car series. The room has a slide, a small wooden horse shooting frame, and a building block table. It is very suitable for our little friend "under 2 years old". Although the hotel's children's playground is good, considering that the baby is small, it is more suitable and convenient to play in his own room. I sincerely thank the hotel for its service and recommendation!

msg:Overall, Nanjiao Hotel is very cost-effective. It is highly recommended for families who want to take their kids out indoors in Shanghai. If you want to go to Bihai Jinsha, you can also stay here!
The princess suite is pink and very cute, especially if you have a daughter at home, you will definitely like it!
The bed is still very comfortable to sleep on, and the room is also very clean. Both rooms are quite large, but there are not enough trash cans. It is recommended to configure 1-2 more. The bathroom has a bathtub and a shower, but if you don‚Äôt want to take a bath in the bathtub, the dry and wet separation is a bit awkward. The room facilities are relatively new.
The service at the front desk is pretty good, but both the front desk and the room service are a bit stingy about the free drinking water. It is originally a small volume of water, but there are four bottles in each room. If you want it, you will be very tight. Now many hotels have achieved the level of one for three, or even self-service in terms of drinking water. Controlling costs in this regard actually affects the guest experience very much! Other room services are quite timely.
The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is not bad, but the Chinese service is a bit far-fetched. Sometimes you can‚Äôt find anyone, and the taste can only be said to be average.
The staff at the recreation center are very nice and enthusiastic, but the staff at the children's park are average. There are several trampolines, which are quite good. The water temperature of the swimming pool is suitable, and there are not too many people. It is quite comfortable.
The hotel is not far from Shanghai Fish, about 15 minutes walk.
The surrounding area is very quiet and the sound insulation effect is acceptable. Although there are not many places to eat nearby, it is very convenient to order takeout. If you are willing to walk a short distance, there will be a shopping mall, and there are a lot of food!

msg:During the May Day holiday, I was afraid of traffic jams on long journeys, and my children couldn't stand it. Besides, the nature of my work determined that I couldn't go out without reporting. So I chose to take my child to enjoy a two-day tour in Fengxian.
When choosing a place to stay, the first thing that caught my eye was Nanjiao Hotel (Xijiao and Dongjiao are also very famous, and Nanjiao must be no worse).
Sure enough, not only the room was the same as expected, but also deeply loved by children, and it was also unique, especially the pumpkin carriage room, which is worth choosing for families with girls!
In order to let the children experience different feelings, I also chose different room themes for the two-day tour, and the princess castle room is also unique.
The hotel also gave the children dolls when they checked in, and the children were very happy! The hotel is very attentive. The only thing that needs to be strengthened is the breakfast. I hope the hotel can pay more attention to the breakfast and improve the variety and characteristics.

It only took me one hour to drive here from Changshou Road in the city on Saturday. After all, it is a five-star hotel, and the front desk service was very enthusiastic and patient. The set meal included two buffets, and we paid 128 for one large and 58 for one small for two adults and two children. After all, it is a five-star hotel, and the food is basically available, and the taste is quite satisfactory. The room is a Frozen theme room, which is quite large. It should not have been decorated for a long time, and all the facilities are relatively new. In a word, it is the most cost-effective one among the five-star hotels we have stayed in in the past year.

I have been to many hotel swimming pools, but this is the first time I have encountered a temporary inability to provide towels. I hope it can be improved. The self-service noodle stall area in the hotel is better. The noodles and wontons that can be taken directly are prepared in advance and you don't have to wait. I accidentally found that there was an old man in the buffet restaurant. While working (pushing the food cart, arranging knives and forks and other groceries) he picked up salmon with me. I was surprised to find that the old man opened a table and boiled salmon for himself! After eating, he continued to do chores, and sat down to eat again after working for a while. Maybe it is a feature of a five-star hotel in the country? At least Hyatt, InterContinental and other hotels will not find this kind of work discipline problem. At least it feels unhygienic. Either eat before work or eat after work. Suggest improvement!

Then a room with a balcony with windows that can be fully opened will make people feel relaxed and happy. After staying here for three days, the air in the room circulates naturally. When I wake up in the morning, I can breathe on the balcony. It's fresh air and quiet. Small flaws~ There is some leakage in the gaps in the shower room, and the toilet is a bit small and not comfortable.
Breakfast~~There are quite a lot of choices, including basic Chinese and Western styles. The replenishment was very timely, the waiters were also diligent in clearing the dishes and tables, the taste and quality of the food was good, the milk was from Mengniu, the yogurt was from Guangming, the cereal was from Kellogg's, and the orange juice was from Fruit Orange. According to the published price of 88 per person, the five-star price is absolutely acceptable.

There is a children's playground in B1, which is suitable for smaller children, but it is not accessible and a bit tasteless.

msg:If you stay during the Chinese New Year, you can buy the package at no extra price, which is an unbeatable deal.
As a long-established star hotel, the facilities are definitely a bit outdated, but they have everything you need. The rooms are large and the balcony has a nice view (Picture 1). There is a children's playground (picture 2-7) and a swimming pool. The children's playground has floor socks and adult slippers. There were not many people during the Chinese New Year, and the overall area was relatively young, so I didn't go to the swimming pool.
The coffee in the lobby comes with cookies. Seeing that the children like to eat them, I took the initiative to give two more cookies. However, the coffee taste is not good. It is probably the same as the breakfast coffee machine.
Breakfast is relatively average, not up to five-star level, but it's enough to eat.
The surrounding area is very close to Shanghai Fish, Paopao Park and Qingxi Old Street. It is also convenient to go to shopping malls and there are also restaurants nearby. Overall, the price/performance ratio is unbeatable. I will come again.

In particular, the overall service is really great, definitely the best among all the hotels I have ever stayed in! All the service staff, whether it is the bell girl, the front desk, or the aunt in the guest room, are very kind and very good to the children. They even gave dolls when they checked in, and they all smiled and said hello when they met.

Having said the advantages, the disadvantages are: 1. A deposit is required for check-in (although it was refunded in the end, but many hotels currently do not charge deposits); 2. There are fruits for free in the afternoon, which is a good thing, but the waiter who delivers the fruits is very impatient and keeps urging. He opened the door with a very impatient look; 3.

Parent-child room, Captain America theme, also has a balcony, children's toiletries, small stools, an automatic toilet that opens every time you pass by, the curtains are also automatic, free oranges, the TV only has radio stations, and the selection is slightly less

The outdoor water park is only open in July and August. It is a pity that the rides are all together. The indoor swimming pool is slightly small. The gym is behind the swimming pool and needs to go through the locker room. It is also relatively small and the equipment is a bit old.

The children's playground is in the ba*****t. It has a strong smell, is relatively humid, and is not very comfortable, but there are quite a lot of things. Children like the ocean balls and sand the most.

The package includes tickets to the Magic Light Forest. I went there at 8:30 in the evening. I was worried that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it in time, so it opened until 10 o‚Äôclock. It took about an hour to walk around with the children. It is still highly recommended. The light and shadow are so beautiful.

The breakfast is not bad, not as bad as the reviews. There are also local snacks such as donkey rolling, donkey meat roasting, donuts, moon cakes, homemade bean curd, small wontons, noodles, Chinese hot dishes, coffee, homemade yogurt, and salad. There are several kinds of cheese, and the service is great. I asked about the children‚Äôs cutlery and wet towels, and they were delivered in time.

There are several shopping malls nearby, including Nine Trees, Shanghai Fish, and Qingxi Old Street. Overall, it‚Äôs pretty good.

msg:Nanjiao Hotel, I knew before that it was a very good hotel for parents and children, and I had stocked up on coupons, but I couldn't make the trip. I finally had the opportunity to try it last weekend.
The room directly booked by Ctrip is a basic room type, including two breakfasts, and the summer vacation is on a Saturday. The price is more than 700, and no upgrades can be made, because "the rooms are gone", and there is no way, let me understand.
The room is in Building B, the area is small, and the entrance is narrow. Building A, I checked later, should be mostly parent-child rooms, and the corridors are very cartoony. From the ivory sculptures in the lobby to the various boulders and jade carvings in the aisles, the hotel has the feeling of a state-owned enterprise. . üòåThe room facilities are not bad, the toilet is particularly enthusiastic about flipping and closing, and the curtains and screens are automatic.
The service is not bad, the guest room, the children's playground, and the caretaker are probably all Fengxian locals, and the front desk may be college students or the like. . The front desk sent a plush Ultraman to the child, I like it very much, but the child said "too much fur", and there are two oranges in the room as welcome fruit.
The indoor swimming pool is okay, with moderate water temperature. There are two swimming lanes for teaching, and about three wide swimming lanes for hotel guests to play in. The shallow water is 1.2 meters and the deep water is 2 meters.
The children's indoor play area is on the b1 floor under the elevator of the Recreation Center. The area is quite large, unlike some hotels that perfunctorily create a small corner. There are so many adults and children on Saturdays, and some parents walk around barefoot. No wonder the staff at the gate have a bitter face. They probably can‚Äôt persuade them. The quality needs to be improved. There are also children in swimsuits, jumping on the trampoline wrapped in bath towels, dripping water on their bodies, and the ground is wet. The quality of the parents. .
The breakfast was the biggest failure this time, it was very unpalatable, the orange juice was quite unpalatable, and the fruit in the yogurt, especially the pineapple, uh. . It‚Äôs also hard to say, the coffee is not good, and after waiting for a long time, a cup of strange coffee comes out. . The fritters are soft, heyüò∞, the dining environment is messy, there are too many people in a mess, and there is no way to get a seat, but the table is still quite fast, and the waiters are okay, but the food is not delicious.
In summary, the hotel is acceptable. If you don‚Äôt have very strict requirements, the service is decent and the hardware is okay, but the catering needs to be improved. This level of catering is a bit unreasonable for a five-star hotel. It is recommended to book a naked room, and the surrounding coffee shops can provide breakfast.

After 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, there were quite a lot of people checking in. I forgot to bring my ID, but I can still check in. I just need to show my ID with me. Seeing children, the front desk immediately gave us little dolls, which won our favor as soon as they came up. The two little girls were very happy.
We live in the Aisha room. The themed rooms should be in Zone A, and there are also rooms in Zone B. Watch the instructions and don‚Äôt go wrong at the beginning like us.
The theme room area and even the corridors are fairy tales, and the little girls are very excited. The Aisha twin room we stayed in is quite suitable for a family of three, with a bed of 1.5 meters and a bed of 1.2 meters. We are two big and two small, a little bit crowded. I wanted to push the two beds together, but when we were about to go to bed at night, we started to push the bed and found that it couldn't be pushed! ! ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a child, it is recommended to borrow the fence in advance. During the summer vacation, the occupancy rate is high, and the fence will be borrowed soon. We had to push the mattresses together, but the bottom part was empty, which was slightly dangerous.
The toilet is pink, quite cute, and the bath water is very comfortable. Come back from swimming and take a shower, comfortable [Âë≤Áâô]
However, some of the keys in our room are not very good. We hope to improve it. The quilt is too thick and the cover is not comfortable.
The breakfast is not bad, it has everything you need, the noodles and instant noodles are delicious, hahaha. The venue is big enough so there is no need to queue. Children under 1.2 meters are free of breakfast.
There is an additional fee for the water park. When you check in, you pay a deposit. The water park is 236 yuan for two large and two small. You can directly pay the bill, which is more convenient. There is also a pretty standard swimming pool, you can also swim, not bad.
Overall, I am quite satisfied. There is a business district nearby, and there is a shopping mall within a few minutes of driving. It is very convenient to have dinner or something. If not, order takeaway, there are many choices.

Then, the water park is a one-off, and you need to buy a ticket again when you come out and go in. Of course, the inside is very small, and you won‚Äôt be able to play for a long time. One big and one small 168, and children less than one meter in length are also charged, 68 yuan per person, which is really not worth the fare. There is no extra charge for the children's playground, which is a little bit of face for myself. Breakfast is also the least optional in the parent-child hotels I have stayed in, and it takes 20 minutes to wait for a cup of coffee. Let me say again, the room is hygienic, and my baby and I feel that there is a problem with our skin. As soon as I fell asleep on the pillow at night, I slept on my stomach, and then my hands were extremely itchy. Because both babies were asleep, I didn't get up to collect evidence, but the touch was an allergic symptom, and there were many small swellings. On the second day, there were also two big and red swellings on the baby's stomach. Will not be coming back nor recommend.

msg:I went late in the afternoon, first of all I would like to thank the store for taking the initiative to upgrade the suite
The room is big, and the children had a great time.
As a parent-child hotel, I think the room is what children like

Experienced the breakfast, the variety is not rich, the small wontons are delicious
It's good to avoid the peak period

The water park needs to buy another ticket, which is suitable for children, but it is a bit tasteless for adults. One big and one small 168 is a bit more expensive
A swimming cap is required.

The check-out front desk is very discerning. It is very convenient to provide the parking QR code and leave with the room card. give a like

msg:I have been fancying the car-themed room for a long time, and finally made an appoin**ent. All the themed rooms are in Area A, and only one side of the 5th floor is car-themed (opposite is the panda-themed room). The aisles are covered with carpets of various vehicle patterns, which children like very much. I was assigned to the innermost room in the aisle, some distance away from the elevator. The facilities in the room are okay, but there are no special shampoo and bath products for children, and there is no bathtub. There are 4 small bottles of mineral water (in the bathroom). You can use the constant temperature swimming pool for free when staying in the hotel, but half of the area is dedicated to learning swimming, and the range of activities is not large. The outdoor water children's park opened on 7/1, but if it is not included in the package this year, if you live in a theme room and want to play, you need to buy a ticket at the recreation center to play. The indoor children's playground area is generally playable. The facilities for shooting guns are broken and cannot be used. Children like it quite a bit. You can reach the outdoor children's water park through a small cave. The variety of the buffet dinner is average. The crayfish are not fresh, the meat is soft, the lobster slices are damp, and the taste is extremely bad. The small yellow croaker only comes out for two rounds, and the amount is not much each time. It can only be said to be eaten alive. Can't expect too much. The Chinese hot dishes and noodle wontons in the buffet breakfast are okay. There are many kinds of porridge, so it is no problem to fill your stomach. On the whole, it's okay.

msg:If the child wants to play in the water, he will book it for one night. After all, it is relatively close to home, so he can leave as soon as he wants. Checked in at the store in the afternoon, changed clothes and went to the water park to play, super happy! In the evening, I ate the buffet in the set meal. There are quite a lot of varieties, and the children enjoyed it very much. It's just that the water in the small hot pot has not been boiled, so you can't cook the hot pot, which is rather tasteless. The room is a bit old, but there are bathtubs and smart toilet covers, and the price/performance ratio is acceptable.

After breakfast the next day, I went to the Children‚Äôs Paradise to play for a while, then I checked out and drove to Bihai Sands to play until I got home after 2 o‚Äôclock.

The day was very rich, and the children were very happy!

msg:It sells various parent-child themed rooms. I booked a Meituan room. The decoration is indeed Meituan, but the cleaning and maintenance are really worrying. Once you enter the room, you will face a musty smell. Fortunately, you can open the windows to ventilate. The highlight of the bathroom is the smart toilet, which is not used in the bathroom, so consider removing mold. The most frightening thing was that when the quilt was pulled away, there were hairs inside that were not hair, and the front desk asked the aunt to change all the bedding immediately, after all, some were disgusting. In order to cater to parents and children, the hotel specially transformed the ba*****t floor into a children's paradise. The air is really terrible. Wearing a mask will have an obvious strange smell. It is recommended to add a dehumidifier. The waiter for the child seemed to be indifferent to work, and the ocean ball air gun was not turned on. Whether this toy is an ocean ball or a sponge in a trampoline, hygiene is also very worrying. The swimming pool is the children's favorite place. I went there twice. I didn't look carefully on the first day. When I swam on the second day, I really couldn't stand the floating objects inside. Recalling, on the night of the first day of check-in, my son had diarrhea. I don't know if the pool is not clean. Breakfast is also the focus of my complaint. I took a bowl of small wontons and it rotted. When I asked the chef what was going on, the chef replied lightly that it had been stored in the refrigerator for a long time, and it would not be bad if it was bad. I'm really very angry because most of your guests here are children. When I checked out, I also mentioned the small wontons, and the person who checked out said "oh". In contrast, the parent-child hotel next door is really much better.

After asking the young man at the front desk if he could check in, he greeted us warmly with a smile on his face, and checked us in immediately. The room is spacious, warm, hygienic and clean (the quilt is a bit thick, and it is a bit hot at night when it is covered, but it is a little cold when the quilt is exposed.

The hotel signs are not clear, and several restaurants are either open for banquets or not! I didn‚Äôt know which restaurant was open, so I walked around twice upstairs and downstairs before I found an open restaurant, and was told that it was fully booked...

I had to go out to eat, and when I came back and was about to take a nap, someone knocked on the door and said something. Before I could open it, I swiped my card and came in. I was shocked. I had never seen a waiter swipe my card on his own in so many times I stayed in a hotel. I asked her what was going on and she said I was just checking on the check-in status. At that time, I really wanted to curse. If you have anything to do, you can knock on the door and wait for me to come. It was really beyond my understanding to come in directly.

I read online reviews that hotel guests can go to the children's water park for free, but when I checked in, I was told by the front desk that I had to buy a separate ticket for 168 children. After looking at the photos and online reviews, they generally said that the hygiene situation was not good, so I gave up and didn't go.

I returned to the hotel at 9:30 in the evening and found that the TV was broken. The guest room aunt came and pressed the button a few times and said there was nothing that could be done. The TV repairman was off work now...

The only thing I think is good is that the breakfast is okay

In short, I will never come to this store again. It is not worthy of its name as a five-star hotel. It is always promoted on the WeChat official account. It can only be said that the false marketing is too good.

In one and a half hours, the salmon sashimi was only added twice (because I wanted to eat it, so I paid special attention to it), and each time it was liquidated as soon as it was served. When I went to the beef roll in the hot pot area, there was an empty plate, and there was a piece left in it, which was still the same piece when we left. In the barbecue area, there are only bones and meat that have been fried and thrown in the frame, and there is a fish. I thought there were no other types. As a result, two foreigners came behind, and the chef fried six or seven slices of lamb chops. I happened to take two slices, and the other chefs personally delivered them to the table of the foreigners. I'm just borrowing light... Is the watermelon juice freshly squeezed? Why is it still blood red when I pour it in, but it turns light red at the back? Did you add too much water? Great variety of cakes! Others, I can only understand that there are not many people dining on weekday nights, and the cost is controlled~ Anyway, I have never seen such a fast-tracking, and I have seen it. In contrast, the breakfast buffet is okay.

msg:As soon as the kids get out of the elevator and see the decorations in the corridor, let alone the pumpkin cart üòÑ Two beds and two bathrooms are very convenient! The pumpkin lathe is in the inner room, and it comes with a super pink bathroom (including a bathtub); the adults live in the outhouse, which also has a bathroom (including a shower room). The light control switch in the room of the pumpkin car is on the pillow on the inner wall of the "pumpkin skin" (we searched for a long time at the beginning but couldn't find it, and found it by accident while sleeping).

In the river view room, I play skateboarding with my baby by the river downstairs in the morning, and watch the fireworks on both sides of the river bank and the sky in the distance from the balcony at night.

Although there is no such thing as sea urchin and crab legs in the buffet in the Sunshine Hall, there are almost as many as there should be, and the price is very worthy. Guests staying at the hotel can also enjoy a discount of 10 yuan.

The heating in the hotel is very sufficient, from the room to the corridor, especially the swimming pool and changing room, it is very warm, so you don't have to worry about your children catching cold. The swimming pool has a "small window" on the left side of the picture, and you can see the underwater. The design is very good. I took a lot of "fish tank" photos of the children through the glass outside the pool.

The hotel link has been requested by all relatives and friends

2. There are three sets of children's toothbrushes that are very cute, with small slippers and small pajamas.
3.ÔøºWhen you enter the hotel, you will get a little yellow duck. Room service is also on call. The air conditioner can be adjusted to more than 30, which is very warm. The children's playground and swimming pool are air-conditioned, and the room is not cold.
4. There are very few people in the buffet breakfast provided by the hotel between 6:30 and 7:30, and they eat a lot. Of course, if you go after 9:00, there may be fewer things, after all, people close at 10:00. The coffee is already brewed, and the taste is okay with milk. Most of the five-star hotels have food.
5. There are ocean balls, trampoline, and many other board games in the children's playground, but there are basically no people.
6. The swimming pool is very clean, and there are swimming coaches for children. The main reason is that there are few people and it is very comfortable. Ôøº
More than 1,000 rooms, free parent-child playground, we went swimming twice, + 3 breakfast buffets, I think the price is not very expensive on average.

1. Not to mention it‚Äôs very old, and the room wasn‚Äôt even cleaned when we arrived after two o‚Äôclock! Check in was very slow, so let it go. However, we had to check out after staying for two nights because we had to go to the tourist attractions to discuss whether we could check out a little later. We refused! Hahaha.
2. There is a charge for the Yibao mineral water next to the kettle in the room! Attention everyone! The price tag is very small, but a water bottle is placed next to it to guide you to drink. The mini bottles of water provided by the hotel were placed in the toilet, which was intoxicating.
3. An envelope was lost in the room with documents inside. I called at five o'clock that day and said that the housekeeping depar**ent was off work... I called at nine o'clock the next day and immediately said that I had not seen it. Then I asked them to please wait until the current tenant checked out to check. They responded to me at 10:30, saying that they had checked carefully after the tenant checked out, and there was no such thing!
Friends who want to stay here can refer to it.

msg:The large-scale comprehensive hotel with the background of state-owned enterprises is indeed very comprehensive in decoration and facilities, and the parent-child themed rooms are also beautifully furnished, which children like very much.
But there are indeed many problems. First, the bedside table in the room is not against the wall, so you can see scattered wires and uncleaned garbage; the socket in the second room is very thoughtful and has a panel to prevent children from inserting it by mistake, but the socket is too loose. , the charger plug is not inserted tightly at all, and it often cannot be charged normally; the third is the buffet at night, which is really not like the style of a five-star hotel. The shellfish in the hot pot is almost always empty.
To sum up: the overall facilities and decoration of the hotel are quite old, but the hotel as a state-owned enterprise background is quite satisfactory; the children's theme room is very carefully arranged, and the corridors of the rooms are decorated with different themed patterns with small mosaics; the service aspect is the biggest problem, this It may have something to do with the environment of large industries in recent years, and there may also be factors from the background of state-owned enterprises. Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio of this package is average. If it is not for the National Day holiday, I feel that it is worth six or seven hundred at most. If the buffet dinner can improve the quality and service, I can add another 100.

Fortunately, there is an indoor constant-temperature swimming pool, so basically everyone can play here.
The most dissatisfying thing is that such a large hotel may have hundreds of rooms, but there is only one restaurant in the morning. I queued for more than half an hour to get in. On Saturdays, the restaurant was completely occupied by various banquets and banquets outside, and no dinner service was provided.

Not as good as a fast hotel. And the most amazing thing is that the waiters from the front desk to the amu*****t park to the swimming pool all act like they owe them money. I don‚Äôt know if the wages paid to employees in southern suburbs are too low or something else? Are all the employees so angry? First, there was a person wearing glasses who checked in at the front desk. When I asked her which floor the restaurant was on, she looked impatient. Then the staff at the amu*****t park were even more funny. There were two boxes at the door, one with the words "old kid" and the other with "me". After putting on the grown-up children's socks and chattering for a long time, I was surprised. How can you be so confident if you don't provide socks for adults? There is no sense of service that a five-star hotel should have. Then the waiter at the swimming place was even more funny. I dropped the card and said I hadn't returned it. Later I found out that I had made a mistake. Nanjiao Hotel is really terrible. I have never seen a worse five-star hotel. You guys really don‚Äôt deserve five stars! ! !

The main reason is to fancy the unique pumpkin carriage suite here, with two beds and two bedrooms + balcony. The other parent-child rooms in the corridor are also very beautiful.
The two little princesses were very satisfied. They jumped and climbed on the bed and fell asleep alone at night. The parents went to the big square bed next door, and the bathroom had a shower and a bathtub, all of which were pink and tender.
Each room can also go to the water park in the hotel once, which is only open in July and August. Children especially look forward to the big bucket, the moment it is poured, there is also an indoor standard swimming pool and a not too big children's playground, with trampolines and role-playing ocean balls.
There were more people in line for breakfast the next day, so you had to find your own seat and wait. The service was full, and the plush doll and yogurt were also sent. It's too hot outside this summer, I really regret taking too few photos.

The water park is still ok, better than the indoor children's park, but there are not as many facilities as the children's park. I think these two projects can actually only let the children in, there are staff to look after the children, and the children are not allowed to come out unless the parents come to pick them up. Now these two projects require parents to watch the whole process, and they must not be idle for a moment, purely to play with the children. , very tiring.
        Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the buffet. The price is not expensive, but the quality is very poor. I would rather double the price. I also hope that the crayfish, salmon and lamb skewers in my mouth are fresh, and these are also available in limited quantities. How limited? The method is to make a batch every 30 minutes to 1 hour, and it will be gone after robbing, and it will not be served again. It will take a long time, and it is very stale. The breakfast was even worse, there was a long, long line, and even the dishes were not cleaned.
        In general, I think the price is very uneconomical. Its selling point and concept are very attractive to families with children, but in practice, parents still can't get a rest, they have to accompany them all the time, and they have to worry about these dirty things. Xi's environment. Very not worth the experience.

The decoration of the hotel is not old, but the style is not new. However, the space of the parent-child room was built with care, and the shiny room was very nice and clean. Babies under the age of 6 in the water park may find it too noisy and a bit scary, because it is true that there is a lot of water flow and it is recommended to turn off a few water sprays. Both breakfast and dinner are buffets and the price is in line with the price. The taste is indeed average, but it is better to take the baby to the hotel to solve the problem. For business dinner, you can try the Chinese restaurant on the first floor.
The service staff are very good, and there are many people who go in the middle of the week. The service is better than expected. After all, the state-run harmony will do.

1. The waiter at the entrance to the water park had a very bad attitude. I just took my children to play in the indoor swimming pool for a while. He said fiercely that if I go out and come back in, I will be charged. I said we only went to the indoor swimming pool for 10 minutes. He said it was written on the ticket. It‚Äôs very clear that you can‚Äôt come in when you go out. If I say I‚Äôm a hotel guest, who will read what‚Äôs written on the ticket seriously? Finally he let me in like I owed him money

2 In addition to small bottles of mineral water, the room is also equipped with two bottles of Nestl√© 1.5L water. The average price on Taobao is 3 yuan a bottle. I defaulted to free. After all, it is not Evian or other imported mineral water. However, the hotel gave it to me after check-out. There is a charge for mineral water on the phone. I was charged 44 yuan for a bottle of mineral water. This is really baffling. Is this water placed there to deceive people? Haha, please don‚Äôt use this big bottle of water.

There are all the necessary children's playground facilities, such as slides, ocean balls, building blocks, trampolines, etc. In addition, the outdoor water park next to the swimming pool has also specially built a sunshade, so there is no need to worry about the child's tender skin getting sunburned. The hotel has been very thoughtful. The buffets are also good, with a lot of variety, but the turnover of "good things" for dinner is relatively slow. If you happen to meet a few poor families, then you don't want to eat them.

The only thing I didn't like was the two bottles of mineral water next to the electric kettle. I always thought it was free water at first. I took a closer look at Nestle Premium Living, which is priced at 3.5 yuan, and it's priced at 22 yuan. The key is easy to drink unclearly. Finally, it is recommended to strengthen the cleaning of the carpet in the room, as soon as you enter the room, you can see stains, hair and so on. . .

There is a shed and it is not hot or dry at all. The temperature of the swimming pool is slightly lower. The management is OK. The 4-year-old child needs to go to the toilet because he can't take off his swimsuit. On the side, the waiter stopped him and found a male staff member to take the children to the male guest, and praised one. Children's Paradise does have a musty smell, but it has everything it should have. When there are a lot of people for breakfast, you need to queue up, there are many things, and the taste is flawless. Overall, it's worth bringing the kids to play

Pumpkin carriage house baby is still very happy. Because of the epidemic, the children's park has not opened indoor swimming pools and outdoor water parks, only the chess and card room is open (you can taste it carefully), and the Chinese restaurants are filled with middle-aged people who come and go. Therefore, the parent-child hotel is indeed a bit reluctant, and it can only be said that the object of reception should be more official. There are two points worth complaining about:
1) The air conditioner is not turned on in the buffet breakfast room. If it is inconvenient to open it during the epidemic, then you can‚Äôt open the window, and you have to call a few waiters every morning to open it... But the taste and dishes of the restaurant are still worthy of recognition.
2) 1.6K+ one night price, after checking out, go downstairs to drive and get ready to go. Suddenly I received a call asking if I had "see" the laundry bag in the room... Let me go up and check again, my God, you only have it in the hotel Laundry service? Is it appropriate to question the guest like this for a plastic bag?

The takeout I ordered was taken away. I was half hungry. I asked to adjust the monitoring. The two old aunts at the door were very cold and said that the takeout was lost. They don't care! ? ? ? ? Hahaha, I finally got mad and moved to a suite. The area was very large, but the equipment was very old. The TV in the living room was broken, the toilet exhaust fan had a baffle open, and the corners of all tables and coffee tables were sharp. , the adult also hit a hole in his leg, bleeding a lot... The children's playground is in B1, it is very dirty, has a musty smell, the slide is sticky and difficult to slide down, and I was really tired in the end.

Some underground garages claim that they are not allowed to be used due to epidemic control, and cars are parked on the ground in the bright sun. The restaurant doesn't have much service other than closing tables, and it just feels like a mess. The water park is closed, and other children's facilities are only at kindergarten level. In short, it is the price of a luxury hotel and the experience of a four- or five-star business hotel.

A small bottle of mineral water is free without a label. Naturally, normal people think that unlabeled Coke Sprite is also free. As a result, when the deposit is refunded, 15 yuan is directly deducted for a bottle of Coke. Isn't this obviously deceiving consumers? The customer service at the front desk said, "I also think it's unreasonable not to put a label on it, but there's no way, I'll deduct your money" , then the hotel is still doing this even though it knows it is unreasonable, and the room rate is almost 1k. I believe that all the guests can't afford the 2.5 Coke outside you. You sell it for 15 yuan, but this feeling of being deceived really makes people feel disgusting ü§¢

msg:Nanjiao Hotel is a long-established hotel. We saw a children's water park in the promotion, so we booked the hotel.
After checking in, we went swimming first. While swimming, my husband suddenly started to sink in the deep water area and he was struggling.
I didn't realize there was anything wrong at first, but soon I realized something was wrong with him.
I stood at the junction of shallow water and deep water and shouted desperately for help to the lifeguard standing nearby.
But the lifeguard was obviously distracted and looking elsewhere.
There are only three people in this deep water area, right in front of him
But it took a while for the lifeguard to react. He picked up the lifebuoy and hesitated for a few times but did not throw it out.
No rescue response was made
Fortunately, with the help of my children, my husband struggled until he was close to the shallow water and finally got up.
We are no longer in the mood for a vacation
After we went out, I reported the situation to the swimming team and asked to see the surveillance video.
Manager Zhang, who is in charge of swimming, came out to deal with it.
At first she said she would go to the security room to check the video and then give it to me
I request to view together
She was very impatient with my attitude
The security office said they couldn‚Äôt let me see it. If they didn‚Äôt let me see it, they would call the police.
The police will show me when they come
Informed the approximate time of the incident, but the security room was never found.
The lifeguard here also came out and said it was about 11:02
Still can't find the security room
If I call the police, the police will let me go in to check and tell you which area you are in and what time you are.
If you can't find it and won't let me go, I'll call the police.
Only then did Manager Zhang agree to take me and the lifeguard to the security room.
When we arrived at the door of the security room, the lifeguard and I were blocked from entering.
Manager Zhang and the lifeguard team went in first
It took a while before they came out
After coming out
The first words of the lifeguard: "Just a few seconds!"
Me: "Drowning only takes a few seconds!"
Manager Zhang took a look and said, "I think he swims very well. I thought he was playing in the water."
This is what the manager of a big-name hotel said
Me: "I hope your family will encounter this situation. Everyone will think that he/she is drowning, and no one will save him/her. As an ordinary person, I feel something is wrong. What do you professional lifeguards do?"
Manager Zhang: "Isn't your husband okay now?"
Me: "If something happens, I will call the police as soon as possible and won't come to you!"
Manager Zhang: "Then what do you want? Your husband is fine now!"
This is the quality of management and management personnel of a big-name hotel
We went on vacation and were not frightened. We were swimming in the hotel. If we encounter a situation, we hope to get help as soon as possible.
Also, when they were checking the surveillance records inside,
The lifeguard said that he did not throw out the lifebuoy in the end because he was evaluating whether to rescue me because he felt that my husband was about to stand up.
I would like to ask if a hotel guest encounters a problem while swimming. First, the lifeguard is distracted and does not see the situation in the area. When he sees it, he still needs to make an assessment. Shouldn't he take rescue action as soon as possible?
And what the manager and others said after watching the video, I think the so-called manager Zhang is not here to solve the problem, but just shirking responsibility.
I called the police
When the police came, they said they couldn't judge the video.

He asked me to contact the Arts and Sciences Depar**ent (homophone, I don‚Äôt know the specific depar**ent). If I want an appraisal, I should call the relevant depar**ent.
I don't know if I can make a judgment on this.
But I request that all videos should not be deleted before the problem is solved, and should be saved separately.
The police said they can ask the other party to do this
After the police left, the managers felt that even the police came and did not speak for me.
He ignored me at all and felt that the matter was over.
When I returned to the hotel room, I contacted Ctrip as soon as possible.
After hearing this, Ctrip customer service felt that he could help me contact the hotel to confirm the video and coordinate with the relevant hotel depar**ents.
He also told me that he would contact me again before getting off work today to inquire about the outcome of the negotiation between the hotel and me, and he would give me a result.
Regardless of the outcome, I am very grateful to Ctrip for being very fair and helping to solve the problem!
We originally had lunch at the hotel and went to the hotel's water park in the afternoon.
But by now we were not in the mood, so we ordered takeout
When I came back from the takeout, I walked out of the elevator and a woman walked towards me. She tentatively asked me if I was XXX. I say yes.
She said that the hotel was here to coordinate with me what happened in the swimming pool today.
The reason I came late was because the manager of the swimming depar**ent told her about it after we left, but they didn't know whether I was a guest or whether I was leaving. I don‚Äôt know where I live, I‚Äôm checking the surveillance. Then Ctrip contacted us to find out which room we were staying in.
We didn't have time to eat
Let her come in and talk
In the end there is no conclusion
Just say that I just came over and gave you a fruit plate to express my condolences.
I said no, I‚Äôve already ordered takeout for lunch and fruit.
At the end, I asked if there is nothing else, let‚Äôs stop here.
She said she came here to change us to a suite.
But my husband has taken a break
Everything has been scattered
We were only staying one night and didn't need the suite.
In the evening, I received a call from Ctrip
The Ctrip staff was very polite and said that they would contact the hotel later to learn about the situation.
Then Ctrip will separately provide some compensation and say that if I need to complain to the relevant depar**ents in the future, if Ctrip needs assistance, they will definitely provide full assistance.
Throughout this matter, I am very grateful to Ctrip for its friendly communication and full assistance.
In addition, I would like to warn everyone to avoid this hotel, especially those who want to go swimming. The lifeguards are useless. They do not proactively solve problems when encountering them. Instead, they shirk their responsibilities. Guests staying in the hotel will be happy for themselves!

msg:One of the most dissatisfying hotels I have stayed at recently...
The check-in staff in the hotel lobby was relatively okay, but the rest of the service was not at all good.
Before the transformation, when it was still a business hotel, I often came to this Nanjiao Hotel. The experience was good at that time. I remember that there was a place to have breakfast and a big platform to go out. This time, because of the water park, I became a new Internet celebrity, bringing me Come and experience it with your children.
The rooms have all been renovated, but from the room service to the breakfast and catering service staff, to the management staff in the swimming pool, and the staff in the children's paradise, there is no sense of language arts and service at all. It is obvious that the training is not in place.
Since you are taking the parent-child route, you must keep up with the service. I accidentally forgot to bring my room card twice. When I went to get a replacement the last time, the front desk staff directly said: You already have three cards, don't lose them, they cost 20 yuan each. Even if I have to say this, I should say it properly... And the swimming pool staff are in a hurry to get off work at 8:45 and shout out to drive away all the swimmers...
It doesn‚Äôt matter if there are too many people, it‚Äôs normal during the summer vacation...the service is not good... Nowadays, the competition among parent-child hotels is fierce... If there is no water park, who will come...

The only thing that needs to be said is that there was an error in the check-out of the hotel, and the consumption of the minibar was overestimated, and the way of handling it afterwards was not perfect. In fact, there is really no need to check the minibar these days.

msg:We booked a Crazy Zoo themed parent-child room, and it was already past 10pm when we arrived at the hotel. The service attitude of the lady at the front desk made me feel comfortable, but when I got to the room, it was different, one by one. The first uncomfortable point: I wanted to boil some water and found that there was a lot of tea stains in the kettle. I had to replace it twice and brought a kettle with a lot of tea stains. I asked the waiter if there was a cleaner one, and the answer was that it would have to be wiped to remove it. , since it can be wiped off, why not wipe it off when cleaning the guest room? After taking it and wiping it for a few minutes, the one I took was indeed relatively clean. The second uncomfortable point: when I was preparing to go to bed, I pulled the curtains and found a small spider (picture attached). I didn't bother the room attendant. After all, it was very late, so I took care of it myself. The third uncomfortable point: We went out for breakfast at 9:30 the next morning. After breakfast, we went to the children's paradise. When we returned to the room at 11 o'clock, we found that the room had been cleaned. We neither extended our stay nor checked out, nor did we ask for room cleaning. How could he come into our room without consent and throw a bag on the table with the things he just bought. Although there are no bad intentions, is this kind of operation process done without training? This kind of room management is really worrying
Finally, I would like to praise the little brother at the swimming pool. He helped find and send back the things that were left in the children's playground.

msg:This is really an excellent parent-child hotel in Shanghai that has been delayed by its name! The epidemic can't go out of Shanghai, I can only travel in the suburbs, I found this hotel by accident, it is listed as a five-star hotel, the hotel is big, and I was especially attracted by their pumpkin house! Even though there are boys in the family, it is decided without hesitation! The overall decoration of the hotel has a sense of age. The doormen at the door are all ladies with distinctive features, but I am very embarrassed to ask them to help with luggage. As soon as I entered the room, I was guided by the person in charge of the lobby to check in in front of the self-service machine. It was convenient and fast. No wonder there was no queue at the front desk during the Spring Festival. It seems that the self-made equipment was fully utilized. The pumpkin room has 2 suites, with two bathrooms, one is a shower and the other is a bathtub. The room is polygonal with several windows and large balconies. It is very freehand, and the overall is very pink and dreamy. What is impressive is the children's playground. It is rare to have such a large children's playground inside the hotel. Even the children's toilets are large and well equipped. Just like everyone mentioned, maybe in the ba*****t, the toilet stinks and the whole children's playground is filled with stench! There is also an outdoor children's paddling pool, and I plan to have the opportunity to experience it in summer! The buildings we live in are all parent-child themed rooms, which are quite childlike and unique, and are suitable for three generations to live in. It is really a rare real parent-child hotel on the beach! Next to the hotel is the canal, there are scenic walks, and the scenery is pleasant! There is Suning Life Plaza within a ten-minute walk, as well as a business district to be opened by the newspaper group, and Bailian is a little further away, and a free bubble park is convenient for strolling children a kilometer or two away!
There are also shortcomings: the breakfast is mediocre, the person in charge of the room service in a suit feels ordinary and cares about it, and when I encounter problems, I finally ask the person in charge of the lobby who took me to check in to help solve it, very professional, thank you! Hope the hotel can do better and better!

msg:Check-in queue, even if there is a self-service machine next to it, there is no guidance from the front desk staff.
After checking in, I asked the front desk how to use the parking QR code, whether it was repeated many times, and got a simple answer. As a result, if you encounter problems when you go out twice, you need to scan the QR code once when you go out, otherwise you will need to pay the parking fee indefinitely. This is very important for friends who want to go out, otherwise you will pay obediently at the door of the hotel, and the security will not help you contact the staff, even if the QR code says it is valid within 48 hours.
The shower head in the theme room cannot be fixed, and the water flow is small
The bedding in the master bedroom is smelly, the cleaning is not in place, the pillow is too soft, and the cervical spine is very uncomfortable.
In the water park, there are parents who are dignified in wearing slippers and playing with their children. They walk around in the pool to take pictures and play. They do not change their clothes to take a bath, nor wear a swimming cap. The staff stood by and did not stop them.
The buffet was crowded and chaotic in the morning. Many dishes were not served on the table in time and left empty. The steamed buns were very far away, and the table was too greasy to be taken. After calling the staff several times, there was no one to help. Get closer.
The most excessive and biggest problem is drinking fermented soymilk, a whole cup of liquid in the form of bean curd residue. No one came to solve the problem in time after asking the staff. It was simply explained that the tofu brain was mistakenly put into the soymilk bucket. No follow-up solution after that. It took 20 minutes after the family members repeatedly called the hotel to complain and the restaurant manager arrived at the scene to understand the situation. Finally, we left the hotel with a bad mood.

Eat: The breakfast in the morning was okay, but the buffet in the evening was very average, without much content. The salmon disappeared almost as soon as it was served, and the dish delivery speed was also slow. It was still okay to eat casually.
Service: The service level of the hotel is uneven. The security guard at the entrance and the cleaning lady in the corridor are quite polite. For our two children, if we ask for an extra set of bathrobes, they will be delivered quickly. However, we are not happy to call customer service and ask for an extra small pillow for the child. It means that a room only has one small pillow, nothing extra. No matter what I say, they won't give it away. It's strange. Nowadays, aren't there three children allowed? There must be at least 2 pillows for children in the room. It's impossible for there to be no extra pillows in the hotel! Really bad review!

Service: The front desk service is okay, but the service in the Chinese restaurant in Area A on the first floor cannot be complimented. I ate three times in the two days I stayed at the hotel. Every time I went to the Chinese restaurant on the first floor, the waiter not only did not greet me, but looked at me with a very strange look. I, it seemed like I shouldn't come over to eat, so I asked them how I was going to eat and where I was going to eat. They still didn't take me with me, so they asked me to ask again and again, and they reluctantly took me to a large private room with five or six tables inside. On the last day at 1 o'clock at noon, I went to a Chinese restaurant to eat. The waiter said there were no seats. I said no, there are so many people at 1 o'clock? The waiter said that we are so busy every day, which made me laugh. I had eaten a few times before and found that the entire Chinese restaurant was empty. Then I ignored them and told me to go in and take a look. When I came to the large private room, I found an empty table that had not been cleared away. People at two tables had finished eating and were about to leave. In this case, the normal waiter would ask the guests to wait. Just clear the table, but your waiter is very reluctant to let me eat. It seems that he is unwilling to clear the table. This shows that there is something wrong with the hotel's incentive mechanism. The waiter has no enthusiasm for doing business at all.

msg:On the 33rd birthday, I brought my baby to the hotel for vacation. I booked a small yellow person parent-child theme room with a large balcony and a beautiful night view. There is a children's playground on the second floor, which is very suitable for taking a baby on vacation.

Especially this kind of non-holiday, the price is really high, the breakfast variety is very rich, the taste is also very good, even when losing weight, I still tasted a lot of snacks, they are more delicious, I like fresh tofu nao, it is cold in winter A bowl is super comfortable. The children ate noodles and noodles and they all liked them.
The residence is also very clean and comfortable.
Photos are all original phone pictures
The hotel also sent me a birthday greeting card and a fruit plate specially for me. It was very considerate and deserved to be a five-star hotel.
Come to walk the baby again next time~

The rooms are clean, small in size and no bathtub. The swimming pool water is clearer and the water temperature is cooler. Whether it is a hotel or a room, there are few parent-child facilities, so children are not interested. The breakfast can only take care of the fullness, the variety is small, and the quality is average. The afternoon tea in the executive room is too perfunctory.

Neat and clean without odor

At first glance, it felt very tall. We checked in very quickly. When we saw the children‚Äôs front desk, they would give a doll. We chose a Frozen themed room on the 3rd floor. After the elevator went out, the theme of Captain America was first. Walking inside is Frozen. The room is not big and it is clean. The curtains and toilet are electric. The room has a balcony. It is a pity that our balcony is on the roof and the view is not good. If it is a high-rise building, you should be able to see the canal. , We put our luggage and plan to go for a stroll. We only found out when we reached the 1st floor. In fact, the front desk and the gate are on the 2nd floor.

Play:
There is a Shanghai Fish around the hotel. You can walk along the riverside of the hotel. The Shanghai Fish is a big ecological park. Inside it is a bubble park with many amu*****t facilities and more children. We just walked around and walked around. , The environment is very good

eat:
There are many different kinds of hotel buffet, whether it is dinner or breakfast, I am very satisfied. There is a square opposite the hotel and there is not much food to eat. There is also a family supermarket.

During the epidemic, the Nanjiao Hotel is a choice for traveling with children. This time it happened to be in full bloom with sweet-scented osmanthus. The densely packed osmanthus and silver osmanthus on both sides of the road are fragrant and fragrant, and the mood is extremely happy.

The swimming pool is large and comfortable, but it's a pity that it's not summer and we can't enjoy the outdoor play pool. The musty smell of the children's playground is too strong, probably because it cannot be improved for the same reason as the water park. There is a wet unknown liquid in the ball pool that wets the children's socks. The most unbearable and off-putting thing was the breakfast buffet staff in the Sunshine Hall who kept picking their noses! right! That‚Äôs you! The person standing at the omelette, the mask hanging on your chin, when the customer came to ask where the food was, you kept picking at it, switching sides! Extremely disgusting! Even the children were asking why the uncle kept picking his nose when he helped others cook and pick up the noodles without wearing gloves! Turns off the appetite! It can be seen that the old hotel is thinking of ways to update the hardware and improve the service, but it was completely ruined by the restaurant people! Don‚Äôt dare to come again!

Known as a five-star hotel, except that the hotel looks grand on the outside, once inside, it is actually a fast hotel with a theme layout, especially the service facilities are very poor. The overall feeling is: a small-minded five-star hotel. 1. A small bottle of free water is provided in the room. It is a brand that has never been seen on the market and the taste is not good. The paid mineral water is Nestl√©, but it costs 22 yuan a bottle. 2. The buffet restaurant is terrible both for breakfast and dinner. There are too many complaints. This is the first time I see that there is no coffee machine in the cafeteria of a five-star hotel. The small hot pot for the buffet dinner uses spliced ‚Äã‚Äãmeat, which is out of supply, with only 6 slices per serving. The teppanyaki stall is always empty. I only saw uncooked chicken tenders once, but I never got them. They are basically not replenished before 7 o'clock. The sashimi stall looks messy, the sushi is the cheapest kind with some fillings in the middle of the rice. The fruits are all cheap, and the sour pineapples and watermelons are also thick-skinned. The breakfast buffet has no bacon, sausages, fries, and very little variety. The swimming pool and gym are small, and the children's playground is suitable for little ones. Nanjiao Hotel is completely in the name of parent-child, using the simplest room layout to make money for childrenüí∞.
The first time I stayed at a five-star hotel, I was disappointed. I won‚Äôt stay in this hotel again. It‚Äôs not worth it.

I immediately opened the window to ventilate and went out. When I came back, it was a little better, but there was still a smell. I had no choice but to fall asleep reluctantly. After getting up, I was bitten by insects several times. If you look carefully, it is not a mosquito. The bite of the insect is visible to the naked eye. There are also good points: the outdoor swimming pool is closed at this time, and only the indoor ones are available, which is not bad. The staff are very friendly and nice. The water in the shower is very large and the temperature is stable. Bathing is very comfortable. But I belong to a person with a good sense of smell, and I feel sick all over if there is a slight odor. The children's paradise also has a great smell, and I dare not take my children there. I don't know because Fengxian is near the sea, so the musty smell is so heavy?

msg:Because of the epidemic situation, I saw that there is a water park in the comments, so I thought about bringing the children to stay for one night. When I booked there were only more than 1,300 suites, I thought about it, and the baby was happy. I arrived at the hotel at 10:30. I originally wanted to have a meal nearby and store my luggage first. I didn't expect to inform the room that I could go in. This was surprisingly happy. The room was arranged on the 4th floor. As soon as I entered, there was a pungent smell of wood similar to the decoration. After opening the window, I went to the lobby and talked to the front desk clerk who just checked in. The clerk said that our hotel has been open for a long time. It smells of decoration. I said it does. I‚Äôm going out to eat now. Let‚Äôs ventilate first. If I don‚Äôt have it when I come back, I have to change the taste. The front desk said yes.
I didn‚Äôt return to the hotel room after 1 o‚Äôclock and I still felt a pungent smell. I went back to the lobby and wanted to change the room. It was the peak time for check-in. The front desk was full of people, so I went to the check-out place. Ask, there was a Mr. Hu at the time (I didn‚Äôt remember his full name, it seems to be Hu Xtao). I told about my situation. He said that the room may have been refurbished and repaired before, so it smells like (I don‚Äôt know why The front desk clerk who checked in before and I categorically said that there was no renovation). Mr. Hu said that he could help me. He changed my room on the same floor and asked someone to take me to take a look. But there may still be a thorn in the relationship between the renovation of the same floor. The nose smells. Mr. Hu changed me to the 7th floor of another district. This time it finally didn‚Äôt taste. I would like to thank Mr. Hu and the little brother who took me to the room twice and finally helped me carry the bag. I didn‚Äôt ask him. By name, I only know that the 17-year-old intern is from Sichuan. After returning to the room, I found that there was hair on the sofa (Figure 1). Okay, think about it as a trouble for the hotel to change rooms, just forget it.
Then the next series of experiences are even more exciting, really not worth more than 1,300. It‚Äôs been more than two o‚Äôclock after I changed my room. I went to the recreation center and wanted to go to the water park. When I entered the front desk to check the tickets, I reported the room number and asked for a locker box. I probably didn‚Äôt hear what the other party said, so I asked more. Hehe, to answer my attitude, hey, I originally asked for a female changing box, think about it, I still want a male changing box, and then I ask them if they don't want it. Okay, when I arrived at the water park, I realized that you have to wear a swimming cap when you enter the water. I said that the adults don‚Äôt have one. The two brothers were very impatient and said that they would not buy it or they would not be able to enter. that is. There are only two or three small slides in this water park, nothing else, but the water is dirty, there are a lot of floating objects (Picture 2 and Picture 3), and Bundy, who has been found on the water, I really regret not taking it. I was ready to go out. The front desk saw me asking for the key to the box. I said I want to get the shoes, because when I came in, I sent the shoes with the key first. Then he gave me a piece of paper and told me to open the shoe box with the QR code. I wondered how I knew the difference between going in and out.
I went to the buffet at night, and when I twisted the egg and opened it, there was a mosquito (Picture 4). How did this seal get in? Well, I can‚Äôt blame the restaurant when I think about it, but there are many small flying insects during the meal. They say that they can‚Äôt pick up the meal at 8:30, but they have already started to clean up after 8:11. Food, there was already an aunt at around 8:25 in a hurry to clean up our table while we were still eating. When I returned to the room, I asked for children‚Äôs slippers when I called. The aunt who sent me opened the door and slammed in front of me without any words or facial expressions.
The next morning, I went to eat at more than 9 o‚Äôclock. I thought it was late because the restaurant said it was the peak before 9 o‚Äôclock, but I didn‚Äôt expect that there would still be long queues. What‚Äôs even more annoying was that the breakfast buffet was served and there were no cups and bowls in the back. How to get food?
To be honest, the first time a hotel evaluates so many words, maybe some of the problems are small, and maybe some of the problems don‚Äôt seem to be a big problem, but so many small problems make me think it‚Äôs a big problem. I don‚Äôt need what the hotel does. Can't help but write some real feelings. l

It is a family hotel, but the bedside tables in the room still have metal bars. As a result, the child fell and hit his head. His head was bleeding and he needed 10 stitches! The imported anti-expansion device costs 1,800, which is three times the price of your hotel! Although the hotel staff accompanied me to Fengxian Hospital, no cosmetic line would leave scars. I checked out directly in the evening and contacted the hotel afterwards to negotiate the check-out fee. The hotel room was surprisingly tough. If you don‚Äôt retreat, you won‚Äôt retreat.

This time, because my son loves cars, I booked a car-themed room very early and booked two rooms for traveling with my family. Then the nigh**are came. 1. The hygienic condition of the hotel is poor. I stayed for one night and played in the B1 children's playground. The air was very bad, the children's facilities were dirty, and there were fleas. After playing with the children for a while today, the bites on my body were all messed up and it was extremely itchy. Tolerate. Photos are only part of it. 2. The current epidemic prevention measures are poor. Wearing a mask is not required during the buffet breakfast and dinner. We even saw people sneezing and coughing. It is so aboveboard. If there is a case, everyone will suffer. I don‚Äôt know how the hotel will manage it. 3. The hotel buffet does not have a five-star standard. Everything was gone before the time was up. The crayfish was only enough for three people, and it was all taken out at once. Replenishment was slow. To sum up, this is the most disappointing hotel I have ever stayed in. It focuses on families and children and should pay more attention to hygiene and improve the standards so that everyone can stay with peace of mind.

The Nanjiao Hotel is large in size, and it looks like a castle from a distance. The staff is enthusiastic and serious. I noted in advance that I wanted to stay on the same floor with my friends, and it was arranged in two rooms next door. The pumpkin carriage house simply satisfies all the fantasies of the girl's little girl, and the pink room makes the children reluctant to think about it. The rooms are very clean and large in size. Although the water park downstairs is not big, the children still have fun. The downside is that half of the swimming pool is rented to training institutions. In addition, there are many hotel guests during the summer vacation, and the swimming pool is a bit crowded.

When they came to the hotel, they were shocked, and the lobby was full of people. Check-in is also very slow. I waited for nearly an hour. I originally booked a parent-child room to check in on the self-service machine, but the itinerary code was blocked, so I had to go back and line up again. The lobby manager was pretty good and came over frequently to say hello.
The hotel has its own water park, and the children have fun to death.
The breakfast is quite satisfactory, both Chinese and Western, and the replenishment is very diligent.
In general, I had a good stay and had fun. The children said that they would come to live next time and change to a different theme room.

It wasn't that the bed was small, but that it was inexplicably uncomfortable. If I didn't use a pillow, I felt like my head was low and my feet were high. Moreover, it was very dry without the air conditioning. When I woke up in the morning, my lower back hurt as if it was broken.
The breakfast variety was mediocre, the quality was not great, and the sausage slices were dry and hard. The spoon and chopsticks were placed directly on the table placemat, and the spoon had a fishy smell. After the previous customer finished eating, the waiter simply wiped the table mat and put new chopsticks and spoons directly on it. It was so unhygienic.
I still woke up several times the second night, and my waist hurt again in the morning. The father also had the same symptoms. He said the bed was too hard.
The water temperature of the swimming pool is very good, but the diving is too deep. There is a 2-meter deep water area in the 25-meter pool. The bath towel could not cover the thighs of a child as young as 7 years old, the fabric was poor, and the toiletries were very thin.
The price of 1,500‚ûï per night during the Spring Festival is equivalent to staying in a hotel with less than 4 stars. I will never go there again. These parent-child rooms are just for parents to coax their children.

In the current epidemic, where is the food safety and hygiene at all! The customer experience is extremely poor!
Taking the room price of more than 1,000 in Fengxian area, there is no cost-effectiveness. There are many major hotels in Shanghai with such themed rooms. I will not come again next time!

msg:The hotel is older, mainly for parents and children. The decoration of the room is very Q. The children still like it. The children‚Äôs playground is also very large, but on the second floor, it may be downstairs by the swimming pool, so the children‚Äôs playground has a musty smell and is uncomfortable ~ indoor There are a lot of people swimming in the pool. When we went to swim, there seemed to be a coach teaching swimming, but this is the hotel where I have seen the most lifeguards by the pool, and it is also very responsible. When the children go near the deep water, they will immediately blow their whistle. Reminder, the impression is very good! Breakfast is very general, budget hotel configuration, in the beverage area, directly put the big bottle of orange fruit and Coca-Cola outside~ the hotel staff are very kind~ the attitude is very good!

msg:The set hotel plus buffet dinner set for two persons is less than 700, and it can be used on the 13th of the Dragon Boat Festival. It is too cost-effective. Book now. The room is Captain America‚Äôs parent-child room. The bed is one big and the other is small. The bed sheets are Ferrari motifs. When I first entered, I felt colorful. After staying for a long time, I felt too greasy, especially the toilet with golden rim and glass decoration. The hotel‚Äôs children‚Äôs park is quite big, even if the children in elementary school are still having fun, the cost of the crane machine cost 40 yuan to the little bunny. The water park has not yet opened, and there will be more if the summer vacation is over. The dinner buffet is about the same price and not as rich as the Ofuna Hotel, but there is a cold dish and crab claws that are delicious. We bought it as a set meal, so I feel that the price-performance ratio is much more than that of the boat. The breakfast in the southern suburbs is very average, with too little food and it's not delicious. There is a sheep farm near the hotel, it is delicious, you can go.

It is at the high-speed entrance and the two business districts of Bailian and Suning can solve most of the problems of eating, drinking and playing. Although the hotel is a bit old, it has been renovated and all configurations have been fully upgraded. Various parent-child facilities are also relatively complete. The only regret is that the water park has not yet started. Parent-child hotels around Shanghai are worth visiting.

msg:I had a wedding in Fengxian Kaiser Weiting, and I specially stayed at Nanjiao Hotel for one night. The front desk of the hotel was very good, especially Liu Customer Service knew that my family would come to stay for one night the next day, but they booked other parent-child rooms. So arranged for us to live in the same room. Some things do not need to be moved around. Thank you. The hotel is suitable for children, the children‚Äôs park is on the first floor, if the air is better, it would be better. The water feels a bit cold right after the swimming pool, it will be better if you swim for a while. It's even more fun when the water park opens in July. The room attendants are also very nice, telling them that they will try their best to satisfy their needs.

Many so-called six-star resort hotels can‚Äôt do this, although the hotel style is rather old-fashioned , But the hardware is well maintained. But I want to give Ctrip an opinion. During the epidemic, many hotels, especially Shanghai hotels, have executive lounges closed. If you book an executive room, you can‚Äôt enjoy the service of the executive lounge. Shouldn‚Äôt it be reminded on the booking interface? Now the interface still says "Enjoy the trea**ent of the executive lounge". Isn't this a false propaganda?

Although it is a suburb of Shanghai, it is too... I didn‚Äôt go to Pudong because of the epidemic. Apart from calling to ask if there was any fruit, the waiter said there was no fruit. In the end, it was probably the manager who sent a relatively generous piece of fruit, but there really wasn't much else to offer.

Around 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, the room next door chatted loudly after returning to the room, which seriously affected sleep. After complaining, the waiter had no response. He complained again half an hour later and was told that if he didn't handle it, he would call the police. It was already past midnight, and I was completely sleepless.

msg:Due to the epidemic, I was not allowed to leave Shanghai, so I chose the Nanjiao Hotel to celebrate my child‚Äôs birthday. Picture 1 shows the staff who helped us check in. They were friendly and gentle, making us feel like they were in the spring breeze. They also helped comfort my two noisy children. They introduced the hotel facilities in detail and asked me to go to the park first. They would call me immediately after the room was cleaned. I checked in early, and I would like to express my gratitude. The one in picture 2 is a person who claims to be a manager. On the day of the child's birthday, we got up at around 8 o'clock, and the restaurant was overcrowded by 9 o'clock, as most people brought their children to the restaurant. The manager had a bad attitude and said that the restaurant closed at 10:30 and asked everyone to go back to their rooms and not wait in front of the restaurant. We pointed out that the child was so small and already hungry. This was not a service that the hotel should provide, and we wanted to talk to the manager. The person said that he was the highest person in charge, but his attitude was still arrogant, which made people feel unhappy. It's not the first time I've stayed in a hotel, and it's not the first time I've encountered this situation. In the past, I usually asked people to eat in the room after picking up meals. This kind of service happens in Shanghai, which really makes people speechless. I went to the front desk of the hotel to report the situation, but the manager on duty ignored me. As a service industry, it is basic to accept complaints from customers. How to deal with them after investigation is the hotel's internal management. It's unexpected that I don't even have the courage to accept customer complaints. I guess I'm used to it. Ruined a good mood for the day. I wanted to give it no points. But thinking about the staff in Figure 1, I still gave it a three-pointer. It turns out that we have also seen dissatisfaction with the service in related restaurants. We are not very demanding and we can eat whatever we want, but this kind of thing still happens. Finally, everyone in line has already had their meal at 9:20. What does the manager mean by asking everyone to go back to their rooms? I will not stay at this hotel again. This is the first time I have decided not to stay in a hotel again.
5-star hotels hope that relevant depar**ents will also consider whether the quality of their personnel is in line with 5-star standards.

msg:The hotel is quite satisfactory, the environment can be converted, and the facilities are relatively good. However, the electric toilet cover is flashy. It's quite a big toilet. If you put this cover on it, can you still sit down and go to the toilet? Aren't you afraid of peeing? You have to pay for a mask in a room that's a few hundred dollars bigger, so it's not expensive, but the network at the door is not good, and people are waiting for me to get on the bus. It takes me 7-8 minutes to buy a mask. In fact, the score should be 3 points, but I think that in a place where masks are charged, there will be no relevant personnel to follow up on negative reviews. Therefore, I want to tell everyone to remember to bring some masks when you go out. It‚Äôs not that the things are expensive, it‚Äôs the Internet. It's not good to pay and delay things. Remember.

msg:A very satisfying check-in experience. Everything starts from the check-in at the front desk. Wang Huafeng is very warm and thoughtful. The five-star service starts a pleasant vacation.
The interior of the room is very suitable for children and there is a balcony. The children are very happy.
The children's playground is very fun, there are not many people, and it is very enjoyable to play. There are many staff in the water park and swimming pool, they are well protected, and they feel safe to play. The breakfast is very rich and the service is attentive. All in all, a very cost-effective hotel with great service. I will recommend it to friends who need to walk their babies
