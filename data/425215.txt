In terms of guest service, I received a call from Xiaohua as soon as I got off the high-speed rail, and he took the initiative to upgrade us to a children's theme room facing Daming Lake. After checking out, I called again to ask about the experience.
In terms of catering, I originally wanted to take my children to experience the special breakfast, but the hotel's buffet breakfast not only had braised meat, beef soup, and sweet foam, but also the buns were freshly made. The Chinese store and Western pastries are all in good shape, and the pancakes and cakes are delicious. It is particularly worth mentioning that the bacon is crispy, which is a big surprise. Wendy meng in the restaurant is very considerate and asked if I needed to bring some milk snacks for the children to eat while playing. This is an experience I have never had before.
Because I planned to take a cruise to Heihu Spring, I applied to the front desk for a delayed check-out. Before I said the time, the switchboard Xiao Yang took the initiative to delay it for us until 4 pm. Let us pack up our things safely after playing, take a rest and go to the station.
In short, the service of Luneng Guihe InterContinental is absolutely above the standard, and it is no exaggeration to say that it is the world's leading.
The only suggestion: put tissue paper on the washbasin.
Everything else is perfect and dreamy, looking forward to staying next time!

The hotel's service is even more remarkable. First of all, when we checked in, the front desk receptionist Xiao Gao carefully answered our questions and made us feel at home. The next day, we went to the restaurant on the 6th floor for breakfast. The food was very rich (boiled pork and sweet rice). After the meal, the child dropped the handheld electric fan on the table. We didn't notice it. Ms. Meng Jiaqi from the restaurant ran out of the restaurant and gave it to us. Finally, when we checked out, Ms. Wang Lingwei at the front desk enthusiastically asked about our stay experience and took the initiative to provide meticulous service, which made our stay experience perfect. I would like to thank the three service staff of Luneng Guihe InterContinental Hotel again. I will choose InterContinental next time I come to Jinan! !

With Conniey here, we will only choose InterContinental when we come to Jinan! ! ! ! Thank you 3 The location of the hotel is great. You can walk to Baotu Spring and Daming Lake. Next to it is the ancient alley, and there are also large depar**ent stores and luxury goods malls. 4 The breakfast is very rich, and it takes full care of children and the elderly. For breakfast, I saw a guest next to me with a baby. The baby loves bread. The female guest packed some bread in a bag, and bananas, apples, and pears were placed whole. Every guest who finished the meal would take it away, but the service staff would not stop or disturb them. The service of the hotel is so humane and sentimental 👍. 5. Check-in at the front desk was friendly, brief, and fast. There was no nonsense, and there was no household registration-like information check at MGM. It was excellent 👍. 6. The room service was responsive, and the cleaning staff had very high EQ and were enthusiastic (I don't quite understand where the bad reviews of this hotel came from. I am a hotel control freak and have very high requirements for all aspects of my stay. I am a light sleeper and I am particularly concerned about sound insulation. Fortunately, I didn't listen to those comments. In the end, after many rounds of selection, I chose such a good hotel. It was so comfortable to live in. If my baby hadn't gone back to school, I would have stayed for a few more days! I will definitely come again!)

It can be said that every staff member I met when I walked into the hotel door was very enthusiastic and asked me if I needed any help. Manager Connie called me before and after my check-in to ask if I needed help, as well as my check-in experience and feedback.

Everything is good, except for the shower. The shower handle is leaking. Because it was too late and I wanted to rest early, I didn't call someone to repair it.

A high-end hotel brand in the city center, it is a good choice for tourists and morning guests. It is close to Henglong, Shimao, Daming Lake, Baotu Spring, Heihu Spring, Kuanhouli, etc., which saves time and effort for eating, drinking and having fun.
The decoration style of the hotel is quite grand, which I personally like. I live in a south-facing landscape room with floor-to-ceiling windows. The night view of the moat, weeping willows and fountains are all beautiful. The room space and functions are clearly divided, and the stay experience is still very good.

msg:This is the first time I stayed at InterContinental Hotel. Connie, the quality supervision manager, called in advance to help change the family room for free, and checked us in early when the room supply was not very tight, and gave us a "VIP" fruit plate. It is said that the city view room is naturally expected to overlook Quancheng Square, but it turned out to be facing the old city side of Daming Lake, which was a little lost. Connie asked me many times if there were any other requirements, which may be a hint of this, but I was stupid and didn't hear it hahaha.
The overall hotel stay experience is still good. It is very convenient to go to tourist attractions in the city center. It is next to Plaza 66 and the Guihe Shopping Center (the hotel lobby is on the 7th floor). It is also good for strolling and shopping. For the sake of convenience, breakfast and lunch are also eaten in the restaurant on the 6th floor of the hotel. The quality of the food is also acceptable, and the buffet variety is also diverse enough, especially the breakfast, which is quite rich.
The hotel room is very good, but there are still some inconveniences because I brought my child with me. For example, the curtains are not very light-blocking. For example, there is only one master control for the bathroom light. Even if the curtains are drawn, the glass wall still allows light to pass through when I go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Such changes in brightness may affect the sleep of a baby who is a sleeper. I am still very nervous when using a flashlight. If you mind, choose carefully. In addition, there will be the roar of motorcycles on the street in the middle of the night. I personally feel that the sound is not loud enough to disturb others. If you mind, you can refer to it.

The enthusiasm revealed in the bones of Shandong really deepened my impression of Jinan. Finally, the child went to the indoor swimming pool when he checked in that day. The manager and the front desk took great care of my wife and children. Thank you very much. It made me have a better impression of InterContinental. Before I stayed at InterContinental, I only knew that InterContinental had rich meals. After staying there, I was really impressed. Thank you to all the service staff.

Although there are many guests staying in the hotel during the May Day holiday, the staff can respond quickly. The hotel is in a good location, surrounded by business districts, and it is very convenient to eat. It is only a ten-minute walk from Daming Lake and Baotu Spring Scenic Area. You can see Quancheng Square from the room. If I come to Jinan again in the future, I will choose InterContinental.

msg:The location is excellent. You can walk to major attractions such as Kuanhouli Furong Street, Baotu Spring, Daming Lake, etc. It takes 15 minutes to get to Qianfo Mountain by taxi, and 30 minutes to get to Shanbo (if there is no traffic jam). This is also the primary reason why I chose this hotel.
I chose the exclusive king-size bed room, which is very large. The 2.4 bed is made of two single beds. The seamless splicing is not good, and there is a gap in the middle. There is a free mini bar that is replenished every day. The hygiene is also good. Someone will deliver it immediately if you need anything.
I only experienced the hotel breakfast. It was no problem to eat full, but it was not outstanding. After all, the price is not high, so it is neither good nor bad.
The service meets the five-star standard. The waiter will take the initiative to greet you when meeting you. The most noteworthy thing is the hotel parking staff, who are really warm and thoughtful, solving guests' urgent needs. We arrived at 13:30 on May 1st. The underground parking lot was lined up and almost blocked the road. We also took the wrong lane. We happened to see the hotel parking staff. When they heard that we were hotel guests, they helped us turn around, stopped the car, and directed us all the way to the parking space, which made us relax because of the 8-hour traffic jam on May 1st. Remember to register the license plate at the front desk to avoid parking fees. There are many shopping malls around the hotel, various restaurants, and snacks like Kuanhouli, which is very convenient. The hotel also has a swimming pool, but I didn't have time to experience it. There are robots for food delivery. It deserves praise.

The room is spacious, but the inner window room is a bit cramped, it is recommended to choose an outer window as much as possible. I booked two rooms, but they said that the room was tight and could not be arranged together because the distance was far. Overall, the stay was okay. The breakfast was a bit messy, maybe it was close to the May Day holiday and there were many people, so it was noisy.

Environment: The hotel is very good in terms of hygiene.
Service: There will be two little guys standing on the first floor. You can consult at any time. They are reasonable and polite. One time my handbag was broken and I wanted to go back to the room to change my bag. The little guys directly brought me their reusable bags, which was convenient for me. . Check-in is on the 7th floor. Elena and Zoey's service is very good.
Room: Very spacious, the mattress is very comfortable, 4 bottles of water a day, and turndown service, but the aunt will refill it when she sees there is no water, which is very good. If you have any questions, call the front desk and they will be solved quickly, and there will be a return call, which is very efficient.
Breakfast: It is the highlight of their hotel. Many varieties: Chinese, Western. There are also some local Shandong delicacies: meat (with rice), mutton foam, pancake fruit, egg pancakes, Rizhaoqing (tea), spring water tofu (you can season it yourself). Others include steamed eggs, freshly squeezed juices, sushi, stir-fries, etc. By the way, their desserts are very delicious. They are all in the freezer. They are not as ordinary as some hotel breakfast desserts. The coffee can be taken away, and there are takeaway cups. Their coffee machine looks very high-end. Xiao Meng in the breakfast room is very polite and helps guests a lot, which is worthy of praise.

msg:Jinan is the last stop of our trip to Shandong. We chose the Luneng Guihe InterContinental Hotel for accommodation. It turns out that this choice is very wise. First of all, the hotel has a very advantageous geographical location. It is located in the core area of ​​Jinan's most prosperous area. It is quiet in the bustling area. It is about one kilometer away from almost all famous attractions in Jinan. It can be reached in 10-15 minutes on foot. It is very convenient! If you choose a leisure tour, shopping and dining are even better. Supermarkets and restaurants of various grades are nearby.
The hotel has a high-end appearance, complete hardware and software facilities, and high-quality personnel. Therefore, the quality of guests entering the store is also high. The service staff can see that they are all the result of rigorous training. We drove to Jinan by ourselves. When we arrived at the hotel, a ground service staff immediately came forward to ask whether the car was on the ground or in the underground garage, and patiently and carefully told the route to enter the basement. There were two waves of service staff on the road to guide until you entered the parking space in the underground garage, so you will not feel lonely along the way!
The hotel room is over 40 square meters, which is large enough without feeling cramped. The layout is reasonable, and the bathroom is large enough without feeling oppressive. This time it is an interior room, with the interior of the hotel outside the floor-to-ceiling window. It is worth mentioning that the room has good sound insulation, so I can have a good sleep and wash away my fatigue. It was a good stay experience and it will be the best choice next time.

Downstairs is Hang Lung Plaza and World Trade Plaza. It is very convenient for eating, playing and shopping. Thanks to the sister Xiaofa who received us at the front desk. The attitude and service are super good. Seeing that we brought children, she helped us upgrade the room. The room is really big enough. The children are happy and don’t want to leave. The buffet restaurant is also very cost-effective. The little brother with glasses who sells baking on the first floor is also very nice. In short, I will only stay at Luneng InterContinental when I come to Jinan in the future

msg:The high-speed rail time was suitable and I had tickets. I took advantage of the last weekend before May Day to visit Jinan for the first time. I didn't look for hotels until Thursday, and I hesitated between this Guihe InterContinental and Shangri-La. After returning from the Spring City, I concluded that I did not book the wrong hotel this time. The location is very good. It is within walking distance of Qushuiting Street, Daming Lake, Baotu Spring, Heihu Spring, Wulongtan, and Kuanhouli. (Of course, the attractions in Jinan's old city are also concentrated.) The traffic is very congested, and riding a bicycle seems dangerous. Nothing can compare to walking; check When we checked in, there were queues at three front desk locations, which took longer than expected. I thought the service capabilities of this hotel needed to be observed. Later I heard that they all had their own situations. The processing was very smooth and fast for several people including us. Because we preferred twin beds and booked late, the room only had ordinary twin beds. After consulting, the front desk was very good. After checking the room, we were upgraded to a room with a view and given InterContinental Club privileges. The room was very large, with a direct view of Quancheng Square. The mottled marks showed that it was old, but it was generally clean. The fabrics on the sofa and chaise longue made people feel free to sit on them. The noise was amazing. During the day, we could clearly hear the conversation in the next room by the balcony, but at night, the noise disappeared with the curtains drawn. The bed was a little soft at first impression, but the support was sufficient when we woke up in the morning. The quilt was dry and comfortable, and we had a good night's sleep. The hotel's breakfast is great, with a full range of Chinese and Western food, and the quality is good. There are more than 5 kinds of cheese, dumplings, freshly made dumplings, pork belly, sweet foam..., baked fruits and vegetables, and various dishes are constantly added. The peeled fruits are replaced with the containers instead of just pouring new ones in. The waiters are sufficient and have their eyes on work. They remove the dishes in a timely manner without being busy. The courtesy of delayed check-out until 4 o'clock is very friendly to our return high-speed rail evening time. Thank you! I experienced the afternoon tea in the executive corridor. The desserts are delicious and it's good to chat and relax. That's all, but it doesn't arouse my yearning (I ate a lot of desserts and fruits). Next time, I will send it to experience the full set, dinner, cocktails, haha. Choosing Guihe InterContinental is the perfect guarantee for this trip to the Spring City. I will choose to stay again if I have a hot pot in Jinan.

Before check-in, the quality supervision manager Connie communicated by phone to confirm and asked about the check-in requirements attentively, which greatly shortened the check-in time and was very fast.

It was warm and comfortable, and the bed flower shape was very beautiful🌹. I could feel the complete service system of InterContinental. The hardware of the hotel room can be seen to be constantly improving. The sound of the air conditioner in the room is a bit loud. After all, it has been a long time, which is understandable. The hair dryer has a good reputation👍. The children received a small gift for check-in🎁, and they were very happy. Thank you, the beautiful sister at the front desk.

I always stayed in the rooms on the Quancheng Square side. I don't know why I was given such a small room with such a bad view this time. After coordination, I changed to a room that was OK.

I am very satisfied that the bathroom is also equipped with stools for children, which is very convenient for washing. When we checked out the next day, we took a taxi at the door, and Liu Maofu from the security depar**ent also served us thoughtfully.

The room is very large and you can see the panoramic view of Quancheng Square. It is very close to Baotu Spring, Daming Lake and Heihu Spring. It is very convenient for sightseeing and shopping around. The service is also great! Everything is perfect. I recommend staying here!

msg:This time, I was going to Jinan with my six-year-old sister and my younger brother who was less than five months old. So after a thorough investigation, I chose the InterContinental, which is very close to various attractions.
Before the trip, I confirmed with the hotel and installed a child fence in the room. After arriving at the hotel, the hotel receptionist was very enthusiastic to help us deliver our luggage to the room.
First of all, I want to praise the hotel's location. The hotel is opposite the Quancheng Square. It takes 10 to 15 minutes to walk to Baotu Spring and Heihu Spring. Kuanhouli and Daming Lake are not far away. We walked to all our trips in the past few days.
In addition, the hotel can directly reach Guihe Shopping Center, and it takes two minutes to walk to Hang Lung Plaza, which is very convenient for shopping and eating.
Because we brought a baby, when we were dressing the baby in the lobby on the first floor, because the baby kept crying, the handsome Qi Shengyuan at the front desk took the initiative to ask if we needed help. In order to comfort the baby, he also gave a cute little bear doll.
The breakfast is also very rich, with no problem with Chinese and Western food. And every time we eat, they will take the initiative to arrange a quiet place when they see us with our family.
Before checking out on the last day, because my baby had reached bedtime, I asked if I could check out later. The concierge took the initiative to check me out at 2 pm. I give a thumbs up to Miss Minghui from the concierge.

The hotel is in an excellent location, very close to several attractions, and there are all major supermarkets nearby. My favorites are popular snack streets like Furong Street and Kuanhouli, both within a 10-minute walk.
The hotel facilities are well-equipped and suitable for swimming and fitness. I like the view room. Whether it is the view of the square to the south or the view of Daming Lake to the north, it is unique. It would be better if the room could be equipped with a smart toilet.
It is worth mentioning that the hotel's service is very good, absolutely five-star standard. From the front desk to the guest rooms to the lobby cleaning, they are very enthusiastic and professional. The quality supervision manager Connie is even more considerate. She has arranged suitable rooms in advance and is efficient when encountering problems. deal with.

msg:According to the reviews, it is a very high-quality hotel in Jinan. I like it better. It is on Quancheng Road. It is very convenient for eating and shopping in the surrounding areas such as Shimao, Hang Lung and Ginza. If you go to Daming Lake and Baotu Spring, you can reach them by walking, very close. The city center is also very close to where I work, so the location is really hard to say.
The decoration of the hotel is quite satisfactory, and the facilities are well maintained. The hotel rooms are divided into two floors: the inner and outer floors. The inner floor may not feel stuffy because of the skylight in the lobby, but it is very quiet. The facilities in the room are not advanced but they are still in line with five-star standards. It's just that this TV seems a bit small.
The room was cleaned very reassuringly. Although I am not mysophobic, I paid a little attention and everything I saw was quite clean.
Let’s talk about service. I feel that service is the biggest highlight of this hotel. The quality supervision manager Connie gave me a warm welcome even before I arrived. She prepared the room in advance according to the requirements. The check-in front desk was also professional and efficient. The floor attendants and The maintenance staff will take the initiative to say hello to the guests when they see them, which makes them feel very comfortable. Shandong’s reputation for being hospitable is not in vain. Jinan is also a warm city. Next time I come to Jinan, I will still choose Intercontinental!

msg:There’s nothing to say about the hotel’s location and the view from the room. It’s very convenient to walk to the scenic spots, but I do have two points to complain about:
1. Originally, we only stayed two nights in Jinan during the Spring Festival self-driving trip, leaving a rare dinner at the French restaurant in the hotel, but... we went to the restaurant to order at six o'clock, and at eight o'clock in the evening, the main meal of steak and salad was not served... The food served before was also sp****, the soup was cold, and the salmon was also cold. When I asked the waiter, he said, "It's cold because it's served from the 6th floor...??" He looked confused. After all kinds of urging, the steak was finally served. Not to mention the Wellington, the meat was absolutely delicious. It was okay to the naked eye but not too hot. My stomach hurt after eating this meal. The child waited for two hours just to eat the bread. At the end of the meal, we hurried away after finishing the steak, and even the desserts were not delivered to our room. After communicating with the waiter, the answer we got was that the salad was waived (because it wasn’t served until eight o’clock and we didn’t eat it) and we were given a 15% discount (hotel guests were given a 10% discount)…
Forget it, I just don’t want to quarrel during the Chinese New Year, but it’s really disappointing...
2. It’s puzzling that InterContinental doesn’t have a capsule coffee machine.

msg:Let’s talk about the advantages first: 1. The location is very good; 2. The service is very good; 3. The buildings in the city center are relatively old, which is why this hotel is (renovated in 2017), but the overall cleanliness is okay.
Disadvantages: 1. There are nearly 40 rooms on the first floor, so it is almost impossible to sleep in. The passage is noisy with people coming and going in the morning; 2. Due to design problems in the traffic flow line, you need to transfer to the elevator to check in, and the walking distance is long; 3. The floors are relatively long It is a short, non-detached hotel, and there is no difference between the interior and exterior.
Not recommended if you consider living comfort, but recommended if transportation convenience is your primary choice.

Facilities: The converter head between the overhead shower head and the hand-held shower head in the shower was broken. When changing, it was pulled out. When the water was cold, cold water was sprayed all over me. There were too few towels in the room, not enough. It's not a smart toilet, the equipment is slightly old. Not a Dyson hair dryer, a domestic heating iron😓

Service: I called the hotel and asked the hotel that takeaways can be delivered by robots. However, when there are many people, the robots have to queue up, and the time is within an acceptable range.
I didn't want to comment at first, until I saw the bloodstained towel, I really couldn't bear it anymore

Everything else is also in line with five-star hotel standards. There is nothing to choose from. It is a bit puzzling that only one side of the twin room can be charged. I hope it can be adjusted.

msg:The hygiene is pretty good, but I think the bathtub is a bit dirty.
The overall environment is pretty good. Downstairs is Quancheng Square, which is very close to Baotu Spring, Daming Lake, and Furong Street. You can take a bath at the swimming pool. The bathhouse is too cold, very cold. I wanted to take a bath in the room, but it turned out The water in the bathtub was still warm after being left for a long time, not hot at all, not as hot as the shower head in the room! I do not know how it is. Not a very good impression of the hotel. There is a coffee shop in the lobby where you can check in. I don't know if it is owned by the hotel or outsourced. Within two minutes of sitting there for a rest, a waiter will come over and ask you to leave. If you want to sit here, you need to pay. I have stayed in so many hotels and have never encountered a hotel like this.
The service was pretty good, except for the fact that a little boy was the waiter during breakfast. Don't use the excuse that he had only been on the job for a few days because you were negligent in your pre-job training. I called the little boy over and asked him to help take away the empty plate. After he took it away, he came to me again, probably to ask what happened to the plate I just gave him. Is it no longer necessary and needs to be withdrawn? I was confused, but two people came over and called him away quickly to briefly talk to him. Don’t start working immediately without adequate training. Moreover, there are two older aunts in the restaurant who are chatting with you next to you when they are not collecting plates or working. What kind of family can't make money? The guests are eating with them, and I don’t want to hear you complaining. How can your waiter still chat while you are at work? And many dishes are served cold! Hope it improves!

This is today's breakfast. Problems have occurred countless times. Today I met another A friend got very angry because he ate the overnight buns. While they were arguing, I was afraid that the hotel would be destroyed again, so I took a few overnight buns and let everyone see the five-star hotel where guests spent 1,800 yuan to stay. As for what I was eating, an employee told me that the steamed buns in the kitchen were over-steamed, but what I want to say is, have you ever cooked? The same noodles, the same fillings, why don’t the buns look like this when I take the second pot? One is full and the other is as hard as a rock. Your refrigerator may be good, but what it is stored with needs to be studied. I hope you can call up the surveillance video to clarify, so as not to fool consumers all the time. This is not good.

Fruits are provided when you check in, as well as free afternoon tea and light meals. The only shortcoming is that the breakfast buffet is still the same variety and number of samples as before, which relatively reduces the status of the five-star intercontinental.

When we arrived at the hotel at 11:30 in the morning, the room had been packed out and upgraded in advance. This is much better than many other hotels that force you to wait until after two o'clock in the afternoon.
In addition, the front desk also gave me two drink coupons, so you can order coffee at the lobby bar.
The lighting in the room is very good. It's more than ten degrees below zero outside, so it's still very warm sitting by the window. Breakfast was also very good. The service staff took the seats and made tea, which was very considerate. The service staff on the first floor are also very considerate. Because the hotel front desk is on the seventh floor, when we went down to the first floor in the elevator, the service staff would take the initiative to help us when they saw a lot of luggage. You don't have to go to the front desk on the seventh floor to store your luggage. You can also store your luggage in the lobby on the first floor. very convenient.
Another very satisfying point is that we had to wait for a report the next day and asked if we could delay check-out. Customer service Xiao Yang enthusiastically said yes. In short, during this trip to Jinan, although it was very cold outside, the hotel's service was really refreshing.

The hotel is elegantly decorated, has complete facilities and equipment, the rooms are quiet and tidy, the front desk is enthusiastic and professional, the quality supervision manager Connie handles problems efficiently and flexibly, and the engineering maintenance services are also very professional. It’s just that this time I found that a shortcut to the south that could lead to the underground parking lot was blocked. I don’t know why. I hope it can be opened as soon as possible. The experience will be better. Overall, it is recommended as the first choice hotel in Jinan!

The location is super convenient. You can walk to Kuanhouli, Black Tiger Spring, Daming Lake and other scenic spots. There is Quancheng Square downstairs (but I don’t have time to go there) and there are many dining options around.
The service staff of the hotel are really very good. When we were about to arrive in Jinan, two people started to suffer from serious back problems. One was a light touch, the other was a key point. When the hotel front desk called to confirm the needs, please ask them to change the mattress to a hard one and wait for a while. Everything I asked for was done for me, and the cleaning lady completed it quickly. The cleaning lady the next day saw us taking our children and gave us a lot of water to prevent the children from being dehydrated. In addition, special thanks to the hotel for sending steamed eggs and rice to the children!
All in all, I was very satisfied with my trip to Jinan!

Let’s talk about the shortcomings. The bathroom is a bit small. The mattress is a bit too soft and not very comfortable to sleep on. The most terrible thing is that from 6 to 7 o'clock in the morning, there was a sudden sound like a blower upstairs, which really affected the guests' rest.
The service staff are very nice. They can call me by my name even when I call the front desk. I feel very friendly. Xiaohua also explained my questions very clearly.

Environment: The hotel is located in the center of Jinan, adjacent to Quancheng Square; it is an area where Jinan's government, business and scenic spots are concentrated. The hotel is within walking distance to Baotu Spring, Black Tiger Spring, Wulongtan, Daming Lake, Kuanhouli, Qushuiting Street and other scenic spots and characteristic old streets. There are complete commercial and catering facilities around the hotel. The location is quite ideal.

Services and facilities: The hotel's service is very good. From the moment you place the rental, the bellman will ask if you need a luggage trolley. After entering the first floor, the concierge will give you the luggage tag and take the luggage away. After checking in, it will be sent directly to you. to the room.

The facilities in the room match the pictures on Ctrip, so I won’t post pictures of the room. I’ll post some of the buffet dinner on the sixth floor of the hotel. The buffet restaurant has discounts for in-house guests, and the overall price/performance ratio is very high. Especially, I was lucky enough to catch the special service of hairy crabs... The buffet breakfast is also good, whether it is traditional Chinese or exquisite Western, the variety is very rich and looks very good. Fresh. The hotel called me after I checked out the next day. It seemed like I called more than once from different numbers? But because my phone is set to automatically block unfamiliar numbers, I never received a call...

Hygiene: Nothing to say, just clean.

Overall, I am very satisfied and will choose this hotel next time I come to Jinan.

The five-star standard is beyond words. From the parking guidance around the hotel, the parking space arrangement in the underground garage, to the lobby guidance and check-in, from the uncle to the front desk lady to the room service aunt, they always have a smile on their faces. We met in the corridor. They will also take the initiative to show their goodwill and chat a few words. This kind of chat is not the kind of perfunctory official talk, but is really chatting with you, and does not stop the work at hand, and will not affect the activities of the guests. It is very warm and warm. Comfortable.

Room:
The overall flow is smooth, from the entrance to the dressing room to the bathroom to the bed area to the sofa area to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The straight line is very spacious, the carpet is very soft and quiet, and the swivel chair is a bit hard.

Supporting hardware:
The TV is a bit old and only has common satellite channels. I really recommend Internet TV. Everything else is OK.
The bathroom fixtures are obviously Kohler, and the exhaust effect is average. The same-channel sound amplification in the bathroom is a definite plus. You can watch the TV in the room through the partition glass while taking a bath.

Parent-child room layout:
In the parent-child room booked this time, most of the corners of the furniture were protected with anti-collision corner guards. However, it was obviously not a professional parent-child room. It was only remodeled later because all the furniture was not rounded and there were still many corners. The risk of injury, especially with small slides, is even more dangerous, and it is recommended to do more risk management.
This time it was for the small tent and the small slide, because the child had just learned to walk at 15 months old, and the small slide was very new, which was a plus. I like the small tent very much at night. I hug a stuffed bear and am very happy. It is recommended that the stuffed bears placed in the tent can be given away with the guests, or canceled, because they are very cute to the little ones, but it is really cruel to let them go after leaving. The furry bear is very soft.

Meals:
I only had breakfast at the hotel, leaving the rest for next time. The breakfast alone is very good, but it can only be eaten in dine-in, and the room delivery service can only be done after 10:30. I may have to wait until the end of the dine-in breakfast. I hope it can be done. At the same time.
The dishes are pretty good, very rich, with a complete mix of meat and vegetables, a lot of hot and cold combinations, and a perfect combination of Chinese and Western. You still have to be careful not to take too many dishes at the buffet, because you can really last it. Seeing your baby eating happily proves everything. , very good breakfast restaurant.

Shopping and entertainment:
It is a shopping mall in itself, similar to SKP. It is very convenient to buy bags and shoes. LV styles are average. Gucci is a little later but can make up for it. Dior escaped without paying attention.
Next to it are two relatively large shopping plazas, which are very lively during the day and night. They can also meet your shopping needs at any time during vacation, which is perfect.

Attractions nearby:
Close to Daming Lake, 15 minutes' walk. Baotu Spring, 10 minutes walk. Black Tiger Spring, 10 minutes walk. They are all within walking distance, suitable for all ages. It is very comfortable to have something to eat and visit the sights.

Travel:
The transportation is very convenient, and the scenic spots are within walking distance. Because it seems difficult to park at the scenic spots, we all walked with a stroller. Shandong people's drivers are very friendly to pedestrians and will give way to places where there are no traffic lights.

Generally speaking, my trip to Jinan has been very beautiful since I checked into the hotel. I will definitely come back next time. Thank you to all the staff.

The parking lot was also very full, but there was a security guy who helped guide us throughout the entire process to find a parking space. The hotel lobby is on the seventh floor, with a very open indoor space and a high ceiling. (My son bought a hydrogen balloon and flew it to the top of the high lobby when he returned to the lobby. The next morning, he saw three hydrogen balloons on the ceiling. Hahaha, I guess they all floated up without holding it). The room was on the eighth floor. Because the hotel was full, I had to wait for a while when I checked in in the afternoon. My family was a little confused but the front desk staff resolved it smoothly. By chance, I contacted Xiao Zhao from the reservation depar**ent. She is very professional and embodies the hospitality of the hotel staff. She is warm and hospitable. I will come back if I have the opportunity.

When traveling to Jinan, first of all, the Lunan Guihe InterContinental Hotel, Baotu Spring, Daming Lake, Furong Street, and Qianfo Mountain are all nearby, so you will not be tired at all.

msg:When traveling, if you really don’t choose a hotel. Brand chains, international groups, and five-star hotels will definitely not fall into this trap. I booked a deluxe double room with a lot of space. On the entrance side is the dressing area, and then there are showers, bathtubs, etc. King Size bed + comfortable mattress bedding = great sleep. The room service, whether it is the service or the freshness of the taste of the food, is first-class. I missed lunch time when I checked in and went to the French restaurant on the 8th floor. Ordered seafood pizza and truffle risotto. Not pre-made dishes, all freshly cooked, the taste is the best, love it! ! ! The buffet restaurant on the 6th floor for dinner can only be said to be average, nothing special. The breakfast buffet is okay. Shandong pancake...the special breakfast is not bad. Both Chinese and Western food are available. The hotel is located in the city center and is very convenient to go out. It is very convenient to go to the surrounding Baotu Spring, Daming Lake and other scenic spots. The front desk service is less than the best. Next time I come to Jinan, InterContinental will be my first choice.

Northeast people can’t adapt to such a hot climate in Jinan. As soon as I arrived at the hotel, the service staff brought me a bucket of water. My dog ​​has a stomachache Well, I usually drink carbonated mineral water in the morning, and the food and beverage depar**ent gave 6 cans of Watsons sparkling soda water for free. My clothes had been washed when I came to the hotel, and the hotel air-dried me for free. Much praise. Also, the hotel's breakfast has always been very good. I have stayed at the InterContinental Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town. The breakfast at Jinan Guihe Intercontinental Hotel is also very good.

I found the room when I returned to my room after dinner. There is a problem with the air conditioner, which stays at 26.2 degrees forever. I called the main station and sent someone to look at it very quickly. Since it was very late, we also felt that it would be too troublesome to change another room, so the hotel temporarily took a cooler Please help me, the next morning, I called the front desk again to explain the situation, and quickly arranged 2 twin rooms for us to see and choose. No matter if there are any problems, water, slippers, and bath towels are delivered very quickly, which is really great. Let's talk about the hotel's breakfast, which is also very rich and the environment is great! The hotel's gym and swimming pool facilities are very good, worthy of a five-star hotel. Finally, I would like to thank Xiaoxue, the switchboard. Since my parents are old, after leaving the hotel, I called in time to inform that a hat had been left in the hotel room, and also helped us express it back to Shanghai. Thank you!

Jinan is really too hot. The western restaurant is delicious, and the serving lady is very gentle. The tall and thin man in the lobby bar didn’t know what the name of the coffee was. I asked him if Xiushuiting Western Restaurant was going up. He swung me to the side and made a big circle 🤬 and asked about the preparation for the meeting I walked back to the staff again, thinking about not running to settle accounts with that man in the end. Unfortunately, construction started on the sidewalk next to it after 10 o'clock in the evening, and it stopped at 2 o'clock in the night because of the heavy rain, or you don't need to sleep at all. Those who plan to stay in the near future should pay attention to lightning protection.

The only problem is that to go from the room to the lobby on the 1st floor, you have to go to the 7th floor to cross the lobby and then change to another elevator, which cannot be done in one step.

Hygiene: clean and spotless.

Environment: Very good, 1km north of the hotel is Daming Lake, 1km west is Quancheng Square and Daming Lake, it is very convenient to walk there.

Service: Very attentive. Before check-in, Connie called to ask when to check in. After learning that there was a child, she gave a small gift. The baby liked it very much. She even upgraded us to a king-size bed room. The room is large and air-conditioned. very comfortable.

All in all, it was a satisfying trip to Jinan.

Hygiene: Hygienic is good, although there are some black scum under the pillow case, please replace it in time after reporting and apologize, the attitude is very good.

Environment: There is Plaza 66 in the surrounding area, and the Guihe Shopping Center where the hotel is located is full of luxury products, one-stop shopping.

Service: When I checked in for the first time, a male employee wearing glasses at the front desk upgraded the room type when he learned that he was traveling with his parents to make the check-in more comfortable. When checking out, the employee Liu Xiaoyan also thoughtfully delivered fruit. The most worth mentioning is the feedback reflected in the check-in After the problem was solved in time, the account manager Connie also called to express his apology again, and hoped to bring a better experience to the guests, which is commendable.
In summary, this time I tried the all-day buffet lunch on the sixth floor. It has a rich variety and good hygiene conditions. It will be completely eliminated on Monday. The only thing I didn’t buy is the six-pack Dragon Boat Rice Dumpling from InterContinental. 👍

The first thing is that because I am afraid of heat in my late pregnancy, I asked the front desk when I checked in whether the temperature of the air conditioner could be adjusted and whether the windows could be opened in the house. The front desk replied that there was really no way to solve it. However, the after-sales customer service who called me after checking out said that I could ask a technician to adjust the temperature of the air conditioner in the house! !
The second thing is that I lost my Apple Bluetooth headset on the hotel bed. I put it next to my pillow after using it before going to bed, and forgot to put it away when I checked out in the morning. I called the hotel that night to inquire, but I didn’t get a call back until the next afternoon saying that I still hadn’t found it!
After staying in hotels for so many years, things have often been left behind. This is the first time I encountered a shady hotel where I left things behind and couldn't find them again!

The check-in experience is not bad. Compared with Qingdao Intercontinental, it is a heaven and an underground. I booked a view room in Quancheng Square, where I can fully see the fountains in Quancheng Square. The room is big enough and the facilities are well maintained. There are many main service personnel, from the gate to the parking lot, you will see the hotel's guide staff during the period. This piece of service is very worthy of recognition.
	
If I have to say something dissatisfied, the hair dryer is so hard to use... I can't appreciate the series of fragrances of shampoo, skin care lotion (more advanced woody fragrance, I like fresh fruity fragrance, haha, this is not a shortcoming, it is me fault).
	
Below the hotel is Guihe shopping mall, next to it is Hang Lung and World Trade Center, behind it is Quancheng Square, in front of it is Daming Lake, the location is very golden. Check-in and check-out were very quick.
	
The most important thing is that the ispa in InterContinental is really great, with good service and high cost performance. Well, I will live here when I come to Jinan in the future.

msg:The room is facing Daming Lake, but the distance is still a bit far. The room is large, the coat rack and bathroom are spacious. The front desk of the hotel is located on the 7th floor, and the lobby is quite impressive. There is an open-air beer hall on the 12th floor. Go for a drink at night 🍺Night view🌃The a**osphere is very good👍. Jinan is one of my favorite cities. The area is small, the spring water is ding-dong, full of aura, wealthy and tuned, and full of fireworks. The hotel is in the city center, it is convenient to go everywhere. It is the first choice for tourism in Jinan!

msg:We decided to stay here on our last night in Jinan. After a few days of exhaustion, we had to rest and adjust on the last day. When we arrived at the hotel, Brother Liu Maofu, the security guard, guided us to park the car. It was very convenient to enter and exit at the door. We arrived early, so we stored our luggage on the first floor first, and then went to Quancheng Square next to it. The location of this hotel is very close to Quancheng Square, Baotu Spring and Daming Lake. It is within walking distance. Don’t When driving, it is extremely difficult to park a car at each scenic spot. Although I have walked a lot these days, I still walk the fastest~ The attitude of the concierge on the first floor is also very good~ We went to the front desk in about the same time, and the service at the front desk is also very good. Don't get tired of asking, it's understandable that the room type we booked was not cleaned. After all, it was during the Golden Week. We were upgraded to an executive suite for free. The snacks in the executive lounge can be enjoyed for free. Our room also waited for about 50 minutes. We took advantage of this I went to the hotel pool for a swim in time. The pool is not big, but there are not too many guests. There are two heated pools next to it. The water temperature is moderate. There are dried fruits and small cakes in the executive lounge. I wanted to go to the roof garden for dinner at 5:30. , but I don’t know if you need to book in advance. The side seats are gone. That day it was 29 degrees high and the wind was strong. We went shopping. It was very sunny and windy after 5 o’clock. We went downstairs to help ourselves. It proves that the self-service is the most cost-effective~ But my baby is quite pitiful, half the price for an 8-year-old, but he probably ate a small plate that day... Blood loss... It is actually more cost-effective for adults, there are all kinds of seafood, prawns and small shellfish Lobster and so on, but we are foreigners and don’t know what kind of seafood is delicious. We just take whatever the locals get...and the barbecue burritos are not inferior to Zibo BBQ hahaha...the stomach is crooked...the guest room Auntie Dong Jinfeng is also very nice. Our key card is not very easy to use. The auntie is eager to help us open the door~ Every waiter in the hotel is very nice and responsive. It makes us outsiders feel the enthusiasm of Shandong people. I recommend everyone to stay here

It is about one kilometer to the first spring, Daming Lake, Furong Street, etc. For the congested May Day, there is less trouble of traffic jams. The second is that the service is in place and makes people feel at home. I especially commend Feng Yeping, the lobby manager, who is very warm and caring. The third is the rich variety of breakfast.

Conne took the initiative to contact us the day before check-in, and arranged a high-rise non-smoking floor, and there was a small surprise arrangement for check-in. The location of the store is very good, and it is relatively close to various scenic spots. On May 1st, when the traffic is congested, you can walk to Baotu Spring, Wulongtan, Daming Lake, and Quancheng Square. It is very convenient to visit Daming Lake at night. Although there are many guests, I feel that every guest is taken care of very well. It is a very good hotel.

All our requests were satisfactorily resolved. The location of the hotel is very good, and it is very close to the attractions. It can be reached in a 10-minute walk, and there are many restaurants around the hotel, which are rich and frugal. The hotel room view is also good, the room is relatively large, and the facilities are perfect. The hotel has a rich breakfast, which can satisfy people with different preferences. The only downside is that the mattress and pillows are too soft, which is a bit uncomfortable for people with cervical and lumbar diseases. It will be perfect if it needs to be updated and improved in the future, (I will consider coming again next time) because more and more middle-aged and elderly retirees will travel abroad, and the demand in this regard will also increase.

Thanks to Ctrip.com for carefully, rigorously and responsibly choosing merchants and partners to stay on the platform. The quality of service is really important. Ctrip friends will use their consistent loyalty to make the most accurate evaluation of the seriousness and responsibility of the Ctrip platform.
        Thank you Jinan Lunenggui and all the staff of InterContinental Hotel for their sincere and thoughtful service and warm and warm concern. The room cleaning lady Lu Jinfeng's serious and meticulous cleaning service and her character of saving money put a perfect end to my trip. Thank you very much, thank you.
The overall environment, facilities and services of the hotel are very suitable for its own star positioning, and it is slightly overvalued. This is the embodiment of the hotel's hard-working and enterprising concept that has played a central role. There is a small suggestion to mention here. It is recommended that the hotel change the shampoo, shower gel, skin care lotion, and hand sanitizer in the guest room from large bottles to small bottles. This is not only to avoid waste, but also to avoid some people with ulterior motives from doping "foreign matter". This is a problem that needs to be paid attention to and investigated, because it is impossible for the hotel to clean each room after the guest leaves the store. Most of the remaining items in the above items should be poured out for inspection or discarded. After all, the price of a large bottle is around several hundred yuan.
        The reception at the front desk is meticulous and considerate, because the hotel implements the "check-in deposit" method for check-in management. Therefore, as long as the deposit payment method is not "cash payment", customers can experience the innovative service of "quick check-out", which ensures that customers can quickly and concisely complete the check-out procedures at the first time. It only takes a few seconds. A few simple words of dialogue will suffice.
        Hotel customer service staff, you have worked hard! Facing me, "a troublesome customer who often calls room service with minor problems", your consistent tireless and thoughtful answers reflect your professionalism and dedication. Although I forgot to ask your name, I think you Your professionalism and dedication have won my admiration for you.
        There are many types of food and beverage dishes in the hotel's full-time restaurant, especially Jinan's special dishes and snacks. Although I don't know what the "authentic taste" is like, it fits my taste and my definition of "delicious". The meat, oil spin, sweet foam, Shandong pancakes, Shandong pancakes, and Shandong fried dumplings all brought me the enjoyment of taste buds. The service is also very warm and caring. Miss Dong Yuanjing's meticulous and thoughtful service to our couple and children is still fresh in our memory. The restaurant also has a small feature, there is a small children's paradise, where children can play in it when they are naughty, and it can also relieve the anxiety of parents and mothers when eating. As for whether there is a restaurant The service staff replaced the parents and mothers to accompany the children to play. I didn't experience it, so I don't comment.
        Thank you, Jinan Lunenggui and all the staff of the InterContinental Hotel. Your warm, serious, responsible, thoughtful and considerate service is the greatest happiness of every traveler. Happy and beautiful travel memories are imprinted in every traveler's good memories, which will surely be the gospel of Jinan's tourism industry.
        Thanks again, thank you!

When I left, I was in a good mood because of Shi Jichen's warm service. Thank you for the excellent service of the hotel!

You can go to Baotu Spring, Daming Lake, Furong Street, Heihu Spring, Kuanhouli, Quancheng Square, Baihuazhou, etc. within 20 minutes on foot. , and they are all centered on the hotel, there are scenic spots to go in the southeast, north and south, which is not too convenient. The hotel is not new, but the room is big enough, the service is good, and the living is comfortable.
The hotel has a rich breakfast. On the day of departure, Dong Yuanjing also packed fruit, bread and other snacks, which felt very warm.

Calling the guest center usually takes five minutes to deliver the needed items, and there is also a call back. On the second day of check-in, I also took the initiative to put children's toiletry sets. The restaurant is also very considerate. When I saw an elderly person coming, I would take the initiative to consider the inconvenient steps for the elderly to go up and down when arranging the seats. It was quick to clean up the dishes, and treated the children with kindness and enthusiasm. The swimming pool is clean and there are few people, and the whole process is reserved. There is a large swimming pool at 28°C and two small pools at 38°C, which is too comfortable. Special praise was given to Xiaotian Xiaoyang in the guest center and Jia Yixue in charge of the restaurant.

The check-in experience is very good, and the facilities, sanitation and environmental services are all excellent. The location is really good, right in the city center, very convenient to get in and out. It is very close to the famous Baotu Spring, within hundreds of steps. Quancheng Square is on the side, you can see it from the window, and there are restaurants, shopping malls and hotels around. The hotel is located on the seventh floor above the large shopping mall. The lobby is high-end and spacious, the room facilities are well maintained, and the design is also very elegant and easy to use. The walk-in wardrobe on the right hand after entry, especially during the period of the epidemic, it is extremely convenient to change clothes immediately when entering and exiting. The room is spacious, the bed is good for sleeping, and the bathtub and sanitary ware are made of good materials. The bathroom part occupies almost half of the room. The breakfast is very rich and delicious, and there are more choices for dinner. The service is very warm and in place, and the management is orderly. The little brother who checked in was sincere, thoughtful and professional, and the waiters in the restaurant lobby were also very helpful. It is indeed a five-star hotel👍Highly recommended! Worth coming back.

Facilities: I live in a suite, the door between the living room and the bedroom is broken, and it can be rotated around the upper right corner and the lower left corner as the central axis. The floor tiles in the bathroom are also broken, and a small stone stuck my foot.

Service: I am a platinum member of IHG, an Intercontinental Ambassador, but the IHG app must be bound with a MasterCard or Visa credit card to use it, so my points cannot be used, and I must book from the front desk or Ctrip at a higher price, and the customer service call is transferred to the membership center , the Mandarin service has been stopped, hang up directly. I made a reservation with Ctrip. I stayed at two counters at the front desk. The room types that I could upgrade were different. I really don’t know if there are rules for ambassadors to stay in an upgraded room type or it depends on the mood of the staff.
Everything else is fine, the staff are very polite and kind.

The next day it snowed and the view was even more beautiful. The location of the hotel is good. It is in the same building as Guihe Shopping Center, next to Plaza 66. It is very convenient to eat and drink. It is within walking distance from major scenic spots such as Quancheng Square, Kuanhouli, Black Tiger Spring, Moat, Baotu Spring, Qushuiting Lane, and Daming Lake. The only downside is that the hotel has a lot of rooms, and it is together with Guihe Shopping Center, which makes it a little troublesome to go to the elevator a few times, and it takes a detour to go to the executive lounge. There is no place or shelf for temporarily placing mobile phones and items in the toilet location. This is the first time I have encountered so many five-star hotels.

To take care of the elderly and children, we need to be close together as much as possible, so we booked a twin bed and a parent-child theme bed. The twin bed is an executive room. The communication in the early stage was okay. They said that there are no room types next to each other, so we can only Change room type. When we got to the room, there was a strange smell, the carpet was terribly dirty, and the children's fence was also loose, so we couldn't use it, so we communicated and changed to two twin rooms next to each other. The customer service said there was no room, and it was pouring rain outside, so we had to drive for a long distance After a long, long time, the children and the elderly couldn't stand it anymore. They had no choice but to take four pillows and figure out a way to fix the bed. The customer service said in the early stage that it had done smoke-free trea**ent. I don't know if it was done or not. The air conditioner in the twin room is noisy at night, making people unable to sleep all night. The facilities are old. The night light is only under the bedside table. I just endured to live for the elderly and children. When ordering, the minibar Changxiang didn't say anything at the front desk. When I left the store, I asked the customer service that I could only use four soft drinks. When leaving the store, the customer service staff told me to give a good review, which is impossible! I have never stayed in such a poor five-star hotel. This InterContinental, except for the location is worth one star, the rest is really bad! The video is the noise of the air conditioner at 4 o'clock in the morning! We live in rooms 830 and 831!

The guest room is upgraded to view, on the tenth floor, with a good view, you can overlook Daming Lake, and children like it very much.
The buffet breakfast is rich and delicious.
The overall service awareness of the hotel is very good. It can be seen that the usual training is in place. Whether it is the welcome boy or the room cleaning lady, they are very polite.
Will stay again in the future.

Service: Cleaning and the young lady at the front desk are very friendly, and they can deliver whatever is needed in time. The service is no problem.
Environment: The location is very good, you can go to any scenic spot within walking distance. But the hotel is upstairs in the shopping mall, and the lobby is on the 7th floor. There is no foyer reception at the entrance, and the decoration of the lobby is also like a train station.
Facilities: I am really dissatisfied with the facilities. First of all, it is not smart. There are no electric curtains, and the light switches are carefully divided. There are only two light switches at the bedside. On is fully on, off is fully off. Secondly, there is no USB socket. The plug at the head of the bed is still broken. If you want to charge, you can't lie on the bed and go to the sofa or table to find the socket. The overall facilities are very old.
Hygiene: The hygienic feeling is also very average. The tables in the house are covered with bump marks, and the glass in the toilet does not feel very clean. Unsatisfactory check-in experience. I will definitely not stay here next time I come to Jinan.

The attitude of the service staff in the breakfast room is really in place, and it always makes people feel that they have a really comfortable state to enjoy breakfast. The scenery is less, but there were some small accidents in the executive lounge on the second night, and the attitude to deal with the problem was very positive.

I hope the hotel can make more efforts on food safety, and also There is a rainy day during the National Day, and my shoes were soaked on the way back to the hotel for dinner at Plaza 66.

You can feel it perfectly in Guihe Intercontinental. At this point, Zhang Qian, who met the front desk at the beginning of the check-in, had a premonition that it should be a pleasant trip. Originally, I couldn't see whether I was a member or not when I booked with Ctrip. Zhang Qian was not only humble and patient, but also took the initiative to find out if I had checked in before. Check-in preference, after learning about it, I took the initiative to help arrange it. The whole process was meticulous and serious. The location of the hotel has nothing to say.

msg:Traveling alone in the summer vacation, I struggled for a long time between Kempinski and Intercontinental, and finally chose Intercontinental. Although Kempinski looks better than the newer room types, but after all, you have to visit the scenic spots when you go out to play, and the geographical location of Intercontinental is very suitable. The hotel is located near Daming Lake, and it is not far from Daming Lake, Baotu Spring, Black Tiger Spring and Furong Street. The surrounding business is very prosperous, shopping and eating are very convenient.
Transportation: It is a relatively central location in the old city, but there will be traffic jams when taking a taxi. Fortunately, the places to eat, drink and play are relatively close. It is recommended to walk.
Hygiene: The overall hygiene is good. After all, it is an old hotel, and there are still some traces of time. The service auntie is more serious about cleaning, and the service is also good. However, the details still need to be improved. For example, some fluffy dust can be seen in the ceiling light trough, and the stains on the edge of the bathroom sink have not been cleaned.
Environment: The environment of the hotel is relatively good. Personally, I like the zigzag corridor, the bright ceiling, bright during the day and warm at night, which makes people feel very comfortable. The swimming pool looks good, but unfortunately I forgot to bring a swimsuit, and the time for the three-day tour was relatively rushed, so I didn't go to experience it. The breakfast is also the best among the five-star hotel buffets I have eaten recently. There are many choices and fresh ingredients.
Service: Shandong people are very warm, the overall service is very good, the aunt in the room, the restaurant, and the front desk are all very good. It is worth mentioning that the service of the switchboard Xiao Yang is excellent, with five-star praise.

In general, it is a good choice to stay at Intercontinental for personal travel, it is worth recommending👍🏻

msg:This time, I chose Jinan Guihe InterContinental Hotel based on the recommendation of Ctrip. It was a worthwhile trip! The location is located near Quancheng Square in the city center. After eating Guihe's buffet dinner, turn right and go out to Quancheng Square, as well as Quancheng Road Pedestrian Street and Kuanhouli.
The hotel environment and landscape are generally good. The floor-to-ceiling windows in the room have a wide field of vision. You can see the night view of Jinan at night.
Service: What impressed us most this time was the service of the hotel. Every time we called the front desk or other depar**ents, they always called me accurately, Ms. L, which was a very warm feeling. The room attendants are very enthusiastic. Every time you need something, they will deliver it in time. The staff in the cafeteria on the sixth floor are also attentive and thoughtful. Having stayed in many five-star hotels, this time the service experience is the best.
Dining, the buffet dinner on the sixth floor is really rich in variety and tastes good. Guihe's dessert ice cream is delicious, and the Japanese cuisine is comparable to the Japanese food store outside.
If anything, the pool is a bit small, but space is limited in the heart of the city. This can also be understood.
I hope all aspects of your InterContinental Hotel will get better and better!

Since the hotel is located in the city center and is in the same building as the shopping mall, parking and check-in took a lot of trouble. The guy at the front desk who checked in for us was inexperienced, and something went wrong, and the room he was given was not very satisfactory. , Because I only stayed for one night, I wanted to forget it. Unexpectedly, a complaint when I called the guest service center to ask for a pillow attracted the attention of Nancy, the customer service manager, and Lucy, the front office. apologized to me. This surprised and moved me deeply. I was surprised that Jinan InterContinental could get the opinions of the guests so quickly, and the management gave feedback quickly. At the same time, I was also moved by the high attention and efficient handling of the customer experience by the two supervisors. They left me with fond memories of this night in Quancheng.
Due to objective conditions, the hotel is not very convenient for self-driving guests, and there is room for improvement in parking guidance, lobby guidance, and concierge services, but for me, InterContinental Jinan has already relied on their customer-first service concept and The warm and meticulous service attitude has given me more trust in the InterContinental brand. I hope to have the opportunity to return to the beautiful Spring City in the future and relive the spring-like service provided by Jinan Intercontinental!

The supporting facilities in the bedroom are very complete and complete, such as sofas, office desks and chairs and central air conditioning, which are enough reasons to choose this hotel as a place to stay for business trips. Because the hotel has a high floor and is located in the most prosperous area in the center of Jinan, the viewing field is very wide, and you can have a bird's-eye view of the city of Jinan from the guest room. The supporting facilities are very suitable for business people and also suitable for tourist vacations. Sure enough, it is both business and vacation. Do you like such high-star landmark hotels?
If you are on a business trip or on vacation and don’t need to go to bed early, you can watch popular movies with friends or family. The high-definition plasma TV is super powerful, and you can sleep in a comfortable bed and chat with friends or family while watching movies. I feel like only I can understand it.
The hotel rooms are divided into two types: smoking rooms and non-smoking rooms. The front desk of the hotel will allocate rooms according to whether they smoke or not. This kind of humanized design is worth mentioning, after all, many business people will smoke more or less.
The public areas of the hotel are quite elegant in terms of Feng Shui, and the floors are in a circular manner. It uses arcs to create circular trajectories, thereby generating centripetal force to alleviate the problem of rushing between floors, balancing the aura, and at the same time increasing the aesthetic depth of the building.

The bad experience came from a middle-aged and elderly worker in his fifties and sixties on the first floor. His only job was to let guests scan the code of the venue. The two of us go in and out several times a day, and he can't remember the guests at all. It can be said that he has no ability to work in this area. We came back from outside at 12:30 noon. He asked us to scan the code. I told him that we lived here. He said that we need to check the room card. I showed him and let him go. I came back at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and asked him to scan the code again. In fact, due to the epidemic, there were very few guests staying. I casually said, "I already know you, but you don't know me", which probably stimulated his fragile and insecure self-confidence. , like a grandson and asked me to come back and scan the code, I took out the room card to show him, but it was too bad, he just reprimanded me to come back and scan the code, TNND, I was so mad.

Due to the epidemic, breakfast could not be eaten and had to be brought back to the room, but the food was not reduced, it was very rich, and the robot food delivery was also very safe and convenient. The night view was particularly beautiful, and you could see Daming Lake in the distance.

msg:The former Crowne Plaza Hotel, stayed once. Enter from the first floor lobby. Taking the elevator to the seventh floor is the hotel's check-in lobby. When checking in, the guy at the front desk has a very good attitude. He checked the health code, itinerary code, nucleic acid report, and took photos one by one. He was very responsible and sent afternoon tea. Unfortunately, we were late when we checked in, the afternoon tea was closed, the front desk of the room was upgraded, and the corridor was very long. The room is ok. I didn't ask for breakfast, I said that it was not enough, I planned to stay for ten days and didn't go out. . Unfortunately, the room was too hot. Looking at the room on this side of Quancheng Square, there are no windows, and the glass curtain wall still absorbs heat. The room temperature is so hot that you can't sleep, the air conditioner is not turned on, and the natural wind blows. It was simply impossible to sleep. Nothing else is a problem. The facilities are rather old. The kettle won't close the lid. A hook was dropped from the clothes support.

It is said that the skylight can be opened. The wedding hall in the central hall should be very romantic. What is especially commendable here is the service.

msg:The location of Lunenggui and Intercontinental is really hard to say. They are located in the city center of Jinan. Several famous scenic spots are within easy reach, and there are many business circles around. Guihe shopping malls, Hang Lung, Shimao, and Ginza shopping malls are all very close, and it is very convenient to eat, drink and shop. The room was well maintained, clean and tidy, the front desk service was warm and professional, and the breakfast was great. There is basically no problem with the equipment, and the air conditioner is also very comfortable. Except for the blockage of some water outlets in the tropical rain forest, it is probably the problem of hard water quality in Jinan. View of the room: The fitness center is not large, the equipment is quite complete, the swimming pool is empty and quiet, the room is best facing the south, you can see the Spring City Square without any obstruction, and you can see Daming Lake from the north, which is relatively refreshing, and there are two remaining In terms of direction, it is an ordinary urban landscape. After all, the hotel is in a shopping mall, the floor is not high, and the interior area of the room is quite large. In general, if you come to Jinan to live in five stars, you don't have to go back and forth, and it is absolutely no problem to go directly to the Intercontinental. Several other five-stars have lived, and finally Intercontinental has lived the most. Finally, I would like to recognize Connie He, who is the quality supervisor, who is professional and enthusiastic, and the service is in place. I will book a shop next time! Yang Yujie, the toll collector of the parking lot, has a thoughtful attitude and warm service!

At first, I just wanted to swim and compare several hotels and finally chose InterContinental. Rose, who had reserved the room in the executive lounge, called to help arrange the room (same floor of the executive lounge) and determined the breakfast location for the next day.
I like the room very much. It's big enough and the bed is comfortable. The aunt in the room saw that some children took the initiative to send small gifts and water.
Soft seats are reserved for breakfast, and the service of the handsome Liu Yongjian in the restaurant is very considerate. I would also like to praise the table setting for breakfast, butter knife and plate (because some hotels have omitted it), donuts 🍩 that children haven’t finished eating are also brought back in environmentally friendly paper bags. 👍
The lounge is my favorite, because it is so convenient. I can add food and drink at any time. The little girl Iris is very cute and friendly to children. There are also other tall, thin and beautiful girls. The service is very thoughtful.
There are not many people in the pool, and the special session hahaha. The next day is also to control each person's swimming lane. The only fly in the oin**ent is to give a small suggestion, it is best to add conditioner, and the hair dryer can be upgraded with high-power negative ions.

What surprised me was having breakfast at the restaurant on the 6th floor. The restaurant was clean and tidy, and the music made people feel comfortable. The experience of enjoying breakfast in the restaurant was very good. Manager Zhang Le's service was very thoughtful, and he specially reserved soft seats for us. The variety of breakfast is very rich. Manager Yan Lu introduced me to the characteristics of the restaurant in detail. The fat fried dough sticks, pancakes, and steamed buns recommended to me were all made on the spot, which made me really amazed that I was used to eating semi-finished products in other hotels. The local characteristics The meat is well-deserved and very delicious. There are many desserts for breakfast, which is also a surprise to me. The taste is very good. I would also like to praise the setting of the breakfast tableware. The western dishes for breakfast are very characteristic and can satisfy all kinds of taste buds. Chinese dishes are very suitable for my taste, and there are many patterns. As a restaurant breakfast, it can be so rich in variety, which is really amazing.
In the end, what impressed me deeply was the service quality of the hotel. The meticulous service details were full of thoughtfulness and consideration for the guests, making me feel at home and comfortable. I got up and prepared to leave the restaurant, and the restaurant staff said goodbye to me one by one, which moved me very much. Enthusiastic and professional working attitude and meticulous service, such an excellent hotel and restaurant will definitely become the best choice for your next visit to Jinan.

msg:The winter vacation is over, and the sons are going to stay in a five-star hotel and have a big meal. Therefore, although they are natives of Jinan, they still booked a king-size room on Ctrip, and the family of four decided to go to Guihezhouji for a vacation.
The room was huge, the sons especially liked the big bathtub and the soft bed.
After checking in at 19:00, we went to the cafeteria on the 6th floor of Guihezhouji. Tao Xinrui, the director of the cafeteria, took the initiative to remind the restaurant to close at 21:00, and was very considerate to the check-in customers. I think Crown InterContinental has good service and high cost performance.
The buffet foreman Liu Yongjian also gave the children two plush toys of little tigers. I learned that there was no hotel breakfast for the next day, and I also gave a small snack for the next day. I feel that the food delivered by Yongjian Liu is much better than the food delivered by other five-star hotels.
My son especially likes crabs and noodles in the cafeteria, and my daughter-in-law likes unlimited salmon, so I eat hot pot. I feel that I regularly take my children to a five-star hotel for a vacation, and the hotel itself is a great place to play.
At 11:00, I took the children to swim, and the water temperature was very suitable. When you leave at the end, you can park until 24:00 on the same day with the parking ticket at the front desk. It's also a saving in a place where parking is expensive.
Thanks to Tao Xinrui and Liu Yongjian who I met. The next booking is also considered an acquaintance.

I am very grateful for the services provided by InterContinental Hotels and Ctrip in the early communication, and also thank Ms. Qiu at the front desk for patiently answering time and time again and showing me on-site inspections, which finally allowed me to live in a satisfactory room, which will always keep me in mind. High-value girl. The hotel’s restaurant is clean and tidy, with a wide variety of varieties, so that I did not hesitate to invite my brothers and sisters to a buffet on the 6th floor of the hotel. Special thanks to the manager of the restaurant on the day, the lovely girl with big eyes, who has been patiently and enthusiastically taking care of our old men and women, keeping our hearts warm as spring. As a platinum member of Ctrip, I have been experiencing the high-quality services provided by Ctrip for decades, and I would like to express my gratitude again. Finally, I want to say: I believe that Ctrip believes that InterContinental Hotel is the best choice when traveling.

It is very close to Baotu Spring and Daming Lake. It is also convenient to eat next door to Henglong. The professionalism of service personnel is relatively high. Li Jingjing in the executive lounge has another classmate with the name of ABB (I really forget it).

You can reach Qushuiting Street by wandering in from the side alleys, which is worth seeing. Walking to Baotu Spring and Heihu Spring are very close.
The rooms on the executive floor are long and narrow, very large, but they feel empty and the furnishings are not enough. There is a dedicated cloakroom and dressing table.
The intestines and bacon starch for breakfast are very heavy. The experience is the worst in the hotel of the same grade I have stayed in. I hope I can purchase it from another brand.
The service is the best in the executive lounge.
The guest on the guest room floor met the guests, but none of them greeted them actively.
I live on the tenth floor. I forgot the room number. The umbrella in the room broke when I went out. You can check it more often. There is no coffee machine in the executive rooms.
The most exaggerated thing is that when I checked out, I found that the ceiling lamp by the window had dripped water all night! It's not at the top and bottom of the water, it's not on the top floor, it's amazing. When I checked out, the feedback was given to the front desk. The front desk clerk looked surprised. I haven't received any feedback from the hotel for any reason. Do I ignore the previous guests because I checked out? IHG style...

msg:🚗 Transportation: The core location of Jinan's business, downstairs is the highest-end shopping mall in Jinan, where various luxury brands gather, and Henglong and Kuanhouli are next to it. It is definitely the most suitable place for tourism and shopping.

🧹Sanitation: The overall sanitation of the room is well cleaned.

🍃Environment: Although it has been in business for a long time and the decoration style is relatively old-fashioned, the overall environment and a**osphere that a five-star hotel should have is still available. There is a rooftop garden on the roof, where you can see the night view of Jinan.

🔔Service: Jinan Guihe Intercontinental service is really worthy of praise. Before check-in, there will be a special phone reminder, and seriously ask the license plate number to reserve a parking space in advance, tell me the shortcut for check-in, and tell me that I can dine in the executive lounge This is a service that other five-star hotels I have stayed in overlooked. After staying in the hotel, every staff member has a serious working attitude and a great service attitude, and they are patient and careful to inquire about various needs. Although there were some minor accidents during this stay, the emergency attitude and handling methods of the entire hotel management made me feel very heartwarming, and the hotel staff showed concern for us no matter where they went. And among all the hotels we have stayed in during the epidemic, InterContinental is the only hotel that carefully prepares masks for guests. It is really hard.

🍽Dining: The restaurant carefully arranges a children’s activity room in the restaurant, and puts it into consideration for guests with children. It provides convenience and allows adults to eat at ease. This is really worthy of praise. All dishes are carefully covered to ensure the hygiene of the dishes, which is also rare, indicating that the hotel really pays attention to details. In addition, I also want to praise the food of Intercontinental. The dishes taste great. I think it is one of the few delicious buffets!

Summary: Jinan Guihe InterContinental Hotel is a treasure hotel. I truly experience the feeling of being at home. I will continue to stay next time I go!

The breakfast is rich and tastes good. I especially praise Li Wenwen in the restaurant for taking the initiative to care for the children's meals and serving them ravioli personally, which makes people feel warm.

msg:The first time I came to Jinan, I booked Luneng Guihe Intercontinental Hotel on Ctrip. I stayed for two nights. It is very close to Baotu Spring, Furong Street, Quancheng Square, Daming Lake and other attractions. The shopping mall is downstairs, which is very convenient. I ordered lunch and dinner separately in advance, and the service staff called to ask about the meal time before arriving at the hotel, and the arrangement was particularly thoughtful. The buffet lunch ate at the hotel on the day of check-in was rich in dishes, and there was also a dumpling activity for the Dragon Boat Festival. The children had a great time. Special thanks to Zhang Le, the foreman of the restaurant. The service is very warm and attentive. He helps to reserve a table in advance every day. This saves the trouble of bringing two children to wait at the door, and the old mother feels happy. The hotel rooms are spacious, the bedding is tidy, and the service is timely. There will be service confirmation after each service. This is not available in other five-star hotels I have stayed in before. The only disadvantage is that there is no room facing Quancheng Square. The view of the room is poor, no In the past, the night view on the rooftop was also great, and there were singers in residence, which was very pleasant. Finally, thanks to Connie, the hotel's closed-loop service management is excellent and worthy of recommendation.

msg:Let me talk about the hotel facilities first, the facilities and equipment are great, the bed is big enough, the room space is also enough, it is very suitable for bringing children, breakfast and dinner are good, very rich. Let’s talk about the location of the hotel. It’s a shopping mall downstairs, Hang Lung Plaza next door, and Quancheng Plaza and Science and Technology Museum opposite. It is not far from Baotu Spring and Daming Lake on foot, but it’s true that the city center is prone to traffic jams. , The last paragraph always requires walking. Finally, talk about hotel services. The front desk and concierge services are very good and enthusiastic. There are robots delivering food to the room, but in other places such as aisles or elevators, the hotel staff did not say hello or smile to you. There is a gap in other hotels.

msg:The check-in was very fast, the welcome fruit was delivered and the turndown was turned down, and the sanitation was very clean. Here is a small suggestion. Fruits are recommended for the convenience of guests. Dragon fruit and oranges are difficult to split with bare hands. Passengers usually do not carry knives when they go out. Pears have a small hole. The room reminded me that decaffeinated coffee could be provided, and provided masks and disinfectant wipes. The hotel is in an excellent location, within walking distance of major attractions and snack streets, and there are high-end shopping malls and Hang Lung nearby, making it very convenient for shopping for food and travel. After checking out, Connie called to ask if there were any shortcomings. The service can be said to be very meticulous. There is also a small place that is not very compatible with InterContinental's grades. There is no smart toilet. But it does not affect the experience of staying.

msg:這次朋友來濟南玩，訂了濟南洲際酒店，共同入住一晚。總體來説還不錯。

設施：入住之前擔心酒店設施會不會過於老舊，但入住之後感覺還可以。美中不足的是房間智能化不高，沒有智能馬桶等設施，期待後期可以在這方面進行升級。

服務：酒店前台王玲瑋及幾位其他我忘記名字的小姐姐整體服務都很好，從check in到退房都很禮貌周到。酒店一樓大堂幾位負責接待和寄存物品的戴帽子小哥哥也都很友好熱情。需要提高服務意識的是早餐餐廳內的各區廚師，態度比較冷淡，感覺拉低了洲際整體水準。

環境：酒店位置不用多説，老城區核心位置去各大景點都很方便👍🏻 洲際所處位置意味着它必然會是接待外地遊客的頭部酒店之一，某種程度上肩負着濟南五星酒店門面的使命。希望能繼續加油，給外地遊客留下更好印象。

msg:酒店地理位置非常棒，幾個旅遊打卡地都在步行距離內，對於市中心又是交通擁堵城市來説很難得。周邊是一個非常成熟的購物遊玩商圈，正對泉城廣場，景觀很棒。酒店設施設備完善，房間面積比其他酒店要大，我住的都是落地大窗，房間衞生乾淨整潔。酒店服務團隊很用心，質量監督經理Connie提前聯繫給準備了合適房間，前台也是熱情專業，給人很親切的感覺，公區見到的服務員包括維修師父都很禮貌熱情，退房還有回訪電話，生怕客人有遇到問題不好意思提的。整體體驗很好，招待客户自住都是不錯的選擇

酒店房間面積大概50多平，不算小，整體住起來還是很舒服的。打電話要備品什麼的送的也很快。

早餐，表揚下，一進去就有員工領位，然後會送來咖啡或者茶。餐廳負責人侯強先生態度非常好，得知我們當天要退房，還幫忙準備了一些吃的，非常不錯～
早餐的種類非常多，味道也都在線，吃的還是非常滿意的。

總體還是很不錯的一家酒店，下次來濟南的首選。

房間面積挺大，設施稍有老舊，不過維護的還不錯。最重要的一點的是房間乾淨整潔，是五星級該有的樣子，洗漱用品是百瑞德品牌味道和品質都是我喜歡的，這也是我選擇洲際的一個原因
酒店服務很好都很熱情，樓層的大姐見人都會熱情地向家人一樣的打招呼，退房時在大堂有點小意外，遇到一位美女像是管理人員吧，姓魯，很熱情地幫我解決了問題。整體入住體驗超棒，下個月還會來，希望還能遇到各位美女，啊哈哈

還沒有上飛機之前，酒店就已經給我打電話了，詢問了到店時間以及還有什麼要求。等到店後，看着前台辦理人挺多的，就轉身去了行政酒廊去辦卡了，沒來過，跟着指示牌繞啊繞，繞了幾圈終於看到酒廊了。
剛好遇到下午茶，加上路上沒怎麼吃東西，那肯定要吃飽喝足呀！反正演唱會是第二天，於是又開啟了hh，酒足飯飽就出門逛大明湖了。（所以有能力一定要定行政房，酒店的酒廊真的還不錯）
作為濟南數一數二的酒店，硬件設施這塊真的不錯，前台和酒廊的小姐姐們也很專業，有求必應。地段好，服務好。如果打卡可以到這裏來，如果不知道住哪裡，就住這裏！

環境、衞生、早餐都很好，保持了洲際一貫水準。
感謝前台給了免費升級房型，一個雙卧小套間，寶寶第一次自己睡，很安穩，房間很大，設備也很好，還有寶寶專門的洗漱用品浴袍拖鞋，因為高鐵時刻辦理了延住，也愉快的幫忙協調了，特別感謝前台人美心善的ElenaGao高晴小姐姐，給了我很多幫助，耐心解釋疑問。
總體，值得一住！期待下次去濟南再見！

服務：酒店服務很好，符合甚至超於五星標準。入住前會有專門服務人員對接房型喜好，很貼心的升級到了套房並送上歡迎水果。由於我的粗心退房把圍巾忘到房間了 總機小董不厭其煩的幫我快遞到家 非常感謝！！

酒店大堂在7樓，如果房間在B座需要倒電梯。

房間確實比較舊了，乾淨程度還可以吧。

首先是地理位置：酒店旁邊是恆隆，走路2分鐘。對面芙蓉街，穿過去是曲水亭街，再往前走就到大明湖了，溜溜達達20分鐘就到了。酒店到趵突泉打滴滴6塊錢，非常划算了。從酒店可以看見泉城廣場的噴泉。
其次是衞生：非常乾淨，我一般是不用酒店的水杯的，但是這次實在是太乾淨了，可以説手能摸到的地方都是一塵不染的。帶孩子入住這一點我非常滿意！
早晨在餐廳用餐，高峯時期有服務人員幫我們找座位，還有小丑叔叔給孩子們扎氣球，非常好的體驗。早餐很值了，跟着房間一起訂的，算下來才不到80一個人，內容很豐富，品種也多。
服務真真好，門口有免費水可以拿，還有很好看的春節佈景，下次來還會選擇洲際！！！

我最近才回到國內工作，在北京和煙台出差很多，一直都住在萬豪旗下的westin和萬豪，但是都沒有過這樣的服務，而且這兩個月內我在萬豪雖然還沒到鑽石會員，但累計的晚數也不少了，就沒有一次會幫我主動升級的。我主動問到他們説要加錢才行。反而我幾年沒有住ihg的酒店了，這次因為洲際的服務讓我決定之後要多住ihg的酒店。退房時賬單訊息也一再跟我確認，特別有耐心。

也吐槽一下，北京的westin和煙台的westin的前台跟洲際的前台簡直沒法比，他們像機器人一樣，完全感覺不到對工作的熱愛。煙台的westin結賬時賬單訊息有錯，我助理花了兩週時間又發郵件又打電話都聯繫不上，還是找了westin總部才給解決。

真是沒有對比就沒有傷害。

msg:洲際酒店住了很多，濟南魯能貴和洲際酒店還是第一次，這次來山東讓我真切的感受到了“好客山東歡迎您”。酒店把客户關懷做到了前面，還沒入住的時候就通過電話瞭解客户需求，尤其是質量監督經理Connie，詳細瞭解了我們的住房要求，並且幫我們升級了客房，給小朋友送了小禮物。CRM前置的確是值得學習，總比事後給客人賠禮道歉強。酒店位置絕佳，三公里就能覆蓋濟南趵突泉、大明湖、千佛山，是親子旅遊不二之選。

服務很好，大堂經理妮蔻（英文名記不住）提前主動聯繫，給免費升級了房間，還送了孩子小禮物。
酒店附近有一處工地，舊樓房拆除，噪音很大，我們申請了換房間。
自助早餐是日式餐廳，種類不少，但沒什麼可吃的。

離店的時候 前台一個女生説 不會當場退你按金的 我們要查房看損耗 半小時後之後才會弄 
咱就是説 出門都是五星級 儘量商務艙 房費600按金1000真的不至於那麼怕被盜搶
經理Andy倒是非常貼心一直積極解決問題和溝通 不然我真的直接一分
房間破 前台破

msg:這是一條沒有被350元買斷的真實評價！由於酒店設立時間較久、設施老舊是可以被諒解的問題，但！在濟南昨夜室外温度零下十度的寒冬，客人被冷的整晚和衣而眠，全程不敢洗澡，早上已經不斷流鼻涕疑似感冒。
1:酒店洗漱全程沒有熱水！（無論早晚，在冷水完全關閉熱水開到最大，仍舊卻一直是冷水狀態，甚至達不到温水）
2:空調設定製熱最高32度的情況下，整晚吹的都是冷風！
3:房間明確設立了“請勿打擾”標識！攜程標識本該中午兩點退房，卻在中午一點左右服務員就持續敲門不斷催促打擾退房，詢問是否續費房態。
4:酒店地下停車場入口異常難找，需要到另一條街道，並且期間幾乎無明顯標識，像迷宮一樣，並且電梯無法直達酒店房間樓層，還要轉乘電梯。
作為全濟南最知名的酒店之一，理應代表着泉城的臉面和口碑，我們懷着這種想法選擇貴店，卻給予我們招待的外賓及其詫異糟糕的入住體驗，這讓我們非常失望面對客人也非常尷尬！
事後工作人員聯合工程部門去房間證實了我們提出的問題屬實後，提出了退房費一半的解決方案，被我們拒絕，因為我相信每一位選擇洲際的客人，都不會因為這點賠償，去讓孩子家人以及客人冒着感冒生病的風險，去承受整晚糟糕的煎熬。

msg:入住濟南洲際是返鄉旅遊最好的體驗沒有之一，我們在經歷了600一晚的尚泉歷舍民宿下水反味空調失靈後，果斷選擇退房入住洲際。
酒店的賓客關係服務很到位，Connie提前電聯確認到店時間及需求，縮短了前台check in時間，inroll的操作也很自然迅速，不會給客户不適感。房務部部門間聯動很好，房間內也有同事準備歡迎卡片及備品。
ADD的餐食同價位中算不錯，個別甜品出品很精緻，住店客人用晚餐比**還便宜哦，特別一提是值得花錢加早的，早餐精緻程度不輸三亞酒店。
房間設施也是意料之中的優秀，地暖温度剛剛好，淋浴水壓穩定出水即熱，説明雖然酒店不再嶄新但設施設備管理做的很好。
特別值得一提的是禮賓部的周文康，離店時我們將行李寄存在一樓，隨口説了一句想要去7樓拿停車票，返回取行李的時候他已經幫我們去7樓拿好了，這個服務意識屬實是震驚到我，簡直是把hospitality刻腦子裡，值得表揚。
整體入住體驗就四個字：周到自然。各個部門的服務內容挑不出錯，服務銜接非常流暢。前酒店人給你們大大的點個贊～

保安部韓元福先生幫我們積極調整車位，還幫忙我們放行李。感謝。
就是節假日的濟南不愧為擠難，進城出城都得需要點耐心。

1）地理位置很好：離大明湖，趵突泉，芙蓉街，泉城廣場等都很近，都是步行就可以到達。

2）早餐很豐盛，味道也很可口。

3）房間十分的乾淨和整潔。

4）服務態度尤其好，特別是總機張穎。我有衣服落在了酒店，她第一天給我打電話的時候沒有接到，第二天又給我打了電話並且幫我寄了回來，十分感謝！

酒店裝修風格大氣，辦理入住在7樓，中空大堂寬敞明亮，因為經理Connie都提前按要求安排好了時間，大大節省了辦理入住時間，前台服務也不錯，微笑服務很專業。這次房間給安排的星奇寶貝房，房間安靜整潔，也很安靜，孩子喜歡的不得了，還能遠觀大明湖，很遺憾時間緊張衹住了一晚下次有機會再來體驗。

環境：在泉城廣場對面，濟南最貴奢侈品商場的 7 樓往上。本來是開車來旅遊想找個位置便利的，結果酒店門口不能卸行李不能停車，要把車開很遠到-2 才可以
服務：在 7 樓辦理入住後給了兩張房卡結果一個也不能用，我們帶着孩子在房間門口等了半個小時也沒給送上來
要想到一樓，要先坐酒店的電梯到 7 樓然後轉商場電梯才能下去😂
衞生：房間有窗户但是不能開，一打開門又悶又潮很不舒服
小童洗漱用品也就是衹有牙刷和拖鞋，這麼貴的酒店竟然沒有套裝，真是讓我大跌眼鏡👎mini 吧的所有東西都是收費的，花 900 塊錢住的 5 星級酒店真的最差的一次體驗💔

衞生：這個還是不錯的。
環境：不錯，畢竟老市區，住過幾個大酒店，也不知道咋的，走廊燈光都是暗暗的。
服務：這個沒的説，行李什麼的不用自己搬。

再説一點缺點，希望細節上再做好一點。一是checkin的時間人多排隊，但前台個別工作人員，業務生疏，辦理速度特別慢；辦理入住的時候問我，我這個房型都住滿了，衹有一個窗户小的房間了，可以接受嗎？我説我希望想要一個正常的房間。最後給我升級了。這個感受就很不好，我是提前預訂，又不是臨時去的，為什麼跟我説衹剩一個條件差的房間，看我能不能接受，往大了説是變相佔我便宜嗎？不如直接就給我升房，心裏感覺舒服。另外一個細節就是，我去過不少城市，在很多酒店點了外賣都會主動安排機器人送餐，這家也有機器人，都沒有體驗這個服務，畢竟是洲際，略有遺憾。
希望以後做的更好！

美中不足的是前台的工作。這次付費訂了前兩晚，積分兑換了最後一晚，入住時前台與我做好了2+1晚住宿的確認。但最後一天晚上回房間休息，驚奇的發現門卡不再能打開房間，雖然很是疲憊，但也衹好下到前台樓層溝通，前台重新開卡後才得以再次進入房間。

msg:服務不錯，因為返程航班推遲，給予了免費延遲退房。為客房送餐送水速度都很快。
客房設施蠻好，就是洗手枱單台盆有點落伍了。訂了兩間觀景房，其中一間升級了，朝南正對泉城廣場，朝西面向恆隆廣場，兩面牆都有大幅落地窗，觀景確實很好，腳下就是護城河，晚上泉城廣場音樂噴泉一覽無餘。
美中不足的是，這間房由於西曬，入住三天裏房間温度一直難以下降，始終在27攝氏度以上。向前台提出後，酒店派工程人員來檢查了空調，並願意換房，但是孩子喜歡這間的景觀，所以就忍受了這個温度。後來酒店送來一台冷風機，雖然降不了温，也算是一片心意了。
建議酒店對921房進行鍼對性改造，改善玻璃窗隔熱性能，否則實在是浪費了這間景觀好房。
其他諸如地理位置、餐飲服務等都不錯，頂層啤酒花園發現晚了，沒來得及去體驗。
瑕不掩瑜，來濟南無論是旅遊還是商務，這間洲際都還是值得優先選擇的。

有夜床服務，比較貼心，服務人員都很友好，見面主動問好，住的很舒心！
去了酒店的康體中心遊泳，人不多，但是泳池比較深，小朋友要注意帶好泳圈之類的，救生員超負責，不停的在巡視，沖澡的地方是單間，唯一不好的就是吹風機，女士長髮是噩夢！

msg:地段很棒，在濟南最繁華的泉城路上，離大明湖和趵突泉很近，前台小姐姐小華免費給我升級湖景房，很貼心的送了果盤，給孩子還準備了禮物。
房間很大，床特別舒服，原來計劃住一晚的，看到這麼貼心的服務果斷住了兩晚。
希望辦理入住的小哥哥仔細點，本來兩份早餐的變成一份了，加油

美中不足就是床太軟了，但是與前台反應後第一時間兩位服務員就來將床墊翻了過來
總而言之，貴和洲際酒店是一家我願意推薦給朋友和家人的優秀酒店，期待未來有機會再次入住貴和洲際酒店。

設施：酒店雖然已開業多年，設施設備維護情況不錯，雖然沒有什麼智能化的設備。
環境：坐落在濟南核心商圈，離大明湖和趵突泉都很近，體力好的走走可到。樓下就是濟南最高端的商場，LV、Gucci基本不用排隊，很多熱門款也可以看到。隔壁就是做的比較一般的恆隆了。
服務：入住前台服務熱情，有求必應。離店退房順利，全程無槽點。特別推薦Eline小姐姐，和藹可親，服務周到。

  住這個酒店，我感受到的是滿滿的誠意。
1:在攜程訂完房，收到了酒店部門Cody小姐姐打開的電話詢問具體住店事項，因為我要延遲到五點退房，Cody幫我提前留好房間安排好了備註訊息和交接，於是到前台了輕鬆辦理了入住訊息不説，還驚喜的被通知到我訂的大床房可以免費升級到更貴一百多塊錢行政大床房，因為早就知道貴和洲際酒店的美名，知道貴和洲際酒店經常體貼合理的在房間空餘條件允許的情況下為客人免費升級房型，讓客人能有空間更大更舒適的愉快體驗，衹是沒想到自己會成為這個幸運鵝~感恩的心~~
2:辦理完入住了，到了房間突然想到一會兒出去見律師，要將寫好的感謝信找個信封裝起來。可是哪有信封呢，抱着期望的態度打開房間抽屜，立刻看到兩個擺放整齊的信封，驚喜不已。將信裝好，下午見到律師將感謝信遞了出去，增進了我們的友誼，感謝！！！
3:就吃個早餐的功夫，因為訂了延遲退房，早上吃早餐跟保潔員宋勝玲姐姐説了一下麻煩空了打掃一下，阿姨説現在就去為您打掃，等我吃完飯回房間，發現房間不僅乾淨整潔一絲不苟的收拾好了，阿姨還幫我把衣服疊好了，退房的時候，阿姨還親切的説了聲再見，謝謝您宋阿姨！
4:以前光知道洲際酒店用心温暖每一位客人，直到今天看到酒店用心準備的新鮮花籃，手寫卡片（我衹是訂了個最普通的大床房）我才覺得貴和洲際酒店是在用心把每一個細節和服務做到最好，物超所值！謝謝~
多餘的話不説，下次濟南出差依舊選擇貴和洲際酒店，五星好評不成敬意，期待下次邂逅~

Not only did he give us fruit, but he also delayed our check-out until 3 p.m., filling my regretful mood with some warmth, professionalism and dedication. Like it👍. Secondly, let’s talk about breakfast. The staff in the breakfast depar**ent are very hard-working, and the work intensity is relatively high. They clean up the dishes and cups in a timely manner. Unfinished fruit, bread, etc. are allowed to be packed. I also told Jinan that the weather is hot and the items will deteriorate quickly. Responsibility, serious work, praise 👍. Finally, I would like to praise Connie, the quality supervision manager, because of her thoughtful service, we stayed for another night, upgraded our room, gave the children toys, and fruits. In short, it gave us a good picture of our stay in Jinan Intercontinental Hotel A beautiful symbol!

Several major shopping malls are lined up next to each other, which is very prosperous. When entering the hotel, you can see a few very polite welcome guests , The first reception was Connie, the quality supervision manager, who is beautiful and enthusiastic. The 7th floor is the check-in counter. The room is very comfortable. You can see the very bustling street and passers-by outside the floor-to-ceiling windows. Connie recommended me the roof of the 12th floor. It was a very good experience to have dinner at the open-air beer hall upstairs. The night view is beautiful, crayfish beer 🍺 and there are many guests who are very lively. When you want to go shopping, you don’t need to take a taxi to play around for a long time. InterContinental Hotel is satisfied My various needs, as well as the enthusiasm and responsibility of the quality supervision manager Connie and all the staff, oh yes, the InterContinental Hotel is very close to Baotu Spring and Daming Lake, every time I go to Jinan, I will stay at the InterContinental Hotel.

還在高鐵上就接到了酒店的歡迎電話，電話裏介紹了酒店情況，並給做了早餐位置的預留。
到店後辦理入住時給升級了房型，早餐時夏宜暄先生主動問候，表示看到我今天退房，還帶了孩子，給了一份點心餐包，留作路上食用。下午因高鐵時間較晚，嘗試與前台溝通最晚退房時間，前台小月姑娘主動幫我把退房時間延遲到了16點。
從未有過的尊貴體驗，服務做到這種程度，不由得心生敬佩，簡直就是舒爾茨先生所著的《像紳士淑女一樣服務》的典範，做為顧客，在與酒店員工有限的接觸點上，都將顧客感受放在了首位，並給足了驚喜，如果一個點上的驚喜是員工的個人優秀，那麼一連串的驚喜則是酒店的管理出色。
謝謝魯能貴和洲際

前台有個短髮的小姑娘特別熱情 還有一個短髮的小夥子 最後一天延遲退房出門辦事回來發現房卡用不了看到我着急 剛協助完客人排隊後立刻幫我！

非常非常棒的購物體驗但忘記拍照是最大的遺憾，期待下一次的入住！

msg:入住體驗很棒，辦理快説的細，Cony小姐姐超級有耐心，酒店環境衞生都不錯，周圍的商場很好逛，外賣逛街都很方便。交通真是一大亮點，到周圍每個景點都是10分鐘的步行距離，特別完美，這麼熱的天可以去一個景點回酒店休息一下續個命，如果有時間真得多住幾天，這次行程太倉促啦，下次來濟南還會住洲際～
