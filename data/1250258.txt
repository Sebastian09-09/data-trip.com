But it’s even not reaching the 55 M2. The bathroom is very small without bathtub, there is even no mirror in the bathroom. In the hotel there is no pool, no roof terrace, no garden, no any area you relaxing. It’s not a 5 stars Hotel.  Good thing is the employees are friendly and helpful.

I have never experienced this in my entire life or at any hotel. Second, all drainage from the bathroom sink will flow directly into the shower via a pipe. How unhygienic is this?
Third, as there are 32 floors but only 3 small elevators to be used, you need to wait everytime at least 10 minutes until you arrive at your room. And you compete with the countless delivery guys. I will never stay here again.

The only complaint is that the water in shower drained slowly so the bath room is flooded if we don't end our shower quickly enough. The hotel switched us to another room but we still had the same issue. It appears to be the design problem in the drainage.

The experience is really good, the room is very spacious, and a family of three will not feel crowded. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the main privacy protection is very good. The toilet is very hidden. After staying for a whole day, I did not find any place that was not cleaned, and the hair dryer was blowing. It's very powerful but the location is hard to find. It also has a movable makeup mirror which is very convenient. The room service is fast and toiletries, water and the like are delivered right away. We bought the breakfast ourselves at the restaurant. The price of 68 yuan was quite reasonable. My child didn't have to pay for it. The variety was very rich and self-service. My wife rarely ate breakfast but she ate a lot. The sugary and oily cakes and stinky tofu were a bit unpleasant. Authentic. Speaking of facilities, there are gyms, laundry rooms, and parking lots, but they are not very complete. The gym has a good view of the Xiangjiang River, but there are few equipment inside. The laundry room is very convenient with washing and drying, but there is no laundry service. After playing outside for a whole day, I walked all the way to wash it myself. I was very tired and couldn't rest. I waited for two hours to wait for the clothes to be washed. The free parking lot was very small and shared by many hotels, making it a mess. The front desk service is really good, they are soft-spoken and soft-spoken. Thank you Butler Xiaolong for your attentive service. He gave me a very detailed travel guide. He also prepared a fruit plate and Hunan specialties👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

msg:Changsha is a city that never sleeps. The hotel is opposite the Orange Island scenic area and very close to the subway station. Line 2 can reach Orange Island in one stop, and Line 2 can reach Changsha South Station and then transfer to the subway to Huanghua Airport. Floor-to-ceiling glass windows provide excellent views. It is very close to Pozi Street, May Day Square, Super Wenheyou, and Du Fu Jiangge. In addition, you can ride a bicycle to various attractions. Bicycles such as Hello** are prohibited from parking near the hotel.
The night view light show on Xiangjiang Middle Road is one of the best in the country.
I think it is a good choice to consider staying in the Exotic Impression IFC when traveling from the perspective of food, accommodation and transportation.

msg:I changed my itinerary temporarily and decided to stay in Changsha for one night. I booked this hotel considering it was close to the subway station. The lobby was very messy and there were many delivery people. There must be many restaurants upstairs. The people were noisy and I had to wait for a long time for the elevator. I booked in a hurry and there were no room types to choose from, so the only room available was a twin room. It's very depressing when you enter. The furniture is very old. Opposite is a dilapidated residential building. The bathroom is very small. What's ridiculous is that it comes with a toilet seat with a disposable plastic bag. It's the first time I've seen such a cheap thing. The washbasin has no mirror and is just a block. Transparent glass, and a rusty mirror placed on the desk. Haha, this is a room booked for nearly 700 yuan. The facilities in this room outside cost only 300 yuan. Would not stay here again nor recommend. Except for the geographical environment, there is nothing good about it.

The three of us walked to Orange Island, haha, the main feature is that young people are not afraid of things...

msg:Location and transportation: If you’re visiting Changsha for two days, if you’re not familiar with the place, stay near the subway station. You’ll be fine. I looked at a lot of stores online and selected this one because it is close to the subway, near the renovation time, has high reviews, and is close to the check-in point. The store is quite close to the Xiangjiang Middle Road subway exit of Line 2, and is on the road along the river. There are many hotels here, but this location is relatively easy to find. Service: When registering at the front desk, I saw that I brought my children and gave them snacks. When leaving the hotel, I also asked about my stay experience and was given mineral water to drink on the way, which I felt was quite considerate. Room view, the room is on the 21st floor. Although you can't see the river, you can see the city view in the center of Changsha. It has good sanitary facilities and new facilities. The air conditioning effect and hot water supply are very fast. Value for money: This price is good value for money. Just a short walk along the river is Hisense Plaza, where you can visit Wenheyou. In the evening, go further along the river to Du Fu Jiang Pavilion, take photos, check in, and listen to the band's performance. Just across the back is Taiping Street, which is very convenient.

There is free tea in the lobby on the first floor. Before coming here, I was worried because there were many negative reviews in the reviews, but when I actually checked in, I felt very good. Except for the strong "life a**osphere" outside the window, fortunately, my sleep quality was very good and it didn't affect me. Overall, I will come again. .

I thought it was a single-family house and didn’t take pictures of the rooms. I was embarrassed to take pictures. Poor, old, the table in the entrance room was not wiped. It costs 800 for a room, so Orange Island must have contributed 680. Ctrip’s 5⭐ is really a scam. The elevator is old and broken, and the half-hour wait is about the same as in an office building. I decided to change hotels today! ! ! The glass was very dirty.

We chose an Egyptian-style room, which is indeed very Egyptian! The decoration of the hotel is also relatively luxurious, the breakfast room is beautiful, the breakfast food is rich, and the front desk staff is very polite. A little suggestion: Elderly people are not suitable to choose an Egyptian-style room, because the bed is on a relatively high step from other areas, making it easy for them to step up when they get up at night. The design of the room is a bit inconsiderate, the toilet door can only be opened halfway, and the TV is hanging in the air, which will cause tall people to bump their heads. In addition, there is only one chair in the room, and you can only sit on the bed, which is not convenient. The TV system uses Tianyi (Telecom) network, and the network is unstable. The suggestion has been informed to the front desk. It is just a friendly reminder. The overall check-in experience is good.

Contact me, very considerate and thoughtful service! The room has a strong sense of design and complete facilities. It is very convenient to go to Wuyi Square and Pozi Street. The Line 2 subway station is also just opposite the hotel. Overall, it is a very good hotel! Recommended to travelers visiting Changsha!

msg:First of all, before I checked in, I received a call from the service manager of the Exotic Impression Hotel, asking me about the room type of the reserved room. He also asked me carefully if we had any special requirements. He asked the guest very considerately if he had any special requirements and if he needed anything. It is necessary to prepare children's toiletries and make it non-smoking. This is a very surprising and surprising thing for guests who book the hotel. Although I have stayed in other hotels before, Exotic Impression has done this very carefully. The staff added my WeChat account and sent me all the room types in advance without me checking in. After making arrangements, they patiently introduced the styles and differences of each floor throughout the process, and gave me their contact information and address. He told us that if we have any questions, we can contact him immediately. If we have any questions about the room, we can contact him. The staff who checked in at the hotel front desk were also very warm and thoughtful. Xiao Zhou, the Aegean Service Ambassador who added WeChat, also received us at the front desk and handled the check-in. During our stay, we were told in a comprehensive manner that the children's playpen in the room had been installed and the room had been smoke-free. We were also very considerate and asked if we needed help carrying our luggage up. After arriving in the room, the hotel also specially One of the return visitors asked if the room arrangement was satisfactory. Of course, there were some minor incidents on the first night of check-in. After returning to the room, there might be a slight smell due to the humid weather. I also had rhinitis, so I contacted the reporter in the evening. Zhou told me about the situation in the room. When Xiao Zhou received my feedback, he immediately solved the problem and apologized. He sincerely apologized for what happened to us. He also changed the room to a new one and was very patient with the questions raised by the guests. They answered and dealt with each one one by one. When changing to a new room, they kept asking me if I was satisfied with the room situation. In fact, whenever I communicated with Xiao Zhou on WeChat to respond to questions, she always responded to the guest as soon as possible, even though she was already off work. Time is still communicating with me on WeChat. For this reason, I also feel that the hotel’s service truly puts guests first, cares very much about the needs of guests, and will not be perfunctory. I just casually said that I have rhinitis, Xiao Zhou also asked me on WeChat if I need the hotel to send some masks to the room when I go out for fun. He was really attentive. This time I went to the hotel in Changsha and it was okay. Although there were some interruptions, they were all solved very well. The service of the hotel is good and the professional skills are very good. The river view room is also very beautiful to take pictures. It is very convenient to travel anywhere.

msg:A very satisfying stay experience. I chose a full river view room specifically to take the night view of the last photo. Before checking in, I told the lady at the front desk that I wanted a room with a high floor and close to the bridge, and she arranged it in no time. It was super nice!
The hotel is close to the Xiangjiang-Juzizhou Bridge, next to Taiping Old Street and Hisense Plaza. It is very convenient to check in on foot❗️
The room facilities are good. The big bed is very comfortable. If I didn't have to get up early to play, I wouldn't want to get up. The hot bath is also very comfortable. The water pressure was normal when I checked in👌
If there are points to be deducted, one is that the plug in the bathtub is broken and cannot be blocked, and the other is that there are really many people in the elevator during peak hours❗️
Wen Heyou had a long queue in the evening, so he finally ordered takeout to be delivered to the room. While admiring the night view, he ate garlic crab and made a cup of black tea. It was really relaxing~~~~
Special thanks to the Ambassador of Rome. I am really satisfied with the room arrangement. My trip was a complete success❗️❗️

msg:I chose this hotel because Ctrip recommended a five-star and five-diamond hotel. Let me tell you about the conditions of the two rooms I booked:
Room 2219:
I came to Changsha with eager joy, but I didn’t expect to be greatly disappointed when it came to accommodation!
The overall decoration and grade of this hotel, including the a**osphere, are not the five-star or five-diamond standard recommended by Ctrip. It is actually much lower!
There were 3 bottles of toiletries, 2 of which were of the same category, and 1 was empty. No shampoo was provided. It was only delivered after communicating with the guest room.
The cleaning, cleanliness of towels and mattresses is even worse.
When I checked out, the front desk was willing to refund my room fee of 600 yuan, and gave me tea and asked me to cancel the order on Ctrip and give up the evaluation!
But I don’t want more people to be deceived without conscience just because of this small profit!
Friends who want to book this hotel, please pay attention and avoid it! bypass! bypass!
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Room 2225:
I was searching for a five-star hotel on Ctrip, and this one was recommended! The actual stay experience is barely 3 stars!
The overall space and decoration of the room are low and damp, making it very uncomfortable. The toilet space is so small that a girl with a height of 163cm would not have enough space to go to the toilet without tilting her body and head while standing in front of the toilet!
When I had a very bad check-in experience, I asked the front desk of the hotel what the star rating was, and the answer I got was: We are a Ctrip Five Diamond hotel!
I believe everyone has been fooled by such word games, and probably understands what it means.
On the first day I checked in, I found that the towels were not clean and could not be used. Because it was late and I was tired, I gave it up and didn't care.
The next day was even more outrageous. The towels were replaced with dirty towels that had been used by other people and were sticky and had hair stuck to them!
There was other people's hair under the pillow on the bed, it was so disgusting!
The cotton swabs placed in the cleaning bag in the room were all used. I don’t know how to describe how disgusting I felt at that time!
I called the manager on duty and said that the room aunt was not cleaning carefully and offered a discount on the room rate.
When checking out, the front desk asked us to accept a 10% discount on the room rate. In addition, when answering Ctrip's return call, they asked us to cancel the order. No more comments can be made.
I just want tourists like me who have finally had the opportunity to relax to avoid having such a terrible experience on their hard-earned vacation!

msg:A very bad stay experience, I will never go there again next time, avoid lightning.
1. It doesn’t matter if there is no signal in the room, and the wifi cannot connect to the Internet.
2. The breakfast is all cold, the chicken wings are cold, and the fried rice is cold.
3. The elevator is very slow. I have to wait for 10 minutes for all 4 elevators. I don’t understand how to set them up.
4. Before checking in, the front desk asked what my room requirements were. I said it was far away from the elevator, but when I checked in, it was a room away from the elevator. Is this called staying away from the elevator? I laughed.
4. The bathroom is super small and there is no table to put the mobile phone.
5. It's very noisy. The hotel is on the side of the road. If you want to see the river view, you have to lean on the road. It's very noisy.
6. The service response is slow and no service will be provided without prompting. I asked to change rooms and waited for ten minutes before I came over. The attitude was not very good and they said the poor signal was due to your mobile phone. Well, it’s time for me to change my phone. This is the attitude of the service industry.

msg:Although the room is big enough, the hotel elevator is a nigh**are. There are 20 rooms on the first floor and only 4 elevators on the 31st floor (one of which is a freight elevator). You can imagine that you will be suffocated every time you take the elevator. It turns out that it should be positioned as an apar**ent hotel. It's really not worth it without breakfast at 1900. There is no supporting gym or swimming pool. Downstairs, there is a main road and a mess of street stalls. The noise starts at 8 a.m. and ends at 10 p.m. The location is said to be convenient in the business district, but it is only within walking distance. If you want to go further, calling a taxi will be a hassle. It is recommended that families with elderly and children stick to the Intercontinental ones.

msg:Poor. On the day we checked in, it happened to be a hot day. The air conditioners in all three of our rooms were broken. After inspection, the maintenance staff told us that the air conditioners could not cool the air. This made us sleepless at night and could not fall asleep all night until breakfast the next day. , in the restaurant, I also learned that other guests also had a bad sleep due to air conditioning problems and the poor quality of the hotel, so they would no longer stay. The most unacceptable nonsense was that the front desk manager told them that because they were in other rooms, Some elderly people were afraid of the cold, so they turned off the central air conditioner. After repeated requests to change rooms or check out, she was unable to do so. She could only keep pushing and shoving. After the general manager of the hotel arrived, she moved us to three rooms on the 26th floor, but it was enough. It took half a day, and we couldn't make it to all the scenic spots we had reserved. Therefore, this trip made our family very disappointed!

Especially the toilet in the bathroom, please ask the hotel owner and designer (if there is one) to squat down and try it yourself. **To use the toilet, it must be veneered against the wall. It is simply ridiculous. A room like this is so expensive. And the breakfast, there is simply no way to evaluate it with voice. The polite thing is that there are rave reviews on the platform. I really can’t live with these fake brands.

The house price during the Chinese New Year is more than 1,000 yuan, which is more expensive than Marriott. To be honest, the price-performance ratio is really average. I think it is only worth about 700 yuan during the holidays.
I only represent my own feelings, benevolent people have different views on benevolence, and the wise have different opinions. My evaluation based on my own experience is definitely not to criticize this hotel.

It is Super Wenheyouhe Du Fujiang Pavilion is very close to the attractions. We chose a Japanese-style floor for the room. It was clean and not particularly stunning.

Let’s take our clothes off. After washing, they dried it for us, folded it and put it in a bag, which is very considerate. There is not enough water every day, so you can get it from them. We stayed for three days in total, and the auntie cleaner would come to clean it every day.

Hygiene: I didn't see any problems. The weather is hot. I saw that there was still mineral water in the elevator hall. It was very thoughtful.
Environment: It’s for their river view room, as expected, the view is nothing to say. You can directly see the entire Xiangjiang River and Orange Island...
Service: I took a sneak shot of Gu Liang who was wearing Hanfu at the front desk. The service was good and he was very enthusiastic. He kept wandering in the lobby. When I checked in, I also gave ice cream and Changsha's fun strategy guide, like it!
There are a lot of people during the summer vacation. I have seen several hotels before, and they have stayed in another one, but it is a bit far from the city center. I am afraid that there will be no good arrangements for bringing friends. This time it is complete, and friends will still recommend them when they come down.

Xiao Zhou warmly greeted and received me, and patiently checked the room situation for me. I arranged a room with a full river view. It turned out that I could only see half of it. There are many styles of rooms I am too lazy to choose a style, so I asked Xiao Zhou to help me arrange it. Xiao Zhou patiently showed me the theme style of the room and asked me to choose one I like. He was very patient throughout the whole process, always smiling, [强] [Strong] [Strong] I chose a room randomly and checked in. The hotel facilities were introduced carefully and comprehensively at that location. If you are in trouble, just ask if you can change it. It’s okay, it’s okay. Who knows that Xiao Zhou quickly replied to me on WeChat [太阳][阳光], and chose a new style to check in. Since we were outside, she also kindly informed my aunt Helped us to change the luggage. I was really sorry. It was late at that time. Xiao Zhou was still helping me at the front desk after work. He was really dedicated. He also kept contacting me on WeChat. Remember to go to the front desk when you come back With the room card, you can contact her as soon as you have any problems with the room. This is really worthy of praise. Hahahahaha, next time you come to a foreign hotel, you will find Xiao Zhou.

A piece of glass actually exposed itself! The shower head kept leaking, and cold water kept dripping on me when I took a shower! The glass partition is full of water stains! There is no separate Wi-Fi in the room, and the public Wi-Fi network is extremely poor, so there is no way but to consume data

Service: The service of the lady at the front desk is very good. We arrived at 5:00 p.m., but the room hadn’t been cleaned yet. She was afraid that we would have to stand and wait, so she gave us afternoon tea coupons to wait in the restaurant, although the afternoon tea was very, very special generally. When we left the store, the lobby manager kept asking us how our experience was. He was very enthusiastic and even gave us a small gift!
Environment: Next to the river, the sound insulation effect of the windows is average, so the noise of singing and dancing by the river is still very loud.

Advantages: The location is superior, the transportation is very convenient, the room is spacious, the scenery is good, the bed is big enough for family trips, the buckwheat pillow is replaced for a more comfortable sleep, the breakfast is rich, and there is enough free bottled water.
Disadvantages: Because the room on the south side is close to Xiangjiang Sightseeing Street, the noise of music and singing is loud before 22 o'clock in the evening. The elevator is shared by the whole building and the waiting time is long, and the staff is relatively messy. Sewers are prone to clogging.

However, the room window on the 5th floor It's broken, it can't be closed at all, and the wind is blowing there. The front desk moved us to the 12th floor. I changed rooms three times in one day, and my words were inconsistent. They said there were only rooms on the 5th floor, but there were also rooms on the 12th floor. It has been raining and very cold in Changsha these past two days. It is said that there is no heating air conditioning, only cold air conditioning.

It's only about 5 minutes' walk from the subway station. The reserved Japanese-style room is clean and tidy, with a little taste of tatami. The bed and pillows are very comfortable. Electric curtains and takeaways are also delivered to the room by robots. A bit of a fashion element. The river view seen from the room is also beautiful, and I personally think it is worth recommending.

msg:The hotel is very good, it feels better after changing the name and redecorating! This time I chose the whole river view on the first floor. I lived on the 29th floor, with a Japanese-style bedroom. The room was clean, the space was large enough, and the bedding was very comfortable. My daughter was so happy, haha... It feels so good to be on the 29th floor , Looking at the whole Xiangjiang River, with the lights at night, it is beautiful.
The location of the hotel is very convenient. From the east exit of Changsha South Railway Station, take the escalator directly to the B1 floor and take Changsha Metro Line 2 (Xiangjiang Middle Road Station Exit 1) to exit the station. After passing the traffic lights at the station entrance, walk 50 meters to the right. About 10 meters away is the hotel. The subway time is about 25 minutes. This Metro Line 2 is simply an important transportation hub leading to popular scenic spots. It is also very, very convenient to transfer to Line 1, Line 3, and Line 4.
Go left at the entrance of the hotel, there is an authentic Hunan restaurant at the first intersection (Old Street Yuzui-Changsha Main Store), and the second intersection is Hisense Plaza (Super Wenheyou), enter this road and go straight for 200 meters and you will be well-known Laizi Street, Taiping Street, Sanxing Street, everything you want to eat and buy is here. At the intersection of Hisense Plaza (opposite on the same side), there is Quji crayfish. The food is very, very good, especially the little blue dragon, which is clean, big and extremely delicious! The stinky tofu is also very authentic. A cup of tea every day is also essential for a pleasant look. I think Orchid Latte is the best. This time I couldn't stop eating. I really want to eat again... I'm just a snack, haha...
The following is the itinerary of the shared attractions:
1. From Metro Line 2 to Juzizhou, it takes only one station. The exit is directly Juzizhou. There is a small train and a stone bust of Chairman Mao. The environment is also like a green park. If you have time and interest, you can also go to Orange Isle. Take a night cruise on the Xiangjiang River on a cruise ship in Zhouzhou.
2, Line 2 to Wuyi Square, Huangxing Square, Wangfujing Depar**ent Store, IFS International Financial Center (the 2 bears who clocked in are on the platform on the 7th floor, go up with the escalator), it takes 2-3 stops, You can use WeChat to buy subway tickets, and the fee is not expensive, about 2-4 yuan. By the way, you can also swipe the Lingnantong transportation card in the subway, which is very convenient.
3. Yangfan Night Market, Exit 1, Renmin East Road, Metro Line 2, turn around and see a **Sega Hotel (the asterisk means I forgot those 2 words, forgive me), walk 600 meters along the road next to the hotel, turn left The night market is over. The subway fee is 3 yuan. The night market has food, entertainment, and shopping. I tried stinky tofu, lemon tea, grilled squid tendrils, freshly cut and grilled beef skewers, salt and pepper prawns and mantis prawns. I regret not buying more.
4. Yuelu Academy, take Metro Line 2 for 2 stops to Yuwan Town Station, transfer to Line 4 to Exit 2 of Hunan University, walk straight 400 meters to Yuelu Academy, tickets are 40 yuan per person, and children under the age of 14 are free of charge. Hunan University and Yuelu Academy are very close neighbors. Feel the cultural a**osphere brought by the surrounding environment of the university. A very good point.

The return journey is still the subway, 4 yuan per person. Exit No. 1 of Metro Line 2 at the entrance of the hotel, take the subway directly to Changsha South Railway Station for 25 minutes on Xiangjiang Middle Road, then exit from No. 4 of the subway station, take the escalator, turn around and take the escalator at the east entrance of the high-speed rail station, and you can enter the station after checking the ticket .

The perfect 2.5-day itinerary, if it is not because of the rain, it is estimated that it will be more lively, looking forward to the next time...

msg:The hotel is facing the beautiful scenery of Juzizhou and Xiangjiang River, but to be honest, as a high-end hotel, it is not up to standard. May be an old hotel? The decoration style is very old, the carpet feels dirty. The door of the toilet opens inwards, and the design is very anti-human, and the normal posture of a person inside cannot open the door at all. What is especially worth complaining about is that the windows are facing the main road and the park, which is very noisy, but the windows only use two layers of hollow space, which can not achieve sound insulation effect at all. In the whole season in the downtown area, at least three glass and two chambers will be used, let alone It's laminated glass, and what's even more funny is that the hotel also knows that it is noisy, so it wrote a small piece of paper and sent two earplugs... The question is, are these two earplugs what I am missing? I spent a lot of money to stay in a hotel when I went on a trip, do I still have to wear earplugs to sleep all night?

msg:【Advantages first】
1. Location: Not bad, just cross the road on the left when you get out of Subway 2A of Line 2. It is within walking distance from Pozi Street, Jiefang West Road, and Taiping Street. Juzizhou and Yuelu Mountain are also one or two stations away from Line 2. It is very convenient to eat, drink and have fun. The night view of the river view room is very good when the curtain is opened.
2. Service: OK, because there is no service other than check-in, so there is nothing worth complaining about. The takeaway is delivered to the door by a robot, which is very good.
[too many shortcomings]
1. The price is really not cheap: 2197 yuan for three nights to stay in a room of this level, which is not cost-effective in Changsha.
2. The Internet is crashing: just look at the picture for yourself. When the bathroom door is opened, it is about 0.5 network, and when it is closed, it is 0 network. There is also no Internet in the window, so you can’t even think about videos, and you can’t even open pictures. Sometimes when you are in a hurry to work, it is purely the beauty you want.
3. Furniture: like those found in second-hand stores. The cupboards are broken and ridiculously small, and the hangers are broken. The two girls lived for 3 days and wanted to hang up their clothes, but they thought too much.
4. Stingy: On the first day of check-in, my partner was thirsty and wanted 2 more bottles of water. He said yes, but he had to pay for it. We were stunned! I have never encountered such a thing, neither at home nor abroad.
5. Breakfast: I only ate one meal in 3 days because it was too bad. Apart from other things, is it difficult for your hotel in Hunan to make rice noodles delicious for breakfast? The noodles are rotten, the toppings are poor, and there are few varieties. If you really don’t want to provide it, don’t do it. Coffee is also the worst drink of my life.
6. Noise: I don't know if there is a disco in the building or what? There are popping music and jitters all the time. Makes me wonder if I'm hallucinating all the time.
#The above are all my real experience, as a legal practitioner, I take all responsibility for this real evaluation#

msg:Internet users who do not want to be deceived, please note:
      I was on a business trip to Changsha and wanted to book a river-view room at the five-star hotel in the Central District of China International Finance Corporation to receive guests. I habitually clicked on the platform to select "Five-star and super five-star hotels" several times and it was recommended as the number one hotel. I was short of time and didn't take a closer look. I only looked at the room area of ​​​​60 square meters and thought it should be good. Who knew I would have such a bad experience after checking in, being unable to return, and feeling completely cheated. I have been to so many places across the country, and this is the first time I have stayed in such a bad hotel. One room costs 1,090 yuan, and three rooms cost 3,270 yuan. It is a maintenance room with no air conditioning, no service, dirty and poor, no breakfast, and it is not a holiday. It is worse than an ordinary business hotel that costs 300 yuan/room. I don’t know how the hotel has the confidence to charge more than 1,000 yuan per room. The Complaints Desk also said that this room type was not originally available, and if there was no room available, they could only arrange these rooms for you. What’s the logic? The maintenance room is being sold without an air conditioning panel. Isn’t this a lie? The Wanda Vista next door only cost more than 800 yuan. I immediately booked three rooms that night and wanted to transfer there. Since I arrived in Changsha late, the guest was tired and didn’t want to go, which also offended the guest. I will definitely make a real-name complaint against this deceptive hotel. I hope the Consumers Association will rectify this mess.

msg:I didn't want to comment! But I am really dissatisfied. First of all, the upgraded room is not too clean, so forget it.
The next day I changed the room to the side and it was very cold! The air conditioner didn't respond and the hotel didn't remind me in advance. I woke up in the middle of the night and everyone caught a cold. The next day, I asked at the beginning and said that the central air conditioner was not turned on. After I asked again, it was said that the air conditioner in the side room was not good and it was already cold. Finally, two quilts were covered.
There was a power outage at night, and it took almost an hour to repair it. I took a shower with the flashlight of my mobile phone. The room was cold, and the hotel didn't give any explanation.
It can only be said that the location is okay, there are no other advantages, the experience is really bad, and the service is not very good.

msg:I thought the hotel was in a central location and the price was right, but I was completely disappointed. The hotel facilities are outdated. The hotel is not an independent building, but shares a building with other hotels. The parking space is tight, especially the hotel's elevator, because it is different from other hotels Shared, there is no independent elevator, so going up and down the stairs is extremely slow, but the hotel is opposite the Orange Island, close to the IFC Center, and the location is relatively good.

優點
1.位置首先是不錯了 離步行街 坡子街很近
2.周邊餐廳很多 可選類別多 夜生活豐富

缺點
1.酒店對面是江邊 早上5點就開始大爺大媽場戲 一直到凌晨12點左右 這個我覺得很誇張～嚴重擾民
2.酒店設施優點老化 
3.酒店早餐一般 品種少

由於入住第一晚噪音極大 睡眠不足 第二天想去前台退房 並且給予投訴 但是前台經理蔣玲接待的我 很温柔妥善的第一時間幫忙換了城景的房間 相對來説安靜了不少 及時平復了起床氣 焦躁的情緒 
本來想換一家酒店了 但蔣玲處理賓客問題非常到位 所以非常想誇誇她 攜程好評5分 也都是給她的 讓她明白 因為她的服務到位 我又續住兩晚 其實旅途出來就是注重踏實安心 省時省力 酒店硬件條件自身受到周邊環境影響 但是蔣玲的服務能彌補了整個過程不足 非常給力！

很少評價 因為蔣玲並沒有要求我給好評 而是換位思考客人的感受 讓我在長沙也度過愉快的幾天假期 所以希望酒店領導能看到此條訊息 表揚她！

不足的地方是房間的整體隔音不行，特別是窗户的隔音不好，外面煙火的聲音大影響睡眠！晚上不得已要了耳塞，電話督促2遍才送到！服務質量整體還可以，因為住宿人員較多，前台接待力量配備略顯不足，管理方面有待改進！

環境：房間的隔音太差，晚上時不時傳來各種叫聲，實在不敢恭維；電梯很臟，而且什麼人都能上來，外賣隨便進出，嚇人；酒店的電梯和這棟樓裏面其他住客的電梯是共用的，電梯搖搖晃晃，挺嚇人的；這是一棟很老的樓，整個隔音都很差，走廊裏麪人説話的聲音都聽得非常清楚，隱蔽性沒有。
服務：這個酒店的服務是他們唯一的優勢了，從前台到房間清潔人員都是非常熱情周到的，為他們點贊👍🏻
設施：如上所述，這個酒店的大樓是，非常老的，設施也比較陳舊，隔音也比較差，就是位置比較好，除此之外，對酒店有一定要求的朋友，不推薦入住。
總的來説，這個酒店的特色就是位置好，服務不錯，到其他方面乏善可陳，以後肯定不會再選擇了。雖然他們的服務的確不錯，但這真的不能成為給五星的理由，我不想誤導其他顧客。

餐廳食物不錯，但選擇可多加一些。
酒店升降機較慢，大堂應設排隊設施，方便大家排隊。
價錢略高，可能因是春假關係吧，降低30%較合理。

很後悔入住了這個酒店，住了一天馬上提前退房搬去旁邊君悦，就是一個騙子酒店，攜程顯示是五星實際上三星都給多了，各種臟，各種破，天花都發黴了，無法相信床鋪是乾淨的，無法理解為什麼攜程顯示是五星酒店，真的很後悔，旅遊本來就很奔波，一來到長沙就看到這種騙子酒店，真的很無語和傷心。大家要住五星的千萬別來，這家不是，都是包裝騙人的，我還定了一間套房，套房的情況也是不會讓你開心的，不要有僥倖心理，它不是五星酒店

msg:不建議住，花了389元，結果給我安排看居民樓？
裏面的設施也是很一般，真的很一般！花了將近400元，沒有辦公桌，空間很壓抑，還不如隔壁的江景民宿！
本來氣憤的情緒被大堂經理給温柔的蓋下去了，説給我寄茶顏悦色。結果今天一收到，***兩盒破茶葉？
不好意思，以後堅決不住！
我也希望去長沙旅遊的朋友們不要住，當然我這評論有可能被蓋下去！

msg:這間酒店的優缺點都很突出，先説優點吧。a. 交通方便。從高鐵站出來乘地鐵二號線到“湘江中路站”的2A出口出來就能見到不遠處大樓上的“異國印象酒店”幾個大字，步行不到5分鐘即可抵達。
b. 酒店位置不錯。酒店隔一條馬路就湘江，景觀極佳。從酒店出來左轉步行6、7分鐘即可抵達長沙市著名的旅遊熱點“太平老街”和“坡子街”。若去省博物館從邊上的解放西路乘901路直達。
c. 酒店前台的服務也很好。酒店的早餐價錢合理，食品的種類和味道中規中矩。
酒店的不足之處:  清潔的工作很一般，用過的茶杯不僅沒有清洗，而且還沒放回原處，還有就是用過的浴袍衹是隨便的掛回衣櫃沒有整理，這些還是第一遇到，就算是七天、如家這樣的低端酒店也不會這樣。另外在酒店房間的介紹本上最後三頁標註列明瞭房間所有物品的價錢（不誇張真是滿滿的三頁），給人的感覺好像是動了這些東西就要按這個價錢收費一樣，其實正常的使用並不收費，但這麼詳細的列明讓住客看着極不舒服。
