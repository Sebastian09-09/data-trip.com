Hygiene: Overall it’s pretty good, but the environment is surrounded by mountains and rivers. There are really a lot of mosquitoes, especially at night. There are electric mosquito coils and a plate of mosquito coils. The rest of the hygiene is generally good.
Environment: Really full marks. This room type is really worth it. Open the curtains in the living room and master bedroom to see the cliff and stream. It's beautiful. The view is really good.

Service: Breakfast is delivered to the room. It can be delivered according to the time required. It is a very rich breakfast. It is much better than the buffet breakfast in some hotels. It is very exquisite.
I am a person who is very particular about hotels, and I am really satisfied with this hotel. The shampoo and shower gel are also independent single-use small bottles, not the kind that can be poured in, which is more hygienic. Parking is also very convenient, there are many parking spaces, and the parking spaces are right in front of the room. You can also book attraction tickets at the front desk, which is slightly cheaper than booking on the software. The customer service at the front desk is also very responsible and answers all questions on WeChat~
The only thing I hope is that the hotel can improve the road by the stream, remove more ****s and discarded garbage, and take care of it more delicately, which will give guests a better experience~
I hope the hotel will continue to work hard and become more and more meticulous. I believe more people will see your hard work~

There was no signal in the mountains. The Internet has become very important. The waiter excused himself and said that the city bureau network was broken. Does the fact that the city bureau's network is down have something to do with me? I'm the customer and I just need you to solve the problem rather than tell me the problem. There are a lot of bugs in the room. Because the climate here is humid and warm, there are naturally many mosquitoes. It is recommended to prepare insecticides (there are so many bugs that they can fall off the bed when you sleep). There are wild insects flying around in the breakfast. There is no meat in the breakfast. The good news of vegetarianism. There is no coffee or water. You can't eat because there are no people around to eat. There is no internet and the phone number at the front desk cannot be reached. I have nothing to do but run all the way to the front desk to ask for it... It's really awesome.

msg:全酒店就我們兩個房間住人了，生意有點冷清。酒店衹留了個值班人員接待，空調啥的都沒開。負責人有求必應還是挺好的，但畢竟住的人少了，服務啥的都跟不上，早餐專門安排了個來給我們下米粉。量管夠。
因為人少，服務感覺和200元的商務酒店差不多，但如果是夏天，環境還是沒得説的。爭取下回夏季的時候再住一次。
