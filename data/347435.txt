I did do some washing by hand and to my surprise the cleansing staff observed that I had washed my clothes and left a message (attached in the photo) to let me know she left me a bottle of washing liquid. These are the little attention to detail that makes my stay very nice. 

Big rooms and good location… excellent stay 

Thank you

Room is huge and luxurious. Soap is from Diptyque which makes you feel so pampered. Even on our last day, doorman Kevin Zhu helped us check our ferry timings and assisted with loading our luggage’s into the car. That was really nice of him!

msg:We booked a garden view room for our Christmas trip and were upgraded freely to a bigger room (semi-suite) during check in. But we found that room a strong smell of smoke in a non-smoking floor. We required to change and the duty manager helped us by showing us another room on another floor. So end up we got no ungraded but even a downgraded room as it’s the most basic room with no garden view, so sad. 
The house keeping did a really great job. They kept the whole room tidy and clean during our stay and the turndown service was nice. We spent quite a lot of time in the hotel room so it’s important to us.
There is a bar located on the ground floor of the hotel with live music during weekends. But we went to other hotel bars where could see night view from high level. 
Overall I will still recommend Ritz Carlton SZ by their nice location, great house keeping team and warm hospitality from the staffs since the first step into the hotel. 

check in 時被免費升級到大一點的房間，但一進去那間位於禁煙層的房間就聞到很大的煙味，我們要求換房後，值班經理帶我們到另一樓層的另一房型。我們本來預訂的是園林景房間，最後入住了最基本的房型，沒有被升級反而還被降級了，傷心。
房間的house keeping做得很好，這次旅程很多時間都待在房間裡，他們總能快速又完整地收拾好房間，值得稱讚。
大堂職員也很親切友善，一到門口就得到熱情協助，引領我們辦理入住。

- *Unprofessional and Unwelcoming Experience*: Despite a confirmed reservation and guaranteed payment, the staff repeatedly called demanding payment, knowing family and luggage were still in the room. This unprofessional harassment caused significant stress and anxiety.

Checked in around 4pm and took a little nap to be awaken by loud drilling noise which i found out was the tradesmen fixing something next door. In the middle of the night when i was asleep the rainforest shower head started leaking water which scared the bleep out of me.  On top of these issues, concierge communicated wrong information on the location of delievery will be kept etc, English communication was not as effective as usual for this chain. Overall it was not the usual super welcoming RC experience.

I also like the cigar bar with live music. Not many hotels in China have this kind of live music!

However, the most disappointing thing about this hotel is that there is no feedback on the reservation. I reserved a smoking room in the small club suite. But the room I was assigned to was not a smoking room, and I asked for an exchange. As a result, I moved to a smaller, cheaper, but smoking room. I think the hotel should have contacted me before I checked in. If there are not enough smoking rooms at check-in, why on earth do they ask if I need a smoking room when I make a reservation? And if I told you that I needed a smoking room when I made a reservation, I think you need to guide me once before all the rooms are gone. This is very disappointing.

The breakfast buffet is excellent.

There was a handwritten card that included us as cartoon characters in Shenzhen and a cake that was also including some personal touch. Shortly, after we settled in our room, Nicole came to personally greet and welcome us in Shenzhen. During our entire stay she was always available when we had any questions and even arranged an heater that was put into our room due to the cold weather. Since we are also sports enthusiasts, we couldn’t wait to check out the pool of the hotel but unfortunately it was a bit too cold for us to use the outdoor pool. Luckily, the amazing team members of the SPA was able to offer us the alternative of making use of the amazing SPA facilities that offer a jacuzzi, an ice bath, a sauna as well as relaxing area and some amazing drinks along with our stay there. We would also like to highlight the work of Jack, the concierge gentleman , who took care of some of our personal deliveries prior to our arrival and gave us some great recommendations for bars around the area. We wrapped our stay up by a personal farewell with Nicole and her team and lots of memorable touches. She gave us an amazing experience and we will definitely come back to enjoy another stay here.

Mr Villegas also send us a wine from Chile with some food to our room - this was a very nice treatment, thank you very much. The gym is amazing - everything is from Technogym. Unfortunately the pool was closed at this stay but the rest was definitely 5 stars.

msg:Second time to the hotel.  Some aspects were great, some disappointing. 

Good points 

- room is spacious 
- room is clean
- executive club lunch was decent. Good sandwiches and cakes etc
- breakfast wide range of choice and decent 

Bad points 

- swimming pool was closed !  Which was one of the main reasons for going.
- steam room not working, polar plunge just felt to cold/not safe. Putting my feet in coursed pain after 10 seconds.  
- no executive club menu. 
- dinner wasn’t very good 
- afternoon tea was not fresh and was told we were limited to so many sandwiches. 
- pastries at breakfast not very fresh or low quality. 
- executive club even though polite and friendly there was a lack of service throughout the time. 
- I would expect a top quality 5 star hotel on a birthday to provide an in house cake, instead of towels and petals which I expect from a 3 star hotel in Egypt.   Hard rock, the langham always give cakes. 


Overall I found the executive club at the langham hotel better and the service at the langham hotel is better.  They have a menu, decent dinner options of a menu.

There is also a hot tun and a polar bear dip in their pool changing room which was nice and relaxing. We had a great staycation and the staff were also polite and welcoming.

However, after leaving the Ritz, we noticed we did not receive back our full deposit. I called the Ritz and it appears that they have charged an additional room rate with the deposit for which was a mistake on their part. It has been 7 days and we are still waiting for the deposit to return. We hope that the Ritz would return our deposit within the 24 hours as they has said. This is a poor review on the financial department and not a poor review on the actual hotel itself.

msg:Room is good but even from 22nd floor the view is not impressive 

Swimming pool is okay, but mostly for kids (water is like 1 meter high in most of the pool) and doesn’t have an interesting view.

Breakfast buffet is okay, but mostly focused on Chinese food and very few western dishes. 

A bit annoyed by the room service, I spent only one night there and they came two times knocking at the door, unrequested. 
First time to bring cookies, second time at 10pm asking if needed to make up the room. 

Location is great 

Overall, quite expensive but not really worth it for what u get, you mostly pay for the location.

We had dinner at the hotel and it was fantastic, we loved the variety of food available. The staff at dinner service went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. One of the best dinner buffets I've had in Shenzhen. The breakfast buffet was also excellent. I couldn't think of anything that was missing from the breakfast buffet. The hotel isn't new but it's well maintained. The pool/spa/sauna is super clean, well maintained and so relaxing. The room was spacious and the bathroom was great. The tub had a neck pillow, great view and even a TV. 
The location is fantastic, there are so many restaurants and stores close by. It's very central and the Subway is next to the hotel. 
We loved our stay!

msg:I did encounter a few really friendly ladies and gentlemen at the Ritz-Carlton Shenzhen, whose strong passion for helping I could strongly feel. For instance, after I told a lady that I would like to buy the Shenzhen edition of the RC lion, she immediately guided me to the cafe and explained the details of each model to me in a manner that could not be warmer and more detailed. Her hospitality is so elegant and genuine that I even wonder if she was from the Ritz-Carlton Guangzhou, where everyone treated their guests like an old friend. However, despite these few ladies and gentlemen, most of the people I encountered in this hotel failed to avoid falling into the trap of being overly mechanic. It is apparent that they did everything on their SOP but nothing more or nothing from their heart. For instance, the check-in process, which is supposed to be the primary opportunity by which the hotel shows its guests its hospitality, had nothing more than the most basic conversation, like "can I have your ID card?", "here you go", "this is your room card. Sir, your package does not include a breakfast, and you may consider booking one", "thank you". Everything was so quick, but also - mechanic. No temperature was there. That is alright, but not so Ritz-Carlton. Ritz-Carlton service is supposed to let guests feel warm and cared for instead of being mechanical like a budget hotel, isn't it?

Besides, the room's interior design is, unfortunately, a bit outdated, in my opinion. The abundance of yellow/gold color is no longer representing grandness these days. Instead, the room feels so unenergetic nor classy, but pretentious and vulgar.

However, the biggest mistake in this Ritz-Carlton hotel is that they do not seem to care about any pre-arrival communication with guests, even if the guests initiate that. I sent two notes to the hotel, one two weeks before my arrival and the other one week before, to tell them about my specific room preference. However, it came to my big surprise that, by the time of my check-in, the front desk was completely unaware of my messages. As a result, I could only get a room that KIND OF matches my preferences out of the few rooms available at that time. One of my friends who works as a senior manager of the Ritz-Carlton brand told me that a typical RC always proactively contacts their guests in advance about their room preference. Then they would try their best to arrange a room that best accommodates their preferences. The Ritz-Carlton Shenzhen does not only fail to finish this basic procedure; they even disregard guests' preference even if it is the guest who proactively and explicitly tells them about that, for two times, both initiated by the guest. Is this Ritz-Carlton trying its best to accommodate guests' preferences? No, far from that.

Everyone we met here could speak good English. Each staff member was super friendly and very helpful. We felt welcomed here throughout the whole stay. 
We got an upgrade of the room, one free breakfast and also complimentary cake and a bottle of wine from the director of front office Serina when we mentioned that we came to Shenzhen to celebrate birthday. 
The room was bright and very spacious. We had everything we needed there plus a very good view on Shenzhen downtown. The swimming pool is nice, but more suitable for kids, because it's not too big or deep. The sun loungers are good and the atmosphere is relaxing. We went for a drink at the hotel's bar Leaves, it's also good, suitable for a short time in the evening. The breakfast was delicious, the quality of food was superb. My boyfriend missed breakfast and I was allowed to bring some food for him from the restaurant, which was very helpful. 
The location of the hotel is very convenient, there is a shopping mall just next to it and also many places to go for a drink/some food.

The hotel's outdoor swimming pool is probably the most beautiful in Shenzhen, especially at dusk when the lights are bright... you can best appreciate the prosperity and vitality of this special zone... that moment is unforgettable...!

I remember that after swimming that day, a duty manager named Spenser took the initiative to ask me for my opinions on the hotel, and I gave some feedback... From this, we can see that the employees at all levels of the hotel are positive, striving for excellence, and striving for progress...

The service is excellent, every employee smiles at you
Call and pick up a tissue, it will be delivered in about 2 minutes
The bathroom has a TV and double wash basins
There is also a turn-down service in the evening

There are many types of buffet breakfast, but the food is not to your liking.
It is recommended that travelers consider and weigh

The bed is one of the top 5 most comfortable among many hotels I have stayed in.
There are many foreign tourists in the brand hotel, and the price is very cost-effective.

In conclusion, I had a wonderful time and it was a very satisfying stay.
First of all, the price was cheap (quite cheap even among Ritz-Carlton hotels around the world), the hotel was clean, the breakfast was delicious, the view from the lounge was amazing, etc. The hospitality was so high that I wondered if it was really worth the price.

Old money hardware + excellent service.
This kind of five meals a day in the hotel is really suitable for the long vacation after the rainstorm.

The service in the executive lounge is really high quality. One look will understand your feelings. Special thanks to the deputy manager Eric, sister Kylie and other friends for their meticulous service. I look forward to the new renovation of Shenzhen Ritz even better.

msg:In my mind, Ritz-Carlton has always been a brand founded on luxury.
This trip to Shenzhen was an eye-opener for me!
The room decoration is still stuck in the 1990s style. If it sounds good, it is called old, and if it sounds bad, it is called dilapidated. With so many new hotels being built in Shenzhen, it is time for you to renovate!
The funniest thing is the door card. After checking in, I tap the card and get on the elevator without any problem. But when I go outside the room and tap the card, I can't get in. I have to return the card to the front desk. I go out to eat the next morning. I entered the elevator and took my card, but this time I couldn't even take a picture of the elevator, and I had to go to the front desk several times.
However, the hotel staff's attitude and service are very good. It is the only five-star hotel.

I also want to thank Duke and Judy from the housekeeping depar**ent. The turndown service they provided me really made me feel at home.

Whenever I return to my room, I am always struck by what I see. The warm-toned room is warm and comfortable, and the soft light from the desk lamp fills the entire space, which seems to dispel the fatigue of the day for me. Duke and Judy always carefully arranged my clothes, arranged towels and slippers, which made me feel their meticulous care.

What surprised me even more was that there was a delicious bedtime snack placed beside the bed. Every time I taste these snacks, I can feel Duke and Judy's care and enthusiasm. These small gestures not only made my stay more perfect, but also made me full of gratitude to them.

When I arrived at the hotel's gate, a handsome guy pulled the door open as soon as I got off the bus and heard "Welcome to the Ritz-Carlton, Shenzhen Galaxy." There is also professional luggage service, which gives people a feeling of spring breeze. Each of the guest relations directors has a good image. Seeing their smiles makes me feel good all day long. The front desk is also very professional and efficient in checking in. The swimming pool on the 5th floor of the hotel is amazing. You can enjoy the beautiful view of the city center from the open-air outdoor swimming pool at any time. The trea**ents in the SPA are also top-notch. The Cantonese cuisine at the Chinese restaurant Xingli Restaurant is also great. It’s an experience I’ve never had before. The chef tailor-made dinner for me. I feel like I’m enjoying a Michelin restaurant. Also, I am particularly grateful to Fu Guihua from the Guest Depar**ent. She arranged everything before I checked in and helped me upgrade my room. Knowing that I was not feeling well, she also contacted the chef to arrange a nutritious meal for me. I have never had such a review at any luxury hotel. I will tell every friend around me about Ritz-Carlton’s professional services.

That night at the hotel's Western restaurant for dinner, the manager saw that I had eaten a lot and was very concerned. In fact, there was no big problem. The manager handled it very politely and professionally. The next morning when I went to the same restaurant for breakfast buffet, the manager and every waiter were very kind.
After checking out, the waiter was let go to the concierge. The waiter was not very good, but he was quite satisfactory. Maybe he was really good before.
Overall very good. The service in Western restaurants is much better than that of Ritz Carlton in Hong Kong!

I especially love the freshly cooked noodles in the breakfast buffet on the second floor, which are delicious with chicken soup; the smoked salmon in the executive lounge is very thin, rich in fat, and has a beautiful view.

First-class service: I have recently stayed at the St. Regis, the Regent Hong Kong and the Ritz-Carlton Shenzhen. In comparison, the Ritz really makes me feel like a spring breeze. I am very grateful to Spenser and Annie Fu for their service. They upgraded the room type at a lower price. They remembered me for the next two days. They were enthusiastic but not excessive. I am also very grateful to the front desk guy in the concierge area for his help on the morning of February 16th. I found my eyes that were lost in the restaurant and even had the lenses wiped clean as they were handed to me in a friendly manner. If I have the opportunity to come to Shenzhen, I will definitely continue to choose Ritz.

The room is clean and tidy: The room is relatively large, very comfortable, clean and tidy. It is decorated in an earlier five-star hotel style. It is not particularly new but it is also very good. A small suggestion: provide more napkins that are readily available at the bedside, sofa, etc. It will be more convenient. Thank you so much! I have enthusiastically recommended Ritz to my friends.

The big brand hotel is indeed very impressive, and the decoration is elegant. Although it is not a brand new hotel, it is well maintained and definitely comparable to a newly built one.

2D1N birthday trip @SZ☺️

Last Friday, I suddenly wanted to go to Shenzhen for a staycation to celebrate my birthday.
Everyone in the house agreed, so we booked a hotel at around 10pm and tried the Ritz Carlton, $14xx, OK🫢.

Check in first at 5:00, and check in at 9:00 for dinner.
The hotel room is 500 square feet, which is quite generous. Looking across from the Huangting Plaza and the nearby buildings, hotels and swimming pools downstairs, the most beautiful thing is the light show on the exterior of the building at night. However, the facilities are few and old, and the bathroom floor is very, very slippery. I accidentally fell. , fortunately nothing happened. The pillow had no support and was soft, which made me uncomfortable all night long😭.

All the equipment in the room is complete, such as central buttons. The mattress is of appropriate softness and hardness. The pillows are neither high nor low. It is suitable for business travelers. There are also facilities, and the bathroom is all good. The bathtub is next to the window, and you can watch the scenery and TV while soaking. The dry and wet are separated. The service is also very considerate. Fruit orders are welcome. The only thing in the end is that the charging can be upgraded to a fast one. Charging cords and accessories.

msg:This is my second time staying at the Galaxy Ritz-Carlton.
We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights. The hotel manager upgraded us to a suite for free. During our check-in, other staff brought drinks to my family and me, and took the initiative to deliver our luggage to the floor where we were staying.
We received attentive care from the hotel. In addition to providing fruits and cookies, the room was also equipped with my son's bed and toiletries.
The room has a terrace and an outdoor sofa. My family and I felt very comfortable and relaxed while enjoying the night view and drinking drinks.
The room is spacious, clean and comfortable, and the temperature in the room is moderate.
In terms of location, it is simply impeccable. You can walk a few dozen meters to Huangting Plaza and Link Exhibition Center; if you walk towards Ping An Center, you will reach the shopping park in less than 8 minutes; towards Gangxia, you can eat, drink and have fun at the Center of Excellence within 10 minutes. , so whether eating, leisure, or shopping are all within walking distance, it is very convenient.
Next time I go north, I will stay at the Galaxy Ritz-Carlton.

It does not feel like an old hotel at all. The hotel service makes people feel at home. . There are no banquet arrangements in the hotel during the Spring Festival, but the grand banquet hall has been cleverly made into a place for guests to have activities and parent-child activities. It is worthy of praise👍 If you come back next time, you must bring fitness clothes and swimsuits to experience the hotel's 24-hour fitness [呲亚][呲呲][呲呲]

On my last check-in day, even though the room was full, they helped me coordinate a room upgrade, carefully arranged birthday balloons, wrote several cards, and gave me a delicious cake. Although the hotel is old, the heritage of a luxury hotel is still there. The overall decoration is high-end and the hotel service attitude is first-rate. Finally, I must thank Annie, as the hotel customer service, she helped me arrange these and also provided breakfast.

msg:The day was tentatively decided, with 2 and a half days of rest. I arrived at the Ritz in Shenzhen that night. The service was so good that I was impressed. An episode happened that day: I got into a taxi at Futian Port. After driving, I asked the driver why he didn’t mark the taxi. , he said it was a bargain to take you to the hotel for $80. Since you were already driving off the road, there was no way to ask him to stop, so you were forced to surrender and go to the hotel. When you got off the car, the hotel lobby concierge: His name is (Jack Lien) . When I told him what happened, he immediately left the hotel, but the taxi had already left. He immediately helped check-in. Later, he found out that it was my husband's anniversary and he upgraded us both. We went to the executive floor. That night, when we returned to the hotel after dinner, we found that Jack had decorated the room for us and sent us delicious cakes. It was such a surprise. My previous unhappy mood suddenly disappeared! ￼Both my husband and I found it very unforgettable. ￼If we have a chance next time, we will definitely come back to your hotel. I have been to St. Regis Shenzhen before, but I just stopped by the lobby bar to ask how to book afternoon tea. When the waiter saw that I was wearing ordinary clothes, he started talking and refused to book. 🤦🏻♀️🥲⋯⋯ It is also a five-star hotel with great trea**ent and service. You can fight very far! ￼

Treat guests sincerely⋯Guests will definitely feel it😍😍

Special thanks also go to the following staff:
Dadang Concierge: Jack Lien Ho. (Thank you for arranging everything for me. It’s really touching. Respecting customers is the first condition in the service industry.)

Duty manager: Xiao Tenglong. ￼(Thank you for your attentive service to me.)

House Keeping: Song Chengying. (You are so attentive. You knew I left a note and you responded. You are so attentive.)

Catering Depar**ent Manager: Wu Qinghua. (Solve problems immediately and listen carefully to customer requests.)

Thank you to each of you and wish you a prosperous career.
Also grateful for the arrangement for our anniversary🙏🏻The icing on the cake😊

All the staff were very polite, greeted us proactively and helped us with our luggage.

Special thanks to the young lady in red uniform who greeted us in the lobby on January 2nd! I regretted forgetting to ask my name😖 Not only did she help me buy medicine, but she also delivered medicine and masks to the room, and even sent us out of the hotel after check-out.

We got off the plane and arrived at the hotel at 12 o'clock. Dannie, the housekeeper, had already contacted us the night before and proactively asked about our needs, so we could check in directly upon arrival. The service was very meticulous, not embarrassing and very thoughtful. The decoration style of the room was very old school, and it was also a very old hotel in Shenzhen. . Staying on the executive floor on the 22nd floor, different meals are served at 5 times every day. It is very quiet and suitable for relaxing and staying quietly. We had a lunch buffet at the Executive Lounge. Kyire beauty was gentle and meticulous, and the service level was very high. The lunch was very exquisite. After playing in the evening, I went to drink some red wine. It felt really great. I enjoyed the time before going to bed with the night view. It was beautiful. .
When I got back to the room, it was already turned down, and the fruits, chocolates, and biscuits were very considerate. Before leaving, Kyire also brought a handmade commemorative card and souvenir, which was very touching. All in all, it was a very worthwhile travel experience and I will come again.

So after I returned to the United States, I recommended my American colleague to come and stay here. He also booked a room for my colleague in advance. On the day of check-in, he helped my American colleague plan the best route from Hong Kong to the hotel and helped him pay for a taxi. fee (because he doesn’t know how to use WeChatpay and doesn’t have cash).

msg:I have stayed at Ritz-Carlton hotels in different cities and they are all good. I still chose this hotel out of trust in the Ritz-Carlton hotel brand. However, what I regret most about this trip is staying in this hotel. From the time I drove the car to the basement, I thought I had entered the basement of a wholesale market. It was dirty and almost smelled of mold. When I got to the room, there was an even pungent smell. I hurriedly put away my luggage and went out. When I returned to the hotel in the evening, I went to the lobby and asked the front desk. After changing rooms, there is still a pungent smell. I thought it was a hotel. The water in the washbasin is not smooth, and the edges are black. The facilities are old and the breakfast ingredients are not of high quality... This explains the management and training. , there were big problems in supervision, and the experience was extremely poor!

The room is classic in style, hygienic and clean, and the facilities and equipment are maintained with attention to detail. The bedding in the room is very comfortable and the quality of sleep is guaranteed. I especially like their gym. At the same time, you can choose to run outdoors to Lianhua Mountain. What I particularly praise is that the staff's service is very gentlemanly and polite. , special thanks to Austin, the manager at the lobby, for making this experience a great one. This hotel will be my first choice when traveling to Shenzhen in the future.

The guy at the front desk introduced the executive lounge and said very sincerely: We provide all-day meals, that is, five meals. Hahaha, very cute. The food in the executive lounge is exquisite. Passion fruit is mixed with a small jar of honey, and the soup is delicious. The light show at night has a great view. There are delicious chocolates during dessert time in the evening, and the afternoon tea is also exquisite. Five meals, really good👍😊.

Although the hotel is not new, the facilities and services are still five-star.
The manager on duty learned that my old Hu had a birthday on the New Year's Day and was about to have a birthday on the ***** Calendar. I received a call from him while eating out and told him that he had prepared a small cake and a handwritten greeting card.
 I have to praise that the cheesecake is super delicious, better than many professional bakers. My husband, who doesn’t like desserts, ate more than half of it.

I also gave you good night snacks and fruits when I turned down my bed.
Very attentive and considerate

The only small drawback is that you have to queue up for breakfast and it’s a bit messy

As a result, after waiting for 20 minutes, a maintenance man took care of it.

I think that as a high-end hotel, if you encounter a case where the toilet is broken just after checking in, there should be many contingency plans, instead of using the handling methods of ordinary convenient hotels.

In addition, when the hotel arranges a room for guests to stay in, there is no pre-checking process.

For the above two points, I think the service staff and management staff of this store are sorry for the name "Ritz-Carlton"

However, due to the old facilities, the carpet smells so that the whole room has a faint musty smell. The paint on the bathroom lighting is obviously peeling. As for the air conditioner, if you walk in the room, you will feel a bit stuffy. It’s okay to lie on the bed, but it will be a little cold at night. The air conditioner in the bathroom is very good and the wind is very strong, making the bathroom dry and not sticky. Maybe because the room is old, it takes a long time to turn on and off the TV. ￼When I returned to the hotel at about 12 o'clock in the evening, I smelled a strong smell of smoke through the lobby. Maybe the bar opened the door and came out from inside. ￼ Then order ** takeaway in the early morning, and you have to go to the self-pickup cabinet one meter outside the hotel to pick it up. It's a bit scary at night...￼I don't know if the hotel policy is like this?
But the overall service is good, there is a small episode during the breakfast period, I feel a little uncomfortable, I hope it can be improved: when the customer leaves the seat to pick up the food, please pay attention to the colleagues who clean up the table, do not throw the guest's napkin on the guest's food superior. It was not reported to anyone. The general situation is not affected.

The hotel breakfast is stable and rich in variety. Compared with two years ago, the toiletries in the room have been replaced with Diptyque's hotel's first model, which is Greek fig scent, and they have been reinforced, so bad guys can't open it and add things. Here are some minor points: The basic room type of the superior king-size bed room, the shower room and toilet are too narrow, and the shower pressure is too small, the water pressure is unstable, and it is sometimes hot and sometimes cold.

The entire check-in experience until check-out was 5 stars, nothing to be picky about
Points are deducted one hour after check-out, when I received a phone call from the hotel, it was the guy who checked in. The purpose was to remind me to come here to evaluate (already mentioned when I checked in), and I was already very impatient to reply that I will review when I have time. Unexpectedly I sent a text message the next day. I don’t know what KPI or something to pursue. The service is obviously very good, so the points are deducted. Is it because you have no confidence in your hotel?

msg:The first time I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, I chose the Star River in Shenzhen, but the quality of the front desk service of the hotel is really not flattering. After paying the full price for two nights (executive suite), the check-in attendant (a girl) actually told me that a deposit of 5,700 yuan was required. Although I felt that the amount was a bit large, I didn’t think much about it. paid. At this time, the waiter said that the room we stayed in was still being cleaned and let us go to the executive lounge to rest first. While waiting in the lounge, I took a closer look at the hotel package pushed by Ctrip (purchased on February 15 this year), and found that the deposit at the front desk There was a problem with the charge, so I came to the front desk again. The original waiter who handled the business was not there. A young male waiter received me. I asked him about the hotel deposit fee standard. After checking the computer, the waiter told me that the deposit originally charged was wrong. He immediately canceled the previous operation and re-applied the deposit charging business. Although the waiter greeted me and apologized repeatedly, I still felt that the check-in experience was very bad. Such low-level mistakes will also happen. Doesn’t the waiter look at the customer’s reservation information when handling the business! Operating blindly with eyes closed, serving ordinary guests in the hotel so carelessly, is this standard with the hotel's star service? Fortunately, other services of the hotel were online during the stay, especially in the executive lounge. Manager Lu and several beautiful waiters were very enthusiastic, actively asking the needs of the guests and providing convenience, giving people a feeling of spring breeze. The hotel's breakfast service is also very good. The young waiters are very good at observing words and expressions, and they are well-trained at first glance. The hotel's concierge service is also worth mentioning. After check-out, you can store your luggage. The gentleman who handles it greets you with a smile and actively provides convenience. In fact, guests still pay attention to these small service details.

msg:When I came to check in, I already felt cheated by Ctrip once. Children's gift bags are originally standard in hotels. Forget it all, the key is that these things written in it were not prepared in advance after check-in, and they were all called to the front desk to deliver them. There is a feeling that you need to ask for it yourself, which is not good. (The room was only given at 4 o'clock, and no one notified when the room was ready. I called the front desk and said that the room was ready and I could check in.) It also includes children's candies and toys mentioned in other customer reviews. I called to ask, but the customer service center answered the call and didn't know what was going on.
When I booked the hotel, I knew that the hotel had been around for a while, and I had expectations about the newness and oldness of the facilities. But I have always believed that Ritz's service is the industry benchmark (the previous company training specifically mentioned the need to learn from Ritz's service that exceeds user expectations), so I chose to live here for this family trip. I also saw the comments of other customers and chose the executive suite, and I also called the hotel in advance because I have two girls.
In the end, I asked the lobby manager to "ask" for these services, and the result must have been disappointing. The candy was delivered after dinner, and I didn't want my children to eat it when I was about to go to bed. Hot milk before going to bed, we knocked on the door and delivered it after we all turned off the lights and went to bed.
I really don't know if I have too high expectations for the Ritz, but I think the room rate of 2K is not up to standard for a hotel that opened in 2009.
I heard from the waiter that they mainly receive business customers. I don’t know if this has affected them. Maybe the needs of business customers and home users who are reimbursed at public expense are different.

The glass is transparent 😂The opposite side is surrounded by commercial offices. It is easy to be seen when you take a bath and enjoy the beautiful scenery during the day.

Many comments said that Ritzka’s breakfast is delicious. This time I ate it specially. I should say that they are very attentive to the freshness and presentation of the meal. There will be no problem of keeping it for too long. I have been to too many local restaurants before. It's very casual, so it goes straight to the top three in terms of deliciousness.
The reception staff in the lobby, the waiters in a small place, and the housekeeping 24hrs are very enthusiastic and friendly.

Right next to the hotel is the Huangting Shopping Mall, where there are many places to eat and play. It takes less than 3 minutes to walk to the Convention and Exhibition Center subway station. In the evening, there are 7-11 with the whole family. It takes less than 10 minutes to take a taxi to the Oriental Garden Spa. The function is very, very good!

msg:I finished my trip to Zhangjiajie during the long Easter holiday. Since I arrived in Shenzhen by high-speed train at 10:00, I decided to rest in Shenzhen for a night before returning to Hong Kong. I have always stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel in Shenzhen because it is guaranteed! This time I want to change to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Shenzhen, I think I will not be disappointed!
       Check in around 11:00 pm. The room is No. 1722. When you enter the room, you will see welcome fruit snacks and the bed is ready. However, it was found that a curtain in the bathroom was torn, and the curtain had been derailed. Inform the front desk to ask the waiter to check in the room, and their answer: That's it! Although I know the hotel is old, I never thought that the old hotel would not even do these maintenance and repairs! Asked to change another room that night, the hotel room attendant also stood outside the room, no answer at all! So I had to go to the front desk on the first floor to ask for a room change. After that, the room was moved to the 26th floor. Because I didn't have dinner, the hotel colleagues said that they would arrange to carry our luggage for us.
       When I went back to the hotel to rest after dinner, although the luggage had been moved to the 26th floor when I returned to the room, the welcome fruit snacks in the room that the hotel wanted to arrange were gone! Although I have never tasted it, these details highlight the quality of this hotel! When I was about to take a bath at night, I found that the soap bottle in the bath was full of soap! Empty bottle! What a disappoin**ent! I can't imagine the quality of Ritz-Carlton is so bad! I thought I was living in a two-star hotel in Shenzhen! I hope through you to make a formal complaint to Ritz Carlton and ask them to reply in writing and make appropriate compensation.

msg:The location is superior, located in the central area of Futian, the transportation is very convenient. The front desk helped to upgrade the room type, the floor is high and the scenery is good. The biggest feeling I get from The Ritz-Carlton is that from the doorman to the room service staff, every staff member in the hotel is polite and enthusiastic, actively serves customers, and can actively discover customer needs instead of passively waiting. Daisy, who cleans the room, paid attention to my needs and prepared a lot of water when cleaning the room. The breakfast in the hotel is very rich, both Chinese and Western. There are a lot of guests staying during the Spring Festival, but it is orderly and the service is timely. The hotel's outdoor swimming pool has an excellent view, and you can see the Shenzhen skyline. There are two things that can be improved. One is that there is a turndown service on the second day, but not on the first night. The other is that the room card cannot be opened after two nights.

The lobby is small and the facilities are old but very warm. It may be because of the good service attitude that makes people feel at home. It's a pity that the swimming pool is not open
Others: When I was leaving, I saw a woman in a suit, a bit older than a red shirt, and the concierge played on the mobile phone and ignored the guests. It was impolite

msg:The Ritz Carlton came here especially, and the thoughtful service in the executive lounge is in place, which is almost at the international level. The manager, Erick LU, enthusiastically introduced Shenzhen's shopping and check-in attractions. The other waiters are very concerned about the needs of the guests. The handmade cocktails focus on communication. They will ask the guests about their tastes beforehand. Praise! Although there are not many food choices, the taste is good. If you can add some steak or hot meat for dinner, it will be more satisfying. For breakfast the next day, we went to the 2/F buffet breakfast. It was very rich and had everything we needed, and it tasted good. As for the facilities, after all, the hotel opened in 2009, the room facilities do feel old, but they are clean. The 5/F swimming pool is very disappointing. The area is small and nearly four-fifths of the area is 0.9 meters deep. It is just a leisure pool. It takes less than 5 minutes to go ashore. This swimming pool is mandatory for swimmers to bring their own and wear it swimming cap. On the contrary, the locker room facilities are very impressive. There are hot and cold massage pools, sauna rooms, showers, hair dryers and other facilities, and they are taken care of by dedicated staff. It feels very good and comfortable. Finally, there is the welcome and concierge service in the lobby. On the day of check-in, as soon as the luggage is pulled at the door, no one pays any attention or hospitality. As a five-star hotel, this aspect is indeed very important. It is the first impression the hotel gives to guests. I personally think that training in this area Need to strengthen.

msg:Second stay, as good as ever 😋

The difference from last time is that from a single experience to a family tour...

With the ardent care of the hotel manager Wu Meng, he helped to upgrade to a 🈶️ 3-meter-sized executive suite, which solved the problem of sleeping and parent-child accommodation for a family of four (a couple and two children), a problem😇

During the National Day holiday, there are various activities in the hotel. Every morning and afternoon, there are many parent-child activities such as paper-cutting, art, and clay sculpture. In the evening, there are special movies that children like. The outdoor swimming pool is very popular with children 💕

The hardware facilities of the room are in the post, the leather sofa is soft and comfortable, the mattress and bedding are high-end enjoyment, the welcome fruit is delivered, the turndown service is turned on, the bathtub is also cleaned twice, and the scenery of Shenzhen's central axis is collected from the window...

The customer service of the hotel is very good👍👍The team spirit is great 🌟🌟For example: Mr. Pan Gaofeng in the lobby helped us carry our luggage into the room warmly and politely, and forfeited the tip; Miss Liu Meng in the spa patiently and meticulously helped the child to untie the swimming trunks, with a super good attitude ;The unknown lady who answered the phone in the guest service center had a sweet voice, politeness and good service, and brought children's toothbrushes, children's bathrobes, etc...

The problem is also found in two or three places. There is drinking water but no wet towels outside the men's sauna in the spa. When swimming in the swimming pool, I found that there are live flying insects, a flower, a leaf, etc. in the middle. Indoor and outdoor ecology is also beautiful...

The spring breeze is not as good as you. Finally, I would like to thank Manager Wu Meng and the hotel team members for giving family and children a wonderful holiday experience. Come back next time! ! goodbye...

The location is first-class, next to the convention and exhibition center, subway station, and shopping mall. The decoration is old, the lobby is stingy, the rooms are small, the toilet is not smart, and the cleaning supplies are of low quality. The waiter's check-in service was terrible! When I checked in, I needed a smoking room, but it came and went. In the end, there was a non-smoking room. I was repeatedly told not to smoke in the room. The experience was terrible. I was told that I couldn’t check out at two o’clock, but at the latest because there were a lot of units booked for the next day. Room, what does it have to do with me that MD booked a lot of rooms the next day? Finally, I called at 12 o'clock and asked, "Can't you tell me something?" She said she didn't know. What a mess. Breakfast is average, not many options. Luohu is still not as good as the Sheraton Hilton Four Seasons.

The first night felt good
The next day, in the afternoon, I found that there was a lot of noise. For example, the sound of moving luggage, moving stools, I don't know if it was from the isolation room or the room upstairs. I didn't pay attention to it, but in the middle of the night, the sound of the air-conditioning vent was outside the door. There are all kinds of sounds that I can't sleep at all...

I was in a hurry to check in and leave this time, and the bracelet was missing in the room. I went straight to the airport and flew away after finishing the work. The hotel found that I was missing something, contact me as soon as possible, and add WeChat confirmation, help me confirm that it is intact, and post the video. SF Express, I received the bracelet the next day. Thanks to the hotel duty manager team for picking up money, being serious and responsible, eager for customers to think what customers think, unity and cooperation, and efficient service efficiency, which will surely bring excellent reputation to the hotel! thank you all!

It is recommended to send some welcome fruits and common beverages. Replace the toilet with an automatic toilet or at least install a slow-down device with a toilet lid. The sound insulation can be further optimized. When it is very quiet early in the morning, you can hear the sound of walking and opening the door next door.

After the hotel asked people to come over for repairs, take a bath and dry with the hotel towel, the thigh was bleeding from the towel. The hotel manager came to the room and said that Take the towel away. Back at the hotel in the evening, a manager on duty said that we checked the towels and there was no problem, then I asked how the injury on my leg came from, and it was your own problem. This is how your Ritz-Carlton Hotel handles the problem. manner? Fortunately, I didn't have a towel to wipe my face this time.

msg:Few reviews have stayed at the hotel, but the Galaxy Ritz-Carlton Needle is really great! The hardware is excellent, the transportation location is convenient, the breakfast and the gym are very good, but the most praiseworthy thing is the service here. The core of the hotel is service and people. It has been a long time since I have encountered a hotel with such an overall high-quality service level. I think only Beijing Park Hyatt at its peak can compare. Everyone I met here was kind, lovely, caring and considerate, especially the hotel manager on duty——Mr. Zou Cheng. When I said that the phone signal in the room was weak and wanted to change a room, he tried a few more for me. The cell phone signal in the room finally picked me a new room. I'm so touched, and thank you so much. No wonder the hotel occupancy rate is so high with such a manager. If I want to stay in a double room that day, there is no room, haha.

msg:As expected of the Ritz-Carlton, the hotel's service is simply top-notch, and it is almost caring. It made me realize what is professional and warm. Because I booked a room and a Chinese restaurant for my birthday, I accidentally fell to pieces some time ago. I had a sex fracture and came to live with crutches. As soon as I arrived at the door, a young gentleman came to help me take the bag. Seeing that it was not convenient for me to send me to the front desk, the front desk also helped me upgrade the room type and asked to send me there. The room, because I knew that I also sent a small cake for my birthday. The most touching thing is that the hotel members jointly wrote a greeting card the next morning to wish me a speedy recovery and wish my birthday, and the young lady who sent me upstairs is simply a heartfelt heart. Handicraft, I even knit woolen ball socks and gave it to me. It is very cute. There is also a restaurant. The Chaoshan restaurant on the 4th floor is a treasure restaurant. Not only Cantonese cuisine is delicious, but Sichuan cuisine is also very tasty. The roasted meat is good. Australia The ingredients selected for the abalone are good. I tried the cafeteria at noon the next day. The service was also very nice. I picked up the meal and asked me what I needed. The price was very high. The desserts were good, even the restaurant service. Well, it can be seen how well Ritz’s management is in place, which is rarely comparable to other hotels in Shenzhen. When I checked out and returned home, I carelessly forgot something. The housekeeping lady also helped me find it and mailed it home in time. Finally, Speaking of the facilities, objectively speaking, I like this American style very much. Although the hotel is old, I can still experience the low-key luxury style. The space layout is very good, which makes people feel open. You can see the Ping An Financial Center outside the window. And the hotel swimming pool, unfortunately, I can’t swim with my feet for the time being. Haha, I suppressed my desire to go into the water. The night view is good. I can’t find any shortcomings for the time being. In short, I will come to stay next time I have a chance. I also recommend everyone. Stay at the Ritz-Carlton.

The hotel parking lot is on the third and fourth floors. If you park on these two floors, there is an elevator to go directly to the hotel lobby. For other floors, you need to go to the ground, which is more troublesome. The hotel’s service is very good. It will help you pick up your luggage, press the elevator, and call whatever you need. It will be delivered to you within two minutes. The swimming pool is great. By the way, if you want to swim in the pool, you must wear a swimming cap instead of a swimming cap. Can't enter the water. There are more choices in the nearby business districts, shopping, eating, drinking and having fun, and the subway station is also nearby. Various modes of transportation are very convenient.

The date was changed at the beginning because of the epidemic
Very grateful for the hotel's willingness to help change the time
Ritz’s service has always been well-known
In the center of the convention center
It's still very convenient to travel
Give two drinks when you check in
Get rid of the hot and humid weather in Shenzhen
After that is the elevator guide
You know you need help when you look downstairs from the room
Take the initiative to ask what can be done
The package is just an ordinary double room
I can see that the facilities are still a bit old
But the hygiene is done very well, it makes people feel at ease
I took the room card early when I checked out
When I walked to the counter, I had already handled it all at odds and ends.
It's a pity that it rained when I came
Did not feel the charm of the pool
Coupled with physical discomfort, I didn’t enjoy the executive lounge.
Come again if you have a chance
But the front desk kept calling me twice to increase the money to change the suite a bit uncomfortable
After all, I refused it for the first time
You asked me to add money to catch the ducks on the shelves
Others are ok

在入住期間，Robinson主管特意為我房間贈送了鮮花，讓整個空間瞬間煥發出生機與活力。每當我回到房間，看到那些嬌艷欲滴的花朵，都感到心情愉悦，彷彿置身於花園之中。

而Liam主管則在夜床服務時，為我準備了一些特別的小點心。這些點心不僅美味可口，更讓我感受到了他對我需求的細心洞察和用心滿足。每當夜幕降臨，躺在床上品嚐着這些小點心，都讓我感到無比愜意和滿足。

此外，我還要特別感謝Livi和Mike。他們打掃房間時總是那麼認真仔細，確保每一處都乾淨整潔。夜床服務時，他們也會為我精心佈置，讓我每晚都能擁有一個舒適的睡眠環境。

還有賓客部經理付桂花，高效的溝通能力和解決問題能力，非常感謝。

總之，深圳麗思卡爾頓酒店的客房部團隊給我留下了深刻的印象。他們的真誠關懷和優質服務讓我感受到了家的温暖與舒適。這次入住體驗讓我十分滿意，期待下次再次光臨！

這樣有温度的一家酒店，很難不讓人有賓至如歸的親切體驗！以後來深圳衹會無限回定深圳星河麗思卡爾頓！
超級推薦！入住過很多五星，服務最好最專業的衹有這家！

此外，我還要感謝在我需要服務的過程中遇到的主管Liam和Amy。他們的出現，讓我對這家酒店的專業度有了更深的認識。無論是處理突發事件，還是解決我的特殊需求，他們都顯得如此從容和專業。他們的禮貌和細緻入微的服務，讓我倍感安心。除了這些優秀的員工，我還要提到酒店的客服和禮賓部門。他們總是熱情地為我提供各種幫助，從預訂餐廳到安排出租車，他們都能迅速而準確地完成。他們的關照讓我感到非常舒適和滿意。

總的來説，深圳麗思卡爾頓酒店給我留下了非常棒的一次入住體驗。這裏不僅有舒適的環境和完備的設施，更有那些專業而熱情的員工。他們讓我感受到了真正的五星級服務。我相信，無論是商務出差還是休閑度假，這裏都是一個絕佳的選擇。我會毫不猶豫地再次選擇入住深圳麗思卡爾頓酒店。

Lounge 經理Fiona Lin 可以講流利廣東話，先安排入座，飲品等，非常熱心親切。其後更親自帶我哋入房，超級好服務。 
訂房已包括下午茶、晚餐、甜品、早餐、午餐，本人食素，當Fiona Lin 知道後，立即安排廚房專登煮一碗素麵給我。 很是窩心😍😍😍
翌日自助早餐，非常豐富，種種繁多亦非常美味，服務員更是貼心服務，食物送遞，幫忙冲調咖啡☕️，Dylan Wang 非常貼心服務，其他服務員都係十分好

總括來說，酒店雖然久了一點，￼但非常衛生乾淨，￼服務之貼心，上至經理下至大堂職員，￼都係￼秉承待客之道非常非常之好嘅態度，令人感動，奶奶非常滿意開心滿足，隔離已經係皇延廣場，見識過盒馬鮮生及象山酥院。

1.餐飲不行 4樓中餐廳的葵花雞手撕雞真的很一般，沒有特色，要麼做成粵式的手撕雞要麼做成越南的麻油雞，這種做法做得四不像，不好吃

26樓的行政走廊的草莓蛋糕吃出蛋殼碎

4樓的自助餐牛扒要了全熟，全熟是最考驗火候的，但火候過了

2. 進酒店看到門僮在聊天，也有詞看到我進酒店熟視無睹

麗思卡爾頓酒店價格雖然偏貴但是早上9點去吃早餐，整個餐廳是爆滿還要等候20分鐘左右才可以入座。所以下次要避開8點半到9點半這段時間才行。

已經辦理退房超過五個小時了 按金到現在還沒有退！ 
下午一點的時候已經致電聯繫了酒店，並催促儘快退回按金，可截止目前也沒有什麼動靜，下次不會再選擇這裏了，麗思這樣的國際大牌，cheak in 也花了非常漫長的時間，服務效率如此低下！
之前住的酒店也很多，從來沒有哪個酒店退按金這麼慢的，酒店設施也比較陳舊！

辦理入住的時候前台要刷 1000 的按金，因為我會請朋友在酒店消費主動要求刷 3000 按金，晚上在雪茄吧消費了 1047.9，掛房賬掛不上去，説是沒有額度，我説你跟前台確認下，回覆確認過了，就是沒有，衹能現金買單，在朋友面前很尷尬。
一個酒店造成的失誤卻要客人擔起責任，不知道前台是怎麼確認我沒有足夠的額度掛不上的。

又等了十五分鐘，我返回前台找另一個女職員，馬上一兩分鐘幫我辦理了入住。
我問女職員如何投訴，她說經理會打房間電話找我，結果係音訊全無！
我上兩星期才入住過廣州麗思卡爾頓，那家職員很禮貌，服務熱誠，還送我曲奇。真係有比較才有傷害！
房間不錯，需然是給了我最低樓層(原因🤔)，泡浴時可看到户外。
健身房設施是很好的，有香蕉提供。

至於酒店環境都相當豪華，畢竟是國際品牌5星級酒店，但由於已開業十多年，房間已比較殘舊，不少歷史痕跡，酒店職員好有水準及很好的服務態度，馬上協助更換新房間，另外酒店大堂副經理還送了兩位自助晚餐給我們，這就是國際品牌5星級酒店的優質服務👍👍👍
建議深圳Ritz-Carlton酒店盡快返新房間及設施，相信返新過後酒店會更加一流。

msg:麗思的服務我覺得不應該是這樣的。 
連續兩次了，上次入住房間裏錯送了一個別人的行李，這次入住房間裏神奇的多了一張加床
下午過去送車，然後辦入住，看到加床打個電話讓他們來人拿走，連續打了三次電話，三個人接，每次都要重新説一次有不需要的加床讓拿走。然後就漫長的等了四十多分鐘也沒人過來房間。 公司那邊開會就等着我
而且第二天一早出發出去工作了，下午快三點了回來，房間還沒收，問了一下，客房服務人員問的第一句是問我們要不要收？   
而且晚上蚊子特別多，打電話要蚊香三點多打電話半天不接，説送又等了半個多小時。 
一次兩次小問題，可以理解  這種怠慢是在不符合麗思自我標榜的服務。

酒店不但交通方便，附近亦有各式各樣琳瑯滿目的食肆，由早到晚滿足你的胃口！步行數分鐘就可到超市，方便購買日常所需。

房間的浴缸中亦有枕頭方便浸浴，勞碌一天後，躺在熱水，一邊舒緩疲勞，一邊欣賞夜深圳的風景，十分放鬆！

msg:酒店總體硬件滿意的，不過有個做事方面本人非常不滿意的，本人訂的雙床房間前台明確説沒房（本人已經付款費用人在前台），我是一個人居住，前台找領導去商量許久最後説給我換個單人床房間，我預訂的房型已經沒有了説，我信了那就説沒事就單人房也行，畢竟晚上8點多了人也累，又預訂了三天酒店7600多元，2500多一晚的酒店應該不會騙我的，當我上樓去房間時候我打開攜程看到我本來預訂的房間型號出現了，居然標價每晚4500多，我電話確認是可以預訂並告知剛剛放出型號的房間，其實我蠻氣氛的，把我的型號房型拿出去賣，就給我換個單人房型而已，感覺房間檔次都有點比我預訂房型還低，希望酒店跟攜程都要多家注意這種不厚道事件今後不要發生。

面積夠大，家人都很滿意，就是傢俱已經明顯有點年代了，但是不影響使用。
浴缸很贊，景觀一流。

性價比：
目前去住，價格和檔次很匹配，還不錯。

早餐：
還算比較多選擇，個人比較滿意。

床：
睡着不錯。
餐廳：
選擇很多。
衞生：
唯一的遺憾，發現床單上有血漬。並且是陳跡。值班經理處理得還不錯，反應也很快，處理結果也比較滿意。麗思沒讓我失望。
停車：
方便。
房間景觀：
會展中心附近，夜景不錯。

服務：
前台和值班經理都不錯，餐廳的服務也可以。

自行在此酒店開了兩間兩晚的房間
前台服務很好，可能是因為較便宜的房間被我朋友訂完了
導致前台主動幫我們把兩個房間都升級了
衞生和設施相對來説都還不錯，就是電視不夠智能，還沒聯網，導致無法投屏
還有就是衞生阿姨，十一點就按我門鈴説要不要打掃
，還按了兩次，前面一次説不用，後面又來一次，我真的是服了
我要打掃應該可以打開請即打掃的開關吧，不必要敲門問我要不要打掃吧
目前來説不滿意的就是電視，阿姨，還有個門的隔音，其他相對來説都比較滿意

スタッフはとても感じが良く、動きもテキパキしていた。
食事は朝食のみ利用したが、種類も豊富で味も良かった。
外資系のホテルなのでインターネットもVPN対応な為、外国人にはとても助かった。
寝るだけなら確かに高いかもしれないが、たまの贅沢で利用するなら絶対泊まりたいホテル。

另外，雖然加了三百多升了不錯的房間，但是，作為我最愛的麗思，第一次遇到房沒準備好讓我加錢升房的！不可思議，如果是在其他麗思，由於自己沒準備好，為了避免客人等待，不是應該主動升級嗎？
其他的都挺好。
