msg:After the reservation was successful, the front desk contacted me immediately and arranged a lot of upgraded services. A very pleasant and exquisite weekend began. I have been paying attention to this hotel for a long time, but I have never had time to go there. This time I stayed here and it was indeed very high-end. Living, eating, and playing were all very VIP. I have stayed in many five-star hotels, and the dining here is very much in line with my taste. The ingredients are excellent and the taste is authentic. The small courtyard of the suite I stayed in is very impressive. A pot of tea can be brewed all day without getting tired. Climbing up to the highest attic in the Expo Park next to it, the view is magnificent. The Danube River in Europe is just like this. Xiao Gao and Xiao Xue at the front desk provided very good service. At 10 o'clock in the morning, they also gave the children a popular science lecture on ancient Chinese architecture. It was a very wonderful holiday experience.

msg:I rarely write reviews, especially those that are asked for actively, but this treasure hotel must be shared. It is a perfect stay experience. This is a hotel built in the park, with beautiful scenery, quiet, comfortable and cozy. The car was parked in the basement and went directly to the elevator entrance. On the first floor, there was a butler waiting to help take the luggage to the front desk for registration. The beautiful lady in Hanfu greeted me with a smile, quickly checked in, and introduced the park tour guide in detail. I added the butler's WeChat and entered the room. There were constant surprises. The Hui style of architecture, the fragrance of the courtyard, the noble and elegant facilities in the house, the mattress was very comfortable, and Kohler's smart toilet showed the designer's ingenuity wherever I looked. The service was even more thoughtful, meticulous, fast and considerate. After dinner, I wandered far in the park and couldn't find it back, so the butler sent a battery car to pick me up. In addition, the midnight snack was too sweet. The breakfast was a rare set meal with a wide variety of high-quality ingredients. I couldn't finish it at all. In short, it was too beautiful! I just don't know why such a good hotel has no bustling guests, and such a beautiful park rarely sees tourists. Is it because it's Monday?

The first courtyard of the hotel is the place where I linger the most: sitting quietly and reminiscing about the past during the day, watching classic cartoons projected on the wall at night, feeling the changes of light and shadow on sunny days, and standing under the eaves to listen to the sound of wind and rain on rainy days.

msg:Staying in the Songyue Room Suite of Beijing Expo Pushen Hotel, the nominal area is 100-150 square meters, which should include the yard area. The indoor area is about 60-70 square meters. Although it is a suite, it can actually be regarded as a single-family villa, with a single door. It is a private courtyard, but there is no bathing pool in the yard. Only the higher-level rooms have them. However, the weather in Beijing is also very cold. There is still a lot of snow in the yard, so if there is a bathing pool, it is probably impossible to take a bath.
.
Two half-moon-shaped screens were made in the yard to increase the depth of field. The fish scale pattern reflected by the evening sunlight through the gaps is still very beautiful. Although it is a high-walled private courtyard, there is plenty of sunlight.
.
The first thing I felt when I entered the room was that it was super warm. I not only turned on the air conditioner and the location early, but also put an electric heater next to the bed. It can be said that it is full of warmth. This is also the hotel where I stayed during this late winter trip to Beijing. The warmest family.
.
Entering the door is a foyer, with side cabinets for easy storage of miscellaneous items. The room key card is made of wood with a ring, which is very beautiful. I collected one when I left the store. Then turn left to the living room. The gabled roof is high and empty, and the left and right are divided into reception areas. In addition to the office area, the desk is quite large, the sofa and coffee table are very unique, especially the coffee table, which is shaped like a cloud, and the large cantilever chandelier is also quite beautiful.
.
The minibar is placed in an antique-style standing cabinet with a bright red paint finish. It has a capsule coffee machine with 2 capsules, 2 bags of customized loose tea, a Chinese tea set, and an electric kettle that boils water very slowly. 4 bottles of Baisui Mountain, the minibar is free but only has 3 bottles of soft drinks. To be honest, for a suite priced at 4,000+ per night, this configuration is definitely too low and not so considerate. The suite is also far from the main building. To order room service, you have to open two doors. It's quite tiring. What's also strange is that there was no welcome fruit plate, but porridge with a very strange combination of raw materials was delivered at night. I could only taste it briefly, but I didn't like it.
.
A corridor from the living room leads to the bedroom. The toilet and cloakroom are on both sides. The courtyard-view toilet has a smart toilet and a mobile phone shelf. It is cute in shape. The cloakroom is extremely small. The only luggage rack is half occupied by a safe, so there is no room to put the suitcases. , unable to understand the design and the significance of the existence of the cloakroom.
.
Compared to the living room, the bedroom is much smaller. The wooden bed frame and completely transparent glass cage shower room look very interesting, so it is not suitable for families with children? All kinds of inconveniences.
.
There is a bedside stool but no sofa by the window. The bathroom space is not spacious. Although there are double basins, they are almost close to each other, which loses the meaning of double basins. The supplies are good, including Parma water and a Dyson hair dryer. Of course, this is also what should be done. Some configurations.
.
The shower room and bathtub are built together, which is a design that I don't like very much, so even though it is a cast iron bathtub from Callandvi, I am not in the mood to take a bath. The shower system feels average.
.
Generally speaking, there are still many unreasonable things in the space design of this suite. In addition to the warm enough temperature, the living experience is not very comfortable. At this price, you can stay at Yihe Aman.

Sitting in the courtyard and staring at the tree in a daze, an afternoon passed like this. The spirit was greatly relaxed. The natural oxygen bar also relieved all kinds of pressure. I didn't want to go out when I arrived at the hotel. I just wanted to have a good rest. It was a very healing trip.

The package includes a one-night buffet. There are not many types, but the taste is good. Lamb chops and white fungus stewed with snow pear are well received. The breakfast is delicious.
Next time I will bring my baby here, bring the skylight, and have a good visit to the Expo.

Overall, I am quite satisfied. The hotel is antique, has a strong cultural a**osphere, an elegant environment, and polite, warm and thoughtful service. Breakfast and dinner dishes are rich and fresh, and my husband has a special liking for roasted pigeons.
In the evening, cartoons were played in the atrium, and we all stopped to watch for a long time, reminiscing about our childhood. Afternoon tea is also very relaxing and comfortable, and it feels like a paradise.
After the music festival, I called the front desk and sent a battery car to pick up tourists, one trip after another, and the staff worked hard.
The only regret is that the design of the bathroom is a bit awkward. It’s a bit strange to see a big bathtub when you enter the door. Of course, this is a design problem, and it may be that I didn’t appreciate the ingenuity.

The hotel is in the Expo Park, and you have to report your license plate every time you go in and out to take a taxi. There was also a music festival that closed the road, so the taxi couldn't get in, and you had to walk a distance in the hot sun to get out. The most impressive thing was that no one cared after checking out. There were high steps at the door to move the luggage. The concierge at the door helped the newly arrived guests with their luggage, and when he saw us checking out, he didn't ask if we needed help, etc. It didn't feel good.

The hotel is in the park, the scenery is very good, and the architectural style is very tasteful. It is very photogenic. The service staff's dress matches the temperament of the whole hotel very well. It is obvious that they have put their heart into it. The service attitude of the hotel staff is very good. Even if they pass by in the corridor, they will take the initiative to greet the guests. The hotel room is very spacious, clean and comfortable. It is particularly worth mentioning that the hotel's catering is in the park, so all three meals are eaten in the hotel. In fact, I was a little worried before because my wife is picky about food, but this time I was unexpectedly satisfied, especially the ingredients are very fresh (my wife's pick is mainly to care about whether the ingredients are fresh), and all three meals are very satisfied. The overall experience is very good. I have told the law firm's administration that I will try to set up the next team building here. The young people in the firm like Hanfu very much, and I guess they will be happier when they come.

However, the details of the hotel are not in place. 1️⃣ There is no staff in the swimming pool. Yes, there is no staff! I mean in the swimming pool, not to mention the lifeguard. If an accident occurs, the consequences will be disastrous. 2️⃣ The metal of the water outlet on the inner wall of the swimming pool scratched my family's feet. We didn't care at the time and thought it was a small cut. When we returned to the room, we found that a large piece of skin was broken and bleeding all the time. We asked the front desk for a band-aid, thinking that it would be fine the next day. Unexpectedly, it seriously affected walking the next day. 3️⃣ There were only two pairs of slippers and two sets of adult toothbrushes in the room for three people. I called to ask for children's toothbrushes and they said they would wait until 8:30 to go to work before sending them. It's outrageous. No hotel has ever replied like this. I said I couldn't wait until 8:30. The girl did send a toothbrush as soon as possible. I closed the door and took it out. It turned out to be an adult's. I called again and said that it was for adults, not children. The girl said that children's can only wait until 8:30. OK! The above is that this kind of problem should not occur in a hotel of this price range. I have stayed in too many hotels, and this is the first time. I hope the hotel will pay attention to it and make corrections.

The breakfast is rich in variety, not large in quantity, and enough. The service staff is still online, but there are some shortcomings in details (the food waste collection vehicle should not be placed in the restaurant, it should be covered)
The World Expo is still a bit bleak in this season, and the park staff are still repairing and arranging. There is a beer house in the town. When you walk in, the beer smells good and the quality feels good.
There are some stray dogs in the park, and most of the venues do not have actual exhibition projects. Only the botanical pavilion has exhibition projects.

Children can go to Chibabu Children's Park to play. The area is large and playable, but there is nothing particularly outstanding.

Special mention of this guest room facility.
1. The hardware of the shower room in the guest room is damaged and should be repaired in time;
2. The room is very warm, but very dry, which may be due to the climate in Beijing these days; the ceiling of the room is very high, and it seems that the energy consumption is not low;
3. The sanitation of the courtyard is a problem. There is a lot of dust accumulated in the corners. If conditions permit, it should be washed once a week with a high-pressure water gun

Overall, the hardware of domestic five-star brands is good, but the problem of disrepair is serious. The quality of the service staff of this hotel is relatively high among private brands.

I only stayed for one night this time. I didn’t have time to experience the hotel’s Hanfu activities. I didn’t go to the botanical museum or hot spring tickets. It’s a little regretful. I will bring my family to stay next time.

There is a projector on every wall with very good picture and sound effects. It’s really wonderful to watch domestic cartoons in a national-brand hotel.

The upgraded room is a suite with a courtyard, which is closer to a townhouse. A single house but not a single wall. The extremely high-decibel music next door continued to output. Hearing this is Africa from the Great Compassion Mantra was very depressing. Fortunately, after the staff prompted, the volume was reduced to "not noticeable to the naked ear."

The courtyard of the suite is large but poorly maintained and has low utilization rate. Most of the indoor area is allocated to the living room and office area, leaving very little space for the bedroom and bathroom area. Moreover, the shower and bathtub in the bathroom have no partitions and are enclosed in simple glass. The design does not feel suitable for the price of this room.

The plastic shell of the socket above the sink has fallen off. The cold and hot water in the shower are all red. I turned the red button and left it for a long time and the water became colder. Only then did I realize that both knobs were red. .

The accompaniment is water of Parma, which smells delicious.

The room has three types of heating equipment: floor heating, air conditioning, and electric heating. Every time I return to the room, I feel very warm both physically and mentally.

The park strictly restricts outside vehicles. Unregistered vehicles are not allowed to enter the park. Takeaways are only placed on the ground outside Gate No. 7. If you don't eat at the hotel, there don't seem to be any other good options for dining.

The staff's clothing is very distinctive.

msg:I saw the lanterns for the Lantern Festival, so I booked a hotel package package! You need to verify your license plate number when entering the park. There is a parking lot after entering the park. After the parking lot reaches the first floor, staff will guide you to the front desk to check in. Whether it is the restaurant or store, all the waiters and cleaners have very good service attitude, which is really great! On the fifteenth day of the first ***** month, we got lucky bags by guessing lantern riddles when we checked in. The one we won was Dorayaki. It’s a very nice hotel. Recommended.

Thank you very much for upgrading us to a small courtyard room. My children and I like it very much! We also gave snacks in the evening! The breakfast in the morning was also very good! Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, you can choose this place if you are bringing children with you. You will not be bored at all.

msg:I spent New Year's Eve at the hotel and was satisfied with everything. Maybe it's not the peak time yet, it's very clean and quiet, full of New Year a**osphere.

 Service: I have to give a big thumbs up to the service. All the service staff I met were super service-minded, enthusiastic and motivated, just like their own business. Any excellent service attitude must be a success in management, with top and bottom working together and having consistent interests. This is what business needs to do, and as a customer, I am very excited to see it. From the girls at the front desk, to the young man at the concierge, to the foreman in the restaurant, to the lady who ordered tea, to the shuttle bus driver... we all praised them all.

Aesthetics: The aesthetics of this hotel are so up to par. No wonder even Mercedes-Benz chooses this place for its events. Chinese traditional culture has a big reputation, but it is really empowering to have a hotel that holds traditional cultural projects. Like the tea ceremony and aroma ceremony, there are details in it. From the Chinese knot behind the door, the furnishings in the lobby, flowers and lamps, birds and cages, ginger tea in the public area, paper cups that "unify knowledge and action", and the selection of cultural and creative gifts. . . You can see the professional and delicate thoughts.

Architecture: Rebuilding the General's Mansion a hundred years ago. It's a bit like the Chinese Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York - everything is restored using the raw materials of ancient buildings. For details, please refer to the book "This Life in My Hometown" in the room. I like living in ancient buildings very much, just like I lived in Huajiantang Tanhua Mansion in Suzhou. The hotel has charm and style. There are many luxury hotels to choose from in Beijing, but the Anhui-style ancient architecture is unique in Beijing. This is the reason for my choice. From a marketing perspective, this feature is also the biggest differentiation and operating moat of this hotel.

Room: What I am quite satisfied with is that the room has 2 sinks, and the shower and bathtub are also in line with luxury hotel standards. The tea set and incense are very exquisite, and the orchids were chosen very quickly. The view outside the window is wide and the room is spacious; the shortcomings are: it is not a smart toilet, the TV is too small, and it is located diagonally opposite the bed. It is recommended that the hotel change the projection in the future.

Restaurant: The service attitude is excellent. The presentation is also beautiful, and there is a pot of my favorite pink rhododendron on the dining table. We had three meals in the restaurant. Lunch order-Huaiyang cuisine; dinner buffet with stove; breakfast buffet. However, I can only say that it is not a matter of attitude, but probably a matter of the level of the chef, or maybe there are restrictions on cooking fumes in the expo? It was really exhausting to eat.

 Things to do: I think the lanterns are pretty good to watch, but it’s too cold and they freeze back. You can go up to Yongning Tower to enjoy the breeze; the CITIC Bookstore on the top floor of the Botanical Garden is not interesting, but the wooden giraffe on the platform outside the bookstore is very artistic and worth checking in.

Just sauce. All in all, I was happy, except that Beijing was too cold. . . .

I really like the coffee machine in the room, so I don't have to drink instant coffee. Unfortunately, the weather was too cold and I couldn’t take photos in Hanfu. The staff are attentive and responsive. The lady at the front desk is patient and beautiful, especially the service staff at the swimming pool are enthusiastic and responsible. The location of the hotel is also very good. It is inside the Expo. You can directly enter the Expo after leaving the hotel. It is very close to the Botanical Garden, which is convenient for watching lanterns and playing around.

Tickets for hot springs, lantern festivals, botanical gardens, children's paradise, and snow parks are given away, which is great value! Very suitable for parents and children! For three days and two nights, the activities were fully arranged, and my daughter had a great time!

msg:I stayed with the elderly and children for two nights during the second half of the Spring Festival holiday. The hotel is very unique. The cultural experience is good. In addition to the ancient buildings themselves, there are also traditional cultural experience activities that children also like. The lanterns during the Spring Festival holiday are also worth seeing. The service is generally good, and the service staff are warm and thoughtful. When checking in at the front desk, the waiting time was a bit long due to the large number of people. Dinner is a buffet hot pot included in the room rate, and the overall quality is okay. But eating two nights in a row was a bit repetitive. Hope there will be more extensive ordering services.

msg:I came to the Expo Garden to watch the lanterns, and chose a hotel inside the Expo Garden. The hotel is an Anhui-style building, antique, and well-furnished. It is suitable for bringing children. Over the past decade, Nezha Mind has been playing on the wall at the entrance of the hotel. Two projectors were playing at the same time, which was very shocking. There are also experience projects such as making lanterns, making velvet flowers, writing blessing characters, lighting incense, and ordering tea. The breakfast and dinner buffets are also very rich. The key is that you can watch the lanterns when you go out, and the children will have a great time.
The only suggestion is that the hotel is too warm and there is a big difference in temperature from the outside.

msg:Hygiene: Cleaning is very careful. Cups, teapots, and bedding are all clean. If you use the bathtub, you still have to clean it yourself. There are no disposable bathtub bags. It is worth noting that the room only provides 4 bottles of free mineral water. After calling for water, 2 more bottles were provided, and then there was a charge. The water bar in the room only had 4 capsules of coffee, 1 can each of Coke, Sprite, and beer, and tea bags. 2, the tea quality is average. It is not convenient to shop or order takeout near the hotel, so it is recommended to bring your own water and snacks.
Environment: Entering the hotel from the basement, exiting the elevator is a unique experience. The hotel imitates Huizhou architecture, with carved flowers, white walls, and stone lion details. It is easy to film. The hotel lobby has a strong Spring Festival a**osphere, and there are dragons everywhere, which is very beautiful. The hotel we stayed in to see the World Lantern Festival had all kinds of beautiful lights.
Facilities: The overall maintenance of the room is pretty good, but the hardware is indeed a bit poor. The nozzle above the shower room does not produce water. The gray sofa in front of the window is a bed and is not very clean. Some of the wall plugs near the bed are not powered, and some have plugs. No, the light switch in the room is not sensitive and needs to be pressed several times before it responds. The fan is noisy and does not have a silent mode. I turned it off for fear of making noise when sleeping, and it was not cold when I arrived.
Service: The biggest plus point is the service. It is super good. Any problems can be responded to immediately and solved quickly. The service staff in the lobby, restaurant and handicraft depar**ent are super enthusiastic and sincere.

The a**osphere of Pushen is so strong. Concierge Master Cui and Li Jing provide good service.
Although the temperature dropped during my stay, with the outdoor temperature being as low as ten degrees below zero, the temperature in the room was very comfortable. Even the seat by the window was warm and not cold at all. It was very comfortable to relax by the window while watching the scenery.
There are many activities in the hotel, including explanations of ancient buildings, taking rubbings with children, watercolor painting, etc. In addition, there is an ice carnival in the park, a botanical museum tour, and it is still very busy for a two-night stay.

msg:The simple and elegant architectural style has always been my favorite. Pushen is like a piece of beautiful jade hidden in the world garden, always waiting for the destined person to meet her. It’s always the inadvertent little details that touch the depths of your soul, and this hotel is the moment that touches you in the details! Walking in the long corridor with ancient charm, you are greeted by modest gentlemen dressed in the attire of Song Dynasty literati. You travel through thousands of years in a trance, exploring the vague historical background. This is the perfect place to slow down, immerse yourself, and give your body and mind a vacation! Special thanks to Xiao Kai for his careful explanation, which allowed us to better understand Pushen, the Expo, and the ancient Chinese architecture that has been passed down for thousands of years.

msg:I canceled my trip to Harbin at the last minute and booked Pushen in a hurry. It was originally an ancient building from the Ming Dynasty. No wonder it gives people a sense of timelessness everywhere. It really gave me a full surprise. Breaking the convention of a large flat-floor suite, I was given an independent small courtyard; when I opened the simple door, I was greeted by a small courtyard dotted with snow. The antique-style bed, modern sofa, and Phalaenopsis bring a touch of spring to the house. The biggest surprise is that there is a small snowman piled on the table in the courtyard.
The only drawback is that the nozzle in the shower area may not have considered the actual position during bathing and is too far to the side; the drain outlet of the sink basin needs to be cleaned more.
But this one is so unforgettable, I can’t wait for summer to come.

We stayed in four hotels in total, from [Sunrise Oriental Kempinski Hotel] to [Commune at the Foot of the Great Wall]. Then go to [Beijing Expo Pushen Hotel], and the last day is [Sanlitun Tongying Interstate Hotel]
[Beijing Expo Pushen Hotel] is my most... most anticipated hotel. It is exactly the same as the photos posted by the hotel. The hotel's environment is very good, and the natural landscape❄️❄️ is really first-class! After receiving a call from the hotel front desk on the 20th, he first helped me confirm the license plate number (so that when I go to the gate outside the hotel, I can drive directly into the hotel parking lot, because the weather outside is really freezing, -13 degrees below zero, avoid We were too cold, very considerate🤩🤩￼), when we went to the hotel front desk to check in on the 21st, it must be Bessie (Snow or Kayi) who was very polite and told me enthusiastically because we had a little boy with us. , she will help us upgrade the original room to a room with a small courtyard, so that the children can run around and play in the small courtyard with ❄️snow❄️. The children should be very happy￼☃️Suddenly feel very warm I am really grateful for the heartwarming service! ￼
Then……..
It's not over yet. The hotel service is very commendable. It is really heartwarming and heart-warming￼￼!
On the first night, because the weather in Beijing was too cold, the room was relatively dry and our skin was really dry. Then we called the front desk and told the front desk about our situation. Sister Xiujuan (who seems to be named Yan) from the room service immediately helped. We prepared a dehumidifier and a lot of water! I was very touched and thoughtfully told us to be careful and keep warm, especially the children👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍￼
And... there are also 3 ladies from [Rubbing Experience] 👧, one of them is Miss Tingting, they are very enthusiastic about playing with my children, which makes my children very happy, very happy ￼, when he left the hotel, he told me: Dad, I don’t want to leave, I want to stay here for a few more days, it’s really beautiful here, very beautiful, I like it very much! ￼I also like playing with Sister Tingting and the others￼!
Once again, I would like to thank all the front desk, room attendants and restaurant staff at [Beijing Expo Pushen Hotel] for making our trip this time. It was only because of staying in your hotel that we felt it was perfect!
But it also makes us a little regretful. We should stay in your hotel for the entire 8-day trip this time. It might be more perfect! 🥹🥹

After arriving, you can drive directly to the hotel parking lot from Gate 7. The hotel replicates the Southern Second-grade General's Mansion. Many of the wood materials are specially transported old objects. The hotel has special explanation services. The service staff are all dressed in ancient costumes and are very serious and responsible. The hotel provides ancient costumes, makeup, and photography services. Clothing 400 yuan/person, makeup and photoshooting are 400 yuan/person.
The facilities in the room are complete, the bedding is very soft and comfortable, the washing supplies are equipped with water of Parma, there is a smart toilet in the room, teapots and tea sets are all available, and the water is co-branded by Baisui Mountain (the water I will add later is Nongfu Spring). Drinking tea and burning incense can relax your mind. The room service is attentive and attentive. If you call for water, slippers and quilts, they will be arranged immediately.
The Expo Park is very large. There is currently a botanical museum open. You need to buy an additional ticket. You can walk to the China Pavilion and Yongning Pavilion. Because of winter, there were not many people in the park, and at night there were only some workers installing lanterns for the lantern festival.
There is an all-day dining restaurant in the hotel. The breakfast is very exquisite. The coffee is capsule coffee co-branded by Starbucks. It is very thoughtful. For dinner, we had a side dish with plenty of ingredients. A large family ordered two portions, but ended up not finishing the meal. I had afternoon tea in the hotel. It was located on the second floor attic and felt average.
The hot spring is a hot spring hotel outside the Expo Park. The hotel has a swimming pool.
It's suitable for you to come and relax on the weekend after a busy week. However, if you are taking children to play, it may be cold in winter and there are not many activities for children to play.

There is also a very nice private hot spring bath in the hotel, which is clean and hygienic.

msg:The hotel is so beautiful. There is a painting outside every window, and the design is relatively reasonable. When you go out, you can reach Longqing Street, which is antique and reminds you of Jiangnan in the Ming Dynasty. The night view is even better. The waiter was also very nice, Xiaoxue brought vegetables. Great experience. Want to come again.
The only shortcoming: the functions of the smart toilet are not very good, and the light switch is delayed obviously

msg:After weighing for a long time, I finally chose the Pushen Hotel located in the Expo. The antique Hui-style architecture is quiet and warm. There were some minor issues during check-in, but the manager and service staff resolved them sincerely, and I experienced the warmth and attentive and meticulous service that made me feel at home. The three families spent a comfortable three days and two nights here. If you come to Yanqing again, you will choose Pushen. It has a spacious and luxurious living environment, a very matching warm and thoughtful service level, and more experiential activities suitable for all ages. Of course, there are exquisite and rich dining options, both software and hardware. Excellent, no flaws. This is a rare hotel. I hope it will continue to prosper with its simplicity like its name! I would also like to thank the housekeeper Xiaoxue Xiaotong for her warmth and thoughtfulness!

It has an oversized room, a smart toilet, wet and dry partitions, a large tea drinking area, which is rare in five-star hotels. Dinner was a buffet. It was a personal preference and I didn’t eat it. But the breakfast was very good. I booked a battery car to drive around the hotel. It's a very large country and the journey takes about 20 minutes. I also got hot spring tickets and various coupons. It's absolutely great value for money. I'll wait until the spring flowers bloom. , must check in again

msg:I have been planning to stay there for a long time. I have been to the Expo three times and finally stayed here. This time I brought the young and old here, and I specially chose Wangshen because it is right inside the Expo, at Gate 7, so it is very convenient for the young and old to walk to see the lanterns at night! If you call the staff in advance and report your car number, you can enter and exit directly through Gate 7. Parking is free. There are only Tesla electric piles in the garage, and you need to go through the corridor to the lobby on the upper floor. There are concierge staff to help with luggage. The service is very good, and the staff wear ancient costumes, which are also very distinctive. When I arrived at the front desk, I was greeted by Bing Xin. The service was very warm, and I would arrange everything. I added WeChat to send the hotel notice, and I also took the initiative to inform that from the small door on the side of the breakfast room, crossing Longqing Street is the Lantern District. It is a five-minute walk, which is very convenient. , It is highly recommended to bring the old and the young! The hotel style is Chinese style, strictly speaking Anhui style. It is beautiful and the elderly like it very much! The hotel is very quiet and the courtyard is beautiful. There are four bottles of water in the room, the mini bar is free, there are four capsules of coffee, and the tea is very fragrant! There are not many people staying here. Follow the prompts and you will arrive at Yongning Tower in 10 minutes after going out the main entrance. The amount of exercise is just right for young and old. There are also few people for breakfast. There are freshly cooked noodles, wontons, and delicious pancakes. Others are available in various star wines. As for the standard meal, the operation of the coffee machine was a little complicated, so I asked for help to get it right. The last thing I want to say is that there is a package now, with the newly opened iQiyi Qibabu Paradise, which is not far from the Hyatt Place Hotel. It is very big and new, so it is more suitable for bringing the young and old, haha

The Pushen Hotel is in the park, and the housekeeper will call one day in advance to register the license plate number. Drive directly in from Gate 7 and follow the road signs to park directly in the hotel's underground parking lot, which is very convenient. Compared with Tangquan, Pushen's environment and service are significantly better than Tangquan. The service staff took the initiative to say hello and take the initiative to take the table. The service response efficiency is also very high. I commend Miss Xiaoxue by name. The service is very enthusiastic and the check-in explanation is very clear. The overall architectural style of the hotel is unified, and it looks great when taking photos in Hanfu.

msg:Staying at the Beijing Expo Pushen Hotel gives people the feeling of stepping into a small town in the south. The Hui-style architecture and the old wooden pillars make the whole building look more retro and chronological. The scenery during the day and at night They are all different. There are cartoons playing back and forth on the wall at night, which looks quite shocking. The most impressive thing at night was the waiter who was patrolling with a lantern. Haha, why do you say he is a waiter? Because when you enter the hotel, you feel like you have traveled through time. The retro building and all the staff are all in Song Dynasty costumes. It really feels like different.

Let’s talk about the food. The buffet tastes really good. As long as your stomach is big enough, you can really eat a lot of delicious food. There are refreshments every afternoon after 2 p.m., which taste good. The main reason is that the place where you have refreshments has a more a**ospheric feel. It is rare to have leisure time and quiet enjoyment.

It was quite comfortable to live in. We lived in a detached house. We walked through the alley and entered the courtyard. There were flowers and plants in the front and back of the house. There was also a table in the backyard for drinking tea and chatting, which gave people a comfortable feeling. When we formally entered the room, we first It is a foyer, and then a small living room, with a surrounding sofa and a large floor-standing reading lamp. Sitting on it can make people relax instantly and forget the fatigue of the journey. Further inside, the toilet is a small single room separated from the shower. Opposite the toilet is a small room for changing clothes, with a full-length mirror. Further inside is an extra large double bed. When you lie on the bed, you can see the trees in the courtyard, and you can bask in the sun from the bed. , it feels very lazy. Both the bathtub and shower are in the bedroom, with glass partitions. When you lie in the bathtub, you can still see the yard through the window. The whole room is very bright and independent, and it does not interfere with other rooms and is soundproofed. The effect is very good, the privacy is very strong, suitable for families with children, the baby is really easy to disturb the next door, or business people can enjoy a quiet space.

The service can be said to be really great. When you look at the baby, they all help push the stroller and are very caring. The smile always hangs on their face. They are also very enthusiastic and make people feel warm.

We checked in during the National Day, and it was already getting cold. The temperature inside the room was very suitable, but it was a little cold outside. You need to remember to bring a thick coat, it was quite cold in the morning and evening.

The quality is the best representation of the hotel's grade.

The hotel has a free shuttle bus that can take guests to the park and the station. In terms of catering, because there are more people during the Mid-Autumn Festival, the set menu has been upgraded to a buffet, which has a lot more choices. Next time I come to Yanqing, I will continue to choose Pushen. Thank you to every staff member.

The hotel environment and service are very good. The front desk is very responsible, answering all questions and explaining the tour. A lot. The disadvantage is that the hotel is very slow to eat at night. I went to eat at 6:30 and ordered a set meal, but the meal was served very slowly. It was not until around 8 pm that the food was served. Moreover, the waiters at the hotel were working with their children. I just served the noodles for the children. It doesn’t matter if adults eat late, but it’s not good for children. Children won’t eat well after dinner time. I hope it can be improved.

msg:As the children in my family grow up slowly, the parent-child hotels I choose are not limited to some familiar parent-child hotels that focus on entertaining animals. At present, the child is six years old, which is an important stage of thinking and cognition, and the old mother is also troubled by this. Checked in countless hotels, resorts, and entertainment venues. Today, I accidentally found a very low-key and connotative hotel in Beijing. It is the only hotel in the World Expo, Pusen. First of all, I received a call from the lady after I made the reservation to tell me if there are any vehicles that need to be included. , and children's amusement park play time. Then we came here with great anticipation. To be honest, we were not very happy about the luggage service link between the parking lot and the lobby at the beginning, because it was very inconvenient, but when we raised it with the hotel depar**ent, the efficiency improved very quickly. Including some small details, Manager Guo of the hotel is indeed the person in charge. In just half a day, we fully saw the difference in the hotel. The bad parts were immediately improved. We are very pleased and willing to recommend friends around us. come here. Everyone knows from the earliest Mid-Levels that the hotel I recommend is definitely not for any purpose. From field trips to multiple visits, children's feelings, from old to young, from food to environment, from service to hygiene, are absolutely perfect. The hahaha who offended the hotel 100% said everything to the point. But to be honest this time, it is comparable to the antique flavor of Aman, and the southern Huizhou architecture that comes with it. I will not introduce the specific history because the hotel will arrange corresponding historical introductions and some suitable traditional activities every day. What I want to recommend now is accommodation. This time I experienced two nights, which are the basic room type and the pool house with a yard. First of all, what the public can accept is definitely a hotel with super high cost performance. The room is square and has no peculiar smell. The sanitation is good, the hotel's bed is very comfortable, there are two big ones and one small one, and it's no problem for children to turn over. Then the water in the house is also a joint brand of Baisui Mountain, so it is no problem for children to drink it. Then the location is more convenient to go to the lobby in the main building. Then I would like to talk about the main recommendation is the one with a yard. The location is not far from the restaurant, but the paths are all red lanterns that feel like a quadrangle courtyard, decorated with green hydrangeas, and walking in the blue sky and white clouds feels good. I also ran into a black cat, which is also very cute and will not hurt children. Today’s courtyard is a typical Huizhou general’s residence. The courtyard is not big but the design is reasonable. If it rains or snows, I believe that the indoor transparent bubble pool is the best choice. It is said that there can be a hot pot set meal in the yard in winter 👍I am looking forward to it. It is absolutely romantic to eat hot pot and take a bath in the yard in the snow. The layout of the room is reasonable and a**ospheric, and it is OK for children to play and play without affecting each other. The cleaning staff is also very serious and can clean with a two-person supervision system, and considerately prepared children-related supplies for the children. When it comes to meals, the breakfast is actually a bit worse than other services, but it is considered complete. We ordered dinner at the restaurant. The taste is quite satisfactory. It is more suitable to have a set meal. One or two dishes in the restaurant will definitely fill you up. Each service staff is also very distinctive in their clothes. Many people come here to take pictures. There are also photography agencies stationed here to take pictures of unique Hanfu. The night service car is even better. Master Cui’s car service is also very caring. He is very nice to the children and drives very steadily. The little girl at the front desk smiles and gives people a very festive feeling. It seems that the hotel is solemn but not heavy. I hope that under my introduction, it can become the first choice for everyone's parents and children. Compared with Banshan Hot Springs, Gubei Water Town is very good for children to expand their horizons. There is currently a free Lantern Festival at night. The weather is comfortable for a walk. The scenic spot has its own library on the top of the mountain. You can go directly to the Botanical Garden if you buy tickets. A comfortable day. On a quiet and comfortable day, lie in bed, soak in a hot bath and have a midnight snack. Share it with everyone. I hope that you, like me, will continue to find more suitable travel places for your children to enjoy parent-child time.

One person carried the valuables and the other took care of the trolley. They worked seriously and responsibly. Dressed in ancient costumes, they really felt like this ancient building. It's a perfect match 👍 Xiao Xia Xiaoxue Jingwen at the front desk takes care of every aspect very carefully. Since we have a wheelchair, they have to contact the restaurant every day to open a relatively flat door. In their warm service, the old man felt very good👍
It's very close to the hotel to watch the Expo Lantern Festival and take a stroll. The lantern festival is very beautiful.
After checking out, they patiently helped us take our luggage to the underground parking lot to be packed before saying goodbye to us and going to work👍👍👍

From the moment I entered the hotel to check in, I was fanned by the gentle lady at the front desk, Coco, who quickly helped us with the formalities, and also provided very detailed introductions and travel information. Another easter egg is that Coco was responsible for the architectural explanation provided by the hotel at 4:00 p.m. He gave us a detailed introduction to the history and characteristics of Huizhou architecture, and I was very happy to learn a lot of knowledge. The second easter egg is that she also introduced the handsome boy Mo to take us to visit the calligraphy house. Xiao Mo looks like a combination of Hu Ge and Zhu Yilong. He is very patient with children and took them to write calligraphy works and expand paintings. Thank you very much for bringing us the warmth of being at home, five-star praise!
Next, let’s talk about the rooms. Each suite is a private courtyard, quiet and warm without being disturbed. The rooms meet the five-star standard, comfortable and upscale. Knowing the birthday of the old man, I also arranged a small surprise.
The only thing that needs to be improved is the environment of the restaurant. There are a lot of flies at breakfast. If it can be improved, it will be a perfect hotel!
We will be back.

The restaurant is also delicious, but now they only have set menus and a la carte. Since there are not many people in the off-season, there is no buffet, which is a bit missed.

Even though it is a rainy night to enjoy the lanterns this time, it is not the same as wonderful.

Went to Badaling Safari Park the next day and had a great weekend! Recommended for families with the elderly and children!

msg:There is nothing to say about the external environment. The exit is the Guishui River, which is located in the Shiyuan Park and entered from Gate 7. Going this season, even walking in the garden feels very comfortable. It takes a few minutes to walk to the Lantern Festival. The huge lanterns are especially popular with children.
The room is a standard room, and the area is just right. The layout is not bad, similar to the room layout of Banyan Tree in Bali.
There is only one restaurant. Although there are not many types of breakfast, they are all worth tasting, and there is no thunder. You need to order for lunch and dinner. The dishes are good, and the portions are relatively large. I ordered too much on the first night...
The most surprising thing is that the hotel feels very high-quality, antique, quiet and clean.
The service is another surprise. Very humane. On the first day, the big-eyed brother has been helping our family with the baby. I have been scattered all the time. He has been helping to pick up things and deliver them 😂 and even opened the cartoon screening in advance. The children are very happy . Then I took out the lotus lantern and placed it in the front hall with the child. The child was so happy. Every time I see him passing by, I say, "It's that little brother". Because I said in advance that I would celebrate my child's birthday, I helped with the simple layout of the room, and the service staff in the restaurant also took the initiative to deliver birthday noodles. The service details are really good.
This time with the elderly and children, I didn't go too far around. The surrounding scenery is still good. Similar to the style of Yanqi Hotel, both hotels are located near natural landscapes. The hardware here is a little bit worse, but my overall feeling is far better than that of Yanqi Hotel.
It is one of the hotels I have experienced in Beijing that I would like to use again and again
highly recommended

Although there are not many types of breakfast, they are all exquisite and delicious. Especially in the evening and early morning, it is great to have the whole world garden to ourselves.

The Hui-style architectural hotel in the Expo is full of features, with a first-class a**osphere, warm and comfortable rooms, and remarkable services. The style is very similar to Fuchun Mountain Residence in Hangzhou, with the same two-story building, the same garden interior, the same room style, the same service mode, and a strong sense of ceremony, very good! The package includes a lot of tickets. Compared with the price, I am very satisfied; compared with the gold diamond, it can be improved. recommend!

This hotel is really worth recommending for its price and service. It is enough to prove it by recommending it to classmates and colleagues My favorite, the antique background and comfortable environment, the two-day schedule is a bit rushed, next time if I can stay for two days, I can take a good look around here

msg:On the weekend of the summer vacation, I stayed at the Pushen Hotel in the Expo, and booked a hotel package on Ctrip. In addition to the standard room, it also included tickets, breakfast and dinner, travel photography, and afternoon tea. After confirming the room with the front desk of the hotel one day in advance, the waitress was very enthusiastic and told me which door to enter, when to check in, how to park, etc. Arrived early at 12 noon, and a room was already available. The young lady at the front desk checked in very quickly, and after the check-in, there was a special little brother who led us to the room. Thank you to all the staff who have helped us with our entry and departure in the past few days: Xiaoke, Xiaoxue, Xiaohu, Manager Xia, Li Jing, and Master Cui. Every time I see them, I greet them with a smile. Afternoon tea is in the tea room on the 2nd floor. Seats for 5 people have been reserved in advance. I ordered white tea and coffee, and served various nuts, fruits, and pastries. In the afternoon, I took my son to the swimming pool to swim and soak in a hot spring. In the evening, I finished the buffet I went to the Lantern Festival for a stroll, and I had a very fulfilling day. The next day we made an appoin**ent for travel shooting at 9:00, and Mr. Wen Yang arrived at the hotel at 8:30, and made a step-by-step comparison of the filming points in advance. During the shooting process, we kept communicating and designing various actions. After shooting in the morning, I sent the edited photos in the evening, I am super happy.

msg:I liked this hotel very much after reading the reviews before. This time I chose Pushen to show the lanterns for the elderly, and I feel that I made the right choice.
First of all, the location of the hotel is excellent. It is in the Shiyuan Park, not far from the Huadeng District scenic spot, especially suitable for the elderly who cannot walk far. Besides, the architecture is unique in Huizhou style. Living in it feels like I have become a Part of the landscape.
The environment of the hotel is quiet, because it is off-peak travel, so there are very few people staying in the hotel, it is very quiet, relaxing and comfortable ~ the attitude of the service staff is also very good, they greet you anytime and anywhere, and ask what you need. We stayed here on the first day The smell of the water in the room was a bit strong. The next day when the front desk learned about it, they changed the room immediately. They have a strong sense of service. I would also like to thank Manager Xia, Ke Ke, Xiao Kai, Master Cui, Li Jing, Xiao Gao and Master Zhao Xiaoliang~
Of course, after talking about the advantages, I also want to make some suggestions. The food tastes good, but the price/performance ratio is not high, especially the breakfast, which may be changed to a semi-buffet because there are few guests, and there are few options. My personal understanding may be that I am afraid of waste, but I also hope to be more diverse~ However, the snacks for afternoon tea are good, I recommend everyone to try~
In general, this is a relatively satisfactory experience, and I will come again if I have the opportunity in the future, and I hope the hotel will be better and better!

Speaking of service, all the staff are warm and polite. Special praise to Ms. Yang, the make-up artist of the Hanfu Museum, for her high level of make-up and for helping to choose clothes and match shoes. Makeup is very detailed. A very satisfying experience. Let's talk about a little brother named Mo, who is handsome and nice! Take the initiative to take the children to help take pictures, the effect is not inferior to professional photography! Introduce the hotel architecture to the children, and accompany the children to make handmade games! It really has to be praised! With such employees, are you afraid that there will be no repeat customers! awesome!

Xiaojie and Xiaoxue even worked overtime at night to pick us up from the Lantern Square back to the hotel, worrying that we might get lost, very considerate . The little brother Wen Yang of the travel photography is also very professional in taking pictures, and the makeup artist Yang Jing is also kind-hearted, which is very suitable for parents and children to travel and play. Treasure-level hotel, I will open it again next time, it is a hotel with culture, story and depth. It is very worthwhile for everyone to come and play. The service staff is professional and good-looking, a visual feast, and the open-air movie at night is also fascinated by children. The design sense is full, and it is a stress-relieving accommodation experience. The explanation given by Niu Niu in the morning is also very good. After check out, he will send us back to the parking lot. It is a very considerate service. A hotel with five-star praise, the sunset is as beautiful as falling into a painting.

msg:It is a very good hotel. It can be seen from various details that the hotel operator has taste and the staff are of high quality.
The exquisite Hui-style mansion is said to be a copy of a general’s mansion in Anhui. The stone and wood carvings are also directly moved here. It is particularly charming. There are explanations of ancient buildings every morning and afternoon. If you are interested, listen to the suggestions. In the evening, the courtyard The wall projection is the classic work of Shanghai Animation Film Studio, "Nezha Naohai". The picture quality and sound effects are very good, and it matches the ancient buildings very well, and it will not disturb the people in the room.
In addition to the building itself, the detailed design of the guest rooms is also in place. I especially like the refrigerator and shower room. The refrigerator is much larger than the average hotel, and the cooling is also good. It is a surprise. The shower room not only has a convenient and spacious table for storing sundries, but also has seats, which is very convenient for the elderly. There are hooks outside the bathroom and shower doors, which is very user-friendly.
The service is very thoughtful, from the security personnel at the gate and garage, to Xiao Zhang at the front desk, Jing Wen, Bing Xin, a gentle and handsome intern who has been helping us with luggage and wheelchairs for two days, and another handsome guy in Hanfu, as well as the restaurant, The staff I met everywhere in the hotel were all warm and courteous with smiles on their faces. For those who travel with two elderly people, good service is very important, thank you very much.
There was a wedding today by chance, and the various services were not overwhelmed by the busyness, so the residents were all happy and joyful.
Pity:
The park is very large, and the greenery is well maintained, but you can’t drive, and there are no alternative sightseeing tools, resulting in a limited range of activities and a long journey. It’s too bad to live for one day, and there’s nothing to do if you live for two days. It’s recommended that the park refer to the model of Yanqi Island , arrange some park tours, venue visits, water sightseeing and other projects, so that everyone can stay for a few more days.
All in all, I strongly recommend this hotel, the business is booming, see you next time.

He has no complaints at all, and has been wishing the children a good game. Thanks to Master Cui, and thanks to the hotel for changing the time to provide breakfast and dinner.
It is especially suitable for vacationing with family and elderly people. Quiet, with the entire park as a leisure venue. Running is also very comfortable, with a lap of 6.5 kilometers. High oxygen content. Very very good. I don't know how to boast. Come and try it!

msg:The hotel is very, very recommended to stay in. This parent-child trip, the children were very happy. The hotel's facilities and services are very considerate. There is such a quiet place in Beijing that allows you to travel back to the Ming Dynasty and experience the architectural style of the Ming Dynasty. It's really amazing! I would like to thank Xiao Gao, the beautiful housekeeper. Although I stayed for one day, I encountered a heavy rain during the swim with my child the next day. I couldn’t come back directly in the park. The child was soaked in a raincoat. I sent a WeChat message to Xiao Gao. Although the hotel’s battery car has time slots and pick-up destinations, due to special circumstances, we directly sent the hotel’s battery car to pick us up. I am also very grateful that my child and I hid from the rain in another battery car in the park. It should be the park’s battery car staff. We were going to take us to the hotel, but the hotel’s battery car was almost here, so I refused the master’s kindness, but my heart was full of touch. The lantern show at the Lantern Art Festival was great, and the children were very happy to see it. It’s just that the weather on the second day was not good. Yanqing is so beautiful. I think the people in Yanqing are so kind, and they are very fond of it. This hotel will definitely bring my family two times and three times. Next time, I must stay for two more days!

I also mentioned the precautions. I was afraid that I would not remember too much and sent it directly to the mobile phone. It is really not too considerate. The room is also very clean and the facilities are relatively advanced. When staying in the hotel, you can also see the lanterns in the garden. If you have a chance, you will stay here again.

Since I booked the Hanfu travel photo for my child late, I specially delayed it check out. The lanterns at the World Expo at night are worth seeing. There is no sultry heat in the urban area, and the breeze blows, but it still feels cool.

msg:how to say?
This hotel has the same style as the World Garden, the outside is extremely grand and gorgeous, but the inside...it’s hard to say
The interior decoration style is very strange. Two yellow wooden boxes are placed on the wall, and the seats directly block some functions. Although I don’t necessarily use cabinets when I live in a hotel, it is not satisfactory. The carpet is spliced ​​in three pieces. I think it’s probably because Book a special room type, the bathroom is not pictured, and the decoration is also very strange. The hotel in 2019 does not have a smart toilet, and it needs to be improved. The standard of bath products is okay, and the fragrance is in line with the hotel's temperament.
It is worth mentioning that it is rare for a hotel in Beijing to provide such good service. Every staff member answers every question, with a sincere attitude that is visible to the naked eye. It is really comfortable.
Rich breakfast, not many varieties, good taste
Service: Sincere
Environment: The overall transplantation of Huizhou-style architecture supports the entire hotel's facade

This is not only a luxury hotel, but also a treasure standing in a historical building! For a person who loves ancient architecture, she is my mother, and the long river of dusty history emerges in my eyes at this moment! Hui style architecture, Wufeng Tower, century-old wood, cloisonné,... and 2 plaques engraved with mottled history. When entering the front desk, there is really a feeling of time travel. The staff at the front desk are all dressed in Hanfu. Every move Every frown and smile is upright, just like everyone's ladies.

msg:"Second brush is worth it"
I came here the summer of the previous year. I was attracted by the architecture. It was generally low-key and dignified. It was a good experience to stay at that time. It just served the Buddhist family. It was leisurely and insipid, and it fit well with the whole. The main focus is on slowness.
This time I brought my parents, and the surprises continued. The first is the hotel service. The service system should be updated. The warm and warm balance is just right, and many projects have been launched. The staff wearing Hanfu explained the Hui style architecture. Look at carved beams and painted buildings, and put water lanterns at night to pray for blessings, and experience Hanfu. . .
Xiao Xia at the front desk is cute, meticulous and warm.
The breakfast has also improved, there are not many varieties, but the taste is good.
It can be seen that everyone is working hard, come on!
The second surprise is the Lantern Festival after dark. It feels like a private room, and the funds are burned for us😅 At this time, the advantage of living in Pushen comes out again. No matter how late you are, you will not be too tired to go back. The side door of the restaurant leads directly to the lantern exhibition area ~ simple Pushen's security guard was afraid that we, old and young, would walk too much, so he told me the two routes patiently and in detail, and felt that he really wanted to draw a map for me.
I can't say any more, I'm afraid that the price will increase if there are too many people, and I won't be able to book a room if I go again. . .
Look at the picture and take care of yourself

After an hour's drive, I soon arrived at the hotel surrounded by green trees and mountains, where blue sky and white clouds, green grass, scattered flowers are in full bloom, and in the clumps of reeds, groups of wild ducks sing cheerfully on the quiet water. Singing, the beautiful Huizhou-style courtyards make people feel relaxed and happy. The front desk staff Xiao Gao and Nan Nan received us very warmly and caringly, and they introduced me in detail. Originally booked a king bed and a Songyue suite, we were upgraded to two suites.

After settling down, I took my mother to do a relaxing massage with essential oils. The professional technique of masseuse Xiaohong made my mother full of praise. Xiaohong taught my mother which acupoints to treat migraine headaches, which acupoints to treat cervical discomfort, and how to massage for gray hair. ...Mother is very happy to say that she has learned health care knowledge from Teacher Xiaohong.
The hotel arranged a battery car to pick us up for a visit to the Expo. In the hot weather, it is really pleasant to take a car to enjoy the scenery.
The shopping activities in the China Duty Free Store are very good. There are many dazzling products for us to choose from. It is really a perfect combination of tourism and shopping.
The restaurant is clean and tidy, with a wide variety of food, very rich and delicious, and the dining environment is very good.
On the top of the hill to the east of the small courtyard, the majestic building, we sat under the big names with good weather and clear river, and had a bird's-eye view of the beautiful surroundings and the cool breeze. We really felt that our trip was worthwhile.

I booked the Songyue Room Suite. When I checked in, the front desk Zhang Ke arranged the largest Songyue Room, a large courtyard, and a pavilion for rest and coolness, which was very comfortable. The restaurant Wang Hua was very enthusiastic. After lunch, he introduced us to the past experience of the hotel. Only then did we know that this hotel has so many stories. The hotel is located in the Expo. If you want to visit the Expo, you can tell the front desk at any time. The battery car can send the guests to the designated location. When you are tired of shopping, you can make a phone call to take the guests back to the hotel. This service is very considerate and suitable for With such a huge Expo, you are not afraid to walk wherever you go. The battery car drivers, Master Cui and Master Li Jing, took us back and forth several times, without a single complaint, and they also enthusiastically introduced us to the various venues of the Expo. Because the experience was so good, I also booked a room for my parents. When the front desk Xiao Gao heard that it was arranged for his parents, he immediately upgraded it to Songyue Room and checked in in advance. It is worth experiencing each season of spring, summer, autumn and winter here, and looking forward to the next journey.

msg:After the Dragon Boat Festival, taking advantage of the improvement of the epidemic situation, I quickly took my parents out to play, contacted the hotel in advance to register the license plate number, and entered the park smoothly on the day of check-in. The hotel is located in the World Horticultural Exhibition, with a superior location, and it can be reached within ten minutes on foot from the most essential attractions. And there is a battery car to pick up and drop off, so you don't have to worry about walking too far and you are not physically strong. It is very suitable for traveling with your parents.
Talking about the room, it is about 40 square meters, the dry and wet are separated, the double sinks, that is, the height from the ground is relatively high, it does not matter to adults. (ps: The design of facing the bathtub as soon as you enter the door is very interesting) The bed is soft and comfortable, the room is soundproof, and I can hear my dad talking next door😅. Free drinks in the refrigerator and capsule coffee machine are not bad.
During the epidemic, breakfast was a Chinese or Western set meal, and dinner was set A and B. The four of us happened to have two meals for two, cold dishes, soup, a few hot dishes, as well as desserts and fruit plates, which could fill a table with fresh ingredients. , the quantity is full.
The hotel is not big, but it is better in the park. It is very convenient to integrate play and accommodation.

You can walk around the Expo Park casually, not only to exercise, but also to enjoy the beautiful scenery. The beauty of killing two birds with one stone. The only small regret is that the breakfast was a little simpler during the epidemic🤏. All in all a five star recommendation!

Maybe we went to live on Sunday, there are very few people in the park, and the view is full of natural beauty, which is very comfortable. The hotel staff is very friendly. Dine-in has just resumed today. Since the hotel's catering is not ready, the staff specially drove us to other restaurants in the park for dinner, and then took us back to the hotel after the meal. Also experienced an essential oil pedicure and parent-child activities, great value!

msg:The hardware of the hotel is excellent, but the service is such a mess that it shatters to the floor. The hotel is on the north side of the Expo Park. Visitors to the Expo usually enter through Gate 1 on the south side. The activities on the north side are mostly hotel guests, which are very quiet. Next to the Gui River, the scenery is excellent, and it is very comfortable to lay a floor mat by the river to enjoy the river view.
But from the first day of check-in to the last day of check-out, the service is extremely poor. Because we cannot dine in during the epidemic, only set menus are available from morning to night. I understand that dine-in is not allowed in all of Beijing, but there is only one set menu that is not available. This is not displayed on the reservation page. I called the restaurant to ask about the set menu. The impatient reply said that there are many kinds of dishes, and each kind is served a little, and only two or three kinds of dish names were reported under my questioning. I was asked what the room number was. I was surprised that the phone number of the five-star hotel didn't show the room number. I was afraid that I didn't understand and asked something again? The opposite side said in a very angry and stern tone, your room number! ! It's no exaggeration to say this is the worst operator I've experienced in 20 years of staying in a 5 star hotel.
The next night, the family of four went to the pedicure reserved at the front desk the day before, and it was even more incredible that there was no reservation record! ! Problems that have never been encountered in various hotels or beauty salons and spas! The front office manager promised to pay cash compensation, and said that the lunch was delivered on the day of check-out to be packed and eaten on the road. The next day, the front office manager was busy with the regular VIP guests to visit the park, and even the compensation asked me to contact Ctrip myself. . Anyway, the package ordered a few days ago was cold and tasteless when it was delivered to the room, so I didn't ask any further.
In the parent-child activities in cooperation with Pumpkin Field, the staff encouraged to bring the materials back to the room to do it by themselves, and no one brought children to do it.
There are no screen windows in the Songyue Suite. Originally, I came to Yanqing, the summer capital, to enjoy the shade. As a result, I couldn't open the window at all. There were many flies and mosquitoes in the small courtyard.
In short, a very good hotel, destroyed by the management.

Going out of the hotel to visit the World Garden in early summer, there is everything you need to do Birds and flowers fragrant, people are impermanent, let's take care of it...

msg:On the day of the Lantern Festival, we stayed at the Pushen Hotel and booked two Songyue Room Suites. The single-family house is super quiet and private, giving the family a sense of security. The height of the door is very safe and it can feel very luxurious with a low-key Chinese style. There are foyer, living room, desk, dressing room, etc. There are automatic toilets and irons, which are quite complete. The comb is my favorite massage comb, and it is very special after staying in so many hotels. The foot massage was delivered, and the check-in time was scheduled. Master Zhang Yuan was professional and comfortable. The trea**ent of my cervical vertebrae for many years has added more goodwill to this visit. Because the dinner delivered is for two rooms, we ordered a set of AB packages each, including cold dishes, hot dishes, main dishes and fruits. In the evening, I made a battery car to see the lanterns. The battery car is always on call. If the customer is not found, it will reply to the phone in time, giving the customer a sense of security and responsibility! It is highly recommended to stay again next time. Every scene and every scene can be shot!

Arrived at Shinan on Monday, after a heavy snowfall in late March, the park was covered in silver, and the park without the hustle and bustle had a special feeling, especially the open tropical botanical garden, which seemed to really put us in Southeast Asia. The staff kindly upgraded the room in our package into a beautiful courtyard suite with private soup. All the facilities are automated and the design is outstanding! The B package in the package is delicious, the free 45-minute foot massage is very professional, and the breakfast is also good!

For breakfast, choose one Chinese and one Western, and you can add if you like. It is very comfortable to live in the World Garden, and this is a pleasant travel vacation. In addition, the name of this hotel is a bit unfamiliar, I checked the Xinhua dictionary specially, Pu pu (two sounds), Shen Shen (one sound).

msg:Thank you Pu Shen for a day of comfort and ease. In winter, I was tired from playing in the Expo Park and returned to my room to have a constant temperature bubble pool, which was really exhausting. Buying a package on Ctrip includes free mini bar, free fruit, free botanical garden tickets, free dinner and breakfast, free foot massage, free tax-free shopping credit👏👏👏👏. Call the front desk to arrange pick-up and drop-off from any corner of the park. All the hotels you can think of are arranged. Now the park is a little monotonous in winter, and it is good to see the lanterns at night. Staying in a hotel is more fun. I will come again, I haven't finished the book yet😜 ps: 1. Duty-free is owned by CDFG, which does not conflict with the 2.6w quota. Although there are not too many things, it is super cost-effective to catch up with the event price. 2. The botanical garden is super hot, wear less clothes when you go there👻

This day finally put into action
First of all, I would like to thank all the staff, everyone is very grateful to everyone for their hard work, the service is very good

🚗 Transportation: It is very convenient to go from the urban area, and it takes an hour and a half to navigate 🧭 Expo Gate 7. A few days before check-in, the hotel staff will entrust Ctrip to ask for the license plate number, and the temperature measurement and itinerary code will be registered at the door, which makes people feel more at ease
🧹Sanitation: Very clean, very good

🍃Environment: Complete Huizhou architecture, antique

🔔Service: nothing to say, add chicken legs to all the staff
The package we bought included breakfast 🥣 dinner tickets to the botanical gardens. Surprisingly, there was also a duty-free shop. We went for a swim on Friday. Basically, the pool was clean.
Winter Expo has a different flavor

The room on the first floor is also a veritable garden view room, and the garden view seen through the window is also very comfortable. As soon as I entered the park, I even encountered a little squirrel crossing the road. The service staff are not very friendly. But it may be due to the residual snow in winter, and the commercial street in front of the hotel is not open, which is slightly depressed. By the way, the dinner delivered is really average, typical of a high-end hotel style, with a small amount of dishes, and all the dishes are spicy, even Yangchun noodles are spicy, not very friendly to families with children. The key is to order something else, but there are not many on the menu. Hope it can be adjusted.

The package purchased includes breakfast and dinner, afternoon tea, foot massage, ice and snow carnival and duty-free shop. It is worthwhile to feel the scenery of the private garden and the considerate service at home. The hotel has an excellent location and first-class service. I especially commend the young ladies at the front desk (Xiao Wang, Xiao Zhang) and several handsome masters who drove (Master Yang, etc.) question, thank you so much. If you live here, you can visit the World Garden at any time, and the hotel will arrange battery car transfers. The hotel building is a remodeled Huizhou style building, with an antique flavor, and there are scenery everywhere. It's just that there is a bathtub when the room is opened. It's a bit strange, and I can't understand the original intention of the design. The afternoon tea is still very delicate, with various kinds of refreshments and good taste. The tea includes green tea, black tea and coffee, and the taste is good. It would be better if you can add some children's beverages, such as hot milk. The buffet breakfast and dinner has a very good environment. There are not many people eating in sections, but although there are not many varieties, there are cold and hot dishes, seafood, grilled steak, desserts, fruits, and soups. I eat vegetarian food, and I like fried rice noodles and hot and sour dishes. soup. At the end, the ice cream from Haagen-Dazs was very delicious. There are still a lot of affordable goods in the duty-free shop, 50-30% off skin care products and cosmetics, and it takes 3 minutes to walk from the hotel to the opposite direction of the hotel from the big locust tree. The pedicure is very comfortable. The ladies and sisters are in their early twenties. The techniques are good and the service is in place. However, many people need to make an appoin**ent in advance during the holidays. Ice and Snow Carnival has a lot of ice, the road is very slippery, and there are not many projects. People who like excitement should like it. The botanical garden is not big, not as good as the World Flower Grand View Garden, but it is still very characteristic to rotate upwards one after another. When encountering a place where little rabbits are fed, the scene where a group of little rabbits rush for food is very interesting.

First of all, the environment and location are really suitable for quiet relaxation. Just in the World Garden, you can visit the World Garden during the day, the Ice and Snow Carnival, and watch the light show at night. Few people and good environment. The afternoon tea and foot bath in Pushenli are good, and it is quite suitable if it is included in the package.

Breakfast and dinner were a little disappointing, considering that the location is far from off-season and there are few people, it can be considered to be full and good.

The projection on the porch in the evening is very amazing. If you have the opportunity, you must see it. It is very emotional. In addition, the off-season room was upgraded to a suite courtyard, a very happy experience. The south-facing winter sun is full of happiness when sitting in the room ~ suitable for the elderly and children ~

The big bed room is reserved, including dinner and breakfast, and tickets for 3 items of the Ice and Snow Carnival.
The staff are very friendly and polite
The hotel is in the World Garden, and it is more convenient to travel by the hotel's car.
The hotel is quaint and the public areas are beautiful
Good quality toiletries

shortcoming:
1. Can't get the design of the hotel, the big bed room pushes the door facing the bathtub. Later, due to room hygiene problems, was upgraded to a suite.
The design of the suite is even more indescribable. The bathroom, sink and bedroom are together. The bathroom is made of transparent glass without even a curtain! With children, how to take a bath! The bathroom door, the shower head is opened inward, and the carpet is pulled outward. The decoration level is not as good as that of an express hotel.
After getting up in the middle of the night and going to the bathroom, I have to go back to the bedroom to wash my hands. I can't find the sink without turning on the light. I turn on the light and wake up the sleeping family.
2. Hygiene issues: The room was originally changed because of hygiene issues. As a result, there was a thick layer of soil on the toilet in the new room.
3. Breakfast can definitely be described as shabby, and the selection of ingredients is very general.

There is a visual art in the Tropical Botanical Garden, and the most beautiful rooftop CITIC Bookstore. In the cold northern winter, the full set of activities is really rich.
There are a total of 78 hotels, so there are not many people, and the environment is not mentioned. Sitting on the entire World Park, getting up for a run in the morning, climbing the Yongning Pavilion, and looking around, although the north is bleak in winter, the distant mountains are golden in the morning light. , the white snow on the mountain is shining, and the nearby Guishui is a light band.
The hotel as a whole is in the style of Jiangnan mansion, with antique flavor and ingenious design. The application of the corridors is very natural and original. Especially at night, the light and shadow exhibition between the corridors is refreshing.
The service is very in place, proactive and enthusiastic, and polite. For the package purchased, not only the staff of Ctrip took the initiative to call to inquire about the choice of package, but the hotel staff also called many times to give help and advice.
The hotel room is retro and warm. The big window faces the big bed. It is estimated that the scenery outside the window will be beautiful in summer and autumn.
The only fly in the oin**ent that needs to be pointed out is that the room is full and there are many guests, so the facilities such as restaurants and afternoon tea houses are slightly insufficient. Although the hotel communicates with the guests in time and divides the meal, it will still bring some discomfort in experience.
A very satisfying trip. Will come again.

msg:This hotel opened in the World Garden has unique advantages, but it also has some shortcomings, and it is still a long way from a real five-star hotel.
First let me say something:
1. The location of the hotel is very good. After staying in the World Garden, it is yours. As long as you are not tired, you can visit at any time;
2. The decoration and design of the hotel is really a lot of money. The beams and pillars with a sense of age and the woodcarvings carrying a century of history are all telling the stories of the past and the present, as if they were separated from the world;
3. The attitude of the service personnel is very good, especially the middle management personnel. Because of the problem, they found the duty manager, a big boy, who was very satisfied with the solution. He also informed other problems, and promised to strengthen the management. the better;
Here are the deficiencies:
1. The place for check-in is too shabby, very crowded, and it doesn't match the style of the hotel. There are four or five people who can't turn around;
2. The breakfast experience is very bad. When I went there, I was told to wait for more than 20 minutes, but in fact, there were empty tables inside but no one cleaned them. Many meals would be out of stock for a long time, and the dining table was also uncleaned for a long time. is messy;
3. The sound of the air conditioner in the room is very loud, which affects sleep. The temperature is not adjusted high, and it is maintained at about 22 degrees. After taking a shower, it will feel cold. There are too many power sockets on the floor of the living room, and it is easy to trip;
4. Room hygiene and supporting items in the room should be more detailed;
5. The training of grassroots employees should be strengthened. For breakfast, the waiter used a tablecloth with a knife and fork as a rag to wipe the table in front of me. I was shocked and my jaw dropped. I was really speechless...

6. There are too few dishes in the restaurant, as is the buffet dinner, and the dishes in the package have been changed or served less. I haven't notified it. The experience is not good. Although it is a gift dinner, the cost of nearly 4,000 a night is not enough. It would be a waste of time to save this point, since it is written on the menu, it should be on it;

If you come to the Expo, I would recommend staying for one night, but depending on the price, the price/performance ratio is not high. Except for the larger room area, there is no other administrative trea**ent in the suite, so you can live in an ordinary room.

msg:🚗 Transportation: It takes less than an hour and a half from the East Third Ring Road to enter the car at Gate 7 and pass a large ice lake, which is very quiet

🔔Service: After parking the car underground, there will be people waiting for guidance in front of the parking space. The front desk will upgrade the private soup suite and introduce various facilities and services in detail, very patient and meticulous. The breakfast and dinner after that were all above the standard. Toby, the catering manager and the handsome guy from the spa depar**ent, were very patient and especially willing to play with our stinky boy. In the evening, there was a shuttle driver who took us into the World Garden to watch the lantern festival, and was waiting to pick us up. At this time, it was past his off-duty time. I'm really sorry.

🍃Environment: The hotel extended from the Ming Dynasty General's Mansion moved from Huizhou is quaint, with Chinese-style elegance and imposing momentum everywhere, and the ancient style of the south is vividly brought out.

🧹Hygiene: It's still good, better than most five-star hotels, and a little problem was solved with timely service.

The hotel is in the World Garden. There are ice and snow carnivals and botanical museums that are worth taking children to play. The lantern festival at night is very large and beautiful. If the grass grows and the warbler flies after May, it will be perfect.

The overall feeling is that the service is super good, the hardware is very new and very good, the environment is quiet, and will come again.

The privacy of the rooms is great, and the home-like service makes people feel warm in the cold winter.
We also specially arranged a private room for breakfast, which was very clean.
The hot spring pool in the suite is large, has great performance, and the water temperature is great~
The package includes catering, spa, skiing and hot springs, and you can feel the sincere reception in every item.
See you again in spring~

msg:The biggest problem of the hotel is that the hygiene is not up to standard. Urine stains on the back of the toilet seat, hair on the sheets, dead leaves behind the sofa cushions, used up paper towels in the drawers, and the room smells like smoke. These should be the problems of lack of training and management, and it is difficult to make big changes without changing the hotel management team. With this level of service and reception, I won't go there again.

msg:I chose this hotel with my mother for a trip during Qingming Festival, but the old man was so angry...
I won't complain about how desolate the Expo Park is, after all, the surrounding environment is not the hotel's fault.
Let me tell you what happened that day. We played in the Great Wall all day and arrived at the hotel at about seven o’clock in the evening. At night, there were few people and the surrounding environment was very dark, so we planned to stay in the hotel and not go out. After eating in the restaurant, we went back to the room to take a shower. At this time, the old man was a little tired and wanted to take a shower and then take a bath before going to bed. I brushed the bathtub again while the old man was taking a shower. At this time, I found that the water would not work. The mother also said that the water would not work, and the water on both sides was full of water. The water in the shower room overflowed to the outside, so I couldn't take a shower, so I called the front desk to check the water. After waiting for a long time, an aunt came. The aunt said that the repair could not be done and I had to go to the repair master. I was very angry and said why the room was not prepared for the guests before check-in. Isn’t the shower the basic facility of a hotel? I asked to change the room, aunt Said to fix it first and have a look, I agree.
So after waiting for a long time, a maintenance master came and said that the slate cover on the shower floor was too tight, so let's lift the slate to expose the drain below to take a bath, me? ? ? In this way, the floor is lifted up to expose the concrete floor and the drain below. It looks very ugly and the old man is easy to trip over if there is a whole piece of the floor to take a bath! ! Then the master said that he would put something under the slate so that the slate could be lifted by a seam, and the water would leak, but the floor was still raised and there was still a danger of tripping. He then repaired the bathtub, and the master said that we couldn't fix it and we had to get tools, so he asked us to wait. When we came back at about 10 o'clock, he brought a leather stick for the toilet.
At this time, I was already very angry, because the bathtub is used for bathing. How dirty are you using a tool to pass the toilet? Even if it is repaired, how do we wash it? And the master came in wearing the shoes outside and stepped on it very dirty. And it was already ten o'clock in the evening. If I wanted to repair it, I didn't know how long it would take. I asked to change the room again. The front desk said that there was no room on the same floor. I had to go downstairs. I refused. , I don't want to repack my bags and run up and down. So the final result is that we still live in the original room, the bathtub is not repaired and unusable and dirty, the floor under the shower is upturned, and you should be careful not to trip when you take a shower.
It was obviously a holiday, and the hotel’s original price was not low. During the holiday, the price was higher. I couldn’t go out of Beijing and wanted to take my mother to stay in a hotel in the suburbs of Beijing for a holiday. As a result, there were problems with such basic facilities and the old man finally Not having a good shower is very dissatisfying.

msg:Take the trip! I thought it was a hotel in the same series as Shanghai Puli and Beijing PuXuan, and the price should be the same! The result is actually a B&B hotel (in this way, it actually hurts B&Bs, and some B&Bs have style and sincerity). This hotel is a gimmick with a historical old house. Except for the front and rear doors and the conference hall, the building is very rough. From the name to the interior decoration, the hotel is plagiarizing the original character series, and the dirt is scum!

msg:有好有不好吧。是我住過最大的房間，因為還帶個院子，屋子也特別的大，美中不足的就是廁所的潔身器裝了，但是沒法用，然後淋浴的時候水會忽冷忽熱，別的就沒什麼問題了，床也比較舒服，環境也很好，還有個私人小温泉。有一些古風的體驗活動，如果送的話可以參加一下，不送的話自己看價目表看買不買。送了一頓晚飯，是小火鍋，還挺好吃的，量也還可以，兩個人吃沒問題。早餐稍微單調了一點，因為這個月凈出去住酒店了，所以有所比較，但是肯定也是沒什麼問題啊，晚上出去看了看燈正好那那幾天有世園會的燈燈會，然後覺得還不錯挺好玩的。去游泳的時候游到一半，然後他們那兒的教練就往泳池裡放了好多的划艇，把所有的泳道都佔了，這個事先我並不知道,前台也沒有説明，所以我們衹能就離開了，如果能事先通知就好了。我覺得畢竟泳池是給所有人用的嘛，他們去教學生也不應該把所有的泳道都佔了。而且泳池開的時間很短總之泳池這一項比較減分。其他的還行吧。

酒店古色古香，是徽派建築風格，挑高很高，房間大，所以住起來很舒適，又因為是淡季，有種逃離喧囂的感覺。
服務非常到位，有求必應。

衞生：與檔次相匹配，公共區域乾淨。客房無陳舊感，全功能智能馬桶。

環境：世園內部風景多樣，有山有水。酒店古風做得到位，員工服飾匹配園林風格，給小朋友的項目也與古風文化結合，客房設計也考慮了古風格調。

服務：服務特別值得一提，由於酒店位置特殊，購物不是很便利，有所需求夏經理均能幫忙及時解決。不管是在房型問題，還是在用品需求，都遠遠超出預期。

多説兩句：酒店員工講話斯文矜氣，見面問好，掩門捲簾，殷勤備至;店內商家也不急功近利，慢條斯理，多是跟店裡風格相關的項目，少了違和。整體體驗連貫完整，完全補充了園區管理的一些不便，值得稱讚。

不足之處也是很突出的：泳池8點就關了，清明節天黑的早，園區也沒有什麼可逛的，想游泳一早就關了。一定一定要吐槽晚上的自助晚餐，品質跟酒店的整體品質嚴重不符啊，跟平時住亞朵的餐飲一個水準，真是特別極其失望。自助餐沒有茶水，要茶是收費的，跟餐廳服務人員説的時候，都是背對着服務的，雖然最後給了壺茶，但這服務實在讓人很不舒服，一看就是沒有接受過培訓，實在與酒店品質不附啊！

酒店是2019年建的，但是真的感覺不到有多新，邊邊角角甚至都有些陳舊了。喜歡這個裝修風格的會非常喜歡，不喜歡這種風格的，可能要適應一下。
方方面面服務人員都笑臉盈盈，但是酒店整體的服務和管理，和一線豪華酒店肯定還是有差距的，但整體還算可以的，如果來延慶是個不錯的選擇。

服務：大爺在門口熱情幫我們拉行李，客房阿姨也是親切跟我們打招呼。就是前台員工的素質要提高。我們一進來，就沒其他客人，一副很忙的樣子，難道要回復網上的客人？我們人都來了，就不能好好幫我們辦入住？驗證身份證驗了好幾次，簽一大堆防詐騙知情書，搞一大堆有的沒的。問一下長城遊玩的事情，十問九不知，感覺除了坐着在那看電腦，就跟酒店沒關係一樣。既不介紹酒店設施，也不介紹服務。感覺一小時就換一批前台工作人員，隔天又不一樣了，就是服務態度都是如出一轍的冷漠。前台是一家酒店的第一門面，一副冷冰冰的嘴臉，搞得我們要來乞求着住一樣，很是膈應。還好其他餐廳、門僮、客房的叔叔阿姨們態度都挺好的，比前台熱心多了，看的出來他們更熱愛自己的工作。
如果到長城遊玩，這裡是一個挺好的過站。但是前台確實都對長城、北京世園等景點一概不知，最好攻略再來

酒店春節期間的活動相當豐富，娃娃們玩的樂不思蜀，酒店房間還有入住環境與圖片預期一致，就餐環境和伙食也是相當完美。

msg:優點：指示路標清晰、大堂的服務人員見到客人主動問好，幫忙拿箱子，保潔的小夥子服務意識很強。我們去的時候房間沒有收拾好，前台主動告知我們都有什麼遊樂項目，主動加微信發餐廳菜單和酒店訊息。還給我們準備了連通房（但衞生間反味嚴重）。下午4點有酒店的講解，解説員小姐姐也介紹的很清晰。回來後向前台要孩子的洗漱用品，來送東西的小姐姐還給多拿了水，非常感謝。這都是加分項。
缺點：餐廳絕對是酒店的一大敗筆。因為公園裡吃飯的地方不多，閉園後也衹有酒店的餐廳可以吃飯。價格並不便宜，但量還可以。打邊爐衹有花椒雞和麻辣牛腩鍋底，這對帶孩子不能吃花膠和辣的人不友好。所以衹能單點，我們是7點多去的餐廳，但菜單上的菜很多都估清了，孩子要楊枝甘露也沒有，但是給我們點菜的大姐很實在人特別好。上菜速度慢（也許不是預製菜😜😜）吃之前給一人倒了杯水，然後就沒人管客人的水是不是喝完了，也不給續水。上來湯也不給湯勺，上來炒飯也不給飯碗，向服務員要湯勺，他順手從後面打邊爐的小料台上拿起一個塑料勺就遞給我老公了。再説早飯，週末入住率多少，餐廳不應當向客房部瞭解清楚嘛？9點來鍾，煎餅麪糊沒了要現做，讓客人先拿別的。要是有別的能拿的，還會有那麼多人排隊等煎餅嘛？？早餐種類非常少，大部分是涼的，不到9點粥，奶，這類就沒熱乎氣兒了。大冬天帶長者孩子的居多，讓他們怎麼吃？麪類的調料也沒有標註是什麼，難道讓客人拿起來聞嘛？餐廳的地方不小，服務員也挺多，但是對食物的關注度不夠。咖啡機是膠囊的，也沒人管，我看有個男的搗鼓了半天也不知道弄出來沒。
建議：餐廳的服務人員多關注食物的質量，豐富食品種類，服務意識要加強。
房間衞生間反味嚴重，關門都掩蓋不住。（這點不是我一人説了，但一直沒有改善）
這個價格的酒店最好能有個歡迎水果哪怕是放兩個蘋果呢。
另：園區的花燈非常非常湊合，而且也少。
友情提醒：早餐：7-10   晚餐：6-9   停車有地庫。

一頓晚餐，單人足療/下午茶，旅拍，花燈
非常適合帶着長者或者孩子出來玩。
酒店的服務特別在線，禮賓會到電梯口來接。
旅拍是本次旅行的一大亮點，旅拍文華小哥哥的技術在線，選片過程也很順利，沒有任何推銷，非常耐心。家有長者過門坎的時候主動幫忙抬輪椅。
離店的時候長者不太舒服，還主動幫忙延時一小時退房，是一家可以二刷的酒店。

設施：畢竟是19年為世園會新建的酒店，各方面設施還都是比較新的，運行維護的也比較好。
衞生：整體還是很好的，給了5分，不過也還是有點小問題，在清洗浴缸的時候還是明顯有之前客人的頭髮在下水口。不過可能確實不好打掃吧。
環境：世園公園裡麪現在實話實説很多地方有點破敗了，給我感覺，酒店已經成為公園裡比較拿得出手的景點了哈～徽派建築還是很漂亮的。
服務：整體服務很好，很友善，匹配豪華酒店的定位。可能是假期住店的人較多，晚上送水時間略長，能夠理解。
酒店安排了一些活動，總的來説還可以吧，單純酒店來説值得再來，但是世園公園可玩性略差，有點影響再次來住的想法哈～

酒店宣傳的一價套餐含入住首日mini吧，花燈門票，免税購物，入住後發現所謂的mini吧就是雪碧可樂啤酒各一聽，這還要算套餐？！花燈就在園區裏不需要票，免税商品也是進來就可以買，這不是欺詐嗎？！
入住當晚孩子有些發燒，致電酒店前台要温度計，直接告知沒有，回答很乾脆，酒店的急救包衹有棉簽，我很納悶對外營業場所沒有醫用急救包可以對外營業嗎？！符合要求嗎？！疫情的時候酒店不用測體温嗎？！哪怕酒店提供附近醫院或者葯店的訊息，都沒有有的就是冷漠！！凌晨一點多驅車八十多公里，從延慶開回市區，帶着孩子途經盤山路開的心驚膽戰，這是酒店嗎？！衹收錢不服務，第二天在退按金的時候酒店莫名扣了我298元，我致電酒店前台把前一天的遭遇也反應了一下，後續酒店經理在聯繫我後，首先先找了一個可笑的理由，酒店是有温度計的恰好被其他客人借走了🤪這麼大的酒店地處偏遠的郊區，就一個温度計？！説了很多有的沒得，就是沒有誠意，還承諾給我房費打八折，當事人聯繫不上不清楚當時情況，承諾後續提升服務，説得都是些什麼啊，真誠的歉意完全沒有！

酒店直通園藝小鎮，步行10分鐘到達中國館。白天在公園徜徉，夜間可以觀花燈，適合與家人悠閑遊樂。

從酒店南門出去幾分鐘便可以看到花燈，酒店整點也有擺渡車，可以到一號門，植物館或者去租電瓶車。
美中不足還有很多硬件設施不好，排風扇不排風，空調風大噪音大，不能調節風速。

酒店服務很好，小孩晚上餓了，點了外賣進不來世園，酒店服務人員幫忙開車去取並送到房間，非常感謝。

msg:首先感謝前台小可和管家小莫的熱心服務 酒店的總體服務是加分項

環境優美 夏天風景應該更好看 此次出行偶遇一場大雪 給酒店添色不少

再説下不足 入住以後想在房間喝一杯咖啡 結果發現咖啡杯有明顯咖啡污漬 這與酒店的價位定位似乎不匹配

硬件需要升級 馬桶水箱總是漏水 顯得過於老舊 影響入住體驗 希望改進的是增加智能馬桶蓋 冰涼涼的不太舒服

房間隔音不佳 好在屋裡有個額外的推拉門 睡覺時可以關上

住在公園裡 時間寬裕 悠閑 遛娃總體不錯

要説不滿意的地方，就是服務。我覺得前台好像對業務不是特別熟，我們checkin都等了很久，對世園內也不怎麼了解，提供不了啥訊息。而且雪天路滑，一會兒説擺渡車開一會兒又不開，我們來回跑了好幾趟。雖然最後還是讓我們坐了，但是帶着長者小孩確實有點折騰…

沒有給差評，因為前台的小月。還有禮賓服務，電瓶車服務等等，不過一個五星酒店，需要靠工作人員賠笑臉，真心不值。
游泳池。健身房上午十一點開。捨不得電嗎？
早餐。又臟又難吃。
大堂很小。
所謂的在世園裡麪。其實離花燈，景色都很遠。雖然有電瓶車。也就幾趟。沒必要住這個園子裏。

msg:1.所有的地方都特別冷，走廊，餐廳，大堂，特別是當你推開房門而沒有穿外套，刺骨的冷空氣直灌入房。房間有空調和地暖，但地暖打不開。
2.因為買的套餐含有打邊爐晚餐，提前一天預約，告知説餐廳的打邊爐約滿了，結果到了酒店前台告知晚餐升級成自助餐，但也會附帶一個打邊爐鍋，結果到了餐廳都吃完飯了，打邊爐也沒上，關鍵是我是第三桌到餐廳的客人，結果服務人員在上鍋子的時候居然隨機上，誰喊她給誰上，導致我來了一個小時都沒給上鍋子？説鍋子沒了？這時候還有至少2/3的桌子沒上鍋，太離譜了…
3.由於是跨年夜，入住客人較多，餐廳居然出現了沒有位置需要排隊的情況，酒店沒有預案。
4.酒店的房間衞生較差，多個角落和地毯各處都有顯眼的臟污和灰塵，水龍頭有污漬，洗手間角落感覺有很久沒有擦過，屋內傢俱大多都有破損但無補漆維護，床尾前地板有另2個凸起的插座板，高出地面不少，我被絆倒兩次，屋內設施和裝修離星級酒店的標準差距很大。
5.浴缸很大，但沒有把手，很容易在浴缸內滑倒或跌傷。
6.房間內應急照明手電沒有電或者是壞的。
7.酒店地下停車場入口沒有路燈和地燈，晚上看不清指示牌和地面。
8.床頭兩孔插座和usb接口都是壞的…
9.spa預約滿了，換成下午茶，結果是一堆乾果和成品點心餅乾…給的餐具是一次性筷子？？這是5星級酒店誰敢信？從來沒見過這麼離譜的…
10.總之一句話，這個酒店的綜合情況與其價格極不匹配，房間是招待所標準，服務配套處處體現國營企業的傲慢，肯定不會推薦別人入住了，太坑

酒店以江南“五鳳樓”為核心，建築和內飾都充斥着古老的東方元素，更是將自然的光影結合，營造出不一樣的體驗。酒店在世園公園裡麪，成為唯一可以開車進入世園公園的方式，整個公園成為酒店配套，為小小孩的度假增添樂趣。歲數大了出行早就就是走一走逛一逛，住的好風景好就足夠啦[自拍R]
	
🥢酒店餐廳一般般，房間裏麪包含的套餐有點像預製菜，早餐品種還可以中西餐都有，但是如果用五星標準評價，味道有點一般般

⚔酒店附近沒有什麼娛樂活動，如果喜歡温泉可以選擇旁邊的温泉酒店，我們帶小小孩，酒店就在世園公園裡，有美美的風景讓小孩兒跑跑就夠啦

第二天還聽了酒店的講解，是一座徽派的將軍府基礎上改建的，房子的原材料都是直接從當地運過來複原

酒店有免費的擺渡車，可以到達園區裏的各個重要景點
自己步行出來溜達也可以，人真的很少，有一種包公園的感覺

環境：前廳和大堂並沒有想象中的恢宏大氣，但位於世園公園裡，不用額外買票，出行公園還是很方便的
世園公園：室內衹有中國館和植物館可以進入，很多地方都拉了隔離帶，無法進入，有點掃興；但公園室外景色不錯，在1號門可以自己租一個小電瓶，開車逛遍公園，還是很爽的

剩下的我不得不吐槽：1.上千的房間，前廳燈是壞的，我們晚上回去才發現，一片漆黑2.小院子裏面的桌子椅子全是土，我想請問這不算是我們房間嗎？為什麼不打掃？3.送來的嬰兒床，沒人鋪，床扔下就走了，裏面就塑料墊子加一條浴巾（如圖所示）4.前台小之又小，亂哄哄，聚集在一起辦理入住和退房5.去spa，我被關電梯裏了
6.最想吐槽的！！“全日餐廳”“全日”並不是全日！！辦理入住沒人有人和我説中午沒有點餐，衹有自助和用餐時間，帶孩子轉了轉回來13點40，去全日餐廳被告知，沒有單點，自助閉餐了！如果吃反正就按自助餐費用收取，可以進去看看還剩下什麼，反正2點閉餐！反饋給前台，前台推薦送我們去美食街吃飯……那可真的是呵呵了……紀念日帶着孩子，偌大酒店沒飯吃，去沒人的快捷餐廳吃的不太好的快餐（園區裏沒的選擇）。問加錢煮碗麪都不可以。
晚餐：套餐形式，依舊沒得選，甜點説衹有巧克力蛋糕，我説幫忙問問孩子3歲吃不了巧克力，能不能換個蛋糕，向領班、服務員、經理，分別説了6次以上，均回覆去問問……等了40分鐘（孩子非要等着）。我也説了花錢也可以。這酒店就是，花錢也沒有！但是我看到包間各種不是套餐的菜！這酒店真的是奇葩中的神界！就這一肚子氣，還來問辦會員麼……無了大語！！

值得一提的是，前台的Helen服務很到位、對於客人的要求也是積極迴應，還很貼心的給我們升級了房型，獨立的小院，入住感覺非常棒，夜晚也很安靜！

還有保潔阿姨趙小亮，房間打掃很乾凈，服務很周到！

酒店早午晚餐都是自助，因為房間不多，所以客人也不是太多，就餐環境很好，菜品也可以，如果再多一些品種就更好了！

整體感覺非常棒，非常適合親子游，白天、晚上拍照也很美！

還會再次入住！

交通：很便捷，很好找到，停車方便。

衞生：整體衞生很好，很乾凈。

環境：比較安靜，有很多的古建築，可以到處閑逛。

服務：很好，很到位且細心。

msg:夏季避暑出遊，選擇了世園璞燊，非常滿意這次三天兩夜的親子之旅。

交通：從城區出發90分鐘左右即可到達酒店，由於璞燊在世園園區內，入住前3天攜程來詢問自駕遊車號，在門口報車號入園。

服務：我們12點前到達酒店，暑期酒店處於滿房狀態，前台告知我們可以在3點入住。但沒想到2點多我們詢問房間打掃進度時，發現房間還未打掃（3點時無法入住）。前台的高慧和月月非常耐心體貼，考慮到我們帶的孩子年齡較小，當即決定將我們訂的其中一間房升級為套房，讓孩子能夠儘快休息，在此對她們的照顧表示感謝。此後的3天，我們始終感受到璞燊酒店員工的專業性和服務精神，目前璞燊已經是我們心中的京郊度假首選。

環境：青山碧水鮮花環繞，世園園區內有很多營地的活動，但需要自行了解，也可以關注世園公號。酒店是徽派建築，沒能深入瞭解這個建築的修建過程，但可以感覺到設計師的用心，整個建築羣與自然和諧而處，幾天住下來感到身心愉悦，流連忘返。

美中不足：僅有一個餐廳，且就餐選擇不是很豐富，中午衹有自助餐。

  整個酒店的風格是徽式江南風格，都是一層的房間，風景非常的好。有私家園林的感覺。和世園公園是相通的，飯後溜達也不是不錯的選擇。拍照也非常的出片哦～
  推薦來延慶的一定要住這家酒店哦，很不錯。

msg:酒店硬件極佳，環境也不錯。世園公園現在總體比較荒蕪，但有一種清凈避世的感覺
很可惜軟件有很多令人不滿的地方，感覺實在對不起價位，比如：
1. 因為要過生日提前打電話請酒店佈置一下，結果到了他們説給忘了…於是給補了個蛋糕，個頭倒是不小可惜是植物奶油我不是很吃的慣
2. 進酒店電視屏幕上顯示歡迎“田X先生”這人是誰咱也不知道咱也不敢問，好在他沒也進房間就就是了
3. 喜歡硬一點的枕頭，打電話問前台要的時候特地問了是不是全蕎麥的，得到肯定答覆，但送來的還是半蕎麥
4. 馬桶哪怕小便也經常一次沖不下去，要按久一些才有足夠的水
5. Wifi龜速
6. 酒店有車可以在園區內接送，出門前打電話問前台要不要提前預訂，説不用出去就有車，結果兩次都是出來沒有車又打電話找前台叫… 好在師傅很好，聽説我過生日不忙的時候帶我們兜風了一圈
7. 健身房連自由啞鈴都沒有，除非你衹想用跑步機基本上是來了個寂寞
8. 最離譜的是泳池，入住前幾天問泳池開了沒有衹是説開了，然後就給掛了。入住當天又問了營業時間被告知11點-8點，實在是短的可憐…第一天吃完晚飯已經來不及了，於是第二天特地五點就早早吃了晚飯換泳衣下去，結果到了被告知泳池週一週二都！不！開！健身房工作人員還説前台沒有提醒你嗎….我特地問了兩次泳池，前台可真從來沒提過這事兒
穿着泳衣悻悻而歸，感覺自己和**一樣實在是忍無可忍！要求找經理投訴，值班的餐飲經理倒是很有誠意，來房間面談並且給了我們還算滿意的解決方案。希望以後可以多注意一些培訓和細節，從一開始就給用户良好的體驗

還要特別感謝一下餐廳的小陳經理和前台的郭經理。在璞燊酒店住了兩晚後我們要轉世園湯泉酒店，從世園公園2號門出去過馬路就到世園湯泉酒店。離店當天正趕上下雨，還不小。我們準備在餐廳吃飯後離店，就餐時餐廳小陳經理熱情周到，在服務中瞭解到我們的情況，主動幫助聯絡前台郭經理，郭經理看到我們老的小的，遇上下雨就安排禮賓部楊師傅開車直接送到世園湯泉酒店，幫助搬運行李。讓我們感受到貼心的服務。疫情給大家帶來很多不便，但酒店從前台到客房服務的員工都很熱情。一次暖心的入住體驗。

🌟之前就來過世園會，發現這家酒店，想着什麼時候一定要住一次，這家店在世園會裡麪，不需要門票直通園內。
🌸我訂的房間是普通雙床房，然而可能是因為疫情的原因，這邊人不多，前台小姐姐給我們升了房，獨棟小院！超開心！
⭐️我們一共三個人，電話問了能不能一起一間房，答案是可以的，又升了房，一個人誰在沙發上（沙發很寬，人又瘦小🤣），完全睡得開，而且相當舒適。
😂浴缸對我這種小個子不太友好，沒有扶手什麼的。。。有膠囊咖啡機這個超棒。。。浴袍很舒適。✌前台小姐姐然然和小高還給我們免了加早餐的費用，超棒。可能疫情來的人太少，一開始進屋還覺得有些灰塵，但是出去轉了一圈回來，屋子明顯打掃過，還把被子也鋪在了沙發上。
另：提個小建議，有些衞生死角（沙發下什麼的），還是要收拾一下的🤣

msg:酒店的優點和缺點都很突出，優點比較多，主要列舉如下：
公園之內，無需提前預約公園和另外買票；
環境很好，酒店周邊綠樹環繞，亭台樓榭，還有足夠大的場地踢球扔飛盤等；
服務態度好。
缺點有幾個，希望可以改進：
盥洗室的夜燈太亮，影響睡眠，不開的話又太黑；
前台水太少，去要的時候居然水沒有了
（｀Δ´）！
晚上中庭水池邊的巨型大蚊子太多了（＞﹏＜）

缺點：房間內太熱（4月下旬的延慶，酒店房間內白天温度達28度，中央空調好像壞了，怎麼也降不下來温度）；入住沒有歡迎水果；酒店馬桶使用時有故障；房間地面灰太大，地毯沒有吸塵，不太乾淨。全日餐廳菜品種類太少，菜品口味很一般，價格卻略貴，不建議；裝門卡的袋子既不方便又很醜；沒看到中庭投影電影，酒店服務人員也沒有提醒，略失望；看到評論裏都是給升級套房的，真的假的啊，反正沒給我升級，羨慕那些給升級的。

msg:2022年的第一天，帶着家裡老頭老太入住延慶世園璞燊酒店，相應國家號召，非必要不出京麼，短短的假期，京郊遊就蠻好。
入住前，攜程&酒店預訂部就對入住期間可能出現的問題做了預先溝通，包括提前報備車牌號、房間、套餐選擇及預訂，這裏非常感謝酒店預訂部楠楠的周到服務，本來元旦期間由於入住人員較多，晚餐大多都升級成了自助餐，但家裡長者不喜歡，所以還是幫我保留了原來的A／B餐，很是貼心。
元旦當天，由城區開至酒店一路暢通，很是順利，按照之前楠楠的指引導航至6號門，順利進入世園園區抵達酒店。
酒店的整體採用徽派建築的設計風格，中庭與頤和安縵、莫幹山的悦榕莊有異曲同工之處，但徽派灰頂白牆的簡潔設計，不會感到沉悶、壓抑，輕快了不少。辦理入住時就有禮賓人員及時送上了温熱的紅棗茶，暖暖的很是香甜，在我辦理入住的時候，也貼心的為長者連結好了wifi。小小的前台有5、6位辦理人員，透過口罩都能感覺到他們洋溢的熱情，同時感受到周到的服務，值得一提的是，有位留着中分的先生，簡單溝通感覺是一位高管，不過後來才知道這位就是酒店的總經理，可見為了應付客流高峯，領導“戰鬥在一線”真是做足了功課。入住辦理很順利，領了房卡、温泉券、晚餐券、滑雪票等，並對酒店做了詳盡介紹，隨後就有禮賓人員引導我們去客房。
這次我定了一間大床一間雙床，感覺上大床房空間更寬敞，客房設計中規中矩，比較值得一提的是，房間的所有按鍵設計都在離地較近的地方，我想這個設計對輪椅及小朋友應該是很友好了，房間配有中央空調和地暖，光控系統也採用可以減弱調光的旋鈕設計，比較新奇。因為是冬天，也談不上什麼窗外風景，mini吧飲料衹有可樂、雪碧和啤酒各一聽，相對少了點，其他基本就是五星酒店的標配了。
因為房間套餐附送了高桶足療和精油SPA，入住時前台已經為我們預約好了下午3點，所以簡單的吃了午餐之後，剩下的時間就衹能在酒店和周邊轉轉，出了酒店全日餐廳旁的後門，向左一轉就是世園的“永寧閣”，2019年來的時候住在世園凱悦酒店，看着永寧閣感覺距離好遠，原來就在璞燊酒店的“後花園”裏，登高望遠，感覺....風真大，天真冷，冬天的景色真蕭肅......
入住時收到房間附送的温泉票才知道，要泡湯泉還要開車去位於1號門附近的世園湯泉酒店才可以，帶着長者實在怕返回時會受涼，下午2點半才臨時決定把兩份湯泉門票改換成下午茶，酒店前台有位略帶港台腔的帥哥，馬上幫我打電話聯繫餐廳經理、協調定製，並預約了4點鐘，還解釋説，如果出現餐盒不夠的情況，會幫我們替換成鳥籠或其他器皿但一定會滿足我們的要求，非常感謝他了～
3點鐘，我們準時來到SPA，為我提供服務的是理療師張遠（carl），全程非常貼心，幫我選擇了“森林”味道的芳香精油，安靜悠遠的味道是我喜歡的，按摩手法專業、熟練，被戳中穴位的酸爽真是”令人難忘“，不過整個療程過後，確實是渾身輕鬆，小夥子性格也很開朗、健談，理療的同時，提供了很多關於養生和日常作息的建議。雖然元旦當天他們要面對100多人的壓力，但全程服務都非常規範到位，也很注意客人的私隱，沒有絲毫的不適感，此處為Carl點贊。
SPA結束，正好也差不多是下午茶的時間，前台的小姐姐親自領我們上到閣樓，不知道滿房當天她們要這樣來回多少遍。此處插一句，璞燊酒店是按照古時將軍府一比一還原而建，下午茶的閣樓對應當時的小姐閨房，這麼一想簡單的下午茶也多了一份意趣，下午茶套餐包括堅果、水果、乾果、中式點心和小蛋糕，品種豐富，水果的成熟度很高，都是甜甜的，這點我很喜歡，飲料方面可以有咖啡、果汁和紅茶，我選了紅茶，有些酒店的下午茶會用冷泡茶，但璞燊酒店用的是大紅袍，這點真是有點兒意外，感覺下午茶的品質瞬間得到了提升。“服務生”一看就不是“專業茶藝師”，攀談兩句，果然，是餐飲部經理 陳金華，感覺酒店的團隊管理應該是很到位了，頗有“我是革命一塊磚，哪裡需要哪裡搬”的感覺，陳經理年紀輕輕，但對酒店管理有豐富的經驗，也很懂得通過溝通提高客户黏性，未來可期。下午茶結束，還不忘熱情的説，一會兒晚餐見，晚餐有需要可以隨時找他，感覺很貼心。
回房稍做休息，再出房間天色已晚，酒店的迴廊上開始播放動畫片，仿古建築裏整個迴廊都在放映上海製片廠的老動畫“哪吒鬧海”忽然有種很奇妙的錯位感覺。晚餐在“全日餐廳“，看中文還以為是日料餐廳，看了一下英文才發現是All Day Dining，符合國際五星酒店標準了。因為是兩個房間，所以A／B套餐各選了一份，每個套餐有3涼、3熱、1湯、1主食、1水果......味道評價就是標準五星酒店中餐廳中規中矩的味道，我比較喜歡的是開胃小涼菜：糖醋小排，話梅小番茄、醬汁蘿蔔、瓜條都很好吃，湯品的淮揚獅子頭是標準的傳統做法，丸子綿軟，裏面是粉紅色的入口即化的口感，南粵肚煲雞無論是豬肚還是雞肉都很軟爛，難得的是菜量，真材實料且不説，給的是真多啊，一份私房文火小牛肉，滿滿的全是牛肉，完全沒有其他食材，足有半斤多的牛肉，最眼暈的是XO醬和牛炒飯，好像是用大湯碗裝，紮紮實實的扣在盤子上，一份足有一斤多…毫無懸念的，根本吃不了，打包了～ 用餐全程陳經理都忙前忙後的招呼着，對每一桌的客人都很熱情，尤其關注帶寶寶的客人，貼心的提供寶寶椅，知道父親不喝雞湯，還特意取了冬瓜排骨湯，用餐結束又送上巧克力冰激凌，非常周到。
晚餐後，我們散步到中國館看花燈，這裏也要説明，世園現在是休整期，衹有中國館（非常小的一部分開放）、植物館（温室門票普通40，長者20）和冰雪嘉年華（適合帶孩子，我沒去）可以玩，所以如果是為了世園公園來的，完全不用有太多期待。
晚上睡的很好，酒店隔音不錯，很安靜，清晨被小鳥的叫聲喚醒，又是新的一年新的一天。
為了避免聚集，我們早早就去吃了早飯，早飯品種不算太多，但餛飩、豆腐腦、油條、煎餅、包子花捲、培根香腸麪包、咖啡牛奶果汁，就是一般五星酒店該有的樣子，品質還是不錯的，當然早早的又看見了忙碌的餐飲部陳經理，真是辛苦。
雖然2號當天入住客人很多，但酒店前台的妹妹還是很貼心的幫我把房間延至1點半鐘退房，很是感謝，也為給後邊打掃房間帶來的不便表示歉意。因為不想假期太緊張，所以沒有去滑雪，不做點評。

總結，世園璞燊很有特色的五星酒店，距離北京城區交通距離適宜，周圍配套包括湯泉、滑雪、世園公園非常便利，酒店管理團隊熱情周到，餐飲品質、質量有保證，客房很新入住很舒適。唯一不滿意的一點是，不管是雙床還是大床房浴缸都沒有把手，如果長者使用就要留心。其他都好。以上是我的入住體驗和客觀點評。我想，春暖花開的時節，有機會我還會再去的～

環境：極好，在世園裡麪，開車可以直接進去，停到酒店地下停車場，上電梯就是大堂，地上不好停，車比較多。酒店整體風景很好，出了門就是古色古香的感覺，感覺走到哪都是風景。
設施：因為不是親子酒店，所以沒有小童樂園，但是定的房間裏面是有泳池的，我定的松月間，還給升級到泳池房，孩子這高興壞了，泳池是24小時恆温循環水，很乾凈，就是冬天陽光房沒有暖氣有點冷。房間裏面啥都有，連香薰台都有，洗漱用品是帕爾馬地中海，太喜歡了，這個太奢侈了，完美啊！
服務：總體來説很好，就是感覺酒店太大，要點啥東西比較費勁，送回來很慢，而且沒有救急醫葯包，我家娃在房間摔了一覺，正好摔門口的櫃子上，腦袋破了，想要點葯處理一下，前台沒有找到，過了將近一小時才回復…讓我去醫院吧，那時候我家娃已經好了都…總體來説就是前台服務比較慢，態度好，速度慢。
衞生：沒有任何異味，床品我也檢查是新的，地板是有灰塵，一層風沙大是比較正常。衞生死角打掃的都很細緻，我是挺滿意的。
餐飲：我買的是包含晚餐，晚餐是自助，味道不錯，就是沒有寶寶餐椅，説衹有兩個，那麼大的酒店寶寶餐椅那麼少，實在是不舒服，我家娃就跪在凳子上吃了頓飯，跪一小時，感覺大人都受不了，因為他三歲太小了，坐椅子基本就冒個頭，吃不到飯。
免税店就不用去了，啥都沒有，價格比較貴，別的沒啥了，夏天還是很好的，打算再去

設施：酒店是徽派建築風格，總共不到80間房，別緻的園林景觀。房間設定很好，一進門是浴缸，直接和卧室隔開，衞生間乾濕分離，而且是兩個洗手盆，房間空間很舒適。
服務：酒店的服務必須着重點評，從前台到餐廳，所到之處所見之人，都給人賓至如歸的感覺。尤其是前台Helen，在大年初一的日子口，幫忙協調延遲退房至2點，讓我們既有時間1帶孩子去滑雪，又可以讓行動不便的長者在房間踏踏實實的休息。
以後等春夏季還會再來入住

小建議：一樓個別房間的下水道確實有反味（我們訂了兩間房，另一間沒有發現這個問題），希望可以放一些香薰。

我是安徽人，找到這家徽派建築，非常有家鄉的風格。如果大家喜歡黃山那邊的徽派建築，一定不要錯過這家酒店。

交通上，離北京開車1.5小時。距離萬科滑雪場30分鐘車程。我們是過來滑雪的，所以住在這家酒店。

酒店在一個大公園裡麪，非常美，還有湖。冬天凍成冰河，可以溜冰。

最後説一下酒店的服務，真是全北京最好！強烈推薦

這次預訂的是兩個小院的房間，帶父母和孩子來休息休息逛逛公園。小院有前後院，帶循環流動水的泡池，夠同時一家三口泡沒啥問題（自帶泡泡浴球的慎用，兩分鐘就把泡泡全循環沒了）
早晚餐都在酒店的餐廳用餐，早餐自助，菜品豐富。晚餐套餐內含的菜品也是不錯的，服務也很好。節假日用餐高峯期提前點菜能獲得更好的體驗。
總體來説是一次不錯的體驗，春夏季來可能會收穫公園更好的景色，不過相對的就沒有這樣人少清凈的享受了。

房間是地暖，很暖和，房間裏需要添加冰塊礦泉水毛巾等很及時。
餐廳食材也很贊，三文魚咖喱蝦排骨都不錯！
前台高女士及茶室的陳經理人超級超級nice，服務熱情周到！點贊！

🔔服務：服務真是沒得説，停車、入住都十分方便。主要是員工體貼周到，會主動詢問選擇哪些服務，讓入住體驗更好了。聖誕節在奧萊買買買，買過頭，以為要錯過用餐時間，和酒店告知情況後還及時備餐，等我們達到後涼菜已上，熱菜再入鍋，體貼在細微處。
在北京入駐酒店第一次感受到員工想客户所想的細緻入微。前台Helen和足浴的Carl真是令人印象深刻。
我們很願意也非常推薦周圍朋友來。
雖然聖誕節當天的行程安排因為時間規劃有許多未完成，但是入駐酒店給了我們很多驚喜，填滿了那天的快樂～

酒店本身規模不小，裝修和設施還算考究。但房間內部佈局不大合理，洗手池設在兩側過廊，房間相對比較擁擠，衞生間會反味兒。淋浴還不錯，床比較軟。可能疫情期間為節省成本，早餐改成套餐，這個倒不成問題，衹是套餐的品質和製作太過潦草，愧對5星級的定位，大概3星也夠不上。
服務非常好，意識非常不錯。

msg:國慶假期因疫情不能出京就在周邊定個酒店。因為是世園裡唯一的一家酒店，在園子裏玩也方便。關鍵還是門簾與近期追劇裏的建築相似，所以馬上就預訂了。前台提前電話聯繫要了車牌並選定了用餐時間段分流用餐很好。去了發現果然沒有失望。建築環境太美了，進房後也有水果，飲料免費享用。拖朋友的福，原定的雙床房升為套房，是獨立小院，晚上有地暖，加熱坐便器，唯一不方便的是浴室對着床且沒有任何遮擋，是透明玻璃[偷笑][偷笑]夜景也太美了，強烈推薦在酒店裡逛一圈真是讓人流連忘返！送的世園樂高和熱帶雨林的門票。推薦大家租門口的自行車去逛世園。

msg:非常好的酒店，首先地理位置非常好，就在世園公園內，緊換着媯河，周圍的環境就是一個大花園，酒店的建築風格是仿上海的五鳳樓而建，仔細看了一下，公共區域的很多建築材料確實是老建築物用過的木料和雕刻，很有特色，酒店的服務也很好，每一個服務員見面時都會主動和你打招呼，由於是疫情的原因，不許堂食，所以所有的餐食都是到餐廳自取或送到房間的，第二天出去玩回來的晚了點，有點兒累，本想打電話讓送餐，沒想到一進房間，餐己經送到房間擺好了，真有點驚喜！由於世園公園很大，所以酒店還有電瓶車接送住店客人到園區內的各個景點，很方便。唯一的小遺憾就是房間裏不知為什麼沒有行李架。

🚗 交通：我是跟着導航走跟輕鬆就找到啦（酒店有地庫，免費噠）
🧹衞生：酒店環境非常乾淨，房間內部也是
🍃環境：大家可以參考一下我拍的照片啦
🔔服務：服務那真是沒得挑。前台小姐姐好温柔的，當天的值班經理是個帥哥，態度也是超級好，帶我們逛了逛酒店，講解了酒店的建築風格還有來歷，總體感覺還是非常不錯的，值得一來👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

msg:坐落在世園裡的徽派建築酒店，古色古香，很有風格。進門的院裏一汪淺水倒映出院落的影子，晚上回廊的牆壁上投影的是上海美術電影製片廠版本《哪吒鬧海》勾起童年的回憶。因為假期原因，入住時間不能保證，我們等了兩個多小時才收到取房卡通知。前台服務美女很熱情，能給不太滿意的入住效率提點分。套房是私密小院，曲徑通幽，路邊綠化很漂亮。房間客廳卧室面積擺放的有些侷促，水吧的櫃子打開門有點擋路。有些設施還是欠缺維修，枱燈不能抬頭，壁爐的燈帶不能連續。浴缸很大，帕爾瑪洗浴用品，智能馬桶。床架不太穩，晚上睡覺翻身撞牆。隔音不太好，隔壁房間開户門聽的很清楚。泳池不大，但是人少。中午去就是包場。自駕車進園區報備車號，不收入園費和停車費。車輛不可在園區裏自駕。最不滿意的餐飲，晚餐每人三百多的自助餐，沒什麼可吃的。早餐更簡單，豆漿都沒味兒。這個管理水平跟房費不太相符。

🧹衞生：還可以，但是感覺保潔阿姨都一個一個哭喪着臉

🍃環境：沒得説，在世園裡，非常好

🔔服務：太值得吐槽了，自助餐吃到最後啥也沒有，也不補充，然後早餐很早就結束了，自助的種類也非常有限。更誇張的是泳池，吹風機沒有，工作人給的理由是，因為客房不夠用，所以抱歉。……啥？？？？所以我4歲的孩子衹能頂着濕漉漉的頭髮回房間。而且泳池淋雨完全堵着不下水，也找不到工作人員…………

這個服務簡直了，別説五星了，三星都給多了

然後送的月餅也很搞笑，我問前台套餐包含的月餅在哪，前台説，走的時候會給您的。啥？？？？所以我9月21日入住過中秋節，你告訴我節過完了再給我月餅？？？？當然最後還是送到房間了，但是，這個工作人員的培訓也太不到位了……

還有套餐裏的歡迎水果， 我就沒有看到，我也沒提，然後就這樣到我離店，也沒有看到哈哈哈

總之這個價格，衹對得起環境，沒有服務可言

園區裏沒啥吃的，午餐晚餐早餐都在酒店餐廳解決的，感覺餐廳做的淮揚菜蠻好，川菜湊合，早餐還是有正常五星級豪華酒店的水準的。蕙風院裏的泡池挺好用的，操作簡單，有温泉的舒適感

晚餐大概是298元一位，餐品種類就那幾種，味道一般，不是很值 
獨自出遊非自駕，衹想安靜玩兒幾天，周圍環境也不錯，適合來這裏呼吸新鮮空氣，完全衝著酒店建築和環境來的，自備口糧零食吧

問題是餐廳晚餐品類有點少，還經常沒有這個沒有那個，早餐自助很滿意。
房間的浴室設計槽點很足，和床挨着但沒有跟床隔開的簾子，研究不透這個設計，一個洗一個看……？迷之尷尬總之就是。淋浴水流也是忽大忽小。
卧室浴室這邊的空調和地暖比之客廳的不太有勁，晚上睡有點冷。
總體感覺其實不太像五星級，四星差不多，貴可能貴在位置上了吧。

服務：前台基本有求必應，態度好的真是好，態度不好的也是挺不好，兩極分化挺明顯。酒店運營時間估計不長的原因，很多服務跟不太上，不完善，辦理入住的地方也是有點憋屈。
餐廳：感受到最大的不滿意就是餐廳吧，服務人員死板，談不上有什麼服務，送的下午茶裏面的堅果真的是很陳了好嗎，可以不送。房間帶的套餐菜量可以再少點嗎，三片彩椒一個大盤子，如果覺得成本給不了就別勉強了，套餐A裏面很多辣的，看見帶着小朋友是不是可以提醒下，要不要免辣，倒是也遇到一個瘦高的帶眼鏡的小哥，有點服務的樣子吧。菜單本來就沒幾個菜，好多菜還都沒有，當然不是為吃去的，但是沒有飯吃也會餓，早餐有適合孩子喝的大米粥和小米粥。
冰雪嘉年華和花燈節可以帶孩子來看，挺好玩挺好看，除去這兩個不建議帶太小的寶寶來。

單人高桶足療體驗45分鐘：家人説很舒服。那就是贊套餐啦。

早餐：架勢都擺齊了，希望少用速成品，廚師自己做會更好。包括晚餐的味道也可以繼續加強，更精緻一些更好。

五星好評，感謝帶給我們好的體驗的服務人員們。

房間內一進去就看到地毯上有個黑色一字夾…不知道是前面哪一任客人留的了，從入住房間走廊旁邊就放着一個吸塵器，一直到走也沒有變過地兒
晚餐本來是套餐形式，但入住當天酒店説改為了自助餐形式，不過可以看一下菜品，不喜歡的話也可以再按照套餐做（建議還是吃套餐，我們很餓選擇了自助餐，除了涼菜，熱菜基本是剛剛温乎的，稍稍放一下就涼了，雖然有個經理很負責的幫我們加熱又去拿後廚温着的菜，但！依然沒有改變…………體驗很差 好像在吃殘羹剩飯一樣…）
游泳池不大，外面恆温可以泡身子的地方也沒開，minibar衹有一聽可樂一聽雪碧和癟了的一個青島啤酒。
以上，希望酒店可以改善。

msg:酒店在世園裡麪，徽式建築很漂亮，逛世園也很方便，儘管很多地方已經破敗。帶着小朋友被升級到帶院子的套房，活動空間大為增加，小朋友很開心，連同不停地打蒼蠅也變成了一件很開心的事情。不過套房的衞生間格局其實不太適合親子，更適合情侶。疫情期間游泳池等設施都未開放，好在世園活動空間很大，國際館裏還有一個樂高積木王國，也就不再計較其他的設施了。買的是含三餐的套餐，趕着人多，早晚是自助，基本是會議餐標準，中午是三明治，正好可以帶着給孩子在場館裏吃。能夠吃飽喝足玩開心還有什麼不知足的呢？

酒店的硬件無可挑剔，古風獨院和現代化的設施配合的相得益彰，令人印象深刻！
服務體貼入微，前台一位姓郭的小夥子和電瓶車司機師傅都令人非常感動！
餐飲服務也很nice，唯一就是缺少了一些本地的特色美食，例如小火勺…
令人難忘的一次延慶之旅，好評！

msg:疫情肆虐，無法出京，選擇這裏絕對是意外之喜。酒店在世園會隆慶街的北段，徽派建築，復刻了南方的宅院，哪怕來大廳看看，都是收穫。酒店在永寧閣邊上，出門上山，可以
一覽世園會的全景，彷彿世園會就是一套巨大無比的私家園林，尤其適合愛走路跑步的朋友來。酒店套房設備設施更是一流，從房間的佈局、傢俱、到衞浴品牌和衞浴用品，都是一流。特別是温泉設備，全自動很舒適，強烈建議。酒店的服務也很好，幫着客人解決問題。關於大家關心的世園會的情況是，這裏還在運行，中國館和世界館在開放，但是衹是很小的一部分。其餘場館都關門了，孤零零的在那裡似乎訴説曾經的輝煌。園區花木管理的很好，保持了2019年的水平。如果你奔着奇花異草、園林造型來，會很開心；如果跟着熱鬧繁華來，可能會有些失望。另外，酒店的餐飲比較簡單，畢竟人流不多，撐不起高端水平。

msg:酒店環境很好，儘管入住客人比較多，但是因為世園本身很大，所以沒有任何不適感，很清凈。硬件方面還是很不錯的，整體感覺比較新，衞生情況良好，但是服務細節還有很大提升空間。例如我們房間對面有回收的臟餐盤，整整擺了一夜，沒有人收拾，感覺很不好。早飯餐廳裏有蒼蠅，飛來飛去，沙拉類就別吃了，心裏很膈應。購買的套餐裏面有百蔬園的採摘項目，三十四度的天氣，又是長者又是孩子，酒店有接駁車，但是不肯接送，理由是車不能進入園區，實在是無語。這麼曬來回走了一個多鐘頭，大汗淋漓，心情好不了。唯一的服務方面好感就是離開時，遇到可能是保安同志，他主動幫忙拉行李。總體來説，和一些知名連鎖品牌酒店相比，服務方面得提高意識，得培訓，得改善客户的體驗。否則讓人沒有想再次消費的慾望。兩千一晚上，我們兩個房間四千塊錢，按理説應該是井井有條的服務，經得起推敲的細節，現在看來管理方面亟待提升，服務理念需要改善，應該想方設法讓客户滿意。

客房的膠囊咖啡機內循環也不中了 對 這有浪費了我珍貴的一瓶水
套餐有個mini bar暢飲 裏面有一個可樂一個雪碧 一個啤酒 確實暢飲了
服務我覺得她們也是有想做好的 但是可能人手太少了 入駐時候主動幫我約了足療 但是也不知道咋沒約上 各處服務的人員也不咋多
室外這個季節不能待太久 健身房設備壞了……
酒店風格整體還是不錯的 畢竟北京類似地酒店也沒幾家 就好好搞吧

1.酒店本身徽派古典，精雕細刻，是即雁棲酒店後又一滿意的酒店，比日出東方強。
2.服務有求必應，處處暖心。特別感謝前台的帥哥，和預訂部的彭小姐，由於孩子有課，不得不提前離開。
3.世園裡面黃昏轉轉，美不勝收。
4.需要提高的地方，早餐品種太少了。
5.整個世園裡麪硬件出色，但軟件需要提升，可玩的東西較少，這樣對酒店的拉動有限。

msg:環境位世園公園內，環境不用多説，整個公園直接提供輔助。步行2公里內可基本覆蓋中國館、植物園和樂高館，應該很方便了。但酒店設施稍微簡單了一些，游泳館經常不開放，其他商品部也基本沒有，餐廳自助比較簡單，可能來住的人數還是比較少吧。另外建議套間一個衞生間真的不方便，特別是僅有的一個衞生間還是明衞無遮擋的，😓！

環境和地理位置也非常好：出酒店南門步行三分鐘就是植物館和永寧閣，五分鐘到中國館，北門外即為媯河。
餐飲不錯但品種少，入住三晚，早餐兩天自助一天套餐，服務員説根據客人多少決定。午餐晚餐主要是套餐（588兩人），單點的種類很少。
服務態度好，免費升級了温泉套間，但人員訓練明顯不足，有點配不上豪華定位，現在沒有娛樂休閑設施開放，也沒聽客房送餐服務。
