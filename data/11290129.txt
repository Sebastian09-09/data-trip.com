The location of the hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city,  lots of high end shopping boutiques. Overall I would give my short vacation a 10/10 and highly recommended. Nina is very friendly and welcoming. Next time I am in chongqing I will be back.

msg:I checked into the niccolo hotel on the eve of May Day. I chose the N3 room type with L-shaped double-sided glass on the day of check-in.
Service staff: Ms. Yannie Zhang (thank you for the service)

Registration: There were many people on that day. Ms. Yannie led me and my companions to rest on the side and provided tea and water when checking in. She helped us to register with our ID cards and queued up on our behalf. She took the initiative to add WeChat and provided us with local travel information, which was quite convenient.

Check-in: When I just entered the room, the landscape facilities were consistent with the platform pictures, and there was no discrepancy. On the second day of check-in, Ms. Yannie asked about the check-in experience. After feedback, some minor hardware problems were all received before returning from the trip the next day, which was satisfactory. I experienced the self-service afternoon tea included in the N3 room booking. In the hotel lounge, you can see the Chaotianmen Raffles landmark, which is separated from the original afternoon tea restaurant location of the hotel, and has a certain degree of privacy. Satisfied.

Check-out: Most of the four-day and three-night trip was in good weather. Even if it rained and there was nowhere to go, the hotel was downstairs from the ifs International Finance Center, ole supermarket, beauty salon, nail salon, and hairdressing. Some skin care products that I forgot to bring can also be purchased in the basement of the mall. It is highly comprehensive and can be used in conjunction with the online gift package given when booking a room. The consumer experience is very satisfactory.

The breakfast is very average. First of all, the quantity feels that it may not even be half of the Westin Jiefangbei. Besides, the quality is not surprising. It feels like giving up breakfast. But the service staff are very good
In addition, let‚Äôs talk about subway travel. Although there is a subway just under the building, Gaode Navigation always gives up Exit 3. After going out, although you can see the hotel when you look up, you have to take a taxi, otherwise you can only walk up the winding uphill road by yourself. In fact, you have to go out of Exit 4 to enter the underground mall, turn right when you see Uniqlo, and walk a few dozen meters. There is an elevator on the right hand side that leads to Nigro and there is also a sign. Then change the elevator

msg:Because of a business trip, I went to Chengdu first. I also live in Niccolo~ So I also stayed in Chongqing. Let‚Äôs compare it below.

Facilities: In fact, the brands are the same and most of the hardware is the same. The rooms in Chengdu are small and the bathrooms are large. The rooms in Chongqing are large, the bathrooms are small, the hair dryers are of different brands, and the drinking water is also different. Niccolo's bedding is extremely comfortable (my favorite thing), but Chongqing obviously pays more attention to details. Disposable coffee cups are prepared next to the coffee machine for easy carrying when going out.

Hygiene: Overall good, can't fault it

Environment: Both Chengdu and Chongqing have a good location. Downstairs is the IFS shopping mall. There are always traffic jams on Chunxi Road in Chengdu. If you are traveling, it is not recommended to stay too long. The scenery on the top of the mountain in Chongqing is better than that in Chengdu. Don‚Äôt be too busy. It looks great and is great for taking photos. There is also Sandong Bridge nearby, which is very convenient and delicious.

Service: Before check-in, the housekeeper will call you and arrange the room, fruits and snacks for you according to your preferences. The person who contacted me was the butler Jinx, who was warm and considerate and could recognize me at the first sight when I arrived at the front desk. It was very touching. The fruits and chocolates given were delicious. The pre-sales and after-sales services were a critical victory over Niig in Chengdu. Luo.

I was also recommended by my best friend to stay in Niccolo, so I also recommend it to my friends who want to go to Chongqing. But you should think twice about it during holidays, it may cost 4-5k a night. When you go on a business trip, you must experience this hotel.

I would like to thank Nina who provided us with services during my stay. Both her attitude and service quality were impeccable. They were very patient and detailed when answering check-in questions. I personally tested the recommended community hotpot and it was very delicious!

Talking about the room itself, the main attraction of this hotel is the view, and N3 Deluxe River View highlights this selling point to the extreme. You can see the Grand Theater, the Bridge, and Hongya Cave. When the double-sided window curtains are raised, it is really shocking! The view made up for the lack of a bathtub in this room. Really worth it!

In terms of meals, afternoon tea is quite satisfactory, focusing on the scenery and supplemented by the taste of refreshments. Breakfast is very good, Chongqing noodles and camellia are highly recommended! The breakfast time is also very friendly, so you can catch up even if you sleep in. Be sure to try it if you have the chance!

In short, it is an experience worth the price. I will choose it again next time I come to Chongqing!

I like it very much, because the bathtub has almost become a standard feature of Internet celebrity hotels. It has almost no practical value except for being used by Internet celebrities to check in and take photos. However, the toilet seat is not functional, which is a bit backward. The afternoon tea provided by the hotel is very poor in content, and the location is not the best place. It seems nondescript and a bit stingy. The complimentary two pieces of laundry per day cannot be used on the same day. It is too rigid and not as flexible as Hotel Indigo to please guests. The breakfast is very rich, and the Chongqing noodles are more delicious than the oil tea. The hotel is located in the Guojin Building. If you walk back to the hotel, you need to walk up the gentle slope to the fourth floor (the entrance and exit on the third floor are closed after the Guojin business hours in the evening), which is a bit inconvenient. The hotel has a strong sense of design, and there is a large space to take photos of the river view at the other end of the lobby when you go down the stairs.

Afternoon tea is available in the room type, but it only starts at 4 pm. The view from the bar is still very good. There is also a turndown service in the evening. The butler Nina is very beautiful and elegant, and the service is attentive and thoughtful. She recommends good fun and delicious places. , before leaving, he also helped me and my children take some beautiful photos of the hotel. It was a very casual and comfortable stay.

msg:This stay was the best overall experience I had in Chongqing during the Chinese New Year. It is also the hotel with the best service among the five-star hotels (Golden Diamond) in Chongqing.
The first point: I booked a premium king bed on Ctrip and upgraded it to N1, and was given a river view room, which is very rare. The scenery is beautiful, and you can see all the beautiful scenery on the other side directly.
Second point: The butler Nina (yes, the super beautiful one) has very considerate service. During my stay, I accidentally broke the red wine glass. The butler and the supervisor thoughtfully bandaged the wound on my hand and gave me a very precious gift. Nina provided special food and transportation routes to scenic spots near the hotel as soon as she checked in, which greatly satisfied the guests' dining needs.
The third point: Compared with a five-star (also Golden Diamond) hotel where I stayed in Chongqing for the first two nights, the overall decoration of Niccolo is more modern, with a strong artistic a**osphere and more refined soft furnishing materials. The overall design is more innovative. In your spare time in the evening, you can have a drink at the observation bar on the 62nd floor, overlooking the entire city of Chongqing at your feet. It is full of brilliance and prosperity. by the way: The resident singing team is great, but it is said that the person I met on the night was a temporary substitute.

msg:The hotel is located in the core CBD of Jiangbei District. It is quite convenient to travel from the hotel. However, when I went to the front desk on the 4th floor (close to 12 noon), there was no one to guide me. I booked the n1 room type. The housekeeper Yuki contacted me one day in advance to inquire. If you have any needs (do you need a non-smoking room, do you have a baby, etc.), they are very considerate. The room is overall üâëÔ∏è, but there is no small refrigerator (suites have it). Although this room type is not a river view room, you can still see the river view, which is still very nice at night. It's beautiful, the bedding is very comfortable, and there are different pillows available! On the last night, I asked for a travel outfit from yuki, but yuki gave me a lot. Haha, yuki is so cute. Finally, I would like to add that the soundproofing of the door is very poor (but the guests who shouted in the middle of the night were too unqualified to speak normally. It‚Äôs okay, I was woken up immediately around 1 o‚Äôclock)

msg:The hotel is in a very good location, with restaurants and supermarkets downstairs very convenient. But the hotel room photos on Ctrip are obviously misleading. When checking in at the hotel, I was told that some non-smoking rooms in room types 1 and N2 do not have bathtubs. If you need a bathtub, you will have to pay extra and cannot be upgraded to N3 room type for free. When I looked inside the room, I found that it had a connecting door with the room next to it, which is a room type that is divided into a suite. It is probably because of this that there is no bathtub. After coordination with the front office manager, one of the two N1 rooms booked was changed to one with a bathtub. Later, he was unhappy and was given a cheese birthday cake as a gift. It was resolved satisfactorily. Since there are obviously more guests who want non-smoking than smoking, it is recommended to adjust the ratio and set more rooms as non-smoking rooms.
There is still a certain gap between the hotel's facilities and other brands of luxury hotels, including the hotel's hot pool and swimming pool, showers in the room, etc., and the elevators are also slightly crowded.

The first time I asked, I was told there wasn't one. Later, I was asked to tell me where it might be placed before I found it (it was in the cabinet where my aunt had been cleaning it a few days ago). A few days later, I found some cosmetics left behind. After consultation, I was told that no one had stayed in the room I stayed in for a few days and no cosmetics were found. Did the aunt clean it and throw it away, or did she really not find it? Is this how you clean your room? Can't even check and discover the guest's belongings in time and take relevant measures?

When we arrived at the hotel, nothing was decorated and the room was not cleaned. We arrived a full hour later than we told the housekeeper.
Forget it. The later staff apologized and we also expressed our understanding.

2. When I returned to Hangzhou, I found that half of the deposit was refunded without any explanation. I sent a message to the housekeeper but no one responded? ? ?

It's not even close to a five-star hotel. The management is too chaotic and there's no service at all.

msg:I went to Chongqing for a weekend trip and booked this hotel. The sewer in the hotel room was clogged and water spread out. The old man stepped on it and slipped. He immediately notified the hotel staff and informed the relevant situation. Fortunately, the old man was not seriously injured and only knelt down on his left knee. The initial judgment was that the ligament was strained and he could walk slowly. After confirming with the old man again and again, we informed the hotel that we had to rush back to Chengdu. We would go to the hospital for examination immediately after returning to Chengdu, and the hospital's examination sheet was sent to the hotel. After slipping on the morning of the 14th, I went to the hospital for a checkup early on the 15th and took a CT scan. Sure enough, no bones were injured. It was a sprained ligament. The doctor prescribed medicine and told us to go for a follow-up MRI if the pain was not relieved after a week. After the re-examination, the doctor confirmed that the ligament was torn due to slipping and kneeling, and it could be recovered slowly after rest. I sent the hospital registration and related inspection reports to the hotel, and the hotel told me that it took too long to solve the problem. I think a The facilities of a 5-star hotel are so bad, and the sewers are always blocked. As a result, after customers fall down, they have a negative attitude and are prevaricated. This is difficult for us as guests to accept.

When I checked in, I added the WeChat account of the butler Jinx. During the few days I stayed, the butler kept caring about my stay and whether I needed room supplies. The addition is very considerate. Every staff member in the lobby has a really beautiful smile. I feel healed. It is indeed the service of a five-star hotel. I am very happy to come back next time. The next stop is Changsha. This is the four Niig hotels in the country. Luo is here!

msg:The location of the hotel is great, with Guojin upstairs and the subway downstairs. It only takes 20 minutes to take a taxi from Jiangbei Airport. The view from the river view room is indeed very good. If the weather is nice, you can get up early to see the sunrise. However, compared to the positioning of the hotel, the hardware facilities in the room are still a bit inferior. The hair dryer and kettle feel like the configuration of a business hotel. But the toiletries are provided very well, and bath balls are also given. Unfortunately, there was a power outage in the hotel on the last night, so I didn't sleep well. And you don‚Äôt actually have to eat breakfast in the hotel. After all, Chongqing‚Äôs breakfast is very rich. But on the last day, I was lazy and wanted to eat at the hotel, but there was a lack of guidance on catering. When I met an elderly tour group, I could actually guide them to sit together. The old Chinese people who have no sense of boundaries are really annoying. They sit across from you and chat loudly without asking, and they stand up and face you with their buttocks. A breakfast with such a beautiful view suddenly felt boring. The overall service of the hotel is very good, and the service of the hotel housekeeper Nina is also very considerate. I will probably choose here again next time I come.

The assistant Nina communicated my needs in advance and added a few pillows that I needed. During the stay, the assistant Nina answered all questions and also recommended surrounding food. I applied for late check-out when I left the hotel, and everything went smoothly.

The refreshments in the hotel's free afternoon tea are also good. Hong Kong hotels are pretty good. Buns of the same quality should cost at least 30 yuan each outside.

The location is above ifc, and downstairs there are some big-name restaurants and restaurants. There is a Sichuan restaurant called Chai, which is delicious, and the roasted pigeon is good.

The only drawback is that the toilet is not smart. If you come to Chongqing, you will understand it. A smart toilet can alleviate your worries after hot pot.

If you don‚Äôt want to stay in a hotel, you can just take a taxi and go anywhere. , it only takes 15 minutes by taxi without traffic jams from Chongqing North Railway Station. In addition, Niccolo slippers are the most comfortable hotel slippers I have ever worn. The service staff in the parking lot at the hotel entrance have accurate and attentive eyes. In addition, I hope that the breakfast will be organic and delicious, and the hotel's fragrance will be more advanced. I hope that Niccolo will have more Loyal fans.

I paid extra, but no room was given during this period (even though I paid, I was not given a specific room, and it was said that it had not been cleaned yet, so I had to wait). When my parents came back after dinner (an hour later), they came back and asked if the cleaning was still not completed. , that is, there was no room available, and I asked to continue waiting. About half an hour later, I went to the front desk to ask, but the cleaning was still not finished. I waited for two hours. When paying the money, my dad asked for a smoking room. When he arrived, he asked for a smoking room. When I checked into the room, I found that it was not a smoking room. The staff really didn‚Äôt know if they were working seriously and responsibly? There was a little duck in the hotel room. My mother called and asked if she could take it away. The staff responded: If you give me a good review, you can take it away. I will not stay at this hotel for a second time, so please choose carefully. I have stayed in many star-rated hotels, but this time it was very disappointing.

For a short business trip, you will also be assigned a 24-hour housekeeper, whether it is the beautiful and gentle Miss Catherine. And Archer, the guy at the front desk, is really considerate in every way. Needless to say, he even upgraded your room type for you. Then the distinguished guests invited by me from abroad were not upgraded to a room type. I asked for it, and they were immediately sorry and dealt with. The attitude was perfect üíØ. I must recommend it. In addition, the water chat on the 52nd floor here is also very good, so remember to come and experience it.

Another cracking recommendation, only five stars, but unfortunately there are no 8-star recommendations. Every time I stay in Niellog I go to the spa to relax. This time I was exposed to the sun in Japan and I didn‚Äôt have time to do facial repair when I returned home. When I arrived at the spa, I originally chose the ordinary 780 facial repair item. After hearing my situation, Miss Mary recommended me to have a La Mer facial. There is no menu for this item in the store. After asking in detail, the facial alone is 1680-60 minutes, and 1880 is 60 minutes of body spa + 60 minutes of facial. I think it is a very good deal, because a 60-minute body spa also costs 680, which is equal to my facial. That‚Äôs 1,280. Isn‚Äôt it worth it to get a full set of La Mer facial care at this price (a regular five-star hotel in Shanghai costs 2,500-3,000)? Finally, after chatting and communicating with the store, because I am also an old customer here, I stay here every time I go on business trips to Chongqing, and foreign guests all arrange to stay here, so the store upgraded me to 1980. The La Mer facial mask project really made my after-sun repair the perfect ending. This is the first half, and it‚Äôs already a surprise
After doing the project, I discovered that this is not a 60-minute facial trea**ent. She not only takes care of your neck and face at the same time, but also gives you a cream massage on your upper body, shoulders, and back of your necküíÜ‚ôÇÔ∏è, this grand operation What a genius. Every step of Miss Mary's massage technique is very comfortable and professional. After the massage, the whole face and eyes feel lifted. In short, this is my real consumption experience. I recommend it to you, so rush in.

I originally planned to go to Regent next time, but after receiving the return call, I decided to choose Niccolo next time. Overall, it was very good!

msg:I have stayed at Niccolo in Chengdu and Changsha, as well as the Murry Hotel in Hong Kong. This time I came to Chongqing and chose Niccolo. The hotel is located above the Jiangbeicheng International Financial Center. The service is very good. The butler Jinx is very considerate. Upgraded Being on the executive floor, free laundry and happy hour are great. The hotel may be a bit unventilated due to the weather in Chongqing. The air in the room is not very good and a bit humid. The breakfast is crowded because of too many people. The environment and variety are average. Chongqing noodles are okay. Except for Guojin, there are not many places to eat snacks nearby. You can only take the subway or take a taxi.

msg:I have lived in Niccolo in Chongqing before, before the epidemic. I stayed here on a business trip. This time I took my parents and children to Chongqing and still chose Niccolo. I found that after so many years, Niccolo Luo maintains the rooms and public facilities very well, it doesn't feel old at all, it's the same as it was a few years ago. Let me talk about my experience of this stay. Because it was the National Day holiday, there were a lot of people. I stayed for four days and three nights. From check-in to final check-out, I did not feel that it was crowded or noisy or that the service could not keep up. On the contrary, every waiter was very nice. Nice, they kindly greet us every day when we come in and out and daily check-in needs, which makes me feel comfortable. The breakfast is still very rich and the Chongqing noodles are very delicious. Parents and children have to eat a bowl every morning. The room feels very good and has everything you need. The room service is also responsive. The room is large and comfortable, but there is just one thing I don't like. I feel that Niccolo needs to be improved, and I hope that the toilets can be replaced with smart ones in the future, because many hotels now have smart toilets, which are very convenient to use. The traditional toilets should be eliminated, and smart control systems can also be added to the rooms, such as The curtains can be opened automatically upon check-in, or have a one-button sleep function... In short, I hope Niccolo will get better and better. Thank you to the front desk staff Catherine Yan Yi for her warm service and greetings. I will choose Niccolo next time I come to Chongqing. ~

Because I slept too late the day before, I told the housekeeper that I wanted to delay check-out, and he was very happy to postpone our check-out until 2 p.m., which gave me time to experience the skyline swimming pool.

msg:It was my first time to come to Chongqing and I had a mixed bag of hotels. I finally chose one of only four in the country - Niccolo Hotel.
The scenery outside the window of Jiangbeizui, where land is so precious, gave me a feeling like seeing the Bund in Shanghai. The hardware of the hotel is very impressive. There are many business travelers and young people inside. The uniforms of the hotel staff are very good-looking, which is enough to tell that this hotel is The hotel‚Äôs appearance is top notch online
The room has a super high floor. When you open the door, you can see the "city skyline". It makes you feel happy physically and mentally. It feels like you are living in the clouds, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Another: The fragrance in the hotel is very good. It feels like it can dispel the smell of hot pot. Hahaha
The facilities in the room are dark black, which makes it look very high-end. Very few five-star hotels use this color scheme, which makes everyone here feel young and classy.
I thought it was a flashy hotel with nothing but good looks, but I didn't expect that everyone's service was super considerate and attentive. It felt like "coming home" and it truly felt like home.
Especially Miss Zoe, she contacted me one night in advance and asked me carefully about the room requirements I wanted to choose. She tried her best to satisfy me ü•π It not only made me feel warm in my heart when I came to this strange Chongqing for the first time.
The young and beautiful Miss Zoe understands the feelings of outsiders very well. She asked carefully if she had any tips and recommended many check-in places that locals like. The scenery also recommended the famous scenery in the hotel "Beijing Girl", which is very suitable for taking pictures and check-in. There were thoughtful little gifts on the bed during the opening night. It was so unforgettable. The butler service given to me was even more considerate than that of a certain hotel called Xingji, which is famous for its butler service! !
I never expected that Niccolo Hotel would provide such meticulous service and give guests a super nice experience. I would like to thank Ms. Zoe for your meticulous attention to making our hotel experience even more special! I really wish I could stay a few more nights. I really can‚Äôt bear to go to Chongqing or the other three cities with Niccolo Hotels next time. I will choose it without hesitation. Thank you "City Skyline" Niccolo Hotel. Thank you, Miss Zoe. We brought a beautiful trip experience to Chongqing‚ù§ Looking forward to seeing you next time

msg:There is a saying that Niccolo's environmental hygiene is as high as ever. This may be the only answer to the fact that it has been on the list for so many years. I happened to travel to Chongqing some time ago and planned to see that the hotels are relatively cheap recently. To be honest, it is a small gain (two The price is 2300 for Gaoke in the evening, and the price rises to N1-3300 after arriving at the hotel.) I came to Chongqing five years ago and stayed at Hotel N3, so I was very confident about the hotel during this trip, thinking that I would not step on the wrong side. However, I don‚Äôt know that Gaoke is only about the direction of the view and the interior of the room. The facilities are almost equivalent to hotel room types that cost around 500 yuan outside, so it‚Äôs so cheap that I don‚Äôt want to be greedy and I‚Äôll persuade Ctrip Gaoke to leave! I immediately upgraded to N1 after just one look (I had to wait for an hour to change the room type).
       In fact, the person checking in at the front desk knew that we would not be satisfied with the original room type, so after recording the identity information, he directly suggested that we upgrade to a room. My original words were that we should take a look first. If we are not satisfied after two nights, I can upgrade to the second night ( It turns out that I have always had unspeakable confidence in the hotel.) In the end, after just one look, I was upgraded from the wrong type to the big wrong type. The hotel is only suitable for check-in and extension, which makes little sense. Room types above N1 have a relatively good night view. After all, the floor Put it there
        On the first day, my wife had blisters on her feet. She wore hotel slippers when she entered the public area to prepare for a meal. The staff called the dining area slippery because she was afraid that my wife would slip. We expressed inconvenience and asked to go back to the room to change shoes. Should I take responsibility for my slip or fall, or should I be asked to change my shoes before I can eat? ? ? ok We can cooperate with your hotel to maintain this high-end and elegant etiquette of not wearing slippers in public areas! but! After breakfast the next day, I saw someone wearing hotel slippers while dining in the public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe restaurant. How do you explain this? ? I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a double standard or an oversight, but no matter what, I will definitely not stay here again in the future.
        The only people who have a good impression of the hotel are the lady who cleans the rooms and the concierge at the foyer. Thank youüôè

First of all, this is not a bad review, this is a guide for subsequent guests to stay in.

If you are a masochist about hotel service, if you are a "**" who is stupid and has too much money, if you are a ***, then this store is your best choice! And you are also the "chosen one" who continues to place an order after reading the reviews.

Passing through Chongqing on 8.28, I chose between Regent and this store (well, yes, I don‚Äôt want to name the name in advance, this feels like eating flies and revisiting it again), because I have lived in Fushi before. InterContinental, after looking at Regent‚Äôs design online, I thought this one was better. At the same time, I felt that a hotel priced around 3,000 would be fine, so I randomly chose *.

Around 15:30 in the afternoon, the front desk staff called and wanted to add me on WeChat, but I refused while I was driving.

I arrived at the hotel at 22:00 in the evening and got off the bus to the floor of ifs. I looked around, but I couldn't find the hotel's sign or entrance instructions. Well, I understand, this is the tone of a noble design hotel. Who makes me a blind rural person? !

After entering the lobby, the concierge in a white shirt said good evening in a weak voice. After I walked in the wrong direction and found that it was wrong, I asked him where the hotel elevator was in the direction, * looked up at me with his lower eyelids, and pointed me the way with * that noble and unnecessary chin. Well, I understand, *is not a hotel staff after all.

After twists and turns, I finally entered the elevator, and I was greeted with a strong, pungent perfume smell. Well, I understand, *maybe *** carefully prepared it for me. I am a native and have never seen the world. When checking in at the front desk, the staff again wanted to add me on WeChat, but I refused.

If there is a suite in a domestic joint brand hotel, I will always choose a suite, and this time is no exception. But there are exceptions: when you open the door, you can smell a strong and pungent smell of 84 disinfectant, the suite does not have a special dressing room, and the toilet is not automatic. Well, I understand, I'm used to being extravagant, life should be simple.

Leaving the store early the next morning, during breakfast time, *** finally perfectly presented the climax of the abuse service. In front of the egg stand, I want an omelet. At this moment, the noble chef Eric is chatting with his colleagues in the meal preparation room. The ungloved fingers grabbed the mushrooms with bare hands and started cooking. At this moment, there are no other customers at the egg stall, so I have been quietly standing opposite and waiting. When the egg rolls were about to be ready, *snapped the pan to the dinner plate with a bang, and I was worried that the plate would break if I smashed it like this. After * finishing buckling in this way, he flicked the dinner plate to the side of the noodle bar, then glanced at me with *'s lower eyelids and left. Rural people with low self-esteem like me thought that the * process was not over yet. After waiting for a while, I timidly asked the noodle chef next to me if the egg rolls were ready? he said yes. Oh, then I'll take it out of the noodle stall myself. I understand that *** is very noble, and it is a respect for me to make egg rolls for me, how can I use * that noble limbs to pass them to me? !

In order not to disturb other guests, I took the egg roll back to my table. However, if this were in my own hotel, the plate would probably fly right into Eric's face. After returning to the table, I asked the restaurant manager for the name of this noble lady, and told the restaurant manager that the egg roll should be sent back to the lady to eat by herself.

After all, someone like me who only spends less than 3,000 and wants to beg from *** is unworthy.
At the scene, I complained to the restaurant manager, and then I checked out and left the store without looking back. I don't deserve this place!
After complaining, I received calls from the assistant lobby manager and the guest relations manager, apologizing and asking me to go back and stay another night. I really don‚Äôt deserve it and I don‚Äôt want to eat the flies again.

And I never accepted the apology from these two Chinese girls. It's not your fault, and there's no need for you to blame me for ***'s mistakes. The person who needs to apologize is either your vice president in charge or Eric himself. After I didn't receive your calls due to work, no one contacted me again. Well, I understand. After all, how can your noble vice president have the patience to find my contact information? ! Also, you have such a professional service, how can you ask me for WeChat twice, but you don‚Äôt know how to leave the guest‚Äôs contact information when checking in? !

As someone who owns my own company and also has foreign employees, I am very puzzled: How can a store at this price provide such poor service? ! It is easy to understand if one thing is done badly, but doing everything badly requires a certain level. Later, I specifically read the negative reviews on Ctrip, and I understood that the biggest problem with this store may be these ***.

I would like to say to the restaurant manager, assistant lobby manager, and guest relations manager: The domestic hotel industry has changed a long time ago. With your ability and standard of treating me, you can find a better job than this place anywhere. Leave as soon as possible, yes You yourselves too! If you can't find you, come to me and I will make arrangements.

As for those Eric and *** who make money from Chinese people, throw Chinese bowls, and scold Chinese women, I also say this to you: Be human! Do it if you can, and **** it if you can't! , Well, don't think too much, I'm talking about Back.

The soft foreskin on the bedside background was scratched. The quilt was not breathable at all, and I was covered in sweat. Neither does Riverview.

msg:I was discussing with a Chongqing person who is better than the InterContinental across the river. In fact, I am on the side of Niccolo... The Chongqing person thought Niccolo was a bit rustic... I didn't choose the Intercontinental, but Raffles because the terrain was too complicated.

This room type comes with an unparalleled river view and is worth staying at. Especially the night view
More and more hotels now offer free minibars. The decoration and equipment still meet the requirements. When staying in a hotel, you must stay in a new hotel that has only been open for a few years (this is indirectly supported by the fact that the scores of many established hotels on Ctrip have been falling). Even though there is no bathtub, it is still recommended to make up for it, after all, it is of this level.

There are many snacks worth trying during happy hour, which are considered exquisite among the hotels I have stayed in. Occasionally, there is a situation where the fruits are not replenished.
The breakfast stall is also closed at 10:30 on weekdays, which is convenient for people who get up late. The food scene is not big, but there is an a la carte menu. The breakfast buffet is also exquisite. Personally, I think the breakfast here is better than that of the Intercontinental opposite (the Intercontinental will lose in PK breakfast, Raffles Intercontinental really needs to reflect on it, there are so many buses parked in the restaurant, but in fact there is not much food).

It's easier to go shopping. The things sold in the mall downstairs are more expensive, so there are fewer people than in Raffles.

Finally, I would like to suggest that it is a good thing that more and more hotels are paying attention to Ctrip's user reviews. But I can‚Äôt just add you on WeChat when I check in, ignore you the whole time, and then ask you to write a good review for me when I check out...

The environment is first-class, and the service attitude is also very good. Although there were some incidents during the stay, the hotel can effectively and quickly deal with it. It is worth admiring. The 270¬∞ river view room in the Discovery Suite is very good, and it provides many free services, such as laundry, Afternoon tea on the 62nd floor, etc., the minibar can also be used for free, which is very good! The breakfast is delicious. The only thing is that the place is a bit small and you need to wait for a seat during peak hours. The overall layout of the hotel is very similar to the Ritz-Carlton in Hong Kong. I will still choose this hotel next time I come to Chongqing!

msg:During the summer trip to Chongqing with children, I booked Chongqing Moujing Hotel, which is famous for its good service, and Niccolo. For me, Niccolo‚Äôs service is perfect!!!

First of all, I would like to give a big thumbs up to Sara, our housekeeper. She is as tall as a model. She has big eyes that can talk and she speaks softly. She loves to eat. I always like to order takeaway. Sara will deliver it for me every time It took me a lot of time to go back and forth. Every time before delivering something, I would send a WeChat message to communicate with me and ask if I had any other needs. It was really considerate and I was able to quickly respond to and deal with the raised needs. I felt taken care of. I feel very comfortable and warm

Hotel lobby manager Jesmine helped me arrange a room on the 60th floor with a pleasant view. It is spacious and unobstructed. You can see the river view from the window. It is very comfortable to live in.

After checking in, Shirley in the lobby looked at us with the child and came over with a smile to give the child a Transformers toy. The child was so happyü•≥ At the same time, she introduced us to the breakfast location and took us around. The service is first-class! !

The location of the hotel is in the IFC, a commercial and gourmet center. There are many big brands. It is very convenient to buy and buy. The subway entrance is also downstairs in the shopping mall. The transportation is convenient

I really like the turndown service provided every day and the random little surprise gifts. When I go out to play and return to the hotel, the room is neat and clean, and the oncoming staff greet me with smiles.

For me who is sensitive to smell, the only problem I have is that the carpet smells a bit

First-class service hotel in Chongqing.

After reporting to the front desk, they immediately upgraded us to a room with a good view and a quiet environment. The room made us very satisfied. Downstairs of the hotel is IFS, so it is very convenient to find food.

The floor height of the room is very high. What I like most about the decoration of the room is its sink. It is very beautiful and is the finishing touch of the room. However, the shower room looks generally dirty. Such an expensive toilet is actually manual, which is a bit of a loss.
The place for breakfast is cramped. For such a big hotel, the breakfast place should be larger. The food is average. The chef who cooks the noodles looks bad and has a bad face üåö all the time. It's a little uncomfortable. The thing that is remarkable is its pastry buns , Exquisite and delicious, in general the breakfast is average and not worth the price. A bit disappointed

msg:Stay in room 5620, which is a non-river view room in N1. Because there are tall buildings everywhere in Chongqing, and the living floors are high, the view is also good. If you look to the right, you can see some rivers.
I encountered a more dangerous incident that night, my mother was in the room, and I took the child to swim. When we came back, we smelled a very strong smell of burnt electrical wires in the room. My mother didn't smell it because she stayed in the room from the beginning. When I called the front desk, an employee in charge of engineering also smelled the burnt wires when he came in. The reason for checking was the electric kettle‚Äôs wire problem, but the front desk didn‚Äôt take the initiative to propose a solution. The room, because the smell of burnt wires in the room is too strong, it is really impossible to stay. The front desk also responded and coordinated a room of the same standard as 6012. A person on duty led them there, imagining the situation of packing up at 11 o'clock at night, the old and the young dragging the boxes and carrying the bags and shoes to move the nest, it's like fleeing from famine.
There is one thing to say, the cleanliness of the hotel is quite good, and the cleaning lady is also very diligent and conscientious. She seems to be called Zhang Liangying. The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. But the location is really crowded as many reviews said. For breakfast, in addition to some dishes on the table, there is also a menu on the table that you can order. I didn‚Äôt know it on the first day, but I didn‚Äôt know until the next day. Because it was too hot, I didn't want to go out at noon the next day, so I had a group lunch at Xinchu 298 (Chinese food). The taste was excellent. The garlic cheese bread before the meal was delicious. Because I went late, the yellow croaker was gone and I replaced it with Duobao. The fish, the fish meat is fresh and tender, and other dishes are also very nice. Because my mother is from the Hui nationality, a handsome and not-so-tall male manager (I forgot his name) has been taking care of me, and I also replaced the pork bone soup with fish soup.
The environment of the swimming pool is also good, the swimming pool is big enough, the water is clear enough, and there are two small hot spring pools for massage. The children were thinking about swimming all day long, and they played well this time. The shower changing room has sweat steaming and wet steaming, as well as swimsuit drying, which is very practical. It's a pity that there is no communal laundry room. After all, the Golden Diamond Hotel, these are paid services.
When checking out, two small cubes of hot pot seasoning were given away. It is recommended to check and replace electrical appliances regularly, otherwise the consequences will be disastrous.

I contacted me in advance and added WeChat to ask about the privileges given to Ctrip Golden Diamond customers. The executive lounge actually depends on whether there is a quota on the day? That‚Äôs not what Ctrip stipulates. This 1-point bonus is caused by your housekeeper Cherry. She added WeChat in advance but did not inform me that the swimming pool was closed for maintenance (looking at other comments, it turned out that she was filming). She usually replies to me after an hour. The later explanation was also because I complained to Ctrip about leaving the store early and I sent this large message. I can see the lack of service.

As expected, any corner of the photo is an ins fashion blogger. It is more than 300 meters above the cloud and has 252 elegant and chic rooms, which combine modern and fashionable styles. Each room can enjoy a 360-degree view of Chongqing city. Excellent stay experience as the highest hotel in Chongqing, there is a good restaurant "Xinchu", the service is also good, the entire 62nd floor. The breakfast is semi-buffet. I like to bake waffles at 7:00 in the morning. There are few people and the view is good by the window. The 52nd floor of the hotel also has a skyline swimming pool, a fitness center, and a jacuzzi, each of which can release the body and mind. The bar at night is also very distinctive, and you can enjoy the beautiful night scenery of Chongqing by the window.
The most memorable thing is the service of the staff. I would like to thank the little housekeeper, Catherine, who helped us smoothly and kindly from check-in to check-out. On the second night, we continued our stay and added breakfast. Will come again next time.
