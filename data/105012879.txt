msg:I was very satisfied with this stay. The public areas of the hotel are well designed, with many places to sit and daydream, read or chat with friends. The rooms are also very comfortable, and the supplies are quite considerate, such as free snacks, fruits, drinks, books, laundry detergent; there are also activities for guests to participate.

The hotel is very private, with one or two rooms as an exception. Especially when I opened the curtains in the morning, I felt happy to see the woods outside.

The waiters in the restaurant were very attentive, and they would take the initiative to bring us shawls at night to prevent us from catching a cold. No matter where you sit, the hotel waiters will take the initiative to provide tea.

The disadvantage is that the door of the guest room closes loudly, and you will be woken up at night. The hotel is in the woods, and there are many mosquitoes; be prepared for mosquito prevention.

Very comfortable and happy two nights!

The hotel upgraded us to a second room for free. What a big bathtub.

But what surprised me the most was that the food was really delicious!!! You must try the bacon sour soup hot pot!!!

The scenery is super beautiful. The lady even upgraded our room. It's worth driving 2,000 kilometers, haha. The dinner tastes very good too. You can have a drink at the bar in the evening. There are also hand-made and tea-making activities in the afternoon. You won't be bored. If you don't want to participate, it's super cool to stay in the room and look at the scenery outside, especially in the evening. The photos are also great. I really don't want to leave once I come here. I look forward to seeing you again.

The butler service is very good, and we were informed of the route in advance! Before the car arrived, we saw the butler Xiao Shen brother greet us at the door, and he helped us take the large and small bags of luggage in as soon as the car stopped. Seeing that we were very hot, he also poured us cold drinks thoughtfully!
The morning buffet lasted until 1 pm, which was too friendly for lazy people. Yang Yang and Aunt Xiaoqin in the restaurant enthusiastically introduced us to the surrounding attractions. PS: Their rice noodles are delicious!
The room is very clean, and every staff member you meet here will greet you, and it feels very kind!
This is a place where you can stay for a day!

The housekeeper was waiting at the door with an umbrella in advance, and then he helped us with the luggage very enthusiastically. There were more surprises later. I personally feel that the hygiene is very good, and the details are not ignored because of environmental factors. The scenery is charming, and the rain is simply fairy-like. It is difficult to be in a bad mood in this environment. In the evening, I sat in the cave bar and had a drink, looking at the blue swimming pool and blue sky in front of me, which made people trance. Speaking of meals, it surpasses many five-star hotels. I can't eat enough kimchi and radish. The freshly made rice noodles are mainly very good in taste, and the breakfast variety is also very complete. Finally, the service, all the staff are very professional and enthusiastic, taking care of every guest in detail, responding to requests, and responding very promptly. It was a perfect experience. I will definitely come again when I have time. I recommend it üòÑüòÑüòäüòä‚ò∫Ô∏è. It is definitely a trip that makes you feel refreshed.

msg:I took my almost 70-year-old parents to Chishui for 6 days and 5 nights, and stayed in Jianglu for 3 consecutive nights (except for a few hours in Bing'an Ancient Town, the rest of the time I stayed in the hotel). The experience was great and my parents were very satisfied! 
1. Environment: The hotel is divided into two areas: caves and bamboo forests. The fusion design of hotel rooms + natural caves + natural waterfalls is very amazing, especially when I went there in the off-season. There are not many people traveling in Chishui, and even fewer people staying in the hotel. Therefore, sometimes you can enjoy the wonderful natural space alone, such as sitting on the public terrace of the cave and watching the trees swaying in front of you and the natural waterfall flowing down from the cave, sitting quietly in the infinity pool and restaurant to watch the scenery in the distance, and lying in the room for a nap and hearing the birds and the sound of running water, which is very comfortable. My mother also tried to take a lot of photos every day according to the direction of the Internet celebrity check-in photos. 
2. Service: Give full marks. The hotel staff are very friendly and enthusiastic. For example, the former deputy manager of the hotel and the curly-haired butler Xiao Li at the front desk learned that we did not drive and the temperature was high and wanted to walk to Bing'an Ancient Town. He was afraid that my parents could not walk, so he offered to drive us back and forth; Xiao Song and Yang Yang, the butlers of the restaurant, were the ones we had the most contact with during our stay. The service was very warm and thoughtful. We would chat with them when there were few guests; there were also other unknown front desk ladies and brothers and cleaning aunts who were very friendly. Every day, the front desk butler (people on different shifts should use the same WeChat account) will also remind the restaurant of dining, good night desserts, butler's off-duty time, etc. on WeChat, which is very thoughtful and warm.
3. Facilities: There are many thoughtful designs and supplies in the guest rooms, such as heated towel racks, push-button switch shower head options, toilets with washlets, automatic curtains, Dyson hair dryers with various blowers, etc. The only thing my mother felt was that since the wash basin, bathroom and toilet were all independent spaces, there was no place to hang towels or put clothes in the bathroom. Even for a family, it was a bit inconvenient to take a bath. Later, the front desk temporarily arranged a chair at the door of the bathroom.
4. Dining: We ate in the hotel restaurant for three days. Breakfast was open until 13:00, which was very considerate. We could wait until lunch to finish the noodles. When there were many guests, it was a buffet breakfast. When there were few guests, we would choose what we wanted to eat in advance the night before (but the food prepared in advance would get cold easily). For dinner, we ordered in advance using the QR code, and then the housekeeper would put all the dishes on the table on time (usually in advance). The dishes we chose were more in line with the taste of Shanghai people, and they all tasted good. It was said that it was made by a young chef in his twenties. Green pepper chicken, stir-fried porcini mushrooms and bamboo shoots and bacon hot pot were recommended.
5. Experience activities: I experienced Mizhi handmade, which was very interesting. The front desk manager will prepare the tools and materials, and briefly explain the order of laying stones, water plants, moss, etc., and then you can do it yourself. My parents and I each made one, haha. In addition, the hotel also offers free tea by the pool from 17:30 to 23:00 every day. You can roast and cook small potatoes, sweet potatoes, peanuts, marshmallows, citrus, etc.

Looking from the window, there happens to be a dripping waterfall falling from the top of the head, which is very Zen-like. The swimming pool is also particularly artistic at night. However, it is not easy to open a hotel in a cave in this remote place, and we need everyone's support! What's rare is that the butlers' service is attentive and conscientious, reaching a five-star level. Miss Li Min in the restaurant is a local, down-to-earth and very encouraging! .

msg:I saw this hotel on Xiaohongshu and thought it was very unique, so I chose to stay there for a day. All experiences are very good.

Transportation: The hotel is in Chishui City, but there is no high-speed rail station or airport in Chishui. You can only come here by car. You can choose to come from Luzhou (where there is an airport and a high-speed rail station) which takes about 1.5 hours; you can also choose to come from Chongqing which takes at least 2.5 hours. I saw other comments saying that the road up the mountain is difficult to drive. You can watch the video in my review to feel whether your driving skills can handle such road conditions, and then decide whether to drive by yourself or charter a car. In addition, after entering the mountain, it is a one-way road. If you encounter a passing car, you must back up to a special meeting area to avoid it (see Figure 1)

Service: Before check-in, the housekeeper will notify you of various matters via WeChat. If you have any issues, you can also communicate with the housekeeper in advance through WeChat. When we checked in during the off-season this time, we were directly upgraded to the hotel's most unique cave room type (you can see exposed rocks in the room), which indeed made the experience even more special.

Catering: When staying in a hotel, you basically have to eat all three meals in the hotel. There are also a lot of fruit snacks and drinks in the room that two people can't finish...so you don't have to worry about going hungry. Dinner on the night of arrival was ordered at the hotel, and it tasted good. My wife ordered Mapo Tofu, which went very well with her meal, so she ordered 3 bowls of rice... Breakfast started at 8:30 and lasted until 1 p.m., and it was still there before we left. The breakfast noodle stall cooked two bowls of noodles for lunch, and the waiter said they could add more if they were not enough.

Facilities: I won‚Äôt go into details about the public areas. They are consistent with what you see in Xiaohongshu or the comment area. What you see is what you get. I feel like the waterfall pouring down from the hotel will be even bigger and more spectacular in the summer! The facilities in the room are basically top-notch. Not to mention the Dyson hair dryer that is standard in high-end hotels and luxury B&Bs. The kettle is a smart kettle that can set the desired temperature; the TV is a Huawei smart TV, and my wife‚Äôs Huawei mobile phone is used to cast variety shows When I put it on the TV, I feel that the clarity and frame rate have become higher! (We often use the screen mirroring function on all-season TVs. This time, the screen mirroring on Huawei TVs really feels like a significant change!) There is also a Michelle speaker beside the bed that can be connected to a mobile phone.

I feel that this hotel is worth a stay for 1-2 days for couples traveling to Chongqing, Sichuan, and Guizhou or families without children to experience it (if you are bringing children, I personally feel that a day is about the same, but after a long stay, there seems to be no entertainment for children)

The only shortcoming is that the meditation room should be independent, as the tourists coming and going will have some influence.

It is highly recommended to stay for one more day, as you will gradually calm down from the shock at the beginning. Whether it‚Äôs the warmth of the room against the rocks, taking a nap in the public space at a spot designed to take in the view, or enjoying the sound of water and their delayed brunch.

Serve:
The first outstanding feeling is the service. The staff greeted us with smiles from the moment we picked up our luggage. Our luggage was quite heavy, and the aunt who helped carry our luggage cheerfully helped us carry our luggage without any complaints.


facility:
The mini bar inside the hotel is all available for free use. The air conditioning in the room is very comfortable and equipped with an electronic fireplace, which is very a**ospheric!
There is a bar in the cave, where you can make tea by the fire in the evening, and the restaurant inside is also very good.

health:
The hygiene is very clean for a B&B.

environment:
We are in a natural oxygen bar, but the location is indeed very remote, which is very demanding on the driving skills of the driver.

There was also the handsome guy Xiao Shen who patiently took us to plant rice and provided us with food in a timely manner.

This is a hotel that serves breakfast until 13:00 noon. After all, most hotels urge you to check out at 12 o'clock, but they are still providing breakfast [laughing and crying R] There are many more, some of which have designs that I like, and some of which are enthusiastic Staff, clean and stylish public area, well, this is the mountains, but it is also the paradise of dreams

msg:This was a wonderful experience. It was the first time I stayed in a five-star hotel in a cave while traveling in China. Because of the road construction, there was a section of mountain road that was difficult to drive. Fortunately, the driver was good, so I insisted on going to this cave hotel deep in the mountains to stay for one night. I arrived late, and the hotel upgraded me to a B-type room with a very good view for free. The room was spacious and comfortable, with unobstructed mountain views in front of me. It was very comfortable and beautiful. The food in the hotel restaurant is very good, the breakfast is rich in variety, there is free afternoon tea, and desserts are provided in the evening. The attitude of the waiters is very good, and the butler-style management is considerate. It is great to rest quietly in the mountains for two or three days, and read a book in a daze away from the hustle and bustle of the city!

Service: To top it off, the service staff contacted me by phone before check-in and helped to upgrade the room type for free. Someone helped move my big suitcase up and down the entire trip. The service team is young and good-looking, and the people watching are in a good mood. The health aunt is also very cute and greets us with a smile.
Health & Facilities: As for the exterior of the room, the infinity pool is stunningly beautiful, and the hotel designers and architects are awesome. As for the interior of the room, the circulation lines are well set up and all accessories are available. There are very few mosquitoes in winter, so I really don't mind.
Dinner: The little spiny mushrooms I ordered for dinner were so special! I haven‚Äôt had it anywhere else, it‚Äôs crispy and crispy. The lettuce in the boiled meat is very fragrant haha. Although the breakfast does not have as many varieties as in large hotels, it is rich enough and delicious. Emm, it has a very gentle taste? It's not like an assembly line.

Overall, I'm really satisfied. It's much happier than other similarly priced hotels I've stayed in in the city. It's a very special experience! I have already recommended Amway to my relatives and friends to try it.

Transportation - We are driving from Zunyi to Chengdu. The hotel is right next to the Chengdu-Zun Expressway. It takes more than ten minutes to get there after getting off the expressway. The transportation is very convenient.
Service - We added the butler's WeChat account in advance, and the butler will send us the location and some information about the hotel, and will also send us the QR code for ordering food on the same day. During my stay at the hotel, if I had any questions, I asked the housekeeper immediately, and the housekeeper solved them immediately.
Meal-dinner is quite amazing, it is recommended that you eat it in the hotel. Although the breakfast is not large in scale, it is well-equipped. Especially the red beef noodles, you must try them. In the afternoon when we arrived, the hotel also gave us free afternoon tea. We sat by the pool and had afternoon tea, which was so comfortable.
Room - We booked the Zhuxuan room type, which is not under the rock, but in another small white building. Although I booked this place because of the price, I actually made the right decision. Because of the rain, there are two waterfalls at the cave, and the sound is still a bit loud at night. Moreover, the activities provided by the hotel are also at Bailou. During the National Day, tea and ecological bottle making are both free. In addition, the two beds in the twin room cannot be shared, so it will be a little crowded if two adults and two children live together.

Although the price is not cheap, I think the corresponding services and room facilities are very good. Not worse than international chain facilities.

msg:Because it was the off-season, the front desk helped to upgrade it to the most expensive room type. The roof is the mountain. This experience is so rare~
In addition, after checking in, there was afternoon tea and good night desserts. Unexpectedly, the desserts in the evening were quite delicious! It's not the kind of assembly line dessert, which is quite a surprise. In addition, the breakfast is quite rich, and I couldn't finish it anyway... However, the snacks and minibar in the guest room could be more refined~ The marshmallow may have been left for a long time and is a bit sticky.
What I must highlight is the normal ordering of the dishes, which may not look very cheap at first glance, but! On such a cliff, transportation costs will definitely
The price is high, so relatively speaking, I think the price is not expensive, and the portion is relatively large. My husband and I ordered more than 300 yuan for dinner at night, but we still didn't finish it. The most important thing is that the food is not confusing and the ingredients and taste are good. In any case, the food is much more cost-effective than the dishes in various luxury star hotels (a bowl of noodles can easily cost hundreds of dollars and it‚Äôs still unpalatable), so you don‚Äôt have to worry about eating here at all.
You can also order a cocktail in the evening, and the price is very reasonable. In short, compared with the cost of accommodation, the paid meals and drinks are really very normal and consumable prices.

I saw many people saying that it is inconvenient to park by car, but actually going up the mountain is not bad. There is a section of the road that is quite narrow, so it is not easy to miss a car, but it is definitely not so narrow that it is difficult to drive. The only thing is that the slope is a bit shaky, so just pay attention when driving.
There are not many parking spaces (fortunately, we are in the off-season, so it doesn't matter). The few parking spaces are on slopes, and only two or three parking spaces are on flat ground. But it's right in front of the hotel, so it's very convenient to pick up your luggage.

Hygiene: Since we are in a cave and most of the hotel is open-air, we were worried about hygiene issues. Unexpectedly, even in the off-season, there were very few people and the surroundings were relatively clean. Not to mention the room.

Environment: It is indeed a very rare design and experience. The hotel and the mountain are integrated, which is very special.

Service: The service attitude of the housekeeper and staff is very good. Whatever you ask for~

If I want to make some suggestions, I feel that the available time of the swimming pool is too short. I suggest that it can be made into a hot spring or constant temperature in the future, otherwise you can only watch it when the weather is cold. Oh, by the way, I was also surprised that although the swimming pool has probably not been used in the past few months, the water is still very clean every day, and there is not even a fallen leaf. . .

The only drawback is probably that the road up the mountain is not easy to drive. The road up and down the mountain is a single lane, which is not friendly to novice drivers.

The hotel environment is really good. I can't imagine the villagers who lived there before. We stayed in the side building. The price during the National Day was more than 2,000. The main building has more features and is more expensive.
The hardware facilities are very good. The hotel provides a lot of snacks. Fruits and drinks in the minibar are provided for free. The hotel's breakfast is also delicious and the ingredients are fresh. The food for dinner was also good. We ate at the hotel both nights. We had to book the meal time and dishes in advance. After all, it was safer to eat at the hotel in such traffic conditions. The hotel also provides complimentary afternoon tea and late-night desserts, which are really available from morning to night. It is worth mentioning that breakfast is served until 1 noon, which means that you can eat from morning to noon, and then have afternoon tea in the afternoon. seamless connection.
The air in the hotel is fresh. The only drawback is that there are relatively few activities in the hotel. The hiking activity that I was interested in was canceled due to continuous light rain. Only green plant activities are left. It is recommended to have more activities, otherwise it will be too boring.
Although the swimming pool is very beautiful, no one swims in it because it is mountain spring water. There are also bugs in the water. It is recommended to make good use of the swimming pool and change it to a warmer one.

When we go to the surrounding Bing'an Ancient Town, there will be hotel drivers who will pick us up and go for free. By the way, the fried tofu at the entrance of the ancient town is delicious! The hotel's meals have a fixed menu, and you can order different dishes if you stay for three consecutive days. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. The breakfast buffet is rich in variety, and it really feels like wandering clouds and wild cranes here. If you like to meditate, there is also a meditation room. There are many insect friends in the hotel. This time, we actually saw a stick insect as big as a palm. The child was very excited. Especially on the last day, my friend's family of four are relatively tall. Considering the room type, the waiter upgraded the room for free.

The linkage between various hotel depar**ents is also very good. No matter which functional area they are in, staff can provide timely feedback to customers' requests and are very considerate.
The hotel's breakfast time setting is very suitable for the current work and rest habits of young people, and it has achieved uniformity in the variety and quality of dishes during the breakfast period.
Weak points: The hotel is hidden in the mountains, so there are inevitably many bugs. Although the hotel has made many efforts to make up for the hidden dangers caused by bugs, it cannot completely eliminate the noise and hygiene problems caused by bugs. If you are concerned about sleep If you have extreme requirements on quality and hygiene, you must consider it carefully.

The service attitude of the people in the whole hotel is good, and the tea and fruits in the lobby are very good. In the afternoon, I ate at the hotel and ordered pork knuckle hot pot. It was light but tasty, very filling, and the price was not expensive. If you want a happy day trip, please feel free to go!

The whole area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGuizhou basically belongs to the Castel landform, while Chishui belongs to the rare and rare Danxia landform. Carpenter's House Yalu Valley is endowed with unique cave waterfall wonders, which are unique and majestic, breathtaking. I heard from the housekeeper that "Yaloo Valley" translated into Chinese means "I miss you", which shows the founder's intentions in the initial design and decoration. Every detail has been carefully considered, and the name also has many meanings.

üöòTraffic address: Navigate to Bing'an Village, Chishui City, Zunyi City, Guizhou Province. It takes 4 hours to drive from Guiyang by car. Since there are many mountain roads, it is recommended that you choose to drive by yourself.

üèïÔ∏èRecommended surrounding attractions: Danxia Waterfall, Bing'an Ancient Town, Yanziyan, Zhuhai Park, Jurassic Park

üè†Hotel service: After the reservation is successful, the store will contact you immediately. Inform traffic and matters needing attention. After arriving at the store, the butler will help with luggage, and the front desk will warmly entertain and check in quickly. The staff who meet by chance greet each other warmly. The hotel is equipped with wild hiking, led by the butler, walking in the bamboo forest and mountains, and having a close contact with nature. On-site teaching hand-made coffee, experience the coffee making process, the coffee beans are carefully selected, mellow and thick, and the taste is very smooth! Everything is fine, I was in a hurry before leaving, I lost something in the hotel, and the housekeeper also thoughtfully helped me send it back, mainly because it took 30 minutes to drive to the city to post it, thank you for the housekeeper.

‚òïÔ∏èHotel catering: The hotel provides breakfast, lunch and dinner, breakfast time 8:30-13:00, you can sleep until you wake up naturally and then enjoy a lazy breakfast. The evening meal was sumptuous and delicious. The public area is very large, with a waterfall infinity swimming pool, a cave cafe, a cave restaurant, a meditation terrace, and a glass punch-in plank walkway. Every photo is a brilliant photo. In the afternoon, you can enjoy an exquisite afternoon tea by the swimming pool. In the distance are mountains, rivers and bamboo seas, and nearby are caves and waterfalls, which is super healing.

ü•óHotel supporting facilities: Hansgrohe, Dyson hair dryer, Marshall stereo, American Serta latex mattress, Ferragamo toiletries are used for bathing. There are many snacks and fruits in the mini refrigerator in the room, which feels very considerate. The mattress is the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on. With the sound of rain from the waterfall by the window, I often fall asleep so late that I fall asleep quickly.

Every room in the Carpenter's House Yalu Valley can touch the natural rock wall, touch the texture of the rock wall with your hands, and feel the traces of thousands of years. The space and the natural cave are not violated and integrated, and every detail of the room can feel the designer's intentions. There is also a white house next to the cave in the bamboo sea. The white building is in sharp contrast with the bamboo forest. Lying on the bed, I feel that I am in the deep forest and bamboo sea, and I fall asleep with the waterfall dripping by the window. For me, who is often in the bustling city, it is undoubtedly a life-healing.

msg:Generally staying in hotels, I don't comment on them. Too much trouble. But this one needs to be reviewed.
100 points for service, great! All the staff, including cleaning, are very enthusiastic! The experience is very good! (Especially the younger sister and younger brother at the front desk and teaching paper-cutting, and the younger brother in the cafeteria)
The price is a bit expensive, but worth it. It's not the kind of Internet celebrity hotel that looks beautiful on the Internet, but it's really bad.
The environment is very distinctive, it is worth checking in!
The hardware is very good, and the food tastes good. The minibar is all free. All the details are in place. Punching in is recommended!
It is slightly flawed, and the road to the hotel is a bit narrow. It‚Äôs not bad to miss the car, the trash can in the room is a little dirty. There was a little bit of paint coming off the wall.

The hotel is also very good for taking pictures of the cliffs and natural caves surrounded by ten thousand acres of bamboo forests. Afternoon tea at the tea table in the public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is free of charge. The a**osphere is good except for the woman at the front desk when she checks out. She feels a little yin and yang. Everything else in the hotel is very good.

msg:First-class hotel, first-class service, first-class environment. But we should think of a way to go up the mountain, not everyone is a car god. Narrow roads meet, difficult to deal with. The hotel should ensure safety and control. For example, if there is a car going down the mountain, stop it at the bottom of the mountain. If there is a car going up the mountain, stop it on the mountain. Such a narrow road is dangerous, so give way. I met it in person, and I broke out in a cold sweat when I reversed the car.

msg:The environment of the hotel is great, especially the cave style. I have planted grass on the Internet for a long time, and I am not disappointed after coming here this time. The room type we booked, because it is the off-season, the staff at the front desk took the initiative to upgrade the room type for us (with rocky), so touched! Thank you so much! The boss will do business hahahahahaha. The hotel is so easy to take pictures, and the privacy is also very high. I even posted it on Moments to promote it~ The facilities are relatively new and the parking is convenient (although there are not many parking spaces). The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the bath products (although they are made by Ferragamo) üòÖ but the bottle is hard to squeeze, and the smell is not as good as that used in another hotel we stayed in Guiyang (they use Diptyque, you can consider changing it hahaha), secondly The downside is that the smell of oily smoke in the restaurant is a bit too strong in the morning, because it is a bit cold. The restaurant on the second floor is arranged, but because it is closed (with glass windows), the oily smoke from fried eggs has been stuffy here. After breakfast for a while I lost my appetite, and again, the fireplace in the room has not been fully installed, so I can't use it, but it's not a big problem. Finally, the overall service enthusiasm can be strengthened (because we went to Jianglu Yueshan the next day, as a chain brand, generally speaking, the service willingness and enthusiasm of their employees will be higher overall), but it may also be Not long after it opened, everyone still has a lot of training process and service experience that needs to be adjusted and improved slowly, understandably! Overall great! This trip to Guizhou has also become more perfect because of the beauty of the hotel! Like, like, like~

You can order exquisite afternoon tea and dinner in advance, but it is very delicious. The buffet breakfast is also very delicate. It is hard to imagine that this location can provide such quality food hardware and software. The ceiling of the domestic B&B is amazing. It was a very happy trip.
