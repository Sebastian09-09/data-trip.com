msg:We came for the hot springs and were impressed by the hospitality of the hotel. They arranged a late checkout when my friend‚Äôs flight was delayed, as well as gave us complimentary soup and fruit. The breakfast is the best hotel breakfast buffet I‚Äôve had of the three resorts I‚Äôve stayed at in Hainan. Really a wonderful experience! The clove and Janine pools are a must, as well as the cold mint pool. Hope the African and Middle East pool sections are open next time I visit to be able to try all the ‚Äúcontinents‚Äù.

Any queries we had, he was happy to help and ensure we were as comfortable as we could be. Not all the facilities were open during our stay as it was off-peak season but we made full use of the hot springs. They were fabulous! The resort is about 30 minutes away from Holiday Beach in a taxi. I would recommend Mission Hills to others but perhaps visit during March - October when everything is open and the weather is more predictable. I would stay there again üòÉ

msg:Facilities: Although the decoration is a bit old, it is definitely luxurious and fully meets the use. The main consideration for staying in Hainan Hotel is the appropriate temperature. The temperature of this hotel is very comfortable.
Hygiene: The sanitary conditions are OK, and there is nothing unsatisfactory. Because it rained for several days, there were some leaves in the outdoor water park, but it is indeed difficult to avoid and does not affect the play.
Environment: The outdoor environment is elegant, and the overall quiet and comfortable. The hot spring area is green, the interior of the hotel is refreshing, and the room is large and soundproof.
Service: Beth, the hotel manager on duty that day, was very enthusiastic. The child's clothes were forgotten on the sofa in the lobby. After contacting, they were quickly found at the lost and found office. Other staff were also very enthusiastic. Because I stayed for two days, the room was sent with Qingbuliang and sour plum soup, and the child was very happy! There are many types of breakfast, and the restaurant service staff will enthusiastically and proactively recommend novel and delicious ways of eating, and the child is very happy.
The first hotel I stayed in during this Hainan trip is also the most satisfactory playable hotel. The children had fun. It is more comfortable than the big pit Weixs hyped in Lingshui and will not step on the pit. If you want to go out, you can drive 20 minutes to Wuyue. I really recommend it! (The hotel did not ask for reviews, but such a good hotel is worth recommending)

There was a heavy rain in Haikou one day, and we soaked in this semi-open hot spring pool in our own yard, which was very comfortable. The service of the villa's housekeeper Sun Ting was also very good. The content of our set meal was explained very clearly. Feng Xiaogang's Nanyang style performance was arranged by her, and we were lucky to watch it during the rain. It was very considerate! The cleaning girl, named Wang Ping (sorry I can't remember clearly üòÖ), cleaned the room every day very carefully. We stayed for four days, and every day we went home, it was very clean and there was a fragrance. The service of all the staff was very enthusiastic and in place. We were reluctant to leave.

msg:I rarely comment, but I'll comment because I'm so satisfied. I booked it temporarily, and it was a pleasant surprise. I was very satisfied. I didn't want to play in the hot springs, but I heard there were more than a hundred pools? I soaked for more than an hour, and only soaked in the Asian and Oceania areas. It is the best hot spring I have ever soaked in. The next day, my son played in the water park for two or three hours and was still not satisfied. The best thing is the hotel service. At night, the waiter knocked on the wrong room door, but I didn't care. He even called twice to apologize and gave me tickets to the nearby underwater world. The breakfast on the second day was also very rich. The focus should be on praising the guy who made waffles. Sorry, I forgot his name. It seems to be Liang? A slightly fat guy of medium height took the initiative to ask if there were any children with him, and made a special version of waffles for him. My son was also very happy. He also named this hotel the Waffle Hotel. In short, the hardware and software are satisfactory, and the price is not expensive. We booked a parent-child room with two 1.3-meter beds and a bunk bed. The day before May Day was more than 800 yuan, and if you live in a double room, it is less than 600 yuan. The only downside is that the bottom of the wardrobe door is metal, and my son scratched his foot when he opened it. In short, I highly recommend it and will stay here again next time I come to Haikou.

I left everything to the hotel for one stay and two meals. I was upgraded to the 11th floor for free. Standing on the balcony, my eyes were filled with greenery and I felt refreshed. The room was quite big but the details were still old and the bedding was average. A fruit plate was provided when I checked in. After I came back from dinner, I found that sugar water was also provided, which made me very happy. The seafood and meat for the buffet dinner are average, but the fruits and vegetables are fresh. Live shrimps are used in the vinegar, and the noodles and porridge for breakfast are all freshly cooked and great. I didn't try the hot springs, but after the meal I took a walk around the hotel with my husband and it was peaceful. Because the pleasure brought by staying at Mission Hills Resort Hotel brought a successful conclusion to this trip to Haikou. Goodbye Haikou!

I was very satisfied with the hotel's hygiene, the toiletries were also quite good, and the large bathtub in the room was very well received.
The dinner included in the set meal was a bit beyond my expectations, with many varieties and good taste.

The disadvantage is that it is an old hotel and the facilities are also old. The phone in the room we stayed in was broken and the desk lamp did not work. But for us No need, so I didn't go to the service desk to change. The corridor is not very soundproofed. If someone talks, it will be very clear. Fortunately, they are all on vacation. There was only one day when someone talked in the corridor, and it was quiet the rest of the time. The hotel also provides free desserts every night, which is different every few days, which is also a surprise. Guests staying at the hotel can enjoy free hot spring baths every day. There are many pools in the hotel. It is so relaxing to soak in the hot springs in the green mountains and green water! Overall, I highly recommend it.

There are many types of hot springs, some of which are too hot to soak in, but they are enough for children. The room was very spacious and had a very large bathtub. The children who had not had enough fun in the hot spring went back to the room to continue. The hotel facilities are indeed not modern enough, such as no USB interface, but they are enough. The balcony is very large. It is recommended to put a table and chairs so that people can sit on the balcony to drink tea and enjoy the air. It is a bit wasteful to have it bare. The breakfast and evening buffets are average, but ordering takeout is also very convenient. It would be better if the hotel has a small supermarket where you can buy instant noodles and snacks. In the evening, you can actually buy one get one free on the cakes in the lobby bar. Our flight was delayed and the children were hungry when we arrived, so we bought two small cakes. Desserts will be delivered by the waiter every night. I read some comments saying that when I came back from going out, I suddenly saw a thermos and a bowl in the room. It was very scary. Haha, it was indeed a bit scary. Our waiter happened to be in the room when they brought it to us, so it felt very warm. If the hotel could inform us in advance, Better.

The hotel was very responsible when they found out. From Sister Du's reception and guidance at the beginning to Miss Sun Ting who needs special thanks. She patiently listened to my appeals and helped with coordination many times. She was not impatient or procrastinating throughout the process. She was very wise and resolved conflicts intelligently. This is worth pointing outüëçThe hotel is really lucky to have such employees.

msg:The hotel is far from the city, but close to the Film and Television City and the Volcano Geopark. In particular, you can take the free shuttle bus from Mission Hills Resort to Feng Xiaogang Film Commune, which is very convenient. The complimentary hot springs, well, for the hot springs, it can only be said that there are many pools and many areas, but northerners who are used to full hot spring services may find it a bit crude. I would like to express my special thanks to Coco Zhao, the lobby manager. The service is very good. I upgraded the room for free for two days and added WeChat to answer all questions, which reflects the hotel's service quality. The Shanghai Shenhua team also stayed in this hotel for training, which shows that the hotel is not bad in all aspects. Suitable for family travel. I went to Sanya a few days later and felt that the consumption in Haikou was much lower than in Sanya.

The breakfast at the hotel is very cost-effective and the meals are rich. You can live in Mission Hills every day. Soak in hot springs, take your children to the swimming pool, and there is also a children's playground suitable for babies. It doesn't cost mom a trip. Highly recommended.

The big-brand high-end hotels I stayed in before were all very well-behaved, with a business-like, follow-by-the-book attitude. I didn‚Äôt feel too much about it, and I didn‚Äôt dare to stay there at first, but I stayed there anyway. Renaissance, because there was no room in Renaissance due to the extended vacation, I hesitated for a long time before moving in. When I arrived, the room facilities and equipment were very good, so I felt relieved. I experienced the hot springs and was a little surprised. When I returned to the room, there was Tremella fungus. The soup was waiting, and the silky and sweet sugar water captured me immediately. I was really looking forward to what kind of sugar water there would be the next day. The Hainan refreshing tonic the next night was also great. I liked these details. I will choose this place to play golf in Mission Hills in the future!

I tried changing rooms and opened the door several times at night to ventilate it.
My first stay was booked through the China Merchants Bank APP, which was 50 yuan + points cheaper than Ctrip. I stayed in the west building. There was no dehumidifier in the room at that time, and I didn‚Äôt expect it. My husband said that the quilt was damp. Fortunately, it was hot in those two days. Sleeping under a towel
The rest of the hotel is good. The buffet does not have many varieties and is of average quality. The hotel service is quite warm. It has been humid these two days and I was given a dehumidifying soup.
There are many hot springs. You must go there.

It feels much better coming from Wenchang. The service and quality of hotels at similar prices have improved a lot.

I gave up the Ritz-Carlton for hot springs and water parks and chose his home. It turned out to be right! There are more than 10 hot springs to choose from, ranging from 10 to 30 to 40 degrees, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about children not being able to enjoy them.
The indoor swimming pool has a children's pool with a suitable water temperature.
The water park is cleaned every morning, and special staff are there to remind people of safety.

The buffet is 288/person, and the a**osphere is full of live music (there are a lot of mosquitoes, and I still got three bites even after spraying anti-mosquito water).
There is a bus to the duty-free shop every half an hour, and the duty-free activity is very strong! If you need to buy beauty products and Apple products, please don‚Äôt miss it!

If the other hotels above have similar services, then there are two things that touched me uniquely about this hotel:
One is the late night dessert soup. No southerner can refuse sweet soup, okay? After soaking in the soup and playing with water, I came back to the room and saw the thermos bottle as a gift. I was so happy. The sweet soup is different every few days I stay. In addition, we had a buffet that day, and there was also sweet soup. I thought they cooked a large portion for the buffet, and some were given to each room. Unexpectedly, the three kinds of sweet soup provided in the buffet were different!
The second is cleaning service. The cleaning lady helped put away the clothes on the balcony, folded the clothes in the room, and even took care of my braces! Seeing that we had finished drinking and only had one bottle left, we refilled several more bottles and kept them. He is very able to consider needs from the customer's perspective. Big thumbs up!

The hardware of the hotel, including the rooms and parent-child facilities (water park and hot spring), are very good, and the sanitation is not bad. But service management can actually do better. When checking in, there were very few people checking in, and there were many staff at the front desk, but they felt very indifferent when dealing with the cancellation of orders that the guests didn't know. Compared with the service attitude and flexibility of the front desk staff, there is a certain gap. Maybe it is because the business is too good to worry about the source of customers. Fortunately, a male restaurant manager surnamed Wang in the hotel quickly restored my mood. I feel that Manager Wang should be one of the managers of the restaurant (I guess), with empathy, and tirelessly serving the guests. It is really good to be able to set an example for colleagues in the depar**ent in terms of initiative and service details!

msg:Overall, not bad. Room size, view is good.

There are quite a lot of people at the front desk, but the process is a little slow, and it seems that they are not familiar with it.

I went to the water park, and there are enough lifeguards. The indoor swimming pool is a little old and some facilities are broken. The equipment in the gym is not bad, but the employees' faces are a bit smelly. I didn't go to the hot spring, I thought it would be open in the morning. missed. Generally, the front desk will inform the time of some key leisure facilities, but the front desk does not.

The quality of food and drink still needs to be worked on. Although the appearance is good, the taste is really dizzy. The curry can be said to be tasteless and too watery. The cappuccino is the most outrageous, üòÇI really doubt whether it has passed the barista assessment.

msg:Mission Hills Resort Haikou is located in the Mission Hills area. When I got off the plane and took a taxi, the driver asked me why I lived in such a remote place. Indeed, if you like shopping, you should not live here. It costs 40 yuan to take a taxi to the city, but it is worth staying in a hotel.
Let me talk about the good places first:
1. Good hygiene. After coming out of the hot spring, I saw that the cleaning staff was using a special small duster to dust the railings of the outdoor veranda from gap to gap. It was really meticulous.
2. The breakfast is okay, it has everything you need, and the dining environment is also good, cool enough.
3. Parent-child facilities are complete. The water amu*****t is very good, suitable for children to play, and the wave pool is great, everyone screams happily. The hot spring is very large and the pool is comfortable. The indoor children's playground is a bit hot, but the children like the big slide.
4. The hotel is beautiful. The room is big enough to live comfortably.
After staying for two nights, I also got sweet soup, which is very heartwarming.
Say bad, or suggest it. The personnel service should be strengthened. On the whole, the service staff are all expressionless, even if you meet his eyes, they will ignore you as you walk by. . . One out of ten who nodded and said hello. It's not that I need your greeting, but the whole is cold and expressionless, and I don't feel at home as a guest. I think the hotel has so many facilities suitable for parents and children. It should be because they want to be parents and children, so it is not suitable for taking the cold route. Please be kind!
There are also a few more doormen. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because there are people who order dishes or there are not enough people. Three cars come at the same time. Only one guest can enjoy the service of helping to push luggage into the lobby. Check out and leave the lobby , I saw you at the door and wouldn't take the initiative to help you send the suitcase to the car, so I didn't see it? ? ?
Overall, the hotel is a good place to stay. The food is good. The service is responsive to the needs. The response is very fast. I can feel that the hotel has a lot of requirements and the execution is very good. But there is a kind of work that can be understood by the workers. But I don't want to give the job a good face. But we are in the service industry, and we deal directly with customers. It feels really bad to meet customers like me who don't say they are uncomfortable.

2 There is a very large hot spring center in the hotel, but in order to save costs, it is only partially open.
3 The water playground is very large, but it also makes it difficult to clean. Some areas are flooded with algae. It is hoped that cleaning will be strengthened.
4 Buffet dinner in the garden with a professional band playing, very good!
5 Maybe it‚Äôs because of the large passenger flow. In the hotel‚Äôs buffet dinner and breakfast, many dishes are too late to be updated or need to be queued up to pick up meals. This greatly affects the guest experience. This is the biggest flaw and I hope to improve it.

I stayed in a spa villa for the first three days. The room has its own hot spring soup pool. It was already ten o'clock in the evening when I checked in. The 24-hour butler service still came to help disinfect the pool and drain the water. She was very patient and thoughtful. There is an electric car shuttle from the villa to the hotel lobby, which is very convenient, and the children find it very novel and interesting. Desserts such as refreshment and cooling are provided every day, which is great! The environment of the villa is very good. I live on the first floor with a small yard. When I get up in the morning, I can see little squirrels jumping around on the palm trees outside. It's very interesting.
On the fourth day, I stayed in a family room with bunk beds and a big bed, and the room was spacious and bright.
The buffet breakfast has both Chinese and Western dim sum, which is very rich, praise!

msg:The environmental sanitation and service are good. The reason for the low score of the facilities is that the stool at the end of the bed fell down and crushed the children's feet. It really scared us to death. The stool is very heavy. Fortunately, there is a thick layer of sponge on the top. Fortunately, it is not serious. I called the hotel to deal with it. After the colleague from the housekeeping depar**ent came and asked them to remove the stool, she was still hesitating to call. I was really angry. Should I stay there and wait for another accident? Later, Ms. Du, the front desk manager, helped to change to the children's room and removed the bed end stool, which was handled promptly and quickly.
The hotel has a good view, the same golf view as the Renaissance Hotel next door. The hotel's swimming pool is very large, and it should be fun to take the baby there. It's a pity that it rained heavily after checking in and I didn't have time to take the children there to play, and I left the store early the next day and didn't have time to play.
It is close to the airport, and there is a children's paradise swimming pool. It is actually suitable for families with children, but I hope the hotel can check the safety hazards of the room, and the same is true for the children's room. It is best to book a children's room with infants and young children

The service lady at the front desk checked in very quickly and took the initiative to help the guests with their luggage and guide them to familiarize themselves with the environment. The concierge quickly helped guests send their luggage to the room. The rooms are large, comfortable and clean. The cleaning staff is very polite, and the cleaning supplies are provided in a timely manner. The impressive variety of fruits and evening drinks are delicious. The super hot spring valley has all kinds of hot spring pools that can't be soaked in, each with its own characteristics. The water quality and service are impeccable, which makes people happy physically and mentally. The hotel's breakfast is also super good. There are many varieties that greatly satisfy the appetite. The buffet in the evening is even more satisfying. In particular, I would like to thank Sun Ting, the service staff at the front desk of the hotel, who really answered every question and responded to our requests, and solved many practical problems for us. The four days were very short, and the feeling of home was very warm. Next time you come to Haikou, Mission Hills Resort Hotel must be the first choice!

msg:Continue to stay and try the parent-child room. The result was worse than the deluxe big bed room where I stayed for two consecutive days.

Facilities: There are spiders in the bath towels, I don't know if it has been unoccupied for a long time. There are only wooden hangers on the balcony and the height is not enough. The rain head in the shower was broken. The plastic slippers were dirty. The kettle will not boil and automatically cut off the power. Many power outlets were not working.

Service: I found that the safe was not working well, and a supervisor came late to check the situation, but was informed that there was a failure due to a lack of power, and he left. Another person came to change the battery, and found that the supervisor had closed the door of the cabinet by mistake. When I called again, the supervisor said he was having lunch and couldn't go. They also said that they had a room card and let us go out by ourselves, but when we went to the hot spring for an hour, we just took a shower when we came back, and tried to enter without knocking on the door by swiping the card, but was stuck by the anti-theft chain. It can be seen that there is a lack of understanding of some things, poor communication, making guests wait, and eating by yourself is more important.

Hygiene: Because I checked out and changed rooms, I checked in at 10 am. As a result, the cleaning staff swiped their card to enter without authorization. Fortunately, there was a chain buckle. Didn't even know there were already guests staying.

Environment: Facing south this time, you can see the swimming pool in the water park and the sunrise.

When checking out, the girls at the front desk were very good. After watching the program of Nanyang Past, the shuttle bus is still very punctual, otherwise the moon is dark and the wind is high, it is still very scary.

The hotel is also relatively old, but the service is acceptable, and the delivery is very fast if you want something, and there are desserts delivered every day. It feels like people who come here are golfers or with babies.

msg:It is the most comfortable season in Hainan Island. We packed our golf bags and drove for seven and a half hours to arrive at the Mission Hills Golf Club in Haikou. I found an excellent resort, and it was a pleasure to stay at the ball club. Xiaohan Heidi, who received us, was professional and considerate during our whole week. We can patiently answer and solve any questions at any time, although the ball club has not been marked. I wonder if there will be an exclusive butler service, but Xiaohan can be called excellent and professional. We are very satisfied with this kind of vacation experience, and I believe that we will choose to come several times a year in the futureüëçüòâ

msg:Once again came to Haikou to stay at Mission Hills! It seems that every winter was spent here before the epidemic! Whether it's playing golf or soaking in hot springs, the elderly and children can find fun! The golf course is not generally praised. Walking around the course can really cure depression. That eyeful of green is so healing. The volcanic hot spring is very distinctive, there are many pools, so people will not be crowded. The best thing about B1 downstairs is the Japanese restaurant, where udon noodles and grilled salmon head are extremely delicious. The breakfast buffet is also very rich and the dishes are fresh.
The hotel's various facilities are very complete. The shuttle bus runs every half an hour. It is very convenient to go to Mission Hills New Town to eat, go shopping, and go to the movie commune. Huang Yuqiao, the staff member I encountered at the front desk, provided a very good service! Not only efficient, but also very careful! I took the initiative to arrange the room to deliver the luggage. Seeing that I was bringing a child, I kindly introduced that we can go to the Teddy Bear Museum and other interesting places. This is the best service in my opinion. I really feel at home, and I feel that the needs of every guest have been taken care of!
Come on Mission Hills Resort Hotel, I will come back to see you every year!

The service was very good. The last time we came was during the eleventh period, and there were probably more people during the holidays. At that time, the front desk staff in the main building I didn't have the patience in the annex this time, and the luxurious queen bed I booked was upgraded to a spa room. Downstairs is the corridor leading to the club. Although there is no view, it is very quiet. The room is very large and well ventilated. The children like it very much This bathtub, because you can watch TV while taking a bath. The day I went was a working day and the temperature dropped to about 25¬∞C. No one was playing in the water park. The children played for a while and felt the fun of the reserved venue. There are not many people in the hot spring, and the check-out was delayed until 2 o'clock the next day, so I went to experience the hot spring again at 1 o'clock, and just saw that some pools were changing the water, which increased the favorability. After a while, the water park will not be able to play, but you can take a hot spring and will go again when you have time.
Service: Intimate, there are welcome fruits and good night desserts, there are not many people on weekdays, and you don't have to wait too long to respond to your needs. There is a shuttle bus to the hot spring and water park from the annex building.
Hygiene: The hygiene condition is very good. After we checked in, a staff member came to ask if we had any comments and needs on hygiene and facilities, and they were very attentive.

Maybe because the room was changed, the welcome fruit has not been delivered, indicating that the hotel communication is chaotic. I called and transferred three people and waited for a few minutes. In the end, no one spoke. I contacted Ctrip to solve it. I went to a friend's room as a guest, and found that they also sent white fungus porridge, and I felt very bad in an instant.

I have stayed in many hotels, but I have never been willing to praise a hotel or a hotel staff from the bottom of my heart. This time, because of the epidemic, I was forced to stay, and the warmth of Mission Hills Hotel really touched me. First of all, because the hotel was requisitioned as a quarantine hotel in the middle, the hotel did not rudely clear us stranded guests, but let us choose whether to relocate to the villa area. Even if there are two or three households left, they still prepare a hearty breakfast for us.
I would like to thank Wu Yinyu, the restaurant manager, and Wu Yufang, the cleaning depar**ent of the villa area, for welcoming Ayu's warm and attentive smile and greetings and meticulous service in the breakfast room every day. Wu Yufang from the cleaning depar**ent saw our family of three and guessed that one of us must sleep on the sofa. Before we asked, she took the initiative to hug a few more quilts, transformed the sofa into a bed, and comforted us with her bright smile every day: It's dangerous outside. If you can't go back, just stay with auntie, and auntie will take care of you. The simple words are definitely not from official training, but her true words from the heart, which melt your heart instantly. The people of Hainan are really simple, kind and enthusiastic.
Thank you Mission Hills Resort and our lovely and kind Hainanese people. From now on, going back to Mission Hills Hotel is going to be home.

Lobby decoration - 0.2 points; this is the first time I have seen a five-star hotel lobby so dark!
Breakfast restaurant - 0.3 points; old facilities and poor service awareness of service staff, because we continued to sit and eat breakfast and chat after we went to dinner, the waiter actually said that they were going to get off work and drove us away!
Room - 1 point; facilities are old
The swimming pool is passable, and many swimming equipment are free
Hot spring +1 point; although many pools are not open but the scale is relatively large

A classmate in the lobby who seems to be called Coco suggested to take a look at the room upstairs. If you are satisfied, you can upgrade the room. After reading it, I decided to continue to stay. I would like to thank this classmate for his kindness. At that time, the whole family was very tired after getting off the plane, and finally settled down to rest. The overall facilities of the hotel are ok, the golf landscape outside the balcony is excellent, and there is a small volcano-themed water world. I especially need to praise the Chinese restaurant. The ingredients are fresh, the price is fair, and the chef's skills are also very good. It is very satisfying to eat in the Chinese restaurant every day. Will recommend friends to stay, 3Q

I found the Mission Hills Hotel here. I wanted to stay for two days, but I fell in love with it all at once. Every staff member is very kind and not overly enthusiastic, but it makes people feel very warm. The housekeeper Lilian is very caring. Was resolved promptly and also reminded us what else was in our order
The room is very clean. It belongs to the kind of Chinese elegance. The hot spring pool of the villa is also very large. It has become a must-do item for the father to take a dip every day.
Tonight, the whole family decided to stay here after discussing it, because not only the children didn't want to leave, but we also didn't have enough.
I hope the hotel can keep it up and keep everything it is now. Come on!

However, in late January and early February, Haikou was so cold that it was impossible to play in room temperature water. Volcano pools are not open. Hot springs big and small can't play with water springs, it's too cold. What a misstep. Children can't soak in hot hot springs, and feel that more than 1,000 a night in winter is not worth it. In winter, it is only suitable for golfers to play here, and others should choose carefully. Tucao about the TV, it's slow and small, and now the B&Bs are all millets over 55 inches, okay? Star hotels cannot be upgraded. If you want to take a hot spring, the volcano hot spring can be spent alone. The indoor heated pool is pitifully small.

Hot springs: divided into four areas (the most pools in Asia, the children in Africa play, but it is far away, you need to walk 500 meters to get there) Now many pools are under maintenance, most of the pools are not running water, so I don‚Äôt know whether the water in the pools is every day. replace.
Serve:
The best service is the little girl over there at the hot spring pool. She introduced various areas enthusiastically and had a very good attitude. When we checked out, a porter heard that we were going to the airport and took the initiative to help us take our luggage and put it in the car.
Other than that, the whole hotel service is average.
1. When I first checked into the hotel, the front desk did not introduce any information about the hotel. Many people did not know the location of the breakfast and the hot spring, including the time. Later, I went to the front desk to learn about the hotel. A service staff standing outside the front desk did not smile and spoke coldly and impatiently.
2. After soaking in the hot spring, the bathrobes on my body were soaked. The hot spring staff told them that they could leave it there. I went back to the room and asked the room attendant for a new one. The waiter also accused me of not taking it back to the room.
The service is still far from the hotel in Sanya.
Breakfast: It seems that there are many varieties, but there are few choices. There is nothing to eat. It is the same every day and the taste is average.
Personal advice: Families with children, do not choose this one if you don't go out to play golf this season. There is nothing to do in the hotel. Also take a dip in the hot springs. As for the other recreational facilities are not open.

Manager Wang Bifei used professional services to make our party happy and satisfied. My father happily wrote poems to express his joy, thank you!

Although I have been to Hainan Island for six years and stopped in Haikou several times, the hotel is magnificent, with beautiful environment and considerate service, which is amazing. The room is huge, with a 2-meter king-size bed, the house is still very spacious, and the refrigerator, color TV, safe, and giant bathtub are all available. Standing on the large balcony, the rippling blue water world and the rosy coconut green add radiance and beauty to each other. Leaning on the railing, you can see the golf course with green grass and green grass. It has the characteristics of five continents. The movie commune makes people travel through time and space as if they were separated from each other... In addition to the complete hardware equipment and the outstanding environment, what is more commendable is the software service. The staff are enthusiastic, proactive and attentive, especially the beautiful and quiet lobby manager Huang Yujia, who is enthusiastic and active, asking for warmth. Seeing our group of 70-year-olds and 3-year-old children, they took the initiative to contact us to park nearby. In order to reduce the difficulty of our burden, Contact the concierge to deliver luggage to the house, give a bottle of water, a welcome fruit plate at the door, pineapple tremella soup and Sydney tremella soup for two nights, introduce the outing route, take care of the little granddaughter to take a nap to extend the check-out time, and care about the safety of the journey when leaving the store... ..., many, many, and so on. It makes travelers in unfamiliar environments feel at home; and allows travelers who are alone in a foreign land to return to the embrace of a warm harbor. Manager Huang and other staff's dedicated service awareness and active help are not only a manifestation of their professional ethics, but also a tribute to the reputation of the hotel, which makes us unforgettable praise for Mission Hills Resort Haikou. The stars are moving, and the command room is the best choice for us to revisit Haikou again.

2. Room: very large and spacious, the bathtub is the biggest I have ever seen. The decoration of the room is a bit old, but overall it's okay.
3. Service: very user-friendly, knowing that if you leave the shop at 5:30 the next day to catch the flight, it was Merry and beth who proactively delayed the check-out time. The room also gave Hainan refreshing tonic at night, but it was a pity that I ate too much at night and didn‚Äôt finish it. Asking the aunt to give a few more bottles of water and bath towels will be processed soon. Very satisfied. But the time for pick-up and drop-off is too short, which is almost equivalent to invalid service. Fortunately, taxis are not expensive, only 20km.
4. Supporting facilities: There are volcanic rock hot springs, which are the largest I have ever seen. They are divided into many small pools according to the style of the five continents. They are open until 23 o'clock in the evening, which is good for sleeping after taking a bath.
5. Restaurant: Although the breakfast and dinner barbecues are not as high as the advertised expectations, the barbecues are only a little bit, but the overall level is considered a normal five-star hotel.

It is attracted by the pictures of the hot spring facilities in Mission Hills Resort Haikou and has a score of 4.8, which is considered a very high score among the large resorts in the country.
The hot spring is better than I expected. Even during the Mid-Autumn Festival, the occupancy rate is very high. It doesn't feel crowded. There are no uncomfortable dirty corners, disposable paper cups thrown around, and large towels forever.
There are 168 hot spring pools that can last for a few days. They are divided into several continent themes, and the design and environment are very good. You can always find a lot of pools that you want to bathe in and there are no one else.

The butler Mary serves very well and is enthusiastic and proactive.

I think it's better to take a one-hour flight to Haikou in winter to soak in a hot spring hotel in a crowded Cantonese hot spring hotel.

      It is recommended to play often, it is very good value. If there is a special golf introductory class or knowledge class in the off-season, the common people can't afford it, but understand that you can still pay for one or two classes. It is just a suggestion, children We can also have more knowledge!

Outdoor water parks are not allowed, and hot springs are not allowed. Basically, they are indoors. When checking out with a frustrated mood, it was Xiao Qiao, the lobby manager, who gave us a touch of warmth. After learning about the situation, she promised to make up for the water park and hot spring that she didn't play. The next time she went to play, it was really humane. Although I don't know when I will have time to go, I am very happy. I don't think it was in vain, and the money was not in vain. Say happily. üíõ

In terms of service, there are a few points to complain about. I took a battery car on the first day of the new year, because it rained in Haikou on the first day of the new year, the seat was wet, and the cold water soaked my pants. On the first day of check-in, I gave Guiling paste, and asked the housekeeping depar**ent the next night, saying that our room did not have this gift, and the attitude was not very good.
On the whole, the hotel environment and facilities give us a very good feeling. The children are very satisfied. Let‚Äôs not hide the shortcomings. The main goal has been achieved, and some minor deficiencies are still tolerable.

msg:Two times I stayed at Mission Hills Resort Hotel, I was dissatisfied: the first time I checked in, I provided the invoice information on the night of check-in and asked the front desk to help to issue it. However, I asked the front desk many times the next day and could not find my invoice. The last thing is to leave contact information to be sent to the work unit. This is not a flaw, and it does not leave a fatal negative impression. The second time I stayed, I took out a pair of extremely dirty shoes from the well-packaged disposable slippers in the closet of the room, and my hands were dirty. After calling No. 0 on the spot, the room service delivered two pairs of new shoes. The customer service staff called three times successively, each time trying to find reasons, either blaming the previous guest for pretending that the used slippers were not used, or blaming the room director for not being serious about the ward rounds, not a single time with a sincere apology , then can I understand that when the previous guest uses the cup and wipes it dry, the guest room will default to unused and will not be replaced? As a star-rated hotel in a resort, it is extremely inappropriate for guests to worry about the hygiene of the hotel! The last time I called me, I made it clear that I would describe what I experienced in the comments. Although the hotel is not worried about the occupancy rate during the golf season, I hope that the guests who choose to stay in the hotel will know it, and I hope that the hotel room will sincerely reflect on the omissions in management. , and think about how to truly provide guests with a comfortable and reassuring stay experience!

Another thing worth mentioning is the service.

There is also a children‚Äôs art gallery. There is no one at noon and no pottery is made. It is more suitable for small children. The environment is a bit boring.

After I told me that the next day‚Äôs flight was ten o‚Äôclock in the evening, I wanted to delay the check-out, but after the coordination was notified, we delayed the check-out until six o‚Äôclock in the afternoon for free , I am really moved, this kind of service attitude is already lacking in too many hotels, this hotel is really highly recommended.
At night, we went out to play, and when we came back, we found that the turndown was also opened, the fruit was delivered, and the white fungus soup was delivered. The service was really super five-star. The stay was too comfortable, and I will come to stay for a few more days next time.

msg:A super satisfied hotel. On the first day, due to the weather, the plane was delayed for 8 hours and did not check into the hotel until almost 9 in the evening. But fortunately, I met Xiao Qiao, the lobby manager, who was very sweet. She took the initiative to give me her contact information on the same day and helped me arrange everything properly. The welcome fruit was arranged on the first night, and the second night was refreshing and refreshing, packed in a thermos. I was really moved. I also met a young lady at the hot spring service counter and gave me a bag of yellow skins I picked. Also, breakfast is also delicious. By the way, the big bed is super big and comfortable. It is the biggest one I have stayed in so many hotels. In short, a hotel full of good memories for me. I will definitely choose this one next time I go to Haikou.

First of all, the beauty Anna, who is in charge of the pick-up, contacted in advance to inform the pick-up location. She waited patiently at Gate 2 on rainy days. Thank you very much. When I came to the hotel, the beauty in charge, Mary, also provided a lot of caring services, presented mung bean soup and fruit, delayed check-out, and helped with luggage. I like it a lot üëç! The hotel‚Äôs own children‚Äôs playground and hot springs are also very fun, and children are happy to play.

When I checked in yesterday, because I took three large suitcases, I parked my car at the gate of the hotel (not blocking the road, and many cars were parked there) for about 30 minutes. As a result, I received a traffic police violation. Parking phone. Does your hotel still have the habit of reporting hotel guests? On and off the bus during my stay, no concierge ever moved the boxes for me. But the lady at the front desk is very nice.
