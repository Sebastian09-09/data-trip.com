As soon as I entered the hotel, a concierge took my luggage, which made me feel embarrassed. The room is also very good, with fruits sent by the hotel. The room is also very clean and tidy. The girl at the front desk also gave me souvenirs. There is also a calligraphy area. The overall feeling is great! I will continue to book this hotel next time I come!

msg:I came to Chengdu Tianfu International Conference Center for a meeting. The hotel is relatively close to the venue. Many surrounding hotels are full. It is about 2 kilometers away and a 20-minute walk. The hotel is right at the subway entrance. It is convenient to get to and from the venue.
In terms of hardware, the hotel facilities are relatively new. It seems to have been newly opened at the end of last year. The room area is large enough. The introduction said more than 30, but it actually feels more than 40. The bedding is also relatively comfortable to sleep on. In particular, the hotel staff contacted me in advance and asked if there was anything else they needed assistance with. They also sent us some Chengdu guides (although I am more familiar with Chengdu) and gave us welcome fruits. I learned that I didn't go out to eat one night due to work reasons during my stay. The girl at the front desk specially arranged a set meal for one person, which was quick and solved my dining problem that night. Thank you very much.
There are quite a lot of people at breakfast, mainly for companies having meetings. The taste is not bad. If you come to Tianfu Conference Center for a meeting, it is recommended to stay here.
There is construction in the surrounding area, but it does not affect your sleep at night. Parking is easy. (There was some minor incident in the room at night, but it was resolved quickly)
(The mouse was broken, so I asked the front desk to borrow one, and finally gave me my own personal mouse; I would like to thank you here)
The biggest feeling: no matter the young man pulling the luggage, the sister at the front desk, or the elder sister delivering fruits, the service is very enthusiastic, the service is very enthusiastic, the service is very enthusiastic.

When we left, because we had a lot of things with us, the porter also helped us to the subway. It's very convenient to go from the hotel to the subway. It's just that the guide signs may need to be made a little more. Everything else is good! Like it 👍

Moreover, as a newly opened hotel, it is clean and tidy, the service staff is very enthusiastic, and the luggage delivery, storage and consultation services are all great. The guest room also provides free desserts in the evening. In short, I will choose it again next time I go on a business trip!

If you stay here on New Year's Eve, you may be able to see a drone show. There is a subway downstairs, and both Shuangliu Tianfu Airports can be reached directly, which is very convenient. The hotel facilities are perfect, and the staff are very enthusiastic, the kind of enthusiasm that is sincere, manual praise 😀
