msg:I was there just one night on a business trip. I interacted with around 5 staff, everybody spoke zero English. I didn't expect anybody to speak fluent English. But just for simple communications or word-by-word responses - that would be ok enough. Like, I can't ask what floor I am on. (as the room number won't indicate where you are), what time does the breakfast start, and where is the breakfast? The internet can also only connect with the Chinese cellphone number and NO OTHER NATIONALITIES CELL PHONE can be used. It is ridiculous, as it is a well-known (super) expensive international brand. By having non-speaking English staff who can only use Chinese cell phones to register for the internet - it is clear that this property doesn't welcome foreigners at all. So if you don't speak Chinese and don't have a Chinese cell number - you better don't stay there - period.

The hotel is very clean and the rooms are well maintained. The staff is even more enthusiastic, especially the housekeeper Sun Ling Candy, who is kind and sweet and very meticulous in her work. She brought the children their favorite candies and took the initiative to ask about our needs every morning and evening. The hotel also updated a naughty castle for the babies staying there to play for free. Not only are there staff to maintain order, but they also use vacuum cleaners to clean the floor all the time. We are also very satisfied with the restaurant, guest rooms and luggage services. The aunt in the guest room took the initiative to make a small bed for the children. The children like the hotel's naughty castle, hot springs and table tennis very much. They picked up a lot of shells and shrimps on the beach and spent a pleasant holiday in Suka.

Thumbs up for the service of Suka Hotel, and give a warm hug to the big bossü§óOriginally, I booked a three-day stay, but Friday and Saturday were fully booked, so I booked a hotel next door for the first two days. To be honest, there is really no harm without comparison, so I will ignore the shortcomings of the other hotel here!
Finally, I would like to express my special thanks to two staff members of Suka Hotel, one is Wang Huisong and the other is Wang Ruijie. I lost my hat when I was taking photos on the street in Ideal City. After calling the community service center to confirm that no lost items were reported, I contacted the hotel Suka where I stayed. The hotel arranged Wang Ruijie to go to the monitoring room to find information without delay. Her mobile phone ran out of power and she waited for me in the monitoring room for two hours. When I returned to the hotel, the front desk guy immediately arranged for Wang Huisong to drive the tour bus to the monitoring room. He asked and searched all the way. The monitoring room was on the negative floor of a building. Even though the navigation was not working, Wang Huisong successfully took me to the monitoring room and found the lost hat in five minutes. I was very moved by the joy of regaining the lost hat. The service of Suka Hotel can take care of the warmth in every detail of every customer's needs, which is really reassuring. This trip also ended with Suka Hotel from beginning to end! It was perfect and sweet. Thank you for your efforts. I believe that under the leadership of such management and the meticulousness of the employees, the hotel will surely prosper and prosper!

It is by the sea, you can see the sea from the room, and you can reach the beach by going downstairs. There is a gym on the first floor, hot spring SPA, and indoor playground for dolls, which are all there for small and big babies. It's really great. Almost all your needs are taken into consideration, and the service is even better. From the moment I entered the hotel, every staff member greeted me with a smile. When I checked in, Miss Sun Ling from the hotel guest relations added me as a WeChat friend. She always gave warm reminders and understood our family's needs in a timely manner. There was a little episode when we took the shuttle bus in the rainy evening. As a result, we had dinner and returned to the hotel. The lobby manager was waiting for us at the hotel gate and kept apologizing to us. The experience was really full at this moment. Milk and fruit were delivered to the room later. Miss Sun Ling knew about it, and also asked the room service to deliver milk. Six cups were delivered in one night, which I couldn't finish. I was really satisfied, and I will come again next time

The child was very happy to soak in the hot spring at night, but it was really hard to hold her back. üòÇ Because the room was not cleaned, it was a bit overtime to check in.

Two major categories of Chinese and Western meals, cold dishes, hot dishes, noodles, buns, fried rice and various beverages and coffees are all available. It is really pleasant to pick up delicious food and sit at the table facing the sea and chew slowly while watching the sea.

The breakfast is a surprise, with a rich variety of roughly hundreds of varieties, and the taste is also very good. There are even pancakes, which the baby is very happy to eat üòÉ. The hotel service is great. From check-in to check-out, there are follow-up guests' experience and call back; any needs will be solved by the front desk, üëç and even borrowed a computer to handle urgent matters. It would be even better if the computer is equipped with a mouse! The shuttle bus responds very quickly, and it can arrive in as little as 20 minutes. I live on the 8th floor of Building C. There is a hot spring downstairs. After soaking, I put on a bathrobe and went upstairs. The floor does have some signs of use. The staff reported that the plan is to upgrade. I hope the price and service will be the same as before‚õΩÔ∏èI will come again!

msg:I booked Suka when I came to Aranya for the first time, and it turned out to be a wise decision. Suka is the only hotel facing the sea in the park and the only high-rise building facing the sea, so the view is definitely the best in the park. I haven't experienced clubmed, but the service of Suka staff is already excellent. They are enthusiastic and serious, and they provide various thoughtful services and inquiry feedback. They noticed that we were caught in the rain outside and sent milk and ginger tea. The buffet restaurant has a good environment and rich variety. It is more convenient and comfortable to choose here for dining with many people than the surrounding small restaurants. The decoration in the room is simpler but quiet, bright, clean and comfortable. Two suggestions: First, if the air conditioner in the room is not cooling in May, you should actively inform and arrange a thin quilt instead of giving it after making suggestions. In addition, it would be perfect if the shower and bathtub can be upgraded.

It takes only 10 minutes to get to the auditorium. There is a newly opened butter bread downstairs, and the Yellow River flows into the sea. The location is really good, especially suitable for parents and children. I like it very much and recommend it.

4. I experienced the spa and it was very comfortable and healing

The room is too hot. When I was in Clubmed before, the room felt the same whether I came in spring, autumn or winter, that is, it was dry and hot. In December, the air conditioner was turned off, and it was still hot and dry when the doors and windows were opened. It is recommended that the air conditioner be set to cooling.
However, after changing to Suka, there are still surprises everywhere and improvements.

At first, I wanted to change to a room with a large balcony in the middle, but I was afraid of noise. Later, I decided that this location is very good and quiet.
Although the hotel facilities are a bit old, the quality is online.
The sea view is great and the location is unique.
The air conditioner is noiseless and very warm.
The voices of the neighbors can indeed be heard, it depends on luck. At least we slept well at night, everyone was sleeping and there was no noise.
The snacks and drinks provided by the hotel are also great.
The breakfast is rich, but the table is not cleaned quickly enough, maybe there are too many people.
In short, it is still full marks, a bit like Sanya, which is not easy in the north.

It was too late and we were too lazy to change the sheets or the room. We wanted to ask if there were disposable sheets, but the customer service replied that there were none. We could only put on my disposable toilet seat and sleep for the night. Moreover, the central air conditioning in the hotel did not have cold air at this time!!!

The windows and doors of the balcony were not closed tightly and there was a whistle sound all the time. I couldn't fall asleep at all. Secondly, Building A was being renovated, which started on time at 2 pm. The bed was shaking, and it was difficult for the children to take a nap. The good thing is that the staff has a good attitude and will actively coordinate if there are any problems. Suka's only advantage is that it is close to the sea and the sea view room.

During my stay, we received welcome snacks and drinks on the first night: The customer service was very enthusiastic. I didn‚Äôt know that there would be no free fruit since March. I asked and they delivered it to me.
Free hot spring for two: Because we traveled off-peak, there were not many people in the hot spring. The pool for children was very shallow and they had fun. Parents should remember to bring swimming rings. We went through all three supermarkets in the park and found no swimming rings. Later, we found a nearby merchant to deliver it.
Facilities: There are many children's amusement facilities, and the teachers are also very nice to take the children to do handicrafts.
Service: During my stay, Building A was being renovated. It was still very windy that day. I felt like it was drilling into my head when I stayed in the hotel. I mentioned it to the customer service Coco and Candy. I didn‚Äôt expect that they would respond immediately and send a luggage cart to help us move to the next building where there was no construction. It was quiet immediately. Thank you for the enthusiasm and thoughtfulness of the customer service of Suka Hotel.
Spa: I saw the new spa experience in Suka and made an appoin**ent directly. It was very quiet and the whole spa was very large. At the beginning of the project, an aromatherapist would select the fragrance. The spa technicians were very good and the herbal tea was delicious.
Breakfast: There is no need to say much about the buffet breakfast, which is rich and delicious. You can also take it back to the room to eat. The experience of eating breakfast while looking at the sea is perfect.
This trip to Anaya at Suka Hotel can be rated 5 stars, which is entirely for Suka's service, the convenience of the shuttle bus, and Coco and Candy.
Will come again, goodbye.

My family likes this. It is comfortable to see the sea. Disadvantages: The breakfast is not as good as Anlan. There are quite a lot of people at breakfast, so it is a bit crowded. The snacks are not as good as Anlan. But there are Wangzai juice, cola and coffee. The drinks are better than Anlan. Overall, I am very satisfied. The price is also friendly in the off-season.

The most important thing is that I am grateful to the chef who works non-stop for three hours every morning to make ramen for diners. This bowl of authentic ramen started my wonderful day...
The service staff in the restaurant can take the initiative to find seats for customers who come to dine and provide all help.
At Suka Hotel, you can not only enjoy the daily life while lying on the bed, but also experience the high-quality service that responds to every request.
Looking forward to seeing you again at Suka Hotel.

I haven't seen it in many years. It's so beautiful! I also went swimming in the evening. No one was there when I went, so the place was reserved! üòÉVery satisfied with all aspects of service
During your stay, welcome snacks and drinks are provided on the first night: good
Complimentary hot spring for two people: I didn‚Äôt go to experience it. The hot spring and the swimming pool are not together because I went swimming. It would be better if they were together! If it‚Äôs your first time here, I recommend this place as your first choice. The location is the best, closest to the seaside, and it‚Äôs very convenient to go out!

msg:As a business person with long-term business travel needs, I rarely choose resort hotels. This time I came from Tianjin for a birthday holiday. Before booking the hotel, I read everyone‚Äôs recommendations and reviews on various platforms and compared them all. Choose Suka Hotel.
First, let‚Äôs talk about the most intuitive feeling when entering the hotel. The entire hotel is divided into several buildings. The hotel lobby is on the second floor like other resort hotels. When entering the lobby, I like the scent of the lobby aromatherapy. The layout of the lobby is also good. There are seats for guests to wait. Especially the sea that comes into view makes me, a business person who finally got a rest after working for a long time, really feel that I can put down my work and relax. The concierge in the lobby was also very good and took the initiative to carry my luggage. Fortunately, I didn't have much luggage and politely refused. The lady who checked in at the front desk was also kind. After all, it was my first time here so I had many questions, but the front desk introduced me very well. Very comprehensive, and the hot drinks in the lobby welcome area taste good.
Before I arrived at the hotel, I received a reminder from the platform about vehicle registration issues and called the hotel. Later, in order to facilitate this trip, I added the hotel housekeeper‚Äôs WeChat account. I must give special praise to Ms. Mandy. She is very responsible and knows that I am here. I also arranged a birthday cake for me to celebrate my birthday during my vacation. I took photos with the wine and potato chips I bought myself as a souvenir. After I checked in, I was thoughtfully asked if I had received the cake. What surprised me the most was that in order to make my trip more successful, Ms. Mandy made a guide for me in advance, contacted me in advance to inform me of the sunrise time the next day, and told me which location in the park would be the best for taking pictures! I am very glad that I can get such considerate service when I choose Suka Hotel for the first time. This is what other business hotels lack most, and it is also the humanized and professional service that resort hotels lack. Neither my friend nor I made a guide as comprehensive as the housekeeper's, and the hotel has a hot spring pool. Unfortunately, I was in such a hurry that I didn't bring a swimsuit with me, but the housekeeper was very considerate and solved this series of problems for me, and I was very happy. I watched Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãOranges on my birthday.
Looking back on this trip to Aranya, I feel that everything beautiful is unreal. Whether it is the vast sea or the attentive butler service, I miss it very much. I am busy with work and do not have more time to experience it in the hotel. I will definitely choose Suka Hotel again next time if I have needs!
Finally, I must strongly recommend everyone. If you are planning to come to Aranya for a relaxing vacation, you must choose Suka Hotel. After all, it is difficult to find such a professional, considerate and meticulous hotel.

This time I went to stay at Suka, which has been managed by the Aranya community. I feel that the service has not been compromised. line, and it feels better than before! Before booking this time, I still contacted the butler service team from the last time: Xiao Cao, Xiaocui and Ruijie. Very quick and enthusiastic response. And they helped us solve any problems in time before check-in and during the stay at the hotel! The welcome fruits are very fresh~ There are many varieties. In the photos I saw, there are few strawberries that have been eaten by the children~ There are also snacks and free drinks in the refrigerator! Here I would like to express my special thanks to Aunt Lu Jianxia, ‚Äã‚Äãthe room service on the 9th floor! Every time we meet, she greets us in a very warm and friendly manner! Ask if you need help cleaning the guest room or provide other assistance ~ here you can deeply feel the quality of our service staff's training. Needless to say, the hotel room has a beautiful view, as the room faces the sea. I am amazed every time I enter the room! I'm lucky enough to be able to see the sunrise over the Orange Sea from my room!

I really made the right choice, you can see the sea from the balcony, but it was cloudy on the two days I went. Alas, summer will come again. Suka's service is good. If you need band-aids or anything else, they will be sent directly to the room. I gave myself a birthday trip and was very satisfied!

Aranya in summer and Aranya in winter do have different beautyüåÖplease see the picturesüëá:
First of all, I would like to express my special thanks to the hotel housekeeper for contacting me in advance and giving me a lot of advice and help. However, the day before I went, my brother got tonsillitis. After a meeting and discussion, he decided to take the illness and walk. This is just for fun. What a strong willpower you haveü§£
Let‚Äôs talk about the services and facilities: Because the child was uncomfortable and was afraid of being too cold at the beach, I confirmed with the housekeeper to raise the room temperature in advance before going. This thoughtful service was really appreciated. As soon as I entered the room, I took off several layers of clothes because of the heat. üòÇüòÇ, and the quilt is hot every night üòÇ Fortunately, there are welcome fruits every day, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about getting angry üòã In short, you don‚Äôt have to worry about the cold at the beach!
Then there is the hotel, üè®Although the name has been changed and there is no all-inclusive service from Club Med, the meals, services and facilities are still in placeüëçAlthough the outdoor beach is a little colder in the off-season, there are fewer people and it feels so good to go üòÖ You can take a shuttle bus to pick you up anywhere, which is convenient and not cold! Visited the church ‚õ™Ô∏è, went to the library üìñ, ate in the third cafeteria, ate wheat ears, ate Sugu, drank coffee ‚òïÔ∏è, ate ice cream üç¶, fed seagulls üê¶, and watched the sunrise üåÖ in the room ü´£
SO: Thumbs up for the perfect little tripüëç to Aranya Sukha Hotel‚ù§Ô∏è

    After eating and drinking, the rest is play. The location of the hotel is very good. It is right on the beach and facing the sea. It is very close to the auditorium and library. It is within walking distance and you can watch the sunrise from the balcony. So for three days and two nights, I watched the sunrise, fed the seagulls, soaked in the hot springs, swam, rock climbed, and did archery. I had a great time doing everything.
    In addition, Suka's service is really considerate. He helped make the bed for the children. Since the children needed to go to class, he helped prepare eye protection lamps. Thank you [Rose] [Rose] very much. It was my birthday on the day I came, and the hotel prepared a birthday cake, which was very touching.

A fruit plate, drinks, various snacks, and water were provided in the room, but I didn't finish them all. We went to the buffet for New Year's Eve dinner, and the number of guests staying was reduced by 50, with an average price of 248 per person, which is considered a reasonable price during the New Year.

Breakfast is included in the room rate, it is also self-service, and the variety is rich.

The room is also very complete with various facilities. There are bath salts for taking a bath. My daughter had a nice soak all night.

Oh, by the way, it also comes with a hot spring.

When you check out, you have to go to Ahotel, which also includes a free pick-up. hehe

The details of the service are all in place. Makes people feel very comfortable.

I opened the window to view the sea and went downstairs to the seaside. Don't be too happy! There are hot springs, swimming pools, children's amusement parks, etc. in the hotel. The children were very happy to play from morning to night. The service staff's attitude was very good. It was not cold at all and a bit hot inside during the Chinese New Year in winter. The hotel also sent two snacks to the two babies in the room. The drinks are also free. You can take the hotel shuttle bus from the hotel to other places in the park. It is very convenient. It is my first time to see the sea in winter and there are seagulls. The scene is very exciting. Photos cannot express it. Seeing the sea, I have no worries.

Let‚Äôs talk about the problem: the check-in time is too long. We arrived before three o‚Äôclock in the afternoon and after checking in, we were waiting for check-in. After driving for more than three hours from Beijing, we were very hungry. I wanted to go to eat directly after checking in and wait... After waiting for half an hour and asking several times, the room was temporarily unavailable and it would take an hourü´† Okay, then we went to the noodle restaurant in the hotel to eat a portion of ramen 70 and a braised pork rice 70. The braised pork rice was expensive and the portion was small, and the prepared dishes were decent. ü§£ü§£It‚Äôs very unpalatable, and it affects my mood a bit, but overall it‚Äôs okay! The Spring Festival is also the peak time for vacations. There are a lot of people and there are obviously not enough service staff.

My baby likes to sit by the window and watch the scenery. The room is very warm and we turned off the heater.

It has many activities and facilities specially designed for children. It also comes with a free hot spring for two, which is suitable for a parent-child vacation. The rooms are all sea view rooms. You can see the magnificent sunrise in the room in the morning, which is the biggest benefit of going to the seaside during winter vacation. Another unexpected surprise of this trip is that you can go to the beach to feed seagulls. It is said that only in winter will a large number of seagulls come to live on the Beidaihe beach. These seagulls are not afraid of people and are very cute. The service and reception of the hotel is also very good. Before check-in, there will be a dedicated customer service person who is responsible for guest relations and add WeChat. He will respond to all requests. During the stay, he will "check in" every day. It is almost comparable to the butler service of a B&B. He is thoughtful and enthusiastic. I will return it if I have the opportunity in the future.

msg:Suka is undoubtedly the most cost-effective hotel with the best view in Aranya. This time I stayed at the hotel, all the experiences were beyond expectations.
I didn't know it before, but now it also provides one-to-one butler service. Very attentive service was provided throughout the entire process.
Basically, if you come to Anaya again in the future, it will definitely be Suka.
By the way, Aranya in winter is really better than summer experience. Please don‚Äôt let the seasons influence your thoughts.

msg:I like Ananya so much, I like Suka so much!
First of all, the location is very good. I watched the sunrise on the balcony and went to the beach again.
Not far from the left side of the hotel is Sugu and Manner. Not far from the right side is the Yellow River into the sea and Shake Shack. Not far from the beach along Wangbei are the Sea Breeze Bar, the Auditorium, and the Lonely Library. If you don‚Äôt want to wait for the hotel car, just walk there. Not that far.
Secondly, the facilities are rich. The child played archery for free, but she did not join in the fun of other children's projects. The breakfast was also quite rich, with everything you need, and it met the standards.
Finally, the service attitude is very good. They will greet you at the front desk and in the restaurant, and they also give you a lot of free drinks in the room.
I want to come again next time

There was some air leakage from the floor-to-ceiling windows in the room, and the housekeeper even sent someone to seal the windows.
You can take a hotel car to go where Anayali wants to go.
Very satisfied with the butler's service.

It is recommended to add some convenient shoe sole cleaning measures on the second floor of the hotel and at the beach return area.

Thanks to the service team Coco, Rose, and Flora for their thoughtful preparation. Before check-in, I added WeChat to send check-in instructions and navigation routes. At the same time, I learned that I wanted to take my children to watch the sunrise. When I checked in on site, I was given a small surprise and a free upgrade. The room has the best view of the sea! Although it was only a two-day weekend trip, they still helped me arrange some itineraries that my children were more interested in. The hotel is located in the center of Aranya. You can walk on the beach and enjoy the sunrise and sunset. Many internet celebrity check-in coffee shops and delicious food can be reached on foot. The only shortcoming is that the hotel has been under construction for a long time, and the sound insulation is really a bit of a headache. You can basically hear the sound of pressing the switch next door, not to mention the crying children, which is a bit of a headache. I hope there will be an opportunity to upgrade and improve it overall! Will recommend to friends and will come again in the future!

msg:Aranya Club Med has always been a hotel that I have longed for, and this time I finally got my wish. Two nights in a superior king-size bed room including breakfast and hot springs totaled 1518, which is a very suitable price.
Two days before check-in, the hotel's guest relations specialist contacted me and informed me of many tips for staying in the hotel, as well as daily activities. After that, during the stay, they proactively contacted me every day to see if they needed help, which was very considerate. I would like to thank the service team of Rose, Flora, Coco, Dandan, etc. for making this trip very pleasant.
Let me talk about the hotel's service, which is what impressed me the most. No matter where you are, every hotel staff you meet greets you warmly and not in a perfunctory way. Any questions raised by guests are quickly resolved.
In addition, the hotel arranges a variety of activities every day, and we basically participate in them. We have so much fun that we don‚Äôt even have time to go shopping in the Aranya Park üòÇ
In terms of hotel facilities, there are a few flaws. The superior king bed room is too small and does not look like a resort hotel. Especially the bathroom is very crowded when two people enter at the same time. The shower room door is not tight and there is a lot of water outside the door after taking a shower. If you are not short of money, book a deluxe room... This time we stayed in Room 16 in Area A, which had no sunshine all day, so we recommend that friends who like sunshine book rooms 1-10 in Area A, which can get half a day of sunshine. Areas B and C should be better.
Overall, this trip was very enjoyable and I will come again when the time is right!

The hotel pick-up and drop-off service is very good, but the service at the front desk is very poor. The food in the buffet restaurant is very good, and the desserts are very good. The restaurant manager Jerry and the supervisor Xiao Gou provide very good service. They often ask guests about the taste of the dishes and the service situation... and help us locate the restaurant, and take care of the elderly and children... giving us a very considerate dining experience. Thank you both very much. I would also like to thank Ms. Xiao Liu, the manager on duty at the front desk, for helping us solve the unpleasant problems that occurred during the reservation and reception at the front desk, and helped us deal with the related problems in a timely manner. What I have to complain about is that as a seaside resort hotel, there is not even a single sea entertainment project, which is really speechless. Compared with the traditional villages, the service and price-performance ratio of Mediterranean Joyview are not at the same level.

The third canteen of the Sand Dune Art Museum is very close. The morning buffet is really good. I love the beef horn. It is really delicious. I have eaten it every day for the past few days. The Amway housekeeper responded in a timely manner. Basically, it is the kind that responds to every request (except in peak season). There is a mini bar. If there is any fruit, the butler will promptly replenish it. The room is indeed not very soundproof, but you can ignore it because there is the sea downstairs. It is very cost-effective.

Environment: It should be the hotel closest to the sea in Aranya. It is such a joy to be woken up by the dazzling sunshine every day. They also provide free extra beds, which is very user-friendly. Although the room is not very big, it is well designed. I would like to come again next time.

Facilities: Gym, swimming pool, hot springs, and many restaurants. What's even more fun is that there is a study room. I really want to go in and study!

Breakfast: Be sure to eat the noodles made by the chef, such as capillary noodles, dragon whiskers, leek leaves, and wide noodles. They can be made in minutes with skillful hands. Eat two bowls of them every day. All in all, very happy.

This store is really worth it.

After all, it is definitely good to bring children to Anaya to dig in the sand. You can have fun at the beach. After half a day, if the clothes get dirty and wet, it‚Äôs not a problem to go back upstairs to wash and change.

Service: The staff here will take the initiative to say hello to guests when they see them. The room is indeed not big, but the sanitary conditions are still acceptable. Children will be provided with fences and 1-1 housekeeping service. There are free drinks and fruits when you check in. There is a battery cart at the entrance of the lobby, which can be delivered to wherever you want for free.

Environment: The hotel lobby can really be used as a check-in point. The giant floor-to-ceiling windows really make the Aranya sea shine in the photo frame. The landscape outside the hotel is also very a**ospheric. Opposite the hotel is the racecourse and the park bus terminal. The popular Yellow River flows into the sea nearby, making it very convenient to go anywhere.

Meals: The hotel's buffet breakfast has a wide variety of options. I really like the ramen and coffee made on site. I didn't get tired of eating it for two days in a row. I don't have to worry about what to eat for the kids. The boiled corn steamed sweet potato noodles and bread are all loved by babies. .

Featured items: Unfortunately, the complimentary family fun space and Yiba evening show were not arranged, but the hot spring is still good. There is a diving pool suitable for babies, about 40 centimeters long. Remember to bring a swimsuit. There is a boutique shop on the first floor of the hotel. If you have forgotten something or need something urgently needed, you can also browse here.

All in all, it was a very comfortable stay. I was very satisfied except that the room and bed were a bit small. I will choose to stay here next time I come to Aranya. üò∫

I resolutely chose Clubmed again because the weather is relatively cold in October, and the hotel‚Äôs indoor hot spring can meet the children‚Äôs needs for playing in the water. Unexpectedly, I was assigned a sea view room facing the beach. The scenery outside the window is unparalleled. It feels so happy to watch the scenery, eat fruits and snacks, and chat with the children on the balcony every day! The second baby was very happy soaking in the hot spring. The crib provided by the hotel was also very useful and the baby slept peacefully. The large lawn and beach outside the hotel allow children to have fun and take off. Drinks, fruits, snacks and snacks in the hotel room are all free, which is greatüëèüëèThe butler service is super considerate, Xiao Zhang Xiaoxin and Xiao Cui are always quick to respond and meet all needs. I will definitely choose this place next time I come to Aranya üëç

msg:During the Golden Week, I came to Aranya to experience the utopian world. I chose ClubMed as my vacation base. I have been to Beidahu and Guilin before and this time I came to the Gold Coast. What was particularly surprising was that I met Tobias, an old friend of GO who had been there before my stay. I have been busy arranging my arrival at the store, prepared welcome fruits and small cakes, and promptly dealt with the license plate problem I encountered when entering the park.

Sleep until you wake up naturally during the day, go for a walk on the beach, lie on the grass to rest in the afternoon, and participate in the hotel's special Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day evening activities in the evening.

Healed by the tranquility of the sea and the enthusiasm of GOs, I came here to put aside all thoughts and eat, drink, dance and exercise under the leadership of GOs. Everything seemed so natural, a paradise for urban migrant workers.


ClubMed, see you in the next village! ü•∞

Thanks to the service staff rose, jerry, tobias, for their warm and thoughtful service, which made us feel at home. Room attendants Jin Jie and Zhao Yuehan carefully cleaned the room every day. Express thankfulness! The front desk clerk Flora Xiaocao helped arrange a parent-child room with a superb view of the sea and responded to every request, so I commend itüëç! There are many activities in the hotel. We participated in bicycle riding, painted T-shirts, and evening garden activities. The children made three key chains by themselves, experienced soft archery, and participated in music games organized by Yibali. We hug the sea, blue sky and white clouds every day, and play on the beach to our heart's content. I also took a speedboat on the sea and experienced the thrill of speeding like lightning. All in all it was a wonderful and memorable time. I look forward to bringing my family on vacation again in the summer and enjoying a comfortable and slow life! ~‚ù§Ô∏è

On the first day of departure, I added the hotel account manager on WeChat, and all kinds of questions were responded to immediately. Even the question of asking for the children's ID cards before departure at 6 o'clock in the morning was responded to immediately. I was really touched. During this period, they also sent me various hotel activities in a timely manner, added extra fruits, and helped us arrange car transfers... I don't like to trouble others, but Jerry Coco Rose's enthusiastic and professional service in the past few days made people feel like spring breeze. I have to sigh that after traveling so many times, I actually enjoyed the villa's private butler service at the price of a guest room. The whole trip was much more relaxed and comfortable.

Just outside the main entrance is the first canteen and the second canteen, both of which are delicious and not expensive. If you go to a place farther away from the community, the hotel also has a shuttle bus to pick you up. The main reason is that the butler service is so considerate and answers all questions promptly.

The hotel has a beautiful view. You can lie on the bed and watch the sunrise. The beach is also very thin. Children said it feels like they are stepping on it.
The various facilities in the hotel are also very complete. GO will take children of all ages to play for a day. As long as you want to play, you can play from the moment you open your eyes until you can‚Äôt play anymore ~
The catering is also very rich, and you can experience three styles of cuisine with one price, but there are many other cuisines you can experience in the Aranya community.
Friends with children can rent a small rental car, which is super fun to ride around. Araya‚Äôs horse racing club is also worth experiencing
Before entering Aranya, you must report your car number to the front desk~

üìçThe location is very, very convenient! ! It is right in the neighborhood center, which can be regarded as the center of the community. It is only 100 meters away from the sea, and you can take the shuttle bus directly at the neighborhood center to go anywhere.
There is a supermarket at the intersection, one or two canteens, life is very convenient

üîçIt happened to be at the music festival, and I sat on the balcony for a whole night, hahaha, it was worth the price

facility:
There are three ABC buildings in the hotel. They are very large and well-equipped. They face the sea. You can watch the sunrise from the balcony in the morning.
Blow up the snacks in the room! The small drinks in the refrigerator are all free, realizing the freedom of Wangzai milk. There is also a fruit plate every day, which is very fresh and of good quality, and the roses and plums are really sweet!

The environment of the breakfast room is very good. It is recommended to take a view seat by the window. You can eat while watching the sea. It is very comfortable. When the weather is fine, you can also sit outside. There are deck chairs and dining tables outdoors. There are many kinds of breakfast, especially recommended [freshly squeezed juice] at the door, we chose some fruits and vegetables, the master is very enthusiastic to help squeeze the juice

Clubmed is famous for its various activities, especially parent-child activities. I sincerely recommend staying with children. Children can be taken care of and parents are liberated. Guests staying at the hotel with breakfast included have free activities to participate in, such as hot springs, parent-child space, evening shows, etc.

Yiba Evening Show: The staff really worked hard, and some of the dancers were really good. If you are an e-person, you can order singing karaoke for free at the bar

Serve:
There is really nothing to say about the service, all the waiters in the hotel are very friendly and enthusiastic

After check-in, there will be a dedicated butler, +VX. If you have any questions, you will reply in seconds. Special thanks to our butlers Xiaocui jerry and flora. They will take the initiative to say good morning every day, and then ask if there are any snacks in the room that need to be added And fruit, help us book a car at any time, check out and help us apply for an hour delay

[Special recommendation] The hotel car service is really convenient, especially when watching the sunrise in the morning, you can take the car directly to the library, or you can call or VX to find the housekeeper when you come back, and the driver will pick you up very quickly.

I arrived early in the morning, and the hotel has 24-hour check-in. I completed the formalities in advance, stored my luggage, and went out for a walk. As a result, not only was the room prepared in advance, but I also helped to upgrade the room for free. Thank you!
There is enough coffee, tea bags, mineral water and snacks in the room, and a fruit plate is also provided. The balcony faces the sea. The weather is very good and I am in a bright mood. The observation deck outside the lobby also has a good view, which is suitable for ordering a drink. As soon as you sit down, the breakfast is extremely rich. It has everything you want and the space is large. It must be praised!
In particular, the lady from the service team is really attentive. She will send timely reminders about check-in, room facilities, hotel activity arrangements, and shuttle bus pick-up. In the end, I misremembered the check-out time and came back a little late. She also helped and made notes to give sufficient information. It took time to sort out...Although the time was short, I was cared for and very relaxed.
I specifically asked for my name, and I would like to thank Coco, Rose, and Kyrie again for their meticulous care. I will make time to come again. See you next time! ~

msg:It was a very enjoyable trip. It was a bit hot during the day, and the sea breeze was blowing in a shady place, but it was still very cool. The hotel is very beautiful and refreshing, there are many projects, and the children are so happy to think about it. It is within walking distance from the Aranya Auditorium and the Lonely Library, which are Internet celebrities who check in, and the soft sandy beach that people can't get enough of. It's not that I'm in a hurry, I really want to stay for a few more days.
Rose, Kyrie, and the coco service team are even more caring, responsive, and thoughtful. Fruits are welcome, and there are many drinks. They are really attentive. Every staff member greets guests friendly and feels very warm.
Our room is on the 7th floor of Building C, and the sea view is amazing, refreshing and pleasing to the eye. There is also a very rich breakfast, and you can eat until you are full.

msg:Bringing children and the elderly three times during the peak season, the original expectations were not high, after all, there are too many people. It is said that all 300 rooms are full, but I am surprised that the service quality is still online. Rose, Kyrie, and coco from the guest service depar**ent contacted the store in advance , After check-in, the response speed is fast, everything is responsive, the guest room is still clean and comfortable, and GO is still lively and enthusiastic. Surprisingly, I saw Tobias and Peggy who I knew in Hucun, Peking University. They had a happy chat and took a group photo, and even gave my daughter a favorite small gift. Personal opinion clubmed is still the hotel with the best scenery and location in Aranya. The beach and swings are just outside the door. The hotel can‚Äôt be on call since the üà∂Ô∏è battery car peak season, but there is still a wait for a few minutes, which is far better than the regular and crowded shuttle bus in the community, especially It is more convenient if there are old people and children. The balcony with sea view can easily watch the sunrise from the balcony. Looking forward to meeting clubmed again.

I would like to praise the butler team, Xiaoxin, Xiaocui and Haoran, they provide you with a question-and-answer consultation service throughout the whole process, and you can ask any questions. Moreover, on my wife‚Äôs birthday, I even arranged a room and sent a cake.
The bar on the first floor is also good. Drinking a glass of wine and blowing the sea breeze is really a bit like going abroad. Thanks to the bar brother, Pan Ao Patrick for his bartending service. He made a special cocktail for me, and the service is thoughtful.

msg:The first time I came to Ayana, I was alone, and what I liked was the sea view. Because I booked a bit late, I was entangled and chose this hotel where all rooms are sea view rooms to ensure that I can see the sea.
The room itself is fine, with a balcony and a good view. The location of the hotel is also good, very close to the beach. The overall tone is also relatively bright and concise. But it may be that the summer vacation and the location accounted for a large part of the price. There is still a certain gap between the price of more than 3k a night and the room itself.
What I have to complain about is the shower room. There is no separate lighting. It all depends on the light borrowed from the spotlight on the top of the toilet next to it, plus the cement tiles in the bathroom. I don‚Äôt know how other residents feel, as far as I am concerned. , The feeling of bathing is really a bit uncomfortable. But each room has an X-shaped drying rack. I really like this one. It is really necessary to have a place to hang clothes when going out to wash clothes.
The hotel's breakfast is not bad, and there are quite a lot of categories, but since there are western food available, can you have a few bottles of Tabasco to meet the needs of spicy people? I feel that this should be standard in most high-end hotels? Sweet chili sauce and chili oil are really not enoughüòî
Because I was alone, I didn't experience some of the items presented by the hotel. I saw that there were a lot of parent-child activities, and most of the hotel service staff were very enthusiastic.

The food and beverage level of the hotel is relatively average. Of course, there is no amazing restaurant in the whole of Aranya.

An Lan went to live in Aranya 3 years ago. This time I experienced club med, but I still feel that there is still a big difference. There are waiters for breakfast, serving and setting meals, and various activities are also very rich. Most importantly, club med is the hotel with the best view in Aranya. The beach is just downstairs. There is a % coffee cart, which is a benefit for coffee lovers. Unlike other hotels, club med does not require a shuttle bus to go to the beach, and you can even wear it Bathrobes go to the beach to play. We can also watch the sunrise in the room we live in, the view is so awesome! The hotel's breakfast is very rich and there are many choices. Unfortunately, the family has a small appetite and can't eat too much. The Asian Kitchen on the 2nd floor has a good and quiet environment, and the taste is also good. If you don‚Äôt want to go out for food, you can order a few dishes and eat and drink while watching the sea. Before leaving, it happened to be in time for the theater festival, and there was a special Porsche car to pick me up and go to an outside restaurant for dinner.

He has nothing to do at night when he goes to other parent-child hotels. There are children‚Äôs activities at 7:30 every night, and various shows+ at 8:15 entertainment activities. If you buy an all-inclusive package, you don‚Äôt have to worry about eating, and the entertainment is basically free. 3 self-service meals a day plus unlimited noodles are really exhausting. Yiba (bar) is also free. There are snacks and cakes for afternoon tea, and you can drink a cocktail if you have nothing to do. It's quite cozy. The facilities in the room are complete, water and drinks are replenished daily, and the hygiene is also quite in place. I have met their foreign boss many times in various activities and meals, personally supervised and observed the customer experience, and is very responsible. The service team Natacha and Ruijie Flora also have the same service, and they respond to every request. If we want to talk about the disadvantages of the hotel, the balcony is really small, and there is no heated children's pool + slide. In other respects, all kinds of parent-child hotels have been blown away.

msg:The hotel can be said to be operating at full capacity during the summer vacation, and it is generally good. But in summary, there are individual safety hazards, for mothers‚Äô reference:
1. I changed from a deluxe room to a suite. In the deluxe room, there is no sticker with the hotel name on the waist-high glass from the room to the balcony. The children will bump into it when they are playing crazy. The eldest of my family is eleven years old, but he still bumped his head. Fortunately, he can't run fast. But there are stickers on the glass of the suite at the waist.
2. There are chairs and tables on the balcony, but parents with children must pay attention and move the chairs to the side near the bedroom. Although the balcony glass is very high, reaching the chest position of adults, some children will stand on the chairs and look down. Similar events like the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum.
3. The sand slide at the seaside at the entrance, if you hold your child, don‚Äôt walk backwards, because the sand pile is dug in the middle of the concrete floor, and it will block it when you walk, causing you to fall and hurt your tailbone. This is what I saw with my own eyes . In addition, there is a small cement hill in the middle of the sand pile, with a small amount of sand on it. When a child runs from above, the sand on the soles of the shoes will slip and fall directly, and the tailbone will also fall.
4. About the service: I stayed for a long time, seven or eight days. Although some employees are particularly irritable, I can feel that they should be temporary or hourly workers of the hotel. I feel that every employee is working hard, and it is understandable to be a little irritable and anxious. The overall situation is good, and the needs will be responded to.
5. About food: I recommend the Yiran Seafood Restaurant on the first floor. The steak, mashed potatoes, tomato cheese are all delicious. Asian restaurants are not all-inclusive, and they pay to eat, which is really not good. There are too many people at breakfast, which is very noisy, but there are many varieties. I recommend beef noodles, which are delicious.
6. Regarding the facilities: the indoor swimming pool is very small and full of people, so it is not recommended to go there, but the paid indoor swimming pool next door is very good.
7. Regarding the geographical location: the sea view is absolutely beautiful, it is not hot in July, and the air conditioner cannot be turned on to play, so a quilt is needed.
I have been to Anaya several times, and have stayed at Folklore, Anlan, and this villa. Overall, the price/performance ratio is still very high, and the service, facilities, and scenery are all good.

There were not many people in the swimming pool, but it was not too big. It was raining the next day, and we stayed at the hotel all day. The breakfast was very rich and very good. There are many entertainment facilities for children to play, soak in hot springs, and continue swimming. Get up early on the third day, walk to the beach for 2 minutes when the weather is clear, you can pick up shells at low tide, and if you are lucky, you can catch live big snails. Every waiter will say hello when they see it, and thank you to the Jerry, Natasha, and Rose teams who served us. For a worry-free trip, Aranya is a must.

The beach is right outside the hotel! Just don't be too cool! From the concierge to the lobby to the front desk to the room, all the service staff are really serving with heart! Let me especially talk about Ms. Cao in the lobby. From the moment I led the child into the door, she came to meet me.

It can be said that it is because of this hotel that I booked this birthday trip at Anaya. Before I checked in, the guest relations staff contacted me very considerately, introduced the basic situation of the hotel, and noted the arrival time and license plate number, which was very heartwarming. Especially Jerry, natasha and rose, each staff member is very patient, helping me answer some of my requests, and being away from home makes me feel like I am back home. When I heard that I checked in on my birthday, they provided a beautiful and delicious birthday cake, and the children were very happy. From the day of check-in to check-out, there was no dissatisfaction in the whole process, and the whole process was highly praised. The location is superior. The beach is just outside the door on the first floor. It really is the sea after staying for a few days. You can easily see the orange sea sunrise from the balcony. The buffet breakfast is also very rich in variety. My husband and children like it very much and are very satisfied. The service of the swimming pool is also very good. It lasts for a long time, and the children will go for a swim every night, reluctant to part. The interior of the room is large and the layout is very reasonable. A family of three lives in a spacious, bright and comfortable room. Free drinks and snacks, and the bed is made every afternoon, snacks are prepared, and the lighting and a**osphere of the room at night are very comfortable. The hotel has different parent-child activities every day. When you stay in the hotel, you will have many free programs to participate in. It really liberates parents and releases children. I will stay here next time I come to Aranya, and I will definitely recommend it to my friends.

Children's breakfast (4 to 11 years old): very rich, donuts, waffles, bread pudding, freshly squeezed juice...
Free double hot spring: very good, individual massage equipment needs maintenance.

msg:Taking advantage of the approaching peak season, the family came to Aranya for the weekend and chose the Clubmed Hotel. Fortunately, it was arranged on the 8th floor of Building A. You can watch the sunrise from the room. You also bought a one-price all-inclusive package. The buffet is rich and varied , The steak in the western restaurant is also delicious, and there are all kinds of noodle noodles in the noodle bar are super authentic. I am very grateful to our service team this time. Their names are Natasha, Xiao Yuan, and Coco. The children and their families are very reluctant to part with each other. They will come back in two days after the children's holiday. I look forward to seeing you again!

msg:1. The room facilities are relatively old, and some parts of the wall can be seen peeling off. 2. The water flow in the bathroom is very thin, and it is difficult to take a shower. The bathroom is not ventilated. 3. There will be small flies in the house, which is very annoying. I caught at least six of them in one night. 4. The service is average, especially the front desk. The details of care for families with children are not in place. They did not inform the hotel which services are included for free and which can be experienced for a fee. 5. When I checked in, I didn't tell the room service to make the child's small bed. 6. The sound insulation of the room is poor, people walking and talking in the corridor will make you collapse. 7. Breakfast experience: The food is average, basically at the level of a four-star hotel in Sanya. There is no particularly delicious food, and the level of the chef team is not very in line with the high-end market positioning of clubmed joyview. 8. The hotel's local waiters need more training to improve their level, and the current price does not match.

Facilities: Very good, all relatively new. The equipment in the room is quite complete, as well as bluetooth speakers and sound-proof earplugs, which is quite unexpected.
Hygiene: clean and tidy
Environment: Comfortable, the location in the Aranya community is not far from there
Service: Considerate, Ctrip has a dedicated check-in counter, welcome fruit (Picture 1), drinks and snacks are free (Picture 2, 3 beer is brought by yourself), and will be replenished the next day after eating.
Breakfast: There are many varieties and the taste is ok
Free double hot springs: less pools, only 3 of which are for children to play in the water.
One price all inclusive is suitable for children, this time I didn‚Äôt buy one price all inclusive if I don‚Äôt have children. The hotel is very friendly to children, and the service staff are very polite and enthusiastic. The check-in experience is good.
Let me give you some advice. The distance between the TV facing the bed and the bed in the room (Deluxe Double Room) is relatively small, and there is no protection. After knocking twice, I personally think that the TV can be replaced with a smaller one. üòÅ
The overall feeling is very good, and I look forward to going again next time.

A very satisfying trip~ I suggest that the internal staff of the hotel need to strengthen training~ At the very least, the location of the event should be clearly known... Also, the internal event is not very friendly to guests who only include breakfast.

The service team: Xiao Xin, Xiao Zhao, Xiao Cui, contacted us before check-in, and helped us all the way. After leaving the store, I also helped to find the child's lost little genius watch at night. I left a message after 5 o'clock in the morning to help find it. I have caused trouble for everyone! Thank you very much! ! !
From facilities to activities, from location to humanities, the hotel is top-of-the-line in Nandaihe, and it is more than a few streets away from those in wlha. The GO culture left a deep impression on the children, with rich activities and a mature community, where they basically have everything they want to play and eat. This time, the all-inclusive package did not provide babysitting for the children, and only participated in the activities on the runway between the seaside and indoors, but I felt that it was worth the money. Be sure to experience hosting next time, Mr. Liberation.
The journey is perfect and I still have more to say. I will definitely try it again!

msg:The environment and services of the hotel are in line with expectations. This time I stayed in Building A, which has a beautiful sea view. Compared with Buildings B and C, it may be a little farther away from the church and other scenic spots, but it is not too far away. Building A is quieter.
In terms of facilities, I feel that the facilities of the hotel at this price are relatively average. The cabinets, tables or luggage racks in the room are very limited, and things can only be spread on the table. In addition, the airtightness of the balcony is average. It was windy last night, and I slept all night listening to the howling sea breeze. In addition, I don't know why the swimming pool is only open until 19:00.

But overall the experience of the hotel is really good, I mainly like three points:
1. The service is considerate and in place, the hotel customer service is responsive, the response is fast, and the attitude is warm. Thank you Ruijie coco, natacha and Xiaoxin for their considerate service;
2. The breakfast is very rich in variety and includes a variety of options;
3. It includes a variety of services and activities. We experienced the hot springs, and it was very refreshing after a day.
Finally, the golf driving range next to the hotel is 58 yuan per hour after 5 pm, which is very cost-effective.

1. If you see on the Internet that vehicles entering the park need to be registered, call the hotel in advance to report the license plate, and confirm with the waiter that the registration has been successful. But when the car drove to the park, it was still impossible to enter, and the security guard gave the hotel a call. Here comes the highlight: I called the front desk for ten minutes and no one answered! Later, I repeatedly negotiated with the security guard and left a lot of personal information before I was allowed to enter. When I went to the front desk and asked why I didn't answer the phone, the reply I got was that I was too busy, and no one usually took care of the phone. In this case, the hotel should not mention any license plate registration, and do not leave any front desk phone number. Generously tell everyone that there is no related service!
2. On the wall near the table tennis table on the first floor, there are inexplicably some raised decorations of the same color as the wall. When picking up the ball, I hit my head. I saw that the anti-collision stickers were pasted on those raised decorations, but the anti-collision stickers that hit my head were all smashed, and it was very unfortunate that my head was smashed by the exposed part. Firstly, I don‚Äôt understand what is the purpose of this kind of hard-to-recognized and easy-to-injury decoration in the sports area. Second, the anti-collision stickers are pasted and the anti-collision stickers have been smashed. It can be seen how many people have been injured!
I don't want to complain about other things like breakfast, vegetable market, etc. Apart from the location, this hotel has no other highlights

msg:Anaya's reputation is already well-known. She went to see the house many years ago, but she didn't place an order by mistake. Looking at it today, it is the best house and the best location, which is a pity. This trip can be regarded as a revisit to the old place, and take a look at the sea by the way.
Furthermore, I registered as a member of Ctrip in 2005, and this is my first order, the first time I placed an order from the Internet to book a room. After placing the order, I was a little surprised that the hotel will have "little butlers" (Xiao Li, Xiao Zhao) to contact you and accompany you in all your itineraries and activities throughout the park in Aranya. Considerate, considerate service, help you solve problems. Thank you so much! ! !
If you have a chance, come back when there are few people, Aranya Mediterranean Hotelüè®

Therefore, I proposed: the room should be higher and closer to the elevator , It is convenient for the elderly to watch the sunrise without leaving home~
Check in, all requirements are met. The next morning, when my mother lay on the bed and saw the beautiful scenery of the rising sun outside the window, she was filled with emotion.
During the four-day and three-night stay, dozens of WeChat messages recorded the customer service Sherly's greetings, which was very considerate.
This trip, with the help of the resort's invincible sea view and Chinese and Western cuisine, we quietly felt the close contact with the sea and were satisfied.

msg:After staying at home for three years due to the epidemic, I finally let myself go! For the first stop, I chose Clubmed in Aranya, which I have been thinking about for a long time. The early spring is not the busiest time of the year, but there are not too few customers, mainly young people, and there are also many middle-aged parents who bring children and the elderly to play. The overall service attitude of the hotel makes people feel warm and happy. Xiao Zhou and Xiao Zhao called and added WeChat the day before they checked in, asking what requirements they had, and wrote down the license plate number, so that when they arrived at the gate of Aranya Park, they would automatically lift the lever to let them go. During the stay in the hotel, they gave a lot of care, greeted them, helped them with luggage, took them to the room in person, explained the hotel facilities, let us ask any questions, and arranged greeting fruits. We really felt at home, thank you very much. I can feel that the hotel management is very good, and all the staff members I met greeted me warmly.
In the morning, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the window of the room is facing the sunrise, and I can also go out and take pictures on the balcony, which is so beautiful. The buffet breakfast has many varieties and is of good quality. The hotel features a lot of fun activities. Spacious, clean and a**ospheric, it is a good place for vacation.
Not far away is the Aranya Auditorium and the lonely library. You must check in before you can book a visit time on the Aranya APP. We checked in after 12:00 noon. The Aranya Auditorium was fully booked on the day, so we quickly booked the next morning. The exterior of the auditorium is very beautiful. When you enter it, you can sit quietly facing the sea and watch the waves surge. You can hear the soft organ music and the holy chorus, which is so healing. The lonely library is also a favorite place, the books are very tasteful, and there are many seats where you can sit and read in a daze.
Feeding seagulls by the sea is a very happy thing. It is recommended to bring some small biscuits or bread. Those bold seagulls can't wait to rush to people's faces to snatch food.

The service staff is very polite, and they will greet each other when they see them. After booking a room, some staff members added WeChat, and especially praised Vicky Xiao Zhao and Xiao Zhou. They responded in a timely manner and were very enthusiastic. There are hot springs indoors, three pools, and many children, but the hot springs saw parents taking their children to pee indoors, and they took it!

After check-in, because the welcome fruit was not delivered in time, I made up two pieces of fruit afterwards, which is very considerate.

The hotel is suitable for families with children. There are parent-child archery, yoga, rock climbing, table tennis, etc., as well as a mini club that can be hosted. The professional G.O team here will arrange many programs for children and adults to have fun. We especially like brother Sprite, sister Vivian and brother ice cream from Bali.
Come to see the frozen sea and seagulls, sunrise in winter. The biggest convenience of living here is that you can see the sea without going out, and you can take pictures of the beautiful sunrise without going outside in the morning.
The hot springs and swimming pools in the hotel are also children's favorites. After playing outside and taking a dip in the hot springs, it is really refreshing both physically and mentally.

The hotel's other services are still of high quality. The ladies who clean the rooms are very kind and responsible.

msg:The wish of lying on the bed and watching the winter sunrise has come true. Haha, the location is very good. My two-year-old baby woke up naturally after 7 o'clock. I usually wake up after 8 o'clock. I asked my baby what the sun looks like in the morning. I thought They will say it looks like an egg or a cake, and they answer: like the moon, haha. Originally booked An Lan, just because she was afraid that her baby would not get up to watch the sunrise, so she changed to a sea view room in this hotel that was three times more expensive, and it was worth it, ha.
       What is not satisfactory is that the bed is too narrow. In a deluxe sea view twin room, each bed is one meter wide, which is a bit uncomfortable. Also, there is too little sound insulation. Let‚Äôs not talk about the children next door arguing in the middle of the night. The sound of turning on the bedside lamp in the next room feels right next to your earsüòÖ. I feel that if you bring the elderly here, you will definitely suffer from insomnia.
        The service is good, and the service staff I met are very kind. I just read other people's comments that the hotel housekeepers took the initiative to contact me. Why didn't anyone contact me? However, An Lan, who was booked first, did have someone contact me. After changing the hotel, no one contacted me. It was the car number I reported myself...
        Eating in the Aranya community is very convenient. There are restaurants in the hotel, and there are many canteens in the community. The second canteen downstairs is clean and hygienic. There are also many other restaurants, so there is no pressure to bring your baby to eat.
        Overall, this trip was good, and we can come again when the weather is warmer.

msg:It was the first time to see the sea in winter, and I chose to spend three nights and four days in clubmed!

It turns out that the sea can also freeze. When the waves are frozen, they still look like rolling on the beach. Large pieces of ice shatter on the golden sandy beach. The dazzling sunlight in the noon gives it a shimmering light. The sea is very elegant and delicate in winter. . From morning to night, there are countless seagulls hovering along the coast. They fly very low, waiting for the generous feeding of tourists.
  
The popularity of Clubmed is undeniable. Even in the cold winter months, it is still overcrowded. This time, many activities were not lined up, such as archery. Every time I passed by, I saw a lot of people in the room, and I didn‚Äôt bother to line up. We chose the breakfast-included room for the second brush, and the one-price all-inclusive + 900/day is not bad, but there are too many items, which is not suitable for lazy people like us. Most of the time in winter, the lunch and dinner buffet is not open, so you have to order from another restaurant).

[Facilities] The 35-square-meter common room is not too small. The design of the full sea view is great, and there is also a balcony, which is suitable for watching the scenery. Generally speaking, the facilities are complete, we stayed for three days and felt very comfortable. The central air conditioner and bath water are very powerful, and you won't feel cold in winter after entering the house. Perhaps due to the popularity, some facilities are a bit old, such as the ground of the cafeteria, which is somewhat mottled and stained. There is no coffee machine in the Superior Ocean View Room, but there are a lot of drinks in the small refrigerator (Wangzai milk, Starbucks canned coffee, Coke Sprite, Sunkist soda), and they can take the initiative to make up for it every day. The service is lacking, but it is short-handed, and the service must be full of stars! Liked [Âº∫] I don‚Äôt know why the swimming pool is not open, but fortunately the hot spring is open, but unfortunately there is no sauna room. In particular, it is recommended that the hotel should put a reminder in the hot spring pool "It is recommended to shower before entering the hot spring pool (Japanese hot springs will mark it). After all, there are many children and adults are dirty, and they are afraid of potential harm to children's health. Even if only half of them follow the advice, I thought the pool would be much cleaner!

[Meals] Generally speaking, the five-star level is online, and I like the freshly squeezed vegetable and fruit juice, which has become the favorite of the whole family, adults and children! The quality of individual meals is not as good as last year, such as quick-frozen big buns and sliced ham, which have a technological taste. There is no freshly ground coffee. It is the first time I saw a five-star hotel without such a configuration. I asked three waiters and the answers were different... 10,000 yuan can be equipped with three Delonghi! This money can't be saved! Fortunately, there is canned Starbucks coffee in the room, otherwise one star would be deducted for this!

[Service] Foreign employees are obviously warmer and hospitable. They will greet each other when they meet. The children are well taken care of! A suggestion is to extend the time for archery, rock climbing and other projects, including the children's indoor playground. Isn't it too early to get off work at five o'clock! This time I stayed for three days and didn't play... In short, the off-season price is really good, and I will come again!

I chose to stay at the Club Med Hotel in the Aranya community, and I am very satisfied with the experience of this stay.
All rooms face the sea. The sea in winter has a special charm. If you are lucky, you will catch a snowfall. The sun, sea, blue sky, white snow and green grass are beautiful!
The hotel service is very good, the room is clean, and the legitimate needs of the guests can be met. Fruit drinks in the room are free, and all the staff smile and say hello when they meet. Special thanks to the customer relations Carol, Vicky and Xiao Zhao. From the beginning of the reservation, they have been in communication and asked about various check-in requirements, and the arrangements have been made properly.
The hotel has various entertainment facilities, a swimming pool, a hot spring pool, KTV, table tennis, children's activity area and so on. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, basically everything you should have. I just feel that the sound insulation of the hotel room is not satisfactory, and I hope to improve.
All in all, it was a good staying experience!

Almost all rooms in the hotel face the sea and are very close to the sea. When I first saw the pictures of the room, I thought the room would be relatively small. Although it is not as spacious as An Lan, I actually feel that the room has enough space, and there is enough space for a baby cot next to the big bed. The hotel's indoor entertainment facilities are very rich. Although the hotel facilities are not fully open at the end of the epidemic, it is conceivable that the outdoor temperature is low in winter. It is most suitable for cats in hotels with rich indoor entertainment facilities. clubmed is definitely the first choice. The service of the hotel is very good. The staff in various positions are very polite and patient, especially Sherly and Li Yang. They will ask me about my check-in needs before I check in, and will track my experience during the stay. The thoughtful and meticulous service is a plus. In addition, if the weather is good, getting up early to watch the sunrise is also a good choice. I didn't bring my baby this time, and I look forward to bringing my baby to enjoy a happy time next time.

It also introduced prevention and control policies, helped confirm the situation of epidemic reporting, and introduced hotel hosting activities. We enjoyed the two days at Clubmed so much. After breakfast, we paid for hosting for one hour alone, so that our adults can take a bath and prepare to go out to play. Children don‚Äôt have to watch TV in the room waiting for us. Follow GO to feed the horses and do a lot of handicrafts. , and soon our slow-warming baby got acquainted with Go and was very happy. The evening activities are also very rich.

It turned out that I was right. In order to save trouble, I chose an all-inclusive package, which is simply not great. The day before check-in, the hotel staff contacted our check-in staff, made epidemic prevention reports, etc., prepared cots for children, and made reports for entering the Anaya community. During the subsequent check-in time, you can contact the hotel staff through WeChat, and you are proficient in everything about food, clothing, accommodation, and travel, and you can call the hotel's battery car to pick you up at any time. The location of the hotel is super good. We arranged a sea view room with a view of the church, and watching the sunrise directly in the room is not too great. For someone like me who has a slight cleanliness, the sanitation details of the hotel are handled very well, and the stay is very peaceful. The children were entrusted to the hotel for two days, and the activities were very rich, such as horse feeding, hot springs, dancing, games, afternoon tea, etc. The children did not want to come back after playing, so I also had a lot of time to take beautiful photos. The most comfortable thing is that the hotel's service attitude makes you feel happy all the time. The way each staff member greets you is really happy. This is probably the GO culture. I have eaten almost all of the several restaurants in the hotel (all-inclusive), the dishes are rich and of good quality, and my husband, who is picky, is full of praise. Special thanks to Sherly, Carol and Li Yang for their excellent service, which made our trip icing on the cake, and will definitely choose here next time!

This time I only stayed for one night, and I didn't have time to experience the various activities and facilities that the hotel prepares for passengers. I will arrange a time to come and experience it next time.

As a southern city, I think everything I have seen is good, the scenery is beautiful, the service is warm, and I left a good impression on the first side. It has to be off-season. Although the seaside is windy and a little cool in the morning and evening, everything is fine on sunny days. Just right, no one bothers to take pictures, the hotel has its own activities and I am tired of playing the hot spring in the room to look at the sea, and I have begun to look forward to the next time before I leave.

msg:When traveling with a baby, the most important thing is convenience and comfort~
The hotel is very close to the beach, and there are many places to eat nearby, which can meet the needs of everything from dinner to snacks to desserts.
Although it is a parent-child package, the package is not suitable for children under 3 years old, so the old mother can only continue to fight everything üôÉ
The baby likes the mushroom pool in the hot spring very much, and the favorite is probably the constant SpongeBob SquarePants in the small room next to the lobby~~
The housekeepers Vicky Xiaozhao and Carol are very kind and responsive to our needs. From check-in to check-out, they gave us the greatest help.
Although I personally don't think the various loneliness and tranquility in Anaya's gimmicks are good, this hotel is very friendly to children (especially small babies) from the environment to the service. Will definitely come again~~üòÇ

Service: Xiao Zhao and Sherly from Guest Relations are very caring, reminding us of the latest developments of the epidemic every day, and caring about whether we have arrived home smoothly. G.O is also very enthusiastic about children, organizes a variety of activities at Yi Bar every night, and actively reminds us what we can participate in.

msg:Qinhuangdao Beidaihe, the first time I came, my friend joked that this season is a place where people who have made outstanding contributions to the country can come. At first, my impression of Beidaihe was still in Grandpa Mao's Beidaihe vacation. This time I came to Beidaihe, first because the summer vacation was over, and I brought my baby out to play, and another reason was that the location was too hot, 40¬∞ every day, so I came here to escape the heat. The hotel chose club med, which is located in the Anaya community and is very close to several other online celebrity check-in points. Stayed for four nights, because it is an old-fashioned parent-child hotel with children, and the daily program is full. You can sign up for the activities organized by the hotel yourself, or you can go for a walk on the beach, rent a bicycle, ride in the community, and watch the art exhibition. Try the seafood. The hotel's facilities are OK, neither new nor old, the fly in the oin**ent is that the sound insulation is a bit poor. Hotel staff, I would like to highlight Sherly, Vicky and Xiao Zhao from the Guest Relations depar**ent. Before I came to the hotel, I contacted me. Because there were six people in my company, I established a service group that could really respond to requests, and the results of handling things were satisfactory. I would also like to commend Stone Xiaolei from the concierge depar**ent. He and his colleagues have basically arranged the transportation for the past four days. No matter where I am going, no matter what time I use the shuttle bus, anytime, anywhere. Standby. Because there is still a distance between several places in the Anaya community, although there is a small bus in the park, it is inconvenient to bring a baby, and the shuttle bus is very, very useful, so thank stone again for the service these days! The beauty of Anaya is beyond words, the quiet place in the world, find the place where I am, I will come again!

The main point is that the service is very satisfactory. I came from Chaoyang District in Beijing (the room had not been booked at that time), and the hotel was helping me to coordinate and reply to the application for entering Qin. The responsible lady called me a lot to tell me how to do it. In line with the requirements of epidemic prevention, we will arrange the itinerary reasonably until we check in smoothly, and there is a caring butler service. All drinks in the room are free. You can ask the hotel room for slippers and towels when you go to the beach. It's very convenient.

My child is less than 4 years old, although some projects are not allowed to participate, but they have a lot of fun, especially the evening activities at Yiba. The service of guest relations is also very thoughtful, adding WeChat to consult and provide services at any time. The children's bath and toiletries are provided in the room, the sanitary conditions are clean, and the breakfast is rich. Thanks to the waiters Xiao Zhao Xiaotang and Vicky, it would be better if the other room can provide toilet seats for babies.

msg:Really can only be described as anger! Are you sure this isn't a scam? ! Does the Tourism Bureau of the Price Bureau really care? ? Outrageous! Outright fraud, all the good mood of travel has been destroyed! In a 4,000-a-night hotel, the bed is only one meter and it is very speechless. The whole room is dim. It may be to cover up the mess of the room. There are live insects crawling on the bed, the sofa is stained, and the pillow covers are all dirty. The bed and quilt still have blood stains, the pillow smells musty, and the room smells musty. The dirt on the floor of the bathroom is really dark and terrifying. It's really not as good as a 200-dollar hotel. How dare you ask for 4,000 a night? ! It's really a scam, really don't go, it's terrible! Really want to complain about the price bureau and tourism bureau fraud!

msg:The first-line sea view is invincible. It is very convenient to return to the hotel after playing the sand, and it feels like a vacation. I think this should be the worst hotel in the clubmed group that sells all-inclusive prices, because you can play for a day by dredging the sand. The restaurants in the Anaya Park are also quite rich, and the children's facilities are also very complete.
       For various reasons of convenience, the CM in summer vacation can be as high as 4,000 per night for a single room with breakfast included. Such a high price makes many people feel that it is not worth it.
       Fortunately, the price I ordered was normal. But this stay was pleasant and interspersed with many sporadic episodes.
[Let's talk about the pleasant point first]: Before check-in, there is a customer service plus WeChat to inform the details, which is very considerate. The sea view from the room made me happy. Bubble parties are happy.
[Let's talk about a series of episodes]: 1. The check-in staff is not very skilled in business, and there is no indication of how many floors are given to the room card. We went to the wrong floor, and the child was given one less bracelet.
2. The door was not locked tightly, I thought it was closed. In fact, just push it open. It doesn't matter if it's closed, it doesn't call the police every time. I found out later that I immediately contacted the staff to solve it. I have a long memory. Next time I watch the door close tightly, it is not really locked. I have to push it hard to make sure.
3. I accidentally hit my foot with a plate while picking up the meal in the cafeteria. At that time, I was pouring ice milk, and an employee took the plate next to the milk. As a result, the plate slipped and fell on my feet in slippers, and then smashed and shattered, scaring me to death! I quickly checked and found that my King Kong feet were not broken or bleeding! The staff also quickly checked and apologized. I was thinking about getting out of the glass ballast, and when I got back to my seat, I felt a little pain in my foot. . .
4. The butter in the cafeteria has been changed from Anjia to a domestic brand. I have never heard of it, probably to save costs. But the hotel explained that it is not necessary to import ingredients because of the epidemic, okay. .
5. After checking out, a staff member called me, I responded to the problem, and finally the hotel said that it hoped to give a 5-star praise, which is very important to them. . .

At this moment, I hesitated and decided to follow my original evaluation. Traveling under the epidemic is not easy for hotels. However, management and quality cannot be neglected, and it is unreal to focus on praise. I can't give 5 stars because the door lock is broken, and other problems are ignored because of the smashed feet. Sorry.

(We haven‚Äôt used the car very much, it‚Äôs basically brand new, because we usually have other carts at home, after the concierge depar**ent took the luggage, the cart went to other guests, and other children sat on it and stepped on it dirty Xi, they left without an apology when they came down, saying that it was given to them by the security guards)
The check-in experience when the hotel is full is very, very bad. I checked in once in the off-season and thought it was good. This time I brought the elderly and children with me. As a result, the concierge depar**ent was in a hurry. There were no people, no luggage carts, and no welcome guests. , there is nothing, and the things can be thrown away for you. Let others use the portable baby stroller I brought for my child. It is not efficient to solve the problem. It will only smile, but not do practical things
Hygiene: During the peak season, you have to wait for check-in. The front desk can‚Äôt handle it at all. I booked a connecting room with two rooms. After packing up my luggage, I found that there was hair on the bed in one room, and yellow stains on the toilet seat in the other room. After arguing about the baby stroller being stolen without authorization, the energy of the family was exhausted. I should ask the person in charge to come over again to take a look.
Environment: The room is not soundproof, and you can hear everything in the corridor outside clearly
Service: It‚Äôs okay to say that the service is not good, but in trivial details, such as saying hello when you meet, and saying hello wherever you go, etc., smiling and full of energy, it makes people feel very comfortable; The service is good, but when encountering a difficult problem, the solution is really slow. What happened 20 minutes ago has a specific goal. I watched the video for an hour, because it happened at 12 o'clock in the afternoon, and I haven't finished watching it at one or two o'clock in the afternoon. In the video, the elderly and children were waiting in the lobby, unable to eat or sleep. ps: After waiting for a long time, the room was not cleaned up.

I wanted to eat noodles at night, so I asked the housekeeper in advance if the kitchen could cook the noodles for me. After waiting for nearly 20 minutes, the housekeeper finally told me that I had to sign a waiver agreement, and that I had to sign an agreement to cook a piece of noodles. I couldn't understand it. .

The normal check-in time is after 3 p.m., but the check-out time requires guests to check out at 11 p.m. This is also unreasonable, and the check-in time is not 24 hours

Step on the beach during the day, and at night the hotel will have various parent-child activities. Swimming pools, hot springs, and children's playgrounds are all available. If you bring children, it is recommended to choose club med!
Disadvantage: Our room is arranged at the farthest edge, far from the elevator. The housekeeper said that we can change the room if necessary, but he didn't change it because it was troublesome. A room not too far from the elevator is recommended.
The quilt is not breathable and it is easy to sweat!

msg:The first time I came to Anaya, I stayed at the Club Med Joyview Gold Coast Resort. It has a beautiful environment and is close to the coast. You can enjoy the magnificent view of the sea and the sky when you lie on the bed. The blue sky sets off the vast sea, making people feel that I have never been relaxed. The hotel room is well-equipped, clean and tidy, and the service is thoughtful. Customer relations Vicky Xiaotang and Sherly Li Yang have been in touch since we booked the hotel to inform us about the hotel stay, which makes people feel at home and has a good stay experience.

The hotel is in the Anaya community, and the environment from the community to the hotel is excellent! The hotel is also zero distance from the sea, the beach is very soft and soft, and the sea is clean, but the waves are a bit big and you can't swim in the sea! Originally booked a superior sea view room, I learned that the two majors and two children were upgraded to the supreme sea view for free, thank you very much! The breakfast is also great and can satisfy the tastes of different people! The hotel staff are very nice to meet and greet each other! Special thanks to sehrly. Vicky.

The front desk arranged for us a side sea view room with a perfect view, large floor-to-ceiling windows, red wine and a welcome fruit plate. , The drinks in the refrigerator are also free to drink. The hotel has various activities every day, but because the season is not right, no water sports are open. I participated in cycling, rock climbing, archery, outdoor barbecues and evening parties. The buffet is very lively. Very rich, especially recommended beef rice noodles, cheese mashed potatoes, waffles, the taste is top, the seafood taste is average, and I am a bit tired after eating for 4 days. I accidentally found the noodle bar on the 2nd floor of Block B. The noodles are very delicious, especially the beef rice with double pepper and the small intestine noodles. They are so delicious that the childcare service is very convenient. The GO inside is very enthusiastic. The children like Brother Sprite, Brother Watermelon, and Sister Hallokitty. In the past, the hotel had customer service specialists and WeChat to contact the whole process. If you have any questions after arriving, you can directly WeChat their butler service. Xiao Zhao, Liyang, Vicky and Cynthia have a very good service attitude and helped coordinate the renewal and scheduling problems.

Desserts and red wine were also given to welcome fruit, and there was chocolate cake at night time. Breakfast is not a traditional buffet. There are very few people in Anaya now, many shops are only officially open on April 1, and the hotels are also quite discounted during the peak season. Overall, it is a great experience, praise Xiao Zhao and Bob by name, and considerate service (Ôø£‚àáÔø£)

The restaurant in the morning is facing the coast, especially the enthusiasm of Li Yang, Xiao Zhao and Xiao Lu. Service, arranged in advance the baby fence, baby toiletries, and gave a small gift when leaving. Just outside the hotel is the beach and swing, and it takes less than ten minutes to walk to the Anaya Auditorium, which is really important for a family with a small baby. In terms of comprehensive location + sea view + facilities + friendliness to babies, clubmed is really the first!

He was very attentive and added the butler's work service WeChat, what's the matter? You can contact them anytime you need, saving you a lot of trouble. The hotel's rooms with sea views are also very meticulous in hygiene. During the epidemic, they will also prepare anti-epidemic kits (masks, alcohol spray, earplugs, disinfectant wipes and disposable bath bags). In short, the check-in experience is very good, and I will continue my stay. For the two nights, I am very grateful to Xiao Tang, Vicky, Wu Jing and many other staff who can't be named. I felt the care and service from the bottom of my heart.

msg:The epidemic situation is one after another, and the Spring Festival holiday is the peak of travel. There are indeed limited places to go and worth visiting.
Temporarily decided to seize the tail of the Spring Festival and go to Beidaihe for a short vacation. Winter is the off-season for Beidaihe tourism. Clubmed Beidaihe just has a winter promotion, so there is this off-season seaside trip.
Clubmed Beidaihe is the best international hotel in Beidaihe, offering one-price all-inclusive service, suitable for family vacation travel.

üöó Transportation: Although in Hebei, the transportation from Shanghai to Beidaihe is very convenient, the plane and high-speed rail can be directly reached, and the airport and high-speed rail station to the hotel only takes about 30 minutes by car. Now that the off-season is adding to the epidemic, air tickets during the Spring Festival are also more favorable.

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel environment and the surrounding overall environment are good. As a veteran, there are countless "read shops". Clubmed Beidaihe is better than I expected. The hotel is quite big and the overall style is more holiday-style. The lobby is bright and a**ospheric, the rooms are not small, and the deluxe rooms/suites have large balconies. Although the room is not luxurious, it is well maintained, well equipped, clean and comfortable. The hotel is right next to the beach of Gold Coast. All rooms have sea view. The room we stayed in this time is basically a sea view. You can see the sunrise every day when you lie on the bed. Although it is too cold to go to the sea in winter, the sea is open and pure, and the golden sandy beach is sometimes covered with white snow, and there are few people on the beach in winter. Look at the sea from the balcony and take a relaxing walk on the beach.
The Anaya community where the hotel is located is closed and managed, and only the owners and hotel guests can enter, so there are few people and quiet. The community is all European-style buildings with a high standard. There are many characteristic public buildings that are check-in points for Internet celebrities, such as the Ayana Auditorium and the Lonely Library.

üîîService: The service of the hotel is very good. Although it is off-season, there are few guests and service staff, but the basic facilities are open, and the requirements of the guests are also met as much as possible.
I booked two rooms, both of which are high-class sea view, after arriving at the store
Added exclusive guest service WeChat. Because it is a CM Gold Card and there are old and young, I was upgraded to two adjacent high-rise deluxe rooms the next day. Welcome fruits, souvenirs, and daily snacks, which are very heartwarming.
Guest Services Cynthia and Natasha have been online and responsive since check-in. Every morning I meet you at the restaurant, and I take the initiative to come to greet you and ask about the check-in situation. When changing rooms, the two girls pushed the luggage cart to help our family carry the luggageüëç, and on the last day, they arranged for the children to go to the horse club to ride ponies.
The service staff encountered in the hotel will take the initiative to say hello. GOs are particularly energetic, and they will greet them warmly if they recognize them. After staying for several days, the children participated in various activities of the club. In the end, almost all the GO I met could call the children's namesüòÇ.
Clubmed's feature is all-inclusive price. We haven't left Anaya in the past few days, and we are staying at the hotel. Every day, children's club activities, parent-child activities, and adult activities are full, and the sports center, swimming pool and hot spring are also open. It won't be boring to stay for a week.
There are four restaurants in the hotel, only two are open in the off-season, and the variety of dishes is relatively small. But if you dine, you can order all four restaurant menus, and we basically don't have the same meal for every meal. I prefer selected Asian restaurants. The quality of Chinese food is good and worthy of the Clubmed brand.

üßπHygiene: The hotel's hygienic conditions are excellent, and it is also of a high standard by the standards of international chain hotels. The cleanliness of the room is very good, and the activity facilities such as swimming pools and hot springs are also relatively clean. Of course, it may be related to the lack of people. The environment of the Anaya community around the hotel is also very good. The streets, greenery, beaches and service places are clean and well managed.

Quite a good family vacation trip. I recommend everyone to come here in the off-season, with fewer people and comfort.

Even if we were locked at home, they actively helped us to contact the vehicle and let us leave smoothly. Really can't say enough about the service of the staff at culb med hotel. The only suggestion is to hope that the hotel will give discounts in the future if the guests cannot leave due to the epidemic, and inform the guests of the latest situation in real time, otherwise the delay and economic losses caused by it are indeed not small, so that the guests can feel more at ease.

You can swim and take a dip. There are also leisure and entertainment such as archery (the foreign coaches are very good, and they also play with the children patiently) table tennis, children's playground, especially if you come with children, you don't have to worry about the children having nothing to play or do. We were 8 adults and 1 child. The room has a direct view of the sea and the beach. The room was clean. All drinks and food in the photo are free. There are also disposable bathtub covers and anti-epidemic supplies. The only thing that makes me feel a little unworthy is the hair dryer, which is kind of an old-fashioned kind of hair that tends to frizz easily. I think you can bring your own if you can. Hahaha. Except for one of the four rooms, the air conditioner was broken, but the problem was solved in time for us. Compensation was also given where needed. The hotel's breakfast is a buffet, and I think there are more types to meet all kinds of needs. We all ate other meals in the canteen in the park, which was pretty good, but everyone should pay attention to the time. The hotel front desk will update the event schedule every day as shown in the figure. Can be arranged according to demand. We were greeted by the hotel's butler from the moment we arrived, and the whole process was also attentive. I am very satisfied with a trip. I would like to come back to enjoy the different Anaya seaside and club med in the summer. I am very grateful to Vicky Cynthia and Natacha who served us this time. They can communicate and solve our problems in a timely manner. Gave little gifts to children. And unexpectedly sent to the heart, lipstick! The children are very happy and we are also very happy~

Recently, the epidemic has been repeated, and I want to relax around with my little sister. I believe in the brand of clubmed, and I have no brains to choose.
üöó Transportation: Self-driving is very convenient, parking spaces are sufficient, and parking is free.
üßπSanitation: The room is very large, clean and comfortable.

üîîService: Vicky communicated with us before we checked in, and met all the girls‚Äô requests and ideas. Cynthia and Natasha were very friendly when checking in, and the handling was very fast. The concierge brother also thoughtfully delivered the luggage to the room . Scott enthusiastically taught us to shoot golf, Ringo chatted with me like a friend, and got a better understanding of the club. Here, there is no sense of alienation from guests and service staff, and there is no need to worry about social fears. It is easy to make friends and feel the beauty and happiness of interacting with people. Thank you to the staff, and I admire their enthusiasm and dedication to their work. Their smiling faces make us feel that this winter is very warm and leave the park with warmth.

üçÉEnvironment: The community in winter does not have the hustle and bustle of summer, and has a cool feeling, which is especially suitable for daze.
The breakfast has a lot of choices and the standard is also good.

Vicky and Seven were very caring and warm service from the beginning of the reservation to the stay. If there is any problem, I will reply and solve it as soon as possible. I also prepared a welcome fruit dessert for the upgraded suite. And red wine, there are also very suitable little tigersüêØ dolls and little tiger gold coin chocolates.

The hotel is exactly as I imagined (and gave us an upgrade to a suite üòÅ) Cynthia and Xiao Zhao Natacha are very good! If there is any contact, I will reply as soon as possible to help solve it. Every day I kindly ask if I need help when I check in, which is really warm.
The balcony of the hotel faces the sea. It is really beautiful to watch the sunrise in the morning. The baby is also very busy participating in various activities. Although the restaurant can only order meals in the off-season, the previous one-price all-inclusive customers also need to pay extra Asian restaurants can also be eaten, the taste is really good, especially the pineapple buns are delicious üòã After I came back, I recommended it to my friends, and the main choice for walking babies is Club med üòÅ

üöó Transportation: The hotel can arrange a pick-up service in the off-season, and the battery car in the hotel can also take you to the place you want to go in the park.
üçÉEnvironment: Sitting in the hotel's Yi bar and ordering a drink, watching the sea and sunset, it's simply wonderful

I was contacted the day before check-in to inform me of the check-in matters. A large plate of welcome fruits and red wine was prepared at the time of check-in, as well as afternoon tea desserts given every afternoon, and special toiletries for children. The details determine the quality, and the service is really excellent. The room was clean and hygienic. Xiao Tang also thoughtfully helped us upgrade the room. Standing on the balcony overlooking the sea, I was relaxed and happy. I watched the sunrise in the morning, and I lay down in the room to watch the sunrise. The activity is also very suitable for children. We praise Tang Shiqi and Xiao Zhao who served us. They are beautiful, gentle and patient. Nice! Looking forward to seeing you next time!

msg:1. Since I booked the hotel, the housekeeper seven contacted me, reminded me of some information about my stay, and asked about my needs. When I brought my child into the hotel, the housekeeper immediately took a bag of snacks and the child had a very good relationship. The connection made the children fall in love with this place instantly. Maybe because it was off-season and the rooms were sufficient, we were pleasantly upgraded to a suite. Since I contacted me before, I said that I wanted to watch the sunrise, so I arranged a super good room for me. The room from the angle, especially thanks to the young lady who actively helped me check in
2. Second, I want to thank Bob, that is really omnipresent. I can strongly feel the care of this little brother. When I bring my baby to eat noodles, he will suddenly appear in the restaurant and ask us if we need anything. Ask What the child wants to eat, then go to help the child to get it, chat with the child, meet her needs around the child, occasionally meet us on the way to the restaurant, accompany us to the restaurant, and then it is as if I bring When the elder brother went to dinner, it was as if someone was covering him. Wechat would reply in seconds when he talked to him, and he would answer like an old friend.
3. In the next few days, I met Natasha, Cynthia... and the brothers and sisters who may not have had time to introduce me. Everyone warmly received us, which really made us feel a sense of being taken care of when we went out. The sense of belonging to take care of, will definitely come again next time
4. On the day of the departure, the baby went to ride a beautiful little white horse named Anna, and agreed to see it next time, the sisters came to see us together, and also gave the baby a bear wearing a hotel T-shirt.
5. The details of the service are reflected everywhere in the room. It is really the most detailed in all the hotels I have stayed in. There are separate toilet bags for babies, brushes and picture books for babies, and all the places you may stay are put away. Water, where there is water, there are water cups, even on the sink, welcome fruits, desserts, red wine, coffee... everything is available, and the quality is guaranteed, the hotel's catering is also strong, and the breakfast can be delivered if the child can't get up. In the room, one price all-inclusive can even eat and play...
I really want to recommend this hotel to all Bao Ma. There are too many details... I even prepared a free coupon for nucleic acid testing... I really thought of what all travelers think... It's amazingüëç
good review and thanks

msg:The location is very good, in the middle of Anaya, the environment is good, the equipment is fully equipped, and it is more suitable for parent-child travel. The breakfast has many varieties and tastes good. Tucao points are also:
1 The room is too small, there is no small table in the room, and the balcony is too narrow (like most suites are)
2 The damping of the door of the room is too small, and the door closes with a bang. The bathroom and bathroom doors are also blocked by additionally welded patches, and they are also banging.
3 The bathing area is not independent, and there is no seaside service (towels, drinks, etc.), you have to learn the services of other seaside resort hotels.
4 The introduction of the hotel could not be found in the room. It is not clear at a glance what projects and services are there.
5. The grade of toiletries is not enough, the level of chain stores.
The overall feeling is the same price, the hotel in Sanya Haitang Bay can live better. That's all that's left for the round-trip airfare.

The cake was super nice and deliciousüòã, and upgraded the original big bed room to a suite. The room includes free buffet breakfast. Red wine, Evian mineral water, fruit plate, dessert, etc.
        The entertainment facilities in the hotel are very complete, including billiard tables, shooting machines, table football, indoor gymnasium, hot springs, rock climbing, swimming pools, etc. Each item is managed by a dedicated person. In the evening, there are also theatrical performances and light shows. In cold weather, you can spend half a day in the hotel and half a day outdoors.

When we arrived at the hotel, we checked in and Vicky took us to our room. Before he came, he called me a lot. I planned to arrange pick-up, welcome food, etc., but I didn't expect any of them to pick up. Then I added a work WeChat, and there are some in the hotel or in the park. Questions can be asked directly on WeChat, which is very convenient.

The view of the hotel is very good, facing the sea, which is the main reason why I chose Club Med among the many hotels and B&Bs in Anaya. It is very close to the beach, and it is only a little walk from the beach to the church. It is very convenient to watch the sunrise, and you can even leave the room. After reading other people's comments, I realized that I was upgraded to a room, but I didn't mention a word üòÇ

You can go down to eat breakfast, or you can check it in advance and deliver it to the room. Maybe because the off-season breakfast is currently semi-self-service, the waiter will deliver it after ordering, and the amount of each meal will be much more than expected.

It is very convenient to go out. Say something at the concierge at the door, and someone will take the battery car to your destination. If you want to come back, you just need to roar on WeChat, and the driver will call when you arrive.

Free nucleic acid testing is provided. Nucleic acid was also done before departure from Shanghai, but was not actually required to show it. Although I know that I don't need to go back to Shanghai, I did it once before I left, for peace of mind.

Hot springs, gyms and swimming pools are free to use, and there are also some hotel activities such as yoga, Pilates or parent-child activities that can be participated at a fixed point every day, and the daily schedule is different.

This three-day, two-night trip was very spontaneous, and I just wanted to have a completely relaxed birthday with my mother. Anaya in winter has sun, sea and snow all at the same time. You can read a book for a day under the sunshine of the lonely library, and you can look up at the sea. You can also sit on a church seat and watch the waves beat for a long time. This place has all the elements of tenderness, and it's hard not to want to come back next time.

In short, thanks to Vicky, Wu Jing and Liu Yangyang for bringing us a very good experience, and also making Club Med the best choice for your next visit to Anaya.

A 5-minute walk to the beach, the location of the beach is also very close to the Anaya Auditorium! In-house guests can renew their tickets for the Auditorium and Lonely Library on the Anaya app in advance!

The facilities and hardware in the hotel are very complete, spa hot spring swimming pool gym, as well as various restaurants. There is even a small video game room, a mahjong room. The hotel also has many family-friendly activities!

And everyone in charge of reception was very welcoming. The hotel also sent red wine desserts and fruit plates, and the little swan on the bed was also full of happiness. It is also very good to have a hot spring in the evening and go to the gym with friends to keep fit. I'm a lazy person, I usually can't get up when I eat breakfast. They took the list and let us choose what we want to eat in advance. And it was delivered in an insulated car, and it was still warm and delicious. When going out to play, there is also a special sightseeing car for the hotel to pick up and drop off, and the whole is tall. Better than the Four Seasons and magnificent service I stayed in before, the room is warm and clean, the bed is very big, and the price is very high. I recommend everyone to come and live, I really don't want to leave. Special thanks to natacha and vicky~ They are really considerate. They arranged a room facing the sea for us, and we can see the sunrise from the balcony.
I really don't like to write reviews for lazy people like me, but I really love this hotel! ! Must come again in summer

Although it was an off-season tour, even though it was winter, the Mediterranean service did not show the desolateness of the off-season and the coldness of winter. I have a new understanding of off-season travel and look forward to the next experience. Ctrip made a temporary reservation. We were taken to the bar and entertainment circle by Xiao Zhao to drink a drink for free while waiting. We learned about the guests' usual drinking habits, presented exquisite hours and wine, found a special car to pick up the high-speed rail station, and made a late check-out. All of this Everything reflects the most professional hospitality spirit of the Mediterranean hotel team. Not worth it.

Anaya is an excellent destination for traveling with babies in China. Not only can the room price be cheap, but also the hotel's one-to-one butler service is really cool and meticulous.
This time I stayed at the top resort in Anaya ‚õ±Ô∏èClub med joyview Beidaihe Mediterranean Gold Coast Resort, the two-day and one-night trip was so happy to take off‚ú®
-
üíôEnvironment
Five-star resort, global chain, quality assurance. The coconut trees in the lobby üå¥ and the beach coast outside the floor-to-ceiling windows üåä have the illusion of passing through Sanya. The resort is very big and there are many rooms, basically all of which can view the sea. All kinds of üé° amusement facilities and üç¥ restaurants are readily available. No wonder it's a resort ‚õ±Ô∏è it really lives up to its nameüëç
üíô room
I booked an ordinary sea view room, and the front desk saw that I was directly upgraded to a suite with my baby. The room has two balconies, both with sea view. The 2-meter big bed is very comfortable, even if you sleep with your baby, it will not be crowded, and you can also add an extra bed for free. The room has a children's hand-washing stool üí∫, a children's toilet üöΩ, children's toiletries, children's bathrobes, etc... It's very considerate üíì Bathing üõÅ is very comfortable, the bathtub is very big, and the baby likes to play with water in it!
üíôService
One-to-one super caring butler service! I have to say that I really want to give a big thumbs upüëç Two days before check-in, the hotel guest relations depar**ent called me to confirm the itinerary and asked about the baby's name, age preference, etc. I made a request for a room upgrade and agreed very readily. .
Welcome fruitsüçâ, red wineüç∑, desserts, snacks, and minibar are all free of charge when you check in the room.
The hotel learned that Douzizizai likes to ride horses, and directly helped me book a free riding experience at the Anaya Horse Club. If you want to know that it takes üí∞150/15min to buy it normally!
Ocean balls, small tents, calf stools are also arranged in the room, as well as graffiti books and small dollsüß∏very niceüíï
When I checked out, I gave me a whole set of toiletries and a baby hat and scarf set, so worth it üâëÔ∏è
üíôChildren's facilities
The resort has family fun spaces, little clubs, mini clubs, teen clubs. Babies over three years old can be managed, which is simply liberating mothers.
The indoor children's play area is very large, the toys are neatly arranged, there will always be someone to clean up, and the staff will accompany the baby to play all the timeü™Ä
There is also an outdoor children's sports play area, digging sand, climbing, slides, balance beams...
There are also cycling, indoor rock climbing, indoor archery, mini golf... There will also be a super interesting evening entertainment show in the evening ü•≥
There are also indoor hot springs ‚ô®Ô∏è and swimming pools are also items that babies love!
The resort üè® will arrange activities üà∂Ô∏è throughout the day, you can participate at any time, and let your baby interact with peers ü§©
üíôBreakfast
The buffet breakfast has a wide variety of Chinese and foreign food. I like to drink a cup of cucumber ü•í celery juice for breakfast, which is very refreshing. The restaurant has large floor-to-ceiling windows, so you can eat breakfast while looking at the sea, which is very comfortable üåø
üíôPrivacy
The key card of the resort is a wristband, and the concierge at the entrance of the resort will check the wristband. Guests who are not staying are not allowed to enter, the privacy is super good, and there will be no mess with many people.

I was very patient with the children during the whole process and was very considerate to our service! Since it is the off-season, we can play whatever we want. Every waiter greets us enthusiastically when they see us, and the aunt who cleans the room is meticulous and caring. The butler Yangyang was even more considerate. Knowing that we had brought two children, he also helped to upgrade the suite and prepared fruits for the children. Such a good place will definitely come often. This time we are a trip where adults are more enjoyable than children~

Transportation: We passed from Qinhuangdao Railway Station. It takes about 1 hour by taxi. If the train schedule is convenient, you can go to Beidaihe Station, which is a little closer.
Location: Very close to the beach, downstairs is the beach, not far from Dune Art Museum and Anaya Auditorium, Lonely Library, just a few minutes walk away.
Catering: We booked a room with breakfast. It may be due to the epidemic and the off-season. Breakfast can be ordered the day before and delivered to the room, or you can go to the restaurant to order food. It's also very good. In addition to breakfast, I had a simple lunch at Jingchu Asian Restaurant. It tasted good and the price was similar to that of restaurants in big cities.
Room facilities: According to the introduction, the resort was opened in 2017, but the decoration and furnishings of the rooms are quite new. The upgraded luxurious deluxe room has a large area, separates the bathroom from dry and wet, has a large balcony, and has a very good view. , I also prepared an anti-epidemic package with alcohol, bath bags, etc., which is very considerate.
Focus on service: Cynthia from the Guest Relations Depar**ent called the day before check-in and asked carefully what fruits and drinks he likes, and whether the itinerary meets the epidemic prevention requirements, which makes people feel warm. On the day of check-in, I arranged a car to pick us up at the hotel I had previously checked in. When booking, I noted that I wanted a high-level room. When I arrived at the store, I found that we not only arranged the highest ninth floor for us, but also upgraded our room. The little handsome guy in the concierge helped us. Luggage has been delivered to the room, Cynthia little beauty introduced us to the room facilities in detail. In the room facing the sea, you can lie on the bed and watch the sunrise, enjoying the snacks and fruit drinks prepared by the hotel in advance. During the two days in the resort, Miss Wang Mengyao who cleaned the room was like a snail girl. We hardly saw her, but when we came back after breakfast, the room was cleaned up, and even the clothes that were thrown around were folded for us. Alright; I wandered outside at noon and came back with refreshments and fruits; when I came back from the hot spring in the evening, I turned the bed down again and gave me snacks. Although I can't see her, I can feel her meticulous care.
During my stay in the resort, I really felt the enthusiasm of every staff member. I would say hello politely when I met in the corridor. Cynthia would ask about our staying experience and what we need from time to time. The concierge, the restaurant, the swimming pool, and the bar, the staff everywhere are polite and patient.
In short, the off-season ClubMed Joyview Gold Coast Resort is the king of cost-effectiveness, and the sea in winter has a special flavor. If you have the opportunity, you will go to ClubMed Joyview Gold Coast Resort again.

The location is excellent, with a sea view, you can watch the sea and listen to the waves while lying in bed. It is very close to the Anaya Auditorium and Lonely Library. The sanitation, environment and service are absolutely first-class, and the supporting facilities are perfect. The beautiful girl at the front desk, Miss Tang, is warm and thoughtful. She is so warm that she wants to be a daughter. Because of the epidemic, it is off-season, so breakfast is buffet on Saturdays and Sundays. Usually a la carte is understandable, but I just think that the breakfast price is a la carte. It should be lowered accordingly. After all, the choice of meals is small and the cost is low, but the specifications of the buffet are still quite high, with a wide variety and exquisite variety. Thanks to the hotel for upgrading our room types, decorating the room with care, and giving us red wine and cakes to make our wedding anniversary more ceremonial. Thanks üôè

msg:We are very satisfied with the hotel we stayed at this time. We are a family of six and have two babies. Miss Tang Shiqi in the concierge is very warm and caring. She saw that we have a baby and upgraded us to the suite. She also arranged for us to accompany us in two rooms next to us. We went upstairs to help us carry our luggage, and the GOs here also surprised us. The show arrangements for the children are very meaningful. We took the baby to make ice cream and we played games, danced and sang. The children had a great time playing. I went to bed early in the evening, which made us adults worry a lot. Since there was a meeting on Monday, we only stayed for one day, but the child still wanted to go swimming and soaking in the hot spring. Do we delay? Miss sister immediately agreed to help us delay until three o'clock. Fortunately, the young lady helped us delay the room, which made our trip very enjoyable and enjoyable. It is really troublesome to bring the children out. But this time I really feel a lot more relaxed. Thank you very much for the little beauty Tang Shiqi of your hotel for giving us a lot of help. Secondly, I also want to thank the kind and enthusiastic GOs of the hotel for taking us and our children to play very happily although in winter But the room is really too warm. The sun shines directly on the balcony at noon. It is very comfortable. Besides, the breakfast is also very rich. Lunch and dinner can be eaten in the restaurant of the hotel. The value for money is also very high. For our wine, cakes, desserts, and fruit plates. The babies love the cakes so much. Before I can react and take pictures, they will all be eaten. Anyway, we will choose CLUB Med next time.

üöó Transportation: Follow the navigation to make it easy to find. The park has completed registration of license plates. The location of the hotel has to be said, jeopardy. It should be the biggest hotel prospect. üòÇ
The location of the hotel belongs to the first class, just by the beach, go downstairs to the beach. A group of small umbrellas were seen between the rooms. Wake up early to watch the sunrise and go downstairs to get up. After watching, go straight to the beach for breakfast.


üçÉEnvironment: Later, I also walked around the famous accommodation in the town. I feel that clubmed has the highest comprehensive index. The nature of the hotel, all aspects of services are in place. It is the off-season ambient temperature, staff service, and breakfast arrangements are still the quality of the peak season.
You can just look at the pictures in the soft decoration of the room, not to lose the designer homestay.
I have to say that the room access card is too cute!! Pink bracelet!!!

I don‚Äôt want to repeat the others. The turn-down service that a five-star hotel should have, a welcome fruit plate champagne, bedtime snacks, and other services are available. Excellent value for money.
Oh, oh, and the butler can still contact people on WeChat at 11 o'clock. If you come back late, you can forget your room number and someone will answer the phone. Thank you Cynthia and Wu Jing~

There are two TVs in the suite. Adults and children choose their favorite channels separately. It's not too happy. The room is also large enough, with hidden storage in the cloakroom, which is very cleverly designed. The decoration style of the whole room is very attractive, and every inch of light from the sea surface is a landscape.
Room view:
Lying on the bed of the sea view suite and watching the sunrise, I realized why it is called joy view. The scenery in front of me is healing and beautiful.

They praised Liu Yangyang and Dawn from the Guest Relations Depar**ent with real names. Before check-in, Yangyang called to ask about the children's age and preferences and what needs to be prepared in advance. He felt the meticulous and thoughtful service and prepared welcome fruits, desserts and drinks in advance. After checking in, Yang Yang kept sending us to the guest room and introduced the room facilities. The whole process was gentle and smiled. Although wearing a mask, it is still difficult to stop her enthusiasm and elegance, which is like a spring breeze.
There is also the guest relationship Xiao Tang, who met her at the restaurant for two consecutive days at breakfast, and went to the table to ask about dining feelings and opinions. When he saw children, he would squat down and chat with the children, and he treated the elderly with great enthusiasm and meticulousness.
In addition, there are GO‚Äôs sister Kitty and sunny sister, mini
In the club session, the children feed the ponies, draw pictures, dance... patiently and enthusiastically, I can see that they like children so much, and they love their work content from the bottom of their hearts.
The concierge, the restaurant, the swimming pool, and the bar, the staff everywhere are courteous, patient and thoughtful.
In short, the Clubmed Gold Coast Resort in the off-season is the king of cost-effectiveness, and the sea in winter is also unique. Because of the wonderful experience of this trip, we are going to do it again next month!

In the evening, go to Yi Bar for a drink to watch the show and dance with GO. My kids are relatively timid, it would be perfect if they could host the miniclub. Every time I come to Anaya, I live with clubmed, all-inclusive price is super worry-free. This time, my husband told me that it would be better to come here a few days before going to Universal Studios. Before moving in, Cynthia specifically contacted me with the number of the invited license plate and entered the park directly when he arrived in Anaya. Specially helped us upgrade the suite, and delivered red wine and fruit as soon as we entered the room. It is a very pleasant journey. To summarize the two main reasons clubmed attracts me, 1. The kids dig sand on the beach. 2. Joy view GO has a lot of activities at night, dancing at night to decompress

The ladies in charge of guest relations are super enthusiastic. Not only have they upgraded the room type, but the room is super romantic when you stay.

msg:Check-in time: December 3, 2021
Occupancy: Two large and one small

Address: By car, navigate to "Aranya", the hotel is in a prominent location near the sea.
Transportation: The hotel has a parking lot. There is a shuttle bus every 15 minutes on the main road in the Anaya Park. It is convenient to go anywhere.
Room Type: Due to the off-season, Miss Yangyang at the front desk directly helped us upgrade to a suite on the 9th floor. The view is beautiful and the room is comfortable. She also carefully prepared various supplies for the children. The children are happy and we are comfortable.
Food: Since we chose a one-price all-inclusive package, we have unlimited supply from food to beverages. Although only two of the four restaurants are open during the off-season, the restaurants that are not open still offer menus that can be ordered, which can be said to be very good. Humanized! The handsome manager Chen from the Chinese restaurant, the service is very attentive, my daughter likes him very much; and the female manager of the international restaurant also makes us feel very warm~
Facilities: There are various entertainment facilities, so I will not list them one by one. The hot spring must be experienced, facing the sea comfortably~ The children‚Äôs various activities are arranged too rich! Girl Helen and Brother Xiao Ma take my daughter I went to feed the pony. The Kitty girl took my daughter to do the handicraft. She was so happy! There are also many activities with the Singaporean sister and the Indonesian brother. The go staff surprised us very much. We hosted for the whole afternoon. I was completely relieved. This This kind of service is too convenient to liberate moms and dads! Please experience it!!
Service: Fully in line with high-standard first-class international hotel standards, considerate, warm and comfortable, and can respond to various needs in a timely manner and solve perfectly anytime, anywhere!
Suggestion: To be honest, I have read a lot of bad reviews on Ctrip. All of them are the opinions on the service during the peak season and the questions raised due to the aging of hotel facilities. Regarding the former, I can only say that if possible, I will try to come in off-season , And the latter, I personally feel that it is a hotel that has been in operation for a period of time. Naturally, it cannot be compared with a new hotel. I hope that the operator can consider maintaining and updating some of the facilities~

Finally, I would like to say that as a mother with a 5-year-old baby and her husband to spend the 10th anniversary of their wedding, this hotel gave me a wonderful and unforgettable memory.

The hotel was finally arranged in ClubMed facing the sea. Before booking, I called the hotel to understand the situation of the hotel and its surroundings. The staff was very responsible. At the same time, we also asked us to carry a 48-hour accounting test and normal itinerary code, because there are many The customer cannot check in because of the itinerary code issue.
We started from Tianjin and went there by car. The hotel has its own parking lot for easy luggage collection. When we checked into the hotel, I felt that the staff knew about our arrival, and the enthusiastic Nicole also showed us the location of the room. When you open the door, there are already prepared fruits and desserts on the table. Outside the window is a "lonely" beach, which can be said to be a great view of the sunrise.
The configuration in the room is quite complete, capsule coffee machine, bathtub, and Boss Bluetooth speakers, really suitable for all ages! Breakfast is in the hotel. Because the occupancy rate is not high, the buffet breakfast has also been changed to a la carte. The service staff in the restaurant are very hard. .
We were lucky enough to catch up with the opening of the Lonely Library and the auditorium. The little brother in the concierge drove us to the attractions we wanted to go to. Andy was afraid that we would not be able to come back by ourselves at night, and left the phone for me. When we need to pick up, You can contact him by phone.
ClubMed's service is indeed well-deserved. For the reason of the epidemic, it is expected that the originally low travel will turn out to be very good. Say a few names I remember, Nicole, Seven, Cynthia and Andy. Thank you very much for providing us with an unforgettable memory.

Great location! The better one is homestay type, the comfort is unmatched!

msg:Before coming to the must-stay hotel in Anaya, this trip brought my parents to stay for a while. The experience was very disappointing! ! !

-Service: Check-in is super slow. I am the only person at the front desk to check in. I don‚Äôt know why the coordination back and forth is particularly inefficient. I took my parents to play and booked two rooms, but only one room had welcome fruit. . There are no signs of disinfection and cleaning in the room, nor are there any anti-epidemic cleaning supplies such as masks in the room last year. . . Service standards have dropped a lot! I called the front desk to ask for dental kits and cotton pads. I waited for almost an hour and no one paid any attention to it... Absolutely

-Hygiene: I don't know why the towels and bathrobes are very dirty, the color of gray is like a rag. Without the quality of ClubMed at all, the bathrobe is even more torn in the collar... I must have lived at Home.

-Facilities in the room: The curtains are probably shrunk after washing, there is a big gap from the ground, the kind of big gap that can illuminate the whole house! It affects sleep and rest! and! There is no AHAVA toiletries in the room, and it is replaced with an unknown brand of toiletries. The pump head is particularly difficult to press, and it can only be pressed out a little at a time...

The all-round experience of this trip can be said to have a negative score. Apart from being close to the sea, there are really no other advantages. . I arrived three days before the peak period of the small holiday. There are not many people in the park. I am afraid that I would not even dare to move in during the peak period of the holiday. . . ClubMed, the world‚Äôs worst experience, really appreciates it.

Old parents with separation anxiety are cured by the intimate GO Lily teacher‚Äôs videos and text messages one by one. Professional services open up a whole new world for their children. , The daily schedule of activities is also rich and interesting, GO is the king of kids!
2. The sand is fine and the sea water is not cold. You can still go to the sea in early September. Every day is half a day of water and sand activities. The children are never tired and bravely try. They also learned to hold their breath against the sea. The sea sand here far surpasses Qingdao where Enteromorpha is everywhere in July.
3. Staggered trips, fewer people are happy, and the service is better! Before noon, Natacha called to inform us that it was possible to move in. I had a request for View and directly upgraded the room type for us, so that the children live and play more enjoyable. I wanted to continue the stay, but later returned to Beijing that night for some reason. The duty manager Brain was especially compassionate and extended the check-out time for us so that the children could play and rest better~~

msg:I took my wife to Anaya to stay at the Gold Coast Hotel last weekend. I have time to write a review after working for a week.
1. Advantages: This hotel is located in Nandaihe Anaya Resort, which is part of the development of the resort. It is surrounded by villas, bungalows and high-rises sold by Anaya. The community environment is good, with Tuscan style, which is more suitable for literary and artistic style. The crowd came to play. So the main things you can play in the hotel are the facilities of Anaya, including private beaches, various sports fields, racetracks (low cost performance), and outdoor swimming pools (free of charge).
2. Anaya community: There are some petty-bourgeois-style restaurants and supermarkets in the community. The prices are more expensive and the taste is not as good as Beijing. So we still drive to Nandaihe District to eat seafood food stalls. After all, we are from a big city. It‚Äôs not about changing places to eat restaurants. As for the residents of the community, I think the most expensive house here is also cheaper in Beijing. Therefore, if residents eat this type of restaurant every day, they may not be able to afford it. In terms of living and shopping, the two supermarkets don‚Äôt have much stuff. Take the Wumart route. In summary, Anaya is a community suitable for weekend getaways, and the hotel cooperates with the sale of houses.
3. Disadvantages: We prefer to travel on vacation. We have been to more luxury resorts in China. We live in more five-star hotels for work reasons. We are senior members of several big-name groups.
1. Some of the hotel facilities are only open to the owners of Anaya, such as the study room, understandable, but it is best not to put it in the hotel. This hotel does not have temporary office places like executive lounges or business rooms. The only self-study found The room is only open to the owner.
2. The room is cost-effective. The average price is 2000 ordinary ocean view rooms. In addition to a bathtub, other facilities are at the level of Atour. There is no writing desk, no sofa, and only a recliner. The TV often breaks. The room is not soundproof. The two young people next to me have two activities every night. We were forced to listen in the whole process, which was very embarrassing. The bathtub is not designed with a bathtub bag, so I dare not use it.
3. The hotel does not do anti-mosquito projects in summer. At present, domestic luxury resort hotels will regularly do anti-mosquito elimination in summer. There are a lot of mosquitoes here. If you accidentally open the balcony door at night and do not open the screen window in time, a dozen mosquitoes will come in all at once, and they will be beaten while listening to the movement of the human body next door.
4. There are two large parking lots at the entrance of the hotel. It says hotel parking. Generally, guests who come here are traveling by car. Before we checked in, we called and recorded the license plate, which is similar to other resort hotels, and it feels good. but! When you leave, tell you to pay the parking fee, 40 yuan a day~ Record your license is the community security requirement, the parking space is community, and the hotel can't manage it. This kind of feeling is that you think he treats you nicely, and the other side slaps you twice in the backhand.

The overall feeling, Sanya Anaya 100, Beijing Yanqing Forest Anaya 90, here 80.

There are various activities accompanied by children, and the GO. The sea and the beach in Qinhuangdao are average, but it is also very comfortable to stroll around the community in Anaya.

msg:First of all, let‚Äôs talk about the hotel. The location of the hotel is super convenient. It‚Äôs a lawn beach when you get out of the elevator. It‚Äôs suitable for bringing children, especially if they suddenly want to play something. It‚Äôs convenient to go back to the room at any time. I thought, the hotel also has a shuttle bus. You can pick up and drop off anywhere you want in the community. It‚Äôs very convenient. You don‚Äôt have to wait in a long queue for a ten-minute park bus, and you may not be able to get on... The hotel has a parking place, but listen. It is said that after the 26th, visitors to the Anaya community will charge a fee, and the hotel can't help it. . . There are many things suitable for children in the hotel, such as archery, rock climbing, inflatable castles, swimming pools, slides, and there are also activities and projects suitable for children to play. Every day there will be a schedule of activities for the day, and the schedule for the next day will be updated in the evening. We, Xiaobao, are a little bit young at 2 years old, and many of them can‚Äôt play by themselves, but the mini club can still be hosted and played, and the fee is also acceptable üòä.
Secondly, let‚Äôs talk about breakfast. It‚Äôs good. Freshly squeezed fruit juice and vegetable juice are recommended. There are many people in line, but the waiter who squeezes the juice is very fast. Children and adults like it.
Furthermore, let‚Äôs talk about the room. We booked for three nights. Fortunately, we upgraded the suite. It was very spacious and clean. The view was super nice. Standing on the balcony, we could see the sea. It was very beautiful. The room facilities are very complete, there is a coffee machine, the minibar is free, our child is young, the hotel has added an extra bed, the child loves to sleep, hahaha!
Room suggestion: The only worry is the corners of the room. It is recommended that the hotel put up the anti-collision *****s, and the children run around, a little worried.
Finally, talking about the beach, I thought there were a lot of people during the summer, but I didn't feel that there were so many people after playing. Maybe there are more things to play in the hotel, and the other is that the coastline is longer and the people are scattered. We have very good weather these days, the sea, the beach, and the moonlight are all beautiful~ Little Swing likes it~ This time we booked the lonely library and the auditorium, but they didn‚Äôt go in, because children under 6 years old are not allowed to enter. It's because some adults feel that the children are noisy and quarrel with them, so they will not let the children in after many complaints. These adults are really unqualified, and the hotel's free ticket is wasted...
It is recommended for families with babies to come here. The kids like the beach, sea and this hotel very much. Before leaving, I still said, Dad, you can get some money, I want to stay in the hotel, hahaha!

The Chinese restaurant tastes online too, there is no noisy traffic. The hotel is just as the Yellow River enters the sea. It takes only ten minutes to walk to the auditorium.
The hotel has its own swimming pool and it is also the only swimming pool in Anaya that is not open to the public. It is really rare and clean during the summer vacation.
Hot spring bubbles to wash away fatigue, hotel spa can also try it, the impression is very satisfactory all day

The staff is thoughtful in service, the rooms are warm and clean, the small bed design is very popular with children, and the view of the sea view auditorium is also winning. The breakfast is plentiful and the noodle shop is suitable for children and the elderly. The swimming pool is also clean and hygienic. Recommend, will patronize in the future.

At three o'clock in the check-in, it was done early in the morning, and fortunately, I upgraded to a suite for free with an extra bed. Invincible sea view. I don't want to stay in a homestay mainly because the service and sanitation can't keep up. Only when a housewife lives in a hotel can I enjoy the feeling of the host.
Hotel service is very good. Downstairs is the beach. Compared with the situation where restaurants in the park open late and close early, hotel services are still trustworthy. fully equipped. It is said to be the only hotel with its own parking lot.

The state of the room is at home-like level at best, and the price/performance ratio is not good. And the hygiene of the room is too worrying, there is dirt under the dressing table, and the bathroom hair is in twos and threes..., don't you take care of hygiene? There is no anti-collision bar on the glass leading to the balcony, and the child can easily bump into it, that is, the child is fine, otherwise you will have something to do. No one answered the front desk phone for 15 minutes, and asked the concierge to call and there was still no one. During the checkout peak, can't you have more people? Can't settle an account in 20 minutes! Call a laundry, but I don‚Äôt know if it can be charged, don‚Äôt you guys train it? Of course, the service staff in the guest rooms, restaurants, and bars are very enthusiastic and worthy of praise.

msg:It can be said that Club med is amazing to me. After booking the hotel, I went to the front desk and added an all-inclusive package. It is very reasonable and a very comfortable experience. The children are super happy, especially when they are sent to the mini club for a day, it‚Äôs just fun. crazy. You can choose from three restaurants for lunch and dinner after the all-inclusive price. I was tired of the buffet. I chose the Yiran restaurant on the first floor. I wanted to order some burgers and simple meals. Let the kids go and play, but I didn‚Äôt expect burgers. After cooking for a full hour, the French fries on the side table took 40 minutes to serve. The kid couldn't wait to eat some salad and went to play first. The burger came up, why not let it be packed? Isn't this a waste? Not only was it a waste of food but also a waste of time. The waiter didn't say to wait so long. To be honest, the taste is really good. Friends who want to go to this restaurant can recommend it if they are not in a hurry. It is a pity that they are afraid of delaying time.

msg:The first time I stayed in the superior sea view room of Club Med Hotel in Anaya. The price is 3775 per night. The hotel looks very beautiful. I feel bad breathing when I enter the room. The room is too small and too suffocated. There is only a single small sofa child to sit on. Yes, adults have no place to stay. The introduction is five-star. From the corridor decoration to the furniture and supplies in the room, there is no sense of luxury. The towels are severely shed. The child and my nose are itchy. The service is not bad. I don‚Äôt feel good, and the bath water is not big. I‚Äôm really worried that my long hair has not been washed. Living in such a room does not feel like a holiday. It is expensive and not the right choice. The room is seriously inconsistent with the price. not worth!

In addition, there are full schedules for adults and children to participate in every day, some are free, and there are wonderful performances on the bar stage every night. Acrobatic singing and dancing, interactive games, are all rehe****d by the hotel staff in their spare time. The hotel also provides custody services. You can sign up for ages 2-17. From morning to night, you can eat, drink and have fun in group activities. Once you prepare your backpack, you can send it to the "kindergarten", and your parents can be completely released. The hotel is very friendly to small friends, the room card provided is wristband type, waterproof and convenient, and children are also available; what I like most is a small bed that can be pulled out from under the big bed, which is short and convenient for children. Give adults a good night's sleep. Everywhere shows the child's little master consciousness. The service is also top-notch, the staff will take the initiative to greet you when they see you, and give me a small gift after checking out, perfect...

msg:For the time being, I wanted to visit Anaya before the summer vacation officially began. At first, I was worried that the rush of travel would make the trip full of regrets, but I was determined to see that Anaya has a club med.
First of all, Anaya is not far from the airport and the railway station. We went there by plane. It takes 40 minutes to get there by taxi from the airport (for online taxi, please report the license plate to the hotel in advance). Go to the store at around 18:00. When checking in, I asked the front desk about the extra bed and got a positive reply. When we got to the room, the extra bed was firmly placed on the side of the double bed. I praised the efficiency of the service staff.
The mini club in the hotel can host children over 4 years old. My baby has been hosting for two and a half days, which is not enough. Every day, I can‚Äôt wait to find teachers Helen, Mango and Cherry to play! Activities are not repeated every day, and the teacher manages them well. Under the premise of paying attention to the safety of the children, let the children play as much as possible, which saves parents a lot of worries.
The hotel has its own beach. From the first floor, there is the sea. There are many swings to play. Every room can see the sea, which is also great.
Although the hotel's facilities are not as designed as a homestay, and the overall layout is relatively old-fashioned, it is definitely the first choice if you bring your children over to play!

Two single mattresses with a big gap in the middle! The house is full of all kinds of bedding products! Later, an incomprehensible male manager came in, patted his chest and said, "We have been making large beds together for the past three years. It is normal for there to be a gap in the middle of the bed. There is nothing we can do about it!" If you don't accept it, you can check out and leave! I'm so ****ing excited! After Ctrip coordinated for half an hour, the reply was that the service manager could not be found, and he had to either stay or change to a nearby hotel! The unidentified secretions on the sofa in the living room are so obvious that people dare not sit down. I really hope that the Mediterranean Hotel will continue like this! come on! üëéüëéüëé

It was four o'clock in the afternoon and the hotel requested that you can check in after three o'clock in the afternoon. The reason was that the other double bed rooms had not been cleaned. , I was offered a twin bed to make one bed, I said I didn‚Äôt accept it, and then said that there was a double bed. This happened for about 30 seconds. When I went upstairs, I found that the room was still a twin bed. Please note the double bed room type at that time. When I made the reservation, the price was different from the double bed price. It was like tricking me into the room. In the end, I said with a smile on my face that the hotel's double bed rooms also have twin beds. Which five-star hotel does not have a double bed?
Secondly, the soundproofing of the hotel is the worst among the hotels I have ever stayed in, including the guest house. You can watch the video and you can clearly hear the vacuum cleaner next door when it is being cleaned. The next door neighbor speaks as if he is in your ear at one o'clock in the morning. These are all the doors and windows of my room. Regarding the closure, Clubmed really couldn't live up to its reputation. I called the front desk at night to get feedback, but nothing happened. The difference in service and sound insulation level is unprecedented
Secondly, the hotel did not check the health code and travel code when checking in and out. I stayed for three days and did not check it even once.
In the end, breakfast guests can open the fire escape to enter at will. The sea breeze blows directly into the restaurant, and the waiter turns a blind eye to it.

If you are someone who goes to bed early or wakes up late, I would not recommend staying here, especially if you want to go on vacation.
