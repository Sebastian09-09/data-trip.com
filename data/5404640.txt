I checked in at almost 17:00 that afternoon and got the room quickly. Overall, the room was good, but the difference from expectation was the free upgrade. There is a cloakroom in the room and an electronic scale. The hotel has a swimming pool, but we didn’t bring swimsuits, so we didn’t go check it out.
This time, the hotel was mainly used for rest and we didn’t want to use its attached facilities. Moreover, the hotel also allowed us to check out late, which was really nice. So for us, the fly in the oin**ent is "**takeaway cannot be delivered to the room", but we understand that this is one of the ways to ensure our safety.

In addition, I would like to give the hotel staff a good review. In particular, Ms. Gu Bing at the front desk had a very good service attitude, arranged a nice room, and was very patient in explaining. Her adaptability is very good. We sometimes speak Cantonese and Mandarin, and she can clearly answer us in the corresponding language, which truly makes us experience high-quality service. At the same time, unexpectedly, this situation made my daughter realize that work is not easy, feel the importance of language, and confirm the necessity of learning. Miss Gu Bing, thank you!

Even during the peak season during the National Day holiday, we were upgraded to a suite for free, and there was no additional charge for breakfast for the children. The room is large in size, well-equipped with facilities, and the air conditioning is strong, but there is a strong smell of disinfectant when you first enter the room. The breakfast buffet has a variety of varieties and tastes good. It is worth recommending. The swimming pool should be shared between the hotel and the neighboring residential complex. It is divided into indoor and outdoor areas. The outdoor swimming pool has a special area for children. The water quality is good and the children had a lot of fun.

The room is large enough, the air conditioner is cool enough, the furnishings are elegant enough, and there are USB sockets on both sides of the bed, which is very convenient. The indoor lighting is sufficient, the sanitary conditions are ideal, and the view overlooks Talent Park, Chunxun and Shenzhen Bay Bridge. The indoor and outdoor swimming pools are large enough, the swimming pool is wide enough, and the breakfast is rich. This hotel is cost-effective. I will stay here again next time.

msg:I came to Shenzhen citywalk with my one-year-old baby and chose Haishang Hotel because it was close to Shenzhen Bay Park. After staying there, I felt that the price/performance ratio was very high and it was a treasure hotel. Let me break down the points of satisfaction:
1. Friendly service. First, they directly upgraded me to a suite with a sofa. My baby’s favorite thing in the room is to lie on the sofa and look at the cars downstairs (babies like to look at cars), and he keeps screaming excitedly. Second, we did our homework in advance and knew that the hotel provided cribs. The waiter quickly brought the beds. The beds were new and easy to use. Third, a midnight snack was delivered at night (pure milk ➕ daily nuts), which was unexpected.
2. The room is comfortable. The interior of the house has a retro style, and the facilities are not too new, but they are neat and clean, making you feel as relaxed as at home. There is a broad view outside the window, overlooking Shenzhen Bay. (By the way, it is right next to the Shenzhen Bay Port. I am considering staying here if I go to Hong Kong in the future). In addition, the air is more circulated and there is no musty smell in the corridor.
3. Convenient transportation. Across the road downstairs is the Shenzhen Talent Park. After we checked in and settled down in the afternoon, we went out to visit the park. I have to say that Shenzhen really attaches great importance to park construction.
All in all, Haishang Hotel left a good impression on me. I would also recommend it to friends and family who need to stay in a hotel in Nanshan.

The service staff were not very clear and did not understand the surrounding environment and location. The only advantage is that the indoor swimming pool is good, but unfortunately it can only be used once a day, and it is shared with the community behind it.

The disadvantages are also obvious. There is nothing for breakfast at 9:30, and the waiters don’t take the initiative to clean up the table when they stand together. Ask them to clean up the dishes and clean up the dishes without cleaning the table at all (see this picture) , Let him wipe it and say it's the only way? ? ? Simply! At this level, a Samsung on the side of the road will not be like this.
I gave a shower gift box in the evening. It looks great, but it’s really not easy to use. The owner of the hair conditioner can try how to pour it out. Anyway, it took me a long time to get my hands red. Use one out. . .

What's more, the view outside the room is great, you can see the sea (and Hong Kong on the other side) and watch the sunrise, it's awesome👏

The most surprising thing was in the room: I booked a suite and noted that I would bring a 2-year-old child with me when I checked in. When I checked in, I found everything from toiletries to ball pools, drawing boards, tents, chess pieces, tents, toilet racks, and clothes hangers. , slippers are arranged exclusively for children, it is really a super caring hotel! Kids had fun 🥳

The hotel's catering, reservation by phone, takeaway in the form of eating in the room, you can also get 15% off, the taste is also great 👍😋

In short, if I have the opportunity to come to Shenzhen, I will stay here again!

I called the front desk to ask for two more bottles of water and they were delivered immediately within 5 minutes. It is very important to have an overhead shower in the shower room. After hearing about the disgusting behavior of some *** using handheld showers, I pay special attention to whether the hotel is equipped with an overhead shower, clean and sanitary. The breakfast variety is quite complete, Western bread, grilled sausage, salad, cake, Chinese fried dough sticks, soy milk, soup, noodles, fried noodles, fried rice, etc. are all very good. The room has a bed and can see the swimming pool. It is quiet. It is also very convenient to call a taxi at the door. It is 1.4 kilometers away from Coast City, where there are all kinds of food and shopping. Next time I come to Shenzhen for tourism, I will stay here again. I forgot to take pictures of the hotel room, here are some beautiful pictures of Shenzhen

Whether swimming indoors or outdoors, I felt very comfortable and relaxed. The kids loved it so much that they went to the swimming pool three times during the 2 days they stayed.
Secondly, the washing machine in the room can help clean the swimsuit for reuse the next day.

Other than that, the hotel service is fast and the staff are very polite. No matter what needs or questions I had, they were always there to help.

The food served in the hotel restaurant is also very delicious. Whether it was breakfast, lunch or dinner, I tasted a variety of well-crafted delicacies. Their menu has a variety of choices to suit my taste.

In addition, the hotel's transportation is very convenient, especially close to Baoneng Taikoo Shing. It only takes 15 minutes to walk to Shenzhen Bay Port, which is very convenient for me.

Overall, my stay at Shenzhen Bay Haishang Hotel was very pleasant. I was very pleased with the excellent indoor and outdoor pools, fast and courteous service, delicious restaurant food, and easy access to transportation. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others.

msg:Some time ago, I went to Shenzhen to do business. Since I used to live in Shekou, I wanted to stop by and have a look. Searching for hotels on Ctrip, I found that Haishang Hotel has very good reviews in all aspects, but the price is a little expensive. After the real check-in, I found that the extra 200 yuan is still very worthwhile. Wang Xiaochun at the front desk is very nice. After learning about my situation, he enthusiastically helped me upgrade to a sea view room facing Shenzhen Bay, which made my trip to Shenzhen very happy, thank him very much!

The hotel is located in the center of Shenzhen Bay. The hotel facilities are great, the rooms are big and clean, and the hotel staff are very professional. The next day I forgot to update my room card and couldn't open the door. The front desk staff also took the initiative to go upstairs and give me the new room card.

The transportation around the hotel is convenient. The nearest subway station is Haiyue Station, which can be reached in 10 minutes on foot and 3 minutes by bicycle. Within a 3-minute walk, there is a large nucleic acid sampling site.

It is highly recommended for customers who have certain requirements for the hotel!

msg:I came to study near Shenzhen Bay. Because of the epidemic, I didn't dare to live too far, so I found a business hotel near the class point. Originally, I was thinking that the price of this business hotel is a little expensive compared to other places. But after staying, it was still very good.
On the first day, every time you enter the hotel, you must display the green code, the itinerary code, and take a photo. The next day was the same, which made our foreign guests feel at ease and less worried about the epidemic.
I was upgraded to a suite for free when I checked in. Although the decoration of the room is old-fashioned, tough guys like my husband are happy. The room is big, and there are only a few problems. The glass door of the bathroom and the wooden door of the toilet cannot be opened at the same time, and they will touch each other. The water pressure in the shower was a bit low. Nothing else is wrong for a business hotel.
In terms of hygiene, because of the epidemic and personal cleanliness, I don't like other people entering the room after I check in. I have tried in other business hotels even if I call the front desk to clean up, I will enter the room and clean it up. Here, I really refill and put the products at the bar at the door according to my request. If I don’t enter the room, the soft drinks will be replenished when I go back. This is very good.
The Chinese restaurant downstairs is very cost-effective, especially during the epidemic, there is no food on the road. It only serves the guests here, and it is safe and hygienic. Should the beauty manager of a restaurant be a manager? I forgot to ask my name, so I took a photo of the far away, who is very beautiful, who is very attentive, speaks very softly, and explains how to order dishes in place.
After checking out, because I had to wait for my husband to go to the nucleic acid test after class, I waited in the lobby. Because I couldn't get a car, I wanted to go to the high-speed rail station. The front desk in the lobby also checked it out to help me explain which high-speed rail station to go to is less risky. Then Xiao Li, who helped me with the management, saw that I was waiting alone, chatted with me for a day when there were no guests, asked if we had any opinions, and introduced the nucleic acid point of the hotel. Afraid of the heat on our way home, water was also provided.
The hotel is less expensive in terms of service, I think it is acceptable.

The breakfast happened to be discounted. There are both Chinese and Western food. The variety is very rich, and the chef can cook chaos. We even had lunch at the restaurant, and we even offered a discount when we stayed at the hotel, which was really fragrant.

At that time, I didn't have any consciousness to deal with the water on the entire bathroom floor. I finally reminded her that the ground was slippery, please take care of it, so that the child would not slip, so she went to fetch the floor and wipe it. It was hard to get a rest, but the front desk called at 10 o'clock in the morning to say that the floor drain was repaired. I refused because it prevented the child from resting. The lady at the front desk has been disturbing, when will they be repaired. This service is truly incredible.

The hotel is clean and the breakfast is rich. Special thanks to Mr. Xu of the job number 2028, who gave a lot of help and patiently answered every question I had, so that I could check in smoothly. If I have the opportunity to come to Shenzhen in the future, I will also stay at Haishang.

msg:The superior twin room that I originally booked has a washing machine, but it seems to have simple kitchen equipment. The hotel said that it was not available. It helped me to upgrade it to a deluxe twin room with a cloakroom, but there was no washing machine and kitchen equipment. For me It's not an upgrade, it's a downgrade. Later, the hotel's service attitude was still good, and I was upgraded to a deluxe suite, one room and one living room, but there is still no washing machine and kitchen equipment. I can only say that it is more spacious and more comfortable to live in. Other requirements are Let's reduce it. In short, I feel that there are many types of hotel rooms, and the superior room has more equipment than the deluxe room. If there are special needs, it is better to confirm in advance, because the upgrade is not the better.

What satisfied us most was that the bedding was dry and clean, without the dampness of many hotel beddings.
It's a pity that the carpet and bathroom floor are not very clean because of the selection of materials or other reasons.
Because it is not a real hotel building, the structure and design of the lobby and the ventilation of the corridor are relatively inherently flawed.

1. Good service. The receptionists at the front desk are all gentle, polite and caring, and are responsive to requests. Room service is also on call.
2. Convenience. The hotel is located opposite the Shenzhen Bay Port, 2-3 hundred meters away.
3. Environment, more than 200 meters away is Shenzhen Talent Park, a very new bay park, beautiful and big. Recently, the surrounding subway and commercial buildings have been built. The close-up view is a bit messy, but the sea view in the distance is beautiful. Behind the hotel is the garden and swimming pool, which is not bad
4. Life. Because it is in the new CBD business district, many of the conveniences of life are not there yet, but there is a restaurant in the residential area a few hundred meters away from the hotel. It should be much more convenient for the commercial district to be completed in the future. In addition, the hotel's Chinese restaurant is pretty good, mainly Hunan cuisine.
5. The room is spacious. The minimum is more than 40 square meters, and the configuration is simple and practical. Hygiene and clean.
Anyway, I will definitely go here when I come to Shenzhen Bay in the future.

最大的問題是淋浴頭固定的位子太低了，不理解設計在想什麼？中國人有這麼矮嗎？

游泳池那边救生员态度一般，对游客带点嫌弃，因为是小区泳池而不是酒店泳池。而且保养非常一般，下水梯螺丝松脱，踏板掉了，脚受伤了，救生员对挫傷急救意䛊不足，而且安全意䛊差，插著电源的水泵在水中没撤走，泳客並不知情下进池内。要是漏电，就造成無法挽回的後果！

幸好遇到泳館萍姐很帮忙，尽责和慰问，谢谢你！

msg:酒店就在深圳灣口岸對面，出關太方便了。房間很大，還帶個廚房和小餐廳，一張雙人床、一張大床正適合一家三口，有點家居的感覺，感覺非常舒服。酒店服務也很周到，餐廳味道不錯，晚上還送有綠豆湯和小吃，倍感温馨。酒店地處新開發地帶，周邊環境清凈，高樓林立，旁邊的深圳灣人才公園風景不錯，夜景無敵，離深圳灣萬象城不遠，購物也很方便，強烈推薦！

msg:I went back to Shenzhen and stayed in a hotel for a month. I was the most unhappy staying here for one night. I checked the itinerary code for an hour, and the green code was 24 hours. I want the nucleic acid of the last five days. If you want the latest one year, I have to give you a report. It’s okay to bear it. There were mosquitoes in the room. I caught them in the middle of the night and bit more than a dozen bags.

msg:設施有些舊，開窗後有蚊子。小孩半夜流鼻血弄到枕頭上，被收了450元，當我説這跟房價差不多了，前台來句，我們平時房價可不是這麼便宜的，現在是元旦特價。好吧，我沒有繼續對話，因為服務溝通確實需要提高。
