msg:Excelent view. Service also quite good and friendly
The breakfast was a mix between chinese and western food. Compared to other hotels from same brand, I would  expect more options for fruits and veggies.

Interesting sea food restaurant near the hotel, which I would recommend. 

For people looking to swim at the beach. Quite calm place and not so exciting for swimming.

In general would stay again here , to relax and have calm view

I stayed in this hotel for a short trip. The reception lady was friendly, the bar in the lobby is beautiful and they had some singing performers there on Sunday evening, which felt really special and welcoming.
The carpet and walls in the hallways need renovation and an AC in that area would be nice. My room was quite far away from the elevator, which was quite inconvenient. 
Unfortunately, the adults pool wasn’t “working” when I wanted to use it and the sauna was out of service as well. Other than that, I really enjoyed my stay.

Breakfast is also possible to eat outside on the terrace, which is very nice with direct ocean view.
Breakfat overall very good.
Got Room-Upgrade for free at Check-In
Rooms are very nice and quiet.

What i don`t like is that guests from other Hotel (half price room rate) are allowed to use the Swimming-Pool Facilities at Renaissance-Hotel. This is just not ok and that why there are a lot of families from the other Hotel with several Kids. Very noisy during day-time at the Poo.
Also there are only 14 pool lounger available, which is just not enough for two hotels which are using the pool

It is worth mentioning the hot tub with a big window facing the sea, it was my favorite part of the room. It is definitely one of the best hotels I’ve stayed in Xiamen.
The hotel is clean and beautiful! There are two swimming pools - indoor and outdoor, gym, SPA and sauna. The territory of the hotel is pretty big, full of plants and flowers, plus there are many places where guests can have a rest by sitting in one of the gazebos with table and soft chairs.
The buffet breakfast was okay, but in other hotels the variety of food was richer. I guess this is the only things I would improve in this hotel. The rest is all perfect!

msg:The hotel environment is good. There is a nice indoor swimming pool and beautiful territory outside. The registration took us too long, they asked to sit and wait for 30 minutes to scan the passports. I wish they could provide the welcome drink at the bar while we were waiting for the receptionist. Also I wish there were some welcome snacks as fruits in the room. There are no drinks or snacks in the fridge. In the room was cold because of the rainy day so I wanted to use the air conditioner for 30 degrees to hit the room up but it didn't work because they have limit to 22 degrees which is weird to me. The breakfast is just ok, very few options for dessert, only baked sweets, no cheesecake or the ice cream which is disappointing to me. Generally is it a good option for staying, I would only recommend improve wellcome service and upgrade the breakfast options.

msg:Absolutely gorgeous property. Easy beach access. Room was lovely, one of the nicest I’ve stayed in, ever. Only reason I’m holding off on five stars for service was that the breakfast was extremely crowded, and could’ve been better. Management needs to do a better job communicating to guests that there are significant disparities in the breakfast room depending on time of seating. And you’d think a US flagged hotel would be able to offer western-style coffee service (actual urns of fresh-brewed coffee, please, instead of a Keurig machine!). If you want a decent breakfast experience, I strongly recommend getting an early seating. But all in all a nice stay, and staff were uniformly friendly and pleasant. Highly

msg:Advantages: The room is large and very close to the beach. Walk out of the hotel and cross the non-motorized road to the beach. There are camping tents for rent on the beach. You can sing there at night. The hotel configuration is very high. Many places in the room are designed with arcs to avoid injury due to bumps. This is done very well. Every room in the entire hotel has a balcony and bathtub. There is a door between the washing area and the room, but it is invisible. We didn't discover it until we stayed for two days. The hotel has beach slippers for adults and children. The quality is good. I didn't even wear the ones I brought. Children's bathrobes and toiletries are available. You need to call the front desk to ask for it. We came in late February, and although the outdoor swimming pools were not open, there were three indoor swimming pools. A regular large professional swimming pool with a cooler water temperature. There are two shallow pools for children to play in. The water temperature is on the higher side. The staff requires you to wear a shower cap and swimsuit before swimming in the water. The children had so much fun that they couldn't bear to leave. There are rest chairs, stools and lounge chairs nearby. The women's locker room is very well equipped, with a dedicated locker room and a sauna room, which is so unexpected. Dry bucket of mineral water on bath towel. All these basic configurations are available. The gym is also very good and has a boxing room. The children's indoor children's playground is large, but there are relatively few games. There is an ocean ball pool and a simple small slide. There is also a children's playground outside, with slides and the like. Because my two kids came here for the beach and swimming pool. I didn’t play in the children’s playground, so I didn’t take any pictures.
Breakfast is average, breakfast time is 7:00-11:00, and can be packed into the room. Just outside the hotel gate, there are many restaurants and small shops on the next slope. There is also a cinema. Walk a few more steps and you'll see a sunny town. Milk tea, coffee, KFC, McDonald's, Western food and Chinese food are all available at Weiyou on the fourth floor. The price is moderate, the taste is good, and the portion is very large. When ordering, be sure to order less. If there is not enough, add more. There are many roadside stalls at night.
Service: The service attitude is very good. The front desk, room attendants, and restaurant waiters are all very good. Meets the service standards of a five-star hotel. Special thanks to front desk manager Quin and acting duty manager Manager Hao. There are several other staff members and a young lady pushing a wheelchair. Special thanks to. They all took special care of me after I got injured. Let me feel some warmth in the pain. Thank you so much.
Disadvantages: The only disadvantage is also the fatal flaw. The balcony design is unreasonable. It almost broke me. At 12 o'clock in the evening, I was accompanied by hotel staff to the hospital to take a film. The doctor diagnosed a fracture of the tail vertebrae. Let me talk about the problem. First, the lighting on the balcony at night is very, very dim, almost non-existent. It's a modern design. There was water underground at night, and the floor tiles were black and couldn't be seen at all. Second, the clothes drying rack is opposite to the floor drain, and the floor drain is located in the corner near the door of the room. Watch the video. The water dripping from washing clothes flows down the slope to the floor and will pass through the entire balcony, especially the balcony and the doorway of the room. Third, the cotton mops provided by the hotel are not anti-slip. Fourth, there are no instructions to be careful about slipping on the balcony. Let’s talk about what happened. The balcony was very dark at night, and the water dripping from drying clothes flowed down the slope to the floor drain. Due to unreasonable design problems, a large area of ​​​​the balcony was covered with water. The fireworks outside were beautiful. I was wearing the cotton mop provided by the hotel. When I walked to the center of the balcony, where there was a lot of water, I suddenly slipped and fell. When I got up, I felt something was wrong. I immediately took photos and videos of the scene and called the hotel. Someone will take care of it soon. After the incident happened, the hotel's service attitude was very good, but its attitude towards compensation was average at first. Later, it improved after calling the police and communicating with the hotel. Due to a fractured tail vertebrae and unable to move, the hotel compensated for free extension of stay and meals. Medical expenses, rehabilitation expenses, lost work time, etc. are all paid by the insurance company. This kind of star-rated hotels all buy insurance for their guests.
Suggestion: After my incident, I hope the hotel can rectify the safety hazards on all balconies. I don't want anyone else to be hurt like me. When traveling, not only do you get injured but you can’t go anywhere. I'm also afraid of the side effects. I hope this safety hazard has been resolved when I come to stay next time.
Just because of the service attitude and configuration, I will try the outdoor swimming pool next time. Get a feel for Little Sanya.

There are many facilities in the hotel. There are children's playgrounds, swings, slides and other facilities for children. There are two swimming pools. When I stayed, the outdoor swimming pool was not open. It is estimated that it will not be open until May 1st. The indoor swimming pool is open. The Chinese restaurant is good. We stayed for two nights and had three meals here. The environment is elegant and the service attitude is good. Especially a girl named "V icky", she was very warm and friendly to introduce local specialties to us. Every dish is very good. I want to rush to eat with the children, hahaha. In addition, the attitude of every service staff in the hotel is very good, the front desk, concierge, bar, and even the room cleaning aunt are smiling and greeting, which makes us feel very comfortable living here. The hotel room is clean, tidy, bright and comfortable.

First of all, we were very satisfied with the check-in provided by Yolanda! The rooms all have balconies, facing east and you can see the beach. The location is a little bit out of the way but the overall impact is not too big. It’s really a blessing to get up with the sunrise in the morning!
It's a pity that the hotel's outdoor swimming pool has not been opened recently, but you can swipe your room card directly from the hotel to the beach. It is not a crowded beach, so it is very suitable for vacation.
The breakfast environment is very good, the view is broad, and there are many varieties. Just the service is slightly less.
The only small suggestion is that I hope that the bathtub in the room can provide disposable bath bags. I saw that there was no one in the room, so I didn't take a bath. Hope it can be provided next time!

I want to give my family a comfortable travel experience during the Spring Festival. The room I stayed in was very spacious, the balcony faced the seaside, and the air was fresh. I walked from the hotel's dedicated passage to the seaside, rented a camping tent to drink tea and chat, and spent an afternoon leisurely. The seaside trail is suitable for walking and very comfortable. The breakfast is rich in variety, with Minnan specialties, which left a good impression on us, and my daughter praised it highly. If you also want to avoid the crowds and have a comfortable vacation, this is the best choice~

msg:Disappointed, a family of three booked a deluxe ocean view suite for three nights with an extra bed. The room was overbooked and they were forced to upgrade to a villa (the room was oversized and the view was poor. I didn’t want to upgrade but there was no suite available). I changed the second night because I wanted to see the ocean view. Returning to the sea view suite, there were many instances of poor service throughout the process. I understand that the Spring Festival has a large number of customers, but you may have a better experience if you choose All Seasons or Atour. Compared with Qishang, where you stayed for the next two days, the hotel still has a lot of problems. The room for improvement is as follows:

1. Extra bed service is not in place. The extra bed costing 350 yuan per night is only a bed, without corresponding toothbrushes/slippers/toiletries. Whether it is a villa for the first night or a sea-view suite for the subsequent two nights, guests need to contact themselves before configuring it; there are no pillows for the last two nights. When I called the front desk to ask for additional items, I received the reply "I need to confirm that bedding is in stock and will try to provide it if it is available." Finally, it was provided only after my strict request. If pillows are not guaranteed to be provided, how can I have the nerve to charge for them?
2. Poor room hygiene. There were old stains in the changing room of the villa on the first night, and there were unidentified hairs left by previous guests in the bathroom. The sea-view suite will not be cleaned or replaced for the next two nights, so you need to contact us proactively.
3. Changing room types is inefficient. Before traveling the next morning, I made an appoin**ent with the front desk to change the room if it became available. I returned to the hotel at 3 pm (normal check-in time) and inquired. I found out that the room was still being cleaned, so I waited in the lobby. During this period, the front desk did not say anything. When I asked at 4 o'clock, I inquired and learned that it would take another 1-2 hours (the front desk made multiple calls during the process and obviously knew nothing about the room situation). After I expressed my dissatisfaction, the front desk said that I could go back to the original villa room to rest, and that we would change rooms after we had rested. After the new room was prepared at 5 o'clock, WeChat and phone calls indicated that the villa was in short supply and urged us to change rooms. The efficiency and service awareness of the whole process were poor.

In addition, there are other problems such as mis-sent emails/room phone outage/slow response of room service/poor food in Chinese restaurant/waiter’s incomprehension/loud fireworks display on the beach (5:00-1:00, 20 hours a day, non-stop, although It is not under the jurisdiction of the hotel, but at least guests should be reminded and provided with earplugs in advance) Compared with the first three points, it is acceptable, but it is also below the standards of Marriott hotels.


Advantages: Apologize when changing rooms, the sea view suite is arranged on the highest floor/The staff will take the initiative to say hello when meeting on the road/The decoration style of the room is OK/It is more convenient to walk to the beach

msg:The price increase during the Spring Festival and the lack of waiters were acceptable, but the service and facilities were unsatisfactory. The front desk couldn't figure out the time of the train, which caused the child to miss it. Later, when he heard the sound of the train, he had already left the hotel. In fact, it starts from the lobby at 4 o'clock every day and goes to the swimming pool. When I asked the front desk, I was told that it is only available from Friday to Sunday. This is very speechless😓

There is no door in the toilet room in the room. I don't know if it's just in my room or if it's not in the entire hotel design. Even if you live as a family, it would be awkward to be in the bathroom area. Whose five-star house has no way to poop😓

During the stay, the air conditioning in the room does not have cooling or heating, only a fresh air system. There are a few days when the temperature is so high that I want to turn on the air conditioner and wrap myself up in a quilt. The child is sweating even if he wears a T-shirt without a quilt and a blanket. Opening the window for ventilation is ruined by the sound of fireworks and firecrackers outside the window every day in the middle of the night (it should really be like some areas where it is prohibited after 11 p.m. Although it is festive and lively, it is very busy). I can’t stand bangbang even after 2 o’clock or 1 o’clock) I spent 2,661 nights on a room but couldn’t sleep well, ugh...

In other respects, the hotel is actually not big, and the parent-child facilities are very average. The beach trail in front of the door is beautiful and clean, and bicycles, battery cars, tents, etc. can be rented. The cleaning staff is very good. The one who took the initiative to say hello several times was the cleaning staff. There is a waitress in the lobby bar who is also very warm and friendly.

msg:I have stayed at Renaissance Xiamen several times before, in Suzhou and Shanghai. This time I saw that Xiamen Renaissance is close to the sea. I rushed decisively. It smells so good!
About the sea view: The xiakou passes through the garden and you can see the endless sea view and beach. You can get close to the sea without driving or crowding. It is much better than the one in Siming District.
Transportation: Drive along the main road around the island for 20 minutes to reach the popular attraction Siming District. It is recommended to park in advance during holidays and walk and cycle to the attractions.
Room: I really like the layout of this room. It divides the room into two sides, with the cloakroom and washroom connected to one side. This is very friendly to people like me who like to spend a lot of time in the bathroom. The key is that it also comes with a stool, which is so considerate. Haha
Restaurant: It turns out that the best sea view room is the restaurant haha. When you open the door, you can see the view of the sea. When the weather is hotter, you can sit outside and eat haha.

msg:Absolutely, the price/performance ratio is very high, the basic suite room is super large, it is directly comparable to the 5000+ RMB large suites in other hotels. There is also an oversized comfortable sofa (there is no need for an extra bed when living with three parents)
    I think the balcony and unobstructed sea view room are the most important. This basically has an unobstructed sea view. The building on the other side also has Xiamen characteristics, instead of just looking at the sea, the terrace is also very large.
    You can directly access the public beach by swiping your room card in the hotel park. Although it is public, there are really few people. It is really convenient and comfortable to take a walk along the coast.
    The front desk service attitude was very good. Thank you Daisy for helping me solve the problem.
    I originally wanted to stay one day and go to Conrad the next day, but my parents felt it was too comfortable and cheap and didn’t want to move, so they stayed for two days.
    If you are driving by yourself, you must stay here instead of staying in the city center. This is a vacation.

But the sanitary corners are average.
When checking in, it was very slow. I looked for the order for a long time and still couldn't find it and had to confirm it.
The room was arranged at a very bad angle and there was no sea view at all. I was told that there was a better sea view.
There was no smile the whole time, I didn’t know what the front desk was doing, and I was really suffocating.
It is relatively close to the beach and there is a good children's slide.
In summary, 4 points for hardware and 1 point for service, it is not worth coming.

As a result, both of us stepped on the broken glass and were injured. Fortunately, the injury was not serious, but we must be vigilant. There is no big or small issue when it comes to safety, and there is no serious injury, especially since many poolside rooms are occupied by children. It is hard to imagine what would happen if a child stepped on broken glass that could puncture my adult foot! Secondly, there is the service. The security guard at the door does the work of three or four people by himself. During the peak period, no bellman was seen. There was no guidance after check-in. It took us a long time to find the room after dragging our luggage. There is also a question mark over the cleanliness of the room. One of the tenants' garbage was not even cleaned up beside our railing.

msg:Wanli, staying for four nights in a row, is generally very satisfied, of course, the shortcomings are obvious.
Let me talk about the advantages first:
1. The price/performance ratio is very high, the room is very large, and the facilities are new, nice and beautiful
2. The surrounding environment is good, and it belongs to the high-end area. According to the locals, it belongs to the outside of the island. There are indoor and outdoor swimming pools. There is a beach outside the hotel, and the sand is very fine, which cannot be seen on the island.
3. The breakfast is rich and the noodles are delicious. There is a sunny town outside the hotel, a lot of food, and a lively night market at night.
Not enough to say:
It can be said that although this is a five-star hotel, the service cannot even match the three-star hotel in other countries. No welcome drink, no help with luggage. For breakfast, no one took the initiative to ask if they want coffee or tea. The funniest thing is that there may be a lot of people during the summer vacation, there is no place for breakfast for a while, and there was only one staff member at one time. Not to mention that no one came to ask what you need, and no one even cleared the table.
2. Because it is outside the island, it is a bit troublesome to go to the central attractions. It takes a lot of time to take a taxi and the fare is not cheap. One night I took a taxi from Zengcuo'an and it cost nearly 90, which was the most economical car. Therefore, it is recommended to spend two nights on the island, and then stay here after playing almost.
3. It is still a service, which is also a small episode. I booked for three consecutive nights at the beginning, and later canceled the one-night trip to Gulangyu and changed it to Renaissance. When we checked in, we clearly said that it was ready, but when we came back from Gulangyu for a day, we finally walked to the room (our room was the farthest from the elevator) and found that the card could not be used. Immediately went to the front desk again, and ran back to the room after finishing it, only to find that they hadn't cleaned it up again. Thinking about playing outside for a day, it was hot and uncomfortable, and I wanted to take a shower and rest right away, but I didn't clean up anything. So I said that although this is a five-star hotel, the location and facilities are excellent, but the service has a long way to go.

msg:Except for being a little far from the city, everything else is perfect. The last day in Xiamen is arranged here, which is a real island vacation experience. The beach is right outside the back door of the hotel. It's very lively at night, and you can also go to the bar to listen to music. The outdoor swimming pool area is also quite clean, with various pools suitable for children. The most regrettable thing is that I didn't have time to learn paddle boarding from the instructor. There is a dedicated paddle board waterway here.

msg:I thought about this score for a long time, and finally decided to give it five points.
Let me talk about the satisfactory part first: the hotel is a resort hotel. From the interior design of the hotel-fragrance smell-indoor and outdoor swimming pools-the hotel's outer runway around the island-beach, the overall holiday a**osphere is very good, and there are not many rooms, so it will not feel noisy , this is very good! I'm usually not used to staying in the hotel lobby bar for too long, it always feels too noisy, but the Renaissance Lobby Bar feels very good, especially at night, it's quite pleasant to chat while listening to the singer's resident singing, non-alcoholic Drinks are also good. The service is also better than what I learned before, especially the concierge service at the door is very good, helping to pull the car door, pick up the luggage, and basically greet each other politely. Here, I would like to praise the hotel staff Rovi. When we learned that we could not find our room, He took the initiative to help us with our luggage and delivered it to the door in person. He is handsome and kind, super nice. There is also a cleaning guy who helps me clean the room. He is a little fat and wears glasses. Really, he has stayed in many hotels at home and abroad. I have never met someone who cleans as carefully as he does! It can even be called a closet organizer! It's a pity that I didn't remember the name, and I strongly recommend the hotel to praise it! Such good employees will definitely earn a good reputation for the hotel!
Next, let me talk about the unsatisfactory places: 1. The front desk told me that I was in Area B 715. Since the hotel logo was not obvious enough, we dragged our luggage around for a long time, and finally found it, only to find that the room was not in Area B, but in zone A. Just the opposite direction, on the other side of the hotel. Reluctantly dragging the luggage around again and again. 2. I deliberately compared two different sea view rooms when booking, and finally chose the more expensive premium sea view room, but in fact I was not given this room type, and I did not inform in advance, because I arrived late that day, I did not pay attention . The next day I took a closer look, and observed it from the outside of the hotel. It was indeed very remote. Basically, it took several minutes to walk from my room to the elevator. I could indeed see the sea from the balcony, but there were almost no other views. messy. But the hotel told me that I could only wait for the next day on the grounds that the room was full. But I looked at the platform and it shows that there is a room available. On the third day, I adjusted the room type for me. There is no comparison and no harm. The balcony is twice as square as before. It's a pity that I will leave Xiamen the next day, and I feel somewhat regretful. 3. The breakfast room is beautiful, and you can see the beautiful scenery everywhere, but because there are too many floor-to-ceiling windows, the restaurant is a bit hot, so it is recommended to have enough air conditioning. In addition, it is recommended to have more varieties of fried vegetables.
To sum up: the hotel's hardware facilities are great, especially for film production, and you won't be disturbed at all. If the service awareness can be strengthened, I believe it will be better.

Finally, comment on Ctrip Butler, super five-star forever! Always put customer needs first, which is why occasionally some other platforms have discounts but I never think about it, the service is simply not comparable. I am very grateful to the customer service steward who fought for my rights this time!

msg:Traveling with friends, the room type is different, Morgan made arrangements very considerately, and upgraded us to a sea view room. After a few days, we caught up with the small peak of summer travel, and the price rose a lot compared to the reservation. The hotel room is very large, and you won't feel stuffy if you don't turn on the air conditioner occasionally; the facilities are also very good. If I have to talk about shortcomings, I think the occupancy rate may be too high, and the cleaning of cups and some details needs to be improved (the cups still have tea stains, I tried to wash them off, and there are traces of fruit stains that have not been cleaned by the trash can); breakfast The variety is not rich enough, especially the choice of fruit; the enthusiasm of the service staff needs to be improved, I guess they also need to be better taken care of and motivated by the management. The Chinese restaurant is the most satisfying part of this trip, with impeccable taste and service.

There is no welcome fruit, and all drinks are charged. A child who has just turned 1.4 is charged as an adult for breakfast. I got the deluxe sea-view room that was booked by the room card. I couldn’t see the sea when I entered the room. I called and asked to change the room. I dragged my luggage out again and changed the room again. In the end, I changed to a room with a half-view of the sea view. Forget it. Yes, it was too far from the front desk once, and I brought two children with my luggage. I can go on a business trip. I don’t recommend parent-child travel. There is nothing to do. Did you go to play in the water after staying for two days?

The breakfast variety is not too many, but it is also very delicate and attentive. It's just that the toilet is not smart.

msg:The front desk is very good, all without my request. The beauty at the front desk from Beijing checked in on her birthday and gave her a birthday cake. The handsome guy Hahey is very nice. He seems to have brought two children. He helped us upgrade the room so that we could visit earlier. Very caring. Dinner at the Chinese restaurant felt extremely uncomfortable, so let's make two complaints. First, it's slow. The child overslept after taking a nap when he was tired from playing, and went to eat at around 7:30 in the evening. The notification would be slow, about half an hour. I think if it is more troublesome to go out at this time, just wait. As a result, I waited for more than an hour. There were three or four tables in the lobby and we were all waiting. Second, lack of service awareness, three manifestations. 1. No one paid attention when I entered the door. I asked the supervisor, where should we sit? He just came to take the seat. 2. He said that the food is slow to serve, I want to place an order quickly, he asked me to scan the QR code to order by myself, but the hotel system does not support ordering at all, I can only look at the menu. 3. If there is no ginger duck in the menu, ask him. Tell me, let me see how many customers, it's sold out. But since I couldn't place the order by myself, I had to ask a waitress to help me place the order. I asked, is there any ginger duck? tell me there is! Finally got it!

It is not worthwhile to spend in the private room. After purchasing the Renaissance Sea View Suite, you can also have plenty of time to take your baby to play by the sea and spend the night. The overall environment, facilities and services of the suite are very good, especially in terms of service. There was an episode in the middle.

msg:Incident 1⃣️ I booked the hotel for May Day and told the hotel in advance that I need a bed and a baby cot. I was told that there is no... After searching in Xiaohongshu, it is obvious that they can provide it. I went to the root hotel to communicate and was told that the equipment was insufficient due to the overcrowding of tourists during the May Day period. (The hotel is only for making money, no matter whether the service can keep up, right? If you can’t keep up, don’t pick up so many guests)
Incident 2⃣️Communicate and change rooms, the child is 16 months old and walks around in his arms. The poolside room we booked is the penultimate room on the first floor. The corridor is very dark and there is only one elevator for a long distance (the kind that you don’t want to go out when you get to the room The distance is turning and turning) The child sleeps in the morning and sleeps in the afternoon, and the time to play is limited. I feel that all the time is spent walking back and forth... Negotiate with the hotel to change rooms! Change us to the third floor and the last room is farther than the first floor... listen to my request at all... there is no room to change and refuse to check us out
Incident 3⃣️ was locked at the door of the room and was not allowed to open the door. After taking the child from a swim, the child was wet and ready to enter the room to take a bath, but the door card could not be opened. A waiter just cleaned our room and stood at the door. I begged the waiter to help open the door, but was refused (seeing the child shivering from the cold, he was not moved at all) I called the front desk and said that when the front desk opened the door, I turned around and left without even saying sorry. The problem with the room card is also the problem of the guest? Probably the child was wrapped in a bath towel and waited for half an hour...
Incident 4⃣️ The waiter put the water glass on the bedside in a room with children, and the glass broke and broke the baby's feet... I really don't know what the logic is what people in this hotel are thinking! Be pissed off!
Event 5⃣️I didn't feel any apology for the above problems!
	
Incident 6⃣️ There is a free train in the hotel. The train departs from the entrance of the hotel and circles around the swimming pool for an hour. Many children pass by and want to look forward to it. The driver who drives the train completely ignores it and does not tell adults what to do. I didn't stop to ask my children if I want to get on the bus... When the time comes, I will happily leave work! It's really a hotel without much love...
Parent-child travel is really not recommended! Staying for three days during May Day 1w ➕ is just spending money to buy a lesson
I hope everyone will not be fooled again... Xiamen Wanli really don't go! The children's amu*****t park is also very small, and there are very few contents in it, only the claw machine slides and ocean balls are deserted!
The beach at the door is full of campers
The place where the swimming pool comes out to take a bath is full of water, and the plug of the hair dryer is also broken. It's really bad, very bad... I won't go there again
	
The following are comments from other guests during the same period

🌟! And we have two rooms, four adults and three children. Keep saying that the room is not cleaned well, give us one first! Okay, no problem, let's put our luggage in one room first and take the children to swim. After playing until three o'clock, I went to the front desk to ask if the room hadn't come out, so we went back to the room to take a shower, and the room still didn't come out after four o'clock! I called to quarrel [laughing and crying R] [laughing and crying R]. . This hotel really brings back bad memories for me! Recommended next to the Xiamen Marriott Hotel and Conference Center! It may not be new, but I took my children there twice and had a great time. There is a small playground (ocean ball with slides though small). There is a shallow pool great for the little ones

🌟 I went on 5.2 and I really think this place is very indifferent! And the service is not working! It’s not worth spending so much money for such a service. When we went, we were told that we could check in at about 3 o’clock, but we had to wait and then moved from the fifth floor to the sixth floor. The washbasin plug was broken, and the bathtub was still intact. It will leak!

🌟 I have stayed in this hotel many times. The room near the elevator is a premium sea view room, so people who book a normal sea view can only live far away from the elevator. The biggest problem with this hotel is that there is only one elevator on the first floor. Some rooms have to go through a long corridor to get to the elevator, which is extremely unfriendly to people with children. Only those who have lived in it can understand how long this corridor is. Needless to say, the attitude of the staff is poor. This hotel has never been From top to bottom, money comes first and there is no sense of service. It can only be said that there are too few parent-child hotels by the seaside in Xiamen, so they don’t worry about business.

🌟 [Laughing and crying R] I forgot which floor I lived in this hotel, anyway, it's almost the last room. I was tired and went to the hotel to get out of the elevator to the room and there was a marathon. When I was about to deduct the money from the self-serve room bill**, I found that he had counted the self-service money twice. I called the hotel and told the hotel that it would only count once if it said no. When the payment was deducted, I found out that I was deducted twice! I called the hotel again and told me it was a **** problem! I will go to **. **The reply to me is the data submitted by the hotel before they can deduct the payment! I live full of fire!

msg:The hotel's hardware facilities are good, the service staff can take the initiative to greet you, the breakfast is rich, and the Chinese restaurant has a good environment. Please understand the following: 1. After checking in, you must remember to ask for the direction of the elevator. The hotel is divided into building A and building B. It will be tiring to go wrong; 2. The hotel’s scanner may malfunction. When you check in at this counter, there will be staff at other counters to scan your documents, which feels very unprofessional; 3. Be sure to check after entering the room Whether the bathroom facilities can be used normally, especially whether the toilet can be flushed normally; 4. This hotel does not have an executive lounge, so please choose carefully if you need to enjoy this service; 5. The hotel does not usually have buffet dinners, but only on weekends; 6. The beach is a public beach, not exclusive to the hotel. There are running paths and the environment is good. 7. There are mosquitoes in the room in late April. Although there is mosquito repellent in the room, try to bring some by yourself.

msg:The environment of the hotel is good. The service staff in the lobby and guest rooms are also very diligent and have a strong sense of service. The facilities are very new, the rooms are not humid, and it is very close to the beach. You can set up tents and canopies, which is very convenient. The heated swimming pool is slightly smaller. It's just a children's pool. If it's a holiday, I'm afraid there will be dumplings, and the temperature is very suitable. The outdoor swimming pool is not open because of the cold weather, and it will open after May Day, which looks very good. The only dissatisfaction is the restaurant. The price of the Chinese restaurant is very expensive but the taste is very average. The management of the western restaurant is chaotic. Ordering lunch on weekdays, the dishes delivered when there are almost no customers in the restaurant are all cold, and dinners on weekdays are frequent The wrong dishes were delivered and many waiters did not know the table number of the restaurant. The dishes were collected too frequently, which disturbed the meal. There were not many people in the buffet. At 6:30, the salmon was gone, and the meal preparation was not ready. It is really a level that a five-star hotel should not have. Except for the restaurant, everything else is satisfactory and I hope it can be improved.

msg:I have stayed at Renaissance Hotels many times, and also stayed at seaside hotels in many places. This time, Renaissance Xiamen Hotel surprised me constantly. I was directly upgraded to a room on the day of check-in. But you must know that it is Golden Week, so I give a special thumbs up to the hotel.
In addition, the hotel room is spacious, with complete and new equipment and facilities, a large balcony, and a bathtub with a view. The chaise lounge in the room can be used as a child's crib.
The hotel is very close to the seaside, but the seaside is full of tent camping, so I didn't go there much. It was enough to play with the children in the hotel's indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and you can also rent automatic water guns.
Not to mention the service, they are responsive to all requests, and the staff also take the initiative to say hello and communicate enthusiastically.
All in all, I am 100% satisfied with this experience. This hotel is very cost-effective and worth it!

msg:I personally like the location of this hotel very much. It is located on the Huandong Romantic Line of Jimei. When you leave the hotel gate, there is a runway that is tens of kilometers long. The runway is stretching past the beach and the sea. And this runway is closed to motor vehicles, so it is very friendly to friends who like to run. During the day, you can also rent a small battery car that is very slow, and there are also small trains suitable for children.
       The transportation of the hotel is also relatively convenient. There is an underground parking lot for self-driving. The road to the main island of Xiamen is very smooth, and it is also convenient to take a taxi. There is a Sunshine Town shopping center just a few minutes' walk from the hotel, where you can eat and shop. There is also a cinema in front of the hotel.
       The interior of the hotel is the configuration that a first-tier chain five-star should have. The room and breakfast are good. The supporting children's playground is a bit small, and the swimming pool and gym are okay. There are many outdoor places for children to play in the water, and the rooms on the first floor can directly enter the swimming pool surrounding the main building. Unfortunately, we went during the Spring Festival and we couldn't get in the water.

Half an hour past Gaoqi Airport, there is a special passage to the beach behind. I don’t know the name of the beach, but the sand and sea water are clean. During the day, people dig sand to watch the sea, and some people are setting up tents for barbecue. Get up in the morning and go to the sea at low tide, and you can pick up clams, hermit crabs and small conchs.
There is an indoor heated swimming pool and an outdoor swimming pool. In March, you can change the water in the outdoor swimming pool in the morning. There is also a special play area for children.
The Sunshine Town is 500m away from the hotel. Snacks, restaurants, and convenience stores are very convenient. It is recommended to stay at the beach in Xiamen for a day.

msg:After staying in a hotel for so many years, this is the first time I encountered such poor service, and I learned three words: "not provided"! ! !
Charging cable - not provided, go to the lobby to scan the power bank yourself
Meal delivery - not provided, go to the lobby to get it yourself
There wasn't even a bottle of water in the refrigerator, so I had to call to get it. I probably stayed in an express hotel.
It's okay to not provide anything. As a star hotel, there is no basic service attitude. The waiter who answered the phone would only say "not provided" and did not want to help solve the problem. He would just say bluntly that he would not provide it.
This is Renaissance’s service, right? If you don't provide it, all services will be omitted. If you don't provide it, you will ignore the needs of customers?
The room type I booked was first said to be being cleaned, and then it was said to be closed for maintenance. Later, it was available again, but I met a waiter who was leading the way. He was not familiar with the road and took me up and down the detour, and even took me directly to the parking lot. Field, are you going to drive people away directly? It's really hilarious
As a resort hotel, the restaurants are not open at night, so I suggest that it be better to close them altogether.

The comprehensive situation of Renaissance Xiamen Hotel should be said to be the best. The location is excellent, the scenery is beautiful, the facilities are first-class, the functions are complete, the room size is large, and the service is very good. It takes good care of the suite guests. It can meet the personalized needs of children's breakfast, late check-out, welcome fruit, and extra items. Do your best to satisfy and impress.
      At the same time, I only offer some suggestions for the suite for reference
      One is that clothes hooks should be added in toilet rooms and washrooms;
      Second, door locks should be added in the toilet room (this is really not humane enough, even a family would feel embarrassed);
      Third, in the dining area and living room, paper towels and trash cans should be added;
      Fourth, take the initiative to introduce or provide guidance for nearby tours.

To be honest, it costs more than 2,200 to stay in your pool room. It is better to choose Xiamen W, which costs 1,000, at the same price. The Waldorf Astoria is simply crushing. It is far from the seaside. There is a lot of garbage on the beach. There is no sense of service. The front office is slow to check in. The breakfast is also poor.

The service of the hotel is also quite good. The seaside resort hotel is also good for taking a walk along the romantic coastline around the East. It is not far from Gaoqi Airport and Xiamen North Railway Station. It is more convenient to take a taxi.

The lady walked right up to my kids who were taking online classes. Let me just say that this is for the VIP area to receive VIPs, let's go out now. (When I checked in for the first time from 12.11-14, I was already taking online classes at the same location every day). What is even more infuriating is the verbal questioning whether I am a hotel resident, just using their "vip" facilities. Please take a look, this is the sign of this space, and the door is wide open, and the inside is also empty. The service level of Renaissance is really shameful! This is the first time someone blows me away in a hotel space that I paid for! Stayed for nearly 20 nights in the off-island hotels, Crown, and Por**an's service standards are indeed excellent in comparison.

One thing is that when bringing a child, you must bring the original ID card and household registration book with you. Human trafficking is very strict in Xiamen.

There are hotels on a road near the hotel. It is very beautiful. The hotel is also very new. The design is very novel. There are independent dressing rooms in each holiday! The bed is also very comfortable, but the gym is small but adequate

It's not a private beach, you have to walk through a very beautiful road to get to the beach. The sanitation is very clean! Give this a good review 🌹

The hotel's breakfast is still very good, with a wide variety of varieties. The wonton noodles have many local Fujian characteristics. I am very satisfied. I also tried the hotel's single line and individual desserts. The desserts are really good, the price is affordable and there are certain innovations ! Desserts at the bar must be eaten. Passion fruit is recommended. It’s really good. Love it to death (⑉°з°)-♡

The back door of the hotel is the coastal trail and the beach. It is very convenient to rent a bicycle and electric car. There are 9 return points. There is a shopping mall across the road outside the front door, so it is convenient to eat.
The poolside room, which is convenient for playing with water, is more stressful during the holidays. Originally wanted to book its brother Marriott's atoll pool room, but only one was left. The room type of Renaissance is also very strange. Their official website shows that there is no room, and there are no Fliggy. There are still 3 or 4 rooms on Ctrip, even if they are booked by Ctrip, they cannot enjoy the Marriott Gold Card.
5-star hotels basically have all the services that should be presented, and we mentioned it the next day and delayed our check-out until 2 o'clock. Full 5 points. It is a recommended hotel.

I arrived at the front desk at 4 pm to check in, and it took five minutes to complete the check-in. ,very professional.
Because I booked a room without breakfast, I went to the door of the restaurant to ask about breakfast, and was told that there would be a discount for booking a day in advance. I am very happy to have such a service staff who thinks about customers and saves money for customers.
I have to say that Renaissance’s breakfast is delicious. Although the beancurd looks unremarkable, it is really delicious. The watermelon is also very delicious. When we proposed to pack a watermelon back to the room, the service staff of the restaurant was We took the packing box, and asked if one was enough, if we needed to take two more packing boxes, and really felt the feeling of being at home in Wanli.
We arrived at the restaurant for dinner after watching the sunrise in the morning. It was about 7:10. It was the first group of guests to dine. The restaurant was very clean, but there were some food residues on the seats and chairs that were not cleaned. To a slightly cleaner location, some affect the mood in the morning.
Although Renaissance is not on the island, it is very close to the beach. When watching the sunrise in the morning, it only takes five minutes to get out of the hotel. Although it is the peak tourist season, there are not many people watching the sunrise. It is a refreshing feeling. In the afternoon, there are more tourists on the beach. There are mobile vendors selling sausages, popsicles and glutinous rice cakes. The prices are very favorable compared to other tourist attractions. There are also some mobile cars. You can rent a four-seater electric car, or you can hire a small train. Because the rainbow beach is too big, it is a little tired to walk halfway, so these small cars are very good choices.
Because of the hot weather, sometimes I am willing to go to the beach in the afternoon, and the room is always on Do Not Disturb mode, and the hotel will call to confirm the time to clean the room.
The check-out was also very fast, the whole process was not messy at all, and the deposit was also received in seconds. Overall, it was a very pleasant journey.

It's good morning, why didn't you notify the guests or deliver it to the guest room? Then, by the way, let's talk about the hotel's dining. When we were sitting in the lobby waiting for our room, because we hadn't eaten yet, we ordered 4 noodles at the lobby bar. Who was content to wait for more than 40 minutes! The family is hungry, but this side just can't be done! It's really bad to encounter these things on the first day of check-in. Fortunately, the hotel environment is still very good, close to the beach, children also have a good time. Today we checked out at 12 o'clock, but there was another problem at the front desk. We couldn't find a record of our 3,000 yuan deposit. After a long time, we still couldn't get it back. Because we had to catch the train, we had to go first... The check-in and check-out experience left me with a bad impression of the Renaissance Hotel. This is not the service level that a high-star hotel should have. The only thing I want to praise is a fat man with glasses at the entrance of the lobby. He is very polite and always greets guests warmly. Compared with him, he is far from the front desk staff!

msg:Resort hotel, with beach, multiple swimming pools, suitable for families with children. The hardware facilities are also relatively new.
To mention the shortcomings, compared to the hotels in Sanya, the service awareness is relatively poor. First, when checking in, the front desk was indifferent and did not have the enthusiasm of a resort hotel. The second is the staff of afternoon tea at Yiting lobby bar (leader in black suit). Afternoon tea waited from 4:00 to 6:30 for dinner, lack of service and active communication with customers, and finally felt that his face was not good . The third is the sanitation of the hollow partition at the entrance of the room. The ash has accumulated a layer... The bathroom has a sense of design, but the patterned white floor tiles need to be brushed...

msg:There are too many disadvantages: 1. Design problems, the whole hotel is dark during the day. The room is poorly lit, generally dark. 2. The bathroom door is translucent, and the window has only a thin curtain, so when you sleep until 4-5 in the morning, the room is dark and the door is very bright, as shown in Figure 8, it seems to be in a dark room Bright screen, especially dazzling. Difficulty continuing to fall asleep. 3. The breakfast is very monotonous. After staying for a week, the breakfast is the same every day, and the variety is very small, and the bread is not fresh. 4. As shown in Figure 2, there will be a chandelier in the room, its only function is to hit your head when you get up. 5. There are hidden safety hazards in the swimming pool, as shown in Figure 4. If you don't look carefully, you will not find that there are steps in the water, and it is easy to fall. Should be a warning, or a different color. 6. There are many people waiting in line for breakfast. Picture 6, the venue is too small and there are too few varieties.
The only advantage: close to the beach.

You can catch the sea. It is very convenient! The front desk staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic. I have seen other reviews before and I was a little worried about the poor service, but when I came over, I found that the hotel staff were very enthusiastic! The room is big and clean! I couldn't book a poolside room on the first night and chose a deluxe sea view room, the view is pleasant! The only thing I stayed in the poolside room for the second night was that the poolside room was a bit damp, and the pillow core and quilt core were a bit smelly. Others are particularly worth recommending. Next time I come to Xiamen, I will choose Renaissance! I would like to praise Miss Marilyn at the front desk here. The next day I waited for the poolside room to be changed to the poolside room, which was always warmly arranged by Miss Marilyn!

There are two beds, one air conditioner blows cold to death, and one cannot blow heat to death. The material of the quilt cover sheet is too poor, and it is super loud when you move it, especially at night. Finally, I want to talk about breakfast. I usually think it's okay. On the last day, we got up early to catch a plane. The meal started at 7 o'clock. When we entered, the waiter was still setting the table slowly, the juice buns and various porridges were not placed, the eggs were not fried, and there were no food clips, and the milk finally came. At my urging, the porridge was finally here, and it wasn't completely ready when I left at 7:20, so other things should be gone. Is this a five-star hotel breakfast? ? Dinner starts at 7:00 and you should be ready by 6:55! ! This is too bad! Will not choose in the future!

msg:The hotel has a beautiful environment and a good breakfast (better than Qishang and Waldorf Astoria). Far from the city. But when it comes to late check out, the hotel does a really bad job. When booking a room on Ctrip, late check-out is one of the benefits. The hotel told us to check out at 12 o'clock twice, because the occupancy rate is high, so we can't check out late. Guests enjoy their own rights and interests. Can't I leave early because of the high occupancy rate? After coordination with Ctrip customer service, we finally checked out at 2:00. Ctrip's customer service is really 100 points, keep calling to help me confirm the room and coordinate with the hotel for late check-out. This hotel is really bad! Almost got fooled

Moreover, the view from the balcony will be blocked by some adjacent floors.
There are also small supermarkets and food not far from the main entrance
To go to the beach, you can take the elevator to the first floor and go through the outdoor swimming pool.
It is only about 1.7 kilometers away from some places where seafood food stalls gather 🚶
It is recommended not to think about buying seafood for processing 👨‍🍳 There is only one restaurant in the seafood market that charges a high price for processing. In addition to boiling for 5 yuan, other methods of cooking and processing charge 25. The taste is still relatively average.
There are more food stalls nearby, you can choose to eat in the store

Supply time: 7:00 to 11:00, there are less things around 10:30 🍽

I booked a deluxe sea view room on Ctrip, but they arranged a poolside room for me. I don’t know if it was a system problem or what. I responded that the front desk took me to see the sea view room in person, but I also I'm not very satisfied, because it doesn't match the pictures I saw on Ctrip at all, and I can only see a little seascape facing a pile of ****s. . . In the end, the attitude of the front desk was very good and helped me upgrade to the distinguished sea view, with a large balcony facing the sea. The view is really great. I read a lot of reviews before saying that the breakfast is not good, but I feel very satisfied. There are many self-service tastes, and it deserves five stars.

msg:Hardly any reviews, but this time I had to say something. When I called the hotel for the first time before checking in, I called 4.5 times and no one answered. I picked up later, but it was not the front desk staff who specialized in wiring, so I didn't know anything. Later, another person came to pick me up, which also confused me. After checking in, the room was not too big, but because I lived on the second floor, it was extremely noisy during lunch break, and children were playing with water downstairs, so I asked for extra money to upgrade the room. After the upgrade, I found that in the new room, the TV's wireless device was broken, the floor drain of the bathtub was broken, the makeup mirror didn't work, and the front desk was called again. Two people came before and after, and the wireless couldn't be repaired. At this time, I felt a little incomprehensible. After all, the house price of 1500 is not low. It is also a hotel owned by a large group company. And the front desk (don't know who it is) asked me: Do you have to watch TV? Fainted, I can't see it if it's broken. The hotel asked me to change the room again, but I have already changed it once. It is really inconvenient to carry the elderly and children with large and small luggage. Finally the hotel offered to cancel the upgrade money. The next day, the main event came. We went by car and took the children out in the morning. When we arrived at the parking gate, it was shown that the fee was 200. Since there is no similar situation in other hotels, the parking fee is free. Then call the front desk, the lady who answered the phone at the front desk, the next paragraph is for you. During my call, I asked why there was a fee, and if there was no fee, why no one of the staff told us to clean up in advance when we checked in and when we checked out (returned a room, kept a room) code to ensure that the car will not be intercepted when driving out. She said: Isn't this common sense? Do you need someone to tell you this? Hearing this, I was stunned. This is a luxury hotel marked with five diamonds. Can employees not pay attention to the brand image like this? ! ? Then she said: If you think something is wrong, you can file a complaint. I said, ok, please let me know your badge and the phone number of your manager on duty. Watch carefully! ! She said: go check it yourself! Then! ! ? Hang up my phone! ! Oh my god! This is the first time I have encountered such an outrageous thing on a trip. Then, I was really angry, and I called back directly. No one answered the 5 calls, and then I answered the call, and I went straight to the manager on duty. One thing to say, the attitude of the manager on duty is good, but it can't repair my travel mood. Originally, I was going to take my child to the playground in the morning, but I spent half an hour standing on the sidelines answering hotel calls. I offered to ask the girl to apologize, but the manager on duty refused. Talk about protecting employees. In the process of communicating with the duty manager, she also said that recently, many customers have the same feedback and feelings as me. All right. In short, I won't go there again in the future. I don't spend money to buy anger.

msg:The worst accommodation experience in history, the lobby on the first floor should be outsourced, the waiters have no sense of service, and they are thinking about how to make money! Move over from Por**an next to it, and feel the sky and the ground. I needed a toothbrush for more than half an hour at night, and I had to call to get it. I called at one o'clock to clean the room, and at three o'clock no one came, so I had to urge again. Sitting on the lobby sofa, be reminded all the time, be careful not to touch their sofa! I think it has something to do with their corporate culture. Next to the swimming pool, you can see the leaders reprimanding the employees, so the employees give a few good faces! The accommodation is to make the service comfortable. Here, I feel that I owe them! Advised not to come!

msg:In all fairness, this hotel is too far from the Renaissance standard. First of all, when you enter the hotel, the security has already checked the QR code + itinerary card, and you need to check it again at the front desk. Secondly, when we checked in, we learned that the hotel gym was closed due to the epidemic, so let us go to Element next door to exercise. The circular issued by Xiamen has already lifted the restrictions on major gyms. The hotel did not plan to open the gym and swimming pool because of laziness. It also found a reason to shirk and let us go to Element (express hotel level). There are only three treadmills and two elliptical machines. A few dumbbell gyms don't even think about strength training, let alone swimming. The interior of the hotel is dilapidated and dirty. The glass in the corridor on the 5th floor is broken and will not be repaired. The baseboards in the room are cracked, the faucet is loose, the shower door is not aligned, and the hygiene is also a mess. There is a lady's hair on the pillow and a layer of gray on the table. The open-air swimming pools and pools in the hotel park have no water in winter, so why not clean them? Full of fallen leaves and dust. The security slumped in the chair. The worst part is the breakfast. Because there are not many guests, the hotel knows that it is going to close down, so it changes the buffet into a set menu. There are very few things, and the bread for two people leaks. Having stayed in so many Marriott Renaissance, this one is the worst. The epidemic is not the reason for the lack of guests, but it is entirely my own.

Children can play for an afternoon without swimming trunks. The gardener enthusiastically took us there and accompanied the children to change them. Thank you very much. In the evening, walk through the Rainbow Sightseeing Road to dig flower clams on the beach and play sailing boats. Very interesting! The hotel’s Chinese food must be complimented. The dishes are exquisite and delicious, and the portion size is just right.

msg:Very, very good. We first lived in Por**an Seven Stars Bay, and then came to Renaissance. In comparison, the details of Renaissance are much better than Seven Stars Bay. First of all, a service staff helped us with our luggage. When we checked in, we were upgraded to a distinguished sea view room for free, and explained to us that since the hotel is a resort hotel, in order to ensure that every room can see the sea, there is no room opposite the door, and the corridor is relatively long. On the way to the room, the service staff also told us where the gym, swimming pool and children's playground are. Because there were few guests staying in the hotel, the small train made a special trip for us. Later, we heard that we were going to the beach, and we changed the battery to take us to the beach. The service was very thoughtful. The breakfast should also be praised, it is very in line with my taste, and my baby likes it very much. When we eat, the staff asks us how we feel about breakfast, whether it suits our taste or not. When we check out, we will give the children a small gift. Li Hotel has a very good experience and will definitely come again next time.

The tide is low in the evening these days, adults and children dig clams to catch crabs Sand digging is very fun; there are a lot of swimming pools, but unfortunately there are few open, and the time is short; there is really nothing to play in the children’s playground; there are not many attractions around, just a movie theater when you go out; the buffets of the two restaurants are both good and cost-effective. It's worth eating with children. The service I was worried about exceeded expectations. The service staff I met were very enthusiastic. When I checked in, I just caught up with He Huina, who appeared in many reviews. She was really super enthusiastic and patient. I will come again next time.

Although it is off the island, it is up to half an hour to drive from the scenic spot. We rented a car so there is no inconvenience. As soon as they arrived, the doorman helped to open the door and take the luggage. Both rooms are basically available at three o'clock. The essential! There are beds around! Mom can sleep at ease. The room is well-equipped and very clean! Although the air conditioner is a bit noisy, it is automatic and not too cold or too hot. Clothes can be dried on the balcony. Room service is super sweet! Really sweet! A little touched by the small note! Also help me fold up the messy clothes! The last time I enjoyed such a service was in a hotel in Japan. Full details! Thank you!

The hardware is very good except the children's play area is a bit monotonous. The five-and-a-half-year-old baby in the outdoor swimming pool thinks about it every day! The indoor pool water temperature is good and clean. It is very comfortable to swim with few people. The hotel is across the road from the beach. The sea is also terrible. Really love it!

All the staff I met would say hello when they saw it. It can be seen that the service has been greatly improved. As for the breakfast, the type is not bad. It's just that everyone basically stayed for more than two or three nights, so I thought I was tired of eating. Hahaha
There is a sunny town within a few minutes' walk and there is a lot to eat! There is a cinema at the door, I also watched 1921. Really came on vacation!
Really recommend it! Just shoot and shoot in the hotel! Come on all. Hahaha

②Accommodation environment, Renaissance is a newly opened hotel with very new facilities and clean. The decoration style is similar to Bali, which is my favorite holiday style. The biggest highlight is the sea view restaurant, with a wide view and exclusive views! (It's a pity that God is not beautiful, and I have a little regret)
③There are not many restaurants nearby, and there are fewer types of breakfast in the hotel, which is not good but very modest! This kind of star-rated resort hotel should be able to improve and become more competitive!
④The hotel is separated from the beach by a rainbow track, suitable for friends who like sports. It’s ok to walk along Binhai Road!

good aspect
1. On the wedding anniversary, call in advance to request a honeymoon set, and indeed put the petals on the bed
2. The decoration is a bit more beautiful than Marriott,
3. Use robots to deliver things, which children find novel
4. The best thing to do is to help carry the luggage to the room after checking in. This is great, and the attitude of the cleaning aunt is also very good.

Areas for improvement
1. The most common room set by 1k7, plus a Marriott member, plus honeymoon decoration, can you consider sending fruits?
2. The children’s playground is dirty, messy, and poor compared to Marriott.
3. Free bath towel replacement should be provided near the swimming pool. Marriott wins at this point
4. Waiters in Chinese and western restaurants can be retrained, including chefs who cook in western restaurants

Called for room service, and still fainted when I came back! Chinese food needs to be booked in advance. When I asked, I didn’t say anything about it. It was decided to take the kids down. At that time, there was no table in it. I asked if we waited for others to finish the meal before we ate, and there was no reply! When I’m leaving, I’ll answer the phone and ask how many guests to book? Why do you think I can't afford a meal for one or two thousand? One question and three questions! I booked 2 rooms, one in more than one thousand and one in more than two thousand. In total, I spent money to see people's faces. The service industry is really unacceptable to me! We have also stayed a lot of five-star hotels nationwide. The worst is here. I am very disappointed when I go out and book a Marriott hotel all year round, and I will choose other hotels in the future!

如果要提改正的地方，那就是房間裏的水太太太熱了😂

讓我們很不爽的是：

到了辦好入住後，孩子就要去室外泳池玩去，説實話人不多，但是剛下水就來個服務員讓帶泳帽，我們也買了但是沒帶，救生員後來三番五次的跑過來讓帶且語氣太差了，其實當時有幾個人在泳池玩但也沒帶，催促過程中還拿着手機拍照這個真是太過分了，我們在島內酒店住室外泳池也沒有説必須帶着泳帽這個説法，而且救生員服務員很熱情，這邊泳池救生員服務員態度真是太差勁讓我們感覺很不舒服，尤其是室內泳池的一個大姐救生員牛氣哄哄的，不知道的還以為泳池是她承包的呢！態度極其惡劣。而且室外泳池七點後就不讓下泳池了，這個時間太早了。要是能退款我們肯定就退款了，搞的我們一肚子氣！

作為萬豪旗下平行品牌，真不應該這樣。

msg:一個人心情差，想找個能看海的酒店，入住了就媽呀，瞬間心情好起來，而且附近**吃的也很不錯，在陽台曬着太陽，吃着早餐，絕絕子，早上在床上就可以看日出，酒店右手邊在到右邊直走出去就是海邊   可以在海邊跑道上散步，騎車，有自行車，散心，和男女朋友一起過來入住，真的會不一樣的感受

msg:酒店的第一印象好不好先看小寶寶，剛從企鵝酒店過來的兩位小寶寶感覺很“哇塞”！一進大堂就有一種高級的香味，前台小姐姐很貼心，給了意外驚喜[偷笑]，房間很寬敞，很明亮，對面就是大海，説説感受：外表簡約，細節滿分。
1、嗅覺靈敏的我，沒聞到任何異味，包括衞生間。
2、有熨衣板。
3、熱水很好，下水也很快。
4、酒店外部的戲水池雖然天氣原因不能下水，但依舊特別乾淨、清澈見底。
5、出了院子，像很多海邊親子酒店一樣，過一條公路-大片草坪，然後就是沙灘，沙灘的沙子還算可以，至少海水沒有腥味，配得上萬麗。
6、沖腳淋浴不用掃碼，絕大多數人都知道節約用水，不像很多海濱城市，這方面也成為盈利的一部分。
7、酒店的樂園對於住店客户也是免費暢玩的，很多酒店有次數限制甚至額外收費。
廈門，真的很友好！
我問了小寶寶對比企鵝酒店的感受，小寶寶説“企鵝酒店特別好，這裏雖然沒有企鵝，但這裏特別特別特別好，很完美！”
已經推薦朋友、同事，值得一來！
另外就是之前看了點評很多吐槽服務的，也冒險來了，並沒有感受到被怠慢，反而很温暖，可能這幾天客流比較少了，出來玩心情很重要，不開心的儘快翻篇，朝着開心快樂的方向走！同時也換位思考一下，家裡客人來的多了也難免有招呼不周的情況。戀戀不捨的回去了……我還會再回來的！

早餐：鮮榨果汁吧沒有了，取而代之為常規飲料，除了幾位熱情的經理，其餘服務生非常機械，或許是臨時找來幫忙的吧
晚餐：我去的那天，被帶入座位之後就沒人搭理我了，也沒有菜單，等了10分鐘去前台找服務員，被告知她們都是新來的，對業務還不熟悉（無培訓上崗？是不是應該有長者帶一下比較好
房間：從陽台可以看到三分之一的海，看到最多的是對面的萬豪，北朝向，一天不見陽光…那幾天廈門很冷，房間沒有陽光更冷了
以後節假日不會再來了

오픈한지 얼마되지 않은 호텔이라 그런지 세세한 곳까지 신경쓴 편안한 색감의 인테리어도 기분좋은 경험이었습니다.

酒店的環境服務都不錯，經理王函很貼心的給升級了房型，酒店的自助餐還是挺好的，早餐東西略少了點，但是自助晚餐198還是性價比很高的，海鮮、小龍蝦、燒烤樣樣都有，這個價格沒什麼可挑的了。房間海景不錯，但是面積小了點。
