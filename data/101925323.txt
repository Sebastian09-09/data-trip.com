msg:The hotel is in a resort area. The design of the garden area is very quiet and cozy. The place is relatively remote, suitable for self-driving and for a quiet stay. The room with balcony is too small to live in, but the bedding is clean and comfortable. The breakfast is very simple. The room price for the May Day holiday is too high.

msg:We were very satisfied with both the environment and the service. There were lawn barbecues and karaoke at night, book bars, bars, chess and card rooms, fishing, picking... a lot of entertainment activities, and the service was really perfect and responsive. We drove a sightseeing car around the 5,000-acre forest field, but it was a pity that it rained, otherwise it would be a wonderful enjoyment to ride a bicycle. The room facilities were comfortable, and I chose a room with a terrace, which was quiet and fresh, listening to the sound of wind, rain and birds, this is the way to vacation... I will definitely come again next time!

The ladies at the front desk were very enthusiastic and worthy of praise. There were not many people. It is a great place for people like me who like quietness. It only takes 40 minutes to drive there. In winter, it has a kind of bleak beauty. I will come back in spring and wait for the flowers to bloom.

msg:I didn't expect there is such a big resort on the way to Chaohu Lake. The garden is so big that I didn't finish visiting it. The lady at the front desk said that there are 5,000 acres and many fruit trees are planted, but it is not the season now. There will be fruits to eat in April and May. The scenery is really good. I like the style of the room. There is floor heating in the room. It is so warm, especially this small bay window. It is very comfortable to relax quietly. I also saw a few stray cats. They are very clean and cute. They are not afraid of people. I really want to hug one and take it away. The service staff are very enthusiastic. I will pick fruits to eat when there are fruits.

msg:It was a rare two days of leisure. I played a little late and was tired. I searched on Ctrip and found that it was newly opened. There were not many reviews. At first, I was a little worried that it would be a little off and unsafe. Usually, no one should live there. After placing the order, I received a call from the front desk lady, asking when we would arrive and adjusting the floor heating in the guest room in advance. When we arrived at the door, the guard stopped us and let us in after showing the reservation information. It felt quite formal and safe. After arriving, the hotel front desk lady also thoughtfully upgraded the room for free. It was so warm..., it must be added points. The front desk lady guided us to the room. When passing by the chess and card room, we saw many people playing cards and drinking tea in the chess and card room. After entering the guest room, the floor heating temperature was just right. The room was very clean. It was too dark to see any scenery outside. I took a hot shower and slept beautifully until I woke up naturally the next day. I was woken up by the chirping of birds outside the window in the morning. I was a little angry, but when I saw the beautiful scenery outside the window, I was inexplicably angry. By the way, I heard from the lady at the reception desk that there are thousands of acres of farmland inside and the scenery is beautiful, but I didn’t go in because I was in a hurry. I will definitely come back next time.

We ate the fish recommended by the chef, which was caught in their reservoir. It was really fresh. Recommended👍
We went to the camping area with our girlfriend to set off fireworks at night. It was comfortable.
I will try your tent hotel next time😄

The room is very clean, large, well-equipped, and the service is considerate. A fruit plate is also provided. It is a super five-star experience. Walk out of the room, see the beautiful scenery, listen to the birds singing, breathe fresh air, walk on the tree-lined path, and hum your favorite songs... Invite three or five friends to chat about family matters and life... It is a worthwhile experience, and I will come again next time!

The staff you meet will greet you warmly~ The facilities in the house are relatively high-end. The independent space is very suitable for gatherings of family and friends. In the evening, you can go to the camping area for self-service barbecue and play frisbee. Children can run as much as they want. If there is a chance, I would like to experience picking again. It is a good experience~

We ordered a barbecue at night. The temperature difference between morning and evening is big at the end of October. It is a bit cold outside. The main reason is that I didn’t wear many clothes. Otherwise, it would be suitable for a night tour at night. All services are also in place. Looking forward to staying next time😀😀

店家小姐姐們都超級熱情，服務很棒，臨走前還送了我們新鮮的蔬菜和小禮品！感覺挖掘到了一家寶藏民宿哦～
