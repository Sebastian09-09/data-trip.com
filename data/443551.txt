msg:Great hotel. Across the street from the beach. It's family friendly, and you've got a lot of things for kids. The only thing that is a bit bad is the shape of the hotel. If you take a room with a view it will probably face the pool and the other wing of the hotel, so basically everybody from the other side can see you. So it kinda lacks privacy, but it's great! üôÉ Also, it is a bit noisy sometimes, there is a construction site across the street, but it's really not that bad. Overall, I recommend it primarily to families and everybody else surely won't regret. Needless to say that everything was nice and great. The staff barely speaks English, but they're using the translation app to communicate and they are very helpful.

msg:Setting aside the almost nice view (which every hotel in Sanya has), this is a bargain hotel that charges way too high for what it actually offers. If you need anything or have any questions...get out your translator because nobody speaks English or even accepts visa or Mastercard. The hotel bar is just a corner of the lobby where any staff member who is standing near it will be your bartender, guaranteeing a terrible drink every time. Should you choose to leave early, they will not offer you any refund. In general, it's an underwhelming overpriced hotel. I DO NOT RECOMMEND EVER GOING HERE!!!!

Breakfast was totally worth it (58rmb), good selection of Chinese and western food.You just need to cross the road to be at the beach which was awesome!The pool is placed over the entrance so it gives a nice view, it's quite small tho and there are only like six sunbeds. Overall, I would def recommend it :)

msg:I loved my stay at this Hotel. It‚Äôs really great for families, there‚Äôs an indoor ply space for kids and a life guard at the pool. The hotel is right next to a Pizza Hut and Burger King as well as many local Chinese food restaurants and fruit shops down the street. Its also near a pharmacy and many small shops selling sand toys, swimming clothes, sun hats etc. The beach is right across the street, I walked 5 minutes to the beach and watched the sunset every day.

The amenities are nice, the pool is nice and there is a life guard but you can‚Äôt really see the ocean from the edge. The gym is nice too but doesn‚Äôt open until 10. If I would change anything about the hotel it would just be the gym times. The breakfast is really great! Lots of western and Chinese options, even has many options for vegetarians. 

The hotel is super clean and the staff is very friendly. The beds are soft and comfortable and the water pressure in the shower is nice. Everyday our towels and water bottles were replaced. 

 Sanya Bay is right in the middle of most tourist attractions. The hotel is 20 minutes from DaDongHai and 45 minutes from Yalong bay and Nanshan cultural tourism center. 

The vibe is very good. Very lively at the beach with lots of children playing and Aunties and Uncles dancing in the morning. If you‚Äôre staying at Sanya Bay this is a good choice!

I spent most of the time at the pool which I liked a lot - often pretty empty, nice view to the sea and clean. There is also a great gym if you wanna stay fit during your holidays. The cleaning ladies also did a good daily job. The service was nice. I didn't book the breakfast but on my last day I tried it (78 RMB) and I also enjoyed it a lot - good coffee, fruits, many Chinese options and also some Western food. The location is awesome, the sea and the beach is like 2 mins walk away and there is a bus stop from where you can also go straight o the airport. Love it! I would definitely come back next time!

The city view room had a small view of the sea. The room didn‚Äôt smell and it was clean and modern. I got free drinks one day, randomly to my room. When I left they left me a cute little elephant and a note. The bellhopsmen always opened the door for me to enter the car. I know some reviews posted about bugs but I didn‚Äôt see any. Because the balcony is there if you leave it open you will get bitten but it‚Äôs not the hotels fault. The breakfast was amazing I really loved the pastries. Also, the rooftop pool was cool too. It‚Äôs not a resort but it‚Äôs CLEAN and modern which I like. I would stay here again in Sanya bay cause I feel like it‚Äôs right opposite the sea and very clean and
Modern compared to other places in Sanya bay. Thank you for a pleasant stay. The TV can also screen play from your phone and their is a small shopping center close buy with coffee and Miniso and so it‚Äôs convenient between beach and also shops.

To be honest, being stuck here because of the covid situation somewhat dampens the mood but the hotel has been rather kind to us. I think the situation has been rather unfair to both parties but in this case, the hotel has given all the hotel guests a good rate. I think this is rather commendable considering most are raising their rates first before giving a discount. I know the hotel staff has been putting in extra hours because of limited manpower and in this, I wanted to say a big thank you. I know they‚Äôve worked really hard and I hope the hotel will value their dedication to the job. They don‚Äôt have to be accommodating, really‚Ä¶ in this, even if the hotel has shitty facilities (which isn‚Äôt), I would still choose this place because of the service.

The breakfast served in the hotel is varied with a good selection. Some western style options too. 
The pool only has one entry and exit point. You may have to wade through a bunch of children to get to the deep part. Again, not an issue but a potential consideration. 

Again, cracking little place. For alot of your exploring needs.

msg:The hotel is conveniently located and has a high cost-effectiveness. I read some bad reviews before, but I didn't encounter them in my personal experience. When I checked in, the guy at the front desk upgraded the room type to the 10th floor. The room was not facing the street, so I couldn't hear the noise on the road. But when I smoked on the balcony during the day, I could hear the horn of the square dance aunt. The hotel is right by the sea. There is no well-known beach and it is near the intersection, so the hotel price is not expensive, which is a reflection of the high cost-effectiveness. If you want it, you are playing with it.

The hotel breakfast is good and the food is rich. The swimming pool is great, and the outdoor opening time is also long. I swam three times in two days.

In terms of service, the concierge was very active in opening and closing the car door, greeting, and helping with luggage. He had something in his eyes and work in his hands. The other staff were enthusiastic and positive, and everyone had a sunny smile, which was really Sanya.

In terms of hygiene, except that when I took the hair dryer, there was hair falling out of the hair dryer bag, which made me feel a little awkward, I didn't encounter anything else.

Next time I come to Sanya, this will be my first choice.

The space was large, the facilities were brand new, and there was a small balcony for drying and washing clothes.
The best thing was that the restaurant manager was very good, gentle and considerate. We had breakfast with a complete variety and it was hygienic and delicious. We went to Yiheng to eat at the night market, but it was not delicious and hygienic. Finally, we had a seafood buffet hot pot in the hotel restaurant. The taste was also very good and there were many varieties. The children ate very well and said it was delicious. I strongly recommend it. Don‚Äôt eat outside because it‚Äôs expensive and unhygienic. The children felt that I arranged the Golden Phoenix Hotel this time and were very satisfied.

Golden Phoenix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot a five-star hotel, but it is much worse than a three-star hotel.

Cleanliness: Extremely worrying. When I checked in, there were several long hairs in the pool, straws on the ground next to the desk, and even the matching slippers were wet. I simply don't dare to stay in such a dirty hotel with peace of mind.

Facilities: Old and shabby, purely based on photos. Especially the supporting gym has nothing to think about. The photos are genuine. The design of the sink is not reasonable at all. There is no place to put toiletries at all.

Environment: The surrounding environment is really noisy and the sound insulation effect is extremely poor. The hotel is at a crossroads with a lot of vehicles. In the beach square opposite, there are people dancing in the square from morning to night. Book carefully if you are afraid of the noise.

There are also complimentary drinks. Although I did not upgrade the room, I will choose to book here next time if I come here. This is my favorite hotel during this trip to Sanya. The overall a**osphere is not bad. What is particularly worthy of praise is that the breakfast is very rich. I like it the most. The girl who makes coffee at the door is also very nice. There is also an infinity swimming pool. If you travel during off-peak hours with the gym, you can choose. The facilities here are not as old as everyone said, but they are not as smart, but the price/performance ratio is also good.

Opposite is Haiyue Plaza, next door is KFC Miniso Supermarket, and there is a hospital nearby. The advantage is that it has a sea view and is lively and convenient. The disadvantage is that the square dance BGM accompanied by the sound of vehicle horns is not suitable for people who like quiet. Remember, the breakfast is only NT$58 per person, but it has everything you need. The staff are also very enthusiastic. The whole hotel feels honest and energetic. I suggest increasing the water pressure in the bathroom and optimizing those cabinets, which are really difficult to open...

The location of the hotel, the service of the staff, and the variety of breakfast were all very good. But it is a pity that the hotel is near the terminal of the marathon, and there will definitely be marathon runners staying there. The marathon runners gathered early and could not catch up with breakfast. However, the hotel failed to warmly think of preparing a hotel for the marathon guests. An emergency breakfast. We have been to many cities to run marathons. Some hotels are very considerate because the breakfast start time is later than for horse runners. When checking in, they tell guests that if they are participating in a marathon, they can show their number in the morning. Sign in to pick up breakfast at the front desk. This way you will feel that the hotel's service is really attentive.

Since we didn‚Äôt have enough time, we agreed with Ms. Zhang Ling at the front desk to go to the hotel late to go through the room change procedures. After two hours, Ms. Zhang Ling at the front desk informed the concierge staff to move our luggage from the original room to the new room. Since we were traveling south, we had more luggage than me. When we went to the front desk, we asked Zhang Ling When the lady expressed her gratitude and apology, Miss Zhang Ling said: "I will help the guests solve their problems." Making guests happy while traveling in Sanya is the purpose of their work!

msg:Facilities: Average, quite satisfactory. The design of the wash basin is a bit weird. The sink protrudes very high, but when you wash your hands, it gets all over the outside. There is no place to put skin care products and cosmetics. There is no place at all. The weather is hot in the room. I was very happy that Coca-Cola was given, but when I opened the refrigerator, I saw that it was at room temperature. I called the service staff and was told that the function of the refrigerator is to maintain room temperature? ? ? The function of the refrigerator in Sanya is to maintain normal temperature? It can't be refrigerated, which I really can't understand.
Hygiene: There is scale on the kettle, and there is hair on the back of the door. The shampoo and shower gel is in a small bottle, but it feels like it is canned. There are traces of white shower gel on the bottle, and it is also old. I don‚Äôt go to the big bottle. Woolen cloth.

Environment: It's okay. The hotel seems to have only 6 floors. I'm on the 4th floor. I can only see a little bit of the seaside. I looked over.

Service: Because I had to go to the duty-free shop relatively early the next day, I made an appoin**ent for a wake-up call at 8 o'clock. I didn't receive a message at noon and completely forgot about it.

The hotel is located in the city and close to the road, so the transportation is relatively convenient, but it may be a bit noisy during the day. But all in all it was a good housing experience.

At that time, I thought it was newer and cleaner than the Sheraton next door, so I decisively chose this hotel again this time. But this time there was no service and no environment. The room I was given at first had a really strong and fishy smell, so I changed the room and the hotel also said they would give me fruits as a gift (but I came here in May this year and got a fruit plate). and coffee were brought to me). The room I changed was not clean either. One of the beds in the twin room was moldy... I didn't think about pursuing them like this. It's not easy for everyone to work. But the hotel directly told me that if I didn't check out after two o'clock, the room would be automatically renewed. Then we explained to him that we would be ready soon, but he forced us to renew the room for 193 until 18:00. I have never seen a hotel like this and will never come here again. Moreover, the sea view room I booked for my mother did not have a sea view at all, but the staff were very friendly in April and May, so my stay was very pleasant.

msg:After staying in Tianyu for two days and then staying at Golden Phoenix, I think Golden Phoenix won a lot. I really can't find anything that I'm not satisfied with. First of all, because the room was too expensive for the last night, I chose a city room that didn't look at the sea. When I went out and crossed the road, I was very close to the sea. There was construction outside but it wasn't noisy. I checked out the next day. It was only when I checked into the room that I discovered that there was construction, which did not affect my rest at all. When I came in, I was surprised that the room was very clean and new. I was satisfied with every corner. Secondly, because the child was asleep, I was allowed to delay my check-out until 2 o'clock for free. As a result, when I checked out after two o'clock, the cleaning lady said to clean it first. The other rooms let him sleep a little longer. Finally, I ordered a set meal of shiitake mushrooms and chicken. The food was very clean, the portions were ample and delicious. I didn‚Äôt expect that one set meal contained so much. Thanks to the good reviews, I will stay here again. Take a nap and go to the hotel's children's playground. At 5 o'clock, I go to the beach to take pictures of the sunset, which is also very beautiful. This is the first time I dedicate my photos to this hotel

The soundproofing of the room is very, very, very poor. The sound of the chair being dragged upstairs is very loud, which greatly affects sleep. The door is not soundproofed. People will make sounds when they walk by. At night, there will be a thumping sound. I don‚Äôt know where it comes from.

The hotel I reported for the tour group was not here. I directly changed the hotel to this one and stayed for another day. , in short, the two most comfortable places to visit in Sanya are the Golden Phoenix Hotel and the Yanoda Tropical Rainforest. The other places are hard to describe and can only be described as a scam.

It is quite noisy before 21:00 in the evening, and there is a square dancing team across the street. The hotel swimming pool and children's playground are both on the third floor and are relatively small. Breakfast is on the first floor. It costs RMB 58 per serving without breakfast. It is not very tasty. It is not as good as the coconut snack on the left hand side after exiting the hotel or eating on the street behind. There is a small shopping mall next to it, which is convenient and cheap for replenishing supplies. Their room card is 50 yuan/card lost, so everyone must keep it safe.

msg:The location is very convenient, just opposite Haiyue Plaza. The room is very new after renovation and the air conditioning works very well. But I am really disappointed with the service, especially the so-called duty manager at 10.8pm. That afternoon, my dad went downstairs alone to look at the surrounding environment. On the way from the parking lot to the nearby shopping mall, he accidentally tripped over the car stall and fell. The screen of his mobile phone was cracked. When my dad went upstairs, we found that his knee was broken. My hand was bruised, but my body was fine. After discussing it, we went downstairs immediately to get the phone repaired. The little brother at the door knew our situation and immediately called a car for us. We went to the mobile phone store, but unfortunately the screen was out of stock and we needed to order it. Considering that we were flying home the next day, we decided to bring it back Repair the home again. Back at the hotel, we hoped to say hello to the little brother who helped us at that time, but unfortunately the little brother was away after get off work. Then we wanted to find the person in charge of the hotel and advise them that the car stalls in the parking lot were unsafe, otherwise there might be people in a similar situation to us. The so-called manager on duty did not offer any comfort and asked about my dad's injury directly. He said that the hotel had no responsibility and my father was an adult. Shengshi Lingren's attitude was as if we were trying to blackmail the hotel. Moreover, 5-6 people came to the hotel and helped the manager on duty to attack us. When the communication was fruitless and our own safety could not be protected, we called the police, and the police at the police station helped us coordinate with the hotel. Finally, at the suggestion of the police, the so-called manager on duty reluctantly agreed to send a car to take us there the next day. The airport, until the very end, did not offer an apology or acknowledge the problems with the hotel facilities. My father, who is almost 80 years old, was also very angry with them. You can look at the photos of the car stalls. Only one side has a yellow mark, but not the other. There are no signs in the parking lot to warn you about not walking or to pay attention to your steps. Please take this as a warning and choose appropriately.

Including intercity buses, scenic spots around Sanya and Lingshui can be reached, and it can also be directly connected to the airport and high-speed rail station, making travel very convenient. If you are not in a hurry, it is very suitable to stay in a hotel, slowly visit the scenic spots, and do an in-depth tour. The hotel's breakfast is also very good, with rich varieties, warm service, and prompt hygiene.
Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings of the hotel: the waterproof *****s in the hotel shower room. It was completely useless. As soon as I took a shower, the floor of the washbasin outside was covered with water. The hotel slippers were full of holes. It was very uncomfortable even if you stepped in the cold water, and it was easy to slip. The top of the small bar in the hotel is covered in dust, which may be due to lack of hygiene. In addition, there is no towel rack in the hotel bathroom. Used towels can only be placed on the shower room handle. There is no storage basket in the bathroom. There is no place to put wet towels or towels that need to be changed. There is a very narrow shelf against the wall, where the hair dryer is placed, but there is no room for large towels.

msg:During the whole trip of more than a week in Sanya, this was the worst hotel I stayed in. The service attitude is really bad. The waiters at the breakfast area are more aggressive than the instructors in military training. They are carefree and shout when they open their mouths. If the hotel is dissatisfied, it can adjust the monitoring. The health situation is also worrying. Overall it is really bad.

Our balcony is not facing Sanya Bay, but we can also see a small piece of sea area. My friend's room is facing the sea view, and the view is very good. The sanitation needs a little attention. I saw the corpse of the bug, but it didn't affect my experience of staying in the hotel. The rooms all have balconies, which are very convenient for enjoying the cool or drying swimsuits. There is a shuttle bus that can go directly to the tax-free lobby. You can consider staying again next time.

msg:Very bad check-in experience. In the sea view room, you need to turn sideways on the balcony to see it. It's really funny. The toilet smelled back at night and turned into a gas bomb. I closed the toilet door for one night and let it go the next day. The waiters couldn't stand the smell even when they entered the room to check. The funniest thing was that when we checked into another hotel, they said that our facial recognition was not turned off and the front desk staff had the same working ability. This hotel has blocked us for the rest of our lives.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed here, and I am super satisfied. As a transit hotel in the city, it is beyond expectations. The shopping mall next to it is convenient for replenishment, and there are a lot of food. It is only a few steps away from the beach.
The sea view room I booked this time has a perfect front sea view.
The breakfast is also of a good standard, with rich meals and timely replenishment. Personally, I feel that it is not inferior to the Sofitel and Tianyu that I went to later.
The infinity pool is the children's favorite, and they have a great time every time.
I hope to maintain the standard, and I will choose this place next time I go to Sanya.

The bed was not very comfortable, and the quilt was so hot that I was sweating all over. The so-called elegant sea view In the room, you can only stand on the balcony and see the "line of sea" from the side; fortunately, I bought the no-reason cancellation insurance. After staying for one night, I negotiated with Ctrip customer service to cancel the next two days, so I left it early in the morning. The key was returned to the front desk, but the hotel still insisted that I go back to check out before 12 noon, which is really ridiculous~ However, it is in the city after all, and the neighborhood is quite convenient. There are supermarkets, restaurants, food stalls, and food stalls~ Overall Not suitable for family travel ~

The water in the swimming pool was so dirty and not disinfected (how would I know? Look at the back). The room is on the third floor, and the balcony opens to face the swimming pool. The waiter told me that the hotel structure only has rooms on the lower floors. When I stood downstairs, I saw that the upper floors were the same. In the end, I was urged to check out over and over again. I agreed at two o'clock (normal time) and warned that half a day's room fee would be charged after two o'clock. The front desk called twice and asked whether I should check out after the check-out time (actually it was a urging). The experience was too great. Worse. goodbye.

It was almost 11 o'clock in the evening when we arrived at the hotel. I originally thought that the reception in the lobby might not be very good, but when we got off the bus, there was still a guy who helped me carry my luggage. Maybe it was because I arrived late that the room type I originally booked was no longer available. The front desk was very kind and upgraded me to a sea view room. The room is also great, the small balcony is not too comfortable to sit and watch the sunset! Auntie cleans the room every day and does a good job. All in all, it was very good. I came to Sanya alone as a girl, so I was always a little worried about being unsafe, but the hotel was great and I didn't feel unsafe at all. The services in all aspects were very good.

msg:I'm here to write a good review.
1‚É£Ô∏èThe decoration facilities in the room are relatively new. The ordinary twin room also has a balcony. The interior is simple and refreshing, and the bathroom is spacious and bright. (Tea bags and Sprite Coke in the fridge are free)
2‚É£Ô∏èThe location is superior, just across the road is the beach; there are shops such as KFC Ruixing downstairs, and a mini shopping mall; it is very convenient to go to Yiheng Night Market, Mingzhu Plaza, Wanghao, and a taxi costs about 10 yuan.
3‚É£Ô∏è Cheap! What kind of bicycle do you need for three hundred and fifty-one nights.
I saw some bad reviews on the Internet, and I will objectively evaluate it based on my personal experience. In terms of sound insulation, if someone walks and talks in the corridor and closes the door, you can indeed hear it, but very occasionally, you are not disturbed by the noise when you sleep at night. In terms of service attitude, the welcome and front desk I met were not bad, they were very enthusiastic, and they were also very talkative when checking out late. The room was also very clean, without any water stains.
There are two other points that are not considered disadvantages. One is that there is a bit of burnt smoke smell when we enter the room. We can't feel it after staying for a while, and some people may mind; the other is that this place is not suitable for "soaking in hotels". Children's paradise swimming pool I went to the gym, it's relatively small.
In short, I think the cost performance is very high, recommended

I started to consider three surrounding hotels. I chose this place because Golden Phoenix has a large swimming pool. It's good to swim after the sun goes down.
The waiters in the lobby are very enthusiastic. Zeng Qikai helped to store the luggage twice. It is convenient to store luggage before check-in and after check-out

There is a bus stop at the door, and you can take the bus no matter you go to Phoenix Airport or Nanshan and Tianya Haijiao tourist areas. The hotel also has a bus to Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop, and you can take a free bus to Atlantis Water World. The seaside is across the road from the hotel. The children go to the beach to play in the sea every day, and they are very happy. There is also an infinity pool on the third floor of the hotel, the scenery is great! The rooms are clean and tidy, equipped with a balcony for drying swimwear, and equipped with a small refrigerator, which is suitable for storing fruit drinks, etc. The waiters cleaned it very well, especially the waiter Luo Xiuping cleaned us very neatly! The staying experience is very good, and I will recommend it to relatives and friends.

Except for a few boys, the front desk staff all have expressionless faces, let alone consider the guests. They start explaining the questions asked by the guests before they have finished speaking. Really speechless! Furthermore, the Chinese restaurant's service speed was 45 minutes before the first dish could be served. This was the case on both nights. But objectively speaking, the quality of the product is still good. In short, the location is 5 stars; the equipment and facilities are 4 stars, and the service is 1 star. Those who don't care about the service can fully meet the needs.

On the morning of leaving the store, I went to the swimming pool to swim for a while. The water was very clean, and I could see the coastline in the distance. There is also a special children's playground and fitness equipment next to it, which is really pretty good.

I was satisfied with the result, because I chose a new one with a relatively new opening time, and I made a lot of tips It's convenient to go anywhere from the station. Crossing the road is the Coconut Dream Corridor. Most hotels in Sanya Bay have outdated facilities. I didn't expect this hotel to be very new and clean. Thanks to Ctrip for upgrading the room and the flight delay caused it The tiredness of the journey was wiped away. Although it was a rainy day, I opened the window and saw the beautiful scenery. The room was very cool. The window was closed, there was no need to turn on the air conditioner, and there were no mosquitoes. It was really not too cool, and the disposable bedding that I brought was useless. . The service is very considerate, and the swimming pool is also guarded by professionals. The gym is on the third floor, which is very convenient. It‚Äôs also very pleasant to order takeaway from the room after two days of rain. The hotel‚Äôs evening buffet is really cost-effective, and eating out is too expensive, so dinner Breakfast can be enjoyed at the hotel ü§óü§óü§ó

It should be It's a little more expensive. I face another hotel, and it looks good when the lights are on at night. The room was cleaned every day which was great.

There is a bus stop at the other door of the hotel to go to Luhuitou and Nanshan scenic spots. It is really convenient. I will definitely come again next time. It‚Äôs funny that the back door is connected to the back door of KFC. Every day I sit in the restaurant and eat the buffet breakfast looking at KFC. There are no shortcomings, it is a very high-end hotel, but this season is really too hot, in fact, it is only 30 degrees, but it is too humid, and you will sweat when you go out. It's really convenient to stay at a different time next time, highly recommended

msg:I landed at Sanya Airport in the middle of the night and chose the Golden Phoenix Hotel, which is close to the airport. I booked it on Ctrip. The room type is a twin room with city view. When I made the reservation, I made an appoin**ent for the bed sharing service. It was already two o‚Äôclock in the morning when I arrived at the hotel. Entering the lobby, you can smell the fragrance of flowers, which is tangy! The tiredness from the three-hour flight was gone in an instant!
The front desk checked us in very quickly. After entering the room, everything exceeded my expectations. The room is clean and tidy, and the hotel also sent drinks. The interior decoration, facilities and supplies all look brand new! At night, there is an internet celebrity wall at the entrance of the bar next to the lobby where you can take pictures and check in! Remember, it must be before ten o'clock!

(Actually, when I booked this hotel, I read a lot of reviews on Ctrip and Qunar, both good and bad, but most of them said that the sound insulation effect is not very good, there are various problems with the room facilities, and the service is not good. How about it, I was very worried when I made the reservation, but I also considered that I only stayed here for a day and a half, and I was not there during the day. Other hotels with the same score as him and the same content of negative reviews were all higher than its price. I finally still select it)
I posted a video that was recorded during the day. I saw on the Internet that the noise was very loud, which affected my rest. After the actual experience, I feel fine! I'm a light sleeper, and I wasn't woken up by the noise in the corridor. I feel that the sound insulation is good, and it's not as bad as it says on the Internet!

I like the lobby very much, because as soon as I walk into the lobby, there is a scent of flowers! During the stay, the child's foot was scratched. I also went to the lobby to ask for a band-aid, and also went to the lobby to pick up a courier. Through these two exchanges with the front desk staff in the lobby, I found that they were not very enthusiastic, did not smile, and were not very positive! But I understand that my room rate for this night is only 340 yuan, which should be the lowest price in the nearby hotels. I hope the hotel owner can increase the wages of the employees. I believe the employees will be more enthusiastic and actively serve customers! I believe this hotel should be full! Because of its location and hotel facilities are basically hard! So, get a raise!
According to my personality, I will not stay in the same hotel for the second time, but this hotel really exceeded my expectations! The price/performance ratio is too high, what I want to say is, I will give you a second swipe!

There are aunts who dance in the square in the morning and evening on the opposite side. The music is very loud, but they all disperse after ten o'clock.

There are buses or buses to various attractions. There is KFC Pizza Hut behind the bus and a big supermarket to buy things. It‚Äôs convenient to buy a lot of things without bringing them here. Personally, I think Haiyue Square is very lively. Even if it‚Äôs a little noisy, it‚Äôs over after ten o‚Äôclock. The hotel‚Äôs rooms are very comfortable and clean. The facilities are complete. The balcony can directly see the sea. The staff provide good service. The hotel‚Äôs buffet is also very good The food is delicious and the bus to the duty-free shop is really loved.

Seeing that the reviews were good, I placed an order. The minimalist decoration feels very clean, and the bathroom is also good. The garden view room was pretty good, but next to the construction site, it was a bit noisy. The loudest thing was the buzzing sound of the air conditioner in the room next door. This price is in such a good location in the urban area, it's okay, and we can't ask too much. Overall, it is recommended as a transit. There is no breakfast, we went to the authentic Baoluo powder next to the No. 1 seafood market to eat, an unexpected harvest, delicious üòã

There is a Womei supermarket next to the hotel. Shopping is super convenient. The hotel is just across the road from the Coconut Dream Corridor~ The concierge reception downstairs is very warm~the hotel has a rich breakfast~

Poor experience: 1‚É£Ô∏èTwin room, when I slept on the first night, my bed made abnormal noises. I turned over and made a noise when I moved a little. I was afraid of disturbing my friends. I didn‚Äôt dare to raise my arms all night. I reported it to the hotel the next day. , the waitress who came looked at it and said, "It's just like this~", I insisted that I couldn't rest like this, and the other bed didn't have this kind of abnormal noise, so the waiter choked out a sentence, let people take a look, Can you make the bed quiet? Me: Of course it‚Äôs ok~ That‚Äôs why I asked the master to make the bed~ 2‚É£Ô∏èDuring the hotel‚Äôs breakfast, I took a plate from the tableware place, and found that there were appetite residues on it; I took a cup of milk, and found that there was lipstick on the mouth of the cup; I changed the cup again and found that there was a white mark on it (not the kind of water stain mark); 3‚É£Ô∏èThe sound insulation of the room is relatively poor, and I clearly heard "good luck" playing in a loop in the morning. I don't know if it is the phone ring or something. Furthermore, the corridor The back and forth sound and the sound from the neighbors are very clear. Compared with the hotel where I stayed in the previous two days, the sound insulation is obviously not ideal~

When I drove out on the night of the 22nd, the security guard insisted that I go to another door to bypass. The problem was that he opened the doors for the two cars in front. He gave me up, and I followed him and refused to let me out. I didn‚Äôt know if the car I rented was a bit low-end. We argued for five minutes. Finally, I said, is this the service attitude of your hotel? Then he cursed me. After opening the door, I went out and heard something unknown behind me. I was in a bad mood after being out for a night. The hired security guards probably came in through the back door. . .

I didn't expect to see someone outside the curtain. It turned out that the swimming pool was on the third floor. There is a small gym and a very small children's playground. The things in the hotel are not cheap. I bought a Haagen-Dazs for the children. The small bowl costs 60 yuan. There is a square opposite the hotel. Once you arrive There are singing and dancing at night, there are all kinds of dances, there are all kinds of dances, there is a beach behind the square, there are a lot of people, the beach is a bit steep, and children are welcome.

The sanitation is average, the pillows are not very comfortable, and the room fee of more than 800 is not worth it. There is a high probability that I will not stay again.

The downside is that each room will give you a cup of cappuccino coffee, but the guy at the water bar has been away, so I asked the front desk person to make coffee, but it was less than a quarter of a cup. I asked her why, and she said she would go I asked someone else to ask, but it disappeared. I managed to find her again. She may have never seen a customer like me, but she picked it up again.

When I checked in, I clearly stated that I wanted a relatively quiet room, but it turned out that I was arranged upstairs above the kitchen vent. It would be better to live in the airport! Couldn't sleep at all. The hotel is close to the road and the community, and the breakfast is at the level of a fast hotel. The washbasin, toilet, and entry into the room are all in one bay, with no partitions at all. After taking a shower, the floor is full of water. Adults are prone to fall, let alone the elderly and children! I never comment, and I am not harsh, just passable. This hotel must be rated badly! If there is a problem that is not solved in time, and the delay is negative, please don't live here.

I saw that the newly renovated Golden Phoenix Hotel is a five-star hotel with convenient transportation. , I chose Golden Phoenix without hesitation. Because the hotel did not reserve a room as required, in order to apologize, the hotel sent a fruit plate and breakfast early in the morning. A young man at the front desk surnamed Yang had a good service attitude. But the hardware facilities of the hotel can only meet the standard of a business hotel. Looking at the mini washstand and a small swimming pool built on the platform above the gate, Ctrip actually listed luxury, five-star, which is a bit deceiving.

The lady at the front desk told us The room type can directly see the sea as long as you nod a little bit, and the floor is also very suitable. The only regret is that I haven't been to the swimming pool. But it takes two steps to reach the Coconut Dream Corridor, the seaside. Especially the attitude of the little brother in the concierge depar**ent is simply too good! He talked to us with a smile all the way, and helped us with our luggage when we left.

The standard five-star Wanda Realm in Haitang Bay is only 4.4 points, but it can definitely be called 4.6 points. The room is 50 square meters, the bathroom and wardrobe include the room view and hotel facilities and the seaside The private beach here is simply different from the sky and the earth here. If you live in a four-star or five-star hotel in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, the hotel‚Äôs room is considered a three- or four-star standard. From the elevator to the room corridor to the room, it is at best the feeling of a JI hotel. At most, the elegant sea view is not directly facing the sea view. Yes, it‚Äôs the side of the hotel, especially if the right side of the hotel is very depressing. The price is more than 1200 on New Year‚Äôs Day, and more than 650 on a daily basis. It can only be said that it is close to the airport and the location of the hotel is okay. Not to mention, as shown in the picture, Just 4 points is fair enough. The floor height of the lobby is relatively high and the overall level is higher than that of the rooms.

msg:I used the government consumption voucher of UnionPay, which is equivalent to 300/night to live in a sea view room. The hotel also upgraded it to a suite for free. It has a large area and two balconies. You can see the sea directly when you open the door. super cool!

Seeing that I drank water quickly when I caught a cold, I even gave two barrels of mineral water thoughtfully. I was moved üò≠ There is a duty-free shop shuttle bus, which runs every morning and afternoon, which is very convenient ~ I will stay here next time I come to Sanya!

Considering that we are getting older, the manager upgraded us to a sea-facing room on the seventh floor for free, thank you very much.

I searched for hotels in Sanya Bay on Ctrip and found that this Golden Phoenix has a good reputation, so I booked it with the attitude of trying it. I am very satisfied when I come to the hotel. The lobby is stylish and an elegant piano comes into view. The front desk service is very friendly, the check-in is fast, and the overall is satisfied. A suggestion, we were originally here for vacation, we just wanted to sleep peacefully and wake up naturally. At 10 o'clock, the staff asked me if I had breakfast and whether I wanted to send it to the room. I wanted to cry without tears, the hotel management It's a good idea, but for our family, it's too bad. I can't sleep in if I want to. Please don't rush me to breakfast in the future. Others are fine. The next day, because I had to go out to play early, I went to the restaurant for breakfast, and found that the variety was very rich, and the chefs and waiters were very enthusiastic.

Stayed here again this time, there are a lot of people, but the location is very good. But because I only booked one night and wanted to renew the room, the same room was not available. I really hope that the hotel can give a little convenience because it is an old customer!(‡πë‚Ä¢ÃÄ„ÖÇ‚Ä¢ÃÅ)Ÿà‚úß. Unfortunately, no, so I had to check out and choose the hotel next to it.
I would like to say that the front desk of the hotel can arrange two more people, so as to provide enough services to customers, the front desk staff can be regarded as an intuitive service model of the hotel. It took a while to get the service.

Hygiene: The ceiling fan in the room is so dirty that you can touch it with ashes, and when you open the room, dust falls off. It's really 666
There are also broken lights. I am speechless. I spent seven or eight hundred to experience a hotel like yours. I will decide to change to another hotel on the third day.

The big bed room is 90¬∞ to see the sea, not the kind of feeling that you can see the sea when you push the door, which is a pity. The orientation of the twin room is relatively much better, and you can directly see the sea.
The breakfast is rich in variety and very hygienic. Nucleic acid near the hotel is also more convenient. Overall, the value for money is not bad, the hotel is very new.

So what about swimming in the pool? The front desk stopped ringing. Later, I saw that many guests sitting in the lobby did not wear masks, and no staff came to remind me. I told the front desk that you are really double standards. These people did not wear them, and no one to remind. Then I went to the swimming pool on the top floor, and I wanted a lifebuoy for 10 yuan each. Why don't the reclining chairs and chairs charge together? Why is there no charge for gym equipment? Very nice. Then there was a takeaway storage cabinet downstairs that couldn't be taken out for a long time. I looked for the security guard at the door and the front desk staff. They didn't help. It's too bad. will come again

The room is bigger than expected, the bathroom and balcony are beyond imagination, the area is large and clean, and the bed is comfortable.
Sound insulation is OK, there is no noise in the room, sleep is quiet, the sound insulation at the door is not good, and the sound in the room can be heard in the corridor.
The hotel parking lot is free and there is no need to worry about parking spaces. Although there are no new energy charging piles, there is a special call after driving one kilometer along the seaside. There are many piles and the charging speed is fast. The most important thing is the seaside. It is very pleasant to look at the sea while charging.
The location of the hotel is excellent. Downstairs is Sanya Bay. There are many things to do, such as motor boats and wake surfing. There are also many delicacies nearby. There are many choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner, such as Pizza Hut KFC Ruixing Coffee, and various seafood and coconut chicken restaurants.
The hotel facilities are also complete, swimming pool gym and restaurant are ok.
There were a lot of guests staying in July. It was very late when we drove from Haikou to the store. It was a pity that the two rooms could not be arranged adjacent to each other. The sea view on the 6th floor is ok, but the 4th floor is really hard to see. Personally, I think it is better to choose the city view on the lower floor.
Another thing to complain about is that the deposit charged by the hotel when checking in said that it would be refunded after leaving the hotel. As a result, it took a week to find that the deposit had not been refunded. After calling the front desk for consultation, it was refunded within a few minutes. What if I didn't find it? Hope to pay more attention.
In general, the hotel is still very good, the price is really high, it is really more cost-effective than the Four Points Sheraton next to it, haha, the best choice in Sanya Bay.

The angle is also oblique. The Sheraton Crowne Plaza is good and the price is not more expensive than here. I advise everyone to stay in chain hotels. Internet celebrity hotels are all fake. Find a few people to use traffic to deceive consumers. This is my worst experience in Sanya in recent years. Poor reviews. bad review

msg:Highly recommend! Golden Key is a member hotel, with very thoughtful and meticulous service, and high cost performance. I brought a family to Sanya because of the convenient transportation and the sea view. I chose this hotel as the first choice. After reporting that I was also the golden key of Shenzhen, the golden key of the hotel, Gao Zhi, personally received him and introduced the hotel facilities, tour routes, tickets for attractions, etc. Kind and satisfying, and a small gift for children, it adds a lot of surprises to the tiring self-driving journey. Perhaps this is the service concept of Golden Key Satisfaction and Surprise. ps. The superior sea view room is very worth experiencing. The sea is in front of the window. It is very pleasant to drink a small wine while blowing the sea breeze on the balcony at night. pps. The swimming pool on the third floor is very good and clean. It is recommended to go for a swim when the sun goes down to avoid the sun, and there is a gym next to it (all free). ppps. The breakfast is very rich, Chinese and Western styles are available, and you can go out to play when you are full. Have a great time everyone!

The price/performance ratio is super high, and there is absolutely no odor, unlike some international big names (who spend money to buy sins, and die from mildew). Golden Phoenix will be the only one I will visit in Sanya in the future.
There is a flaw in the room type I like, there is a problem with the air conditioning design!
*17*18 Remember to check in! When the air conditioner is turned on, a gap of more than 10 cm should be left between the door of the bedroom and the dry toilet, and the inspection port of the ceiling should be opened.

If the Phoenix Airport is in and out of Sanya, the airport bus and the No. 8/27 bus can be taken at the bus platform outside the gate. I took Airport Line 1 to Haiyue Square Station at 12:00 in the middle of the night, got off the bus and looked up opposite the hotel, so kind. There is a direct bus to the International Duty Free City from the platform at the entrance, No. 34, and the last bus back to the city is at 22:00 in the evening. Across the road is the sea, you can walk in the morning/evening. If you don't have a meal at the hotel, you can come out of the hotel and turn left on Foreign Trade Road. There are many restaurants, so you should be able to be frugal. The a**osphere inside the hotel is quiet and the service staff is very good. The room facilities are simple and comfortable. Will come to live next time.

The kind who check out less than an hour after checking in and run away
First of all, the hotel's sound insulation equipment is particularly poor. Through the door, you can clearly hear people walking and talking in the corridor and closing the door, as well as the sound of watching TV at the door, just like watching TV.
The second is the false propaganda of the hotel, the actual room is seriously inconsistent with the propaganda photos, the interior space of the room is small, two people can't turn around in the corridor, and the whole space is very narrow;
The most important thing is the attitude and efficiency of the hotel staff to deal with the relevant content of our complaints. After checking in less than half an hour, they called to ask about the sound insulation and asked to return the room for the next day. I had already checked in that day, so I just wanted to make do with it. After staying, the hotel proposed to change the room and blamed the problem of room sound insulation on the child on the opposite side who opened the door to watch TV, and threw the blame on other guests. Regarding the follow-up tripartite communication with Ctrip and the hotel, the hotel has always had different rhetoric towards Ctrip and us. In the end, it insisted on not being able to withdraw, and put on an attitude of loving it. There was no positive solution to the problem at all. It has been back and forth to shirk responsibility.
In general, I have come to Sanya several times, and have stayed in so many hotels. I have never seen such a poorly equipped hotel and such outrageous staff.

When I went to the front desk to handle it, they said no, it was completely confusing! The price of breakfast is different from the price listed on Ctrip. It is said that the price is the same for the new year... With the child, I will be leaving the airport by plane soon, so I am too lazy to care about it. I didn't have the takeaway order for breakfast on the second day, and the overall management is very poor. , The price is relatively high during the Chinese New Year, I recognized it! Usually up to five hundred dollars! For customers, what is expensive is worth what is expensive. It is worth it, and it is also recognized and happy.

msg:Sanya Golden Phoenix Seaview Hotel is located at No. 63 Sanya Bay Road, Tianya Town.

The third stop in Sanya chose the lively Tianya District, which is relatively close to the airport.

The location of Golden Phoenix is really good. To the west is a whole piece of the sea. The whole road close to the sea is the famous Coconut Dream Corridor. You can pick up all kinds of shells on the beach. There is a shopping mall next to the hotel. Supermarkets, KFC, etc., and a little further east there are various restaurants.

The advantage of the hotel is that it is new. It was just built in 2020. The disadvantage is that it is small. The size of an ordinary room is the size of a fast chain store outside. It has at most a small balcony and no bathtub. After all, the hotel itself is a five-diamond luxury hotel. The size feels a bit different from that of a luxury hotel.

The service is very good, especially Ms. Zheng at the front desk is enthusiastic. She also arranged a honeymoon room for me. The aunt who cleaned the room was also very polite. She would knock on the door and enter the room every day to clean up the garbage for us.

The type of breakfast is okay, but the quality is not good. I go to the restaurant every day at nine o'clock. Many foods are cold, such as porridge, tomato and egg sauce. In addition, I also drank super light milk the next day, which should have been added a lot of water.

The buffet breakfast has a wide variety of Chinese and Western flavors in place, satisfying my travelers who regard the quality of the buffet breakfast as their first requirement in choosing a hotel. I especially recommend the Chinese restaurant on the first floor of the hotel, which is completely up to the level of a Jinjiang chef. Although not many diners were affected by the epidemic, it did not affect the quality of every dish at all. To be honest, you can only look at the Internet celebrity restaurant outside. Maybe because of the large number of diners, the dishes are not what you like. Later, I ordered food in this restaurant of the hotel. The infinity pool is very good, and the hotel entrance is the seaside, which is convenient for all kinds of conveniences.

The most pleasant surprise is that the hotel also has a security guard who specializes in guarding electric cars! Don't worry too much! In the evening, I went to the swimming pool on the third floor to swim, and there were people dancing square dance at Haiyue Square on the opposite side, especially like at home haha. There are shopping malls around, easy to eat, too hot to order takeaway in the room, there are many choices! The room I booked also delivered afternoon tea for two persons, the quality is good! The hotel staff is very nice to help pick up the luggage when they come and help put the luggage on the car. Every time we go out to play, they clean up cleanly.

All in all, this time is really great!
