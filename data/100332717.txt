msg:The hotel is located in proximity to the Napa lake, and with easy access. The staff was very welcoming, and made the experience great, they are very reactive and help with any inquires. The rooms are very clean and modern, and has oxygen supply. 
The food was also great, and local food is served for breakfast and dinner or lunch. 
The hotel facilities are beautiful, with a nice garden, traditional architecture and located in a very calm and relaxing area. 
We even received a little lunch bag for our travels with tea, water, and cookies. 
Pick up and drop off worked great, and was convenient for our travels. 

I would like to stay again, when I come back to ShangriLa. Thank you for your warm welcome and the wonderful stay.

The manager and service staff are very enthusiastic. Whether it is airport pick-up, dinner pairing, or other services, they are all attentive, especially for this birthday, they helped to decorate the room. The most rare thing about this hotel is the cultural experience. The sister who puts on ******* makeup is *******. After putting on makeup, she goes to the Panahai horse farm across the road. The photographer Xiaojin follows the whole process with first-class skills. You must make an appointment to shoot when you stay in the hotel! In the museum (the private mansion of the local richest man is converted), you can see many top private collections, and the ******* cultural wood carvings in the entire lobby are breathtaking. Of course, there are many service details that need to be improved, and the overall experience is very good.

msg:It's really great, I don't know how to describe it. All aspects of the hotel are perfect. The price of more than 900 yuan is very cost-effective, comparable to charity.
1. When checking in, the receptionist drank roselle tea. I casually said that it was very delicious. The front desk sister made a thermos and sent it to the room. I drank it until I went to bed and it didn't get cold. The kitchen also sent a cup of barley wine to try during dinner.
2. Before experiencing the fire pit party, I went to make the ******* clothing provided by the hotel for free. It was made by a ******* aunt. She said she had just come down from the mountain to chop wood. I saw a ******* working woman with a clever mind and a delicate heart. I admire her. At the party in the evening, I saw this aunt sewing clothes for other housekeepers. At this moment, this hotel really gave me a very living and original ******* immersion.
3. I had high altitude sickness and gastrointestinal hypoxia. I stayed in bed for a day. I asked the housekeeper to deliver breakfast and afternoon tea to the room. It was very fast and timely. I brought a large and heavy plate. Basically, everything else was responsive and I never perfunctorily handled it.
4. After I checked out, the housekeeper took the initiative to contact me on WeChat and said that I forgot something, and then packed all my luggage and sent it to my home. I forgot things several times in the hotel, but this was the first hotel that took the initiative to contact me without asking.
5. The museum reception room in the hotel is too grand, the objects are exquisitely crafted, all are works of art, and the decoration cost is jaw-dropping. I learned that the original intention of the boss to build this manor was to promote and spread ******* culture to outsiders. I heard from the taxi driver that the boss is the richest man in the village, known as "Xiao Liu", it seems to be "Gong*Xiao Liu", I can't remember it clearly, it's an anecdote, and it's even more mysterious.
In Shangri-La, I basically didn't go to any tourist attractions. I spent a few days relaxing in the manor on vacation, which was very healing.

When I visited the hotel at night, I felt that the owner was very generous and attentive. Because it was off-season, I upgraded the room type for free, and the balcony directly overlooked Napahai, and the view was very good. Second, in terms of service, the housekeeper was very considerate and professional. He picked us up in the ancient city for free. The child kept coughing in the early morning, so he sent us to the hospital early in the morning. Third, in terms of activities, the ******* clothing experience was very real, with decorations, and the quality of the ******* clothing was also good and clean. The horse riding that the hotel cooperated with rode directly to the beach, and I could take good photos by myself. Fourth, in terms of catering, the stir-fry was good, but the noodles for breakfast tasted average, not up to the level of Yunnan rice noodles. It would be perfect if this was strengthened.

For dinner, we had a yak hotpot and a small green pepper hotpot. Both were delicious and the portions were generous. However, I recommend the small green peppers because it is a specialty of Shujia. The green soup base is a bit numb.
Overall, as a leisure travel party, I had a great time staying here these few days, but this hotel is indeed a bit far away from the ancient city, and is surrounded by local villages, which is more suitable for non-special forces travel, and I think it is different from commercial hotels. Compared to a hotel, it is actually more of a B&B in nature, but of course the facilities are great.

I made a reservation for the shuttle bus, but I was half an hour late; I made a reservation for the Napa Sea horseback riding provided by the hotel, and I waited for nearly 2 hours, and the groom only led me to the location perfunctorily.

其次，酒店處於納帕海門户位置，露台可以眺望美景，鬧中取靜，原始村落處處充滿當地藏民的生活氣息。
可以稱為納帕海最強民宿！

msg:這次住宿體驗最好的感受就是管家江才小哥哥的貼心服務。當然其他的小姐姐包括廚師小哥都很好。
設施：這個酒店開業不久，所以設備和裝修都比較新。房間衹有10間吧。一進莊園就感受到了一股濃濃的藏式風情
位置：離香格里拉古城還是有一點距離，周邊沒有商業。但是很安靜，離納帕海很近，晚飯後散步就可以走到。可惜，我們今年沒有看到“海”，據説是清理了連接地下水的洞，水都流到地下去了。
服務：非常適合一家老小的慢節奏旅遊。然後整個服務的團隊都非常有耐心，漢語説得很好，非常有禮貌。為什麼説適合“慢”節奏呢？我們去納帕海拍照，其他的家人帶着孩子先騎馬走了。我和先生想着走路回去，就多留了一下，一直在凹造型拍照。等我們準備回去的時候，突然發現一個莊園的小姐姐（名字是三個字的，不好意思忘記了）默默的站在不遠去，看到我們準備回去了。馬上過來幫我們拿東西，説怕我們迷路，一直在等我們拍完，帶我們回去。我們都不知道她在邊上等我們，沒有一絲不耐煩，後來回去還帶我們走了一條開滿油菜花的路。
      因為這邊天黑晚，我們有時候遊玩回到莊園比較晚，開始沒有意識到時間很晚了。但是多晚回去，我們説要吃飯，廚房裡都會給我們提供食物。辛苦廚房的小哥了。
     有一天晚上，我到一樓想去其他家人房間去拿東西，我走到樓梯，一個小姐姐（小圓臉姐姐）跑出來馬上把樓梯的燈全部打開，説是怕我看不見，然後問我需要什麼服務。其實我覺得我是看得見的。難為她看到客人出房間馬上出來服務。
     這次住宿體驗最好的感受就是管家江才小哥哥的貼心服務。當然其他的小姐姐包括廚師小哥都很好。 我們出去玩全程都是江才小哥哥陪同，看到太陽大會貼心的帶上兩把大大的傘，會提前給我們準備好水。解答問題也是不厭其煩，遇到問題也是積極響應。
最後還是要説説不足：可能是新酒店，感覺人手比較少，就是幾個人在忙前忙後。會出現等的情況。不過我們因為本來行程不多，所以感覺還好。但是如果後期房間數量加上來了。對服務質量是一個考驗。

大家一起圍在火塘邊做酥油茶，去草原上拍藏裝，和成羣的牛羊打招呼，去山頂上拍納帕海，去高山植物園看花海，美美的。完美的解決一個人旅行的問題，離開他們還有點捨不得。
吃得也很不錯，喜歡氂牛肉火鍋和氂牛奶酪，真的超級無敵好吃，還有二樓的博物館真的把我震撼到了，感覺很多古老又珍貴的藏族手工藝品！離市區也不遠，十來分鐘就到，總體是一家很不錯的藏式酒店，下次有機會還想再回來。
