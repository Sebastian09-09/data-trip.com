msg:The hotel is located in proximity to the Napa lake, and with easy access. The staff was very welcoming, and made the experience great, they are very reactive and help with any inquires. The rooms are very clean and modern, and has oxygen supply. 
The food was also great, and local food is served for breakfast and dinner or lunch. 
The hotel facilities are beautiful, with a nice garden, traditional architecture and located in a very calm and relaxing area. 
We even received a little lunch bag for our travels with tea, water, and cookies. 
Pick up and drop off worked great, and was convenient for our travels. 

I would like to stay again, when I come back to ShangriLa. Thank you for your warm welcome and the wonderful stay.

msg:It's really great, I don't know how to describe it. All aspects of the hotel are perfect. The price of more than 900 yuan is very cost-effective, comparable to charity.
1. When checking in, the receptionist drank roselle tea. I casually said that it was very delicious. The front desk sister made a thermos and sent it to the room. I drank it until I went to bed and it didn't get cold. The kitchen also sent a cup of barley wine to try during dinner.
2. Before experiencing the fire pit party, I went to make the ******* clothing provided by the hotel for free. It was made by a ******* aunt. She said she had just come down from the mountain to chop wood. I saw a ******* working woman with a clever mind and a delicate heart. I admire her. At the party in the evening, I saw this aunt sewing clothes for other housekeepers. At this moment, this hotel really gave me a very living and original ******* immersion.
3. I had high altitude sickness and gastrointestinal hypoxia. I stayed in bed for a day. I asked the housekeeper to deliver breakfast and afternoon tea to the room. It was very fast and timely. I brought a large and heavy plate. Basically, everything else was responsive and I never perfunctorily handled it.
4. After I checked out, the housekeeper took the initiative to contact me on WeChat and said that I forgot something, and then packed all my luggage and sent it to my home. I forgot things several times in the hotel, but this was the first hotel that took the initiative to contact me without asking.
5. The museum reception room in the hotel is too grand, the objects are exquisitely crafted, all are works of art, and the decoration cost is jaw-dropping. I learned that the original intention of the boss to build this manor was to promote and spread ******* culture to outsiders. I heard from the taxi driver that the boss is the richest man in the village, known as "Xiao Liu", it seems to be "Gong*Xiao Liu", I can't remember it clearly, it's an anecdote, and it's even more mysterious.
In Shangri-La, I basically didn't go to any tourist attractions. I spent a few days relaxing in the manor on vacation, which was very healing.

When I visited the hotel at night, I felt that the owner was very generous and attentive. Because it was off-season, I upgraded the room type for free, and the balcony directly overlooked Napahai, and the view was very good. Second, in terms of service, the housekeeper was very considerate and professional. He picked us up in the ancient city for free. The child kept coughing in the early morning, so he sent us to the hospital early in the morning. Third, in terms of activities, the ******* clothing experience was very real, with decorations, and the quality of the ******* clothing was also good and clean. The horse riding that the hotel cooperated with rode directly to the beach, and I could take good photos by myself. Fourth, in terms of catering, the stir-fry was good, but the noodles for breakfast tasted average, not up to the level of Yunnan rice noodles. It would be perfect if this was strengthened.

After wearing it, he contacted the horseman to come to the hotel to pick him up and go horse riding in Napa Sea. He took many beautiful photos and the children had a great time.

After playing, afternoon tea can be delivered to the room. Dinner is yak hot pot. There is a lot of meat in the hot pot, and it is impossible for two people to finish it. It is recommended to use thin slices of meat instead.

After dinner, the butler arranged explanations, butter tea, and tsampa-making activities. The children had a great time. Xiao Dolma, Ram, and other butlers were very polite and took good care of the needs of the children and guests.

The hotel uses diffuse oxygen, which is very comfortable and I slept well.
There is also a small bottle of laundry detergent in the bathroom, which is very considerate.

msg:Let me talk about the hotel first. It is a very *******-style manor. In addition to a main building, there are several separate villas. They are very beautiful and quiet. The internal facilities of the rooms are also great, and there is an oxygen concentrator. The happiest thing is The hotel has also upgraded to a sea view room. When you open the curtains every day, you can see the scenery of the Napa Sea at different times. It is really beautiful. The most rare thing is to visit the ******* Culture Museum in the hotel. The collection inside is really amazing. I have never seen the large pillar with two people hugging each other anywhere except in the Forbidden City.
The hotel staff are really warm and nice. We arrived late and left early. The butler Jiang Cai was still very enthusiastic to pick us up and drop us off. Ram was also super enthusiastic and helped us apply a beautiful ******* makeup. All the staff looked at it. He greets guests with a smile and answers any questions they may have.
For dinner, we had a yak hotpot and a small green pepper hotpot. Both were delicious and the portions were generous. However, I recommend the small green peppers because it is a specialty of Shujia. The green soup base is a bit numb.
Overall, as a leisure travel party, I had a great time staying here these few days, but this hotel is indeed a bit far away from the ancient city, and is surrounded by local villages, which is more suitable for non-special forces travel, and I think it is different from commercial hotels. Compared to a hotel, it is actually more of a B&B in nature, but of course the facilities are great.

Maintaining the consistent service level of Villa, the housekeeper Xiao Zhuoma and the ladies at the front desk are very warm and thoughtful, responsive to all requests, highly recommended.

msg:The environment and hardware are great! Youshujia has a consistent style and a strong cultural a**osphere; unfortunately, the service has a lot of room for improvement. I made a reservation for the shuttle bus, but I was half an hour late; I made a reservation for the Napa Sea horseback riding provided by the hotel, and I waited for nearly 2 hours, and the groom only led me to the location perfunctorily. When I reflected on the insufficiency of the riding time and the hotel's explanation, the groom replied: Village All like this. . .

msg:The ******* friends are super enthusiastic and are a very simple people. I stayed here for a day and felt that time passed super fast because the itinerary was well arranged by the butler. I didn‚Äôt worry about time at all. I was really considerate. Bar. In addition, the decoration style of the hotel is ******* style, which is very unique, feels, super grand and classy, ‚Äã‚Äãhahaha.
You don‚Äôt have to worry about being too far from the city when eating, because the hotel has very delicious hot pot and stir-fry dishes. A good scenery, a good environment, delicious dishes, and good service are really perfect.
Ps: The grassland in Napa Sea is really super beautiful recently. Herds of cattle and sheep are running on the grassland, and the tulips of alpine plants are also blooming. It is very beautiful. This trip is so worth it.
