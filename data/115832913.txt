msg:The garden is beautiful, and it is pleasant to walk. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, you can sleep and wake up in the birdsong and flowers. The room is spacious, clean, and the facilities are suitable for the elderly. The washing machine, light wave oven, refrigerator, and capsule coffee machine add greater comfort to the room, and it is convenient like home. The breakfast is complete in style, light and nutritious. We did not experience the lunch and buffet dinner offered by the hotel this time. The entertainment facilities are worth lingering on. Table tennis, billiards, yoga, equipment, and swimming are free to use. KTV, golf, and chess and cards are paid for use but cost-effective. There are also cinemas, libraries, and calligraphy and painting rooms. The combination of dynamic and static fitness and entertainment arrangements can be eaten, drunk, and played all day without being monotonous. Outside the hotel park is a high-end real estate with a park and lawns that are well-maintained like a golf course. The hotel provides bicycle rentals. Chongming is clean and quiet, full of negative oxygen ions. We rode for more than 20 kilometers without feeling tired. We rode all the way to Dingba, the Internet celebrity check-in site, walked into the plank road, overlooked the river and the sea, and watched the sunset. Chongming and Chongming's Xinlan Tiandi Yunju Hotel are worth going to and recommended.

msg:The hotel is newly opened. The layout is reasonable and the decoration is simple and elegant. Everything is new, including refrigerator, washing machine, microwave oven, etc. It is 120 square meters, clean and spacious, and feels like home. It's just that the surrounding "attractions" are not satisfactory, and the supporting commercial facilities need to be improved. Otherwise, I would really stay a few more days.

msg:Super good reviews! ! The room is great! There is a kitchen, washing machine, living room, bedroom and balcony. I felt at home. The hotel environment is also very good. A small aromatherapy was given when I checked out. I will definitely choose this hotel again next time I come to Chongming! ! !

msg:Facilities: The newly opened facilities are very new. We played billiards and table tennis in the afternoon, and there were movies in the evening, all free.
Hygiene: The whole hotel is very clean and the hygiene management is in place.
Environment: The environment is good, it is just newly opened, and there is nothing around.
Chongming organic lamb hot pot set meal: It was given by the hotel. It is completely fine for three people to eat, but there are not enough people, so the dishes are a bit less, and the hot pot cannot be added. There are only a few dishes in the set meal. I hope there will be improvements in the future.

msg:The hotel is generally very satisfactory, especially the check-in activity is quite interesting and fun, it is a good choice to bring children to play. The hotel service is also good, thank you very much to the receptionist Miss Xie at the front desk, the service is very enthusiastic and proactive, making the guests feel at home. The hotel has complete facilities, and there are refrigerators, microwaves, and washing machines in the rooms, which is very suitable for taking the elderly and children to vacation and relax. Although the hotel's breakfast is not much, some Cantonese dim sum are still very good, which are rarely seen in other hotels. In addition, the hotel will launch activities for different festivals, such as fireworks to welcome the God of Wealth and roses on Valentine's Day, which are quite appropriate. If there is a chance, I should bring my family to stay for a few days.

msg:The room was OK, but the food was not good. The chef was too heavy-handed. One portion of lamb seemed to be taken out of the brine directly, or was it re-cooked n times?
I came during off-peak hours, so there were not many people. When I asked to order food to the room, I was told that there were many people during the holiday, and the service was just average. It was just superficial.

msg:酒店有很多康養設施和活動，一開始也是看到這方面宣傳才和家人（包括兩位長者一個孩子）選了這家酒店，但是入住後才知道康養客人和酒店客人這兩種預訂渠道的待遇不一樣，通過攜程預訂的酒店住客無法享受免費騎行、周邊遊、手工作坊等等活動，這點讓人覺得非常的失望和匪夷所思！想預訂的一定要提前搞清楚！
撇開這一點，酒店工作人員態度還是不錯的。家庭房衹包含兩人早餐，多加的話要88一位，偏貴但是早餐有很多粵式茶點，也算值這個價。
