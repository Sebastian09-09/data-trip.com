msg:While the pictures on Trip.com portray a stunningly beautiful hotel this was one of the worst hotels we have stayed at in over three years in China. This is definitely not an International hotel and Trip.com needs to review this hotels 5 star service. Language was a huge issue and we had our room phone ringing at 11.30pm at night and then knocking on our room door at 12.30am in the morning as not one person could speak English to let us know what they wanted. The food is not even remotely what is pictured on Trip.com. The Boutique room….disgusting with a view of a blue roof….Such a disappointment.

msg:How should I put it, after staying in so many five-diamond and five-star hotels, I never give negative reviews. I really have to give a bad review for this stay.
1. I don’t know about other rooms. This room was surprisingly stuffy. The air conditioner couldn’t be turned on. The room was stuffy and hot. I didn’t sleep all night and I was sweating without a quilt.
2. When I opened the balcony door to get some air, I found that the outside was a closed ecological hotel dining area. When I opened the door, there were people drinking and eating outside and it was very noisy. It was very hot and stuffy if I didn't open the door, and there was no screen door.
3. There are some white and transparent things floating on the water in the bathroom bathtub.
4. The takeout I ordered was not allowed to be delivered by the staff no matter what, and the staff also refused to deliver it, and had to put it at the door of the card door. The card door is not locked and anyone can get in and out. I don't understand the point of not allowing it to be sent up.
5. There are very few breakfast varieties. There are only about 10 varieties in total, but when I saw the price of about 40 yuan, I accepted it.
6. Can’t you put hotel toiletries in the guest room? When checking in, the front desk provided dental kits, but there was nothing else in the room, including cotton pads, beard sets, shower caps, etc.
I really can't complain.

The steamer didn't have a lid yet, so the waiter noticed it and didn't care. The wontons sold in the open stall were medium in size. I asked for three more for one bowl. If the second person had to cook three more, it wouldn't be smooth. In the end, he gave me less. Got one.

msg:Most of the hotels in Beijing cost less than 600 yuan, so you can’t even think of staying in a very satisfactory hotel. Isn’t this five diamonds too cool? It's just a shabby hot spring hotel with nothing to do with hot springs. On the booking page, it looks like many rooms are fully booked, but in fact there are not many people in the hotel at all. The room has a five-star decoration plus a Samsung software. There were lumps of hair on the carpet, the towels were of poor quality, the floor drain in the room had a serious odor, the air was very turbid, and there was an atrium outside the garden room window, not the outdoors. Forget it all, I thought that the buffet breakfast redeemed with membership rights the next day would be okay, but I was really dumbfounded. First of all, the buffet restaurant is closed. The food is served by the waiter, and the items are very few and ordinary, not like the level of 88 yuan per person, just a fried dough stick, a bowl of wontons, a bowl of porridge, a fried egg, and a glass of milk. . Because the schedule was very busy the next day, I didn’t pursue this matter first. No refunds will be given after complaints are made. No matter what problem is reported, the solution is to give discounts next time. If it is not handled well this time, how can there be a next time? The quibble is that it is a complimentary value-added service, so what’s wrong with the gift? Isn’t the gift part of my contract? The membership benefits I clearly wrote down when I made the reservation include two complimentary buffet breakfasts. Is this what it is? Without this, would it be so easy to attract customers? The food appearance is really not ideal

Service: Don't eat breakfast if you can. Arrived at the restaurant at 8:40am, all dishes were empty and not restocked. After asking for restocking, they only added fried rice, fried noodles, and salted duck eggs. Milk, soy milk, porridge, pickles, vegetables, and bread were all empty. They were not restocked until 9:20am. They were told that the restaurant was closed and would not be restocked. The service attitude was extremely poor. The two people at the front desk were less than two meters away from the dining table and could find that there was no food to eat, but there was no emergency measure at all. Since there was no food to eat, the cooking area was very chaotic. There was no order. If you want to get the food you ordered first, you have to wait. Otherwise, whoever arrives will get it. The hygiene is also very worrying. The hands wearing gloves touch everything, and the gloves are useless.
For a price of more than 500 yuan, I suggest you choose other hotels

I changed rooms on the night of the 29th.
The toilet still smelled, and I could hear people talking clearly from the bedside in the next room after 11 o'clock. The wall socket is installed in the middle of the bed, and when your hair reaches in, it feels like you're getting an electric shock.

I couldn't get through to the front desk or the guest room. I had to use my own mobile phone to call the front desk. 2. Before the private bath was drained, there were still rose petals in the pool that had not been cleaned? How could there be rose petals when the front desk said it was cleaned and disinfected daily? 3. The hair dryer was broken. I had to bear it! 4. The most unacceptable thing for me was that the tea bag was expired! ! ! What kind of ** hotel is this? The tea bag has not been changed for a long time, and it can still expire! 5. The hotel that cost 1300 yuan to stay in actually had no parking space... I had to compete with others for parking. 6. The faucet in the bathroom was either too hot or too cold, and it was impossible to adjust it properly. 7. Are the pillows and mattresses worth the price of 1300 yuan? I didn't sleep well all night.
Summary: For a price of more than 1300 yuan, I might as well go to the cheapest five-star hotel. It's a complete rip-off to spend this price, and I don't know where the evaluation comes from.

2. When changing clothes, a waiter stood beside me. I don’t know if he has some kind of habit, but he kept talking.
3. Wear swimsuits when we go to the hot springs. We have to change clothes when we go upstairs. No one informed us in advance. We all went up. A security guard called us from across the floor. It was shocking.
4. The front desk keeps emphasizing that they get off work at 2 o'clock
5. Massagers always insist that they get off work at 2 o'clock
6. All hot springs have the same water.
There were too many places that made me feel bad, so I checked out that night. I am an old customer and will not go back in the future.

但是帶孩子還是很合適的，有很多孩子玩的地方。spa手法一般，采耳還行。

msg:預訂之前看評論還有點忐忑，因為帶着寶寶所以不能去太遠的地方，最後還是選擇了這裏，出乎預料的好！

🍃環境：作為比較老牌的温泉酒店，房間設施什麼的感覺蠻新的，應該翻新過了，房間大而明亮。温泉區域設施完善，泡湯、桑拿、鹽浴、氧吧、spa按摩等一應俱全，水果飲料無限提供，邊泡湯邊吃水果美美噠。
🧹衞生：看評論後特別檢查了床上用品及洗手間，床單枕套這些都很新，浴室的衞生死角也打掃的很乾凈
🔔服務：服務方面我覺得很贊，服務比較主動，去的時候客房電梯正在維修，前台免費幫我升級了房型可以乘坐另一邊的電梯，並且主動幫我們提行李進房間，餐廳用餐時撤碟也很快，等等很多小細節都能感受到貼心的服務。
買的1000出頭的套餐真的很划算，1晚住宿+住宿期間無限次温泉+自助晚餐+温泉餐廳宵夜+早餐，早餐挺豐富的，自助晚餐東西不太多，沒有龍蝦什麼的，不過鵝肝，牛仔骨，阿根廷紅蝦還不錯。畢竟疫情對生意影響很大，現在的客人很少，也是可以理解的，而且價格也划算，喜歡泡湯來這裏真的還不錯
