The park environment is beautiful, the room is warm and comfortable, the staff's service attitude is very good, the breakfast is rich and has Inner Mongolia characteristics, and the cost performance is very high. It is worthy of being the state guesthouse in Hohhot. At the same time, the transportation is convenient. It is a 500-meter walk to the subway station and it is very convenient to get to the high-speed rail station, which only takes about 20 minutes. If I come to Hohhot again in the future, I will choose to stay, and Xincheng Hotel is my first choice.

msg:The location is good and it is convenient to go anywhere. The check-in guide should locate: Xinbin Building, otherwise you will be a bit confused when you enter the park. The hotel is garden-style and decorated in the 1980s, so the foundation is still there. Because it is the guest standard, it is cost-effective It's not bad, but I always feel that his service is very blunt, just there, no matter what the intention. For example, there is a buckwheat pillow in the room, but the buckwheat in the pillow is only half. There are green plants in the room, but the green plants look... It's not too beautiful. The elevator has elevator control, but you can press it without swiping the card. The carpet is stained and it doesn't look particularly comfortable. The facilities are relatively old. Overall, the stay is very quiet. At this price, I don't have to worry about it.

It is a garden hotel. Although it is close to the busy road section, the courtyard is deep and the rooms are quiet, which is very popular among conference people. I booked two sets, one with a king-size bed (including 1 breakfast) and one with a twin bed (including 2 breakfasts). In particular, the rooms in Building 8 are designed with a set of arcs, which are comfortable and beautiful, making people linger. The breakfast is rich, both hot and cold, with a reasonable combination of desserts and meats, and a combination of Chinese and Western pastries. It's a pity that I didn't take a photo!

msg:I stayed here six years ago, and it was considered a revisit to the old place. It is an old five-star hotel, known as the Inner Mongolia State Guesthouse. This time the experience was very bad, and it was full of arrogance! 
1. I didn't upload and verify my ID card when I checked in. If bad people also stayed here, I don't know if the security guard can protect ordinary guests like us; 
2. There is no USB port in the room. I asked the front desk to borrow a plug, but there was none! 
3. There was no water in the room. I asked the front desk, and they said two bottles a day, and they would charge for adding water! 
4. Breakfast: It has been six years, and the taste has not changed, even the location of the food has not changed! The meal was collected at 9:10 in the morning. There were still several tables of guests when they collected the meal. They didn't ask everyone if they wanted to add more food, and they just turned off the lights and closed the door!

msg:It's said to be a veteran 5-star hotel, but I really don't think it's qualified. I really don’t recommend staying here. Especially the service was not good, and I was even more surprised when I found out later that it was actually a Golden Key Hotel. 1. Many problems were exposed when checking in: (1) The location of the breakfast restaurant and the elevator to the room was not proactively informed. We would always ask where we had breakfast, and the girl at the reception would answer. Then we would ask how to get upstairs, and the girl would say something else in a kind tone. But this service awareness is so poor. How does the five-star golden key reflect it? (2) During the process, I asked if it was free to park my car in the parking lot behind the building. The girl at the reception said that she would get a room for you later and then enter the license plate number for you. As a result, we were about to go to the room, but then we remembered that we had not recorded the license plate number, so we went back to register the license plate number. (3) What is even more exaggerated is that this girl directly got the wrong room type. She booked a room with a price of 1,000+ and was given the cheapest room type. When I got to the room, I was confused. The price of a five-star hotel was more than 1,000 yuan, and the facilities were very old. Fortunately, I checked the room type photos on Ctrip. I felt that even the layout was different, so I suspected that I had mistaken the room type and went back to the front desk for questioning. At this time, the girl who had just completed the formalities was nowhere to be found. He probably got off work or went to rest, so the work just now was really a mess. (4) We were received by two men, one older and one younger. We said it three times that the room type was wrong. The older staff didn't understand what was going on and made me laugh. Fortunately, the younger staff did understand. But their attitude is kind and serious, but their efficiency needs to be improved. 2. There is a problem with the room cleaning service. I was going to have breakfast the next day, thinking that I would be back soon, so I didn’t clean the room yet. The lady who opened the room service happened to be at the door. I hung up the sign saying “please do not clean” and asked her if I could give her two bottles of mineral water now. She Want to check out? I said I wouldn't refund it, but I would refund it tomorrow. She said she would put it away when she was cleaning (she couldn't give it now), but she could do it now. I said no, let’s go to the restaurant to eat and be back soon. I won’t clean up now. But when we came back, two people were cleaning the house. She was really speechless. She had already made it clear that there was no need for it yet. She heard it, but she insisted on cleaning it now. The reason is simply that I feel it would be troublesome to come back later and I am too lazy to come back again. Is this how Golden Key’s services are embodied? Because I was in a hurry to go out, I didn’t say much, so I just cleaned. She even found that the half-drunk bottle of mineral water was thrown away, so she asked the staff for another bottle. Maybe she felt that she was wronged and gave her a bottle immediately without any charge. 3. I came back to take medicine at night and found that there was no cold water, so I called the guest room and asked for mineral water. No one came for 10 minutes. I called again to remind me and the answer was that it would be delivered to each room. , let’s wait. I'm still wondering why so many guests asked for mineral water this night. It took a few minutes to deliver it, and it cost 8 yuan, which was not expensive, but it felt uncomfortable to charge for two bottles of mineral water in a five-star hotel, not to mention that the photo clearly showed four bottles of mineral water. I was finally able to take medicine, but I found that the small medicine box on the table was missing. My companion asked me if I had taken it out and lost it. The problem was that I had not seen the medicine box in the morning, so I did not take it out. My companion said that he took medicine last night, and the box was on the table. We searched all the bags and couldn't find it. Most of the time, the medicine box was thrown away as garbage like the half bottle of mineral water. In fact, this is also the reason why I don't want to ask the guest room to be cleaned in the morning. Usually I will put away my own things before asking for cleaning. 4. While waiting for the water to be delivered, two multi-legged bugs were also found. 5. The breakfast time is unreasonable. Breakfast is from 7 to 9 o'clock. 9 o'clock is not the time to stop entering the restaurant, it is the time to collect food. At 9 o'clock, the staff will remove all the food. This is the earliest 5-star hotel I have ever stayed in to charge food. Even the lights were turned off at 9:15, and almost all the dishes on the table had been removed. To sum up, if it is positioned as a five-star hotel, this hotel must not be chosen, that is, it is a 3-star hotel.

Then the person at the front desk said that they couldn't find it, and they had to check with the person on duty. So the deposit I swiped is not recorded in the system? If you don't pay attention to check, whose pocket did the money go to? Is this a hotel operated by the government of Hohhot, Inner Mongolia?

房間：整體設施偏老舊，晚上睡覺的時候才發現床褥有股臭腳丫子味兒！可是大半夜的懶得折騰了！
早餐：今天是週六，早晨9點到餐廳的時候就沒什麼東西了，大部分餐盤都空了或者剩下很少的食物；種類很少，類似於快捷酒店的早餐！！！
整體感覺非常糟糕！是我見過的最糟糕的服務態度！
