msg:Traveling with a six-month-old baby for the first time
Chosen to travel in Dalian by car and checked in at the newly opened Four Seasons Hotel

Advantages:
- Air conditioning in each area, bathroom/living room/bedroom can be controlled independently
- The swimming pool is great, very clean and not crowded
- The spa is good and very comfortable
- The service is very good and responsive, especially Brittany who received me! She helped me solve many problems (for example, the baby stool fell when I changed rooms, and she helped me find it quickly). Seeing that I was with my baby, she also added an air purifier to the room. Thank her
- The hardware is impeccable, and the cribs provided are all from Stokke

The only drawback:
The hygiene situation could be better, and it is not easy to see the corners, and it is not very clean
The room still feels a bit like decoration

That's all!

I would especially like to thank Ms. Carrie Wang, the Guest Experience Manager. Her home-like service made me feel very cordial after coming from afar. Whether it was the room arrangement, the care from landing, check-in to check-out, the exquisite welcome fruits, and even the introduction of how to play in Dalian, I experienced the high-quality service of Four Seasons. Four Seasons is your home during your travels.

The sea view room with the sky and water in one, watching the ships coming in and out of Dalian Port and the sunrise and sunset, and even feeling the changing scenes of spring, summer, autumn and winter in the hotel.

The hardware of the newly opened Four Seasons Hotel needs no further explanation. From check-in to check-out, the service really treats people as if they were themselves, and makes guests feel at home. Thank you CarrieWang for the arrangement and care. It feels great to be valued.

The hotel's facilities inherit the Four Seasons' consistent low-key luxury and modern style! The three restaurants are all online, and the most worth mentioning is that their dessert shop cakes and chocolate croissants are worth repurchasing! I was impressed by Samantha's thoughtful service before checking in. Not only did she upgrade the room, but she also arranged early check-in! Four Seasons will always be a brand I will choose again and again!

Secondly, the facilities of Four Seasons Hotel are also good, but the lobby design is too ordinary, which does not match the title of the top hotel in the three northeastern provinces. Finally, the grassroots service staff is really too bad. The training is not in place, but all the needs are evaded with a sentence of "I just arrived, I don't know much". Dalian Four Seasons still needs to work hard.

When checking in, a customer experience manager, Carrie Wang, received me throughout the whole process and sent me to the room. She also sent a message to greet me after I left the hotel. It seems that the hotel is attentive to customer relations in the early days of its opening. The hardware is quasi-five-star equipment, nothing special. Breakfast is also five-star standard, and the saury and sea urchin porridge can be regarded as a bit of Dalian characteristics. Coffee needs to be ordered, and there are waiters to help make it. In terms of service, except for the concierge who had a blank expression and did not come forward when I just got off the car, all other positions were online, especially the bartander with long hair in the bar. I didn't have the opportunity to dine in the hotel this time, but I will arrange it next time. The check-in and check-out processes were very fast, and overall it can be almost full marks.

msg:When I came back from Guangzhou, I found that Dalian Four Seasons was open, so I immediately booked a room to experience it.

Let’s talk about the advantages first: Check in at Silky Hotel, contact the specialist and you can check in in advance. All my requests were met as much as possible, air purifiers were also prepared, and fruit desserts were also great. Thanks to Carrie, the service is warm but not unreasonable. Occasionally, the room service staff has a slightly clumsy sincerity, which I like.

The biggest surprise for me is the food and beverage. I love it so much. I ranked the hotel restaurant first in Dalian. I ate in the Chinese restaurant and the breakfast buffet. I didn’t have time to try the Japanese food (but Dalian’s Japanese food is very strong, so I don’t have high expectations). , so far everything tastes very good, everything about breakfast is delicious, the drink is the popular vegetable and fruit juice for weight loss, the salmon is a whole smoked and freshly cut, the smoked taste is just right, fresh and not fishy, ​​the eggs Benedict is a hidden menu, ask for it I ordered two portions and ate them all, which made me look forward to the dinner buffet a lot more. Unfortunately, I couldn’t stay one more day [poor] and I still had to go to school on Monday.

I hope Four Seasons Catering can maintain its current standards, so I applied for a card just for food.

There are also shortcomings, and there are even some things that should not happen at the Four Seasons Hotel.

Let’s talk about the shortcomings: the service staff’s Mandarin is worrisome, the front desk all speaks Hong Kong and ********* accents, it took an hour for water to be delivered to me at 9pm, and there was even a situation where no one answered the call for room service. The tone of the first two calls was normal, but the third time he heard that I was going to get angry, he sent it to me instantly. . . However, the elder sister who came apologized to me and said that it took time to get the coffee machine for the guests. I immediately relented and said it was okay. Then the corners of the room were not cleaned properly. There was floating dust on the bar glass and water stains on the corners of the mirror (it was very hidden but I I saw it), the plate has a chip (I found the egg benique plate when I was sorting out the pictures)

There is also this elevator. Every time I go in and out of this elevator, I feel like I am standing on the rooftop. The wind is blowing hard, and it even blew my hair up once. Fortunately, I am used to being unkempt, so I can dress up for the Internet celebrities who take pictures. Worry. The movement of the elevator is also very complicated. For example, I dropped off my friends on the next floor and then went upstairs. As a result, the people in the elevator followed me back to the 41st floor. They were originally going downstairs. Several people in the elevator complained to each other about why they were sitting there again. When I went back, I just couldn't complain about the elevator route.

I wanted to have a drink with my friends and went to the bar, but was told that I needed to make a reservation in advance. I think this is not friendly to hotel guests. Many people like me who want to have a drink on the spur of the moment can reserve some seats for hotel guests.

The restaurant miscalculated the money for me during the meal. I don't think it was intentional, but I just forgot because of the crowd. After I found out, the restaurant manager helped me solve the problem in time and compensated me. It's just a small episode.

I give Four Seasons an overall score of 80 points. Some shortcomings do not affect my liking for it. The main reason is that the food is to my liking. I hope Dalian Four Seasons can continue to improve and become the light of this city.







These shortcomings have been resolved for the time being. Now that I have applied for the card, I will come more often in the future and pick up the shortcomings slowly. . .

I feel that the elevator needs to be improved. There are so many elevators that I can't notice which elevator arrives every time. It often happens that the elevator door cannot be closed after entering, because the guests outside who press the button don't see which elevator arrives and keep pressing it.

msg:The first Four Seasons Hotel in Northeast China. I had the opportunity to experience it in Dalian. This experience was an unprecedented high-quality experience for all the 5-star hotels I have stayed in before.
The hotel called one day in advance to ask what the room requirements were. After informing that there were children, they also asked about the children's age in detail, and prepared slippers more suitable for children in advance when checking in.
After arriving at the hotel and getting off the car, the concierge helped with the luggage, and the luggage only needed to be placed on the first floor. The guests only needed to check in empty-handed at the front desk floor. The housekeeper who called in advance was waiting at the front desk and checked in.
After the room card was processed, the housekeeper led us to the room and introduced the room. And the room was prepared with welcome fruits and macarons for the children. There was also a warm handwritten welcome card.
The room was clean and tidy, with good sound insulation, and the switch settings in the room were very reasonable. There were many types of breakfast.
When checking out, the concierge was waiting at the front desk. Helped take the luggage to the lobby on the first floor. While helping to drag the luggage, he was still asking us about our stay experience and gave a more detailed introduction to the hotel. It really can achieve that all staff have a very high sense of service.
After helping us put our luggage in the car, they watched us leave the hotel.
From check-in to check-out, my family and I had a very high experience! Next time I go to Dalian, I will choose to stay here!

The spare parts are OK, a full set of Fuma; the bathroom is Kohler, and the water pressure and temperature are OK; the hardware is generally OK, but a few decoration details are a bit lacking. It is worth mentioning that the bed and bathrobe are really comfortable. If it weren't for the fact that the suitcase couldn't fit in the bathrobe, I would have bought two sets to take away.
Personally, I feel that there is no need for a sea view room. The city view is better than the sea view. It's quite comfortable to go to the bar for a drink in the evening. The swimming pool and gym are well equipped, and you just need to put on some sports clothes.

Over the years, Four Seasons hotels in Hong Kong, Macau, Shanghai, Beijing, and Bali have left their footprints. Before I had time to experience the Four Seasons in Tokyo and Kyoto, I came to Dalian first. From the moment you arrive at the lobby on the first floor, every staff member you come into contact with is warm-hearted. After checking in, the staff went directly to the door of the room, opened the door and handed over the room card with both hands, enthusiastic yet professional. I personally have express delivery to send. The girl in charge of the hotel came to the room several times to communicate. She was cheerful and patient. Thank you very much. I also like the style of the room, especially the design of the bathroom. The water quality must have been softened, and my skin feels silky smooth after taking a bath. I personally pay great attention to the bedding. The bed in the room is moderately soft and hard, and the bedding is super comfortable. Because it is a newly opened hotel, lying on the comfortable and clean-smelling pillows will heal your body and mind after a tiring day. We hope to maintain a high level of service and maintenance of all aspects of hardware and software in the future. Always keep these little details that make your guests feel good.

Thanks to Carrie, the hotel's guest experience manager, for contacting us in advance and upgrading the room, setting up a sofa bed, and preparing children's supplies. The welcome fruit cherries were very sweet, and some were sent to the room the next day. The children loved it.
The executive lounge is not big, and I am used to eating Western breakfast. The egg rolls and freshly squeezed orange juice taste great. It would be even better if there are a la carte waffles and English waffles. If you get tired of desserts during afternoon tea, you can have some grilled squid as a snack. I hope I can check out more restaurants in the hotel next time I have the opportunity.
The executive suite has two bathrooms, a smart toilet, and a sofa bed that can be opened to face the sea. It is very friendly to families with two children.
I also went to experience the hotel swimming pool. The water temperature in the children's pool was 30 degrees and the water temperature in the large swimming pool was 28 degrees. I would like to thank the two staff at the swimming pool for patiently explaining the use of the password locker and helping me carry my child into the swimming pool. They were considerate and enthusiastic.
After all, it is a newly opened hotel, and there will be some immature areas. For example, there is no staff at the concierge at the door to help open the door and pick up luggage, and there is no in-room dining menu in the room. But overall, the flaws of Four Seasons outweigh the advantages. Next time I come to Dalian, I will choose Four Seasons again.

msg:Facilities: The Four Seasons Hotel just opened last Friday and everything is great. There is a panoramic swimming pool, and there are two small pools with different temperatures for children to play in. I like it very much. I stayed here for two days and it is my children's favorite place to go.
The hotel has Chinese food, Cantonese food, Japanese food, and a lounge, which can meet all needs.

Environment: The hotel is full of the warmth of the four seasons. The lobby is on the 41st floor with perfect sea views, which relieves the stress of the week.

Hygiene: The new hotel is overall good. The bathtub, bath towels and bathrobes are very good, especially the children's bathrobes. The fluffy ones are very warm and comfortable. They can be worn directly to the swimming pool, which is very convenient.

Service: I would like to express my special thanks to Carrie. She communicated her preferences and needs before check-in, upgraded the check-in, and also prepared a bed for the children on the sofa bed in advance, and prepared fruits and snacks in the room. The children were very happy. Throughout the whole weekend of our stay, they kept communicating with us about any needs we had and helped with them. Thank you very much🥹
Dinner and breakfast services are also online, highly recommended
There is a slight problem with the room service. No one answered every time I called. It took a long time to send buckwheat pillows and bath towels twice. I hope it can be improved.

設施設備給差評是早上8點洗澡的時候，水温開到最大也就是温的。希望酒店方多檢查。

首先未入住之前便接到了酒店管家的致電問候，並對於入住需求瞭解之後即刻落實。次日入住，熱情的態度高樓層的安排均令人喜悅。驚喜的是大連四季酒店的硬件設施細節令人歎為觀止，溫暖的黑胡桃木色系將人包裹的恰到好處，房間內無論是飲用水、洗浴用品，尤其是那木質牙刷都讓住顆溫暖到心裏。

再次，特別要提出表揚的是前臺的Carrie無論何時需要她的幫助，永遠第一時間出現，還有優秀的客房服務人員及時慷慨的補給，都令這次四季行暖到心裏。

當然，這些還不僅僅能說明大連四季的卓越，民以食為天，在此必須強烈安利酒店全日餐廳的自助早餐，這絕對是我去過所有金鑽酒店的天花板。廚師每一張有溫度的披薩，新鮮出爐的油條，冒著熱氣濃稠的白粥。各種高品質水果，以及任選果蔬類別的果蔬汁，天！

雖然已經離開酒店有些日子，但在寫這些文字的時候又讓我有了再去入住的衝動！

此次，大連，不為大連，只爲大連四季！
