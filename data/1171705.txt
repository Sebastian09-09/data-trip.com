When booking we were hesitant about the breakfast and thought we'd probably prefer to eat elsewhere. After trying it out the first day however, we decided is totally worth it and booked it for the rest of our stay.
Overall, everything in and about the hotel was of good quality and comfort.
I can wholeheartedly recommend it.

Breakfast was also very nice with a good mix of Chinese and Western food including delicious bakery. They have a nice and well equipped gym with treadmills, bikes and an area for weight workout. The only point for improvement is the cleanliness in the bathroom as we detected some black mold on sealings in the shower cabin as well as the sink. Not too much though so that we refrained from complaining.

We booked a room with view of the Forbidden City which was nice but sadly enough it was not lighted during the evenings so you can‚Äôt see much of it after sunset. The location is great to wander around this part of town, walking distance to the Forbidden City and the National Art Museum. We had access to the Club Lounge which provided us with nice food and drinks almost anytime we stepped in. We enjoyed the indoor pool and the small warm water pool with bubbles. Would be our preferred hotel the next time we visit Beijing and highly recommend this gorgeous hotel!

The location is great, close to the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, and Wangfujing, and you can walk there. There are many Chinese style elements in the hotel lobby, and the front desk is filled with books on the wall, which is very artistic, integrating culture and art into the hotel. In the morning and evening, the hotel's executive lounge restaurant overlooks the blue tiles and red walls of the Forbidden City and Jingshan Park outside the window, and you can enjoy delicious food and feel happy.
When we encountered a small problem when we checked in, the executive room manager Peter immediately helped us solve it. He was very dedicated and could handle the problem in time, and put himself in the shoes of the guests. There was also a waiter in the main room, Chang Hao, who was enthusiastic and helped me get a taxi and take my luggage on rainy days. I have recommended the hotel to friends who want to go to Beijing.

msg:The hotel has an elegant environment, spacious and comfortable rooms. I booked a premium twin room. My parents, my sister and I stayed in one room. The two 1.4 beds were of suitable size. Not crowded. High cost performance. The service was considerate. My sister received a birthday cake on her birthday! There are Old Beijing breakfast, Four Seasons Minfu Roast Duck, Ziguangyuan Muslim Restaurant, and many delicious foods nearby! Wangfujing is within easy reach. It takes only 6 minutes to get there. It is very close to Chang'an Avenue, the Forbidden City and other attractions. A must-choose hotel for Beijing tourism accommodation.

The view is the ancient charm and layers of Beijing. The location is excellent and it is very convenient to order takeout :). The room also came with a lot of food... afternoon tea, evening A drinks buffet, hot food buffet, etc. The service is considerate.

The breakfast is rich in variety and very good!

msg:A very perfect experience. The doorman enthusiastically helped with luggage when entering. Check-in was quick and there was a check-in service details. For a family of three, the room space is completely sufficient. It's hot in summer, so children can take a bath after playing, which is very comfortable. Afternoon tea on the 17th floor, the refreshments are very popular among children, and there are many kinds of fruits. In the evening, it is also very comfortable for adults to drink two glasses of juice in the lounge. Breakfast is also good, with fruits, snacks, vegetables, pasta, etc., which can fully meet daily needs. The desserts on the first floor of the lobby taste good, and my children bought them several times. The service is great, they interact with the children, and there are discounts. The children are very happy. I didn‚Äôt take many photos, just one of the small puff dessert. It's a good place to travel. Jingshan Park can be reached in 20 minutes with a stroller, and Wangfujing Commercial Street is not far away. For the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, National Museum of China and Quanjude, the distance is very close. Overall, it is great. I will choose this place again next time my children come.

The breakfast is rich, and the afternoon tea and dinner can also meet our needs. Thank you very much to the hotel's front desk manager, Iris, for her enthusiasm, thoughtfulness, generosity and courtesy, which made us feel very comfortable. We really like staying in the hotel to travel around. In the hotel's Forbidden City view room, we can see the beautiful Forbidden City, the National Grand Theater, the Great Hall of the People, Beihai, and Jingshan scenery, and take pictures of the sunset. Thanks again to the hotel's night shift manager on the 13th. Sorry for the trouble. This trip was very successful. There are many foreign friends in Wangfujing who come to travel. We are really relieved about the five-star hotel. See you next time!

It looks very transparent in the morning and gives people a sense of vicissitudes at dusk. The moment of watching the sunset in the lounge can be counted as one of the "moments" in life. In addition, the location of the hotel is also very convenient. To the south is Wangfujing, and to the north is Metro Line 8. It is also within walking distance to the Forbidden City and Beihai Park.
Service: I like the service of the lounge. Thanks to Manager Coco. Her two canine teeth are very cute when she smiles. She has always provided warm, meticulous and appropriate services, introduced special meals and afternoon tea snacks, and chatted with us, making us feel at home. I also want to thank Tina at the front desk for her warm service and smooth check-in and check-out procedures for us.

msg:Avoid the thunder! ! Avoid the thunder! ! ! Avoid the thunder! ! !
If you want to book this hotel, you will regret it if you don't read my evaluation! !
Don't believe that it is newly opened in 2014, don't believe that it is under Marriott, don't believe its 4.8 rating, and don't believe its good reviews. Personality guarantees that they are all fake! !
1. The so-called opening in 2014 means that the hotel name was changed in 2014, or it was taken over by a new team. It was originally a very old hotel!
2. I booked an executive double bed for 3 nights half a month in advance, which is equivalent to more than 2,200 per night (note: it is the off-season after May Day). After I arrived in Beijing, I looked through the hotel information again and found that the same level of executive king bed only costs about 1,500. After negotiating with Ctrip, I was given this price. 3 nights is equivalent to more than 1,500 per night. After checking in, I felt that this hotel is losing hundreds of yuan.
3. The facilities in the corridor of the hotel are all old, and a smell of smoke hits you when you get out of the elevator.
4. The house is even more outdated, with wardrobes from many years ago, dirty black carpets, and black and brown sofa chairs with peeling paint by the window. Even the remote control has a layer of mold spots, so speechless!
5. There is no fresh air system in the house, and it depends entirely on an air circulation fan. If you turn it on, it will disturb your sleep. If you don't turn it on, you will feel a smell in the room. .
6. The bed is a wooden base with a thick mattress on it, which is very high. My 6-year-old daughter had to jump up and climb onto the bed with great effort!
7. The toilet is not smart for a 5-star hotel. The bathing facilities are quite satisfactory!
8. The view, I want a room with a view of the Forbidden City. In fact, the Forbidden City is very far away, and you can only see a little corner. The houses nearby are basically very old!
9. There are mosquitoes at night, and the children can't sleep because of the bites. I have been catching mosquitoes from 4 to 6 in the morning!

In short, this hotel is under the banner of 5-star standards. With this level of facilities, it can be sold for 2200+ per night. Even though it was later changed to 1500+ per night. It's still a rip-off!!! Super rip-off!!! Those with a larger budget can look at other hotels, and those with less budget can go to an economy chain!

The hotel staff are very nice. If you need a few more bottles of water or a pair of slippers, they will be delivered quickly. This time we have three adults and one child, and there is no extra charge for breakfast.
For me, the only shortcoming may be the sound insulation. This may be a common problem in many hotels, that is, the door is not soundproof, and even the slightest movement in the corridor can be heard clearly.

As for the location, the hotel is on Wangfujing Street, but Wangfujing itself is almost ruined so there is nothing to see, and you can't go to Tiananmen Square without making a reservation in advance, so it was pointless.

Carina and Faye at the front desk are kind and friendly, and the interior and exterior facilities are suitable. The hotel has complete facilities, good sound insulation, and plenty of hot water. It takes about 3 minutes' walk from the hotel to Wangfujing Street. It is also very close to tourist attractions. We can reach the Forbidden City, the Great Hall of the People, Mao Zedong Memorial Hall and other tourist attractions within a short walk. It is a very recommended hotel. Ôøº

It is very close to the Art Museum Station of Line 8. It only takes five minutes to walk to Shichahai. , it only takes 10 minutes to ride a bicycle on Nanluogu Alley. The hotel environment is really good. Angel‚Äôs service at the front desk is great. Since we arrived early, he added a WeChat message to inform us that the room was ready, and he also upgraded our room type. Although there was a little hiccup when we checked in, we were still given a satisfactory room. Although it was a corner room, I was a little uneasy, but overall it was very good. However, the air outlet in the room was a bit noisy, so I didn't sleep all night. Stable, everything else is almost 100 points. Also gave me coffee shop drinks

Then you will pass Ziguangyuan and Four Seasons Minfu on the way, so it is very convenient to eat and go to scenic spots nearby. Conveniently, if you want to take the subway, go to Wangfujing or. The National Art Museum of China is also very convenient to take the subway, so I think the transportation location, scenery and price are very cost-effective. Highly recommended, will come again

msg:As one of the top luxury hotels in Beijing, the Renaissance Jinmao is within walking distance of Wangfujing and the Forbidden City. Needless to say, it has a superior location. The lobby is quite unique, and you can feel the collision of humanity and fashion, history and modernity. When we checked in, the front desk gave us a room on a medium floor but with the largest room type. It is a good choice for people who focus on comfort rather than views. The room type and size should be considered one of the best among hotels in the same price range in the nearby area; the window of the room faces the direction of China World Trade Center, and when the weather is good, you can feel the metropolitan a**osphere of Beijing. The overall feeling of the room is very comfortable, but the quality of some supporting consumables does not seem to match the hotel's positioning.
Because I checked into the hotel late, I chose to have dinner at Wanlixuan, a Cantonese restaurant on the second floor of the hotel. As the top Cantonese restaurant in Dongcheng District, the food tastes pretty good, but the price/performance ratio is not good. It feels a bit unreasonable that a restaurant in this price range didn't even change the plate once after eating a meal. The service quality of the staff needs to be improved. The breakfast service is located on the first floor of the hotel. Maybe because the dining time was not chosen well, the flow of people was very large and it seemed quite chaotic. The dining experience was not very good, although the variety of dishes was quite rich.
What I regret most is that as a luxury hotel, the overall service quality does not make me feel the class of this hotel. It is hard to imagine that there is no greeting staff after arriving at the hotel. Fortunately, I don‚Äôt have much luggage and it is not a problem to go to the front desk to handle it. I didn't experience much service during the entire stay. It wasn't until a little "incident" occurred during breakfast that I felt the "warm service" of the hotel staff. However, the hotel front desk communicated kindly when checking out and patiently listened to our experience. They also apologized to us for the hotel's shortcomings (and also gave us a small gift), which can be regarded as improving the hotel's service quality. become.

The perspective of the Forbidden City can only be vaguely visible. Meals, because it is a suite, include breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner. The food tastes average and the desserts are not good enough. But the baguette deserves the accolade. I have no other special impressions, but there are still many areas for sustainable improvement.

Since there are small electric chargers in the hotel lobby, they should play a responsible role. The machine is not easy to use, and it keeps being billed. I ask the service staff for help, and the attitude is very bad. They only say that it has nothing to do with us and just do it yourself. What service attitude.

Because I paid extra money to change to a twin room in the Forbidden City on the second night, I specifically reported the hygiene issues to the front desk on the first night. As a result, I was assigned a room with a door on the wall that separates the room next door. When I came back at night, I kept hearing the sound of children telling stories. , I thought it was my child listening to a story in the bathroom, but I listened carefully and found out that it was coming from the next door. Sorry for my feedback on the cleanliness on the first night, but you arranged such a room for me the next day, for two nights and two children. I spent more than 6,000 before and after breakfast, and the experience is worse than that of chain hotels. It is known as the ceiling of Beijing, so avoid it! The service in the lounge can also be called zero. It is said to include afternoon tea and happy hour (dinner). In fact, after staying for a long time, the waiter gave me a slap in the face. I spent money to experience it and it was really a slap in the face.

Take the two elders of the family to the executive lounge to enjoy afternoon tea and light dinner.
The service in the lounge is attentive, and the staff enthusiastically helped us find a seat with a view.
The afternoon tea and light meals are actually very rich. Although it is a buffet, the table is cleared quickly and every service staff is smiling.
So I carefully wrote down their names: Peter, Ivry, Anna.
In particular, the food tastes very good, and the afternoon tea scones are very delicious.
The point is: the lounge with the best view in Beijing!

I came over to help carry the suitcases, and every staff member was responsive to my needs. It made me feel like I was in the capital, and made me look forward to the rest of my trip. When I returned to the hotel every day, the room was clean and everything was ready. The mattress is moderately soft and hard. It feels like sleeping at home. It's very comfortable. It's also necessary to mention the breakfast. There are many varieties, especially the Western pastries. It's worth trying. They don't look like much but they are all delicious. Children don't like sweets. We ate a lot and thanked every staff member for their hard work. We dragged our tired bodies back to the hotel every day, just like returning home. The most impressive thing about our trip to Beijing was the Renaissance Jinmao!

The kettle was moldy, but luckily I paid attention to it before using it. After calling the front desk, they were able to send another one over.
The towels and bath towels before check-in were placed in rolls. We stayed for four nights, and they were folded and placed for the next four days, which made people wonder whether they had been cleaned, but a traveler said that there was a dryer smell on them. I continued to use it with peace of mind, thinking that the hotel had a strict set of placement and return standards. But it's not. The water glasses were not cleaned and put back in their original positions.
The front desk asked for three bottles of mineral water over the phone, but only two bottles were actually delivered.
The variety of breakfast is really not rich compared to five-star hotels in the south, and the taste needs to be improved. It may be due to different personal tastes, so it can only be used as a reference.
Due to the mildew stains on the kettle, the hotel front desk gave me a small gift and repeatedly emphasized not to leave any reviews. Only when problems arise can there be room for improvement. Don't cover up the problems but face them and solve them. I hope you can have a better stay next time.

Taking a taxi to Beijing South Railway Station takes about 40 minutes.

The hotel is quite large, but after staying for three nights, the breakfast management for the three days was in order. Guests will be guided to sit in a fixed position, so that when they temporarily leave their seats to pick up their meals, they will not be mistaken for an empty table. The breakfast is also very rich and cost-effective, and there is no extra charge for children's meals. The egg pancakes are delicious and I can‚Äôt get enough of them.

The room size is not large, but the twin room is very wide. Compared with other twin rooms in Beijing, this 1.4m bed is very comfortable. Moreover, there were actually 8 pillows. The children were so happy that they started building blocks with the pillows.

The room service responded to every request. If I asked for extra mineral water and razors, they were delivered to the room immediately. The service was very timely.

msg:The hotel's environment and location are very good. The lobby is full of festive a**osphere. The front desk arranged for the room to be upgraded to an executive room. I stayed for two consecutive nights. On the day of check-out, there was a little hiccup due to a problem with the room card. I am also very grateful to Sarah. Helping out, when faced with a problem, she quickly came up with a solution instead of ignoring it. Regarding the room card issue, she not only patiently explained it, but also effectively solved our troubles. Her professionalism and service attitude were impressive and added a lot to the entire stay experience. I will choose to stay at the Renaissance Beijing Jinmao Hotel again in the future. The hotel's environment and location are also highly recommended.

Every move is full of professionalism and affinity. We had afternoon tea in the lounge on the 17th floor. The coffee, fruits and snacks were just right. The sun shined through the windows, making it warm and comfortable. The highlight was the super delicious scones. I had already checked out and still couldn't forget the taste. I told a staff member on the first floor that I wanted to buy some to take away. The staff member named Lina patiently helped me inquire and told me that only the 17th floor had scones. At that time, there were only two upstairs. They should be reserved for lounge guests. I negotiated with hotel colleagues to pack 4 for me if I was willing to wait. A staff member named Peter personally helped me deliver them to the lobby on the first floor instead of asking me to go up and pick them up. , the considerate service provides customers with the most convenient and satisfactory service. I am very satisfied, thank you very much! I will definitely stay again if I have the opportunity in the future!

msg:Checked in on January 13th. There were a total of 6 rooms in the group, and they all chose twin rooms when booking.
Checked in to one room on the morning of the 13th and was upgraded to a 15th floor king bed.
Checked into 2 rooms in the afternoon and asked if the floor could be higher. I was told that the highest floor for twin beds is 8th floor;
If I have a lot of reservations, can I upgrade for free? Let me know;
Two of the male children were minors living in one room. Upon request from the front desk, we cooperated and asked the guardians to provide birth certificates and other information. At the same time, I asked if they could be on the same floor, and I was told that there were no extra floors to allow 2 rooms to be together? !
God knows, in the end, one room was on the 8th floor and the other on the 17th floor? ! The minors are actually on the 17th floor! I was shocked. I checked with the front desk again to see why there were so many floors separated. They actually replied, "It's the same no matter which floor you take the elevator to!" Are you serious? ! If you ask again, just say sorry, there is no room!
Is this the level of Renaissance?
The other three have been upgraded to the 15th and 16th floors, only us! ! An 8 and a 17. You clearly said before that the highest double bed is at 8, why is it 17? Moreover, all of us were required to scan our faces into the system, and the whole process took 30 minutes, while the other rooms only required one person to scan their faces!
I understand that strict inspections are a good thing, but most people don‚Äôt need them. What‚Äôs the explanation?
The shower room door in room 812 did not close tightly, the bath water was exposed, the toilet side was soaked, and the shoes were soaked!
Although the front desk I met when I checked out the next day was very polite and apologized in subsequent contact, I will not go to this hotel again, nor will I recommend it to my friends! Very poor experience! The level of the front desk is not high. In addition to the man who received me, the other desk is probably an intern. He is not skilled in handling business. He does not know how to handle the most basic checkout in advance, and he frowns to show customers! Very incomprehensible!

The supplied toothbrushes were piled on the table. The facial tissue can be completely gone without being replaced. To be honest, at a price of nearly 2,000 per night, you can choose other hotels nearby.

There are fewer dishes, but there are not many people there due to the view. The dining environment is good and it can be used on the 1st floor (which has more dishes). In the evening, the executive lounge offers light meals and a variety of drinks. It feels good to have a drink while admiring the night view of Beijing.

Facilities: The independent air conditioner can adjust the temperature to meet the indoor temperature needs of babies with eczema without making it too hot.
I also like the little lion in the elevator (see photo)
Hygiene: very clean
Environment: Close to Wangfujing and the Forbidden City. Very suitable for a stroll. The room can see the golden roof of the Forbidden City. Especially when you wake up in the morning, the feeling of the early morning sun hitting the historic roof is very shocking.
Evening energy hot food buffet: an experience you haven‚Äôt had yet, come back next time

The two gentlemen at the front desk, Leo and Nero, were also very nice due to a temporary change in the itinerary and quickly helped with the renewal process. The overall facilities of a five-star hotel are similar, but the hotel's location is very advantageous, right in the Wangfujing Business Center. Taking photos in the lounge on the 17th floor is great.

I would especially like to mention Miss Angel Gao Yangqin. I am very impressed by her service. Enthusiastic and professional help in planning what to pay attention to when visiting the Great Wall in Beijing. Warm reminders. Recommended guide for classic check-in in Beijing. Provide some convenience from the customer's perspective. Her good communication skills and genuine concern for customers are a level of service I have rarely seen in so many hotels. I give her a big thumbs up for her love for work, respect and kindness towards customers!

The breakfast was great, as was the executive lounge service. Hope to keep it in the future.

You can put a few more bottles of drinking water in the room. Don't stay on the 17th floor in the future because there is an executive lounge and it's a little noisy.

You can go to the Old Beijing Hotpot restaurant inside to eat hotpot mutton. The suite on the 16th floor has a view of the Forbidden City and Jingshan Mountain. My grandson was very happy to see it. The service in the executive lounge is particularly excellent. The girls speak excellent foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand work very hard.

2. The geographical location is excellent. Wangfujing and Tiananmen are just outside the door. Looking at the Forbidden City from a distance is also unique.
3. The software and hardware of the room are also highly recommended. Land is very expensive in Dongcheng District, Beijing. The room is of the same size and is clean and tidy. The afternoon tea pastries in the executive lounge are also very interesting, go and try them.
4. Suggestions for self-driving tours from other places: Cars from outside the second ring road are not allowed to enter. You can only park near the third ring road train station and take a taxi. The hotel does not have its own parking lot, and the fee is relatively expensive at 10 yuan/hour with no cap. Outside, there is no cap at about 6 yuan/hour. , for your reference.

Not to mention the hardware, the group's quality assurance has always been strong. When you walk into the room, the high ceiling and layout are comfortable and warm. The toiletries are also our favorite international brands. The key point is: it is not a sample of ordinary hotel configurations! The large bottle configuration allows family travel companions to solve their worries, which is very considerate! There is also plenty of drinking water provided every day, and the fruits are fresh for the occasion!
The breakfast has a wide range of varieties, with Chinese characteristics and Western pastries. During the peak meal period, several supervisors personally arrange seats, reducing the waiting time for guests, which is remarkable! The highlight of the night light service is also worthy of praiseüëç. At the same time, they also asked if there was any lunch box garbage that needed to be disposed of to keep the room tidy. This kind of proactive service reflects humanistic care!
The hotel is located a 6-minute walk from the Dongsi Exit of Metro Line 6, making it easy to get to Chaoyang Joy City and other business districts. It is only a 5-minute walk to Wangfujing Street, and within 7 minutes of the National Art Museum of China of Metro Line 8. , you can sit directly to Nanluoguxiang, Drum Tower, Shichahai and other attractions... The hotel is opposite FamilyMart, where you can easily purchase daily necessities. You can buy KFC and Mixue Bingcheng tea drinks and several snack bars in 3 minutes on the right side of the door~ Next I will choose Renaissance Jinmao again when I come to Beijing for the first time, and I will truly feel at home!
Special praise to Sarah at the front desk for receiving us very patiently and meticulously, warmly and thoughtfully!
Facilities: Hardware and software are OK
Hygiene: clean and tidy

When I first made the reservation, I felt that the hotel was too old, and I was afraid that the facilities would be old. But when I actually arrived, I found that it was well maintained, with good details and cleanliness, and the bathtub was also Washed very clean. The staff is also well trained. The only flaw is probably that the quality of the hotel's breakfast is not very stable. I don't know if it's because the chefs work in shifts.
Let's talk about the location. The location is great. There is a Four Seasons Minfu next door and it takes 30 minutes to walk to Tiananmen Square.
I will definitely stay here next time I bring my children. I hope we can continue to maintain this standard.

Then there are many parts where the ceiling is very short. As a 1.65cm tall person, I can reach out and touch the roof. The bathroom is relatively small, and the bathroom feels like a 4-star hotel, with poor quality. When booking the room, there was a landmark view marked. You can see the Forbidden City, and you can actually see the top of the Forbidden City. But I don‚Äôt want to comment too much on this landmark scene. The suite only has a very small bathroom. The bathroom does not have full blackout curtains and can penetrate into the bedroom. Parking costs 10 yuan an hour, the same price at night, with no cap.

I have lived in many Renaissance hotels before. In my mind, Renaissance is basically synonymous with simplicity and luxury. This hotel is no exception, but the overall supporting facilities are not low. There are gymnasiums, swimming pools, executive restaurants, restaurants with private rooms, banquet halls and other facilities. Everything is available, which is really rare in such a central area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital.
This Renaissance hotel is mainly due to its great location. It takes five minutes to walk downstairs to Wangfujing Pedestrian Street. It is also very convenient to go to the scenic spots in the city. I plan to live again when it snows in the imperial capital.

msg:It was the first time I brought my children and father to Beijing. I looked at the hotel on Ctrip in advance. After looking for a long time, I finally chose Jinmao Renaissance. Because I read some reviews in advance, I had a rough expectation in my heart. After staying for four nights, it was almost as expected.
Facilities: The facilities are actually pretty good, not too old. The only possibility is that some wooden cabinets and the corners of the bathroom are a bit old, but others are fine
Hygiene: Hygiene is not bad, but you really have to take the initiative to ask for room cleaning. I will tell the front desk every day before I go out
Environment: The environment is very good, whether it is the hall or the guest room, it is not bad
Service: The service is pretty good, and they are very enthusiastic. They will take the initiative to say "hello" to our guests when they see it
Location: Excellent! It is very close to Wangfujing, and also very close to Nanluoguxiang. Opposite is Renyi, and the Art Museum subway station (Line 8) is right next to it. It is very convenient to go everywhere. You can go to Shichahai, Nanluoguxiang, and the Olympic Park. Line 8 is also very convenient to Tianan Square. There is also a family on the opposite side, just a few steps away to buy some snacks and drinks
Slots: 1. I read the reviews in advance and avoided the pitfalls. The soft drinks and snacks (potato chips and chocolate) in the room cost money! ! ! !
2. Hotel parking is charged, even for guests! The underground parking lot of the hotel is 10 yuan an hour. Although it is not expensive in Beijing, especially in this area, after all, if you live in a hotel, it costs one or two hundred yuan a night to park, which is really unacceptable. I hope that in the future there will be certain preferential parking policies for hotel guests.

The security guards at the door and the male security guards in the lobby are not enthusiastic and do not have five stars. Hotel emotions. 4. The smart devices are too old, and the speakers are still GBL‚Äôs Bluetooth speakers from ten years ago and are ridiculously unusable. 5. The operator at the hotel room center was too cold. He asked for a bucket of ice cubes and put them in a plastic bag. This is the first time I have seen it delivered like this. Is it hygienic? The hotel should take a look at the monitoring and pay more attention to it. Instead of sending it like this, it is better to just say that there is no ice cubes and the ice cubes are still broken.

Afternoon tea has beautiful chocolates shaped like the Forbidden City, which is great for taking photos~

2. When I checked in, I was told that the hotel could not park for free. He said with a bit of disdain: "Our charge is 10 yuan an hour, which is already the cheapest in this area." I asked how many hours are the maximum, and he said "No." Capped‚Äù! The parking fee for one night is only 150. It is strongly not recommended to those who drive.
3. When checking out, the hotel lady asked me how I felt about my stay. I said it was normal. Then she added me on WeChat and asked me to be lenient in the comments. Then she stopped. Then she gave me a map of Beijing. I was surprised. Why didn‚Äôt I check out? I will give it to you when I come in.
Summary: The price/performance ratio is very low, the facilities are old, not worth the price, and inconsistent with its rating. The parking fee rules are unreasonable. It is not recommended for everyone to experience it.

However, there were too many people during the Spring Festival and the experience was not as good as expected. The hotel is a bit old, and the facilities and room types are not ideal, but it is still convenient for daily use and the price is not high.
The important thing to say is that with Ctrip and the housekeeper Qingchuan helping us communicate back and forth this time, we as customers are guaranteed. Thumbs up to Ctrip.

I went to Wangfujing to go shopping until 3 p.m. and had to wait for a while. Hours later, I asked again at 4 o'clock to get the room card and arranged to live on the 17th floor. However, the executive lounge on the 17th floor was not allowed to enter. I couldn't swipe the card and rang the doorbell again. It took a long time to open the door and I checked my ID. It was the first time I encountered this. Kind of thing. I asked at the front desk and was told that I was not qualified to spend. The room rate of 1,780 per day could not be spent in the executive lounge. I was speechless. This is the first time I have seen such an awesome hotel among domestic and foreign hotels. I sincerely give a negative review! I hope the quality of the service staff can be improved, but the staff at the luggage storage are really good! Terrible staff at the front desk and executive lounge!

During the winter vacation, I stayed at Renaissance Hotel with my friends and their children.
It was already early morning when we arrived
The front desk receptionist completed the check-in procedure quickly and upgraded us to a Forbidden City view room. We were super happy.
The hotel room was clean and tidy. It was a very comfortable stay. There were many choices for breakfast.
The surrounding transportation is very convenient. We walked to the Forbidden City. There is also a time-honored Beijing sesame sauce nearby. It is just a few steps away from Wangfujing Pedestrian Street! It's really convenient.
I will bring my family elders to Beijing in April. My children said that I still want to live in Wanli.

The quality How's it going? Overall a bit disappointing. Comments and suggestions are for the improvement and progress of the hotel.

It takes 15 minutes to get to Tiananmen Square by shared bicycles. There is also the Art Museum subway station nearby. Sarah at the front desk is very attentive and considerate. She saw that she was bringing a child and she also provided breakfast. The coffee in the lobby bar is 19 yuan in seconds, which is very fragrant. In short, the experience is very good, and I will stay again next time.

With a bad attitude, Ctrip came forward to negotiate with the hotel, and the hotel promised to pay 500 yuan in compensation. So far, the deposit and compensation have not been received in the past 36 hours! The check-in speed was very slow and the service was impersonal, not worthy of the service of a so-called five-diamond hotel!

msg:After doing a lot of homework, I finally chose the Renaissance Jinmao Hotel. Since we stayed at the hotel at eleven o'clock in the evening, our family of three was very tired, but with the enthusiastic assistance of the concierge staff, the manager Iris finally checked in for us. Since we waited for a while at the front desk and brought Looking after the children, Iris upgraded the room for us for free, and also gave the children a breakfast and afternoon tea.

The room is spacious, bright, tidy and clean, and the big Simmons bed is super comfortable, allowing our tired body to relax perfectly all night, and revive with blood the next day. In the early morning of the next day, when the curtains were opened, one could have a panoramic view of the Forbidden City in the Palace Museum. After eating a rich breakfast in the restaurant, we went to the executive restaurant on the 17th floor. After overlooking the Forbidden City, the whole family went to the swimming pool and jacuzzi on the -1st floor, and started a morning full of energy. The swimming pool is super clean, and my son and husband soaked Hot springs, I swam 1,000 meters in a constant temperature swimming pool, and my metabolism was elevated. An Anxin took a taxi to Qianmen Dashilan to look for food. It only took 15 minutes to reach Dashilan. After eating Quanjude, I walked directly to Tiananmen Square Plaza, the traffic is so convenient.

Afternoon tea at the hotel starting at 14:30 has received a lot of recommendations on Xiaohongshu. Although we have already checked out, the manager Iris still allows us to enjoy it for free, and has been super patient and kept communicating with me.
 
God‚Äº Ô∏èThe super cute Forbidden City utensils are really unique, so cute! Beer, beverages, coffee, fruits, desserts, etc. are all you can eat, I only hate that I can‚Äôt eat it on my own stomachüòä

The experience of enjoying the beautiful scenery while drinking coffee is perfect.

Although we didn't get tickets to the Forbidden City, we made up for our lost hearts somewhat because we chose Renaissance.

I want to recommend the Renaissance Jinmao Hotel to more friends who want to travel to Beijing. It is super cost-effective, good service, good location, and good settings! Will choose next time.

(Small friends who go swimming in the pool remember to bring a swimming cap in advance, of course, it is only ¬•28 to buy one at the front desk of the pool)

msg:Facilities: I live in an executive view room, the room can see the top of the Forbidden City, the highest point of Jingshan Park and the White Tower, there is still a little distance from each other, but it is already quite close. Looking at the shadows of the Forbidden City, I feel happy hiding in the room to enjoy the scenery on a hot day. The room is not big, especially if you have a lot of luggage, you may feel that there is a special luggage desk, but our luggage is only a small box, so it doesn't matter. I really like the design of leaving the area for the bathroom. The bathroom bathtub is very convenient to connect together, and there are many countertops to put things on. It is rare to have a dressing table.
Service: The guest room only asked for a pair of children's slippers. In the afternoon, they took the initiative to send toothbrushes and a quilt for the children. The service is very proactive. The concierge at the door asked the way twice, and the answer was very accurate. The front desk, lobby bar and restaurant service staff are very polite. The 17th floor is the administrative reception, which provides breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner, which is very convenient, especially when bringing a baby, the weather is hot, and the administrative reception is very convenient. Afternoon tea tastes average, but looks great! Yu Qilin's Q bomb is cute. Children also like the jade unicorn lights throughout the hotel. All in all, it's worth staying in. Opposite is the People's Art Museum. If you have a chance, come back to watch a performance next time.

msg:This trip was mainly to bring the children to see Tiananmen Square. After comparing many hotels, we finally chose the Renaissance Jinmao. Sure enough, we were not disappointed. The whole trip was so fun!
Facilities: The hotel has a gym, swimming pool, spa, executive lounge, etc. There is no rush to experience them one by one, but the experience is great! The various facilities in the room are thoughtful and comprehensive, and they are very new!

Hygiene: The most important thing when traveling with children is hygiene. The overall hygiene of the hotel is very good, the rooms are clean and tidy, and the hygiene of the restaurant is also very good. The tableware and wine glasses are very clean and spotless!

Environment: Located on Wangfujing Street, it is quiet amidst the hustle and bustle. Whether it is day or night, the hotel is very quiet. The environment of each place has been carefully designed, and the visual effect is very good!

Service: Here, I would like to specially mention Aaron Liu Yang who received us. We arrived early on the first day, and Aaron checked us in early. Seeing that there was a child, he even gave the child fruit and cake. The child was very happy! The service is thoughtful, and all kinds of questions are answered in detail, which is great!

Meals: Our package includes afternoon tea, dinner, evening drinks, and breakfast the next day! Every meal is delicious, especially suitable for traveling with children. Every time I go to eat, the children are very happy! The breakfast on the second day is even richer in variety, Western, Chinese, Japanese, and there are even pancakes and roujiamo!

Transportation: Next to the National Art Museum of China subway station, one stop to Nanluoguxiang, two stops to Wangfujing Pedestrian Street, three stops to Tiananmen Square, especially suitable for visiting the center of Beijing!

This experience was very good, and I will come again next time to unlock the surrounding Capital Theater and Art Museum!

Knowing how this hotel was rated as a five-star hotel, we stayed for five nights in a row. We arrived at 4:00 p.m. on the first day, but there was no room to stay. Noisy, we had to wait there for at least an hour for cleaning, and the attitude of the front desk for check-in was not good. I can't match the five-diamond and five-star service. The check-in experience is super bad, so I suggest you don't come here. I'm sorry for the five-star check-in experience and service.

Before I finished eating, I made a cup of coffee and found that the food had been taken away. The noodles were not cooked, etc. The most speechless thing is that after checkout, the hotel kept calling just to give good reviews. This was too uncomfortable. I didn‚Äôt want to complain at first, but it was these many return calls that made people want to complain. .

I personally recommend coming when the weather is good. The service attitude is really good. Sarah learned about my hotel situation when checking out and took care of it accordingly. You can still like it

msg:During this family outing, the elderly and children are traveling together for three generations. They have not traveled for three years and have high requirements for accommodation and food. I hope to leave good and warm memories. Staying at Renaissance for three nights will be evaluated from four dimensions: location, accommodation environment, catering, and service, for your reference:
1. Location: The hotel is located in Wangfujing, adjacent to the National Art Museum of China, 5 minutes away from Metro Line ‚ìÇÔ∏è 8, and you can overlook the Forbidden City when you stay in the room type. When you go out of the hotel, turn right and turn 5 minutes away to Siji Minfu Roast Duck Restaurant, a golden location!
2. Accommodation environment: The location is very expensive. Although the room is not luxurious, it is compact and tidy. The hardware is relatively new and the shower facilities are good. The only regret is that the mattress is too high and slightly caved in. The bed configuration is not very friendly to children. Improvements could be made.
3. Catering: The breakfast is rich in varieties, including Chinese, Western and Japanese styles. The coffee provides accompanying cups, so you can eat well and eat well! What can be improved is to add some characteristics of old Beijing, such as: bean juice, burnt rings, stewed, etc. There are a few things that don't need to be too much. It is a pity that the afternoon tea was not tasted because of the tight schedule. The evening energy buffet is remarkable, providing energy for a tiring day. Although there are not many varieties, it is very comfortable to eat, the cocktails are amazing, and the night view is 100 points!
4. Service: Jinmao Renaissance‚Äôs service is what impressed our whole family during this trip. On the day of the trip, the mobile phone suddenly went black, and I was troubled along the way. When I checked into the hotel, thanks to the help of Song at the front desk, I also warmly introduced Great food, thank you very much! On the second day of check-in, the child was unwell and did not eat breakfast. The restaurant manager immediately packed some small snacks for us to bring, which was very warm. The classmate Yu in the executive lounge on the 17th floor of the hotel received warmly and provided refrigerator magnets and ice cream. The children were very happy. On the last day, I rushed back to the hotel at the Temple of Heaven to check out very quickly. After the room service niki learned about it, he immediately made an emergency and helped to delay the check-out. Quality is seen in the smallest details, this is a hotel that makes guests feel at home.
5. Suggestion: It can be more refined, such as attaching a welcome letter from the high-level when the welcome fruit gift, and sending a small gift with the hotel IP when checking out to increase the favorability.
Don't forget the original intention, only then can we always succeed. On the road to Beijing again, I will not forget to go back to "home" (Renaissance Jinmao) again! Looking forward to getting better and better!

msg:I do not recommend this hotel from the bottom of my heart.
1 The windows are closed and completely airtight. The room is air-supplied by an old-fashioned air conditioner. There is no fresh air system, so it is very stuffy.
The height of the 2nd floor is not high. At the same time, part of the decoration has seriously lowered the height of the floor, which is extremely depressing.
3 The room is not big, and there is a big gap with the picture.
4 towels Bath towels have been used for a long time, thin and hard.
5 The details are not in place, there are only two bottles of mineral water in the room, there is no tissue box except for the bathroom, and the bathroom uses large bottles of simple products...
6 The elevator is very small, the corridor is very dark, and the sanitary conditions are average...
7 The scenery outside the window is very average...
Two episodes:
1 Booked a deluxe double room, entered the room and found that there was a door to the adjacent room... Although it was locked, it still made people feel tricked. Is the front desk not clear? Or do you pretend to be confused by pretending to understand, in case there is a talkative guest, you will be fooled? Impression suddenly dropped to freezing point.
2 In most of the five-star and above hotels, as long as the guest asks for a delay in check-out, the check-out is usually extended until two o'clock. Not here, I will discuss with you for half an hour, like a fast chain...
In short, it does not meet the standard of this star or price.

My husband is very busy with work, so we chose to have a small vacation in a high-end hotel in Beijing during the short break. This time we chose the Renaissance Jinmao Hotel. I have been to Xiyuan Hotel, Ritz-Carlton, Westin, Pan Pacific and other hotels before, but they are not as good as the Jinmao Renaissance this time, especially the Westin is a liar. I have issued more than 2,000 membership cards, which cannot be used There were a bunch of restrictions that couldn't be used, so that even the manager couldn't be found in the end, and Jinmao Renaissance didn't have any sales. It felt very good!

The environment, the facilities of old hotels are definitely not like new hotels, but the hygiene is very good, and you feel very comfortable as soon as you enter the door.

The service, whether it is the hotel lobby or the various restaurants in the hotel, the service is very warm and thoughtful. Special thanks to Ms. Wan at the front desk, who was very enthusiastic when checking in and upgraded the room. Li Wei, the concierge, was also very kind! There should be no more entanglements in small vacations in the future. Highly recommend the Renaissance Beijing Jinmao Hotel! ! !

msg:1 point is for the lady gsm at the front desk of the hotel. Her attitude is very sincere and friendly, and she helped me upgrade the room. This is the only point I am satisfied with. The rest is not recommended. The room is very poor and there are serious problems with the phone ringing. It rang at least 7 or 8 times and no one spoke. The shaver was opened, the curtains and the shower head were broken, and the water was delivered. Half an hour to start waiting for the bluetooth speaker to be broken. ! And the attitude of the switchboard and the concierge is very bad and impatient! ! Besides, I checked out yesterday and asked for feedback, and I sent a WeChat message to the gsm work mobile phone, and there was no reply. Everyone, please don‚Äôt come here. You are just spending money to get angry! !

msg:I took my kids to Beijing for a trip. After looking at many hotels, I finally chose Renaissance. The experience of staying there was really worth it. The room is actually not big, but it is very warm, and each area is designed to be very user-friendly. The bedding is also relatively comfortable. What's worth mentioning is the service. When you get off the bus, a little guy will help you pick up your luggage and bring it all the way to the room. When we got to the room, we found some dust on the marble and wanted the aunt to clean it. After receiving the call, the guest room center immediately said that it was their negligence and immediately arranged other rooms for us. It was an instant experience. Sometimes I forget to turn off the do not disturb button when I go out, and the front desk will make a special call to see if it needs cleaning. Seeing that we consume a lot of water every day with the baby, my aunt will put more water for us every time. When I finally left, the check-out process was very fast and I even gave my baby a small gift.

Breakfast: It was good on the first day, but not interesting on the second day. I hope there will be more new products and changes every day, so that you can have something to look forward to if you stay for a few more days.
In fact, it's not very close to the subway station. It only takes about 6 minutes to walk. It's in the middle. There are hotels nearby that are closer to the subway station. I probably won‚Äôt book this hotel next time.

msg:It should be a better choice for the price of the Forbidden City view, but the view itself, service quality, hotel facilities, etc. are not outstanding, and I have not found a reason to come again.

Facilities: Probably because the decoration is relatively early, the guest room does not have a USB charging port, only the Bluetooth headset has two turtle speed charging ports, there is nothing special about it

Environment: I went for the view of the Forbidden City, but the straight-line distance is far away, and because the arranged floor is not high, the view is mediocre. Please refer to the attached picture for details. I have never stayed in other Forbidden City view hotels, so I can't compare it

Service: This is worth mentioning, presumably there is no service.
1. The concierge comrades at the door when getting on and off the bus, I am not very clear about their scope of duties and division of labor, but the two of them just watched me open the door and take my luggage, and they didn‚Äôt know how to give directions or say hello. At that time, they didn‚Äôt have any For other jobs, whether I am arriving/departing from the store, I am a little puzzled.
2. The manager of the executive lounge seemed to be in a daze. When I had to wait in the lounge because no room was ready, manager A asked me three times after I explained the situation, "Your room number." What about?", and didn't intend to go through any formalities for me or follow up on the cleaning progress of the room, and finally waited for manager B to appear before I took the initiative to explain the situation again. I feel that the service of this hotel focuses on "self-help", emphasizing and encouraging customers to have an independent spirit.
3. When I didn‚Äôt find the USB charging port and tried to ask for a plug from the room service, the room service didn‚Äôt even know that there was a USB charging port. After I finished talking, I changed it and said there was, but I didn‚Äôt know where it was, and told me a little After the feedback, then there is no more, reminding me to learn to be independent again.

msg:Before the departure of this Beijing trip, we compared several hotels, and finally chose Jinmao Renaissance. The administrative room in the Forbidden City is really awesome üëçüèª You can see the Forbidden City, the Great Hall of the People, Jingshan Park, etc. when you wake up every day. The view is superb Great, and the location of the hotel is also very good, just 5 minutes away from the subway, Line 8 can go to almost all places you want to go. Next to it is Siji Minfu and Wangfujing Pedestrian Street. It is very convenient for travel
Wendy at the front desk is also considerate in service, and responds to help in a timely manner if there is any need. Will continue to choose Renaissance next time!

The staff of the hotel are very service-minded, especially the young lady in the Chinese restaurant in the lobby who also enthusiastically helped to deal with the watermelon, and Sarah, who is very enthusiastic and makes tourists feel the warmth of home. If there is a chance, I will come again and see you again, Renaissance.

The bathtub is next to the window and it‚Äôs comfortable to take a bath. Speaking of which, it‚Äôs actually recommended that the hotel consider it Replace the drapes, otherwise the natural light outside is wasted. Afternoon tea and light meals in the executive lounge that come with the suite are of average quality, and the overall grade is not high, but you can eat enough. For breakfast, you can freely choose the 17th floor (fewer categories, suitable temperature in winter, quieter) and the 1st floor (more categories, lower overall temperature, more lively people).
The overall feeling should be about 85 points, and there are details that can be improved, but the flaws are not concealed.

The room fee of more than 2,000 yuan is not worth it. It cost tens of thousands for 5 days. There is no breakfast, the minimum welcome fruit is not given, and it is still old-fashioned with a few bottles of drinks for 20 yuan a bottle. Go out and check out other people's 5-star services, and either leave them alone or give them to guests. Your 5 star hotel is still stuck in the same service operation as it was 10 years ago. After leaving the hotel, what‚Äôs the point of calling back to see how your stay was and how the service was. Why didn't I ask when I was staying at the hotel? Really, you can go out more and see what other people's 5-star service standards are.

msg:I compared a lot of hotels before booking. Although some comments said that the lounge and breakfast were "lively", but considering taking the children to the Forbidden City, I chose the Renaissance Jinmao, which is within walking distance to Donghuamen. And the Forbidden City view room can still see a row of yellow roofs and red walls, Jingshan Park and the white tower that makes us scull. Indeed, the lounge is quite lively, the first wave is families with children (myself too), but it is also convenient, the simple hot food can basically fill you up, and the drinks are not bad; the same is true for breakfast, but the waiters are still relatively fast , clear the table as soon as possible. When it comes to service, I think it is necessary to praise it. Except for the necessary star service, I was surprised that because I had an appoin**ent with a tour guide to go to the Forbidden City the next day, I was in a hurry before leaving, and the socks left on the previous day were not cleaned up. Put it in the bag, and when I came back, it was washed and dried in the bathroom, which made me feel embarrassed but heart-warming. Although this unexpected service is not a routine action, such a sense of service must have something to do with the hotel's service philosophy. So next time I will still choose Jinmao Renaissance. The five-star hotel is not the towering coldness, but the warmth of the fireworks in the world.

Proposed late check-out service, the male manager only extended it to 1 o'clock, and did not extend it if it was increased. The attitude was particularly bad.

Twin beds The bed in the room is comfortable enough, which is very suitable for families with children. The hotel service is also very good.

For the convenience of choosing to stay for 5 consecutive days, it is clean and well maintained. It should have been renovated in the past two or three years. It is relatively new. The service is also good, and there are robots to deliver items. Near Wangfujing, about 8 minutes away from the subway station, and the bus station is not too far away.

The package that includes afternoon tea and dinner is actually administrative trea**ent. And don't expect too much from this administrative trea**ent. The environment is like a restaurant, but there is not much food and drink, and the quality is average compared to other hotels. The view of the Forbidden City is not bad, indeed there are not many hotels that can see the Forbidden City. But the faintly visible Forbidden City is not too scenic. After the epidemic, the swimming pool was opened for the first day, and the water was so clear that it was really refreshing. The breakfast is also average. I want to add a few more cheeses, but there are only two kinds. The baguette is not very authentic. The staff are very enthusiastic. The room is big enough and the facilities are good. Parking fee is expensive, no cap

Service: no turndown at night

On the second day after check-in, there was a group of children who were very noisy, which affected sleep. It was useless after communication. After calling the front desk, the noise was still there, and the sound insulation of the hotel was not very good

There are afternoon tea, simple dinner and happy hour in the executive lounge. There are more people and crowded at night

msg:Invincible landscape (only for rooms that can see the Forbidden City). The greatest significance of the existence of this hotel is undoubtedly the first tall building on the east side of the Forbidden City. I live on the 16th floor. You can see the Drum Tower on the far right (daytime), and the Great Hall of the People on the far left (at night, you can only see it because of the lights. Clear.) Other configurations are the configurations that a five-star hotel should have. I live in an executive Forbidden City view double bed room, which is equipped with a bathtub. I like this bathtub. This bathtub is very deep. I, a big fat man of 180*180, can comfortably soak my whole body in it, unlike some hotels. In the bathtub, the legs go in and the body comes out, the body goes in and the legs come out. In addition, their toilet is also very comfortable to sit on. Although it looks ordinary, I have used it many times (with a bit of diarrhea), and my legs have never been numb. In addition, the breakfast is also very good, the bacon is very professionally grilled, crisp and crisp.
    Start complaining. 1. The hotel has been renovated for a long time. In the third picture from the bottom, you can see that the wood grain has faded. It should be that some repair work has been done, but it still looks old. However, it is understandable not to avoid this kind of thing. 2. Some waiters are obviously new recruits, and the training is not in place. I was ordered to find orange juice for breakfast. I went around and found it, but I can understand it during the epidemic. 3. Does the hotel management have any misunderstandings about the hotel's positioning and sales strategy? The executive lounge on the 17th floor provides afternoon tea, which sounds high-end and enjoyable. Please see the last two pictures, it is full It's a small restaurant for people, and there is no afternoon tea, three plates of fruit + two plates of high point, they are all robbed when they are served, and I am not in the mood to eat at all. The hotel also said that there are light meals and cocktails in the evening, and your own service staff didn't have the confidence to let us eat that light meal. I am a working-class person who can't afford to go to the executive lounge, but I don't want the fantasy of the executive lounge to be destroyed. This blame can only be carried by the hotel's management.

If you check in on a Thursday, you will receive complimentary check-in fruit. It will not be taken away on Saturday, and the check-in fruit is only available on the day of check-in. You If you extend your stay, you won't be given any more. Moreover, there was no makeup remover cotton in the toiletry set in the room. I was given two cotton balls and I didn‚Äôt understand what it meant. 2000+ per night. The room is also very small. The bed is quite short. The room at this price is not as big as Atour.

The downside is that due to the epidemic, the swimming pool on the ground floor of the hotel is closed. However, the gym on the 6th floor is still open. In addition, the room type that I lived in this time was small, and the interior of the house was very cramped. Moreover, there is a large platform outside the window, but the surrounding is blocked by walls, so you can't see any landscape outside the window. It is not recommended to live in this room type.

The hotel called one day in advance to confirm, and the next day I checked into the room with the best view. You can see the Forbidden City, Jingshan, Bell Tower, and Drum Tower. Due to the sunny weather that day, the West Mountain is also captured in the distant view, which is quite satisfactory. The room is spacious, and the bathroom is oversized with a bathtub. You can also see the Forbidden City when you take a bath. The scenery is nothing to say.
The front desk staff Miss Xiao Wan was attentive and thoughtful, and helped us reserve afternoon tea for the next day.
The evening light meal in the executive lounge and the breakfast in the first floor restaurant are good, but there are fewer types of afternoon tea. Although the gym is small, the basic facilities are sufficient and the service staff are friendly.
In a small episode, two hours after checking into the room, the foreman suddenly opened the door to check the newly repaired drawer, but after learning that someone had already checked in, he politely apologized, which was harmless.
Overall, the experience is very good. I look forward to experiencing the room type with a better view and his signature theme afternoon tea next time.

msg:This is one of the worst five-star hotels I have ever stayed in in so many years. I am completely sorry for the five-star rating. It is so bad that it is a problem from the beginning of parking. There are many vacancies on the ground and no parking is allowed. There will be a steep slope to the parking lot (the chassis is slightly small). All the lower cars had scratched chassis without exception) I didn‚Äôt warn them in advance. I had been very careful to find the angle, but the car was still stuck. I was in a dilemma and finally exited. The security guard didn‚Äôt care and said that many cars had been stuck. I was speechless in the end. There is a ground parking space for hotel guests, and parking is not free for hotel guests. It costs more than 100 yuan a day because it is outsourced. When we got to the room, we were even more speechless. We booked a deluxe king bed room and got an excavator room. The room was slanted with 1/3 of the corridors, which was very uncomfortable at all. There is only less than 20 square meters that can actually be used by people. There is no room. The couple checked in and upgraded us to a twin room... There were many supplies in the room and we forgot about them. It took two hours to figure out how to move in, and then we planned to move in the next day. We were thinking of not changing hotels and extended our stay for one more day because the deluxe double room we booked was full and we were asked to renew at the price of the upgraded twin room. Originally, the twin room was the hotel we had no choice but to change to. There was no apology at all and they told us about the store. The price is the same as Ctrip. This is the most outrageous thing I have ever seen. First of all, all hotels, regardless of whether they are five-star or not, generally offer free room upgrades for renewal at the original room price. What‚Äôs more, this is a compensation upgrade for all five-star hotels across the country. I have stayed in countless hotels and this is the first time I have encountered such a hotel that is so bad that I am speechless.

After reading the guide on Xiaohongshu, the Renaissance Jinmao Hotel on Wangfujing Street was the most cost-effective hotel. I decisively booked it for 6 nights, and I made the right choice. Our room had two double beds, which was very spacious and very comfortable for a family of four. The hotel's breakfast was also very rich and the swimming pool was very clean. It rained all day on the first day in the capital, so I didn't even go out. I took my children to swim in the swimming pool for an afternoon. The children were very happy. The location of the hotel is also very convenient. It is within walking distance of Wangfujing Street Pedestrian Street, where you can find everything you want to eat, drink and have fun. On the day we went to the Forbidden City, we wanted to take a taxi, but seeing that the weather was so sunny, with blue sky and white clouds, we decided to walk there. We chatted all the way and ate the candied haws we bought along the way. It was so leisurely and leisurely that we were there in less than half an hour. We have wandered to the entrance of the Forbidden City - the Meridian Gate. I highly recommend the Renaissance Jinmao. The hotel rooms, facilities, catering, service and location are all very good!

The enthusiasm of the staff at Universal Studios made me feel at home. If I had to pick one question, it would be better if the room layout was better! Jinmao Renaissance really didn't want to live anymore. Before I saw on Xiaohongshu, there were complaints about bad hotel hardware, old hotel and so on. But I still want to try it with the mentality of everyone asking for different, after all, the location is good, and it is also owned by Marriott! I am also a Marriott member! However, a dramatic scene happened, the door could not be opened, and the luggage was locked inside. From the beginning of their daily cleaning time, they found that the door could not be opened until they finally opened the door to retrieve the luggage for about 5 or 6 hours. During this period, I didn't receive a hotel call to inform me. What is the guest's time? After running up and down the contact staff for an hour before and after, I was told to open the computer and take it out for a meeting, let us go to dinner first. No hotel staff contacted me during this period. Such a big hotel only has a computer to open the door? It's almost four o'clock that the door is open, and we'll be back! The result is another oolong! The door didn't open! Finally, my mother got angry and told me to catch the plane before I realized the importance of opening the door! Then I called and the door opened. Why did it take so long to solve a problem that could be solved quickly? Want us to toss? Worrying about the hotel management! No wonder it gets all kinds of complaints on the Internet! Does not meet the specifications of a five-star hotel, speechless!

msg:During the epidemic, if you are worried about traveling abroad, it is not bad to find a comfortable hotel in Beijing to be lazy. Picked and picked this one.

üôÇ The location of the hotel is good, not far from Wangfujing Pedestrian Street. Go to the pedestrian street at night, the lights are beautiful.
üòäThe room is clean, spacious and well-equipped with capsule coffee machine. The shower and bathtub are in a separate area, and you can take a bath through the window and look at the scenery outside, which is really beautiful. The bathroom has a door separated from the washstand, which can effectively prevent the water from flowing to the outside. The amount of water in the bath is large, and the toiletries are good. The large bottle will not be wasted or not enough. The bed was comfortable, but the quilt was too heavy, it was hot and cold after a while. The pillows were uncomfortable, one was too low and the other was too high.
üòã Executive rooms can enjoy afternoon tea and dinner buffet in the executive lounge. The executive lounge has a wide field of vision, and the surrounding scenery is unobstructed. You can see the pavilion of Jingshan, the White Pagoda of Beihai, the roof of the Forbidden City, and the dome of the Grand Theater. Afternoon tea cakes are fresh and delicious, not greasy or sweet. The fruit is also very fresh, among which the pineapple is delicious. Various sodas, juices, coffees are available. Although there are not many kinds of dinner, the taste is also average. Talking is better than nothing. It is not bad to eat casually, but it is a bit early for dinner, and it ends at 7:30.
üòâ The breakfast is very rich, combining Chinese and Western, especially the variety of small breads and good taste, I like it very much. The juice is freshly squeezed, and the chef can also squeeze carrot juice, which is super delicious.
üòåIt is a pity that the swimming pool will not be open during the epidemic.
ü§™ There is a suggestion to mention that the toilet area, wash area and shower area are separate and independent, which is good, but why the middle door is transparent, this is embarrassing. The person who goes to the toilet can see the person taking a bath, and the person who brushes his teeth can "watch" the person who goes to the toilet and the person taking a bath at any time. Even family members need privacy. Otherwise, the whole bathroom can only be used by one person, which is too strange. .

msg:As a five-star hotel fan, I have stayed in many hotels under Marriott: the fashionable W, the resort-style Le Meridien, the business-oriented Marriott, the design-oriented Edition, etc. Most of them left a good impression on me, so I have always trusted Marriott's brand.
This time, I came to Beijing with my friends and we chose Jinmao Renaissance for two nights. First, my friends are not hotel fans, and the price of Renaissance is more friendly; second, I have never stayed in Renaissance, and I want to take this opportunity to experience it.
On the day of check-in, we played in Universal Studios for a whole day. When we arrived at the hotel, it was nearly ten o'clock in the evening. Since I did not book a room in advance, I asked the male waiter who received us at the front desk about the room price of the day and whether it would be more favorable to place an order on the platform. When I stood in front of him and placed an order on my mobile phone and showed my ID card to check in, he told us that there would be no hot water after ten o'clock. I was a little angry at the time and asked why I didn't tell him earlier but told him after the booking was completed. He said lightly that you can also refund it. At this time, a female waiter next to us came to explain to us the reason for the lack of hot water and apologized that we could upgrade the room type to a premium room. Because my friend and I were so tired, we decided to stay at Renaissance. After getting the room card, I asked the male waiter again what room type we were upgraded to, and he said it was a deluxe twin room (we booked a deluxe room, and the price difference between that and the deluxe room was 80 yuan on that day). When we dragged our luggage to the room on the 8th floor (I don‚Äôt know if it was too late, and there was no waiter to help with the luggage), I found that the shape of the room was exactly the same as the deluxe room on Ctrip: the door was a load-bearing wall, and the room was around the wall, and the toilet was facing the bed. At that time, my friend didn‚Äôt quite believe it, saying that since it was agreed to upgrade the room, it shouldn‚Äôt cheat us. With doubts, I called the housekeeping department and asked what room type **2 was. The answer I got was "**2 is a deluxe room", and I was stunned. I have stayed in dozens of high-star hotels and encountered waiters with cold service attitudes, but I have never encountered a waiter who deceives guests. The operator sensed my displeasure and said to contact the check-in attendant at the front desk. Later, she called me back and explained that although **2 was a deluxe room, the high floor was also considered an upgraded room type. I asked her in return, the hotel was up to the 17th floor, and the 8th floor was not considered a high floor at all. Moreover, there was a messy platform outside the window on the 8th floor. How could it be considered a good view if you couldn't even see the scenery? The operator began to hesitate and asked the duty manager to call me back. The duty manager called and promised to upgrade us to a VIP room and give us breakfast as an apology the next day.
Unexpectedly, the breakfast on the second day also made me experience the feeling of being "treated differently". Because in the high-star hotels I stayed in before, the waiters would generally come to ask what coffee I needed and bring it to the table, so I asked a waitress if I could order coffee. She said that I had to go to the coffee machine to operate the coffee myself. When I got the coffee and returned to my seat, I saw her carrying the coffee to a man in business clothes next to me (he was not old and had no inconvenience in his legs and feet), and asked him if he needed other drinks. I was speechless immediately. Is this how Renaissance treats guests differently? Because I am dressed casually and look young, I am only qualified to pick up coffee by myself. What I care about is not whether someone brings me coffee, but that you do not treat guests equally. Isn't this the most basic principle in the service industry?
After talking about the software, let's take a look at the hardware of Renaissance. To be honest, the lobby of Renaissance has a sense of design. The entire wall of the front desk is designed as a magnificent and tall classical bookshelf, which is retro and gorgeous. However, after entering the room, I found that üí∞ was all spent on the construction of the lobby. The room type is not regular (both luxury and noble); the decoration is rustic; the equipment is old; the room lighting is extremely dim. Yes, I have never stayed in a hotel with such dim lighting, and the spotlights in the two rooms I changed were broken; it is said that the 14-year-old Renaissance is not very old, but the toilet is not smart; let alone sound insulation, there is no difference between having a door and not having a door, and the voices of people walking outside the door can be heard clearly. The software facilities of such a room can only be regarded as a high-end version of Hanting.
The main selling point of high-star hotels is high-quality service. Guests spend several times the price to stay in high-star hotels in the hope of receiving a home-like service. However, the hardware of Jinmao Renaissance is so ordinary, but the software is even worse. The problems I encountered at the front desk and breakfast service of Renaissance made me extremely disappointed with this stay. As a mid-to-high-end line of Marriott Group, Renaissance really needs to do a good job in employee training. At the very least, it should not deceive guests or treat them differently.

Pros: The hotel is in a good location, opposite the Capital Theater, with a view of the Forbidden City, Jingshan and Guardian Art Center. There is also a late check-out service when checking out, which is worthy of praise
shortcoming:
1. There are too few kinds of dinner in the executive lounge of the hotel, and the taste is unpalatable. The soup is very salty, and the Milanese chicken chop has no taste at all (just mix it with the sauce), which is a reaction to the waiter.
2. The hotel room did not ask if it was necessary to turn on the turndown service, but opened it directly. It is best to ask for permission.
3. There is a lot of dust in some places in the hotel room
4. The baguette for breakfast in the hotel was damp, and it felt wrong when it was cut, and it tasted even worse.
Summarize:
1. The Food and Beverage Depar**ent needs immediate rectification
2. Hotels should not think that location and brand are the only factors that determine quality. Improving experience and quality is king.

It is not soundproof at all. There is no reminder that the other room is of the same type, and it is a waste of time to check and then change rooms; 2. The security guard entering and leaving the security check directly scolded another young resident, "You can go to other hotels"; 3. Ask the front desk If you want a paper bag, you will be confronted with "no". A five-star hotel does not have the services that five-stars should have at all.

msg:I came to Beijing in February this year. Let me comment on my real experience. When I checked in, the front desk asked me to look at the room. I felt bad when I entered the room. The environment and lighting were very dark. The key is that the room was very small. I booked an executive room for viewing the Forbidden City. It was 1,699 yuan. I went downstairs and asked them to change my room. The front desk service changed me to another room and said it was an executive room. However, I saw that it was no different from the last room except that it had half a window. There is a whole window. The downstairs is a courtyard. I shouldn't have to judge the price and standard of the room without talking about the size of the room. I went there with my children and I felt that they were just waiting for me to order the dishes. I went there the next day Just change to Regent Hotel. Why I gave this review is because the service of hotels in other cities when I traveled on May Day was in contrast, so I felt I had to give it a review.

msg:The overall feel of the stay at Renaissance Jinmao Hotel is a long review. First of all, I declare that I am taking my children for a weekend vacation, not a business trip or a trip to Beijing. I did a lot of comparisons and inquiries before booking, and the price, location, cost-effectiveness, etc. have been calculated. For hotels near Wangfujing, top-end and high-end hotels are too expensive. The weekend house prices of basic room types are all over 2,000. For similar prices, it also depends on the floor, area, bed type, and location. Therefore, considering that Jinmao Renaissance's twin room is 1.4 meters, it has already killed the twin rooms of all hotels in this area (no matter how high-end, the twin beds are basically 1.2). Of course, if it is a big bed room 1.8 meters, there is not much difference. My child is relatively big, so I choose the twin-bedded room with a view of the Forbidden City. The room area is 42-46 square meters, which is very comfortable.
When I got to the room, I looked at the escape route map, but forgot to take a picture. It can be seen that there should not be many types of rooms in the administrative Forbidden City. There should be no more than 10 rooms on each floor. But there should be only a few twin-bed rooms. I guess they are the ones with the corners of me. The windows are not big and the view is not good. The view of the White Pagoda and the Jingshan Mountain is higher than the Forbidden City. So if it is not necessary to have a double bed, it is recommended to choose a double bed room, which should be more positive. But they are all looking at the side of the Forbidden City from the east. What you can see is the roofs of the major halls, not the imagined aerial view (that's a documentary), so don't expect too much. However, the view and windows of the executive lounge (17th floor) are relatively good, but they are still not bad, and the photos will not be much different. We brought binoculars (for bird watching) with us, so we could clearly see the flow of people in the Forbidden City, as well as the lateral details of each hall, so we were quite satisfied.
Next, let's talk about afternoon tea and dinner in the Executive Lounge. Included in the room rate package, as far as myself and my son are concerned, there is enough to eat and eat, and there are a lot of varieties, but it is not too delicious. But the executive lounge itself is not a restaurant. Its function was originally used for temporary business travelers to hold meetings. How it became the concept of a second restaurant, I am also puzzled. Therefore, those who live in the executive room include simple afternoon tea and simple dinner. This is the expectation. There is no need to compare the food in the executive lounge with the standard of the restaurants in the hotel, as in some 1-point reviews. It's so exaggerated. Snacks, salads, fruits, sausages and fries, fried noodles with rice, stir-fried vegetables, soups and beverages, all of them are available.
Speaking of service, as an ordinary guest, the cleaning waiters, the waiters in the lobby, the restaurant, and the executive lounge are all very nice. As an ordinary guest, they will take the initiative to say hello. Be polite to people, and others will be polite to you. The little brothers and sisters who check in and check out at the front desk, and the bellboys in the concierge depar**ent are different every time. They are all working diligently. They are also answering and solving the problems they have with other guests. Overall, I think the training is in place.
The facilities in the room are complete and there are no bright spots. The towels and bath towels are relatively thin. The showerhead in the bathtub and shower room leaks after use. This is more influential because it will wet the ground and make noise. The bed was very comfortable, and the configuration of the four pillows was intimate. The free coffee and tea bags in the room are a little simple and the brand is average. There are few drinks and snacks in the refrigerator, and there is not much choice. These are all charges. Yes, some comments have complained about this. I am actually quite strange. Whether the food and drinks in the room are free is the hotel's business strategy. Tucao? Sometimes free may be a promotion, and sometimes it may be included in the price, how much cheaper it can be. . .
For breakfast in the morning, there are both Chinese and Western styles. There are all kinds of items that you can think of. The staple food of the noodle stall has noodles and wontons, as well as bean curd. The freshly squeezed juice is commendable. In general, it meets expectations and is ok.
Last is parking. The height of the underground parking lot is only 1.9 meters, and the second underground floor is only 1.7 meters. My car was too high to stop, so I parked on the ground. Because the parking lot is outsourced, the money earned is the guest's money, 10 yuan per hour, and hotel guests can get a discount of 70 yuan for 24 hours. I went to the concierge to apply for a free coupon, which was successful, but the uncle of the parking lot still asked me for 70 yuan. I said that I booked a room with Ctrip, so the hotel gave me a free parking coupon. The uncle is very depressed and thinks that the hotel is doing this too much. . . But I still let me go, otherwise the original price is 218 yuan, and the discounted price is 70 yuan. The parking cost is too high. However, there is no guarantee that the application will be successful every time, it depends on your communication skills.
Finally, overall evaluation, overall satisfaction.

The location of the hotel is relatively superior, close to Wangfujing Commercial Street, and the traffic is convenient. When the sky is clear from the room window, you can see the China Zun and the CCTV building in the distance. The only dissatisfaction is that the hotel breakfast is average and the dishes are few.

But no wine. Thanks to the front desk Lina's service attitude is super good. Because it was driving in the city. Originally, it was 10 yuan per hour for parking. Not capped. It feels quite expensive. Later, Lina and Tom helped apply for a 24-hour parking ticket. Saved a lot of money. And watching us with two kids. Older kids are also over the age of the free buffet breakfast. Also provided a breakfast. Super nice. Extra beds can be added. But I didn't add it. So I sleep on the sofa chair. The main reason is that after adding a bed, the space will be very small. So not added. The bed is high. 3-year-olds will struggle a bit to climb up. But still a pretty good stay.

msg:I came here when it first opened in 2014 and enjoyed the a**osphere and environment of the Executive Lounge. I could see the entire Forbidden City from a distance, as well as Jingshan and a corner of Chang'an Street. Especially miss it! I wanted to live in an executive twin room this vacation, but unfortunately I couldn't find it every day for a week. Finally got another twin room. The location here is excellent. It is not far from Wangfujing, the Forbidden City and the Red Building of Peking University. It can be reached within 10 to 20 minutes on foot. This holiday, I deliberately stayed here to visit the Forbidden City and Wangfujing.
As soon as I entered the hotel, I was attracted by the faint fragrance and decided to buy the same fragrance when I returned home. The gym in the hotel is also very good, the machines are all new, and there are free towels and drinking water to use. The air conditioner in the room is good, the wind is not blowing directly, the bed is very comfortable, and the children like it very much. The breakfast is very rich and there are many kinds of bread, but this time I didn't go to the restaurant on the 2nd floor to eat roast duck. The set menu for 4 people is only more than 800, and I have to come next time.
To say sorry, there are still! Because, there is no executive twin room, it is said that there are only 5 executive double rooms in the hotel, and there is no executive double room that day. I have to come next timeüòÅ, I hope to add a few executive twin rooms. The lady at the front desk of the hotel is also very good, the service is very good and caring, and the service staff of the buffet breakfast is also very good. It feels a bit like arriving in the United States. She takes the initiative to say hello to you, and it is the same when you leave, smiling and saying goodbye to you. ! I feel that there are many Hong Kong people staying here, because last time I came with a Hong Kong lady and sister's family, and this time I heard several waves of guests speaking Cantonese in the hotel. Is this hotel well-known in Hong Kong? üòú

msg:The environment of the hotel is OK, needless to say the location. It is convenient for us to travel. There are two nucleic acid points nearby, close to Wangfujing and the Palace Museum. The facilities are relatively old, and the bathrooms and rooms are relatively compact. The slippers are most likely to be recycled and reused, the bath towels are rough, and the carpets in the room do not need to be cleaned with a vacuum cleaner. I wonder how they cleaned them? Due to the epidemic, disinfectant is sprayed every day, and the smell of the hotel is really unacceptable, and the disinfectant will be sprayed on the floor tiles at the door of the room, and I almost slip when I go out. The service is quite satisfactory, not enthusiastic but at least not indifferent. In short, spending this money is a convenient way to travel, and I really do not recommend it for business trips!

Disadvantages: The hotel is not big, the facilities are average, the attitude of the front desk is very general, the phone is answered once 3 times, and often no one answers. The breakfast was average, not bad not bad. Let‚Äôs talk about the climax event. At first, the child‚Äôs father booked 4 nights. The 5th night was extended by me. I didn‚Äôt shoot the right room type. I would like to see the flag raising in the early morning and ask if they can upgrade to my original room for an extra night. The next day the plane leaves, it depends on my stay for 5 consecutive nights (usually hotels will give free upgrades). But the hotel said the house was sold out that day and could not be upgraded. Later, at my request, I talked with the leader. Then he said he didn't agree. I also run a hotel in Guangzhou. Occasionally, I will accidentally sell an extra room in the backstage. Most of us will focus on current guests or old customers. Or in the case that both parties are fighting for it, we will give discounts or send room vouchers to the other party's customers. In short, we try to make everyone feel comfortable. Renaissance is still a luxury hotel on Ctrip, but the service is to find someone to help me collect my luggage. It also broke my belt, and I'm not in the mood to talk to them about it. never mind. This is the service of a hotel. In a hotel where the front desk often fails to make calls, what more can be expected. This score is given to the male staff member who communicated with me that night, at least he was sincere.

msg:Avoid lightning and persuade to retreat! Avoid lightning and persuade to retreat! Avoid lightning and persuade to retreat! I never thought I would stay in such a bad hotel! A group of 9 people, four rooms, booked two queen beds and two twin beds for two days. We asked one day in advance what time we would arrive at the store the next day, and we were informed that we would arrive in the evening. We also emphasized that we should arrange the four rooms together as much as possible, and the answer was no problem. As a result, I arrived at the store at 18:30 the next day and was told that there was still a twin room and a double bed room that were not ready and were still being cleaned. I went there again at 19:30 and was only given one room, but the twin beds were still not ready! The answer was that because of the shortage of staff during the New Year, the cleaning lady went home. Okay, we understood. We went out for dinner and returned to the hotel at 22:00. After giving the room card and opening the door, there was someone there. One key card was given to two families! The duty manager Lina came out to coordinate and said that we would be upgraded to a room and given free fruits, but there was only one twin room with Forbidden City view on each floor (why didn't we inform on the phone the day before?). Considering it was late and tiring with young children, we accepted it. Unexpectedly, I called the front desk again on the third day. I didn't know anything about it. There was no handover at all. Lina said on the phone that we can call her at any time if anything happens. However, when we arrived at the store in the afternoon, we found that the fruits to be delivered were still not available. The front desk did not answer the phone, and Lina did not answer the phone. It was basically the first time for us, a group of 9 people, to come to Beijing. We compared several stores before choosing your store. I don‚Äôt know where Ctrip‚Äôs high score came from. I couldn't even get to the room at 22:30! I have to throw away garbage in the lobby in the morning, there is no trash can. When I asked the two people at the front desk, they were both very blunt and said, "No, we don't have a trash can!" That means we can throw garbage anywhere? It was only when I raised my voice that I said you should put the garbage here. When I left, I left a bottle of contact lens solution in the room, and I didn't receive any calls from the hotel. After traveling all over the country for so many years, the hotel would send me even a single undershirt. Of course, your store can't even arrange four rooms, so why ask for anything else? I am a Ctrip platinum member and I have never given a negative review. This time, even one point is too much!

The door could not be closed at all. The front desk of the store looked confused and said it would be fixed and asked us to wait. We asked to change to the same type of room, but ended up changing to a room with smaller facilities and fewer facilities. We were not satisfied with the two adjus**ents. In the end, I stayed in the original room and waited for the master to repair it. I called the front desk/hotel service phone many times during my stay, but no one answered.

I've never seen a five-star service with this kind of service. I'm really speechless. (Of course, except for the thin man at the swimming pool, a veteran lifeguard, he was very nice and even lent me a swimming cap. It was used for children to swim in.

I didn‚Äôt even go anywhere else unless I packed it up. Is it a ghost? What's more, why should I tell you that I forgot to go to your hotel if I lost it elsewhere? Do I need a charging cable?

Environment: The so-called Forbidden City view room, the window direction is not facing the Forbidden City, the residential building downstairs is being repaired, there is no view to talk about, when I checked in, I didn't tell you that the floor is low and the room is oblique to the Forbidden City, but it is actually in the direction of Jingshan. The hotel facilities are old, and there is still a distance from the five-star standard!
Service: The waiter will ask if you are satisfied with the check-in or meal. I just want to say that it is true that the service is real.
As a parent-child hotel, the water temperature of the swimming pool is 21 ‚ÑÉ, which is much cooler than the average hotel, which is not suitable for children.
The advantage of the hotel is its location. It is convenient to go anywhere. It takes 5 minutes to dine and shop around Wangfujing.

Although we cannot go to the restaurant to eat and swim during the epidemic, every staff member of the hotel is very friendly. Very good, carefully prepared meals and drinks for us and brought them to the room to eat, especially praised Li Mingrui, a beautiful staff member in the executive lounge on the 17th floor, who is nice and has excellent service. They also prepared small snacks for us. Extra surprise. Thank you. Before leaving, the hotel said that the swimming pool is not open due to the epidemic. When the epidemic is open, you can come to make up for a swim at any time. Wow, that was really unexpected. I wish the Renaissance Jinmao Hotel a prosperous business. I wish all the staff here to protect themselves during the epidemic. See you next time.

msg:The room has a good view. You can see the Forbidden City. I went to the executive lounge on the 17th floor to compare and feel that there is no difference in the room scenery.
The front desk staff are very nice, but only stayed for one night, the butler service has no experience, just added V X as a friend, and finally asked for a good review‚Ä¶
Afternoon tea and turndown service are provided in the room, you need to go down and get the takeout yourself, but the things in the hotel can be delivered by robots~
What I want to complain about is that the bathroom and washroom are not together. It‚Äôs a very strange layout. If people come to the living room, this washroom is really convenient and can keep a private space, but I feel very tasteless when I live by myself.
Meals in the Executive Lounge are included. . It's unimaginable, the place is small, and there are very few things! ! Afternoon tea and dinner are late, there is no seat. Dinner is packed and eaten in the room. That‚Äôs fine. The service ratio of the main executive lounge really can‚Äôt keep up. There are many people and there are few waiters. The service quality is very poor. We We went there late and there was no space, so I left us to the side, did not organize the queue and did not provide a solution, or I asked if I could pack it myself, but I couldn‚Äôt grab the aunt and aunt (I‚Äôm really embarrassed to be thin-skinned). Get a seat and the place is small). . Seeing that we had no place in a circle, the vacant one was immediately taken away by the uncle and aunt. . There is no location waiter can properly organize the queue. . Or you can go back to your room and wait, you can make a phone call when you have a seat, or you can provide a package service, but it's a bit embarrassing to let us wait while watching others eat! If the service and catering quality cannot keep up, can the staff and rooms for executive catering be appropriately reduced? This is a real bargain!
The gym is quite big, and swimming is also open until 11 o'clock in the evening. Please let me know in advance if you need to make an appoin**ent due to the epidemic. You need to make an appoin**ent to go to the gym due to the sudden epidemic situation.
Originally, I had no place to think about booking a hotel for a day on May 1st, but I only booked it when I saw that it was a meal package. ! ! It is much more delicious to spend a few hundred to go out to eat! ! Finally got to order takeout. . .

msg:Taking advantage of the Qingming Festival holiday, the family came out to stay in a hotel to relax. Because I have children, I chose the Executive Palace Palace View Room at the Renaissance Beijing Jinmao Hotel, where you can see the Forbidden City landscape, enjoy free afternoon tea, dinner and happy hour, as well as a heated swimming pool and a hot tub.

But here comes the point. The room shown in the pictures on Ctrip is very beautiful and square, but in fact not every king-sized room in the Executive Palace is of this type, so we remind you that you must confirm with the hotel in advance.

My experience is: when I went to the hotel to check in on the same day, because of the holiday, the room needed to wait. After we checked in, we went out to play while the weather was good. We came back to the front desk at night and returned to my room. It was different from the picture, but it was a proper runway. House. Although it is possible to see the Forbidden City, it is very depressing and the roof is very low. I immediately went downstairs and told the duty manager Lison that I wanted to change rooms, but because of the holidays, the same room type was full. The manager is very nice, very understanding of my dissatisfaction, and patiently showed me other room types. Later, I thought that the child was going to sleep and didn't want to toss, so I suggested that I would need to change the room similar to the picture tomorrow. The duty manager Lison understood very well and promised to help coordinate to a satisfactory room the next day. The next day, Lison took the initiative to send me a message to help me replace the high-rise Forbidden City view king-bed room, which is just like the picture, very good.

Finally, I would like to thank Lison, the hotel manager, for his ability to deal with emergencies. If there is a chance in the future, we will choose to stay here, and the parent-child wall cracking is recommended to stay in the executive room type!

I wanted to go to the Forbidden City to take pictures in ancient costumes, so I booked the Jinmao Renaissance nearby. I was very disappointed from check-in to check-out...Thursday at six o'clock Halfway to the hotel, check-in took at least a quarter of an hour. Then I went to the executive lounge for dinner. When I entered, it felt dirty and messy. The two people at the front desk looked at their phones lazily. I didn‚Äôt say "please help clean up" and they turned a blind eye, let alone service initiative! The food can be said to be appalling. I haven't seen any of the menus displayed on Ctrip anyway! After finishing the dinner in the executive lounge hastily, I went to the room. I didn‚Äôt see the promised welcome dessert when I entered the room. To be honest, I didn‚Äôt care too much about whether to give it or not, but since you have advertised, you have to keep your promise. Anyway, this welcome dessert I didn't even see the dessert from check-in to the end! Finally, I would like to talk about the part that made me most angry-checking out, there was more than 100 meters extra for no reason at checkout, and the front desk confidently said that it was mini bar consumption, but the fact is that I didn‚Äôt touch the mini bar from check-in to the end! I asked her to make a list and told me that I drank three bottles of Evian, so I said, "The remaining bottles of the water I drank in the past two days are still in the room. You can go up and see if there is any Evian!" The sisters said: "The water metering system has been broken for the past two days. If you want to say that you didn't drink from our side, you will cross out these three bottles of water blablabla" Seriously? ! ! ! You are kidding me! I have stayed in so many branded hotels, yours is really terrible, I am not satisfied with the whole process of service! There is no basic hotel management! Try every means to extort money from customers! Because I have the habit of looking at bills, I didn't let you succeed! Still staying in the center of Beijing with this service and management model? I'm afraid it's not too embarrassing for the face of Beijing üôÇ

It can be seen that many old waiters have worked here for half their lives, and the sense of belonging and pride is naturally displayed from the inside out. In particular, the elderly male waiter at the entrance of the swimming pool is very warm and courteous and considerate, which is the unique hospitality of old Beijingers [strong]

[Facilities] The elevator hall is short and small, the material inside the elevator is slightly damaged, and you can see the old feeling of more than ten years at a glance... This kind of old situation is the first time I have encountered this kind of old situation in a five-star hotel. what! The environment of the lobby and restaurant is good, it should be renovated later.

[Room] I took my mother and baby to spend the weekend together, so I chose the executive twin room. The size is okay, but the view of the Forbidden City is a bit far-fetched. My perspective on the 15th floor is so crooked that I can't see anything at all. , but we are natives, so it doesn't matter if we don't see it... Because we travel a lot on business, we know that hotels generally have usb ports, so we didn't bring a power plug, but we didn't even have a power plug here... I plugged it into a small speaker, but it was also broken. , asked the customer service to borrow the power supply, and told me that it was not available, and told me to go to the lobby to borrow a charging charger... I did not agree, and the customer service finally said that I would use the employee's own power supply to borrow it for a day, which solved the problem [poor] I want to ask for one How much is the power cord? Are five-star hotel executive rooms not given one?

[Executive Lounge] Afternoon tea starts at 2:30, with some small cakes, sushi and biscuits, ham slices and fruits; light meal starts at 5:30, in addition to the above, several hot dishes (partial vegetarian) and staple food are added ; The ingredients feel good, but unfortunately, the chef either forgot to add salt or sugar... I understand that less salt and less sugar are good for health, but almost none of them are added, and the taste is really bad, such as small cakes , chocolate and cream are good, but there is no taste at all, just like chewing wax. Even the baby who loves cakes doesn't like to eat [about to cry] Cocktails start at 19:30 in the evening, you can adjust them yourself or the waiter, this service is very good! Very sweet! In addition, the executive lounge is really crowded, and a good seat can only be available half an hour in advance. If you arrive at the time of the meal, it would be nice to have a seat. This is the first time I saw the executive lounge with a lot of traffic üòå

[Meals] The breakfast environment is very good, it should be renovated, the variety is quite rich, it is a qualified five-star hotel breakfast; the meals in the executive lounge are very general, at least with the lounges of JW Marriott and Kerry Hotel. There is a difference in type and taste!

[Swimming Pool & Gym] I am quite satisfied, especially there is a heated pool next to the swimming pool. It is really comfortable to play with swimming bubbles in winter.

The breakfast is very rich, with coffee, bread, cheese, and of course Chinese breakfast. The cold oa**eal is especially delicious. The executive lounge has a good view and happy hour. The variety of drinks at the time is slightly less, the shower in the bathroom in the room is very useful, the electric curtains are very convenient, the slippers are comfortable, and the check-in and check-out are very fast. For people who come to Beijing to travel, this Renaissance is very convenient, very close to Beihai, Jingshan, the Forbidden City and Tiananmen.

Because I arrived at the hotel late in the morning, I was told at the front desk that there was only a room for the last room. Afterwards, I told him that I did not accept and arranged a room as small as 20 square meters. I immediately expressed my dissatisfaction and went to the front desk to ask for a change. The front desk told me that there is no room for you today, so I can‚Äôt arrange for you to change the room tomorrow. Please tell me Marriott doesn‚Äôt understand the meaning of prepayment now? After repeated insistence, the front desk arranged a room on the 17th floor, but it was completely inconsistent with the room type in the picture. It was too late and I could only accept it... The experience was very bad... Although the lobby manager called me to coordinate the next day, I was too lazy to change rooms after staying for 4 days... Generally speaking, this hotel is a bit out of place for this location in Wangfujing... I don't recommend it... I won't choose it

msg:Will never stay in this hotel again.
The hotel has a very low ceiling, so I felt depressed as soon as I entered the room. My son, 177, could easily touch the canopy at the entrance. I thought the executive room with Forbidden City view would be better. Room 1239 can see all kinds of garbage roofs. I only saw the Forbidden City view after my child told me about it. I also booked a king-size room with Forbidden City view, 1211. Its view is much better than that of the suite. You can‚Äôt see so much garbage and you can also see the Forbidden City. There is a pungent smell of perfume when you enter the hotel. It turns out that it is to cover up the musty smell. It is really old and dirty. I wanted to check out at that time, but the front desk did not accept it. The dinner provided in the executive room. To be honest, the dinner on the 17th floor was... It's not as good as a roadside stall. I really don't understand so many people saying that the scenery is good. Are they talking about it? The toiletries are the add-on type that are hung on the wall. They are the kind of Kao shampoo found in guest houses in the 1970s. No one knows what is put in them.


Transportation: Very close to Wangfujing, convenient for eating.

Hygiene: It was really dirty. I had to put a sheet on the sofa before I could sit on it. There was all kinds of pilling, not to mention the towels, which were very old. Mainly, except for a sister with short mushroom hair who did a better job, there was basically no cleaning for the other two daysüßπ.

Service: The restaurant staff are very nice, but the food is terrible. We ate once, and then ordered takeout and ate out.
There are many choices at this price, so I don‚Äôt recommend it to everyone. It's really dirty and the food tastes terrible.

It will definitely make you die without love! The room is small, the buffet restaurant... The most "rememberable" thing is that when I arrived at the hotel, there were three windows for check-in and check-out, but no one paid any attention to me. I said hello very politely (at least three times) to a woman's eyebrows They didn't mention it and told me to go to the counter next door, and then told me to go shopping by myself and check in at 2:00. The problem is that there are very few hotel guests during the epidemic. At 2:00, I brought my family back and checked in. I politely said that I wanted to get my room card. A male teller was playing with his mobile phone and snorted: "Hmm!" The experience was terrible. So I was planning to stay with the kids for one more day, but decided to check out the next day.

3. After checking in, the hotel deducted the deposit of 125. The hotel customer service said that it was because the drinks in the refrigerator in the room were consumed, and only water was free. I was not informed before that, and I did not notice the signs in the room, as a Five-star luxury hotels, service standards are not in place.
Summary: The service attitude is not very good, including reminders for drinks, and there is no notification when checking out that the deposit needs to be received within 2-3 working days, and some parts of the room are not clean. If the travel and accommodation budget is around 1000, it is not recommend this hotel

Overlooking the Forbidden City: This time you stayed in the hotel's landscape room, you can see the Forbidden City view! Overlooking the Forbidden City! The location of the hotel is very superior, looking to the Forbidden City to the east and CBD to the west, and you can see the White Tower in good weather.

Guest room: The hotel‚Äôs rooms are very large, and the bathrooms are of great value. The small surprise is that the slippers are very comfortable and soft. The overall maintenance is very good. It is a good choice on Chang'an Street.

Food: The quality of the hotel's Chinese restaurant Wanlixuan is also very good. It should be the top 1 hotel around ~ beef and yellow croaker are delicious, my favorite is the black truffle noodles, the taste is amazing! Recommendation must be!

The feeling of overlooking the Forbidden City is very comfortable and full of the a**osphere of the imperial city. The hotel service is also very good, especially the service details are well done. The executive floor also provides free telescopes for you to take a closer look at the Forbidden City. The overall decoration of the hotel has a combination of classic and modern feeling, and the Chinese style is slightly trendy. , The lobby decoration is the highlight. The location of the hotel is also quite good. It is convenient to travel. It is very convenient to walk to Wangfujing Street. The National Art Museum Station of Metro Line 8 is right next to the hotel. It is very fast to go to Nanluoguxiang, Houhai and other tourist attractions. When I go out to choose a hotel, safety factor and transportation cost are all important to me, so next time I come to Beijing, I will definitely choose this hotel, which is very cost-effective.

The service staff are very enthusiastic and have a good attitude. I like it so much, I want to live in Jinmao Renaissance next time I come to Beijing.
Thanks to Hu Rui who helped me check in. I was very careful. I continued my stay for three days. Fortunately, she reminded me to update the room card, otherwise I would really forget it myself.
Thanks, praise.

All the guests were sealed in the hotel for 2 days because of the close connection. I asked the hotel what was going on and I didn't know. The attitude was extremely bad and irresponsible. All the blame was on the government. 2 days later, it was 11 o'clock in the evening, and I called to say that it was unblocked. Let's live somewhere else. The lady at the front desk hung up the phone and let us check out. I have never seen such a rubbish hotel, it is still a brand hotel. In addition, the room provided by the hotel does not match the picture and the text. It is definitely not as big as it is described. The room is arranged in a corner, and the door is a 5-meter long and narrow corridor. The room is less than 10 square meters. We stayed in such an environment for five years. God, does the hotel have a good conscience?

First of all, the location is great. Opposite is the Capital Theater of Beijing People's Art Museum, and next to the National Art Museum of China. It's a great place to watch dramas and exhibitions. Next to it, there is the particularly delicious Four Seasons Minfu Roast Duck on the other side. The hotel is very cozy. A special small cake was given to the room for Chris**as. The bedding is very comfortable! The sound insulation is also very good! In addition, the breakfast is still very good, with a variety of Beijing snacks!

msg:üöó Transportation: Located in the city center, transportation is also very convenient. Since the parking lot is managed by a third party, it is not free, and the underground parking spaces are very limited.

üßπHygiene & üçÉEnvironment: The cleanliness is very good. It is approaching Chris**as, and the lobby already has a clear festive a**osphere.
Of course, as a hotel in the city center, you have to accept that the room is not big enough. But both urban attractions and shopping at Wangfujing Pedestrian Street are very convenient.
For families with young children, I just like swimming poolsüòÑ
The water temperature of the swimming pool is very suitable, and there is also a hot massage pool, which is suitable for family travel who do not want to go out of Beijing but want to stay in a hotel. There is also a steam room and sauna room in the locker room. Although it is not big, it has all the necessary organs. üòÑ
The reservation limit during the epidemic prevention and control period also makes people feel better. Swimming during off-peak hours can always feel like a private room. After all, there are only three shower rooms in the women's locker room... so it is really not suitable for too many people at the same timeüòÇ
I would like to express my special thanks and praise to Chen Shuo Tata, the front desk person at the swimming pool, and Zhang Haiyong, the lifeguard Ocean, for being very patient and providing enthusiastic service.
Of course it‚Äôs not without its problems:
There are no plastic bags in the locker room. Although there is a drying bucket, it is really not used very much. It would be a bit troublesome to go to the front desk to pick up a dripping swimsuit...

‚úíÔ∏èAbout the food: I stayed once before and the breakfast was very rich, but this time there were a lot less varieties, especially the selection of pastries was particularly limited. Moreover, the hotel now sells a breakfast buffet separately, so I think it should be improved. Just a moment ~

‚úíÔ∏èAbout the room: Many people may not choose a bathtub in the room, of course, for hygiene reasons. I am a person who likes bathing very much, so everyoneüõÅ will try it~
The feeling was very good last time, but this time I found that the nozzle was leaking when draining water. This still needs to be repaired in time.

üîîService: All staff are very patient and meticulous. Here are a few points:
1. I met the staff many times in the corridor and greeted them proactively with a smile. This attitude is very consistent with the star sign. This not only indicates that the professional training is in place, but also shows that every employee has high workplace satisfaction.
2. When I met the staff at night, they all enthusiastically and politely offered turndown service, which was very nice;
3. The bathrobe and membership issues provided by the Lexiang service hotline are answered patiently in a timely manner; the backend services including the 400 hotline are also professional, patient, and considerate of customers to provide solutions and suggestions;
4. The receptionist‚Äôs attitude of patiently listening to problems, taking notes and not shirk-passing is very professional. He also proactively expresses his hope that it can be shared in the evaluation, which can effectively urge them to do better. This kind of attitude üíØ, I have to mention Xiaowan and Xiao Wan at the front desk here. Han Rui, and a lady with glasses (sorry didn't remember the name) were extremely patient, polite and thoughtful in the process.

It is precisely because of such staff that I am happy to stay again regardless of other guests.

1. I booked a deluxe double room, and the interior of the room is very small. The windows are so small that they are almost non-existent, probably only about 30 centimeters wide. There is no talk of lighting at all. And there is only one chair in the room where you can sit. There is not even a place to sit when guests come.
2. When I went out to eat that night, I found a huge dead cockroach at the entrance of the elevator. It was almost six o'clock. It was past twelve o'clock when we came back, and it was still lying there with no one taking care of it.
It can be said to be a very bad experience.

msg:Overall it meets the standards of Marriott's boutique. Let me talk about the two most prominent points.
One is good service. The overall service is very attentive, and I have understood my needs without even speaking, which fully reflects the standard of hotel service. Take the turndown and give an example. Now, there are very few wine points for turning the turndown and replenishing used items, and a welcome snack is also given. Seeing that I drank two bottles of water, I just filled up the bottled water and gave a few more bottles. I really liked it. I am really thinking about it for the guests, and I will consider staying again next time.
The second is a good view. Because there are too many hotels near the Forbidden City that use landscapes as gimmicks, most of them are a bit of a misnomer, so this time I didn't look at the landscape and only chose ordinary rooms. But I did not expect that the view of the ordinary room is also very good, you can see Jingshan and Beihai White Tower, and the lighting is also very good. Next time I want to try a view room.
Let me talk about the shortcomings. One is that the bathrobe is a bit old, and the other is that the parking garage is too small, and there is no place to park the car when it comes back at night.
Generally speaking, it is very good. The location, rooms, and dining are all right. It is definitely a cost-effective hotel that does not pay attention to publicityüòú

Umbrella said to find a way to help us deal with it. The cold outside let us come in first. Later, even though the umbrella had been scrapped, the little brother was very careful to collect the messy umbrella stand and return it to us.
The last time I stayed here was not long after the hotel opened. This time I was very careful to check in during the epidemic. The procedures for epidemic prevention and control were also done well, and every hotel employee would take the initiative to say hello no matter where they met. . But after all, the facilities have not been new for many years after opening, the overall area of the room is not too big, but the bed is still very comfortable to sleep, I love the soft fufu bed! (There are also desserts on the day of check-in, and the happy hour is very happy~ the blueberry-flavored little cake tastes a bit strange, the other two are quite delicious)

The house is full of mosquitoes at night. It‚Äôs not an exaggeration. It keeps buzzing. My aunt and I hit 6 of them. The next day, the children were stinged everywhere, and they were big bags. Called the room service and said that the child was bitten and wanted mosquito repellent. The first staff member told me that they had all loaned it out, and I would wait to see if there is any. I made the second call angrily, and a foreman came and ordered me mosquito stickers and mosquito sprays in the room. The next day, two mosquito repellents were put in for a whole day. When I came back, I thought there were no mosquitoes, but in the morning there were several big red and swollen bags! Adults are itchy and have red rashes. Not only are there mosquitoes in the room, but they also seriously suspect that the bedding is not clean! ! ! Everyone! The so-called five-star that was unacceptably poor for the first time!

The butler of the Wangfu Hotel has also asked me many times recently why I suddenly had another choice and whether it was because of service. I said that I like the feeling of backing my motherland in Jinmao Renaissance recently. Outside the window, the red wall and blue tiles, after the morning meeting, I served a cup of coffee and looked out to overlook the entire old Beijing! There are also hotel services, the warm-hearted service from the front desk manager Zeng Pingping, Lu Bing from Wanlixuan Restaurant, the girls from the spa, the afternoon tea on the 17th floor...they are very considerate.

1. The front desk is too unprofessional: When I went to the front desk, I said I had a reservation, and the front desk asked me "what's the room number?"; maybe the newcomers understood. Breakfast is included, and the minimum breakfast time and place are not introduced. Then because the room was not cleaned, I was put in another room first. After waiting for about half an hour to call and tell me to send me the room card, I waited another fifteen minutes before coming.
2. Open the door at will: I fell asleep in the room in the afternoon, and vaguely heard someone ringing the doorbell, just about to open my eyes and found the door opened. I was really scared to death, as if I was going to turn down the bed. There are guests in the room, you knock on the door and the door opens when no one answers? ? ? I'm sleeping, what if I'm in the shower or something? ? ? After calling the hotel to respond, there was no substantive response.
3. Insufficient food and beverages: I called me twice to order food in the evening because there was no material to make, basically there should be only half of the food on the menu.
4. There are charges for snacks and drinks in the room. There are only two bottles of water, and the coffee is instant. It is recommended to compare with other hotels of the same level.
5. The check-out time is too long and the front desk is unprofessional again: there are only two people in the four front desks, and there are many people in line, or is it during the peak period of check-out at two o'clock, after giving the room card to the service staff, they ask me what room number is it? ? Are you distrustful or you can‚Äôt even see the room number on the system?
6. I arrived a little late for breakfast, but I also ordered fried eggs before 10:30. When I went to pick them up, I found that the stall had already been closed.

The overall experience and facilities are acceptable to me, but the service is not worthy of the positioning and price.

msg:Bringing children to Beijing to compete in a hurry, there was no appoin**ent for tickets to the Forbidden City. Specially booked the Renaissance Jinmao Hotel to feel the a**osphere of the Forbidden City in the room. The hotel is really close to Tiananmen Square. In this range, the cost performance is super high. Especially Iris of Jin Mao Renaissance switchboard is very enthusiastic and thoughtful. I called and communicated with WeChat in advance, and knew that it was the first time for the children to come to Beijing and did not ask for a successful ticket, upgraded the room type, and arranged a room with a clearer view of the Forbidden City. The design of the hotel is simple and elegant with strong Chinese elements. It's worth coming again.

The waiter fully reflects the attitude of the five-star hotel, treats people kindly and provides meticulous service.
The front desk used to be a beautiful lady, smiles at the service, and the work is meticulous. Bring the children together, and amuse the children to play, which is very impressive.

msg:I often travel to Beijing and book this hotel with my friends every time. The location is very good. It is opposite to the Capital Theater and close to Wangfujing. The service and environment are very good. I sleep well, the beddings are also very soft and comfortable, and the rooms are spacious and bright. It makes people feel refreshed, and the service exceeds your expectations. Not only are there exquisite and delicious desserts in the room, Carina at the front desk will carefully help me upgrade the executive floor double room, and give me great itinerary suggestions. Lina in the executive lounge is not only beautiful and temperamental, but also gave me a buffet dinner. She will consider all the needs of the guests after they check in. Not only the service is intimate, but also it will touch you and give them unexpected surprises. Call! In the future, I will stay here in Beijing on business trips, and I will recommend it to my friends around me! Business trip is the best choice!

They also specifically asked me what room should I book if I want to stay another night after the upgrade? The front desk told me to just book the original one. At this time, the first impression was not bad.
I went to the front desk to swipe my room card at 8pm the next day, and a female manager wearing glasses told me that the room was reserved for someone else and asked me to change rooms. The room was not cleaned during the period, and no one called me before 8pm. I was notified by phone that I needed to change rooms. When I changed rooms, my belongings were lost.
This is the management system of this hotel in Beijing, see you soon.

msg:I didn‚Äôt want to comment at first, but I just received a call back to the company, so I thought I‚Äôd share it. I took the elderly and children on a trip together and stayed in a five-star hotel next door for four days. The family thought about trying another hotel. You don't know how good your ex is without comparison. The floor is high and low, and the view out is an innate problem, let alone acquired. First of all, the service starts from the concierge, who is not active and proactive. The check-in/out speed is very slow, and the staff is always next door. I rummaged through the shelves for the list, then came back empty-handed, not sure why. The phone in the room was dusty and the gaps on the luggage countertop were dirty. I go out during the day and come back at four or five in the afternoon, and no one cleans the room. Breakfast, no one to guide you. The elderly and children wanted to drink something hot, but the milk was cold. On the co**** grain table, things were scattered all over the table, and no one cleaned it up. There was no one to collect the dinner plates, so I had to go to the door to call someone. The weirdest thing is: when checking out, the staff told me that the room fee had been paid and it was OK. I asked about the deposit and was told that I didn't see any deposit. I didn't want to dwell on this issue, so I asked the other party to check it out and left. I just received a call from your hotel. After communicating for thirty minutes, the other party realized that the deposit was not noticed. As for why, I don't understand either. I feel that you treat customers this way and do not cherish this brand, which makes me lose trust in Marriott. Really, compared to the previous one I stayed in, the location is the same, the price is more expensive, and the experience is completely missing. The first one I encountered on Ctrip.
