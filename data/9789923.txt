Beds are very big and comfortable. No smell of cigarette in the room. Breakfast is very tasty. Minibar is free. Whatever we needed we could get at the hotel. Very convenient and relaxing. We did not like the location because of the beach. There is no private beach. Actually, there is no good place to swim in the sea there.

- rooftop pool is ok, closed between 12 and 15. Then gets extremely crowded with selfie taking people and very few seats. Not so enjoyable

- generally hotel feels not well maintained, partially abandoned

It is less than 15 minutes away from downtown and right next to beach. The room service was so good, (I do not know the name of lady who daily gives room service she was awesome). another girl who helped us with everything during our stay, like extending our stay, location and many more was Natasha. Ian the girl in the kid play zone was so kind, I love her. 
it was my birrthday during my stay and they surprised me by decoring room and by a cake for free. breakfast was awesome. Briefly, it was awesome in all its services, if I ever go to visit Sanya again I will definitely stay there.

I booked this hotel because of the infinity pool mainly, which was nice. But if it‚Äôs the only reason you are planning to book it-bear in mind that you can just visit it once by simply buying tickets at the reception area and spend the day there. 

Hotel was okay, breakfast was pretty poor in comparison with other 5 star hotels, especially in terms of western food.

We had 2, 3 day, 2 night mother and daughter specials, that included breakfast and a spa treatment. The spa  was luxurious, we extended our time there because we had such a wonderfully experience. The masseurs were amazing, I have never felt so relaxed. We ended the treatment with a invigorating steam. 

Our time at the Conifer hotel was so fantastic, we decided to extended our holiday for an extra 5 days, incurring extra costs to change our flight. üòÉ

Thank you again Natasha, you have truly made our stay at the hotel a special one. This holiday was very special because it was for my daughter‚Äôs graduation, and  you went above and beyond to ensure all our needs were met. You are always available, polite, enthusiastic and caring. Thank you üôèüèΩ

You can perfectly plan two or three nights of your holidays in this place to enjoy the relaxing environment, incredible facilities and the activities nearby. 

I stayed there a few days and felt absolutely spoilt. The staff working in the resort are friendly, professional and supportive. Hospitality is generally good and some of them speak english which makes comunication easier. 

The place is well maintain and peaceful. It is surrounded by a huge number of palm trees, creating such a tropical refreshing environment. The hotel has a great outdoor infinity swimming pool with a view to the stunning blue water of the sea. The rooms are spacious and very clean. It a restaurants, bars, lobby, beautiful gardens, beach, gym, spa and many other facilities.

The rooms are very spacious and clean. Breakfast is included and the food in the hotel is really amazing!

I arrived at midnight, and the taxi from the airport was about 16 yuan. The hotel upgraded to a sea view room for free, and the scenery was great! The infinity pool on the roof is so beautiful. The scenery is especially good when I go there early in the morning. The water is calm like a mirror, and there are not many people. The breakfast is also very rich and tastes very good, and there are Hainan special snacks and noodles. Go downstairs and cross the street to the Coconut Dream Corridor Beach. The bus is also very convenient downstairs. A perfect experience. I will choose this place next time I come to Sanya!

The lady at the front desk is also sweet and has a good attitude. The beach is just across the road from the hotel, which is very convenient for children to dig sand. The infinity pool on the rooftop is very large and looks great for taking photos. There is also a suspended pool. There is also a family pool and a children's pool on the first floor. It is cost-effective and I will stay there next time.

msg:A very satisfying stay! During the stay, I admired and appreciated the performance of Natasha, the new Yan of Sanya Kangnian Hotel; whether she gave the guests' needs or the places the guests wanted to go, she explained very clearly and let the guests feel her enthusiasm.
The appearance of the room is a modern textured building, simple and elegant, with a soft shape, showing the regional architectural style of Sanya. The hall and bedroom in the room are facing south. The spacious balcony combines the blue sky, sea water and sunshine. You can feel the sunshine during the day and enjoy the romance of the starry sky at night. You will experience the luxurious sea view and linger. The infinity pool on the roof of the hotel is the only choice sought after by many young people! The hotel is located on the seaside of Sanya Bay. It is very convenient to go out for swimming. The hotel lobby is luxuriously decorated, and the view for guests after entering is very broad. At the same time, the waiters are also very enthusiastic and almost respond to the guests' requests. It is a hotel worth recommending! The facilities in the hotel room are very advanced, and the hygiene in the room is also very clean. The large sliding floor-to-ceiling windows can see the night view of half of the city. The bed in the hotel room is also very comfortable. It is a very good stay experience. The hotel room is very spacious, and the hot water is also very fast. We stayed on the 11th floor and it was hot in less than 2 minutes. It was more comfortable to take a shower. There is also a bathtub on the balcony. üõÅ While enjoying the sea view, drinking a little wine, two people soaking in it will not be small, especially romantic! The hotel has good green coverage of 70% natural oxygen bar. Each room has a balcony with pink flowers planted on the balcony, which is really suitable for taking pictures. The price-performance ratio is very high, and I will choose to stay here next time!

Overall, it is similar to the one in the video, with a sea view room and a swimming pool.
But when I ate noodles for breakfast, I found a small piece of plastic bag.
I went to the suspended swimming pool at around 10 o'clock in the morning, and there were not many people.
But the water quality is very poor, not like the one in the video.
I told the merchant, and he said he would give me a discount of 100 or 200 next time.
I don't mind spending this little money, so I'll give a truthful review.

There is no robot outside to deliver the room, so you have to go to the lobby to get it yourself. The sea view room that we upgraded was great.

msg:This is a pleasant trip that must be rated five points. There were constant surprises during the stay. A family of three checked in on May 1st. They booked a garden bed with two breakfasts. Because they brought their children, the front desk happily gave them a breakfast. This was the first surprise. After checking in, because the floor was too low, they could neither see the sea view nor the garden view. With the mentality of giving it a try, I asked the housekeeper if I could change to a higher floor. Because the room was full that day, the housekeeper happily agreed to change it the next day. The next day, I was upgraded three levels and directly changed to a high floor full sea view king bed room. This was the second surprise. The third surprise is that the front desk service of this hotel is the best I have ever stayed in a hotel. The waiters are well-trained, fast and efficient, dignified and generous, smiling throughout the whole process, and no deposit is required for check-in, and no room inspection is required for check-out. The fourth surprise is that during the stay, I asked the housekeeper to send disposable items three times on WeChat. Each time the housekeeper's service WeChat was replied in seconds, and it was delivered within three minutes. It is not easy to be so fast when the rooms are full on May Day. The fifth surprise is that the room door card is in the form of a waterproof bracelet, so you don't have to worry about losing the room card when you go out for a swim. The sixth surprise is that there is free bottled drinking water wherever you go in the hotel, and the drinks and snacks in the room mini bar are all free. The last surprise, and the biggest surprise, is that the infinity pool on the roof is so amazing, amazing at its sea and sky, amazing at the many beauties checking in in the pool! Amazing at the meticulous lifeguards. Finally, I would like to emphasize that I would like to thank my housekeeper, the lobby manager Mr. Yang Xiwo, for providing all kinds of consultation, coordination, and standard gold key services throughout the process (I don't know if Mr. Yang is a gold key). In short, if you come to Sanya Bay, you must stay at Kangnian Hotel!

The room and hygiene are quite good, but the hotel is equipped with relatively few restaurants, and there is no dessert shop. The place for a nap in the afternoon is a bit limited~ After all, it is quite hot to order takeout on the balcony.

Minibar drinks: I will focus on this project. Ctrip is once a day. I reported it to the hotel and it was the first night. Later, I reported it to the Ctrip platform and it was delivered to the room again. But it was still not available the next day. I communicated with it the next day and it was still delivered. After that, it was not available again. There is no more than three times, and I am embarrassed to ask again. But I think the platform communication is completely problematic. It is obviously a special project added by itself, and it still needs others to remind it. Although there is not much, I feel cheated.

Whether it is the location or layout of the room, or the clean and tidy room, the view of the balcony is also very good. You can have a panoramic view of the sea view and garden view in the room. Thank you very much to Li Song. The information venue of the hotel is very detailed, and the travel and dining are also recommended very well. I received a spa voucher and the massage was very comfortable. The service was particularly enthusiastic. The problems reported to Li Song were well solved, and he would also take the initiative to ask about the feelings and feedback. He learned that I felt a little damp. When I came back from going out, I had arranged a dehumidifier and aromatherapy in advance. When I came back, it was fragrant and not damp. I also put a bathtub film and a bath ball. After dinner, I came back and took a beautiful bath to sleep. The other party also made a reasonable explanation. As for the room by the sea, I did open the balcony door to watch the scenery there for too long. The sea breeze blew towards the room, and the air conditioner was turned on. I also felt that some dampness was normal. It was not damp when I first checked in. I mentioned it to him in advance, and he arranged for an advance inspection. The items in the room were also neatly arranged, and everything was very convenient. From check-in to my feelings and communication during the stay, to knowing that I checked out early in the morning, he was waiting in advance and came to take the room card and luggage, sent us to the car, and asked if we had breakfast. Check-out was very convenient and fast, and the experience was also very good. I had breakfast, and the hotel's breakfast was still very rich. Although I only stayed for one day, he served me throughout the whole process, like an exclusive butler, which was very good. I will come again next time I go on a business trip or travel, and I will also recommend it to my friends. Just find Li Song, a handsome guy at the front desk.

msg:I really can‚Äôt help but want to give this hotel five-star reviews again and again. All aspects of the environment and facilities are excellent. The restaurant is disinfected every night. I saw with my own eyes a staff member carrying a big spray can spraying and disinfecting at night. Even The cleaning ladies are so enthusiastic and sincerely help you clean the house. After staying here for a week, I was really touched by the cleaning lady Lan Yanyu. Every time we came back except for the room, the room was cleaned very neatly. Even our shoes are neatly arranged, and the details are so perfect. I put the towels we brought aside after using them, and Sister Lan Yanyu will help me fold them neatly and put them away every time she sees us. They all say hello with a sincere smile. Such good employees are really lucky for the hotel. There are also many details. For example, if we don‚Äôt eat the fruit, we will get new ones. Water and snacks will be replenished in time. The toilet is disinfected with disinfectant every time. You can smell the disinfectant when you come back. I know it must have been disinfected, it is very clean, and the experience is really nice. I hope good employees will be treated better.
Facilities: They are all new, just like the photos, and many details are done very well.
Hygiene: Very good, someone disinfects it every day
Environment: Very close to the beach and close to places to eat.
Service: Of course it‚Äôs good, nothing to say

The gym facilities are great. There are few people. It is almost reserved.

I rented a car at Sanya Airport and drove to the hotel. It is very close. The underground parking is also very convenient.

The overall price of the Crested Ibis Seafood Buffet is not good. The food is not in line with the price. The service staff is also a bit dull.

msg:On our last trip to Sanya, we chose to stay at the Sanya Conifer Hotel. This choice was really not wrong. First of all, the check-in process at the front desk was very fast. They also arranged a room on a higher floor for us. After that, we added a room with the housekeeper Xiaoqi. WeChat, ah... Oh my god, we are all full of praise for the service of the housekeeper Xiaoqi. She answered the questions instantly, cared about whether we were used to the comfort of the pillow, and suggested where we could go to play, and registered children for us. Activities, how many fruits and drinks were delivered to the room, and I have to mention that they found a conversion plug for us, because we have British plugs in Hong Kong, and now we can charge our mobile phones. We forgot it when we left the hotel. In order to pack my daughter's sun protection coat, after communicating with the housekeeper Xiaoqi on WeChat, she immediately searched for it for us and sent it back to us immediately after finding it. The housekeeper Xiaoqi was really considerate and the service level was very high. It is definitely worthy of praise. We will come back next time if we have the opportunity. When vacationing in Sanya, you will definitely stay at Sanya Conifer Hotel.

msg:This was the first stop of 5 hotels in Sanya vacation trip. After getting off the plane, I wanted to check in and rest early, so I chose the nearest Sanya Bay Connian. Conifer Hotel is very new, with complete facilities and excellent sea views. It can span the entire Sanya Bay. The infinity pool on the roof is the biggest highlight. The mineral water in the room is unlimited. This is very worthy of praise in Sanya Bay. The room is spacious and bright, with a reasonable layout, complete infrastructure, and a rich breakfast. Sanya Bay is also top-notch at this price point. Due to a small accident during the check-in process, the hotel's Dora customer service manager responded quickly and handled it in a timely manner. , followed up, changed to a better room, and helped solve all subsequent problems. We are very sure and satisfied with her work. In today's era of serious hotel homogeneity, with such meticulous and considerate service, Conian will definitely stand out among many hotels. We will definitely visit Connian again and will recommend it to my friends.

Our two rooms were made into king-size beds in advance because Ctrip package only had twin beds when we booked, and the king-size bed was full on that day. The bathtub was on the balcony, but because our sea view room was relatively close to the corner, the privacy was still OK, and the children didn't care anyway, hahaha. The hotel has a small children's playground, a bubble pool and so on, enough for children to play. It's more convenient to cross the road from the hotel to the beach. On the right hand side of the hotel entrance, there is a place for the hotel to wash its feet, so you don't have to queue up at the beach~~~~
I personally have a light sleep, so I think it's noisy near Sanya Bay Road

msg:A little while after booking the hotel, the housekeeper added WeChat, informed the hotel of various details in advance, asked about the needs, upgraded the room and arranged the three-sided fence in advance, very attentive
I arrived in Sanya early that morning and booked a hotel in Sanya Bay, which is close to the airport. It took about ten minutes to take a taxi. I also received a small welcome gift for the children when I checked in.
The public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is not big, and the infinity pool on the roof is very impressive, but it was very windy, so I didn‚Äôt go swimming this time with my baby. I went there to take some photos during the day.
The baby prefers the children's club. I'm afraid of getting sunburned at noon every day. I usually go back to the room to sleep after getting tired from playing in the children's club. In the afternoon, I go to the heated swimming pool to participate in the bubble party. The overall feeling is that although the baby is small, it has all the internal organs. For a one and a half year old The baby is very friendly, but the older ones may not have enough fun.
The breakfast is quite satisfactory. The beach is just across the road from the door. It is very convenient to take a taxi to eat in the city. There are many choices within five to ten minutes' drive. Families with babies can adapt to the environment in the first two days. The price/performance ratio is average. It may be the blessing of the Internet celebrity swimming pool. More suitable for couples to take photos.
Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper @Â∞èÂ•á for her careful explanation, which allowed me to quickly understand the various public areas, environment, and activity times of the hotel. On the last day of check-out, considering that the baby had to rest at noon, I even applied for a late check-out.

msg:I did a lot of research before coming to Sanya Bay. Choosing a hotel was the biggest headache. After reading thousands of reviews, I finally decided to choose Connian. We flew to Sanya at around 11am, and it was less than 12pm after we got off the plane and took a taxi to the hotel. I asked the front desk and was told that one room had been cleaned and ready for check-in, and there was another room that I had to wait for about an hour. Because we were traveling with two children and two elderly people and a lot of luggage, we were able to arrange check-in when we arrived at the hotel. This was a great first impression for me. When checking in, I added housekeeper Xiao Nie. Xiao Nie's service is really good and she is absolutely responsive to all requests. First, he introduced me to the hotel's various swimming pools, the opening hours of the restaurant, and also sent me some surrounding dining options. The next day, I would take the initiative to ask if I slept well and if the pillow was comfortable. If it was not comfortable, they had other pillows that could be changed. Later, I added a buckwheat skin pillow, which was really comfortable. Originally, I only booked two days here at the beginning of my trip. I planned to go to other hotels to experience it later, but the service here was so good... I couldn't bear to leave... Plus, the infinity pool and cantilever pool on the roof are so beautiful at night. Yes, I stayed for another two days. The housekeeper Xiao Nie was really nice. He upgraded us to a sea view room. Big thumbs up. Let‚Äôs talk about the food and drinks these days. Because we have children and the elderly with us, we basically dine in the hotel. The seafood buffet on the 16th floor of the hotel is especially popular. There are many varieties and the price is not expensive. Children and the elderly love to eat. The most important thing is the service. One of the waiters is named Song Kaixi. What can help you. In fact, my little devil wanted to eat blueberries, but there was only one blueberry on a fruit bar, so she gave the fruit to her brother, and she ate that one blueberry... But you can't give up the whole fruit for one blueberry. Eat all the sticks... Later, Xiao Song took the initiative to help me get a small bowl of blueberries, and finally appeased my little devil. Although it was not a big deal, I was very touched. Because I asked another waiter before, but he said there were no separate blueberries... I think this is the sense of service... Generally speaking, I am very satisfied with the hotel room. It is a worthwhile trip and I have already given it to my friends.

Environment: One of the best hotels in Sanya, the environment is unparalleled. It is very pleasant to have afternoon tea in the infinity pool on the rooftop.
Cleanliness: The cleaning was very timely. When I came back from the trip, I found that my aunt had folded all the messy clothes for us.
Facilities: Basically all the hotels I can think of will provide them. I was afraid that guests would not have toiletries after playing in the water on the roof, but they were also equipped with travel clothes. This made me feel very considerate. The water quality of the infinity pool is very clean and the visibility is very good. It‚Äôs very comfortable to swim in (Video 1). The water in the cantilevered swimming pool is warm and the visibility is average (Video 2)

There were two episodes during the stay
1. I booked a 3 days and 2 nights package. I made an appoin**ent for travel photography as soon as I checked in. However, I was told by the staff that it was the peak season of the hotel and the earliest I could make an appoin**ent was after I checked out. To be honest, it was a little bit What affected my mood was that I was on my honeymoon after all. I didn‚Äôt want to miss a photo at such a worthy place. I communicated the reason with the front desk and they said there was nothing they could do. Many girls were afraid of not being able to make an appoin**ent and would make an appoin**ent with the hotel after placing the order. This was my fault. What I didn‚Äôt know before can be used as a reference for the little sisters. After learning about this incident, our room housekeeper Xiaoya has been helping me coordinate. Finally, on the morning of check-out, I took a travel photo given by the hotel (Picture 8). I personally think it is very Like it, thank you very much to our housekeeper Xiaoya.
2. The door on the left side of the hotel balcony is very tight. Sisters who have long nails must close it carefully. I accidentally pinched my handle without paying attention. It has been bruised for a long time and it is not completely healed yet. The staff is very responsible. I kept asking if I wanted Yunnan Baiyao and Band-Aid. Although my hand was injured, my heart was still warm.

msg:Originally we only booked for one day, but stayed another night because of Xiao Nie's excellent service. The infinity swimming pool is really beautiful and an absolute holy place to check in. The staff are very professional and enthusiastic, and the environment is first-class. The only drawback is that the breakfast room is underground and the food should be richer. All in all, it is a good hotel worth recommending.

msg:I first met Kang Nian in August 2022. At that time, I was locked in the hotel for two weeks due to the epidemic. I also participated in and witnessed the whole process of the hotel arranging food, accommodation and charter flights for tourists under the leadership of Mr. Qiao at that time, which left a deep impression. I came back this time because I wanted to experience Kang Nian in a free a**osphere. As expected, I was very satisfied with the whole three nights. I also saw another side of Kang Nian. 1. The hotel is very considerate. In addition to the normal breakfast for two, it exempted us from the cost of breakfast for the children. 2. After understanding your mattress preferences, arrange for the waiter to turn over the mattress and ask about your feelings. They also helped to put together twin beds, which were very comfortable to sleep on. 3. There is an unlimited supply of minibar and fruit every day, which is actually endless. In the end, I left a lot of it in the hotel, and I can feel the hotel's thoughtfulness. 4. The sanitary condition is very good. I have been to many hotels in Sanya. Due to the humid weather, there will be various minor problems. Kangnian is very thorough in cleaning. Very satisfied with this. 5. The infinity swimming pool and transparent bottom heated swimming pool on the top floor of the hotel are really beautiful. They look great no matter how you take pictures. It is really enjoyable to lie there and bask in the sun‚òÄÔ∏è and relax yourself. 6. The important point is to mention that the account manager Xiaoji was the most timely in terms of inquiries before check-in and assistance after check-in compared to other hotels in this trip to Sanya (we stayed at Conian, MGM, and Intercontinental this time). , spot on, and considerate. As long as you have any needs, please contact the account manager Xiaoji. The response from the hotel is very fast and the service will be in place within five minutes. This is the most impressive thing I have ever stayed in among all the five-star hotels in Sanya. This is also the second time in the past few years that Sanya has written a five-star review for a hotel. The last time was the Westin Haitang Bay during the Spring Festival last year.

On this trip to Hainan, I really want to thank Ella, the housekeeper at Conifer Hotel, for calling us as soon as the plane landed and upgrading us to a sea view room. I learned that we were bringing a baby and they had to prepare bed rails for us. The service is very attentive, and welcome fruits are delivered to the room by the room service staff every day. I felt at home throughout the whole process and the experience was great. The Internet-famous infinity pool on the roof is so beautiful that it is better than various attractions in Sanya. I will stay at this hotel next time I go to Hainan.

I am very lucky to meet a very patient and attentive Miss Xinyan who provides a full range of services. It can be said that she is responsive to every request, of course.

When we opened the balcony door, we could see the sea and the unique bougainvillea in Connian. It was a perfect match. The room was also large and the details were well done.

There was no upgrade to the sea view, but the housekeeper Natasha arranged a quiet room with a good view for me as requested. Welcome fruits and mini It‚Äôs free, and Hainan‚Äôs specialty coconut flakes are also particularly delicious. Because it was an anniversary, the hotel specially prepared a small cake for us, and it tasted pretty good. The room is different from ordinary star-rated hotels. It has a unique resort style. The bathtub on the balcony has a view of the swimming pool. The breakfast is okay, but not bad. Needless to say, the infinity pool is really amazing. If there is anything that needs improvement, it is that TV screencasting is a bit inconvenient.

Since the opening of Conifer Hotel in Sanya, Conifer Hotel in Sanya has been my first choice because it is the most cost-effective hotel in my opinion. From the hardware point of view, the hotel has a superior location, whether it is the beach or the surrounding restaurants, there is also an infinity swimming pool on the rooftop, which is like the infinity swimming pool of Burj Al Arab in Singapore, as well as a children's playground and a children's play pool. The heated swimming pool is very considerate. The hotel elevators, room facilities, breakfast varieties, environment, etc. are all very satisfactory. In terms of software, from parking to the front desk to bellboy service, it is also remarkable. The room cleaning is in place and everything is perfect. It feels like home. What I especially like is that the breakfast is not only rich in variety, but also more user-friendly. There is also a snack cart service for the convenience of seated guests. At night, the hotel also specially set up a light constellation show to check in for guests. Everything From the perspective of customers, I think that next time I come to Sanya, Sanya Conifer Hotel will be my only choice!

The location is very good, the airport is not far away, there is a shopping center nearby where you can buy everything a tourist needs.

The housekeeper did not take the initiative to remind you to help make reservations. You only found out when you went to the front desk to ask. Enjoyed the barbecue (we went to the rooftop according to the reservation time, but the rooftop staff could not find our reservation information and temporarily arranged a seat for us). When I went to claim it at Starbucks, I encountered a colleague who was working the other day and couldn't verify the coupon, so I had to come back later to receive it. Travel photography is the worst part. We didn't get an appoin**ent for two days after we checked in. On the first day, we asked the housekeeper if we wanted to make an appoin**ent in advance and wanted her to help us make an appoin**ent for the next day's travel photography, but no one responded. We went to the front desk to ask ourselves, and they asked us to scan the code and add the travel photography WeChat to make an appoin**ent. Since the travel photography got off work at 6 o'clock, we could only add me the next day. Then at around 9 o'clock the next day, when the customer service agreed with our WeChat, we wanted to make an appoin**ent for a travel photoshoot the next day in the morning, but we were told that our appoin**ent was full and could only be taken in the afternoon, but we checked out at noon and still took photos. I can only say that it seems that the hotel wants to provide good service, but the collaboration efficiency between depar**ents is too low. Guests have to make appoin**ents by themselves. The butler service is not like that of other hotels. If you are in a hotel without butler service, the experience will be very good. After all, the price is very cheap for a five-star hotel.
Facilities: There is an infinity swimming pool and a rooftop heated suspended swimming pool, which are quite good. However, the weather has been too cold for the past two days and the infinity pool cannot be filled.
Hygiene: Hygiene is very good, there are no bad spots. The breakfast is buffet. It should be the off-season, so it is more comfortable to eat when there are not many people.
Environment: The room type has been upgraded and you can see the sea view.
Service: Kangnian has a butler service, but don‚Äôt expect too much. The butler assigned to us was very busy at the beginning. It took a long time to get a reply when asking some questions. Later, he would also take the initiative to ask if there was anything missing in the room. We went to the front desk to report it, and a new butler Xiaoyun was added to our service. He was quite considerate and would proactively ask about our check-in experience and whether we were missing anything. One mistake was that we asked the housekeeper to make an appoin**ent for us to have a barbecue on the rooftop at 6 o'clock. I don't know why we didn't make the appoin**ent. When we went there at 6 o'clock,

The hotel service is very good and the breakfast is also very satisfactory. The kids had a great time. It is very close to Sanya Bay Coconut Dream Corridor and the airport.
Tickets for the rooftop internet celebrity infinity pool and cantilevered transparent pool: it is indeed beautiful.

The next day after breakfast, we hurriedly played for a while and then rushed to the airport. I really didn‚Äôt play enough,
I also had coconut chicken at the hotel. The hotel restaurant is pretty good. I haven‚Äôt tried the buffet yet. The food and service were both good. Although it is a bit old, you can still see the prosperity of the past and it should still be very popular in the peak season.
The hotel facilities are also very complete, including children's naughty castles and various handicraft activities for children. Although we arrived late and didn't catch up, I was very satisfied with it. The customer service staff would call us before starting to take us to play. I will choose here next time when I bring my children. If the children are happy, we will be happy too. Thank you to the staff for their considerate service. Looking forward to seeing you next time!

The Uyghur dance in the small square in the evening is very exciting! Fourth, the hotel is very cost-effective. The rooms are as clean and hygienic as the pictures online, and the price is affordable. The rooftop swimming pool is my children‚Äôs favorite! Fifth, the most important thing is the hotel's service! I must give a five-star review. The thoughtful and meticulous care from the hotel Xiaoya made me not want to go to other hotels, so I continued to stay every dayüòÑ Room changes, room upgrades, daily necessities, and considerate greetings were very warm! Our children had homework in online classes and had no place to print it out. We were so anxious that Xiaoya printed it for us. We would like to express our deepest gratitude!

Special mention to my customer service housekeeper Xiao Ji. She called her before check-in to ask about the check-in time. She also thoughtfully prepared fruits, bath balls and other supplies for the bath. During the stay, she asked us every day what we needed to add and told her at any time. She was very serious.

When I came to the hotel, they upgraded me to a king bed with a sea view. When I entered the room, I found that the bed in the king room was a bit small and a bit cramped to sleep with a child. I asked to change it back to the twin room with a garden view that I had booked. But the hotel helped me change to a sea view twin room on the 15th floor. The 15th floor has a wide view and the children are very happy. Thank you very much! In the end, the checkout was delayed for an hour, and the housekeeper Xiaoya immediately helped to delay the checkout. There were other requests I made, but the housekeeper Xiaoya helped me one by one. Thank you to the housekeeper Xiaoya! ! !

I went to see the infinity swimming pool on the roof of the hotel in the evening. The scenery was really beautiful. The children had a cold, and the wind in the evening was cold and the water was cold, so there was no water. But sitting by the pool listening to songs, surrounded by the soft lights next to the pool, and looking out at the sea through the infinity pool, it felt so good that the children took a long time to go downstairs.

Compared with other hotels I've stayed in, I think the hotel's breakfast is quite good. It was almost 10:30 when we went there. It was supposed to be the lobby manager, a man in blue clothes, who kept helping us get our meals. We‚Äôre afraid we won‚Äôt have enough when it‚Äôs time to put away the food. It‚Äôs really good! ! ! Other staff members are also very polite and courteous.

I booked this hotel for the convenience of getting to the airport, but I felt very comfortable on the last day.

A small suggestion is that I hope the children's paradise can provide disposable socks like other hotels. The lighting in the hotel is a bit dim, not suitable for children to read at night.

But overall, very satisfied!

It feels like the soil will blow down when the air conditioner is on in the room. There were still food residues on the table and when I wiped them with a white towel, they got stuck to the towel. The sealing *****s on the side of the sink were black and moldy, and the shower switch was scratched and splashed with water. There was a stain on the sofa. The trash can is as dirty as an outdoor trash can. Simply speechless. There is no denying that the rooftop swimming pool is very beautiful, but it is very windy on the rooftop. There has been no sunshine for the past two days and the water has been very cold and I did not go into the water. I will never choose this place again. If the hotel management can read the reviews, they should really improve the cleanliness. The most basic things are not done well.

msg:Location: About 10 minutes' drive from Phoenix Airport, super convenient.
Opposite the hotel is a public beach, less than 5 minutes' walk away. The coconut tree promenade is also on the beach, a popular spot for internet celebrities to check in.
Hotel facilities and appearance: The infinity swimming pool in the sky that can be seen from the plane, and the Internet celebrity transparent swimming pool on the top floor can be used unlimitedly, and the scenery is super good. The entire hotel is like a hanging garden. The balconies and corridors are filled with green plants and red flowers, which is very beautiful. There is a scheduled bubble bath activity in the afternoon, which both children and adults love. The indoor heated swimming pool is also good. In short, if you like to play in the water, there is always a seaside, indoor swimming pool, outdoor swimming pool, rooftop infinity swimming pool, and transparent swimming pool that is suitable for you.
Service: Butler Xiao Nie provided considerate service and upgraded our family to a sea view room, facing the sea with spring flowers blooming. They arranged a late check-out for us the next day, so that we wouldn't be so rushed during our trip. We took the kids for another swim, which was a blast. Thank you Xiao Nie, I have never met you but you are so meticulous.
Meal: We included breakfast, which was served before about 10 o'clock. There were many kinds. Then for dinner, you can choose to eat in the hotel or nearby. You don‚Äôt want to call a taxi to eat nearby.

msg:I was quite anxious when I made the reservation, fearing that if I didn‚Äôt choose the hotel well, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to have fun. Since there are no children, there is no need for parent-child activities. I chose this hotel because of the charm of the infinity pool on the top floor. Let me talk about my experience during the four-day stay: 1. The service was very good: Because I checked in in the afternoon, the housekeeper Xiao Nie contacted me in the morning and asked if I had any special needs and whether the room needed special decoration. He was very enthusiastic and considerate. The service, including the entire stay, if you have any questions, she will reply in seconds, which shows that she is very responsible. The hotel's front desk, concierge, catering depar**ent, room aunts and even the staff who clean up the garden flowers and plants all provide very good services, with a natural sense of intimacy. 2. The design of the hotel is really great. The interior of the room, the exterior landscape, the rooftop swimming pool, etc. are all very exquisite. Although the hotel has been open for a few years, it is well maintained. The guest room elevator is also very fast, so you don't have to wait for a long time. You must go to the rooftop swimming pool, the view is amazing! 3. The location of the hotel is very good. You can go downstairs and cross the road to Coconut Dream Corridor. It has been cloudy and sometimes rainy these days, but it does not affect the beauty and momentum of the sea at all. It takes more than ten minutes to get to and from Phoenix Airport or Yiheng Night Market. A taxi costs more than ten yuan. It is not far from Hailv Duty Free City. There is a free shuttle bus to Haitang Bay Zhongwu, so it is very convenient to make a reservation. Finally, I would like to add a little suggestion. I haven‚Äôt seen jackfruit or durian for breakfast for four days, which is a bit disappointing. It would be perfect if the breakfast types could be changed every day! Overall, the hotel is very good and Sanya is very good. I will come again next time!

msg:Three years ago, Conifer Hotel's infinity pool, spacious and bright lobby, super artistic interior design, and bracelet-style key card were impressive. I chose to stay at Conifer Hotel again after three years, and I was a little disappointed. The hotel facilities were obviously aging due to the three-year epidemic, and there were many stains on the walls of the room. There is a musty smell, the humidity is very high, and the quilt is also damp to the touch. Even the spare quilt in the compression bag has a heavy musty smell and cannot be used. The sliding rail of the bathroom door is also inflexible. Although there are satellite channels for TV dramas, they cannot be watched, and only ordinary TV can be watched. There is also a heavy smell of oily smoke in the hotel's public elevator. When I first checked in, I found that one of the sleeves of the bathrobe in the room was still wet, and there was an unpacked comb in the box next to the basin where the toiletries were placed. I feel that this year's healthy year is no longer the healthy year of three years ago. However, the infinity pool on the top floor is still amazing, and the pool water is also very clean. There are still beautiful ladies who come to check in. Three years ago, Sanya Bay was still being repaired, and now it has a new look. Morning jogs and walks are very pleasant.
The service of the butler Xiaonie is still very good, and all questions can be answered and resolved in a timely manner. The customer service manager also called to help coordinate and deal with it in time. I hope that Conifer Hotel can further repair the facilities, and the high-quality service and high-quality hardware will definitely attract more guests.

In addition, we did not encounter the musty smell mentioned in other reviews, and the baby also said there was no smell. All in all, the hotel is very cost-effective. Next time here in Sanya Bay, I will choose Kangnian.

msg:The five stars are only for the hospitality of the butler who connected us. He was the first to help us when we needed anything. I have to complain about the hotel. It is really not worth the price. The whole room is full of musty smell as soon as you enter the door. It is really not exaggerated. It is a very pungent musty smell that can't be dispersed. I can understand that it is close to the seaside, but other hotels we stayed in did not smell so bad. The quilt really felt wet. Shouldn't the dehumidification and other small details of the hotel at this price be well done? There is also the Internet celebrity infinity bath. I can only say that ** has been promoted too much. Don't have too high expectations, or you may think it is okay. The advantage is that the beach is just across the road downstairs, which is relatively close to the sea. I personally think it is not worth the price at all. It is for reference only.

The balcony bathtub is the highlight. Although it is outdoors, it is safe. You cannot see the bathtub from any angle outside the hotel. Needless to say, the infinity swimming pool on the roof is beautiful, the film is produced, and the sightseeing is invincible. The roof overlooks the entire Sanya Bay during the day, and the lights are bright at night. There are singers singing in the bar. The a**osphere is very good.

It should be relatively new at that time, and the impression is okay, but this time the smell is particularly strong, with a strong musty smell. The seaside is really too humid, so I lived on a lower floor It was too much for one night, and the taste improved slightly after changing to a higher floor for a few nights.
Ms. Linda at the front desk is kind and she gave her children breakfast. On the first day, it was cloudy and the water was quite cold, but after the sun came out, it was hot again. I ate the best ice cream in Sanya to cool off. The quality of the takeaway was excellent Not bad, the rest is quite pleasant, every day the minibar will replenish drinks, on the third day a young lady came to inquire about the service, and gave a welcome fruit.
I especially like the green plum for breakfast. It is very sweet. The breakfast powder and porridge are freshly cooked. It‚Äôs just that the baby sleeps too late and doesn‚Äôt cooperate. Every time I go there at 10:30
Very close to the airport, about 20 yuan for rent, I haven‚Äôt been out much in the hotel all the time, the main thing is to lie flat and not move around

The cleaning lady kept the room very wet and sealed it all afternoon without opening the windows or turning on the air conditioner. At night, the children and our whole family were so itchy that we couldn't help it. The children's hands were bitten so much that they became swollen. I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya, including the Ritz-Carlton, Sun Bay Park Hyatt, Capella, and Conian.

msg:Excellent hotel, the swimming pool is very beautiful, and there is a transparent swimming pool. If the weather is good, the film will be so beautiful. It is very close to the beach and can enjoy the sunset of the Coconut Dream Corridor. The hotel service is also very good. This time it is a real trip after the epidemic. I am so lucky to choose this hotel. The hotel housekeeper, Ms. "Xinyan", provides excellent service. The room type is upgraded for free. All kinds of questions are answered in a timely manner and handled well. It's very good, and I'm going to bring my family to experience it again during the winter vacation.

After taking a shower, the whole bathroom was full of water. The staff couldn't fix it, so it had to be repaired the next day. The most annoying thing was that after 11:00 p.m. when we were all asleep, they called to change rooms for us. The phone rang so harshly that it scared me so much that I couldn't sleep well all night. The temperature of the air conditioner cannot be adjusted, it is only 22 degrees. The child's nose is a little stuffy when he wakes up in the morning. The highlight of the hotel is the infinity pool on the rooftop. Not happy with how the staff handled this matter.

On the first night of our stay, the room was 1309. The view and scenery from the balcony were very good, but the room was rather humid. Since it was late, we did not ask to change the room.

I am also very satisfied with Kangnian's hardware facilities and software services! In the morning, the variety is rich and delicious, and the rooftop infinity pool is the same color as Tianhaichi, and the scenery is unlimited! Check out and get back in seconds!

You can also take a break, drink and chat. The design of the hotel's hollow corridor is also very distinctive. The quality of breakfast is very rich, especially Hainan specialties are prepared at various stalls. It is too late to experience the indoor swimming pool and the hotel restaurant. The staff in all positions of the hotel are online, especially the housekeeper Xiao Nie who responds to requests and likes it. The occupancy rate is very high. There are families, couples, and elderly parents who come to experience it. It is worth a second visit.

msg:It's the first time to write an evaluation, let's write about the real experience
Arrive at Sanya Phoenix Airport at 4:00 p.m. Pick-up booked on Ctrip
The driver is very good, the pick-up location is clearly described, very convenient
Take the initiative to take the luggage, new energy car, not to mention whether the car is good or bad, it is very clean
The driver took the initiative to introduce the customs of Sanya and introduce the pit avoidance guide
It's nice to park directly at the hotel lobby
Start describing the hotel
Although it is not a very expensive hotel, the doorman directly takes the luggage from the driver's hand
The check-in was very smooth, the hotel housekeeper, Manager Xiao Nie (a pretty girl)
Very thoughtful introduction to our available services and location in the hotel. There is still time. At this time, the doorman accompanied me all the way. I booked the room a week in advance
The reason for the low season is to book in advance and the hotel has upgraded to a boutique sea view room on the 13th floor
I really didn't expect Sanya to be so involved
You can see in the picture, although it is not a full frontal sea view, but the 100¬∞C sea view is already very beautiful
The room is spacious and the facilities are relatively complete
The sensor light in the cloakroom is very convenient
The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the design of the two doors in the bathroom is very considerate. The two 1.35-meter single beds are not too small
If you are a little thinner, you can sleep with a little friend
The room is equipped with semi-smart, which is very considerate
Xiaodu can control smart lights, turn on and off the TV, and individually controlled electric curtains. This price is really worth it
There are fruits at the door
The bed is decorated with couple swans, it still looks very comfortable
Going out to the balcony, there is an open-air bathtub, which is a big bathtub. I soaked in it at 1.8, and the window sill was covered with unknown red flowers and green leaves, completely covering the privacy. Back in the room, there was ice cola, Wanglaoji unlimited mineral water, sour juice and coconut juice in the small refrigerator. Snack kids are very happy
 My family is very satisfied with the room. Some small details are not very good, but there is absolutely no need to lose points
What needs to be introduced are the two swimming pools on the R floor (top floor)
One is boundless and the other is transparent, whether it is night or day, it is very good
Be sure to bring a good quality waterproof mobile phone bag. The pictures taken underwater are absolutely amazing.
Couples can be romantic on the R floor. There is a children's play area in the garden with children. Although it is not big, it is still there. There is an indoor swimming pool on the first floor.
There is also a children's playground, trampoline, ocean ball, and interactive games on the third floor
Video games (two driving game consoles and four TVs playing handle games)
But there are a lot of handmade games for children every day. There are also small gifts. The children's arrangements are also very full.
Have you never talked about eating üòú
I forgot to choose breakfast when I booked the room
If you can, you must choose the one with breakfast, which is better than takeaway. I see that others have eaten it, and it is not worth it to set 168 per person.
The hotel has free self-service. I also read it. So-so. I don‚Äôt recommend it. You can try it for convenience. The product is okay. It‚Äôs better than the nearby food stalls.
I rented an electric car for 60 yuan (there is a deposit of 200 yuan in front of the Harbin Hotel. All the mobile phone payment is optimistic about whether the QR code is the original car. The one that has been replaced is a lie. I rent it for 24 hours with two helmets and a charger. When riding, the car is fully charged and can ride for 60 kilometers, which should be enough for one day. The main thing is that I don‚Äôt know where to charge. deposit returned)
I made a big circle around the neighborhood and navigated to Huihui Community. There is a market nearby. Fruits are very cheap. I bought a lot of fruits for 100 yuan. Watermelons cost 3 yuan a catty, lychees 7 yuan, lychee king 15 yuan, mangoes and bananas are very cheap.
There is a sugar shop opposite the market. The shop is not big. The place where locals drink sugar water. The food is delicious. Tremella and lotus seed soup and black jelly are recommended.
Huihui community is mainly populated by people from Ningxia, Qinghai and Xinjiang. Beef, mutton, ramen, and barbecue are all good. It is about 9 kilometers away from the hotel. It is very convenient to have a car.
The location of Kangnian is the best and very reliable. It is very close to the sea and a small road. It takes three minutes to get to the room. There are basically not many mosquitoes in the hotel, but you still need to take precautions outside. I bought mosquito repellent with a content of 15. oh 
in conclusion 
Conifer Hotel near Sanya Bay is the most reliable
Room, service, package, location are all great value
Talking about playing in Sanya
I only played Sanya Bay and Dadonghai. I didn‚Äôt go to Wuzhizhou, Haitang Bay, but I also learned about it.
With children, Sanya Bay can eat and stay, and takeaway is very convenient
Sanya Bay is also the place to play in the sea. The sea is clean, the location of the bay is good, the sandy beach is fine, there are not many people, there are planes, yachts, and speedboats, and there are not many swimmers. The overall consumption is mid-range
Dadonghai is cheap to live, cheap to eat, the environment is so-so, the sea is so-so, the beach is so-so, the waves are big, and the bay is small. I don‚Äôt recommend coming here, there‚Äôs nothing to do
The big pineapple is a shopping mall, except for coconut chicken, trough meal vinegar, and dustpan rice.
Refreshing and refreshing
There is a shop next to the Kangnian Hotel for 28 yuan, which is okay
 
This trip to Sanya subverted the previous impression of Hainan
Not bad, you must check in every time at Conifer Hotel
 
recommended like it

In the middle, I also asked intimately if there was any need for supplementary items, which was really considerate. The hotel's infinity pool is simply invincible! The photos are very good.

The design of the school of fish opposite the check-in at the front desk is also very a**ospheric. The flight was late that night, and the receptionist at the front desk was still enthusiastic After receiving us, Xinyan, the housekeeper of the hotel, called us the next day and asked if we were satisfied with the room we stayed in, whether there was any need to add drinks and supplies, and whether the room should be cleaned. She really cared and gave her She also dealt with some problems for us. In the afternoon, Xiao Weng, the guest manager of the hotel, called us and made another return visit and we solved the problems.

The first time we arrived at the hotel, the waiter brother helped us to carry our luggage to the room. The housekeeper at the front desk, Xiao Weng, was also very considerate. She helped us choose a room with a sea view, and two fruit plates were delivered to the room. The house is tidy and clean. I stayed for 4 days and 3 nights. It was cleaned up every day. I will make up the used ones. There is also a mini refrigerator with Coke, coconut milk, Wanglaoji, and coconut flakes, all of which are included in it. I will also ask If you like any flavor, please help to make it up, no need to charge separately. Ladies' bathrobes are relatively small, so contact Sister Xiaoweng directly for a looser one, which is comfortable on the upper body. There are 200 spa vouchers. My husband and I have done 3 items, and the consumption is about 1500. The overall is okay. It is very convenient to take the free duty-free shop bus, just wait on the bus, both of which need to be called one day in advance to make an appoin**ent.

The small bar and tent on the top floor at night are very a**ospheric. The hotel service is very good, especially the housekeeper, Ms. Xinyan, who has been actively giving Help and provide supplies. The room type is also facing the sea, with a wide view. It is very close to the beach and Coconut Dream Corridor. It is a hotel worth staying in

When we got off the bus, there was a waiter to help us with our luggage. The warm and generous service of Xiaopu at the front desk made us instantly feel the heat of Sanya. In order to let us see a wider sea view, Xiaopu helped us upgrade the deluxe sea view room to a panoramic view Honeymoon room with sea view! The food in the restaurant is also very good, and the breakfast is very rich. The infinity swimming pool on the top floor is a place for Internet celebrities to check in, but unfortunately I can't swim. It is very close to the sea, just across the road, lazy people can see the sea even in the room. Looking forward to seeing you next time.

The reason may be that the floor is relatively low, the room is relatively humid, and the cushions have a musty smell, but the front desk quickly changed them, and I took a dehumidifier. The location of the hotel is right by the sea and very close to the airport. It is suitable for the last few days to catch a flight. The Internet celebrity swimming pool is also quite distinctive, and you can see the panoramic view of Sanya Bay.

Then find a hotel to upgrade the room and upgrade to the 13th floor. The scenery is good, but the defect is that the room smells musty.

The hotel service is good, whether it is communication to change rooms or free water at the mini bar, it is just fine. Every service staff encountered on the road will take the initiative to say hello.
PS All male waiters in the hotel don't smoke... It's so hard to borrow a fire...

The infinity swimming pool on the top floor has a beautiful view, but it is very windy on the roof and keep warm. There will be hot towels after swimming, which is pretty good. The high platform swimming pool... I was afraid that I would fall after swimming once hahahahahahaha. Especially when I swim there with glasses, I am afraid of heights and choking water. Attention people with fear of heights.

Not to mention the hotel facilities, very good, and there is an infinity pool. The key is that everyone feels very kind, friendly, serious and responsible. Ms. Xinyan, the housekeeper, responded very promptly and was active in her work; Ms. Weng Meiqing at the front desk also thoughtfully upgraded the guest room; Mr. Wu Tianjing, the room attendant, is also very grateful. The child was sick and vomited after taking medicine, and the little brother was busy. After changing the sheets, contact the staff to unclog the basin. I am really lucky to be able to stay at the Conifer Hotel. Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely stay here again because of the service of these little brothers and sisters.

First of all, the location is in Sanya Bay, 10 minutes' drive from the airport, avoiding the fatigue of boats and cars. The overall area of the hotel is small, and the garden is small, but the infinity pool and hanging pool are enough to make up for this shortcoming, because the hotel gave away items before. I have stepped on thunder before, and this time I have a skeptical attitude towards the gift items. I didn‚Äôt expect the gift items from Conifer Hotel to be very real. Because I don‚Äôt like taking pictures, I didn‚Äôt experience the gifted travel photos. The essential oil massage and meal coupons are really genuine. No There is no fraud in the promotion, the service of the hotel is also very good, and the service of the butler Xinyan is also very considerate. The cafeteria of the hotel is highly recommended. I am very satisfied with the environment and meals

The check-in was very smooth. I arrived at the hotel earlier. Since the cleaning work was not over, I specially provided coffee in the lobby dining bar for free. It's really enjoyable to drink coffee while blowing the sea breeze~
We highly recommend the infinity pool on the R floor. It‚Äôs super popular and suitable for taking pictures. It‚Äôs the first time I found out that I can spend a whole afternoon in the hotel.
The hotel's meals are also very tasteful, and the breakfast variety is also very rich. Whether it's the front desk reception or the room service, they are very considerate, and they even gave me a bath ball~
In general, for tourists who like to take pictures, check in, and enjoy services, they will definitely not regret choosing Conifer Hotel~

The air conditioner was still not cooling after the maintenance. The hotel immediately arranged a new room for us and upgraded the room type. The efficiency was very high!
The basic facilities in the room are all good, but it's a pity that it's a bit noisy during the day because it's close to the road and there's construction on the opposite side~
The internet-famous rooftop infinity pool really wants to experience it, but because it is completely open-air and not covered by the sun, it is quite sunny under the sun, and more people come to take pictures and leave... I hope it can improve~
The hotel's breakfast buffet is not rich in variety, but the quality is acceptable, and I will come again if I have the opportunity! üòä

msg:I was in a hurry and even booked a hotel. I didn‚Äôt see that Kang Nian was not in Haitang. I searched üç† and reviews when I was about to leave. I saw that everyone was unanimously praised and I was looking forward to it. The experience can be said to be very poor. The third place is to shout at the guests!
1‚É£Ô∏èFirst of all, there is a square downstairs by the sea. Aunts are dancing and singing in the square from morning to night. It is so hot from morning to night...it is really noisy.
	
2‚É£Ô∏èThe hygienic situation is worrying: I booked a sea view twin bed with my sister (this room type is only on the 6th-8th floor). At the beginning, the 6th floor was arranged.
When I checked into the room on the 6th floor, I found a pool of hair on the ground. At first I thought it was an isolated phenomenon, but after changing rooms, I realized that the hygiene problem was not an isolated phenomenon. The sand and dust are obvious when you step on the ground with bare feet.
The view from the room on the 8th floor is not very good. Overall, the floors are short. If you want a high floor, pay attention to choosing a room type or other hotels. After moving to the 8th floor, the bathroom leaked at first, and then I found hair on the bathroom floor drain and the wall! ! The guest room came to clean again, and this time an aunt from the Northeast came. She was wearing shoes, and she stepped on the floor mat and the floor... Then she sent 2 plates of fruit as compensation (an apple, a small bunch of grapes, a few sugared oranges )[Petrochemical R][Petrochemical R][Petrochemical R] Then my sister was allergic to the room on the 6th floor, and I was severely allergic to the 8th floor. .
	
üí¢üí¢3‚É£Ô∏èSuper invincible and speechless is the restaurant, the window of roast pork rice noodles for breakfast, because I, another female customer, and my sister, the three of us went to his window to order noodles, and we didn‚Äôt order them all at once. , he yelled directly: Can you all finish talking at once! [Petrochemical R][Petrochemical R][Petrochemical R] There were ten million question marks on the spot, asking him what are you doing? What's your attitude? Then I stopped talking, threw away the bowls, took photos and complained to the room manager, and then the person in charge came over and said to deliver coconut milk, we didn't accept it, it was too exaggerated, anyway, luxury hotel, this service attitude, I really appreciate it Vision, no accidents, it is impossible to stay in Kangnian again, I don‚Äôt know how Ctrip‚Äôs score of 4.8 comes from...
4‚É£Ô∏èThe location is in Sanya Bay. Apart from being close to the airport and West Island, it is not convenient to go to many places. Almost all the popular places on the Internet are not close. I drive 4 hours back and forth every day to make a base... Last time I thought it was inconvenient to live in Haitang, Sanya Bay More inconvenient, choose carefully.

I have lived in Sanya for 3 times in Kangnian, I still like it better, and I will choose Kangnian again next time~
Oh, the only thing I'm not particularly satisfied with is the photo shoot. The photographer's attitude is not very good. The agreed time has not arrived. I waited for him for a long time. After he came, the kid was too young and didn't cooperate very much. He said fiercely about the shooting time 20 minutes, only 10 minutes of shooting time left. . .
emmmmm...Anyway, it's a gift, and it's normal to have a bad attitude towards free things.

msg:I have been to Sanya N many times, and it is the first time to stay in Kangnian. As an online celebrity hotel, the facilities, catering, rooms, and scenery are all right. The price is two thousand and one night. Although it is expensive at this time, it is the same in Sanya as a whole. If you choose Soaking in a hotel is still a good choice. The weather in Sanya is cold now. Only at noon is the time to play in the water, but it is not open at noon. This needs to be improved. It really takes courage to go into the water when there is no sun, especially in his swimming pool On the top floor, the wind is quite strong, even colder! The breakfast is quite satisfactory, there are not many highlights! I booked a double bed room with sea view, on the seventh floor. Although it is facing the sea, but the height is low, and there are big pillars in front, the experience is a bit poor! In fact, considering the cost-effectiveness, there is really no need to choose a sea view room when staying in various hotels in Sanya. During the day, the hotel also has a public area with a higher view of the sea. Who can always watch the sea from the balcony! The view of the sea from the top floor of Kangnian is very good! In addition, you need to swipe your hand to go to the top floor. Tourists who don't live here and want to ********** for free will definitely have no chance! There is a big gap between the welcome fruit and Holiday Inn Sanya Bay. Holiday Inn offers a lot of fruit, as well as afternoon tea and desserts. The room rate in Kangnian is twice that of Holiday Inn. The gap is a bit big! Xinyan, the guest service director, is very nice, and she sent extra drinks! But to be honest, Kang Nian is good overall and worthy of his family's rating, but I hope that the praise is not based on guest service and communication with guests. There are some details that need to be paid attention to. For example, the luggage service only goes to the front desk, what about the guest room? Shouldn't it be more proactive? The floor drain in the bathroom is clogged, and it's almost turning into a bathtub. Because the video is less than five seconds long, I can't upload it. I uploaded a photo to check it out! Of course, these are all details, and it does not mean that the year of health is not good! Just a real review!

msg:Sanya Conifer Hotel gave us a surprise. The infinity swimming pool, which is popular on the rooftop, also has a cantilever swimming pool, an outdoor children's swimming pool and an indoor heated swimming pool. Soaking in a hotel is an absolute advantage. Across the road is the beach, digging sand and playing with sea water, time is easy to pass. The nearby transportation is also very convenient. It takes ten minutes to go to Phoenix Airport, there are bus and sightseeing stations to West Island and Tianya Haijiao, and there are Northeast restaurants and seafood stalls about 600 meters away from Haiyun Hotel. We stayed in Kangnian for four nights. The account manager, Xinyan, was very enthusiastic and provided free-flow drinking service from the mini water bar. In the case of tight housing availability during the peak tourist season, she was considerate enough to apply for late check-out for me. This is the kind of home away from home. It makes me want to recommend it to all friends who come to Sanya, and I look forward to continuing to experience high-quality services when staying in the coming year!

Disadvantages: 1. Critical noise. 2. The hardware facilities refer to the upgraded version of Home Inn. 3. Insufficient children's supplies, such as no children's slippers.

The questions I consulted have always been resolved for me very seriously, and during the stay, I have always had the real-time experience of actively caring about the guests. I explained that I was going to visit the West Island tomorrow, and Director Wang sent me the travel strategy of the West Island in advance, which is very good.
Let's evaluate Conifer Hotel below. In terms of price, if you stay in Kangnian for 2 nights with breakfast, if you stay at MGM for 3 nights with breakfast, you won‚Äôt be fooled by this experience. In terms of unit price, MGM is cheaper than Connian (Double Eleven MGM has activities), and the balcony breakfast and poolside barbecue dinner in the MGM package are all very good! MGM also has hotel swimming pools and many other entertainment and hotel private beaches.
There is no nucleic acid in the Kangnian Hotel. We all take a taxi to do nucleic acid. Although it is not far away, the experience is very poor; it is a common problem that the TV cannot be casted (MGM is also); the quality of the welcome fruit is average (the taste of an orange is not good ); the shower head in the shower room can‚Äôt be worse (if it looks like it‚Äôs not broken, it‚Äôs better not to have); one more thing, my room, when you close the door when you go out, if you think the door will close automatically, it can‚Äôt actually be locked So much so that I closed the door manually when I went out later.
I was also recommended by a friend of Kangnian, but after experiencing it myself, there is no harm without comparison, and I feel that it is not as good as MGM in Yalong Bay.

Take it away, maybe the shooting time is 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the sun is relatively strong, the photographer is a little hot, it will be finished in 5 minutes, this time there is applause, this is efficiency, I don't want to go out at night, just eat on the 16th floor of the hotel, good guy, I started to feel sick after using it. First, I didn't order takeout. Second, I didn't leave the hotel or go out to eat. I didn't think it was anything. I just reported the situation.

Miss Xinyan at the front desk helped me to upgrade to a room with a full sea view. However, I finally asked to stay in the room I originally booked, which may have been seen in Yalong Bay. Three days of full sea view, so in Kangnian Hotel, I think the sea view with the bay line is more beautiful than the full sea view room. The sea view of the hotel is nothing to say, the field of vision is very wide, and the seaside is very lively at night. There are also trendy people. Miss Xinyan's service is very attentive. She adjusts the room type in time, and will often come to ask about service needs. There are free drinks in the room. Thumbs up for the service!
Like the hotel's breakfast, the powder inside is very delicious, and the breakfast at Hilton Bialong Bay tastes much better. It's an unexpected harvest. The soup base of waxed duck powder is delicious, and I ate two bowls!
Not to mention the swimming pool on the top floor, it is very comfortable to watch the sea view from the infinity pool. Although it is cloudy, the water is not cold, and the water in the swimming pool next door is still heated, so you can swim with confidence.
Compliment the little brother in the concierge depar**ent, I left my luggage at the Hilton, and the little brother received it and delivered it to our room in time.
Needless to say, it's close to the airport, and it's very cost-effective

Due to the double bed room set by hand slip, little sister Nie is very enthusiastic to help us find staff to make beds, and also sent the places to eat, drink, play and do nucleic acid around through WeChat at the first time, which is very considerate, and the small gift for my wife also makes We felt the enthusiasm of Sanya for the first time. The rooftop swimming pool is of course not to be missed, but the day we stayed was not beautiful, and we took a few photos and shared them with friends.

msg:Book the most basic garden view room, thanks to the housekeeper Xinyan, the room type is upgraded to the side sea view on the higher floor.

The hotel itself is full of Southeast Asian a**osphere, the building is open, and the sea breeze can pass through the corridor. The infinity pool on the roof is very impressive, and the transparent cliff swimming pool makes people feel like flying, which is a must-experience content.

The hotel itself is relatively new, the room facilities are perfect, the bathtub is also very comfortable, providing bubble balls and bathtub sets. However, the TV cannot be projected, and friends in need should bring the hdmi output cable.

The location is super close to the airport, and a taxi is 10 yuan. Airplanes are often seen above the rooftop pool.

In terms of service, welcome fruits and minibar snacks and drinks are provided. The housekeeper will take the initiative to inquire about the needs during the stay, and basically respond to any requests.

I have no experience in breakfast. The coconut chicken hot pot for dinner was poured in with two coconuts. It is reasonable to say that it is original, but the taste is still average. The restaurant may not have music because there are few people, and the dining a**osphere is a bit weird.

The travel shoot is in cooperation with the hotel. There are 9 free pictures for color correction. It is estimated that there is no expectation of the customer to upgrade the package, so only 37 pictures were taken as candidates, and the pictures are relatively general. In contrast, the travel shoots at Park Hyatt took a lot of care, and took more than 100 photos on the premise that there were only 5 free photos, and when I saw the finished product, I decided to upgrade the package.

In general, this hotel in Sanya is not the first echelon, but the price is very high. The integrated rooftop Internet celebrity swimming pool and the location that is very close to the airport are very suitable as a stop for entering and leaving Sanya, and will come back if there is a chance.

msg:What a thrilling trip‚úàÔ∏èüòÇ, Sanya announced static management within a few days after returning, but it was really worth the trip, especially staying at the Kangnian Hotel üè®... I must give a big thumbs upüëç.

        The hotel is located in Tianya District. There is no word on the location. The sea is across the road. There is not much to say about the scenery. The two words are charming. The lobby is spacious, transparent and clean (pictured below).

         We booked a two-bedroom duplex suite with sea view (pictured below) on the 16th floor, with one bedroom on each of the upper and lower floors, each with a large independent bathroom, and all of them are king-size beds, all facing the sea, two large and one small sleep properly No problem, there is also a super large balcony in the atrium on the first floor, where you can enjoy afternoon tea, snack and chat. I personally recommend this suite for family trips. There is absolutely no problem with 4 or 5 people. When I booked this room, a seafood buffet dinner was provided every night. The price was 4000 a night. Son, open the door is the sea, and you want to play motorboats üõ•Ô∏è is opposite, so it is very advantageous for Ma Ma who just want to take the baby to the hotel and don't want to go out and go too far... ü§©

       Next is the rooftop swimming pool that everyone is concerned about. Frankly speaking, it is really good, not worse than Jinsha at all, and the water quality is also cleaner than Jinsha! The swimming pool is located on the R floor of the hotel. You can enter and exit by swiping the room card. There are two swimming pools on the top. The more attractive one on the right is the suspended swimming pool. The area is not large. You can clearly feel it, stepping on the glass, my little girl said that she felt like a flying fish inside, hahaha! There are more people in the legendary "Kang Nian Yi Bend". This swimming pool has a C-position angle, which is especially suitable for taking picturesüì∑. Anyway, I think it is comparable to Poly Rose and both have advantages. If you want a more cost-effective one, Kang Nian is very suitable!

        PS:
        The hotel lobby is located on the third floor, breakfast is served on the second floor, and seafood buffet dinner is on the 16th floor. I forgot the specific restaurant. There is no nucleic acid in the hotel, but you can register to make an appoin**ent for door-to-door service 68/person, and the place to do it is also in the breakfast restaurant on the second floor. On the square next to it; the service is not bad, the problem of waiting for the room was a little unpleasant before, and it was solved properly later, which is still very good, but my personal recommendation is to check in after three o'clock, especially this suite. It is said that there are only one or two rooms. It's very slow to clean... In short, this hotel is still worth staying at, and will come again next timeüëç...ü•≥ü§©

msg:In Sanya Bay, this hotel is really good, tell me about my stay experience this time

Let me talk about it first. We stayed for two consecutive nights from 28 to 29. It was very late to arrive at the hotel on the 28th. After checking in, there was a little episode. Later, Ms. Zhao Yihong, the duty manager, helped to solve the problem smoothly, both in the way of handling the problem and in the attitude. It's heart-warming, and the details are well grasped. I really think about the problem from the perspective of the guests. I really thank Manager Zhao for making us have a very pleasant stay experience.

advantage
1 The location of the hotel is good, the sea view room has a good view, the room is large, the sanitation is good, and there are two ways to cool down the heat: air conditioner and ceiling fan.

2 The hotel has an infinity swimming pool and a transparent swimming pool on the top floor. The infinity swimming pool has a good photo effect. You can almost see the entire Sanya Bay. I did not experience the transparent swimming pool.

3 The overall service attitude of the hotel is very good. The service staff will take the initiative to say hello. The concierge in the lobby will take the initiative to ask if you need help. The guest room responds very quickly. I needed a clothes rack last night. I thought the guest room would give a simple one. I thought that my aunt moved directly to a large one, which is also equipped with 6 clothes hangers, and the details are in place!


shortcoming
1 The decoration of the hotel is a bit old. Although the room is clean and hygienic, the style is a bit Atour, and there will be a damp smell.

2 There are few swimming pools in the downstairs area of the hotel, and they are all closed. The types of breakfast are average. There is no seat when there are a lot of diners. This should limit the flow when entering the restaurant, and let in when there is space, otherwise you will find a place with a plate. feeling really bad.

3 The communication between individual staff members of the hotel is purely a problem. On the evening of the 28th, the male front desk kept talking about the hotel room nervously, arranged a defective room for the guest, and after requesting to change the room, he refused to look at the room first on the grounds that the room was nervous, and agreed to change the room. After the room, he asked us to pack up our luggage, take it downstairs, and then arrange for bed-sharing. I don't know what his mentality is. Although he is polite on the surface, there is nothing in his words to consider the guests. He always says "" Our hotel has been booked a lot recently, and the room is very tight." What does it have to do with me if you are nervous? Fortunately, manager Zhao Yihong took over in time and gave me a good check-in experience.

Items are readily available, and in the Kang Nian, there is almost no need to prepare anything other than clothes.
1. Drinks and snacks: Welcome fruits, drinks cola, coconut juice, capers juice, Wanglaoji and potato chips are ready in the room after check-in. The most important thing is that in addition to preparing small bottles of mineral water at room temperature, a large bucket of Nongfu Spring is also prepared, and a few bottles of refrigerated water are also placed in the small refrigerator, which is really caring.
2. Children's products: Children's special skin care cleaning kit, orange-flavored children like it very much. There are bath tubs for children, children's slippers, bath towels, bathrobes, bubble balls, and beach toys, so there is no need to prepare anything extra.
3. Hotel facilities: The parent-child suite is set, and the room is equipped with a fan, which is suitable for people who do not like air conditioning.
Double bathtubs, balconies, one in each room, equipped with a disposable bath bag, the bath is very good.
The children's playground on the third floor and the infinity pool on the top floor are all free to fetch water, and no additional preparation is required. In addition, the toilet in the children's area has a children's toilet, which is intimate.
4. Hotel Activities: All activities are free! Children participating in the activity can also exchange bubble machines, little yellow duck dolls, and little yellow duck cakes directly at the children's playground. The children's swimming area shakes the boat for free.

5. Hotel services: Check-in at the front desk is very fast, and inquiries are answered immediately. Unlike a certain meal, the front desk has seven or eight people, but the processing speed is not good. If you ask a question, you need to ask other people to get an answer.
After checking in, the customer relationship manager Xiao Nie informed the surrounding places to eat, drink and play and hotel facilities and services, which was very considerate.
The welcome brothers cooperated with each other. We were two mothers who brought their children to play together. As soon as the car arrived at the lobby, the two brothers immediately helped with the luggage. They moved quickly. Before leaving, the lovely security uncle also helped carry the luggage together, and let us take care of the children.
5. Swimming pool: You cannot swim in laps in the infinity and suspended swimming pools on the roof, but arm floats are prepared for free. The lowest point is 0.9 meters, and the lowest point is 1.4 meters. The kids had so much fun.
6. Seaside: I went to Haitang Bay last year, and this year I experienced Hayalong Bay and Sanya Bay. Maybe because of the typhoon, the sand in Yalong Bay is very rough. When I went to play, I caught up with the construction of the beach. It happened that the waves were also big, so I didn't feel how good the sea in Yalong Bay was. On the contrary, Sanya Bay was pleasantly surprised. The sand was very delicate, the waves were gentle, and it was easy to catch the sea. The picture below is our harvest in more than two hours.

7. Transportation: It is very close to the airport, more than ten minutes away, so avoid tossing.
8. Breakfast: As a northerner who doesn't like to eat powder, I ate it for two consecutive mornings. The bean curd brain is very recommended, and the day lily is marinated for three consecutive mornings.
Fried eggs can be made into candy hearts, fried, or made into egg pancakes. Just tell the chef how to eat them. Other noodles, beef noodles, fried buns, etc. are also very delicious.

The Internet celebrity swimming pool provided by the hotel is very good. The only thing I want to complain about is the hotel's breakfast and restaurant, which do not match the hotel's star rating. There are not many types of breakfast, and there is nothing delicious. The decoration environment of the restaurant is also very good. In general, the tables and chairs are very old. Breakfast is served until 10:30. At 10:30, there are still many customers eating in the restaurant, but the air conditioner is turned off. In the high temperature of Sanya, the restaurant does not turn on the air conditioner... Really Very speechless! Is this an explicit eviction order? Thinking of this restaurant, I probably won't stay here again.

The swimming pool on the top floor is really good, but it is too windy. The humidity in the room is relatively heavy, and the ground is easily damp, which is not encountered in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay. The hotel's front desk student Xiao Zhao deserves praise for his excellent service. The drinks in the waiting room were delivered, and there was fruit at check-in. The little brother in the concierge is also very nice, helping to deliver the luggage to the car in the ba*****t. Breakfast still needs to be improved. Like MGM and Shangri-La, the price is more than 1,600. There is indeed some gap in breakfast. But the overall is still satisfactory, it belongs to the Internet celebrity hotel, it is worth it for the two swimming pools on the top floor

When you arrive at the hotel, the room is not packed, so you can store your luggage first, and the butler will notify you when the room is ready to check in. When you arrive at the room, the luggage has already arrived in the room, so you don‚Äôt need to take it yourself.
The welcome fruit is delicious. There is a disposable bath mat in the room and a bath salt (the housekeeper will contact you if you think it is not enough)
I am very happy to upgrade the room type for free üòÅ, the balcony on the side of the sea view room faces the direction of the sunrise, the room will be more beautiful when the sunrise is in the morning.
Although it is close to the airport, the noise of the plane is very small, which will not affect the rest. The curtains are good for shading, and will not be blinded by the sunrise.
The swimming pool on the roof is very beautiful, the water in the transparent pool is constant temperature, and the other places are normal temperature.
The wristband door card is well received. Whether you are going out or swimming, you don‚Äôt have to worry about losing it. You can go to the roof, have breakfast, and open the room with a wristband. It is very convenient.

The receptionist was Chunlei, the beauty queen at the front desk, and the heart-warming service was thought of for us in every aspect! Knowing that I am easy to attract mosquitoes, I put a mosquito killer by my bed! When you enter the room and walk to the balcony, you can see the sea, and Sanya Bay is just across the road! It's very close and convenient to go anywhere! The most important thing is: the infinity pool on the roof makes me fall in love with swimming. Every night I go to the rooftop to blow the evening breeze and swim. It feels really good! Really love it! Breakfast is also very good! Breakfast time is also very considerate for guests ~ I stayed at Atlantis on the last night, and suddenly felt that the service of Kangnian was not as good!

Before I came here, I read a lot of bad reviews, and I was very nervous for a while, but after I came here, all these thoughts were dispelled, and I doubted whether those were malicious competition from peers. The infinity swimming pool is across the road from Haihong Square. It is one of the few very delicate beaches I have seen many times in Sanya. Although it is public, it is very popular! Very lively!
During the epidemic, the lobby manager Zhao Yihong warmly upgraded the room type for us. He also gave us a bath ball and a disposable covering film. It felt great. The doorman was running to greet us and get off the bus and help us carry our luggage. Took us to change rooms, forgot to see what the name was, but it was awesome!
In short, it was a pleasant hotel stay. Next time, I will bring the children with you. I hope there will not be too many people. During the epidemic, I feel that Kangnian's popularity is not bad, which is evident.

All in all, the experience of staying here is very good. I will continue to consider staying here next time I have the opportunity.

msg:Great reviews. After staying in Sanya for more than ten days, I feel that it is very important to come to the Sanya Resort Hotel. Booking a good hotel can increase the sense of experience and it is actually more economical to not go out of the hotel to play. It can be said that the Kangnian Hotel is not the most expensive but the experience is the best. I was very uneasy, I was afraid that they were all cheating the Internet celebrity hotel. The local taxi driver on the road gave a high evaluation, and said that it is the largest swimming pool in Sanya Bay, so I can rest assured. First, this hotel is very new, and I have stayed in star-rated but relatively old hotels. How should I put it, if the hotel is old, there is no way to have a very clean feeling, and there will always be a kind of discomfort. Second, the service, I can feel that the management of this hotel is very good, and the staff in all aspects have high professionalism, and this experience feels more comfortable and comfortable. Third, the facilities and design are very reasonable. The balcony has an oversized bathtub, which is really big, and you can take a bath just not to be seen from the outside, and the concealment is very good. The hotel also kindly sent a bath ball~ Fourth, the swimming pool is really big! There is a constant temperature swimming pool and an infinity swimming pool on the roof. Fifth, we will deliver potato chips and several delicious drinks every day. There are even air essential oils, mosquito coils, and other intimate little things in the room. You can find them just when you want to use them. . It's really very detailed~ Finally, you can see the sea from the bed, which is great!

There is a play space for babies on the third floor, and there are not many projects. Because the baby is a week, it is very suitable for him to play, build blocks, and play with ocean balls. The swimming pool is not constant temperature when we go, and the weather is cold outside, so we still have to choose a good time to go to Sanya.
The hotel rooms are relatively new and reasonably furnished, with children's toiletries and bathrobes.
The hotel spa is also worth a visit.

msg:A brief review of Sanya Conifer Hotel

1. Overview | Overview

I have always heard that Sanya Conifer Hotel is the best hotel in Sanya Bay, but after the epidemic, the price of this hotel has been more than 1,000 yuan all year round, so I have never come to check in. This time on Double 12, I suddenly saw this hotel for sale on OTA. The room voucher was only over 700 per night in the off-season, and it was also the same price during Christmas, so I decisively placed an order and booked a room for two nights on Christmas Day.

The hotel's comprehensive recommendation index is five stars! It is indeed the king of Sanya Bay hotels!

The biggest highlight of the hotel is of course the rooftop infinity pool and the hollow glass-bottom heated pool. In addition, the hotel also has two outdoor pools and an indoor heated pool. In addition, the hotel is very close to Sanya Bay. You can see the sunrise and sunset at the same time, and the sea view is unbeatable! The basic room is also large enough. The coconut chicken hotpot provided with the room coupon also tastes good.
The biggest shortcoming of the hotel is the lack of floor height. The soft furnishings in the public area feel very low. Personally, I feel that if the public area is well designed, the entire hotel can be upgraded to a higher level. In addition, the hardware facilities in the rooms are not of a high grade and feel a little... Old.

2. Guest Room | In Room

When I first saw the hotel's appearance, I pictured Crowne Plaza Haitang Bay in my mind, and this feeling became even more obvious after entering the room at Conifer Hotel.

The room voucher I booked was for the most basic twin room with garden view. When I arrived at the hotel, there were no king-bed rooms with garden view. I could only upgrade to a king-size bed with sea view for an extra two hundred yuan per night. Thinking about it, I was alone, so I might as well save the money. Come down for Christmas dinner. The room is about 60 square meters. There is a dressing room on the left as soon as you enter, and a semi-open bathroom ahead. Further ahead is a large bed sofa and a work desk. After the balcony door, there is a balcony. There is also a small balcony on the balcony. Single bathtub.

The design of the entire room is flawless. There is no smart toilet but there are electric curtains. Like the Crowne Plaza, the mini bar is free and replenished daily. In addition, although it is a garden view room, you can still see a little sea view from the balcony. There was a slight musty smell when the room was first entered, but after the air conditioner was operated for a period of time, the smell was basically gone. The biggest drawback of the room was that there was a problem with the direction of the shower head fixed on the wall. No matter how it was placed, it could not spray at you, and the tropical rain on the top The rainforest shower is not very easy to use and the bathing experience is not good anyway. In addition, the TV in the room is relatively small and is completely embedded in the wall, making it difficult to upgrade in the future.

3. Catering | Dining

The room voucher for this group purchase is to choose between a buffet breakfast for two people and a coconut chicken meal for two at noon. You will be given two electronic vouchers when you check in. You can decide whether to have breakfast or lunch based on the time you get up every day. Personally, I think this setting It‚Äôs still very convenient to book.

In addition, on the evening of the day of check-in, I went to the seafood buffet restaurant on the 16th floor to experience the hotel's Christmas dinner. In the lottery (I didn‚Äôt even win the sixth prize), but whether it‚Äôs worth the price of 398 per person is a matter of opinion...

Because I was too full at the buffet the night before, I skipped breakfast the next day and went for the coconut chicken hotpot lunch set. The whole set felt good. The coconut chicken soup was very sweet and the key was that there were not many people and it was very clean.

4. Facilities |

The hotel facilities are very rich. First of all, the R floor of the hotel (probably the 18th floor) is the rooftop Internet celebrity swimming pool. You must take the sightseeing elevator on the right side of the lobby to go up to the R floor. After you register on the R floor, you can swipe your card to open the door and walk up the steps. Go up to the rooftop pool.

Because the hotel is an L-shaped building, the rooftop infinity pool is also L-shaped. There is a semicircular viewing platform at the top of the L facing east. This should be the best viewing spot for watching the sunrise. The L faces south. On the other side facing Sanya Bay is a smaller heated pool with a hollow glass bottom. In fact, the so-called glass bottom is just a narrow ***** of glass. It is still incomparable with the glass-bottom swimming pool of the One Hotel in Haitang Bay. However, the heated pool is over there. There is a viewing platform with a long line of red flowers. When the weather is good, it will be very beautiful to take pictures of the sunset in Sanya Bay.

In addition to the two swimming pools on the roof, the hotel also has a garden swimming pool and a children's paddling pool in the outdoor sky garden on the third floor. Next to the children's pool is an indoor children's playground, which also has an e-sports room.

In addition, there is an indoor heated swimming pool on the second floor of the hotel, and a large gym on the first floor. In terms of overall facilities, I think it has surpassed most Internet celebrity hotels.

5. Unforgettable moments | the Moments

Before coming to Sanya Conifer Hotel, I expected that the hotel's hardware and scenery would be good, but after checking in, I didn't expect that the hotel's overall service was also very online. When I first arrived at the hotel, all the counters happened to be checking in. A staff member even came to comfort me and help me pay attention to which counter would finish processing first so I could go there in advance.

During the check-in process, hotel GRO Xiaojing also took the initiative to add me on WeChat, providing one-on-one services similar to Haitang Bay Crowne Plaza. I asked Xiaojing several questions on WeChat, and received timely replies. Of course, compared with the international chain five-star hotels (mainly the one I mentioned repeatedly before), the service staff have fewer smiles and are a little impatient when there are many guests. However, considering the low price of the room voucher, For my sake, none of this matters.

6. Conclusion | Conclusion

Personally, I feel that the room vouchers currently being sold by Sanya Conifer Hotel are very good value (especially the one with no price increase in the off-season). You must know that the coconut chicken set meal included in the room vouchers is sold online for more than 200 yuan, and the rooftop infinity pool for two people The swimming ticket costs more than 300. Anyway, I haven‚Äôt finished my stay yet. I‚Äôve already placed an order online and bought a few room vouchers to save...

Not only did he help us upgrade our room, but also learned that the couple's check-in was arranged in advance, which was very romantic. He said he wanted to drink coconut and gave it to us!

msg:After checking out, I arrived at the next hotel and waited for a long time to check in because Kang Nian didn't exit the public security system in time. Besides the upstairs swimming pool, this hotel has no special features. For example, if you want to see the room card in a scenic spot, you must sign it for registration. It's the same as signing a contract, the waiter's ghostwriting is not enough, how to go in every day, what procedures are different, there is no uniform standard to see the mood, then I have a room for watching the sea every day at 3:30 p.m. every day, the street culture square starts activities, singing and square dancing continue until 10 p.m. It is very noisy for me Three videos were recorded. The cloudy days in the past few days are afternoon, evening and evening.

msg:I have a special fate with Kang Nian. It was the first time I came to Sanya for my birthday, and I decided to come to Sanya for my birthday. This year, I stayed in Sanya for four nights during the winter vacation, and I was amazed every time. Not to mention the scenery, the most subtle thing is the cleaning aunt. Every time I clean up the room, I will give some basic supplements. Seeing that our paper is used up quickly, we will supply paper every day. Masks are also changed every day, and the balcony bathtub is touched by hand. There is no dust and mud, and the drinks in the minibar are replenished every day. This service is really intimate.
I didn't experience the charm of breakfast last time I came here. This time I tried to get up early and punch in the restaurant every day. Kang Nian is the first I've seen that makes breakfast richer than most buffets. Not to mention these must-have breakfast options in China and the West. Hainanese special Baoluo noodles and Yi noodles are also must-haves, and they all taste very delicious! The fruit master cuts it now, and the juice is not mixed with water.
In short, Kangnian is really a cost-effective hotel for vacation. We come to Sanya once every year, and we will definitely come to Kangnian every time.
Sanya's short summer, good memories.

Moreover, the hotel is very transparent and the air quality in the rooms is good. I am very satisfied with this point. Before I checked in, I was worried that the sea-view room would smell damp. In fact, I was worried that it was unnecessary.

The hotel also has a free travel shot of the infinity pool on the roof of the Internet celebrity. The photographer Liu Xiaopeng did a good job, and he was very humorous, and he would also guide the photo posture.

The hotel has an excellent location, just across the road from the beach. It‚Äôs very lively here, that is, the square dance music of uncles and aunts is sometimes too loud. And the hotel is very close to the airport, suitable for the first or last day of stay.

In short, it is a good hotel that I would recommend to friends to stay.

msg:Sanya Conifer Hotel
First of all, I would like to thank Jiu Xiaojing, the guest relations director of Xia Kangnian Hotel, and also thank the staff in the concierge depar**ent who did not remember their names. The warm and thoughtful service made us spend a wonderful holiday.
Taking advantage of the National Day holiday, I took my children to Sanya for vacation, but the sudden tropical pressure made the sky unbeautiful and affected most of the outdoor activities. Fortunately, the selected hotel itself already has enough parent-child activities and check-in and photo spots. , Still having a good time.
The 110-square-meter parent-child suite booked on Ctrip, the price of the National Day itself has increased a bit, probably less than 2000 after the voucher, the price is definitely higher in Sanya Bay, but the quality of Kangnian itself is better than those Hotels in their early 1000s are indeed much better, and the package also includes two large and one small crested ibis buffet restaurant, and the restaurant itself is excellent, and the meal fee for two is almost 500, so the price of the room is on National Day Still very cost-effective during the period.
The rooms in Kangnian‚Äôs parent-child suite are very good. The children especially like it. They even like it more than the 270-degree ocean view suite of Atlantis. Although the perspectives of children and adults are indeed very different, it is true that Kangnian‚Äôs details are done. Is better.
Some points that I think are more practical:
1. There are children‚Äôs pullover bath towels after swimming in 0 rooms, which are easy to use, and can also shade and protect against wind.
2. The toilet seat and stairs of the children's toilet are especially convenient for children to use
3. The design of double toilets and double bathtubs is also very good
4. All snacks and drinks in the refrigerator are free
5. Children's favorite high and low beds, climb up and down countless times
6. A new set of sand digging toys is prepared in the room. You can go to Sanya Bay Beach in Haihong Square to dig and play. We saw a lot of sand crabs.

The two infinity swimming pools of the hotel are required by Internet celebrities, but the most important thing is to be able to shoot. In our package, the hotel sent 9 travel shots, but because of the rain, the time available for shooting every day is very high. Few, I feel that the photographer was in a hurry. He took a total of 26 shots for us, and almost none of them were good. The staff of Kangnian Wo's travel shooting was very nice. They said they would help us to remake it, but because we were rushing to Haitang Bay and the weather was really bad, there was really no way to find another time. This is the most regrettable point of this trip. In Kang Nian, I couldn't leave a few beautiful photos of the infinity pool. It is recommended that friends who go later must make an appoin**ent in advance and do their homework in advance.

It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that the clown in the hotel is very dedicated. Our daughter got clown-made balloons in the cafeteria and star restaurant in the two days. At the children‚Äôs pool bubble party at 5pm in the garden pool, the clown was also very hardworking and funny. The children are particularly happy.

msg:The experience of the Conifer Hotel is great. The hotel is large and clean. The staff is also very enthusiastic and responsible. The guest relationship is very meticulous and efficient. The first day of staying also gave a fruit plate, and the room has a minibar. It's free, and Xiao Jing also said that she can contact her to continue replenishment after drinking. Sudden acute gastroenteritis on the last night, I called the front desk the next morning to apply for late check-out. The lady at the front desk directly applied for free late check-out, which was very considerate. The infinity pool is particularly clean, the water temperature is also comfortable, and it is disinfected and cleaned every day. It is a good experience. The breakfast is very rich, and there are also cheap and super cost-effective hotels for lunch and dinner. This time I came with my parents. Next time I go to Sanya with my friends, I will stay here and I will plant grass for my friends. I really like this hotel~

msg:The 70-meter cantilevered swimming pool and the 1,200-square-meter infinity pool on the roof must be the biggest charm of this hotel! Be sure to shoot! ! !
üöó Transportation: Located in Sanya Bay, the hotel is across the road from the beach. It is too convenient to go to the beach to watch the day, and the airport is less than 10 kilometers away.
üßπSanitation: It may be the peak season of National Day, so the room is always not cleaned in time. There is room for improvement.
üçÉEnvironment: Generally clean and tidy, especially the infinity pool on the roof has become a new online celebrity check-in place, with a panoramic view of Sanya Bay, a great holy place for ladies and girls
üîîService: The hotel's service is full, and the welcoming guest is also very proactive to help with luggage. Here, I would like to praise my little brother Wang Ming. The front desk will also take the initiative to guide the process and upgrade the sea view room intimately. Coffee coupons are also presented during the check-in waiting time, but the little brother with earrings in the coffee shop is in a state of ignorance, a bit of a drop in points
The mini bar in the room will also be replenished every day, which is very generous and considerate. There are many children‚Äôs games every day, and we are also working hard to move closer to the parent-child hotel, but the teachers need to be more professional and enthusiastic. It's better.
By the way, the price is more than a thousand, and the breakfast is not standard, which is really not very friendly~
The overall score is 4.5, I will come again if I have a chance, I hope it will be a full score next time

The hotel is located in Sanya Bay, opposite the hotel is the seaside, the scenery is still good, Sanya Bay also has more food, convenient transportation
The infinity pool is really great. It's open until 11 o'clock in the evening, and it starts at 7 o'clock in the morning. It's good to watch the sunrise if the weather is good.
The day before check-in, Ms. An Rong, the guest relations director, contacted in advance and helped us upgrade the room. At the beginning, it was decided that there was no sea view.
I also gave us fruit, which is really good. The service of the lady is super good and caring. There is also a drop-off service. The whole feeling is very caring.

The room was also arranged for us, very warm.

üçÉEnvironment: When checking in, the hotel staff came to the room early to help turn on the air conditioner. It was very cool as soon as you entered the room, but the only uncomfortable thing was that there was a musty or damp smell after entering the room (I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs close to the sea.

Bringing the elderly and children to vacation during the National Day holiday, a good mood will be ruined by this hotel. Almost all the publicity of this hotel is top-notch! !
First of all, the check-in process was quite unsatisfactory, and no one came to pour a glass of water or take luggage after queuing at the front desk for a long time;
Room: We booked almost the highest-priced two-bedroom duplex sea view suite here. It is said that it is a sea view room, which means that the sea view can be seen from a corner. The room facilities are old and the corners and corners are all signs of mold. There is no electric toilet, unknown brand-name toiletries and hair dryers, and no children's bath and bath towels. All the experience is too bad!
Food: There is really nothing to eat for breakfast. The coffee machine can only make American style, and the toast on the bread machine is baked for a long time. The desserts feel that there is no freshly made dessert, which is very unpalatable. The so-called seafood dinner buffet does not even have decent seafood. Don't even think about raw oysters and lobsters.
The only selling point of the infinity pool and the sunset are okay, at least the sunset is pretty good. This hotel will never come anyway. The Yanlord Crown, Mandarin Oriental and Autograph I have stayed in are better than this.

I couldn‚Äôt help but make appoin**ents when I saw such a beautiful infinity pool. Thanks to the photographer Xiaodong. The photography skills are really good. He patiently taught me to pose and took pictures of me, a fat guy who is thin and beautiful. Also, the film picker Chunchun gave a lot of good suggestions. The selection process was very enjoyable. I was very satisfied with this trip. It was an unexpected surprise.
        The Conifer Hotel has done a good job in many details. For example, there is still an epidemic situation. A small gift bag was sent in the room very intimately, which contained a mask, disinfectant wipes and spray. There is a big bathtub on the balcony, and the room is equipped with disposable bathtub bags and rose bubble bombs. The quality of disposable products is very good. The service of the hotel is also good, and the waiter at any location will take the initiative to greet and say hello.
       I woke up early in the morning and went for a run at the Coconut Dream Corridor downstairs. After I came back, I went to the gym to work out after breakfast. In the evening, I went to the infinity pool on the roof to swim when the sun was off. I felt that the experience was very good. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, but it has everything that should be there.
       What needs improvement is that the Wi-Fi in my room is not very useful. I hope to improve it.
       All in all this hotel can be recommended.

The hotel‚Äôs parent-child suites are very good, and the children are satisfied and have fun. The hotel‚Äôs infinity pool is the most attractive place for children. But when the hotel travel photographer was shooting, he was a little foolish, took a few photos in a hurry and left, no matter where the guests wanted to take them or what kind of photos they wanted to take.

I think staying for three nights is perfect, the only thing is that the breakfast is really good! Sorry for the price and the grade of the hotel! The prices of other meals are not to be mentioned. After all, the price is a bit more expensive due to the hotel's own situation, but the cooked meals...do not match his price! The room is ok. Before I came, I saw that there was no private beach, so I booked a garden-view room, but when I checked in, the girl was really nice. I didn‚Äôt say anything and he gave me a vision room with a view of the beach, although there was no promotion. The room is satisfactory, the whole is ok, can come again!

The TV in the room didn't work and the room was small. It's not up to standard at all. The hotel as a whole is a 3-star environment. There is a broken swimming pool. It's hyped up. If you go to Sanya, you should look for a reliable MGM. Hengren is a 5-star hotel with the same price and several times better environment. And the water is clean. This hotel is a rip-off. The environment is the same as the 300 or 500 hotels. The room they gave me is wrong and they didn't give me the difference. I will complain. Why did the 1900 room become 1300?

The parent-child room and the sea-view room are set. The rooms are very large, with drinks, children's care kits and beach toys.
Great balcony with sea view, bathtub and lounge chairs
This place is a bit original, you always see bugs and even praying mantis in the room
Very close to the beach, only a few minutes
Because of the epidemic, I didn‚Äôt dare to swim in the infinity pool, so I took a look.
The breakfast place is very big, but I really don‚Äôt seem to be able to pick out what to eat, the fruit is good
The stir-fry in the restaurant tastes good, and the fruit salad and pasta are also delicious
I feel very good, but the epidemic is not fun, come again next time

Although the place where children play is smaller than before, the quality of service inside has improved. Children play there, accompanied by younger brothers and sisters, which is great. The dining in the hotel is also very good, the environment is nice and quiet, the price is affordable, and the food is comfortable. The swimming pool is indoor and outdoor, so there is no need to be afraid of rain. There is also an infinity pool on the top floor, which is great

msg:Shua Mouyin saw this Sanya Internet celebrity hotel. The selling point is his infinity pool. I went to Singapore to know Jinsha Hotel before, but unfortunately the hotel stipulates that you can‚Äôt go there. Next time you have a chance, you must stay, but this Second, the infinity pool in Sanya has filled up my little regrets before!
The hotel is located near the Coconut Dream Corridor near the Dadonghai Sea, not far from Luhuitou. If you raise your head below the hotel, you can see a corner of the hanging infinity pool. The decoration design style of the glass plank road is completely transparent!
The lobby design of hotels in tropical areas is almost the same. The super large doors are completely open and two-way convection. My understanding is that there may be more typhoons and heavy rains. This design is good at avoiding strong winds. The hotel lobby is on the 3rd floor, and the front desk The reception girl is like an intern, young and not very skilled in business, but the service attitude is very good, her face is childish and enthusiastic, and she obviously has not received the baptism of the society!
We booked a double room with full sea view and wanted a high-rise floor, but the front desk said it was only 12 floors, so don‚Äôt hesitate to do it, and I will definitely not stand on the balcony to watch the sea view!
The hotel rooms are simple and clean, without overly gorgeous decoration but stylish. The room area is not very large, but it is enough for two people. The bathtub is located on the balcony. You can take a bath inside, and you will never see it outside. It is very clever. The design, you can see the scenery and enjoy it, all in one!
The top floor is an infinity swimming pool. At first glance, the sky, the sea, and the swimming pool are in one line, seamlessly connected, but when you swim past it, you will find that it is very safe. There is a protective platform below. There is no need to worry about safety. The pool water is not. It is very deep. If you are an adult, you can walk in it with confidence. If you are a child, you should bring a swimming ring just in case! The infinity pool is definitely a good place to check in at his house, especially the part of the hanging glass. You can really see the busy road when you dive into the water, but maybe because of the buoyancy in the water, I don‚Äôt feel scared. , It feels completely different from me going to the glass path, so if you come, you can go there and dive with confidence. It really doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs not scary at all, on the contrary, it‚Äôs amazing, exciting, and interesting!
Generally speaking, this hotel is very recommended, but the facilities in the room are relatively simple, I think punching in is enough!
