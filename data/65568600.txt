Cons: painfully slow check-in service at the front desk each time, personnel at the front desk barely speak English, can never find a reservation in their system. Every time out of three staff members at the front desk only one is trained enough to work independently, others just standing around.

So comfortable that I didn't want to wake up early for my train.The breakfast had a really good variety such as noodles, crepes, pastries, etc. The room had a good amount of toiletries. However, I was disappointed that the mini fridge was empty despite a list of items available being in the room. Also, there seemed to be no menu for room service or even a guide to the hotel amenities. The check in was quick and easy. But I wouldn't say they really made an effort to be welcoming. I had to ask for the gift and also the information about the dinner included in my booking fee.

The subway station is in walking distance, about 10 ~ 15 minutes on foot. 

The hotel looks so new and everyting was clean.  

Breakfast is, I personally think, just good enough.  Not bad. 
Actually, it was not so superior to other 5 star hotels.  I guess, there are a lot of 4 star hotels in Shanghai which provide better breakfast buffet.

There is a mall nearby the hotel and a cute scenic area with lots of restaurants.
Getting to the center of Shanghai was about a 40 minute drive. The staff were very welcoming and warm. My friend even had canceled her booking halfway throughout our trip because she wanted to stay closer to the city and they helped her to book again with no hassle. Overall, I loved the hotel. If you want to be close to the airport it‚Äôs perfect and worth it.

msg:I have stayed in this hotel many times, and this time the experience was really bad; the concierge at the door was still very good, enthusiastic and proactive, but the check-in at the front desk was very inferior. The Ctrip member benefits delayed check-out until 14:00, and the order confirmation form was also until 14:00. The front desk staff felt very embarrassed, and I didn‚Äôt know what the embarrassment was? They told you stiffly to confirm it on the last day.
The sign on the breakfast table clearly stated that you were having a meal. When you finished taking the meal and poured a cup of coffee, all the dishes you took were taken away. After reporting the problem, no relevant personnel apologized for such a mistake. It is incredible that such a situation would occur in such a hotel. The surface of the room I stayed in was relatively clean, but the carpet was really shocked. I hope that the hotel‚Äôs daily maintenance can be done more carefully to live up to the InterContinental brand.

The hotel has a good location and convenient transportation. Although it is close to Hongqiao Railway Station and Hongqiao Airport, it has good sound insulation and is very quiet.

The room contains 2 bottles of water. I called to ask how many more bottles I need, and the answer is that there are only 4 bottles at most, which is a bit unfriendly for families with children.
I especially praise the breakfast, there are really many varieties, both Chinese and Western, and drinks include Perrier Evian Yakult fresh juice, which can be eaten until 10:30
The Ihg member front desk also recognized it and gave a drink coupon. The room was full so it could not be upgraded. In general, the executive benefits include afternoon tea and simple meals for dinner, and breakfast for two adults and two children the next day. More than 700 is still cost-effective, and the surrounding Hongqiao Tianjie and Hongqiao Tiandi are very good to visit.

The room card was not made for three days at a time, and I had to go to the front desk to swipe it once a day. I said that this was inconvenient and hoped to swipe it for three days, but was directly rejected.

After all, the hotel is an international brand five-star hotel, with first-class facilities, hygiene, and service. The service staff are all well-trained. When we checked in, they learned that we were taking the high-speed rail the next night, and immediately helped us to check out late until 3 o'clock. Later in the afternoon, I missed the return to the hotel due to traffic jams. I called the front desk to explain, and they were also very polite and comforted us that it didn't matter if we were late. The room rate of less than 700 yuan booked by Ctrip includes two breakfasts and afternoon tea, which is really worth the price-performance ratio.
A small suggestion: it would be better if the hotel could have more signboards in the underground passage connected to the Hongqiao hub.

As for the geographical location, the Hongqiao Railway Station subway is more than ten minutes' walk away, and Hongqiao Tiandi and Longhu Tianjie are next to it. The hotel is close to Qingpu Outlets Shopping Center, which provides great convenience for guests who like shopping. The surrounding transportation is convenient, and Bus 71 goes directly to Xintiandi, making it convenient for guests to go to various attractions and business districts in the city.

The highest temperature in Shanghai that day was 23 degrees, and it should be around 18 degrees at night, but the room was turned on and the air conditioning was adjusted to the lowest setting, and the air conditioning temperature was 27 degrees or even 28 degrees. I woke up in the middle of the night because of the heat and couldn't fall asleep. I could only open the door for ventilation.
I found out that there was a problem before going to bed that night. The guy who answered the phone at the front desk was a little impatient. It felt like it was not the first time to deal with this situation. He said to send an electric fan. It was speechless. The room was stuffy and it was still stuffy when the fan was turned on, and I didn't ask for it. Later, the electrician came and said that there was no problem with the wind and measured it at 21 degrees. But the room was still stuffy.

msg:In order to completely relax during the Spring Festival, I chose to spend a week at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in the south corner of Hongqiao Business District, which is quiet and peaceful.
The hotel staff are full of energy and the service is not compromised at all:
Marina, Eason, Ella, Ricky at the front desk, and Auntie Zhang Yun, the room attendant, all gave us all kinds of help.
In order to replenish bath towels and remove the garbage in the room in time, an uncle who works at the main entrance of the hotel came to do these things. However, the garbage bags on the floor ran out, and it took him some trouble to find the garbage bags.
During the Spring Festival, the all-day dining restaurant on the second floor was overloaded. Not only was it full for all three meals, but there were even queues at the elevator entrance. Some of the waiters and chefs were just 20-year-olds, but they remained polite and patient in the face of huge pressure. Every request of every guest was not neglected.
Finally, I hope the engineering depar**ent can solve the problem of overheating of the air conditioner. According to the year of construction of the hotel, it is unlikely to be a single-system central air conditioner. It should be a four-pipe air conditioner, but the cold air/fresh air is not running. With the sun entering the room, the room temperature is too high, and many guests have to open the door, but it is also The effect is minimal and it has become a shortcoming, which I believe will be resolved.

But the package, the so-called "only Ôø•110 more to enjoy a great value experience" is too deceptive. What you get is not the experience, but the embarrassment. I went there at around three o'clock in the afternoon. In addition to soda water and Evian mineral water (to be honest, the drinks are...

Didn't get it either. The waiter was indifferent, and other staff were preparing dishes. It felt like they were preparing for the buffet in the evening? Anyway, you can see it, but you are not allowed to eat it, which adds to the embarrassment.

msg:When a child wanted to spend his birthday in a hotel, the first place he thought of was Jinchen Crowne Plaza. This is the fourth time I have stayed here this year. This time the front desk arranged a room in the executive building which is very quiet, very spacious and bright, and very clean. No matter where you go, the hotel waiters will take the initiative to smile and say hello, making people feel very friendly.
The complimentary afternoon tea and happy hour are more varied and more exquisite than before. It can be seen that the hotel is very attentive. The breakfast is as rich as ever, and the dishes are cleared very quickly.
Opposite the hotel is Hongqiao Tiandi, a commercial area integrating eating, drinking and entertainment. The B2 floor can directly lead to the shopping mall, which is very convenient.
Looking forward to having more and better experiences next time you stay.

My friend's room also had a broken air conditioner, the milk didn't work so she had to change the room, but the other room wasn't cold either. My friend couldn't sleep all night, so unlucky..

The lady at the front desk was also very nice because my ID card had been demagnetized for no apparent reason, but she handled the whole process patiently. The staff was also very nice when I went to the restaurant to eat and check out. When I arrived, the cleaning lady also said goodbye with a smile.

There are so many types of breakfast food, including Chinese and Western food, sweet and salty, and my favorites are freshly squeezed watermelon juice, pan-fried buns, pot stickers, teppanyaki fried udon, etc. All in all, it was delicious and I had a lot of fun eating it! It feels like, for one price, I had three meals! Within a 5-minute walk, you can also walk to several large shopping malls, where you can find everything to eat and play. Next time I go to Shanghai, this will definitely be my first choice.

At the same time, if you go to the city center for business, including taxi fares, it is cheaper than living in the city center.

His home is hidden behind the Hyatt, and the environment and decoration are very good. I just stayed for one night without researching it carefully. It is said that there is no swimming pool?
The bathroom in the room I live in also has floor-to-ceiling windows. The room facilities also reflect that it is a hotel that has just opened in recent years. There is a takeaway counter and a convenience store at the door.

I still have to praise Crowne Plaza's breakfast. A five-star hotel should at least be of this standard. Are you interested in the breakfast at those so-called boutique hotels?

There is no personal butler service behind you, but at this price and because I am socially anxious, it doesn‚Äôt matter.

It took a lot of effort to find it through the center of Hongqiao. The brand is really not obvious. The standard lobby of a five-star hotel is a**ospheric, spacious, and considerate service. The hotel has an independent lobby, independent guest rooms in the main building and east building. The rooms are very clean, and you can't fault them all day long. The rooms are large, the beds are comfortable, and the pillows are relatively soft. In fact, it is not good for the cervical spine. The hardware facilities are complete, and the water temperature is not bad. Fits well, fits very spacious, overall very satisfied.

However, the check-in time is too long. I waited from 1:00 to 1:30 and there was no room. It took more than ten minutes for one person to check in. Express hotels are automatically checked in. Five-star hotels are still in the old stage. The system should be upgraded. Secondly, the waiter may be too busy and keep all the customer's remarks information behind me. As a result, I couldn't get the room information in time and kept walking outside. I didn't arrive at the hotel until after 5 o'clock in the evening. Hope to improve a lot, after all, it is five-star.

The only fly in the oin**ent is that there is no swimming pool... I don't understand why the 5-star hotel doesn't have a swimming pool... The 4-star hotel next door has a great swimming pool! It would be great if it could be shared... Sigh...

I was afraid that if the expectations were high, I would be disappointed. In fact, it is quite OK.

There is also Yakult that you can pick up by yourself~ If I remember correctly, this is the first time I have encountered a hotel that provides Yakult for breakfast, nice~

msg:The hotel is close to Hongqiao Airport and the high-speed rail station. My feelings about staying are as follows: 1. Beer is not included in the check-in package, and the Ctrip information is inaccurate. 2. The carpet in the room is dirty, the maintenance is poor, and the cleaning is not thorough. 3. A quiet room was marked before check-in, but it turned out to be a room directly opposite the aisle where the cleaning vehicle is placed. Every morning, the cleaning staff woke people up with a loud voice. 4. When applying for a late check-out at night, the man who answered the phone at the front desk said, even if you have exchanged the benefits of late check-out with Ctrip, even if you are an IHG member, our hotel still has the right to decide, and the extension can be up to 1:00. But the next afternoon, I witnessed many people checking out slowly at 2:30. I can only lament that Ctrip's influence in its own territory is no longer good? 5. The night before check-out, the family living next door made noise, so I called the front desk and offered to change a room. The same man at the front desk opened his mouth and said that there was no room and could not change. At the same time, there were similar vacant rooms listed on Ctrip.com. Finally, I turned to Ctrip to solve the problem, and 50 words are omitted here. Summary: Late check-out and changing rooms are common things when staying in a hotel. If it is not really necessary, I will rarely use it, but when I use it occasionally, the communication with the hotel is often very simple and pleasant. I have almost never encountered such a lack of professionalism. front desk staff. In fact, the hotel does a good job in some areas, such as the rich breakfast, and the restaurant staff can also take the initiative to say hello, welcome and send them off, but the process of dealing with the same person at the front desk twice is really disgusting, which is a lot of points for this InterContinental hotel.

Executive courtesy (happy hour & afternoon tea), basically three meals a day are settled in the hotel. The breakfast is the most abundant.

Since I booked from Ctrip, I asked the front desk if I need to provide my membership number in order to earn points. The front desk told me no, that‚Äôs OK, but since I asked that It means that I must have a membership. Why did I receive a message privately registering a membership account for me through my mobile phone number when I woke up the next morning? Moreover, the elevator from the front desk to the guest room requires several turns. There is no guidance from the front desk?
Let‚Äôs talk about breakfast. You don‚Äôt need to verify any identity to enter the restaurant, you can just go in directly. You can drink Perrier Evian water all you want, and the food counter is very rich and varied because of the restaurant's design style. But from the time I arrived at the restaurant at seven o'clock to the time I finished breakfast at eight o'clock, there were still some foods that had their plastic wraps not peeled off? No one came to serve during the meal, only a little girl came to ask if she was satisfied with the meal. The second question is whether the hotel has any requirements for the grooming of its employees. The hotel employees no longer wear masks, but they don‚Äôt even put on makeup. Even the secretions in their eyes are still there early in the morning, and the pimples are clearly visible. , are you satisfied with this kind of appearance? During the meal, the table was taken away before anyone left. Fortunately, I rushed back to stop it. When I finally left, there were three waiters and a boy who was supposed to be the supervisor standing in two rows at the door of the restaurant, having fun and seeing off the guests. I didn't understand what was going on, it seemed like none of the hotel employees were in the mood to go to work.

First of all, the service attitude is very bad, not even comparable to the service of business hotels or express hotels. When I asked the front desk clerk, the waiter didn't even raise his head.
Second, the hotel lobby is too messy. When checking in, at least two people walked back to the lobby and said they couldn't find the elevator and couldn't tell the east and west floors. The waiter said with an impatient look, just go there, just go there. Woolen cloth?
Thirdly, the breakfast is extremely poor and generally not considered good. The fruits are overnight and the side dishes for eating beancurd are smelly (it may be the smell, but I don't accept it. I can still taste the taste of pickles). However, the ingredients in the western food section are all of the highest quality, and are not typically reserved for Chinese people.

msg:advantage:
1. The location is superior, within a short walk to Hongqiao Railway Station and T2, T1 is a little farther away, but it is only about ten minutes by car.

2. You can reach the shopping mall on foot, where you can eat, drink and have fun.

3. The dinner and breakfast provided by the hotel are good. There are many types of breakfast. Although there are few types of dinner, they are also very delicious. I haven't tried their Cantonese-style Chinese restaurant, it should be very good, because the chicken feet made by the chef are quite authentic, you can try it if you stay.

4. The security of the hotel is not bad. They have three buildings. Even the same hotel cannot use the elevators of other buildings, and the elevators of the same building can only use their own. This is better. I checked in twice in total, and once I was assigned a tail room. I checked specifically to see that there was surveillance, but I just didn't know if there would be a blind spot. However, the overall feeling that the security of this hotel is still very secure. There have been many problems in many hotels, and it is really important to find a hotel that is safer.

5. The floor-to-ceiling window design makes the sight wide and the floor is high, so the whole room will not be oppressed.

shortcoming:
1. Except that you can feel the VIP experience at the doorman, there is nothing else. Just...the staff of this hotel lack enthusiasm and most importantly professionalism.
Met the staff many times, but didn't say hello. In the comfortable hotel I stayed in before, there was a cleaning lady who greeted me warmly at the front desk whenever I met her. I don't understand why the staff in this hotel are so cold.
The front desk did not remind the guests which packages are included in the reservation room and where they can be used. If I hadn't asked for more, I wouldn't be able to eat the hotel's buffet that night.

2. The facilities are relatively outdated. The door and toilet handle of the room I booked later was about to fall off, but after feedback, it was repaired in time, which is quite good.

3. The carpet is very dirty, and the marks of all kinds of soup and water are clear at a glance. Does the hotel really consider changing the carpet? üòÇ
4. Hygiene still needs to be strengthened.

personal suggestion:
1. There is nothing in the refrigerator in the hotel. During this trip, apart from the Crowne Plaza, I also stayed in two comfortable hotels. The refrigerator has Coke, Sprite, and biscuits. Compared with others, Crowne Plaza is really... buckle. And there is a convenience store underneath, no one will buy your 20 yuan Coke üòÇ, but if you can put a bottle or two of drinks, the customers will be happier.
2. Hope to have a food delivery robot.

This trip is too busy to eat a lot of Shanghai snacks and I don't have time to eat it, but I actually ate raw fried food here üòâ This restaurant will be the first choice when I come to Shanghai in the future

The high-quality service from Ella at the front desk is warm, friendly and considerate. She helped upgrade to the suite on the executive floor and felt very warm. The room is spacious and bright, refreshing, and the hotel facilities are very new, clean and hygienic.
The hotel's happyhour and executive lounge meals are delicious and delicious. Especially desserts, with endless aftertaste and mellow taste, all three meals a day can be settled in the hotel.
The location of the hotel is superior, adjacent to the airport, the surrounding traffic is convenient, the business is prosperous, and shopping malls such as Hongqiao Tiandi make people linger and forget to return. There are convenience stores, Luckin Coffee and other shops downstairs.
This trip was really fruitful, full of joy and surprises everywhere, and it made people feel very happy. Recommended to stay at Holiday Inn!

In fact, diagonally opposite is Longhu Paradise Street, and beyond that is Hongqiao Tiandi, where there are many restaurants in the shopping mall. The location of the hotel is very good.

Because I am an IHG member, the front desk upgraded the room very considerately when I checked in. The room is large and the decoration is relatively new. Overall, it was a very good experience.

1. Hardware part.
1. The wash basin in the bathroom of the guest room is leaking extensively. When the faucet is turned on, water flows under the sink. The water flow is so large that it is staggering.
2. The guest room is not clean. There are still bottle caps unscrewed by previous guests on the carpet in the room.
3. The DND light is invalid. No matter how you press it, it's always on.
2. Service part.
1. When the guest reported the problem to the front desk, there was no response from the front desk.
2. When the guest reported the problem to the guest service center, no engineering and maintenance personnel came to the door.
3. The reason explained to the customer later was that the DND light was always on. (In fact, after testing, the DND light has never been able to be turned off)
4. The hotel has the guest‚Äôs contact information, but has never been contacted.
5. When checking in, the hotel extended check-out until 14:00, but the room card became invalid as soon as it passed 12:00 the next day.

The hotel is very arrogant and there are currently complaints.

Then start to evaluate the hotel accommodation. First of all, the hardware facilities are not up to five-star standards.
1. A room with a bathtub, since it doesn‚Äôt even have the most basic bath salts, disposable bath bags, etc.
2. The refrigerator in the minibar is empty
3. The hair dryer in the hotel is particularly poor. You can refer to express hotels.
4. Poor toiletries, disposable toothpaste and toothbrushes are really the standard of a fast hotel
5. There is a very "sweet" sound when the room door is opened.
6. The service of the housekeeping depar**ent is even more mysterious: I called the hotel at about 10 o'clock in the evening, and no one answered the 4 calls (each call was about five minutes apart). It was supposed to be online 24 hours a day, but no one was available for at least 20 minutes. The front desk of the hotel is completely unfamiliar with the surrounding environment of two to three hundred meters, such as landmark buildings such as high-speed rail stations.
Because the mobile phone charger was forgotten when checking out, the hotel acted as if it had not seen it and did not contact the guest to ask (this is really shocking). I don‚Äôt understand because the training is not in place? Is the service irregular or intentional?
From the manager on duty to some of the waiters at the front desk, it can be said that they have no ability to solve problems. They are unable to resolve the reasonable demands of guests and have to apologize for bad reviews. Is this the hotel's style of doing things? ? !

Fried buns There are delicious soups, freshly squeezed juices, Perrier water and Evian mineral water. I have stayed in many hotels.

Even if you are a platinum member, complaints from the headquarters will be useless. What's more, if ordinary people check in, the service will be even worse. There is no service in the service industry, the hotel hygiene is poor, the prices are too high, the supporting facilities are not complete and are sold separately, and you have to make all the rubbish money. ** I spend half of the year traveling around the country.

1. The negotiated suite went in and the glass was being repaired, so I couldn't check in until after 6pm. You have to wait all afternoon, what did you do early?

2. I left a piece of clothing at the hotel, and the front desk told me to pick it up, or send it by express delivery but I have to pay on delivery. Are these services not available in five-star hotels?

msg:This is the Crowne Plaza Hotel's superior king room with the smallest room we have ever stayed in. Ctrip said it was 42 square meters. After checking in, we found that the room area had shrunk. The hotel explained that the building area of ‚Äã‚Äã42 square meters includes the shared area. It may be directly disclosed. Let's spread out 10 square meters.

The variety of breakfast is quite rich. The hotel claimed that meals will be collected at 10:30. When I went to find out at 9:30 that the yogurt had been taken out, the waiter replied that the yogurt would not be replenished once the yogurt was taken out. Therefore, breakfast is not really served at 10:30, it may be at 9:30.

The hotel's welcome gift package is beer, potato chips, and a junk food gift package, which is quite unexpected.

There is also an afternoon tea. The hotel stipulates that it must be used on-site during the specified time in the afternoon and cannot be taken away, which is a bit inflexible.

The front desk said they didn't have it. Then I looked at my phone and booked I had a twin room. I went to the front desk and explained the situation to him. They changed me to the east room. As soon as I entered the room, there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke. Before I checked in, I signed that I was not allowed to smoke in the room. Why was there a smell of cigarette smoke? The waiter asked My answer was that I had rhinitis and I couldn't tell. They even gave me air freshener and even an air purifier. They didn't change my room. Finally, I called the front desk and asked if they would change my room. I complained to you about the room, and then you changed the room for me. I was dissatisfied with the hotel's service. The front desk deceived me, causing me to go back and forth several times. The problem was that I was traveling with an 80-year-old man with bad feet. I asked the hotel how to solve this problem.

msg:This is my first hotel tour this year. I stayed at the InterContinental International Exhibition Center not far away last year (and was banned shortly after I got home). I stayed at the Crowne Plaza this year. The price is much cheaper, but in all aspects It can be compared with Intercontinental.
The subway is very convenient and can be reached on 2/10/17. In the subway, you can go all the way from the underground passage to Hongqiao Tiandi, and then pass through the underground of Hongqiao Tiandi. You can walk underground all the way without going outdoors.

The executive room I live in is quite big. Outside the window, I can see the busy departure and arrival of the high-speed rail at Hongqiao Railway Station, as well as the departure and landing of flights at Hongqiao Airport. Because it is so close, the view is quite shocking, and I can see the huge s plane.
The executive room includes administrative courtesy, breakfast and afternoon tea HH, which can be said to be very rich, especially HH, it is a simple buffet, it can‚Äôt be called a simple meal, there are many delicious dishes, and the combination of meat and vegetables is very good. The HH in this restaurant is much more delicious than the InterContinental next door, but the breakfast is weaker than the InterContinental. There are not too many items, but the taste is still online.
Speaking of the room, one problem is that there is no shelf for suitcases, and large suitcases have to be placed on the ground, which is troublesome to carry things. The executive room I live in does not have a bathtub. After all, Crowne Plaza focuses on business. The cleanser is a Borghese big bottle, which is very easy to use, and I have used it in the Crowne Plaza in Suzhou before. In the bedroom, the bed is very comfortable, not too soft, and has a certain degree of support. Even if you have an elderly person who loves a hard bed, it is acceptable. There is just one problem. There is no program list on the TV, and there is no channel number on the TV. I am confused when I watch it directly. I don‚Äôt know how to use this TV at all... Just watch it at night...
Overall, a very good value hotel that can be recommended

msg:A relatively bad experience
Good things: breakfast is rich and tastes good
On the negative side, a few complaints made me very disappointed with the Crown brand:
1. Arrive at 10 pm and leave at 11 am the next day. At both times, there is no one in the foyer. The hotel door is not automatic, so you have to drag the big box with one hand and push the heavy glass door with the other, which is very embarrassing;
2. The room temperature is low - I live in a corner room with large floor-to-ceiling glass on both sides. The air conditioner is turned on to the maximum. After an hour, the thermometer on the indoor electronic meter is still 20 degrees. In the past few days, the temperature in Shanghai has been low, and the outdoor temperature is 0 degree or so;
3. Slow response to the problem - I called the front desk at 11 o'clock in the evening and asked the master to check the air conditioner. When I called the second time to urge me, I asked for two more bath towels. As a result, the aunt who delivered the bath towels came, and no one to check the air conditioner arrived;
4. The solution to the problem was average - they changed our room at 12 o'clock in the evening and said it was an upgrade to an executive room. I was quite happy at first. But after actually seeing the room, the gap is quite big. The room size and room type are the same as the superior twin room I booked myself. Compared with Ctrip, it should be the superior double room;
5. The room booked in advance is 85 yuan more expensive than the one booked on the day - I placed the order at 1.6, more than 20 days in advance, but when I arrived at the hotel that night, I found that it was 85 yuan more expensive. Although that is a package price, and although hotel room prices are variable, it is understandable, but from the perspective of ordinary consumers, it is very bad! From a hotel professional perspective, as a well-known high-end chain brand, it is really amateurish. Booking in advance is more favorable than booking on the same day. This is the basic common sense of hotel revenue management. Booking on the same day and reducing prices can only be achieved by low-end hotels that don‚Äôt understand pricing. The price difference between the package price and booking 20 days in advance is 85. In addition to not understanding the revenue management, there is also a problem with the business idea. For this kind of business-type hotel, it is quite good to have this kind of package price like a resort hotel. Judging from this unprofessionalism, the complaints above are understandable. In addition, if I were the front desk and met a guest who had booked a high-priced room in advance at 22:00 in the evening, in order to avoid trouble, I would take the initiative to help upgrade the room. The original room still needs to be visible to the naked eye.
Overall, except for the breakfast, which was in line with expectations, other aspects were disappointing. It reflects that there is still a lot of room for improvement in terms of service level and professional capabilities of this hotel.
p.s. It‚Äôs quite unexpected that hotels near Hongqiao don‚Äôt provide free airport pick-up service.

msg:Arrived at 1:30 pm, no room available. Those who checked in after 2 o'clock bought a package and gave it to the main building
The direction given is good. You can see the whole Hongqiao Tiandi with a wide view
After moving in, I couldn‚Äôt watch the TV at first, but the master came to adjust the channel. After a while, I could watch it.
Checked in in the afternoon and did not find any air conditioning problems
But after the sun goes down, the room feels a bit cold
I went to adjust the air conditioner and found that it was limited. Only the circulation function can adjust the temperature, but even if it is turned up to 28 degrees, the room is still not warm
The staff at the front desk said they could call an air conditioner to come and check it.
But I don't think it's convenient for a girl
The front desk said that the heater can be sent
But I don't think this solves the problem
So I proposed to change the room?
The front desk was very good and helped me change to a room on the same floor
But when I changed the room for the first time, I was wearing a mask, and there was still an obvious smell of smoke.
So I changed to another one, which was much better and the heating was enough.
Also upgraded the room type
I'm still very satisfied with this, the attitude of the little brother at the front desk is also good
All my requests are met
Of course I'm also reasonable
A few days later, I also received a call from the hotel staff, expressing their apologies for not having a comfortable check-in experience and asking if they will come to check in again.
Such a return visit is still very good
Package includes afternoon tea and dinner
I didn't go to the afternoon tea, so I can't comment
The dinner is good, there are not many dishes, about 5-6 stir-fried, but the taste is good, you can definitely eat
Good breakfast, many choices, both Western and Chinese
The restaurant staff is also polite and polite, and they are also very active in closing the plates
The bath water in the room is also large, the water temperature is stable, and the toiletries are good
Overall, I am satisfied with the service

When choosing a hotel before the trip, I saw a comment saying that the breakfast was good. After checking in, I found that the breakfast was really good. I have stayed in Crowne Plaza hotels in various cities in China. There are several. The breakfast at Crowne Plaza Shanghai Hongqiao can be ranked in the top two. What is even more surprising is that the complimentary happy hour is equivalent to a buffet dinner. Although there are few varieties, the taste of the dishes is very good. My wife is very picky about food. The only regret is that due to time conflicts, we did not enjoy the complimentary afternoon tea. This stay was very pleasant. We decided that if we go to Shanghai during the Chinese New Year next year, we will stay at Crowne Plaza Shanghai Hongqiao Jinchen again.

There are only three kinds of lettuce, four kinds of fruits, meat including salami, salmon, mackerel, sliced mushroom sausage, sliced black pepper beef, three kinds of salad juice (Caesar, thousand island, oil vinaigrette) with several kinds of grains and nuts Dried fruit; more than a dozen cold and hot dishes, and a variety of small pickles with three kinds of porridge; hot drinks include soy milk, black tea, and coffee, and freshly squeezed cold drinks are only watermelon juice and yogurt. Generally speaking, the variety is rich and there are many choices. The bread should be made by the hotel itself. The overall taste is good, especially the crispy ones. It is worth mentioning that two types of cheese are provided, which is rare in buffet breakfasts at the same price of. Although the skin of the pan-fried buns is a bit thick, and the bottom is already very dark due to the long time of storage in the pot, it tastes burnt and the overall taste is not bad. In addition, the mackerel and smoked salmon taste good, and the supply is relatively timely. Breakfast ends at 10:30, and until the meal is about to close, the kitchen is also replenishing dishes at any time, which is worth learning from many hotels.

msg:It is a hotel with first-class facilities and "first-rate service". I don't know if it is due to Crowne Plaza's own training issues or because Shanghainese just look down on us from other places. The service level and work attitude of the hotel staff are extremely bad. I severely criticized and complained to the front desk supervisor. "Mr. Gao Gang" and "Ms. Wang Jin" at the all-day dining restaurant. The check-in at the front desk is messy and there is no clear queuing guide. You try to queue, but people keep jumping in the queue. The employees at the front desk are also novices. What? They don't understand that. It takes a long time to process a customer's check-in procedure. The guests are all dissatisfied and impatient. The senior manager Gao Gang is used to big scenes. He stands aside as if it has nothing to do with him and has no motivation at all. Help his staff, maintain order, or appease the guests. No, the cardboard people are better than him. It's a terrible stay experience. I stayed for two nights and left the hotel early today by taking the high-speed rail. I think at 6:26 I went to see if I could have some breakfast or ask for two steamed buns to eat in the car. Ms. Wang Jin didn‚Äôt know if she was unhappy because she had to work the early morning shift. She was so angry about getting up that I felt so embarrassed. She said breakfast would be at 6:30. It just started. I was 4 minutes early and was not allowed to eat. OK, but hotel breakfast is allowed to be packed, but she couldn't do this or that. Finally, she asked me to sign a liability agreement. Okay, I signed it, and then she still He said no, it was wrong, and he didn't say what was right. He didn't show any help in solving the problem. He didn't even say a smile or a good tone. Every sentence he said was rushed to his head. It was a waste of more than ten minutes for me. I can't even eat breakfast. Well, finally, I want to say that the room I booked includes breakfast. I paid for it, so I'm not asking for your charity.

If I can't get out, I find a hotel to squat
Convenient parking with direct elevator
I live in the administrative building
so quiet
Overall, I am very satisfied. For dinner, the food and beverage depar**ent heated the food for us and sent ice cubes.
Point deduction
Facilities: The central air conditioner in the room is too hot
We drank 10+ mineral water in total üòÇüòÇüòÇ
It's hot in the middle of the night and I can't help but sleep naked
It is good for Yangkang patients to cover their sweat. It's just a dry mouth all the time.
There is a bathtub in the room, but the bathtub bag is not provided, and an additional charge of 18 yuan is required.
I brought one myself. I think the hotel can be fully prepared for staying in the hotel. Will be more attentive!
The parking before leaving üÖøÔ∏è makes me a little confused
Because we checked out at 14, we went to the opposite mall to have lunch ‚ûï watched a movie
Before I left, I asked the concierge if I could pay the parking fee when I left. The concierge said yes.
We left at 18:17, that is, stopped for 4 hours
If the concierge informs you earlier that you need to pay for more than 24 hours, I will stop at the mall opposite.
Consumption in the shopping mall opposite can be deducted for 4 hours of parking
Although 39 is not a lot of money, but this detail is not good at all~~~

msg:The package with executive benefits was booked only after seeing good reviews, but when I checked in, I was told that the lounge buffet afternoon tea and Happy hour had been cancelled, because there were not enough people for sheep, and now they are all delivered to the room. Then I asked if it would be changed to an afternoon tea set and a light meal in the evening. The girl at the front desk told me seriously that it was self-help... I said how can you help yourself after you have delivered the room? She said that all varieties should be given, so I asked if I could give as many as I wanted? She said ok, just call the front desk. When it was time for afternoon tea at 2:30, I called the front desk and asked if there was anything I could choose, and the answer was that I didn't know! Then a piece of cake was sent over! It's a piece! There is not even any fruit. I saw it on the dining car, but I asked and said it was not ours! It's really funny, it's so shabby to send some afternoon tea in such a big hotel! Besides, it should be self-service, so I have nothing to say if you send a set meal as well. This cake was sent so far away, it was exposed outside without any cover! This is the most basic service with no sense at all! After calling Ctrip to complain, the front desk administrator came to apologize and asked what else needs to be added! I asked you what you didn't know, even if you transferred to the restaurant, you said you didn't know! The cake delivered is the same as opening a blind box, it is different every time! It's also very embarrassing to give them away as if they were begging for them! There is one thing to say, Ctrip's service is very good, it can stand on the customer's point of view for the sake of customers, and propose solutions, which is why I have been using Ctrip for so many years. But even the compensation is very uncomfortable. Thanks to Ctrip for helping me get fruits and orange juice for the children... Is dinner a box lunch? Staff meal? It's still pitifully small... probably because I want you to eat as much as you can with plain rice. If I had known this, why would I order this? Come so far and then go back? It is also very troublesome to change hotels with children and find a hotel, but I have no choice but to accept Ctrip's plan. In special times, since there are not enough manpower, don't take orders at all. The hotel needs to make money, and the service can't keep up! You can simply inform the date and date in advance to cancel the executive buffet in the lounge and let the guests choose, don't say it until you arrive! I have repeatedly emphasized that it is self-help! Self help? Box lunch buffet? I can't bear to give more than 3 dishes! The hotel has a rich breakfast and a lot of staff. I don't understand how difficult it is to set up an afternoon tea set? What about making some sandwiches with the existing toast? Don't send unthawed hard cakes! I thought the only extra points for the breakfast buffet turned out to be a few hairs in the endü§ÆThe gym is very simple, not like the standard of the crown, but like a Holiday Inn! In short, it was probably because I booked at the wrong time, which made the hotel difficult!

This time, I saw that Ctrip has a package, and ordered an ordinary superior room to give an executive courtesy. Because of the epidemic, I couldn't go out to Shanghai, so I decided to bring my family to stay for one night.
Executive courtesy (happy hour & afternoon tea): There are 4 types of cakes, as well as delicious Chinese dim sum spring rolls. Soft drinks include orange juice sparkling water cola coffee and various tea bags. The variety is not very rich, but the taste is good. I ate 5 spring rolls.
The executive courtesy in the evening is from 5:30 to 8:00. The dishes are rich in meat, fish and chicken wings, and the taste is also very good. At 7 o'clock, the hotel will also serve new varieties of dishes, which is also very conscientious. If you have a small appetite, you can eat it completely.
The breakfast at this hotel is also very good. I especially recommend the pot stickers, they are really delicious. Because of the epidemic, if breakfast is included in the room rate, you can pack it back to your room to eat. Coffee can also be taken away. Still very human.

When checking out normally, we only need to put the room card at the front desk and leave, restore the conversation content, hello, hello! When we check out, can we just put the room card here? Reply: My last name is not Hello, you need to queue up. Please take the card back. He didn't look at us the whole time. Another tall waiter next to me is signing in at this time. Sir, please go to the queue first, that's all. I confirmed again that I was just returning the room card and replied that you should queue up first. I decisively went to the front desk and queued up with a young man at the end. About five minutes later, he came to me. I said I would like to ask a question. If I want to check out, I can just put the room card here and leave. Do I need to queue up to return the room card? ? The response I got was positive. You can return the room card directly without queuing. We will do it directly when we are free. You can just put down the room card and leave. I replied and asked the other two front desk staff why they asked me to queue up to return the room card. The young man was a little angry when he saw me and replied asking our manager to apologize to you in the afternoon. Haven't received any explanation call yet.
This is the first time I have encountered such five-star hotel service, so business people please proceed with caution.

Next door to Hyatt Place checkin and breakfast have to queue up. Crown is much less crowded and quiet.

I thought it would be better if I turned on the air conditioner for a while, but the windows were closed and could not be opened for ventilation. It was really unbearable. At 1 in the morning I ordered an old and dusty purifier, which was ineffective. The Gonghe front desk told the seriousness of the problem three times in the early morning, early in the morning, and before leaving the store, but no one followed up to solve it. The child choked and coughed in the middle of the night, and the hotel management and supervision almost lost control. How the room with such serious problems was "smoothly" handed over to the tenant was really disappointing. The quality of the Crown room was actually a matter of luck. Leaving I complained to the Intercontinental Headquarters Hotel before anyone followed up. It was the first bad review in recent years! It is recommended that those who choose non-smoking rooms should confirm with the hotel in advance and ask them to check it themselves. Although the service of the reservation depar**ent is good, it cannot withstand a disappointing room check-in experience! Bad review!

We waited at the front desk for half an hour before we started to check in (I had just gotten off the high-speed train and was very tired and already impatient). There was only one staff member at the front desk of such a large hotel. Not only did no one call us to check in, but also It kept ringing and no one answered (at that time, a guest complained to the front desk that he was thirsty. The front desk said that the colleague who provided drinks was off work and could not provide it. The guest insisted on having something to drink, so he took out two bottles of water. At this time, his impression of the hotel service was... Not so good anymore)
2. The hygienic surface looks good. At first glance, it seems very clean, but in fact the hygienic condition is very poor. a. There are mold spots at the joints of the tiles. b. I wiped the corners of the water on the washbasin with a cloth and it turned out to be black ( Very dark) c. The bathroom stinks like a sewer and there are mold spots on the seams d. The carpet is also dirty e. There are water stains on the toilet seat
3. I ordered takeout in the evening and wanted to ask the front desk to help deliver it. Sure enough, the front desk and the guest service center couldn't get through at all. I called for a long time and was told that I couldn't help pick up the takeout and there was no robot to deliver the food. This hotel is quite big. From the room to the front desk The road is already a bit far, but the takeout can only be placed in the takeout cabinet outside the hotel, and the hotel is not allowed to put it there (which is quite outrageous).

The hotel service was also very good for three days of stay. I recommend the Chinese restaurant in the hotel, which is very good.

What I want to complain about is the restaurant. The buffet dinner in the set menu is less than the buffet breakfast. There is no seafood. I can only say that you get what you pay for, and you have enough food. . During breakfast, the child's toy Xingdailu accidentally fell behind the seat (in the middle of the aisle), and then the staff of a cafeteria walked over like this, such a big toy was in the middle of the road, as if he hadn't seen it. , in a five star hotel, this should not happen. There is no service at all, no service awareness, and training should be strengthened.

I called the hotel for consultation before I checked in. I didn't know if it was the front desk. The attitude was very bad. It felt more like I was expressing my emotions freely.
After checking in and extending my stay, I wanted to ask the hotel to borrow a yoga mat to use in the room. They said they couldn‚Äôt borrow it and would call me back to the room later. I didn‚Äôt even wait for the phone call the next day and went to the front desk to inquire. Finally, I asked the manager to apply and get one for me. Yoga mat. (At least I didn‚Äôt respond to everything)



Hotel breakfast rating:
Rich, fresh and delicious. The staff's attitude is also very good, and the breakfast they had during these few days during the business trip was particularly good!


Hotel hygiene environment evaluation:
Just after checking in, there were a few orange booklets on the table in the room. After I moved them away, there were still uncleaned melon seeds...


The concierge who needs special praise is a fair-skinned and thin intern girl from Henan. She is very nice, very considerate, and has a very good and positive work attitude. Because I sent express delivery to the hotel, she helped bring all these items to the room on a trolley. Then she helped me unpack them one by one with my permission in person. Finally, she collected all the packaged garbage on the trolley and took it away. . I also met her when I stayed later, and she greeted me warmly, and was very proactive in helping me solve any problems I had. Worthy of praise! It adds to the overall impression of the hotel!

msg:Due to the epidemic, it has been inconvenient to travel abroad in recent years. Therefore, I like to book some well-received hotels in this city and surrounding areas on Ctrip for a few days with my family as a vacation, and I especially like the hotel packages that include executive benefits. This time, according to the evaluation, I chose Crowne Plaza Shanghai Hongqiao Jinchen for the first time to experience the hotel's facilities, services and food. The overall feeling is very good, newly renovated, the room is spacious and bright, and the bathroom is large; from the lobby to the room service, the service staff are all kind and hospitable, especially the front desk attendant Mr. Phoenix (Phoenix) gave us a very warm heart Suggestions and reasonable arrangements; the hotel has convenient transportation and free parking for the guests; the breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. The only regret is that the executive lounge on the second floor has been closed recently, and the executive courtesy (happy hour & afternoon tea) has been moved to the bar on the first floor. Reduce the quality due to price concessions, otherwise the discount will become an attractive gimmick. The overall feeling is very good! Especially the service.

msg:We have never had such an outrageous check-in experience. We were on the high-speed train at 6:50 the next day, so we arrived at the hotel more than 9:00 a night earlier for check-in. Because I have to take an international flight later, there are three very heavy big boxes. No one welcomes you when you get off the car, and even less help with luggage. There is only a middle-aged uncle wearing a hotel uniform at the door to check the nucleic acid. It is inconvenient for me to enter the door. They won't push the door open for me first. OK I need a breakfast at 6:00 in the morning, and I asked the front desk three times, but they said no, I need it at 6:30, I asked if there is any way to help us solve it, the answer is no, we still asked another employee for help I only got breakfast the next day. When I went upstairs, I wanted to find a hotel staff to help with my luggage. I was told that there was no one in the concierge after get off work! ? Would you like to hear what you are saying? Does the hotel concierge leave work at 9:30? ok The room is well-equipped, clean and tidy. The price is right. During the office period, I needed the waiter to help me with takeout. He replied that I needed to go downstairs to get it myself. I saw and heard it when I checked in. The little brother at the front desk took the takeaway and asked another employee to deliver it upstairs. For some reason, it was not allowed on my side. After checking in, I told the front desk that I have a piece of clothing that needs to be washed and dried. I asked the hotel again and told me that the laundry room is also closed. If I attend a business event, will I need this piece of clothing tomorrow? OK, I can only wash it by hand and dry it with a hair dryer. The smoke alarm is triggered due to the excessive water vapor, which affects the rest of the people around me. I am sorry. The most outrageous thing is that no one contacted me 5 minutes after the smoke alarm was triggered. Or deal with it, because the noise is really harsh and harsh, I called the front desk, and it stopped after 5 minutes of ringing, and then no one came to confirm the situation during the whole process. I would like to ask if there is a fire or any unexpected situation, How do you ensure the safety of your guests, based on your reaction speed without movement for 5 minutes? Really disappointed with this hotel and won't have the chance to stay again in the future.

Can I change to a larger bed? , the man on duty at the front desk at 4.50pm on the 11th refused directly. Later I asked if it was possible or the room was full. He replied that the room was relatively tense. I didn't want to affect my mood when I responded with this tone and look. I originally wanted to complain directly to the headquarters. My husband said not to affect my mood, but later the female front desk officer on duty was replaced. The overall front desk service was 0 points.

He has no ability to solve problems and is good at creating problems. As a hotel window front desk service, it needs to be improved.

Positive reviews: The team leader and service staff who were on duty at 4pm on the 11th on the second floor of the restaurant had very good attitudes. In particular, the team leader had a strong sense of service and was very detail-oriented. When the table was full, he immediately signaled to his colleagues to collect the items. The best impression of staying in this hotel is the service staff who stayed at the afternoon tea on the second floor. This is awesome.

It took two room adjus**ents before it became normal. Fortunately, the attitude of the service staff is okay. Afternoon tea was due to traffic jam at 6:00 and we didn't get to the room until 9:00.

Jenny and Alisa gave me good advice and arranged a corner room for me in the administrative building. Due to the late night check-in, the parking lot was not easy to find. After entering the lobby Ava and Vanessa, the little girls on night shift, received me very warmly and guided me to the location of the room and the hotel. The room is very spacious, bright and transparent. The comfort of the bathroom is very good compared to other hotels. The view from the corner room in the high area is very good and beyond my expectations. When checking out, it happened to be a quick and convenient check out during the off-peak period, and the concierge Molly service was also very good, giving parking relief and guiding the location of the parking lot. If I have the opportunity to go on vacation again, I will choose this room type. I look forward to every stay with such high quality~

It is a hotel under the banner of InterContinental, so you can rest assured. It is very close to Hongqiao Tianjie and Hongqiao Tiandi, it is very convenient to go out at night and there are few people. Upgraded us to the city view room, the hotel facilities are still very new, and the service is good.
The breakfast is not too rich, but it tastes good. Like a capsule coffee in the room. Brands for washing are also good.

I went to the store at 11 a.m. and said that the room was being cleaned and waited for a while. As a result, it took 1 hour after I waited. Then wait for a while, another hour has passed, and it turned out to be another while, I will tell the front desk to clean the room and send the luggage to the room, I have completed the procedures, and the credit card pre-authorization has to be swiped. Back at night, the luggage is still in the lobby! The most disgusting thing is that there was hair on the head of the private part of the bed in the room I just checked in. At that time, it was more than 10 o'clock in the evening. I told the hotel staff to ask to change the sheets. I waited for 40 minutes and changed after 11 o'clock, and the movement was invincible. , We just called the front desk to spit out a few words, because it was very late, we took a break, the most weird thing came, one came from a manager of the hotel, and said that the time was too late and we would give one the next day Say, let‚Äôs not say that we stayed for 3 days and no staff came to us to explain and deal with it. I want to ask the manager who called, if you don‚Äôt sleep in the middle of the night and don‚Äôt disturb the rest of the guests! You said that we must give a satisfactory statement the next day and we all left the store and didn't see you or received your call!

The location is close to the airport and the railway station. I walked from Hongqiao Railway Station on foot. It takes only six or seven minutes to take a taxi from the hotel to the airport terminal. It is next to Hongqiao Tiandi. It is very convenient for eating and shopping.
The room is large, the sanitation is very good, it is clean, the bed is large, the mattress is soft and comfortable, there is a bathtub, and the bathroom space is large. The design is separated from dry and wet üâë
The breakfast is very rich, both Chinese and Western styles, even salmon and miso soup, etc. You must try the pan-fried. It's really delicious.
The room is soundproofed and the service is also very nice!
(The toiletries are big bottles of Borghese, but the hotel towels are a bit general)
Overall the price is very high!

msg:I made a reservation for the invoice and water bill the night before check-out. As a result, the water bill was issued without a stamp, and he was told that he would not be able to come to work until 8 o'clock. In the end, they could only ask them to mail it, or pay on delivery. The hotel's fault cost me 20 yuan.

msg:First, the bathroom is very slippery as long as there is water. Can I change to slippers? Second, I was very angry when eating breakfast. No one told me that I couldn't wear slippers in the past. It was very annoying to be stopped by the waiter at the door because we lived in the other half and it would be troublesome to go back. How can I wear high heels if I don‚Äôt have slippers when I eat early in the morning? I‚Äôm speechless.

msg:The comfortable oversized bed, the attentive service of the lady with glasses in the restaurant, the brand-new equipment, and the quiet environment will give you a five-star praise.
But because of the work error of the staff at the bar, they forgot to ask for a deposit with me during the day, and the two guest rooms at 9 and 11 at night, eager to ask for the deposit, completely broke my sleep and almost killed me. The child wakes up.
Is this something such a hotel should do that disturbs guests so much? I hope that this employee will not be held accountable, just a good training!
