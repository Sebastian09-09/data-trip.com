msg:Pros : 
- The main advantage of this hotel is the location near the river. It is very peaceful and the view is great. 
- Bedroom is OK and well equiped
- The balcony with a view on the river is perfect at night. It would have been good to have a chair or something on the balcony... 
- Breakfast is good but not as good as other Hilton hotels i stayed in China. 

Cons : 
- Furniture and equipment are dated. A refresh of the hotel is urgently needed. 
- Air condition was not working. We put air-con at 20 degrees and it was much more hot inside the room than outside, even if it was more than 25 outside !
- Check-in took half and hour ! Hotel did a mistake and prepared 2 rooms for us, while we only booked 1 room. We had to get help from a Chinese friend to do the check-in. This is not acceptable for an international hotel. 

I chose this hotel because it is close to my relatives house, but it is far from Hilton standards. I will not come to this hotel anymore until a refresh is done. I prefer to stay in a better hotel and take taxi everyday. The price is similar to others hotels in Nanjing (Shangri-La, Hilton Nanjing...) that are much better.

A wonderful river view
A spacious room

Cons: 
The hotel is very old and tired and in urgent need of renovation. The check-in took ages because the front desk lady apparently saw a foreign passport for the first time. I was given a room without a bathtub despite my booking, luckily the front desk agreed to change it. There was no bathrobe, toothbrush etc for the child. Doormen didn't help with the car door nor with the luggage, they just stood there and watched  (whatever for? ).

The only thing this hotel has in common with 5 stars is its name.

- there was no mug in the room, so it was hard to put hot water

2. I used the hotel's restaurant and signed my name before coming out.
The manager held me accountable on the hotel phone around 10 p.m.
The reason is why I didn't pay immediately.
I just followed the instructions of your hotel staff.
Why hold the guest accountable?
Why should a guest do what a hotel staff should do?
What is the hotel's system?

3. I don't recommend this hotel

She also showed me the packaging of the rice dumpling gift box. Hilton's gift box packaging is indeed very different this time with a purple combination, and it is also very cost-effective.

The room was a bit dark, but the balcony view was really beautiful, clean and hygienic. The hotel staff was very considerate. They called in advance to ask about my needs and helped me arrange the room. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Nanjing.

msg:On the first day, we booked a yellow duck themed children's room. The child was very happy, but the carpet in the room was a little dirty. The baby's feet turned black after running.
Many customers unconsciously took their children to run in the corridor until 11:30 in the middle of the night. When taking children out, should we try not to disturb others' rest? (This has nothing to do with the hotel and is purely personal quality)
Facilities: The only problem is that there is no main light. It is still dim when all the lights in the room are turned on.

msg:April is the most beautiful month in the world. I took advantage of the bright and sunny weekend and took my baby to Nanjing for a self-driving trip. As for the hotel, I chose my favorite Hilton Hotel. It has the most unique natural scenery. The riverside and the city are picturesque, with red flowers, green willows, clear water and blue sky. It is like a paradise in the city. The surrounding supporting facilities are complete, including supermarkets and special pubs. It is especially suitable for family travel to relax. Convenient parking. There are plenty of parking spaces in the underground garage. You can go directly to the elevator to the lobby to check in. Because I was in a hurry to travel, I contacted Miss Li Bei from the Guest Service Center with a try-and-see attitude. Even if I was on vacation, I called her and arranged my favorite room in minutes. After checking in quickly, I arrived at the room. It was a different world. The windows were clean and the hygiene was impeccable. It was on the highest floor, with the best view, the most complete facilities, the fastest network, the largest area, the softest bedding, and the deepest sleep. The next day, breakfast was served in the western restaurant on the second floor. It was a buffet, rich and diverse, fresh and delicious, a combination of Chinese and Western cuisines. Without leaving the hotel, you can taste authentic Nanjing snacks and start a day full of energy. I came here with excitement and left with satisfaction. Here, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my housekeeper and good friend, Miss Li Bei. She has a gentle voice, sincere hospitality and kindness. During the two days, she responded to all requests and helped to arrange the printing of children's homework in minutes without charging a penny. On the night of check-in, welcome fruits were delivered as soon as possible. They were fresh and nutritious. I was lucky enough to see the exquisite river view in the building and tasted a rich and happy time. Everything was the most attentive hospitality. After I checked out, Miss Li Bei did not forget to send me souvenirs. The gift was small but the sentiment was great. She sincerely invited me to come again, to welcome and see off, and to collect my stay experience. It started well and ended well. There was a give and take. Once again, it added icing on the cake for our trip to Nanjing. 5-star praise ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

I almost didn't sleep all night. I called the front desk in the morning to change the room inside. The soundproofing was still not good. The neighbors kept talking and closing the door. It was really torture. It's not worth spending a thousand yuan for such a hotel. I obviously want to have a good rest and relax. I will never stay here again.

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first.
1. The location is invincible and the scenery is great. 2. Convenient parking and spacious underground. 3. Standard service of a five-star hotel.

Let me complain a few more times.
1. The facilities are outdated. Whether it is the elevator or the room, the TV is covered with snow when it is turned on.
2. There is a problem with the drainage in the bathroom, and there is a peculiar smell. There is also a smell in the toilet.
3. The breakfast restaurant is too small, the stalls are not enough, and it is crowded and chaotic.

In addition, I especially complain about the front desk service. I booked two breakfasts. When I checked in, I was told that another guest needed to register his identity before two breakfast coupons could be issued (paper, I haven't seen it for a long time). Later, my colleague didn't come, so forget it. Putting aside the registration requirements of other depar**ents, since I booked two breakfasts and paid the fees, I need to be given two breakfast coupons (can I eat two meals?), and whether to force registration can be solved through other means such as access control.
From the perspective of the guest, I paid the corresponding price, but did not get the corresponding service and products, and the hotel tried to force the guest to obey certain requirements by deducting the guest's service. I personally don't understand and agree with this management style and method.

Of course, the view from the balcony is unbeatable. You can enjoy the evening breeze, look at the river, and have a glass of wine. It is really enjoyable.

msg:The hotel is adjacent to the Yangtze River and overlooks the estuary of the Qinhuai River. I personally think it is the best place to enjoy the river view in Nanjing. Hilton is a five-star hotel among five-star hotels. The rooms are smartly designed, neat and clean. The spacious balcony is a pleasant surprise. The lights are shining brightly after sunset. Boats crossing the Yangtze River occasionally sound their whistles. In the morning, I am awakened by birds. I see the geese flying north and the hawks and eagles foraging. This kind of scenery has never been seen elsewhere.
The breakfast is nutritious, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows of the second-floor restaurant can see the large green plants outside. Fortunately, we encountered the rain in Nanjing, and we could enjoy the rain while eating delicious food. It was such a happy experience.
No matter how good the hardware is, the staff's enthusiasm and professional service may be better. Thank you to the switchboard Sabrina for delaying my check-out. Mr. Yang Xi is attentive and considerate, and his service style is warm and welcoming. I can deeply feel the beauty of staying at Hilton, which left a deep impression on me.

I noted a high floor when I booked, and the hotel replied and agreed. However, I was still given a room on the 4th floor when I checked in. After communication, I was moved to the 9th floor;
The bathroom and toilet equipment are a little old. The bathroom was blocked on the first day and it was not easy to drain. It was solved on the second day;

The Shimao Riverside Hotel is the most cost-effective. First of all, the hotel is in a quiet location, adjacent to the Yangtze River, with unique scenery, red flowers and green willows. The weather in Nanjing was sunny these two days, and the sky was blue every day. I took a walk on the pedestrian bridge and felt the river breeze. The hotel has complete facilities and equipment, and fitness and swimming are free. The breakfast is rich and delicious. You can taste Nanjing's special snacks without leaving home, especially the duck blood vermicelli soup, which tastes authentic. The service is people-oriented and considerate. I have a deep memory of Miss Li Bei from the guest service center and have a good impression of her. She has a sweet voice, a sincere attitude, and is enthusiastic. We met by phone by chance. Although there were some minor episodes, she was able to resolve them with sincerity in the first time.

I decisively placed an order. After checking in, I really felt very good. Standard Hilton star hotel service, this is naturally needless to say, mainly because the view of the hotel is great, the Qinhuai River enters the river mouth, the green water and clear waves of the Qinhuai River bank nearby, and the wide rolling Yangtze River in the distance. All this is not seen through the French windows, but there is a large balcony! Blowing the night spring breeze at night, I feel relaxed and happy. The room is clean and tidy, the bedding is comfortable, and it is quiet at night. The hotel is fully equipped, equipped with a free fitness swimming pool, and parking is also free. Miss Li Bei from the guest service center provided full butler service, which was very meticulous.

After comparing accommodation through multiple channels, I finally decided on the Shimao Hilton Riverside Hotel, which is the most cost-effective. The hotel has a quiet environment, surrounded by green plants, flowers are blooming, cherry blossoms and camellias are in full bloom, green willows are hanging down, and the branches are luxuriant. It is close to the intersection of the Yangtze River and the Yangtze River, and the 180-degree boundless river view is unobstructed. It is an image of spring. The hotel facilities are well-equipped, the underground garage is large, and there are ample parking spaces. You don‚Äôt have to worry about waiting for a seat during peak periods. Area C is equipped with tram charging piles, which is good news for trams. We took the tram elevator to the lobby on the first floor to check in. We were attracted by the hotel's elegant yet gorgeous decoration. The staff were enthusiastic and took the initiative to greet guests. The check-in express was efficient and we arranged the room we wanted. The room is chic, fresh, spacious, bright, clean, tidy, well-lit and well-ventilated. The bathroom is equipped with a bathtub, which has been deeply disinfected and safe to use. The hotel is also considerately equipped with free disposable bathtub covers and bath salts. If necessary, call the guest service center and the robot will deliver it to your home in minutes. Intelligent AI service advanced. The hotel is equipped with a free gym and swimming pool. Take an hour to exercise and feel the joy of exercise. Finally, I would like to highlight that the service is very distinctive and people-oriented, especially Sister Li Bei from the guest service center. Although we have never met each other, the voice on the phone is friendly, enthusiastic, and thoughtful. Whenever you need a call, we will respond within minutes and the delivery will be timely. When you know that we are coming to travel, we will recommend travel carefully. Scenic spots and local delicacies thoughtfully helped us delay check-out. Finally, after check-out, he proactively contacted me to collect information about my stay experience. The service was like spring breeze from beginning to end, and made me feel at home. It was the icing on the cake for my father and I's trip to Nanjing. 5-star thumbs up‚≠ê

The river view is vast, everything is revived, the birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant. It has been rainy and rainy in Nanjing these days, which is a unique scene. The room is clean and tidy, the bedding is comfortable, and you get enough sleep. All leisure facilities, including fitness and swimming, are provided free of charge. The staff's service is warm and professional, and their attitude is thoughtful. Ms. Li Bei from the guest service center is so warm and considerate that we have met each other before. The call back is thoughtful and refreshing. I especially extended my stay. Five-star praise.

msg:As a five-star hotel, the price is relatively affordable. Although it is a bit far from the city center, it is convenient to buy food around. The rooms of Hilton Riverside are always large and the hygiene is acceptable. I upgraded the river view room for free. Although the business room and the river view room were the same price on that day, the hotel customer service added WeChat in advance and had a good attitude. They responded to and solved the guests' requests actively.

Disadvantages: 1. As a five-star hotel, there was no waiter at the door to help with the luggage. 2. The room called the front desk customer service to help deliver toiletries and other items, which was very delayed. It took many times to urge and even sent the wrong things. I asked for a shower cap, which was delivered in about an hour. We were almost asleep at 11 o'clock in the evening, and the robot came to deliver things. It was very speechless. 3. You need to sign a waiver agreement to open the balcony door. The waiter who came to open the door had a bad attitude and ignored her. She also had a stern face when asked about something.

msg:I have been paying attention to the Nanjing Shimao Riverside Hilton Hotel before the epidemic. For various reasons, I have not been able to check in as scheduled several times. This time I invited a friend and his wife to go to the Qixia Mountain Scenic Area in Nanjing and chose the Hilton Hotel. The executive king room did not disappoint me. Standing on the balcony and admiring the beautiful sunset is a must. The hotel generally conforms to the image of a big international brand. The transportation is inconvenient and there is no subway station nearby. However, there are many online taxis now, which is not a big problem. The hotel facilities and equipment are a bit old and the service is very good. Problems can be solved in time. For example, if the room provided does not meet the check-in requirements, the room can be quickly changed. The large bed and pillows are very comfortable, soft and fluffy. After a day of playing in the hotel, guests can fall asleep quickly. The disadvantage is that there is no toilet next to the bathroom. I hope the area where mobile phones are placed can be taken into consideration during the second renovation. The breakfast service area is quite good. There are not many breakfast varieties. The waiters are very qualified and can remember the ingredients that diners need. The two coffee machines are made quickly and the operation interface is easy to understand. It‚Äôs easy to understand, no need to wait in line, the front desk checks out instantly on the day of departure, and you can scan the QR code to get free parking, making your stay a satisfying one.

I called the front desk to open the door again, but the sunset had already set, which was a bit regretful.
There are many varieties of breakfast, and it would be perfect if the dining in the executive lounge were more diverse.
The waiters greeted me warmly. When I checked out, the concierge Xiao Tao asked me about my stay experience and also treated me warmly.
In short, it is indeed a Hilton. I will consider staying here again when I come to Nanjing.

I've been living here for a few days and I don't know why there isn't a bow boat on the river, not a single one? So I face the empty Yangtze River every day. The scenery from the balcony on the 10th floor should be good, and you can clearly see the lawn downstairs for the wedding. The afternoon tea in the executive lounge was nothing, but the dinner was good. The food was completely different on the two days. Of course, it was very demanding, but for me, it was no problem to be full. You can check out the Victory Crossing Memorial Hall next to it, which is also a 4a scenic spot. I walked around at night and found nothing. I originally wanted to walk to the ferry port. It is said that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is not far away, but I walked around in the dark and felt that I couldn't make it. Breakfast is average, but better than Xuanwu Hotel. The baby said that the swimming pool was not good, the water was cold and it felt unclean, and it was not as good as the swimming pool at the Xuanwu Hotel in front of me. The two families I stayed in in Nanjing this time each have their own pros and cons, so it‚Äôs hard to comment. But overall quite satisfied.

The housekeeping staff are also very polite and will greet you warmly when they meet in the corridor. There are quite a lot of varieties in the breakfast buffet, including duck blood vermicelli and candied taro balls. But the Western pastries are relatively delicious.

When I arrived, I found out that it was a luxurious room in the Xinyue Confinement Club on the fourth floor. Fortunately, it was a river-view room, but unfortunately the shipping waterway was on the Pukou side opposite Jiangzhou, so there was no scene of hundreds of rivalries competing for water. The room includes dinner and breakfast, the quality of salmon is good, the selection of small hot pot meat dishes is average, the barbecue seafood is acceptable, and beer and wine are included. The breakfast duck blood vermicelli soup is good.

I particularly liked the Riverside Hilton Hotel. The location is quiet, built along the river, an exclusive check-in place for enjoying the scenery, and convenient for travel. You can reach the bustling city center in 20 minutes by car. The national 5A scenic spot Yuejiang Tower is 2 kilometers away from the hotel. There are also large supermarkets and specialty restaurants with a dazzling array of delicacies nearby. The hotel lobby is fresh and elegant, with a pleasant fragrance. The front desk staff checks in in an orderly manner. There are also concierge colleagues who maintain order, deliver tea, and carry luggage in an orderly manner. When we arrived at the room, it was unique. The guest room was spacious in size, well lit, air-conditioned, and the temperature was suitable for high-speed internet, high-definition TV, bedding, comfortable, high-end pillows, multiple choices for sleep, and high-quality toiletries. They were branded in large sizes and convenient to use. The drawers are equipped with multi-functional chargers for worry-free travel. Now you can go outside the house. Seeing the bright moon in the sky filled with stars, I have good dreams and the moon is always full. Praise and recognition to Ms. Li Bei of the Guest Service Center. Although we have never met, the small reception desk conveys the primary purpose of the Hilton Hotel, hospitality, and introduces the hotel's business hours. She is a good hotel promotion ambassador. After we check out, she actively solicits my stay. Experience and cherish the guest's feelings. This trip is worthwhile. See you again at Hilton in Nanjing and meet again with 5 stars‚≠ê

3. The location is too remote, far away from scenic spots, and it is not convenient to take a taxi.
    The worst part of the experience is constantly asking for good reviews. Some people came to ask for good reviews after having breakfast, and called to ask for good reviews after checking out. Come on, you're a Hilton...

msg:The hotel is on the estuary where the Qinhuai River flows into the Yangtze River. The river view room has an excellent view. Unfortunately, the highest floor is only 13 floors. If it is higher, the view will be better. There is a riverside trail outside the hotel for running or cycling. Very close to the ferry, you can cross the river to Pukou.
The room area is large, the layout is reasonable, and the cloakroom and bathroom are convenient to use. The bathroom equipment is imported, with smooth water outlet and quick adjus**ent of water temperature. Mattresses and linens are comfortable and thick. Not far from the hotel, there is a vegetable market for local residents, where you can experience local breakfast and buy fruits. Lots of parking spaces. The room cleaning is very nice, take the initiative to say hello, and the room is cleaned. The room service menu is simple but adequate and cheap.
The rooms and corridors have a slight smell, and it's hard to tell whether it's detergent or musty. The receptionists at the front desk are all young people, which may be the reason why the hotel registration system is relatively complicated. It took about ten minutes to check in. There are two free 5100 bottles of water in the refrigerator, and there was no refill on the second day. I asked the room attendant and said that it was only given for one round.

During the three days and two nights of living, the service staff were very enthusiastic. The weather is very hot, there is a place for children to play on the first floor, where they can spend time, and the baby comes to play for a while every day. During this period, the baby lost the ice cream coupon when he checked in and was very frustrated. Leyla from the guest service center gave the baby an ice cream coupon. It was really great and gave the baby the same care as a family.

The reason may be that the hotel's air conditioner was turned off and it was too hot and too cold. I wanted to close the balcony door. After a while, the mirror on the wall was covered with water mist. Even the quilt felt wet. I mentioned it to the hotel and they said that they didn't. I couldn't help it because it was wet on the riverside. I called the waiter and it didn't solve the problem. My mother-in-law was not in good health and had been sick all year round. She stayed in this hotel for two nights and had to get up every hour every night. It was inconvenient for her to move around. As a result, my father-in-law also had to do it every day. I didn‚Äôt get enough rest after getting up for an hour, so I got sick. It was the first time I took my parents-in-law out. I didn‚Äôt expect it to be like this.

msg:I have to give a bad review!
With the Hilton hotel brand, no matter the facilities, services, environment, etc., it is not as good as an ordinary business hotel!
What's even more disgusting is that several rooms on the executive suite floor are rented out to pregnant women: there are so many cooking fumes, babies crying, and people coming and going, it's really like a village in the city! The manager‚Äôs thinking is really weird! It is also a talent to name an international high-end brand hotel like this!
I called the front desk several times but no one answered, and things were handled very slowly!
You have to wait and line up for breakfast!
This kind of hotel falsely advertises online and deceives consumers!
I hope everyone will not stay in this hotel, anyone who does will be angry!

msg:This Hilton is located at the confluence of the Qinhuai River and the Yangtze River. Although the facilities are not new, it is better than the scenery and service. The room has a balcony. You must stay in the river view room. If the weather is suitable, you can sit and enjoy the river view. Unfortunately, the air is a bit foggy this time. If the weather is fine, the sunset must be beautiful. The service staff of the hotel are very dedicated, especially the customer service Helen in the lobby is more attentive and enthusiastic, very dedicated. Since we didn't have any vacant rooms when we arrived in the morning, we left after leaving some of our luggage. She took the initiative to book a room and specially arranged for a good-quality welcome fruit to be delivered. When we were leaving, no one took the online car-hailing order at first, so she took the initiative to help to take a taxi together, and stayed with us at the door until we got a taxi ten minutes later. This kind of service spirit is also a manifestation of the hotel's competitiveness. It's a pity that the hotel's Chinese restaurant only serves set meals at night, and there is no way to order dishes, and the quality of the set meals is relatively poor. I hope the hotel can improve. Generally speaking, this hotel is still good, and I wish it better and better in the future.

Some people said, my family is inside, and the staff said you go in.
Then a woman at the back of the queue shouted: I have a diamond card, do I have to queue too? The staff immediately said: Diamond card, come inside and invite everyone!
Wow, 7.8 people went to the hospital again
Then, someone else walked in regardless, and the staff didn‚Äôt dare to stop them.

msg:Half an hour after checking in, I smelled a strong smell of urine in the toilet. I called the front desk and a female hygienist came for the first time. She took a mop and said it smelled bad. However, within half an hour there was a strong urine smell again, so I called the front desk and this time a maintenance man from the engineering depar**ent was sent to fix it. The maintenance staff said they were missing parts and coating materials. There was a gap behind the toilet that needed to be filled, otherwise the smell would come out from under the toilet. Half an hour later, two maintenance staff came with equipment and started to decorate the site:( It was already around 90 o'clock in the evening, and we needed to rest. Ten minutes later, they were still repairing. Is this a five-star Hilton hotel? Finally, we packed up all our unpacked luggage and moved to a different room: (The experience was also excellent.

When he saw us, he didn't help us with our luggage. When the car came, he didn't help us with the door. He just stood at the door. , I don‚Äôt understand what the meaning of the doorman is? There was a musty smell in the corridor of the room, and I didn't enjoy any five-star trea**ent. The experience was very poor. I'm really speechless. The river view room has a balcony but no seats. The towels also had a peculiar smell, there were no plastic slippers in the bathroom, and the floor was slippery and I almost fell. All in all, there is no sense of experience.

The water in the bathroom is very large, like a waterfall, and the room service is also very timely. The staff are very welcoming. I gave 3 stars for the facility because the check-in system at the front desk is too old. It was the first time I went out to Lishui after it was released, and it was still in the countryside. You can check in by scanning the QR code with your mobile phone there. It is very convenient. ID card No need to take it out. So I hope this hotel will be upgraded as soon as possible. Thank you for the upgraded river view room at the front desk. I didn‚Äôt see what it was when I went in at night. I was shocked by the scenery outside the window in the morning. I also found that there is a Victory Memorial Hall across the river. Walk for 10 minutes and get free tickets. By the way Went to study history.

But during the Chinese New Year, there were not enough people, so there were not enough waiters, the children's playground was not opened, and the swimming pool was not open... This greatly affects the service quality of this price hotel. If you haven't booked a parent-child room... then it has nothing to do with the rise of parent-child hotels...
It's about half an hour's drive from the city, and the scenery facing the river is not bad. But during the Chinese New Year, the shopping mall next to it is basically closed, which is not particularly convenient

The first floor is a huge lawn, and tents are set up. It feels very suitable for some outdoor activities, such as lawn weddings, company team building, making tea around the fireplace in winter, and barbecue beer in the evening. The hotel is separated from the Yangtze River by a road, and a long bridge spans both sides of the Yangtze River. It is very comfortable to walk along the river.
Service: The staff I met were very polite. The little girl standing in the hall would help open the door and say hello. It can be seen that she is not very old and may not work for a long time, but she still works very hard to show her service status. . A total of two rooms were booked. The guest arrived first, and the check-in process was a little tortuous.

Manager Luo handled it very well. He didn't delay the check-in of my guests. He added WeChat and sent me a QR code for payment. Scan the code on WeChat and pay the fee. It also helped to open the invoice in advance, which saved a lot of time. The room arrangement is also very satisfied, the environment is super

msg:The Yangtze River is thousands of miles long, and the smoke and fresh water are vast. This Hilton River View Room is my favorite viewing spot. Because it is far away from the hustle and bustle of the urban area, the overall environment of the hotel is very quiet. The garden mansion standing by the river is a unique existence in such a late autumn Nanjing city. The hotel is fully equipped, the hotel's own underground parking lot has ample parking spaces, clear instructions and a spacious location. There is a direct elevator to the lobby on the 1st floor. At the entrance, there are dutiful security personnel to verify the health code itinerary code and nucleic acid report. I saw a person without nucleic acid being politely refused to enter the hotel area. Check-in at the front desk is also a lot of inspections. Double-code nucleic acids need to be photographed and kept. All kinds of documents in the community are scanned and filled out. The epidemic prevention and control is very strict. The children at the front desk don‚Äôt seem to be very old. Such tedious and boring work is repeated every day. They also take the trouble to speak softly to each guest, and advise each guest to be kind to the service industry personnel under the epidemic. The decoration of the lobby seems to have been adjusted a little recently, and it looks a little fresh. The elevator also seems to be much more obedient and sensible than before. Last year, I met Manager Luo in the front office because of an episode. Every time I checked in, I would help arrange my favorite room in advance. This time, the same is true: the floor and location are all very satisfied. The mattress was soft and comfortable, and it was a dark night's sleep. Get up and have a delicious breakfast, the croissants are crispy, the pancakes are salty and sweet, all of which are excellent.

When you open the door, there is a bigger musty smell, hehe! The good impression of Hilton has been completely subverted, not to mention its own DoubleTree, even Hanting is not as good! Looking at the various bad reviews in the comment area, I still can't believe it. I still have a trace of trust and fantasy in Hilton. So many bad reviews can't be exchanged for rectification, absolutely! The executive floor is not as good as the current Atour! Let's find a place to change clothes by ourselves, and put clothes outside, no one is looking after them, everyone can see them, and only four or five people are swimming when we go in!

Here, I would like to thank Miss Luo Shan at the front desk for helping us arrange the Jiangjing room, which is really amazing! ! ! The room is big and clean, the cloakroom is open, it is very convenient to put things. When I opened the curtains, I could see the long river view. I could actually see Jiang Ying, and the most recent one was able to fly beside the balcony. At sunset, there is a red-hot sunset on the horizon, which is beautiful as a painting. The hotel is very close to Nanyi Backstreet, where Internet celebrities check in, and went for a walk in the evening. I think it would be nice to come back to drink and chat on the balcony. The breakfast didn't end until 10:30. It was very good. I slept late in the morning and went to eat a branch. I liked the donuts. Going back to sleep, it was such a great vacation.

Fortunately, the hotel is very air-conditioned, and it cools down after entering the door. The import has arranged for personnel to check the code, which is very responsible and carefully checked one by one. Before checking in, I added the Wechat of Manager Luo Shan at the front desk. The lady is very kind, and she will answer any questions. We came from other places and didn't know the local epidemic policy. The lady asked Nanjing City's policy requirements for epidemic prevention and control and sent it to us. The time and place positioning of nucleic acid was introduced in detail. The room is big and the cloakroom is my favorite. For breakfast, the chef spreads pancakes and fruits on the spot, which is very interesting. It is so beautiful with an iced latte.

msg:As a Ctrip platinum member who travels all the year round, the evaluation of this hotel is in four words: excellent value for money. As a Hilton in Nanjing, the weekend house price is only 600, which is very surprising. After carefully reading Ctrip's introduction and online reviews, it is estimated that the opening period is too long. Transportation: DiDi, easy to call a car. Take a taxi from Nanjing South Railway Station for about half an hour. The fare for Didi is less than 50. Go directly to the entrance of the hotel lobby.
Environment: The hotel is garden-style as a whole. It is close to the river, covers a large area, and has a high coverage rate of green plants. This is really a luxury in a first-tier city where every inch of land is expensive.
Decoration: the overall resplendent route, the luxury style preferred by old-fashioned hotels, may require overall renovation to keep up with the pace of the times
Facilities: complete, Chinese and Western restaurants, executive lounges, gym swimming pools, SPA clubs, self-operated parking lots, all the functions are included
Room: Booked a superior double bed, the front desk recommended a river view double bed. The room is clean and bright, the independent balcony is the highlight, and the view of the river from the balcony is a must. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the water pressure makes me very satisfied.
Breakfast: It's good to end at 10:30 on weekends, so you can sleep in at ease. Duck blood ravioli is said to be recommended by the chef. After tasting a bowl, it does have Nanjing characteristics.
Service: There are a lot of new employees in each business point of the hotel, and there is still room for improvement in their skills, but fortunately, they have done a good job in filling seats. When entering the hotel gate, the security guard dutifully checked the code, because the Shanghai trip was blocked, but the security guard politely explained the reason, saying that he would ask the leader for instructions. After some communication on the spot, Fang De went to check in, and the front desk still needed to check, but after filling out the letter of commi**ent, the check-in went smoothly. Afterwards, I had an interview with Manager Luo Shan at the front desk on epidemic prevention and control, raised some questions and suggestions, and really understood the difficulties of the hotel in the epidemic era. Please understand each other. Manager Luo responded quickly and the overall communication process was pleasant.
Overall evaluation: Although the decoration design lacks post-modern elements, the environment and services are enough to make up for it, and it is the king of cost performance.

There are security guards at the entrance of the lobby for 24-hour temperature measurement, code checking, products of the epidemic era.

After eating, I went to the front desk to check out. There were a lot of people in line. Some staff instructed a check-out box, put the room card in and left.

The most impressive thing is the extremely meticulous service of Manager Luo Shan at the front desk, which makes us feel at home when we are away on business.

When we arrived at the hotel, we checked the code strictly according to the requirements, and reminded us of the nucleic acid testing location; the rooms were arranged in advance, and the three rooms were on the first floor, which was convenient for us to communicate; the next morning, because I was in a hurry to get a quotation, I asked Manager Luo if he could Help with printing.

The service staff are very enthusiastic, especially the front desk, even if they are busy, they will not neglect everyone. When I checked in, there were a lot of people queuing up at the front desk, and everyone at the front desk was busy, but some people would tell me "wait a moment" and "finish it right away", so I wouldn't feel like I was just waiting there stupidly. Knowing the situation will not make you feel left out and ignored. The weather was hot, and I felt that many guests were very grumpy, and the girls at the front desk patiently explained to the guests, which was really not easy. This time, the manager Luo Shan at the front desk helped arrange the room. The two rooms are on the same floor and the view is first-class.

The registered license plate was not entered, which caused me to toss out of the hotel, and I couldn't pay the fee. After I left the hotel, I called the hotel, and the staff confirmed that the license plate was not recorded, but they didn't apologize, and they didn't say that they would help me record it immediately, which is really weird. After returning to the hotel again, I found a little girl at the front desk to help me enter. Then the Chinese restaurant placed an order at 11:10, and told me half an hour later that the steamed fish had not been made, so I had to return it. But in the end, the restaurant manager gave a plate of steamed sea bass and steamed shrimp with garlic to compensate, but it was a little late and the rice was cold.

There is a socket on one side and charging on the other side is very inconvenient. The air conditioner is also turned off at night. Even such a big hotel is speechless to turn off the air conditioner to save energy. It was only when I arrived that I realized that it was only through the official app. Whether you are a Hilton Gold Card or can't enjoy membership benefits, it's really the worst hotel experience in business travel for so many years

I have to say that the incense in Jiming Temple is really crowded. Thank you very much for helping me buy those souvenirs on my off day. Really is a great lady

When you enter the door, you need to check the double code for temperature measurement. You need to keep the double code. The public area is equipped with disinfectant and disinfectant wipes. The overall service meets the brand requirements.
Special praise to Miss Jiang Yaqing for her warm and thoughtful service, and she can help in a timely manner if there are any problems.

The location of the hotel is excellent, opposite to the river, it is very convenient to go to Hexi and Xuanwu Lake, and it is very convenient to take a taxi to Nanjing to the railway station.
The rooms are very clean. As a hotel that has been in business for ten years, it is very rare. The various standard equipment of five-star hotels need not be elaborated. Especially the service attitude of Ms. Jiang is as good as ever.
There are also many delicious foods in the surrounding business districts. By the way, the hotel has duck blood fans for breakfast, and the taste is authentic. This is a very surprising place and it is worth trying.
Nucleic acid testing can go to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, which is very convenient and there is no need to line up. This is very good for people who travel all year round.

Manager Luo introduced us to the New Year‚Äôs Eve buffet and the New Year‚Äôs Eve cocktail party in the hotel that day, and helped us book the location. The service was professional and meticulous. There is nothing to say about the hotel environment. On the riverside of Xiaguan District, there will be no traffic jams, there is its own parking lot, and the license plate is given to the front desk when you check in, and you do not need to pay parking fees when you travel. The theme room is large in size and exquisitely furnished. There are customized beddings and dolls, especially the welcome card and small gifts of the Ultraman family specially prepared by Manager Luo for the children. The children are not happy. The rooms are one large and one small with two beds, which is very suitable for a family of three like ours. In the cold winter in Nanjing, the heating in the hotel was fully turned on, and we had a perfect New Year's Eve without leaving home.

Entering the door is to measure the temperature, check the code, and give us free masks. The epidemic prevention and control are very strict. The one who checked in was the manager Roshan in the front lobby. He was very kind. Seeing that I brought the children and brought them toys, the children were very happy. I booked a package on Ctrip to send Xixi Paradise to play, and Manager Luo helped us make an appoin**ent for the play time. The paradise is in the hotel, and it is easy to find it after asking the staff. There are children's playgrounds such as slides, small trains, and racing cars.

There are residential gardens and fountain ponds, and the environment is very good. As soon as you enter the lobby, there is a huge crystal lamp hanging in the center, the workbenches on both sides, and a few large pillars. I heard that it has been in business for ten years. It seems that it was probably one of the best in the year. I read the online introduction and said it was "a great view of the Yangtze River", so I booked a river view room. The lady at the front desk took a professional picture of the health code itinerary code, asked about the room requirements, and specially arranged a high floor. It was introduced that I was doing activities for breakfast, but I couldn't get up in the morning, so forget it. Because Hilton members do not earn points when booking rooms from Ctrip, the lady sent a small gift to apologize, which is too polite. The size of the room is okay, no work done, for the price, it's OK. After all, it is an old hotel, unlike the new niche-branded hotels, which have a bunch of fancy new things. Although there are no advanced electronic equipment, they have everything that should be there, and there is no big cat disease in hygiene. The most satisfying thing is the water pressure, and the bath is very comfortable. River view is indeed a selling point. The view is very good. When it is warm, it is very pleasant to sit on the balcony and have a cup of tea.

I listened to the housekeeper's introduction. This is to close the room after cleaning the room and finishing the disinfection work, so that the second person is not allowed to enter. At the moment when the epidemic is tense, this series of operations makes people feel very relieved. The room arranged this time is very large, with a visual inspection of 60 square meters. It is as tidy and clean as before. The mattress is so soft that I don‚Äôt want to get up when I lie on it. It is very comfortable. I can sleep until dawn after drinking. Recently, many new staff have come to the hotel, they are polite and enthusiastic. I feel that the service has been greatly improved, and the breakfast is much richer than before.

msg:Eleven and Faxiao went back to their hometown to see, came to Nanjing to visit friends, and chose the Hilton Hotel on the Internet. The location is not bad, just abducted. The hotel is Linjiang, and the environment is good. Enter the lobby and the service attitude It‚Äôs also very good, but the individual details are lacking. I waited too long while waiting for check-in at the front desk. There was a man in front inquiring about shopping vouchers and membership free matters. The two waitresses at the front desk were answering questions. The two waiters did not understand why they had to go through the process together, so the waiting time was a bit longer and there was no waiting seat.
Room facilities: The equipment in the room has been broken for a long time and the sofa will not be changed
Restaurant: The restaurant is very large and the service is also very good. The printing on the tablecloth is too heavy. You can put a clean one on it. I ordered a yellow croaker noodle with a small piece of yellow croaker.
Parking: The parking place is large, but there are not many parking spaces
Room view: The room environment is really good. I was pleasantly surprised as soon as I entered the room. It happened to be in the afternoon to catch up with the sunset. Because it is a river view room, the view is very beautiful
Sanitation: very clean and good service
wifi: The network is okay, but there is no special attention

Get what you need in time. But for a 5-star hotel like Hilton, the sanitation and facilities are really average, especially the bathtub, because it is with a child, otherwise it will not look closely. When it is clear, it is really unbelievable to find unidentified objects such as false eyelashes. But it didn't affect the mood of staying too much, I hope it really improves. The air conditioner is not so satisfactory, but you haven't changed it. But I have to warn that, really don't choose the hotel buffet dinner, the experience is really very bad, and the breakfast is still very good.

msg:This is the first time I went to Nanjing and booked it through a friend‚Äôs introduction. Because I have children, I called the switchboard of the hotel and explained my requirements. They solved it very carefully and even upgraded the river view room. The view is really good and the room is very clean. Here Special thanks to Xiao Li at the switchboard for sending us breakfast rolls. It was just in time for the rain in the morning. The rainy day in the morning will leak. I am very satisfied with this trip and will continue to choose it next time!
