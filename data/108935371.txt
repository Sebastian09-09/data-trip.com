The driver picked me up on time and asked me about my room requirements in advance. The service was very considerate. The room was spacious, bright, hygienic and clean. Later, the front desk recommended that there was a super popular Dream of Red Mansions drama fantasy city nearby, so we set aside a day to check in. It was very good. Overall, I was very satisfied. Thank you Coco and Agustin for your service and recommendation. I give you five-star praise and recommend everyone to stay here. If you have enough time, you can also check in at the drama park.

To be honest, we are from other places and don't know much. I called an online car-hailing service directly to Beijing for fear of trouble. As a result, the hotel I booked within the second ring road of Beijing, and the out-of-town car can only go outside the second ring road. I spent 140 yuan and couldn't get to my destination. The driver dropped me off at the bus stop. I had to study the bus by myself. It was really inconvenient to drag a big luggage with a child!

The level of intelligence is very high and can meet the various needs of consumers. People who need to go to and from Daxing Airport can take the hotel's shuttle bus for free. People on leisure vacation are best to travel by car. At present, the surrounding area of ​​the hotel is basically a construction site, catering There is little to note about this. I found the staff to be friendly and hospitable. Special thanks to Xiao Han (Siyu) at the front desk for not only upgrading our room, but also introducing in detail the construction plan around the hotel, the route to Langfang Beijing Daxing Airport, and taking us to visit the gym and swimming pool.
