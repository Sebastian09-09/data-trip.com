Beautiful large room with a bath! 
Breakfast was good enough with varied options. 

Small improvements to make for a better pleasant stay. 
1. Encourage all customers not to smoke in communal areas. Especially at breakfast in corridors. My room began to smell of smoke! 
2. Cleanliness of the leisure facilities. Checking the showers are working for the swimming.
3. Encourage all customers not to spit in the swimming areas. 

Besides all of this nice enough stay with comfortable room for the weekend.

Please, I checked in at nearly 5 pm and had to wait half an hour?! Then I asked at the front desk if the twin beds could be put together, but was told no. Because I was traveling with two babies, I asked the front desk if there were cribs, but the front desk said there were not enough cribs. I asked if I could change to a king-size bed room, but the front desk said no. When I got to the room, I found that the hygiene was terrible, so I told the housekeeper, who changed the room and sent fruit. At night, the baby wanted to sleep, so I asked the front desk again if there were cribs, or if I could change to a king-size bed room, but they still said no. Who is actually staying in all the empty rooms listed online?... Hilton in Chengdu is really hard to describe, very annoying. Especially the front desk. Those guys have basically zero sense of service.

Xiaohuan’s service was very good. He helped me register as a member and also gave me free gifts. A piece of fruit. Because I have mysophobia, I asked the room attendant not to enter the room. The time for delivering the fruit was also in line with the time when I returned to the room. Later, the train time required a delayed check-out. All special requests were communicated and coordinated by Xiaohuan. Finally, I am a germophobe and will wipe all the tabletops when I check in. There are really no hygienic dead spots.

I changed to an executive room for the second night and had a great experience. I also went to the executive lounge for afternoon tea, which was less crowded and quieter. The breakfast buffet is quite rich in variety, the dining environment is nice and there are not too many people, so you won't feel crowded. I also bought a small cake at the lobby bar, which is discounted for Hilton members. The location of the hotel is very good. It is not far from various scenic spots and it is very convenient to take a taxi. The housekeeper Xiaohuan has been providing attentive service since before we came to Chengdu. She also gave me a lot of useful suggestions on where to go. When I first checked in, I couldn't connect to the wifi, but Xiaohuan helped me solve it promptly and quickly even though I was on vacation. Thank you very much! My child left a message on the feedback form hoping that children's pillows would be provided next time. Unexpectedly, when we returned to the room, the waiter, Sister Chen*ying, had already sent us a small pillow and enthusiastically replied to the letter. All in all, the stay was a great experience. I will stay here again next time.

One is that the slippers in the room are too thin and are different from Hilton's signature. The other is that the Panda Base tickets in the package include one of two large and one small, which refers to children under six years old, and this age group It is free of charge in the first place, so it would appear more sincere if this kind of word play can be avoided. Anyway, it's worth a stay and it's a Hilton I trust.

The meals included in the package are also good, the breakfast buffet has a variety of choices, the afternoon tea is exquisite and delicious, and the hot food during happy hour directly solves the problem of dinner😄

a fly in the oin**ent:
1. The hotel held a seminar and there were many people, so it was a bit late to hand over the room.
2. Power outage in the middle of the night and then another power outage...

The bed in the guest room is very comfortable, the bathroom layout is warm, the bathroom equipment is good, the bathtub is large enough, and the shower head has a large flow of water, making it very comfortable to take a shower. There was also a gift box of fruits and snacks in the room, which was given by a little sister named Xiaohuan who served us very enthusiastically.

msg:Worst stay experience during National Day.
First, both hotels and Ctrip have price backstabbing behavior, and they also gave me a consumer education. On August 27th, I booked a "deluxe double room" for October 3rd to 5th, which was about 3,225 yuan/2 nights (excluding breakfast); but on the day of check-in, I found the same room type from October 4th to 5th, and the price was It dropped to 1,319 yuan/night. At 23:00 on October 3, I applied to modify the order and terminate the original order early, that is, canceling the stay on the night of the 4th. I could get a refund of 1,554 yuan; and then planned to re-book for 1,319 yuan, saving 200+. After submitting the modification application, neither the hotel nor Ctrip took the initiative to contact me. I contacted the hotel front desk on the morning of the 4th, and the front desk actually said that the matter needed to be handled by the reservation depar**ent, but there was no "reservation depar**ent" phone number, and they couldn't even lie. Later, when I asked Ctrip, I found out that the hotel reservation depar**ent wanted to ask the leader for instructions. At around 10:00 a.m. on the 4th, maybe the manager had some objections. The hotel contacted me and asked me to place an order for the evening of the 4th and then cancel or change the original order. It can be seen that they neither realize the mistake of backstabbing their prices, nor are they willing to trust their members and customers.
Second, let’s talk about hardware. The hotel uses outdated non-intelligent toilets, Philips Apple speakers, and kettles and hair dryers with single functions and average quality. They are not worthy of the "Hilton" brand and the price. Forget it if it is an ordinary hotel. How can this hotel charge such a high room rate and have the nerve to use such backward hardware?
Third, let’s talk about software services. When I checked in on the night of the 3rd, I asked the front desk if there were any children's slippers. They clearly said "no". After communicating with me about the order cancellation and change on the morning of the 4th, they actually provided children's slippers and children's toothbrushes. I wonder if they ran overnight to purchase new supplies. The hygiene issue is even more disturbing. The quilt and sheets are clearly black and white, the quilt is black, and there are stains on the sheets. Finally, some details. This hotel only provides a box of tissue paper in the bathroom. It is puzzling that tissue paper is not provided in the bedroom.
To sum up, the hardware of this hotel is relatively backward and the software service is not good. I'm sorry for this brand and price.

He also added the housekeeper Xiaohuan's WeChat message and asked for some precautions. I checked in at the hotel around 6pm, and the housekeeper carefully gave me two Hilton card pockets, one for my wife and one for me.
In the evening, the housekeeper Xiaohuan also asked in advance if we needed to extend our stay or check out the next day. We had something to do and we needed to check out late the next day. We were about to ask, so we told her to postpone our check out until 2 pm because Hilton usually checks out at 12 o'clock, so the housekeeper asked to help coordinate, and it was indeed postponed to 2 o'clock the next day. Thank you very much!
The hotel service is in place, clean and tidy, and the location is very convenient. It will be my first choice next time I come to Chengdu!

In terms of service, while many other hotels require you to call the front desk, this hotel has a dedicated housekeeper to handle all issues through WeChat messages. Xiaoqian, the housekeeper in charge of my stay this time, was friendly and responded to messages in a timely manner, which is not surprising. It will not take more time than talking to the front desk, and it also handles well the hidden worry of the front desk phone being overwhelmed due to heavy passenger flow. It can be said that it is "designer" level from both the room level and the service level. The small drawback is that when I wanted to have a late night snack after 11pm, I scanned the QR code and found that the menu was closed. The picture is from the window of my room.

msg:Every time I go out, I will choose to stay at the Hilton Hotel with a high probability. This stay should be the most satisfying one. This comes from the hotel's butler Xiao Zhang, who is simply a caring and caring fairy housekeeper. This time I took my family with me on a business trip to Chengdu With a three-month-old baby, when I checked in, I saw that I took the stroller and asked if I needed a crib. I was surprised that there was such a supporting service. After seeing the baby, I told the waiter to send a few more every day A bottle of mineral water, because the reserved executive double room is a bit hot on the top floor. We are from the north and our baby will not be comfortable with the air conditioner. Go to the front desk to communicate and adjust the room. Xiao Zhang not only helped me adjust the cooler floor, but also helped me for free I upgraded to an executive suite. Haha, I’m not too happy. The service details in the next few days were also in place. I went out to work during the day, and my mother was in the hotel with her baby. Xiao Zhang helped me solve everything. Anyway, every time I ask Xiao Zhang Dudu responded to every request, and even sent a fruit afternoon tea full of ceremonies. When he checked out, he accidentally left his watch and necklace in the room. He was worried all morning and was afraid of losing them. I found it back, and I personally sent SF express for me, reminding me to guarantee the price. In short, I was super satisfied with the stay experience. Next time I go to Chengdu, I will choose Xiexin Hilton. I suggest everyone go to the housekeeper Xiao Zhang, and they will respond to your needs hahaha 😆

The popular scenic spots in the city center are basically within 10 kilometers~ It is very convenient to take a taxi, but the streets of Chengdu are slightly congested, especially during the peak summer travel season~ The hotel swimming pool is at B1. It may be that there are more people learning to swim during the summer vacation. It is the first time to go The swimming pool is almost in the state of dumpling ~ After communicating with the hotel, they gave a positive response, and also provided a suggested time for swimming in a humane manner. The manager on duty even sent a fruit snack to express his apology ~ The overall service is quite good, especially It's the concierge and room service, it's recommended to stay~

After checking out, I received a call from the front desk inexplicably, saying that I drank Evian mineral water and didn't say anything, and it would be deducted from the deposit. Really, I drank it and you deducted it, but I didn’t drink it. The hotel didn’t check it clearly and called me this call to slander me for no reason? The deluxe big bed room was originally a soft drink, so I made a discount. Otherwise, don't give away this orange juice, can I drink it? The corridor is already narrow, and this cleaning truck is left at our door for a whole day
This is the worst and worst Hilton I have ever stayed in, and the sound insulation is also very poor! The curtains of the windows are at least 5 cm from the ground. When it is daylight, the room is very bright and does not block the light at all.

The front desk has been suggesting that I understand, but there is no actual action. I propose to upgrade the suite and I am not very happy. So I proposed [Since I choose not to live in and you are not willing to upgrade the suite for me, then I will return it. I will live in the Waldorf Astoria in the Financial City] After that, the front desk reluctantly helped me upgrade the basic suite. The suite price is only a few dozen yuan more expensive than the executive room, I don't know what I'm thinking.
It was not until close to seven o'clock that I called me to say that the room was ready, but the towels in it were still wet when I checked in at night.
The lounge and basic facilities are ok, but nothing spectacular.
The landscape is basically blocked, and it can be seen at a glance that it is all buildings.

When I stayed at night, my whole body started to itch when I lay down in it. I checked carefully and found no bugs or the like. But I suspected that I didn't notice it, so I called the front desk and asked someone to change the bed sheet and quilt cover for me. After that, everything was normal, and it was basically judged to be a quilt problem. This is a problem that I have never encountered in these brand hotels, and it opened my eyes.

Breakfast and lounge food are ok

msg:Although the outside temperature was about 20° when I checked in, the indoor temperature of the hotel was 25°, which was relatively muggy. I knew that in this weather the hotel would save electricity and turn off the air cooler, so I contacted the front desk in hopes of reducing the air conditioner temperature. Both the front desk and the housekeeper were very polite. It's relatively good and proactive in solving problems, but the hotel management is rather pedantic and unwilling to turn on the air conditioner. I have to scold you for the bad review here. First of all, it is impossible to sleep with the window open in the room, as there will be no privacy. Secondly, as you know, the vertical air cooler is very noisy and ineffective.
When I checked in, I noticed that the air conditioner was turned off and the cold air was turned off. I reported this immediately and warned that if I was woken up by the heat at night, I would definitely get a negative review. I was reminded twice, but the hotel management did not take it seriously and refunded me. Only the manager who knew the room called me to apologize. Your staff have actually done a good job, especially the parking lot staff and housekeepers below. However, I gave the hotel management this negative review without any discussion. Suitable temperature for sleeping is fundamental. Problem, plus hotel beds are prone to sweating, so I didn’t sleep well at night, so what’s the use of apologizing?
A bad review is sent to every stingy hotel management who can’t bear to turn on the air conditioner.

As the only Hilton left in Chengdu, it is really not sharp enough, and the service and other aspects are average, but there is no service. Sometimes when staying in a high-end hotel, the decoration and facilities are only the bottom line, and the service is the most valuable.
The decoration is also average. The toothbrushes used in hotels of this level match all the hospitality, including the location of the bath products, which makes people speechless, and it is difficult to reach out and press them.
For a hotel that has spent so much money on decoration, saving this kind of money in places where guests are most likely to use it can only be said that the management has a huge problem.

Service: Very good, kind. The location of the hotel is very good, very close to Chunxi Road. The facilities are complete, it is convenient to travel, clean and tidy, and the service is warm and thoughtful. When we arrived at the store at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the room had not been cleaned, so Ms. Li at the front desk helped us Free afternoon tea is provided. The tea is very nice. The hotel is very good for children. There are many items specially prepared for children, such as children's disposable slippers and children's disposable toothbrushes. It's just that it's inconvenient for smokers. If you want to smoke, you have to go downstairs to the smoking area at the door. It feels a bit sour to go downstairs at 12 o'clock in the evening to smoke in the wind. I hope Hilton can open up a smoking floor to be more humane. This time I have stayed in Chongqing Hilton and Chengdu Hilton consecutively, and there are no smoking floors. I hope that there will be changes when I can stay again in the future. In short, I am very satisfied with Hilton, and hope that the service can be more comprehensive.

The front desk took the room card and found that it was Room 4 on a certain floor. I said I didn’t want to live in Room 4, but the front desk said that the hotel has no other rooms. If you don’t accept Room 4, the only option is to pay to upgrade to the Ambassador Suite. You need to add 1500 Yuan.
I didn't expect that Hilton would have Room 4 when the room was set up. It was already late at night and there was no choice. It cost 1,500 to upgrade the room type, and the front desk said it was already very cheap. Maybe Hilton did nothing wrong, but as a customer I feel very uncomfortable and aggrieved.

I booked it on Ctrip, maybe because of the Universiade, the room rate has risen to More than 700. I don’t know if it’s because the price I booked is low or what. There is a door between my room and the room next door. This is the first time I encountered this situation in a star-rated hotel. It happened that the room next door was noisy all night until five in the morning It didn't stop until 1:00, and the TV remote control was out of power, and the TV couldn't be turned off all night, because I went back too late, and I didn't call the front desk.

2. Location: It feels good, better than living around scenic spots and business districts, easy to take a taxi, not far from various scenic spots and business districts, only ten minutes to Chunxi Road
3. Facilities & hardware: I have to complain, 1) There are long hairs hanging on the wall of the bathroom that have not been cleaned, disgusting; 2) The alcove in the shower is so narrow, it is very difficult to use; 3) The cotton swabs in the nursing kit are just like this, you can do it yourself Look at the picture; 4) The faucet is crooked like the picture, although it doesn’t affect the use, but it’s really uncomfortable to see; 5) I didn’t make up the nursing kit the next day, so I took something else; 6) The tissue is only in the bathroom, so I got it specially The room is for use, and I didn’t make up a box in the room the next day. There is no such rule, but other hotels know it. It makes people feel that the service awareness is not enough

The toilet smelled a little bad when I lived in it. I called to talk about it and did it again. The free water bar was not replenished in time. The funniest thing was that one day I didn’t even take away the garbage on the table (I specially took plastic bags to put some food packaging boxes and so on). There are not many things for breakfast. After staying for 4 consecutive days, the welcome fruit was only delivered for two days, and one of them was still requested. General experience

msg:I stayed in room 1209 for three consecutive days from July 20th to 23rd on a business trip in Chengdu. It was very good. I checked out on Saturday morning and went to Emei for a business trip. I had to go on a business trip the next day and returned to Chengdu early in the morning. I thought about staying at the Hilton again. 1 I arrived at the front desk after 1pm and showed my ID. The check-in person at the front desk told me that they could give me a room at the same price as the previous few days. I said I didn’t want the elevator entrance or the corner and faced the corridor. I wanted to sleep quietly for five hours. When I got to the room, I found that Is it an assisted room for people with limited mobility? There are handrails everywhere, and I’m not a person with limited mobility? And it's facing the corridor. Isn't this deceiving people? Or is it insulting? I dragged my luggage downstairs and asked to change rooms. I was asked to upgrade and pay more. I said it was no problem because I was very sleepy and just wanted to sleep. I didn't want to argue or blame. I have never encountered this kind of business trip in so many years. What does it mean to arrange a normal walking guest in that kind of room? And when my deposit was not refunded that day, I was asked to continue paying the deposit for room 1208. Bad review, very bad review. This is the first complaint in so many years. Shouldn't this be due to Hilton's training level and business reception standards, or is it just a case of Shen Yip ripping off customers?

And it is more intelligent, no need to insert a card, the door light will automatically turn on when you open it. Well, there is a good detail. If you drive, you don't have to go to the front desk to get a parking ticket every time you go out. You only need to call the front desk before leaving, which is valid for half an hour. There is a mobile phone table next to the toilet, which is a very user-friendly design. Everyone knows it. I recommend his Chinese food. Well, the environment is elegant and the taste is better, but some dishes feel a little stingy. Well, the hotel's 1-to-1 housekeeper, the service is still very good, consulted for opinions, and made certain communication. There is a small problem that every time the service is called, the door-to-door service is very slow and needs to be improved.

I was very happy. The eldest sister who did the cleaning when I left the store was also very enthusiastic. : The room was booked for 2 days and only had fruit on the first day, and the fruit plate was not cleaned up in time when I left the store.

The shampoo, shower gel and conditioner are all good. The service is very good, especially Xiaoyu Xiaolin. , so thoughtful, 120 points satisfied! I am also very grateful for their excellent service throughout the entire process, which made the business trip comfortable! We recommend the steak set menu for dinner on the first floor.

The housekeeper Xiao Yu called from the front of the hotel to confirm, from the upgrade of the room type, to the arrangement of welcome fruits and desserts, and dealt with our requests very patiently, which is very rare in the present when the hotel only focuses on hardware , and also makes Hilton Hilton currently one of the top hotels in Chengdu I think.

🍃 Environment: The environment is unmistakable, very new and very modern. It's no wonder that many internet celebrities come to check in. But the point that needs to be improved is that the summer in Chengdu is very sudden. In fact, the hotel has fresh air from the lobby to the room is not enough. It is very hot. I hope this part can be considered in the future.

In general, the score is about 10 out of 10, and you can get a high score of 9 in Chengdu. The service attitude of the housekeeper Xiaoyu is very good, the sense of distance is very good, and the politeness will not burden the guests too much. I also hope that the service level can be maintained when I live in another day.

There is a slight downside.
Check in on the first day and wait until more than 6 o'clock...
After the first day of check-in, call the front desk to ask for water, and answer that only 4 bottles are given per room. Later, the front desk called to solve it.
In the weather in Chengdu this year, I weigh more than 200 pounds and four bottles a day are not enough.

In a five-star hotel that costs more than 700 a night, there is not even a place to park and drop off passengers at the gate, and there is no sign in the parking lot. As a result, we followed the hotel sign and drove customers into the ba*****t of an office building. The hotel went around two more times before entering the parking lot. When we arrived at Minus 1, there was clearly a parking space, and we were told to go down. When we got down to Minus 2, there was no guidance on how to get to the hotel. We went back to Minus 1 and found a place to pass by something The gym just enters the lobby! Accompanied the customer to complete the formalities and was about to return to the car, but couldn’t find the passage back to the first garage. I searched for half an hour and went back to the lobby to find the manager on duty. The manager led the way and couldn’t find it at first. I searched and walked several times. Just back to the negative one car! It was torture!
The room, the big bed room we booked for the guests, doesn't feel as good as the hotel with more than 300 yuan!
This time, I lost face in front of customers!
May I ask how this hotel is rated as five stars? ? ?
Remind everyone not to choose this hotel for business reception, let alone travel agencies! ! !

msg:Worst 5 star hotel ever
Stayed for 14 days No matter how many things I took to get in or out of the hotel door, the concierge never opened the door or took things for me. Only when I finally checked out, I moved my luggage once, and for the remaining 13 days, I stood at the door every day and watched me get off the car without opening the door.
I booked a 14-day room, and Ctrip Golden Diamond VIP gave a room on the 8th floor. I went to the front desk and said to help me upgrade the room type or to a room with a higher floor. The front desk asked me to "upgrade it when I write it now." I would really appreciate it, thinking that I would endure writing good reviews for more than a week.
I had surgery on my eyes, and I asked the front desk to help me freeze an ice pack. The front desk told me on the phone at one o'clock in the morning that the refrigerator in the room was over 10 degrees and could not freeze. I used you to give me popular science knowledge here in the middle of the night? The ice pack turned into water, I don't know what happened? Saying this with you here in the middle of the night?
The aunt in the middle cleaned the room and once put a rag on my bathtub (right next to my clothes) and once the room was not covered. Hilton is this level?
Finally, I checked out today and waited for the car in the lobby. I went to the front desk and asked the front desk to charge me a battery (my phone was out of power and my own charger was fast charging and I didn’t want to rent a power bank after waiting for the car) The front desk replied that there was no charger (I The phone is holding the charger) Let me go to the opposite side to borrow a power bank 🙂 It took me over 7000 to go and I was full of fire

msg:This hotel has the elements of Shu Brocade and Han Que, and it is very beautiful. The lobby on the first floor is as high as two floors, which is bright and spacious. Hilton's standards have indeed reached cleanliness! Spacious! fashionable! The gargle cup is almost crystal clear. There is a support board on the side of the toilet where you can put your mobile phone, which is the welfare of the squat. The toiletry kit next to the sink is placed in the air to avoid the embarrassment of getting wet. Many places in the room will be marked as having been cleaned and disinfected, and the whole process shows a kind of process management, which makes people feel at home. The anti-theft lock on the door and the reading light on the bedside are both very practical devices. The details are enough to impress me. The butler service of the hotel is very considerate. When I checked in, Cici gave me fruit and ice powder, and gave me a guide and recommended gourmet meals during the period; I also reminded me that the weather was raining on the way out, and there was an umbrella in the closet for use; when I checked out, I learned that I did not have a meal. He also poured a cup of hot tea for me, prepared some sweets, and finally sent me to the car. These actions are very enthusiastic and make people feel like spring breeze! If it were not for another itinerary, I would plan to stay a few more nights. The check-in experience was very pleasant. Value for money!

msg:There is no travel for some time this year. The Hilton, which I chose to stay in at the end of the National Day, is generally okay~

Transportation: It is convenient to take a taxi. It is more than 40 minutes by car from Shuangliu Airport. If there is no traffic jam~ To take a taxi to the Panda Base, some scenic spots are subway trips. It is about one kilometer away from the Qianfeng Road Station of Line 3 and Line 6, and the walking distance is acceptable~
Environment: The lobby is very beautiful, basically in line with the five-star feeling, that is, there are too few seats in the lobby~ If there are too many people at check-in or check-out, there are not enough seats to wait or rest~
Hygiene: Not bad at first glance, the bedding is quite comfortable~
Breakfast: There are not many varieties, but the taste is acceptable.
Service: The service attitude is very good. There may be some minor problems with the connection between the order booked by Ctrip and the hotel system. On the day of check-in, I almost made it without breakfast (actually including breakfast and the executive lounge). This is the first time In this case, fortunately, it was verified and resolved after it was raised.
  Others are very good, from the early confirmation by phone before check-in, the taxi arrives on the day of check-in, and the check-out later is very considerate.
  Thank you to Summer who passed through the phone call before check-in, and thank you Mandy and GRO Xiaofan for your caring and help~

msg:I checked in on October 4th. On the morning of the 5th, I woke up with so much itching that I thought I was bitten by mosquitoes. After a while, I found many little red spots. I was in a hurry to catch the plane. It was very itchy. I went to the local hospital to inquire about the problem of the hotel’s bed sheets, which caused the mites and fungal allergies. I contacted the hotel and asked us to wait for the news feedback and let us prove that it was still itchy the next day. It proves that the doctor still blurted out whether he stayed in a hotel or not. The pimples are very serious. It may take about 10 years to issue a certificate to the Hilton Hotel. They said that they will wait 14 days for their bed sheet test report before they give me an answer. Funny, 14 days What evidence? It’s all gone. I just want to remind everyone that if there is a problem, we will be the ones who are hurt. Bullying our vulnerable groups. I have to bear the itch for at least 10 days alone. It's really ridiculous for a person to take on such a big 5-star hotel. Isn't it brave to take on 14 days? ridiculous! Want to ask where is the corporate culture?

The facilities in the room are relatively new compared to the hotels of the same grade near Chunxi Road. The nearby Jianshe Road is crowded with people and it is very lively. It is only 10 yuan to take a taxi to Chunxi Road. That is, the executive lounge should be moved back to the 17th floor as soon as possible. The water in the swimming pool is not bad, and the sofa linen in the locker room and swimming pool should be changed and washed. Looking forward to the next time the past has changed! Overall praise!

There is no turn-down service, so it will be up to Hilton's standard, and it needs to be improved.

No question on the spot doesn’t mean I didn’t Opinion, to be honest, I don’t recommend it. If there is a problem with the order, I just shirk it to Ctrip and tell me that they have no problem.

第二天告訴前台，檢查結果是，不知道哪裡接觸不好。我的一夜無眠，獲得一盒粽子賠償。

剛下飛機就收到了小倩管家的電話，問多長時間到店，問房間需求。幫我們提前準備房間。
因為忘帶手機充電線，管家幫忙給在酒店找了一個給拿到房間。因為頭一天玩很晚，所以第二天早起困難，和小倩管家溝通後，又幫我延遲退房，還有後續的一些關心。
謝謝管家，讓這次入住很滿意。

酒店距離前鋒路地鐵站G口不遠，臨河，鬧中取靜。周邊配套齊全，生活用品購買方便。我們選擇的是豪華大床房，空間很大，乾淨整潔，屋內設施和用品一應俱全，床偏軟了一些，不過可以接受。朝南向的房間，大落地窗採光很好，適逢成都冬季難得的幾日晴天，温暖舒適。入住第三天體驗了酒店地下一層的游泳池，水温適宜，感覺舒服。
酒店入住方便，工作人員專業熱情，我們提出增加被子和椅子的請求，客房服務員立刻滿足，非常貼心。第四日外出歸來，過敏性鼻炎不適，在**上買葯之後，大堂工作人員接到快遞小哥傳遞的葯，親自送到客房門口，工作細緻，替住客考慮，很感動。
再次感謝酒店工作團隊和管家小歡的辛勤付出，今後如再有機會去成都還會考慮這家酒店，性價比足夠高的。也向大家推薦！

msg:之前出差就住過，對這個酒店的印象就已經很好了。
這次預訂後，沒想到酒店還推出了管家服務。我們的管家小倩第一時間就聯繫了我們，並且把房間按照需求，安排的妥妥當當，給我們提供了很好的幫助。
真的是一次非常好的體驗。

服務滿意，尤其是小倩，在我們入住前詢問需求，提供幫助。
適合自駕朋友入住，停車方便，停車場有快速充電樁。
贈送的熊貓基地的遊玩日期不能調整感覺很不方便，希望改進。

值得一提的是，由於朋友上午外出辦事，説是可能無法趕回酒店辦理退房，給管家小倩説明瞭一下情況，小倩極力幫助之下，延遲了退房時間，也正好處理完事情回酒店辦理退房時間，剛剛好。
很好的入住體驗，感謝😊

最大的問題是衞生間是反人性設計，沒有一點點置物的空間，連塊肥皂都沒地方放，別説洗面奶卸粧液了，設計的時候沒帶心。
第二，衹有上面的大噴頭，移動的花灑衹有小水。
住了三天，一想到洗澡就痛苦，不會再來的，建議重新裝修洗手間，這是希爾頓，沒見過這樣不人性化的

差強人意的是服務～從酒店前台到客房部
可以説是完全沒有服務意識
辦入住明明已經過了可入住的時間，反覆就説房間沒打掃出來，看我帶 2 個小孩一起不方便等太久，既沒有表示歉意，也給不出一點彌補的措施，衹跟我説可以到周圍轉轉，房間出來通知我，因帶着小孩不想出去轉這一會了就在大堂吧點了吃喝等着，等了一個多小時還沒接到電話忍不住去前台問，反覆換了幾個前台才説房間出來了～
退房頭一晚有個需要冰葯的冷凝盒需要借酒店冰櫃冷凍一下，硬是提供不了這個服務，告訴我可以給我冰塊，反覆説了情況還是抱歉不行，我真是謝謝你，請問冰塊我怎麼帶上飛機？是不會化成水？

msg:在成都一週，住了不同的酒店。前兩個都不滿意，交通、房間都一般，價格也不便宜。最後偶然搜到協信希爾頓，試一試的心態辦了入住，出乎意料的好，交通、房間素質、服務都是一流，疲倦的身心在兩個晚上得到了休息，家人也滿意。尤其是希爾頓酒店管家經理張小姐，提供了無微不至的服務，以後再來成都就不用再去選擇了，直接在這裏入住就可以了。

msg:1.下午三點進行入住辦理，給了一張1114的房卡，在我提出換房要求時，他説需要等十分鐘。但卻等了半個小時。
2.房間內花灑極其難用，手持花灑和頂部花灑切換不暢。
3.房間內將免費飲用水放到衞生間，客房內能看到的衹有收費水，能理解酒店想多賣飲品提高收入，但使用這個方式感覺有點不尊重顧客。
這是住希爾頓該品牌酒店以來最糟糕的一次體驗。

msg:這是我有史以來最垃圾的住宿體驗，沒有之一。前天上午出門着急，房間開着請勿打擾的燈，所以沒有收拾房間。等我下午回來發現後，趕緊要求加緊安排打掃，然後下去鍛鍊健身。結果我1個半小時回來房間，發現還是沒有打掃。等我再出門叫人才發現，保潔在對面的房間收拾衞生。
我問為什麼不來我這裏打掃，保潔説是前台要求先把那幾個空的臟房間打掃出來，有客人要入住。
合著我們這種已經入住的客人，就是跑不了，所以活該不享受服務唄？
我這還訂了行政套房，就這服務水平，希爾頓能不倒閉才怪。

msg:帶小朋友入住，總體感覺一般，有提前告知需要嬰兒床，但是嬰兒床感覺是從倉庫裏拖出來的，很臟，沒法睡。訂了兩間房，其中一間有一個門可以通往旁邊的房間，雖然鎖上了，但是挺可怕的，半夜旁邊房間入住，旁邊房間的客人就在那裡拉門把手，一晚上沒怎麼休息好。入住時有聯繫酒店管家協調更換，但是沒有合適的，所以妥協沒有更換。
總體來説酒店設施、衞生、環境都很一般，特別是那種連通房就不應該單獨銷售，住起來挺恐怖的。
酒店總體就衹有服務還行，酒店管家小李也在積極溝通和解決問題，贈送了水果，第二天也幫忙把其中一間客房延時到下午兩點退房。
