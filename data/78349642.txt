He was amazingly polite and I truly appreciated his effort to make our stay as comfortable as can be.

The hotel is amongst the best in the region and I was given a room with sea view.

Highly recommend this hotel to those who love a great view and impeccable service.

The room is spacious, clean and well equipped with all the comforts you would expect.

The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. They ensure that you have a pleasant stay in a caring way. Anything you need, just ask Mr. Lin (guest service manager).

The breakfast is very varied, healthy and delicious. But above all the breakfast, lunch and dinner is of very good quality. Compliments to the chefs. A suggestion for some, over polite, young waiters: don't ask too quickly to change your plate, while guests enjoy the food in peace. A little more distance will be fine and shows professionalism.

Special attention to the cleaning lady who had already brought our room in perfect condition during our breakfast, including disinfection and fresh air.

Very special is "roof22", this club room is wonderfully relaxed to enjoy the peace, high tea, snacks and drinks. A special compliment to Eva. With friendly, sincere, warm attention, she knows how to give her guests a real living room atmosphere. She is able to do the right things at the right time in a modest way. Also here the dinner have good quality, si special and delicious.

The spacious view from the room and clubroom are particularly beautiful and varied because of the ebb and flow. On our last day we saw the full rainbow, really beautiful.

The hotel is easily accessible and from here all attractions and business visits are within easy reach.

Finally, the hotel is rightfully worthy of 5 stars. We can warmly recommend this hotel to everyone. We look forward to our next stay here.

When I checked in, the front desk informed me that I had been upgraded to an executive suite. I didn't expect to enjoy the hotel's full hospitality on my first check-in. The room is located on the tenth floor of the hotel, spacious and bright, with warm and luxurious facilities. Looking at the sea through the floor-to-ceiling windows is another scene. Jessica Zhu, the hotel's guest relations director, contacted me in time and said that if I had any questions during my stay, I could tell her at any time and she would solve them immediately. I gave a big thumbs up to the hotel's thoughtful service. The hotel staff I met were all warm and polite, and the breakfast variety was also very rich. They also specially prepared Fujian-style shacha noodles, noodle soup, etc. This was an unforgettable hotel stay. In the future, when I come to Xiamen, I will choose this Crowne Plaza Hotel Jimei Seaview. I also sincerely recommend this hotel to friends who come to Xiamen.

Thank you very much for Sherry's enthusiastic service❤️I helped upgrade the suite when I checked in, and wrote down the dining reminders for each time period on the card. The concierge helped me take the luggage and led me to the room. The sea view and city view are unobstructed. The room is spacious, the bedding is comfortable, and there is a free mini bar.

I couldn't get up for breakfast, so my friend brought it back to the room for me. He said that the staff also helped to pack milk and other food. This is very humane. Thumbs up👍

The experience of the lounge on the 22nd floor is also good. The top floor has a sea view, afternoon tea and light meals, and soft drinks are provided until nine o'clock in the evening. Everyone should pay attention to the time.

I came down from the mountain and wanted to find a quiet and clean hotel to rest for two days. This hotel really makes people full of energy and recharge! It is not too far from Xiamen North or taking a taxi to the island.
The breakfast is also very rich, and the service staff are very enthusiastic! The most important thing is that the hotel is really clean, tidy and new! I think this is better than some older hotels of the same grade in Xiamen!
I look forward to staying here next time I come to Xiamen~ It is really a good place to sleep and vacation~
I also recommend everyone to come boldly and rest assured. It is very convenient to take a taxi in the city!

Advantages: close to Jimei, convenient for takeout (many varieties to choose from), really big room (there is a very comfortable sofa between the two beds), more breakfast than the Marriott in Haicang (local specialties, such as peanut soup), comfortable bed, free fruit and first round mini bar (more varieties). Disadvantages: the beach downstairs is not as beautiful as the Haicang Bay Park under the Marriott, the bed in the standard room is not as big as the Marriott, and there is no bathtub. Overall it is good. After staying at this hotel, I went to Fuzhou Crown that night and felt that the room was so small.

The surrounding environment is absolutely stunning, no matter the night scene or the sunrise. If you choose a sea view room, you basically don’t have to go out.

Although the hotel's "gifts" are enough, I still feel that the rich breakfast lacks seafood, which makes my yearning for Xiamen a mistake after all.

If you go to Chaofengxuan on the second floor with low expectations like "Hujian Province is a food desert", you won't be disappointed in terms of taste, but in terms of price, the value for money is really not there.

The hotel service is very good. I upgraded my room type when I arrived. I took the initiative to contact me before departure and made arrangements in advance. The response to the tourist information about tourist attractions was very timely and thoughtful. I asked about the style of wine glasses for the New Year's Eve dinner in advance. On the first day of the new year, it was my family’s ***** birthday, and they even made a cake and delivered it to the room, which was very thoughtful. The children were very considerate in ordering French fries for the children's room meals several times at night.
The hotel is in a good location. Although it is not on the island, the transportation is convenient. The room is fully equipped and equipped with a Kung Fu tea set. The stay is spacious and comfortable. There are also seafood and delicious food around. It is suitable for self-driving travel with the family.

msg:To be honest, the sea view of their house is a bit desolate, and the neon lights of the island opposite can be seen from a distance. However, the price is also more affordable, and it is much more cost-effective than the price of sea view hotels on the island.
There is nothing to praise or complain about the standard room we stayed in.
Nowadays, more and more hotel rooms offer free drinks for the first round of mini-fridges, which is pretty good, although the minibar will look a bit crude.
The breakfast preparation is also standard, but the sand tea noodles as shown in the picture are the most solid ingredients among the hotels I have stayed in in Xiamen this time. Executive Lounge Happy Hour is relatively simple. It feels like Crowne Plaza’s happy hour is relatively simple everywhere.
This time I met a staff member who did nothing when we met for the first time. He asked you to write a good review on Ctrip and mention his or her name.

The gym is also in Crowne Plaza style, and the staff there are a little less laid-back than other positions in the hotel. There have been times when I was looking down at WeChat while talking to you.

It can be considered a relatively cost-effective five-star hotel. It is suitable for working people like us who want a better stay but have a limited budget.
However, the scores of such hotels on Ctrip should not be compared with super five-star hotels. For example, a Waldorf Astoria with a score of 4.5 is not necessarily worse than a Crowne Plaza with a score of 5. Different price points have different measurement standards.

msg:I have always liked Crowne Plaza, and I booked this hotel this time when I went to Xiamen. I told the hotel in advance that there were children who wanted an extra bed, and the hotel thoughtfully prepared children's supplies, made decorations, and gave me a cake ❤️The room has a good day and night view, and there is a robot 🤖 to pick up the things. On the second night, the children went to swim in the constant-temperature swimming pool. The temperature was suitable, which was good. I booked an executive room with a sea view, but I missed the afternoon tea and morning snacks in the executive lounge during my two-day trip. But it doesn’t matter, the overall service is so good and heart-warming!

Andy Li at the front desk was very nice and upgraded me to an incomparably large suite! ! It’s really a perfect Chris**as surprise! I took my children to take a refreshing bath in the winter, ate a wide variety of buffets, swam in the constant-temperature swimming pool, and enjoyed the 90-degree dry sauna. It was perfect! ! It's more comfortable than any other hotel I've stayed in in Xiamen! Highly recommended! Thanks again Andy li! ! I hope everyone will be lucky enough to meet him when checking in!

A decent hotel
It's just a bit inappropriate to use supplies that are not used in toiletries or guest houses.
Do these so-called "five-star hotels" of big groups really have fewer customers? They pay five-star prices to their guests and use this garbage?

msg:My husband and I took my mother-in-law out for fun and booked two three-day executive sea view rooms, which were great. To describe it in one word, it’s great value!

The scenery is one thing, but mainly in terms of service and sanitation, as well as various details. It has really surpassed many luxury hotels in the north, and is even better than the Ritz, Conrad and the like that are double the price in big cities in the north. . The last time I experienced similar detailed service was in Phuket. Moreover, the executive sea view with two breakfasts for less than 900 yuan is really a great value.

The free mini bar was replenished every day. The next morning there was noise from traffic due to road construction. After complaining to the front desk, the managers Penny and Shelly actively went to solve the problem. They also sent fruit and called many times to express their apologies. Thank you very much 🙏

The dining in the executive lounge is very up to standard, the pig's feet are so delicious, the fruit is fresh, the drinks are ice cold, it's quiet and comfortable, and the service is very friendly. The executive package includes two pieces of laundry per day, which is also very convenient. We can change into clean clothes frequently every day.

Breakfast is the only one I have seen among the many five-star and luxury hotels in China that has the Chinese and English labels of all dishes so complete and clear. Even the Ritz cannot meet this standard. Very detailed work, thumbs up 👍

The impression is very good. I will choose the executive room here next time. It is very relaxing and comfortable, and I feel at home. I really live up to it!

msg:The sea view is superb.
Because of this hotel, I am willing to check in to this hotel in Xiamen a second time. The room is clean, the room is large, and the service is first-class. It is 888 yuan including breakfast and a superior sea view king bed room.
The view from the room is great. It belongs to a newly opened hotel. Everything about the hotel facilities is relatively new. The sea is right next to the window, but the tide is usually at low tide in the morning, so half of what you see is the tidal flat. You can see the entire sea in the afternoon, and the whole room is very clean. I think cleanliness is the most important thing when staying in a hotel room, and the room is relatively large, so it is very comfortable to stay in. The bed is still very comfortable. I like it more and stayed here. Two nights.
For hotels outside the island, it costs 30 yuan to take a taxi to the island’s scenic spots, and the breakfast is rich. The taste is good, but the service must be praised. The feeling of this service really made my stay feel good. The lady gave me member drinks when I checked in. The feeling given by the hotel greatly affects the travel experience. But the ladies at this hotel are really nice. Whether it is the lady at the front desk, the lady on the customer service phone, the front desk at the swimming pool on the 5th floor, or the cleaning staff, they are all very polite and enthusiastic. This is the hotel with the best service that I have ever stayed at in Crown Plaza. OK
This hotel doubled my favorable impression of Xiamen. This may be the meaning of a good hotel. It made me deeply feel the friendliness of this city!

The service is also very good👍

The first round of Minibar is free: I like Coca-Cola, sugar-free and sugar-free, and everything is thoughtfully considered.
We also gave you a drink from the drink bar in the lobby downstairs, which is great for having a drink while waiting for the bus.

Except for the tidal flat at noon, it is beautiful at other times. The sound insulation effect is better than other hotels. I would like to praise the service attitude of the hotel staff.
There are quite a variety of breakfast buffets, and the taste is okay. The restaurant on the second floor is average in price but tastes okay.
The location is a bit remote. It is very convenient if you drive by yourself. There are expressways all around. It is also very fast to go to Jimei School Village or the island.

The location is outside the island, but every time we travel, we take a taxi at the starting price to the No. 1 subway and then go to the island to play, which is also acceptable. The room facilities are relatively new, especially the sunshade curtains, which allow us to sleep well! The front desk, concierge, and room attendants are all very polite, and the summer special drink at the concierge desk is great! Very recommendable!

(I forgot to take a photo...) I highly recommend the Hong Kong tea buffet at the restaurant on the 22nd floor. It only costs 198/person.

The sea view room that you stay in directly faces the sea view without a trace of occlusion. Tides can be seen. The hotel is very new, the room is big and comfortable. The breakfast room is also good, unlike hotels in urban areas where breakfast is crowded. Stayed for 3 nights and was very satisfied. The only thing is that there is no subway nearby. If you travel, it is more convenient to take a taxi.

msg:This hotel in this city is really great, and the service attitude is first-class. Originally booked 1 night in a parent-child room with sea view + 2 nights in an ordinary twin room, but the child was reluctant to leave as soon as he entered the parent-child room, so he asked the front desk how much it would cost to upgrade the double bed to a parent-child room, but after asking the manager for instructions, the front desk gave us a free upgrade up. The stay was really good, so we stayed for another night, and the hotel gave us a free late check-out until 3 o'clock, so that we could take a nap before catching the train. Although it may be because of the typhoon that the house supply is not too tight, but this kind of awareness of actively considering the guests is really good 👍 If you want to go, I recommend you to contact the manager Sean. We have some minor problems that cannot be solved by the big girl at the front desk. In the end It was all resolved through him (for example, the late check-out, at the beginning, the big girl killed me and could only be extended until 2 o'clock, I repeatedly asked for help to apply to the manager, and then I replied by phone to agree).
Finally, I would like to say one more thing. The service awareness of the city of Xiamen is really wonderful, especially the service spirit of the hotel and catering industry. I think it is the best among cities above the sub-provincial level in China. It really makes people love it.

msg:There is nothing to say about the hardware facilities, it is very new and very good, it can be said to be a perfect score.
In terms of software, it was almost 3:30 in the afternoon when I arrived at the hotel. The front desk said that only two of the reserved rooms were cleaned. I asked how long it would take for the other room, and the front desk only said that we should all clean it first. The room is waiting, please let us know. I said you should estimate the time, and ask the cleaning lady how long it will take, so that we can arrange the next itinerary. The front desk told us to wait in the room. No matter what I asked, the front desk just said a few words, which made it very popular. Typically, I won’t tell you how long it will take, and I don’t want to ask my colleagues. I don’t care. How long are you going to wait for the attitude, zero points for service! If it weren't for the attitude of the little brother in the lobby, I would give zero points in terms of service.
In addition, the members gave a drink coupon when they checked in. I went to see it, and I can only exchange it for some cheap fruit juice (the kind that pours you a glass in a large bottle) or Tsingtao Beer for a few dollars. Drinks exceeding 10 yuan are not allowed, so It's better not to send it than to be stingy.
For breakfast, charges for children over 1.2 meters are strictly enforced.
The swimming pool is very small, and the experience is very bad if there are more than 10 people. The actual situation is that there are at least 20 people in it for a long time.
Generally speaking, the facilities in the room are full marks, and the service is average (mainly because the front desk is so poor that it gets too many points, and other things like the lobby, cleaning, and food delivery staff are actually okay).

For friends who often stay at Crowne Plaza and other Intercontinental hotels, this short review may be a good reference. First of all, I am more The bedroom hygiene, which is important, is still acceptable. Relatively speaking, it is because it is relatively new. The hygiene and bathroom are quite satisfactory and can be trusted. Secondly, when it comes to breakfast, I cannot give a passing score. The breakfast style is relatively simple and the service attitude is not good. It needs It's hard to fill things up. The chef always has cold words and expressions towards people, and is very impatient. Even children can feel this. Let's talk about the gym and swimming pool. These two places are also more important to me. Because I have a fitness habit, when I choose a hotel, I will focus on seeing these two services before I check in. Generally, Crowne Plaza has a gym and swimming pool. This is the main reason why I have always been a member of InterContinental Hotels. , Let’s talk about the gym first. The equipment is quite satisfactory and everything is there, but the service is zero, let alone service, because there is no service at all, no towels, no water glasses, nothing. Maybe the hotel outsources this place to a third party. There are three parties, and it feels like there is no management anymore. The gym is full of ignorant children. They can run around and play with dangerous fitness equipment, treadmills, and everything they want to touch and play with. There is no safety at all. Of course, the feeling it brings to fitness residents is that they no longer want to stay in the gym for one more second. Parents of their children who have no safety awareness have also turned into fitness experts, allowing them to You have to retreat and run away. I'm worried about witnessing some accident, so it's better to walk away. The swimming pool, emmm... Not to mention, it can be described as horrific. It was filled with twenty or thirty children from morning to late at night. It seemed that it was outsourced to a third party, so the hotel guests were not there at all. Don't even think about swimming. Believe me, the gym and swimming pool in this so-called Crowne Plaza hotel are not reserved for guests, but are used to make money for third parties. But I would like to ask the hotel management, Should you lower your so-called five-star standard charges? Because these two services are actually a kind of fraud on customers, aren't they? Finally, let me talk about the front desk of this hotel... emmmm..., well, I am too lazy to talk about it. I hope that when everyone reads this review, they will seriously consider whether this place is suitable for staying. My suggestion is , it is better to spend an extra two hundred yuan to live in a first-class location on the island, with the same five-star trea**ent, which is much more cost-effective than here.

The only thing that is not satisfactory is the sea view double bed room. The 1.8-meter bed is a bit small, and the two pillows provided are too soft, which is not very friendly to guests with poor cervical spine.





Environment: Upgraded to a sea view king bed room, the sea view is great. However, the location of the hotel is a bit remote. The lake next to it seems to be a place for sewage trea**ent. Passing by the lake has a bit of a smell, so there is nothing to go around the hotel, and it is not too close to several important attractions in Jimei, such as Jimei School Village.


Service: Free coffee dessert for two people, the dessert tastes great, there is a robot delivery service, the Minibar drinks a lot and the first round is free, I feel the service of being at home.

This time the arrangement is to experience the two newly opened hotels of the InterContinental Group in Xiamen; The night before, I received a call from the Crowne Plaza Hotel asking about my check-in time tomorrow and what needs I have for the room. This is something that few hotels do. Do it, very impressed!
It takes 20 minutes to drive from Haicang to Jimei Holiday. Crowne Plaza Jimei is located on the edge of the coastline, and there are no other buildings around. The landmark location of the hotel is obvious. The view from each floor of the hotel is very good. It is a taxi ride from Jimei School Village Ten minutes, it is very convenient to get in and out.
The high-ceilinged lobby of the hotel is magnificent and spacious. There are also two small shops selling tea and sandalwood, which are very characteristic of southern Fujian. The check-in at the front desk is very fast, and the service staff is very friendly. They also told me that they have followed my proposal Arrange the room according to the needs, and then in addition to guiding the location of the restaurant for breakfast, I also specially recommend that the Chaofengxuan Chinese Restaurant on the second floor of the hotel has a special meal for 188 yuan per person. I went to try it. There are many Cantonese dishes, and the taste is very authentic. The most recommended is the dim sum made of various shrimps and the fresh and tender baked small yellow croaker. There are many varieties of meals but the portions are not large. You can taste many different ingredients.
This time I arranged to live in a sea view room with a high floor. As soon as I opened the door, I saw a blue bay and distant mountain views, as well as patches of fishing boats. It was beautiful; the sea view outside the window in the afternoon, dusk, night and morning The scenery I saw was different; the room is simple, black, white and gray tones, exquisite and simple, and the space is comfortable, the air conditioner is cold enough and the air circulation is good, there is no peculiar smell at all, and it is also very clean. To my surprise, there are active It's so considerate to help turn down the bed.
Breakfast is from 6:30 to 10:30. There are Chinese and Western dishes, desserts, and southern Fujian specialties. There are many types, fresh and delicious. For breakfast, you must try noodle paste and seafood sand tea noodles, as well as eight kinds of fruits and Freshly squeezed juice, the restaurant is very polite from the waiters who take the seats to the waiters in the venue, and they will also serve the dishes for the guests. The whole dining environment is very comfortable.
There is one more place to introduce. The executive lounge on the 22nd floor has floor-to-ceiling windows with a 270-degree semi-sea view. It has a high ceiling and exquisite decoration. It is more like a high-end private club. Specific guests can come to enjoy afternoon tea and evening entertainment. Bartending; next to it is a Bayview 22 restaurant and bar. But it was closed during my stay, and I look forward to drinking wine in the bar with an invincible sea view at night when I come back next time.
I have traveled to Xiamen at least ten times before and after. The Crowne Plaza Jimei Hotel is the highest overall rating among hotels of the same level I have stayed in Xiamen. It has a clean and tidy environment, considerate service, delicious meals, and exquisite, simple and a**ospheric decoration. Juan, complete equipment, thanks to Cissy, and Eva for your warm reception and thanks to Sherry at the front desk, Evelyn and the beauties in the restaurant, you gave me the best ending during my eight-day trip to Fujian!
Thank you so much!

Only when you have a good rest can you have fun. The hotel's buffet breakfast also has a lot of varieties, and everyone can choose what suits them. There is also an executive lounge where you can drink afternoon tea, light meals are also available in the evening, and the swimming pool is also very clean.

The management of the hotel attaches great importance to the opinions of the guests, and promptly handles and solves the problems of the guests. The first choice for future travel.

Hygiene: The overall clean and bright rooms have a simple and elegant design. One of the rooms feels like a newly renovated room, and the other one does not.
The breakfast is rich, with noodles, rice noodles, and freshly fried chicken chops. There is also a small children's playground outside. Overall, I am very satisfied.

ps When I checked out, I saw a star chasing girl in the lobby. It seems that INTO1 lives here. Hahaha, what a coincidence

msg:I took my family out to play, and chose Xiamen cp after hesitation. The service of this hotel is very surprising. The manager on duty, Zoe, was very enthusiastic when we checked in. He saw us and greeted us before we even got to the front desk. It felt very good. Sherry's call before moving in and my sister's attention during the stay make people feel that they are being taken care of all the time. Come to Xiamen CP to find her! There is also a concierge at the door to greet you, and the luggage is also delivered to the room. It really is a five-star service.
Let’s talk about the hotel. The hotel itself is also newly opened. The facilities and equipment are all very new. There is no rusty feeling. The design is simple but useful. The mini bar in the room is actually free, which is quite surprising, because the first day The sea view was fully booked, so I didn't experience it. The next day I had a room and decided to continue to stay and change to the sea view. One thing to say, both the sea view and the city view are beautiful! Facing the sea and back facing the lake, watching the moon rise and set, the tide ebbs and flows, and feel the ecological cycle of nature. Egrets fly gently across the sea without taking a cloud~
Finally, let me mention the restaurant by the way. The breakfast is rich, and it also combines the tastes of all parties, and it also has the characteristics of southern Fujian. It is very cost-effective to add money to order a breakfast! Free parking ✓ Come and experience it, everyone!

She has been very concerned about our feelings for three days after staying here. The room also specially arranged a good location for us. The lighting is very good and the view of the sea is also very good. It is spacious, and on the first day of check-in, the guest room also helped turn down the bed and delivered milk, which made my heart warm. Both check-in and check-out Sherry invited us to experience the hotel's executive lounge. On the day of check-out, the plane flew at 8 o'clock in the evening. The lounge manager Eva welcomed us warmly. The service is considerate. The younger sister Susie downstairs and the concierge colleague Kevin were very enthusiastic when checking out. Thank you for this trip to Xiamen. I met the big family of Crowne Plaza Jimei, and it was as easy as going home.

Because you are driving by car, you don’t have to worry about the distance from the scenic spot. This area is relatively quiet and suitable for vacation and rest. The hotel's catering is very comprehensive. I like their coffee for breakfast. I won't comment on the rest because I have a bad appetite recently. Most importantly, thank you to Josie Lynn and Jack for their help, service attitude and meeting customer needs, thumbs up*n. The following is the scenery I took at low tide in the afternoon.

First of all, when I checked in at around 5 pm, I was asked to wait for more than half an hour. They said the room was still being cleaned, but there was a smell of cigarette smoke. They also asked me what happened to the parent-child room. It felt like there was an extra children's tent in the ordinary double room. Children's pillows and quilt covers are 400-500 yuan more than those for double rooms. I like swimming. I went to the swimming pool. My heart dropped. It was too small. It was almost like a children's swimming pool. It is not recommended to stay. 300-400 yuan a night for business is acceptable.

There was chrysanthemum tea in a small box in the room. I asked for another one on the third day, but the customer service told me that it would be given on the first day of check-in, which is more than 800 per day. Can't even bring a drink to the room? Then if I check out and reopen, won’t I still have to pay? What you see when you wake up in the sea view room every morning is a quagmire at low tide. There is no water. It is far from anywhere. The taxi fare is enough to pay for the room every day. I don’t recommend it.

Facilities: The air conditioner doesn't heat up at all. The northerners said it was really cold. They only brought the electric heater when they called. The attitude of the maintenance staff is quite good, but the room is real, so that's it.

msg:I was a little disappointed when I rarely reviewed this hotel when I stayed in a hotel. It was not as standard as expected at the same price. When I entered the room, I found a side door and garbage paper towels next to the sofa. I felt weird and unspeakable and decided to go to the front desk to change rooms. I still found stains on the pillow, so I habitually used the disposable bath towel I brought with me to check out for one night. I guess I won't choose a hotel like this in the future, which is a bit disappointing.

msg:The hotel meets the five-star standard, especially the warm and thoughtful service of zoe at the front desk. Our family of three booked only 2 breakfasts, and zoe gave one more breakfast for two days, and upgraded the deluxe sea view twin room to an executive sea view the next day Twin room, thank you very much. The breakfast is very rich, and the sand tea noodles taste great! The room layout and decoration design are very satisfactory, but the sea view here is not a beach sea view, which is a little disappointing. If you don't want to see the sea view, it is recommended to choose the more spacious executive twin room. There are no shops nearby, and it is very close to the sea bike path. We are traveling by car, and it is not far from Jimei School Village. Jimei School Village at night looks like a snack street.
In addition, the only thing I am dissatisfied with is the restaurant on the second floor of the hotel. Cantonese siu mei doubles for 48 yuan a piece. It is actually two pieces of char siu and two pieces of chicken. I realized the meaning of "2 pieces each" on the menu. pitted.

There is no heating and air conditioning during the day. 3. It is said that there is heating air conditioning at night, but I don’t feel it. Moreover, no matter how many times you change the air conditioning mode, it will return to the cold air mode. I change it every time I get up at night. This is simply unacceptable. If you come back with a cold while traveling, you will be laughing your ass off. 4. The free refrigerator drinks were not replenished the next day. . .
I probably won’t stay here again, disappointed.

The cafeteria and the bar on the 22nd floor are both good and the staff are courteous. Check-in was relatively slow. It took an hour to arrange one room, and it took 4 hours to arrange the second room. Xiao Li and Xiao Su in the concierge depar**ent are good. They sent greeting cards to their daughters. In addition, they delivered birthday cakes as soon as they stayed in the hotel. ￼

At that time, there was a company holding an event in the hotel, and there were many people, but the little sister at the front desk helped me quickly arrange a room. The sea view of the room is worthy of the name, the room is very new, and the gym is big enough. What was even more surprising was that when my flight at noon was canceled the next day, I could only stay at the hotel until 3 o'clock, waiting for the next flight. They gave me the business center on the top floor, where I can have a quiet meeting. It is very considerate, and I will continue to come next time. The nearby Jimei Sea Running Track is also a big surprise!

I was upgraded just to be able to eat breakfast, but I ran down hungry and was told that breakfast was not included. The front desk said that breakfast was not included because of the discounted price. Why didn’t you tell me when you upgraded the suite? Why didn’t you upgrade the suite at a later date? By the way, other people's common rooms can provide breakfast, but my suite doesn't have breakfast? Is it specially killed? The more times you live, the worse you will be cheated, right? The sofa in your suite is so dirty, did I say that?

The newly opened Crowne Plaza is a must, and the hardware and software standards are very good. It is very convenient to drive all the way from the airport to Xiamen, and the parking lot is also very large. The partition of the room is very clear, and you can see the sea at a glance. There is also a layout suitable for drinking tea while watching the beach, which is very considerate. This time I booked a high-level deluxe room and can enjoy the hotel's VIP room, which is simply the most intimate service this time.

The breakfast was very rich. Although there was a conference when I first arrived, it was full of people every morning, but the quality and variety of the breakfast were not affected at all. This is a big praise! Speaking of the VIP Pavilion, the daily afternoon tea and dinner are happy and satisfying. Not only are they delicious, but the types are different every day.

Not to mention the standard of service, the wall crack is recommended, and the five-star experience is super praised!

In addition, I would like to thank Zhu Yanqin, Li Yanyun, Tan Qiufeng, Huang Zhuanglian, and Tang Yujiao for opening the screen for the peacock I decorated, Zhu Yanqin for the swan, elephant and deer, and Huang Jieying for the warm baby prepared for me.

The breakfast is particularly rich, with freshly fried pork chops and chicken chops in the morning. In the evening, I ate the refreshment buffet on the second floor of the hotel, and the taste was also very good.

msg:Mid-Autumn Festival to Xiamen, stay at Crowne Plaza Jimei. It is a pity that this stay experience did not meet expectations. After all, many places in a hotel with such a high rating really make me unhappy. It may also be that there is a big gap compared to the subsequent Tongan Marriott Hotel. Let’s talk about some unsatisfactory places first. First, the hotel marked the wrong price in the system when booking the room. Fortunately, Ctrip solved the problem quickly. Because InterContinental's brands also choose Ctrip to book a room with points and points. But when I checked in, the hotel said that I booked a package and could not give points. I was a little surprised. Since the two platforms cooperate, why can't they share? Secondly, first of all, the two concierges at the entrance of the hotel did not provide services to help with luggage. So are the two concierges playing the role of security? After entering the hotel, the guide has been playing with the mobile phone. Fortunately, the front desk is more obvious. The attitude of the front desk is quite good. What's more annoying is that it's here again. The dining bar on the 22nd floor of the Mid-Autumn Festival was closed on the day I went. The same set meal for two cannot be used in the lobby bar on the 22nd floor without prior notice. Since the Haagen-Dazs event can only be used on the 22nd floor, please close the purchase channel and ask the front desk to ask me to go to the restaurant on the 1st floor. I went to the restaurant on the 1st floor and said that the event on the 22nd floor cannot be used on the first floor. The front desk said that the first floor and the 22nd floor are the same team. Let the guests run back and forth. Can't figure out what's going on inside of you? In the end, I directly refunded the mood. Let's talk about the facilities, the hotel has upgraded the sea view room. The view is still ok. 800 price room does not have a bathtub is indeed unexpected. I know that the positioning of Crowne Plaza is relatively low, but I didn't expect it to be the level of Da Atour. It wasn't a big deal that the massive bathroom door knocked on my foot. The location of the hotel is not very good, and it is not convenient to go to the scenic spots and beaches. For those who want to play on the island, I would recommend the ones on Huandao Road. The hotel is newly opened. However, some facilities have been somewhat aging, and the tea table has been covered with tea stains. It is recommended that the hotel lay some tablecloths for better. And the highway by the sea side is quite noisy. The scenery of the hotel is good, but the use of the public area does require some thought. It is a pity that such a good outdoor viewing platform on the fifth floor is not used. The pool gym has also been outsourced. The experience is also very general. Also, the staff service is uneven. Some are very enthusiastic. And some completely ignore the guests. This needs to be focused on training. A carton of milk was given on the night of check-in, but the two of us might as well not send it. I hope the hotel can find out its positioning, whether it wants to do business, parent-child or vacation. After all, if you want to be a 700➕ hotel, you can't ask yourself at the level of Atour and Holiday. Also talk about the advantages of the hotel. First of all, the food is quite ok, whether it is breakfast or a barbecue meal for two in the package. Great taste and good service. Hope this will continue. Secondly the bed was very comfortable. Sleep is good. The room is bright and the facilities are relatively new. The final check-out deposit settlement including the check-out process is also relatively fast. Expect to keep. Finally, I hope the hotel will get better and better. Next time I come to Xiamen, I should not choose it. It is more reliable for resort hotels and luxury hotels.

Without this room, there is also a lack of blockbusters in the circle of friends. After staying for 2 days, I actually wanted to stay for another night, but because of Children go home on time if they have a class reason. It is an off-island hotel. It takes 30 minutes to get to Shapowei, but it is too convenient to call a car. You can get on the bus in almost 5 minutes. The off-island hotel is quiet. I like it, so I will choose it when I have a chance next time. would recommend. The key point is that the nucleic acid is on the 4th floor of the hotel, which is super convenient👍

msg:This hotel left me speechless. It was already 3:30 in the afternoon when I arrived at the hotel. I was informed that the room would be upgraded to a parent-child room. I guess there was no room with a king bed with sea view. But I still had to wait for two hours. I said I didn’t want to upgrade, but my daughter wanted to sleep. I still have to wait, but forget it. There is a staff member of the ball pool who refuses to let me in because I am over 140cm tall. First of all, it is too inhumane. I was given two drink coupons and can only get Coke and Sprite. The children want to exchange for small cakes. No, I got the room at 7pm. After being scolded by me, they compensated us with a small cake, worth 36, but then the water was cut off, and the child had to wear a bathrobe for half of the bath. I cried cold, but the hotel didn’t offer any solution or compensation. They also said it was not their fault. So what should I do if my child gets a cold? Will you care about us in the future? Absolutely, absolutely nothing. The service attitude cannot be directly proportional to that of the hotel. The same intercontinental management is very important. There was welcome fruit in the order, but there was nothing. I called and said that the kitchen was closed. It was rubbish.

1. In the Cantonese restaurant on the second floor, we had snacks that day. It was not a buffet. When we asked the waiter how much the tea was, the first waiter said that there was no charge for snacks and there was a charge for the buffet, huh? What does it mean? Then the second waiter came over and I said let’s get a pot of tea. She said it would be charged zero o’clock. Um? What is this operation? We ordered drinks. Then, halfway through the meal, a man came over and brought a pot of tea. I said tactfully (hehe), we didn’t order it. The waiter said it was for you. When checking out, we asked To sign the bill, the waiter said, I'll ask the front desk if you can sign it. What kind of operations are these? Well, it's really messy.
2. For breakfast on the first floor, children above 1.4 meters are charged full price, and children between 1.2 and 1.4 meters in height are charged 69. In fact, every hotel has this rule, but we have been to many hotels and none of them really charge. I can understand that this is According to hotel regulations, fees should be charged as they should, but this kind of fee cannot be used as a new profit model for the hotel. Moreover, it is still chaotic. If you chat with him for a few words, he will give you a discount.
3. A deposit of 500 was collected in advance when we checked in (I thought it was so small at the time). We were used to eating in the hotel. Suddenly, on the fourth day of our stay, the front desk called and asked for an additional deposit. We forgot to go out for fun the next morning and called when we came back. I came after him again. On the morning of the third day, I quickly added a deposit of 1,500. The receptionist said, are you still spending money in the hotel? I, I, am really not sure. In fact, I understand that he wants to judge how much deposit I need to pay, but Your way of asking this question is really not very smart.

My husband knew that I booked a room in this hotel on Friday night, secretly went to the hotel to upgrade the room to a suite, and then started to contact my friends and the proposal plan, and it really gave me a big surprise on the day of the proposal. When I entered the room, there was a camera recording and shooting at us, and then I watched the video of the marriage proposal on the hotel TV. The secret door on the left opened quietly, and there were balloons and our photos. There were still a few friends standing there. I was stunned for a while. The door opened, and the setting was set inside. My husband who had all my friends inside knew that I was going on a business trip next weekend two days before the proposal, and when I got back from the business trip, I was going to get engaged, so it took two days to propose on this weekend. He planned everything, made the video the day before the proposal and didn't go to bed until four o'clock? I didn't expect him to do so much in just one or two days. I'm really touched
This hotel was newly built last year, very new! The service is also very good, very
recommend! Todd Lin, the manager of the whole process, cooperated with my husband to watch the scene, arrange the room, and enter the venue ahead of schedule! Very caring! This suite is also perfect for a marriage proposal!

msg:Because it is a newly opened hotel, I thought it would be good for word of mouth, and the service and facilities should be good. Who knows, on the contrary, it is also a rare and poor experience for so many years. There are mainly the following points to complain, I hope to give some tips to parents who are choosing a hotel:
1. We are a family of four traveling, old and young. We have booked two rooms. We hope to arrange the same floor when we check in, so that we can take care of them easily. The front desk and the duty manager insisted that the room was full and could not be arranged. There are two rooms separated by four floors.
The whole floor where the second room was located smelled of smoke, and it was more obvious in the room. We asked for a room change, but we didn't agree at first, only to provide an air purifier. Only after strong request and negotiation did we agree to change rooms.
At this time, I was surprised. I just said that the room was full, and now there is room to spare? After further communication, I suddenly realized: they do have vacant rooms, but they have to reserve them for "pre-arrival" guests. I was puzzled. I also pre-arrived. Compared with the guests who haven't checked in yet, we still arrive first. There's always a first come first! Is it because we are the customers who purchased the package and are different from ordinary customers?
Again, because we didn't say in advance that we wanted a similar room. I just wanted to ask, is it incomprehensible for a family to travel and live in similar rooms according to normal logic, at least on the same floor? What is the basis for leaving empty rooms to the so-called "pre-arrival" guests and not assigning them to us?
Sure enough, in the end, under what they called "difficult" deployment, they were given two more rooms on the same floor.
This process is too tortuous and energy-consuming to negotiate, which makes me strongly feel the weakness as a consumer, the asymmetry of hotel information, and the issue of integrity. If you don't insist, you may not be able to defend your rights.
2. Because we arrived by plane at 10:00 at night, it was almost 1:00 in the morning after changing the room. After the change, the two rooms still smelled of smoke. I haven't slept well all night, not to mention the elderly and children. Because of the trouble of changing rooms, we asked the front desk to deal with the smoke smell in the room in the early morning, hoping to deal with it before we went out to play. After returning to the room after 8 o'clock in the evening, I found that the smoke smell in one of the rooms was difficult to remove (after I came back, I asked the waiter to come in and spray the air freshener once, and the smoke smell came out again after dissipating). It is impossible, only to change rooms again.
The hotel is indeed non-smoking throughout the area, but there are no effective measures to supervise the guests not to smoke, and there is no good way to get rid of the smoke smell in the room. The probability of staying in a smoke-smelling room is really high, and it is the guests who suffer.
3. The package of the hotel we purchased included fruits and afternoon tea, which is far from the package of the five-star hotel I have experienced before. There are three small pieces of fruit, and afternoon tea cannot be reserved and delivered during the travel time of the guests. room. Such packages are useless.
4. Small complaints: The first photo is of stains on the sofa, and the bathroom was not cleaned in time. The cup is cracked. There is no full-length mirror in the suite.

msg:First of all, the price/performance ratio of the hotel is absolutely OK. What else can I say about the sea view room at this price (but note that it is not a 24-hour sea view, there is a mudflat after the tide ebbs, and friends who mind) The Cantonese cuisine on the second floor is worth eating! The minibar is free. There are swimming pools and gyms, but the swimming pool is too small and it accepts students from outside, and there are many people in the morning. I habitually comment on the hotel to mention the lack of details, I hope the hotel will get better and better! I'm not a black fan
·
On the first day of check-in, there was a welcome at the door, but no help with luggage (if it was five-star, it would be unqualified to enter the door) and watched us carry our large and small bags inside. The aroma in the lobby is a bit too strong, and I inhaled a full lung as soon as I entered it.
It is not a special parent-child hotel, there is no park outside, and there is a slide inside for children to play indoors. But suitable for working with children
This hotel should have received a lot of conference business recently, there are many people in the lobby,
There are also many people checking in, and then there are also many cleaning staff...
There are aunts and uncles waiting for cleaning with small baskets everywhere in the lobby, and there are several people at the elevator door.
I thought it was just that time period more...
Later, I often met in the lobby.... (I understand the original intention of the hotel to keep it clean! The frequency and walking path of this aunt still need to be trained! The lobby and public areas of the hotel I stayed in before were almost invisible to cleaning staff! Also Clean and hygienic!
Breakfast, in line with a wide variety of five-star hotels! Make some suggestions. The bread and croissants are too big, and you can't eat one. If you want to eat something else, it will be wasted. Is it possible to make it small and delicate? Many dishes are not marked with the name of the dish, and it is all guesswork to know what it is. The service staff was a little too quick, and when I went to pick up a meal, all my cutlery was taken away... The chef came out to add porridge and actually wore slippers 😂...
The time in the elevator is 10 minutes different from Beijing time......
In the executive lounge on the 22nd floor, there is actually a green radish on the table...
The quality of the toiletries in the room is similar to that of the 200 yuan express hotel in the market! The shower gel is also fixed with a metal frame to prevent guests from stealing it?
Around 400 lives in Atour, although small but exquisite.
More than 600 people live in a sea-view room. Although it is large, the details are not precise and a bit unsuitable. Understand what I mean.
How to say it, I feel that the hotel hardware and software do not match, and the service details need to be improved. Go to other brand hotels to learn more.
One more thing to add. The price/performance ratio is very high, and it has everything, but it is not detailed enough! Hope it gets better and better!

msg:When the taxi arrived at the door, I was amazed. The roadside environment was already very good and very stylish. Because I arrived in the middle of the night, I set this price. I didn't have very high expectations for the hotel, but the result completely exceeded expectations! The facilities in the room are great!
Hygiene: I must mention that I have to see how the bathroom is when I live in a hotel. This is really good. The hygiene area is very large! There is a small toilet dedicated to the toilet. All the facilities look very new. In addition, the lighting design of the toilet part is also very good. This part is also completely enjoyable.
View: 270-degree windows and electric curtains
* The most detailed is that there are rulers, sticky notes and paper clips in the box on the desk!
I knew that every day in Xiamen was booked here! Just stay in the room and enjoy! Will definitely come again next time! Also, thank you Todd Lin for your patient service!

From check-in to check-out, the experience is really good, with scenery, hardware facilities, welcome fruit, minibar, and breakfast.
It's just that I would like to ask the managers to consider whether it is appropriate to emphasize personal praise and whether this method or assessment that requires real-name praise is appropriate. The reason why employees have to serve customers and hand over their names must be related to the inclination of managers. The entry of customers into the store is the result of the entire team's flow service, and it is indispensable. But it's not that the chef of the restaurant didn't hand over the business card, which means the dishes were not delicious, and the room service staff didn't hand over the business card, which means the room was not clean. Or think more about how to serve customers with the power of a team. Guestism doesn't go long.

🧹Hygiene: I am obsessed with cleanliness, so a clean indoor environment is the primary condition for me to choose a hotel.

🍃Environment: Jimei District is outside the island, it is relatively remote, because of the work relationship, the hotel here is booked.

🔔Service: I booked a sea view room, but I didn't expect that the sound insulation on the side by the sea is not very good. You can hear the traffic coming and going at night, and there are guests in the corridor making loud noises and opening and closing the door. However, the duty manager communicated in time to change other rooms. Just got a good night's sleep.

The breakfast is also good, quite rich.

It is said to be a new hotel outside the island, and it is not very far from the airport. A northerner can still have the time to see the sky, the sea and the clouds on the road, which is great! The gray room is simple and a**ospheric, and the sea view room of course has an invincible sea view, and you can also see the interesting trajectory of ebb and flow. The room is big enough to have tea. Huaxiangyuan tea products support, the price is reasonable. The smell of the toiletries is so my wife likes it, happy! The other side of the hotel faces the city landscape, and the world is full of fireworks. I like the friendliness/professionalism of the staff, everyone communicates with a smile, and the ladies are so gentle. Due to professional reasons, I have a lot of luggage. Ekon and Kent have helped me to solve various problems since I checked in. Ekon helped me with luggage and small bags. They also helped me to continue my stay in time. Thank you Ekon for your help. I can feel the care and patience that hotel practitioners need. In the hot Xiamen, you can work in a comfortable environment. ps: There are TV channels I like! ! National Geographic! ! ! ! yeah! ! !

Personally, I especially like the integrated design of the bar and the desk. The scattered space design makes people shine. The floor-to-ceiling glass windows have a wide field of vision and a panoramic view of the sea. When the night falls, there is a unique view. Whether you have a cup of tea or coffee, it is worth staying by the window. There is a children's favorite amu*****t park on the first floor of the hotel. While the children are roaming in the happy world, the afternoon tea time next to the amu*****t park is our best choice. For dinner, we choose the Western-style set menu, from the appetizer meal. Bags, salads, thick soups, main course steaks, desserts... The exquisite presentation makes people happy, and even children like it frequently! It is best to focus on the service of the hotel. Whether it is the front desk, afternoon tea or dinner restaurant on the first floor, the service of the hotel staff reflects a high level. Special thanks to the three employees of Todd Kent Leslie. Because of your excellent service, this time The hotel experience is very comfortable.

msg:The hotel facilities are very new. The hotel is located on the seaside of Jimei District. It is separated from the sea all the way. There is a special running track along the coast. The scenery is very beautiful. It is very close to the Garden Expo Park and the Tan Kah Kee Memorial Hall.
The room is large, and the view outside is clear from the floor-to-ceiling windows. The bed and linen are new and comfortable.
The service is very warm, thoughtful and meticulous, and the several staff members I have come into contact with are young and highly professional.
Special thanks to Xiao Tang for confirming the flight by phone one day in advance, offering to arrange pick-up, and bringing a small gift to the room to greet him.
I would also like to thank Lin Xiang, Huang Shaoxian and Li Guipeng for their enthusiasm and care.
The free fruits and snacks prepared in the room are very intimate.
The afternoon tea at the Bay View Bar on the 22nd floor of the hotel is exquisite and delicious.
The breakfast is rich in variety, compatible with Chinese and Western.

Wang Baoyu and the handsome supervisor at the front desk took the initiative to suggest that they contacted Ctrip and changed it to a two-night package of more than 1,300 yuan. The new hotel has good room facilities. The family stayed in the hotel on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. It was very warm. It felt like home. I even saw the fireworks from the hotel on New Year's Eve. Close to the sea, overlooking the sea from the room, stayed for two nights, and often saw high and low tides. In a word, the most memorable part of this trip to Xiamen is this hotel. I will definitely choose to stay in this hotel next time, and I will stay in this hotel for a few more days.

msg:Take your daughter to experience the newly opened hotel in Jimei. The hotel faces the sea and the scenery is very good. There is a park next to the hotel where many egrets live and the ecological environment is very good.

The check-in procedure was very quick, and two welcome drinks were presented, which can be used in the lobby bar.

The sea-view room is spacious and bright. When you open the curtains, you can see the entire sea, and you can watch the ebb and flow of the tide in the room.

For dinner, I chose a buffet in a western restaurant. There are many types of dishes, fruits, and drinks, and each table has its own small hot pot. The desserts are very colorful, and the seafood and teppanyaki area are also very good. There is a small playground next to the restaurant, where my daughter has a lot of fun.

There is also a restaurant on the 22nd floor, with a good view, 270-degree transparent glass, looking out to the sea.

The attitude of the staff encountered during the whole stay was very good, very kind and very pleasant.

The front desk staff is very enthusiastic and helped us upgrade to a sea view room for free. The bed, called the front desk, quickly sent the room card, and was very enthusiastic to help us carry our luggage, the service was in place. In the afternoon, I took the children to swim in the hotel's swimming pool. The water is constant temperature, which is very comfortable! I experienced the hotel's buffet in the evening. The environment is good and the service is very good. There is a children's play area next to the restaurant, which is enough for children to play for a night, and adults can eat with peace of mind. In short, this hotel is worth recommending. I spent a pleasant weekend here. The children are reluctant to part. I will come again next time!

There is coffee when you go through the formalities, and you are very considerate when you leave. Do you need to pack coffee? However, there is a children's playground in the lobby on the first floor of the hotel. There are many children and it is very noisy. I was woken up by the children next door at 7:00 in the morning. I opened the door and saw that there were four children living there, and the sound insulation effect was poor. Another point is the most depressing. I went to check in at 3:30 in the afternoon and told that there was no room and the room had to be cleaned. It was not until 5:30 in the afternoon that I was informed that there was a room coming out, and the other one had to wait. This aspect must be complained.

From the view point of view, the sea is outside the window, which can be called a quiet place in the middle of the noise; from the point of view of the facilities, the bed is comfortable, and other facilities also have a good sense of experience; from the point of view of the service, the breakfast is rich, and the most authentic oyster omelette can be eaten in the guest room. .
In particular, I would like to thank Xiao Lai, Xiao Wang, Xiao Zeng and other staff members of the hotel. Not only did they collect money, but they also tried their best to optimize the route and help me send the lost wallet back to Nanjing when there were many difficulties in reality. Thank you so much!

The style of the room is stylish, light and luxurious, and the details are full of care. The bedding and toiletries are first-line brands, and the experience is excellent. The most important thing is the invincible sea view, the curtains are opened, and the sparkling sea outside the panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows is a veritable sea view room!
The afternoon tea in the executive lounge on the 22nd floor is simply amazing. It not only has 270-degree sea views but also delicious desserts. Enjoy a cup of coffee while watching the sunset. The a**osphere is full, and it is also a great place to take pictures and check in.
The breakfast was very hearty, and the Chinese restaurant’s dishes tasted first-rate, surpassing most five-star hotels. The experience of staying in the restaurant this time all exceeded expectations.
The waiters at the front desk and restaurant have super good service attitude, professional and patient
Highly recommended for business trip to Xiamen

設施：很新，很乾凈，房間有無線充電，電梯廳有座椅和坐墊
衞生：衞生非常乾淨安心，看得出這家衞生很嚴格，而且保潔工作人員非常熱情
環境：環境非常好，地點不在島內，但周邊景色非常美，很安靜，高層視野特別棒。打車很方便，門口300米還有公交
服務：每個工作人員的服務都滿分！有歡迎電話瞭解需要，入住時前台對調換房間的需求也都耐心滿足，很替顧客着想，非常專業！衞生超級乾淨，早餐和行政酒廊餐食和服務都很不錯

這家皇冠值得這麼多字，閉眼選它沒錯！

msg:風景不錯，開窗就可以看到海，兩個娃都非常喜歡窗外風景，外面晚了回來總是坐在落地窗前觀望。服務也是非常到位，這方面因為攜帶兩娃感受頗深：首先禮賓部幫忙拿運行李非常積極主動，不僅來和走時兩次行李都是全程運送，而且每次出去我帶的摺疊嬰兒車都幫我拿放。此外尤其是感謝打掃衞生的遊大姐，一般來説有孩子的房間衞生會比較難打掃，我家娃那幾天還不舒服，咳嗽咳着就吐了，有時候紙尿褲漏尿，所以幾乎每天都要換床單被罩，遊大姐總是收拾乾乾淨淨的，有次見到小寶吐了，在那麼忙的情景下她還過來幫忙。所以酒店無論是硬件還是軟件都非常贊。唯一遺憾的是小童樂園在維修，沒有投用，否則溜娃更方便了。

來看Eason演唱會，第一天為了方便選了個會展中心附近的酒店，簡直大大失望…想到了因為距離會有些遠的皇冠酒店，第二天果斷換酒店。
到達酒店前微聯繫了前台人員備註深度清潔，到了以後大堂明亮有好聞的香氛味，因為房間仍在清潔中，所以工作人員很熱心的幫我們寄存了行李。並且贈送了飲品券。
在外面因為回來太晚，又麻煩工作人員把行李送到客房，他們非常熱心的答應。
回來後開箱房間，真實做到了一塵不染，連枱燈架的拐角都沒有任何積灰，本潔癖患者真的非常滿意，也很感動客房服務人員的熱情和細心👍🏻
有需要的物品就賓客服務中心會很快送過來，酒店電視會顯示所有入住客人的名字，房間風景很好，全自動智能化。除此之外，按金收取合理，退按金速度也是秒退。

這是我在廈門最好的一次入住體驗，以後也會常來。感謝所有為我們服務的工作人員，給你們點贊！🙏🏻👍🏻

msg:剛到酒店的時候門口服務生很快的幫忙打開車門，幫忙拿行李，走進大堂可以聞到一股清香，不刺鼻，很解壓。入住期間，每天的打掃很快速，很乾凈，因為是行政房型，所以每天可以免費在22層品嚐下午茶和五點半開始的歡樂小食，22層的一男一女兩名服務人員，全程笑容，説話得體，態度和善，特別好。雖然酒店門口是一條馬路，但是晚上把窗户關上，房間特別安靜，可以安然入睡，酒店左側有一個小湖，門口是大海，可以走地下通道過去海邊，因為酒店在集美區屬於島外所以出行遠距離衹能打車，近距離可以選擇騎行共享單車或者電動車，總體來説，如果需要一個愜意的環境，安靜舒服的睡眠和很好的服務，集美海景皇冠假日酒店是一個不錯的選擇，但是相對弊端也很明顯就是出行交通問題，完全看個人的選擇了，我個人覺得這個酒店是一個很好的選擇

2，外賣衹能放在酒店外一個簡樸的小桌上，住過很多五星四星酒店，還沒見過這樣的，可以配兩個送餐機器人吧？
3，早餐的麪包，疑似不是當天，法棍和歐包前一天是脆的外皮，第二天是皮軟的（我前一天切的剩了3/4的鄉村麪包還在那），感受非常不好，這種不貴的麪包品質應該可以保證吧？
優點：1，客房服務大姐都很好，見面問好，房間也很乾凈，打掃到位
優點：2，早餐整體種類還可以，中西和當地特色兼顧，品質可以
 
是住過青島金水皇冠假日感覺不錯，選擇的廈門同品牌，整體感覺有點失望，下次可能會選擇其他品牌試試

出門在路上，隨意定下來的酒店
給我們帶來的驚喜
不想在擁擠的人羣中，艱苦的前行;
不想好不容易的一家子出行，因為喧鬧破壞休閑的
心情。
廈門的住宿，我們選擇在集美的皇冠假日酒店。
選擇行政雙床
一家四口也住着不擁擠，一家人難得有了閑聊的時間。叫醒我們的是每天清晨的日出，躺在床上看着一輪日出升起，頓時金光照耀大地。
每天下午的歡樂時光是在窗外的夕陽陪伴下度過
的，是悠閑的，是自洽的，是治癒的
特別感謝酒店給了我們一家很多的優待，贈送了兩
個小傢伙的早餐。
來了廈門很多次，這是一次非常不錯的住宿體驗。#下午茶#享受生活 #這店環境太好了#廈門旅遊攻略#廈門住宿酒店 #廈門旅遊攻略

msg:前幾日的青島之行，皇冠假日酒店給我留下了不錯的印象，這次廈門之行的第一站便也敲定了皇冠假日酒店。許是晚上到達的原因，廈門相較三亞給人的感覺少了分熱烈，更添了幾許温柔。前台小姐姐服務奈斯，給到的行政樓層觀景效果總體也很滿意，強烈表揚禮賓部miss 金，給我免費升級了房型，並貼心幫我找到丟失物品，全程給到我賓至如歸的感覺。酒店的早餐也非常非常的不戳，菜品新鮮豐盛，甜品更是用心，基本滿足了南北方的飲食差異，最愛特色沙茶麪。行政樓層的觀景效果也很棒，happy hour 和下午茶都很精緻，推薦mango case .另外建議喜歡270度觀景效果的小夥伴不要錯過精緻套房，比起豪華行政海景大床房多了電動馬桶，視野也更佳，半海景➕半城景，更好的欣賞廈門這座城市。最後重點誇獎攜程管家曉雲和布布的溝通能力，總能第一時間從客户的角度出發！

msg:1.硬件符合五星標準，衞生環境不錯。
2.整體服務很好，員工主動有禮貌，特別是何智剛大老遠幫忙提着30多公斤的行李箱到車上，非常感謝。
3.位置不在市中心，離集美學村不遠，自駕方便，路況不錯，不堵車，公共交通可能有點不便。
4.自助早餐餐品豐富，但出品味道中規中矩，西點對比之前去過的一些洲際，CP都有待提高。行政酒廊能滿足簡單就餐需求，管吃飽。
5.健身房比較小，人不少，略顯擁擠。
6.總體性價比不錯，度假休閑好去處。

PS：我是晚上十一點半才到達酒店checkin，負責辦理的小姐姐給我升級了海景房並且還贈送了我兩張飲品劵，並且在我辦理前就已經注意到我是從地下停車場上來的方向，主動的詢問了需不需要幫我辦理停車場出去！真的是相當的細心和貼心了！

接下來説説覺得還有待提升的
訂的海景雙床房，無敵海景，躺着就能看，小朋友都不想回家了😂如果床尺寸能到1.35米這樣，那就會好很多
餐飲：小童半價69元的早餐，性價比還行，中規中矩的餐食，熱菜不太多，粥品選擇性很多，麪包花色豐富；中餐廳是我們從入住的第一頓晚餐到離店的最後一頓午餐都在那裡解決，環境好，港式點心，很符合我們的口味，也懶得再出去折騰了，點評還有優惠券可用
酒店在島外，出行打車，雖然不挨着景點，但是很安靜，沿着海邊散步，看日出賞夕陽，非常愜意，下次來廈門，還會選擇這裏，就是節假日房價還是太高了

msg:我們是親子游入住酒店，雖然酒店位於島外，但非常安靜乾淨舒適！由於我們是自駕，去哪裡也挺方便的。從幾個方面評價一下酒店

設施：不論是軟件還是硬件都非常棒，而且設施都很新；大廳的小童樂園深得小朋友的喜愛，對於小童樂園個人想提一點建議，既然是酒店的小童樂園應該憑房卡進去玩，而不是周邊的居民、開店老闆的孩子等等都可以進來玩，雜七雜八的人都進來既沒辦法保證住店小朋友的安全問題，也沒辦法保證衞生問題，希望酒店可以考慮一下這一點；
衞生：我個人出門住酒店最在意的就是酒店的衞生情況，集美皇冠做到了，非常乾淨衞生，而且衞生死角也打掃的很乾凈，我們住了四天，每天都會有保潔阿姨來打掃，非常細緻周到；
環境：酒店馬路對面就是海，但沒有沙灘，是灘塗；大廳很寬敞明亮，簡約設計讓人很舒服；
服務：服務沒得説，從前台、保安、保潔、客房、餐廳各種服務都很好！在這裏我必須要提一下客房經理王詩蕊和保安經理鍾貴斌，入住的第二天我父親突發高血壓，緊急送120，他倆是當時的值班經理，跑前跑後的幫忙，對於我們從外地來旅遊，對這裏人生地不熟的情況下，他們這種行為真的讓人很感動很感謝！哪有什麼應該不應該，還是因為你內心善良，其實錦上添花有時候不一定能記住，但雪中送炭絕對能讓人記一輩子！還有前台的幾個美女和小夥都非常熱情，後面住的兩天在大廳碰面還問我父親好些沒有、身體情況… 真的很暖心！

msg:整體環境不錯，服務也很好。房間也給免費升級到行政海景房，房間蠻大。但是酒店位置還是略微偏了一點，但也算體驗了一把地鐵、公交、BRT、出租。
另外，就是房間廁所邊的地磚鬆動比較厲害，踩上去就會有水滲出來。作為一個新酒店，有點不應該，希望酒店能避免此類現象。
Minibar首輪免費，酒店還提供了很多水。

msg:先説缺點，設施一般，非常一般，沒錯，這個2021年剛開業的五星標準酒店設施衹能説一般，看起來就像亞朵，原因如下：

1、沒智能馬桶，電視也不能投屏，可以説房間裏看不到一點像是2021年新建的影子，10年前的酒店裝修也是這樣。

2、沒有浴缸，我看了一下高級房好像是沒有浴缸的，衹有豪華房才有浴缸，但是你作為一個“海景”五星酒店浴缸不是標配？高級房不高級，“豪華房”有個浴缸就豪華了？

3、洗浴用品都是大瓶的，一次性刮鬍刀要打電話要才有，IHG旗下好像現在都是這德行！所謂環保，就是為了降成本美財報呵呵！跟萬豪集團凱賓斯基沒法比！

再説優點：

回來的時候從中山路附近回來不到七十
餐的話 附近沒什麼好吃的店
酒店自己的餐 吃了牛肉麪和海南雞飯
海南雞飯好吃 麪一般
衞生和酒店的服務還是不錯的
由於個人原因提前一天退房
也都很順利 開發票 然後走了
送了份水果 一個梨一個橘子一個蘋果
MINIBAr裏的飲料有五瓶 免費喝
對面雖然是海 但是沒有沙灘 
衹能隔着路邊的柵欄看看
總體還可以

服務：相當不錯！從迎賓、大堂、前台、電梯口到客服，都是專業一流的。這個酒店每日贈送廣式小甜點做得非常好，我們都愛吃。廈門市一時買不到，臨走前忘了提前預訂點，有些遺憾。

缺點：房間可以看到日出，但是之後退潮，其實房間衹能看到灘塗。房間裏那個護理盒裡的扎頭髮的皮筋質量太差，掉絨很厲害。
優點：早餐沒有其他評價裏的那麼豐富，就屬於中規中矩，但服務人員態度很好，在春節飽和情況下，沒有出現空盤的情況，所有菜品都及時補充，這點非常好。

服務：酒店的服務總體還是不錯，都會主動的接待住客，但是也有過一段小插曲，健身房的接待還有待加強，泳池關門時間和前台得知的不一樣，在泳池快清場時沒有告知快清唱了，回房拿好游泳裝備再來泳池的時候，被告知清場不得入內了，王説為什麼不告知，服務人員來了一句“你也沒問我呀”。

設施：設施一般，定的親子房，沒有小童一次性拖鞋，被告知缺貨了。再要一床被子，被告知沒有了，第二天再問的時候説給別的客人協調走了。無語。
衞生：既然是海景房，這窗臟的讓我不知道看什麼好
環境：環境還可以。
再退房的那天和當天值班經理反映了，經理給到的態度非常好。

我的職業病顯現了
大學學了四年的的旅遊和酒店管理
到哪旅遊都愛看酒店的硬件和軟件設施是否夠標

強烈安利集美皇冠假日酒店
雖然在島外
但是坐地鐵進島也十分方便

路途也不遠 
坐小火車七站地左右
還能順便體驗海上風情
相當於咱大瀋陽兩個區的距離
主要是酒店非常新
游泳池，西餐廳
設施完善，服務態度超級n ice
而且酒店所有房型都是面朝大海

早餐也很豐盛
這兩天趕上陰天
不然面朝大海 春暖花開
心情也是美得很

酒店旁邊五百米就是海鮮大排檔
龍蝦🦞也不貴哦
不是那種給遊客吃的哦
是當地人認可的海鮮大排檔
安利

早餐不錯，不是那種看着很多，但是吃起來覺得都差不多的感覺，西餐也好，中餐也好，種類恰好，味道不錯，福建的特色美食都有，晚餐週六日是自助，品種很豐富，食物的顏值比早餐還高，值得試試
行政酒廊舒適，下午茶，簡餐精緻，直面海景，家人在房間休息的時候，為了不影響他們，我連續3天在這裏處理工作，很感謝行政酒廊服務員。
客房服務水平妥妥的5星級，會主動詢問是否打掃房間，洗衣服務。
一家值得推薦的酒店

設施全，有機器人可以送外賣，非常方便，房間床品枕頭都很舒適，訂的海景房，一大早就能看到海，心情美美噠，房間還有免費的飲料，非常不錯

中肯的評價：真的很適合度假以及商務的人羣，酒店很新，環境也很nice👍🏻
這次出行前提前定了房間，我定的是大床房，Sherry在後台看到了就主動聯繫了我根據我的喜好幫我升級了套房，房間又大又舒適，每天睡的都很好，大大的提高了工作效率
關鍵房間窗外的景色真的很贊，臨湖又臨海視覺感受一級棒👍🏻
第四天的時候細心的Sherry看到我的生日訊息，便讓酒店餐廳安排了一個蛋糕送來房間，真的暖心❤️
這家酒店有Sherry，我相信生意一定會越來越好的，我本人很少會在平台點評，這一次真的發自內心安利給大家，反正以後出差這家酒店永遠是第一選擇

msg:酒店真是大讚，也住過其他的皇冠假日酒店，但是都無法和這家比。無論是環境還是服務，特別是服務，堪稱完美。主動給我們升級了海景房，我們下車主動過來幫我們拿行李，而且一直送到房間。房間的枕頭類型有很多種，可以根據自己得需要，打電話到前台更換。特別贊一下Jack和Frank，服務很貼心，主動服務意識很強，還送了我們伴手禮。再來廈門，必選廈門集美海景皇冠假日酒店
