msg:I am satisfied with my stay at Ding ShangYi hotel.
The most important is that i felt very comfortable while being on an escape to relax myself in this hotel. 

The staffs provides easy & professional service, feeling being well looked after in this property.  Upon check-in, i could refresh myself with unlimited complimentary two types of iced tea and cookies, surely most hotels doesn't provide this.

I slept peacefully day as well as night as the environment is always very quiet inside and around the hotel. I love the bed coz it's specially comfortable.

I had my dinner at the hotel's Chinese restaurant, it was all a few seafood dishes, i must say that the Chef truly emphasizes on quality and visual/presentation. After dinner my 4 friends and i went for karaoke which is right next to the hotel, very convenient indeed.

I came across Mr. Avi, the lobby manager, we chatted for a while, he told me that he has been serving in this hotel for the past 8 years. Wow! I've been to quite a few hotel in China, surely never came across a foreigner working for so long in a hotel. This guy speaks 6 different languages, including Chinese mandarin.

I'll surely recommend this hotel to my friends who'll want to travel to Anji.

We were 3 families with children and on arrival the Lobby manager Mr Avinash greeted us and ensured we were well taken care in the two days we were there. The amenities like Pool, gym and TT Billiards room are all well maintained and staffed. There is also a Children play area with traditional Chinese board games and Caligraphy learning area. The Breakfast had a good spread of vegetarian options (both Continental and Chinese). There is also a beautiful public jogging track by the river next to the property.

We had booked a twin room and we were offered a garden facing room

Overall we had a pleasant stay and we wish the very best for this hotel and their staff..

Environment: Very good, the air in the small county is really fresh, and you can't hear any car noise outside in the room. The wall soundproofing is good, but the door soundproofing is average
Facilities: The room is not big, probably because the bathroom occupies a large area. The bathroom is quite large, but there is no bathtub. The plugs in several common locations in the room are very loose, and the charger falls off as soon as it is plugged in. The parking lot is large and there are charging piles. The swimming pool and gym are not big, and the gym equipment is OK. You can do some ironing in your spare time. But it's a bit stingy to charge for toothpaste and toothbrush. The hair dryer is not very good, the power is not high, and it takes a long time to dry the hair.
Service: The front desk service attitude is very good and enthusiastic. The hotel breakfast variety is also rich and the taste is OK. The front desk also gave us a can of white tea before leaving. The only shortcoming is that we didn't change bathrobes for the second night. I don't know if the aunt forgot or something.

msg:The hotel is located in the center of Anji County, with a good location. It is said that it was renovated in 2020. It can be seen that the toilet and bathroom are OK. There are sockets at the head of the bed in the room, but the tables and chairs are still relatively old. The bedding is OK, moderately soft and hard, and the sound insulation is not very good. Someone talking in the corridor can be heard clearly. The overall environment of the hotel is OK, and it feels that there are not many service staff. What I am most dissatisfied with this hotel is the supplies. Even if you advocate saving, this is too economical. You have to pick up toothbrushes, toothpaste and combs in the lobby, and then there is nothing else in the room except shampoo and bath. There are two bottles of water and one roll of toilet paper in the room for three people. I called several times when I arrived, and I was embarrassed. There is no hand soap, only two large and one small slippers, and they have to be delivered. There is no body lotion... The experience went down... I have stayed in so many hotels, and this is the first one with so few supplies. Although the aunt is very enthusiastic, what else do you want? Then the welcome fruit is just an orange and a few biscuits... I have also stayed in hotels in Huzhou, and it doesn't seem to be like this. I thought breakfast could add some points, and then it was just average. Anyway, I won't stay next time.

The next day, the manager Leilei sent me a message and contacted me at home to express her apology and give me a kid's meal. I thought the meal was average, but I didn't expect it to be comparable to a five-star breakfast. There were coffee, fruits, yogurt, vegetables, and freshly cooked noodles. It was much better than the breakfast at the Yinrun Castle Hotel where I stayed the night before. The restaurant is also very big. Later I found out that this hotel also provides buffet service, so I started collecting food at ten o'clock. It tasted good. The room is a bit old, but because of the service and breakfast experience, I will consider staying there next time. Leilei didn't ask me to give a good review.

If you need to pick them up at the front desk, you can pick them up at the front desk. The breakfast is satisfactory and the variety is relatively rich. The hotel has complete supporting facilities. I only experienced the gym and the indoor heated swimming pool. The whole hotel is decorated in Chinese style. When I entered the room, I felt that the furniture was very old, and the bedding was very good, which was much better than the supplies of ordinary business hotels. A closer look shows that this style of hotel is Chinese-style decoration, or the currently popular "national style" type. At this stage, middle-aged guests like me will definitely like it. I took a trip to the back garden of the hotel. The hotel has a children's playground and a hot spring in winter. The hot spring is suspended in spring. There was no physical examination, which is a bit of a pity. I will go there again if I have time next time.

Group... The bathroom is a bit small, and the room lights are still too dim to make people feel sleepy. The breakfast is rich and has many varieties, but nothing delicious. However, it is much better than other hotels of the same level in Zhejiang. It‚Äôs convenient to order takeout, which can be delivered directly to your room. There are many local internet celebrity restaurants in Zhou Guo (you also have to drive there)
It‚Äôs about 2km (basically), but on holidays you have to queue up for meals, and parking is difficult, so it‚Äôs recommended to go early. The Zhejiang Provincial Natural History Museum in Anji is very good and worth a visit if you have children.

The hotel is relatively old-fashioned, the environment is very good, especially the sleeping area is very beautiful. What I am more satisfied with is that there is a small children's paradise inside. In order to meet the needs of smaller children, the depth of the swimming pool is 1m5. This season is a little colder. Breakfast was okay, maybe because there were too many people and there wasn't much food when we went there. The overall feeling is that the price/performance ratio is relatively high.

msg:I stayed in this hotel in Anji during this trip. Although it is five stars, it is actually only three stars. The first reason is that the front desk üíÅüèª‚ôÄÔ∏è has no expression on the arrival of guests and is relatively indifferent. The second reason is that although the hotel is relatively environmentally friendly, except for toothbrushes and toothpaste, everything else is provided. Not even the hand soap in the room. When I came back the next day, the guest's coffee packet was not left either. I don't know whether it was to save costs or the waiter forgot to put it away. The third reason is that the waiter at the breakfast door has a very bad attitude and is not friendly to the guests. Maybe he is forgetful and has bad temperament. When guests are having breakfast inside, they still ask for their room number. Are they afraid that guests will come in and eat without paying? The breakfast was sp**** in variety and quantity, and there was basically nothing to eat at nine o'clock in the morning. I was really sorry for the breakfast fee paid by the guests. To sum up, this hotel is very economical. If you can save money, save it. I am really sorry for the general public's good impression of Anji. I really will not stay in this hotel next time. Praise the foreign manager at the door and the male waiter at the swimming pool.

msg:The environment is good. Huizhou style design, with pavilions and small ponds in the courtyard. Didn't go see the hot spring pool. I guess it's a little old, so it's a bit old. The dust in the corner of the bedside of the room was not wiped clean. The service attitude was very good. I was given a room on the first floor when I checked in on the first day. But it was too cold and a heater was delivered in the middle of the night. I was moved to a room on the 4th floor the next day. I also asked my aunt to turn on the air conditioner in advance. Friends who are afraid of the cold must tell the front desk not to go to the first floor. The water flow is strong and hot water is available immediately. It was great that 4 bottles of water were given in the room. I had breakfast all day, and the variety was very rich. Worth eating. It started at 7 o'clock.

The underground parking lot is very friendly! After all, it is too uncomfortable to park outside on such a hot day.
Cultural theme hotel, the interior decoration is antique, there is still mist in the atrium of the hotel during the time period, it has a sense of artistic conception, strong identity, personally like this kind of niche hotel!
The facilities are complete, the indoor swimming pool is not to be missed, the customer service manager Rir has been following up the whole process, the service is considerate, it is worth recommending

The breakfast at the hotel is very rich, and there is a buffet hot pot for dinner. You can try it after bathing in the hot springs. It is very good, rich in variety, and the price is not expensive. The hotel is located in Anji City, which is considered the city center. It is convenient for shopping, dining and surrounding tours. There is another detail that must be mentioned. Before leaving, the person in charge of the lobby asked the waiter to bring a small gift bag containing two bottles of mineral water and wished him a smooth journey! It's quite touching.

The assistant manager in the lobby is really responsible for the service and is very warm in all aspects. The assistant manager of this store is the one that impressed me the most after staying in so many hotels. From the very beginning of staying in the hotel, the subtle care is very good and the service is great;
There are two problems that I hope the hotel can improve: First, the service quality of the reception staff at the breakfast entrance needs to be improved. The damaged dining tableware in the hotel feels very uncomfortable. My mother is very taboo to see the damaged tableware when she goes to eat in the morning. I hope to pay attention to it; second, the elevator paint The smell is too strong, really pungent;

There was a small problem after check-in, but he helped us solve it in time. One thing I am not used to is that the shower room in the bathroom is separated by a curtain, and the lights are very smart, so I can't tell whether it is on or off. There are free candies, fruits, mineral water, and a rabbit doll for children when checking in and leaving. There is free tea in the lobby

He didn't get a good rest after taking care of the child all night. The room rate booked in advance was more expensive than the one booked later, and a child's meal was promised, but it was not provided at all. Although many of them are free to use, they also have prices marked on them, which makes people feel uncomfortable. I hope the details can be improved. The check-in experience was the worst among the four hotels I stayed at during the National Day holiday.

At this price, the dishes are still acceptable. The most eaten one is crayfish ü¶û, which has a variety of flavors. There are also sashimi steak grilled fish and the like, and the drink is freshly squeezed juice. There are also desserts that children like, ice cream. Because the children are still afraid of the heat when the air conditioner is turned on alone, it is very considerate to ask the hotel manager to send us a fan. The only dissatisfaction is that when I came back from swimming with my children, I got stuck in the elevator. It took 15-20 minutes. There were 3 adults and 3 children in the elevator. I was very nervous at the time, and the children were all upset. I hope that the hotel will maintain the elevator in time. It is very dangerous if a child takes the elevator up and down the stairs alone without adults around. Although resolved later. But I still have lingering fears.

2. The hotel has a regular underground garage, so you don't have to worry about your car being exposed to the sun.
3. Lei Lei, the lobby manager of the hotel, is dedicated to her work, professional in business, and very enthusiastic in service. If you have any difficulties, you can find her.
Fourth, there are some exclusive rules of the hotel to understand,
1. There will be broken bowls in the restaurant, so be careful when using them, especially those with children.
2. Ask the waiter for tea in the restaurant. I asked the waiter about the rules of your 5-star hotel. The waiter‚Äôs answer was even more unbelievable. She said that everyone who still drinks tea now drinks coffee. This is the source of tea and the hometown of white tea!
3. The hotel's disposable slippers are charged, 30 yuan a pair, don't lose them after wearing them, otherwise you will lose money.

1. I arrived at the hotel late in the evening, during the peak check-in period. There were three staff at the hotel front desk and only one window was open for check-in.
2. The sanitation of the hotel room balcony is very average, and the hanging chair is dirty.
3. ***Malicious Charge*** After leaving the store, I was told by phone that the pillow was stained with lavender objects. We communicated that we could wash it off or provide photos for compensation. The hotel refused any effective communication and did not provide any evidence, so it was directly deducted from the deposit. The amount is not high, but it is the most disgusting hotel I have ever seen in any five-star hotel. I strongly recommend not staying there.

It is best to dine in or near the hotel. It's best to have a place where the elderly can go downstairs and go shopping by themselves. Choose to choose, it's the most suitable home. Fortunately, my thoughts were not in vain, and everyone was extremely satisfied with this trip. The rooms are generally good, especially the buffet at the hotel is very good, which is a bit unexpected. Difficulties are resolved here smoothly. After playing for a day, when they return to the hotel, the children can go to the hotel parent-child park to continue to consume their energy. The adults drink tea at the tea bar to relieve fatigue. In short, it is highly recommended.

The buffet variety is quite rich, but basically it doesn‚Äôt change much after eating for a few days, so I‚Äôm tired of eating.
I brought swimsuits for the children and took them to swim a few times. The swimming pool is relatively small and many children learn to swim in it. It is a bit crowded.
You can put one roll of toilet paper in the room a day. Maybe the guest room didn‚Äôt add paper when we saw it in our room. There would be no paper the next day.
Overall it is recommended to stay

msg:This time I came to Anji with 2 friends to play a two-day and one-night tour of Happy Storm. First of all, the room we stayed in was very small and a bit musty. I saw two beds at the entrance, no sofa, small toilet, and no bathtub. The 1.2 bed is a movable box spring, it will shake and sound when you sit on it. The room configuration is sorry for the price of more than one thousand, and the price/performance ratio is really not high. The breakfast at the hotel is the only comforting thing to say, it's really good, with a wide variety of choices, delicious and fresh. The hotel staff service is also good, we checked in at 11 o'clock in the middle of the night, let us check out one hour late, and the cleaning aunt was also very good.

msg:The hotel environment is very good~ I was lucky enough to be upgraded to the room for free. Xiao Chu, the deputy manager of the lobby, gave a warm reception and helped me deliver my large luggage to the door of the room. During the stay, we also intimately recommended places to play nearby. Will live next time.

The room is very large, and fruits are delivered at night. The hotel has an indoor swimming pool and a parent-child club. The buffet breakfast is also very varied.
