msg:Great spot on the river. Room came with tickets to Smurf paradise and free upgrade to executive club access which were both enjoyed! The breakfast is the best we’ve had in China, more variety of fruit, fruit juice, pastries, bread etc and pastries were freshly cooked. Very vast selection, all good quality. Hotel has really nice rooms, new and clean decor, good facilities like indoor/outdoor pool. The service was also better than most other similar hotels I’ve stayed at. 2 things to note ; 1) our room was uncomfortably hot and we couldn’t sleep well, I’m not sure what the issue was but the service was very good. They came up with different solutions and brought us an AC unit in the end. They were very helpful, it’s just a shame it was still too hot. 2) the pool has a weird policy where no spectators are allowed, which I’ve never come across in a hotel before, and I didn’t really understand the rationale. In the 5 minutes I was in there I saw 3 other women sent away who were equally bemused. 1 was accompanying her daughter, who then couldn’t swim as mum wasn’t allowed to stay and watch, poor girl! I just wanted to watch and take videos of my 2 year old playing with her Dad. It was a little disappointing. Anyway, great hotel- we’ll go back.

The surrounding environment of the hotel is good. You can walk around Wulong Lake in about an hour. It is nice to take a walk in the breeze after dinner.

The breakfast is very good, with rich dishes and reasonable matching. The service staff is dedicated, especially the restaurant manager Eric. The kind of service style that is lively and moisturizing is worth praising👍

In comparison, the receptionist at the check-in front desk did not smile throughout the whole process. He checked in coldly. After checking in, there was no verbal or body language prompt. After waiting for a while, he said: It’s done! Even the basic elements such as where is the breakfast and when to when are not told.

There are several restaurants around the hotel, and there is a lot of choice

At least the attitude is much more enthusiastic than this hotel. The receptionist at the door is just a decoration. They don't even say hello. They don't help with the luggage. The front desk is even more outrageous. A female receptionist named Ti said that the room was not out when I checked in at 3 o'clock. When asked how long it would take, she said she didn't know. How to get to the elevator, which floor is the gym, where is the breakfast. All rely on asking, one by one, never say more. Several front desk staff have no smiles at all, no service, even worse than the cleaning aunt. When I wanted to borrow a charging cable, they said they didn't have it, and I ended up asking the aunt for it. The bathroom door is hard to open after it is closed. I saw other reviews saying the same thing, and I thought it should be improved, but it hasn't at all. From the door to the front desk, they don't seem to be afraid of bad reviews. There is no enthusiasm at all. The breakfast is quite rich, and the swimming pool and sauna facilities are good.

There were no chopsticks, only one coffee machine, and no one cared if there were no beans. It was OK that no one showed us to our seats. If the breakfast was caused by the large number of people, the dinner at Xiangyue Chinese Restaurant was even more outrageous. There were only a few tables in total, and no one poured water or took orders for ten minutes after sitting down. The waiter said that freshly squeezed juice had not been restocked for several months. It is hard to imagine that a Chinese restaurant in a five-star hotel with an average of 300 per person would have such a thing. The service staff had a good attitude, and apologized that there was really no one and the hotel was unwilling to recruit. Everyone must avoid this fake Hyatt Hotel.

The room service attitude is very good but the action is very slow. Because of work, I stayed up all night until 7 or 8 in the morning. I wanted to boil some mineral water before going to bed. I asked for two bottles of water and waited until I was ready to go to bed. They didn't bring them, so I pressed Do Not Disturb and went to sleep. Not long after I fell asleep, he called me and asked me if I had any water left on the floor by the door. Got it... Have you ever wondered why I pressed Do Not Disturb ()

msg:The house is not hot. The first requirement when checking into a room is to provide a room that supports heating. As a result, the air conditioner was turned on for a long time and the temperature was still 19.5 degrees, which increased by half a degree. You need to wear thick clothes and stay in the room. The front desk asked the engineer to come for repairs. The engineer proposed to adjust the air conditioner to 33 degrees. After half an hour of doing this, the room should reach 25 degrees. After calling for an hour, it was still 19.5 degrees. I was speechless😓. After complaining at the front desk, the staff immediately apologized and offered to change the room (this was a good attitude), but I asked for a warmer room and was changed to another room. Finally, the temperature was better than before, so I adjusted the temperature to 33 degrees, then to 20 degrees, then to 21 degrees, and stopped moving. Turn up the entire air conditioning system to save money? Most ordinary small hotels have better heating than them! What are the leaders of the hotel doing? After reporting to the person in charge at the front desk, the person in charge only said sorry and will report to the group leaders on Monday. I am really speechless😓. Such a good hotel can not provide normal temperature, but it can still provide What service do you provide to your guests!

msg:Very disappointed. The service awareness, emergency response plan, handling methods and hardware facilities are completely unworthy of the Hyatt name. Friends who want to stay here need to be cautious. They are not even comparable to ordinary five-star hotels. On the sixth day of the first ***** month, I brought my family to Songjiang. I booked the Hyatt Regency Songjiang. After dinner at Wanda in the evening, I returned to the hotel at about eight o'clock. Halfway through the child's bath, the hot water suddenly stopped and cold water came out. At the same time, I found that the room The air conditioner was not hot, and it was 17 degrees in the room. I was about to call the front desk, but I found that the phone was also broken and I couldn't make calls. So I found the hotel switchboard on Ctrip.com, and the mobile phone number responded and the answer was that it was being actively processed. After waiting for 20 minutes, there was still no feedback or improvement, so I wore a singlet and went to the hotel lobby to respond, and waited for about half an hour (I found that the hotel The lobby was also very cold (no air conditioning). The front desk said that there was a problem with the water pipes on our floor, and it would take half an hour to repair. They said they could change my room, and I was guaranteed that the room I changed would be fine. I agreed, and it was almost ten o'clock. I moved two rooms with children and elderly people, and the air conditioning problem improved, but I still found that there was no hot water. I thought he said it would be fixed in half an hour, so just wait. By the time it was past 11 o'clock, there was still no hot water and I couldn't take a shower. I called the front desk, and they said it was impossible. They had to come to the room to test the water temperature (you might not believe me). When I got to the room at 11.30, the water was running. After trying for a long time, it said it was 36 degrees. I said you can't take a shower even at 36 degrees. If you say forget it for today, can you guarantee that there will be hot water tomorrow morning? The front desk clerk and the worker didn't answer. I understand that there is no guarantee. The attitude of the staff was okay, they kept saying there was nothing they could do, it was an emergency, but there was no solution, and there was no guarantee when it would be resolved. Fortunately, hot water came the next morning. There was no special apology when I checked out. I said I would upgrade the room type if I come back again in the future. But after all this, would you stay at Hyatt Songjiang again?

I didn't do my homework well and thought it was a family hotel with a children's playground, but in fact there was only a small video game area in the lobby. The room was not cleaned when I checked in at 2 o'clock. When I checked in, I was not reminded of the time and place for breakfast, as well as other available facilities. I had to ask on my own. There are not many services corresponding to this price. The room facilities are relatively new and okay. Speaking of the free tickets, Guangfulin's is just a "passport", and the paid attractions in it still charge; there are no tickets for the car pier; the remaining two are said to have no restrictions on use.

The price/performance ratio is not bad for the festival. I need to complain about the parking lot. The signs inside are very cluttered. Although the hotel instructions are there, they are not obvious enough. The hotel breakfast is a bit busy. There are many guests who sit casually, and the seat utilization rate is also reduced. There are also quite a lot of noodle stalls to choose from, but the aunt is busy. When I get up, I can't take care of the service. . .

msg:The staff service is average; when driving to the underground garage, you need to go to the front desk to report your license plate before driving out, and then take the elevator to the underground garage. It is only valid for 15 minutes, and it is very rushed every time; the breakfast service is even outrageous, and there are too many customers for dining. , there is no good service mechanism. People must wait in line at the noodle stall, otherwise they will be taken away by subsequent customers. The aunt who cooked the noodles said confidently, "You have to line up here, and people leave." "I can't control my noodles if they are taken away." Personally, I feel that with so many customers, the hotel-related depar**ents should work out a dining mechanism. In addition, there is only a box of tissue paper near the sink, but not in the room. This is not true. It's very inconvenient; the front desk clerk (maybe the lobby manager) has a bad service attitude. When asked where the children's paradise is, he just pointed at us casually and didn't bother to talk to us. Maybe he looked down on us because of our big and small bags. .

This is my first time staying at this Hyatt hotel. The room is quite big and the bed is very comfortable. I added an extra bed for my baby. The service staff was very enthusiastic and brought me slippers and pillows when I asked for them. The location is good, the surrounding area is very lively, close to Wanda Plaza and several shopping plazas, there are many places to eat and entertain in the surrounding area, and parking is free.

msg:I heard my friend say strongly that Songjiang Hyatt is very effective and cost-effective. After experiencing it this time, it is indeed true. I have never stayed at a Hyatt before, but I feel like I will start saving for rooms in the future. The hotel is near the Wanda business district. I think there are several restaurants next to the Hyatt that are quite good. It should be considered high-end in Songjiang. It was already evening when I checked in, so Quinlan, the guy at the front desk, helped me late check out until two o'clock. I also met him when I checked out, because it would take nearly an hour to pick up our friends, so I asked him where he was. I could go and kill time, and he helped me get a courtesy at the VIP Club, which was very convenient for us. and! ! He saw that the room I booked did not include breakfast, and he asked me if I wanted breakfast. He could offer it. This is something I rarely get paid attention to in other hotels. Although I didn’t use breakfast because I couldn’t get up, But still thank you very much! ! This time I was upgraded to a King Room with Lake View in the Grand Club. The overall layout and decoration of the room has a new and modern feel without main lights. My boyfriend said that he likes this room very much (it’s good that he likes it 🙂 ).

In such a hotel, takeaways are not allowed and there is no robot to deliver food. Guests can only go downstairs or even pick up food outside the gate. It is very inconvenient and inhumane. I hope it can be improved.

msg:The 899 package booked on XC includes breakfast and afternoon tea and evening snacks at the Regency Club.
I took a fancy to his outdoor swimming pool. Like the indoor swimming pool, it is on the fifth floor with a water depth of 0.8 meters. It is not very big, especially suitable for children to play in the water in summer. I stayed for two nights and happened to encounter two rainy days before and after, and played in the water on the middle day, and the children liked it very much. I saw netizens complaining about renting swimming rings, 68 an hour, which is really expensive, and you can buy one.
The swimming pool suite on the sixth floor comes with a shared outdoor swimming pool, which is very convenient if two families travel.
The Guest House is also on the sixth floor. Afternoon tea is really nothing. Three kinds of biscuits, apple, pear and longan, and some beer, Coke and Sprite. The above is pretty much all there is to it. The children went to eat in the afternoon on the first day, but the air conditioner inside was not working and it was very hot. I didn't go in the afternoon of the second day, and went to have a snack at 5:30 in the evening. There are a few hot dishes, which are ok, vegetable salad, hot soup. You Haoyong rested a bit, and went back to the room at night to order takeaway. We arrived at 5:30, and there were not many people on weekdays, but at 5:50, someone said that there was nothing to eat, and I wonder if it will be replenished later.
On the first day, I forgot to press Do Not Disturb after three o'clock in the afternoon. A waiter rang the doorbell to deliver fruit, which woke up the children who were taking a nap. It is recommended to send fruit at another time, and I woke up several times after reading the comments.
The location of the hotel is very good, just across from Wanda, it is very convenient to eat, and it is very close to Guangfulin.

The weather on the day of check-in was not very good, and the service attitude of the staff was very good, especially William who helped us check in. His attitude was excellent. The buffet breakfast and buffet dinner are quite satisfactory, the variety is not too much, not very brilliant but still acceptable. I have a small suggestion. The cabinets in the swimming pool changing room are definitely a perfect design. Although there are warning signs posted on the corner of the cabinet door, the probability of subconsciously opening the door and being bumped into the head is still very high. I hope it can be improved to avoid more guests "Injuried"

Transportation: The hotel is not far from the subway station of Line 9. If you don’t have a car, you can take Line 9 to Songjiang University City, and get off the station with Songjiang Tram on Line 2. It takes three stops to go directly to the entrance of the hotel. Children especially want it Come and experience "Silkworm Baby". very convenient

Catering: The breakfast is very rich. I originally wanted to go out for food at night, but I didn’t expect that the Regency Club Executive Lounge will provide snacks at night. Simple hot food, cold dishes, soup, salad, and drinks are available. The children unexpectedly eat very well ♥( ｡￫v￩｡)♥. Friends who don't mind eating directly in the Regency Club will be very affordable.

Accommodation: The swimming pool suite is relatively large, and the two bathrooms are very convenient. The bathroom in the hall only has a sink and toilet. Pushing the door out of the balcony leads to a large yard, which is connected to the swimming pool. After changing into a swimsuit in the room, you can directly play in the water, which is very pleasant. The small refrigerator is also full of drinks, which are provided for free, which is enough for those of us who stayed for one night , The frosted glass sliding door does not block the light, it is a bit too bright.

Service: Nothing to say about the service. Because I brought children there for my birthday, the hotel also specially sent a small cake🍰, which was just enough for the three of us to enjoy. There was also a small decoration in the room. Although the heart is small, the surprise is great👍🏻. The room needed refills of water, napkins and towels, which were delivered promptly. It was also very refreshing to extend our check-out until 2 o'clock. We ordered room service and had lunch in the room with peace of mind before leaving. All in all, two days and one night, the children had a great time✌🏻

The front desk can actually give it along with a disposable toothbrush when checking in, or ask if you need it. Also, the baby was bleeding from the corner of the eye. When I checked in, I asked if there was any alcohol wipes for disinfection, and the front desk said no. This is a five-diamond hotel. It should be prepared normally, and you can not provide it proactively, but it is a bit unsatisfactory if you can’t provide it when the guest needs it. Some details are far from the hotel price. Finally, there is a little bit of fun after the children's playground. It is suitable for babies about one year old to play, but it is not suitable for older ones. There are no ocean balls. In addition to the above, everything else is ok.

Responsive to every request, there are a few letters after the beginning of the English name of another boy from Northeast China. It seems to be (vew) in order. The service is also very good. The breakfast is in the coffee shop on the first floor. The breakfast feature is that there are quite a lot of freshly squeezed Vegetable juices and juices, as well as milkshakes with dragon fruit and bananas are delicious, and the closing is quite diligent. The swimming pool on the 5th floor is very good, and the lights of Wulong Lake at night are very beautiful.

I asked the front desk for a solution and the only solution was to provide an electric fan. It's winter and I sleep with a fan. My baby has an exam the next day and it's midnight. I had to change hotels before I could sleep at 12:00. It was the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in, bar none.

There is a delicious farmhouse restaurant diagonally opposite, and it is not far from Guangfulin. Thank you Jerry for your careful arrangement. I arranged an upgraded lake view room in advance. The room facilities and view are very good. The slippers are also very considerately prepared in small and large sizes. I really like the function of sensor power and switch sensor display~ Legend The omelets in the breakfast were really delicious~ I was very happy for two days and one night.

Aida and Ken at the front desk were polite and friendly, carefully telling what time to have breakfast and what time to have afternoon tea.
Afternoon tea is at the lobby bar. It looks good, and I like the special watermelon flavor the most. Look at the scenery of Wulong Lake through the large floor-to-ceiling glass.
The room faces Wulong Lake, the decoration is quite satisfactory, quiet and comfortable.
The breakfast buffet has everything that should be available. It is said that it ends at 10 o'clock, and at 9:30 o'clock, various meals are added, which is worthy of praise. After the meal, I took a cup of coffee and sat outside, enjoying the breeze and fresh air.
Have the opportunity to come again in the future.

msg:May Day "Hyatt" trip, the first stop - Songjiang Hyatt.
This is an underrated festival hotel. During the stay, although it was the May Day holiday, there were no bustling guests at all. There was no queue for check-in/check-out, and no queue for breakfast. The Xc group purchase package is 970/night, lake view room + executive courtesy, and 2 Smurf adult tickets (170/sheet), and the discounted room is 630/night. For the calendar room whose price has been increased to 2200/night, it is so cool~~~ I feel that I have made a profit
🚗Room: The lake view room I booked is 42 square meters. The layout of the room feels very spacious, and it is visually much larger than the same area of the Wuxi Hyatt that I stayed in later. I chose a twin room with my baby. The bed is quite big and relatively comfortable. The scenery outside the window is pleasant and pleasing to the eye.
🚕Chinese restaurant: I chose Kaiyue Chinese Restaurant-Xingyue Chinese Restaurant for lunch. The roast duck had to be waited for an hour, so I didn't order it. Fragrant scallion chicken, fried dumplings, rice batter, etc., each one is delicious. The chicken is delicate and has a rich scallion flavor; the fried dumplings are each very large, with a serving of 6. The bottom is not crunchy, but still tasty.
🚙Executive Lounge: The hotel package includes executive benefits, so come back after playing the Smurfs and have a gluttonous meal. The quality of Hyatt is still guaranteed, the fish skin is super delicious, the chef is distracted; the curry beef stew is very soft and tasty. The siew mai, spring rolls, and char siew crisps are all delicious, the seafood chowder is rich in content, and the nectarines are fresh and juicy. Even our picky dad said that we don’t want to order supper when we are full.
🚓The Smurfs Paradise: 50+ yuan by taxi from the hotel, which is still a bit far away. I thought there would be a lot of people on May 1st, but the flow of people was okay. Babies over 120cm have a lot of things to play with, such as crossing the horizon, 6D movies, etc., which are quite fun.

        Overall, Hyatt Songjiang is worth staying in. There are large shopping malls nearby, and the service of the staff is good. For example, Ai Wei in the customer service center is very nice~~~ It's a pity this time, I only booked for one night, Chenshan Botanical Garden , Guangfulin have no chance, it seems that only next time

In addition, the hotel's parking is very convenient, there are many parking spaces, and it is free, which is very good! Overall very satisfied! One night, I got fireworks by accident🎆Happy!

The kindergarten organized a spring trip to Guangfulin, looked at the hotels in Songjiang, and found that the location of Hyatt is relatively convenient, and the price is relatively reasonable. After arriving at the store, Xinfan Sensi at the front desk provided warm and thoughtful service, which immediately improved his favor. Knowing that I have a baby, they took the initiative to upgrade me to a lake view room, gave me an extra bed, and prepared a children's bath set and slippers for me, very considerate!
When we got to the room, the auntie was cleaning the other rooms. When she learned that we needed an extra bed, she took the initiative to inform us of the time for the extra bed, so that we could be mentally prepared.
The service of the staff in the executive lounge is also very warm and thoughtful. The afternoon tea time is very long, but there are no afternoon snacks such as sandwiches and buns, but the freshly fried hot cornflakes are well received. The happy hour in the evening tastes good and has a variety of dishes. Very satisfied.
There are also healthy milkshakes and various snacks for breakfast, and the variety of fruits is also very rich, which is also very good. Recommend everyone to try.

2. There are several plugs in the room without electricity;
3. The first one of the electric iron is broken, and the panel has scorched marks. When I iron the clothes, the clothes are scorched directly. It is too speechless, which means that the equipment is not regularly inspected;
4. The water temperature in the swimming pool is relatively cold, and it has not reached the appropriate temperature. It must not have reached 27 degrees. After swimming, the child said it was too cold and felt uncomfortable;
5. The buffet dinner is pretty good. Sashimi is not a limited supply, and basically always available. The salmon is also cut into large pieces, and the pumpkin salad is delicious. There are also some special dishes in small portions. The waiter will divide the meal for each table;
The overall check-in experience is not particularly good, the supporting facilities are not worth the price of 1200 per night, the price/performance ratio is low, the service in the cafeteria is very good, but the service of the front desk staff is very average! Not worthy of the title of luxury hotel.

Because I took the elderly out to relax during the festival, I bought a hotel package that includes a buffet. The overall feeling is pretty good. The hotel looks a**ospheric and has complete facilities. The buffet meals and prices are more in line .

There was a small episode when I checked out. Because I accidentally broke the coffee cup in the room, Wu Jing at the front desk comforted me and said that it’s okay. We didn’t ask us to compensate for the New Year’s safety. Thank you for such considerate service during the Spring Festival.

We arrived at the hotel ahead of time, the lady at the front desk was very enthusiastic, and our requests were met, I like it. The lake view room has a wide view, the room is tidy, the design is reasonable, the TV is big enough, and there are movies, which are very refreshing to watch. Welcome fruit was also given in the afternoon. The bedding is comfortable and it is very quiet to sleep at night. The bathroom is clean, the shower water pressure is strong, very comfortable. Special thanks to Zhang Yun, the cleaning lady on the 15th floor. The old man had a waist injury, so we asked her to change the mattress. Drinking water can also meet our needs. For this reason, we wrote a letter of commendation. Ctrip's pre-sale coupons are cost-effective, and the staff at the Regency Club on the sixth floor are very good and responsive. Of course, there are not many varieties, and it would be even better if there are two or three more snacks. The happy hour in the evening is also good, and the food is very comfortable. I have to praise the breakfast the next day, which meets the standard of a star hotel, and the family members feel good. It is also very good to digest food in Jiulong Lake Park after eating. Every staff member we encountered was gracious and welcoming. Thank you so much for all your hard work and making our holiday a wonderful one. Hope to have the opportunity to stay at Hyatt Regency Songjiang again next time.

msg:When I live in a hotel, the most fancy thing is the quality of sleep, but this hotel gave me sleepless nights. I'm afraid of noise when sleeping, so I never open the windows and only turn on the air conditioner. This air conditioning system is completely useless, no matter how it is adjusted, it is always maintained at 23°C. The room was stuffy and damp, and I still couldn't sleep at three in the morning. I really couldn't call the front desk to ask the waiter to open the window for ventilation. The first one came and said that it might be locked and asked the engineering depar**ent to see it. After the engineering depar**ent came, they said that if there is no lock, they should push hard. The big bed I stayed in was made of two twin beds. I don't know if the mattress quality was not good or the splicing was too close, and the person next to him turned over and had a great impact. In general, the service of this hotel is good, basically what you need, the executive lounge is also good, and you know it's a birthday and even send a cake. But such poor hardware conditions completely eliminate the advantages of service, I am not worth it for the hotel.

Driving is only a short distance from Guangfulin relics and other attractions, and you can deeply feel the relics of the ancient city. The room facilities are modern, novel and luxurious.
The breakfast restaurant has an elegant environment and a rich variety of Chinese, Western and Japanese delicacies. In particular, the names of various restaurants are used to mark various dishes, which is full of beauty and humanity and ingenious.
The service staff at all levels are well-trained and courteous, demonstrating the management level of a world-class hotel.
At the front desk, Zhao Chunfeng standardized the reception and took the initiative to warm up. Zhang Tianyi was rigorous and kind; Li Xiyuan took good care of him, and Shen Huan was careful and tireless;
Shi Qi is professional, agile and efficient.
The foreman of Pantene in the breakfast room took the lead and took the initiative: Zhang Yun, the floor attendant, cleaned up to a standard standard, especially when it was close to 2 o'clock in the afternoon, he waited quietly and patiently at the door of the room, which was touching.

The standardization of Hyatt is very good, and it is very good to have two suites with their own swimming pools overlooking the lake.

msg:The service of the hotel made me unforgettable. First of all, Mr. Cai, who received us at the front desk for check-in, was the best I have encountered in all five-star hotels. Due to the traffic jam, we arrived at the hotel at 9:30. When I told me that I planned to go to Guangfulin, the scenic spot, he told me that the drive was only 15 minutes away, but the scorching sun would be uncomfortable for the elderly and children. You can store your luggage and take the children to the swimming pool first. And immediately wanted to lead the way for us, and then quickly sent the cleaned room key card to me.
Usually other five stars will smile and tell us that there is no room now, and we will let us handle it in time when we have a room.
The hotel's buffet breakfast will serve vegetable and fruit milkshakes and freshly squeezed juices in different time periods. The breakfast is complete in both Chinese and Western styles, with a wide variety of varieties. The Executive Lounge on the sixth floor provides snacks, coffee, tea and raw materials from 11:00 noon to 8:00 p.m. Fruits such as pears, apples and lychees are available in a comfortable environment, as well as outdoor dining tents. The cool breeze in the evening and the city view of the sunset river view are intoxicating.
The hotel is newly built for a year, plus management and cleaning, very clean. The indoor swimming pool is also very big. Although it is a pity that the outdoor swimming pool has not been opened due to the epidemic, it is very satisfied compared to other five-stars. I immediately pre-ordered one in the hotel, and I still have one in stock. Book two rooms and go to Songjiang Excelle for three days and two nights.
Songjiang Excelle, hope to see you again, Mr. Cai, hope to meet again.

The service, breakfast, and restaurant are all standard Hyatt products. The staff are very polite and professional, and there are not many people in the swimming pool, unlike the five-star urban area. All training classes are private lessons. It is very close to Wanda, Metro and Guangfulin. There are many restaurants within a minute's walk downstairs, which is convenient! Will go again, very good

The room is spacious and sanitary, and the lake view room has a good view (it would be more perfect if it can be equipped with electric curtains and a washlet toilet).
Indoor swimming pools and gyms are more popular in summer. When the weather is cooler, you can experience the outdoor infinity pool.
Although the hotel is relatively new, the service at the end of the stay has some defects caused by the epidemic, but fortunately, Manager Hu of the front office of the hotel seriously listened to the opinions of customers, sincerely apologized, and quickly responded to the reasonable demands of customers, which impressed me deeply.
The follow-up will still give priority to Hyatt.

Transportation: The self-driving tour arrives at the hotel in one hour from downtown Shanghai, and the hotel parking lot is free

Service: I arrived around 1:00 pm, and the lady at the front desk helped us check in immediately, and saw me with my children, and upgraded me to a lake view room for free! So sweet! I remember the last time I went to the Dishui Lake Crown Hotel, I arrived at 3:00 and waited until 4:30 to complete the check-in! There is no comparison, no harm, I must give a big compliment to Songjiang Hyatt! The breakfast on the first floor of the hotel is also very delicious. After I checked out the next day, I went out to play. They also put the food I brought into the refrigerator for me, and they carefully helped me write the room number card and phone number, which made me feel very attentive. !

Environment: The surrounding attractions include Guangfulin Ruins and Chenshan Botanical Garden, which are very suitable for visiting with children. The nearby farmhouses are also very fragrant!

msg:Is there a Hyatt Regency in every district of Shanghai? This is my first time staying at Hyatt Regency in Shanghai, mainly because it is more convenient for Shanghainese to play in Shanghai, alas—I originally wanted to go to Maya, but it was temporarily closed, and I don’t know when it will reopen. Alas - thankfully there's also a pool chat at Hyatt for comfort.
I bought a special offer on Ctrip, which is super cost-effective, only more than 500, although breakfast is not included, but there is a lot of food nearby, order a takeaway, go to the shelf at the door to pick up the meal, and finish it in the room, it is also very convenient, self-service Breakfast is actually just an a**osphere, not even if you don't.
It stands to reason that we checked in at 2 pm, but we arrived around 1 pm. There was no problem with check-in. The staff at the front desk were nice & patient & professional. Because we are staying with two families, and the other family didn't arrive, I felt that we were a bit annoying, but almost all of them met my requirements, I was really happy!
On the way to the room, you will pass by the cafeteria, which is in the lobby on the first floor. Therefore, the hotel is not big, but it is a new hotel with all kinds of comfort. The room too, has a bathtub, the glass is smart, one-click clear or frosted. It was just the next day that I took a bath and washed for a long time. When I found out, the bathroom was flooded with water.
The big bed room is a big bed of 1.8 meters, and the double bed is two beds of 1.2 meters. I chose the twin room, you can put the two beds together, it becomes a big bed of 2.4 meters, 2 Big 1 nap, so comfortable! Of course, there is a reclining chair, but certainly not as comfortable as a bed.
Our room faced Wulong Lake and had a good view. If the weather is not so hot, you can walk along the plank road by the lake. There are 2 outdoor swimming pools downstairs. It is said that there is a pool room. I don't know if it is. However, it is said that there are also outdoor swimming pools that guests can go to, but they are not open for the time being. We went to the indoor pool. When reporting the room number, take the locker in the locker room, which has towels and slippers. The swimming pool of the hotel is different from the social swimming pool, and there are few people! Dad took the children for a 2-hour swim in the afternoon on the day they checked in, and another 1-hour swim the next morning. In the summer, they were going to soak in the water!
Finally, let’s talk about parking. It can be parked on the ground, which is very convenient, but when I come back from dinner in the evening, there is no parking space on the ground, so I can only park on the ground. The underground parking lot is too big…
All in all, the stay is pleasant, the only complaint is that the wifi in the room is really bad, even if I turn on my own 5G, the signal is not good.

Needs to be improved As an upscale/luxury hotel is biased
There are Wanda and Wulong Square next to the hotel. It is also very convenient for the Impression City.

1. The hotel is new and has perfect facilities. The south-facing Wulong Lake is super suitable for the scene. The handsome guy at the front desk upgraded to a lake view room under my unintentional reminder. 2. The buffet breakfast and buffet dinner are given five-star praise, which is really great value. There are many guests but orderly. The restaurant staff is good at the end, and everything will be fine if you have a happy meal. 3. The swimming pool is not small, and the gym is also very good.
Fly in the oin**ent: 1. The hotel does not have a children's playground, not even a slide. Parent-child activities can only be brought to dinner or to the swimming pool. 2. The a**osphere of the new year is less.

I booked a big bed room. When I checked in, I said that Ctrip's name was wrong. I waited for a long time, and then said I was upgraded to a lake view room. As a result, when I checked in, I found that there was no room upgrade at all, that is, people put the two beds together while waiting. This is not a good experience. It is better to upgrade the room or negotiate to solve the problem of the big bed room. Of course, it is also possible that the big bed room is just two small beds, so it is a double bed when disassembled, which improves the efficiency of use, but it is uncomfortable to sleep.
The sanitary conditions are a little worse. There is a person's hair in the two towels, and there is also on the bed. It's blond hair. I hope it belongs to the staff, so I feel better.

msg:Taking advantage of the holiday, I brought my child to Songjiang to play and wanted her to swim, so I chose the newly opened Hyatt.
Service: The attitude of the front desk is very good, there are doormen at both doors, you can borrow umbrellas, and they are also upgraded to the lake view room.
Swimming pool: Very good, 25 meters in length, the water is very clean, the water temperature is neither too hot nor too cold, the security guards are always present, and they will also clean up the ground around the pool to prevent it from being too slippery. In addition to the reclining chairs by the pool, there are 3 large beds with curtains similar to those in Southeast Asia. The changing area is also very clean and comfortable, and the towels provided are thick.
Breakfast : I sent 2 copies, and I added 1 copy at the front desk for 110 yuan. It must be said that the value for money is excellent, there are: smoked salmon, lamb cutlet, parma ham, freshly baked waffles, small ravioli and noodles. It can be said that the breakfast is much better than other five-star hotels I have stayed in on business.
Disadvantages: The decoration in the room is too rough, even if the corners are not straight, even the faucet on the washstand is inclined, not 90 degrees from the basin.... The sound insulation of the room is not good. Can't you just spend a little more money on the build? The quality of this decoration, even if you ask Hyatt to manage it, is still a tough injury.
Overall, I am quite satisfied with the hotel, the service is good, the facilities are new, the swimming pool is great, there is a Wanda hotel next to it, and the parking is convenient. There is a lake behind, the weather is good, you can take a walk in the morning. The only shortcoming is that the room decoration really needs to be improved, which is quite low-grade.

msg:Seriously, it was my first time staying at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, and I was really looking forward to it. I have been living in Songjiang since the summer vacation, but every time I travel, it is not possible due to the epidemic, and I am more yearning for their buffet dinner. Finally said to leave and set off with good friends. The hotel is located next to Wanda Plaza, with a beautiful and comfortable environment, which is very suitable for relaxation. Walking around the hotel around the lake, the scenery along the lake is beautiful. It is suitable for three or five confidants to walk and chat at night or during the day. You can also sit and sit when you are tired. It feels good to be in a daze in front of the lake. The big bed we booked was upgraded to a twin bed in a lake view room. The guy at the front desk was really nice. He did things quickly and met our expectations. When we entered the room facing the lake, the sparkling mood was very comfortable. The dishes for dinner and breakfast are rich. My friends and I eat and chat. Because the dining environment is relatively large, it does not feel noisy, and the waiter is amiable. In short, I will choose Hyatt Regency next time, choose buffet or Chinese food...I don't want to go to crowded dining outside, I believe Hyatt Regency will be stronger and provide better service concept for guests...

The room size is not small, the overall cleaning is quite clean, and the welcome fruit is delivered. The decoration details are a bit rough, and the biggest problem is that there is no exhaust in the bathroom.
Went to the swimming pool and gym. The facilities are relatively new and the water quality is good.
The breakfast dining area is quite large, and the variety is also rich. The poor experience was that a male waiter who was not tall in a black uniform took away the tableware before we had finished the meal, and forcibly took away the mask on the table. After saying it twice, he came back. It seemed that he didn’t understand. talk.

The surrounding environment is pretty good, and there are trams on Guangfulin Road, which is pretty good. Standing on the main road, it's so empty! The hotel's Chinese restaurant tastes good, the roast duck is cooked to a good standard and the batch is good. 🍅Spare ribs soup, looking at the beauty, but the taste is not strong enough. However, if you bring your own tea, the tea fee is very expensive, the opening is 68 people, ha ha.

The lobby is already decorated for Chris**as and has a festive a**osphere. This time I got a fruit plate for my stay and upgraded to a lake view room.

Ctrip's hotel booking package includes two adult tickets to Shanghai Chedun Film and Television Base or Chenshan Botanical Garden. You can get the tickets first and go later. Tickets for Chenshan Botanical Garden are valid until September 30, 2022! Tickets for Chedun Film and Television Base are valid until December 30, 2021.
I have always liked the hotel's swimming pool. The fitness center on the 5th floor has a swimming pool gym and spa. Curry, the guy at the fitness center, has always been very nice. He is proactive, kind and professional. He takes the initiative to introduce the facilities of the fitness center. If there are any problems, he will help and deal with them in time. There are large floor-to-ceiling windows next to the swimming pool. When the weather is good, the sun shines in. The water temperature is about 29 degrees, which is not very cold. The water is also very clean and lifeguards are always there.
Had lunch at the lobby lounge. I have always liked tiramisu. The winter special drink has a cotton chubby in it. It is very cute and delicious. My daughter likes it very much.
The breakfast in the cafe should be better: first of all, the ingredients are still very fresh, the green leafy vegetables in the salad are very fresh, and the eggs and noodles are of high quality. What needs to be improved is how to collect meals at 10:30, but a lot of them are gone at 10 o'clock. For example, homemade yogurt is basically gone after 9 o'clock. Can you make more? And there were no waffles for breakfast, which made the children very disappointed...
Overall, I still like Hyatt Songjiang very much and will continue to come. I also hope that the hotel will get better and better in all aspects.

The room temperature cannot be adjusted, and the air conditioner is turned off and the window is opened to the maximum, but it is still extremely hot. When I checked out, I encountered a small episode where the pre-authorization could not be cancelled. Fortunately, a male customer service at the front desk had an idea and solved the problem in disguise.

We booked one month before the National Day, and it was almost 500 a room cheaper than during the National Day. The lake view room is really great. The room is very big and the facilities are basically new. The lake view with the curtains on the eyelids is really great! Everything else is fine, but a good hair dryer can't be used in a 5-star hotel. It doesn't matter if there is no brand, it is basically difficult to dry my hair. I blow it for 30 minutes and it is half dry. The window sill is not so good. Except for two disinfectant wipes, there is nothing in the sanitary napkins. In the middle of the night, I found that there was no comb for the front desk to send.
Let's talk about the service. I really want to give a big praise. As soon as I got out of the car, I saw the door, and a staff member ran over to pick up the luggage and went to the hotel to check in. The staff was quick and patient and smiled patiently throughout the process. In the future, whether it is the swimming pool gym, restaurant, lobby, room service staff, all the staff are very nice!

Although some software is a little lacking, but with the enthusiastic service of several staff members, it can basically be solved satisfactorily. Here I would like to thank Herbert, Simon, and Mr. Hua Yingjun, the manager of Jiabin Xuan, thank you for your reception these days, and hope to come back again if you have the opportunity.

There are relatively few entertainment facilities, the indoor swimming pool is still comfortable, and the outdoor is a bit too small. If you drive by car, it is convenient to go to nearby attractions. There is a Wanda Plaza opposite. The room service is also very responsive and the staff are polite. The children's toiletries are so cute.

They were charged for parking, saying that we did not register the license plate number. I, the organizer, felt so embarrassed that no one told me... So I asked the hotel, although I didn't make it clear at the beginning, the handling method is worthy of recognition. The toilet in the bathroom has a wash basin design, which is very good. Relatively speaking, today's Hilton is very lacking

msg:The temporarily booked room had several unexpected surprises.
1. Dining is the best supporting facilities among several five-star hotels recently. The breakfast is rich and varied. There are not only freshly squeezed fruit and vegetable juices, hot milk, but also a very ingenious old Shanghai omelette with fresh fried dough sticks inside. Watching the chef's fine processing, it is also worth waiting. The child loves it so much. The ingredients for the salad are also pretty good. The dinner buffet includes tomahawk steak, prairie lamb chops, and crayfish are small, but the ingredients are fresh. The fresh food is also good, red and white wine, beer, fruit juice drinks are complete. There are also sea cucumber soup, dried fried prawns, and there should be snacks and desserts, but they are too full to be taken orally.
2. Swimming pool The 1.4-meter-deep standard swimming pool is very suitable for parents and children and is equipped with buoyancy rods. The hot tub and sauna are so sweet. If you feel cold in the swimming pool, go up and soak and steam.
3. Room size and facilities are good, toiletries are also OK, service attitude is very good. There are also fruits delivered in time. Probably because of the full room, the guest room response speed is a bit slow.

msg:Perhaps because the hotel is eager to open a welcoming, the front entrance of the lobby has not been renovated, only to enter from the temporary entrance on the side, the first impression is a bit discounted.
The outdoor pool is not up to the standard because of water quality control, and is not open for the time being, a little regret.
The room is not very spacious, for two small families of 3, a little crowded.
The decoration details are slightly rough.
Compared with the above shortcomings, the service attitude of the hotel staff still makes me feel good.
Special thanks to the front desk little sister Xinfan, the reasonable request for the in-house guests, including extra beds, late check-out, etc. are actively responded, processing in time and thoughtful, when leaving the store, also gave a beautiful chocolate, very warm heart.
Consider later trying to experience the guest's room as there is a private patio pool.

msg:The check-in experience is bad, it is not recommended to choose, give 3 stars, I can't bear to give bad reviews. It can be said to be the worst five-star hotel experience. I don’t know if I have the courage to choose Hyatt in the future, haha. The reasons are as follows:
1. Because of the new decoration, first of all the hotel door is still closed, only the side door can enter, the doorman opens the door, the decoration smell blows, the elevator, aisle, and the room smell bad, I almost didn't fall asleep all night, nasal cavity The throat is very uncomfortable, especially the bedside is covered with wallpaper and wood veneer, and the peculiar smell is particularly serious when I lie down.
2. The decoration of the hotel is very rough and inferior, which does not meet the quality of a five-star hotel. In the newly renovated room, the corners, walls and cabinet edges, the wallpaper is warped, peeled off, and the corners and corners are all showing the defects of inferior decoration.
3. The sanitary condition is not satisfactory. The corners and corners of the room are falling, and the bedside, TV cabinet, and bathroom are all white cement left over from the decoration, and paint stains. It feels that no deep cleaning has been done after the decoration. Soot was found on the edge of the elevator, and no one cleaned it up from check-in to departure. Pilling fibers are clearly visible in the aisle carpet, and it feels like the carpet has not been vacuumed for a long time.
3. Because the hotel was under construction when I checked in, I couldn't even hear the front desk when I checked in, so the front desk upgraded the lake-view room for free and offered welcome fruits. After check-in, the fruit was not delivered until 9pm, and after calling the front desk to ask, 3 apples were delivered. Hey, I feel embarrassed for myself urging for fruit!
4. Due to my carelessness, I left a white T-shirt in the room, and called to inquire afterwards, saying that no guest left was found. Because it is not a jacket, it is the clothes that I changed the day before, so I clearly remember to fold it and put it on the bed. Well, there is no evidence to prove that I did forget, and there is nothing wrong with it. Just talk about it.
5. The only thing that can be said is that the hotel breakfast is acceptable.

msg:How can the Hyatt, which is next door to the house, not stay here? It is rare for Songjiang to have a decent international five-star settled down, and they generally have a good impression of Hyatt Group hotels.
Service: There are three counters at the front desk, the one in the middle is the one for check-in and check-out. The other two counters do not accept the check-in even though there are people. The level of professionalism and enthusiasm of the front desk staff is very average, and there is no introduction to the hotel. The service staff met in the hotel will not take the initiative to say hello, anyway, there is no smiley face.
Room facilities: Although it is a new hotel, it feels like the floor is not new. The bed is comfortable and the rooms are not intelligent enough. The current Express hotels are very intelligent, but the newly opened Hyatt is not intelligent and has no electric Curtains and lights are inconvenient to operate, and the table will shake. The layout of the bathroom is reasonable, the sound of the shower head is loud, which can be heard outside, and the hot water is very good. Soundproofing of the room seems to be ok, but no noise is heard anyway, or the occupancy rate is not high.
Fitness Center: The swimming pool is large and clean, and the changing rooms are well-equipped and reasonable and comfortable. There are very few people, so I have basically booked the venue by myself. You can consider applying for a fitness card here in the future.

msg:Real reviews, real feelings.
First boast 2 points. The first parking lot is relatively large and relatively convenient. The second breakfast is two-thirds of Chinese food. The fried wonton dumplings taste good, and the freshly squeezed vegetable juices are also rich, which is not bad.

The next thing is the dissatisfaction
The service attitudes of FD staff are not uniform. The boys who helped my friend check in are relatively indifferent, and they don’t answer when they ask him questions. Relatively girls will be much more cordial.

The air conditioner in the room I stayed in did not respond. I asked the engineering depar**ent to check the situation. When the engineering depar**ent came in, it said that it would cut off the power, and did not take off the shoes or wear shoe covers. When I stepped on the board in the cloakroom, I went to turn off the main gate. …I remember correctly that hyatt is a 5-star, and the master said that the air-conditioning does not respond often... Isn’t this hotel newly renovated? ?

Next, you can’t take a closer look at the room at all. The roughness of the silica gel makes you tongue-in-cheek. The sliding door of the bathroom takes a lot of effort to push it open. The quality of the hardware damping is also bad. The most awesome thing is, The shower in my room was leaking when I turned it on, and the sink in my friend's room was leaking... I was shocked! The decoration of the new five-star hotel is so bad? Will the conscience of supervision and acceptance hurt?

It reflects the unpleasantness of check-in when you check out. If you get an answer, you are embarrassed. We will pay attention to the maintenance. Shouldn't the lobby manager come to apologize?

Finally, the hotel has not been renovated yet. The entrance to the hotel is all scaffolding, and one part of the lobby is also being renovated, which is a bit noisy... Let’s go to Songjiang to change the hotel~

The above is an objective hardware problem. In terms of service, the takeaway is placed on the table under the scaffolding outside the hotel at the side entrance. Anyway, I won't help me get it up. After I went down and got it, I called me and told me that it was because of food safety considerations. What I bought ** is medicine! It's the medicine that is allergic to your bed with particles! I resisted the hives on my body and went to get the medicine, and gave me such an inexplicable explanation.
This is really the worst Hyatt. This Hyatt is really not worth the price of more than a thousand. The details are really not as good as all-season and Atour business hotels.

Because it is newly opened, the hardware is not said to be brand new. Like the Jiading Hyatt, the downstairs is a lake. It’s good to walk around the lake at night. You can also try the Songjiang tram after you leave the hotel. In addition, the hotel’s dinner buffet personally feels that the price/performance ratio is quite high. By the way, staying at the weekend coincided with the official opening ceremony of the hotel. In short, a very pleasant experience, I will come again next time I have a chance!

msg:It was the first time to try the Hyatt Regency Songjiang. Although it was just opened, there are still many areas that need to be run-in, but it is a very good experience.
As it is a new hotel, the decoration is very clean and has local characteristics.
I feel the best is the excellent service attitude, whether it is at the front desk or when dining, I feel the high level and kindness of the staff.
Among them, I am especially grateful to sister Pony for answering questions very kindly. The front desk is the first impression of a hotel and will give people a very good feeling.
Dinner is a buffet in the hotel. There are many types of dishes, including crayfish, tomahawk steak, lamb chops, various sashimi, on-site hand-kneaded sushi, etc., as well as a limited amount of maw soup, prawns, scallops, and shrimp dumplings. ,egg tart. The attitude of the employees also left a good impression on me. If there is a festival, corresponding activities will be held. Discounts are available for in-house guests, which is very cost-effective.
As the service is so good, in contrast, some areas of the hardware are expected to be improved:
1. There is no mouthwash in the hotel equipment, I hope it can be improved
2. There is currently no signal on some international channels in the hotel
3. The parking instructions are not too clear, and you accidentally miss the hotel parking space

The appearance of the hotel is very modern, and the lobby feels very spacious and bright.
The experience of cheak in was great. Mr. Jerry Wu checked in very quickly. He was very professional and polite. I took a heavy bag and he took it for me and delivered it to the room. This is not available in any hotel in China. Enjoyed the trea**ent, but also sent welcome fruit. Thank you Mr. Jerry Wu!
Although it is a newly opened hotel, there is no decoration in the room, which is very satisfactory. The room is very spacious, the facilities are very complete, the bed is very comfortable, the bathroom and toilet are separated from wet and dry, I really like this design, the bathroom has a large basin, and the bathroom mirror is large, making it easy to make up. The brands of bath products are also good, and face soap and toilet soap are prepared intimately. There are plenty of bathroom towels, as well as alcohol disinfection cotton pads.
Breakfast is what surprises me the most! ! ! I went to Hangzhou Park Hyatt last month, and Songjiang Hyatt’s breakfast was even better than Hangzhou Park Hyatt, with many varieties! ! And they are all very delicious, especially the small wontons, which are super fresh and delicious! !
Mr. Eason was also very attentive when cheak out, thank you!
The experience was excellent, and I will only stay at the Hyatt Regency Songjiang in Songjiang in the future.

At 11 o'clock in the evening, I went down alone to get something. It happened to be that elevator again on the 5th floor. The elevator stopped once and was half closed. I kept pressing the open button and it couldn't open. Then I frantically pressed the two bells on the top. The bell kept ringing but no call was connected. Then I got to the third floor and the same situation happened. The door couldn't be closed. Can you feel the psychological shadow of a person riding in the elevator? It's easy to get to the first floor and press so many emergency buttons. No one asked until check-out. Please be more aware of safety. Every time you check in at the front desk, you don't seem to be very smart. No matter how many people line up, you will never be rushed. One check-in takes at least 10 minutes.

After waiting for 40 minutes, the person at the counter looked like it was his first day at work. The lobby manager had no idea about the queuing of customers. After asking a few questions, he He was told to wait a little longer, speechless. After finally finishing it, the person at the hotel said before I left that to express his apology, he would send me two pieces of fruit for two rooms, which sounded pretty good. However, he didn't come even at 6pm. I called to ask where the fruit was. He also said that he wanted to verify the situation, and then it was delivered at nine o'clock. In fact, this fruit doesn’t have to be delivered, and that’s fine. Since we agreed, shouldn’t we deliver it as soon as possible? Still need to verify the situation? Next, let’s talk about the facilities. There are paint marks on the bathroom floor, but haven’t they been cleaned? The water in the shower is blocked. The weirdest thing is that when I entered the room, I found that the toilet was dirty, which meant that the toilet was not wiped at all when the room was cleaned. After being tortured for a long time, I no longer had the energy to complain, so I washed myself with disinfectant. Before leaving, I asked for three bottles of water, but after half an hour they didn't come, so I went to urge them again. On the contrary, except for the breakfast, which was okay, there was almost nothing else that would make people want to come here a second time. Is this a five-star standard?

msg:首先來了兩次，辦理入住速度不是很快
針對這個價格的話，
入住體驗，一.房間隔音不是很好，早上路過門口的説話聲很清晰傳進房間，
二.房間遮光，是真不好，三邊漏光
三.房間温度，空調開到19度，房間温度反而越來越高，被子根本蓋不住，衹能把空調關了
四.床上用品，被套不貼身。
五.衞生間廁所沒有放手機的小架子很不方便
六.早餐一份168真的貴。
對不起這個價格。希望有改善

4，早餐時，是6點半去的，服務員壓根不理人，叫他們煮個麪條，他們壓根不理你，自顧自的去幹

離店的時候前台主動詢問了是否開車，免除了停車費用。之後也會一直選擇凱悦酒店。

差評給到五樓泳池工作人員、安保、和經理。當晚帶孩子去游泳，正按照訓練計劃遊的好好的，一個媽媽帶着11歲女兒罵罵咧咧進入泳池，女兒不想遊，她非要讓遊，後面還在泳池裡一邊喊叫一邊用腳多次蹬女兒胸口，還用手扇嘴巴子打腦袋，看得觸目驚心。這期間沒有任何工作人員上來勸阻管制。我説了一下不要這樣對孩子好好跟她説話，她又開始對我破口大罵，然後繼續家暴女兒。後面我喊了工作人員來，又讓他們找經理來，幾個大男人基本沒啥作為，都是在打圓場，沒有及時勸離現場，任由她在泳池大鬧十幾二十分鐘。還過來跟我説她在教育自己的孩子，我們也沒辦法，聽得我三觀震碎…我看工作人員管制無效，報了警，後面警察來才收住現場。

小女孩一直在哭非常可憐，不管因為任何原因，這樣把一個五星級酒店鬧成菜市場，在公共場所公然家暴，竟然無人有能力處理，非常的可笑。周圍游泳的客人陸續都離開了，我的孩子也嚇壞了，第二天早上去吃早飯還心有餘悸。想到酒店有這樣的vip客人經常去游泳，下次應該不會選擇了…

預訂的湖景房，13樓的視野很好，也很正。地理位置在萬達旁邊，基本的餐飲娛樂也方便。
設施：該注意細節都沒注意，比如穿鞋凳、擦鞋布、一次性卸粧巾，被子有點悶，早上被熱醒了。
環境：隔音太差太差，早上8點多就被走廊裏麪小孩的奔跑吵鬧聲吵醒。接下來，樓上就傳來斷斷續續的敲打聲。這個隔音甚至比不上全季，價不符位。
一晚上沒睡好，第二天起來整個人都很疲倦。
總之體驗感和性價比都特別差。

那天下午，我和我男朋友身上濕了想沖澡休息，沒有帶身份證被前台告知無法入住。我們溝通用付款寶電子身份證，前台告知我們，外地人沒法用！前台服務員的態度我給大寫差評，這種員工可以開除了。由於工作忙，我給忘了寫點評，後續我會持續給差評的，直至這事有結果。
房間裏面衞生間推拉門也是壞的！
服了。
停車場走進去全是麻辣小龍蝦味道。哪家星級酒店都有自助，哪家味道這麼大！？

msg:説一下這次酒店入住體驗吧：1.入住辦理還是很順利，前台妹子蠻好的，不過進了房間就很驚訝地發現房間地上還有糖紙等垃圾 2.第二天一早出門工作，客房電梯一出來，一幫小姑娘拿着各種相機手機懟着電梯門，估計是在等哪位明星藝人，但着實嚇我一跳 3.上午十一點多回房間，發現阿姨在莫名打掃，和我説因為你已經退房了，結賬的時候和酒店反映了一下，希望能改進，不過小哥很冷漠，我也很無語。總體感覺就是，和疫情之前去其他凱悦酒店的入住體驗，差距好大,希望這些都是偶發事件，並不代表整體服務水平的下滑

msg:我訂的是帶自助晚餐+自助早餐的套餐，我一個7個月孕婦帶着一個4歲孩子，因為老公出差工作帶着我和寶寶，所以就選了松江凱悦泡一下酒店，也方便老公上班。我來説下整體情況。
入住，服務員主動給升級了房型，好評；
晚上用餐的時候，我一個人帶着孩子，因為晚餐人不算很多很多，也有服務員可以搭把手幫忙帶帶位啥的，餐點不報期待的情況居然還不錯，寶寶和我也吃飽了。期間我讓一位女服務員幫忙拿碗麪條，她忘記拿了等了二三十分鐘後可能想起來了，過來一直打招呼，其實倒沒什麼問題當時我們也吃飽了，但是她還是給我們打招呼送我女兒小禮物，不錯~但是有些服務員就不是這樣，我問一個男服務員調羹在哪裡，他直接回答我“沒有。”無解，餐廳沒有調羹。他的意思應該是他那裡沒有，讓我問問別人的意思吧，但是話語精簡，不和你多囉嗦半句，看上去至少是95後，算了不和孩子計較，況且我一個人行動不便。
房間的裝修，大家不要不信這個邪，房間看起來佈局還不錯，但是很多人評論説裝修粗糙，去之前不信，去了就知道了，到處都是那種石灰、油漆沒有清理乾淨的痕跡，硅膠打的一塌糊塗，佈局是經過設計的，但是裝修隊絕對是關係户。
第二天的早餐，這個我要大大大大大大大大大吐槽！！之前我曾經住過無錫的凱悦，至今念念不忘早餐的豐富和服務的主動，讓我心裏一直對凱悦品牌非常好感。無錫凱悦雖然早餐人很多，但是排隊有序，進門有人領位，坐下來服務員就主動問紅茶咖啡要什麼，然後直接就端上來，這樣座位就相當於幫客户reserve好了，客人放心的去其他地方排隊拿東西好了。
松江這家不得了，10點半要收攤，我帶了孩子9點半去的，沒人排隊但是沒人領位，等有個穿西裝的領班還是誰的來了，房號也不用報，直接進去就行了？難怪亂哄哄。
西裝小哥把我帶到一個位子，上一桌桌子還沒收，等桌子收好了，盤子也沒有。我帶着女兒去拿東西吃，等兜了一圈回來，就看到另外一個客户和這個西裝小哥哇啦哇啦，説他好不容易排隊拿好的東西放在桌子上被收走了（what！）這個位子不是給我了嗎，給我的時候上一個客人吃完的東西還沒收，這會兒變成他的了！因為我帶了孩子拿東西排隊都不方便，慢了點，結果連位子也沒有了。一塌糊塗，他們哇啦哇啦，我沒辦法，我又等了另外一桌簡單清理了一下，給女兒先吃早飯去了。最最最最關鍵的是！！！快10點了，基本上要什麼沒什麼，所有攤位前有東西的都在排隊，要麼就是沒東西了！鹹豆漿攤位，配料一大把，豆漿沒有了。自助穀物酸奶攤位穀物一大把，酸奶沒有了，水果沒有果汁沒有。。。反正能沒有的都沒有了，我一個孕婦去號稱五星級酒店吃早飯，吃的是盒裝酸奶和一些麪包，我不會85°解決嗎？最最離譜的是，有茶葉蛋，我女兒愛吃茶葉蛋，我第一次拿了兩個茶葉蛋，一個壞的，粘殼的；第二次再拿兩個，兩個都粘殼。説明什麼？説明這個蛋不新鮮啊！氣氣氣氣！一樣的凱悦品牌，不一樣的早飯品質。
最後，延時退房還是可以的，讓我和寶寶眯了會兒午覺。
老公下週又要出差了，問我要不要換家凱悦試試看？謝謝了，我有點怕，我不去了。

設施：衞生間的玻璃一秒霧化很高級！整體裝修很新，沒有雷點，打掃的很乾凈，性價比超高！下回可繼續體驗！

前台辦理入住和退房極慢，所有排隊的人都在怨聲載道。
想去大堂咖啡廳喝個下午茶，無人招待無人介紹，還要客人自己拿着菜單追着去問，菜單上的蛋糕説做不了，讓自己去甜品櫃看，看了蛋糕説還不能按片賣，衹能整個蛋糕賣？？？擠牙膏呢問一句答一句，被氣到了説不點了，啥都不問直接人又消失了。
這樣的服務質量真的配不上五星級連鎖酒店的品牌，強烈建議貴司加強員工培訓，過年是來放鬆的不是來受氣的！

酒店坐落松江五龍湖旁，松江2號輕軌輕鬆達到，萬達廣場就在馬路對面
登記入住時收穫了第一重驚喜，前台Aida體貼地送了我們兩天早餐
當天晚餐是預訂的除夕自助餐，大年夜晚上餐廳**的佛跳牆，大龍蝦，鵝肝燴飯讓家裡老兩口十分滿意，自助餐的選擇也十分豐富，還帶有小火鍋，比往年家常菜多了不一樣的體驗，我們視為第二重驚喜！
第三重驚喜便來自於酒店服務人員，前台人員的體貼，餐廳服務員的周到，客房保潔人員的專業，健身房小哥的“新年好”，以及門僮的熱情讓住店體驗多了煙火氣和温暖
最後一重驚喜來自窗前除夕夜晚的煙花！

msg:環境的分數給這麼低是入住樓層有香蕉水味道
1、下午入住時並沒有，房門口還有保潔，晚餐後發現立刻致電前台提出有異味，讓人來看下，存在安全隱患電話裏説給我台空清，也沒在意就同意了。估計工作人員查看過味道確實濃，直接敲門給我換房間了
2、酒店保潔人員，看見顧客全程面部無表情無問候，直視你，感覺來到了假凱悦
3、抵達新房間需要補充拖鞋，房間電話、自行撥打都無人接聽，衹能委託ctrip客服，折騰了很久是由禮賓送來的。太搞笑了，是都去處理樓層異味了嘛
3、自助早餐，小童收費沒有身高測量牌及收費標準，全靠服務員目測口述，也不多糾結什麼
4、從地下車庫上樓，全程沒人讓你掃碼，前台也沒讓你出示健康碼等等，這波操作太厲害了
總體給住客的感覺，對不起凱悦這塊牌子，更對不起這個價格

酒店有2個餐廳，1樓自助餐廳中午和晚上的菜品是一樣的，住店客人還能有優惠價，菜品豐富，還有一直來派送的小菜和特色飲料，我們拿到了一個新鮮椰子，一杯特色飲料和一個鮑汁鮑魚，還蠻驚喜的。3樓還有家中餐館，味道也不錯，人相對少很多。

推薦一下酒店的泳池和健身房，水非常乾淨，更衣室很大，很乾凈，還有泡池，吹風機和梳粧台區域非常大。下午泳池人比較多，想游泳的建議上午去，可以包場遊哈哈。健身房人很少，器材很新。
想提一點建議，游泳池女賓更衣室裏有一間淋浴室的門壞了，進門靠左手那間，關上從裏面非常難拉開，建議酒店在門上掛個牌子或者早點維修，被關在裏面的體驗感真的不是很好。而且更衣室裏沒有一直駐守的工作人員，待了好久才叫到一個好心人。

行政酒廊：這個不是很推薦，早餐和其他房間一樣是在一樓吃的，下午點心不是很多，就一些小餅乾和飲料，晚上簡餐菜不是很多，而且人蠻多的，拿菜需要排隊，菜基本一出就拿完了，味道是不錯的，比較適合簡單墊一口然後出去覓食。

早餐的西餐檔非常差，很垃圾的幾塊小麪包，其它什麼也沒有。請服務員加一副餐具，對方説，去熟食檔自己拿。
此外地下停車場特別特別特別繞+標識不清。
賣的是其他旅遊城市核心景區的凱悦價格，沒啥性價比可言。

🔔服務：員工都很有熱情、🈶禮貌，特別表揚下前台的Mike。
🧹衞生：衞生方面有待提高，衞浴潔具清洗不夠，有殘留污漬，客房的歡迎水果更換不及時，一盆砂糖橘有5、6個已經腐爛變質😥

🧹衞生：衞生也一般，主要裝修太差了，看起來就不乾淨

🔔服務：可以説是非常差了。買塊蛋糕就我們一個客人，4個服務員手忙腳亂的還要10分鐘才打包買單玩。游泳池有熊孩子和熊爸媽打水槍，水槍茲到其他客人，還俏到我家孩子，也沒人阻止任由他們大聲喧嘩打鬧。


總結一下真的不會再去了…

地下車庫有點指示不清，B2 D區有直達電梯到酒店大堂，住店客人每次出車前跟禮賓説一下車號，半小時內出庫免費。
服務人員普遍態度都挺好的。
房間內設施符合五星設定，乾濕三分離。就是隔音有點差，春節期間有的家庭舉家大小出遊，長者和小孩有點鬧騰，半夜11點還能聽到對門的小男孩在蹦，把櫥門開了關，關了開。。。
酒店早餐不錯的。
總之性價比OK。
