It was not far from the SAIC so we could do the circuit tour and also close to the Auto Museum. Anting line 11 metro station is a stone throw away. However, there was a irritating fan noise which I hope they can stop. Also, a small piece of the ceiling was missing next to the bathtub. FYI, we enjoyed the tub.

Facilities: No USB socket. Others are pretty good, there is a capsule coffee machine, you can help yourself to a cup of fresh coffee.

Hygiene: tidy

Environment: An a**ospheric European-style building with tall palm trees in the courtyard and lush greenery in the courtyard.
In the early spring, the plum blossoms here have faded, red-leafed plums and purple magnolias are in full bloom, the weeping crabapples are in bud, and there are also lupine flowers and pansies in brilliant purples and reds... There should be more and more beautiful flowers blooming in May and June. For such a large garden, greening maintenance is no small project.

Service: From the front desk receptionist to middle and senior managers, the service is proactive and enthusiastic. This time, my sister and brother-in-law booked two package boutique rooms together for their 40th wedding anniversary. After learning about the situation, the hotel carefully decorated their rooms and communicated many times during the period to ensure satisfaction. The next morning we met the hotel manager Wang by chance. She greeted us elegantly and warmly, as if her sister and brother-in-law were here to celebrate their ruby ​​wedding, and she specially presented a brooch as a congratulation.

There are also several high-standard small villas under renovation in the hotel. The staff member Xiao Qiao enthusiastically took us for a walk around the hotel garden and also visited one of the completed small villas. It has all the leisure and entertainment facilities inside and it is beautiful. . Looking forward to the day it opens.

Happy vacation, thank you for meeting me, thank you all!

The hotel is cheap, so there aren't many people around, so it's a bit deserted, but it's nice to be quiet. The room is very spacious, comfortable and clean, and the bathtub is also large. Although there are more or less minor problems, the TV sets have bad reviews, especially the 5 sets of which cannot watch the World Cup at all, all are snowflakes. Overall is good. Surrounded by a villa area, the environment is quite good and it feels like a vacation. The breakfast is rich and well received.

I felt very good immediately. I was shocked when I entered the room. Nothing, there is still a piece of broken tempered glass next to it, which is very scary. It is really admirable that you can let us stay in such an environment, not to mention the air conditioner. It feels like sleeping next to the airport, and the air conditioner is loud Scary, but fortunately my sleep quality is very good, because the check-in time is too late, just think about it, I don't want to negotiate with the hotel, anyway, it's really bad

2.毛巾上有一根長頭髮
3.辦理入住後沒有酒店人員引導找電梯
ps：本來想吐槽的，但住了上海其他7-8家5星級酒店發現，這個酒店除了裝修風格不喜歡，其他都覺得挺好。真是不比不知道啊
