msg:Lin Shifu's Mansion is such a peaceful and elegant place to stay! The butler even came to collect me from the pier and helped me find the way to the hotel. He also gave me his WeChat and let me ask questions whenever I wanted help: ordering dinner, questions about returning ferries etc. The room was elegently designed in a mixture of traditional Chinese and traditional European style. The windows opened onto the couryard, so I sipped on coffee quietly and enjoyed the view. At night the only sound was wind and the trees swaying. So soothing! Both dinner in the hotel's restaurant and the set breakfast were amazing. The dining room itself feels like you have stepped back into a more elegant and refined time. And the presentation (and taste) and the food is great. Definitely photogenic, too, for those who want to get pictures of a more special experience. Thank you for all your help throughout my stay. I really felt welcomed and safe (as a solo traveller). Very comfortable. I slept very well indeed.

It is very appreciated that the owners of the hotel tried to restore as much of the building as possible and recreate the atmosphere of those times. We loved the idea of serving breakfast in Lyn family style. If we come back to Gulangyu will definitely stay here again. Thank you!

The breakfast is OK, and the set meal is delicious.
The bed is big enough, but the mattress is a little hard and the quilt is a little thin, but everything else is good.
The afternoon tea is very good.
The most considerate service is the luggage pick-up. It is very difficult to pull the suitcase on the stone road on the island, and the hotel pick-up is very convenient.
The location of the hotel is also good, not facing the commercial street, not noisy, very quiet, the garden scenery is beautiful, suitable for sitting and resting

It has a very rich historical and cultural heritage and a**osphere. Even the breakfast is a portion of sea cucumber porridge with side dishes, which is very touching.
It is recommended to get off at Sanqiutian Wharf when checking in. A guy will take your luggage back to the hotel. When you leave, you can also leave your luggage at the hotel and go out to play around. When you leave, someone will help you to the wharf. When you check in, you will also be given a cheongsam experience and a puppet show. You can experience them all. It's pretty good.

msg:Bringing 70+80+ elderly people to Xiamen for vacation, we chose to stay in Gulangyu for 2 nights to slow down the pace, avoid the crowds, and enjoy the a**osphere of time.
We chose the hotel that is said to be the most expensive on the island. Because it is under renovation, we upgraded the room. Whether it is Jingli Building or Benyuan Building, we must live on the 2nd floor. The first floor is a bit dark and claustrophobic, and the lighting is not good.
The elderly are still happy to live here. The road on Gulangyu is not easy to walk. The elderly spend most of their time drinking tea and resting in the garden. The environment is very quiet. The breakfast in the restaurant is a nine-square grid, which is very stylish. The cheongsam change is given, the cheongsam is of good quality, and the elderly are very happy to take pictures. It’s just that the largest size is only xxl, and we have an aunt who weighs 140 pounds and can’t wear it. The scenic spot ticket of Haitiantang is given, which is very close to the hotel and walks for 3 minutes.

Gulangyu still depends on the specific floor and orientation of the room when choosing a hotel. We still like the feeling of openness.

We stayed in Dingjing Building, which was full of the style of the Republic of China. There was a garden when we opened the window. Although breakfast was not a buffet, it was very attentive. The service staff in the restaurant was very dedicated and the service was very thoughtful. The Lin family has a deep connection with Gulangyu. The classic buildings on the island always have the presence of the Lin family. I don't know when I will come to Gulangyu next time, but I think I will never forget this trip, the people and things on the island. I hope that you who see this review will not hesitate and will not regret staying here in Gulangyu.

When I came to Gulangyu Island, I wanted to experience a different hotel, so I chose Lin's Mansion. It was perfect! The butler has a pick-up service at the port, otherwise it would be too tiring to drag the luggage.
The hotel was renovated from Lin's old house. It is in the style of the Republic of China, low-key and luxurious. The balcony faces the garden, which reminds me of many romantic dramas of the Republic of China. And only hotel guests can enter here. It is relatively quiet and not as noisy as other places in Gulangyu Island.
The service is also very good. I felt there were many mosquitoes at night, so the front desk immediately brought toilet water and an electric mosquito swatter.
By the way, there is also a free cheongsam photo-taking service here. The cheongsam is a free set. It is very clean and will be sent to dry cleaning after every customer uses it. The style is also beautiful.
It's a pity that I only stayed for one day. I will stay here next time I come to Gulangyu Island.

msg:The hotel with the No. 1 design sense in Gulangyu Island and two friends booked a duplex parent-child suite in the Benyuan Building the day before check-in. The hotel proactively asked about the ferry arrival time. The staff met at the pier on time and helped transport luggage. This service made us walk on the "mandatory" island. Overwhelmed with envy, the hotel has a sense of age as it enters the hotel, and there are stories everywhere. 15:00-16:00 Afternoon tea is enjoyed in the courtyard. Tea-flavored refreshments are not bad. 17:00-17:30 The children are in high spirits. I participated in the puppet DIY activity and did not leave the hotel for dinner. I chose Lin's Banquet Dining. The waiter thoughtfully changed the set menu for my vegetarian friends. I chose a lot of choices for the nine-square breakfast. The second night I changed to Dingjing Building. Thank you to all the staff for their meticulous five-star service. You feel like you are at home. The next time I went to Gulangyu Island, I decided to renew my relationship with Lin's Mansion.

msg:As if traveling through a hundred years, we arrived at Gulangyu Linshifu Mansion Hotel. We had great expectations for the hotel before, but after checking in, we found more surprises, which exceeded our expectations! When we were still at the Xiamen Cruise Center Pier, the hotel housekeeper contacted us by phone and picked us up early at Sanqiutian Pier on Gulangyu Island and delivered our luggage. The hotel environment is very good. From the lobby to the guest rooms, the indoor landscape and outdoor gardens, everything is carefully crafted, and the scenery is different every step of the way. It is so beautiful! We made an appoin**ent to take a cheongsam photoshoot. It was a retro-style photography, and you can take pictures everywhere. It was very photogenic! The hotel staff are very nice. In order to let us take better photos, they even helped light up some lamps that are not commonly used. Hahaha, I was so pampered! The hotel's restaurant is also delicious, and the dishes and tableware are pleasing to the eye. It was already dark when we left Gulangyu Island. The hotel customer service also helped us with our luggage and sent it directly to the pier. We didn't have to go back and forth. We and our luggage met at the pier, which was very convenient! It was a very pleasant trip. I will choose Lin's Mansion again if I have the chance next time!

Because we have an elderly person with limited mobility, the waiters pushed wheelchairs to the pier to pick us up, especially the room manager surnamed Lin. When we left, there was almost the first boat, so he got up early to see us off. Knowing that my elderly family member has limited mobility, I helped him change his room to a more suitable room on the first floor. In addition to the Jiugongge breakfast, this hotel also provides daily afternoon tea, cheongsam photos, and children's games and activities... Next time I come, I will still choose Lin's Mansion^_^

msg:They contacted me in advance and asked for the ferry time. A handsome guy was waiting at the pier to help carry my luggage.
The hotel is on a winding road, so it's a bit difficult to find it on your own. But the good thing is it's quiet. The afternoon tea provided was just the right thing to soothe your hunger pangs.
Breakfast is a set meal, one for each person, including porridge and side dishes. It doesn't look like much, which is just right for girls with normal appetites. Cantaloupe is very sweet😄
I stayed in a parent-child duplex room. The wardrobe door on the second floor was made of transparent glass, with a mirror attached to the back and a bathrobe hung inside. When I went upstairs, I didn't pay attention and was startled, thinking there was someone inside🫣. The mirror faces the bed, emmmmm, if possible, don’t use this mirror. Children are timid and easily frightened.
The next day, I checked out of the room, stored my luggage, and set off to explore the island again. It was almost time to go back, so I contacted the hotel in advance and helped deliver the luggage to the pier. This is very thoughtful.

msg:The best hotel on Gulangyu Island is the former residence of Taiwan's great landowners and wealthy people. It has a history of more than 100 years and is different from other buildings on the island in style. It is quiet and far-reaching. There are guys who will pick you up and drop you off when you check in and out of the hotel, which is a big help for us who are dragging big suitcases. Otherwise, we would not be able to get up at all. The roads on the island are all uphill and downhill. I want to sit on the luggage trolley. We got in the car and he even helped deliver the boxes to the room, which was so reliable. Non-staying guests are basically not allowed to enter the courtyard to ensure safety and quiet. Because it is the top ten mansions on the island, there are always tour guides bringing individual guests to the door to introduce it. At this time, I was enjoying the afternoon tea provided by the hotel in the garden, and I felt secretly happy ヽ(≧Д≦)ノ. The guy at the front desk was very handsome. He even chatted with my mother about the history of the house. The service was very good. The breakfast is also good, the bath water is very flush, and it is quiet at night, suitable for resting. Recommend everyone to choose here!

The night before, when I was still in Xiamen, I received a call from my housekeeper Xiao Gao, and I agreed to pick him up after landing on the island tomorrow. After arriving at the pier, the housekeeper Xiao Gao had been waiting for a long time and helped carry the luggage for a kilometer of gravel road. Thank you very much for your hard work Xiao Gao. In addition, an exquisite Chinese dim sum afternoon tea was given as a gift, which was enjoyed in the lobby of Lin's Mansion, giving it a sense of luxury that transcended time and space. Like again!

It was a wealthy area during the Republic of China, and the famous octagonal building is now the location of the lobby. It is also the most famous historical relic in Gulangyu Island, magnificent. The facade of the small building is clear gray, with round arches, round arched window frames, and dark brown wooden shutters. The four buildings have their own characteristics. The building we are in is the first building when you enter the door. The corridors are all wooden. The floor is made of wood, shiny and red, and there are historical components displayed on both sides of the lobby on the first floor. The old-fashioned record player often emits the lingering sound of "Night Shanghai" by the old Shanghai Paramount, as if traveling through the luxurious nightlife of **, lazy , Cozy, petty bourgeois enjoyment. The overall decoration of the small courtyard is very ethnic, classical, retro, rich in the style of the Republic of China, with its own small garden, fountain, tall longan trees covering the sky and the sun, longan strings hanging from the lush tree cover, and the fruits are abundant and readily available. The courtyard is a combination of Chinese and Western, on the lively street. Next to the city, it seems to exist independently from the world, and it is very quiet.
Location: Not far from the snack street, 2 minutes to Haitiantang, 5 minutes to Yuyuan and Haoyueyuan respectively

Facilities: first-class facilities, advanced accessories, small refrigerator with enough drinks in advance, free of charge
Hygiene: super safe hygienic environment

Service: From the store manager to the service in the lobby, the service is friendly, thoughtful, and meticulous, the communication is gentle and elegant, and the contact is very comfortable. The management is humanized, thinking about what the tenants think, and urging what the tenants are anxious about, with pick-up and drop-off at the pier, first-class service style, and a sense of VIP experience.



Tenant benefits:
1. Free cheongsam photo, paper umbrella, round fan (free rental)
2. Free breakfast, lots of side dishes, rich styles, nice taste
3. 12% discount for dinner at Lin Fu family banquet, enjoy VIP-level trea**ent.
4. Free photo taking in the exclusive courtyard, very popular

A day's accommodation, full of satisfaction and happiness, before leaving, it is difficult to give up, the environment, the service, and the people here.
I am determined not only to come again, but also to recommend friends to live here.

Except for Xiamen Zengcuo'an's homestay, the other three were satisfied. Shenzhen's No. 6 Garden Villa is very cost-effective and has good western food. The citi go Huange Hotel in the cruise center is favored by modern young people. The last Linshifu Hotel I stayed in was really recommended. The old house of Lin Erjia, the builder of Shuzhuang Garden in Gulangyu Island, was rebuilt. I also saw a lot of beautiful old houses in two days. My child said to my mother that I still think the place we live in is the most beautiful [pleasant]. The management is good. Although it has been converted into a hotel for many years, it does not have the musty smell of an old hotel. The service is also very good. The waiter picks up the pier, the toiletries are L'Occitane, and the breakfast in Jiugongge is also to your taste. The Dingjing Building, Octagonal Building, Crystal Building and other buildings are all beautiful. My favorite is the towering trees in the courtyard, such as camphor trees, kapok and fruit. Tired longan...

From the beginning of the reservation, the staff will contact you in advance to arrange the pick-up to the island. Personally, I think Lin's Mansion should be one of the best hotels on the island. The younger brother and younger sister at work have a great attitude, friendly and kind. Since I increased my demand for the room, I also met it, which is a great surprise! highly recommended! BTY Hotel will also provide free cheongsam borrowing~ worth a try, I will stay here again next time I go

In order to take care of our travel time, the hotel specially asked the chef and service staff to go to work in advance, which is very considerate.

The service is really not inferior to star-rated hotels. I received a call from the hotel the next day after booking. I added WeChat to send the hotel address in advance, and called us many times to communicate with us about the itinerary. There are staff on the upper and lower islands to pick up and drop off luggage, which is very convenient. I bought the night ferry ticket this time. I called the hotel after boarding the boat. The elder brother who worked hard at night came to pick us up. It is very fate that the same elder brother sent us off the next day. Thank you very much! The hotel is full of age, and there is a unique quietness in Gulangyu Island, which is full of fireworks. It is beautiful to stay quietly in the hotel, drink a cup of afternoon tea, have some refreshments, or rent a cheongsam and take some photos quietly. one day.

The facilities and decoration in the room are relatively simple, not the decoration standard of a luxury hotel. Because there are two beds to be installed, the interior of the room is also relatively crowded.

Breakfast is also average, white porridge with side dishes and eggs. The gap with other hotels of the same price is too obvious.

The hotel provides a free luggage pick-up service, and the staff will help with luggage, which is great. The public area is very nice, with a small garden and fountain at the back.

msg:The hotel itself is a cultural relic, the architecture and courtyard design are very stylish, the rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable! The hotel also provides cheongsam rentals for guests, making guests feel as if they have traveled through time. The front desk went to the restaurant to help during the meal time, and the response speed was very slow. There is a little brother named Lin Yutao who is very kind and enthusiastic, thank you again! The only downside is the breakfast, which doesn't start until 8 o'clock. It's too late to eat if you sign up for a group trip, and the breakfast only has porridge and side dishes, which is greasy and single, and the fruit is only 1/4 of an apple.

msg:I have a certain complex with Gulangyu Island. I came here to travel when I just graduated. After more than ten years, my children will go to school, and I want to visit the old place again. Back then, I lived in various small B&Bs, but this time I chose the historic Lin's Mansion. The overall experience is really good! Except that the room is smaller and the facilities are slightly less, the quality of service and linen supplies is very good! From the moment of arrival, there are hotel waiters who pick up the station and help push the luggage, and the station is also sent ~ thank you! After arriving, we received the room and introduced the general facilities. At night, the child vomited up the bed sheets and quilts after taking medicine, and he helped to replace them all in a timely manner~~ Breakfast is one serving per person. It is very delicate and delicious, and you can add more if it is not enough. The surrounding environment is very good, there are many landscaping, and it is also very quiet, without the disturbance of tourists. He is also responsive to our various needs, a big thumbs up! If I come to Gulangyu Island in the future, I will choose Lin's Mansion~

He told us that we can rent cheongsam and props for free. The style is beautiful and the workmanship is exquisite , Wearing a cheongsam and taking pictures at the hotel, it’s too good 😍, the food in the hotel is much more delicious than the Internet celebrity restaurants outside, real materials, authentic taste😋 If you bring children, you can also participate in the puppet performance experience class, personally Making puppets is a lot of fun. Anyway, the experience of staying this time is really great, and the accommodation service and food are full marks💯

It is more than enough for our three girlfriends to live in. A family of three with two elderly people is suitable for living. It's amazing. Outside the balcony is a small fountain garden, elegant and quiet. The breakfast is exquisite. I rented a cheongsam to take pictures. The rental time for the clothes is very long. You can take pictures slowly. Not only can you take pictures in the hotel, but you can also go out to various scenic spots outside, which is very considerate. Very good hotel, highly recommended 👍

After telling the front desk that we need to drink more tea and water every day, the hotel put a lot of mineral water in the room. The breakfast is exquisite and nutritious. Everything is so appropriate.

What attracts me most about Gulangyu Island is that the owners of these old houses on the island have lived and traveled at home and abroad for many years. The hotel has the characteristics of the Republic of China, and has abandoned the small and dark traditional Chinese-style old houses. Outside the windows, there are lush green plants, flowers in full bloom, and birds and flowers everywhere. Everything has the taste of old money. I will stay in this hotel when I come to Gulangyu Island in the future. Six-star praise.

In terms of service, it is of an average standard. I took two children to check in and did not take the initiative to pick up the luggage at the pier, nor did I send it to the pier. The breakfast is fixed and the taste is average, but the egg yolk pastry in the afternoon tea snack is very suitable for my appetite. Generally speaking, it is more suitable for couples or individual travel. If you bring children, it is more suitable to stay in a star hotel.

Even during the Spring Festival holiday, all receptions are in place and friendly. The facilities in the room are very good, the details are thoughtful, the rich historical and cultural environment and the unique architectural style are unmatched by other five-star hotels of foreign-related brands. Suggestions: one is to add a basket in the bathroom to place the linen that needs to be replaced; the other is to add a movable vanity mirror in the bathroom; the third is that the TV is not used smoothly. Fourth, choose bottled water with a larger net content.

The guy who checked in was very serious. He called us in time after he could check in. The luggage was sent to the room before us. The sanitation is very good and clean. The old house is well maintained Well, the water temperature of the shower is stable, the water output is large, the sewer pipes are smooth, and the linen is also very clean. The pajamas that were thrown on the bed before going out are neatly folded. The breakfast is a set meal, porridge + meat floss + eggs + honey and apples are fixed Combination, in addition, there are six kinds of hot and cold dishes with different combinations every day, and the buns also have different fillings every day, all of which are delicious. In short, I am very satisfied, and the price/performance ratio is much higher than many hotels on the island and on the island.

msg:I contacted the hotel in advance and asked for a pick-up from the dock. The receptionist had been waiting at the dock a long time ago. He helped us carry our luggage along the way, and also introduced us to the stories of the buildings along the way. It will break the wheels of the box, which is a good detail! The hotel building is western style, the interior is designed in the style of the Republic of China, the room looks quite new, the air conditioner is completely wet in summer, the room is fully equipped, refrigerator, safe, coffee bar, rain bathtub, good sound insulation very quiet. Afternoon tea was delivered to the room by calling the front desk. The wrong tea was delivered at the beginning, but before I found out, I sent a package of the correct tea. The breakfast is very rich, the congee and side dishes, the pork floss are particularly delicious, and there is a small dumpling on the Dragon Boat Festival. I also had a dinner at the hotel, which was also booked at the front desk. There is a menu in the room. You can order or order a set meal. I booked a 428 set meal with ginger duck and lion head. The amount is really big. , Two people can support the wall until they eat. The restaurant is also a butler-style service. Every dish will be introduced, which is very good. The Dragon Boat Festival in Xiamen is too hot, and Gulangyu is a small island. Ten minutes out of the house is like a sauna. I take a bath 2/3 times a day. Asking the front desk to send an extra bath towel into the room is also very fast. The service is very warm and very satisfied. Finally, when I was leaving the island, I happened to meet the little brother who picked us up, and he took the initiative to send us to the pier. Overall, I was very satisfied and had a good rest~

前台服務員有些冷漠，一路來其實顏值高年紀輕是不太適合做服務的。反而拉行李的叔叔非常有服務意識。高檔酒店的服務不是服從，是像主人家帶着客人那種客氣，是好客主人翁的那種舒服。這點上青做的很好，你首先把細節做好，這樣客人就會對你尊重，然後你就可以表達自己的個性。

入住的是定靜樓園景貴賓房，房間很大，採光很好，推窗可見花園，百年香樟，噴泉錦鯉，鳥叫蟲鳴，舒適自然。 
看着老婆穿上酒店自帶的旗袍，在樓中穿走，花園漫步，讓我彷彿穿越時空，回到百年前的民國時代。 
入住體驗，酒店的工作人員很熱情，餐廳飯菜可口，唯一美中不足，酒店早餐看着精緻卻可選擇單一，唯有白粥。

衞生：衞生做的較差，房間設施老舊也就算了，但是櫃子，陽台都很厚的灰，陽台甚至還有上一個住客留下的水果殘渣，感覺床品也不乾淨，住的複式，睡鋪了一次性床單的沒事，另外一張沒鋪一次性床單的人被不知道什麼東西咬了一身疙瘩，紅腫的厲害
設施：房間老舊，空氣流通特別差，員工説是中央空調，所以房間的空調不可調節，衹能開着暖氣或者關掉，入住當天挺熱的，在空氣不流通的房間裏還開着空調簡直受罪，關了空調也還是悶熱的很，尤其是閣樓，無敵的悶，帶小孩的勸退，孩子一晚上睡不好，起來哭幾趟
服務：服務態度整體還是可以的，除了辦入住的前台人員語調冷冰冰之外，其他人都很友好，會有人專門接送行李，餐廳的員工也很好，外院的小姐姐也很温柔，不斷注意寶寶的安全，因為沒有床圍，要求多提供兩個枕頭，工作人員也大半夜的拿過來了
餐廳：口味中規中矩，沒有特別好吃也不算難吃，早餐清淡管飽，適合廣東胃
就住了一個晚上整體感受都還可以，唯一受不了的就是房間空氣和温度，太難受了，大人小孩都一晚上煎熬

床品不錯，乳膠枕尤其好。酒店安靜，有個不錯的花園。

其實跟原來的林家別墅已經沒有關係了，原來的別墅在台風中全倒塌了，這是重建的樓，仿原來的風格。人家出了本小冊子説明歷史源流，放在房間裏。

msg:衞生：房間衞生還可以

環境：居住環境挺好，給人的感覺很舒服愜意。

服務：奇差無比❌

設施：大部分該有的都有。

❌差評吐槽：
一、酒店離碼頭太遠，送行李衹有十二點跟十四點，其餘時間衹能自己推過去，太費勁太累了。
二、酒店沒有電梯，入住時行李給你送上去，但是你走的話得自己拿下來，在拿行李下樓的時候看到一個大哥哼哧哼哧的從三樓往下搬行李……
三、酒店的服務配不上價格，這是重點吐槽的對象。
1⃣️辦好入住，想找一個打火機點個火，沒有！一個酒店連一個打火機都沒有？？？
2⃣️入住前提前幾天諮詢貴賓房間送的旗袍體驗以及下午茶，告訴説旗袍不用預約，原本下午茶是下午兩點到五點，入住時間比較晚的話下午茶第二天可以提前享用。入住的時候確認一下下午茶的事情，前台説衹能下午兩點到五點享用？？？過一會換了個人又説可以提前享用？？？能不能享用看服務員心情？？？
3⃣️第二天中午退房，行李説衹有中午12點與下午2點才有人送行李，本來想多玩一會再離島，但是路並不是平路，拖起來太費勁費力了，衹能用大車拉着走才省力，沒有辦法衹能跟着酒店的時間走，衹能接，不能送…最好還是選擇離碼頭近一點的酒店
4⃣️一點半的時候跟服務員説我們就要離店了，想享用下午茶，告訴我們下午茶衹能下午兩點到下午五點？？？搞笑呢嗎？是崗前培訓不到位還是怎麼了？換了個人又可以享用了，呵呵！重點來了❌❌❌一點半告訴服務員我們2點跟着行李就走了，一點五十下午茶還沒上！！！跟服務員溝通還狡辯説剛才上了四人份的，難不成我把水杯盤子都吃了？？？一點五十五上來了，兩杯開水冒着煙，幾塊茶店，一包茶葉，一個水壺三個水杯。五分鐘我喝開水？？我吃不吃你這幾塊東西都可以，五個人三間房五千多塊我差你這一點吃的東西嗎？？既然你告訴我有這個服務，那我享受這個服務有問題嗎？？服務跟不上，就會拉低整體檔次，花費這個錢完全可以享受更好的服務，而不是受氣。

衞生：有一些小瑕疵，但跟管家反應過後，很快就處理了。


環境：太適合穿旗袍拍照了，特別是每棟樓內的風格都不一樣！！！


服務：這個服務也是沒話説哦～有任何需求都可以跟管家或前台説，他們第一時間會幫你安排處理好，另外就是退房後送行李至碼頭的服務，可以根據客人的時間來定，提前預約就好。

另外有一點不得不誇一下，房間裏的那個乳膠枕是真的太舒服，很難得遇到一家酒店會貼心提供不那麼軟的枕頭，出來旅行中所有的疲憊感都在一個極度舒適的枕頭上消散了～

總結，這個價格來説特別中規中矩，性價比一般。

msg:環境不錯，水晶樓親子房非常划算，感覺是原來兩間客房改的套房，有個很大的廳（應該是原來的走廊改的吧）主卧兩張單人床，側卧一張雙人床，三人住足夠。酒店看得出來有年頭但維護的很好，裝飾很用心，我特別喜歡水晶樓的水晶燈和床頭燈，衣櫃也很好看。飲用水都是套袋子的，很好。礦泉水袋子 拖鞋袋子和整個房間風格很搭配。
衞生也不錯，不過個人感覺和希爾頓君悦等五星酒店還是稍有差距，床底靠外位置，浴缸靠牆側的邊，感覺這兩個是衞生死角。但窗子都很乾凈，這個很贊，因為是木百葉窗，臟了不好看。
來鼓浪嶼林氏府是非常值得一住的。很有味道。

msg:這個房子在島上也算價位比較高的了，優點和缺點參半，我來客觀説下吧。

優點：1.房子是以前的領事館，從建築到內飾都很有品質，有歷史文化感。
             2.衞生很乾凈，打電話給前台拿東西之類的響應很快。辦理入住的兩個美女非常友好，其中一個比空姐還漂亮，説話很有素養；
            3.從碼頭到酒店和返程都有人拿行李，這點很好。因為酒店離三丘田碼頭有些距離，有人幫忙拿行李還是方便很多
            4.贈送的早餐，雖然簡單但很用心，味道也不錯，送餐的高高的帥哥很不錯，有親和力，響應也快

缺點：
 1.住的複式親子房，樓下實在太太小了，被傢俱填的滿滿的，幾乎沒空地，三大一小，沒什麼地方放行李，行李箱如果放地上打開就會沒地方走路。
2.既然主題是親子，沒有小童馬桶可以接受，連小童馬桶圈都沒有，太奇葩了，從沒經歷過這樣的的親子房間，有娃的都知道沒有小童馬桶圈，娃上廁所大人的腰累死。餐廳午餐和晚餐裏看了好久，幾乎沒有適合小童的餐食。
3.最不能接受的一件事，我去廈門，各種酒店門票車票一堆，有些可能沒看仔細或忘記了，我的房間是帶了下午茶，mini吧餐食，旗袍租用，木偶課堂，這些從辦理到離開沒有任何人提起、提醒，我也沒享受這些項目。退房問客服，客服有一搭沒一搭的就恢復了幾句，沒別的就強調我們給你發了短訊短訊裏有！後面就不回覆了。
我查閲了下短訊，找到了，我短訊太多了，已經很多沒看了。
首先商業邏輯上就不對，客户買了東西（贈品其實本質都是花錢的）見面後要主動交付，而不是説給你發個短訊就完了，連提都不提
其次同理心差，發個短訊就認為客户一定會看，換位想想當你自己是客户時，就知道這個樣不合適了
最後態度差，客户提出問題完全不反思服務流程是不是真的有問題，不當回事懶的理你的姿態，其實客户不斷反饋問題的過程就是酒店服務不斷升級的過程。

多少錢的酒店就有多大的預期，綜合以上整體上還是低於預期吧。

酒店是南陽風情建築，處處細節彰顯品味和温情
管家會在港口接送和幫忙搬運行李，到了酒店房間也已經安排好了，有任何問題都可以隨時聯繫他們
因為環境太舒服了，我們當場決定再住一天，捨不得走了
雖然是歷史建築，但是設施都非常的人性化和完善，比方説廁所的排風系統本來以為是壞了，後來才知道它是靜音的hh
兩天的早飯都很精緻，也有不同，蘋果配百香果醬和肉鬆都非常的驚艷
房間的陽台和走廊都非常出片
一切都是五星級的體驗，期待下一次在這裏度假

中秋節全家人就從島內坐船來鼓浪嶼度假！
這次住的酒店是我在鼓浪嶼住過最乾淨，最有特色，環境最好，服務最到位的酒店！

衞生間的門有些松，打了電話後工作人員迅速來維修，服務態度超級好！

酒店的電視有些不好用，工作人員剛來調好，一會又出現沒網絡，反正也不看電視，就不打攪工作人員了！

酒店距離鋼琴碼頭也近，也會路過美食街，所以吃也很方便！

唯一後悔的是開房間時工作人員並沒有明確告知我酒店提供拍照服裝，退房時問了工作人員才知道！

下次來鼓浪嶼還住這裏，正好彌補這次沒有租服裝拍照的遺憾！

設施：基本上完善的，歷史建築也不會加裝電梯，上下樓是樓梯，但服務生小哥會幫忙提行李箱上下樓。
衞生：房間和大廳以及園內的衞生都是好的。
環境：推窗即園林，其實我可以哪都不去就在房間呆一天也算是散心了
服務：前台是24小時值班的，從入住到退房禮賓做的真的不錯。
府內庭院下午茶:是在附樓大堂吧用的，準備的茶糕點和餅。味道還行，茶好喝。

msg:I went to Gulangyu Island in Xiamen to read Little Red Book. This hotel is very famous, so I booked two days in advance. It was not cheap, more than 1,000 for one day, and more than 3,000 for two days. I stayed for one day because I had to go back to the company due to temporary work arrangements, and asked to check out early. No, it’s the first time I’ve seen this kind of place, and the attitude is bad. The environment doesn’t match the description. It’s not very big or grand. The room is dark and dark.

msg:If there were 0 points, I would not even give 1 point. From the beginning of check-in, it was because the front desk was not familiar with the business process, which delayed time. Later, due to changes in the itinerary, the original 2-day itinerary was adjusted to 1 day, and the hotel said They have to deduct 80% of the room charge for the second day as liquidated damages, which is a very tough attitude. I called the Gulangyu Market Management and Supervision Office to complain, but they were told that this was normal in Gulangyu. I was speechless. Over the years, all the hotels at home and abroad that I have stayed in, whether they are 5-star hotels or B&Bs, have settled room fees based on the actual number of days of stay. The cost of "early departure" like this should be borne by the hotel itself. part of the responsibility. Therefore, I would like to remind all tourists who travel to Gulangyu Island in Xiamen to be cautious about their itinerary. If you can’t afford it, don’t stay there. If you really want to stay, you would rather book less than overbook to avoid losses like mine again.

msg:This hotel does have some characteristics of the Republic of China and old house elements, and it lends out some cheongsams (I don’t know about disinfection). From my personal experience, if the unit price of this hotel exceeds 500 to 600 yuan, it is not as good as staying in a five-star hotel in the city (it is completely possible to go back and forth from Gulangyu to the city on the same day). I hope the hotel will provide service attentively and not take advantage of some elements and the lack of hotels on the island to just make money from foreign tourists like us who don’t know the truth.
