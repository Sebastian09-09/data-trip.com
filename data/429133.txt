Carrying luggage and cleaning the guest room are very natural and thoughtful. Chinese and Western kitchenware and tableware are all available. It is clean and hygienic, and provides a very good environment for us to invite friends to have a party during our trip to Tianjin. The breakfast provided is also very rich and delicious. The reception by the doorman and front desk staff is warm and professional. We will stay at the Marriott Tianjin Hotel again if we have the opportunity. apartment.

msg:It was my first time to stay in this apar**ent and I had a very good experience. First of all, it is a conjoined building with the Tianjin Hotel. Now they are both owned by the Marriott Group. They share a large lawn and green space. The gym and swimming pool are all next to the apar**ent building, which is very convenient. The front desk, room and restaurant services are very warm. Considering the large number of people having breakfast during the National Day holiday, we specially set up a breakfast area on the first floor of the apar**ent. This is very thoughtful. Especially since I have elderly people in my family who have inconvenient legs and feet, it is really great to have breakfast downstairs🥹I will go there again during the Spring Festival.

You can bring a dog weighing no more than 45 kilograms, but the dog I brought only weighed 40 kilograms. I commented in the previous booking information. And the attitude of the front desk staff was bad. We said we would not bring it into the room. The child was tired and the dog could not go upstairs and put it in the car. We were not allowed to check in. They asked us to go out quickly. Later, the lobby manager of their hotel came to deal with it Regarding the matter, no one from the apar**ent side came forward at all, and even deleted the bad review I gave before. If you can’t bear it, don’t make promises on the platform. It brings so much trouble to customers, and the job number written by the front desk staff is also I don’t know if it’s hers. The name is also in English. It’s dishonest and dishonest to say that she is called this name in the hotel without a Chinese name.

2. In terms of service, it is uneven.
The receptionist I met on the first day, who had long hair, tall white eyes and big eyes, had a very good service attitude. During the epidemic, check-in procedures were more cumbersome, but she was very efficient and guided guests professionally.
The person I met at the front desk the next day was a bit thin with glasses. He was very unprofessional. He spoke in a stiff manner without a subject or basic honorifics. He was incomprehensible and his attitude was not good. This made him feel bad about the apar**ent. . The attitude at the front desk greatly affects the mood of the guests. I hope you will not encounter it.
3. Some other introductions. The apar**ent and Tianjin Hotel are in the same park. There are many green plants and it is more comfortable. I go to Tianjin Hotel for breakfast. The variety is okay. There are all kinds of freshly made noodles and pancakes. It is normal five-star standards. It is nothing. question.
4. If you drive, tell the front desk your license plate number. Parking is free in the park.
5. There is an indoor swimming pool and gym

I took advantage of my daughter’s staycation to cheer her up before taking her exams. I booked a one-bedroom apartment and brought my Switch to play with me. The apartment is fully equipped and the environment is good. It is connected to the entire hinterland of Renaissance, which is very large. There are green spaces and trees everywhere. The service is reasonable and friendly. I use the Ritz executive suite. You can stay here for three nights for the night price, which is great value for money. I will make arrangements to stay here when I have a vacation in the future.
The only small drawback is that the external HDMI port and USB port in the living room are old and unusable. It is recommended to repair them to increase guest convenience.
