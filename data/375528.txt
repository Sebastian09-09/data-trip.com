msg:I'm writing this express my disappointment and frustration with the air conditioning in the room during my recent stay . Despite having the air conditioning on, my partner and I woke up feeling extremely stuffy on two consecutive nights. We called the front desk, and the night manager explained that the hotel uses a central air conditioning system. We were offered a fan, which we declined, expecting a functioning air conditioning system for a 5-star hotel.

After feedback from multiple guests, the operations team eventually turned on the air conditioning. However, the issue persisted on the second night. We spoke with Mr. Gavin Zhu at the front desk, who explained that the hotel wouldn't adjust the temperature due to a lack of complaints. After our feedback, he got the engineering department to adjust the temperature.

I commend Mr. Zhu for his efforts, but the issue highlights a possible instructional problem. As a 5-star hotel, a basic expectation is a fully functioning air conditioning system with both warm and cold modes available for guests' comfort. It's unacceptable to compromise on this fundamental aspect of hospitality.

I hope you'll investigate this matter and take necessary steps to ensure the air conditioning is at the right temperature centrally, allowing guests to adjust it to their preference. Thank you for your attention, and please pass along my thanks to the night operations team, including Mr. Gavin Zhu, for their efforts to resolve the situation.

Since we come to Shanghai for traveling so one major tourist spot was covered really well along with other major destinations like yu garden, lujiazui, bund, people square at close distance. Food joint outside cover all the kinds of cuisine. Gym and swimming pool was excellent even though my kid liked ping pong table and spend a lot of time there. The reception was really warm and welcoming. Room was upgraded and really comfortable. Even though my photography skills are not very good but i have tried to take some pictures.

The aunties whom cleaned up the rooms makes it more perfect, despite i didnt require for room make up they still provide a bag of toiletry stuffs for me and placed outside the room. i would have been a little disappointed that when i check-in the room, the cleaner is still vacuuming the floor :/ i was stunned. how can the front-desk told me the room is ready when the room is still being make up, and also no confirmed check. otherwise, it wld have been good with shopping and food street and mrt stations just a footstep away.

Breakfast was okay, location is good however we had difficulties in calling taxi in DiDI taxi apps (english version) as it does not correctly pin the location. But the staff is always willing to assist to call a taxi for you. Overall staff service is good but not sure if i will be returning to this hotel for my next trip. Room really needs some refurbishment work.

Room was nice and well equipped. 
Only downside was that it was quit loud because of noise outside. Windows do not block sound well‚Ä¶ but I am also very sensitive for this‚Ä¶ 
Breakfast was quite good for a hotel in China. Western and Chinese choices. Not top level but not bad.
Check out was done in seconds and deposit refund also went well and was quite fast. 
Not sure if I would come back (since I prefer other areas in shanghai) but definitely not a bad choice.

We were told on the front desk that our rooms are being upgraded to recently renovated rooms. We were excited until we got to 12th floor and the moment we entered the room there was a strong smell like toilet smell or sewage. Bear in mind that we had a 2 month old baby with us. We went out and came back to the room and the smell had gotten worse. Until by midnight the manager was convinced to change our room after a long delay. Also in our two day stay we couldn‚Äôt take a proper shower. Water was lukewarm and even at times cold. 

Cut the long story short, it wasn‚Äôt the same hotel at all. Won‚Äôt go back again unless we absolutely have to.

msg:I have very bad experienced staying in this hotel- Crowne Plaza Shanghai Nanjing Road, Shanghai China which claimed a 5 star hotel, 
I checked in on Thursday 17th January at 4pm and everything is fine and smooth. Upon check-in my room# 1301 (with window but cannot open),  
I felt something wrong with the room temperature (very warm) even I did not turn on the temperature controller in the room. 
As I have dinner appointment, I thought it is normal and I went out for dinner.

When I come back to my room around 10pm, the ambient in the room still very warm and I thought is because of the room lights generate warm heat. 
Hence, I try to turn-off and after shower I still felt very warm.

I call to front desk and ask if there is something wrong with the room temperature and how to turn on the air conditioning, they told me that the 
temperature controller cannot operate and the center heater outlet will continuous generate heat. 
I make complaint to the front desk that I couldn't rest & sleep at all !! they offer to change another room# 1021 with window which can open at near to mid night :-(

I just felt very disappointed & upset with this 5 star hotel arrangement for guest. I am very sure they knew the room having problem with the temperature controller, 
why don't they arrange a good functioning room for me in the first place and why only after I complaint almost at mid night (~11.30pm) they offer me to change room ??

My advise to all, when you discover something wrong upon check-in you shall immediately feedback to the front desk without delay or hesitation.  
It is a bad experience and lesson learnt for me with this hotel - Crowne Plaza Shanghai Nanjing Road  !! 
I will not stay in this hotel anymore.

Thank you for listening :-)

however

A lot of construction in the hotel which doesn't let you sleep at all, they start very early. I read someone's review about the construction and called teh hotel before making my reservation, they downplayed it, and said just some minor work in later hours, which totally not true, massive and continuous banging!!

Also, with the exception one person (a great member from Fiji), hardly anyone speaks any English, I stayed at the Conrad Hotel right next to Crown Plaza last year, and almost all spoke English. PLEASE have at least 2 or more members that speak English well.

The bar is high fro a top hotel such as Crowne Plaza.

Will I come back, definitely yes! The location of the hotel is great, close to Nanjing pedestrian road and many shopping centers. I gave 4 stars for the amenities, because the shower head holder was broken, so one has to hold the shower head while using it, which is not convenient. I read that someone also experienced it, so hopefully, the hotel management will fix this issue.

As I mentioned staff was very friendly, but actions were a bit slow. Maybe this happened just by some unknown circumstances, and we were upgraded.

Upon receiving our keys, we saw there are a few room numbers gap between the two rooms. When we inquire, the reception insist they don‚Äôt have connecting rooms in their hotel and that is the closest she can provide us.

She should have tell us earlier rather than just saying ok. Its disappointing.

Upon checking in, the hotel didn't offer to bring up our bags and luggage so i ended up doing two trips up and down myself. The room was nice and clean. I had booked the kids themed room as i was travelling with a toddler and baby. It came with a little teepee which they enjoyed. However the A/C was out of order which left the rooms really warm and stuffy. They had one portable A/C but ubfortunately this wasn't enough. When we asked the hotel they advised that the A/C was out of order throughout the hotel building. The swimming pool was also not opened while we were there as it is undergoing renovation. I was actually looking forward to using the pool amenities. Had i known this then perhaps I may have booked elsewhere. Location is great. Its located in the heart of Nanjing Rd Pedestrian Street so everything is available within walking distance.

Location is good for shopping and a short walk to the Bund. Basically, everything you need. Rooms are a little dated but that‚Äôs subjective. Also no USB in the rooms so don‚Äôt forget your phone charger. Generous water bottle supply. Comfortable bed.

msg:The hotel was very central to the main Nanjing pedestrian street that leads all the way to the bund. If you are active you can get to a lot of places just by walking around with no need for the metro. The check in process was easy and the lady who checked us in was very friendly. The room was a little on the small side, but the bed was huge and comfortable, to our knowledge the place has been recently renovated but it doesn‚Äôt seem to have put much money in the areas that matter. The windows still seem to only be single plated and don‚Äôt do much to keep the cold out in winter. Luckily we weren‚Äôt facing a noisy side. The door to our room would also not always lock properly unless pulled it in place properly. We would make sure it was locked before leaving, but when coming back we would find we could open it without the key after the cleaners had used it. Also the rooms venting is connected with other rooms and despite there being no smoking signs around they are clearly not strictly enforced as we could smell smoke in our bathroom and occasionally in the bedroom from the guests in other rooms. If we could smell it clearly the cleaners would smell it from the rooms it is coming from but despite signs saying there will be fines they are not reporting signs of smoking in the rooms.

The front desk called us twice in the middle of the night for no apparent reason. A cleaning lady rang the doorbell while the do not disturb sign was on very early in the morning. When I explained the situation to the Manager Ariana LiuÔºåshe completely ignored me, pretended to take my complain into consideration. The level of incompetence at this hotel is incredible. Not to mention that it took me 15 minutes to check in and 20 minutes to check out. A surreal experience. Do NOT stay at this hotel.

overall, not a great experience _ not as good as intercontinental hotels _ . the staff however did make a good impression. 
overall, 3.5 to 4 star hotel elsewhere. at most a 4 star in China.

msg:Location- The location was ideal. The hotel is located close to The Bund which is a major attraction in Shanghai. There is also a Luckin Coffee right across from the hotel. There is also a bus stop and the metro station in walking distance from the hotel. However, locating a DIdi proved to be a problem while staying there so when you call a Didi you might not find the taxi easily. 

Appearance/Amenities The Lobby and Restaurant Area are very beautiful! They have an ancient look. You can take great pictures in either areas. Everything we wanted for our stay was provided. 

Cleanliness- The hotel was very clean! The room was also clean. The room was cleaned regularly too. The housekeepers were also polite and warm. They did their jobs well. 

Service- I appreciate the service provided. My friend came over and she paid for an extra bed and the bed was so soft and comfy. It was also a good size bed. The staff was accommodating. It was my birthday and the hotel gave me a delicious slice of cheese cake. The front desk staff speaks English, which is awesome. They also said gave me a card to take a free drink at the restaurant upon leaving.




I had a great stay and birthday here. Thank you!

It would be better if it was changed to a twin bed, which is more suitable for families with children! The location is very good, just a few minutes walk from Line 2. Downstairs is Xinya Cantonese Restaurant, which is especially suitable for buying rice dumplings! Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings. Wang Jiajia, the receptionist at the front desk, waived the child‚Äôs meal fee when checking in, which is in line with the standards of an InterContinental five-star hotel. The service attitude is gentle and friendly. In addition, the service is not enthusiastic. No one takes the initiative to help with luggage. The restaurant catering is very average, unlike the InterContinental Beijing. Needless to say, the waiters in the restaurant didn't even smile the whole time. Such a negative work attitude in the early morning had a great impact on the guests and the hotel. After all, who doesn't want to see a picture of sunshine in the morning? Where's his face? After four days of observation at breakfast, I found that there are signs of poor service. The person wearing black clothes at the door should be the restaurant manager. He has a very serious face when seeing guests every day. He has no expression during the whole process of swiping the room card when he enters the door. Therefore, the leadership of a team is very important and directly affects the overall level of the team!

I had to catch the high-speed train on the day of check-out, and the service staff said that because of the second group of foreign tourists in the back row, I was in a hurry and let them get into the taxi first without asking my opinion. They had no concept of queuing and were very unprofessional. As a result, I missed catching the high-speed train by two minutes. I waited at the station for nearly three hours to buy a new ticket, which disrupted everything I had planned for the day. journey.

I saw on Ctrip that it was renovated in 2019 and booked this hotel. When I checked in, I was told by the front desk that the old room was renovated in 1998. When I saw it, it was no different from a three-star hotel. There was a musty smell. I refused this room because I had children, and was told that there was no check-out fee. But this is fraud. It says that it was renovated in 2019, but it is selling a room that was renovated in 1998. Isn't it a fraud? So I made countless calls to Ctrip and the Shanghai Municipal Government at 12345, asking the hotel to abolish the overlord clause. But the hotel is Crown Plaza, so why would it listen to the government? So the hotel asked me to add 350 yuan and gave me a room that was not renovated in 1998. I spent 1,550 yuan for one night in a small room of 27 square meters. I hope that this kind of behavior that confuses customers will not happen again, and that they will not make money by deducting room fees. I hope Ctrip can note the rooms that were renovated in 1998 to prevent customers from being fooled.

msg:A very good hotel. I originally wanted to find a hotel near People's Square, but I didn't expect it to be on Nanjing West Road. There is a pedestrian street downstairs. The transportation is so convenient. Since I was traveling with an elderly person, I specifically requested that they be arranged together so that they could be taken care of easily. I didn‚Äôt expect that the hotel would have two rooms connected together, with a common door, so that our two rooms would be open at all times. Don't worry. And both rooms can see the Bund. The room facilities are very well maintained and have a classic a**osphere. The bathroom has a bathtub and is very large. The waiters are always friendly and greet you. After leaving, Starry Cui Wenjing came to ask about her satisfaction. Such a cost-effective hotel in Shanghai is really the best choice.

Every time I called back, I was so respected that I almost had all the room types in Nan Xinya. The advantage of this small suite is that it has a lot of space and is very comfortable for one person to live in. However, the maintenance of this room type is really a bit average. First, the door is deformed, leaking, and the sound insulation is poor. The chatter of other residents in the corridor can be clearly heard. Second, the voltage problem makes the bedside reading lamp look weird. The switch is turned on. Sometimes it will turn off and light up again

Check-in was quick, the receptionist was very professional and courteous, and I was given a free upgrade. The room is clean and tidy. The only drawback is that the toilet is relatively small. The toilet is in a very small space. It is a bit difficult to turn around after closing the door!

The hotel has an excellent location, with a pedestrian street behind it and very close to the subway station. The price/performance ratio is very high. Next time I go to Shanghai, I will still choose to stay at Nan Xinya!

I deliberately chose the newly renovated room type.
five star hotel. There is a sign for Crowne Plaza. It's really embarrassing, so shameful.
1. Take a cold shower. Repair is not effective. Cold showers in the evening and morning. Later, the child caught a cold and had a fever.
2. Live cockroaches were found in the room.
3. There is no sincerity in the explanation process. Always make it a point to give them another chance. Willing to provide some financial compensation. It feels like money can make up for it.
4. I gave them time. I haven't seen any sincere plans either.
Tell the truth, let's consider moving in.

1: The hotel lobby is relatively bright. The guy wearing glasses at the check-in desk gave a very warm reception. The hotel rooms are also clean and sanitary. It is worthy of being a hotel under the InterContinental Hotels Group.
2: The hotel‚Äôs breakfast, lunch, and dinner are worthy of praise. They are relatively refreshing, have a wide variety of dishes, and the taste is what we prefer.

The waiters are warm and considerate, understand the needs in advance, and arrange rooms suitable for guests, such as quietness.
The lobby is grand, has a sense of design, and is in European style. The furniture in the room is of high quality and the color matching is retro style. Particularly outstanding. It feels like every piece of furniture and every combination is carefully designed.
The room is quiet, and the room you stay in can look towards the Pearl River and the Bund. I recommend this hotel and will stay here again in the future.
It's just near Nanjing Road, and the transportation is very convenient. It's also very convenient for shopping and eating around.
The only thing I would like to improve is to have a few chairs in the lobby to sit and wait for guests or taxis.

msg:Very bad hotel experience, first of all everyone should pay attention! The actual living environment is not as good as the picture, and the space is very small. I asked at the front desk why the room layout is so different from the actual one. The answer was that the picture was taken by selecting the largest space in each area, so this room type was selected with 3 rooms together. Show the optimal layout. The bathroom in the room I stayed in on the first night was extremely small, and even the door reached the bathroom sink (completely false advertising! I suggest you study the Advertising Law)
Secondly! ! Pay special attention to the bedside lamps in the hotel. I changed two rooms and almost all the bedside lamps were loose. If you are unlucky and it falls off, it will hit the metal decoration on the bedside! ! The lamp will break! At that time, you may have to pay money...

There was neither welcome fruit nor membership drink coupons. I don‚Äôt want to say another word! This negative review is mainly for the check-in service!

When he saw us getting off the car with two large luggages, he did not come to help. He stood there like a stone sculpture. . I thought it was individual. Then we thought that the trea**ent was the same when we left. The waiter at the door stared blankly and had no idea to help us get into the car. Afterwards, we estimated that this was the hotel security guard, not the waiter. But when I came to Shanghai from Hangzhou and Ningbo, the waiters at the five-star hotels along the way were very enthusiastic and came to help with my luggage. I didn‚Äôt know that the waiters at the five-star hotels in Shanghai were so noble. The service of the hotel's room attendants, front desk, and restaurant waiters was very good, enthusiastic and in place.

The new room was quiet, windowless, stuffy, and a bit hot at night. Moreover, the sink was leaking. One night, water was all over the table and on the floor, and I almost fell down (I wiped the leak on the table again on the second night of filming). I told the front desk, but the front desk ignored me and smiled. It is worth mentioning that the aunt who disturbed the room deserves praise for her service with a smile, warm-heartedness, and answering all questions. After she reported that the room was a bit stuffy at night, she took the initiative to bring an electric fan.

Also, the hair dryer is so tightly hidden in your room, are you afraid that guests will take it out and use it?

Although the room is small, it has everything you need. Although it does not have the advantage of a high floor, you can still get a glimpse of the beautiful scenery of Pudong among many high-rise buildings, which is considered a very cost-effective choice.

When I went to the front desk to find the waiter, I found that the room was still not ready and asked me to come back at 1:00. . . As a result, I went there after 8:00 pm, but the room the hotel assigned me had no hot water and the air conditioner was broken. . . Later, they changed my room to another room, but the area was obviously much smaller. The rooms are all suites but they don't even have tea or a small refrigerator. The internet was also very poor and I was forced to use my own data all the time. I never expected that the international metropolis Shanghai would have such a place open to the outside world.

The room is well soundproofed and the renovated room has no smell. The front desk check-in was starry, very considerate and efficient, and the voice was nice. I had a refund issue due to placing the wrong order before. I asked about it when I checked in, and I followed up and got an answer in a timely manner when I checked out. The breakfast food was quite satisfactory. Although it hit the May Day peak, it was very orderly. It was a good stay experience.

The hotel facilities are relatively old and the decoration is also relatively old. The environment is average, not what a five-star hotel should be, and there are many foreign friends staying there. There is always a pungent smell of cheap perfume in the lobby. Overall, I am not satisfied!

Because my business trip schedule changed several times, I was unable to stay overnight, and I had to extend the trip for another day, so it was a trip that wasted a lot of unnecessary things. Moreover, the hotel's rigid service and inconsiderate attitude did not help at all. The toilet was clogged at 3 a.m., so I went to the front desk to request service, but had a hard time because the room key didn't work. Of course, it was my mistake to not know that indoor keys and external keys were different, but if you are going to give two keys, it would be better to give them two without distinguishing them.

I think it should be taught with manners.

The customer service is excellent but this despotism between colleagues, even if it is a superior, is unacceptable. I was quite surprised at how he yelled at her and how he treated her. Awful.

I can‚Äôt go to the 14th floor from the 13th floor, and I can‚Äôt go to the 13th floor from the 14th floor. I have to take care of the elderly. It is very inconvenient for my child. He has to wear orthokeratology lenses at night and take them off in the morning, all of which require my help. Moreover, I was only given a room card on the 14th floor. My child was doing homework on the 14th floor and I went downstairs to get takeout. , I couldn‚Äôt dial the room card, and then I couldn‚Äôt get up when I came down. I asked the front desk for another room card. The tall and fat ** was very impatient and had a bad attitude. In the end, the little girl next to the front desk helped me. Yes, the most annoying thing is that when I turn off the light at night, there is a dripping sound from the wall next to the bed. It goes away when I turn on the light. You can still hear it when I turn it off. I even asked the repairman to come to repair it. For no reason, I changed rooms after one o'clock. I checked out and went to the airport at 5:30 in the morning. I only slept for a few hours. And I couldn't sleep after changing rooms. It was so scary. Why did it make a sound when I turned off the lights? , it disappeared as soon as it was turned on. The hotel also admitted that there was a sound in their room, but they couldn't explain it. Please don't stay in 1410. This room is really weird. When you turn off the main switch at the bedside, there is a beeping sound from the wall above the bed. It's beeping, but I can't find the reason yet.

msg:I stayed at your hotel from April 19th to 21st. Overall, the hotel's location is very good. It is located in the center of Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, surrounded by various shops and attractions, which is very suitable for shopping and sightseeing.

The front desk staff are welcoming. When I checked in, I was upgraded to a suite for free, which made me look forward to my upcoming stay. However, while the room overall looks great, there are some glaring issues.

First of all, the sound insulation effect of the room is not good, especially the sound insulation at the door gap. Secondly, although the bedding is comfortable and provides a good sleeping experience, the bathroom is a bit old. The paint on the edge of the bathtub was obviously peeling off and it looked a bit worn. Additionally, the bathroom had sticky hooks and screws in certain places, giving the impression that it wasn't properly maintained.

On the night of the 20th, I discovered that the hotel did not provide turndown service. It is hoped that the hotel can improve in this area and provide more comprehensive room services to enhance guests' stay experience.

For breakfast, the hotel provides a wide range of choices. However, the service quality needs to be improved. During breakfast on the 20th, a hair was found in the porridge at the noodle stall. I immediately told the noodle stall chef, but he just fished out the hair and took no other measures. During breakfast the next day, the waiter was cleaning the nearby countertop and accidentally flew the rag over my child's head and passed it to another waiter. This behavior was obviously inappropriate.

There are many shopping malls nearby. There are newly renovated rooms (deluxe rooms). I heard that check-in at the Conrad next door will take a long time, so I chose this hotel.

Hygiene: There are no sanitary blind spots. The cleaning lady is enthusiastic and smiling, and almost no dirty things are seen. The towels are also new and have date tags.

Facilities: The room is equipped with 4 bottles of mineral water, tea bags of five kinds of tea, mini bar charge, towels and bathtubs are very clean, the hair dryer is also very powerful, the bath water is very hot and the pressure is strong, I don‚Äôt know how it is without breakfast, it is considered Everything you need.

Service: I have to praise this point. InterContinental‚Äôs service has always been great. We arrived at the hotel at 12 o‚Äôclock because I wanted a high floor, but they could arrange check-in for me immediately on a lower floor. I agreed. It didn‚Äôt even need 2 o‚Äôclock during the exhibition. Check in later which is great! The concierge also answered all your questions and the service attitude was really good!

msg:Full marks must be given üíØ The location is excellent, the room is upgraded to a 50-square-meter suite for free, it is quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle, and the service staff are warm and comfortable!
I originally booked 3 hotels in Shanghai. In addition to Crown, I also booked Zhujiajiao and Disney. Later I found that the location was too convenient and the stay was too comfortable! I canceled directly with the other two hotels and stayed at Crown for another 2 days!
The staff are very enthusiastic [loving]. I especially want to praise the cleaning staff on the 10th floor. They are very warm and enthusiastic. The room is cleaned cleanly, the clothes are folded neatly, the take-out bags are cleaned in time, and the items and drinking water are replaced in time. A complete home away from home!
The location is extremely advantageous. Downstairs is the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street and People's Square, adjacent to the New World and World Trade Plaza, two large shopping malls, where you can eat, drink and have fun! When children are tired from playing, come back and rest in time
Other companies wish they could triple the price during the 11th National Day holiday. They only slightly adjusted the room price by RMB 100. The ordinary suite we originally booked was directly upgraded to the highest-end modern suite! Thanks to the handsome guy wearing glasses at the front desk! ! Really profitable!
I will always lock this place in my mind when I come to Shanghai from now on.

msg:It was my first time to stay at Nan Xinya Hotel at No. 700 Jiujiang Road, Shanghai. Let me share my most regretful and unforgettable stay experience.
I got married on October 14th. Since there was no place to stay in the wedding hotel, I checked in at Nan Xinya Hotel, which is relatively close to the wedding banquet. I prepared a wedding room. I bought a three-day and two-night package on Ctrip for a total of 1,999 yuan on the 13th. Check in, check out on the 15th. After purchasing, I confirmed the room type with the staff of Nan Xinya Hotel on WeChat and told me that the reservation had been successfully made for me. I went to Nan Xinya Hotel to check in at around 4 pm on the 13th. At the same time, I told the front desk of the hotel that I would be getting married tomorrow, so I would put on makeup. How do I get up when the stylist or photographer comes? Note: I already revealed that I was the bride when checking in (when their leader called me later, he said they didn‚Äôt know that the person checking in was the bride???)
Since I have been very tired recently and I hope to get married beautifully the next day, I made an eye mask on the night of the 13th. Since I was doing the eye mask while lying on the bed, a little bit of the remaining liquid in the eye mask packaging bag leaked out and fell on the The sheets were on the sheets, so around 6:30 the next morning, I called the front desk and asked the cleaning lady to help change the sheets. Note that from this time on, the hotel began to harass me endlessly.
When the cleaning lady entered my room, the first thing she saw was the layout of my new house. She asked me if I had used glue. I said that I just used balloons and absorbent plastic happy words, which were visible to the naked eye and no glue was needed. , Auntie said nothing. Later, I was asked if the sheets were changed. I also told the cleaning lady in detail that my eye mask liquid fell on the sheets and left a mark. I hope they can be changed. The cleaning lady borrowed the custom of their hometown and said, on the wedding day It is best not to change the sheets and quilt covers. If they are dirty, you can help me turn the dirty areas over. I listened to their suggestions and directly changed the direction of the quilt covers without changing the quilt covers. The cleaning lady asked me for wedding candy before leaving, and I gave Okay, the cleaning lady left my room
At 9:18 am, the first call came from Cassie, the morning lobby manager of Nan Xinya Hotel, saying that I soiled their sheets and the cleaning fee was 300 yuan. I was very busy doing makeup and preparing for the wedding, so I was in a good mood. , ended the call with a good attitude.
The next moment to witness the miracle, at 11:06, I was busy (as everyone knows, both the bride and groom themselves and the important relatives around them will be very busy on the wedding day). Nan Xinya Hotel called again, but I didn‚Äôt answer. When I arrived, the hotel actually called three times in a row! ! ! I saw the third call, but I hung up because I was too busy. I think any hotel with a little bit of human touch would not call you continuously on this day! At 1:21 pm on the 14th, the hotel once again called me. The cleaning fee increased from 300 yuan to 500 yuan. It was really ridiculous. My mood this day has been harassed by the hotel from early morning to afternoon. , the good mood was almost gone, but I still explained to the hotel in a good tone, first of all, I am getting married today, and secondly, the stains on the sheets are easy to clean and can be wiped off with a cleaning wipe. You don‚Äôt have to do this. They have been harassing me about this all day. Just as the hotel said they would no longer harass me, another call came at 2:45. Nan Xinya Hotel is really the funniest and most inhumane hotel I have stayed in for more than 30 years. The hotel has zero human touch. Being harassed by them also disturbed my good mood for getting married. Before I left, they just told me that they were really sorry and they would choose to stay at Nan Xinya Hotel next time to give you a better experience. Excellent service. Would you dare to come to this kind of hotel next time?

I booked the hotel this time but the foreign guest fell ill temporarily because of the acclimatization and did not come to Shanghai. After negotiating with the hotel, the reservation can be kept. , we came over to check in after recovering, and the hotel upgraded us to a suite for free. We were very touched. In addition, the swimming pool is a favorite among children, and the water quality is very good!

msg:Let‚Äôs talk about the bad points first:
1. The young lady at the front desk was not familiar with hotel rooms. She told me that they upgraded to a modern business hotel on the 9th floor. The room could see Nanjing Road. I was originally happy, but when I got to the room, I found that the window faced the hotel swimming pool, and Nanjing Road was completely visible. No, so I went to the front desk to ask again, and she said I could only stay in the room I originally booked. In fact, it was okay to stay in the room type I originally booked, but the hotel staff was so unskilled and kept tossing me back and forth, which made me unhappy.
2. Bugs were found twice in the bathroom. Big black bugs. Did they come from the sewer?

Good things:
1. Breakfast is quite rich
2. I was given a late check-out.
3. The location is convenient, not far from the subway station and next to the shopping mall.
4. I didn‚Äôt feel noisy and slept pretty well.
5. The price increase during the National Day is not outrageous
6. Bonus points for having a swimming pool

I will consider staying in Shanghai next time, but I hope the front desk will be more familiar with the room.

Full marks go to the front desk and concierge. Their service attitude is perfect. Very polite and willing to help customers.

Points will be deducted for the breakfast restaurant
1. The chefs there are not friendly. Customers are reluctant to answer questions or orders. I have to look at their faces early in the morning, and any good mood will be gone.

2. I asked a young chef whether bacon was beef or pork. His answer was: Bacon must be pork and cannot be anything else. I told him bacon could also be beef. His answer is that bacon must only be pork. That attitude is simply speechless. For this young chef, bacon contains beef. If you have no knowledge or common sense in this area, you must not be so resolute in denying something that is beyond your knowledge. Study with an open mind! If you can‚Äôt Google, I‚Äôll check it for you~ Xiaohongshu also has a lot of information in this regard!

3. The waiter who left me speechless. My table was cleared as soon as I left my seat to get my food. There is still food on my table! The most outrageous thing this morning was that I went to get yogurt from the buffet very close to my table, and when I turned around they were clearing my drink and cutlery. As soon as they saw me, they immediately put it back. Not even a word of apology. Had breakfast there for five days and this happened three days. I think restaurant managers should provide training. Teach your employees that when this happens, at least say sorry or sorry to the customer. Instead of treating it as nothing

Downtown, but very quiet at night! The front desk directly upgraded the room to a huge bed, I think the width is two and a half meters! The whole family didn't feel crowded.

Thanks to Du Yutian at the front desk for his enthusiasm and professionalism.

I didn't eat at the restaurant below the hotel, but the queue was very long, so it should be good.

Before seven o'clock in the morning, you might as well walk on Nanjing East Road to go to the Bund. There was almost no one on the road. When we arrived at the entrance of the Peace Hotel, there was only one waiter standing quietly. Shanghai at this moment belongs to you, hahahahaha. See picture.

Post a picture of Shanghai housing prices in 2023. Who can answer whether the houses worth hundreds of millions are for people to live in, or are they used for some other magical purpose?

The front desk helped arrange a twin room, and I contacted them to choose a twin room when my baby was older. The room is clean and tidy overall. The space in the parent-child room is okay. It is very close and convenient to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street and the Bund. It is suitable for traveling and living. The breakfast is also rich and the service is very friendly.

msg:Lunch buffet for two persons the next day: The lunch buffet did not seem to be worthy of the hotel's level. There were some minor issues from taste to freshness.

Hygiene: Satisfactory


Service: Like it. The front desk gave me room 708 at first. What I didn't expect was that there was a fan under the window sill, and the sound was loud and affected my sleep. After feedback to the front desk, we were moved to the 19th floor. The attitude in dealing with problems is very good. So those staying in the back should be careful not to take rooms on the left and right sides of 708. Another point is that the gym swimming pool is on the 7th floor, and the disinfectant water in the swimming pool has a strong smell.

After leaving the hotel, I also received a follow-up visit. It was a very comfortable stay. The hotel is convenient to go everywhere. The room can see the Oriental Pearl Tower and other three-piece suites. Nanjing Road, People's Square and Xintiandi are very convenient. Highly recommended~Thank you starry for your follow-up visit, it‚Äôs great!

I recommend this older Holiday Inn in Shanghai, but the service is not lagging behind at all.

This time, when I checked in yesterday, I was greeted by a short man at the front desk. Originally, I had booked an open-plan suite on a high floor, and the room fee had been paid in full at the time of booking. This man lied to me. He said that the room on the high floor I booked was being cleaned. I believed it and moved to the 18th floor as he said. He also said that the room on the 18th floor was bigger. But when I went to the 18th floor, I saw that the room was higher than the room on the 18th floor. The open-plan suite was much smaller. After my strong protest, I was assigned a high-floor room that I had stayed in twice before. When I went to the room, there was no sign that it had been cleaned at all. I wanted to ask the person at the front desk who received me a question. Short man, why are you so clever? Where is your professional ethics when you lie to customers? Please pay attention to this matter! Effectively protect the rights and interests of our regular customers who stay frequently!

msg:I brought my mother here to play and booked a deluxe suite for four days. The front desk upgraded it to a modern deluxe suite. The decoration was very new and it was very comfortable to stay.
There are minor flaws in the facilities. There is no barrier-free passage at the main entrance of the hotel. I have to carry my suitcase up the stairs myself. Fortunately, the staff will help me when I see it. In addition, the hot and cold water connections in the bathtub and sink in the room I stayed in were reversed.
The breakfast is very good, with a complete range of hot and cold dishes, Chinese and Western desserts and fruits. Most of them are delicious, but the small wontons are too ordinary.
In fact, the hygiene is a bit flawed. When I checked in on the first day, I found an obvious hair (not hair) on the quilt. Before checking in, I read reviews about finding cockroaches, but I didn't find any during my four-day stay. Overall, it should be fine.
The attitude of the staff I encountered was very good.

The only downside is that the room is newly renovated and smells like new decoration. The ventilation is not very good and there is only one small window. I have to sleep with the window open. In the middle of the night, I heard the sound of motorcycles or sports cars bombing the street downstairs. I was woken up twice and lost sleep.

The bustling Nanjing Pedestrian Street is just outside the door, and all depar**ent stores and shopping centers can be reached within 5 minutes on foot. It takes about 3 minutes to walk to the People's Square Station of the subway. Metro Line 1 goes directly to Shanghai Station. When you have less luggage, you can save a lot of taxi fares. When leaving the store, Mr. Xue Xiaodong from the concierge at the gate was very proactive in helping to carry the luggage to the car, thank you very much. The hotel is cost-effective and worth recommending. The only suggestion is that in the spacious front lobby, there should be more sofa chairs waiting for the formalities, so that passengers have a place to rest and wait. I hope that when I check in again next time, I can see that this only fly in the oin**ent has been improved. Come on!

msg:This hotel experience can be said to be the worst, because I stayed in more than 20 hotels along the way and never encountered such an outrageous one. First, I drove to the hotel entrance and prepared to check in. It was raining that day and was very polite. After negotiating with the security guard, we first parked in the temporary parking space to check in and then drove into the parking lot. The security guard asked the car to park at the front intersection because the leader would not allow it. As a result, I took my child into the lobby to check in despite the moderate rain. , I checked into room 1819 for the first time. After I swiped my key card to open the door, there were guest belongings on the bed. The cleaning staff told me that someone was staying in the room and I could not check out until the 21st. I went downstairs and communicated with the lobby staff to change my room to room 1608. After opening the door, there was a distance from the opposite building. Very close, the air conditioning equipment on the roof is too noisy, you can hear it clearly even with the windows closed. I went downstairs and communicated with the lobby staff again, and changed to room 2420. During this period, I kept walking around with my luggage, starting from about 4 o'clock. I kept changing rooms at the hotel, and finally checked into room 2420. The air conditioner was always 20 degrees from 5 pm to 9 pm, and the temperature did not increase even after 4 hours at the maximum wind speed. After the maintenance staff patiently repaired it, it was recommended to apply for an electric heater from the hotel for heating. After turning on the heater, the room temperature increased greatly. Maybe there is a big difference between northerners and southerners. Northerners are more afraid of the cold. The air conditioner can be improved, but the equipment is too old and can never heat up. What comes out of the air conditioner outlet is basically cold. It was so cold that I didn‚Äôt dare to go to the ground under the quilt. This experience is truly unforgettable. Dear friends, if you are not a nostalgic person, you should not consider this hotel. The facilities are old and the only advantage of the hotel is that it is very close to Shimao and the pedestrian street. , convenient for travel, but has no other advantages. Friends who want to book a hotel in Shanghai should choose carefully.

msg:The check-in experience was extremely poor, not to mention that the power socket in the room was not working properly and I couldn't charge my phone. After checking in, I was asked by the front desk to pay a 300 deposit for the contents of the refrigerator. I have stayed in so many hotels, large and small, and this rule was unheard of and unbelievable to me. Although I personally have a habit of not leaving the contents of the refrigerator when I stay in a hotel (even if it is free), this kind of request is absolutely intolerable. This is treating the guests as thieves. After I refused, the front desk announced that the staff would enter the room and lock the refrigerator. What‚Äôs really embarrassing is that more than an hour after the first employee locked the refrigerator, another employee knocked on the door and came to ask if the refrigerator was locked. The reason was that it was not clear whether the previous employee had locked it after the shift was over. I said, shouldn't this kind of information be communicated directly between employees during shift change? Or if you are not sure, just call and ask, or can you come over to ask the customer again? This weird corporate culture that distrusts guests from top to bottom and treats them like thieves is really a show. This hotel has done a great job, don‚Äôt do it again!

It is strictly stipulated that the hotel must park for eight hours before the hotel can help pay 40 yuan. The rest has to be paid by yourself. Parking in Shanghai is so expensive. As we all know, the wash basin in the hotel was clogged and the repairs came in the middle of the night. This hotel is not recommended near the Bund in Shanghai.

Environment: The location is good, relatively close to the subway entrance. There are many business districts around, making it convenient to go shopping and eat.
Cleanliness: The guest rooms are clean and the bath products are from Borghese.
Facilities: I live on the 15th floor. The facilities are relatively old but relatively easy to use. The sound insulation is poor, you can hear people talking next to you clearly at night. Also, the hotel is designed to be circular and hollow, and the corridors are not too wide, so people who are afraid of heights should not stay here. The child crying downstairs can be heard throughout the building...
There is only one sofa in the check-in hall... there is no place for the elderly to rest after checking out.

Parking is difficult: there are only dozens of parking spaces in the hotel on the 20th floor, and they are open to the public. I parked and waited in line for half an hour.
Parking is expensive: 15 yuan per hour, and parking is not free when you check in.
It takes ten minutes to go up and down the stairs: there are only four elevators on the 20th floor, and the restaurant and accommodation are shared. It takes ten minutes to go up and down the elevator for meals.
The room is hot: It has been very hot in Shanghai these two days, and the room is even hotter. The temperature feels in the twenties, and the air conditioner does not provide cooling.
The room stinks: The bathroom smells like sewerage and it won't go away. I held my nose while I slept all night.
There is no public restroom: after checking out, you want to go to the bathroom to change your baby's diaper. Sorry, all the bathrooms are locked for you, so you find a corner to change your baby in embarrassment.
Poor service attitude: push each other when asking for something, you look for him and he looks for you
To sum up: a very bad stay experience! ! !

It was only a hundred meters away by subway. The beautiful lady at the front desk, Jia Jia, also helped us upgrade to a suite. After staying here for four days, I still have a lot to enjoy. I will come again next time. My little daughter especially likes the breakfast room.

msg:It was quite difficult to book a hotel for this trip to Shanghai, because many hotels had too many bad reviews, including holidays. Later, I decided to choose the InterContinental Hotel based on the price-performance ratio. Of course, I was uneasy after reading a lot of bad reviews. I asked about the extra bed by phone. service!
Let's talk about the feeling at the beginning of the stay. The convenience of the geographical location is needless to say. Check-in was fast, thoughtful and polite, and the room was arranged according to the remarks I made.
It is understandable that the room is small in the core bustling road where every inch of land is expensive. Although the decoration is old-fashioned, it is still very luxurious, and it is much more considerate than Express and Mou. The room glass is very soundproof.
The short-haired cleaning lady on the 21st floor is particularly commendable. She is very enthusiastic, considerate and thoughtful. The uncle who cleans the corridor also greets guests politely. These are the daily management of the five-star Intercontinental Hotel. The waiter who enters the elevator and carries the extra bed will remind us to be careful not to be scratched, like +1.
Before, I noticed that some people said that the floor drain in the bathroom was slow, but my room did not have this problem.
Check out, a man on the first floor is also professional, thoughtful and polite. It takes less than 2 minutes to complete the formalities and the deposit will be credited in seconds. In addition, I also want to recommend the Xinya Cantonese Restaurant downstairs and the delicacies in the takeaway window. There are many local uncles and aunts queuing up to buy them. We bought a few before we left. The taste is amazing.
We can't just say that there are advantages and no disadvantages, but the sound insulation of the room is really poor. If your neighbor has a noisy child or the kind who goes to bed late and gets up early, it may be a bit uncomfortable.
It's too close to the Bund, saving a lot of time

Hygiene: Very clean. There are no hairs on the carpets and bathroom floor tiles, let alone the bed.

Environment: Relatively quiet, you may hear voices when someone passes by.

Service: Very friendly and patient. Check in was a bit slow.

It was the first time I encountered such a front desk, and it was so humble for me to check in. There were no seats in the lobby, so we had to stand and wait. The child was too tired and sat on the floor. I communicated with other staff, and he gave me three drink coupons. Although it was just water in disposable cups, I finally had a place to sit.
After checking in, one of the lights in the room was broken and the bathtub was also broken. The lights were repaired, but the bathtub was not.
A very bad experience. In addition to the good location of the hotel, the service is really disappointing!

1. The facilities are very poor. The room arranged is upstairs on the air-conditioning station. Basically, you need Suxiao Jiuxin Pills for a whole night. 2 Before the dispute was resolved, a girl ran away at the front desk. The pre-authorization was deducted without any signing. 3 .No one took the initiative to call back and tell me that money would be deducted throughout the process.
Summary: Those who want to enjoy the old decoration style of the 1980s and deduct money at will can choose this hotel to experience the entire process of angry and arrogant service. How to practice a bigger heart can be exercised here! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

The hotel facilities are very modern and well maintained. The rooms are spacious, clean and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable and I had a great night and quality sleep. The room also had a large TV and free Wi-Fi which made my stay even more convenient.

The service at the hotel is amazing, special thanks to Starry, the front desk supervisor. She was very warm and friendly when I checked in, provided detailed hotel information, and introduced me to tourist attractions and transportation information in the area. Her professionalism and attentive service attitude are unforgettable. No matter what questions or needs I had, she always graciously offered help and advice.

The location of the hotel is superior and the transportation is convenient. There are some shopping malls and restaurants nearby, allowing me to easily explore the culture and cuisine of the surrounding area.

All in all, Crowne Plaza Shanghai Nanxinya is an unforgettable good hotel. Here, I had a great time and enjoyed excellent service, especially thanks to Starry, the hotel's front desk supervisor, for his enthusiasm and professionalism! I highly recommend this hotel to those planning to come to Shanghai for travel or business trip.

Go directly to the front desk to ask if there are any vacancies, and then the young lady at the front desk arranged for us a newly renovated room with a good environment. Xiao Chen and Xiao Zou at the front desk are very attentive!
The room is very clean, the bedding is very comfortable, the sound insulation is good, and the air is good even though the windows are closed.
Finally, it is very convenient to take luggage, and the concierge Xiaoyao is very considerate.
It is the hotel that I will choose to stay in next time!

I feel that the decoration of other rooms is slowly being updated. This is great. Don't waste such a good location. There are quite a lot of local employees in Shanghai, and the service standards are also comfortable. Hope it gets better and better. Because ihg diamond members are booked through a third party, they are not given any membership benefits. I don‚Äôt quite understand this either hahahaha.

It is recommended to add a wash basin in the bathroom, especially in the parent-child room. With two adults and children, it will be a bit crowded in the morning and evening.
Health: Not bad.
Environment: The main scent of the hotel is pretty good, there are many foreigners, and the location is very good. The back door faces the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, which is very convenient for eating and shopping. There are several subway stations within 50 meters of the surrounding area, making transportation extremely convenient.
Service: The hotel staff are very good. The lady at the front desk and room service is very enthusiastic and impressed me deeply. When we left, the man at the concierge was very friendly and took the initiative to call a car for us to take us to the airport.

The only unpleasant thing: I wanted a bottle of water when I checked out, but the male waiter at the front desk said no, so I asked the restaurant selling cakes in the back to ask for it. It‚Äôs even more impossible to provide free mineral water there, which is quite funny , Even a small hotel will always have mineral water for guests at the front desk, and even warmly bring several bottles to them. This move seemed stingy for such a big hotel, so when I left, I could only leave eagerly.

Overall, it's good. It's a relatively comfortable stay experience. The satisfaction is mainly due to the hotel environment

Thanks to their assistance we were able to stay with both families so that we felt comfortable and happy during our two days stay at the hotel.

msg:Stayed in two rooms for three days and had a poor experience. There is a computer room outside the room, and the noise is huge, so the front desk adjusted two rooms. When I went back to pick up my luggage, I met an older local waitress checking the items in the room. She actually asked the guest in person if she had taken the Oreos from the two rooms? We were clearly told that we were just changing rooms, and our suitcases had not been opened, nor did we have time to open any drawers or cabinets in the room. Even if the things were placed on the table, we didn't even bother to take them, but she was still there, and when she saw me I was looking for the person in charge, but then I changed my tone and explained that my colleague forgot to put Oreos away. I was really speechless. How could such a waiter be trained? I have stayed in countless hotels, and this room attendant is the worst!
In addition, I would like to praise the two beauties at the front desk. One of them, a young intern, worked hard to help us change rooms!

After many twists and turns, we learned that of course the hotel had no heating or air conditioning. The outdoor temperature in Shanghai that day was 10 degrees. If there is no basic accommodation guarantee for customers, how can we talk about anything else? The requirements of our consumers are actually very simple, that is, a hot bath and a comfortable bed to sleep on. But you can't get that at this hotel.

msg:This is the first time I booked this hotel for an overseas customer. The location is good. It is right on the pedestrian street. It is only a few minutes' walk away from Exit 14 of the People's Square subway. The hotel lobby is clean and tidy. A staff member named Sherry Huang greeted me warmly as soon as I entered the door. I asked if the guest could check in early after a long flight. She immediately asked me to provide reservation information, communicated and coordinated with the internal staff, and fed back the results to me in a timely manner. While waiting, staff members came up to me from time to time and asked me if I needed help. Then I checked in, which was very standard. Afterwards, I asked the customers specifically about their stay experience and it is worth recommending!

As for the shortcomings, the only one is that parking is inconvenient. The underground garage is very small and is full during peak hours (starting in the evening). Vehicles queue up on Guangxi North Road to wait for free spaces before entering. This is very painful. There is also parking that is not free (it is 15 yuan per hour, and it is capped at 8 hours every 24 hours. When the parking fee reaches 120 yuan, you can get a coupon for 40 yuan when staying at the hotel. Once you go out in the middle, you will be charged again if you enter again. )

Compared with the previous time when I booked a hotel through the InterContinental APP and asked for a payment guarantee, it took less than a month for the refund, which was very inconvenient. Fortunately, I added an on-duty manager on WeChat, who kept in touch during the period, and finally got a refund. Overall, this hotel is still very recommended, the location is excellent, and the service meets the five-star standard. Recommended

Highly recommend staying at this store! The location is very convenient. Although it is in the downtown area, it is very quiet to sleep! The room is also big!

I called the front desk to ask if the mineral water bottle was lost. The front desk replied to help me and asked me to return the next day. There was no reply from the room. When I checked out, I asked again. The result was the same again. Ask for me. When I asked, I replied that I hadn‚Äôt seen it, and told me that I hadn‚Äôt. Then where is my makeup remover? Well, it was originally a small matter, but it made me angry. If you said that you can lose it if you are not careful or careless, I will not say it. Phone call, two days since I came back, and there is no message.
What does the hotel management do? No one handles complaints? Do you only know that guests pay but don't know how to pay attention to the loss of guests' belongings? In the future, the loss of valuables will be dealt with in the same way. Who would dare to stay in your hotel.
Is the level of management of InterContinental Hotel a little off your brand, or is InterContinental not paying attention to the reputation of your brand?
Are the executives of the hotel indifferent to handling the problem in this way? Or it doesn't matter if business is too good

There is a fat man at the front desk, the service is too bad, he just ignores the customers and rolls his eyes. You speak Shanghai dialect, but you are more enthusiastic, and you speak Mandarin, and you ignore him. They are all Chinese. You come to work and make a lot of customers stand together and watch. You make a phone call, do you know how to work? Arrange for guests to check in first. When you see guests getting together, there are other front desk receptionists. You have to be laid off with a sense of front desk service. It is your glorious tradition to eat breakfast. You can have lunch. It‚Äôs easier to talk about things. The hollowed-out design is too scary. I‚Äôm afraid of heights. Every time I enter and leave the hotel, I avoid using Feng Shui. I‚Äôm particularly dissatisfied.

msg:Since cockroaches are a public health problem and spread viruses widely, the government departments monitor the health situation every year.
Holiday Inn continues to have "non-isolated incidents"; that is, the problem has not been solved even after changing the room once. The first time, there were 8 cockroaches on the lower floor of the suite, flying around. The second time, there were 2 cockroaches on the upper floor of the suite, crawling around on the ceiling. It has affected no less than 30 guests in a year.
The on-duty hotel manager responded immediately to the relevant complaints. After the first room change, unfortunately, the problem was not solved.
A few days later, I complained to Trip.com. The hotel manager ************************ called me and did not admit the relevant accusations. After some communication, the hotel later compensated me 500 yuan because they did not want me to make the incident public. I immediately refused.
The hotel manager replied to me that no matter how I complained, the government department would be "***". It implied and explicitly stated that there was an agreement between the hotel executives and the government.
Today, trip.com replied that the relevant hotel still had a bad attitude and went back on its word without any handling or compensation.
I have officially complained to the relevant department today at 010-63281315. According to the Consumer Protection Law of the People's Republic of China, the service provided by the hotel is not in line with the rights of consumers, so I demand a refund.
The advice given by the relevant department is that in addition to compensation, a refund is definitely possible!
At the same time, I also complained to the Shanghai Health Hotline. Looking through the customer comments on trip.com, there is reason to believe that the hotel has not improved its hygiene conditions for more than a year and has a bad attitude.
I hereby appeal to all guests that according to the Consumer Protection Law of the People's Republic of China, no one can override the government and make unreasonable responses.
Secondly, why is the purpose of the 500 yuan to cover up the incident? Why did the hotel go back on its word and not deal with it?
The hotel authorities, including the management, should explain in writing the whole story of the incident.

Breakfast was not included when checking in, but there are many restaurants and restaurants nearby, so there are many choices, and it is first-class to go around at night.
There was only a double bed when I booked the room. I was staying with two middle-aged children. On the day of check-in, the waiter said that the room was full so I could not change the room. I had to add an extra bed at Shenghui 238. It would be better if I could book the hotel earlier. The overall feeling is still good, after all, it is a star~~

The check-in has been upgraded, but the layout of the house is hard to describe. I don‚Äôt know how I can fall asleep. Maybe the front desk is kind, but shouldn‚Äôt this kind of Feng Shui listing be treated as a problem room? The meal is also hard to describe, you can eat it, the salad vegetables are limp, and the rice noodles are so unpalatable! Especially the mirror in the bathroom is very weird. There is a mirror for the bathtub and the countertop, and they are compared with each other. As a result, when standing in front of the sink, you can see the opposite side ‚ôæÔ∏è yourself...

The location is okay, the surrounding area is considered convenient, but I really don't recommend it at this price! It‚Äôs better to live in Yuyuan Mercure, Huazhu‚Äôs economical model, which is still very warm and bright, at least there is a little love and a small degree, at least you don‚Äôt have to go downstairs to pick up meals!

3. It is also convenient to take the subway to Sinan Road, Wukang Road, the First National Congress Site, Yu Garden, and Chenghuang Temple during the day. A taxi costs about 20-35 yuan, and you can walk to Nanjing Road and the Bund at night;
4. The hotel, Pudong Airport, and Hongqiao Airport are on Line 2, and the hotel is in the middle of the two airports, which is really convenient.

msg:The hotel is located on Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street. The location is very good. It is an old five-star hotel. The lobby is not too big. It is not as magnificent as imagined. The modern business hotel room I booked is very new because of the new decoration. The bedding is very clean. Practical, the small episode was on the first day of check-in, I took a shower and washed half, and found that there was no shampoo, called the front desk, and it took 10 minutes to deliver it. As a five-star hotel, this kind of carelessness really shouldn't be. The service is average. Breakfast Fair, both Chinese and Western. The five-star hotel has a relatively high overall price-performance ratio and is worth recommending.

msg:1280 per night on non-weekends and holidays, isn‚Äôt it high? The service is only RMB 580, which is not as good as the RMB 580 in the whole season for the same period. There are only four or five chairs in the lobby, which are still at the very back. After waiting for a long time to get the room card, there is no place to sit. If you want to sit, you can only go to the restaurant on the first floor for a fee. If you don‚Äôt consume, you won‚Äôt be given a seat. The room bag is actually made of paper, not canvas. You are calculating like an express hotel. Why is the price only two or three hundred lower than the Marriott? There is no view of Shanghai buildings, just the wall outside the window. I booked three rooms for an initial price of NT$4,000, which made the boss very unhappy. If I don't give a bad review, I'd like to apologize for NT$4,000. The interior decoration and breakfast are okay

msg:On a business trip with my colleagues, I chose this hotel near the client's company. Apart from the convenient location, I can't say anything else. We arrived at the hotel around 5 pm on the day we checked in. The front desk told me that the three rooms were not ready yet and it would take about 1 hour, and there was no apology. The lobby is full of people from various tour groups, in a mess. The room felt like it was decorated decades ago, and the air conditioner didn't work very well. It's the worst Crowne Plaza hotel I've ever stayed in, and I probably won't go there again. In addition, I checked out on March 21st, and today is the 27th, and the check-in deposit has not been refunded.

msg:The hotel is located in the heart of the Magic City and the facilities are quite old. This is understandable, but the service is too great. There are several reception areas at the front desk. There are only two counters for check-in and the elevators upstairs are standard. It is a bit confusing for a foreigner like me who often comes to Shanghai. The waiters always have a kind of superior self-confidence. The weirdest thing is that I, a countryman who drives here, parked my car in the hotel parking lot and was told the next day that the five-star hotel owned by Intercontinental does not provide free parking for hotel guests because of that. The parking lot has been contracted out and charges several hundred according to the charging standard. It really made me gain knowledge. I suggest you guys not to drive when you go to this hotel.

The first time was because the front desk offered the wrong room type, and the second time was because the room sanitation was not done well, and the garden sanitation was messy. I didn't check in until after 3 o'clock. The service is not as good as that of low-end chain hotels, and the management level is obviously too poor! My yard is full of rubbish, the table is full of soot, and the sofa cushions are all over the floor. I seriously doubt how this hotel is rated as a 5-star hotel?

msg:When I checked in, the front desk kept emphasizing to me that the air conditioner was turned on to provide hot air, and the cold air was not provided. Don't turn on the air conditioner, and the windows cannot be opened. I wondered how hot the weather in March could be, so I shouldn't need it. I didn't understand the purpose of the front desk's constant reminders. Unexpectedly, it was a room facing south (on the side of Jiujiang Road) that was really hot. There was no air conditioner, and the windows could not be opened. This kind of accommodation was simply masochistic. Just before our luggage was settled, a huge cockroach swaggered out and walked on the carpet, scaring the child into tears. I didn't care about anything else, so I hurriedly called the guest room, but no matter whether it was the front desk, the concierge, or other No. 1 store calls, none of them could get through, and the phone was useless. I went downstairs with my luggage and my child, and showed the photos taken by the front desk. The front desk should have experienced a lot of battles, so I said lightly to change the room... a person who seemed to be in charge stood behind me and said sorry to us. , and opened up a children's room, saying it was an upgrade. After entering the new room, the first thing is that the temperature has dropped. It is at least 10 degrees lower than the previous room (on the side of Nanjing Road). The facilities are the same as the previous house. The only difference is that there is a pig on the bedding and an extra one on the ground. Tents in the way, and nowhere to walk. In fact, I am quite concerned about this kind of thing. It has been placed on the carpet in the room, and those who bring children may crawl and scratch. I will never let my children touch it. Let's talk about the shower area. The water keeps overflowing. Taking a bath is like flooding a golden mountain. Walking is very dangerous, and touching the bathtub is a flaw. In short, in order to be closer to the Bund and avoid walking, you can ask for a room facing the direction of the room, otherwise it is really unnecessary.
