msg:My flight was cancelled and I was forced to stay over in Beijing for the night.

Hotel staff went for rhe extra mile and upgraded me to a bigger room and provided me with essential oils when I feedbacked about the adour in my previous room. The room was clean and spacious, facing Jingshan park view, its too bad I couldnt stay longer for the amazing view. The hotel staff was so attentive, very patient and very eager to help, she made me feel like a queen üòÅ

Spa garden was therapeutic and calming, I wish I could spend more time there.

Lounge was a sexy area, I suggest to go at night time. Cocktail there was average.

Gym was small, not comprehensive for an active person like me.

I tried both their frenchcuisine Rive Gauche and the chinese  cuisine Fu Chun ju. Services and staff were impeccable and polite. But if I can only choose one, its the chinese cuisine, their roasted pigeon was AMAZING!

I visited Jingshan Park whic only 5 mins aw.

9/10 FOR THIS EXPERIENCE!

The rooms was exactly like the photos.  .  . beautiful.
Breakfast was extrodinary and service level was high.

My trip was postpone since April and finally was able to make the journey to Beijing in July.
The trip arrangements very easy as Jason (super star) was very attentive to all  of our needs and meticulous to follow up with us 
on restaurant reservations, how our stay was going, anything he can do and offering assistance in all possible ways. Six Star service.
I also want to give recognition to Ashley as she had great energy and enthusiasm when explaining the neighborhood and history.

Looking forward to staying at the Puli in Shanghai and other hotels in this group in the coming years.

Big thumbs up.

You can walk to Wangfujing Street, Tiananmen Square, Dongsi Hutong, and Lama Temple. Secondly, the overall service of the hotel is very meticulous and thoughtful. From the moment we got off the car, the concierge service guy was very careful to help us with our luggage, and every one of the ladies at the front desk served with a smile, making us feel at home. Then, the hotel's night bed service should be praised. When we returned to the room every night, the bed was re-made very flat, and small gifts for the Dragon Boat Festival were placed thoughtfully, with different small sachets every day. Every meticulous service made us feel very good. It is the best hotel experience among the hotels we have stayed in. When we left, we also said that we would stay at the PuXuan next time we came to Beijing. It was a very good experience.

msg:Puxuan has been in my hotel collection for a long time. This time I came to Beijing to watch the Mayday concert and I decisively chose to stay here. As expected, I was not disappointed! It's worth it! When I checked in on the first day, I was upgraded to a suite and told that the drinks in the hotel's small refrigerator were free. I was very happy, but it was not because of these that impressed me. What impressed me was the full details and services of this hotel! For example, every night when making the bed, a calming sachet will be placed on the bed with a small card, and the card will tell you what the weather temperature will be tomorrow. For example, the mobile phone charging cables placed randomly will be sorted out for you with storage ropes. For example, the fruit plates and drinks will be replenished for you every day. For example, the light sticks I watched at the concert will be charged because they are placed on the ground, and a towel will be laid for you. And the daily cleaning is also very clean and will tidy up your things neatly, and will not be sloppy just because you stay for a long time. Whether it is cleaning or the front desk, the service of the hotel staff can be said to be very considerate. We had to catch an early flight on the last day of our check-out, so when we returned to the room the night before, we asked the front desk what time we would leave so that we would not encounter traffic jams and would not delay our flight. We did not think that we would have time for breakfast, but unexpectedly, the front desk said that they could pack breakfast for us in advance so that we could take it with us when we checked out! They also asked us in detail what drinks we needed to prepare for us, whether we had any specific food, and the check-out time the next morning, etc., and they would prepare breakfast for us in advance before checking out. After returning to the room, they called us again to confirm the breakfast dishes. When we checked out the next day, the hotel staff gave us the breakfast that had been prepared early, and unexpectedly found that there were two oranges in each portion. It turned out! Just because I casually mentioned that the oranges in the hotel were so sweet the night before! I was really moved! Although we had to get up very early to catch the flight, these services of the hotel made us feel very happy! In short, the stay experience at the Puxuan this time was really great! It was completely worth its room rate! I will choose here when I come to Beijing in the future! The Puxuan Hotel is also worth recommending! I must give a big praise to my full attention to details!

msg:The super pleasant stay of five days and four nights has come to an end, and I am actually a little reluctant to leave. When I checked out, I went to the front desk to thank the aunt who helped me clean the room every day. Thank her for cleaning our room every day as tidy as when I first checked in; thank her for carefully tying up my messy data cables with straps every time; thank her for remembering my habits and thoughtfully placing toothpaste next to my toothbrush; thank her for finding a storage box and quietly putting away the jewelry I threw around (I was shocked when I returned to the room). Although there are mixed reviews about puxuan online, it can definitely get 95 points here. Under these touching details, the "upper and lower" furniture in the room, the Loewe TV, and the paintings of Cai Guoqiang in the lobby are just foils! I like it and will visit the Beijing store again

The bath products do not match the hotel's standards, and the overall fragrance is incompatible with the overall fragrance environment provided by the hotel.

Facilities: I didn't go to the gym, but I had a meal at the Chinese restaurant on the 3rd floor. The decoration is quite design-oriented, and the black pearl one diamond is also remarkable.

Environment: The environment is really good. It was originally an art gallery. You can walk to the Red Building and Shenwu Gate of Peking University, a very classic city walk route~

When booking the room, I noted that I hoped to book a room with no noise from the glass. The staff called to confirm the request the day before check-in. At the same time, the hotel arranged accommodation when I arrived at 10 o'clock in the morning that day, which was very efficient. There was indeed no abnormal noise in the following two days.
The design, display and furnishings of the hotel are very good. The public space has a very strong artistic a**osphere. When the sun shines down, the courtyard in the middle of the fifth floor is very beautiful.
The overall tone of the hotel is wood-based. When booking a room, I hesitated between the Opposite House and the PuXuan. Facts have proved that I don't regret booking the PuXuan at all.

msg:I haven‚Äôt commented for a long time. Thank you Puxuan for inspiring my desire to express myself.
1. The blue slippers in Picture 1 and Picture 2 are provided by Puxuan. They feel the same as stepping on the floor with bare feet. They are very light and thin, and the soles are as thick as stockings.
I went to a spa for 400 yuan, and the slippers they gave me were better than what this hotel, which cost more than 2,000 yuan, gave me.
2. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt take the initiative to provide combs, but you can remind guests when they check in that they have to call and wait for you to deliver anything they need? ?
3. I stayed on the south side. At seven o'clock in the morning, there was a crackling noise from the window. Friends, you can't sleep anymore. This is my first time seeing such a scene, but the hotel staff knew about it, so why didn‚Äôt you tell me when you checked in? ? Will the windows start crackling at seven in the morning? ?
4. The sensor light in the cloakroom does not light up.
5. The four pillows on the bed are all extremely soft. This is my fault, I could have asked for a hard pillow, but every time I had to call and wait for it to be delivered, so I improvised and reminded my friends to try the pillow first.
6. There is a 15% service fee in the lobby bar. I sat and drank a cup of coffee by myself, and it was actually charged 15% service fee. Your breakfast service is very good. I'm happy to charge 15%. What kind of service does the lobby bar have~~~
7. When you are seated for breakfast, you will be asked which room you have after you are seated. The breakfast room is very small and the waiter will repeat your room number loudly. Everyone in the breakfast room will know where you live. Although no one will come to see you, the guest Where is the privacy of

With regard to pricing and positioning, have you thought clearly about what type of customers you serve? Why don't you go to Rosewood and Park Hyatt to learn more? Not only the price has gone up, but the other ones are too annoyingüåû

Breakfast is good, praise it
Bacon is only hard, not soft

What surprised me was that the breakfast was different from other hotels. The ordering mode has both Chinese and Western food, and it is one of the top 3 hotel breakfasts I have ever had. It can be seen that the person in charge of the hotel is dedicated to serving customers. I would like to especially praise Archey and Frank. They proactively asked me about the hotel service from the time I checked in to the hotel, including later. Are you satisfied? Generally speaking, it is a very good hotel that I have stayed in in Beijing so far. Whether it is a business trip or a family trip, I will recommend this hotel to everyone around me and give it a five-star rating!

The hotel has a good environment. The only drawback is that the lighting is dim. You have to transfer to the elevator because the lobby is not on the first floor.

There is less space to put things on the sink, and there is no place to put clothes, etc. in the bathroom.

The service is great. The room cleaning and turndown services are very meticulous, and some details are taken into consideration, such as providing alcohol pads for glasses, putting hot water bottles, etc. The concierge at the front desk is also very efficient and polite.

Two big and two small
When traveling during the Spring Festival, the hotel's response and service capabilities can be seen even more when the rooms are full.
I am a person who has very high living requirements, so I chose Puxuan as the main name to fit the feeling of Beijing. I think the location of the hotel is very good. Just downstairs is the subway station. It's not far from Wangfujing but it's not as noisy as Wangfujing. The hotel room will put a hot water bag on the bed for you every day so that when you return to the hotel, the bed will be warm. This detail is great. It is a hotel that fits this price range. I am very satisfied with the hotel's breakfast. It is a semi-buffet breakfast. The food is served very quickly. There are many varieties and the taste is good. It is worth trying. The decoration style of the hotel is very tasteful. The lobby bar and study room are very quiet and neither noisy nor noisy. You can enjoy a cup of tea quietly and relax yourself. The hotel knew that I had children with me and was very considerate in preparing children's supplies for us. I gave the hotel full marks for its service.
But I think there are negative points for certain equipment in the hotel. First of all, I think the TV is too small. For a room of this size, the TV is very small. The water in the hotel shower room was not drained in time when I took a shower for the first time. Water situation, but it will get better after a while. In the past, I could see and feel it. Of course, I can‚Äôt speak for everyone, but I will still choose Puxuan again.

The hotel service staff are also very friendly and courteous. They also provide hot water bottles and sachets that can be taken away at night. I like it very much. Breakfast is semi-buffet style. If I have to make some comments, it is that there are not many choices for main meals. The dishes in the buffet area are also limited and could be more varied!

Personally, I feel at home from the moment I welcome guests, to breakfast, guest rooms, teahouses, front desk, and all the services are satisfactory.

The taste of catering does need to be improved, but I actually tasted the Sixi roasted bran from my hometown, which was quite familiar.

Finally, I would like to thank the receptionist who I met several times yesterday, the girl who introduced the tea sets to me at Tea House, the gentleman who took photos for me, and Archey and Tiff. Thank you.

The most noteworthy thing is the very detailed hotel services (ancient and humane hot water bottles, sachets that are changed daily, and postcards of different street scenes in Beijing...) The staff in every position make eye contact. There will always be enthusiastic responses, which is really great! The original plan was to stay for two days and then switch to another hotel to experience, but it turned out that I couldn‚Äôt bear to leave Beijing and stayed here for the entire trip. I highly recommend it to all my friends who come to Beijing~

As soon as you arrive at the door, someone will greet you politely and kindly and help you with your luggage. I really appreciate it. The service in a five-star hotel is like that of a suite. The hotel's spa is the best in Asia. The masseurs are also very experienced and every acupuncture point is in place! Because the weather in Beijing is cold, a hot water bottle is provided to warm the quilt every night. The waiter still puts some disinfectant wipes on my computer. Fresh fruits and fresh flowers are delivered to the room every night! The breakfast in the room is also delicious. If you are looking for a tasteful hotel, you must come to Puxuan Hotel. It really made me experience a five-star hotel! All the furniture is made from top-notch Shang and Xia brands. It‚Äôs a very tasteful hotel! I really like it so much, I will come again next time! ‚ô•Ô∏è

msg:Designed by famous designers, it is very artistic. The exterior facade and interior decoration are very high-end. The scenery is also good. The window faces the National Art Museum of China. The price is as good as the hotel. The service is also very good.
However, the overly personalized design also has many shortcomings in use. For example, the main entrance is too hidden, and there are several paths that seem to be walkable but there is no path at the end.
The elevator arrival warning light is beautiful but very weak and easy to miss. You need to change the elevator from the first floor to the guest room, and you also need to change to go to the restaurant.
Unconventional lighting switches, I don‚Äôt know which one controls which lights, and I can‚Äôt always turn them off completely. It‚Äôs very nerve-wracking to leave a trace of light on when sleeping.
When you turn on the shower head, water always comes from the top instead of the wall.
It's nice to have two basins on the washbasin, but there is too little countertop for placing personal items.
The breakfast is rich and delicious. The only drawback is that the coffee in a five-star hotel is not professional and the milk froth is not good. You should find a different barista.
Overall, it's beautiful but a bit unrealistic.

Second: I stayed at J Hotel in Shanghai before. Both it and The Puxuan are hotels under the Leading World Group. I had a good experience that time and the service was very attentive. Thirdly, it‚Äôs also because its premium rooms have Mason Margiela themed rooms, which we like. Although I checked in a bit late, I happened to meet Manager Han, the duty manager whom I had called before. The service attitude is really good and the layout is great. Such an excellent hotel will be my first choice when I come to Beijing again.

Due to uneven thermal expansion and contraction between the steel window and the glass, there will be sound, and this sound is 24 hours a day, which makes it difficult to sleep, and it is said that all rooms will have the same problem, which really makes people sleepless all night. Sleep, the solution given is to give you ear plugs, or give you a bottle of red wine. Spending 3,000 yuan to live in such a room is really miserable.

Disadvantages: The only disadvantage is parking. There is no free parking lot in the hotel. You need to park in the art center behind. Although the parking lot has a direct elevator to the hotel, it is 6 yuan for an hour at night and 15 yuan for an hour during the day. It is really right. Customers are very unfriendly, hope this can be improved.

The classic super king room I stayed in this time is warm and comfortable. The design of the free minibar perfectly meets the needs of the guests. The Loewe TV in the room is worth 200,000.

I called the hotel in advance and told them they would prepare a cake. I didn't see it delivered that night, so I called the front desk and said they would arrange it. After waiting all night, the child fell asleep and was not delivered. Huge disappoin**ent. The room lights are so dark. The breakfast quality is poor and cannot be compared with ordinary well-known five-star hotels. Very bad experience.

The hotel's environment and service are also very good. Because we noticed that there were children staying, we added guardrails to our beds. The minibar and welcome fruits are replenished every day, which is very considerate. The only downside is that the bed in the room is relatively small. We stayed in a room facing the north. There is no view outside the window, and it is very close to the opposite building. Usually, the blackout cloth is pulled up. Generally speaking, I am quite satisfied, and I will choose the hotel next time I come to Beijing.

msg:As expected of a designer hotel, the overall design style is elegant and modern, with Chinese-style stability but not old-fashioned. The lobby bar is very beautiful. A transparent courtyard is located in the center, which takes care of the lighting and is picturesque.
The room is bright and bright with a wide view. When booking, it was noted that the orientation of the art gallery is required, and the hotel also meets this demand. The choice of furniture and lamps in the room is stylish and a**ospheric, and there is also a very Zen-like flower arrangement in the room, which is a great surprise to me.
The bed sheets are smooth and comfortable, and the spare parts are Yuebishi's white tea flavor, which is fresh and fragrant. The mini bar is free to use, ranging from milk to beer. Before, I was worried about my child not drinking bedtime milk for several days and I didn‚Äôt know where to buy it. The small details of Puxuan solved my problem. When the room was cleaned and replenished the next day, even the child‚Äôs slippers were replenished. Although one pair was enough, such thoughtful details moved the mother who was traveling with her baby a little.
The location of the hotel is touching, adjacent to Wusi Street, not far from Dongsi, walk along the nearby Beiheyan Street, and you can also go to Nanbeichizi Street, which may be my favorite tree-lined trail and alley area. As the starting point of the alley tour in Beijing, PuXuan has a unique location. The Red House of Peking University and Dongjing Yuanjing Mountain are within walking distance, and it is not a problem for older children to walk to the Forbidden City.
Children are picky eaters, the hotel has its own Cantonese restaurant. Originally, I didn‚Äôt expect too much Cantonese cuisine in the capital, but Fuchunju still impresses me. The roasted pigeon is impressive, and the scallion oil noodle kids can eat two servings. The southern boy who doesn't eat anything, his performance proves everything.
Tiff and Maggie were very patient when we checked out. They helped us call a car, and helped me take my luggage from the lobby on the fourth floor to the downstairs. I chatted with Tiff about the design and furniture of the hotel, as well as the artwork in the lobby. She Rushu Jiazhen answered clearly, which is really great.
I want to travel to Beijing next time, and Puxuan will be my first choice. Many friends will bring their children to travel to Beijing during the holidays. I can‚Äôt help but make Amway for themüòÑ

Apart from the location, the exterior design of the hotel, and the warmth left by the staff who turned down the hotel, it is really hard to be satisfied with anything else.
When entering, the doorman didn't ask where to go, nor did he give any directions. Went upstairs to the front desk and saw that the guests were complaining to the front desk, but it was not resolved quickly. The front desk did not inform the breakfast location. The quality of the hotel's toothbrushes was also very poor. It felt like it would break if I used force. It has been half a day since leaving the hotel.

There was also a SPA, but the schedule was too tight and I didn't have time to go. The interior design is great, the whole hotel smells like bergamot, and the staff are very friendly. The semi-buffet breakfast is rich and fresh. I especially want to praise Ashley Tiff and Maggie, who are friendly and generous. They sent a luggage tag. They are very handsome and I like this hotel very much.

       After getting out of bed, the soft quilt is covered with a warm and small sachet; after tidying up the room, extra mirror cleaning alcohol paper is left beside the glasses; seriously feedback the children's suggestions for the lighting system; these kinds of details are touching.
       PuXuan is located almost in the center of Beijing, at the end of Wangfujing Pedestrian Street. What you can‚Äôt miss is the Peking Opera at the Jixiang Theater. The National Art Museum across the street is constantly exhibiting new ones. If you get up early, you can walk through two traffic lights and try to take a picture of the corner tower of the Forbidden City that has not changed for hundreds of years... The convenient transportation is very suitable for travelers in a hurry.

msg:When I was in Shanghai, I liked Shanghai Puli very much. In addition to the good memories of the dinner on the left bank terrace, I specially reserved a day for this trip to Beijing. I can only say that the design of the hotel is beautiful and the stay experience It is indeed not as good as Beijing Park Hyatt, but it can only be said to be average. If the hotel hadn‚Äôt changed me to a small suite for free after the problem happened, I‚Äôm afraid I might have to write a bad review again. I can only say that the more I hope, the more disappointed I will be.

I booked the basic room one week in advance. My favorite is not the Jingshan view of the Forbidden City, but the view room of the National Art Museum of China. Later, the lady at the front desk said that the view of the art museum is actually a basic room, but the occupancy rate of the hotel is high. This room type The rooms are all full, so I can only live in the most common basic room, opposite to the view of the Overseas Chinese Building.

There was a problem when I first checked in. The structure of this room is that there are tables, chairs, and beds behind the TV. There is a harsh knocking sound from the glass windows near the road. The hotel explained that it was caused by the strong wind in Beijing. I cannot accept this reason , spend more than 2,000 yuan to listen to the noise, I might as well live in the quiet Jiji, plus I was in Park Hyatt Beijing the day before, and the floor height absolutely surpassed Puxuan, the room was so quiet, how do you ask me to accept this reason. In the end, the other party said that it is possible to change the room, but does it mean that the glass windows of the room will not make a sound? Off the spectrum? Is it possible that Beijing Puxuan is a wind chime structure? Will it ring when the wind blows? Finally, at my strong request, I took me to see a suite on the same floor. There was still abnormal noise from the glass window in the living room. Fortunately, there is a door to separate it from the bedroom, so that at least the door can be closed at night to isolate some noise. It's going to be a sleepless night.

Objectively speaking, if it wasn‚Äôt for the damn glass window problem, PuXuan‚Äôs staying experience is still good, the mini bar is free, the subway station is just outside the hotel, and the National Art Museum of China is across the road, so it‚Äôs very convenient to travel. The room is also designed in a new Chinese style that I like, coupled with Loewe TV and Herm√®s upper and lower furniture, the configuration is absolutely top-notch. When you turn down at night, there is a handwritten weather forecast postcard for the next day, as well as a hot water bottle and an aromatherapy bag. These small details are still very considerate and extra points. In the end, I closed the door connecting the living room and the bedroom at night, and I still slept well, which is a blessing in misfortune.

The breakfast on the second day was purchased by myself for more than 300 yuan. Frankly speaking, it is not bad, but compared with Beijing Park Hyatt and Beijing Eclat, 1. The variety is not as rich as the other two. 2. The taste is not as good as the other two. The price/performance ratio is generally not too special, but it is not unpalatable. It is not recommended to buy it alone.

The hotel does not have a swimming pool, but the public area on the 4th floor is very beautiful. Like Shanghai Puli, there is a quiet and comfortable study room, where guests can work quietly and take a rest. Pushing open one of the doors leads to the outdoor bamboo forest and water living space. Sometimes I feel very comfortable sitting here quietly and doing nothing.

Finally, I would like to give a suggestion: the view of the Puxuan Forbidden City in Beijing is actually not right. You can only see a little bit of the Forbidden City‚Äôs roof from a distance. , so there is a door that can separate the noise from the glass window, so think carefully before deciding.

Later, I learned that she was the representative of the owner. The elegant and extraordinary temperament made the children who study art yearn for it; the designer skillfully used light and shadow lines , Every quiet place is a landscape, the borrowed scenery behind the porch window, the star light in front of the elevator door, the ingenious use of room space, the red maple in the atrium and the light at night, there is a sense of experience that has not been to Kyoto; The Chinese afternoon tea on the fourth floor needs to be reserved in advance.

The moving lines of the room are smooth and the overall design is beautiful.
There are some nitpicking points: the trash can is too small, the toothbrush is too hard, the hair dryer is a bit difficult to hold, and the TV stand cannot be raised and lowered, which will block the overall view~
When we left, brother Andy from the housekeeping depar**ent took the initiative to provide us with gift bags and felt very warm~
The location is very good, it is very convenient to go everywhere, but there is no breakfast shop in old Beijing nearby, probably because it is too close to the Forbidden City~
Overall, it was a great experience, worth experiencing, and fully relieved the fatigue of the previous day's journey~
It's a pity that Guardian didn't launch and didn't have time to make a SPA~
Come again next time~

I didn't find the front desk to pursue it. The next day I reported this problem, but the hotel didn't say anything during the process. The hotel management hygiene problem caused me a bad experience. As a five-star hotel, this price , the service is the same as that of ordinary hotels, and the emergency plan is not perfect. For such a well-designed hotel, there should be a lot of room for management improvement!

msg:Located at No. 1 Wangfujing Street, the PuXuan is in the same spirit as the Guardian Art Center. The PuXuan overlooks the Forbidden City and Jingshan. It undoubtedly enjoys the reputation of the best hotel in Beijing. However, the elegant pedigree of "urban Taoyuan" makes PuXuan uniquely hidden in the city beyond the hustle and bustle of the city, and therefore stands out among the luxury hotels in the imperial capital. The name "Pu Xuan" embodies the simplicity and sincerity of pure jade and the luxury of sacrificing to heaven, and its spiritual temperament is vivid in the architectural outline of Ole Scheren and in the polishing of MQ studio's interior. The interpretation of - this is the Taoyuan philosophy of the URC brand, and what makes PuXuan fascinating. As a lover of Leading World Group, I have been following PuXuan, a proud LHW dynamic, so this is a long-awaited Staycation.
I informed the hotel in advance that I was here to celebrate my birthday, so from the time of check-in, the hotel prepared accordingly, gave small gifts such as aromatherapy and luggage tags, and told me to reserve a room with the best view in the same room type. After learning that I prefer a corner room, Maggie from the Guest Relations Depar**ent took the initiative to communicate, upgraded my room type for free, and accompanied me throughout the tour and room change. There are flowers, balloons, welcome letters, etc. prepared in advance in the room. My favorite is the birthday card drawn by Maggie, which is very cute. I would like to express my sincere thanks here. In addition, a delicate birthday cake and welcome fruit were presented, which tasted very good.
The corner room has a lot of space and is very comfortable to live in. The facilities of the room are of course nothing to say, and all kinds of furniture are almost the top match. It's a bit of a pity that the hair dryer wasn't the Dyson expected - of course, the pursuit is not bad.
A good hotel will polish the details, such as the personalized welcome message on the TV, the surname of the guest when calling the front desk... The most impressive thing is that when the bed is turned down, flowers and weather forecast cards are placed on the bed. The used tableware is washed and placed next to the fruit plate, so that guests can feel the humanity and warmth.
I like the architecture and interior design of the hotel very much. Especially the hollowed-out courtyard dotted with bamboo forests, maple trees, stone paths and clear springs, against the backdrop of the glass reflecting the blue sky, gives people a sense of coziness and self-compassion of celebrities returning to their paradise. Putting a set of afternoon tea in the lobby bar, chatting leisurely with friends, it is very comfortable.
Zuoan's breakfast is semi-buffet style, and the level of West Point is great, but the Chinese dim sum is slightly insufficient. You can choose to eat on the terrace, you can see the art gallery and the scenery of Jingshan in the distance. Good experience on a sunny day.
In short, PuXuan's style and service experience make it one of the best "treasures" in Beijing in my mind, and it is very worth recommending to friends.

The distant view does not have the open feeling of big rivers, big lakes and big rivers. You might as well choose the urban landscape for the same apar**ent type. In fact, I think the Opposite House of 70 square meters is about 2500 yuan better than the PuXuan luxury suite with more than 3000 square meters. We recommend the 70-square-meter queen-size bed in The Opposite House. Of course, PuXuan has a superior geographical location, but the parking route designed by foreigners is not flattering. You must be an old driver and drive carefully. If I rent a car, I will be rubbed off, and I have to compensate for the cost of repainting. Pu Xuan is not a must-visit hotel.

After I got used to the elegant environment of Puxuan, I suddenly became business-oriented, but I was not used to it, so I hurriedly moved back to Puxuan.
Advantages: Generally speaking, the location of the hotel is convenient, quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle, and you can go to the Forbidden City and other places by bicycle leisurely. I like to feel the strong Beijing a**osphere near the hotel. The hotel is relatively new. Although the room is small, it has all the internal organs, especially the smart toilet is very useful, and the minibar is replenished in time every day. In addition, the hotel's shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel are super easy to use. I came back from the Forbidden City that day and sweated profusely. After washing my hair, my hair was never softer than many big-name shampoos. If you can buy it, you must Will repurchase.
Disadvantages: I received a phone call on both check-ins and asked whether to continue the next day, once even after 11 o'clock in the evening

msg:Location: Opposite to the National Art Museum of China, one stop away from Nanluoguxiang and Shichahai, and downstairs from the hotel is the National Art Museum of China subway station.
Hotel environment: There are not many rooms in the hotel, the design is great, suitable for couples, the petty bourgeoisie must choose the hotel, the room design is very good, the layout is reasonable, you can see the Forbidden City and Jingshan from a distance
The main point of praise is the hotel service. The service of the staff in this hotel is really good. From the bellman at the door, the receptionist, to the room attendant, they are all enthusiastic and responsive. Compared with JW and Ritz Carlton in the east, As well as Park Hyatt, I think it is worth recommending. The room includes minibar and snacks. I think these details are worth learning from other high-star brand hotels. There are not many kinds of food for breakfast, but the quality is good. Don't buy semi-finished fried dough sticks and shrimp dumplings. You will be more divided if you make them yourself. Next time you go to Beijing, you will choose Pu Xuan

msg:Advantages: 1. The transportation is convenient, quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle, although it is small, it has a future. The rooms are simply furnished but stylish. 2. As a five-star hotel, most of the staff are well-trained, solve customers' problems in a timely manner, and provide customers with the most comfortable service, but at the same time give customers the sense of distance they need. I can tidy up the room when I turn the bed every day, keep the room tidy, and change the bedding. I like it very much for those who are a little bit clean. 3. The breakfast at Fuchun Residence and Zuoan Western Restaurant and the afternoon tea at the lobby bar are all good. If you don‚Äôt want to leave the hotel, you can basically meet three meals a day. Since they were sitting at the same table on both days, the usher in the restaurant directly asked if they were sitting at the same place on the third morning. The waiter too, remember my preference for hot water for breakfast, which is great. 4. The hotel is relatively new, the smart toilet is very useful, and the minibar is replenished in time every day, which is very good.
Areas that can be improved: 1. When doing hygiene every day, you can still use cleaning supplies to clean the sink, table and other places that may cause stains. For example, peel fruit on the coffee table and leave a few drops of juice on the table. Didn't see it, so didn't wipe it off, came back at night and turned on the light, and the few drops showed up. The sink is very white, but after use, some stains on the stainless steel are more obvious. However, relatively speaking, Pu Xuan's hygiene has been done very well. 2. How to use the lights can still be explained to the guests, because I have stayed in Pu Xuan's sister hotel, but there is no problem. There is also a curtain that automatically starts as soon as the door is opened, and the clicking sound after opening is too loud, which is really frightening. The waiter can remind you before checking in. The glass of the room may occasionally make a rattling sound when the weather changes, and you can also remind it. In addition, it is the design of the nozzle. The cuboid design is very individual, but the edges and corners are clear. Every time you take it off, it is very awkward. 3. The hotel service is very flexible and provides high-quality service according to the needs of the guests. However, the toothbrush is not fine-bristled, and it is difficult to squeeze out the skin cream, which is solved with a cotton swab. Also, do you provide different toiletries for different room types? The shower cap was a little better if it was delivered once. The other two may not be as good as the shower cap provided by the budget hotel. You can see the photos.
I like Pu Xuan very much, I hope she can continue to maintain high-quality catering and service, so that the guests who like her will miss her and come back to see her.

All of them parked at the entrance of the Art Center. It is very difficult to communicate every time. It is recommended that the hotel and the navigation agency relocate the exact location. . The service staff are relatively cold, especially the ladies, who are not warm, professional and attentive like the cultural oriental. The waiters who ordered the breakfast seemed to be sleeping. The order didn't arrive, and the order was delivered. It felt very chaotic, more than a day. The nucleic acid point is very close and convenient

The fly in the oin**ent is the room layout. In the case of a small room as a whole, a walk-in cloakroom was designed, which caused the bathroom to become L-shaped.

The privacy is very good, the location is quiet in the middle of the noise, and the sound insulation is also very good. You can't hear the sound from the road outside the hotel and the next room. The beauty of the hidden world is not too empty and boring, full of high-end sense; the welcome gift of check-in is very characteristic, it is the hotel's fragrance wood, with the essential oil prepared by yourself, and sara at the front desk also recommended the fragrance for me, and the service was very good. careful. The overall service of the hotel staff is very good and comprehensive üòå I ordered an outdoor afternoon tea. In the courtyard on the check floor, the view is very good. I heard that there are also 5th and 9th floors~

Disadvantages: 1. When I checked into the forward hotel, the person at the door watched me get out of the car, without any sense of helping with bags and welcoming... 2. The hotel does not have a swimming pool, and it is said that it is not allowed due to the structure and land use. It's a pity. But the overall flaws are not concealed.

A family I like very much, I will stay there when I have time for staycation, and have a good time shopping~

The interior design shows the new Chinese style very well. Bathrooms, toiletries, lamps, and tea are all very particular and have their own characteristics, and they are also very thoughtful.
When checking out, Daniel at the front desk was also very patient to answer relevant questions. But what I am most dissatisfied with is the other front desk staff.
The two ladies, one of whom had long hair and spoke very loudly, had been chatting in the afternoon. Among them, they used the phone during working hours to talk about family affairs, as if they were taking a leisurely job for the elderly, which greatly affected the public area of the store. Customers who take a break to read. At the same time, I received a customer consultation call, and I privately laughed at the other receptionist if the guest was sick. I don‚Äôt think this is the professionalism and professionalism that a five-star front desk should reflect. I don‚Äôt know if I booked your hotel. Are people likely to be discussed in private?
Another problem is that in Xiaohongshu, Zhou Yangqing mentioned that the feature here is that you can check out at any time, and the hotel's official Xiaohongshu number also interacted with Zhou Yangqing. But in fact, you must check out at 2 pm, I think this should be paid attention to.
I am satisfied with the hardware, but there is still a lot of room for improvement in service.

The PuXuan Hotel gave me the feeling that the more I stayed, the more like my own home, relaxed and reluctant to part. It is strongly recommended to stay here for a few more days to experience the meticulous and caring service of the hotel team.

üöó Transportation: It's convenient, and the geographical location of Wangfujing No. 1 naturally goes without saying. Across the road is a subway station and a quick nucleic acid test point, and next to the hotel is the National Art Museum of China.

üßπHygiene: I am obsessed with cleanliness, so I paid special attention to some hygiene corners. The hotel is done meticulously and perfectly. There is no ash üàö and a humidifier is provided on the initiative~

üçÉEnvironment: Be sure to let the staff take you around the hotel! Feel the integrity of the hotel's artistic style and the ingenuity of various details. Of course, it is also very suitable for taking pictures, and it should be very good.

üîîService: Sara is bravo! At the same time, all the service staff in the hotel are well-trained, warm and courteous. There is no need to ask for the turndown to open in time every day, and the minibar will be replenished many, many times every day. PS: The manager is very handsome :D

Summary: All in all, great value for money. The food and beverage allowance in the suite is also very practical! There are also laundry allowances and spa allowances... In general, the next time I return to Beijing, Puxuan is my first choice (unless I have to go to China World Trade Center to do business woohoo, or I will definitely live in Puxuan instead of stepping on it, I think the experience of Puxuan is better than that of Bulgari Fortunately, breakfast is a little stretched)

She is a very talented person. Every day, I can receive her small creative surprises. Whether it is a painting or a small gift, I carefully observe my preferences and then create them. After I slept well, I specially sent a lavender spray to help me go out and go back to the room. She also prepared hot tea to instantly dispel the cold from her body. Because I don‚Äôt know which dishes are delicious in the hotel restaurant, she always asks her to give me advice and arrange it.

msg:A very perfect experience. I chose Pu Xuan in many hotels in Beijing, hoping to propose marriage in front of Jingshan and the Forbidden City under the sunset. Tiff and Maggie helped me decorate the room very carefully, prepared flowers, photos and cakes. Tina at the front desk helped me arrange a room with a view. Finally, I was lucky to have a successful marriage proposal under the careful arrangement of the staff. It was a coincidence that I chose Pu Xuan, but everything was a special surprise. Every staff member was enthusiastic and responsible. I believe that I will choose Pu Xuan in important days in the future.

msg:Beijing, where every inch of land is so precious, is especially located at No. 1 Wangfujing, the core area of commercial art.

It can not only take in the magnificent scenery of the Forbidden City, but also feel the modern a**osphere of the modern city.

The five pairs of door piers at the entrance are based on the stone thresholds in front of the old Beijing Shenzhai compound. This is the principle of "home away from home".


As soon as you enter the concierge area, you will see a rice paper painting by artist Mr. Qiu Deshu
The mountains are high and the water is far away, the expression of Chinese-style landscapes and the care of nature
The bricks on this floor are actually the same gold bricks as the Forbidden City, can you believe it?
It's understated luxury

The lighting of the whole hotel is soft and no light source can be seen
This kind of meticulous attention to detail really makes people feel comfortable

When the elevator opens, there are two welcoming pines standing here. These are composed of building wreckage and metal fittings. Can you believe it? We usually don‚Äôt see the art works of Mr. Shi Jinsong, a famous contemporary independent artist in China. Can we guess? , one for Guardian and one for Pu Xuan

As trendy hotels become more and more powerful, measure the luxury of a hotel, not by hardware, but by your culture and artwork
And these artworks of The Puxuan Hotel are tailor-made by Guardian Culture in advance

Throughout the fourth-floor lobby, light-colored wooden floors and light-colored walls create a relaxed and comfortable environment. Add light and shadow to make the a**osphere of the whole space quiet and soft

Looking at Jingshan Park from this angle, it is really refreshing.

The PuXuan Hotel takes a step by step, and when you look up inadvertently, you will find a very meaningful space picture. The designer fully considered the external and internal lighting effects to create landscaping and enhance the a**osphere. ""

Pu Xuan, which mainly focuses on the concept of urban Taoyuan, is really like a secret place hidden in the market;

Walking into the hotel, I felt that I was instantly separated from the hustle and bustle of the outside world.

The quiet a**osphere of the hotel is relaxing.

On the left bank of the western restaurant on the 2nd floor of the hotel, there are many oil paintings from France. There are brass wine utensils, glass wine utensils, porcelain, knives and forks, etc. in the cabinet, like a small restaurant in Paris.

msg:Thank you for the welcome drink and cake prepared by the hotel~ I also gave me a lamb, I am super happy~
Location: In the Second Ring Road, very close to the National Art Museum of China and the Forbidden City. The art gallery is opposite the hotel, within walking distance, and there are also cafes and bookstores around, so you can stroll around at will. About 15 minutes by taxi to Sanlitun~
Room facilities: The minibar is very rich / the cups are complete; the brightness of the light can be adjusted and there is a lot of space. I like the design without the main light, and the brightness of the whole room at night is super warm, super bright and not dazzling.
Hotel service: everyone is very warm and enthusiastic.
As a traveler, the overall design of the hotel is very new Chinese style, with a (Forbidden City + modern) feeling, and the clean and neat design incorporates a lot of classical artistic conception.
Have the opportunity to experience again~

üöó Transportation: It is very convenient. It is less than 50 meters away from the Metro Art Museum Station. It can be reached on foot from the Jingshan Forbidden City and Wangfujing. It is the core of the core.

üßπSanitation: The room is very clean, but the outer glass is a little dirty, which makes the beautiful view outside the window a little blurry.

üîîService: The most satisfying part, I am very grateful to Tiff, Michelle and Maggie for their home-like service, as well as the specially prepared anniversary surprise, which makes people feel really warm, and it is worthy of being under the Leading Hotel Group.

Overall, it was a very satisfactory stay experience, and I will choose to stay again in the future.

The entrance of the hotel is not very friendly, you need to change the elevator to the front desk in the lobby.
The room layout is very good, the light switch design is very good, and it is more user-friendly than most hotels.
Children's toothbrush cups are best not to use glass or ceramics, which are fragile and hurt hands. (After breaking, my child was scratched)
It is better to solve the noise of thermal expansion and contraction of glass curtain wall.
Chinese restaurant dishes taste salty. The lobby bar closes too early. Breakfast is purely a staple.

üçÉEnvironment: The environment is also good, the products of the two restaurants are very good, especially when I went to eat in Zuoan before, I felt that the service was very good

üîîService: The most important thing is here! The core reason for staying at PuXuan twice is that the service is really good! ! The hotel will very seriously retain the opinions and suggestions of old customers, and will try its best to provide services according to customer preferences for customers who have stayed before. One of the best points of the hotel is that it can stay for 24 hours (check in and check out at a few points, I hope the hotel's excellent boats can be kept forever) Although the hotel is full during the festival, the hotel also tries its best to guarantee the guests' check-in time. . This stay was a little unpleasant due to some policy changes in the hotel. The room manager also came to apologize and gave a small gift. Drinking afternoon tea in the hotel also feels that the staff of the lobby are very good, warm and considerate. Compared with the coldness of the Chinese tea afternoon tea staff, I recommend everyone to come to the hotel lobby barüòâ
Although the overall service and details of the hotel are very good, it is still necessary to remind friends who have poor sleep to be a little more cautious. The hotel glass may have some noise in the morning due to thermal expansion and contraction. Although the hotel is repairing, it does not feel that the improvement effect is small. So be careful if you don't sleep well
Overall, Pu Xuan's service is really satisfactory. Although 2 stays have various little stories. But the staff will solve it properly. For their high-quality service, next time you want to rest alone, you will still choose Pu Xuan Da

msg:What is it like to stay in an art gallery?
 
When I stepped into the room, I started to regret it, why only booked for one night. Beijing PuXuan is a peaceful sojourn and will be a future destination.
 
Step into the hotel, enter your health information, and the gentleman in the concierge will hand you the luggage tag that was prepared earlier. All the way to the front desk of the lobby. The last time I saw the seamless connection between the concierge and the front desk was at Park Hyatt Shenzhen.
Think the front desk work ends on that workbench? Maggie at the front desk escorted us upstairs to settle down, introduce the facilities in detail, and choose the fragrance of the room. I have to praise Maggie's hand-painting is really cute!
The next day, I specifically asked Sara and Tina at the front desk for another luggage tag. After learning that they were leaving Beijing at night, they also sent two boxes of alcohol cotton. It turns out that it does work.
 
It's more like an art gallery than a hotel. In appearance, it is also unique among the hotels in Beijing. Not to mention the design of the atrium, so that the view from the corridor of the guest room can make people feel
 
fascinated. The waiting area on the first floor is also unique, and even the floor tiles on the trail in front of the hotel are so beautiful. The dim lighting in the room can be adjusted by yourself to suit various scenes and a**ospheres.
 
Soft drinks in the room are free and replenished once a day. In addition to the extremely ceremonial fragrance, there is no ambiguity in turning the night down. Drinking water will be refilled when turning the bedtime, and a warm water bag will be provided on special days! The quilts are warm! In addition, PuXuan actually provides professional shoe-shine and luggage cleaning services. I didn't see it until I checked out, and I said it was a loss.
 
Breakfast is only a la carte, a basket of all kinds of crispy bread, cold meat and cheese platters, jams, and salads are standard for each table. Laba also gave Laba porridge that day, which was the first time I had ever visited Laba. Hahahahaha. The breakfast made me feel the service experience of the French restaurant waiter. Especially the French toast is really good, the cinnamon is very fragrant. Cuttlefish croissant and omelette are also delicious.
 
There is one or two small episodes. I was in a hurry to catch a car on the first floor. After I finished talking to my partner, I didn‚Äôt wear a mask. The little brother in the concierge probably heard it and immediately handed us two masks.
 
Hotel staff were also seen using hooks to clear the rubbish from the cracks in the boards on the floor.

msg:The exterior design and interior design of the hotel are very good. After learning that we were here to register for the marriage, Jason Wang, the front desk manager of the hotel, specially helped us upgrade the room and arrange the decoration, and sent flowers and cakes. We were very happy. When we left, we forgot the Ipad again. Following the follow-up of the hotel manager Han, the Ipad was packed tightly and sent back to us according to our requirements. The standard of hotel service is very high. We are very satisfied. Although there are fewer types of breakfast due to the epidemic, it needs to be improved. Fuchunju on the 3rd floor is delicious. If you recommend this hotel, you must come and taste it.

msg:This time I stayed in several top-ranked luxury hotels in Beijing, Beijing Yihe Aman, Wangfujing Oriental Culture, and Beijing Bulgari Hotel. I feel that there is still a certain gap between Beijing Puxuan Hotel and them. For example, there is a girl at the gate. The reception and service attitude is good enough, and the tone is uncomfortable. The distance between the bed and the window is too small, and the hotel‚Äôs breakfast room is designed to be of high standard. We have to catch up with the hotel‚Äôs renovation this time and have to open a solo exhibition. This experience is not very satisfactory üòÇ

The breakfast room type and all kinds of cheese bread cold cuts are the top echelon of Chinese Western food. This meal starts at 400. To talk about suggestions, I suggest using the warm colors in my pictures for the room promotional pictures of Ctrip and other software, otherwise people think that this hotel has a cold personality. I think most people still like to be high-end and warm at the same time. Bright lights are warm colors, and there is no need to turn them into cool colors in publicity. Of course I don't mind using the pictures I took, the only drawback is that the aunt cleaned the room and didn't knock on the door. And I don‚Äôt think the comment area is an exception. You really need to pay attention to this. If you encounter a more serious case, you will directly file a lawsuit with you.
