msg:Absolutely enjoyed our stay at the Shanghai Edition. Having stayed in a few hotels in Shanghai, I think this has one of the best location as it‚Äôs situated right in the middle of Nanjing Road. The hotel and room designs are warm and sophisticated but not over the top. The room looks very new and is well maintained. 

The warm service we received during the stay was commendable. Mia was very helpful and we were able to contact her via WeChat during our stay for any help needed. Shoutout to one of the staff at the rooftop bar (didnt manage to get his name) for his amazing service and generosity during our visit too. 

Perhaps the only thing below expectation was the hotel breakfast. Recommend to book without breakfast and enjoy the good food around shanghai.

Would definitely want to return here again next time:)

There was no welcome drinks you would think on a hot summer day the front desk would offer water. There was no help going to the room and guide on Wi-Fi, the room, where the swimming pool and time for breakfast. The turn down service is lackluster nothing was really changed in the room. The front desk really need training on how to treat guest at a luxury level this is not a cheap hotel and thus guest pay extra money for the hotel to pay extra for attention to detail. Breakfast service was great and the selection was great.

Rooms are smaller than I expected, but stunningly decorated, and with beautiful views (although, it‚Äôs important to note that not all views are of the bund/Pudong skyline). 

Blanche showed me around the room and was so friendly and sweet. She helped me order room-service when I was in an online meeting and book an incredible table at the roof bar for afternoon tea. 

My room had a screeching noise, I think coming from the pipes, when I got back late at night. I called room service and they sent a workman and had the problem fixed within minutes. 

Room-service and mini-bar was of high standards! As was everything else in the hotel! Super trendy with cool tunes playing in all of the public areas, beautiful views and out of this world service! Blanche really did go above and beyond to make sure my stay was fantastic! 

Check-out was fast and Howard who helped at check-out made sure I got to my waiting taxi on time! 

All in all, incredible experience with superb facilities, views and service! Highly recommend!

Mia contacted us the day before we arrived and provided us with services. She was very considerate throughout the stay, making me and my family feel at home. Knowing that it was our first time in Shanghai, the room we prepared for us also had a view of the Oriental Pearl Tower. Winston, the housekeeping manager, took the initiative to put a lot of water in our room. Knowing that we liked the smell of the hotel, he also gave us an extra set of toiletries to take away.
It was my first time staying here, and the experience was very good. Thanks again to Mia Winston for the service and help she provided during our stay.
Customized LeLabo toiletries travel set: good smell and easy to use

On the day I checked in, he also greeted me at the hotel's drop-off point. I really felt the butler service. My questions and requests to him were always answered in the first time and implemented in place.
He was not there when I checked out, and he specifically asked Mia to prepare a small gift for me when I checked out. I am really grateful to Colin and Mia.
The Shanghai Edition Hotel is the best experience I have ever had in a hotel.

The hotel is in a great location, with a pedestrian street downstairs, and it is very convenient to get a taxi. It only takes one minute to walk to the small road next to it to get on the bus. There was always someone at the concierge to serve at the pick-up and drop-off point. I would like to especially thank Mia~ We arrived very late that day, and it was so heartwarming to see the small gifts prepared for the baby, and the handwritten cards. I was also very grateful to the room cleaning staff, who tidied up the room very carefully. It was a pleasant hotel experience!

msg:My parents were traveling for retirement, so I booked a hotel reservation for them through the Ctrip platform at the Shanghai EDITION. After the trip, my parents gave it a very high rating.
Especially my father, who wrote a handwritten speech of more than a thousand words on the return trip on the high-speed train, and asked me to post it on the platform for review. The following is what the old father said:
I was very happy and comfortable staying at the Shanghai EDITION. I felt three good things:
First, the hardware facilities are good. On the second day of my stay, the hotel upgraded me to room 2603 for free. The room area is nearly 170 square meters and has four relatively independent spaces. When I first entered the room, there was a small bathroom and a simple sofa, where I could easily change clothes and handle luggage. . The second independent space is the reception room, which has a long sofa and two single sofas, as well as a small conference table (equipped with eight chairs). The reception room can not only receive guests, but also hold small meetings. The third independent space is the master bedroom with a standard double bed, which is very comfortable. The fourth independent space is the washroom with a luxurious bathtub. Overall, the hardware is good.
Second, the surrounding environment is good. The hotel is facing the street on Nanjing East Road, opposite the New World Shopping Center, and close to Jiangxi Middle Road. It is also very close to the Huangpu River. It is very convenient for shopping, sightseeing and eating Shanghai snacks.
Room 2603, in particular, has a large balcony overlooking the Huangpu River and the Bund buildings. You can also overlook Pudong, the Oriental Pearl Tower, Shanghai Tower, and the Bund buildings. Standing on the balcony during the day, you can see the busy scene of boats passing by on the Huangpu River. Standing on the balcony at night, you can overlook thousands of lights in Pudong, especially the Oriental Pearl Tower, Shanghai Tower and other Shanghai landmarks, giving you the image of a prosperous metropolis. I can feel that this should be one of the best viewing rooms in Shanghai.
Third, the hotel service is good. After checking into the hotel, you can feel the warmth of attentive service. As soon as you enter the hotel, a waiter will guide you throughout the entire process, complete the check-in procedures and send you to your room. Every time you go out, a waiter will guide you to take a taxi. Along the way, there were some personalized service requests, such as water delivery, shopping bags, etc., and they were delivered quickly with just a phone call. In particular, three things happened during my stay that moved me very much. The first thing was that on the day I checked in, it was my birthday on the Gregorian calendar. The hotel arranged a warm little environment for birthday wishes and gave us free cakes and some fruits. We really felt at home. The second thing was that a small corner of the wood carving I brought was accidentally knocked off and required 501 glue. My wife called for help with the mentality of giving it a try. Unexpectedly, the waiter came up with an idea and delivered it quickly. The third incident was that I drank a few too many glasses of wine one night and accidentally soiled the bed sheets with my bare feet. After calling for help, the waiter changed them immediately.
All in all, I feel like the service has been very good these days. Next time I come to Shanghai, I will stay here again.
(Thanks to this hotel for allowing my parents to have a good experience at their first stop for retirement travel)

The hotel cooperates with lelabo, and both the toiletries and fragrances are from No. 29, which I really love! ! !

The hotel's service is also very thoughtful, from the placement of breakfast, hygiene to the attitude of the service staff, it is satisfactory.

The service is very good, the front desk, concierge, lobby, breakfast room, roof bar, including the cleaning aunt I met in the corridor, the overall level is online, thoughtful, polite and discerning. The breakfast is not very varied but of good quality. The food is served quickly and the coffee is good. The afternoon tea in the lobby is both beautiful and delicious online.

The only drawback is that there seems to be no more choices when booking a twin room, including size and view. The entrance is always bustling with people due to Qingming Festival‚ûïNanjing East Road, but it feels very safe. Generally speaking, it is impressive for an old house on the Bund.

msg:We arrived at the hotel at three in the afternoon and were notified at 5:49 that the cleaning was complete and that we could check in. Attended the dinner that day and didn't have time to prepare. It was not until nearly 5 o'clock that the alternative plan of resting in the small room was proposed (I had to pack my luggage twice to change rooms, and the bathroom in the small room was right outside the electric room and there were no curtains). As a result, I was stuck in traffic during the evening rush hour and ended up being late.

The fact that the rooms were full the day before is not an excuse. Your cleaning manpower should be able to cope with the situation of full rooms. The hotel has insufficient cleaning staff to reduce costs and the guests should not have to foot the bill. This ridiculous check-in delay was not the fault of the front desk staff who took responsibility for the apology, but the hotel management.

This time I tried the notorious Shanghai Edition purely because it was close to the event location. The style of the room is not my favorite. There is not too much design. To put it politely, it is called modern style. It can also be said that the room has only four walls.

As for Nanjing East Road, it is convenient, but every time I go out, there are huge crowds of people squeezing around, which is very uncomfortable. Parking is not allowed at the hotel gate, and it is quite a distance to the east gate.

The reception staff at the east gate of the hotel are very attentive. The pastries for breakfast are also good.

Shanghai hotels still recommend Ritz, Peninsula, The Middle House and Capella.

I have to say that this service is really good, five-star praise
1Ô∏è‚É£The view from the rooftop is very good, but when I went there the weather was bad and it was raining and very cold, so I only went out to take a photo.

3Ô∏è‚É£New Century Depar**ent Store is directly outside the breakfast. The location is nothing to say. It‚Äôs just a few hundred meters away from the Bund. It‚Äôs very convenient. It‚Äôs faster to go everywhere. From the hotel, it‚Äôs only 30 minutes away from Disneyland and 20 minutes away from the high-speed rail station.
4Ô∏è‚É£When I left, I was given a custom-made canvas bag and toiletry bag from the hotel. The black ones are very high-end. The hotel style is also this low-key luxury style. Overall, the experience is great. All things considered, it is highly recommended to come to Shanghai‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Of course, it's very convenient to just across the street from the subway station.
Room facilities and beds: The room is quite large. It has a simple but not minimalist design in wood color, which gives people the warmth of home and a sense of security. Especially the blanket on the bed, which is very casual but the finishing touch. The bed is moderately soft and firm, which I like, not too soft? The setting of the two sinks is also user-friendly.

breakfast:
The breakfast is actually the best I have ever stayed in, including Hotel J. Breakfast can be ranked among the top three in Shanghai hotels. The semi-buffet breakfast has both Chinese and Western styles, especially some Shanghai-style breakfasts. The fried dough sticks are crispy and the tofu curd is hot and dense. This is undoubtedly a comfort for foreigners who have just returned to China and have not yet returned home.
The lobby of the hotel is nice, but some dress codes are recommended. Seeing some greasy middle-aged men wearing slippers and lying on their backs using their mobile phones somewhat ruined the image of the hotel.
Overall value for money üâë, I will stay here again next time I come.

The front desk is warm, the breakfast is rich, and the beautiful housekeeper Senia considerately provides us with welcome fruits and afternoon tea. After returning from an evening trip, she also takes the initiative to provide fruits before leaving. We also prepared small gifts for the children! We had a dinner at the Waldorf Astoria in the middle. It felt like the space was much larger than that of the Edition, but the decoration, service, and the appearance of the hotel staff were much worse. Although the weather in Shanghai was very cold, it was still a three-day trip to the Edition. Let us feel warm in our hearts!

msg:The family chose this place in Shanghai during their trip back to China for the New Year;
Because of the location and transportation, my wife and children were very satisfied with this hotel and said they would stay here again next time they come to Shanghai.

The room was upgraded to a Bund River View room. Suddenly, our itinerary changed and we needed to stay an extra day. The whole arrangement and processing process was very smooth.
Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, the fruits and vegetables are very fresh, the semi-buffet dishes are all delicious, and the service is nice.

Thanks to Manager Senia for the careful arrangement, very nice! I once again gave my daughter her favorite fruits and chocolates, and she was very satisfied!
I like the short-haired waiter at the breakfast restaurant. He is very nice and the service is also very nice.
I also like the lady who cleans the 18th floor. She is very professional and nice!

Disadvantages: The sound insulation effect of the room is not good, and the space of the bathroom sink is relatively small. It cannot put too many personal items, making it inconvenient to use.

Overall, thank you Addison for a comfortable 4-night stay in Shanghai. I will choose it again next time I come.

My husband had a conference call and was advised to go to the edition space in the annex building. The environment was very business-like, and the guy at the bar thoughtfully turned down the music volume.
The only drawback: the hotel building is old and has poor soundproofing. A couple next door had a grudge that quarreled all night. I originally wanted to complain, but I thought it would be annoying to change rooms in the early morning, so I could only endure half-somnia until dawn. .

First of all, as a five-star hotel, the service was not as good as even the Samsung chain. There was no detail at all. I checked in at 7pm and was told that I couldn't stay in the first and last room because I arrived late and the check-in process was a bit slow. We told the man at the front desk to come back after dinner and the man at the front desk promised that the luggage would be delivered directly to the room. When we came back, we could just get the room card. ! When we came back from dinner at 10 o'clock in the evening, we were still receiving other guests and completely ignored us. Another young lady directly told us that there was only one room and it was the first room, and the luggage and everything else were still in the lobby! It was really unpleasant. I felt not taken seriously and had a very bad attitude. They even had a dispute with us and the male staff member didn't think there was anything wrong with him at all!
I got a reply from the man at the front desk: "If it doesn't work, the room can be canceled for you now!" That's right! You heard that right! 10 o'clock in the evening! Hey~~
Because it was too late and very tired, I had to make do with it! Sure enough, at 12:50 in the morning, the air conditioner suddenly made a loud noise from the ceiling at the door, so we called the maintenance man at night! The favorability has completely fallen to the bottom!
It wasn't until the next day that the problem was reported, the room was changed and the room type was upgraded, and I stayed for one night with peace of mind! So sum up experience, book a hotel, read reviews, don‚Äôt take chances! There are reasons for bad reviews! A hotel with poor service, no matter how expensive or luxurious it is, is useless! Because your future journey will be soured by the unpleasantness of the first day...

msg:The soundproofing of the room is so bad! ! The sound insulation effect of a room costing 2,500 per night may be worse than that of the Hanting next door. You can hear doors opening and closing, music, people saying "what are you doing" in the back room, and plastic bags. There is still a seam left in the blackout cloth that cannot be closed.

I stayed for two nights, and every morning the people in the room opposite got up at 6 or 8 o'clock and the sound of closing the door woke us up. On the first morning, I put up the Do Not Disturb sign, but at 8:30 the service staff knocked on my door frantically, and later found out that they knocked on the wrong door. The person in the back room played music at 12 o'clock the next night, and I could hear every lyric clearly, and I could also hear her voice.

There are so many hotels to choose from at this price in the Bund location, so I suggest you stay away from them. Even if the attitude of the staff is good, it cannot make up for the shortcomings of this hotel.

The hotel's complimentary fruits, chocolates and fashionable shopping bags were all delivered to the room if I wanted them. These can be ignored. However, the deposit received and the amount refunded did not match. The hotel told me that it was a problem with the backend system and would contact the finance depar**ent to follow up in a timely manner. The remaining deposit amount would be refunded on the 6th after check-in on the 4th. I don‚Äôt know what the problem was in the backend that has not been resolved for 5 days. What kind of intelligent system can make such a low-level mistake in finance? If the customer doesn't raise an objection, can he still get his money back? I would like to remind all guests to personally verify the refund of the deposit in the future. I am really convinced that such a small matter requires guests to worry about. Marriott's new generation luxury concept hotels do not live up to their reputation and the stay experience is very bad. It really affects Marriott‚Äôs appearance.

First of all, the location is good; the service staff were also very polite when we checked in because there were children traveling with us and they gave us an electronic graffiti drawing board. After checking in, the guest service center staff guided us to the room to introduce the facilities on the corresponding floor. Not long after we checked in, some gifts for the children were sent to the room. Thank you very much for the spare parts and welcome fruit desserts for children

Say it again, it's kind of sad

Just like other people have felt, the bathroom trash can is like a cheap one bought on Pinduoduo. It is very inconvenient anyway, and it is also embarrassing after throwing away toilet paper.

The design of the faucet on the bathroom basin is a bit twisted. Washing water splashes all over the body.

Starting at nine o'clock in the evening, I could hear strange noises from the ceiling of the room. At the first sound, I thought it was the sound of the guests upstairs tugging on the curtains. Then there were the second, third, and more sounds. It was really terrible.

The hotels I stayed in the last two times were not cheap, but because of the sound insulation problem, it affected my rest and I was speechless.

Fortunately, the taste of breakfast is nothing to say, it is remarkable.

msg:Because the Sanya Edition chose to stay in Shanghai, I can only say that Sanya was a complete winner. For such a big hotel, Shanghai, which has experienced the epidemic, did not borrow a temperature gun. When ordering breakfast, there are so many choices around so there is no need to invest in food, so it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have breakfast or not. The view from the rooftop is good, and one of the two rooms has been upgraded. The biggest advantage of the Edison is that the bed is big, the toiletries are good, the lobby has a scent, the room does not, the ventilation is poor and stuffy, and the toilet does not smell. Overall, I feel that the price is a bit not worth it. It may be the Chinese New Year, so I don‚Äôt know what the price is usually.

From the beginning of check-in, he showed us the room and explained it carefully. If there is any problem in the middle, he will help solve it as soon as possible, and send it back I bought a lot of toys for the child, and they responded to every request, and they were of the kind that ask for one to get ten. When they left, the child was reluctant to part with it, so he exchanged gifts with Jackiee. The hotel's Chinese restaurant and Japanese restaurant are also super good. You feel at home, because you can't take your children to the bar on the top floor, so I went to have afternoon tea to see the Bund. The view is great, and I will stay here again next time

It would be nice to experience the a**osphere of the Bund without having to go to the crowds during holidays. However, in a room at this price, the bathroom and toilet are squeezed into one square meter of space, and towels and toothbrushes are placed under the sink. It is almost at the height of the ground. After taking a shower, it is really a test of flexibility for a tall person to bend down in a limited space to reach the towel on the floor without touching his head!

The process was smooth, all the mentioned requirements were fulfilled, and the reply was very timely

transportation:
Needless to say, very convenient, good location

Check in:
Poor, it took about 30 minutes for two counters and three groups of customers.
The attitude towards the more detailed explanations for foreign guests is also very positive. They didn't say anything when I checked in. When I asked, I simply answered what I asked, without any detailed introduction, no.

Room facilities:
The things requested in advance have been done, and the complimentary fruits and cakes are included. The room is clean and tidy. The bathtub is also very clean, but it is inconvenient to use. The mattress, sofa and toiletries are pretty good.
The scenery is also very beautiful and the angle is quite good.

Room Service:
Generally speaking, it is generally lower.
No big problem, but there is no clip for delivering ice cubes,
After six o'clock in the evening, I knocked on the door twice and asked if I wanted water? ? ?
The drinking water was not replenished for two consecutive days.

facility:
There is a lobby bar and breakfast on the 1st floor
There is a swimming pool on the 5th floor
There is a bar on the top floor, the night view is beautiful
But I asked the staff and they couldn't tell me anything.

check out:
The same movement is very slow, and no one greets. In the end, a person came and asked if he wanted to check out quickly. After the room card was taken away, he said to wait a while, and there was no more. After waiting for five minutes, I went to ask another person and said that it was okay. There are a bunch of people standing next to me. I don't know what else they are busy with besides playing with their mobile phones.
From check-in to check-out, no one asked if they want to help with luggage.
The day before check-out, the manager said that he would give a small gift to his colleagues

Ok, no one mentioned this when I checked out, so I simply asked and no one knew about it,
I took out the dialogue message and said: Oh! Because she hasn't come to work today, wait a moment, the gift is on the way. Then went into the room.
In less than five seconds another person walked out and took two small packets of chocolates from the front desk floor and told me this was it.

Hmm... I don't think it can be done, so let's not talk about it. Breakfast was also a bunch of part-time work-students, and the scene was chaotic like a ghost. No registration, no seat, no introduction.

Especially the butler service is very considerate, Jackiee took the initiative to contact and confirm the information before check-in. Knowing that there are children in our group, we specially prepared small toys and chocolates for her. The turndown service at night is also quite good, the small desserts and fruits add to the feeling of going home!
Facilities: Easy to use, the only disadvantage is that the water from the basin faucet is too large to splash all over the floor.
Hygiene: The bathroom is very clean and has no peculiar smell. The bedding is dry and comfortable.
Environment: The bustling market outside and the quiet and elegant interior of the hotel complement each other.
Service: Warm and thoughtful, the service staff is friendly and loving.

This sound insulation is really bad, unprecedented, the sound insulation of a five-star hotel is the first time I stay in this hotel, and it will be the last time, everyone be careful! There is also a toilet that is squeezed into an explosion, a huge bathtub that takes up most of the space, have you considered this rationality?

First of all, check-in in the view room was nearly an hour late, and we kept urging it downstairs. The hotel was not very proactive and did not express any apology for being late, which is not very satisfactory. Secondly, the tone of some service staff is really uncomfortable for the service they can‚Äôt provide. For example, when they asked whether the disposable bathtub cover and the room could have a little milk for coffee, the answer they got was also emphasized three times in a row, ‚ÄúNo, no, no, no.‚Äù , this tone is very strange, five-star hotels should still do better in terms of service!

The main reason is that this hotel is too small, the public space is small, the rooms are small, especially the bathroom is very small, and the sink can't hold anything at all.
If the space cannot be expanded, at least replace the toilet with a washlet.
Let's talk about the advantages: the fragrance, accessories, and design are still full.
The bedding is very comfortable, I can sleep until dawn, and the bar on the top floor is very good for taking pictures! And the location is very good.

And they told me that I would have to wait for at least an hour. I was very tired from shopping and wanted to take a break and go out for dinner. I also wanted to wash my hair, make up, and change clothes in the room. I asked the front desk if I could borrow the room first so I could change clothes. ? He told me that there is already a bathroom in the swimming pool upstairs that I can change to? I was really shocked at the time. Is the calm attitude at the front desk really the same EDITION I stay at every time I come to Shanghai? Later, I changed clothes in the sauna room of the spa room. I was extremely depressed. There was no service afterwards and I felt sorry for the customers. We spent money to stay in the hotel, but they didn't treat us as customers. Finally the room was cleaned, it was already after six o'clock in the evening. I'm so dizzy, I've only stayed here during the two years of the epidemic. I felt the service when there were few people, but now the front desk has a strong sense of nobility and superiority!

msg:The environment is good, but compared with the price of the room, compared with the same hotel, it is small. Room service is also slow and not timely. Then the breakfast was quite speechless. A plate of smoked salmon on the self-service booth had been cut and hadn‚Äôt been placed outside. I kept waiting and didn‚Äôt know what it meant. Several customers around me were waiting, and then I saw an employee was about to bring it up. The employee who cut the salmon stopped him and said wait a minute, I saw it. What do you mean? ? ? ? Is this thing expensive? ? ? ? üòì Later, I went to reflect with the restaurant staff before bringing it up. In short, the service and experience are poor.

Generally speaking, entering the room gives people a very comfortable a**osphere, and then looking for the mini bar and other facilities for a long time, all hidden in the room, üòÑThe welcome fruit is very fresh, and I like berries very much.

msg:The representative of Guangzhou will travel to Shanghai during the Chinese New Year. The hotel is located on Nanjing Road. It is convenient for travel. The location must be the most convenient in the Bund. There is no view inside the room, only looking at the roof of the building on Nanjing Road. If you want a view, you have to go to the open-air bar on the 29th floor. The view is amazing. You can look directly at the Oriental Pearl Tower in Pudong. . The hotel also sent an afternoon tea, two types of cakes, two glasses of drinks, and some spare parts like macarons, which was pretty good. I didn't eat breakfast and missed the time. I went to the hotel restaurant and it felt pretty good. Generally speaking, the hotel is not too big, with a dark nightclub theme as the main theme, the service is considerate, and the sound insulation is average. Compared with other hotels on Nanjing Road, as long as you enjoy enough facilities, the trip is worthwhile.

There is a special butler service at the hotel. Special thanks to Cici. She is very helpful. She helps arrange various supplies and drinking water for children. There is no need to panic when she is here.
The location of the hotel is very good, just on the pedestrian street, you can walk to the Bund, take a taxi with the keyword "East Gate"
The package includes afternoon tea and breakfast, which is great! Coffee needs to be improved (maybe it‚Äôs personal taste), breakfast is a la carte buffet, so-so

Really want to say, the toilet is not intelligent, you can consider investing in it? In addition, the quality of toilet paper needs to be improved

From check-in, the staff you encounter are gentle and soft-spoken, making you feel at home and like a spring breeze. The commemorative light board and commemorative cake in the room gave a very big surprise, and I was very moved and happy. Angela also wrote us a blessing card, thank you for the warmth and thoughtfulness of the hotel. The room is simple and elegant, giving people a sense of low-key luxury. The feeling of being able to see the Oriental Pearl Tower as soon as you lie on the bed is simply amazing. The comfort of the bathrobe in the room is also top top. The hotel's breakfast is also delicious, semi-self-service, all the cooked food is ordered on the spot, the juice is freshly squeezed, and the staff service is very good, warming the heart and stomach. There is such an opportunity to slow down in a corner of the city and enjoy the happiness of this moment quietly. Thank you Addison for the perfect remembrance. Next time I have a chance to stay again.

Nanjing East Road is just outside the door, and it is only a 10-minute walk from the Bund. The staff are very enthusiastic. Someone will guide you to the room, give you the hotel's exclusive toiletry set, and also provide a drink exchange at the bar on the first floor. Of course, the view from the rooms above the 20th floor cannot be said to be invincible, but you can enjoy the three-piece suite on the Bund from another angle. The bar on the 28th floor is small in size but has a good a**osphere. Breakfast is mainly selected from the menu (there are also some buffet meals). The staff will deliver the meal to the dining location. The overall Chinese and Western-style meals are sufficient and well-styled.

Although parking is not convenient, the hotel also provides free valet parking. During the stay, many thanks to Kyra from guest relations and Ryan from the concierge! ! ! Here is the key point of praise
kyra! ! Gave me a very good check-in experience! ! The hotel room can't refrigerate the cake, kyra refrigerated it for me, and put it in the room for me at night! There is also a light sign. Because I needed to decorate the room, I asked if I needed help~ Tell me that next time I can book a Fengshang Bund view room! ! The scenery is really positive! This check-in experience is entirely because of Kyra, it can be said to be a very comfortable stay experience
~On the day of check-out, Kyra will rest, and will take the initiative to care if there is any need~
Thanks also to Ryan from the concierge for sending me flowers for decorating the room~

To be honest, I lived there for four days and I really suppressed my anger. When I came back, I got more and more angry. Why did I spend money and I was wronged? I never gave a bad review. I gave it to you the first time! Please reflect on it and improve it. Anyway, I will not go there!

msg:It is the worst experience in the hotel I have stayed in so far, not one of them! As a luxury hotel, don't talk about how thoughtful the service is, at least it must meet the standard! After all, more than two thousand a night! From entering the hotel with luggage to leaving the hotel, during this period, except for the good service of the Cantonese restaurant, there is zero service in other areas of the hotel! There is no concierge to take luggage. The front desk will not introduce any hotel facilities except for check-in. You can only find out by yourself. The telephone in the guest room called the switchboard nine times out of ten and no one answered. The only time someone answered was a long wait, and the attitude was very arrogant! Room service was appallingly inefficient, the room amenities that were ordered took at least 40 minutes to arrive, and that was after three urging phone calls! According to my observation, the occupancy rate on that day was not high! The aunt in the guest room did not have any service skills when she came in. She knocked on the door like a tiger. When I opened the door, I saw a messy-haired and disheveled auntie who broke into the room with my things without any language or eye contact, and put them away. Leaving directly, there was no communication during the whole process, as if we were air! The next day at breakfast time, I met a staff member who looked like a room supervisor on the elevator and asked her which floor breakfast was on, but she didn't know!
In short, during the entire stay, I thought in a trance that the express hotel I stayed in was far worse than the Sanya Edition! There are very few service staff in the hotel, and every employee is indifferent and tired. I rarely see a smile. I read the reviews before saying that the service was poor. I thought it was because others were demanding. After I checked in, I found that the management of the hotel was flawed. big problem.

During dinner, the restaurant manager will ask the guests about the dining situation at each table, whether they are satisfied with the accommodation, why they choose EDITION, and introduce the hotel's brunch to the guests. We know the EDITION because the Sanya EDITION has been unable to check in, and we can see the hardships of the hotel industry after the epidemic. I went to Amy Sheshan in August and the service plummeted. But this trip to the Addison was very satisfying.
Although the room is not as big as W, the staff explained to us that the hotel is renovated from an old building, so the area is limited.

The handling of the problem is also very stingy. The door of the suite cannot be closed, which is bad.
It feels like a place that consumes young people's wool once, bullying young people and not enjoying good service?

msg:I often come to the Shanghai EDITION to check in. I had a very lucky experience in this stay. I felt the terrace suite. The terrace suite is really the first choice to see the river view. It is looking at the Huangpu River Lujiazui building complex! It will not let you down. Moreover, the furniture display and indoor lighting in the room are very good. Secondly, the location of the hotel is more convenient. Going out is the pedestrian street of East Nanjing Road. Near the subway station and major shopping malls, the hotel's gym, swimming pool, restaurant, and bar have all returned to normal recently. It also fully reflects the characteristics of Edison. I would like to thank all my colleagues in the front office for making our stay a very special experience, especially Charles, Frank, Yifa from the front desk, Ryan from the concierge depar**ent, and Suha from the Yvonne guest relations depar**ent. The enthusiastic help and service attitude are very worthy of recognition. I highly recommend everyone to stay at the Shanghai EDITION. Come and experience a different charm.

I booked two rooms and said that I can only give one, and there is an hour to wait for the sanitation of the other room , As a result, I waited for 4 hours (check in from 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm). The room is small, the facilities are average, and the hair dryer is also very old. Good hotels are now standard with Dyson. ...

When I checked in, the lady at the front desk said that I had upgraded the room type for free, but when I got to the room, it was a corner room. The room was small and pitiful. Then I changed to another room, which was fine. The room was not cleaned at 4:00 p.m. I called the customer service center and said that it would be arranged immediately and I went out at night. I came back in the evening and saw that it was simply a quilt. The trash cans were all uncleaned. The same toothbrush was stuffed into a glass. How can I distinguish the luggage after check-out? When I got it from the concierge, the elder brother dragged the box over the steps and the wheels almost got stuck. It wasn‚Äôt his own box, so you don‚Äôt need to take care of it? As a five-star hotel, the service is really bad enough.

You can see the Big Three, and the neon lights are flashing at night. There is nothing to say about the city view. Valet parking is also a very useful service. The breakfast restaurant looks like Hong Kong's magnificent, but the product and selection of breakfast is slightly unsatisfactory. After all, the Sanya EDITION is really delicious üòã The facilities in the room are a little tasteless, and the faucet of the sink is too long. If When the water is boiled, it can be directly sprayed into the basin, which is also a little confusing to this design; when the faucet of the bathtub is turned on to the hot water, the faucet will saturate the water everywhere. It may be that the software facilities need to be maintained from time to time (the business is too good). The view from the bathroom is really good, but it is inconvenient to take a bath with the curtains drawn, and you can see it from the next room. There is no sloping floor on the floor of the bathroom, and the bubble water will spread all over the room, and even overflow to the outside. The design of the hotel is very modern, and the a**osphere and lighting are also well presented, so if you don't care about the sections, this is definitely a hotel choice that can feel very good.

On the whole, Addison is the kind of simple style, it is very comfortable if your home is arranged like this. Why is it so popular here? Because the elements in the room are very design, there will be no more or less. Reasonable use of these elements, coupled with personal photography skills, it is easy to produce pictures. If the technique is not good and the shooting is not good, you may be a little disappointed, but you can refer to how others take good photos. To be fair, Edison's design is indeed worth learning. If you have time and interest, you can fiddle with its interior design. But if you want that big luxury or a resplendent interior, the EDITION might not really be the way to go

There are also automatic switches for lights and curtains in the house. I went out and did a nucleic acid test in the middle. When I came back and opened the door, you didn‚Äôt have to do anything. The lights were automatically turned on and the curtains were automatically opened. It was a bit of a surprise.

Because this is a honeymoon trip, I mentioned it to the hotel in advance. After arriving at the hotel, Yifa, a colleague at the front desk, checked in. After the check-in, Charlotte from the guest relations showed us the room and introduced the situation of the room for a while. After entering the room, I did some arrangements, and later learned that it was the room arranged by Nina. After checking in, I also added Linda WeChat from the Guest Relations Depar**ent. After I checked out, I said I liked the taste of lelabo, and Linda directly offered to send us an extra copy, plus some other small gifts as souvenirs.

The room is small, bigger than a budget hotel. The room is not soundproof, and the children next to you can hear it clearly. The swimming pool has only two lanes and is about 10 meters long, which is very simple. You need to wear a down jacket for breakfast. The restaurant has no door and is directly facing the external door, and the wind keeps blowing in. Don't be deceived by Xiaohongshu's Internet celebrity pictures, it is definitely a pit. There are many hotels on the Bund, and this one is the worst cost-effective hotel. It is an upgraded version of the economy hotel.

Compared with the Sanya EDITION, there are still obvious gaps in space, decoration sophistication, sound insulation, etc. The toilet toilet is not a smart toilet (this seems to be inappropriate for hotels renovated in recent years).
The toiletries are Le Labo, which is different from Fairmont's rose31 and Grand Hyatt's santa33. This one has no number, which is Le Labo edition.

Miss Blanche is super nice! ! ! Howard's review for check-in and check-out at the front desk! ! There is also an upgraded Sydney, which is great! !
The bathroom in the guest room uses LE LABO toiletries, as well as fruit snacks, and the bedding is very comfortable! The breakfast was also great! The landscape is also good.
A little suggestion: there is no basket for throwing dirty towels in the room, and the sink area is too small.

msg:Summary: The dark version of the all-season hotel (the service is not as good as the whole season)

1. Parking Guidance Event
A total of three calls
- The first call, call the front desk a few days in advance, and was told that the hotel has no parking lot, but there is valet parking.
- On the second pass, I asked where the parking entrance of the hotel was, and I was told that it was at No. 271, Jiangxi Middle Road (there is only one road to enter there, and the road surface can only turn left and right, and there is no straight line sign. The front desk of the hotel did not inform the particularity of this location. The car point is a small section of internal road)
- The third call, informing that the intersection can ignore the ground instructions and drive directly in (I have already made a big circle at this time)

2. The male front desk changed floors with a sarcastic tone
When I checked in, I was told that the room type was automatically upgraded, and the city view room was changed from the 12th floor to the 19th floor. Because I lived in the Waldorf Astoria with my wife before, the city view room was not good, so I was upgraded to the Bund room, so I asked the difference between this city view room and the original room type. The male front desk means that you don't want bb or help you down to the 12th floor. I am not in the service industry, and I also know that at this time, I should ask the guests "I still have concerns after upgrading the room type, what is the reason?" What aspects are they worried about. Instead of impatiently asking the result when the guest is thinking.

3. Toothbrush and toothpaste incident
There is no need to tell me that toothbrush and toothpaste are not provided in Shanghai. As a five-star hotel, it will not remind guests whether they need toothpaste or toothbrush when checking in. To be fair, I have stayed in many star-rated hotels, and I have never had such a bad experience, no matter whether it is in the suburbs or in other places.

The whole hotel is the level of the ** version of the American small hotel

The service staff such as the concierge front desk are full of professionalism and patience and attentiveness. Even at the side entrance of the hotel, there are about three concierges who come to help at any time. Because I was curious about the Addison Space in the annex building, Blanche specially led me to visit and explain. This kind of interaction should be a model service of the luxury hotel series~

The most prominent thing here should be the bar and the food. It is perfectly possible to stay in the hotel for a day and not to be bored with nothing to do. Because starting from the western restaurant brunch on the first floor, the socializing of the lobby bar, to the Guangdong restaurant on the side building, it is really outstanding. Dim sum set menus can be ordered a la carte, and the quality is creative online. There is an Addison space on the upper floor, which is more private. The sofa is a representative blanket, specially made for spirits, a ktv small theater billiard table and even a dancing space. Young people‚Äôs indoor activities are 100% satisfied. The Japanese restaurant upstairs in the main building, the hand rolls are absolutely unexpected but surprisingly delicious, and it‚Äôs rare to order tuna in small, medium and large fat in the restaurant of the hotel, and there are special sauces, and long drinks with meals are also special bartenders. It shouldn‚Äôt be unfamiliar. The scarlet letter of the pyracantha fruit in Punch can make up for The scarlet letterüß∂ is an innovative and excellent cocktail series, with all punch-in tastings, a rare thunder-free experience. The open-air bar on the top floor should be one of the Shanghai hotels that is still hot and open normally regardless of the weather. The first choice for afternoon tea~
It is the only hotel with the most staff WeChat, so the degree of worth and a series of living feelings must be over-satisfied ~ health services, will remember the guests' daily outing time and needs, and feel that they are valued and caring in the details.
I have to say that I didn't actually check in the first time, and I did not check in the last five-star cross-strait check-in. It shouldn't be true, but I am fortunate to have gained preferential trea**ent and good memories here. In short, in other hotels, I think the two parties belong to an exchange of interests. Here I hope to be friends with everyone. Also üíØ thank you all staff~

msg:I chose to spend the sixth anniversary of the subject in Shanghai Addison. From check-in to the end, I was very moved. I usually don't like reviews with pictures, but the hotel score of 4.5 I really feel too frustrated, I want to rehabilitate the hotel. Some people think that the wooden structure of the hotel is a plus for the whole family. In fact, the high-end wood material really makes the room very low-key and luxurious, which is completely different from the kind of express hotels like the whole family. Smaller room types may be a bit small, but you can really choose suites if you have the conditions, they are very large and comfortable. The service is also very good. I hope that the hotel can make some simple decorations when checking in. The hotel has arranged roses and presented cakes and red wine. Because I really like the hotel‚Äôs washing and care, I also gave an extra package of washing care before checking out. Convenient outfit, so happy. I would like to praise the staff of the hotel. Linda from the Guest Relations Depar**ent responded to my desired service and requirements like a housekeeper. On Wednesday night, we were invited to participate in the happy hour, which made us feel warmer. The beautiful sister in Tuli is charlotte from the Guest Relations Depar**ent. She enthusiastically served us and took Polaroid photos for the sixth anniversary of us. She was very moved. Linda of the Lobby bar prepared us a few cups of special hotel cocktails. The taste is excellent. Drinking slightly with the object is really happy. I really feel that this hotel really considers the sincere service of the guests for the guests. . I originally saw Ctrip‚Äôs 4.5 points and I really hesitated for a long time when placing an order. Only after I checked in did I realize that the hotel is truly good. The first time I stayed at the Edison, I left such beautiful memories, and I will choose the Edison in the future, but unfortunately there are only two hotels in China, Shanghai and Sanya.

msg:Thank you Charlotte and Joy of the Guest Relations Depar**ent for their meticulous arrangement and caring service! This is a wedding anniversary check-in, call in advance to inform, it is definitely a big surprise when you enter the room! Starting from Check-in, the service in every link is smooth, and the staff are kind and not lost in sense of proportion. In terms of details, butler-type services, leading to the room after check-in, and active communication on WeChat are even more impossible for general hotel chains to provide.

The weather helps, and the panoramic room has an excellent viewing angle. I spend most of the time in the room to see the scenery. It is interesting to identify the old buildings on Nanjing Road and the Bund from a height.

The catering depar**ent only experienced the breakfast at Shanghai Tavern on the first floor, which was stable but not particularly amazing. Unfortunately, there was a private event on the 28th floor that day, so let‚Äôs check the Cocktail level next time.

msg:My girlfriend was born in Japan and booked the itinerary to Macau, but the outbreak had to be cancelled. Later, I thought it was close to Lemodu to rest for a few days. I used to come to Shanghai to always Banyan Tree, but this time I wanted to change another one. The old five-star hotels are almost living in I want to try Edison, because I have seen a lot of hotel Internet celebrities check-in on Ctrip before, and I am afraid that it will affect the living experience. It turns out that there is no!
Navigate to the hotel parking lot with valet parking, but you have to pay 160 yuan/day. There are also staff who help us take our bags and hold umbrellas. They are very proactive, but most hotels have them. After check-in, the staff and hotel GRO accompanied us to the room. When taking the elevator, they introduced us to the facilities on each floor in detail. After arriving in the room, they introduced the facilities in the room (even the only smart device with electric curtains) and minibar. He also informed in detail where the drinking water was placed (even if it was only in a 47-square-meter room). This intimate degree was in situ. (Complimentary terms learned from commenting netizens)
After check-in, GRO also gave us the invitation card of happyhour, the lobby bar of our hotel, which is suitable for our snacks and drinks after a long journey. The snacks are unambiguous and very delicate and delicious.
The next day we changed rooms with river view (because it was my birthday) GRO wrote a birthday card and prepared a birthday cake. Although it was a gift, the taste and presentation of the cake were quite good.
Because I saw Hiya‚Äôs online celebrity photos in the comments, I wanted to reserve this location, but because this location was too popular, GRO was very enthusiastic to help us book other windows by the window and told us to avoid other guests booking time Then I can take good pictures quickly, and I really have to give her a thumbs up for her caring service. (Extend here, the service of Hiya restaurant is incompatible with the hotel itself, the waiters are not enthusiastic and the speech is vague, but they are not bad for business, and the taste is very general. I will not go again if it is not for taking pictures)
Here I would like to give crazy praise to the service of GRO Bernice (uppercase and bold) and declare the capping! ! To put it in general terms, the service of the Addison can be called the ceiling of the hotel industry, which was unexpected before I moved in. Although the hotel room facilities are very ordinary, 98% rely on the Pujiang scenery to support, but Bernice's service can be said to kill other major five-star or even six-star hotels, making people feel comfortable, the right sense of distance, rapid problem handling, and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The service, the care that meets the needs, and the uninterrupted companionship from check-in to departure, simply define the standard for hotel services.
I think for this class of hotels, standards such as hygiene, bedding comfort, and cost-effectiveness have long been outside the judging criteria. This is the foundation of the foothold, and more of the invisible soft power that extends outward.
This trip is really amazing, next time I will check in Addison in other cities.

üöó Transportation: Go out to the subway station

üßπSanitation: The style is minimal but the sanitation is not minimal. The blankets in the room must be carefully vacuumed and very clean.

üçÉEnvironment: I don‚Äôt rule out that I have subjective emotions, it‚Äôs really great, whether it‚Äôs their Hiya Hiya or their small bar

üîîService: Due to the epidemic, only one door is opened, but it does not affect the check-in experience. The baggage will be picked up directly by the porter and will be delivered to my room before I enter the door. The young ladies at the front desk who check in are very enthusiastic.

It is worth mentioning that, due to some special reasons, I left the room in the early morning and rushed to the airport. The little sisters Blanche and Jasmine at the front desk enthusiastically reminded me and gave me an umbrella from the hotel to help me check out. It feels like Shanghai Edition is a luxury five in hotel design or service. One of the best star hotels

As soon as the drawer was pulled, a cup fell and broke. It was the first time in my life that I broke a cup in a hotel. The faucet in the washbasin is even weirder. It's so long and the sink is so small that the water sprays all over the pants when it's a little bigger. Maybe the room we stayed in is more than 2,000 ordinary, mainly these are unreasonable places, the service of other service staff is still very good, ps tiramisu is very special, really delicious

msg:Environment introduction: This time I stayed at the Edison on Nanjing East Road and chose the Fashion Bund View Room, which is directly opposite to the Daimaru Depar**ent Store on the pedestrian street. The address is superior, and of course the price will not be very low. It is a 5-minute walk from the Bund and Bund 18, and there are also various large shopping malls, hotels, restaurants and bars around it, which is very convenient.

Room type: This time I stayed in a landscape room type. On the 25th floor, there are only 3 rooms in the one-sided corridor. I am very grateful to the lady at the front desk for arranging such a quiet area. The floor is almost the highest part of the room. The high ceiling in the room is one of the best in the hotel I have stayed in so far. It is a special surprise. The room is facing the Bund and Lujiazui, whether it is day or night, it is very spectacular.

Facilities and services: The hotel uses Le labo's toiletries, which are sweeter and fresher than the fragrance of Park Hyatt, which is great! Whether it's slippers or mineral water, they all have the logo of Edition. I like it very much. The type of breakfast is not particularly rich, and the semi-buffet is more Western-style, which may also be the reason for being in Shanghai. The top three floors of the hotel are full of bars and restaurants. The view is very good. If you stay in the hotel, you can punch a card.

2. Sanitation is worrying: the floor is dirty, the blankets are gray, the sofa is torn, the toilet paper is not folded, and even the outside glass is gray, with unknown yellow on the edge, which is not at all like The landscape so clearly captured by others
3. Unreasonable facilities:
I have never seen such a long faucet paired with such a small basin. The water will splash out no matter how much it is turned on. The experience is extremely poor;
The lighting in the bathroom cannot be adjusted, and the equipped makeup mirror has no magnification or lighting, resulting in a very poor makeup experience. By the way, don't break their makeup mirror, or they will call you with a bad attitude and make you lose 900 yuan.
Where is the full length mirror? Is it too hidden and I didn't see it? oh no
4. It is very inconvenient to take a taxi: next to the pedestrian street, it is difficult to park a taxi, and you have to walk a long way from the hotel to get on the bus
With this money, there are really too many choices. Don‚Äôt make yourself uncomfortable and come to live in Edison.

The next day when I looked at the photos taken by my friend, the more I thought about it, the more wrong I became. The room I booked should be facing Lujiazui and have two windows, one of which was a floor-to-ceiling window.

msg:I stayed at the Edition Hotel on the Bund in Shanghai with anticipation, but I was really disappointed. Summarize the following points
1. The hotel has inconvenient traffic. The Bund has a lot of people. The software car is very strenuous and the car can only go to the edge of the hotel, not the gate because the gate is on the pedestrian street, and the car cannot get in.
2. The superior twin room I ordered. This is going to be a complaint at the end. The room is very small, comparable to a fast hotel. For example, the sink is not as big as the sink on the high-speed rail. I took a photo with the attached picture.
3. The TV is very slow when changing channels. I feel that the quality of this TV is not as good as that of the Express Hotel.
4. There is no paper pump in the room

Others are barely acceptable, but this price gives me such a small room. The room is blocked by the iron net. I think my 2600 yuan is not worth the price. The price is too low!! The price is very low, please pay attention! Don't step on the thunder! But the quality of the service staff is still very good, which is worthy of recognition.

In short, the experience is not good. I have stayed in several hotels of the same level in Shanghai and they are much better than this. I don't recommend it!

My sister kept telling us to look for the white box and the inside of the bag, and declared that it was equipped with dental kits; first of all, neither of us was blind, and we did not find all the corners; but the young lady insisted that there is, so we will go I found it, and indeed there was none, and then I made a call again. At this time, I called another person with me and explained to the lady for a long time that there was no dental appliances. I said at the other end of the room that there were really no dental appliances. , Because it is far away from the landline, I did not speak softly to the arrogant her. At this time, the little sister heard it and said impatiently: "I know, don't bark." Okay, I shut up, may I ask, is it appropriate for a hotel staff to say the word "screaming" to customers? That‚Äôs your attitude towards customers? Here, I have a few questions: 1. Since 2020, your hotel has received bad reviews on service attitude, and I was treated like this by your hotel‚Äôs service staff when I checked in in 2021.6. Does your hotel have any? Take the customer to heart? Have any measures been taken to deal with the problem, regulate the behavior of hotel staff, and provide training? 2. As a five-star hotel, does it hurt the image of the hotel to have such service staff come to work? Or does she have any privilege to be so arrogant? Why can you say words like "screaming" to customers? To sum up, most hotels will be perfunctory, but I hope to see this comment. If you want to stay at this hotel, you can think twice. The service attitude of this hotel in Shanghai is really unbelievable. Finally, attach a picture of the room to attract everyone's attention.

msg:See Edith again! The rooms and services are very satisfactory. The front office led by Camila makes people feel organized. Xandra, Lily, and Jasmine who checked in to our rooms are super gentle and patient. They helped from the formalities of forgetting to bring ID cards to luggage storage We have arranged it! I like the decoration style of the Addison. In addition to the rooms, there are many places where you can take pictures. Hiya Hiya and the roof bar on the top floor have both gone to check in! The Riya decoration looks very nice~ the roof bar has a nice view of the river. This time I was upgraded to the Fashion Suite and I can see the Oriental Pearl Tower lucky me‚úåÔ∏è

msg:The Addison who has stayed in Sanya thinks the service is very good, so she decisively chose the Shanghai Addison for this birthday! The service is really the ceiling. Aileen, who served me, was really warm but not overbearing, making me feel very comfortable! Sydney and Jasmine at the front desk are also very nice. I really want to praise Addison's service! I will choose here next time

msg:I have never stayed in such a trashy hotel! I really learned a lot about Addison! It‚Äôs understandable that the hotel doesn‚Äôt have a parking lot. I drove all the way here and it was already 11pm when I arrived at the hotel. I waited for 15 minutes for someone to park my car. When the driver arrived, he told me that we didn‚Äôt have insurance for this stretch of road and asked me to drive in a big circle. Going to the other side, is this the so-called waiting? I don‚Äôt apologize for anything. Let‚Äôs just say that our parking fee is 160 per day. It‚Äôs really awesome that a hotel with a room rate of 4000 per night charges 160 per day for parking. Dragging two big boxes, tell me the bellman is off duty? Dragging your own luggage? As soon as I entered, there were three security guards chatting and playing with their mobile phones to check the health code, but no one helped me carry my luggage. When I arrived at the front desk, there was only a waiter. After hearing my complaint at the front desk, four or five people came out. They were all chatting on their mobile phones... When I entered the room, the sanitary conditions were so outrageous that I didn't want to complain. The hotel's soundproofing was so bad that I couldn't sleep well all night. . The bedding used in luxury hotels is simply not worthy of the price. I have never used such rubbish pillows and quilts. I still spent 9,000 yuan to upgrade to a suite. There are also very few breakfast varieties. The house prices are all driven up by the so-called Internet celebrities, and the scenery is not that good. From service to details to hygiene to hardware and software, there is really nothing that makes me agree, so be careful! ! !

msg:After staying for two nights, the skirt I wore when I checked in on the first night was changed, and it was not put in the suitcase. It was definitely changed at the hotel and not put in a box to take away, but I couldn't find it in the hotel. I called twice and said no. Very disappointed, after all, it is a new skirt.

msg:When I came out of the hotel room, I met a man who took a bag of lelabo bath products and said hello to me. He said his name was ************. If you book a room at the hotel and ask him for 890, you can check in. Let me find him if I need it. I don't know why the hotel has such scalpers entering and leaving the room at will. Then it is still attracting customers, the management level of the hotel is really worrying.
When I came out of the hotel room, I met a man who took a bag of Edition lelabo bath products and said hello to me. He said his name was ************. He told me that if I book a room from him it will take cheaper price which is 890 yuan. I don't know why the hotel has such scalpers entering and leaving the room at will. Then he is still attracting customers, the management level of the hotel is really worrying.

msg:At the hotel entrance, I met a person who asked me if I checked in with a room card. I asked him his name, and he said his name was ***, and he came to give me the room card! But I didn't know who this person was. Later, I went to the front desk to find my check-in order, and heard the hotel lobby staff tell me that this person was reselling rooms here. Many people bought like this person, and because of safety issues, he had disputes with many customers before, and the check-in experience was very poor. I don't know why the hotel allows such scalpers to sell rooms at the front desk. There is no need to check in, which makes me question the hotel's safety measures and express disappointment with the Edition brand. I hope this situation will not happen again when checking in.

I met a man at the gate of the hotel who asked me if I checked in with my room card. I asked his name, and he said his name was *************. He came to give me his room card! But I didn't know who this person was. Later, I went to the front desk to find my check-in order. I heard the hotel lobby staff tell me that this person was selling rooms here, and many people bought from this person. Moreover, because of security problems, there were disputes with many customers before, and the check-in experience was very poor. I wonder why the hotel allowed this scalper to sell rooms at the front desk. I also don't need to check in, which makes me question the hotel's security measures and express my disappointment with the brand Edition I hope this will not happen again.
