Most of the staff were quite friendly, including the pool attendant and the housekeeper on my floor.  I especially want to commend a gentleman who worked in the revolving restaurant on the top floor.  His name is Mr. Duncan Liu and he was very kind, friendly and helpful.  He always made sure that we got a table quickly and brought drinks to our table.  He also offered advice about things to do in the area and was genuinely interested in how we had enjoying our stay in Jinan.  No matter how busy it was at breakfast, he always made sure that we were well taken care of and happy.  Thank you for your hospitality!

You can walk to the surrounding Black Tiger Spring, Quancheng Square, Baotu Spring and other scenic spots. You can walk around in your free time. The hotel environment is elegant, the front desk check-in and check-out are fast, and the check-in informs me that I have upgraded the room, which is large and spacious. The facilities are well maintained, clean and tidy, the towels are also soft, and the bedding in the room is clean and comfortable. The hotel can also park for free, which is very convenient. The staff are very enthusiastic and thoughtful. The sales manager Ella is also very considerate on duty in the lobby. The service is professional and efficient, helping to guide the elevator. The overall cost-effectiveness is high, the experience is good, and it is worth recommending.

This hotel is located in the city center and is within walking distance to Baotu Spring, Daming Lake, Black Tiger Spring and other scenic spots. The highlight of the hotel is the revolving restaurant on the 46th floor. While sitting in the restaurant and having a hearty breakfast, you can overlook the beautiful scenery of the spring city from east to west, south to north. I estimate the linear speed around the revolving restaurant to be about 60 centimeters per minute. It is worth a look. Next time I come to Jinan, I will stay at Yihao Hotel again. I would like to thank the hotel's manager Xiong and the housekeeping director for your warm service!

As expected, I was not disappointed and was very satisfied. The front desk service attitude was very good. The mineral water I asked for by phone was delivered to my door quickly. The hotel facilities and decoration were of five-star standard. The room facilities and layout were satisfactory. The children liked it very much and didn't want to go out. The breakfast in the revolving restaurant on the 49th floor was very rich. The key was that the children liked the view and were satisfied with the food. It was a very nice trip, full marks. The customer's follow-up call was made by the manager on duty. His voice was nice and caring. He was very kind like an old friend. Thumbs up!

The lobby environment is nice and clean. The service is also OK.
When checking out, the service staff helped me pack my luggage🧳, thank you very much.
The decoration and furnishings in the room are a bit old, but I feel that the room is really not good. I don’t know if the square meters are enough for more than 30. I booked a room with windows, but the windows cannot be opened and there is no ventilation.
🌟Key point: The air conditioner is not easy to use. First, the buttons are not easy to use. Second, I turned it to 22 degrees and it didn’t respond. I could only lower it and turned it to 16 degrees. After blowing it all night, the indoor temperature showed 24 degrees. I couldn’t sleep at night because it was too hot. Now the weather is not very hot on May Day. I don’t know what to do in summer.
🌟The room feels a little humid.
🌟The room layout is very strange. The TV is hung on the wall on the left side of the bed. I really don’t know how to see it? Before booking, the TV was right opposite the bed.
🌟 In addition, there is a mirror directly opposite the bed, which means sleeping in front of the mirror. It stands to reason that the most taboo thing in our hometown is that this kind of mirror faces people. In short, I am very dissatisfied. I don’t know what the layout of other rooms is. I was very tired in the traffic jam at that time and forgot to change a room.
🌟 Breakfast: The environment is OK. The variety is not rich. If you want to eat pancakes, you have to queue for about half an hour.
It took a long time to choose a hotel, and I will give you a real evaluation reference!

Although it is an old five-star hotel, the service management and room facilities are still worthy of praise. When checking out, they also sent handmade snacks, which is very thoughtful.

The facilities are a little old, the elevator was a little hot without air conditioning for two days, and there was a problem with the electric curtain, but it didn't matter much, it was opened manually and it was harmless. Overall, a good review, recommended to try.

msg:I chose Yihao Hotel for my May Day trip. It was cost-effective and the experience was very good. After booking, the hotel staff contacted me in advance to inquire about the needs. After arriving, I saw the hotel's superior geographical location. Several scenic spots around it, such as Baotu Spring, Black Tiger Spring, Jiefang Pavilion, and Quancheng Square, are very convenient to walk to. The surrounding transportation is convenient, the hotel environment is elegant, and the temperature in the lobby and room is very suitable. Because of the advance communication, the front desk handled it quickly and quickly. Considering the convenience of the children, the front desk also coordinated a super large bed on the high floor. From a distance, you can see the Buddha of Qianfo Mountain. The room was given welcome fruit, which was very fresh. Children's toiletries were given, and the towels were also very soft. The facilities and equipment were well maintained, clean and tidy, the bathroom and toilet were separated into dry and wet areas, and the sound insulation was also very good. The breakfast rotates 360 degrees, the environment is good, the landscape is unique, and the dishes are rich and full of local characteristics. Free parking for hotel guests, the lobby manager Xiong is very warm and thoughtful, very kind, and coordinates the check-in matters. In short, the cost-effectiveness is very high. I recommend friends to choose Yihao

The hotel is very grand, the rooms are very spacious, the decoration is a bit old, but it is still very clean, the shower water is big, and the bedding is comfortable. The cleaning lady saw that I drank a lot of water and specially put a few more bottles of water, so I would like to thank her.

It is very convenient to walk to Heihuquan~Kuanhouli if you want to visit the surrounding areas. The transportation around the hotel is convenient. There is a shopping mall next to it, so shopping is also convenient. The hotel environment is elegant.

msg:I brought my children to Jinan to participate in an event and chose Yihao. The front desk called in advance to upgrade the room type. Judging from the floor, it was probably a deluxe king-size bed room. It was also very convenient to stay in the original room.
Everything was very good, and the children especially liked the robot to deliver things to them.
The bath towel was probably very new, so it still shed a little. I am allergic.
There was no problem with the duvet and pillow, and they were very comfortable. But the bed was too soft. The mattress support was not very good, and there were two children and one big child. I felt uncomfortable in my waist after sleeping for a long time.
I had breakfast and dinner in the revolving restaurant once, and the viewing experience was very good.
The food was relatively rich, and the fruit quality was also good, but the coffee was not fragrant.
The hotel cost 220 for adults and 128 for children for dinner on Friday. There was plenty of choice, but the children didn’t like it. They only had a bowl of vegetarian noodles and a small fragrant pear. A restaurant staff member came over inexplicably and asked me if I was a ** user. After learning that I was not, he left inexplicably. I don’t like it.

Yihao gift - a homemade cultural and creative ice cream: I was reminded of this when renewing my subscription, but I didn't get to eat it
First round of minibar: OK, there are pure draft and carbonated soda

It's a ten-minute walk from the Black Tiger Spring Scenic Area. It's very convenient to get spring water. There is a bus stop not far downstairs. If there is a traffic jam everywhere, taking the bus is very cost-effective.
The room card is still from Sofitel. Many Jinan teachers who drive small flower cars don't know Yihao but only know Sofitel
Yihao is the first choice hotel for tourism in Jinan. Recommended

msg:The hotel is a bit old. The room attendants are quite dedicated and good at communication. We asked for a few more bottles of mineral water and they were fully satisfied. There was a problem with the room card and the door could not be opened, but they took the initiative to open the door for us and let us enter the room first. The security guard's communication skills are a bit weak. When we drove here on a self-driving tour, we were asked to park our car at the ICBC side, but in fact, the entrance to the hotel's public parking lot is there. We can drive to the B2 floor to enter the elevator entrance in the underground part of the hotel. The entrance and exit are relatively narrow, so we have to drive slowly. The internal supervision of the parking lot needs to be improved. Some cars do not park in the parking spaces, but park in the aisles, affecting the entry and exit of other vehicles. The breakfast restaurant is on the 49th floor, a revolving restaurant with a good environment. We stayed for two days, but there were no buns or steamed buns on the second morning. The restaurant waiters are also very dedicated.

Late arrivals don't have to bother looking for restaurants, the hotel can solve the problem perfectly. The transportation is very convenient, there are a lot of shared bicycles at the door, and it takes only a few minutes to get to Baotu Spring. There is also a direct access to Ginza downstairs, but there is nothing to eat in this Ginza. The waiters I met were very nice. Thanks to the front desk receptionist for helping me upgrade the view room. I will choose here next time I come to Jinan! This Malaysian rice noodles is really delicious. It's about 40 minutes' drive from the airport, and it's also convenient to take a taxi. The cleaning aunt is great, and she boiled water for me when I returned to the room.

I regret not buying more.

Several important tourist spots are around the hotel. The transportation is convenient and the environment is quiet. Guests can enter the license plate number at the concierge before driving to park for free, which is very fast.

Yihao (formerly Sofitel Ginza Hotel) is a long-established five-star hotel in Jinan, and the lobby is connected to Ginza Shopping Mall. The transportation is convenient. It is about a 10-minute walk to Quancheng Square and Heihu Spring. After dinner in the evening, it is nice to walk to Quancheng Square to see the music fountain from 20:00 to 20:30! Most of the attractions can be seen in the room.
Although the hotel is relatively old, the facilities should have been reconfigured, and the characteristic feeling of the hotel in the early 21st century has been retained. The bathroom bathtub, shower room, and toilet room are separated, and the layout is very reasonable.
The hygiene is good, the room is very clean, and they also help to fold the clothes.
I highly recommend this hotel, the service attitude is really very good!

Before checking in, a colleague from the hotel called in advance to inquire about the check-in needs and actively coordinated the handling. The hotel is located in the city center, and there are many places to go for a walk around, such as Quancheng Square and Heihu Spring. The surrounding transportation is convenient, the environment is quiet and elegant, the lobby design is very distinctive, and the fragrance is fresh and suitable. The front desk staff smiled and received us, which was very friendly and very professional. The processing was fast and reduced the waiting time. The check-in room was arranged with a high-rise view, overlooking the Daming Lake Scenic Area, which was refreshing. The room was spacious and comfortable, with complete facilities, a bathtub, and a dry and wet separation in the bathroom.

The staff had a strong sense of service, and Meria patiently answered questions. After checking out, the staff asked about the experience and felt at home. I will choose Yihao Hotel again on my next business trip.

The house is very clean. Breakfast is actually in the revolving restaurant on the 49th floor. You can see Jinan while eating. There are many kinds of food. Check-in and check-out are also very fast. Anyway, it feels very comfortable. The wooden combs and toothbrushes provided by the hotel are actually made of wood. Thinking that there is another hotel to stay in at the next stop, I took them. It feels a bit high-end and is a hotel worth recommending. The only small suggestion is that the shower head in the bathroom is recommended to be placed against the wall, otherwise the guests will be sprayed with cold water when the faucet is turned on directly. After all, details determine quality.

Then on the first day of check-in, we will give you fruit in the afternoon. There is unlimited water in the room. We stayed in a superior double room and there will be a bathtub. It is recommended to prepare a disposable bathtub cover in advance. It is quite comfortable to soak in the water.
We booked two rooms in total, and then asked the front desk to arrange an adjacent room. We asked for children's supplies once in the evening, and then helped to get toothbrushes, toothpaste, and children's shower gel. The service was quite good. The revolving restaurant is more beautiful for photos, but There is still a gap between the dishes and the charging level of ¥178. I feel that the variety is not particularly rich. The wonton stew is more delicious, and there are also Jinan's special pork meat and sweet foam.
We are traveling as a family, and we also brought our family members. The location of the hotel is quite convenient. It is close to Quancheng Square and Black Tiger Spring. It is recommended to travel on foot at this distance because the traffic here is too congested. The hotel has Free parking in the underground parking lot￼￼

The facilities still have the a**osphere of the times, so I won’t introduce them much. But the point is that I want to recognize the fruit lady on the 45th floor on February 14th. (It seems that the name is two characters, Wang Yue/Wang Yu can’t remember clearly)

The fruit lady was very enthusiastic, and her smile made me feel like the snow that day had melted a lot. I praised the oranges in the hotel for being delicious, so she gave me a few as gifts. Delicious indeed.

The oranges were a minor matter, but I took these oranges all the way back to Shenzhen. The feeling of hometown that has spanned most of the motherland has been brought here by these little oranges.

The greatest kindness is to give others the greatest convenience within the smallest scope of one's rights. I never thought that these sweet and sour things would be pieced together into the New Year memory of 2024.

It is very convenient to ride a bicycle. Parking at the hotel is okay. The underground parking lot is quite large. It is an old five-star hotel. I have nothing to say about the service, especially the beautiful lady at the front desk, Ms. Zhang, who was very nice. She went out of her way to help us arrange a room. The guest room was clean. The only drawback was that the hotel was too old. The cabinet door of the room we stayed in was about to fall off as soon as it was opened. The bedside plug is out of power, and the phone buttons are faulty so I can’t make calls. It should be completely renovated. Otherwise, the price is so expensive and the facilities are not in place. How can I be worthy of this five-star brand?

The unchanging quality and consistent high-quality clothing attitude left a deep impression on us.
I am about to leave here tomorrow. When I asked my children which city in China they like best, they said Jinan without hesitation. Yihao not only represents the hotel you stay in, but also showcases the simple hospitality of the city of Jinan.

msg:Facilities: Although the hotel is old, the facilities are well maintained, but it is still very good to be picky. The only thing is that the floor heating was too hot like a steamer. I didn't sleep well all night. I didn't want to bother sending a humidifier at two or three o'clock in the middle of the night.

Service: The service is considerate, from the front desk to the staff encountered, they are enthusiastic and respond to customer needs in a timely manner.

Breakfast: The scenery is very good. You can have a bird's eye view of the central scenery of Jinan. The revolving restaurant can be viewed from different angles. The breakfast is okay.


Environment: Close to the scenic spot, with shopping malls nearby.

The young man at the executive lounge was very enthusiastic and the food was exquisite. I wanted to eat a little before going out to a restaurant, but ended up finishing dinner in the lounge. The hotel is in a good location. It is very close to Jinan's places of interest. If you want to go shopping, there are many famous stores nearby. Not far from the door, there is a snack street. The front desk and doormen were very nice. Highly recommended hotel.

Things in the bathroom are in a mess. It doesn't feel intrusive at all! As soon as you enter the room, you can step on the crumbs of instant noodles or other snacks.

The room is completely different from the picture. There is no collapse in the luxury hotel. There is a large round table in the middle and there is very little space for activities.

The key is that when I asked about the late check-out policy the next day, the waiter refused and said that there are many tourists now. If we check out late, it will affect the check-in of subsequent tourists and affect the cleaning. My friend is not a tourist, or is your hygiene really cleaned?

It is not recommended to stay at all. You spend the price of a luxury hotel, live in an old and small environment, feel the facilities of a budget hotel, and enjoy the services of a hotel. The experience is too bad.

The hotel housekeeper was very considerate in starting the turndown service and also gave us an extra small gift and welcome fruit. Thumbs up! I have to make a complaint about the hotel swimming pool. The changing room is too small. Even two people changing clothes feel cramped. Sofitel is not willing to spend money😥. I had the same problem at Sofitel Hangzhou before. The breakfast is rich in variety, with local Jinan characteristics. The revolving restaurant has a unique view. Pancakes, sweet foam, small wontons and scallion pancakes are recommended. All in all, Sofitel Jinan is very cost-effective and worth recommending!

msg:I just stayed in the same room for 2 nights on July 3. At that time, my parents had a good impression of Jinan because of this hotel. The location is good, the service attitude is good, the room is big, and the revolving restaurant can see Daming Lake and Baotu Spring. Qianfo Mountain and other scenic spots. At night, I turned down the bed to deliver a mask. At that time, the online review asked why it was only open for one day. After all, there are too many hotels that are fighting for hardware. There are too few soft services, and the hotel's reply is also very pertinent. So when I passed by Jinan with my friends at the end of July, I chose Sofitel without hesitation, and I chose the same room type. It's a pity that this time, except that the house price has increased by 400 from the beginning of the month, it's okay to have no services. On the afternoon of the 30th, it rained heavily. We checked in at 3 o'clock, and the 4 adults and 2 children were soaked. Then I was told that the room is not out yet... Let's go to the lobby, drink cold drinks, blow the air-conditioning... Thank you so much.

As soon as I got off the bus at the hotel, ALEX saw me trotting with my child in my arms and carrying my luggage. He helped me carry my luggage to the front desk and quickly checked us in. Because the child and the elderly are traveling together, it is suggested that we add money to upgrade the big suite, and thoughtfully call my parents' room to send a footbath, and send bathrobes, slippers and toys to the child. The planned half-day tour route is streamlined and reasonable. Facts have proved that the value for money is excellent, the room is clean and hygienic, the big bathtub that the child likes and the fitness equipment I want are available. The afternoon tea in the executive lounge and the happy hour in the evening are delicious and delicious, and you can see the Golden Buddha in Qianfo Mountain. The young lady in the lounge is also warm and considerate, even if the child is pestering the young lady, she is unwilling to leave😂.
When leaving, the sales manager Zhang Ruizhi helped to check out the room and took the luggage to the parking lot to help us pack the luggage and guide the exit. I can do my best without any airs.
Thank you for your service and enthusiastic help, which made us feel the hospitality of this city, and the trip to Jinan ended perfectly.

The old five-star hotel is not for nothing. It is quite satisfactory. There are small changes and surprises, and I have to thank the beauty at the front desk for arranging a room on the 37th floor. The windows are not big, but you can directly see the panoramic view of Quancheng Square and Daming Lake. The Chaoran Building is very beautiful after the lights are on!

msg:Let’s talk about check-in first: Although I stayed in a non-smoking room, the room the front desk arranged for the first time smelled very strong of smoke. As a non-smoker, I was pushed out directly; I dragged my suitcase to the front desk to change rooms. The room continued to smell of smoke; I went to the front desk to change rooms with my slippers and luggage again, and finally found a room without the smell of smoke. Another point is that the room I stayed in had welcome fruit. I changed rooms several times, but I didn't see the welcome fruit. The details need to be improved.
Hygiene: For an "old" hotel, the equipment is relatively old, but there are uncleaned candy wrappers in the room, which should not be.
Environment: The room is very quiet, but there is a slight musty smell in the room.
Service: Full marks, impeccable.
Equipment: For a hotel that was renovated in 2013, the equipment does not keep up with the trend. I want to open the door to get some air, but it is difficult to fully open the door and fix it. When I washed in the morning, the hair dryer stopped working, and I asked the staff to change it (the replacement is very efficient).
Summary: I love and hate this hotel. What I love is the service and brand effect of the old hotel, the enthusiastic service, and the quiet accommodation environment; but the decoration is relatively old, and the detailed service is still not in place.

The one point deducted for the facilities is that the set-top box behind the TV crackled and ignited when checking in, and the TV could not be watched normally. Although it was very considerate to help us change the room, I think it is necessary for guests to ensure that the room infrastructure is good and available before checking in. Also there was hair left in the toilet. The paintings hung crookedly, killing obsessive-compulsive disorder. The revolving restaurant has a nice view, which is indeed a bonus for breakfast.

In addition, the shower gel and shampoo have become the kind that cannot be taken off on the wall, which is fine.

4. There are too many people eating breakfast, and there should be countermeasures.

What I want to say is that during the Spring Festival, the entire hotel in Jinan did not increase the price. During the Spring Festival, the equivalent hotels in Xi’an are around 3,000, and the hotels in Jinan are around 500-800. "Hospitality in Shandong" is real.

The revolving restaurant is a unique existence on the edge of Quancheng Square. It is unique to see the scenery and sunrise from a high place.
The service is attentive and attentive. Going home during the Chinese New Year, a group of 5 people and a small friend chose to stay in Sofitel halfway, and booked 2 standard rooms. Manager Lin saw that we were bringing children, so he upgraded the two rooms to parent-child rooms, took us to the room, and gave us fruit. The parent-child room is larger and has a sofa bed, so the little ones can sleep independently.
When I went back to the room at night, I ran into the room manager in the elevator. The room manager was extremely professional and enthusiastic. He greeted us immediately, asked if we needed help, and sent us toys and water.
The best choice for business, tourism, and parent-child reservations, see you next time
I checked out on the morning of the 30th Chinese New Year, very happy ~ thank you ~ ㊗ everyone safe, happy and happy in 2023 ~

The drinking water and toiletries in the room are very average and should not be used in a hotel of this level. I remember living in Sofitel about four or five years ago and it didn't feel so bad. However, the price is not expensive now, which may be the reason why the equipment decoration of the old hotel is a bit old. At least I will not consider this place when I come to Jinan in the future.

①Walk 600 meters to Kuanhouli (Kuanhouli is a pedestrian street, full of national delicacies, just walk to 12:00 pm), Shimao Square;
②Walk 400 meters, and stroll into the Huancheng Park;
③ Walk about 1.8 kilometers to Daming Lake Park (free)
④ 6 kilometers to Shandong Museum, there is a bus at the entrance; please pay attention to the name of Jinan bus station, such as Heping Road Shanda Station, Heping Road Shanshi East Station, Heping Road Lishan Road Station... , pay attention to the difference between the station names;
❺Special reminder, try to take online car-hailing, subway, etc. when leaving Jinan Station.
The cost of taking a taxi in Jinan is the same as that in Beijing, and the cost performance is not good!
【hotel service】
①The hardware facilities are all standard in five-star traditional hotels. The rooms are quite large, and the beds, linens, sofas, and storage space in the deluxe rooms are comfortable and reasonable!
②It is also very suitable for business negotiation!
③ The hotel is very generous, and there is no pretense with customers. The bottled mountain spring water is generous and unlimited (after all, it is Quancheng). Tea making is very good! ;
④The bath towel is big, new and soft! The service staff are friendly and thoughtful, actively interacting with information on weather, clothing, traffic, etc., and also met the beautiful, warm and thoughtful front desk lady, Miss Yang!
⑤ (There is no USB socket in the room, you can borrow it from the concierge, and see how the robot mobilizes the delivery [呲食])
[Breakfast] I described the breakfast features of the revolving restaurant on the 49th floor in detail in another article! It is important to mention that there is also a special area for members of Accor Heart Rewards!
[Suggestion] It is recommended that rooms on the 35th floor and above of the hotel should be equipped with a simple kung fu tea set, and the functions of business rooms should be strengthened!

I have stayed at Sofitel several times, and I have a good impression. This time I took my children to Daming Lake and Baotu Spring. I chose a swimming pool hotel. With this one, I booked for 2 days. Very disappointing result.
Let's talk about the service first: I arrived at the store at 12:15, and said that the check-in can only be done at 14:00. There is only one uncleaned standard room, and you can put your luggage first. After receiving the room card to put the luggage, I found that the room is very small (the distance between the two beds is 30 cm, and the outer side of the bed does not exceed 50 cm). The front desk stated that the standard rooms are the same and do not have to be changed. Put down the box to eat, and came back to see a standard room that was being cleaned. The bedroom was bigger. I asked the front desk if I could change this room type. . .
Let's talk about the facilities: the air conditioner doesn't work, and the indoor temperature is always 27 degrees. When I came back the next afternoon, I found that there was an abnormal noise at the air-conditioning port. I came to a master to repair it. They said that a wire was caught on the fan. I asked him to fix it so that it would not break again in the middle of the night. It was after 8 p.m. that day, and it was broken again. The whole family was dressed, and the master repaired it again for 15 minutes. . . 2 repairs see photos
Then there is the hygiene: the cleaning is too general, the dust on the windowsill is wiped half, there is soot on the bedside table, and the air outlet of the air conditioner is not dirty. Look at the photos.
Finally, there is false propaganda on Ctrip, saying that it is a sauna hot spring coupon, but it is actually a swimming pool, and it is free when you check in. The food and beverage coupons sent by Ctrip are also available at check-in, and others have one more. . .

The room is dimly lit, the windows are small, and the equipment is outdated. Look at the quilt core in the quilt cover, the whole is a yellow urine stain. Cleaning needs to be called many times to remind, and finally changed to scolding to change the quilt. You still have the face to charge thousands of dollars a day for such a room? Do you take the tourists as a big deal? The only good thing is that the breakfast is ok! I won't come again, I strongly despise this kind of black-hearted businessman who makes money with unscrupulous conscience!

The hotel rooms are very comfortable, especially the welcome fruits in the hotel. It is very intimate and makes people feel warm in this cold winter. The most comforting thing is that the top-level revolving restaurant has breakfast with many varieties. While tasting the food, you can also enjoy the beauty of Spring City. In short, in this price hotel, the price/performance ratio is high, and I will stay next time.

The person who checked in at the front desk is Wang Yan or Wang Yan. It is not very sure. It seems to be the manager on duty. We upgraded a suite to us. The children saw the desserts in the lobby bar of the hotel. They were exquisite. They bought one that tastes good and likes the style of the lobby bar. It feels very fashionable and relaxing. The revolving restaurant does have its own characteristics. I have heard of it. , The first experience, the scenery, the service is great, I feel that the dishes can be better. I queued in the lobby when I checked out. It was the manager on duty or the salesman who ran into the hotel. I don’t remember, it’s called Zhang Qiang. Let us go very enthusiastically. Wait a moment in the lobby bar, send the bill to confirm, and then send the invoice back. It feels like we are VIPs. In short, a very good trip to Jinan, I highly recommend the humanistic care of this hotel

Breakfast during the stay and happy hour in the executive lounge in the afternoon are also provided. The executive lounge manager was particularly enthusiastic and introduced us to local attractions and hotel facilities and services. The thunderstorm weather in Jinan happened that night. The manager advised us not to go out for fear that the signs and trees on the roadside would blow down and affect our lives. The executive lounge supervisor is also super good, because we have a special preference for red wine, the supervisor will try to meet the needs of the guests, and serve with a smile throughout the process. The auntie who cleaned the hotel was clean and tidy. I am very satisfied. I will stay at Sofitel Ginza when I come to Jinan in the future.

msg:Booked a family room, including two breakfasts 1188 a day. Taking mothers and children on a trip originally thought that the five-star hotel is a little safer, but in my heart, I think it is the hardware and four-star service of three and a half. Hygiene is still not quite satisfactory. There was a water leak at the coffee table and sofa in the room, and it was not the first time it leaked, but it was leaking again. . . The child accidentally smashed a goblet and told him to compensate 26. The cost was 22, but the financial accounting required 26 yuan. Breakfast is in the revolving restaurant on the 49th floor. The price of the meal is well-regulated and the price of 178 does not match, and there are too few waiters, chaos, and no position. Fortunately, the young lady at the front desk who checked in was very nice. Hearing that the room leaked, the child's goblet compensation was exempted. The attitude of the service staff at the swimming pool is super nice. But the pool water temperature is 24° lower. The geographical location is not far away but not close. As a whole, I have to improve in all aspects, or I am really sorry for the names of Five Stars and Sofitel Ginza. Next to it are Ginza luxury goods. . . To be honest, if next time I will choose Intercontinental.

The service is commendable 👍My husband is especially able to drink water. The four bottles of water in the hotel are not enough. It is always troublesome to ask the waiter for it. So I bought some water myself. The waiter on the 24th floor cleaned the room and saw it. Water, you can see the intentions, bit by bit changes, waiters can see in their eyes. Although the facilities are not new, the software has made up for the defects of the hardware, and I will choose here next time.

The sound insulation of the room is very poor, the room I stayed in was the sound of running water from the sewer pipes at night.
Speaking of breakfast, it really does not match the five-star, the arrangement is messy, and the ground is greasy.

msg:I may have booked this hotel because my head was squeezed by the door that day. I thought with my head that it would not be too comfortable to live in such an old hotel, but I didn't expect the experience to be more sour.

1: Because I stayed with my mother and booked a standard room after dinner, I came back and opened the door of the concierge. The smell was the strong smell of the floor drain. I contacted the front desk to find someone from the engineering depar**ent to take a look and said it was true. It may be due to lack of water. Because the whole room was still filled with a very disgusting smell, because the small bathroom in the room was very close to the bed, I asked the hotel to change the room, but I can say that the front desk person who answered the phone and the person who took me to change rooms did not express any apology or greetings ? Taking me to change rooms while playing with my mobile phone is also a special service of your hotel?

2: I was very unlucky. I found that the toothbrush in the cleaning supplies box was torn in the changed room. I contacted the front desk again and asked for a replacement of a full set of cleaning supplies. I suspected that they did not clean the room well. I was taking a shower, and I heard to replace it. The eldest sister of the cleaning supplies asked us that this is impossible. Did we tear it apart and forgot something... It means that I won the lottery today, and I have encountered something that has never happened in your hotel in a hundred years? Is it so hard to say sorry when you enter the door and say maybe the colleagues in the housekeeping depar**ent are negligent? ?

3: That's it, I thought the story between me and Sofitel ended like this. After all, French hotels are so cold, but what I want to say is that if you are cold in Paris, it doesn't matter. In China, you Should it be so out of date? This last incident made me really want to give you a bad review. I was in a hurry when I checked out that day, and I didn't issue an invoice. I contacted the hotel and asked if I could issue an invoice. Should I pick it up next time or what? The beautiful lady who answered the phone was very professional, which made me give up the idea of giving this bad review for a while. She helped me with the invoice very efficiently and said that she could help me by mailing it. But when I received the express, I found out that it was a SF Express delivery. What happened? It doesn't matter if you pay on delivery, can you tell me in advance so I can leave a convenient address? Send it to my mother and the elderly will not use the express cabinet to pay the courier fee.

To sum up, the management of this hotel is really rotten to the root. I don't understand why such a hotel can be rated as five-star. Anyway, I will not stay again. I will change it immediately the next day. I have stayed in a hotel that I am very satisfied with. In fact, I have stayed at the InterContinental Hyatt Blue Horizon Yuhua for the first time and encountered such a poor five-star.

Hotel photos aren't worth taking, so if you don't have one, just look at the flickering bathroom lights.

酒店的頂層旋轉餐廳吃早餐也是非常不錯的體驗。

衞生：衞生沒得説，每天打掃的也很及時，雖然為了環保床品一客一換，但是特殊要求阿姨也打掃的很勤快。
環境：環境雖然沒有現代簡單時尚，但是也能看得出當年的輝煌，整體風格沉穩大氣。周邊配套完善，可以直接進入銀座購物，樓下還有超市非常方便。
服務：最值得一提的是服務，從下車到入住，每一位服務人員都禮貌問候。熊 經理 非常盡職盡責，一些小的問題和需要也積極解決。服務態度非常好。
總的來説這裏還是非常推薦來濟南旅行的遊客選擇，停車出行都很方便，既在市中心，又不那麼擁擠，性價比很高！

第二天早上還送了歡迎水果和中餐廳西餐廳的滿減券。
早上起來才發現這裏地理位置優越，旁邊就是銀座，走路十幾分鍾到大明湖、恆隆廣場、寬厚裏、曲水亭。再一次慶幸自己換酒店了。千佛山也很近，騎車幾分鐘就到了。
過了幾天沒想到還收到了酒店司經理的回訪，因為太晚入住，擔心有什麼特殊情況。大山東果然熱情好客，好感度爆增。希望酒店越來越好。

2.前台主動給升級了套房，安排在了36樓，窗外就可以俯瞰大明湖，可惜天氣不太好，霧霾比較嚴重，如果好天氣應該特別漂亮。
3.早餐在頂樓旋轉餐廳，可以坐着看整個濟南城市風景。
4.服務人員都很熱情，不管是門口停車的保安師傅，還是接待的人員，早餐安排座位的服務人員，都非常不錯。過了幾天，酒店司經理還特地打電話詢問服務是否有什麼不滿意的地方，看出來是認真在經營酒店。
5.如果可以，儘量不要節假日出來旅遊，人實在太多了，玩的太累。

重在服務還算可以，有求必應吧。
歡迎水果比較敷衍。四種水果一樣一個，沒洗的。

設施比較舊了，但是維護的還可以。房間大小還可以，功能設定也算合理。就是房間光線真的比較暗。
泳池的水26度，在這個季節太冷了。
客房服務不錯，及時！
早餐很豐盛，景觀是一大亮點。
地下車位是和商場共享的，比較緊張。

酒店房間小而且感覺有些潮濕，有異味。用過大堂裏的衞生間，臟的沒法看。

一個酒店墮落成這樣真是無語，服務基本就談不上了。

酒店的硬件設施一般，設施老舊，房間不通風，衞生間換氣設施也不好，導致吸煙樓層的煙味順着煙道串到了禁止吸煙樓層，因為帶着孩子所以要求了開窗通風，客房服務的女經理及時處理解決了這個問題。
早餐種類很一般，能吃飽，第一天去的時候每個桌上都殘留着用餐後的殘渣和污漬，轉了一圈找了個相對殘渣少的地方坐下了，第二天相對好些。豆漿是水沖的那種，不知道是兑了多少水，完全沒有豆漿味道

我自己住的那個房間首先是馬桶壞了，然後是洗漱間推拉門根本就推不上，燈光太暗了，浴缸上的架子一碰就掉了，房間真是太舊了.
早餐非常一般，和五星級酒店很不匹配。
唯一的優勢就是地理位置好，去趵突泉大明湖都可以走着去.

msg:在評價之前，我大體瀏覽了一下大家的評價記錄，我不想因為我個人的一些看法，對酒店有負面的影響，但是看了大家的評論，感覺跟我一樣觀點的還是很多，

1. 衞生：酒店應該很多年了，房間的設施老化很厲害，地面地毯，洗手間大理石麪很臟，不穿拖鞋的話，一步都不想走。49樓的旋轉餐廳，更臟，很影響食慾的。
2. 服務：前台服務中規中矩，沒有5星級的LEVEL。但是最讓人難以忍受的49樓的晚上自助餐廳服務，基本上大部分人都是帶着情緒在工作，各種詭異的眼神看你，各種愛搭不理的，很難讓人理解這是一家五星酒店。
   地下車庫的清潔工作人員，搞的環境烏煙瘴氣，諮詢個出口方向，還不搭理你，地下車輛管理混亂，無語啊。
3. 質量：服務質量上面説了，吐槽一下49樓的菜品，先不説價格，吃了一次就不想吃第二次，火鍋居然都是用合成肉。房間內的洗漱用具，很讓人傷不起，牙刷用完後，牙齦發炎。，好難受。。

看着牆上的五星牌子，五味雜陳，是不是應該摘牌了。

總而言之，非常不好的體驗，

msg:濟南親子游首選，海底小縱隊主題是孩子的最愛，入住體驗很nice。酒店位置很棒，距離各個景點都不遠，可以步行可以開車，但開車可能不如步行快，節假日的堵車真的很崩潰。酒店衞生中規中矩，服務禮貌熱情，停車比較方便。早餐與同級別酒店相比略顯薄弱。頂層旋轉餐廳值得一去，俯瞰泉城廣場，遙望千佛山，看大明湖、超然樓燈光亮起，全城景色盡收眼底。

區位：市中心酒店，離黑虎泉最近，趵突泉，泉城廣場都不遠。因為過節會很堵，我都是帶着孩子走到各個景點的。
1、49層旋轉餐廳是亮點，1小時40分鐘轉一圈，早餐建議8點30前去，風景不錯。
2、服務整體還可以
3、整體設施很陳舊，因為高不能開窗，不知道有沒有新風。

msg:我訂的是高級大床房，房間並不大，尤其是房間裏的大床，並不是一張大床，而是兩張單人床拼對到一起的大床，拼接的床，中間拼縫凹陷，睡起來肯定不如整張大床舒服，感覺很不好。入住時並沒發現，第二天一早起來因為床中間拼接凹陷，睡得很不舒服，才發現所謂大床是兩個單人床拼接而成。床尾還沒有凳子。這五星級酒店？這次入住，感覺很不好

這是我們第二次入住這家飯店，第一次感覺很好所以這次沒猶豫就訂房，沒想到服務差很大.訂了家庭房安排在2401,在房間內隨時都可聽到電梯的聲音影響到睡眠.退房時要取回押金耽誤一些時間因為前台不熟悉連機器都用錯.
結論：此Sofitel 是五星飯店卻沒有五星服務令人失望.我住過服務最好的Sofitel 是在法國馬賽，有機會請大家試看看比較一下.

酒店在銀座mall，B1層有超市和餐廳。地段相當好，可步行泉城廣場、趵突泉 、解放閣、黑虎泉。mall旁邊的佛山街直通千佛山；向北走半小時就是大明湖。
咖啡吧的馬卡龍和蛋糕很不錯，孩子吃了一盒讚不絕口，走的時候，又買了一盒帶走。

頂層49層旋轉餐廳的自助早餐還算豐富，西點做的好些，中餐稍差，冰塊上鎮的酸奶不錯，口感很細嫩，不要錯過。
酒店在管理上有些細節還是不太到位的，例如：衞生間的智能馬桶不太好用，牙刷多放了一把梳子卻忘記了。總體感覺不如西安索菲特，當然西安索菲特是僅有的幾家傳奇系金鑽級的。

體重稱壞的！
房間窗户特小，不能舒適地欣賞窗外風景！
卧室空間太小了，感覺廁所比房間還要大，好奇怪的比例！
一級棒的：酒店有自助早餐，49樓的旋轉餐廳，選擇挺多的，12歲以下小孩不用收費
位置很好，離趵突泉 大明湖 芙蓉街 寬厚裏都不遠，住了兩晚我們都可以逛逛吃吃不一樣的地方

msg:第一次住濟南的五星酒店，之前在歡朋，四星雅朵都住過，可能是期望太高了，酒店大堂沒有水吧或者咖啡機 房間乾淨但是設施太老了！電視無法投屏 不智能。 幸虧早餐有咖啡不然就瘋了。 公共區域沒有什麼香氣，可能因為疫情節省了不必要開支吧。 停車問題不大。
