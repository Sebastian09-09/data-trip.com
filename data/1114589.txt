The room service cleaning lady who helped us with some amenities was so cheerful and very kind. She definitely deserve praises (UNA ZHAO).The panorama resturant still remains the best fine dining spot in HZ. Our butler (Leon) was also cheerful and made the diner experience more pleasant. The À La Carte menu has a lot of great meals to choose from. Also the breakfast selection has a lot to choose from, great value for money. Only 1 disappointment the main Jacuzzi is still not functioning, though one can still use the ones in either men’s or women’s changing room. Definitely coming back!!!

Me and my girlfriend we asked more then one time help with our necessities in the room and the service was ready and fast at helping us with any issue. More, the guy at the reception , Edward , was more the nice. When I asked extra pillows , he told me what kind I would like cause they have hard and soft one. And when I asked if I could have a late check out, he immediately and gently replied I could leave at 15.00. And held this conversation in perfect English, something that in this country is really rare to find even in the 5 stars hotel. The best hotel you can stay in Hangzhou . Thanks to all the staff

I accidentally left some of my valuable belongings in the hotel and despite repeated calls to the hotel on +86 (571) 2823 7777 which costed me more than 100 USD, they noted my email address as well but never got back to me and did not respond to any of my messages and their intent seems clear. This looks like nothing short of daylight theft and i did not expect this from a Marriott hotel in China.

They should remove the picture of the Kids play area on trip.com as it is not opened.  These days in Hangzhou has been hot and we were unable to get our room temperature lower than 28 degrees. We were sweating  the whole time until it got to 25 degrees c. Unfortunately, we didn't get to enjoy the wonderful quilt.  Also, the main jacuzzi was dirty. There were black materials floating around and spit floating around. We asked the life guard to clean the spit. Other than that, great hotel.

We were delighted by the free upgrade to VIP Club privileges, we enjoyed our time relaxing and feasting at the lounge and lobby practically all day. Staff are truly commendable for their generous and heartwarming service at the facilities and everywhere within the hotel. 
Facilities are also easily accessible and pleasant. We enjoyed the pool, jacuzzi and sauna room very much. There was also the salon, spa and gym that we didn't have enough time to visit unfortunately. 

Would love to stay there on a regular basis.

msg:I rarely give such a low rating to a hotel on Ctrip. But to be honest, this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in for more than 3,000 yuan.
1. When checking in, the front desk's attitude was like I owed him money, and when I was in the hotel lobby every day, they also interrogated prisoners.
2. The hotel room equipment is aging, especially the circuit. I booked the second most expensive room after the presidential suite, right? The power supply was always off. The air conditioner automatically turned hot and cold.
3. The supporting service attitude was extremely poor. I wanted to have a spa, but when I arrived at the hotel's spa, the front desk frowned and acted as if I had offended him. He didn't even ask, and directly said that the lobby was upstairs, and didn't ask if we had a spa.
4. I won't say anything else. The view of this room is the only thing I like a little bit. The rest is definitely not worth the price!

The view of the river is particularly good, and you can also see the big lotus. It is not far from Shazhichuan Square, where you can watch the light show at night. The room was very quiet. Although there was a small episode, the hotel room manager Chen Huiru contacted me in time and was very enthusiastic to solve it. I felt the intentions of the hotel management and will definitely stay in this hotel in the future.

msg:It was the first time to stay at Greentown Hotel. Before check-in, I communicated with the front desk of the hotel. The front desk staff was very enthusiastic. When they learned that we had elderly people, they took the initiative to introduce the hotel rooms and upgraded the room type for us. The so-called luxury hotel we booked in Hangzhou before had very stiff front desk service, which was far from Greentown's initiative to consider the needs of guests. So we decided to stay at Greentown. Although our time in Greentown was very short, we felt the warmth of home everywhere since we arrived at Greentown. My parents are both octogenarians. As soon as they got off the car, the hotel staff helped them. For breakfast, the service staff peeled the food before giving it to the elderly. It was great! We will come to Greentown again!

msg:This time, I chose to stay in Hangzhou for one night at the end of the May Day holiday, mainly for the parent-child trip with my sister. Hangzhou is very close, and I have been there many times, but most of them were business trips or solo trips. This time, I took my sister on a parent-child trip, so I was very cautious in choosing the hotel, considering that my sister liked it and the comprehensive environment should be outstanding. This time, I compared many first-line hotels in Hangzhou, including Lakeside Grand Hyatt, Park Hyatt by Qiantang River, West Lake State Guesthouse, and Marriott's Greentown Zunlan Qianjiang, etc. In the end, I chose Greentown Zunlan to give it to my sister for the last night of the May Day trip. The check-in experience is very good, with a stylish and simple hotel design, a large lotus view by the Qiantang River, and a good quality buffet breakfast. The most worthy of recognition is the warm service of the hotel. Before checking in, I added the service center Felicia WeChat. The whole process of the butler service is very considerate. The best view room was arranged in advance according to the needs, and the children were prepared with toiletries and bathrobes. The check-in at the front desk is also very good, as if Jinna left a good feeling. It feels like home, parent-child and vacation are worth recommending, and the surrounding transportation is also very convenient. But there are two shortcomings: 1. There are few underground parking spaces. There are automatic lift parking spaces, but there is no human guidance for operation; 2. Self-driving vehicles need to go to the front desk to enter the license plate number every time they enter and exit. Sometimes they forget, which is not user-friendly. I hope it will get better and better, and I will choose it next time.

Environment: The overall environment is clean and tidy. See the picture for the scenery, and I feel happy when I wake up in the morning. The room type is exactly the same as the introduction.
Service: Satisfied. There was an episode. One day I forgot to turn off the Do Not Disturb function and did not put a small piece of paper to clean. As a result, someone was asked to clean it at night. Although it was late, the elder sister still cleaned it very cleanly. Here I hope the front desk will call to confirm whether it needs to be cleaned after a while.
Food: The buffet is delicious.

The happy hour in the lobby is great and the food is delicious, including the desserts. The buffet on the 22nd floor is also good and cost-effective. It has hot pot, seafood, cooked food, desserts, noodles, and Teppanyaki.

The most commendable thing is Ella Shang, the lady at the front desk. She is kind and kind. She made our stay very smooth and helped us upgrade to a high-rise room to make our view more perfect.

The service attitude of all the staff is the most friendly I have ever experienced in China, and they are always responsive to all requests.

The swimming pool, jaccuzi and sauna in the hotel are also very good. Go there to relax after a day of travel.

Hardware, very good, the room is large, the river view is beautiful, the blue and white color scheme is also very comfortable; the swimming pool is quite large and the water temperature is OK. 2. Food and Beverage, the Chinese restaurant has very good dishes and good service, which is impressive; the breakfast is regular, there are a lot of things, you can definitely eat enough, but it lacks characteristics; 3. Service, also impressive, first of all, the concierge only took the luggage to the front desk, and then didn't care about it. I really don't understand why. As for the front desk, it feels average. I booked a room at a high price on Ctrip, so I originally said it, but I still feel a little uncomfortable when I heard the cold answer; finally, I strongly recommend that if you arrange connecting rooms for customers, please be sure to explain that there are many people in this world who don't like the feeling of connecting rooms.

msg:During the Chinese New Year, I took my parents and children to drive around Shanghai. After staying by the West Lake for a few days, I also wanted to stay by the Qiantang River for a few days. I looked at several hotels on Ctrip. I was impressed by this one with the largest room area, so we started I got two rooms. Thank you to Miss MOLLY at the front desk for helping me upgrade our rooms to the same floor. One room has a river view of more than 70 square meters and the other one has a river view of more than 80 square meters. The room is large and comfortable to live in. I feel that the style of the room is harmonious. It's a bit like the Venetian Hotel in Macau. The room is fresh and clean in blue and white. It has an oversized wardrobe and dressing table. The night view of the river view room is beautiful. My parents are very satisfied. We have a lot of luggage and a wheelchair. The doorman is enthusiastic to help. Thank you very much for carrying it up and down to the room🙏I also want to thank Ms. Adara Chen Huiru for helping me take care of my old man who has inconvenient legs and feet. The cleaning aunt is also very polite. The service training of the hotel staff is really good, indeed It makes people feel at home👍I will stay here next time I come to Hangzhou

Hangzhou Zunlan LC is designed by internationally renowned architectural designer Pierre-Yves Rochon, with blue and white European style creating French elegance. The red lanterns on the facade and the Chinese calligraphy and painting porcelain in the corridors and guest rooms break this style and give it a proper state-guest feel.
The open-plan suite booked has a side river view and can see the Asian Games venues. For a better river view, you need to book a 270-degree corner suite.
The hotel has been open for 10 years and is well maintained. The twin beds are large enough and comfortable, and there is a dressing table in the dressing room. There is a stereo on the desk and bedside, a capsule coffee machine, and a minibar for a fee. The bathtub has a mirror TV, the bathrobes are of good quality and the products smell good.

Breakfast and service:
The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes great. You can see the river view, and the service is friendly. The breakfast extra for 80 guests/person is a great value. It's rare to find savory baked goods, such as Lin'an small walnut cinnamon buns, shrimp buns, etc.
The guest room is clean and considerate enough to provide more drinking water.

Location transportation:
It's close to the river, but the surrounding area is not as lively as the Civic Center, so it's okay to drive by yourself.

The service was well received. The front desk took the initiative to provide free breakfast for the children. The aunt who cleaned the room took the initiative to give six bottles of mineral water. We asked for a few more bottles the next day without any problems. Guests staying at the hotel also have free parking, which is suitable for self-driving.

Another thing to praise is the breakfast. The breakfast room on the 22nd floor not only has a beautiful view, but also has rich food and good taste. It is worth coming back next time.

The front desk learned that I was bringing my mother to watch the Asian Games venues and light shows, and helped me upgrade to the 16th floor. I was very grateful to him. Unfortunately, I forgot to look at my badge and didn't know his name. Everything in the room is well designed. You can enjoy the view of the Qiantang River from the floor-to-ceiling windows. At 19:30 in the evening, you can enjoy the light show on the opposite side of the room. After 15 minutes, my mother said that she finally saw the houses and the big lotus that the digital people walked past. Mom We are happy when we are happy. All staff in the hotel are very dedicated, including reception staff, room service staff, and restaurant staff. Everyone we met was very NICE. Thank you for making my mother’s trip to Hangzhou after the Asian Games a reality! Special thanks to Ms. MAX SONG from the restaurant. I left my tea cup on the table and she ran all the way to the elevator to deliver it to me. Good environment, good service, worthy of the word luxury!

The stay was great value for money, and the lady ADAMA CHEN at the front desk was very patient, as she even gave us cakes and fruits for our birthdays (although I knew that birthdays would be treated well when staying in a hotel of this level, but I still felt like we were valued). The room is Tiffany blue, very beautiful and elegant. It feels very new and very clean. The hotel was opened in 2014, so it should be well maintained! The only drawback is that our shower couldn't stop dripping at night so I had to put it on the floor. The hotel lobby door is a bit small and difficult to find when taking a taxi. It's not elegant enough, but it doesn't matter if I'm in a good mood~~ Qiantang River, the perspective of the Asian Games Lotus, and a high-end feel Laman~Happy birthday, my wife was very excited and enclosed a handwritten thank you note!

Although the hotel is a bit old after ten years, it is still well maintained. There is no strange smell in the room, and the ventilation and lighting are top-notch. Overlooking the south bank of the Qiantang River, the main venue of the Asian Games.
The location is very convenient. Get off at the 6th stop of East Station Line 4 and walk there in 10 minutes. The new area next to it is very quiet. It is very pleasant to go for a walk along the Qiantang River in the morning.
Just one way to West Lake is Jiuxi Shuyan, and Qianlong Road is to Long Boutique Tea, which has a unique charm.
Will choose next time.

The view from the breakfast area is even better. It is recommended that the half-open curtains in the breakfast area can be fully opened for a better view. If the light intensity is considered, the curtains can be divided into half-open and fully-open curtains for guests to choose. It is estimated that most people will choose the area with a better view most of the time.

The location is pretty good and very close to Vientiane City.
The food served in the guest room is also quite delicious.
The environment is naturally in line with the price of the hotel. The scenery is very good and the view is broad (a good place to stay during the Asian Games)
The most important thing is the service! ! I love it so much. The guy who opens the door outside the lobby has a sharp eye and is very energetic. He beats most luxury hotels in a flash. The surprise started in the evening. Adara Chen Huiru from guest service learned about my friend’s birthday and prepared a fruit plate and red wine for him. This kind of service really touched my heart when we were not informed in advance. When I left, my friend gathered the wool belt of the hotel. After taking away the toiletries, Adara found out and asked for the address so they could send us a set. It was amazing. The series of countermeasures were far beyond the price of the hotel. I couldn't help but write a review to praise Adara. I saw that China's hotel industry can still be saved, so I immediately booked a room for the weekend and stayed there again.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed in this hotel. The decoration style of Jianou is comfortable. I booked a room with river view. The view of Qianjiang River is pleasant. Personally, I think the biggest feature of the hotel is that apart from the decoration, the room is large, and the double bed is 1.5 meters. The quality of disposable products is obviously higher than that of other five-star hotels, and the multiple bath towels are very user-friendly. I have always felt that it is difficult to accept two bath towels and inferior disposable products. Of course, the service is also good, and a breakfast is provided.

It is very convenient to sweep shared bicycles downstairs, ride to the city balcony, and Hangzhou Library.

msg:When I booked the room, I went for the score of 4.8 and the river view, but the hotel arranged for me on the 5th floor, and I couldn't see any river view. The biggest regret was that I lost the meaning of booking this hotel. Let me talk about my personal feelings 1. The swimming pool and gym open at 6:30, which is great! 2. You can let the cleaning staff clean it at any time. Every time you go back to the room, it is clean and comfortable; 3. The attitude of the hotel staff is not bad; 4. The room is relatively large and comfortable! 5. The bedding is good and sleeps well. Let's talk about the shortcomings: 1. I didn't look at the details, the mold on the ceiling, the paint that fell off the table, it's a bit old; 2. The location is not particularly convenient. If you have a family trip, I'm not willing to book this hotel. It's 15 minutes away from the subway entrance Distance, it is convenient to take a taxi to go anywhere. But the disadvantage of the car is that during rush hour, you regret the traffic jam. I personally recommend that if you have children, you should choose the one near the subway entrance.

msg:When booking the room, I made a note not to use the elevator entrance. When I checked in, I found that the 5th floor was directly facing the elevator entrance. The sound of vehicles passing downstairs was clear and audible. The noise of the people entering and exiting the elevator was also very loud, so I contacted the hotel room service and told me to call before and after I wanted to change the room. Both of them said that they had told the front desk about half an hour before they contacted me. I told the situation and said I wanted a room on a higher floor without the elevator entrance. ) The higher room type does not have a bathtub. I said yes, and then he said that there would be more poles. I thought it was a pillar at first. I didn’t know what it was until the moment I opened the door. How many poles were there? It turned out to be a room for the disabled (see Figure 1). There will be a few people who agree to stay in a disabled room. I communicated again and changed the room. The front desk directly said that there was only one room with a dirty carpet, but I repeatedly said that it was not cleaned and it really couldn’t be washed off. I went to confirm the room again. The carpet was dirty. It seems that even the black sofa around the bed is full of footprints (see picture 2, 3, and 4). I went to the front desk to give feedback to them. During the communication period, there was no front office manager for nearly ten minutes to deal with customer complaints. I upgraded the room type and it is exactly the same as my original room type. Then you emphasized at the beginning that my room type is full of double beds. Is it because you are fooling the customers or what is the reason? It feels like the management level of Greentown’s own property. BTW. It’s not you who named it Luxury, you are a luxury hotel. Please, 1200 is RMB. Go and learn the service quality of hotels such as Conrad and Diaoyutai at the same price.

I checked in early in the morning. The front desk did not look up at me the whole time, and there was not a single word about you. I didn’t even smile. In Hangzhou dialect, I seemed to owe him money. I was woken up by the doorbell at around 10 o’clock (in a drunken state) and asked me if I had any laundry to send... Don’t you think this is superfluous? Because he had always booked with sales before, it was too late and he used Ctrip when he went to bed. He just happened to give a bad review. How could Diaoyutai, Conrad, Park Hyatt, and Marriott of the same level have such a thing?

The first time I stayed, the front desk gave me a 270-degree river view room. I opened the curtains and had a panoramic view of the Qiantang River. You can also face the light show at night. The overall experience is good. The breakfast on the second day is on the 20+ floor. The view is also good. There are not many types of breakfast, but there are all you need. The children are very satisfied.

The spacious floor-to-ceiling glass windows are excellent in lighting, making the elegant and noble blue emit a charming brilliance. The large twin beds are of excellent quality, delicate and soft to the touch, clean and skin-friendly, which improves the sleep quality of the guests. The hotel is humanized and offers a discount of 80 yuan per person for guests without early breakfast, which is great! The dishes at Lanting Chinese Restaurant taste good, and of course, the price is not low. This is a comfortable holiday hotel!

msg:#The name is very long, the hotel is very blue, I like it very much#
The hotel has a long name, but with The Luxury Collection, you won't be disappointed.
The inadvertent touch of blue in the room in the hotel makes me unforgettable.
The Asian Games venues not far away can be seen in the room, and I like it very much.
There is also the first-line river view of Qiantang River, which can be owned by standing in the room.
The room is open, bright and spacious, with a reasonable layout, I just like it.
￼A full set of Roca sanitary ware, and I am very satisfied with the double-pan sink.
Byredo Le chemin is exclusively available in the Luxury Collection.
The catering service is complete, and the all-day dining Chinese restaurant is worth recommending.
The breakfast is rich, the service is thoughtful, and there are local specialties early.
The fitness center, indoor swimming pool and other leisure and entertainment facilities are complete.
It is definitely the ceiling level of Hangzhou Marriott Hotel.
As the reception hotel for the 2016 B20 Summit,
and the 19th OCA Family Hotel,
￼The overall service quality is online, and the hardware maintenance is in place.
Thanks to duty manager Ceasor for his thoughtful service and thoughtful consideration,
Next time I come to Hangzhou, I still recommend The Luxury Collection.

Sitting on the first-line river view of Qiantang, the surrounding transportation is convenient. ￼Compared to scenic hotels that are congested during holidays, this one is worth recommending!

msg:Overall, it’s quite satisfactory. The current luxury hotels have more or less problems. This one has more minor problems, but the major aspects are justified. In addition, the after-stay service is not bad. Claire added WeChat, not to mention that there will be What's the effect? At least the attitude is there: We accept it humbly and hope you will come again. That's it in general, let's talk about a few details.
1. Pre-sales: As a luxury hotel of Marriott, there is no such thing as pre-sales service. There is no one-to-one butler service, and there is no concierge service before check-in, because I brought my wife to celebrate her birthday, so I hope that there will be a specialist to connect with me and arrange the layout in advance. During the period, I can only keep calling The front desk explained, but in the end the room was not reserved or furnished, which was done very poorly.
2. Check-in: We arrived at around 5 o'clock, because there was no specialist to arrange birthday arrangements with me, so I naturally didn't hold out hope for any work, but I spent the original price of the river view suite, you can give it to me A little bit of the floor is always okay, what do you mean by giving me a 6th floor? The view of the room is not as good as that of an ordinary twin room, and the front desk also pretends not to know, is it possible to upgrade the room type or what? Anyway, this is the biggest pain point this time.
3. Room: The room facilities are ok. Although there are only two bottles of water in the refrigerator, and there are not many things for washing, these problems are not big. The overall room facilities are relatively new, the bedding is very comfortable, and the rest is good. That's a compliment. But there is also a fatal problem. The air conditioner in the room is very poor, and people who are afraid of heat can’t stand it at all. Fortunately, the outdoor temperature is not high now. Later, it was explained that the hotel’s unified temperature control, so I hope it will be better in the future.
Other hygiene and services are at a normal level. If the above problems can be changed, it will be an acceptable luxury hotel. I hope you can continue to improve

msg:The hotel building is very grand, and the lobby needs to hover upwards, much like some high-end hotel designs in Hong Kong. The hotel room is very large and clean, and the facilities and supplies are also very new. The rare thing is that the bathroom has two washbasins, high and low, and there are handrails around the toilet. It should be specially set up to take care of the elderly or children with disabilities. The surrounding environment of the hotel is very quiet and beautiful , The little brother at the front desk also upgraded the river view room. He asked the reason for the upgrade and said that it was because it was an order from Ctrip. In an instant, I, an old user of Ctrip for more than ten years, finally felt a little proud. It seems that the surrounding residents also come to eat. It's about five or six kilometers away from the West Lake shopping district. Going downstairs and crossing the road is the Qiantang River. It's not too convenient to watch the tide... Anyway, it's very good, all five-star praise!

From the moment we got off the bus, the concierge greeted us warmly (the parking space is a bit small, so it’s not easy to park) and helped us take our luggage to the front desk. Hangzhou elements and porcelain can be found everywhere in the lobby. Embroidery, etc. The decoration is mainly blue and gold, and it feels a little fresh. I checked in very quickly and helped me upgrade the room. The room is very clean, and the decoration is mainly blue. You can also find Hangzhou elements everywhere. The river view is very beautiful, the view of the Qiantang River is unobstructed, the night view is also great, you can directly enjoy the light show by the riverside, and the breakfast is also very rich, basically you will have everything you want. There is also a swimming pool gym barber shop downstairs, the whole experience is still very good!

It is very close to Vientiane City and other business districts, and the taxis in Hangzhou are also very fast. The hotel starts from check-in The service was very good at the beginning, and the room is very nice and soundproof. The room has a size of 70 and has a large screen. The bedding and bathroom are very good, and the auntie cleaned it very well. On the second day of check-in, the auntie accidentally dropped the wine in the room The staff immediately contacted me. Not only did I pay for a bottle of the same foreign wine, but they also gave me a bottle of the hotel’s own good wine. When I left on the last day, I forgot the special product at the hotel. After contacting the hotel, SF Express sent it to my home immediately. All in all, 10,000 positive reviews.

msg:As Marriot's quasi-ambassador Shuai Shuai, the Zunlan luxury collection hotel series that he stayed in this time was originally Starwood, and now it is defined as the group's top luxury brand together with St. Regis, Reese, and JW. This choice is very rare in China. The three are Hangzhou, Changsha, and Nanning, but this type has a good sense of design and a good a**osphere.

I originally wanted to go to a suite this time, but I don’t know why the occupancy rate has been so high recently. I have to settle for the second best. The luxurious river view is also okay. Although it is a bit old, it is well maintained and quite new. The whole color is blue.

    The whole is very lively and aggressive, which matches my usual dressing style. The disadvantage is that it takes dozens of steps to go back and forth from the bedroom to the bathroom. I estimate that I can brush thousands of steps in a day in the room, and the toilet is not smart, which is troublesome. But it’s all minor problems. Edward at the front desk is gentle and nice, and the service is super good. My experience is like home. Brian at the concierge is very discerning and safe. Such high-quality service immediately makes the hotel experience more comfortable.

msg:I stayed on the third day of the new year and stayed for a total of four nights. The hotel occupancy rate is very high. After the end of the epidemic, the first occupancy peak period ushered in. Obviously, the hotel did not expect the sudden occupancy rate to be full. Due to the lack of support staff such as front desk staff and cleaning, we arrived at the hotel at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and checked in at 5 o'clock. During the period, there was no staff to guide us to sit in the lobby, let alone afternoon tea.
The hotel swimming pool and gymnasium facilities are perfect.
The aunt who cleans the room is enthusiastic, but enthusiasm is not enough. The ground has not been cleaned, it is full of dust left by the carpet.
The sanitation of the breakfast dining environment is very worrying, and the ground is full of food residues. It's hard to imagine that this is the standard that a luxury collection should have.
There is no problem with the hotel facilities, but the service is only at the level of a three-star hotel.
Also the wall light to the right of the dresser in my room was broken. I don't know if it has been repaired.
Finally, I hope that the hotel can stick to its own advantages and improve existing problems. I wish the hotel business is booming and getting better and better. If we have a chance, we will stay again. The service and sanitation must keep up.

msg:At sunrise, river flowers are more red than fire,
In spring, the river is as green as blue.

If you have been to Hangzhou many times like me, and you are no longer obsessed with sleeping by the West Lake, you can try sleeping by the Qiantang River like me.

The Azure Qiantang, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Hangzhou is the ceiling of Marriott hotels in Hangzhou. The hotel has an invincible view of the Qiantang River. Almost every room can see the river view. The beautiful and elegant blue color looks comfortable and warm. At night, the night view of the Qiantang River was so beautiful that I actually lay down in the hotel for a whole day and didn’t want to go out at all. I couldn’t help but sigh that a beautiful holiday life should be like this.

I booked a 270 river view room with an area of 85 square meters. The blue and white tones look elegant, with a beautiful dressing table and a gorgeous crystal chandelier, just like walking into a princess' castle. My room was arranged on the 11th floor, which is also the highest floor of this type of room. The view of the Qiantang River from the window is really shocking and the view is excellent. You can also see the river view on one side of the bathtub. The toiletries are BYREDO, the quality is very good, and the bathrobe is also very comfortable.

Catering: The hotel's breakfast is on the 22nd floor. Because it is higher than the guest room, you can see the Qiantang River view that is more invincible than the guest room. The breakfast here is very delicious and worth recommending. You can also eat all kinds of delicious ice cream and dinner I ordered room service, and Pianerchuan is really invincible and delicious. It is the best Pianerchuan I have eaten in Hangzhou.

The location of the hotel is also very good. There is a subway nearby, and it is also very close to Raffles City. When I checked in, the little brother at the front desk gave me a hotel mascot, the Chef Bear, who is so cute and chubby.

There are currently no Chestnuts or St. Regis in Hangzhou. At present, this Luxury Collection Hotel is indeed the top choice of Marriott hotels in Hangzhou. The overall stay experience is very good, and I will consider it next time I go to Hangzhou.

msg:This time I came to Hangzhou to spend the anniversary with my partner. The hotel thoughtfully made a romantic arrangement on the bed, and the pastry room also sent a delicious commemorative cake. The guy at the front desk was even more hospitable, and the service attitude was very good. Without showing the Marriott membership, he gave us breakfast for the next day, as well as a teddy bear from the hotel, which was a great surprise. The room type of the hotel is very large, the floor-to-ceiling windows are clean and bright, the view of the upper city and the river outside are very beautiful, and the night view is even more shocking. Experienced the hotel's SPA, very satisfied, highly recommended. In the evening, I ate at the high-level Chinese restaurant of the hotel. The products were excellent, and the view was wider and more beautiful than what I saw in the room. After the meal, I found out that the Chinese restaurant has been selected into the Black Pearl list every year, and the products and services are indeed worthy of the price. I personally like the sky blue style of the hotel very much. The blue sky in the lobby makes me feel like I am in The Venetian Macao. But I made two suggestions to the hotel in a picky way: 1. The packaging design of the toiletries is not reasonable, and it is difficult to unscrew the round and slippery cover when there is water in the hand; 2. The Chinese name of the hotel is too long , luxury collection is a very good brand of Marriott, there is no need to translate the Chinese name so awkwardly.
Overall the experience was perfect.

Chuqi met my mother and sister in Hangzhou. I was looking forward to the accommodation for the first trip after the opening. I looked at the hotel for two days before departure, and finally chose Zunlan. I stayed for the first time and was very satisfied~

The room is big enough. I booked a garden view room. I didn't expect that the large floor-to-ceiling windows of Nuo can still see the river view clearly. It's amazing. The toiletries provided are Byredo, which I like, and the texture is really good👍. The bedding is also very good, I didn't recognize the bed. Finally, I would like to talk about breakfast. Dining is at 22F, and Jiangjing’s business is more open. The noodles are surprisingly delicious, and the toppings are very fresh. I even drank the soup. I will go to Zunlan for this noodle next time! !

The brothers and sisters at the front desk, the restaurant, and the concierge depar**ent are all very nice and considerate, especially Edward Lu (I don’t know if I remember correctly), who still gave the best care when I checked in at night.

The theme of the hotel is blue. The wall coverings, carpets and sofas are covered with this beautiful blue color. It is high-end and unassuming, which makes people feel at ease. I personally like it very much. It also echoes the Qiantang River and the blue Qianjiang River beside it.
The concierge service is very thoughtful, and Anderson actively helped with luggage. The front desk was also very professional and fast when I checked in. Clair was very enthusiastic and helped me upgrade the room. Looking out, I can just see the river view of the Olympic Sports Center.

If you refund it, it will be refunded, and I will be deducted 80. I bought the breakfast with two, but it was said that the deduction was for breakfast, and I didn't eat breakfast for sleep!

As soon as you enter the lobby, you can enjoy the excellent blue and white tonal and elegant design. When I checked in on the first day, Gloria Huang gave a very professional service and upgraded my room to the 19th floor. The room is elegant and beautiful. There are even yoga mats and umbrellas in the room, as well as a hot water bottle that can keep warm. It is very comfortable to live in! There is also a Meituan takeaway locker downstairs, which is also close to the nucleic acid point. I will stay here next time I have a chance here!

He even upgraded me to a river-view twin room. The view is quite good! Breakfast is very cost-effective. You can get a coupon at the front desk for only 80 yuan, which is great value for money. The room is in white and blue tones, which matches the scenery of the Qiantang River very well, and the photos are also very good-looking. The hygiene of the room is very meticulous, and everything in the bathroom is neatly arranged. However, the curtains in the room are not easy to use. The switch was turned on but turned off and turned off but turned on again. After check-out, the hotel manager made a call back to ask about the check-in experience. He made some suggestions and received feedback in time. It is very good 👍🏻 Overall, the price/performance ratio is good. Will consider this hotel next time

Marriott's hotels make people feel more assured of quality. The first impression is that they are clean and beautiful, and the rooms are very cozy. Check in Claire at the front desk was also very enthusiastic and the service was very good. She kindly reminded us to pay attention to the weather when we are cooling down recently. We did not do enough strategy. Jennifer from the concierge depar**ent recommended me many local travel routes in Hangzhou. Thank you very much for their sincerity Service, great service team, fruit was delivered upon check-in, the room is even more beautiful, with a panoramic view of the first-line river, the bed is big enough and comfortable, the blue tone is very good, the area is big enough, the room is very spacious, more than average The hotel rooms are much larger, and the service staff are all answering questions, and the professionalism is very good. Generally speaking, the price performance ratio is very high, and it is worth recommending. Whether it is landscape, hardware facilities or service quality, it is a very high-quality hotel. Next time I come to Hangzhou, I will still choose Zunlan.

First of all, take a taxi to the hotel, and the little brothers and sisters who greeted the guests at the door even thought that everyone wanted to help with luggage, and did not even say a word of welcome. I thought to myself, isn't this basic courtesy, even if it's not a service industry, I'd like to smile politely. The little girl just stared at me blankly and didn't guide me to check in. When I checked in, there were a lot of people, so I waited for a while, and I was a little puzzled that the deposit was directly charged for the room fee. To tell the truth, I live in Park Hyatt Grand Hyatt or InterContinental. , no one takes a deposit of two or three thousand, is it for fear that I will steal your things or break something? The welcome fruit is also, and it will be delivered after playing in the evening. And it's not a cheap hotel, it doesn't even have a food delivery robot... I have also stayed in a budget hotel like Jiji, and even Jiji has a food delivery robot! Since there is no food delivery robot, the service of delivering a meal at the front desk is not provided. . I don't know if it should be, after all, I have stayed in other hotels, so I thought that the Greentown Zunlan I asked to advertise as a star-rated hotel also has it, but it's not too much.
But the little brother who answered the phone at the front desk was very nice.

Items left behind can help express delivery👍 Disadvantages: First of all, the welcome fruit of Ctrip Platinum membership rights and interests has not been fulfilled, and the attitude of the underground garage management staff is relatively blunt, maybe the reason is that there are too many cars and the weather is hot. The person who scans the code at the door also lacks polite words, and other staff are good. Underground garages are smaller and tend to fill up more easily. The cheapest canned Coke in the mini bar is also more expensive at 18 yuan.

msg:Every time I come to Hangzhou, I will choose to stay in this hotel. I like its large area. The service and hardware of Marriott Group are still good. This time I stayed here after a ten-day long journey. I came here for a night of rest because the hotel has spa services.
The room is still big. I arrived before noon and was given a room in advance.
However, until I went back after dinner in the evening, the welcome fruit was not delivered, and there was no night bed service.
Let's talk about the hotel spa. At the beginning, a manager's phone number was provided so that I could make an appointment in advance.
The attitude was good, and the time I needed was also arranged in time, which was very heartwarming. But because I couldn't go to the spa at the same time with my child, we had to go in two separate time periods and were told that we could not use the Qixi Festival two-person package. That's fine...
My husband wanted to have a 90-minute spa, and was recommended to use this Qixi two-person package, but I couldn't use it if I went later, so whatever...
When I went downstairs at night, the front desk asked me how long I needed to do it, and didn't introduce the price products to me. I was directly led to the room. The massage girl told me that one hour was 980 before the start of the clock... I was confused for a moment. Why was my husband's 90 minutes only more than 700, but my hour was so expensive? Later, the front desk manager was called to change the words and said that there was a voucher on ** that could get a 30% discount. When I went to **, I found that there was a 60-minute package for 380...
The spa in a five-star hotel charges so casually. This is the first time I have encountered it...
Of course, the massage girl Ranran is still very good. Her technique is very good and relieved my fatigue.

The small regret is that the carpet smells a bit heavy. The breakfast is very rich, you must go and experience it if you are not in a hurry.

Because I was tired and wanted to rest, I listened to the front desk for a double room. The room is very big, although the bed is not too small, because I like blue, so I chose this one. The room design feels very comfortable, and you can see the river view. The front desk said that I was given a gift for the first time I stayed. Breakfast, but unfortunately I didn't get up until 11 o'clock and didn't have time to eat, and the free late check-out until 2 o'clock in the afternoon was good. I hope I can stay in a double room next time and try the breakfast and dinner here.

msg:Located on the banks of the Qiantang River in Hangzhou, The Blue Hotel is a brand of the Marriott Group: The Luxury Collection. There are not many luxury collections in China. Friends recommended this hotel a long time ago, and I chose this luxury collection hotel on the last day of my stay in Hangzhou. In the past few days in Hangzhou, I have basically checked in several famous hotels in Hangzhou, and I have some clear comparisons. When I got off the bus, the concierge Brian warmly helped with the luggage. At the front desk, some guests were queuing. Fortunately, the cony check-in was not messy. As early as the beginning, my friend told me that the river view in LC is really good, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows of the room are very suitable. The only small disadvantage of taking photos and checking in with internet celebrities is that the temperature in Hangzhou is relatively high these two days, and it is a little hot to sleep at noon and at night. Compared with the CBD city view of Raffles City, I like this kind of smell more from the whole room. Especially when the curtains are opened in the early morning to welcome the sunrise and sunshine, it makes people feel good all day long! The overall style of the room is more European-style retro, and the bath is from Bai Ruide. I called the guest service center Sandy and informed me that an extra set of toiletries was given to me. It was delivered very quickly. It can be seen that the hotel depar**ent cooperates very harmoniously, with high efficiency and minimalism. The blue tone design makes people look very relaxed.

Spring travel, came to Hangzhou. This time, I also accidentally discovered a fashionable luxury hotel - Hangzhou Greentown Zun Blue Qianjiang, a Luxury Collection Hotel!
·
The hotel is located on Wangjiang East Road, Shangcheng District, Qianjiang New Town, prosperous and fashionable, facing the majestic Qiantang River view.
The design of the hotel is inspired by the scenery of "the river is as green as blue" in "Remembering the South of the Yangtze River", and the hotel with blue glass mirrors the Qiantang River.
·
The whole hotel has a blue and luxurious tone, especially the lobby, European-style sofas, European-style pianos, and blue roofs.
·
【hotel room】:
There are more than 200 various room types, the space is spacious and bright, and most of the room types face the Qiantang River view.
The most recommended is of course the 270-degree full river view king-bed room, with a super good view!
Mediterranean blue and white as the main tone, Hangzhou's local Jiangnan charm is integrated into it, modern fashion and light luxury. Complete facilities, super five-star standard! Super comfortable river view luxury vacation in Hangzhou!
·
【Hotel Dining】:
The hotel currently has Jing'an Cafeteria and River View Terrace Bar on the 22nd floor, Lanting Chinese Restaurant on the 23rd floor and a VIP Detention Club on the 4th floor.
Lanting Chinese Restaurant on the 23rd floor has a high-altitude city view and a superb view. You can eat super delicate and delicious Jiangsu and Zhejiang dishes! Must eat!
The high-altitude city view afternoon tea recently launched by the hotel is also highly recommended~
·
【Auxiliary Facilities】:
The indoor heated swimming pool designed by "Blue Sky and White Clouds" and the 24-hour gym are located on the first floor of the hotel. You can relax here without going out~

When I entered the door, I scanned the code to see the itinerary card. The epidemic prevention measures were in place. The lobby was very deserted due to the epidemic, but the service It's still very good. Before checking in, I called and asked about the epidemic prevention policy and afternoon tea. Miss Becky explained very patiently. The handsome little brother Conny at the front desk checked in very quickly, and arranged a free upgrade. The room is also very good. It's big, but the air-conditioning panel doesn't seem to work well. I went to the VIP club on the fourth floor in the afternoon. Miss Sandy was very enthusiastic to introduce us to the dishes. The desserts were really good. At night, there was not enough mineral water in the room. I would like to ask for more bottles. Guest service The phone was picked up very quickly, and the greeting was very polite. The lady's voice was very nice, and she could call my last name accurately, which surprised me. In short, this hotel makes me feel that everyone is doing service attentively. Next Will choose here again!

He took the initiative to ask if he needed help with the luggage. Like it! The check-in is very professional and fast, Austin and Young are very hospitable and the service is very good, specially introduced that I can enjoy a newly opened VIP club on the 4th floor, which can provide afternoon tea and simple buffet dinner, where you can have a drink in your spare time Have a chat and see the scenery. After going, it's really good. It's a good place to get away from the hustle and bustle and let yourself be alone. In addition to the welcome fruit in the room, there is also a free minibar drink. It's too affordable. You can also have a drink in the room while enjoying the scenery. I really like the service and decoration style of this hotel very much. Next time Will definitely stay again!

The decoration style is also my favorite blue and white color scheme! This hotel can be said to be the ceiling of Marriott service. No one who has stayed in so many Marriott hotels has such thoughtful and meticulous service as Conny Xu at the front desk! Thank you so much for a great stay experience for me and my family! There will be opportunities in the future!

The two handsome guys at the front desk, Ryan and Young, provided thoughtful service, and they also gave souvenirs of luggage tags when they checked out.

The blue and white hotel style is popular with everyone.
Every time I come, I go to a Chinese restaurant, breakfast and buffet are in a western restaurant, and recently there is a small hot pot in the evening.
I always thought the Executive Lounge was a pity here, but now it's been complemented.
The newly opened executive lounge can enjoy happy hour, that is, buffet dinner, and more than 20 kinds of drinks. It is the most suitable for business travel or a quick meal!

This time, the little brother Conny at the front desk also helped to upgrade to the river view room. From the window, you can see the sunset of Qiantang River. Thumbs up for Conny's excellent service 👍!
The location of the hotel is still relatively secret. It is quiet on the road on non-working days. The decoration of the room is stylish. It is my favorite blue sky and white clouds. The bathtub in the room is also very comfortable to lie on. Love love love! I was going to order a set from the App for my usual business trip. The hotel generously gave me a set, thank you very much! The service is very timely. Seeing that I love coffee, I will also prepare more coffee capsules and tea bags for me, which is very considerate.
I usually travel a lot on business, but during the current epidemic, from the front desk to the guest room to the restaurant, everyone wears masks without exception, giving guests a safe and secure stay.
I ate three meals in the hotel, and tried both Chinese and Western restaurants. The Chinese restaurant left a deep impression on me. It is indeed a black pearl! This time I placed an order from Ctrip. I was surprised to find that the minibar part of the room is free. Before that, it was charged, and the experience was straight-line. After all, the hotel is located in an administrative area, and there are still relatively few convenience stores at night. It is convenient to drink your favorite drinks in the room.
Overall, it is worth recommending. The Internet celebrity hotel, the scenery and the rooms are all great. I will choose LC again next time.

It looks up to the blue sky during the day, and the embroidery on the back is also very eye-catching, which shows that the hotel's taste is very good. The young brother Young at the front desk has a very good and energetic service attitude. The Austin manager arranged for a room upgrade. Then the hardware and software facilities of the hotel are very good, and the faucets and shower heads are all equipped with good brands. The Byredo shampoo and shower gel are quite good. The products are also very good, the hardness of the mattress is quite appropriate, and there are several pillows to choose from. Secondly, the things in the Club are also very good. The manager Gloria is very enthusiastic and arranged the same river view location. The food is quite plentiful and you can have a snack, which is also very satisfying. Perfect experience, thank you.

In my opinion, the hotel's service can be called St. Regis' butler-style service. After calling Betty, the switchboard, she followed up my entire stay. Conny, the guy at the front desk, checked me in. He was professional, efficient, and very handsome. Brian, the concierge guy, was also tall and handsome. He gave me my luggage in a gentlemanly manner, and Vicky from guest relations also introduced me to the VIP club on the fourth floor. I can’t praise the club enough. In the afternoon, you can drink tea quietly and laze in the sun. In the evening, many people are very lively, drinking red wine and listening to music. This is the a**osphere that the Chris**as season should have! Eve from the club also recommended dishes to me. Although there are not many dishes, it is difficult not to come again because of the excellent service. Finally, I would like to make a small comment: I hope there will be heating in the lobby next time I check in. , maybe the hotel is not ready for the cooling down at the beginning. Let me feel more warmth next time!

When I come back, I will bring milk tea to the staff. I feel like family members are very kind. Then I will share my experience of staying. When I first checked in, the air conditioner was not very cold and I was a bit unsatisfied, but the hotel customer service is still serious for the guests. To deal with the problem, at the beginning I booked a room type with river view, the bed was quite big, but of course there is no suite room, so I paid to upgrade to the special suite with full river view at the front desk, with 270° river view. Invincible praise, you can see the scenery of the Qiantang River, which is quite impressive. Secondly, you can try their Lanting Chinese restaurant, which is said to be on the black pearl list. After eating there for four days, it is still very recommended. It happened to catch up with their Double 11 event during the stay. Ryan helped me recommend the coupon for the meal. You can pay for some meals, and the event also includes some discounts on hotel daily necessities. Decisively contact customer service to order a set of take away, which is quite comfortable

    📍Geographical location: No. 39 Wangjiang East Road, it is more convenient to reach the subway station of Line 1⃣️ and 4⃣️ near the river. It is also very convenient if you drive by yourself, free parking 🅿️.

    🌟The scenery is infinitely good: when you open the curtains, you can see the Qiantang River. The scenery is really good, and it is a sense of sight on holiday.

    🌟A good place for parents and children: If you bring a baby, then Zunlan is also a good choice for you. When you book in advance, you say bring your baby. The hotel will prepare children's bathing suits, children's slippers, nightgowns, etc. It is really sweet, and the baby's favorite candy platter is really too love.

    🌟Hardware facilities are great: As a high-end hotel owned by Marriott, the hardware facilities are really great. The big bed room is too big, the supporting facilities are very good, and there are special snacks, etc., even the bath is BYREDO, which is full of high class.

    🌟VIP CLUB: It’s really amazing. It’s open from the afternoon to the evening. You can experience afternoon tea, dinner, and bistros here, and you can enter unlimited times. You don’t have to worry about nowhere to go, just go to VIP CLUB.

    🌟Buffet breakfast: The breakfast buffet on the 22nd floor of the hotel is really amazing. Not only is there a variety of varieties, but also the scenery is excellent. It is very pleasant to eat breakfast by the river.

    With a river view and a touch of blue temptation, it is really amazing to come to the Blue Qianjiang, a Luxury Collection Hotel.

When I stayed at Zunlan for the first time, I was really amazed by the blue color on the banks of the Qiantang River! The hotel is a luxury collection of Marriott luxury brands, which advertises the authority of the destination. The room is very clean and a**ospheric, with invincible river view, elegant and elegant in blue-gray tone. The facilities are very new, not at all like they have been in business for six or seven years. The service is very online. When we checked in, the handsome Edward at the front desk was proficient in business and very enthusiastic; the front office manager Joe specially invited us to experience the VIP Club. Unexpectedly, the LC brand did not have an executive lounge, but opened up such a quiet and private space. The dishes are OK and the drinks are diverse. The waiter sister Eve and the younger brother Oliver also welcomed us very warmly, caring about our staying experience and the dishes throughout the process. The bedding is very comfortable, and the accessories are very good for the niche brand Byredo. The Golden Key Peter and the concierge Brian also gave us good travel recommendations. All in all, it was a very unforgettable experience! Great 👍🏻

The room is 66 square meters, very open and bright, the curtains are electrically controlled, and there are long floor-to-ceiling windows. It's a pity that it's not a river view outside the window, so it's a little regrettable. The facilities are complete, and the disposable items are clean and hygienic.

On the day of the wedding, the wedding convoy drove to the entrance of the lobby to pick up the relatives and took a lot of photos. The hotel did not embarrass us too much about the noisy, it was very much in line with our process. We also try to keep quiet and not disturb other residents. When I finally left, I basically took away the wedding balloons and ribbons, otherwise an extra cleaning fee would be charged.

Disadvantages: 1. The facilities are relatively old, the toilet is not smart, and the carpets, sofas, walls, and furniture are more or less mottled. 2. There was a problem with the check-in connection. I arrived at the hotel at 2 pm and waited a full two hours before arranging to enter the room. Later, Manager Huang came to apologize and coordinate and gave us a piece of fruit. The refunded deposit was more than 73 yuan, I don’t know. Is it to make up for my time difference? Hope the hotel can be more perfect in management

msg:After thinking about it, I really have no choice but to write a review. Below I will describe my nightmare experience of staying for three nights from an objective perspective, not exaggerating.
We are a family of three with children staying in this hotel.
The air conditioner of the first room we arranged on the first night was broken, there was a moldy smell, and the floor was terribly dirty. We had no choice but to change our room. As a result, the toilet in the second room leaked, and the child fell when going to the toilet at night, crying and not sleeping well all night.
On the second night, we changed another room, but we couldn't fall asleep from 1 a.m., and the noise next to us was terrible. At first, I thought it was a young party with deafening music, and calling didn't solve it. Basically, a group of people came in and out every two or three minutes and made loud noises. Later, at around 5 a.m., we got angry and went over to bang the door to quiet down. Afterwards, we read the comments and found that this hotel was full of people who came to take ** or sell goods on Taobao. From midnight, one group took pictures and another group came, and people kept coming in and out.
It was finally quiet on the third night, but when I woke up in the morning, I felt itchy all over my body and had several red spots. I didn't take it seriously at the time, but it got worse after I got home. My whole body was getting more and more itchy. Later, I went to see a doctor and was told that I was bitten by fleas. I was instantly furious.
There were many more bizarre things in the past few days. I will just pick two.
1. Every day after breakfast, the room attendant kept urging us to get out quickly, saying not to delay her cleaning the room. I was petrified at the time. Is the "Do Not Clean" sign outside the door just for show? This is the first time I heard that a five-star hotel still urges guests not to stay in the room?
2. I returned to the hotel on the second night and found that the used bath towels were wet. They were put together without changing them. After taking a shower, I almost took away the smell of the bath towels. It's better not to clean the room.
To be fair, the service attitude of most of his employees is good, but the management of their hotel is terrible. If you are going to take pictures, then this place is indeed good, but if you are traveling with children or doing business, I advise you to read my comments. I am using my tearful experience to warn you all: when traveling, don’t read the good reviews, they are all fake. Read the bad reviews, they are the most authentic ones…

msg:1) When checking in, tell them that I will be in a hurry, the invoice should be prepared in advance, and the invoice information is given to them; however, the invoice has not been opened after leaving, the front desk will ask me for the invoice information again. The front desk zoe (known as duty) manager) expressed a disdainful attitude.
2) Checking in, taking a shower, smelly urine in the shower room, garbage in the bathtub; not cleaned up; the toilet lid cannot be connected to the toilet body, and the ceramic base cannot be covered at all. Sit on the bottom, half of it is on the edge of the toilet below. Cool. (I described this with the front desk when I checked out. Ms. Zoe asked me if I took pictures?! I regret not taking pictures because I only came to sleep, not to complain, and didn’t take the photo of the toilet! Of course it was also because of the photo taken early in the morning last night. The manager on duty changed my room to me, and his attitude is good. I think it’s fine to just sleep, but Ms. Zoe suggested that I make a review, saying that this is my choice, so let’s tell everyone)
3) I went to have breakfast in the morning. The order was placed at 12:04. The meal came at around 12:40. Hainanese chicken rice. The chicken was not tender or fresh; I lost it after a few bites.
4) When I checked out, I reminded the front desk that I was in a hurry, and quickly called me the duty manager to solve these messy things. However, Zoe kept dragging me, and Zoe wronged me and said that I drank their gin wine, which is simply unreasonable. Rong, first of all, I am a pregnant woman, so I can’t dip it. Secondly, who told her that I drank their gin, did the room clean and check after the previous guest left? I doubt it very much.
5) Because I was so angry, I asked her to give me my gm mailbox. I decided to write an email to tell gm. Zoe said she didn't. At my repeated request, she still asked me to wait until Micky came on duty. Fortunately, Micky's attitude made me relax, but as a luxury five-star hotel, such hardware and services are not qualified.
6) There is no concierge to pull luggage when checking in;
7) Due to the non-cooperation of this zoe, I finally changed the train ticket. This lady was not willing to return the cash to me immediately, until Micky showed up and let her finish the operation. Almost half an hour has been wasted.

msg:When I came out to travel and listened to the recommendation of a friend, I specially booked this hotel. The concierge received me very warmly. As soon as I arrived in the lobby, I was attracted by the blue sky and white clouds. The front desk was very professional and prompt to prepare the room for me, and also thoughtful inquiries. If we have any special needs, the uniforms of boys and girls are pretty good-looking, not all black suits and black trousers, but overall it matches the style of the hotel very well, haha. In fact, the hotel is in a non-central location in Qianjiang New City, but it feels like a quiet place in the middle of noisy, and the river view is just one step away. The blue European style is very eye-catching, the lighting in the room is also very good, and the tired body and mind are very relaxed. My girlfriend likes to take selfies very much. The hotel shoots are big shots, and the blue and white tones are also very popular. . It’s also worth mentioning that the brand’s toiletries are also very easy to use, and the perfume that I use is also the rose of this brand’s no-man’s land, so I have a very good impression. The food in the restaurant is also very fresh and delicious, and the breakfast food is still very rich. In short, I am very satisfied with this stay, and I will definitely recommend it to friends around me.

msg:The hotel was booked on this business trip, and I had a pleasant two nights. The front desk manager, Jacky, is very professional and service-conscious. He asked me that I was on a business trip and saw that my order did not include breakfast. He kindly gave me a breakfast. Although I was losing weight, I prepared fruit and vegetable juice and whole wheat bread. Didn't resist the temptation of a high-quality breakfast or ate for a while. Due to the fatigue of the journey and the large temperature difference between indoor and outdoor, the physical condition was not comfortable for the two days. Both dinners were called room service in the room. The high-quality meals and experience-oriented service also left a good impression on me. . I have stayed in the luxury collection hotels in Nanjing and Hangzhou and I like it very much, and will deliberately choose this brand in the future.

msg:The front desk staff of the hotel are very nice, knowing that I did not clean the room, they will take the initiative to ask if they need supplies. When I left the store, I forgot a box of bayberry in the refrigerator, and the hotel called for inquiries as soon as possible. The only two points that need improvement: 1. The river-view room I live in will hear the song of the uncle and aunt downstairs at night. It is a bit noisy from seven to ten. 2. On the last day of check-in, the next room became a wedding room, and the bridal room started early in the morning. Lasted for most of the day. In this case, should we communicate with the customers on both sides in advance to see if we will work in the room, will we be noisy, or cause inconvenience.

After giving feedback, the manager immediately reminded each other, and then he said to help me change I didn’t want to take a break and didn’t change it. The manager brought breakfast again. It’s awesome! The only downside is probably that the staff tends to ignore it when leaving the store, and there is no one to help put the suitcase in the car. I hope to improve~( However, the attitude of the manager and angel will choose to check in frequently in the follow-up)

msg:I was looking forward to it before I moved in. The sanitation in the lobby is quite good, and the landscape in the room is also beautiful, but the facilities in the room are really disappointing. They are not as good as the express hotel, and the sockets are loose. Yes, the very broken paint on the bedroom dressing table has fallen off and almost affected the beauty, and the floor tiles are still yellowed. I can't imagine that the facilities in such a high-end hotel room are so broken. Is it reluctant to pay to update it or it is art? ? I didn’t want to make an evaluation and I received the text message, but I couldn’t help but complain about it.

msg:I’m very struggling to respect the +1 yuan upgrade of the room type. It is said that it is an upgraded room type, but it is not the upper-level room type of Ctrip or the upper-level room type of Marriott. It is just the same room type that has a better view. The room type is more exciting. I have not seen a hotel with a price of 1k or less that has a non-smoking room and the front desk did not ask me about the need to be non-smoking or non-smoking. I more naturally think that the room is completely non-smoking. I didn't expect the front desk to be famously upgraded. Room type: There is an ashtray on the coffee table in front of the sofa on the 5th floor. I asked the front desk for a while and said that this room cannot be smoked. For a while, I said that the smell was not finished. What is incredible is that the front desk rearranged a non-smoking room for me. I found that this room is facing the blue Qianjiang residential building, that is, the non-private room. It happened that the day was because the price of Park Hyatt was too high on weekends, so I moved away from Zunlan on the day of check-in. I don’t want to say that Zunlan ruined my 22nd birthday, but I just want to say that he ruined my experience as a consumer. The +1 yuan upgrade on Ctrip is purely false propaganda. When the guest raises questions, the solution is to change For a worse room, I suggest that you have 1,000 yuan and would rather live in Diaoyutai. At least Ctrip customers have more human rights in his home. Don’t come to Zunlan if you don’t have Marriott Platinum/Titanium.

        晚間入住時發生了一些小插曲，晚上九點多鐘值班經理Ceasor Wu一直忙前忙後，給我們做出了非常驚喜的安排，非常感謝他的體諒和專業精神。還有當晚值班的樓層客房服務趙國英女士，她很辛苦地到我們房間一趟趟送東西和服務，也非常謝謝她！
我們還要在綠城尊藍繼續住下去，杭州的行程也還充滿未知與驚喜。但這間酒店和她專業的工作人員令人印象深刻，期待綠城尊藍越來越好。

尊藍，喜歡勤快聰明熱情的員工—趙芹。第一天聽到了我説喜歡咖啡，游泳。連續六天天天添加伊力咖啡包瓶水毛巾—眼中有活。
從君悦搬到尊藍，從湖濱到三橋，看湖景到看江景，多了60元打的錢，省了2000元住店錢—超值！
唯一的遺憾自助早餐不如君悦，吃了一天就不想去了。

msg:趁着娃兒寒假尾巴，來杭州逛逛，最後兩晚無意找到江邊這家酒店入住，整體感受是超過預期的。房間很大，通透，視野非常好。雙人床的尺寸真是好，跟娃兒睡一張很寬鬆。洗漱用品是Byredo的，香味高級。早餐足夠豐盛，味道經得起考驗，而且早上就有冰激凌吃，娃兒開心壞了。
但是也有一些不足：入住禮遇的歡迎水果送的太晚。我們中午入住，一直到了晚上逛回來洗完澡打了幾個電話後才送到，可能人手不足忙不過來，望以後改進；我們住的那個房間，衞生間有味道，還不小，酒店應該好好檢查一下；還有離店的那個早餐，我們三口到了餐廳後，發現有一桌靠窗有位置，上面衹有一個用過的餐盤，就想讓服務員收拾一下我們坐過去。但是接連兩個服務員都告訴我們那個人沒走，不能確定，一定要等十分鐘以後才收（但明顯那桌的客人已經有了）沒辦法，我們衹好坐到了別的桌，留了些小遺憾吧。

酒店的位置也非常優越，坐地鐵方便，打車去西湖或者蕭山也不遠。

設施比較齊全，無論是免費的無線網絡、還是高品質的洗浴用品和浴袍，都讓我感到十分滿意。Adara小姐姐幫我們解決了很多需求，飲用礦泉水是無限量供應的，喝完了打電話就會送來。還有小朋友的室內拖鞋，也準備的很妥當。

早餐在22樓，風景絕佳。餐點品類齊全，麪點很好吃。服務生還會主動端來紅茶咖啡，服務很好。

總體來説，我非常喜歡這家五星級酒店的入住體驗。我會推薦給我的朋友和家人，並期待有機會再次入住。

兩件事直到退房 沒有一聲抱歉

2、房間很大，和介紹的70平米相近，房間設施齊全
3、房間衞生有待改善，特別是細節處。音響上，角落處衞生不到位
4、服務急需改善。14.20登記入住，一直在大堂等到16.20才進入房間，而且另一個房間直到晚飯後才給到我們。期間問了4次是否打掃完畢，各種理由解釋就是沒有結論，白白耽誤了我們幾個小時時間。
5、果盤一個房間有一個房間沒有，足見管理的缺失。

msg:硬件部分，硬裝破舊明顯缺乏維護，徒有江景
軟性服務，毫無五星標準，具體舉例如下：
1）停車，若是大的suv停不進機械，其他車位沒有就沒辦法了，門口的停車位空着，但不好意思是給領導的
2）冬天大堂居然冷颼颼 節約成本 沒有歸家的温度衹有冰冷
3）下午四點以後checkin 房間居然沒打掃好，半天擠出一個 房間還給錯了，住進去了，非要讓我們騰出來，最後堅持，才給我們妥協
4）房卡提供 兩個人 主動問一張夠麼 作為五星酒店和那個價位本就 標準兩張
不清楚4.7評分咋來的， 可能是一路住五星連鎖品牌酒店，價格都差不多， 比較效應的結論，總之之後還是老實選擇國際連鎖品牌

空調怎麼調都是熱的 前台説是沒問題
自己訂的套房，也是萬豪會員，沒什麼歡樂禮遇提供，我住其他萬豪酒店都很客氣的
最離譜是 我已提前一晚的凌晨與前台申請延遲退房，等了兩個小時才有人回覆，不過前台説沒問題那我就睡了，結果早上11點打兩個電話來催我退房，你要是不行就不要答應客人吧？也沒想過幾個小時會完全打亂客人的計劃，確實無語
房間是還不錯，但服務態度完完不值這個價格。

還有就是費用問題，週三豐價格居然比周五貴500，入住就降價，等發現時已經過了貴必賠了

msg:樓上中餐廳服務人員感覺懵懵的，上菜慢，服務不如普通餐廳，叫買單都叫了幾次，錄車牌的問過之後又忘記給錄了，出去又提示交停車費。客房的客房服務電話打了七八遍才有人接，和早幾年住這裏相比這次服務真的差了很多很多。

msg:早就想來杭州玩但是疫情一直很不明朗，這次終於可以來了!一直都很喜歡藍色基調的建築，尊藍把藍色和灰色融合的非常好。新開的貴賓俱樂部，下午茶可以坐着看看風景。可能是有好多人都出來玩，晚上電話打了比較久才有人接，小姑娘glory聲音好聽，也很耐心的聽我説完要的東西，還祝我晚安，哈哈哈哈要特別表揚一下。
退房之後我有東西落下，sandy也很負責任的幫我找到並且寄給我，處理的速度很快，看來這裏的工作溝通還是很有效率的。下次還會回來入住的。
