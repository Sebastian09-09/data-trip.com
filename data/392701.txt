Specially, Ms. Camille Feng, she helped us to change the rooms and give us very good suggestions for our stay; Ms. Xu Bin had very beautiful smile and gave us warm welcome.  Room service persons,  Rick Ren and Shang Ya Qiong provided excellent service for us.   Moreover, VIP lounge at 27 floor is a such good place for guests to relax and meet friends, with coffee, tea, snacks, etc.   The Chengdu JinJiang hotel&#39;s VIP rooms are truly 5 star qualities.   Also, its breakfast is very good and more affordable, comparing with other 5 star hotels.

The only issues I had were the charging facilities and some broken furniture. Some of the plug sockets did not work and there is nowhere near the bed to charge mobile devices and the wardrobe door was broken, causing the light to come on. These however are very small things that can be easily fixed. Overall I had a very pleasant time there and would stay again.

msg:The appearance of a Porsche, but the interior of the cab of a twenty-year-old excavator. There was mold and rust everywhere in the room. It was like this after changing several rooms. I couldn't cancel the order and could only live with it for one night.
The room facilities are too old. The 80 yuan small hotel next to the train station has this room in an outdated environment. You can imagine how old the facilities inside the room are.
Jinjiang Hotel, please invest some money in renovating the rooms. The appearance of the hotel makes it so magnificent and more impressive to attract guests. However, the rooms are too old for decades and only the guests will be satisfied if they look the same on the outside.
In addition, the standard for breakfast in the morning is free for children under 120cm tall. Even one centimeter over 121cm is not allowed and has to be charged 100 yuan. The restaurant management staff is very serious, but the breakfast is too simple, just a few pickles and too many pickles, which is really unpalatable and too confusing. .

In short, the price is definitely not worthy of the standards of a five-star hotel. I had already said that it was only worthy of the appearance of the hotel. It only has its appearance, and it is too in line with Jinjiang Hotel. Will never come again. The service is 5 stars. The staff's service is very good.

I have stayed for two days and planned to extend my stay. However, the hotel initially said that there were no rooms. Then it said that there were rooms, but the price had increased. I could not pay the previous price. Ctrip’s price is amazing. I accidentally discovered that Ctrip has another ordinary twin room. So I placed the order. Although I couldn't stay in the current VIP building, I didn't have to change hotels anymore to avoid the hassle.
When checking out, I had a sudden idea and asked Ctrip if they could coordinate. Ctrip is really powerful. It was done in a short time, the original room was extended, and the luggage that was brought to the first floor was brought back. 😄😃

They upgraded us to an executive room, and we could dine in the executive lounge (but they didn't tell us about this, I found out from the reviews). It happened that we were too tired to go out on the day of check-in, so we solved a dinner. Our executive room is in the old building, the decoration is a bit old, and there are not enough charging sockets. There are not many breakfast options, but the cakes are very beautiful and taste good.

On the second night, the front desk paid extra money to upgrade to the VIP building. The room was very large, the facilities were very new, the twin beds were 1.5m, and there was a large bathtub where you could take a bath. You can also use the executive lounge and open the night windows at night. It was a bit hot when the heating was turned on. A circulating fan was delivered in the middle of the night, as well as cute little nail clippers and a panda doll. Seeing that I drank capsule coffee, he was very considerate and added more capsules. It was really, really worth it. By the way, the executive lounge has a nice view and the food is pretty good.
Finally, the hotel's location is excellent. It only takes 15 minutes by bicycle to reach Tianfu Square, People's Park, Kuanzhai Alley, and Wuhou Temple Jinli. It's really great! The subway entrance is just outside the hotel and turn left.
Next time I come, stay at Jinjiang Hotel.

msg:The reason why I chose to stay at Sichuan Jinjiang Hotel is to feel the feeling of the old state guesthouse in Sichuan, otherwise I would not choose it today when there are so many good hotels. A few good points: 1. I was upgraded to the south building and offered a late check-out when I checked in. Thank you for that. 2. Because the room was extremely dry, I was extremely thirsty. I asked the waiter for more mineral water, which was delivered to me for free. 3. The location is acceptable. There is a subway station named after Jinjiang Hotel. At the same time, many problems were also discovered after moving in: 1. The window of the room is close to the exhaust duct, which makes the noise a bit loud, and the curtains cannot be completely closed, leaving a large gap. The noise in the room is too loud when the windows are opened, and it is very dry when the windows are closed. Stuffy, causing rest to be affected. 2. The room is old. Almost all switches and sockets are old and dirty. The metal parts are rusty. The wooden furniture is old and serious. There are suspected blood stains on the lampshade. The TV is old and small. 3. The toilet is very small, about the same length as a slipper, similar to the size of a toilet seat on an airplane or a high-speed rail. You must pay special attention to this. The toilet is very small, and it is very inconvenient for taller people to use it. 4. There is no shower room, you have to step into the bathtub to shower, and the shower head is very low, so you can only take a shower with a hand shower, and the bathroom is very small as a whole. As long as someone takes a shower, water will be everywhere, and the shower curtain is very dirty. I doubt it is ever changed or washed. 5. The elevator presses the floor randomly and the card swipe machine is useless. It lacks a sense of security. Other issues have little impact on your stay, so I won’t go into details one by one. In short, this hotel can be said to be the worst one among the many hotels in Sichuan. The overall feeling is that it is old, stingy and not worth it. It is not recommended for everyone to stay. Also, I would like to make a suggestion, if the hotel mainly promotes VIP floors, it is better to just close the other floors to save worry and trouble. In addition, I don’t know what the relationship is between this Jinjiang Hotel and Jinjiang Star Express Hotel, but my children kept complaining after checking in that it was not as good as Jinjiang Star.

msg:On the last day in Chengdu, the old landmark five-star hotel still has a good reputation, but I am used to staying in foreign brand hotels, there is still a certain gap. I cannot rule out the factor of economic conditions that I can only choose the lowest-end room here, but the facilities Old, especially all deluxe level rooms don't even have sockets on the bedside... I hope they can be upgraded soon. This time we mainly focus on tourism within Chengdu. When we come to Chengdu again, we should use this city as a transit to visit Jiuzhai Huanglong or Panzhihua. The hotel should choose a hotel that is more suitable for that mode.
The overall feeling is quite good. The episode in the middle made me feel the service level of a five-star hotel. This city still left me with many good memories. Chengdu is a slow-paced city that is completely different from Tianjin. I look forward to visiting again Come to the land of abundance

It is quite clean, there is enough hot water, and the room temperature is constant, which is good (you can set the temperature by yourself), and it is very comfortable to sleep. The public area is super stylish, with the posture and grandeur of a state hotel. The breakfast is a standard five-star standard, very high-end. Except for seafood, everything is available. The parking features a spacious one. The subway is right outside the door. When I go to Tianfu Airport, I take the subway directly (go to the South Railway Station and change to Line 18 to go to the airport. After getting off the subway, you can apply for a boarding pass and check in luggage).

Ni Ruikai at the concierge desk , Li Yujuan, and Zhou Long were kind and gave us serious answers when we asked about the nearby attractions. Awesome!

The management of this hotel is really good. The hotel was very nice. We had a great time. It was comfortable and the air conditioning was powerful. I felt that the price was worth it. I often stay in hotels, but the service and management of this hotel are the best I have ever stayed in. It really feels like home! I give it a big thumbs up. ! It is indeed a five-star hotel hahaha! I will book this hotel next time I come to Chengdu!

The hotel's swimming pool is open from 6:30 to 23:00, which is really awesome.
It was already evening when I arrived, and the front desk staff took me directly to the room and introduced the hotel facilities. Thank you very much, and I forgot her name.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this five-star hotel from facilities to services.

I asked where the front desk was and found out that it was the front desk. I had just handled a queue jumper and the result was unexpected. The receptionist who jumped in line was very unhappy at the time. After checking in, there was an elevator that didn't require a detour, but he pointed to an elevator that was a dead end. There was no mention of an executive lounge, nor was there any introduction to the executive courtesy. Breakfast was at There was no introduction anywhere, and the concierge didn't help with anything. When I entered the room on the dead end, I was greeted by a strong smell of smoke. Although the room was old and could be maintained, the smell was unbearable. Smoking was allowed in the room. Check-in They didn't ask me about my room request. I put my luggage and came out. I saw the concierge in the lobby enthusiastically helping foreign friends to carry their luggage. It was nice. My check-in was so cold that I couldn't see the hospitality of the hotel. I didn't want it to be too late or too tired. After checking out, the hotel called and I thought they would listen to my feedback, but they didn't listen. Instead, they asked me to upgrade, and then they told me to change the story, but thank you for the upgrade, but the stay was very uncomfortable, and there was no one-star service. I said I was happy. I'm sorry I can't give it a good review. Let's talk about the breakfast room. It's very messy. There is nothing for breakfast. The hot dishes are all vegetarian and the noodles are not delicious. The executive lounge is in the VIP building and is open 24 hours a day. Go during happy hour. What to eat? There was no one in the executive lounge. I came after a while and there was no enthusiasm. I left the hotel after eating early in the morning. There was no reason to extend my stay. I will not come again. Thank you again for the upgrade. I hope Ability to treat individual customers seriously and improve service

The bedding is very comfortable and the lights are very bright. It's a pity that the bathroom is really too small due to the limitations of the times.

The room size is small, but the layout and facilities are old and it feels like traveling back to the 1980s and 1990s. The furniture is already stained, but the bathroom still has an old-fashioned bathtub and shower. Aren't you worried about guests falling over? The bathroom door is an old wooden sliding door, and the door lock is also old-fashioned. My husband locked it inside and it got stuck and couldn't be opened. The room attendant struggled outside for a long time and couldn't fix it. Finally, he called the master from the engineering depar**ent. Use a screwdriver to unscrew it. This is the first time such an embarrassing thing has happened. The service attitude was quite good. I gave a small gift to apologize before leaving. However, the facilities were too old and the room seemed cramped and depressing. I decided to check out the next day.

With these names, you don't have to worry about the hotel environment and hygiene, everything is just right. The location, bathroom, bedding, space, and sound insulation are all comfortable and satisfactory. The price/performance ratio is very affordable. If I go to Chengdu again, I will definitely stay here again. By the way, there is a snack street 7 or 8 minutes’ walk away, and the roadside stalls are also delicious, so you can have dinner and night snacks all covered.

msg:I stayed twice during my stay in Chengdu, the first time I stayed in the east building for two nights, the room with a balcony has a beautiful night view. The second stay for three nights was upgraded to a business room in the south building, with automatic curtains and smart toilets. Some facilities are slightly old but the sanitation is very good.

In particular, the indoor swimming pool in the glass house is very good, with clear water and a transparent view. Comparing the underground indoor swimming pools of many hotels, the good is not a little bit.

The breakfast is rich in variety, and the freshly ground coffee tastes good. As soon as you enter the door, the dessert level is online, as well as the spare ribs and chicken feet of Cantonese morning tea.

The service level is also quite good, after all, it is an old five-star hotel. According to the driver of Didi, Jin Jiang was not a place for ordinary people to live in before.

Jin Jiang is an old hotel, and the room facilities are still relatively old. But the service is really good. There was some water leakage in the room on the first night. I immediately arranged another new room with no problems. On the second day, I repeatedly confirmed and gave small gifts to the children. The gift is light and affectionate. Heavy, thanks 🙏
In addition, the swimming pool is a surprise, with a glass roof, and the water is very clean. As soon as we arrived, the waiter brought two bottles of water for drinking. When the children went down to change their shoes, they kept reminding them to walk carefully, which was very considerate.
Breakfast is also great ❤️

It is said that the name of the hotel was also named by the bosses Zhu De and Chen Yi, and now the subway station has a special "Jinjiang Hotel" station, which is enough to prove her status. The hotel has a large area, many rooms, and warm and thoughtful service. Living in Jinjiang is a kind of feeling, and it is worth recommending.

msg:The room is relatively average, the main problem is that the facilities are outdated.
Sanitation is fairly clean.
The service is indeed five-star service.
First of all, Jinjiang Hotel and Jinjiang Hotel VIP Building need to be booked separately.
The price of Jinjiang Hotel VIP Building is double that of Jinjiang Hotel, but according to the comments, it should be a newly built building, and the new facilities should be five-star.
This Jinjiang Hotel should be the earliest five-star hotel, it is said to be the earliest five-star hotel in Chengdu, but the facilities in the room are too old. To be honest, I really didn't get used to it on the first night, and I wanted to go out and change rooms.
I got used to it, and it was okay the next day, mainly because it was cleaned.
For breakfast, the place is relatively large, and it is indeed laid out according to a five-star hotel.
The variety is relatively rich, there are many noodles, and there are several masters who are doing it now.
The fruit is also relatively rich, such as whole peaches and oranges, which give people a very a**ospheric feeling.
Well, but, to be honest, there are quite a few down-to-earth items. Well, there are not many high-end ingredients. Considering that the price of the room is more than 500 yuan, then this is about the same, and the price/performance ratio is not bad.
It is said that it costs 150 to buy a single breakfast ticket, so it is not worth it.

Besides, his room is divided into executive room and non-administrative room. The executive room can go to the VIP building, and go to the executive corridor on the 27th floor to enjoy breakfast, afternoon tea, and various pastries. Moreover, the swimming pool on the VIP building is separate from this side. The ordinary rooms here can only swim in this side, that is, the east building of Jin Jiang Hotel, and cannot go to the VIP building.
In other words, the east building of Jinjiang Hotel is the room I booked. It has a swimming pool on the second floor. The swimming pool is 22 meters long. The water quality is relatively clear, the service is relatively good, and the feeling of swimming is very good, and the top is made of glass. You can bask in the sun and swim. Looking at this room at around 500 yuan, the price/performance ratio is still super high.

Well, on the whole, the quality of service staff in the hotel is relatively good, indeed the quality of a five-star hotel.

Spend about 500 yuan to enjoy five-five-star service, and it feels really good, but the facilities in the room are a bit outdated.

When the luggage was stored in the lobby, the younger brother gave his daughter a panda doll, and the daughter was overjoyed. The entrance of Jinjiang Hotel Station on Metro Line 1 is right next to the hotel, which is more convenient.

I like the a**ospheric style of the old store, the lobby, the connecting corridors between various parts of the hotel, the restaurants, the low-key luxury, I really enjoy it. Both swimming pools can be used. The east building is simple but stylish with lighting, and the VIP building has luxurious facilities on the ground floor. The location of the hotel is excellent, just outside the subway station. Walking and cycling are also convenient. The hotel is close to the Jinjiang River and at the intersection of Dalu. There is Tianfu Square to the north, Yulin to the south, thatched cottage to the west along the river, and Lan Kwai Fong and Chunxi Road to the east. Cycling along the river is very pleasant . On the day of departure, we set off at five o'clock in the morning, and the hotel booked a taxi, which was really convenient. Next time I come to Chengdu to play, I will stay in Jinjiang. Can't help but say again, those corridors in the hotel are really beautiful.

The location is superior, it is very convenient to go everywhere, the environment is also very good, and the breakfast is also very rich. But this stay was a bit of a surprise, maybe I didn’t choose the VIP building. The room I stayed in was very small in the east building, and the facilities inside were so outdated that I couldn’t believe it. The tables, sofas, carpets, and shelves felt old and would never be used by ordinary families. The refrigerator shelf was even seriously damaged. The bathroom is also very small. If the itinerary had not been confirmed, I almost wanted to change hotels temporarily. It is estimated that the VIP building is still very good. The breakfast is still as good as ever, so if this hotel is an old building room, you should carefully consider it! After staying for two days, I decided to go to Kempinski, at least I lived in a comfortable and modern room.

The hotel is very big~ We should live in the east building. The facilities in the new building are expected to be better, but the overall service experience and feeling are still good.
I remember that when we checked in, my little brother was so enthusiastic~ he took us to the front desk of the VIP building to check in manually. In fact, it is very convenient that the east building can do it by itself.
In addition, talk about the hotel's breakfast! The environment is very good, and the panda 🐼 element made me happy for a second. Bread, pastries, and various local snacks are also abundant. The beans selected for the coffee are also more in line with my preferences.

I am very grateful to the front office staff for their patient service, especially Zhang Yang, Zhu Haixiang and Chen Jinbo, who kindly introduced us to some scenic spots and precautions in Chengdu. Seeing that we brought the children, they thoughtfully gave us red panda dolls and milk
This time we booked an executive room, and my little brother even upgraded us to an executive room in the VIP building, so give us a big thumbs up ^_^
The facilities in the room are relatively new, and the bath products are very good~
There is an executive lounge on the 27th floor, and there are some simple breads and snacks for the guests of the administrative building ~ very suitable for children to fill their stomachs ~
The swimming pool experience is also very good. On the B2 floor, there are not many people, and the water quality is very clean!
Generally speaking, it was a very good experience. I will stay at Jinjiang Hotel next time I come to Chengdu!

Location: Very convenient, the surrounding environment is good, not far from anywhere.
Personnel service: very good. Arrived at the hotel around 4:00 p.m., because the room was relatively vacant, I was upgraded directly to the room, and when I entered the elevator, I would be courteous and block the elevator door when I opened the door. The service voice in the lobby is gentle, because of the wifi problem in the room, it will not just tell you how to do it by phone, but will directly provide door-to-door service. Also, the waiter at the entrance of the lobby will help open the door. These details are very useful to me. It has been raining in Chengdu in recent days, and there are free umbrellas in the wardrobe. Needless to say, the hygienic environment is very clean. Because the room cleaning aunt gave us tangerines, I left a message saying that the tangerines are very sweet, thank you. There will be no more tangerines in the future. Aunt Ma Ping in the picture even told me to change other fruits. In fact, I am really simple. I want to thank you, but I didn’t expect that my aunt would attach great importance to my feelings. The hygiene of the room is really clean. After changing the quilt cover, I will get a good night card. It’s really comfortable to come back after going out for a whole day. Also, the buttons on my trousers were loose. Before I went out, I asked Aunt Ma Ping if she had any needles and threads, and they would return them when they were used up. But when I came back, my aunt told me that the sewing box was on the table, and said that there was no need to return it. And the aunt always greeted her with a smile, and the overall communication and service attitude is very good, so I like it👍. I remembered that on the first day of my stay, an aunt asked me if I wanted turndown service. Every time I came back late, it was useless, but I loved it if I could inform in advance and take the initiative to serve.

Check-in was fast and enthusiastic, especially Zhou Long and Zhang Yongjian were meticulous and patient, and even upgraded the room. What's even more surprising is that March 30 is my lover's birthday, and guest specialists Liu Yihe and Zhu Haixiang even made a special trip to the guest room to give them birthday gifts. During the two-day stay, I felt that Jinjiang Hotel deserves to be a five-star hotel, impeccable. Come to Chengdu again, if the price is right, Jinjiang Hotel is still the first choice!

msg:The overall feeling of staying this time is two words outrageous!
Let me talk about the most outrageous thing first. Although the internal facilities of the room are old-fashioned five-star, although the facilities are outdated, there is no such thing as no socket at the head of the bed. Second, the wallpaper near the head of the bed is turned up in obvious places. Third, the place where the toilet paper is placed, the paper towel has not been drawn out yet, and the iron sheet is already on the verge of crumbling... Adding more things to fix it, presumably the budget will not be too much. Fourth, the two circles on the fixed shaft of the toilet lid are gone... all the rusty screws are printed...
Let's talk about the service. The last time I stayed in Jinjiang, I didn't feel so outrageous. It may be because the front desk upgraded the room type. I knew that the east building was like this. I would rather pay more to upgrade the room type... But the front desk didn't give me this option when I checked in. . Second, I forgot to note the non-smoking room when I booked the room, but the front desk didn't ask me. I didn't find out that it was a smoking room until I entered the room. It is true that I made a reservation mistake here, but when I checked in the room, I asked for some basic information, which is a very basic and basic hotel service in my opinion. Not to mention that when I checked in, the two front desk receptionists all wore the golden key logo. Third, before I was about to check out, I hesitated again and again whether to type out this information and give a bad review. After all, I always think that bad reviews still have an impact on hotels, and it is not easy for everyone. Judging from my first check-in experience, the hotel also attaches great importance to platform evaluation. So I told my husband that if the front desk asked me about my experience of staying, I would definitely tell the truth about my experience, and I would not give any bad reviews. It's a pity that the hotel didn't give me this opportunity when I checked out, and didn't ask me how I felt about my stay.

The front desk arranged for a high-rise room with a balcony. I already checked out in the morning. When I arrived at the high-speed rail station, I found that the computer was left in the room, so I had to come back to pick it up. The hotel also notified me on the way, but the high-speed rail was late, so I changed the booking in the afternoon. Discuss with the hotel whether you can continue to rest until noon. He readily agreed and sent over the room card. It can make people feel the five-star service of the old five-star hotel. I want to praise Liu Yihe, Bai Jingwen, the handsome Li Yongjian, and other unknown handsome men and beauties, thank you 🙏

Sister Gou Jianying, who cleaned the room, was even more meticulous and thoughtful, and made us feel at home during the 3 days we stayed in the hotel, making us linger and forget to return! The hotel's breakfast is rich and authentic, especially the Tianfu-style Dandan noodles and red oil Chaoshou that can fully satisfy a foodie's taste buds! Finally, I would like to praise the pillows, mattresses and eiderdown quilts in the room. The wife is so comfortable, and it is one of the best quality in the star hotels I have stayed in!

I stayed here for one night last night, but I was not satisfied with it. The heating in the room was too hot. I asked the staff to turn it off, but for some reason, the room temperature was still very high. The temperature did not change until the morning, which disturbed our sleep. Other aspects are doing very well, it is indeed the best hotel in Chengdu.

First of all, it took several hours from booking in the afternoon to checking in at night. When we arrived at the hotel at 20:50, the room was not cleaned. We were tired from the journey but we went shopping at night.
Secondly, the room is a narrow area in the corner, and the wall is the wall when you open the window, and it is said that it has been upgraded. Is this condition an upgrade or a downgrade?
This time overturned my perception of Jinjiang Hotel.

Although it is really not outstanding in any aspect. It is new, or luxurious, or has a sense of design. But the low building, the spacious courtyard, the heavy decoration, the balcony with lanterns at night, and the windows are not so wide The slowly flowing river, the sunlight slanting on the tea table in the morning...everything makes people feel intimate and comfortable. I like this kind of tranquility in the present and the beauty precipitated by time.
For my needs of traveling alone this time and wanting to stay quietly for a while, this kind of experience is almost perfect. If combined with the price, it is far beyond expectations. The service is the same. Based on my own experience, the most comfortable one is the old brand Star rating. Considerate and moderate. Thanks to the staff (Bai Jingwen Zeng Ying...) for taking care of me and taking the initiative to upgrade. I wish you all the best. Goodbye.

The only disadvantage is that the bathroom is a bit small (this may be related to the room type booked), and the hygiene needs to be strengthened. There are long mushrooms in the bathroom and the roof that cannot be dealt with in time!

There is an advertising company on the floor of the executive double room. Someone smokes in the corridor and someone makes a loud phone call The room has a musty smell. Open the toilet seat and a hair is tied to the seat cover. The telephone room comes to deal with the room. The guest room directly picks up the hair and leaves again to disinfect the phone. A so-called room manager took the room manager and said that the hair fell from the air outlet. If you make a mistake, change it and don’t make excuses. Is it because the hotel has the habit of giving the second room to the guests? Later, it changed to the so-called new building. Double check whether the breakfast is available at 6:00. The bed room enjoys the trea**ent of the executive lounge. Go to the lounge at 6:30 to see that even the cheapest economy hotel meals are not as good as summing up. The service is very uneven. You will not feel the sincere attitude towards customers. Sorry for the whole process Nothing but a cold room change for you

Unlike some hotel rooms, you can hear the conversation as if it is connected to the next door and corridor, even on the side of the road. The room also completely can not hear the noise of the car. As I never write reviews, I would like to give Jin Jiang Hotel a serious thumbs up.

It is suitable for entertaining or going by yourself. The dishes are very authentic. We recommend double-cooked pork and boiled cabbage, which are very delicious.

His attitude is sincere and tireless. It is worthy of praise! Make a few comments and hope to improve. It may have been too long since the renovation, and some of the hotel facilities are still aging, but the repair speed is very fast after the reaction. Some facilities are not very convenient or reasonable: for example, the toilet flush button is half blocked by the toilet lid, but the force point is below; putting a towel next to the toilet 🚽 always feels unsanitary; the shower faucet switch is a handy gadget; a gift Occasionally, the fruit is not fresh; sometimes there are many people, but there are only two people at the front desk, and the check-in time will be longer. But the overall stay experience is ok, the gym service staff are very enthusiastic, and the swimming pool water quality is also good. Hope to improve more. Will choose next time.

msg:Near 12 midnight, I was about to wash and go to bed. The air volume of the air purifier at home suddenly increased. When I went to the window and saw it was raining outside, the smoke was floating in the air, and I felt that the rain was very strange. Then I looked at the constant rise of P2.5 displayed by the purifier, and then I smelled a smell of smoke. I saw that nothing was burning at home. I opened the door and heard footsteps in the corridor, so I asked where the fire was. Yet? Back to me: go! ! Then the fire truck was called again. So I went home and got a wet towel, went out, and entered the elevator. The smoke inside was very high, and even though I had a wet towel to cover my nose, it still smelled bad. When I went downstairs, I saw that many neighbors had gathered, as well as firefighters and police officers. It is said that the electrical circuit of the household upstairs spontaneously ignited. After a short time in the elevator, I felt a little discomfort in my throat and chest. The first time I encountered a fire, I fully understood that many people were not burned to death but choked to death after the fire! !
Stayed downstairs for more than an hour, the danger was lifted, and I was allowed to go upstairs, but the smell of smoke was still there, although it was not very long, so I decided to go to the hotel 😀
Jinjiang Hotel is not far from my home. I also swim there on weekdays. I just wanted to go there, so I stayed in Jinjiang. The little girl at the front desk helped me upgrade my room and delayed my check-out until 2:00. At the same time, I promised to help me apply for it Can you delay it for a while, it is already past 2 am when I entered the room.
I woke up, went to eat breakfast, walked around the yard, and then went back to the room to catch up on sleep. The waiter told me that I could check out until 3 o'clock, so I would have a good sleep.
The old-fashioned Jinjiang, the first five-star hotel in Sichuan, is still online and lives up to its name.
The only regret is that the swimming pool is not open due to the epidemic.

msg:Chengdu locals stayed in a hotel for a day because of the house cleaning, and chose the Jinjiang Hotel that they liked.

I chose the most cost-effective South Building, 557 with double breakfast. It was very cost-effective during the epidemic. The room was a bit old, but it was clean and tidy. The cleaning aunties I met also had a very good attitude and gave welcome fruits.
The swimming pool is very clean and the water quality is very good. It was just me and my boyfriend when we went there, and the lifeguard looked at us embarrassingly.
There are many types of breakfast. I personally think that the steamed beef with noodles is particularly delicious. The pasta is not as amazing as the comments said, but it is quite satisfactory.
The fly in the oin**ent is that the room arranged in the south building faces inward, the scenery outside is not very good, and it has been renovated (but it is still quiet)

The hotel facilities are old, but they are well maintained and the appearance is beautiful and novel. The hotel is full of unique gardens, pools and green spaces, as well as a European-style Louvre-style dining environment.
The room is a little small, but clean and well-equipped, sofa, desk, and the room is well set up. The bathroom is cramped with a bathtub and shower.
The attitude of the service staff is very good. When Gou Jianying, the room staff member, saw the children together, he took the initiative to say hello, put drinking water, and gave the Chengdu special panda doll to Cubzai. The children were very excited.

The third time I stayed here, I was upgraded to a business double room for free. The room is not facing the street, and it is very quiet at night.
But I need to explain (no blame or complaint), when I first checked in and handed the ID card to the front desk, the other party directly used two fingers to pass it, which is relatively new to me.
It's very convenient to order takeout and it can be delivered to the door of the room by a robot.
Another small flaw is that after a few flashes of a reading light in the room, it will not light up, and the light in the bathroom will make a lot of noise when it is turned on.
As an old five-star hotel in Chengdu, the overall stay experience is quite good!

There are also robots delivering food to the room, which is very cute and futuristic! The waiter Hu Xiaoqian has a good service attitude, patiently and meticulously answer customer questions, and also gave her son a small gift to make the guests feel at home, very praise 👍🏻

msg:I often work hard for my life. I have stayed in Hilton, Hyatt, Wyndham, Kempinski and other hotels. It is the first time I have stayed at the domestic Jinjiang Hotel. I feel really amazing! Since my family arrived first and communicated after I arrived, the hotel took the initiative to upgrade the executive twin room in the VIP building, and sent a waiter to send the card to the room. The brother who sent the card patiently waited for us to clean up. And take us through the long palace-style corridor to the elevator entrance, politely say goodbye.
The Executive Twin Room is a 1.5-meter super large twin room with a large space of 50 square meters, which is very suitable for family travel. L'Occitane's bathroom products and the standard configuration of the capsule coffee machine far exceed the Sanwu products of some international five-star hotels. The waiter is also very attentive. Seeing that our family drinks a lot of water, I can rest assured that there are three more bottles of water every day. The big mirror in the room is leaning against the wall. Would you like to adjust it?
In short, Jin Jiang Hotel gives me the feeling that it far exceeds the level of a first-class international five-star hotel. Unfortunately, it is a pity that I cannot renew the room due to the conference reservation! In the future, if you have the opportunity, you must still live in Jinjiang Hotel to support domestic brands!

msg:highly recommended! After choosing for a long time, I finally booked Jinjiang Hotel. The executive room in the old building was upgraded to the VIP building for free. The room is large and the service is very good. The little brother at the front desk of the hotel who arrived at 1 o'clock in the morning received us very warmly. We also recommended to us the local attractions, because we left the phone too late so we can contact him if necessary. The children also got a little panda that he was thinking of. The rooms are large and clean, and the bathrooms are all L’Occitane. The drinks in the refrigerator are free, and there are fruits every day. The waiter saw that we bought water to put in the room, and gave us two more bottles of water the next day. The breakfast is quite rich and friendly to us who don’t eat spicy food. Details determine success or failure, Jinjiang Hotel is really hard!

服務差是最讓人無語的。1.辦入住機器壞了服務員叫我要麼等等，要麼讓我自己去另一個大堂辦理，説行李留下他幫我看着。正常酒店這會兒就該道歉了，這裡是沒有的，甚至沒有説幫我把行李拿上樓。等我辦完入住回來看見他們都在用四川話聊天。真的很不專業。2.想去吃酒店的自助晚餐，到了那我問了下説住店有優惠麼，答曰沒有，但是在他們官網訂188（需要註冊會員）但是大眾點評上也是188（答曰大眾點評券需要提前24小時預約才能用）然後我就沒吃了。隔壁萬豪208不用預約還送一個小火鍋。3.早上去用餐的時候給服務員看了我的早餐券，她讓我進去隨後又跟進來説我的房間沒有含早餐，讓我等一等她再去確認。一整個被無語到了，正好早餐看起來也沒啥好吃的我就想那我退掉好了，這時來了個年長些的服務員態度稍好給我介紹了下餐點並幫我拿了一碗麪。真是難得這酒店還有這樣的態度。4.我走的時候忘記拿兩件放在櫃子裏的衣服，接到酒店電話説幫我拿下來放在行李箱旁邊行不行，當時我還感歎下這酒店也不是完全不好。直到我拿到我的衣服，被裝在我從川西回來裝零食垃圾的垃圾袋，真的不知道該説什麼。每個房間的櫃子裏都有酒店自己乾淨的紙袋吧。
總結，這個酒店設施老舊服務一般，往低可以去住全季亞朵，服務態度更好酒店更新。或者加一點住連鎖五星吧。下次再也不住這種Local五星了。

有點年代感的酒店，房間不是很大，但是很乾凈，預算充足的話可以選更大一點的房間，很安靜，我訂的是標間，這個價位還是性價比很高的。
酒店的位置也還可以，如果喜歡溜達的朋友，周圍景點步行半小時左右基本可以到達，打車也很方便。
最值得入住的是酒店的服務，工作人員都很熱情，入住的當天是我媽媽的生日，酒店送了蛋糕，還寫了賀卡，媽媽很開心，覺得太意外了。她開心我就更開心，所以感謝各位，下次還會再來。

msg:雖然房間的設施設備比較舊，但是完全按照五星級的標準進行了相關的配置，非常齊全。而且一次性的拖鞋是我覺得最舒服的一次。並且酒店所有的員工服務態度超好，雖然因為早餐的事情有點小插曲，但是酒店方積極處理，讓我真切感受了什麼是好的酒店管理，這個是以前住其他賓館和民宿不能比的。尤其是酒店還在使用電視台節目引導單，讓我帶的長者非常驚喜和滿意。不過還是要提一下，洗澡沒有單獨的淋浴間，必須站在浴缸裏面，這個對於長者不友好，怕摔跤。

msg:酒店是成都老牌五星級酒店，名氣較大，房間户型設施參差不齊，貴賓樓最好（當然房價也最貴，南樓比東樓稍好些，但房間也一般（沒有淋浴間，衹有浴缸+噴頭;房間內沒有USB充電接口）。酒店亮點是南樓2樓的泳池，開放時間最遲到晚上11點，水深1.5米，大人小孩都能遊。酒店位置較佳（地鐵錦江賓館站在酒店附近100米，邊上就是四川省人民大會堂）。酒店日常政府接待和商務活動較多，不過對帶娃出行的不太友好（1.2米以上小童早餐費用為100元/人）;房間設施偏老舊，剛入住兩天床頭燈就壞了，叫了賓館工程部人員才修好。作為老牌五星級賓館，房間衞生打掃還需更細緻（修理床頭燈時拉開牀頭櫃，竟然發現了一個不知道什麼時候留下的乾癟蘋果核😥）。整體來看，適合商務、公務出差入住。

msg:22號，端午節放假第一天，下午高鐵站打車人太多了，看看賓館就在地鐵口於是就2號換1號過來了。當我一箇中年婦女拖着行李箱揹着兩個書包，帶着長者孩子，到東大堂門僮面前時，問他是不是這裏辦入住，他全程沒有反應，我又重複了一遍，他衹是往裡麪指了指，全程沒有要幫忙的意思。面無表情的看着我抬着箱子上了四五個台階。當時真是覺得這所謂的五星酒店服務真是挺讓人震驚的。每年出差➕出遊N次的我真是立馬走人的心都有。真心的上個月在紹興賓館我就一個人拿個小行李箱，碰到一個年紀不小的服務員，看有個小台階，還主動幫我拿了箱子，弄得我還有點不好意思。所以那時候決定這次服務必須作為鉑金會員給個差評。

不過後來22號晚上的客房服務非常好，一個小姐姐送被子時候温柔又耐心。把下午的火氣也消出了不少。而使得我把服務又改成五星的是23號晚上的門僮小哥，還是東大堂。點了奶茶過去外賣櫃取，小夥子一路熱情幫忙，還特意告訴我可以用外賣機器人送餐，怕我不會還演示了一下。其實這服務我很多年前三亞就用過，但是小夥子確實認真又負責我也沒好意思打斷，加上早餐服務還不錯，就改成五星了。主要也怕打了兩顆星，總被找太麻煩

最後就是貴賓樓還可以，這次一直在外面玩，沒怎麼回酒店，也就沒有升級，老樓房況還是差了一點，如果不介房間老舊，又喜歡性價比高的人，可以選擇舊樓，性價比很高。

位置：緊鄰地鐵交通便利 離錦江也很近 可惜酒店這一側江邊在施工 被圍擋圍住 不能通行
設施：年頭太長了 陳舊 沒有單獨的淋浴房 要站在浴缸裏洗澡 同時隔音非常差 隔壁和樓道都能聽得很清楚 
景觀：分配到樓道盡頭的房間 衹能看到牆和屋頂煙筒 家人分配的房間位於樓道中間 能看到園區 所以景觀好不好看房間吧
服務：第一天接待的南樓禮賓部胖胖的男工作人員 （很抱歉沒記住名字）以及辦理退房的李勇見經理和李一行都很熱情解決問題很快
餐飲：早餐正常 該有的都有 晚餐在四樓川菜餐廳吃過一次 味道還可以 但人均200+ 性價比很低

msg:設施實在是太有年代歷史感了，本來是想來住這種有歷史感的酒店，成都的錦江賓館應該像南京的金陵飯店是這座城市的地標和驕傲的，但是最後讓我失望了。

🚗 交通：交通沒的説地鐵口旁邊，方便

🧹衞生：最最不滿意，要無煙房，最後屋子裡有煙灰，打了電話，服務人員來了，加一個領班，第一時間就説去看看，發現煙灰後拍攝發送到微信羣裏，讓客房阿姨打掃之後沒有任何歉意，直接就走了，這是一家五星級酒店應該有的服務嗎？中檔酒店裡麪都沒見過這麼離譜的處理方式，差評。
🍃環境：更不用説了，已經不是歷史感了，太滄桑了，抽屜一拉就掉下來。
未來不會選擇了。

其實衹需要給房門的門鎖，加點潤滑油即可改善，中間有何工作人員反應過，根本沒人管。

msg:位置靠近市中心 地鐵站100米左右 非常方便市內遊玩 因此安排了連住四晚 
由於怕基礎房間太差 沒有窗户 訂的都是行政房（費用600 基礎房間300多 差不多翻倍了）但是行政房實在是有點小 隔壁房間有陽台可能會顯得舒服點（應該是一個房型 但是我們沒有被安排到）辦入住時候諮詢可否免費升級房型 前台小哥哥一臉不悦 説目前沒有房可以升級 其他工作人員還是比較好的服務意識 但是衝著這個小哥哥衹能給服務4星
設施的話 房間比較侷促上面已經提到了 其次泳池實在是有點差 通過很窄的過道走過去 更衣室就是一個臨時搭建的過道 狹窄無比 勉強有三個淋浴間（會經常排隊）同時還沒有桑拿房等 泳池沒有分開泳道 有小孩玩水導致浪很大 會影響游泳和有潛在風險。同時去游泳那天 給我櫃子裏面有紙屑沒有收拾 估計是用完不會搞衞生的。
自助早餐比較實惠 訂的時候100就有雙人 款式比較少 不過吃飽是可以的 但是有點不得不提出 就是咖啡太難喝了 並不是現磨的 而是做好放到壺裡麪 做完一個長期不需要加奶加糖的人來説 這種咖啡沒有咖啡味 而且苦的不加糖加奶實在無法喝進去。
雖然本酒店是歷史般的存在 比美廣州白天鵝 但是從硬件 軟件來説 都有比較大的空間 在同價格上選擇 目前按這種水平是不會選擇的

前台給升級的客房房間有可以打開的陽台，休息時看看户外景色，非常不錯的。
酒店早餐品種豐富，可以吃到廣東早茶的品種，着實讓我驚喜！

msg:餐廳管理有問題。吃早飯時這兩位廚師一直大聲討論麻將技術，之後又找別的廚師要煙，感覺就像路邊蒼蠅館子的作風，毫無五星酒店的服務意識。這麼喜歡打麻將嗎？太自由散漫了。
