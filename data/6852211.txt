The facilities are great, spacious, bright and clean, with proper five-star standards and very cost-effective. The heating is sufficient. Breakfast was also good. Self-driving parking is also very convenient. There is an underground parking lot and there are many parking spaces on the ground.

msg:It looks like an old star-rated hotel. The lobby is very grand and there are two classic cars. It is just a tourist group hotel. Breakfast is from 6:30 to 9:30. The room facilities are outdated. It takes a long time to wait for hot water and it is lukewarm. of. There is nothing in the refrigerator in the room, but they still have to charge a 500 deposit and check the room. Are you afraid that the guests will move the TV? The entertainment facilities were stated in the elevator, but even after asking the front desk, they were not open because there were almost no individual travelers. We were deceived by the five-diamond reviews on Ctrip. What was even more frightening was that there were iron screws in the soybeans for breakfast. It would be unimaginable if it got stuck in the mouth or swallowed. After the incident happened, I contacted the restaurant waiter and the manager, but no one came to deal with it. When I checked out, I told the front desk that someone would reply. After I left, a person who claimed to be the deputy manager of the restaurant called me and said that it was because our dining time was too late. The management staff didn't go to work in the morning, so no one came to deal with it. It's really ridiculous. The boss of this restaurant is so kind to his employees. Dining starts at 8:30 and the restaurant manager doesn't have to go to work until 9 o'clock. I can only say that the guests are lucky not to be poisoned. The opinion is that we will give us a discount next time we stay...haha...thank you, there will be no next time, and there will be people to contact us later. The whole communication process is completely negative, the purpose is not to write a bad review, I never thought about what happens if the guest is unlucky What will be the result? Do you still want to solve the problem? I really don’t know where Ctrip’s five-diamond reviews for such a hotel come from. Has Ctrip really managed to maintain its profits by selling good reviews? Please stop deceiving users. . This is the first time after using Ctrip for so long that I would like to thank you for such a long review. Thank you very much!

He saw that I was on my menstrual period and called the room to send sanitary napkins to the room. He also asked about the comfort of the pillow. Makes me feel very warm! The room has a wide view and the bed is comfortable! There was also a handsome guy who was very enthusiastic and attentive. Seeing that it was inconvenient for us to carry our luggage, he helped us take the car to the room and gave us welcome fruit. He also introduced that the surrounding food is very delicious and the price is cheap! The location of the hotel is very good, very close to the city center and the surrounding environment is very comfortable. I really like the decoration and design of this room. It feels very modern, the facilities are very complete, the bathroom is clean, and the bed is very comfortable, which makes me feel like home.
