msg:Booked a family room for 3 people. We’re a family on a quick business trip. The hotel had just opened, everything looked new and clean. The service was good as well. The hotel was not far from the factory we were visiting, so for us the location was just right. However, if you’re staying on a vacation, the location might not be ideal because it is quite far from both Ningbo and Zhoushan’s urban centres and major attractions. The hotel is located in a quiet area surrounded by hills and nearby villages. The breakfast buffet was decent. Overall, it was a good experience.

msg:A very good hotel. It just opened last year. The lobby manager and the girls at the front desk are very, very nice. He told me where I could play and where I could eat, and he also gave us small gifts to make us feel at home. ￼Highly recommended to stay. ￼The only thing that is a little embarrassing is that the doors to the bathroom and shower room are made of transparent glass, which is a little awkward￼

msg:Facilities: The room is of moderate size, and overall it can meet the quasi-five-star standard, because the facilities are relatively new, even better than many old five-star brands, and the parking lot has many parking spaces and is very convenient;
Environment: Overall it’s pretty good. It’s very quiet at night. I drove around the island at night. I think this is the most comfortable hotel on the island. The sound insulation is also pretty good;
Service: You can feel that if the hair dryer is broken or there is a problem with the water in the sink, someone will come to the door as soon as possible;
Make some suggestions:
The room can be equipped with latex pillows as standard and buckwheat pillows (full buckwheat pillows) as an option. The sleeping configuration needs to be improved.

Imagine staying in the hotel continuously, and the aunt didn't even close the bathroom door after cleaning. What should I do if I lose something? There were also slippers that had not been replenished, so I asked them to deliver them, including asking for help to bring a signature pen. He said that he was very busy and had to go to the front desk to find it himself. He also said that the robot was also busy, but the snacks ordered through the hotel app were delivered quickly by the robot. Come here, I can only hehe. Traveled all the way to Ningbo and Zhoushan, this hotel has the worst service

The breakfast coffee machine is well received. Don’t put the soup in the small ravioli and eat it dry. There are no other highlights.
There is a seaside park near the hotel where you can enjoy the sunset by the Jintang Bridge

Environment: Absolutely satisfied, the hardware is very good and very new.
Breakfast: Because the price is not high, it's okay.
The location is relatively remote, but it is very suitable for going to Mount Putuo. Will come again next time.
The service attitude is very good, the first choice is recommended, and the price performance ratio is super high.
There is a fairy mountain around, which can be driven to 3/4 height, and it is difficult to find the intersection on the road.

msg:Advantages: As soon as you enter the hotel lobby, you can smell a faint fragrance; this is a plus for first-time guests. Since the hotel has only been in operation for one year, the facilities in both the public area and the guest rooms are brand new and fully equipped. The quality of the disposable slippers in the room is very good, the number of towels provided is sufficient, and the quality of the towels is also acceptable.
Points for improvement: 1. The interface displayed by the TV in the room after power is turned off is not friendly and is not conducive to the operation of the elderly. The TV high-definition channel cannot be turned on immediately. This must be complained about. 2. The variety choices for breakfast should be more abundant, such as porridge, there is only one kind of white porridge; the miscellaneous grains are only sweet potatoes; it is best to have whole wheat varieties for toast; there are fried dough sticks but no soy milk; the reason for making the suggestion of convenient breakfast is that Compared to the house price. Slightly lower than expected. 3. The bathroom in the room lacks a clothes hook, which is inconvenient. 4. The automatic butt-washing toilet sprays water too frequently. As soon as you sit on it, you will be sprayed with water. I don’t know if it is a mode problem or if it is broken. There is no research or repair. 5. The central air conditioner in the guest rooms in the building may not have fresh air, so the smell in the room is not good. The first feeling of entering the guest room is not as good as entering the lobby.

Overall, the stay is quite satisfactory, but since I used to work in the hotel industry, I made some personal suggestions based on the room rate I paid for reference. Hope the hotel business is getting better and better. Thanks.

msg:The location of the hotel is on the first island that just entered the Zhoushan Islands. It is a solitary type, but the hotel is very new and the service is very good. Because the prices of other hotels take off during the holidays, the price is acceptable. For those who are not in a hurry It's still fine for us. I have to praise the front desk, the guys and girls are very nice.
Secondly, the food in the Chinese restaurant is very good, and the price is also very reasonable. Because the family of 5 was tired and hungry from the journey, they ordered 6-7 dishes, and the chefs prepared them in ten minutes, and the taste was also very good. very happy!
The breakfast buffet is also good. I made a cup of coffee to take away, hahaha! It is my only consolation in this trip, because it is the itinerary and hotel that I booked the whole time. This one is very satisfactory (because the latter is very dissatisfied) and the contrast is extremely strong. I’ll come again next time!

msg:This hotel in Jintang is considered a relatively good hotel. The hotel is marked with a 5-star rating, but I asked the guest room twice to provide an iron. The customer decisively said no and confirmed that there was no one! ! I just want to ask if you have a five-star laundry room? The basic daily necessities that should be provided are not available. How dare you mark it as 5 stars? The water pressure of the faucet is very small, so let’s not talk about it. Finally, when we checked out, the facial cleanser and hair care products fell into the bathroom. I called the hotel back and the hotel said no! I searched several times but couldn't find it. When I said I wanted to make a complaint, the product miraculously appeared again! I just want to ask about this hotel. We were urged to check out. Why didn’t you take the initiative to tell us to leave the hotel after cleaning? Said that the aunt threw it away by herself. I want to complain about this product and found it the next day? The service is really not flattering. The hardware facilities are seriously incomplete. The price is seriously inconsistent. The main reason is the attitude. The guests lost their things in the guest room and did not take the initiative to contact them. Poor review!

The geographical location in Jintang is relatively remote and basically there is no village in front of it or any store in the back. It can only be used as a transfer from Zhujiajian Pier in Putuo Mountain. It is still nearly 80 kilometers away. It takes 1 hour and 15 minutes to drive if there is no traffic jam. If there is a traffic jam, it will be 1 hour and 15 minutes. Unpredictable
The breakfast room is like a vegetable market, noisy
Not necessary, not recommended to stay
