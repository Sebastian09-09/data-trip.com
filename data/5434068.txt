Spectacular location. Restaurant was fantastic. Enjoyed the gym and the massage was very helpful too. Laundry service was efficient.

The view from my room was spectacular. The room was beautiful and spacious. As expected of Banyan Tree. Brat hitel to stay in the area.

msg:This time, the experience of Banyan Tree Jiuzhaigou was very good.
The room was very clean. Xiao Zuo and Xiao Zhou at the front desk were very considerate. We often stay at Banyan Tree.
Since it was the off-season, there were not many people.
So the stay was very intimate.
It felt very good.
Also, we stayed for many days in a row. When we returned to the hotel on the last day, the clothes for changing and washing were folded very well.
The whole experience was very good.
Everything should be people-oriented.
The experience of staying in Chongyue Rongzhuang is very different from that of ordinary homestays.
The materials used and the location are very different.
The Banyan Tree Jiuzhaigou is on a mountain peak.
So all you can see are mountain peaks and cloud views.
Because there are many hotels in Jiuzhaigou that are in the valley,
their landscapes are completely different.

The road up the mountain here is an easy road. After staying in several hotels on the mountain, I found that this mountain road is really nothing. In Sichuan, hotels with snow-capped mountain views are all on the mountain.
2. The hotel's hardware and software services match the level. Liu Jun, the front desk staff, and other service staff are very friendly.
3. The hotel's lake view is average, and the best view is the lawn outside the lobby. It's a pity that it was cloudy when I checked in, otherwise I could see the sunrise. The scenery of the hotel is still great

You can feel the thoughtful surprise every day. I am also very grateful to Peter, the concierge supervisor, for taking us on a sightseeing bus to visit the hotel lawn. The explanation was very in place and his attitude was very enthusiastic.
Secondly, it can be regarded as a hotel that combines nature and modernity well. Open the curtains and you can enjoy the snow-capped mountains and canyons. The beauty of the mountains and rivers is panoramic. The lawn at the entrance of the lobby is also very suitable for taking pictures.
Finally, the hardware package is good. Gyms, restaurants, etc. are all relatively complete in Jiuzhaigou's horizontal comparison. They are suitable for vacation and recuperation and enjoying quiet and leisurely time alone.

msg:Heart-warming, warm, sincere, clean, hygienic, super five-star, good food. It is a very happy thing to stay in such a good hotel on the top of the mountain at 2500 meters. It was sunny when we went up the mountain, but it started snowing the next morning. For southerners, it was really beautiful. Although I was scared to go down the mountain, I still couldn't forget the snow scene on the mountain. The room has already been preheated, and fruits, foot bath buckets and hot water are warmly placed. Except that the toilet is not suitable for five stars. The other facilities are almost five-star, and the stay is very comfortable. The only recreational facilities are a large garden and a gym. It is recommended to turn on the heating in the public areas, otherwise the meal will be quite cold. Because there are not many people, breakfast is delivered to the room. Really very considerate! I hope more people come to the hotel. It seems a bit deserted in winter, but it is very suitable for leisure vacation (not in a hurry)

In the villages we passed, there were many kinds of fruits grown by other families, but no one picked them. They were quite beautiful hanging on the trees. The hotel's facilities are good and meet Banyan Tree standards, but the surrounding area is very quiet (desolate). I originally thought that hotel meals were expensive, but when I booked on Ctrip, there happened to be a meal coupon discount event, and the price was okay after the discount.

The chef is enthusiastic and cheerful, and he is very active and enthusiastic in communicating with guests, making people feel at home. However, it is located on the top of a mountain, which sacrifices the convenience of transportation. You have to be careful when driving on the road. There are cattle and yaks on the road that need to be avoided, especially when the road is very dark at night. We encountered two cows squatting side by side in the middle of the road. They didn't move at all when the car came. The car can only go around, hahaüòÄ

When entering the lobby, it is cold and there is no one to guide me and no one to help with the luggage... All in all, the experience is very bad.

The environment of the hotel is excellent, the breakfast options are abundant, and the service staff are not so large to match the size of the hotel, but they are very professional, efficient and enthusiastic. Thank you very much Liu Jun at the front desk for helping adjust the room, Fang Pan's humorous sharing, as well as the big beauty Yin Xiaohui who helped with the check in/out and the little brother who helped introduce the hotel and took the luggage.

The hotel‚Äôs restaurant is delicious, the prices are right, but it‚Äôs too slow, so be patient. Big Bear, who likes restaurants, is the best dinner companion for those traveling alone.

Disadvantages: It is quite far from the airport and Jiuzhai Scenic Area. It is suitable for people who want to stay away from the crowd and hide clean after visiting Jiuzhai Scenic Area. The villa complex next to the hotel has been suspended due to the epidemic, which seems a bit obtrusive.

Anyway, it was very uncomfortable to add a blockage right after I checked in, and I made up nonsense about the problems I didn't know, and I had to remind me twice if I asked for water. The hotel roll paper is shown in Figure 1. I can understand that the hotel may be environmentally friendly on the mountain, but the roll paper sent in this way is the same size. I don‚Äôt know where to sell this kind of over-used roll paper? I didn't feel the environmental protection, I only felt the little family. However, the scenery is first-rate when the clouds are scattered. Don‚Äôt care about the service. It‚Äôs worth staying. Because I was sitting and heard that guests were also calling to complain about this Banyan Tree. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an exception.

Public area. Banyan Tree Jiuzhai may not necessarily be the best Banyan Tree, but it is definitely the most beautiful Banyan Tree I have ever stayed in. , Banyan Tree Huangshan, Banyan Tree Tengchong). Figure 7 and Figure 8 are the real shots of the back mountain supporting the hotel.
landscape. This time I stayed in the far valley view arranged by Manager Zhang. Picture 5 is the balcony of the room. The sea of clouds in the morning is shocking!
food. Enjoyed breakfast and dinner this time. For breakfast, there are freshly squeezed juices and local specialty butter tea. The variety is not very rich but sufficient. The dinner was amazing, every dish was delicious, and several had the feeling of "can be so delicious".
service. Banyan Tree Jiuzhai not only maintains the consistently high level of the brand, but the professionalism and caring degree of Manager Zhang far exceeds expectations. Other employees are also very enthusiastic. There is a detail. I changed the room type experience halfway, but the restaurant where I ordered the meal has all synchronized information. It seems that the internal communication of the wine management team is very good.
Overall, very satisfied!

msg:The Banyan Tree Hotel in Jiuzhaigou is the most satisfying hotel for this trip. The location of the hotel is really unique, surrounded by beautiful scenery, facing the mountains, you can see the sunrise and the sea of clouds! The air on the top of the mountain is so good! I will definitely stay in this hotel if I have the opportunity to go there in the future!

msg:The location of the hotel is not as convenient as the InterContinental Jiuzhai Paradise. A store is located on the top of the mountain alone, it takes 30 minutes to go up the mountain, and the road is not very good. You can see cows, horses and donkeys everywhere on the mountain road, which is a kind of compensation. The privacy is very good, the quiet air is good, the hotel room is large, and the equipment is fully equipped, which is very suitable for vacation mode travel. The service is also very considerate when checking in. The ginger tea towel is also very considerate. Also waited a while, the restaurant's cost-effectiveness is worth enjoying. The only thing I felt was that the breakfast was not cost-effective and the quality was not right. Some things were not ready and the waiter did not provide the service in time. As a store of Yuerongzhuang's level, it shouldn't be right.

The hotel staff Liu Fengyi and Yin Xiaohui are great! Xiao Liu took us around the hotel‚Äôs golf course. He was humorous and very enthusiastic! However, the types of meals in the hotel are too small and the prices are high, which may be inconvenient for transportation, which is understandable! Overall, very satisfied! Suitable for lying down and emptying yourself! The scenery has nothing to say

msg:The environment is superior, the facilities are complete, but the service level is lacking.
Some level. Most former employees are willing to take the initiative to provide assistance, but the service quality only knows a rough idea, and it does not meet the standard. Obviously, the management did not provide training and make amendments in due course.

To give a few examples:
1. Ask the front desk if the hotel provides ice cream, and answer: "There is no ice cream here." As a result, when we went to the restaurant for breakfast, we picked up ice cream. Explain that employees are not clear about what services their hotel provides

2. I booked with the spa in the morning to do spa services in the afternoon. Before going there, I emphasized that they would do their Thai massage. This is one of the spa trea**ents provided by the hotel. After arriving at the spa, I reconfirmed. After waiting for 10 minutes, another employee came up and said that the hotel does not provide Thai massage services, only Thai essential oil massages. Then, if a certain service cannot be provided, why not delete it from the service list, or tell me in advance when the customer orders the trea**ent?

3. In summer, the wind blown by the room air conditioner is 29 degrees for a long time! ! ! For the first time, someone asked me how to lower the air conditioner in the room. The employee said that the hotel had just opened and the air conditioner hadn't been fixed yet (hasn't it been reopened last year, haven't it been fixed?) I slept with sweat that night Night. The next morning I called the front desk and asked them to ask the staff to come and see how to adjust the air conditioner. After waiting for two hours in the room, no one showed up. Later, the cleaning lady came and helped us bring in his foreman. Let the foreman help to see how to adjust it. The foreman replied that because many guests complained that it was cold on the mountain, the hotel did not dare to adjust the temperature of the air conditioner too low. Is the air conditioner version of the room used for decoration? Isn't the air conditioning panel installed in each room used to adjust the temperature?
Later, the foreman said that they would find someone from the engineering depar**ent to turn on the other air conditioner and it would be better. After we went to lunch for two hours, the room was as hot as it was and there was no change at all, and finally gave up. No staff came to follow up with us or communicate whether the problem has been resolved.

5. After staying there for two nights, only the former employees took the initiative to interact and greet the guests. Those dressed like foremen or management have never actively communicated or greeted the guests. It can be seen that the management also How can the hotel provide a normal level of service if you fail to do your job well?

This time I completely gave up on Banyan Tree.
