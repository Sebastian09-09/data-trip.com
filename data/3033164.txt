The hotel is clean, close to metro and other transportation. The staff is responsive 24 hours a day and they promptly arrive and take care of any need we have had. We are planning to come back and stay here again in the coming week after our travel.  
Overall a great stay and highly recommended.

Location wise, it is good.  Literally just next door you can find a decent Japanese Izakaya (居酒屋）and a respectable Cantonese restaurant.  A short drive will take you to various malls. attractions and restaurants.
The apartment was well stuffed.  What one needs are all there.  As the property is not new, there are wears-and-tears, not crumbling but.....
Front desk service staff, breakfast staff and cleaning staff are all up to par.  Friendly, warm and efficient.
Breakfast is ok, nothing to shout about but sufficient.
Cost wise,  it is good value for money.
A major downside of our stay was the jacuzzi was under maintenance, thus depriving the kids of some recreational fun.  
A slight hiccup was one of the three treadmills was down for the whole duration of our stay, depriving us of a friendly competition.
Overall, a pleasant enough stay.

I was very happy to have a dedicated dressing table in the room, but it would be more perfect if there was a makeup light. There was no plug for the makeup, but there was no place to plug the hair dryer. The hidden trash can design on the island was quite good. The overall design was very good, except that the trash can in the bathroom was a little small and the bathroom basin drained a little slowly, which was really good. By the way, the sound system was also very good, and it played Deng Ziqi's songs hahahaha! It was very close to the Olympic Sports Center, and I could walk there to listen to the concert. Unfortunately, I forgot to take pictures.

1. From check-in to check-out, the service attitude of all the staff in the apar**ent you come into contact with is extremely comfortable - no matter from the front desk to the room cleaning staff or restaurant service staff, they are all well-trained and well-behaved;
2. Since I booked an executive three-bedroom apar**ent this time, the apar**ent type, orientation and apar**ent area exceeded expectations. The central air-conditioning heating effect is also very good. When any faucet in the house is turned on, hot water is available instantly, and the kitchen appliances are complete. ;
3. A very rich and varied breakfast. It is impossible for ordinary apar**ents to provide such a rich breakfast as their home;
4. Beds and bedding products that are very suitable for human sleep. This is also important.
…
In short, all the details seem to verify one truth: the management level of this apar**ent is very high. Next time I come to Tianjin, I will definitely stay with them. It is also highly recommended to everyone who sees this to come here, stay and experience the authenticity I mentioned, and discover more highlights and surprises.

The shortcomings are that one of the floor tiles in the room is a little warped, making it a little clinking when walking. The waiter needs to improve the speed of delivering things.

I stayed here many years ago, and two or three years have passed in the blink of an eye. The room facilities are well maintained, and the decoration style is not outdated. One of the sinks outside the master bedroom is a bit blocked, but everything else is fine.
The bed is moderately soft and hard, but the disadvantages are: the pillows are uncomfortable, the rebound is not good, the quilt is thick, and the air conditioner needs to be turned on in autumn.

health:
The bedding was pretty good, the bath towels and towels were a bit old, and the room was kept fresh and clean.

environment:
The environment in the hotel is very good, the room is large, the ceiling is high, and it doesn't look depressing. There is Luckin on the first floor, which is convenient.

First of all, the location is on the Olympic Sports Road. It is very convenient to walk to the Olympic Sports Center. You can also park for free. After watching the concert, you can stroll back and go back. It is super convenient. There are also entertainment facilities such as children's slides near the entrance of the Olympic Sports Center, which children like very much. The hotel service staff is warm and hospitable. If you arrive before 12 o'clock, you can check in in advance.
As far as the rooms are concerned, this apar**ent-style hotel is much more comfortable than a regular hotel. It feels like home. This time, I upgraded to a two-bedroom room for free. The room is very clean, large in size, stylishly decorated and equipped with new facilities, and the living room is large and open. Kitchen, refrigerator, washing machine, coffee machine, very suitable for family travel. The master bedroom has a wardrobe, a bathroom, and a bathtub. Lying on the bed, you can enjoy the Tianjin TV Tower opposite. There is also a bathroom, which does not interfere with each other. The bedding is comfortable, and each room is equipped with a TV.
The hotel needs to swipe the card to go upstairs, the security is very good, and there is Luckin Coffee in the lobby, which is also very convenient. In addition to the Olympic Sports Center, the hotel is also very close to the Tianjin Zoo. You can go to see Xile, the second aunt of Balitai. For those who come to the Olympic Sports Center to participate in concerts and other activities, it is highly recommended to live here.

The room is hygienic and clean! fully equipped. I bought fruits and drinks and put them in the refrigerator. I felt like I was at home at that moment. The room I booked is a three-bedroom one. There are two bathrooms. Suitable for 6 people. The space is well planned; even if there are many people staying there, they won't disturb each other. The service staff here are very friendly. Attentive service. Next time you come to Tianjin, you will definitely choose this place.

I arrived that morning, and the lady at the front desk not only welcomed me warmly, but also upgraded me to a two-bedroom suite for free. The indoor area is large, fully equipped, clean and tidy... It's a pity that I only stayed here for one night. Leave some regrets and go again next time.

Facilities: The facilities in the room are not old, but the floor tiles make a sound when stepped on, and they will warp, and it is easy to fall over if you are not careful.

Environment: The toilet bowl is too small, the toilet seat is broken, the silicone area has turned black and looks a bit disgusting, there is a problem with the washbasin and bathroom sewerage
Cleanliness: The carpet was black, and there was a half-empty water bottle next to the bed on the day of check-in.
The food for breakfast is very scarce. After nine o'clock, it feels like everything is leftover from other people's food.
The price-performance ratio is okay, if you don't care about these things, you can stay here

1. The cleaning is average, I mopped the floor carefully by myself;
2. After checking in, the shower gel in the master bedroom was empty, and the plug of the master bedroom sink was broken.
The advantages are also obvious:
The hotel service is as good as always, especially after China Merchants Group took over, you can feel the enthusiasm of Tianjin people + Shenzhen service awareness, which has improved a lot compared to before. When taking the elevator downstairs, I met a Tianjin employee sister, who would also greet me enthusiastically, take the initiative to ask which floor the car was parked, and give me enthusiastic directions. The brother and sister on duty at the front desk on New Year's Eve and New Year's Eve were also very enthusiastic, thumbs up!

msg:Since I checked in yesterday, everything has been pretty good, but there is one thing that I can't bear the most, and it is a mistake that ordinary hotels don't make. It is really speechless that a high-end apar**ent hotel like yours can still do this.
The room price I chose was 611, and when I checked in, the beauty at the front desk said that I would charge 1100, including a deposit of 500 yuan, which would not be the full amount. I called the front desk and said that there is no problem with the amount, no one will charge you 11 yuan, but won't the guests who stay in this way feel comfortable and understand? And when I explained this situation to you, you actually laughed. I really wanted to change my serious attitude and ask you why you were laughing? I don't believe that you and your future family members can still laugh when encountering such a situation? I just don't understand that since you don't erase the zero, you can charge the full amount. Why is it too tiring for you to type a few more numbers?
This is just a small episode. I hope that guests who choose to stay in their home in the future must ask the front desk in advance after reading my review.
There are additional points: 1. It is best if there are related equipment in the room when you check in. Like last night, I troubled the customer service maintenance personnel to see the operation of the washing machine. 3. Since you can cook with kitchen utensils and utensils, your hotel also provides soot and sauces in the lobby on the first floor. This is very considerate, but can you put some in the room to remind guests to see it, or say something when you check in. If you don’t go to the first floor to buy Ruixing coffee, no one will go to see this. Don't look at the writing paper, because no one wants to drag their tired body to read those small prints. But I still have to praise myself. Although I cooked meals, before I checked out, I cleaned all the pots and pans, wiped the operating table, and put the garbage in bags or trash cans. At that time, it was based on making a good impression on each other, although the hotel might not take these trivial things to heart.
Anyway, that's all, this time I chose this hotel because I wanted to watch a concert, but it gave me a very bad impression, and it is almost impossible not to choose this hotel when I come to the nearby area in the future. PS: I don't have any bad comments for you, so don't contact me because of this after seeing it, it will only make my impression of your hotel worse!

msg:1. A little strange thing is: you also need an ID card when taking care of children. Traveling through most of China, some children do not need to be registered, some need to be registered in writing, and here is the only place where children’s documents are required. It doesn't matter in itself, but you don't need it when going to other hotels in Tianjin. The most incomprehensible thing is that the employee used his own mobile phone to take a photo of our family. It's not the camera from the public security system. It was very confusing and felt unsafe. 2. Most of the people staying in the hotel are Japanese. The TV content played in the breakfast room is also Japanese variety shows from Japan, and they only show Japanese ones, not domestic or international ones. I thought it was a Japanese tour group, but after asking, I found out that it was not the case. But there are many Japanese here who have lived here for a long time. During the whole breakfast process, I found that there were only two Chinese tables, while Japanese ones were filling in one after another. Those who had finished eating were leaving, and those who had just arrived were seated. They spoke in Japanese, nodding and bowing. If you like Japanese style, you can come and take a stroll. 3. The room layout is reasonable, spacious and comfortable. The location is easy to find, and there is a parking space. If you can't find a space, just tell the staff and they will help adjust it.

Quality evaluation
And it's not obvious. There is no parking space in the afternoon on weekends, and it is inconvenient to leave a phone call to move the car at any time.
The check-in is very fast, and the list and room card are ready in advance, and you can check in after face verification, which is more convenient. There is a coffee shop on the first floor and breakfast on the third floor.
The breakfast restaurant is small in size, very quiet, and the environment is very good. Bread, milk, salad, porridge, hot dishes, eggs, juice, etc. are all available, and the categories are quite complete. There is also natto, which should be much better than the Japanese.
There is also a gym and a children's playground on the third floor, which are not too big. My second baby can play in it for a while.
This time, the whole family moved into a three-bedroom apar**ent with a kitchen, a storage room, and two bathrooms. Kitchen utensils, refrigerators, washing machines, etc. are all available, and the room is fairly spacious. There is a bathtub, but the floor is slippery, and a baby cot and humidifier are provided. It is also noisy at night with the windows closed, and the cars downstairs are loud. It's cool to open the window, but 3 mosquitoes flew in, tossing for half a day all night.
There is a supermarket downstairs, which is very convenient for shopping. There are also express cabinets, where you can order takeaway. It is worth mentioning that it takes only a few minutes to walk to the stadium, and you can take your baby for a walk in the morning
Seeing a lot of running citizens, I envy this kind of place where free venues can be used for exercise, and the surrounding riverside walks are also very good.

In short, it is much better than a normal five-star hotel double room! The front desk service is warm and gentle, Luckin is in the lobby, super convenient! I originally wanted to post a few pictures of the room, but my luggage is too messy, so I can only post a picture of coffee.
The location is also very good, there is a free parking lot for self-driving cars, there is a convenience store downstairs, the subway is diagonally opposite, and it is very convenient to take a taxi on the roadside. The night view is beautiful, close to the Olympic Sports Center, and there is a training center of the Agricultural Bank of China in front of it. My father is an old agricultural banker. He has retired for almost ten years. He always said that he participated in the training of cadres in Tianjin 20 years ago, but he has never been to Tianjin since then. The first time I found out that the previous training place was next door to the hotel. I was so excited. The main point was to revisit the old place!
In short, I am very satisfied. My parents are very satisfied with the food, accommodation and play in Tianjin this time. Before leaving, I went shopping at Wuqing Outlets. Everyone came back with a full load. It was a very good experience!

Although it was opened in 2016, the maintenance is very poor, and the corners of the bathroom are not clean. It's okay, short-term rental is OK, but long-term rental is not as good as the Fraser Suites in Beijing, Bangkok, and Singapore. There is no swimming pool, but there is Luckin Coffee in the lobby downstairs.

It’s only two kilometers to the Sky Tower and Water Park, and it’s easy to call a taxi!

However, we checked in after 3 o'clock and the room has not been cleaned up. We waited for more than ten minutes, which is not good. In addition, Ctrip will deduct the full room rate in advance, and you need to pay the full room rate plus a deposit for check-in, which is inconvenient.

It may be very cheap because the location is far from the scenic spot, but it is not a problem at all for self-driving tours. It is very suitable for a large family to live in. It feels much better for a family to live in one big suite than to live in several standard rooms.

建議：更換浴缸的洗手間的漱口杯（淺綠色），清洗後倒立在杯墊上非常容易粘住，同時因為這款杯子太薄，很容易碎，傷手。希望可以更換成另一個洗手間淺粉色那款（較厚），更適合，更安全。

唯一缺點停車較難，酒店門口就幾個車位，得停到路邊，路邊停車不花錢，但是得走幾步。樓下還有一個便利蜂。
