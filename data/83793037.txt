msg:The Hilton Fengxiang Shanghai emerges as a breathtaking oasis, gracefully nestled within a picturesque countryside adorned with lakes and bridges, crafting a nearly magical ambiance. The hotel's architecture is inviting, boasting a sparkling cleanliness that extends from its wide entrance to the expansive and supremely comfortable rooms. However, it primarily caters to a Chinese clientele, evidenced by the significant language barrier as almost none of the staff speak English. This aspect may challenge guests hoping to explore the surroundings, given the hotel's seclusion and the necessity to commute by taxi to the nearest town or further to central Shanghai, the train station, and the airport.

The dining experience, while offering a rich and fresh breakfast tailored more towards local tastes, reveals operational surprises during dinner times at its three restaurants, where the staff often seem unprepared for guests, resulting in lengthy waits for meals. Despite these hiccups, the food quality remains high throughout the stay.

The hotel's serene environment, often quiet during the week, provides an ideal setting for relaxation, mindfulness, and sensory enjoyment. Yet, the atmosphere shifts dramatically during events like weekend seminars when the hotel fills to capacity.

For visitors engaged with the nearby industrial zone, the Hilton Fengxiang Shanghai offers an excellent retreat for evening relaxation and morning meetings. Nevertheless, Western tourists seeking a vacation spot may find the hotel less accommodating unless they speak Chinese or have a specific reason for their stay, prompting them to reconsider their choice.

Hilton Shanghai Fengxian Hotel
SincerelyüëçExceeded my expectations
Flore must be praised for his excellent front desk serviceüòÑ
Seeing our two mothers with their children, we upgraded to a suite üÜì! It‚Äôs so niceüòÑ
Welcome fruit and first round of minibar are included
I am really satisfied with this price on May DayüòÑ
It was really fun for the kids to chase around in the suite.
The suite has one bedroom, one living room and two bathrooms
Dry and wet separation
Super considerate‚úåÔ∏è
Neither child has to worry about hygiene issues
There is also a bathtub for bathing üõÄThe two children had a great time playing
The most important thing as a five-star hotel is that in addition to online services
There are so many parent-child activities üëç
Small trains, racing carsüèéÔ∏è, handicrafts, water paddle boardsüö¥, digging in the sand for treasure hunts, bubblesü´ßall kinds of parent-child activities are also awesome
You can literally free your hands
In addition, the hotel also has a cute pet paradise.

Feeding carrots are also very reasonably priced

The downside was that the minibar was a little lacking in items, and the TV could only watch live broadcasts, not playback or screen projection. I was very satisfied with the facilities. I tried the gym and swimming pool. It was rare to find such a complete gym in a hotel. The swimming pool was just a little too crowded with children, haha. The breakfast was very good and varied. I felt that it was almost the best of the resort hotels I have stayed in. I could eat until almost noon, and the environment outside was also very good. I could take a walk after eating.

msg:I stayed there for two days during the May Day holiday. The experience was not bad, but just unsatisfactory. On the day of arrival, I was told at the entrance that I could only park in the underground parking lot, but the underground parking lot was also full of cars. I had to put my things down first and then drive a little further to find a parking space. Or I could go directly to the lobby door on the second floor, but the waiter at the door asked us to go directly to the underground parking lot.
We were told that none of the more than 200 rooms were cleaned during the holidays. We arrived at 3 o'clock and finally checked in at about 4:30). Finally, they said they would send us a late check-out. . But we didn't need it.
Room facilities:
The floor is a bit sticky, and wearing slippers will stick to your feet. The sound is very loud, and the sound insulation is very poor. When there are many children, the sound comes one after another. The air conditioner in the room can't be lowered even when it is turned on at 16¬∞. It feels that the air conditioner is broken. Finally, I learned that the cooling is turned off, and there is only air supply. Maybe the large passenger flow has left, so the money-saving mode is turned on, and finally the air conditioner is sent up.
Bed:
Smaller than the one at home, family hotels should be bigger, many children sleep with their parents, I feel the room design is not designed for family hotels.
In addition, I have a complaint, some children set off fireworks downstairs at almost 10 o'clock in the evening, which seriously affected our baby's sleep. I called the front desk manager to complain, and the other party said that this is a suburb and there is no ordinance prohibiting fireworks, so we can only give up.
Restaurant:
The Japanese restaurant only has the set meal on the review, maybe it's like this during holidays, there is no other choice. The cafe is OK, cost-effective, just buy the environment. When there are many people in the breakfast buffet, many of the food can't be replenished in time.

msg:Because of the bad weather, the original plan to go to the zoo had to be cancelled. I found this parent-child hotel temporarily. I didn't expect it to be better than expected.
First, the hotel facilities and services are in line with Hilton's standards, and the staff are very enthusiastic.
Second, the surrounding environment is very beautiful. It is very comfortable to walk around the hotel or rent a bicycle. There are many activities for children to play, such as feeding small animals, digging sand, riding a small train, and booking children's activities organized by the hotel to kill time.
Third, although there are not many dishes in the Chinese restaurant, the taste is good, light and delicious, and the breakfast is also rich. The fruit and vegetable juices can be freshly squeezed. It is the first time I have seen a hotel breakfast offering spicy crayfish all you can eat.
There are also some disadvantages. As a parent-child hotel, it does not provide bed enclosures, which is not very convenient. The indoor parent-child park only has ocean balls. It would be better if there were more entertainment facilities for children, such as Lego.

Parent-child facilities: The things are relatively old, and there is a beach outdoors where you can dig sand. There is nothing in the indoor children's park, and some paid rocking toys are basically broken. It is recommended to strengthen daily maintenance
Environment: There is a large garden park. Due to time reasons, the swimming pool and garden in the middle are not fully open.
Dining: The Chinese restaurant experience is very good, and Hilton members can get discounts. The food level exceeds that of most hotels.
Service: The lobby service is very poor. You need to ask for the cute pet park experience voucher in the package yourself, and it is not provided at all. When arranging rooms, you either lock the room or there is no room.
I saw some guests who had not completed the check-in at four or five o'clock. The lobby is very noisy, and the front desk sales did not deal with or appease them. It is completely a human-shaped sign. It is recommended to optimize the front desk service

There are so many people that there is no queue at the door. They are all scrambling for seats on the spot. It's speechless. The service is completely unmatched, like a vegetable market. The most unsatisfactory thing is the quilt in the room. There is a rustling sound, which affects sleep. It is said to be a parent-child hotel, but the bed is super small and there is no small bed to add. The hotel charges for all children's play, and the price is very high. Children like the cute pet park and sand digging. In short, the experience is very bad and disappointing. It is not recommended to stay

The hotel housekeeper Flore's advance arrangements were also very thoughtful. The baby bed was prepared in advance, the room was upgraded, and there were welcome fruits, baby toothbrushes and slippers. Flore's response speed and the room attendants were very efficient! The hotel has a wide variety of children's entertainment facilities, including a small train, electric bicycles, a cute pet park, an ocean ball pool, and a library living room where you can watch cartoons. The outdoor sand pit is not big, but it is enough! There is also a sink nearby. Older children can also go to the swimming pool, play billiards, table tennis, basketball machines, indoor go-karts, and outdoor lake windsurfing projects. The hotel also has a mahjong room and a singing room for adults. Originally, I booked two nights and applied for late check-out. In the end, I couldn't stand the baby's love for small animals and stayed for another night, so that the babies could have more fun! There is a Qingxi Ancient Town near the hotel, which is a 10-minute drive away. In terms of food, the Chinese restaurant is delicious, but the food was not prepared enough on the night of 5/1, and the service was a bit slow; the buffet restaurant has a small hot pot for dinner. Although there are not many varieties, the classics are all there, and the taste is good. ps: The variety and number of animals in this hotel are really large. üòâ

msg:The eighth hotel I stayed in with my baby
- About 1 hour drive from downtown Shanghai
- Ctrip membership benefits include free room upgrade and delayed check-out until 2pm. The king-size bed room has a garden view and free minibar
- The 55-square-meter room may be rectangular in shape, the bedroom space is not that spacious, and it is nice to have a balcony
- Children's club on the first floor, ocean balls are free, basketball machines are 10 yuan/game, karts are 138 yuan/8 minutes for hotel guests, and table tennis is charged. The outdoor park train is 38 yuan, and the leisure car is 70 yuan/30 minutes for two people and 150 yuan/60 minutes for four people.
- Mee, the all-day restaurant on the first floor: There is a small hot pot for the buffet dinner, but the overall variety of meals is not particularly large, and the taste is average ~ 656 for two adults and one child. Breakfast must be staggered during holidays! There are so many people after 8 am, even if there are temporary seats or even the Japanese restaurant next door is opened, you still have to queue up
- The cute pet park is comparable to a small zoo, with so many varieties! White foxes, various rabbits, black chickens, chickens, Call ducks, capybaras, goats, sheep, cows, yaks, Samoyeds, sika deer, pigs, peacocks, turkeys, pigeons, camels, ponies, and fishing by the river... 38 yuan per person, carrots and feed bags can be fed to the whole place, except for the white foxes and Samoyeds who eat meat
- An absolute parent-child pet-friendly hotel, with children of all ages and various furry children everywhere during holidays
- Finally, a complaint: I returned to the room at night and found that the room was not cleaned or turned over at night... Maybe the occupancy rate was too high and there were not enough staff, so the room attendant did not come to the room to clean until 7 o'clock in the evening. Then the baby vomited on the quilt, and a cleaning fee of 200 yuan was charged when checking outüò¢

The hotel is labeled as a parent-child hotel, but it is not fun at all. There is only one ocean ball indoors, and there is not even a slide. The outdoor sand pool, borrowing the words of passers-by, looks like it was pulled from a construction site... The food and beverage is also average. There is no baby meal. You have to wait 2 hours for a single order. So don't come if you have a baby of a few months old. It is very inconvenient. There is no bed fence.

msg:I went to visit the graves during the Qingming Festival. I was worried about the traffic jam on the road, so I booked the Hilton Hotel next to it. The result was completely beyond my expectations! The hotel covers a large area, with its own landscaping and pet park. The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe standard room is also large, which should be more than 50 square meters, and the hardware is good. The most satisfactory thing is the service. I have stayed in many five-star hotels at home and abroad, and the service of this hotel impressed me. Whether it is the lobby manager, the chef of the lobby bar, the little sister and brother of the Chinese kitchen, or Manager Yang of the Western restaurant, they all answer questions and are proactive and enthusiastic, which really makes people feel at home. The taste of breakfast and dinner is very good. Now that the economy is down, it is not easy to operate a five-star hotel! I sincerely hope that such boutique hotels can get better and better. As a Shanghainese, we will definitely support them.

Children will be very happy when summer comes. The only regret is that the water temperature in the swimming pool is too low, and I can't stand it after swimming for a while. Flore at the front desk was very helpful and helped me upgrade to a lake view room, and also gave me fruit and children's breakfast. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience.

Because of the elderly front desk manager Kong Yangyang, he not only upgraded the lake view room, but also gave us a cake and fruit plate and extended the check-out time. The thoughtful and warm service made us feel at home. I was feeling unwell while eating at a Chinese restaurant in the evening, so a handsome guy working in the restaurant kindly asked the kitchen to make a bowl of vegetarian noodle soup. Breakfast is also standard for international hotel chains. The landscape outside is pretty like a big park and a petting paradise for small animals. The small bridges and flowing water give it an idyllic scene. It‚Äôs rare to be happy when the sun shines brightly. The smell of spring is blowing in your face. The rapeseed is blooming.

It is hard to imagine that this is a 5-star hotel and the price is not cheap. buffet dinner. The overall environment of the hotel is comfortable. It will be even more comfortable if it is hot.

msg:I went there with my two dogs. When I first entered, the waiter was very nice. He also had a pet passport and gave the two dogs Polaroids. They were quite loving! But when I started checking in, I just kept going!
1. I booked a pet room. When I booked it, the instructions above did not say that there would be an extra charge for adding an extra pet. However, when I arrived at the site, the price was raised. It said that adding an extra dog would cost 600 more for the cleaning fee? One dog lives in the house, and two dogs live in the house, and I have two small dogs. But we said we couldn‚Äôt live in the house anymore and had to check out, so we didn‚Äôt charge the extra 600 cleaning fee. This is outrageous! It‚Äôs simply a scam!
2. When we first entered the room, there was dust on the floor and chairs (there are pictures to prove it). We asked the waiter to clean it again later.
3. There are only four or five napkins in the room
4. I have to take a shower at night and the water is still cold even after 5 minutes. Call the maintenance man to solve the problem.
5. When I woke up in the morning, I didn‚Äôt know where the garbage was blowing on the ground (see picture)
6. When I first woke up in the morning, my toes seemed to have scratched something. When I got up, I saw that there was a big hole in the quilt cover (see picture)
Overall, I have a very bad impression. I will not come again in the future.
7. Looking at the map of the hotel, it says that the beach park and outdoor garden are actually the same place! A small sand pit ‚ûï a swing? ? ? Just divide this place into two areas? Thank you so much! Linguistics is really good
Overall, this hotel is too small. I have never seen a cleaning fee of 600. I am speechless during this trip!

msg:We booked New Year's Eve dinner + guest room, but it was a bit slow to get accommodation on New Year's Eve. But the attitude is great.
There are a total of 8 people, including the elder and the younger, in 4 rooms. They are arranged on the first floor, which is quite good. The room is spacious and clean.
The New Year's Eve dinner in the evening was served a bit slowly, which is understandable as there are fewer waiters during the Spring Festival. Originally, I paid extra for 2 dishes in the original set menu for 6 people, but the waiter said that one of the dishes was wrong and was eaten by other customers. We asked for a refund, and the waiter was a little embarrassed. Then I said that we would deduct the money for the drinks. My husband said that as customers, we would suffer a loss. Then a person in charge came and looked at my payment certificate and said that he could not refund or pay. The price of the food can be deducted from the price of drinks. In addition, if you need meals in the next few days, you can contact him and he can arrange it. It happened that our junior was not in the hotel at noon the next day and needed to arrange lunch for the elders. The person in charge happily said that he would come We were responsible for the arrangements, so we contacted him at night and said they could arrange it the next day. Of course, we didn't communicate well. We thought it was a missed compensation for the mistake in serving food. In the end, we asked the old man for money. Of course, he later said that he could put up the room bill, but he didn't. Discount. My husband is also a staff member of a top five-star hotel. He complained that this hotel‚Äôs compensation plan is completely unfavorable to customers. The value of a dish is different from the value of a few bottles of drinks. There is no compensation plan in the future. Generally, hotels of the same level are at least There are no discounts or free dining coupons here. There is no refund or discount. They just say that the cost of drinks is free, but the customer still suffers. In fact, this experience is not very good. On the night of the second day of the ***** New Year, there was another problem with the attitude of the fat waiter who took the table at the Japanese restaurant. He ignored us who went to take the food, but the head chef and a female person in charge were very good and solved it. Generally speaking, this hotel has a high occupancy rate for many Spring Festival activities, but the service is a bit behind. It made its own mistakes and did not make up for them all. I still hope the hotel can improve this.

The hotel is very new and stylish. The service is also good, but the room is far away from the elevator. You have to walk for a long time every time you have a meal. It is really inconvenient to push a wheelchair. The front desk did not take this into consideration and did not inform you in advance!
The room is quite large and very clean! Generally speaking, this house price has a high price-to-belief ratio in the New Year!
Let‚Äôs talk about the rice restaurant first. The buffet for New Year‚Äôs Eve dinner was overall not satisfactory. The price was expensive and the dishes were average. Breakfast was also eaten at the rice restaurant. The dishes were not innovative. After staying for two days in a row, the dishes were exactly the same. The seats are too crowded and it's not convenient to walk around. There are too many guests during the New Year, and the waiters are extremely busy, but they are very polite and will meet and greet customers.
Chinese restaurant Tang has high-quality dishes, and each dish is uniquely prepared and tastes excellent. It is definitely the ceiling of Chinese food.
Afternoon Tea¬∑Nest, the environment is elegant and even more stunning outdoors, suitable for taking pictures, sipping tea and chatting in the warm afternoon.



Facilities: The gym is fully equipped, the swimming pool is clean and sanitary, and the experience is great!

Everyone was waiting in line, and finally another front desk person came. I didn't see a bellman from the moment I walked in. My parents are over 70 years old and they took their suitcases to find the room by themselves, which was a bit confusing. Another thing I want to say is that this buffet needs to be improved, both in terms of service and ingredients. The small hotpot did not turn on for 40 minutes, and the service staff looked at it and said nothing. In desperation, I had no choice but to find a way to change the heat again. In terms of cold dishes, I had cold cucumbers and grilled braised rice noodles in the evening, and the same thing for breakfast. The green beans for breakfast were not cooked. disappoint others. Of course, there is something worthy of praise. The rooms are bright and spacious, and the balcony has a beautiful view.

msg:Two days and one night of running away with the baby is just the right time to take it easy.

Service: There are not many people checking in on Friday, and our baby needs to take a nap, so we can check in early. Thanks to front office manager Lucy's warm arrangements, we also received small gifts when we checked in and checked out.

Environment: The hotel is not large but well-organized. It‚Äôs just that we walked in the wrong direction as soon as we entered the door and drove directly to the entrance of the banquet hall. It is recommended that the doorman or the signs should be clearer. The villa area is still under construction and can be repainted next time
 
Catering: I tried Tang Restaurant, but I went late at noon and ordered two dishes that were not available. The overall meal was good and had its own characteristics. The baby likes to eat hand-made fish soup very much. But my baby broke a spoon in the restaurant, so compensation was normal. However, no service staff came to ask if the guest was hurt. The restaurant couldn't provide any proof of the price. In the end, they had to ask me to pay the purchase price of 40 yuan on the pretext of asking for a financial quotation and sending it to my email. Marriott handled the same thing much better than this restaurant. Compensation is natural, but the process needs to be standardized.
Overall, it was a very happy experience. Special thanks go to Lucy for her professional and meticulous service, and the little brother at the concierge who was always busy helping us carry our luggage (seems like his surname is Shi).

msg:The hotel service is absolutely excellent, the room layout is spacious and bright, it is a five-star hotel after all, and the swimming pool is also very nice! Breakfast is my favorite. Although the breakfasts in hotels are similar, the ingredients here are really good. The taste and freshness are among the best I have ever tasted. It shows that a lot of thought and care has been put into making it! I am someone who likes to walk around. The trees in the hotel garden are a bit small. It was hot when I went there, so there was basically no shelter and I was exposed to the sun!

The bathroom is small, the roll paper is not a new one, and there is only half a box of toilet paper. When checking out, a front desk clerk wearing a red shirt couldn't tell whether the deposit was Alipay, WeChat, or a cash refund. I was really speechless. In the end, it was the deputy front desk manager who solved the refund issue for me. It's a little regretful to stay at the Hilton this time.

Maybe because the rooms were not cleaned in time, the waiting time for check-in was a little longer. Lucky, the front office depar**ent, specially upgraded the room for us, which was very considerate and greeted us every morning.
I stayed here once last year, and this year I found that the hotel has added a lot of children's entertainment facilities and turned it into a family hotel.
The breakfast buffet lasted until 11 o'clock, and there were always many people dining. It felt like all the hotel management staff were trying their best to help. There was a small detail that touched me particularly. I got 2 drinks and a hot rice ball. Just when it was too hot to take off, a young lady in a suit came forward and asked me where I should sit, and helped me. I put it on the dining table.
This is my second stay, and I still think the service is really good. My parents also praise it very much. I look forward to my next stay!

The service was excellent
Buffet dinner (two adults and one child): oysters, red willow mutton skewers, cooked pickled prawns, mussels and conches, very delicious. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, one hairy crab is limited to one person, sea salt ice cream, great value for money.
Breakfast: It has everything you need, there are a lot of people, but the food is replenished very quickly, and the chef Hua Zhi is handsome and good at his craftsmanship!
There is a fee for the small animal park. There is a package price for two children, one large and one small. Bringing 6 pounds of carrots is not enough for the small animals! The kids had so much fun

msg:As a double-platinum member of Marriott InterContinental for many years, staying at this Hilton is really disappointing. 2 points are given to the room and the front desk, and the rest can almost be regarded as negative points.
Let‚Äôs talk about catering first, which is also the biggest flaw this time: the dinner set included in the set meal has 1 appetizer, 3 main dishes and 1 dessert, but Ctrip did not specify the specific dishes. The sister at the front desk took the initiative to help me make an appoin**ent, so I went to try it. Unexpectedly, the so-called appetizer was a pot of Caesar salad (full of vegetable leaves) and pre-dinner bread. The bread was wrapped in advance and placed in the restaurant. No heating, the waiter said: Yes, but the bread will be dry, maybe it should be heated in a microwave oven... I learned that the main food is only pasta, fish and chips and sausage platter (you can see the picture, the sausage is what you will see in the breakfast buffet), Then I want to order some dishes, the waiter said again: 40 customers will come to use this set meal today, the kitchen is very busy, you have to wait for at least 45 minutes, hinting that we don't want to order... I am speechless here, I want A portion of ketchup took up French fries, and I came after I was almost finished. The breakfast buffet on the second day was quite satisfactory, and no one took a seat. I found a seat by myself and asked the waiter to clean up the plates left by the previous wave of guests. After taking a bite of cold-cut black pepper beef slices, I found that the meat was sour, and immediately responded to the chef. After trying it, the chef said that the meat tasted like this. After a while, he took his mobile phone and came over to show us the ingredients. There was sour in it Taste, I didn‚Äôt apologize for the whole process, and I didn‚Äôt ask the room number... Whether it‚Äôs sour or the meat is sour, we can always tell the difference... I‚Äôm too lazy to entangle with the hotel, the overall food and beverage is poor, whether it‚Äôs production or service, everyone You can see the picture.
Facilities: Children's Paradise only has ocean balls, and there are no staff. Go-karts are in a small room, and it costs more than 100 yuan in 10 minutes. The pool water for paddle boarding is brought in from the stinky ditch outside. The hotel has not done anything to deal with it. In summer, the smell is smoky when passing by, and the inside is full of aquatic plants. To add, the paddle board costs 300 yuan per time. It is not recommended to buy paddles included plate set meal. The four-person bicycles parked in the hotel cost 75 yuan for half an hour, and the minimum rental is 1 hour. After asking about the spa, the staff said indifferently that the essential oil costs 1,000 yuan for 60 minutes, and the Chinese massage costs 480 yuan for 30 minutes. The price is okay, but really unnecessary at this hotel.
Overall, I will not stay at this Hilton again. I suggest that the hotel catering team can go to Ningbo Dongqian Lake Hilton to learn, or simply change the brand

1. The environment of the hotel is very beautiful, the lobby is spacious and bright, and there are robot services. We booked a double room and upgraded to a landscape double room for free
2. The room also includes afternoon tea. It is quite pleasant to have afternoon tea in the leisurely afternoon
3. The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool and an indoor swimming pool, children like it very much
shortcoming:
1. The room is not very big. What I don‚Äôt understand is that when designing the bathroom, the designer designed the toilet room like a closet, and the door handle is really hard to use
2 The service area is actually very good from the front desk to the restaurant, but the room area, first of all, the room attendants don't know how to clean, the telephone and telephone line are all dusty, and the shower gel in the bathroom is gone, and they don't add it, the children I took off my clothes and got ready to take a shower. The shower gel was gone, and I called the service center, and it took a long time to deliver it, and it was all in a simplified version. I told her about the problem, and she went back to get it. The experience was very bad~
3. The toilet paper by the sink has not been added or added. I don‚Äôt know how the room supervisor checks the room again. Didn‚Äôt these details be checked? If there are no children‚Äôs products in the room, the waiter will only send them when you call. And it takes more than half an hour to deliver
4. There are too few breakfast varieties, but the taste is okay
In short, as a brand hotel of the Hilton Group, it is necessary to reflect the value of a five-star hotel, and we hope to improve it in terms of service and catering!

I met Julian in the lobby during the meal and was very enthusiastic to help guide the restaurant. I would like to praise it here. The dishes in the Chinese restaurant taste very good, the price is a bit expensive, but acceptable. After dinner, we visited a small farm in the hotel, which is by the lake, and there are many vegetables grown in it. The children's playground is also good, and I will choose this store next time I have a chance.

Breakfast: We went early, before 8 o'clock, there were not many people, there was no queue, and there was a long queue when we came out. There are quite a lot of breakfast varieties, basically all of them are available.

Facilities: Why doesn't the new hotel have a washlet?

Service: The service staff are very enthusiastic. When you see a baby, you will take the initiative to ask if you need any help. Also send baby stickers.
The barbecue in the buffet dinner is not hot, mainly lobster, but the lobster is cold. It would be nice to have more variety for dinner.
There are too many people in the swimming pool, the water is a bit cold, the water in the small pool is hot, and it is full of people. Overall it's pretty good, next time it doesn't rain, come and visit the cute pet paradise.

msg:First of all, the front desk service is in place and warm, the room service responds in a timely manner, the guest room is clean, and the room is clean and odor-free. Breakfast dishes are also good.

Need to make a grand complaint about their garden:
If you want to play with children, it is not ideal until the garden and swimming pool are repaired.

The greenery of the entire hotel is particularly decadent and depressed, and the lake is dirty and covered with aquatic plants. I don't even want to walk close to the lake, because there are so many mosquitoes. The outdoor pool was never open and was full of rubbish, dirty water and bugs*. The outdoor children's paddling pool also looks abandoned. The outdoor swing is covered in cobwebs. The vegetation by the lake and the swimming pool is overgrown with ****s. It feels like it hasn't been pulled out for a long time, and there is not a single decent flower. The water in the indoor swimming pool is very cold, and the air conditioner is fully turned on. The air conditioner in the locker room is extremely cold, you can't find a dry towel, if you forget to get a towel at the check-in desk at the gym entrance or the one you got before is already wet, then play ball, because there is no attendant in the locker room! There are also no dryers in the changing rooms to dry swimsuits. The rooms on the first floor are almost deserted, and ****s grow tall in the yard.

Compared with the outside, the interior is bright and tidy as a whole. But you can still see a lot of savings, for example, there is no buffet dinner on Friday night! There are quite a few middle-aged and elderly people among the waiters, and there are actually two old aunts with big bellies sitting in the position of lifeguards in the swimming pool! Can they really save lives?

The room is very beautiful, but the designer's brain hole is a bit big...

1) The design of the room door is not in line with people's usage habits... The door is very close to the wall when you open it, and you feel like you have entered a closet with your face against the wall. 2) The toilet is in a small room like a closet. The door handle is difficult to use. When you get up to go to the toilet in the middle of the night, you have to look for the door for a long time under the night light environment, and you can't get the handle. 3) The shower switch in the bathroom, you find that the switch that can turn on the water is actually the smallest one. If there is a little soap foam on your hands, it will slip... 4) You know what you think about the design of the water cup. At first glance, you think it has coffee Stains... 5) The quality of bedding is actually not bad, but I feel that they are still using winter quilts in the guest rooms, and thick mats are also laid under the quilts. Helpless, the air conditioner turned itself into heating in the middle of the night... After being woken up by the heat in the middle of the night, I found that the panel was dead, and it couldn't be adjusted to cooling, so I had to restart it. In short, the air conditioner is turned down, the wind is blowing on the head and the head is cold, the air conditioner is turned up, and the quilt is covered with heat. 6) There is no socket on the entire wall where the TV is hung... 7) Friendly reminder, the cabinet in the middle of the twin bed room is nailed to the wall. If a family of three travels, it is impossible to put the twin beds together.

Let's talk about the hotel again, 1‚É£Ô∏èThe location is a bit remote, and it feels quieter in the quiet, which is very popular for my whole family. I don‚Äôt usually like to go to hotels like Evergrande or HaichangüòÇ
2‚É£Ô∏èThe internal facilities of the hotel are complete, and the swimming pool is very fun! Sand pit, zoo, bicycles, children's playground, water sports, etc. Although they are not very luxurious, they are enough for children to spend a weekend or have fun during the festival.
3‚É£Ô∏èThe quality of the executive lounge is very good, the food is not too much but it has everything! I really appreciate the fact that the cups for iced drinks are also stored in the refrigerator! By the way, the mouth suite is really big!
4‚É£Ô∏è Breakfast is okay, although it is not as good as Alila's taste, but it has everything you need.
5‚É£Ô∏èGo to Qingxi nearby, it is better to take pictures than Zhujiajiao! A one-foot garden can also be a card~
‚ùåIf you have to say something wrong, the management of the swimming pool is a bit unprofessional. It is not good to go in without changing your shoes, and the staff inside will not stop it if they see it. Also, there are few toiletries, and there are no cotton swabs üò≠üò≠
This time I was too rushed and didn't eat the Chinese restaurant. I was a little disappointed. Next time I have to invite my friends to come and stay for a few more days! !

There are water bikes and paddle boards in the yard. It‚Äôs a pity that I didn‚Äôt bring shorts, so I went to the small zoo.

msg:I temporarily decided to take my children to Fengxian for two days on weekends. The day before the departure, Lucy contacted me and asked about the accommodation needs. After arriving at the store, I found that I had been upgraded to a lake view room. The room is clean, and the environment of the whole park is good. For dinner, I chose a buffet dinner at the hotel, with Southeast Asian flavors and barbecue, and I enjoyed it very much. During the whole process, Lucy communicated with me on WeChat and asked about my needs, which made people feel very warm. When the weather is hot, you can go to play for two more days.

msg:This time, I saw the 999 package and took my baby to experience it. From the garage to the front desk, the service staff I met were very enthusiastic. The room was big and the crib was good, but the balcony was too dirty, and the desktop floor The handrails are all dusty, it looks like it hasn‚Äôt been cleaned, and the door of the room can‚Äôt be opened and fixed, the fixer is crooked and misaligned, the door is very heavy, it‚Äôs inconvenient for a person to push a stroller in and out, and the wood around the bed The floor creaks very loudly, and children are easy to wake up when they are light sleepers. The sound insulation effect is poor. People in the surrounding room can hear the children crying and calling clearly. The worst thing is the greenery below after 6 o'clock the next morning There are workers who are cutting trees, and the sound of the motor is loud. The cutting is done before 7 o'clock, so it will not be done after 8 o'clock. I think this is something that the hotel lacks. If it is the hotel's own workers, it is unreasonable Arranged well, if it is a municipal engineering worker, it is incapable of communicating in advance. Normally, the municipal workers should not complain at six o'clock in the morning, and the citizens will complain, so why the hotel did not respond. Let‚Äôs talk about food and beverages. Generally speaking, it‚Äôs a mess. The Japanese food restaurant I went to on the first night felt like it was a joke. There was no one at the front desk, so I went in by myself. We ordered a la carte, so let‚Äôs not talk about the high price. Five stars The price of a first-class hotel is normal, but 40 minutes after ordering, the first order is the French fries, then the fried chicken nuggets and salad, then the staple food, skewers, and the last one is tuna or Salmon tarta forgot, the appetizer was put on the last dish, and the little butterfly who poured the soy sauce did not pour it from the beginning to the end. I feel that this restaurant is outsourced. There is a female Shanghainese in it. She is not wearing a uniform and is very enthusiastic. It's a bit like a proprietress. The service attitude of the waiters is very good, but they are unprofessional. At breakfast the next morning, the front desk didn't stand there. He was talking to the people next to him, so he asked us for the room number. My husband was blind The answer went in too, no one took a seat, I went in and looked for it, I wanted to dig a fruit puree for my son, but I didn‚Äôt expect that there was not even a small iron spoon, there were a few waiters, especially a fat woman, Shanghainese should, The enthusiasm is really enthusiastic, and they also help to serve tea and water to the guests, but it just feels chaotic. This should be a problem with the hotel's system. The environment of the whole hotel is good. It should be more fun when the swimming pool is open in summer. The waiters are very enthusiastic, including a male waiter with a Northeast accent in the play area. He saw us pushing the cart down the stairs and wanted to help us. It would be good to change the rules and regulations. Generally speaking, this hotel is suitable for bringing children who can get up early, because the baby does not care about the sound insulation effect. Anyway, they get up early and can make a lot of noise.

There are several restaurants, including Chinese and Japanese, and the Chinese food is better; 3. The room size is just right, the basic room type is also good, and the bedding is so-so , slept very uncomfortable, needs improvement! ! ! 4. The surrounding environment is good, you can go for a walk and pass half a day; 5. There are many facilities for children‚Äôs evenings, and the package includes it, so it‚Äôs very expensive to buy it alone; 6. There is a small animal exhibition, which is very small. It‚Äôs not interesting to ask for tickets, you can see everything at a glance. The most annoying thing is that there is a chicken in it, which starts crowing from 12 o‚Äôclock in the morning and keeps crowing until 6 o‚Äôclock in the morning. I really want to stew it! !

When I arrived after 2:00 pm, I checked in directly. The package included breakfast, afternoon tea, a small pet park ticket, and a mini bar in the room.
The hotel is a resort hotel, it should be good in summer, with an outdoor swimming pool
The room facing the artificial lake is a large room
The hotel environment is good and afternoon tea is also ok
Breakfast is okay. There are glutinous rice balls during the Lantern Festival. There are few people.
There are not too many service staff, but they are all friendly. The indoor swimming pool only has one bath towel, and the changing room is not very big.
Not far from Qingxi Old Street, you can go shopping everywhere
Pet Paradise is a bit of a pitfall. Fortunately, the set meal costs 98 for a single ticket, plus 20 for carrots with flavored food. There are relatively few animals and the environment is so-so.

Food, housing, travel, and service have always been the comprehensive considerations for staying in a hotel.
      My parents were very happy this time, because we met Operation Director Wang Qi when we checked in. It was a very considerate check-in experience. The whole process recommended karaoke and restaurants according to our family's situation. For the elderly and children who haven't sung for 3 years, it really brought them happiness.
I can really meet Wang Qi anywhere, haha, I feel like I can confirm where he is, and all the dishes recommended by her are classics. For the elderly who have food requirements, every dish this time is very good Can't stop talking.
At the same time, we also want to praise our head chef. It was the first time I met the head chef at the front desk of a hotel. He said that because of the busy Chinese New Year, he had to help. Fortunately, the head chef personally took him to the Japanese restaurant and helped introduce him. In fact, the sukiyaki set meal I bought was delivered with low expectations. I didn‚Äôt expect that after eating it, I really felt the quality of Hilton. It‚Äôs great, the ingredients are fresh, and the taste is very good! Very considerate restaurant waiter, it can be said that Hilton has done a good job in training!
The humanities of the hotel are also very good. There is a place to take family portraits and lion dances in the lobby. It has a festive a**osphere and feels like going home. Will stay again next time!

msg:I am very happy that my husband and I spent a happy 9th wedding anniversary at Fengxian Hilton.
The package bought on Ctrip, the room is great, with a small terrace. When I checked in, the lady at the front desk helped me change to a double room. Outside the window is the artificial lake view, refreshing.
The set afternoon tea is very good, the taste is light, the dim sum can be sweet or salty, and the tea is also very fragrant. It's the time of the World Cup, and the afternoon tea restaurant also has a big screen to show the game, which is a good place to relax.
The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. Dinner is not included in the package, but the restaurant selection is quite comprehensive. The hotel has Chinese food, Japanese food and seafood small hot pot barbecue buffet. You can also order western food to be eaten in the guest room.
The newly opened hotel has done a good job in sanitation.
Surprisingly, the service is also in place. Every staff member greets guests with a smile. When I checked in, I forgot my ID card at the front desk, and the staff immediately called the room to tell me and sent it to my room. The swimming pool closes at 10 o'clock in the evening, and the guests are notified to leave at 9:50. I'm a girl, and it took me a while to shower and dry my hair. The staff didn't rush me, but instead let me take my time. When checking out, the beauty at the front desk even took pictures for us.
This stay was very pleasant from arrival to departure. I feel that Hilton Hotel is worthy of being a five-star hotel of an old brand, and it is very good in all aspects. It feels that the hotel wants to build an outdoor peach garden-style resort-style hotel. We plan to bring the children to play together in summer.
I didn't experience the pet park and outdoor activities this time. I look forward to coming back next time and experiencing all the activities again.

Western food is very cost-effective! thumbs up. The hotel pool water is very cold! After playing, I came to take a shower and turned on the faucet for a long time! No hot water coming out!

The check-in was also very considerate and warmly introduced me to the relevant information of the hotel. The next day's breakfast tasted great too, with a lot of variety.

msg:The environment inside and outside the hotel is good. Front desk service is warm and kind. The room is larger and has a balcony. The facilities are relatively new and comfortable to use. I experienced the indoor swimming pool and gymnasium in the store. The opening hours are abundant, the equipment is first-class, and I feel happy. The breakfast food is rich and of high quality.
Suggestions: 1. When eating breakfast, I feel that the service staff is too enthusiastic and a bit uncomfortable. For example, when getting coffee, someone can ask what coffee do you want? I think one of the characteristics of the buffet is that the guests are casual, and the staff should observe the behavior of the guests without actively interfering. Only when the guest has a problem and asks for help, the staff will give help as soon as possible. 2. When guests are dining at the dining table, they hope that the service staff will not stand too close, and should keep a certain distance. 3. In order to protect water resources, it is not necessary to frequently replace the pots/bowls without the knowledge of the guests, except when the guests offer to change the pots/bowls, or ask for opinions in due course.
Just personal thoughts for reference only. In short, the overall impression is deep. It is a good place for family and friends to relax and vacation. Maybe I will go again next time!

The key toilet has a separate sink, so you don't have to go to the bathroom to wash your hands-this is great. There are also a lot of chefs helping to make things in the stalls, and the guests will not be kept waiting for a long time-this is also appreciated; the environment is good, with a lot of greenery, and I saw people doing green maintenance, unlike some hotels with a lot of greenery and no one to take care of-this I also like it; it's my husband's birthday, the room is well-decorated, and the elder sister of the room service took the trouble to bring us things for the children-this is also very good! Here's what I want to complain about: The room is centrally air-conditioned, and it's very hot at 25 degrees. There is an air-conditioning control panel but it can't be adjusted. After asking, I found out that it's the central air-conditioning... The child was too hot to take a bath, so I asked me to bring him water to drink After taking a shower, I went to the balcony to blow air to slow down; the mineral water delivered to the room was ice dew, and the shampoo, shower gel and toothpaste were all brands I had never heard of, and I felt that it did not match the Hilton brand; there is no nucleic acid test near the hotel. I have to drive out to look for it... nothing else, overall the accommodation experience is good, I will come again next time~

Stayed in a lake view room and the view was great. The hotel's fitness equipment is probably the most complete of any hotel I have ever stayed in. It also has a yoga room with a great view, which is a real gym. Hilton's catering is unparalleled. From breakfast, afternoon tea to dinner, each one is unique and delicious. During afternoon tea, I met the chef preparing Chris**as food promotion and chatted for a while. I could feel that the hotel was working hard. This time I checked in in the middle of the week, there were few guests, and I felt good. I will stay here next time.

Arrived at 1 o'clock, completed checkin in 45 minutes, went to the western restaurant downstairs for a light meal, it took two hours for the 6 sets, and the two ice cream balls had to be urged four times before they were served. When I came back to the lobby at 3 o'clock, I saw that it was full of people. After inquiring, I found out that the room was not cleaned, and they were waiting for the key... The staff explained that there were not enough staff, and kept apologizing. a key in a room. The Chinese restaurant is reserved for the second batch at 19:30. There was no phone call until 8 o'clock, so I went upstairs to the restaurant and said that there was a place. When I ordered, many dishes were said to be gone. Fortunately, the dishes I ordered tasted pretty good. All the CDs should be the only highlight of this vacation. To tell the truth, this summer, I checked in four hotels without leaving Shanghai this summer, and this experience was at the bottom!

1. The waiter at the entrance of the breakfast restaurant was a little out of shape, with no eyesight, no smile, and a slow look!
2. In the evening, the phone customer service delivered the quilt and water. After waiting for a long time, the quilt and water did not come. Later, I called and said that it had been delivered. In fact, it did not. I don‚Äôt know if it was delivered by mistake or forgot!
3. The hotel is in the green belt of the swimming pool. There is a lot of smelly water coming up, and no one handles it in time. It also has some toilet paper. It is hard not to think of what kind of sewage it is... The key point is that such a big pool of stinky water is still being discharged continuously, and there is no staff to deal with it. It is very dangerous for children to ride bicycles and run here. I hope to improve as soon as possible to be worthy of the Hilton brand.

msg:Hardware facilities are better than jw Marriott, and the room is larger. But the software is lacking. The mineral water in the room is ice dew, one of the cheapest mineral waters. The paper towels are also cheap and easy to scratch. The toiletries are also ordinary brands. These details are different from the positioning of the hotel itself. In addition, in the middle of the night, the water tank was broken, and the water turned yellow. I couldn't take a shower until after 12:00. This is the first time I have encountered it, and it needs to be improved.

msg:New hotel, the room is spacious, the facilities are relatively new, the lake view room has a great view, and the lights are turned on at night, it is very beautiful! The food in the Chinese restaurant is well done, I ate two meals, and there were no dishes that stepped on the thunder. I booked a room with a lake view. I remarked that the children took online classes. I hope to enter the room at two o'clock. The front desk said that a room on a high floor has been arranged, and the view is quite good! In fact, it is the room facing the outer road. He also mentioned many times that he was very busy and his attitude was rather blunt! At my insistence, after waiting for more than an hour, I checked into the lake view room at 2:30! The room is given a mini bar for the first night, but the contents in it have not been delivered until check-out. All the spare parts need to be called by themselves. The attitude is good and they can be delivered in time. There are not many things for breakfast, three stalls, no problem to eat enough. The outdoor swimming pool is not open. I heard that it will open in August. The cost performance of an outdoor swimming pool may be higher! It feels economical five-star üòä especially the front desk, you need to improve your quality, don't tell the guests that you are busy, please hurry up, it's rude!

In order to make up for the length of check-in, we gave welcome fruits and upgraded the room for free. Newly renovated with good facilities. The pools also have children's, standard and hot tubs. There are also water sports outside, along with bicycles, table tennis, etc. The hotel's Chinese restaurant is also very good, crispy chicken, yellow croaker, crab dumplings are all recommended.

When checking in, a lady at the front desk did not check in for your family for 20 minutes. I asked her later, but she didn't respond at all. Fortunately, there was a trainee named Flora, who had a good attitude and greeted him positively. He quickly completed the procedures and introduced the path to the guest room in detail. The contrast is obvious
The water pipe in the bathroom in the room is leaking, and it drips all over the place when you use it? Others are fine.

The small wan service at the front desk is good, and the room has been upgraded. The cleaning of the room is a little dead, and the stall is a little stained.
The breakfast is ok, passable, not amazing.
The mini bar is said to be free. When you open it, there are only two small bottles of drinks. Oh, just one word, stingy
The braised pork in the Chinese restaurant is very delicious, but it is too fat. It is recommended to choose half fat and half lean ingredients next time.
In short, the environment is beautiful and the hygiene is acceptable. The service and equipment can be more a**ospheric.

msg:It's the peak season of seaside play every year. I searched for high-end hotels relatively close to Bijinsha on Ctrip. The overall environment of the hotel is good, the parking is convenient, and the layout is reasonable. The price should be relatively reasonable at present, but because the outdoor swimming pool is not open. (Not due to the epidemic), some areas of the garden view are closed, which reduces the experience of staying (if the above two are open, will the price increase to 3,000 yuan for an ordinary standard room?). Secondly, I feel that the service needs to be improved. For example: 1. I found that there were mosquitoes in the room at night, so I called the front desk and asked for an electric mosquito coil. I made three calls before and after 22:10 to 23:20, but the result was not waited. Finally, at 23:30 Pick up at the hotel lobby by yourself. 2. There are several restaurants in the hotel, but there is a phenomenon of waiting in line during breakfast. The emergency plan is not in place, not to mention the queuing during the epidemic prevention period did not operate according to the epidemic prevention requirements. In view of the current epidemic period, the return rate of the hotel may not be in place, which will affect the service quality and efficiency. The other two problems will not be described anymore. I hope the hotel will strengthen training and improve service quality!

msg:The worst hotel in Shanghai I have visited in three years
1. After check-in, the room fee has been paid in advance, and a deposit of 1,000 is required. Does the hotel still require a deposit? stunned.
2. The toilet in the room does not have electric heating, and it freezes to death when sitting on it; the bathtub leaks, and children can‚Äôt take a bath; the shower room has two upper and lower showers, if you don‚Äôt want to wash your hair, use the small shower to take a bath, and the big shower drips cold water on one side.
3. The water temperature in the swimming pool is low, and the air conditioner is not willing to turn on. It is no problem. Who wants to freeze to death at 15 degrees? The hair dryer in the dressing room is every good, not broken.
4. The dinner is the hotel's sukiyaki set meal, which was reserved in advance when we checked in. The restaurant is not big, and the total is about half-baked. In addition, foie gras sushi and fried chicken were added. I was told that I would have to wait for half an hour. I said no Question, and then it took 40 minutes to bring out the sukiyaki pot, which was full of raw cabbage, enoki mushroom and beef, and it was placed for half an hour. The most exciting thing was that the waiter came out and saw that there was no cassette stove on our table, and directly bought it from the next table It was a mess, the table was full of leftovers, and the cassette stove was taken out and placed on our table. I couldn't believe my eyes. At this moment, none of the other dishes I ordered appeared. I asked the waiter, and the waiter said , haven't you been on it? üòì
5. There is a very small "Happy Farm" to feed small animals. I can understand that the food is sold to me. It costs 98 yuan to enter. I really don't understand what the operation of this hotel thinks. You would rather the room rate be expensive 100, don't play like this, the experience is really bad.
6. When I checked out, it was said that the deposit would be refunded the same day, but it was not there. I called the hotel and added the waiter's WeChat account, and then I was refunded. The reason is that there are too many people. The funny thing is that I have never been in a queue for eating, checking in, and checking out. What misunderstanding do you have about the crowds? What are you doing?
There are too many other things like dirty water in the garden, and it is called "Hilton". The brand is really ruined!

I thought I could ride to the nearby ecological park, but whoever knew it was closed. As a result, the car was finished in 5 minutes... 5) The hotel asked for an extra quilt, but the answer was no; the mini bar was free, but it turned out that there were 4 bottles of drinks in it; there was a capsule coffee machine, but no capsules. 6) Moved the sofa, it turned out... the ground was very dirty... 7) The waiter who stayed at the hotel didn't know the hotel facilities and asked if it was possible to share the bed and told me that I could... As a result, the bed was fixed and could not be joined together, so it was inconvenient to bring a baby to stay. . The only bright spot is that the key is good, and the breakfast is OK... a very disappointing trip.

I went to the hotel Chinese restaurant-Tang in the evening. The waiter who went to 7:30 told me that I could only choose a limited menu, and many dishes were gone. I ordered some and saw the price list. I have reposted it. To be honest, the taste is ok, but this amount can only be described in fine detail. The waiter said that the epidemic has affected it.

In the empty hotel, it was pitch-black all around. Suddenly we didn't know What to do at night, I was a little disappointed to find a big bag of swimsuits, swimming caps and glasses prepared at home. I contacted Ctrip and wanted to ask if this could be discounted, nearly 2,000 oceans. The little brother who handled it was very good. He went back and forth to understand the situation and apply. Although the money back was a little small, the little brother's efforts moved us. All the shortcomings of this trip were smoothed out by Xiao Wan and the unknown Ctrip brother.

The room arranged around 11 o‚Äôclock on the first day had a bad smell as soon as I entered the door, and then I asked to change the room. The reception staff promised to give me a room on the 4th floor, but I had to wait until after 3 pm. When I picked up the room card on time, I was told that the room hadn‚Äôt been cleaned yet, and after waiting for 40 minutes, they said that there was no room on the 4th floor, and finally arranged to stay on the 3rd floor. Every time I asked for some supplies to be added the first time I couldn't get a response. I went out early the next morning and asked for the room to be cleaned. When I returned to the hotel around 12:00 noon, the room card was cancelled, and I waited in a long line to re-refresh. After returning to the room, I contacted the room staff to clean it and waited for more than an hour. Why does the room need to be refreshed after checking in for 2 days in one day? Hotel takeaways are not allowed to be delivered to the lobby and customers are required to go to the gate to pick up the goods. This is the first time I have encountered it under the normalization of the epidemic situation. I feel that this five-star hotel is completely unworthy of this title. The location of the hotel is relatively remote without any facilities, and the price of activities inside the hotel is high

I ordered a Chinese restaurant at 8 o'clock, arrived at the restaurant at 7:30 and wanted to order in advance, but the table was empty and no one took it. After ordering at 7:45, I started to stand and wait until I was seated at 8:20
The front desk promised to deliver afternoon tea after checking in. I asked the front desk to deliver it to the room the next day. I was told that there was no such thing. The welcome fruit said it would be delivered to the room. I didn‚Äôt see it until I checked out.
Can not send, do not promise
But you can't promise not to do it! This is basic credibility!

In the days when we can't leave Shanghai, Baoneng Hilton's facilities and supporting facilities can give us a vacation-like experience. A spacious room of 55 square meters with a large balcony; an indoor heated swimming pool, and a Chinese restaurant comparable to Michelin quality. It is a good place to relax. Thanks to coco at the front desk for leaving a very good memory for our stay this time. I am looking forward to the hotel's open-air swimming pool and the pool room on the first floor when the spring flowers bloom, a hotel that can really get close to nature. Every employee is very nice, dedicated and gives five-star praise

I drove to check in on Saturday, the old and the young were holding luggage, and the door staff saw that there was no help throughout the whole process, and there was no luggage cart at the door. After entering the lobby, other service staff came to greet you. The registration attitude at the front desk is good. For the breakfast location and time, the hotel facilities are not introduced or informed throughout the whole process. I ate at the Chinese restaurant on the 5th floor in the evening, and many dishes were out of stock. After waiting for the dishes for an hour, there were still 2 dishes that did not go to the kitchen, and later returned. The child accidentally spilled the juice, the service staff didn't come when they called, and some of the food service staff didn't hear it. Finally, a plump male manager in a suit cleaned it up for us. The breakfast on the second day was good, with a wide variety of varieties. The service staff who could not be seen at night, the breakfast staff was well arranged. In short, the hotel service needs to be greatly improved, otherwise there will be no repeat customers.
