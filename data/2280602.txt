msg:Great value for money, super clean, comforable bed, beautiful river view from hotel room.  Need to specific mention this hotel have very amazing, friendly and helpful staffs. (We left a wifi egg with charger behind and they gave it to us immediately when we check out!!)  Walking distance to eateries and river cruise at the pier.
Stay for 2 nights in this hotel, just a bit disappointed coz can't go to the rooftop bar due to events on both nights. Also need to mention elderly need to be very careful when using the shower room of the hotel coz their floor are made of marble. It can be a bit slippery. Other than that, I highly recommend this hotel and will come back next time.
We had a wonderful time here, thank you very much.

Hygiene: Hygiene is very clean. At least there is no dust in the places that have been touched.
Environment: Close to the river, but the room on the second floor can hardly see the river. It is very close to Guangzhou Restaurant and not far from Beijing Road. It is very convenient. The overall environment of the hotel is okay, but it is too small.
Service: Not bad, but the waiting time for a room during the Spring Festival was too long. I arrived at 1:30 and said I came out at 3:00, but actually the room didn’t come out until 3:30.

msg:This time I stayed in the middle floor (4th floor) of the elegant room type. I had made a reservation in advance to choose a quieter floor (bar street on the 1st floor, hotel lounge on the 7th floor), so there was no noise from my wife. However, the curtains cannot completely block the light, as "a ray of sunlight" leaks out because the position near the wall fails to stick to the wall.

The bathtub does not have a window as shown in the picture, so you cannot soak while enjoying the view, but it does have a small terrace (you need to sign a disclaimer with the hotel to unlock the door)
In addition, the rooms are generally clean, but there are many moldy areas in the shower area: the bathtub and the place where the shampoo is placed.

The location is by the river. If the weather is cool, you can choose to walk for about 20 minutes to Beijing Road, Gaodi Street, Gaodi West Shoe Street, Tianhe City, etc. There are many surprise shops along the way.

The hotel staff are very polite and patient. Although it seems that the front desk staff are relatively new, so the guests can also be patient and wait. It does not mean that the emperor will make things difficult for the staff by paying. Thanks for your hard work!

I advise you not to come if you can. This hotel probably has too high a profit on drinks and you don’t want to make money from the rooms. Don’t stay there!

As soon as the water in the bathtub in the room was filled, several hairs floated up, and the shower head in the bathtub was also damaged. The most exaggerated thing is that there is still unused toothpaste from the previous guest in the cup used for brushing teeth! The hotel staff's response was also very problematic. When I called to ask for an extra bottle of water in the room at night, no one answered the phone. After checking out to pick up the stored luggage, our staff directly put our backpacks on the ground. This is very unacceptable for a service industry! Generally speaking, it is a good hardware with a good service. I really don’t recommend it.

Even so, Lingnan No. 5 still spares no effort to show "Lingnan culture", whether it is the ink scroll while waiting for the elevator, Or you may be hurriedly walking past the old photos accidentally discovered by the wall, and stop and realize that these are the changes in the world in Guangzhou.

Room view:
You can barely see the Pearl River from the fourth floor, and the open-air bar on the rooftop has a great view, but I don't like the band's songs very much, and *****ni's product is too watery to compliment.

Room facilities:
Clean, down-to-earth, quiet

Serve:
The guy who checked in was very nice. Not only did he check in quickly, but he also talked about the layout and features of the hotel, which was really great.

breakfast:
The only flaw here is that there is no guidance when entering the restaurant, the food is served slowly, there are no tablecloths and paper towels, and the taste is not outstanding, it is really a bad experience.

They said it was undecided, but the facilities and other facilities were all equipped as a five-star hotel. When I say there is a bathtub, it means that a hotel with a bathtub is a five-star hotel. I'm afraid that the manager has some misunderstanding about five-star hotels. When I got off the bus and walked to the hotel entrance, I was really confused. It looked exactly like an express hotel, but the service was really good. Very welcoming and responsive to all requests. There are resident singers in the lobby at night, which is very nice. The breakfast is good. It is a la carte. It is in the old city, not far from Beijing Road. It takes about 20 minutes to walk. Across the road downstairs is the Pearl River and there is a pier. , walking at night is not bad.

msg:There are several big pits, please be careful to avoid them

Facilities: This is the first time I have seen a coffee machine in a hotel room. Does it come with coffee capsules? It turns out that the coffee machine is just a decoration?

Environment: The location is similar to Shanghai Shikumen Bar, which is a good place.

Hygiene: The worst part is that there is a problem with the drainage design of the entire building. The odor in the sewer is extremely serious. The most important thing is that the room does not have an active ventilation system. It is ridiculous.


Service: Service is the only praiseworthy aspect. But there is also a big pitfall. I have seen this hotel through Hyatt APP for several years, but it has never been available. Instead, Ctrip has booked rooms wherever I want. My room nights and points were all fed to the dog.

To sum up, I originally thought that SLH was Li Dingshi's replacement, but now it seems that it is not even considered a low-end match. Disappointed😮💨

You can also take a bath in the room. The pier for the Pearl River Night Tour is nearby, and the 41-year-old Wynn Hotel is also there It is nearby, within walking distance, and the sound insulation effect is very good when the windows are closed at night.

The environment in the store is elegant and comfortable, the food is delicious, and I really like the almond tea served in the evening.
Before checking in, I was a little worried when previous travelers mentioned the noisy bar at night, but later I found out that I was overly worried and there was no problem at all.
The room furnishings are very Chinese Lingnan style.
It is recommended to pay attention to the water in the shower room.

The bar is also very strong and interesting. When I came to Guangzhou, I chose Lingnan No. 5 instead of other luxury brands for the sake of privacy and exclusivity. The service exceeded expectations, and I will choose again next time. It's a pity that the location is not very, very close to the subway station, you need to walk for a while, the rest is perfect, suitable for guests who want to experience the unique old Guangzhou style.

When I went downstairs at night and asked if there was a charging cable, the uncle security guard answered him. He was very enthusiastic and felt good. The fly in the oin**ent is that the room door is really not very soundproof, and the outside can be heard clearly. The overall experience is still very fresh

The rooms are very clean and equipped with JING tea bags, 4 flavors, and Nescafe capsule coffee. The new high-end toiletries are from the British aromatherapy brand - Miller. Hayley Poems. The Yuejiang Bar on the top floor has a great night view of the Pearl River, a live band, and friendly staff. I will definitely come back next time!

msg:I couldn’t leave the province during the National Day, so I made a reservation on Ctrip on the morning of October 1st and found that not only did Hotel No. 5 in Diling, Guangzhou not have a price increase, but the hotel package, which included Cantonese-style breakfast for two and dinner for two at 488 yuan, was a very good deal. I decided to give it a try with my mother-in-law.
🚗 Transportation: Self-driving is convenient.
🧹Hygiene: Above average level, it would be better if it could be improved to a higher level.
🍃Environment: Located in old Guangzhou, the place is a bit small and has no swimming pool, but the layout is exquisite and the rooms are reasonably utilized. In Guangzhou urban area, it is not bad to have rooms with an area of ​​more than 30 square meters.
🔔Service: first-class, with the feeling of VIP service.
The restaurant's food is exquisite and tastes good. It's like eating in Guangzhou. People who live in Shunde, the world's gourmet capital, think it's very good.
The breakfast menu seems to have a little variety, but a little bit of each food is enough to satisfy you😃.
The beef balls and cheese toast are delicious. Breakfast on October 2nd was a Saturday, so I regretted not trying the all-you-can-eat brunch for 188 yuan.
