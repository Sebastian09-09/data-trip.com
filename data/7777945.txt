It's suitable for lazy parents to travel with their families.

The hotel has its own free parent-child park, both indoor and outdoor, which is great. The children don’t want to come out and say they will come to play in the future.
The service in the breakfast room in the morning is very good. There are waiters standing at the door in the morning with a smile, which feels very comfortable and warm.
There are not many breakfast items, and the quality is still good. My parents are very satisfied with this stay and will come again next time if they have the chance.

From Shanghai, an hour's drive will take you to Chongming Island, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. A few kilometers after getting off the elevated road, you will arrive at the hotel in the east of Chongming.
Environmental introduction: Chongming Youyou Sheraton is surrounded by villa areas or hotels, and the road conditions are very good and new. There are not many cars coming and going, which is very suitable for cycling. I saw many guests staying in the hotel brought bicycles, and parents and children rode together on the bicycle path under the shade of trees, passing by the flowers and trees on both sides of the road. It would be very comfortable to ride.
Facilities and services: The feature of this Sheraton should be the main parent-child, with a children's amusement park, and the rooms are decorated. Many grandparents and grandchildren stay together. Terran's service is very good and pre-arranged. Like

The service was very thoughtful, the team was very considerate and enthusiastic, and the response was very timely, which is difficult for other hotels to do. Thank you for your hard work~

msg:A family of three went to Chongming for a weekend trip. When Regina knew that we brought a child with us, she took the initiative to upgrade our deluxe king room to a parent-child room. The child opened the door and saw the tent, Lego and rocking horse, and smiled instantly. To be honest, this room saved us as parents a lot of effort, and the child could completely put down the tablet and play for a long time. I sincerely thank Regina for her enthusiasm and thoughtful service! In addition, the hotel's breakfast can only be said to be satisfactory. The only drawback is that the water temperature of the hotel's large swimming pool is too cold. The child shivered when he went into the water. I hope the water in the large swimming pool can be as good as the small swimming pool, which will be more perfect.

The bathroom has a whole mirror, and the overall lighting is also very good. Basic makeup is OK. The electric toilet and bathtub are both good~
The swimming pool is open from 9:00 to 21:00 today. I went there at around 7:30 in the afternoon. There were about ten people, mostly concentrated in the children's area. There were quite a few people bringing their children to play. The main swimming area was not crowded, and there was also a steam room~
The breakfast was OK. It was located on the first floor, and the dining environment was good. If it was a sunny day, there were two rows of people who could bask in the sun. What was more amazing was that the bread and desserts tasted good. The rest was just average~
If you order takeout, you have to go downstairs to get it yourself. This hotel does not provide takeout delivery to the room~ If you are lazy, it is more convenient to live on the first floor... When checking out, the staff with glasses guided me to the garage and sent my luggage. It was still a very satisfying experience. Full marks💯

Parent-child room, Vivian arranged it very considerately. The child likes the layout of the room very much, and the wooden horse and the piggy bench are his favorites.
The hotel also has an indoor playground, which closes at 8 pm, and it is still not enough.
A very good hotel, I will choose it next time I go to Dongtan.

The bathroom is clean and comfortable with dry and wet separation. The children's park has indoor and outdoor areas, especially the outdoor area is very spacious. The children had a lot of fun. I played with them for a while, basking in the sun and breathing the unique fresh air on the island.
What satisfied me most was my service ambassador, Vivian, the housekeeper. She gave meticulous care from the whole process from welcoming check-in to check-out. Since there were a few people in the family and two big and small babies, there were also a lot of luggage. She helped to let the courtesy soldiers deliver it to the room in advance. There was not enough water for milk powder, so she asked the guest room to prepare a little more water. When I went to have breakfast, I also met Vivian's caring greetings. I have stayed in so many hotels. Such service really made me feel at home. My eldest child said that the sister was very nice~ I want to come and play next time, and then because I drove to the next tourist place later, she also helped to delay the check-out~ Such service is worth promoting and learning. The experience is very good! 🥳

Vivian checked us in early so that the children could have a nice nap. The room is very large. Although there is no toy table for young children in the room we stayed in, it did not affect our play. The children in the hotel's children's playground and swimming pool said they liked it very much. The front desk guy Bread was also very enthusiastic when I consulted about the places to play nearby. I will come again next time in a good season.

msg:I feel that everything is average. In terms of service, I called to add slippers and toothbrush after checking in, but they didn't come after waiting for 40 minutes. After going out for dinner for two hours, they still didn't arrive. In terms of food, the hotel buffet is the worst I have ever encountered in various five-star hotels. There are only about 5 or 6 hot food stalls, and the dishes have never changed from beginning to end. It is okay to use a self-service hot pot to make up the number, but the food stalls are also pitifully small. There are about two or three kinds of meat, and about 6 or 7 kinds of vegetables and soy products. In terms of quality, the swimming crab meat is very hollow and rotten, and it feels like it has been frozen for a long time. Such a buffet costs more than 300 yuan, and it costs more than 200 yuan after the discount. Finally, I have to complain about the design of the room. The facilities are old, and the shower is still old-fashioned and the water flow mode cannot be adjusted. However, the large floor-to-ceiling window in the room faces the swimming pool on the 3rd floor and the main restaurant on the 1st floor. The designer used large floor-to-ceiling windows, which can see each other clearly. The room can only be closed with curtains and sunshades and lights on, otherwise there is no privacy. I don’t know which designer’s masterpiece is this. However, Chongming is a good place. I will definitely come back. Next time, I will change to the hotel next door.

1. There was a long queue when I arrived at 9:45 on April 5, but I found many tables empty through the glass
2. There are not many types of food, but look at the poor salad dressing in the picture, a whole head of lettuce is really hard to start with; there is also a rice ball that is closed directly, and the milk marked as hot is cold (not even room temperature)
3. After breakfast, I came out to pick up my luggage, maybe because the rental bicycle business was too busy, I didn’t know who to find for a while; I saw two hotel service managers in suits and short skirts standing next to me chatting...

My intuitive feeling for the above three points is that the staff is not enough to deal with the holiday. To put it bluntly, there are not enough people to work, and the management staff is not down-to-earth

For lunch, you can go to Hu's local restaurant, which is reasonably priced and tastes good. You can also go to Chenjia Town, which is a ten-minute drive away.
The hotel has food, drink and entertainment, and it will not be boring to bring your baby to stay here for a day. I booked a parent-child room, and my son was super happy and had a lot of fun. There is also a small playground, and there are a lot of children on holidays.
Two tickets to the Yingdong Ecological Village next door were given, but it closed at 5 o'clock. If you want to go early, you can walk around inside, which is good for strolling the baby.

The call for disinfection was perfunctory; the air conditioner was very noisy, and there was a loud mechanical noise outside at around 6 o'clock in the morning; the most unacceptable thing was that a person in the breakfast room who kept coughing and sneezing actually went into the kitchen to wash his hands. I personally think that this has violated the hygiene regulations, which made it really feel indescribable to bring children to stay in this hotel; but the hotel's swimming pool is good, and there is a children's pool with a water temperature that is very child-friendly.

The main reason why we had such a great stay this time was because the staff provided very good service. When we checked in at the front desk, Vivien offered to upgrade our room for free, which was a big surprise. The manager of the restaurant was also very proactive and enthusiastic.
Room:
I heard that the hotel has been built for 7 years, but both the lobby and the internal facilities in the rooms look very new, clean and tidy. Babies like the parent-child theme room, and it is worry-free for adults.
Amusement facilities:
This time I experienced both the indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds and the children's swimming pool. Although they are not big, they are free. Our 2-year-old baby had enough fun, and overall he was very satisfied!

Special thanks to Miss Vivian at the front desk for taking the trouble to help us arrange connecting rooms, extra beds, replacement of hard boards and other services, making our stay very comfortable for both the elderly and children.
Next time I take my family to celebrate the New Year, I will consider Sheraton. 👍

msg:I booked a one-night package on Saturday with a hot spring. I thought it would be near the hotel, but I didn't expect it when I arrived. The front desk of the hotel said that it would take 1 hour to drive by car. This package is really useless. The location of the hotel is quite remote and there are no shops around. If you want, If you order takeout, you have to call for service an hour in advance. There is almost no service in terms of experience. I have never seen a waiter in the children's paradise. Moreover, the water in the bathroom in the room is very slow. My feet were soaked in dirty water during the entire bathing process. There is no hotel. Children's toiletries and toothbrushes are also used for adults. The outdoor children's playground is closed. The swimming pool there is also closed. The buffet on Saturday night is also closed because there are few people staying. The breakfast has very few types and is not delicious.

Every time I go to a restaurant, they ask me if I need a baby chair and tableware. They even give me a cake when it’s my birthday. Three days go by in a blink of an eye. Will recommend to other friends.

Actually, I was only staying for two nights and I didn’t have much expectations for the hotel. I didn’t expect that when I first arrived at the hotel to check in, I encountered a warm and friendly reception from the front desk guy. The front desk was generally just polite. However, this little guy was really polite to us and made us feel at home. Since there were no other travelers checking in at night, the check-in guy warmly introduced us to the layout and facilities of the hotel and thoughtfully guided us to the elevators and dining areas. The place and the places where we can walk around the hotel were introduced. The front desk made us very satisfied and felt that it was rare to suddenly feel twice as good about the Sheraton Hotel. We asked the name of the front desk guy. The guy kept evading and refused to say that his son had photographed his work. The hotel guy named Liu Wenjian must be praised. If we come to Chongming in the future, we will still choose this hotel because of this service. In addition, the hotel's hardware facilities are also good, which makes us feel that it is worth it.

After all, it is a high-end hotel with a rich breakfast, a swimming pool, a gym, and a children's playground.
Special thanks to hotel front desk employee Bread for his service. Bread, who has a poetic temperament, was very professional and helped our family check in. When he saw the child, he immediately upgraded us to a parent-child room for free. He also told us that the hotel is near Chongming Island. Visiting places, details~~ professionally and accurately tell us nearby places to watch the sunset professionally...
After arriving in the room, I saw tents, Lego blocks, and various plush dolls. The children were overflowing with surprise... The swimming pool was also very clean, and there was also an ocean ball in the children's playground... all of which made the family very happy! All in all, a great experience!

msg:I brought my parents and son to stay in the summer vacation. My parents lived in a twin room. My son and I chose a parent-child room. Both the old and the young were very satisfied, especially when we checked in at the front desk, the staff helped to upgrade both rooms Classified and arranged on the same floor.
The hardware facilities that a five-star hotel should have are basically available, such as Chinese and Western restaurants, swimming pools (with a shallow children's pool), gyms, children's playgrounds, and bicycle rentals for two people. There is also a bubble pool project at 4 pm during the summer vacation. The package booked includes a 20-minute experience. It is not bad. My son likes it very much and has a great time playing.
The cleaning staff are very playful. My son's comforting toy bear was put on the bed before going out. The cleaning staff put it in the bed when they made the bed. When I returned to the room, my son found it and thought it was very interesting.
That is, the breakfast buffet provided by the Chinese restaurant is quite satisfactory, with fewer choices. For example, people who are used to Western-style breakfast will find that there is no cheese. I hope the hotel can consider adding it. But there are also good things, because your own industry includes agricultural products, a bottle of tomato juice will be given every night, as a compliment, although I think it is very sour, but children like to drink it😂.
The supporting entertainment for the surrounding fun is the Dongtan Wetland, and there is still a long way to Dongping Forest Park, for your reference.

msg:I felt like I was staying in a fake five-star hotel.
I went there for the word "Sheraton", but I didn't expect to be so disappointed. We drove there by ourselves, and things that were very common in other five-star hotels turned into luxury in this Sheraton. First, when we arrived at the hotel entrance, no one helped us open the door or carry our luggage. Then, while queuing up to check in, there was a front desk clerk named "Qiu Ju" who looked disgusted and contemptuous because I said "Qiu Ju is going to file a lawsuit". Did I offend her? After completing the formalities, no service staff led us to the elevator. Instead, we were asked to ask people everywhere to find the elevator. Entering the room, it is indeed very spacious, but I really don’t know what to say about the details: the cup for brushing my teeth has not been washed at all, and it smelled sour that I boiled a pot of water and scalded it carefully. The layer of dust on the bedside table was obviously not wiped clean. The buffet in the morning was simple enough, but the coffee always had a smell of wormwood, whether it was because of the coffee beans or the milk. All in all, the experience was terrible. This is one of the worst five star hotels I have ever stayed in. It's such a shame that the reputation of the Sheraton Hotel has been ruined.

Service: I arrived in the afternoon, just a step behind the bus, and I was ready to queue up. The hotel was very considerate and provided a reception desk for individual travelers to check in. I checked in smoothly, which was great ~
The young lady said that there is a cow-view room where children can see cows, but it is a bit far from the elevator. It turns out that what she said is true~haha😆There are so many cows🐮.

Facilities: Three types of slides in the indoor playground 🛝9am-20pm, the outdoor area closes at 5 o'clock, which is too early to play when there is no sun and it is comfortable. I played a little in the afternoon the next day and it was very sunny, so I did not consider opening it in summer. Is it a little later? After breakfast in the morning, there was no place to play after 7 o'clock. I just walked around the hotel and there was no place to relax.

Environment: The hotel 🈶️ held a wedding reception in the evening, and the guests brought their own fireworks to set off, which was really nice.

Hygiene: good👌🏻

The dinner and breakfast included in the package are not bad. Although the breakfast is a little richer, the dinner is more delicious😋

Opinions and suggestions: The baby fell asleep and I applied for an extension in the morning, but I still made two calls to inquire, and the second one woke the baby up. 😥 I just... felt that the internal coordination 🈶️🉑️ could improve the 🈳️ time.

Overall it's okay.

msg:I have been to Chongming many times, and I stayed in the Sheraton and Hyatt hotels alternately, and I am basically satisfied.
This time I stayed at the Sheraton, but I was a bit tossed and disappointed. In the first room, I found that the bath towels were hairy and dirty. I asked for another room. As a result, the bath towels in the second room still had hair, and more than one (as in the photo), hygienic It's a bit worrying. Objectively speaking, it is understandable that the high occupancy rate during the peak summer vacation leads to queuing for dining, and the lack of food replenishment in time. However, hygiene should not become sloppy because of the high occupancy rate. I hope the hotel management can pay attention to this issue.

msg:The room is very big, much bigger than ordinary urban hotels, because there are many green plants in Chongming, so it can be regarded as a garden view room.
The bed is too soft, the air conditioner is slightly insufficient, and the quilt is a bit thick. It would be much better if I told the front desk the next day to change to a thinner quilt.
The price-performance ratio is not high for eating. It has neither special features nor delicious food, and the price is too expensive. It is recommended to learn from the nearby Jinmao and set up a farmhouse yourself. After all, there is nothing delicious in a six-kilometer radius.
The swimming pool is very good, the water quality is okay, not much bleach is added, but the sanitation and service can be further improved.
There are a lot of people who come on Saturday, and you have to eat breakfast early on Sunday, otherwise you may have to queue up. There are quite a lot of varieties of breakfast buffet, and the taste is not bad. After all, it costs nearly 200 yuan per adult.
I would like to give a suggestion. Since it is called a parent-child hotel, it is a bit incomprehensible that children over the age of six are charged half price for meals. To be honest, how much children under the age of eleven and twelve can eat.
In general, the service experience is satisfactory, but you have to drive yourself to eat at the farmhouse.

msg:I booked a hotel on a temporary basis, but it was surprisingly good. After arriving at the store, vivian received us very warmly. Seeing that we have brought a child, we upgraded the parent-child room, and the child exclaimed directly, "Wow, so beautiful!" Indeed, there are dolls and building blocks that attract children in the room, clamoring to hug and sleep. The little slippers are also cute little yellow ducks. It takes less than half an hour to drive from the hotel to Wanghong Dingba Point. When I went back at 7:30 in the evening, I was worried that the restaurant would be closed, so I contacted vivian to arrange dinner. She was very thoughtful and satisfied. The next day, the child ate very well for breakfast, and asked his father to bring him a bag of grains before leaving. The bubble war that the child was thinking about was late because he got up late for a nap, so he didn't get to play, leaving regrets, and he can come again in the future. However, if you go to the island, you still need to take good measures against insects. The person who attracts mosquitoes was bitten by three big bags. Overall, it is still very pleasant, not far from the city, and I will come again next time.

All aspects of the hotel are relatively suitable for parent-child travel. The area that may need improvement is the low water temperature in the children's swimming pool. The children caught a cold the same night after swimming, and the maximum temperature in the room can only be adjusted to 26 degrees. If you bring your baby in summer Remember to bring long-sleeved clothes when you come to live

Vivian helped us upgrade the parent-child room. The children liked it very much. They played in the room for a long time. They will choose to stay in Chongming next time. The only thing that can be improved is that the water temperature of the large swimming pool is still cold. If children just play in the water and do not exercise a lot, they will still catch a cold easily. Fortunately, there is a children's swimming pool next to it. The water temperature is more suitable.

The mattress was extremely comfortable. Swimming pool is up to standard, key people are not many. Hyatt's pool is like a water park.

2 5 🌟, I have been living in Jinmao before, but this time I chose Youyou Sheraton~ It is a very wise choice~
The little brother at the front desk, seeing us with our baby, immediately upgraded us to a parent-child room and gave us a cake🎂～
The interior of the house is very cozy, especially the Lego table. The child played on it for an hour, and he was so happy that he placed an order online that night and bought the same model.
The cake is neither sweet nor greasy, and tastes great~
Playing in the hotel's children's playground in the morning ~ the child was crazy ~ I didn't take a nap until 12 o'clock, and I didn't wake up until the check-out time at 2 o'clock. I couldn't bear to wake up the child, so I extended it for free for another hour ~
The service of the hotel this time exceeded my imagination~ I feel that it is much better than Jinmao's service~ Next time you come to Chongming, look for Sheraton~

Although the traffic jams on the road are overwhelming, after staying in the hotel, I feel like I am at home. I have never treated the guests at all because of the large number of people on holidays. Negligence, special thanks to Vivian, the front desk, for her meticulous attention to detail. When we checked in, we saw that we brought our baby and took the initiative to help us upgrade the parent-child room. They also provided free ice cream, which captured the hearts of my snacks.
Overall, Youyou is quite suitable for parent-child vacations. There is a children's playground on the 2nd floor, both indoors and outdoors. Although the space is not large, it will be crowded if there are many people, but the infrastructure is enough for young babies to have fun~ The third floor is the swimming pool and gym. The swimming pool is divided into diving and deep water areas. The temperature of the pool is a bit low, and the changing rooms and washrooms are quite clean (it is recommended that there will be fewer tourists in the morning)
The breakfast is self-service, and you have to queue up during the peak meal (around 8 or 9 o'clock). It is confusing when there are many people on holidays, but it is understandable.
This time we also tried the Nianfeng Chinese restaurant in the hotel. It is small and expensive but the taste is not bad, the seasonal vegetables are well cooked, the service is polite and attentive, and it is well received.
The hotel also provides bicycle rental and cycling route recommendations, and you can enjoy yourself physically and mentally by cycling around.

Finally, there are a few small suggestions on the hardware,
1 The hair dryer in the room is a bit old
2 The air conditioner in the room is a bit unstable, and it is still a bit stuffy after being turned on all night.

Service: Except for the stinky face of the waiter at the swimming pool (not quite in line with the appearance of a five-star hotel), everything else is okay. but! ! Why is there only a towel between the outdoor children's playground and the indoor (see the last picture), I took the baby in to play, but I don't know which parent removed the towel, and then the door was locked. Can't open, can't go back. Finally, I called the front desk, and it took a long time for someone to open the door. The first sentence of the visitor, don't take down the towel. Let’s not say that we didn’t remove the towel at all, just say that a five-star hotel uses a towel to separate the door, is it appropriate? Shouldn't it be an apology for keeping us out in the cold for so long? I was very satisfied with this hotel and the whole trip, but this is a disappoin**ent. So two stars are given for the service, three points are deducted, one is deducted for the pool attendant, one is deducted for the towel at the outdoor door, and one is deducted for the staff who came to open the door.

The overall service of this hotel is still very good. Xiaoqiu at the front desk thoughtfully contacted us in advance and arranged a garden view room with a small garden for us. The location is relatively quiet and private, the room is clean and tidy, and the bathroom is not small. However, the air-conditioned room is really quite dry in winter, so consider providing a humidifier. The overall facilities of the hotel are also good, and the lobby is decorated with many old-fashioned decorations to add interest. The water temperature of the constant temperature swimming pool is also very gratifying in winter. There is a small swimming pool with a depth of 0.6m next to which small pots of friends are playing in. However, the dehydrator was not found in the changing room. Fortunately, the waiter gave the plastic bag in time. The warmth of Xiaoqiu for breakfast reminds us to eat at staggered peaks. The variety of breakfast can be more varied. There are local special Chongming cakes. Dinner is also settled in the hotel. The fancy buffet dinner has a small hot pot. Overall, I am satisfied with this stay.

December is the Chris**as season🎄, and the warm Chris**as a**osphere can be seen everywhere in the lobby. Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, 22 years of the epidemic have passed.
Chongming establishment code checks are very strict, and hotel restaurants are even more strictly checked.
The hotel rooms are average and nothing special, and the hotel breakfast is not rich. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is really too formal. The dishes do not have any Chongming characteristics. The white-cut mutton ordered at noon was served directly from the refrigerator, which did not match the five-star price at all. A particularly good facility is the swimming pool. The water temperature is suitable and it is a standard pool. There are not many people when I go there. It is highly recommended.
The young man at the front desk of the hotel, Hu Tiancheng, is very enthusiastic and can give satisfactory answers to all questions. I like the farm dishes he recommends very much. His service greatly adds points to this hotel.

The restaurant environment is also good, the buffet dinner in the package, hot pot, small seafood, hairy crab, small yellow croaker, salmon, red wine, rice wine, beer, champagne

The room that arrived at 2 o'clock in the afternoon can already be checked in.

Before leaving the store, I thoughtfully asked if I needed a late check-out. In fact, the service of the hotel is the hard power. My parents are very satisfied with this hotel.
Although the breakfast in the hotel is not the most variety, it basically has everything that should be there. Because it is a weekday trip, there are not many guests dining.
You can see the sunrise directly from the window, and there are many, many free-range cattle
There are no supermarkets or restaurants near the hotel. Three kilometers away is the spur dam, where you can watch the sunset and sunrise. There are many farmhouses around 15 minutes by car.
The overall stay experience is very good, I will choose to stay at Sheraton next time

The wooden *****s used in the guardrail are not safely wrapped, and the plywood is exposed, which is easy to scratch the skin. Nothing else is fun.
Hygiene: The pool table in the parent-child room is very dirty, with water marks. The carpet in the aisle outside the door also looks dirty. I don't know if it's a pattern problem or a lot of dirt. The air in the room is not very good, the windows are big, but the windows that can be opened are very small. The large floor-to-ceiling windows are in the south, and the sun is very hot. There is only a wide, narrow and high bed in the super west. Mosquitoes enter quickly and the ventilation is ineffective. The surface of the fresh air is full of soil, and the inside is definitely more dirty. Don't think too much, otherwise you won't be able to live. I checked in on October 14th. It was 25.6 degrees that day. The south-facing room was exposed to the sun for a day. The ventilation efficiency of opening the window was also very low. As soon as it got dark, the hotel turned off the cooling of all rooms, and the room was hot and sweaty. , can't sleep.
Service: The Chinese restaurant is super unpalatable, and the fried pork in the picture has a fishy smell.

msg:I placed the order three weeks in advance, and I couldn't take my baby out of Shanghai during the summer vacation, so I decided to bring my baby to Chongming Island for a vacation. The more popular parent-child twin room is set, and the price for one night on Sunday is 1037 yuan (including breakfast). Probably because I haven't stayed in a hotel for a long time, I'm really a little excited.

Although the hotel is a bit far from Chongming attractions, it is really close to the expressway and the road is easier to drive. There is an underground garage, so you don't have to worry about parking. The floor of the entire hotel is not high, but the facilities are relatively complete, including an indoor swimming pool and a children's playground. Because of time constraints, only take the baby to check in the swimming pool, and the sanitation is still good.

The parent-child room has two beds of the same size, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and there is a bathtub. The sound insulation effect is very good, so you can sleep well at night. I went downstairs to eat at 7:30 in the morning, and I didn’t need to queue, but after I finished eating, I had to queue to enter the venue. The variety of breakfast is quite rich, there is no problem with eating enough.

The villa itself and the internal environment are very good, the occupancy rate is very high during the holidays, and the air conditioning is very powerful in summer, but it is a pity that there is no floor heating in winter, after all, floor heating is still very important in winter~
We stayed for two nights in total. On the first night, we had dinner at the Hyatt Regency. On the second day, I wanted to make a meal in the Chinese restaurant of the hotel a little more convenient. The accommodation specifications of this hotel meet the five-star standard, but the food and beverages are only three-star standard. Since the simple breakfast and dinner have been opened, it should be done well. It is inconvenient to eat too many people without round tables in the audience (the receptionist said that we are just a breakfast restaurant. ) So now that a set menu is set up, you should do it well or arrange it at the Chinese restaurant of the Sheraton Hotel?
The elderly in the family do not like to eat barbecue. If they really want to eat, it is recommended that several families prepare some ingredients for hot pot in the room. It is also a very happy thing!

The hotel also has bicycles that can be rented to ride in the nearby bicycle lanes with fresh air. The environment of the hotel is also very good, there are many green plants. There is a small garden in the atrium. Will play again next time.

msg:There is an underground parking lot, very humid, free parking, there is an elevator in the parking lot to the hotel lobby, check-in and check-out are fast, no deposit is required, there is no difference between the deluxe room and the distinguished room, but the difference between the floors , The highest hotel is on the sixth floor. The biggest disadvantage is that there is no balcony in the room. Although it is a non-smoking hotel, the room will still smell of smoke, especially on the pillows. The hotel's gym and swimming pool are currently closed. Breakfast ends at 10:30 in the morning, and it takes about 7 minutes to queue, mainly because there are too few waiters to clear the table. The service attitude of the staff is very good, and the waiters are all young. It's just that the details of the hotel room decoration and layout are not in place, there are only two bottles of drinking water, and the toiletries are quite ordinary. After all, it is a parent-child family hotel, and the ability of children to spoil is quite high everywhere. ! A 5 star hotel is a bit reluctant.

msg:Let's talk about the service first:
1. At check-in, when the room card was handed over to me, I had no idea that my check-in was complete. Because I don't know the room number, I don't know where the breakfast is, and I don't know where to go to the room. The room number was told to me by the front desk at my initiative.
2. But where the breakfast is used and where the room is going is told by the lobby staff, and the guy in the lobby also eagerly reminded that it is best to come for breakfast at what time, otherwise you will have to queue up, and the next day the fact is as he said. Plus, the smile that was missing at the front desk was also gained here.
Let's talk about the environment:
1. I booked a suite, so the room should be big, but the big one doesn't feel warm at all, the air conditioner is a little loud, and the mattress is very soft.
2. The indoor swimming pool is quite large, and there is also a pool specially designed for children to play in the water.
Finally, about the food:
1. The buffet on Saturday night is more recommended. Although the variety is not too many, there are common dishes at this price, and the quality should be considered good. The small yellow croaker is really delicious. I ate 4 of them.
2. The breakfast variety is also very rich, both Chinese and Western, but I don't understand one thing, there is no butter, and the reason is that it cannot be delivered due to the influence of YP, I am curious what butter is it?
In the end, it was a bit disappointing to stay at 3k for such a night.

After entering the room, I found that there was no room in the room. After cleaning, Doris, the staff member, came to our room for the first time to check, and immediately changed the room. At that time, I thought it would be fine to clean up, but I didn’t expect to upgrade the room for the first time. I'm moved ~ Sheraton's service has a five-star quality~ It's just that there were a lot of people in those two days, and the breakfast service needed to queue up. I hope it can be improved in the future and make reasonable arrangements.

Transportation: There is no other way except self-driving. There is no ground parking space, only the ba*****t can park. The parking space is still enough.


Hygiene: fairly clean, the facilities are relatively new, the TV is relatively small, there is no trash can beside the toilet, there is a bathtub without bath salts

Environment: The air is good, there are no shops around, only farmland, only vending machines can buy some food, the children's playground is not big, the facilities are outdated, the children are not interested in playing for a while, the swimming pool and gym are not open, the hotel can play too few items,


Service: Antigen and epidemic prevention is required for check-in. I gave a box of small tomatoes to taste. Other basic services are not available. No drinking water is replenished. There is a long queue for check-out billing. no figure


Breakfast: The variety is not very rich, there are no small wonton omelets, and the western pastry is not delicious


Tucao point: The hotel's Chinese restaurant requires that only 2 or 3 people eat together at a table on the grounds of higher-level epidemic prevention and control requirements, and the family also needs to eat separately. I don't know what epidemic prevention effect this policy has, and there is service for eating. Fei, but I saw a bunch of waiters standing next to me, and the water wouldn't pour. The most amazing thing is that the buffet in the western restaurant next to it has no rules at all. You can sit together. There is no one who can have two policies in a hotel.

In addition to not being out of the market, I can't find any other bright spots. It's not worth its price at all.

Due to the epidemic, the current limit is implemented during the peak breakfast hours, and the seats are placed at intervals. When we were eating at a western restaurant at noon, the waiter saw that there were children at our table and brought us bread before meals.

We were able to go down at one year old, not bad, we could ride the next day, and the manager gave us a ride ticket. This is very fun, everyone can experience it.

Let's talk about the next restaurant. There is a Chinese restaurant and a western restaurant. The pasta in the western restaurant is delicious. I ate it for two days! ! Remember to register as a Marriott member for 10% off! The breakfast is ok, no fault, worthy of the price of the hotel. The noodle is not bad.

The smell of the hotel is very good and it is very relaxing when you come in. It has a similar taste with Banyan Tree. The children's paradise is suitable for small babies.

Thanks to the cleaning aunt, the clothes and plush toys are stacked so carefully. The farm food in Chenjia Town is good, but it is difficult to drive on Taihei Road. You can find Jinmao and Yingdong Village. It is recommended that hotel guests get discounts at Chinese restaurants, the original price and service fee are very expensive 🤣

I was upgraded to a suite after checking in on the 9th, and the other 8 rooms were also upgraded from deluxe to noble, which is really unexpected, thank you so much 😘 I chose the 2588 set meal from the Chinese restaurant for dinner, which is large and full of food, very good👍 waiter Attitude is also good! The hotel is close to the Dongtan wetland and the riverside, and the weather is good for walking.

msg:After the holiday, I stayed for three days in a staggered peak. The room is very large. The special feature is that there are two doors leading to the toilet and cloakroom. You can come and go. It's close. The room on the east side has a beautiful view and is not blocked. When the weather is good, you can watch the sunrise directly in the room, and you will feel a sense of happiness. The swimming pool, gym and restaurant are open and available. The breakfast varieties are divided into Chinese and Western, and the varieties are ok. I also gave some tomatoes from Youyou Farm, which tasted good, so I ordered some to send to relatives and friends.
The biggest disadvantage is that there is no food nearby. It takes 15 minutes to drive to Xinhonglou Restaurant, and it takes 6 kilometers to drive to the town to eat KFC. If you want to eat something delicious, you need to drive an hour to Chongming Wanda. And room hygiene needs to be strengthened, at least the glass needs to be cleaned.

Before check-in, we received a call from the customer service manager Vivian, who arranged the room for us very considerately, and also presented the children with fruits and cakes. During the two-night stay, she will also ask about our needs, which is really a heartwarming experience, thank you very much vivian. The hotel rooms are spacious and bright, with complete facilities, and we can get the help of the hotel in time for the items we need. In addition, the buffet has a wide variety of varieties, and the quality is also very good. It is a family hotel that is worth taking children to vacation 🏨

The swimming pool is very good, and there is also a separate small pool.
During the Spring Festival, the decoration is very festive, and the surrounding environment is very good. It is a little expensive to rent a bicycle to enjoy the scenery of the island.
The hotel breakfast is ok, children under 12 years old do not need to pay extra, which is more friendly.
Very satisfied with the Doris service at the front desk, specially upgraded the room, and there are many small surprises. Warm and thoughtful, introduced the surrounding attractions and dining conditions, and it is very convenient to travel.
Overall it is suitable for staying with children.

Seeing that we are old and young, he made a lot of meticulous arrangements. Thank him very much. The hotel not only has an adult swimming pool, but also a children's swimming pool. The water temperature will be slightly higher, and the children will have a lot of fun. There is also a children's playground, which will make the children rejoice.

msg:First of all, the hotel's air conditioner is very noisy, and the quilt waiter didn't give me a single set. No hotel staff would do this service. The lobby is also the smallest in a star hotel I have ever seen. Except that the name is a five-star hotel, and the room has a bathtub, the others are not as good as ordinary express hotels. I couldn't go out to Shanghai during the Spring Festival, and I thought about the five-star service of Sheraton Chongming. I didn't expect to spend 2,700 yuan a night for a five-star room, and the service hardware and facilities were very poor. The plastic boards on the ground of the Children's Paradise are peeled and tattered. There is such a hotel in the desolate area where there is no front or back of the village and no store. I thought it would be more spacious and luxurious than the urban area, and the service standards would be the same. As a result, there is no service, and the environment is very noisy. Spring Festival can no longer live in Sheraton. How can Marriott have such a member hotel? I was so disappointed. Breakfast is simple porridge, noodles, fried dough sticks, bacon, sausages and other pickles, but there are more people.

msg:I decided to go to Chongming on a temporary basis and chose Sheraton, which is relatively close to my relatives' house. The price during the Spring Festival is really good enough, two thousand and dozens, and the big bed room includes breakfast.
➡️The location of the hotel is easy to find, the transportation is convenient, and there is an underground garage, so there is no problem in driving. Going to Chongming should be by car, otherwise it will be inconvenient to go anywhere. Jin Mao is also on the same road, and the facade is not so conspicuous.
➡️For the room, the front desk said at the time of registration that it was a free upgrade and an extra yard. In fact, it was only after the fact that I realized that the basic king-size bed upstairs was gone, and only the room on the first floor was left. In winter, the outdoor yard has almost no utilization rate, and there is nothing. In addition, the ecological environment is so good that even in winter, ants are seen from time to time in the room. Luckily not in the hotel most of the time, so the irritability didn't fully explode.
➡️Breakfast, the selection is average, the type and quantity are average. And because the occupancy rate during the Spring Festival was too high, the hotel had to introduce a time-sharing breakfast... At the time of check-in, it explained to the guests two time periods, and also indicated that there would be a queue. It's just that when there are really many people and you have to queue up to get some food, it really doesn't feel good.
➡️The hotel has a small children's paradise, a small experience is better than nothing. However, children are always more naive than adults, and they are happy.

No photos were taken inside the hotel.
Figure 1 is the outer street, which is really "no shop in front of the village", except for the villa area on both sides of the road is the sales center.
Figure 2 is the morning running route, you can run along Lanhai Road, but you should still pay attention to the non-motorized vehicles.

🔔Service: When we arrived at the hotel for check-in, the lady at the front desk was very attentive and found a little problem with our order. I really want to thank the front desk Xiao Shen and the manager Xiao Qiu. They were very active in helping them and they were busy before they were busy.

🧹Hygiene: 🏠The room is clean and tidy, and the room service is also very thoughtful. It is important to mention that the small tomatoes delivered every day are delicious 😋
🎢The hotel's facilities are also very good. I saw a lot of children go swimming. There is also a very good children's playground on the 2nd floor. There is also a special children's toilet in the children's playground, which is very intimate!
🍃Environment: The environment inside and outside the hotel is great, and everywhere is clean. We borrowed the hotel's bicycle and rode around the outside of the hotel for a long time. There are water and trees and the air is fresh. It is really suitable to come out and relax~
💁🏻A very satisfying experience, I will choose Sheraton next time I come to Chongming‼ ️

Chose this hotel the day after. I was fortunate enough to meet Vivian when checking in. Quickly understand our needs, and arrange customer service to provide us with toiletries and ➕ bed services in a timely manner. Kindly serve small tomatoes and cakes. She has the attitude of the head of the big family, haha, if you have any needs, you can contact her on WeChat. Including the meal delivery service at night, because the agent was busy, she could only trouble her again, and soon the restaurant would reply and deliver the meal.
The hardware of the hotel is good, the food is also good, the breakfast is also rich, and the dinner is enjoyed in the Chinese restaurant. It is a little surprise that the crab is still plump in this season.
Because I left in a hurry, the children went to the swimming pool, but I didn't have time to experience the gym facilities. Come back next time, you will have to trouble Vivian, and she will really feel at home🈶️. great 🎈

We lived very happily and the children had a good time. The double bed we ordered didn’t feel very suitable. The children slept independently, the small hill at the front desk helped us to coordinate to the big bed, and the children's room layout was also very good, with a small tent and a big pink pig. The environment of the hotel is beautiful and quiet, and the air is very fresh. The facilities are well-equipped, there are swimming pools, and there are also swimming pools specially prepared for children, which is very user-friendly.

The environment is good, the air is fresh, and there are also forest parks and wetland parks. The Sheraton Hotel I stayed in happened to have breakfast and dinner packages, and I started it immediately. When I checked in, the front desk took care of it very well. The family took care of them carefully. The front office manager Xiaoqiu also paid special attention to us. The restaurant manager coco We also specially equipped our team with a better location to facilitate team building. The facilities in the room are very new and clean. The best thing is the swimming pool. There are two pools with glass roofs, good lighting and good view. It is not cold at all this winter, and there is a slightly warmer pool for children to play. Alice is also very kind and enthusiastic in the fitness center. This swimming pool feels especially designed for family hotels.

The hotel is surrounded by lush greenery, and the lobby is very grand. The little brother Allen who checked in for me is kind and skilled. After identifying the member information, he gave me the membership trea**ent I should have. Because it is a resort hotel, he also introduced me to the hotel facilities by the way. , Very conscientious.
From the entire Check In process to the completion of the check-in, the experience is still great. I feel that this Sheraton is a perfect parent-child/couple stayaction hotel around Shanghai.
Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, you can also breathe the fresh air of the sea, the green everywhere, and complete parent-child facilities. It is quite worth driving here to check in.

The hotel also has a swimming pool and a children's playground. It is a very good parent-child hotel, one of the best travel destinations around Shanghai.

1. Because of the traffic jam on the 11th, the application agreement deduction was cancelled. Ctrip customer service helped to apply to no avail. As a result, he just rushed over and didn't check in until 2 o'clock in the morning. The next day I wanted to say whether it was possible to postpone the check-out until 2 o’clock in the afternoon because of the late arrival of the previous day, and let people take a nap. As a result, there was a woman in the yellow foreman uniform at the front desk, and said with a cold face: No. There is no room for negotiation, and the attitude is so poor. I am very surprised that this is actually a Sheraton service?

The Chinese food in the store is also awful, and I should not choose Sheraton from now on.

Sure enough, when we arrived at the hotel, there were all Shanghainese with children, and the rooms were full.
Parent-child hotel, so swimming pool, doll pool, children's playground, etc. are all available.
The Hyatt diagonally opposite has done it three times. This hotel is relatively new to Hyatt.
The room size is not small, TOTO smart toilet.
The elevator also has a dedicated disinfection area.
The air conditioner is very hot at night, and it needs to be turned very low in order to sleep comfortably.

msg:If you can't get out of Shanghai, you can only play with Chongming in the urban area. The Sheraton is located in Dongtan, very close to Shanghai, and the bridge is empty on weekdays and the scenery is good. The parent-child room booked includes passports and small gift bags, tents, piggy, ducklings, etc., sent by the minibar, and I feel that it is good overall. Although the Marriott Gold Card didn't give us a room upgrade or enjoy any trea**ent, the kids still liked it. The next morning, the weather was fine and I went for a ride. I went to the river for a round trip. I could queue up for breakfast and it didn't take long. The taste was good. The leader can also recognize some guests and feel very attentive to others. Tips: Just like other hotels, the small dolls in the parent-child room will be given away, otherwise it will be a complete decoration. . . The children's playground is bigger than expected, and there are some outdoor ones, and the swimming pool is also good.

Our whole family likes it very much. Perhaps due to the high level of activity, the number of hotel occupants increased sharply, causing breakfast to be overloaded, and guests lined up in long queues. It was a bit unexpected, but understandable. Still five-star praise.

On the first day, I thought that the window of the room was closed, and the window was opened on the second day. After a day, I came back at night and found that it was still very hot. I called the front desk to solve it. Two waves of people came and said that there was no way. Finally, they said to send a fan. ice cubes. . Could this cool the room? The reason why there is no fan should be that other rooms have the same problem. Since it is a known problem, it must be solved from the root cause, or enough fans are available. The experience is really bad

msg:The first time I stayed at the Sheraton, I felt really ordinary...
I have been to Chongming many times, and I have stayed at Hyatt Regency Yiqingyuan several times. I had lunch at Sheraton before and wanted to try it out. During the Spring Festival, more than 2,000 rooms per night are definitely not low, but the actual The experience is far from worth it. If it weren't for the inability to go out to Shanghai, such a hotel would never be full.
Hygiene 5 points: It is because there is no mistake at all, it is clean and clean, and it seeks truth from facts.
Environment 3 points: The hotel's small environment has nothing to see and do. There is a small animal park opposite the Hyatt Regency. It relies solely on the local greening of Chongming, and the deserted villa area on the side is a bit desolate.
Service 3 points: because there are good and bad, so there is no worse. 1. During the check-in, the front desk of the hotel tried to trick me that all three rooms were on the 1st floor. It was an upgrade with a small balcony. The upstairs room with inconvenience for the elderly had to wait for cleaning, so I thought about this hotel. Is there no elevator to walk upstairs? I opened the reservation and saw that the room was clearly written on the 5th and 6th floors, but I was rejected. I said that it would be done soon after it was cleaned up. At that time, I was in a hurry to bring the elderly to check in. What's this smart for? Look at me being bullied? When I entered the room, I wanted to take a rest before going to dinner, but the child was also tired. It didn’t take long for the waiter outside to call for room service in every room. She heard her call to us from a distant room, and she pressed the button twice. When no one answered the doorbell, he opened the door to himself. Seeing that the room was dark, he asked if anyone was there? I said someone, I said can you come in by yourself without opening the door for you? She replied that I didn't press the do not disturb light... She didn't think about the dispute during the Chinese New Year, so she left without saying anything, and left nothing behind. In the evening, the child came back from swimming and asked if there was any fruit to eat, so he called the customer service to ask if it was possible to deliver it, but there was no response after three calls. I don't know about it... Is this the service level that Sheraton should have?
Facility 3 points: The overall facilities of the room are ok, but the sound insulation is too poor. The child next door is jumping and talking in the room after ten o'clock, and the sound of the door closing in the next room is loud. The room must go through the hotel lobby to the swimming pool. It's weird to have a bathrobe walking around.
Ps: Nianfeng Restaurant, the only Chinese restaurant in the hotel, is really expensive and unpalatable. Although there are many farmhouses to choose from, this does not seem to be the reason why Chinese restaurants in five-star hotels are unpalatable!
If it weren't for the pool, I would definitely give the hotel a 3 star rating!

msg:I checked in on Sunday and saw that breakfast started at 6:30. On Monday morning, it was almost empty plates at 7 am. There were no fried eggs. I was looking for the food and beverage supervisor. No one paid any attention. I called the lobby supervisor to eat, but I couldn’t get it back. Half an hour empty plate for breakfast. There is basically hair on the breakfast seat cushions, which should not meet the hygiene standards of this star-rated hotel. The non-slip mat at the fried egg was not leveled, and almost knocked. I told the restaurant staff and ignored it.
An extra bed in the room is possible, but there is a charge.
It is not a parent-child room, and the waiter will not provide children’s bathrobes and disposable children’s slippers.
The location of the hotel is not far from the highway, but it is still relatively partial. If you want to eat out, you have to drive more than 6 kilometers to have a farmhouse.
The hotel has an underground parking lot, but no one manages it. Recently, the hotel is engaged in group buying. Basically, there are few parking spaces after two in the afternoon.
Special attention should be paid to the entrance and exit of the hotel’s underground parking lot, which are not in the same place, so make no mistake. However, hotel employees will drive out of the entrance when they leave the garage, and hotel employees simply don’t recognize the eight characters "entrance of the hotel, no driving in". As a hotel guest, you must be slow to enter the parking lot. Be careful to avoid the illegally driving out of the hotel staff, otherwise the result will be a crash. I have already encountered it and almost hit the driving out of the hotel staff’s car. Reflecting the situation with the hotel, the hotel did not even apologize in person. At this point, guests staying in the hotel must be careful.
There is only one elevator for parking in the lobby of the hotel, which is very inconvenient. However, the underground garage does not take body temperature to come in by elevator.

msg:I finally saw the S logo of Sheraton. The first few times were Four Points. The hotel is located in green plants, it is very suitable for going out, the service staff was very kind and upgraded me to a deluxe room, which was brought to the small courtyard on the ground floor. The buffet is very rich, especially the fried yellow croaker is good, but it is slightly more expensive for 598 persons. This price is not even unreasonable for sashimi. Breakfast is too cheap: the price difference between breakfast and no breakfast is more than ten yuan. There is a long queue of 20 to 30 people for breakfast. In fact, it can be solved by adding a few tables in the lobby. The hotel does not have a separate lobby bar, which is also a problem. The lobby is too bright and feels very hot, so there should be sunshades on the top. The instant coffee served in the room is 2+1, and I drink black coffee. Although I gave 5 diamonds, it was still close to a 5 star hotel.

msg:The room of Sheraton Youyou is better than the soundproofing of Hyatt Regency Jinmao. Quiet is the most important thing during the high school entrance examination, so I chose Sheraton. It would be great if the room has windows that can be opened to breathe fresh air. The breakfast was quite satisfactory. I had breakfast for three consecutive days. The salad dressing was not served in the salad the day before. I asked for an omelette this morning and said there was no time for me to come back later. I was a little surprised that there was no pincers for pickled mustard. The Chinese and Western restaurants for dinner are okay, but the filet mignon kid said it was good. The Lipton tea bags and three-in-one instant coffee in the room as always, and the free drinking of ice dew mineral water in front of the club is very dumbfounding. In this respect, it is much simpler than Hyatt. This time the room faces east and I saw a gorgeous sunrise.

msg:This should be one of the worst Sheratons ever. There is no major problem with the hardware, free parking, and the rooms are okay, but unfortunately there is no balcony of Jinmao Hyatt (maybe the room I chose does not have). The gym and swimming pool are not bad, the indoor playground for children is not that big, and the outdoor playground is not as big as the Jinmao Hyatt. The hotel provides family bicycles, but the price is a bit touching.

There are many slots. First, the fragrance is really unpleasant, but later it was discovered that Jinmao Hyatt's did not smell very good either. Secondly, there was no smile at the front desk (not very busy), so I took a handful of dental appliances and handed it to me 😳. Isn't it all in a small bag? It turned out that most of the staff in the entire hotel are like this. There is no staff in the children's playground. The staff in the gym is watching the video on the phone the whole time, and the chef at breakfast looks impatient. In addition, the breakfast was also very ordinary, the bananas were all rotten, and the rotten bananas were gone the next day. The cup in the room actually broke a corner, and I felt that the whole cup would break at any time. MINIBAR doesn't have a coffee machine or a drink. The five-star hotel gave instant coffee and tea bags like Lipton to be drunk. Forgot to mention, it seems that most staff do not wear masks.

再來説説游泳池，泳池分成人泳池和寶寶游泳，寶寶泳池我想説真心推薦，對100釐米以下的寶寶超級友好，整個池子深度60釐米，寶寶可以站在裏面走來走去慢慢摸索，找感覺，且即使自己滑倒也能因為水淺很快站起來不讓自己溺水，所以很快寶寶就可以自己自如走動了，後續在學打腿的時候也不是很排斥，必須點贊
再説説早餐，其實5星級酒店的早餐都差不多，但是這家有崇明糕，比前一天外面吃到的口感更軟糯些，且奶香十足，應該是放了牛奶了吧，我們幾乎每個人都吃了3，4塊，寶寶也吃了2塊，
臨走退房，酒店前台還送了“由由生菜苗”，説是可以回家種着玩，哈哈哈，如果能種出大生菜，我一定再來給你們個好評。

大家來這裡是休閑一下，我們去的時候已經過了飯點，沒幾個客人，餐廳服務員那叫一個手忙腳亂。比客人還焦慮！
最可笑的是游泳館，説是早9點到晚9點，8：50就關燈清場。這還真是第一次碰到。
你們酒店是沒按時給員工發工資吧？！員工都表現的極為不耐煩。白瞎了那麼好的設施，白瞎了好景色！

房間裏的小帳篷墊子有尿，半夜發現味很大，後來告知酒店，酒店也理所當然的認為不是什麼問題。
週六晚上沒有自助餐，餐廳點菜因為大廚離職沒啥吃的。
整體的服務意識不強，不值這個價格。
點個外賣要走很遠去取，不如一些檔次更低的酒店還有機器人可以送到房間門口。

msg:島上連鎖酒店選擇很少，對比之後選擇了喜來登
小月齡親子出行
先説優點：首先酒店相對來説比較新，除了自己的遊樂設施外，附近有瀛東生態村，町文生態園，丁壩，東灘濕地等景點，兩天一夜完全不會無聊。*酒店推薦去町文生態園（拿着酒店給的名片便宜十塊），小月齡其實衹能玩餵動物，別的磨豆漿做板糕都不太行。小動物們都關在大的圍欄裏面，有雞鴨鵝兔子羊馬可以喂，大概在一小時左右。
丁壩可以去拍拍照，中華鱘夢園再往裡開就行，大概半小時。
酒店自己的遊樂設施（室內外）在工作日是非常空的，包括泳池桑拿健身房等，比較乾淨，小朋友玩的很自在。
缺點就是，這床實在是太軟太軟了。。。。。躺上去人都是陷進去的，翻身費勁，一覺起來腰痠背痛，對腰突患者來説更是煎熬。
房間還是比較悶的。前台説是可以幫忙開窗，但是早晚温差大還是算了。
出去之後過會會斷電，打算在房裡做輔食而人又出去了的提前做好準備，別問我怎麼知道的😂

總體來説體驗還是不錯的，下次還會選擇來，就是這個床期待改進

msg:我給的五分就是因為衞生跟服務人員的態度都是挺好的，定了個大床，但是入住的時候給了我一個雙床，酒店給我升級了親子房，跟我朋友換了，相對來説還是可以的，但是第一酒店因為淡季所有的空調製冷都沒有用，晚上很悶熱，衹有一個小小的側窗，完全透不了風，而且還有蚊子飛進來，晚上睡了一晚第二天就感覺渾身不舒服，頭疼，外面的温度比房間的温度要舒適的多，這是唯一的一個不滿的地方，其他還好。給個建議，不要因為淡季就為了節約成本將空調製冷關了，這樣會讓住客感覺很垃圾，而且酒店很偏僻，距離便利店有差不多十公里，太遠了，讓人感覺很不爽。

msg:1，空調中央控制，接近20度天沒開啟冷氣模式，衹能靠側面小氣窗通風緩解悶熱，但有意思的是晚上11點還在展會設施拆除施工，噪音很大，蚊子又飛進來，完全不給孩子休息，這小氣窗開也不好不開也不好，服了。
2，因為第一條狀況，為了不吵孩子睡覺但又要解決問題，半夜2點半特地跑到5樓電梯間打內線電話要電扇和蚊香，説在電梯間等送來，別去敲門影響孩子睡覺，好傢伙，直接去按門鈴把我繞過，回去後孩子精神了，大人沒法睡了第二天還開車。服了
3，以上情況連夜投訴，第一個電話説確實有不周到地方，同意給延遲退房和送兩個小蛋糕，可是有形成要回上海，蛋糕也吃好早飯就走沒吃，對此也是覺得酒店應變能力不佳。第二個電話説提供西餐廳免費午餐，還是算了説要走了，早飯也吃了，何必呢。其實第一天來吃過西餐廳，味道一般。中餐廳也第二天吃了晚飯，芋艿裏吃到了小石子還是沙子。不過餐廳的負責人都還應變比較及時。
4，酒店又説給該酒店升房券，我説應該是不會選擇這家了。
客觀情況就是這樣吧，大家客觀參考。

2、電視機點播是有問題的。衹有打電話給你們工程師才能解決。
3、家庭自行車是有問題的。兩個大人，一個十歲的孩子，無法乘坐你們的家庭三人自行車。騎起來非常困難。
4、瀛東村非常無趣，與其送票還不如不要送。
5.自助餐晚飯馬馬虎虎。因為不高興去外面找吃的了。啤酒衹有小棕瓶和百威，直到快 9 點才出現精釀。燒烤還行，羊排，墨魚，到牛排還是快接近 9 點才有。
總之，不太像一個萬豪五星級品牌的樣子。

攜程上訂的房間（週中入住）沒有像評論裏説的有升級親子房就算了，還被安排在走廊盡頭，離電梯廳非常遠。
前台在辦理入住的時候當客人面還對自己同事發了點小脾氣。
早上早餐可選範圍很小，週四早上相比周三還撤掉了一些檔口。

房間裝飾温馨可愛充滿童趣，孩子很喜歡，酒店中餐廳比較意外的好吃，本來不抱什麼期待，點了幾個簡單的炒菜，沒想到口味可圈可點，比農家菜更加精緻講究。

自助晚餐種類不多，戰斧質量不咋地，小龍蝦個頭能有小拇指大小就不錯了，蛋糕區的小泡芙甜的發齁，我能吃的就2-3種…自助早餐還可以，人不多的時候各個檔口的服務員會按需求來做，麪條很合口，烏餈飯也不錯。
房間裏沒有基礎一次性用品，牙刷前台辦理入住才會發放，我沒有找到一次性發帽，也沒有找到梳子…
以後去上海，應該不會再選擇萬豪旗下的任何一家酒店了，不想第三次還是失望。

房間還算乾淨吧，停車場免費。
其他的待我一一吐槽。
- 入住：並沒有跟我講清楚我有什麼權益，早餐的時間也未告知。進了房間，打電話問Mini Bar是否免費，電話振鈴超過2分鐘。回答完Mini Bar的問題，居然是客服把我電話直接掛了。
- 巨大的套房，放一個49寸的電視，實在是太不協調。應該因地制宜嘛。
- 總有小朋友在走廊裏大呼小叫奔跑嬉戲。
- 中餐廳不能訂座。
- 早餐無人領位，自己搶座。要把桌上的一個牌子翻成有人。按常規，五星級酒店的早餐，咖啡和茶是服務員送的，這裏沒有。食物擺放位置，歸類與大多數五星級酒店不同，品種不夠豐富，口味較差。離結束前還有1個小時，麪檔就缺少麪條品種了。
- 健身房不算小，但是通風還是不太給力，跑步時不太舒暢。
總體是個四星弱的標準。

4、電梯裏的燈壞了沒有及時修。
5、酒店車輛入口的地方標識不明顯，尤其是晚上，黑暗中看不清。
6、工作人員服務態度非常好，小童樂園也比較豐富有室內和室外，但玩具都壞了也沒有及時更換或維護。

辦理check in以後，沒有人帶你去電梯，我們兩個人帶着一個一歲小孩還拿了一堆行李，完全沒人幫你拎東西什麼。換作其他同類酒店的工作人員（也不説更高級的了）早就來幫忙了！
再説餐廳，中餐廳很小，來晚了就得等，服務員人也少，又要點單又要上菜的，也是忙不過來。口味真的一般，松鼠桂魚油到肉都炸幹了，生煎包也是油油油。
酒店房間竟然有蚊子！咬到我們小盆友臉上和腳上了，弄得他一晚上沒睡好，一直哭着撓撓，大人也就休息不好。
另外比較奇葩的是，我們兩天都在走廊和電梯廳聞到有煙味，作為親子酒店主打，你最基本的禁煙都做不到，哪個帶小朋友的還敢來？
蠻糟糕的旅行體驗了，帶着挺大的憤怒和失望敲完這麼多字，希望給到大家作參考

1.698元的自助晚餐，菜品着實潦草了，可供選擇的菜品很少，連最簡單的蔬菜色拉也沒有，而三文魚刺身，一咬肉質裏面都是冰晶，證明是重新凍過了，不新鮮。當天晚上看到有120停在大堂門口，第二天早餐時看到有食葯監的工作人員進入餐廳和廚房檢查，懷疑是前一晚有人吃出問題了。
2.大堂裏春節的春聯，上下聯掛反了，我發現後立馬和大堂經理反映了，希望反映給相關部門改進，大堂經理應付了我幾句，第二天第三天，依舊是原樣，很失望。

不能算五星 無論硬件和服務 ！

1.房間打掃問題：連前一波住客寫過的本子枕套都未更換 。 浴室裏的轉角都發黴 很多黃黃的水垢 很難想象小朋友玩的那些墊子 

2.親子酒店給小朋友準備的拖鞋巨巨巨巨臟 

3.平日800價格的房間週末翻倍 用1780定的 那你起碼拿出匹配得上的服務 。

4.提前定的酒點 下午4點多到達 前台居然説 “剛出來一間在打掃沒有別的房”

5.幾乎所有五星酒店都會備用咖啡機給到需求客人 致電問能不能來台咖啡機 前台驚訝到怎麼會有人替這樣的需求…. 近2000一晚的酒店 體現的不單是服務意識了 

6.主打親子酒店 除了房間搞了點形式 2樓就一個很小的滑梯 海洋球也少得可憐 周邊啥也沒有 帶着孩子去農家樂看了牛 …..

硬件還行，服務很差，特別是餐廳！

早餐品種少的可憐不説，裏面一個小眼睛姓陳的小矮個服務員真是絕了，一副老闆沒發工資給他的臉對客人！我説：師傅能幫忙下兩碗麪嗎？不搭理你，我以為環境吵沒聽見，就又説了一遍，還是不搭理你，最後提高了嗓門再説了一遍，這人頭也不抬的點了點頭，我就想問，酒店招聘的是啞巴嗎？我忍了！然後下出來的麪又是糊的，盛出來之後準備自己加點葱，一看沒了，就問他：師傅這個葱沒了能再加一點嗎？這個時候他終於開口了，謝天謝地謝不是啞巴，説：沒有了這個！我一看後面，就是一盒子的葱，這個時候我有點上火了，説：後面那個是什麼？他轉過頭看了一眼很不耐煩的去加葱！

然後所有的果汁都沒了，也沒人去補！跟門口登記的服務員反饋結果跟你説因為現在是高峯期人多……意思就是人多了這樣的服務態度是正常的？是可以有理由不耐煩的？聽了更加火！

早知道是這樣還不如去住隔壁的凱悦！價錢還比這個便宜！真心不推薦去住，尤其是帶娃的，難保不會對小孩上黑臉

msg:衞生間地板不夠乾淨，頭天喝了咖啡等，第二整理房間時沒有補充咖啡和餐巾紙 。
中餐廳白飯有味道，好像是陳米並且不夠熱。白切羊肉味道達不到五星酒店的品質。
游泳館內換衣間和洗澡間比較亂，用過的浴巾和礦泉水瓶到處扔，沒有及時清理。還有非游泳者進來洗澡。
電話如何使用沒有提示，電話上顯示的功能鍵不能用，而是用二個不相關的鍵（請服務員教後才知道）。

總結是我們已經在計劃下一次到崇明喜來登旅程

喜來登，萬豪旗下品牌，可以信賴
這次我們訂的是親子房，房間挺寬敞，保潔的阿姨姐姐們都很好客，跟小孩們都打成一片。負責我們入住的是Vivian 小姐，她全程都保持問候我們，雖然到店時，沒有房間，但是Vivian 會留下電話，讓我們知道客房什麼時候可以入住，服務服務非常貼心。這三天的入住的感受，加上Vivian 和其他員工的照顧，感覺非常非常非常好！崇明喜來登的這個服務真的點個贊👍 

酒店的設施齊全，有泳池，室內外遊樂場，
對父母來説，感覺非常好，放心，貼心的地方也提現在一些小孩的防護措施，很細緻。
我們對酒店員工的服務態度真的很欣賞！謝謝這次温暖的旅程!

給我們前台辦理入住的胡天成服務滿分。看我們帶着娃，幫我們升級了親子房，隨行父母也安排同一樓層。寶寶看到房間裏的擺設可開心啦。下午泳池人不多，乾淨衞生，有一個娃娃池。游泳回到房間已經送來了小蛋糕和有機小黃瓜，非常貼心。晚上去吃了推薦的農家菜，味道很不錯。第二天早飯有被提前建議8點前去，果然沒有排隊。總體來説酒店的環境衞生還是不錯的，早餐中規中矩，勝在服務，適合溜娃，下次還考慮入住。

衞生：滿分5分來説，總體4份，1分扣在細節，衞生間連房間門拉開都是灰，窗簾角落也是灰。因為孩子對粉塵過敏，躲窗簾角落立馬開始打噴嚏。
設施：房間蠻大的，小朋友活動起來很方便。但總體衹能3分，需要一次性浴缸套，沒有，房間沒有杯勺，沒有陣線包，和其他入住過的五星級沒法比。細節真的不到位。
環境：5分吧。選擇這裏，就是因為安靜，周邊玩的開車出去也方便。
服務：早餐的時候一位服務生阿姨很熱情，叫什麼忘記了，就記得名字裏有個娣。辦入住的小哥也挺好的。總體5分吧。

msg:一家毫無服務理念的酒店！竟然還是喜來登，簡直給喜來登敗好感！容我一一道來
1. 首先在預訂的時候就與眾不同，公司集體出遊，需預訂10多個房間，預訂部的銷售給我的價格比攜程要每間高200+，銷售淡定的告訴我，你自己去定攜程。後面由於又加了幾間，攜程無法在一個訂單中超過10間，再次找到該銷售，又告訴我，不接受預訂，他們衹接團隊，不接受衹定2間！那這個酒店，是散客就衹接受第三方平台預訂？如果這個是合規的話，那還有後麪的奇葩事
2.  由於大家是分別開車有前後，我在到達後，提出是分別報名字拿房間還是我這裏統一先辦理好手續，前台告訴我，一次性把名字都報給她，她給到我一個party預訂號，後面到的人，報名字或號碼就可以。於是我付了全部的房費。結果事實是，每一個，是每一個同事都被要求付錢，我一次次的去那邊解釋我已經付了，有預訂號，並且要給他們看我的付款記錄。最後衹能站在接待處一遍遍解釋。而原來的那位收錢前台不見了…… 據説去辦事了，但是他們的系統裏是不統一的麼？拿給我預訂號和一遍遍對名字是幹嘛呢？
3.  酒店説明寫清楚是3點入住，結果就是除了最開始的兩間，大部分人4點還沒拿到，最後等大家全部拿到房卡，就已經準備坐車去吃晚飯了。那你酒店寫3點入住幹嘛呢？乾脆寫5點吧！這還是週一，我實在沒辦法理解。
4. 早餐是我有史以來，上海的品牌酒店吃的最差的，沒有之一！甚至連外地都不如。喜來登集團派駐和培訓的的是什麼員工啊？ 餐飲的水準和服務實在不好意思説是五星！
5. 房間的餐巾紙衹有洗手枱這裏一點點，問了小童牙刷，説會送來，住了2晚，到走也沒送來
當初是因為考慮到隔壁凱悦是可帶寵物的，怕會比較吵，然而事實上這次的入住給我們再也不會入住喜來登由由的想法
綜上所述，崇明喜來登由由絕對不要選擇，隔壁凱悦或者島上的農家樂都比他們要有特點

設施2 ：早餐等位15分鐘 ……

尤其值班經理Bruce非常照顧我一個人帶着兩個娃過來住，因為要在附近球場打球，幫我免費延遲了半小時退房。
這次是訂的親子房套餐，有包含兩大一小早餐自助餐和早餐。晚餐自助餐驚訝到我，居然有三種味道的自助小火鍋！辣湯濃郁的麻辣燙味道太好吃了！另外還有小龍蝦！！！刺身也非常新鮮！啤酒可樂氣泡水都有！小朋友還帶了4個蘋果吃哈哈哈。我們還加了床，非常貼心的提供了多一份的浴袍拖鞋！。2米特大床也非常舒服！
由於時間比較緊張，沒來得及在酒店玩下次來崇明還要訂這間酒店。

msg:恭喜成功加入避雷指南
1 checkin，前天晚上還特地問過幾點可以checkin，告知2、3點來肯定有房。然後2點半辦的checkin，到4點半才打掃完能入住，一下午就浪費掉了，補償了次泡泡大戰算是過去了。然後房間進去後，發現咖啡杯完全就是臟的…也是無語。
2 早餐，不得不吐槽餐廳面積實在太小，整個現場無比混亂。早餐時段排隊超過40分鐘。早餐品種又少，老老實實一碗麪結束。性價比極低。
3 小朋友生日於是選了一晚酒店自助餐。小火鍋的食材也是大跌眼鏡，牛肉卷羊肉卷全都是超市冷凍貨不説了，小龍蝦也一點都沒入味。其他的菜品更不談了，熱菜幾乎沒有，火鍋食材大概就竹蟶和貝殼還可以。服務上，花生醬沒了也沒人主動去更換，小龍蝦、牛肉羊肉卷空了也沒人補，都沒幾個人吃飯不知道服務員都在忙點啥。唯一還算好的便是知道小朋友生日送了個抹茶蛋糕，加上在餐廳訂的蛋糕，都意外的蠻好吃的，分量十足。
4 其他娛樂設施上，游泳池大概剛重開，意料之外的人少，幾個小朋友玩的挺開心。小童樂園還是當作不存在吧…不過，出酒店大門左轉河邊小路上，可以釣螃蟹，橋洞底下也挺涼快，螃蟹也多，可以玩好久。

除了這點之外，其他都可以，並且入住時給我們免費升級了。別墅也很大。
另外要注意的是，兩個房間區別太大，一個主卧很大裝修也好很多，次卧相對小且裝修一般。如果是朋友同行，要提前商量好誰住哪個房間，免得尷尬。不知道之前預訂的小些的別墅兩個房間是不是會更平均些。

2、當天晚上7點check in，被通知7:30要集體測核酸，我們當天中午12點對剛做過核酸，問是否不需要再做，前台換了個不知道是經理還是什麼的小頭頭出來説，必須要做，政府通知的，問他咬具體通知文件，説是口頭通知，完了還嚇唬我們説“今天剛被確診一個，就在陳塘鎮”。上海一天確診幾千例都經歷過了，還能被你嚇到？我就呵呵了。
3、被通知7:30做核酸時問，酒店一共多少人？小頭頭回答200多人，我説200多人你們都通知一個時間點下來做核酸，那不是要等很久？不會造成人員聚集？此問題一拋出，那小頭頭居然給我來了句“那你説怎麼辦？你給出了建議！”敢情我是你僱來出解決方案的是吧？我把我擔心的問題提出來，你一個酒店管理人員不幫着解決反過來要求我來解決這問題，你們老總知道他們養了一個**嗎？笑容可掬倒是練得很到位，就是太假太噁心！
4、因為疫情，早飯不能堂食，要下樓去餐廳拿了後回房間吃，問他們有沒有送餐服務，他們説有，但是早飯不送，呵呵………
5、此次是二次入住，因為第一次體驗很好，這次特意帶着女兒來的，這種管理水平的酒店，沒遇到問題樣樣都還好，一旦遇到情況，所有的問題立馬現原形。

msg:酒店的位置不錯，去東灘濕地公園都比較方便。在崇明算是性價比比較高的酒店，服務和設施都很棒，酒店的泳池非常大，有小孩泳池，温度在30℃左右，非常舒服。客房衞生也挺好，浴缸很大，泡澡非常舒服。前廳經理Allan招待周到，為我安排了不錯的朝向，安排訂餐，隨時網上溝通，輕鬆便捷，非常貼心，還幫我安排好離店的車輛。值得推薦。

msg:其實還不錯、前台服務真的態度很好、可能疫情關係、早餐品種不多但味道還是不錯的、來往入住的人其實也不少了、泳池沒開有點失望。很安逸很享受不吵鬧的環境，隔音稍微差那麼一點、總體來説過關
