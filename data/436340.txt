The kids loved swimming in the pool, I was pleasantly surprised that we were provided a locker key with a towel and slippers for us to use at the pool. Even better, they had some kids floats available, and a couple of kids slippers next to the floats. It was a two lane pool, long enough for adults to do a few laps, but we had the pool basically to ourselves! Breakfast was also great, with the highlight for me being bacon and eggs (made to order, fried/over easy/omelette, scrambled, etc) lots of different choices for other main dishes, and pastries, toast, fruits, juices, etc. Wonderful visit, it made it a very special day for my son's birthday!

Check-in went smoothly. The room was spacious and comfortable at night, and it was very quiet. We had lunch in the hotel restaurant, which was in the outdoor garden.

Miss Vicky not only has a first-class service attitude, but also has a very high work efficiency. She is enthusiastic and professional, and can always solve the needs of guests in the first place. The facilities in the suite are all available, spacious and comfortable, making people feel like they are at home. The bedding is soft and comfortable, allowing people to have a good night's sleep. The bathroom supplies are also of high quality, making people feel extremely comfortable.

Here, I would like to especially thank Miss Vicky for her thoughtful service. Her attentiveness not only made the two overseas friends feel the warmth of home. Five-star praise, well deserved! 💖 Shanghai Boya Hotel, I will come again!

msg:I always stay at Boya Hotel every time I go on a business trip, but for reasons known to all, the last time I came here was three years ago. This stay was a mixed experience.

Thumbs up: The room type has been upgraded. Try to arrange for my colleagues and I to live on the first floor. The room is quite large, relatively clean, and quite quiet. Heating eye masks, cervical spine patches, and abdominal patches were given as gifts. The housekeeper saw that I drank up two bottles of water on the first night, and took the initiative to put two more bottles of water on the second night.

Complaints: The pillows are too soft, they collapse after a while and have no support, and the pillows are too high, which makes my neck hurt when I sleep on them.
The variety and style of breakfast are okay. In this winter, the soy milk is cold (my colleagues went to have breakfast after 7 o'clock and it was also cold). Salads and fruits are even iced. Breakfast is not until 10 o'clock. There is nothing to eat in the Chinese food section at 9:30.
The front desk is not skilled in business. When checking out, they did not ask whether the customer needs to print an invoice on the spot. They just asked the customer to stand and solve the problem of the printer running out of paper. But in fact, I booked the order from Ctrip, and the invoice and bill were both When you go to Ctrip, you can leave after handing in your room card.

It is very close to the Zhangjiang subway station, next to the Legend Square, and there is also a business district not far from the Jinke Road subway station. It is very convenient to eat.

msg:This National Day, I experienced the parent-child package of Boya Hotel. Let me share my experience below.
Hotel environment: the appearance is very elegant, and the internal hardware facilities are complete. There is gym and swimming pool. The water in the swimming pool is very hot to the eyes. If you go again in the future, you should bring a bottle of eye drops. There is a lot of dirt floating in the sauna pool in the locker room, maybe it is already evening and has been soaked for many rounds.
Check-in status: Welcome fruit is prepared in the hotel room. Surprisingly, a cartoon travel toothbrush was prepared for the children. The mini bar can be completely ignored, only a can of Sprite and Coke in the refrigerator.
I don't know if the air conditioner in the room is broken. I woke up several times in the middle of the night and found that the air conditioner turned off automatically. The wallpaper is all degummed, I should be able to sleep well when I go home tonight [sleep]
Buffet [Candy]: I was surprised that the business was really good. There are a lot of people, although there are not many varieties, but many parents also eat very happily. I almost didn't take the whole dinner bowl with me. Anyway, there is nothing delicious, just serve dessert🍮
💎Highlight moment [spit]: The pastry chef in the hotel is too good. There is no thunder in each dish, and the first mouthful is already amazing. Especially in the Schwarzwälder Kirsch Torte Black Forest, you can clearly taste the delicateness of the material 🍒 the aroma of cherry sauce left between the teeth and the aftertaste of a hint of rum. Their Italian foreman is very capable. When he learned that the customer needs to order a cake, he immediately called the pastry chef to me. I thought the pastry chef was from France or Italy, but I didn't expect it to be a little brother from Shanghai with a handsome face and an amiable face like a lucky cat. It’s really for us in Shanghai [strong] 🌹 This experience, to taste such international standard dim sum that exceeds expectations 🥧 is also a worthwhile trip. Go to afternoon tea alone next time☕️

msg:I don’t know how to get so many good reviews. They also promote the designer hotel. The room layout is more than five meters away from the bed and the TV. The sofa is backed by the window, and the curtains have to be squeezed into the gap between the back of the sofa and the wall. Curtains, I wanted to call to change the room, but the front desk said that all the standard rooms and double beds have this layout. I don’t know if there is any misunderstanding of the designer. The takeaway can only be taken from the takeaway shelf at the door. It is said that the food delivery robot is being purchased, and it is inconvenient to go downstairs, so the takeaway is not easy to order. Fortunately, there is a family downstairs who bought some food in advance. When you check in at night, there are singers in the lobby bar and the a**osphere is good, but you don't have much time to enjoy it. Check in to get a piece of fruit, and there is Coke Sprite in the small refrigerator. It may be that many people live near Zhangjiang Microelectronics Port for business trips, and the price is expensive even if the room is full. I probably won't choose this place for my next business trip.

I found the quiet location of the hotel very pleasant. Subway station near Zhangjiang High Technology Park, from there you can get to East Nanjing Road in 20 minutes.

Room
My room was a pleasant size (estimated ＜40 sqm). Equipped with a desk, large seating area, separate bedroom and large bathroom. The bathroom also had a shower that you could move around in. Relatively large wall-mounted TV that was easy to see from the bed. The built-in cupboards offered plenty of space for a weekend. The room's furnishings were very well maintained and of course absolutely clean (no residue from the previous guest).

Service
Here too, the hotel stands out from other high-priced hotels. From reception to breakfast service, the staff are highly trained. Super friendly and helpful without seeming artificial. Even if the Corona situation forces the hotel to organize a stricter hygiene concept, guests don't have a bad feeling. The hotel's service handled the situation superbly.

Special feature
The hotel has a very nice inner courtyard, when the Corona situation has improved you can have a drink in the evening in a pleasant a**osphere.

Totally unworthy of Ctrip 5
The staff have no sense of service
A female employee at check-in, I asked for a twin room, she said they were random, I said I booked a double bed, she asked me to provide a voucher, I clicked on the call log, and made it clear that after I booked I called the hotel twice, booked a swimming lesson and asked for a twin room. The hotel said that they would confirm my order by calling me when I saw my order. I didn't receive a phone confirmation until I checked in. She said there was no double bed, and I said Ctrip. The twin bed was still available that day, but I contacted Ctrip, and she was reluctant to help me change the twin bed. This is the first time I encountered such a poor service staff, and later I saw the kart and swimming pool staff many times. They are all shouting at the children who have experienced the past, only to know that this hotel has no service consciousness at all.
Then there is the so-called buffet dinner. The dishes are really poor. The big meat is braised chicken, fried dragon fish, the small meat is lettuce and shrimp balls, and the vegetarian dishes include fried cabbage, fried cauliflower, mushrooms, corn, potato wedges, and the staple tomato pasta. , shrimp dumplings, rice, and two kinds of soup, the above is all the hot dishes, the breakfast is even more shabby, there is no noodles. . .
The location is also very biased. There is not even a shadow outside the hotel. The Legend Square next to it is not open for Chinese New Year. There are no other attractions around. It's a very poor experience.

msg:This hotel must give a bad review. There are two doors in the room and the next room. I asked the front desk for the reason. The front desk said it was a suite, so I was rubbing my IQ. The room is not private at all. The breakfast is also poor, don't want it, the dishes are poor, and there is no noodles to be cooked first. Generally speaking, it is a stale and old hotel, only pretending to be forced. There are pictures and the truth, this breakfast is not worth the discount.

🍃Environment: Chris**as is approaching, and the Chris**as a**osphere in the lobby is very strong. The TV in the room cannot project the screen, and it is not that smart.
🔔Service: The staff is service-minded and has a very good attitude. Yuki at the front desk upgraded the room type when I checked in. It was the first time I was upgraded when I stayed in a hotel. Hahahahahahahahaha 😂Thank you little beauty. If you need anything, call the front desk, and the staff member Lucy will help solve the problem and provide timely feedback. It’s a very good check-in experience, highly recommended.
