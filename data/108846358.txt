msg:Had a lovely 1 night stay here - the hotel is right in the middle of the old town area but down a quiet back street so it’s nice and quiet on an evening but a close walk to the tourist areas.

Ula and Leo on reception were very helpful, they kept checking in on us by wechat to make sure everything was ok and we had everything we needed - they also let us do a late check out for no extra charge.

The aesthetic of the hotel is very traditional Chaozhou style, but the rooms are very modern inside.

No complaints at all and would definitely stay again if I come back to Chaozhou.

msg:The hotel is hidden in the back ailes of the Chaozhou old town, close to all the buzzes of the main street yet maintains nice tranquillity for good rest. Its architecture combines a traditional Chaozhou style and a modern Japanese minimalist design. We also got exclusive access to the old residence of Rao Zongyi, a hundred-year-old traditional mansion of articulate Chinese architecture.

The staff are all locals, well trained, professional and friendly. They are very considerate of our needs during the entire stay. Hotel facilities are also top-notch. 

Would recommend this place if you’re looking for a local yet exclusive experience.

It is very convenient to go to various attractions. You can walk there, and the hotel has its own attractions. It rained on the first day we went there, and it happened to be Monday when the Han Wengong Temple and other places were closed. When we returned to the hotel, the girl at the front desk accompanied us all the way and explained. It was really a great feeling. I like Ula and Leo at the front desk. Parking is also very convenient. Park the car at Nanyi Hotel outside the hotel. The hotel will have a battery shuttle to pick you up. Every time you go out of the ancient city hotel, there will be a car to send you out. Every night, there will be a thermos cup to send sweet soup. It is really heartwarming. It can be said that it was a very satisfactory stay. BVLGARI bath set, Dyson hair dryer, hardware facilities are super good

It is more than 200 meters to walk to Paifang Street and Kaiyuan Temple, and more than 500 meters to walk to Guangji Bridge. It is very convenient to stay in the hotel and stroll around the ancient city. The hotel environment is elegant and the style of Chinese gardens. The facilities are relatively high-end, and the toiletries are provided by the Bulgari series, which is quite good.
The most important thing is that the hotel staff are enthusiastic and very patient! Ula and Leo warmly received us throughout the whole process and communicated on WeChat. The other staff I met were very kind and enthusiastic! The staff of Youxiong Bar and the buffet restaurant, as well as the shuttle bus driver, are very good. The hotel delivers fruits and desserts to the room every day. Snacks such as voss purified water and chocolate in the room are also free. The hotel rooms are not equipped with TVs, but there is free Chaozhou Yashixiang Dancong tea. You can experience Chaoshan Kung Fu tea in the room and yard in your spare time. In addition, next to the hotel is the former residence of Mr. Jao Tsung-i, and guests staying in the hotel can visit it for free.
This is the first time I have come into contact with the Youxiong brand under Vanke. I feel great for a two-day family stay. The hotel's environment, location, facilities, gifts and services are worth the room rate. A very good stay experience!

It is worth praising that the study room in the reception hall on the first floor of the hotel leads directly to the former residence of Jao Tsung-I (a great scholar) next door. The former residence is only open to hotel guests. The former residence has the Tianxiaolou Library where Jao Tsung-I studied hard as a child. It used to be the largest private library in Chaozhou.
The hotel's service is very attentive and considerate. They think about what the guests want and always provide the necessary services before you ask.

Facilities: comfortable, modern bathroom
Hygiene: clean and tidy with a fragrant smell (magnolia fragrance)
Environment: beautiful, reflecting the harmonious beauty of architecture and people everywhere
Service: warm, considerate, and comprehensive. The hotel has a battery car that can pick up guests to the taxi point outside the ancient city

After booking, the hotel took the initiative to contact to inform the location and pick-up. Thank you Linda and ula for their enthusiastic service. They recommended various types of meals and didn't step on thunder. When I returned to the room at night, I saw the sweet soup on the table.
The hotel environment is very special and artistic. It can be described as a scene at every step. I just didn't take many photos. I recommend the courtyard room type 101. On the far left of the first floor, there are ancient trees and pavilions at the door. When it rained the next morning, it was really pleasant to sit in the pavilion and look at the ancient trees and listen to the rain hitting the banana leaves.
Although the breakfast restaurant is not big, the big sister's service is very warm and considerate, and the food supply is sufficient.

Due to the flight delay, it was already 11 o'clock in the evening when we arrived at the hotel, but the housekeeper still received us warmly and drove the battery car out of the street to greet us. Entering the hotel lobby, the full sense of design hits you in the face. It is simple and luxurious. It not only retains the vicissitudes of ancient buildings, but also combines modern facilities. The bluestone paving, the lush century-old Pingpo trees, the "convex and concave" mirror waterscape, and the rows of vertical windows in the corridor all interpret the quality of this store. The room has a reasonable layout and complete facilities. They are all big-name electrical appliances, and there are a lot of additional gifts. . . Voss mineral water, mini bar retail beverages, capsule coffee, self-service Kung Fu tea, and the breakfast is even more rich, full self-service Chinese and Western style, five-star hotel standards. The economics and management got up late in the morning, but the waiter still helped me reserve it until 11:00. In short, it perfectly covers all hotels and homestays in Chaozhou. Highly recommended!

1.Service
On the day of arrival, the front desk will proactively contact you to inform you of the parking space and provide a battery car to pick you up from the parking lot. For every trip during your stay, the hotel will provide a battery car to connect you to places in the ancient city where motor vehicles cannot travel. During my stay, every employee I met greeted me with a smile, took the initiative to say hello and provided proactive service. This is not easy. Nowadays, many five-star resort hotels priced at 2,000+/night cannot fully provide warm and friendly service.
2. Room facilities
The decoration is very Japanese, which can also be said to be modern and simple. The room is fully equipped with capsule coffee machine, teapot set, tea mineral water, Dyson blower, and bathroom facilities are all of high quality. The cloakroom is large and luggage can be placed very conveniently.
3. Quiet environment
Although the hotel is in the ancient city, it is very quiet and there is no noise at all in the morning.
4. Disadvantages
The lights in the bathroom are too dim, which is not friendly for women who need to put on makeup. It is recommended to install a retractable makeup mirror with a light.

Serve. Caring and thoughtful. The front desk contacted the hotel by phone one day in advance and added WeChat to learn about the store time and was told that there would be a battery car to pick up and drop off the hotel at the Xiashui Gate. We arrived at the hotel early and hadn't been able to check in yet. The lady at the front desk made us tea and the staff took us around Jao Tsung-i's former residence. Every staff member in the store will greet you when you meet them, and they are just right polite and warm. The lady at the front desk also informed you of weather, temperature, tourist attractions and other warm tips through WeChat. After 8 p.m., sugar water will be packed in thermos bottles and delivered to each room.
environment. The quiet courtyard is integrated with the modern space design. Walking in the courtyard feels very quiet, relaxing and very comfortable. The room was very big. It was so satisfying to drink tea with my best friends in the small courtyard, eat welcome fruits and play with mobile phones on the tatami.
facility. What surprised me most about the whole room was not the Dyson hair dryer or the shower room that is spacious enough for a family to take a bath, nor the Bvlgari toiletries, nor the smart toilet, nor the king size bed, but a small wooden bench in the dressing room. This little bench is so thoughtful when I’m putting on my shoes or packing my luggage! This has not been encountered in other star hotels. There is no TV in the room. I asked the lady at the front desk to help us install one if necessary. I was a little surprised that it could be installed temporarily. The service attitude was excellent.
breakfast. For a hotel in this price range, the breakfast is a little more refined, but I think it has everything it should have, including Chinese white porridge with preserved eggs and lean meat porridge, boiled eggs, rice dumplings, glutinous rice balls, rice cakes, vegetables, and freshly cooked rice noodles. , noodles, kuey gravy skin. Western-style bread, bacon, sausage, hash browns, and brewed cereal crunch. A variety of coffee, milk, soy milk, tea, yogurt, juice. fruit salad. Complete range.
health. Very clean, very clean, very clean.
Areas that can be improved: I saw butter in the breakfast area but not the butter knife. There was a coffee cup but no coffee spoon. The quality of pillows is average, not as good as Atour. Although the toiletries are from Bvlgari, they are not easy to use. The water is VOSS mineral water, but the cap is very difficult to unscrew. The sound insulation of the door is not good, I often hear people talking outside the door.

The hardware and software facilities are great. They made tea for us when we checked in and provided sweet water in the evening. The breakfast was very local and the fried rice noodles were cooked to order a la carte. It was very delicious.

The staff were friendly and attentive. Due to traffic control, our car was parked in a parking lot far away. The hotel boy drove a battery shuttle truck for several kilometers to deliver us to the parking lot.

The food in the ancient city of Chaozhou is the destination of our trip. We tried no less than 10 kinds of food and it was a worthwhile trip.

If you come to Chaozhou next week, you must stay here again

The only drawback is that the breakfast is so-so, but next time I come to Chaozhou Ancient City, I will choose Xiong Xiong, which makes me look forward to their other hotels.

msg:On this trip to Chaozhou, I stayed at Chaozhou Youxiong. Although there are mixed reviews online, the actual stay is still worthy of praise. It is located in the busiest Pai Fang Street, within walking distance to popular attractions such as Guangji Bridge. Each step in the hotel creates a resonance between history and modern times. The courtyard terrace is also a great place to sit and have a cup of Kung Fu tea. The breakfast was indeed average, but the difference was the aunt's warm smile. Linda at the front desk sent us text messages to inform us of various precautions before leaving, which was of great help to us.

It is hidden away from the city, and the overall design has a strong sense of a**osphere. It has a smart toilet, a Dyson hair dryer, Bvlgari toiletries, daily fruit and sugar water before going to bed (I had white fungus and mung bean soup). For a family trip, children can sleep on tatami mats. There are also some Chaozhou special snacks for breakfast, and I told the housekeeper that he can respond in time and respond to all requests. I am really satisfied.

There are 20 rooms in total, and they are fully booked every day during the festival, but the service does not slack off at all. All staff at the front desk, battery car, cleaning, and restaurant are polite, warm and thoughtful. The rooms may seem simple but are actually exquisitely decorated, paying great attention to the actual living experience of the guests. Only hotel guests are allowed to visit the former residence of Jao Tsung-i, and staff will explain it. Thanks to Youxiong for giving me such a happy time of peace and tranquility.

The staff will greet you when they see you on the road. They are very enthusiastic and respond to customer service needs very quickly. The pick-up and drop-off are also very good and patient. I brought three children with me and had a lot of luggage. It was very good to help me find handbags at the front desk. If there is something to mail, I will go directly to the room to pick it up and mail it. The most important thing is that my son's tablet was left in the room, and he quickly sent me a message and arranged to send it to me. Finally, there is a great little yard, it is nice to sit quietly and watch the sky! And when checking in, they prepared New Year gifts! Very heartwarming!

msg:First of all, I would like to thank all the staff including Linda and Lily. I would also like to thank the young man from Zhangzhou at the front desk for his patient explanation and taking us to visit the former residence of Jao Tsung-i, which can only be entered by bears who live there. I would also like to express my special thanks to the cleaning lady who helped me put away the things left in the bathroom. The braces inside have really helped me a lot! The hotel's battery car service also effectively reduces the walking distance for parents. Although the hotel is deep in the old city and cannot be reached directly by car, the battery car service allows us to not feel too much running around. The restaurant staff are also very proactive and enthusiastic.

Having said that, I also want to talk about the problems seriously. I must declare: The problems mentioned below have nothing to do with any of the staff we have direct contact with this time. They are all great.

1. The butler service is very considerate, but lacks a proactive system to contact guests. If I hadn't taken the initiative to call the hotel, I wouldn't have known that the battery car could be picked up at the intersection before checking in. This would have caused great inconvenience and directly affected the first experience. Songtsan's system is in place on this point. As soon as you book a room, the housekeeper will take the initiative to call you and fully explain how to get there. Another note: We were not proactively notified of the excellent services such as battery-powered cars that can be used to tour some sections of the scenic area and tours of former residences. If we hadn’t read other guest guides and applied to the hotel ourselves, these services would be very difficult. May be missed;

2. The concept of Youxiong is to experience the city locally. We can clearly feel the bears in Shenzhen. This is why I took my parents to choose Youxiong in Chaozhou this time. Unfortunately, although the hardware brand, construction quality, and spatial scale of the room are all online, the design is lazy. It is difficult for you to feel the Chaozhou flavor in the room. It does not mean that crude placement of local customs or symbols is the sense of place. Of course, it can be designed to be restrained and subtle, and combined with a comfortable and modern experience, but it must be there. There is no room design this time. The so-called minimalism has really become simplicity, not simplicity. Afternoon tea is just a fruit plate, not even a local refreshment or a cup of local drink, and these are the strengths of Chaozhou that can be easily picked up! disappointing. Likewise, good night sugar water, mung bean soup and white fungus soup on two nights respectively. ． 𠕇There is reason to suspect that the manager has not really understood and fallen in love with Chaozhou, even if she/he is a local. These are not a problem in ordinary business hotels, but they completely fall short of the concepts promoted by Youxiong.


3． The cloakroom and luggage room are large, but there are few hangers and no shoehorns. These themselves cost very little, but are useful and again reflect a lack of insight into the guest experience.

4. A hotel in this price range, without the hardware of a five-star hotel such as a swimming pool, should at least be equipped with bath salts and other bath products as a boutique high-standard hotel.

5. The refrigerator supplies are also too standardized, and none of them reflect local characteristics.

Having said so much, I still hope it will be better with bears, and I look forward to having the same surprise of first meeting again when we meet again in the next city!

Vanke Youxiong Hotel is committed to the renovation of ancient buildings. The first family chose Jiayuan, the ancestral home of I.M. Pei in Suzhou, designed by Qingshan Zhouping. This time it was Chunyuan, the former residence of Jao Tsung-i. Li Yiliang hosted the event, and he was more precise in the local culture.
For example, the four points of gold, the octagonal gate, the Huoxiang, etc. were restored as before by Xiao Chuming, a non-hereditary person of wooden structure, and Ding Du, a famous ancient architect, and the lanterns at the entrance were made by Huang Qiuquan, another non-hereditary person. The interior design retains the openness and orderliness of Chaoshan mansions, using light wood instead of traditional dark paint, paired with handmade furniture by Tang Chunguang and selected books by Linghu Lei, incorporating the old into the new and interpreting the past with the present.
Nowadays, hotels are all about culture, but few are consistent in their words and deeds.

Breakfast is semi-buffet, with made-to-order items. Several guests who were dining at the same time felt the same way. The texture of some dim sum dough needs to be improved.
The guided tour of Jao Tsung-I’s former residence and the good night dessert are bonus points.

A lot of localized design, restoration and integration have been done, and the details are great. I borrow scenes from everywhere and see the big from the small. The service of every staff member is super good, butler-style service. I am very satisfied and will recommend it to my friends.
The former residence of Mr. Rao Tsung-i and the garden next to Youxiong were first built by Rao Tsung-i's father, Rao E.
Rao's father was a great scholar. He studied in Shanghai in his early years and often visited gardens in the south of the Yangtze River. After returning to his studies, he built a Suzhou Literary Garden style garden next to his house, and nicknamed himself "The Lay Gardener". The Tianxiao Tower in the garden was where the young Jao ​​Tsung-i studied, and the square pavilion in the garden was where Jao Tsung-i studied. A place overlooking the Han River.
In the 1950s, the former residence of Jao Tsung-I was transferred to Mr. Huang Jingyun, a friend of Mr. Jao Tsung-I and a cultural leader in Thailand. In 2011, the building was listed as a cultural relic protection unit in Chaozhou City and is now the Qiao Pi Museum.

msg:It was my first time to go to Chaozhou and I chose Youxiong in the ancient city. The location is good and convenient for traveling. The hotel design is high-quality and the staff are friendly. The hardware is good and the breakfast and late-night snacks are also very appetizing. There are only a few comments I would like to make. As a modern person, I hope the hotel can be renovated. TV, in addition, I booked two rooms, one twin bed and one king bed. The light in the double bed room was enough, but the twin bed room was too dark. We had to add lights later. But the hotel overall is very good and worth going back!

msg:The design style of the hotel feels good to me personally. It integrates with the ancient house and has a Japanese simple style. The reading lamp has been used in Japanese hotels. It is embedded in the headboard of the bed. When pulled out, it is bright and easy to use. The restaurant uses a large number of modern celebrity pictures, which seems to awaken the guests' vitality for a new day. The countertop materials in bathrooms and minibars can leave cup marks and water stains, which may occur soon after opening, and may be difficult to maintain in the future. The free tour of Jao Tsung-I's ancient residence was amazing, and the introduction was very detailed, so I gave it a thumbs up! The waiters in the restaurant are also very warm, polite and as friendly as the big sister next door. Special mention should be made of Lily Linao at the front desk who was very considerate in her service. She contacted her one day in advance to ask about the travel time and reserved a parking space. When she arrived, she went out to greet her. She responded quickly to all requests, which is worthy of praise. Finally, I hope the Youxiong brand will do better!

The toiletries are from Bvlgari, the hair dryer is from Dyson, the minibar is free, and the turndown service includes papaya milk good night dessert~ The sofa in the room is very spacious and can sleep alone. It's very convenient to go out on Archway Street. If you want to see the Guangji Bridge light show, you can just go out of the water gate and cross the zebra crossing to see it. The hotel is very quiet and has good sound insulation. The room I booked didn't have a TV. The ancient city is so nice to visit, so this didn't hinder me at all. There is a dining bar opposite. Breakfast is relatively simple, but sufficient.
Service: The service is very good. Whether you are checking in or checking out, there will be dedicated staff driving golf carts to pick you up. The licorice fruit recommended by my brother is very delicious. In addition, after arriving at the store, you can make an appoin**ent to visit Yao Zhai inside the hotel. The little guy who showed us around was very patient. Both the guy who greeted me at the front desk that day and Xiao Lin who showed me the direction of the back door when I left the hotel were both very nice. Including the cleaning aunt. Thanks for the hospitality.
Environment: The environment is very good. It has a courtyard and landscaping. There is a big tree in the center of the courtyard. When I turn on the projection at night, I feel like I see a tree full of fireflies.

Hygiene: Overall satisfied.

Even though we arrived at the store very late at night, the housekeeper still came to pick us up very thoughtfully. He responded instantly via WeChat and the guide he gave us was very thoughtful. If you follow Youxiong's guide exactly, you can eat very authentic food. The hotel facilities are all at a five-star level, including Bvlgari toiletries, and requests for firmer mattresses and pillows were quickly resolved. The service is considerate and warm, and the front desk often invites us to drink tea. I was very satisfied with the trip I arranged to visit Jao Tsung-i's former residence. The former residence has local characteristics and is maintained in a simple and exquisite way. It should be the most memorable attraction during the trip to Chaozhou. The girl in charge of explaining and the front desk clerk Xiaolin did a good job and made you feel at home.

Whether it was the contact before departure, the reception after arrival, or the various services after check-in, it was worth the price! This money was spent willingly. It was the first time I drank sugar water in a hotel. The types were different every day. What was even more considerate was that the sugar water was iced. In this hot weather, it was really nice to drink a bowl of ice-cold sugar water after going out for fun. Comfortable😌

The service at Youxiong was also very good. We even went to the bar for a party in the evening and the drinks were OK. There is nothing bad about it, and the products are definitely worth the price.
In the morning, I visited the yellow-style mansion that can only be accessed from this hotel. It was quite perfect. You can see all the private residences you want to see.

msg:This time I chose to stay at the third Xiong Hotel in China, Chaozhou Xiong. It continues to retain the characteristic antique charm of Xiong, and integrates the old and the new. The design not only retains the charm of the ancient house, but also embellishes it with the Chaozhou lanterns of Mr. Huang Qiuquan, an intangible cultural heritage. In each space, mortise and tenon joints, braided rattan, linen, solid wood, etc. are used to blend Eastern and Western classics. How should I put it, I have high expectations in terms of environment and design, so I feel a sense of disparity. Details need to be improved, and the service needs to be improved.

The waiter's attitude is very good and the service is considerate.
The location is within the ancient city wall, which is extremely convenient.
When you feel tired from walking in the ancient city, you can immediately go back to your room to rest and recuperate.

-衞生間：設計較合理，雙台盆、浴缸、智能馬桶。吹風機戴森，也帶吹筒。洗浴用品是寶格麗。
-餐食：晚八點後會有免費甜湯裝在保温壺裡送到房間，介於芋圓和湯圓的丸子，口感不錯，就是偏甜，感覺可以變成自己加糖比較好。早餐的話蠻有潮汕特色，各種粿都有，沒必要在外面街上購買了，早餐試一下就夠了。自助十樣菜，兩種粥，現煮粿條米粉自選四樣配菜，也有現磨咖啡機。總結是房費帶可以吃，一百自購不划算。
-交通：進出古城會用黑色遊覽車接送，很方便。走到打車點也很近，路途平坦。古城內到各景點均約10mins，非常方便。
-遊覽：酒店內有饒宗頤故居，有講解員，迷你但是挺漂亮的。

位置：就在古城裡麪，出門2分鐘就可以走到鬧市。但酒店確實鬧中取靜的清幽空間。從預訂到離點，能感受到管家對工作的認真及熱愛
房間：這次共選3間房，大家都很滿意。
用餐：早餐也不錯，7:30-10:30供應。有現煮的粉面。
特點：酒店旁邊就是饒宗頤的舊居，住店可以免費參觀，還有請工作人員帶領參觀講解
停車：酒店外有停車位，如果早到可以有位置，沒位置可以聯繫酒店有專門的擺渡車從最近的停車場接到酒店
整體來説對比皇冠假日，一定選這裏！

酒店就位於古城內，離牌坊街，廣濟門非常近，遊覽和吃飯都非常方便。

But for such a high-end hotel, the breakfast is not satisfactory and needs to be improved to match the level of the hotel. (There is no buffet, the kway teow is served very slowly, everything is ready)

總的來説，潮州有熊酒店是一家物超所值的住宿選擇，小林前台的熱情服務讓我留下了深刻的印象。如果你計劃前來潮州，一定要考慮入住這裏！
