The hotel room is very large, with a wide view, relatively private and quiet, with birds singing and flowers fragrant. There are many swimming pools, and there are also many activities. Bringing children to play must be very enjoyable.

msg:The hotel has a very nice appearance and the potential to be a real luxury resort. We had some very nice days and can recommend the hotel.
 Unfortunately, there are some points that drag you down and you don't expect from a 5-star hotel.
There was a really musty smell in the room coming from the ventilation duct.  Suspect that the rooms are left without any kind of air flow if there are no guests, which causes it to rot.  The hotel should remedy this asap, as in the worst case this affects the health of the hotel's guests.
During our 4-day stay, it was not possible to swim in the sea on the beach.  This is because of the hotel's rules.  I saw no reason why there should be a red flag and that people who could swim, should not be able to swim in 10cm high waves.
In addition, those who will provide service to the hotel's guests (reception, concierge, restaurant) should be able to speak satisfactory enough English to communicate with their guests.
There should be more toilets by the pool area.  And remove the smell of smoke from the toilets in the hotel lobby.

It is somewhat out and away from city so it is good if you want to spend most of your time t the hotel. The breakfast was expensive (240 RMB per person is kind of steep considering I have paid 1000 per night and for some reason the breakfast was not included. It is family friendly so if you have kids this might be the hotel for you.

msg:The hotel is very nice and wonderful for a relaxing holiday near the beach. Yalong Bay has a great sandy beach with lots of water sports activities. It is the right place for a quite stay with a family or children. The hotel is also great for a relaxing stay. The breakfast is amazing and the hotel personal is super friendly and helpful. The outdoor swimming pools and gym are another plus of the hotel. I in particular enjoyed the Yoga course with the amazing coach there!
If someone is more interested in vibrant night life the Yalong Bay may possibly be too quite there. The bar in the hotel was often closed before the announced closing time. I also felt it was a bit strange that is not allowed to use the pools after 6 pm. Even when I go to swim in the sea at my own risk after 6 pm there came a guard and asked me to leave the water. All this is a typical hotel focused on families with children. 
Still I enjoyed my stay very much !

msg:Nice location; most of the staff are on point

The service the first day via the bar order system was bad. 20 mins and nothing came (can see the girl doing nothing). Called the line and got ‚Äúno English Haha.. transfer you‚Äù. This happened three times. Went over to the bar and she scrambled ‚Äúoh oh sorry. I will make‚Äù. She had done nothing the whole time so I just asked for a refund. Made the complaint at the front desk and was offered things (didn‚Äôt want) point was to make the service better - not ask for extras. Ended up talking with a F&B manager who said I could add his WeChat for the next time I order. This seemed strange: the ordering system was not the problem.. the staff was. Again declined the free offering (a coconut). 

Last day trying to get a fapiao and the information was wrong, the amount was wrong. Had I not double checked I would have had an issue with the company reimbursement. 2nd time for the fapiao and again information was slightly incorrect / off. Asked for dates of arrival and departure to be added. 

The managers want to make things right but it‚Äôs not their jobs to apologize for the staff. It would be better to train staff to ensure quality and consistency. The majority of people I interacted with were kind, said Hello, etc. but the few not so great ones made the experience frustrating. Again, I didn‚Äôt voice anything in order to gain some benefits - just wanted to have an enjoyable experience

Pros: beautiful pool, nice beach, large rooms, great gym
Cons: the breakfast buffet is madness (get there early or expect to queue), inconsistent information from staff, the rooms are a little dated but I didn‚Äôt come to spend the holiday in the room (wood chairs and tile floors make screeching sounds that can be heard through walls), mens and womens spa pools were filthy (mosquito larvae). Guessing no one goes to them.

Overall, it is still a good experience but definitely be aware that you need to possibly deal with certain hiccups

The hotel is a maze! You have to walk through the building a lot to get to the restaurant and a lobby. Wherever you go, you have to walk a long hallway. And that hallway always have cigarette smell. The hallway carpet is dirty and stinky.
 The room walls are thin. Last night we spent a night hearing neighbor guys partying and vomiting, then cigarette smoke. 
I needed to attend online course yesterday and I was unable to attend from my room, but you cannot find lounge area from the public area. So I sat on the hallway floor to attend course, and I found out that there was a cigarette butt on the ground. It is surprising that you cannot find public space with a chair and a table from five star hotel. 
The hotel has a nice beach access and good swimming pool as well as kids playground. But not a worth the price. Too expensive for this amenities.

There is a dehumidifier in the room, which is really necessary, thank you. It‚Äôs so convenient to put a hanger from the balcony and dry clothes right in the room.

msg:I had a great experience at the hotel. I booked 5 nights and stayed 2 days more. The rooms are clean, the bed and shower amazing and the view is breathtaking. Breakfast is delicious with many options. Even with the outbreak the hotel managed to give you the best they could. Unfortunately the beach in front the hotel, was closed and we needed to walk a long way to the public beach, maybe they hotel could provide a sort of shuttle to go to it, once it is almost impossible to walk under the summer sun. The staffs are friendly and try to help as much as they can and most important, speak great English. A biggest thank you for the front desk staff Phoebe, that helped us a lot to solve a big issue with a car rental company, she is the best, always willing to help, also to the security guard Elaine!!

When we first arrived there was construction on the beach which we had not been told about. We were quickly upgraded by the manager but the conversatiom was very short. The pools and gym were good. Drinks and food is overpriced and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table at breakfast. Other foreigners that we met were checking out early. The staff barely speak English and look terrified when asked anything in English. Tara (f and b) was the nicest member of staff we met. Would only recommend staying here on a low season if cost is right.

msg:The Hilton was a great choice for good value in Yalong Bay! The rooms were spacious, the pools are massive, and there‚Äôs so many things to do on the property from tennis (although a bit expensive), BBQ on the beach, enjoying the private beach, and water slides for both the adults and children. The buffet breakfast is extensive and will find something you like in the morning!

Because this is a friendly-family hotel, there were many children, but the resort is big enough that it‚Äôs not too much of an issue if you‚Äôre a couple and looking for a quieter getaway.

The one thing I wish I knew before booking is the beach was undergoing construction and we weren‚Äôt allowed to swim. We chose Yalong Bay and specifically the Hilton so we could swim in the ocean, but were disappoint to find out it wasn‚Äôt allowed.

Thank you Sunny!! That‚Äôs real customer service. Other than that the hotel was spotless clean and very well maintained. The pool area was awesomely empty and clean.  And the private beach was worth to go there every day.  Breakfast buffet was good and the selection sufficient. Only the dinner prices where a bit overcharged from my point of view but luckily there is always an alternative to in-house dining .  All in all a great hotel with all amenities we needed and wanted.

msg:We stayed at this hotel for two nights before heading back home. Overall, it‚Äôs a great resort, geared towards families with small children. The territory is huge, well designed and taken care of. 
We booked a room with sea view, but what we could see from the room was another hotel, the sea was to our right and was only visible a little bit from the balcony. From what I could see, a garden view room would probably provide a better view. 
The breakfast was quite nice, but the restaurant capacity certainly doesn‚Äôt match the amount of guests the hotel can take. By around 9am there is a huge queue of people waiting outside of the restaurant. So if you don‚Äôt want to wait to eat breakfast, you better come early. The dinner buffets were at different locations around the hotel every night, and in our opinion they weren‚Äôt really worth the price, although the food wasn‚Äôt bad. 
All the pools open at 9am and close at 7pm (except the infinity pool, which is open until later). Despite the huge crowds, it‚Äôs always possible to find a somewhat quiet and private corner. 
The hotel has direct access to the beach, but the water is quite cold. 
We‚Äôre a young couple and we don‚Äôt have any kids, so we aren‚Äôt the target demographic this hotel is geared towards. If you have kids, I think your family will have a fantastic time at this hotel. If you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs still enjoyable as long as you don‚Äôt mind the kids around.

+ Facilities are good, especially the 2 heated pools were amazing during this time of the year.
+ Very good lifeguards at the pool, we saw them in action, impressive.
+ Some good managers who know what customer service means.
+ Excellent concierge service, especially head concierge Jerome Liu went the extra mile to help us several times.
+ Nice little farm with some animals and veggies / fruits growing

-+ Breakfast is nice but too busy and too expensive,  better safe the money and go for √† la carte in the other restaurant.
-+ Beach, it`s part of Yalong bay beach so obviously not secluded. Nice beach but quite busy , intrusive vendors can get on your nerves after a day or 2.
-+ Rooms are good, but can be noisy from the corridors and balconies , if sea facing room and close to the beach you will hear the buffet life music if you want it or not.
-+ Diner buffet service. Good food and big variety but staff poorly trained. What to do when it starts raining during a BBQ buffet? Stare at customers until they leave, I wasn`t aware that is Hilton policy.

- Front desk / reception is very bad. Slow, not welcoming , purely transactional, nervous and overwhelmed if more then 2 customers at the same time. Need an overhaul , proper training and extra resources.
- Water park / playground is closed for renovation.

I was not aware of it and looked for a hotel for teens. The breakfast a was at peak time - too much mass tourism and not enough resources - only one person preparing eggs, only one coffee machine.  It is not nice to start the day with a cue. Last but not least the snacks were below average. I would expect it better of a 5 start hotel that is charging such a premium to food. Therefore we went dining outside after the first experience.

Our recommendations: improve English, set up bar restaurant by the beach, empower the employees to make more decisions. Reduce prices of water sport activities, provide better hotel plan to incoming guests, get rid of the noisy playing machines, why is ur bar in a back-alley with no beach access? Segregate breakfast per hotel pavilions, its too crowded not personal enough, don‚Äòt provide glasses and dishes on almost floor level in the breakfast room, make it more convenient to ur customers,  climatize check-in area, broke out in sweat and most important work on the check-in speed check-in took over one hour for us, totally not acceptable

The breakfast is great, but if you arrive after 8 am you need to be prepared for a long queue. Nevertheless the most guests seemed not to know that the Chinese harvest restaurant has basically the same food. Overall a great hotel

Whilst a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù hotel, the number of staff speaking English was surprisingly low and the attention to detail with the service was lacking at times. It did however make up for this with a variety of outside pools and a lovely stretch of beach.

msg:The hotel has no service at all. It‚Äôs packed with lots of guests and you can barely see around people to assist them.
Let‚Äôs start the review with the CONS:
- water pool temperature too hot, I guess they switched  off the refrigeration
- no service at the beach except tons of private photographers and coconut sellers
- no service at breakfast restaurant, we end up preparing our table by ourselves
- buffet dinner: our 3 nights package included the dinner. 3 buffet dinners, same food every night. Good that we did not stay for 7 days
Actually we saw plenty of employees hanging around the hotel but could not see any manager whom to complain... we guess the real problem is that there is no manager 

PROS:
- playing with the waves at the sea 
- the band playing music during dinner... even if the volume of the music was too loud 

Final comment: this Hotel  calls himself Hilton but it is not.
We will not visit anymore the Hilton Sanya Yalong bay and we don‚Äôt recommend it to other travelers

We arrived on time for check in (around 2 pm) but we were asked to wait an hour for our room. They did give us drink coupons tho so we went to The Big Kitchen restaurant to pass time so we ordered pizza which took another hour to arrive! 

The service of the bar by the pool is the same. Our drinks took literally two hours to arrive! 

Food selection in the breakfast and dinner buffet is great. we always enjoyed the ambiance of the bbq dinner by the beach. Great band too!

May, a staff member of the guest relations department, warmly welcomed me and asked about my needs every morning and evening. She was meticulous üòä; the swimming pools are divided into different areas, suitable for different groups of people to swim. I swam for an hour every night. It was so comfortable! I am used to taking photos when traveling, so I uploaded some photos of different locations in the hotel for your reference. In addition, the hotel has a variety of breakfast ingredients, and the taste caters to different groups of people. The service staff is warm and thoughtful, and the experience is very good.

msg:I was very pleased and satisfied with my stay at Hilton Sanya Yalong Bay. The hotel not only has charming seaside scenery and luxurious facilities, but also the excellent service of employee Fanny, which made me spend an unforgettable time here.

The hotel is located in a prime location in Yalong Bay, with fine sand and blue water. When I stepped into the hotel lobby, I was immediately attracted by its elegant a**osphere. The spacious and comfortable rooms, beautifully decorated and fully equipped, made me feel the warmth of home. Whether it was enjoying the sea view in the room or enjoying the sun on the balcony, it made me feel extremely comfortable.

The hotel's dining options are rich and varied, whether it is a seafood buffet or exquisite √† la carte dishes, I was very satisfied. The chefs in the restaurant showed excellent cooking skills, fresh ingredients and excellent taste. And the enthusiastic recommendation and professional service of employee Fanny made my dining experience even better. Her understanding of the dishes and attention to the needs of guests made me feel the meticulous care.

In addition, the hotel's entertainment facilities also made me linger. The pool, gym and spa facilities were all there for me to relax and enjoy. Fanny was always there to help and advise me to make the most of the facilities.

I was particularly sad to leave the hotel because of Fanny's attentive service and warm hospitality. I was deeply impressed by her professionalism and genuine smile, and I am grateful for Hilton Sanya Yalong Bay. I highly recommend this hotel to all travelers who are looking for a high-quality vacation experience, and I believe you will have an unforgettable time here.

Thanks again to Hilton Sanya Yalong Bay and Fanny, your excellent performance made my trip even more perfect!

Thanks to the lovely May for her service. She took the initiative to pick up the car, accompanied me from check-in to entering the room, and helped me print the test papers for my baby. The check-in process was very relaxing and pleasant.
The bad reviews of Xiaohongshu were too disturbing, which led to a long period of entanglement before booking Hilton. The fact is that it is better to have no "books" than to believe in "books". Many people complained that the facilities were old but I didn't feel it (maybe the poor have little knowledge). I think the hotel facilities and equipment are well maintained. The room layout is reasonable, the swimming pool is clean, the scenery is beautiful, and more sunshade facilities would be better. There are not many parent-child activities in the hotel, which are not attractive to my 6-year-old and 8-year-old sisters, and the paid items are expensive. The swimming ring needs to be rented. 30 yuan an hour is too expensive. Later, I bought the swimming ring for takeout. The waves in the Hilton area are very big and fast, and the beach is not flat, which is not suitable for playing in the water and sand.
In short, choosing Hilton for vacation will not be a thunder

msg:A very good hotel, my first choice every time I come to Sanya. I have also seen luxury hotels around Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay, and I still feel that the Hilton in Yalong Bay has a great advantage! The room layout, hotel environment, and overall swimming pool design are basically unparalleled. It has an exclusive beach, gentle wind and waves, and you can go to the sea at any time. This is the shortcoming of Haitang Bay Hotel. It is very suitable for taking children and the elderly to vacation together. This is my fifth stay. Yes, it feels good every time, it must be a perfect score! The hotel is expensive: it should be the best location in Yalong Bay. There is also a Ritz-Carlton in the deepest area, but the swimming pool cannot be compared with the Hilton. Parking is very convenient, both underground and above ground. Service: Harry is very dedicated. ‚Ä¢ Accommodation is for two persons and four persons. Days, no matter where you need help and communication in any space in the hotel, you will get timely, effective and friendly feedback. Room: Very classic layout, the details still look very good after so many years, the details are also very good, the bed is still the magic of falling asleep, very Love the Hilton bed. Beach: It only takes 2-3 minutes to walk from the room to the beach, which is better than the 8-15 minutes of the Haitang Bay Westin. Pet Farm: There is a black swan couple, a big goose, and a big rooster, which is quite funny. It is next to the gym. All in all, Hilton is great!

msg:I have to praise the housekeeper of Yalong Bay Hilton Hotel. Before my family and I arrived at the hotel, we were deeply impressed by their enthusiasm, warmth and hospitality. The housekeeper Fanny contacted us one day in advance and helped coordinate the room requirements. We were arranged a room on a high floor in advance, with a good view of the sea. We were in a good mood every day when we opened the room to see the sea. The housekeeper learned that we were on our honeymoon, and the room was also decorated for our honeymoon, which was very warm. It rained on the day we arrived at the hotel, but because the room was arranged in advance, we checked in without waiting and it was very smooth.

The room also gave us the Hilton Hotel's Hainan green coconut, which tasted very good, the food delivery service was also very good, and the taste of the restaurant was also very good. It is a hotel worth recommending.

When we met the staff in the hotel, they would greet us enthusiastically, and the experience was great. In the past few days at Hilton, the housekeeper Fanny helped us solve problems at any time. The daily care, recommended itineraries, and chatted about the weather were really like a friend, adding to the feeling of vacation. Hilton Hotel is very lively, and there are many couples staying here. I will choose this hotel as my first choice for my next trip to Sanya. I will also recommend it to my family and friends. Thank you Fanny and the hotel for your attentive service.

The day before check-in, the one-to-one housekeeper Lena came to add WeChat to communicate the precautions for checking in. I also booked a shuttle bus to the duty-free city that day through Lena.
The housekeeper accompanied me to the room all the way. I would like to say that the summer ice drink brewed by the hotel itself is really delicious. Unfortunately, I left early and didn't drink it again. I have to prepare a bucket next time I go and take a bucket back haha.
Room: Not damp and no musty smell. The split-level design separates the bathroom and bedroom very well. There is another sink and toilet at the entrance, which is humanized.
Hotel external activity facilities: Very good parent-child projects, many swimming pools, and circular swimming lanes. Although they are temporarily closed, they are very distinctive. The hotel arranges different parent-child project experiences all day every day, which is very humanized.
Breakfast: The breakfast environment is very spacious, much richer than Wanning Sheraton. The croquettes are taken at will instead of waiting for half a day to be snatched up. There are also guava and pineapple fruits, which are not available at Sheraton. The homemade dragon fruit yogurt is worth a try, very delicious.
The price-performance ratio of the 609 per night room with breakfast booked on Ctrip and upgraded to a sea view room is simply a good place for consumption downgrade. If you come to Sanya again on July 24, Hilton will be your first choice to make up for the regret of this hasty stay.
Thanks again to the housekeeper Lena and every employee of Hilton, a great experience in less than 24 hours!

The sand in Yalong Bay is clean and soft, which is already well known. There are many parent-child activities in the hotel every day, and they are different every day. The indoor children's playground facilities are very new. There are several Ctrip parent-child teachers. I especially praise a young lady with glasses. My baby accidentally fell down. The young lady came over and asked patiently. She also gave a penguin doll to the baby. She would play hide-and-seek with the children in her free time. I was touched ‚ûï1üòÜ. The buffet breakfast is rich and varied, with both Chinese and Western food. The dinner at the Bucket Kingdom is also good, and there are performances. The children like it very much.

I had a great time traveling with my sister's family this time! It was my husband's birthday on the 4th. We went out for breakfast and came back to find that the hotel had decorated it. It was a special surprise, and there was a small cake! Super super happy~
Our flight was on the evening of the 5th, and Cody delayed our check-out to 2 o'clock, allowing us to end the trip very comfortably. I really recommend everyone to stay at Hilton~ I will bring my son to stay again next timeüòä

The service started after booking. The housekeeper communicated by phone in advance, and the check-in was very smooth. The room was also upgraded. Good reviews. Walking on the beach, I happened to meet the beach supervisor Li Zhaoyun who was inspecting. The service was also thoughtful and enthusiastic. Good reviews.
I will continue to stay in Sanya next time I travel.

msg:Hilton is very good, with Asia Cai Xiaoyan, I think it's even better, a caring little housekeeper
It's really very very very good, which made me deeply feel what it means to be responsive
From the check-in, after we finished lunch, she told me that there were a lot of people at the front desk, so I just waited for her on the sofa in the lobby, and she helped me get the card. It was a very good start. I think the temperature change from Shanghai made the children very uncomfortable, but this caring start directly smoothed out the irritability
Later, no matter what I needed, she would respond immediately and give me very pertinent recommendations on where to buy island clothes, where to buy fruits, and where to eat delicious food. And we would share beautiful scenery. I like this kind of interaction and getting along. It doesn't make me feel like a foreign tourist, and even thinks, oh, not bad, I made new friends again.
An inexplicable kind of fate, thank Hilton for letting me meet such a good and good lady.

The children are so happy to play in the water. There are bubble parties by the pool from time to time. The a**osphere is very good. The garden design is also beautiful. There are coconut trees, frangipani trees, large green plants, and large lawns everywhere, which is very suitable for taking pictures. The hotel room is very quiet as a whole, not noisy, so the separation of movement and quiet is done very well. In addition, the hotel's butler service is great, especially JoJo, who almost replies to WeChat contacts in seconds, and the service efficiency is also very high. Recommended to stay!

The courtyard on the first floor of Building 4 where we stayed. There were two mosquitoes occasionally, but after reporting to the housekeeper, the waiter immediately sent wormwood anti-itch spray and electric mosquito coils.
The cleaning aunt was also very kind. Seeing that we had two children, she gave us a lot of water.
Special praise for Miss Wang Qian of Bucket Kingdom and housekeeper Zora, who had a positive service attitude, quick response, and was able to actively solve our problems. The view of the hotel is very good, and the swimming pool and beach are white and fine. The security guard is also very responsible and keeps watching the children.

At noon, I went to the lobby to handle the formalities. There were quite a lot of people and it was quite lively. Xiaolin was waiting for us in the lobby early. We waited for a while in the room. The room was arranged on a high floor, and the sea view was really great. He cared and greeted us every day during the few days of check-in, and kept in touch with us on the day of check-out. I especially thank Xiaolin for his attentiveness and attentive service! ! ! !

The hotel facilities are not many, but enough. There is a bar and drink bar, which is good, and the service is also great! !
The environment is also very good. The hotel has many swimming pools. You don‚Äôt have to worry about being bored in the hotel. It‚Äôs especially good.

After communicating with the guest relations, I was adjusted to room 6516, which could only see a corner. Who even specially arranged a room close to the lobby and the sea for my family! I hope that your hotel can communicate with customers in advance when arranging non-booked room types in the future, so as to avoid changing rooms after arriving! I was tired from the journey, and changing rooms like this is not friendly to the elderly! Attached is a picture of the superior sea view room after the room change, the sea view is really wonderful!

msg:We first stayed in the Marriott's room with an unbeatable sea view next door, and then came to the Hilton. We did some travel guides online in advance, which are very practical for your reference. The Hilton's facilities are not very old, and it has many swimming pools and security guards. It is very suitable for bringing children or adults who can't swim. The Marriott's adult swimming pool is not open, and the Hilton's beach closes a little earlier. I think the Hilton's service is really good, nothing to say. The quality of all the staff is relatively high, and the planning of all aspects of the hotel is also very reasonable. The scenery and room types of this row of hotels seem to be not much different. I was deeply impressed by the Hilton's service, so I chose Hilton again in Wanning. There is not much fun here, but fortunately the Wanning Hilton also has a cinema (I am not a shill, I just think that Marriott's service can't keep up with the hardware facilities). Next time I bring the elderly and children to play, Hilton will be my first choice. In addition, the hamburgers are really delicious

It is particularly worth mentioning that when I needed to check out late, the hotel agreed very readily and actively coordinated, so that I had no worries. The hotel's swimming pool is also very amazing, with clear water and beautiful environment. Swimming here is simply a pleasure. Moreover, you can swim directly in the sea and get in close contact with the sea. This experience is really great!

msg:Hilton Hainan Yalong Bay is a great choice for a vacation! From the moment you check in, you can feel the hospitality of the hotel staff. Their service is meticulous, the concierge service is warm and beautiful, and they take the initiative to help with luggage and open the car door. It makes people feel as comfortable as at home. Fanny, who felt the guest relations before arriving at the hotel, was warm and hospitable, and kept helping us arrange the room. There was also Vergil, the manager who came to the store to receive us in the early morning of the day.

The hotel is in a very advantageous location, with a charming sea view of Yalong Bay. The hotel has a private beach, blue water and warm sunshine, making people feel like they are in heaven.

The rooms are spacious and bright, with elegant and exquisite decoration. The beds are comfortable and soft, allowing people to have a good night's sleep. Each room is equipped with a private balcony, where you can enjoy the charming sea view or hotel garden view. The bedding in the room is particularly clean, neat and comfortable.

The hotel's dining options are rich and varied, whether it is local specialties or international delicacies, they can meet the needs of different tastes. The service in the restaurant is also excellent, making people feel noble and enjoyable during the meal. There is no long queue for breakfast as said on the Internet, and there will be staff to guide.

The hotel's swimming pool and gym facilities are first-class. Swimming in the pool and feeling the embrace of the sun, Hilton Hainan Yalong Bay is an impressive resort.

Many people say that the room facilities are old, but I don‚Äôt think they are old. After all, Yalong Bay is a hotel that has been open for a long time. It is very good to be able to maintain and maintain such high-quality maintenance, which is not as bad as what is said on the Internet.

Whether it is a couple‚Äôs vacation, family travel or business trip, this place can provide a perfect experience. I am already looking forward to my next visit.

The experience was far beyond expectations. The landscaped garden is very beautiful. Walking in the private garden every day feels like being in a tropical rain forest. The parent-child activities were also pretty good. The children played in the sand and participated in bubble parties. They went crazy.

msg:Facilities: The infrastructure is not in place. This is related to the initial hotel design and has nothing to do with the later service facilities. The outdoor swimming pool does not have a dressing and shower space. I personally think this is a standard feature of the hotel. After I went downstairs to the swimming pool with my swimsuit and bathrobe, I could not find a changing room. I was told that there was no changing room and I had to change in the room, so I asked if there was a public restroom. After asking for directions twice (the hotel signage system was defective), I found one male and female bathroom in the side building through the green belt (for a hotel that can accommodate so many tourists, there are only 2 bathrooms in the public area?); In addition, the hotel room you checked into is on the 6th floor. You have to go through two fire doors and a row of extremely airtight guest rooms to reach the passenger elevator. I can't understand this flow of traffic. I asked the staff all kinds of questions. Those who didn't know thought they had to go there. If you go to live in the linen room, you must go through these two doors and the dark and closed guest room space to dine, go outdoors, or go to the lobby, which greatly reduces the experience; the room facilities are mainly "have", don't think about how "excellent" they are. The toiletries and care products are all filled in large bottles, and the disposable products such as slippers and toothbrushes are not customized by the hotel. They seem to be wholesale from a certain supplier. Those who don‚Äôt know better would think that if you stay in an express hotel, the water supply is not zero cold water ( The ordinary hotel I stayed in before and it was renovated for more than 10 years had hot water coming out directly), and it took a while for the water to come out. The most bizarre design is that the bathroom and shower are located on both sides of the room, so I always go to the wrong place ( Usually on the same side), if I want to take a shower, I habitually walk towards the restroom in the dry area. The room is quite large, but the sound insulation is not good, and the sound from the corridor is clearly audible.

Hygiene: Hygiene is good. There was too much traffic at breakfast, and the hotel also set up dining tables and chairs on the terrace. Several guests‚Äô breakfasts were eaten by birds that are not afraid of humans. Kind-hearted tourists reminded us that the food placed here has been eaten by birds and should not be eaten. Although there were two or three service staff outside, they had no time to remind us that when other tourists' food was eaten, the waiter immediately took the plates away when they saw it. It felt like the young lady was confused when she came back and had just taken the food. Where has it gone?

Environment: When checking into a hotel, vehicles drive into the drop-off area, and tourists get off the car and check in at the front desk. However, if tourists walk out of the hotel to go to the surrounding areas during their stay, they have to walk through a long vehicle passage, and there is no separation of people and vehicles. There is a bit of a safety hazard. There are private cars parked on both sides of the drop-off. The experience is very bad, and it feels like you are rushing to catch a train. The lobby space is extremely beautifully designed, but the interior space is a bit vulgar. For example, the pillars in the backyard public area are directly concreted and sandblasted on the outer surface. Some bottoms are directly exposed to cement. The bricks are too lazy to be pasted. The construction party probably cut corners and only left It's all appearance. The swimming pool is much smaller than expected. There is only 1 deeper water and a shallow water area with a lot of children. The water quality is average and far less clear than the hotels I have stayed in before. I wonder if this can be explained by the large number of people or the lack of toilets in the public area. Caused. The beach is said to be public to the public. I don't know how the hotel controls people outside the hotel from entering the hotel through the public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel. There is no card.

Service: I called customer service before checking in and asked to add their housekeeper as a WeChat friend. After the call, no one added me. Just pick up the airport and not drop it off. I was told that the drop-off service is expensive and it is recommended to go by yourself. When we arrived at the hotel to check in, the staff first helped us take our luggage out of the trunk. When we said we could take the luggage ourselves, the staff said they could just take it, and then lined up to check in. Looking back, we saw that the luggage had been placed in a big row. Li is in the middle. There was a queue for check-in. The first two guests checked in and the waiting time was 15-20 minutes. What Ctrip charged was not the room fee but the deposit. The hotel charged 2,000 yuan for the room fee and deposit. After check-out, the hotel first refunded the deposit, and Ctrip then charged The security deposit equal to the room fee will be refunded. The process is long and cumbersome and it is recommended to simplify it. The front desk asked me if I had added the butler on WeChat. I told him that he had not added me and asked me to scan the QR code to add it. The butler uses private WeChat instead of corporate WeChat, with private avatars and private posts in Moments. I feel that Hilton‚Äôs butler service is well-intentioned, but it is unprofessional and unsystematic, which makes me a little uncomfortable. The housekeeper is very considerate and considerate. He keeps asking me if I need anything. On average, he sends a message every hour. From check-in to the afternoon after check-out, if I reply "Okay, thank you" or "Nothing else, thank you", the housekeeper seems to respond. I felt that what I was doing was lacking, and I kept asking if I needed anything. I really don‚Äôt have any need anymore. I‚Äôm here for vacation, not for chatting. If I need it, I will consult the hotel myself. There is a service hotline and a front desk. I don‚Äôt have to take a lunch break, take a shower, swim, eat, before going to bed, or get up. I received messages during the meal asking me if I needed help. I thanked the housekeeper for his enthusiastic help. I know that the staff just obeyed the instructions and worked hard. Thank you for your hard work. The problem is definitely not with the individual, but with the hotel's management and marketing strategy. Breakfast is at its peak time between 9 and 10 o'clock, so you need to queue up to enter. Check-out was quick, there was no queue, the lady was very nice and the check-out was completed in half a minute.

Overall experience: It may be a popular hotel, but it is still like this in the non-holiday tourist off-season in winter. I personally don‚Äôt like the crowds and bustle, so the experience is average. I wonder if the hotel can really handle it when there are so many people in the peak season? It is more suitable for parents and children. There are many facilities specially designed for children. For couples, the experience is average. There are too many people. It is not like they are here for vacation as imagined, but like they are here to "fight".

It meets the needs of different age groups. Children have a lot of fun playing in the water, sand and playground. The beach directly connected to the hotel is a 5-minute walk away. Deck chairs and sand digging tools are provided free of charge. Elders can take photos in the garden, and there is a view every ten steps. The five free photos of Platinum Travel Photography are a great experience
Afternoon tea is provided in the room. When you are tired from playing, you can have a small cake, look at the beautiful scenery, and enjoy the sea breeze. It is so comfortable!
Overall, I felt that it was not tiring to take the whole family to play with the whole family, and they were all happy.

This time I stayed in a sea view room. The room is spacious and comfortable, with complete facilities, especially the soft and comfortable bedding, which makes people reluctant to leave once they lie down.
Service: The five-star service standard can be felt from the moment you enter the door. Hotel staff Fanny Xiaolin is warm and thoughtful.

Watching performances here at night, you can not only enjoy wonderful performances, but also beautiful sea views. It is really a pleasure.

Sea: The sea in Sanya is my favorite part. The sea water here is clear and transparent, and the beach is delicate and soft. Swimming, surfing, and playing in the sand here are all good choices. Especially in the evening, watching the sunset and listening to the sound of the waves makes people feel extremely relaxed and happy
Children's activities: The hotel has prepared a wealth of children's activities for children, including various parent-child games, handicrafts, parent-child lectures, etc. Here, children can play to their heart's content and parents can relax. In addition, the hotel also has a children's swimming pool and a children's playground. It is definitely a good choice to spend a pleasant holiday here!

msg:The last time I stayed at the Hilton Hotel was in 2017, and the hotel environment was great. So I chose to stay in one of the hotels during this ten-day family trip to Sanya, but the check-in experience was very disappointing... First of all, when I checked in at the front desk, the receptionist had a cold attitude and asked you to sign this document and that document. In short, it was just a few Disclaimers include fraud prevention disclaimers, etc. Then the front desk asked the guests to actively add the housekeeper's WeChat account. I don't know what kind of manipulation it was. Secondly, the overall hygienic condition of the guest room was not good. The bed sheets were wet and smelly. The children also had a lot of rashes on their bodies. The sink was leaking and the master came to repair it. It can be used after 20 minutes. There are no children's toiletries and slippers in the room. I asked the cleaning lady and she said that they were put there after the guests requested them because they didn't know if there were children living with them. Okay, so what does the information at the front desk check in with? Regarding catering, the hotel's beach buffet dinner environment is dirty and messy. The ingredients are placed in the open air and there are many mosquitoes and flies. The variety of ingredients is quite small, which is seriously inconsistent with the content promoted in the advertisement. The only soft drinks are Sprite, Coke and orange juice. It feels like being tricked. There is a shortage of service staff in the restaurant during breakfast. No one has cleared the tables after breakfast, resulting in a long queue outside the restaurant. There are many tables in the restaurant that are in a mess and no one has cleaned them up. In short, the hotel service is seriously lacking and I hope it can be improved as soon as possible.

The swimming pool, beach, lawn and room are full of vacation and leisure style. Sanya is a good place to relax. You can feel the charm of the rich coastal tourist city, the tropical climate of Sanya, and the brand concept of Hilton's warm hospitality. Sanya is very good, very good, and super good. Hilton Hotel is very good, very good, and Asia Cai Xiaoyan is very good, very good, and super good.

msg:We checked into Yalong Bay Hilton from April 7th. There were many surprises during the stay. For example, there are many cartoon elements in the hotel, which is very suitable for family travel. The swimming pool is also very beautiful. We made an appoin**ent for travel photography one day in advance, and the overall effect was good.
The hotel facilities are very complete, and the family room is also very spacious. Children's toiletries and small tents are provided in the room.
We stayed in Building 2, which is close to the lobby of Building 5. There are some ducks and birds next to the fitness center on the north side, which is a new discovery in the hotel.
My favorite is the hotel's infinity pool, which is 1.5 meters deep and is one of the hotel's 8 swimming pools.
At the same time, I would like to thank Asia Cai Xiaoyan, the hotel's guest service center, for her warm reception. In addition, the hotel staff also provided very thoughtful services and provided a lot of help during the stay and when leaving the hotel.
In short, I will stay in Yalong Bay Hilton next time I have the opportunity. It's really goodüëç

|Hilton should be an irresistible destination in Yalong Bay. There are three reasons for choosing this place.
1 | 1. Located at the core of Yalong Bay, the nearby Internet celebrity spots include Sun Bay Highway, Yalong Bay Tropical Forest Park, and Baihua Valley Commercial Plaza.
Moreover, the hotel also has exclusive beach chairs, allowing you to waste time as much as you want.
2| 2. Rich Southeast Asian style, a large number of coconut trees and large seaside lawns, the fairies can do all kinds of patting, even lying down leisurely is very comfortable.
3| 3. Inside the hotel are luxurious swimming pools of different shapes connected to the sea and the sky, and a water children's paradise. In addition to the indoor play area, children can play all day long.
4. You can see the outdoor garden when you look up when you live there. The scenery is beautiful.
5. Before my family and I checked into the hotel, a specialist contacted me, communicated in advance, and arranged a series of things for us. Fanny was very attentive and waited for our arrival in the lobby, and sent us back to the room for introduction, including steps in advance. They gave us some help and were very proactive in following up and coordinating when we changed rooms the next day, etc.

The first impression was that the staff I met were very enthusiastic and proactive in service, and the scenery in the hotel lobby was particularly beautiful.
Then the room was large, well-planned, and well-decorated. It didn't feel like an old hotel. There was a large bathtub, and the balcony could see the garden and swimming pool in the hotel.
The hotel has an indoor and outdoor children's play area, and various activities are arranged every day, so it is particularly suitable for parent-child family outings.
There are many lounge chairs on the beach, so there is no place to sit, and the service is also very good. My son was standing on the beach and was wet all over by a sudden wave. The staff next to him immediately sent a bath towel. The buffet dinner on the beach has a good a**osphere, especially beautiful memories.
The hotel also has various deep and shallow swimming pools. The children have been swimming for a few days and are about to learn to swim.
In terms of catering, there are several restaurants in the hotel, which is very convenient for eating and ordering takeout.
The hotel staff fanny asks about the well-being every day and responds to every request. Thank you very much!

Especially the sea view hotels in Yalong Bay, and rooms are in demand. I booked an elegant room for 1,850 yuan. To put it bluntly, you can't see the sea from the back, you can only see the mountain view. The room facilities are old, but it's understandable. After all, the hotel has been there for many years, but the environment is very clean. The hotel service is excellent and responsive to all requests. The sales staff contacted me in advance and prepared special slippers and toiletries for the children. They were very considerate. They also gave me a small fruit plate (although there were only four fruits, but the important thing is the sense of ceremony, which is less about etiquette and more about affection. Well). The breakfast is also very good, with a rich variety of food options. The swimming pool is so awesome, it is very suitable for children to play with. There are seven or eight swimming pools of various sizes and various depths. This is much better than the Ritz-Carlton next door, whose swimming pool is too small. The hotel has various parent-child activities during the day, and you can take your children to participate. There is also a live music party on the beach at night. It is so comfortable to sit on the beach and listen to music with the sea breeze. Five-star hotels are expensive for a reason. really not bad

The common problem in the hotels I stayed in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay is that the service staff can't keep up.

Due to the large number of rooms and guests, the service can't keep up quickly. This is understandable. For example, it takes a long time to deliver some things and the room cleaning is also slow to check in. It may take until four or five o'clock, but these situations will not occur in Hilton.

Efficient and fast This time, whether from the room or the front desk, and the reception at the door are first-class, all aspects reflect the thoughtfulness of Hilton butler Fanny. The whole family is very satisfied.

The decoration of the hotel and the room is not old, and the bathtub is also very large. Breakfast is complete with Chinese and Western food. There are many deep and shallow areas in the swimming pool, large and small, to meet the needs of swimming in hot weather and children playing in the water. You can also play with dye boards in the swimming pool.
There is a beach in front of the hotel, and you can also have a barbecue on the beach. A little bit in front is the sea. You can blow the sea breeze on the beach, look at the sea, and take the children to dig sand. The lawn next to it is very photogenic. I took a personal travel photo, which is very photogenic.
Harry's service attitude is also very good, very thoughtful, and everything is arranged clearly in advance.
Sister Zhang of the guest room works seriously and meticulously, and the room is cleaned very cleanly as required.

Hotel facilities: Although it has been open for a few years, it is well maintained and the interior decoration style is very durable. Although I booked a sea view room that is not facing directly, it is highly recommended. The unobstructed view of the swimming pool area and the sea view in the distance is super great.
Swimming pool series: I recommend the central infinity pool omg, which faces the coastline. I can soak in it all day without getting tired of it.
Service reception: The personal butler Jojo's service is super considerate. He called us one day in advance, arrived to pick up luggage, showed the room, and also provided thoughtful fruits. I received considerate greetings, reminders and services at almost every moment. The service of the old resort hotel gave me a new understanding.

The receptionist said that it would be a panoramic or luxurious room. Because there was no room at the time, I could only book a superior sea view room. I wonder if the employees here look down on those with high-end sea views? Later, I thought about it. I went back to the room at night and found that the balcony could not be closed. I called the front desk to arrange for the maintenance depar**ent to come and close the balcony door. In the middle of the night, the house was full of insects, and every hand was full of bugs. The housekeeper said they would provide mosquito repellent, but the manager called again and asked to change the room and upgrade it to a panoramic view. Of course, because it was very late and the sheets had already been laid out, so I didn‚Äôt want to bother, so I just left it alone. The most outrageous thing is that they said they would provide afternoon tea. Because we were going to a duty-free shop, we were not given anything. We were told that we would be given fruits and minibars, but they were not given to us because we were not in the room at the time. We were told that they would not be given in the evening. We stayed for 3 days and 2 nights, but we did not see any of the things we were told to give. It was a lie. ?

The hotel has a private garden with very clear water. There is also an artificial white sand beach, which is suitable for taking photos and checking in. The courtyard has direct access to the beach and is open, which means you can go to the hotel next door to compare which one is better. The waves on the beach are quite strong and the slope drops quickly. I personally think it is not suitable for getting into the water.

msg:It was the first time we brought the whole family to Sanya. We hoped to choose a room with direct access to the swimming pool on the first floor and enough entertainment items for children. Before coming, we carefully compared many hotels in Sanya online and finally chose to stay at the Yalong Bay Hilton for three days.

facility:
The first floor of the room I stayed in this time is directly connected to the swimming pool room. The balcony can easily go down to the public swimming pool. There is a swimming area outside that only belongs to this type of room, which is very convenient for children to go directly into the water. The temperature in Sanya these days is around 28. You can swim in the normal temperature swimming pool, but it gets very cold in the evening. The hotel also has a constant temperature swimming pool, but we didn't have time to experience it.

In my opinion, the hotel's children's facilities are quite complete. There are various activities in the children's playground throughout the day. The reception staff are also very good and will patiently answer questions. We specially booked dinner for one day at the hotel's parent-child restaurant "Bucket Kingdom", which also has amusement facilities and interactive acrobatic performances. Yaomei had a lot of fun in it.

Whispering balcony breakfast upgrade coupon:
Because we were staying during the winter vacation, the hotel was full, and breakfast crowds were unavoidable. On the first two days, we arrived at the breakfast room before 8:30 to avoid queuing. On the last day, I booked breakfast on the balcony of the room so that the children could enjoy it. They took a nap.

Serve:
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs service. Before checking in, the hotel called me to confirm many check-in details and added the WeChat account of Asia, the hotel‚Äôs butler. Asia must be highly praised here because her presence made our three-day stay possible. Become a very unforgettable experience.

First of all, Asia was able to respond very efficiently to all kinds of questions and needs I raised on WeChat, including but not limited to room layout, needs for various supplies, event catering reservations, etc. For a family trip like ours, two adults and two children, we really need a hotel housekeeper like Asia who is attentive, thoughtful and patient, who can lighten a lot of the burden of the trip. Thanks again to Asia for her service. The two children were reluctant to leave the hotel on the last day.

The room was spacious and bright, with advanced facilities and comfortable bedding, which made me feel like I was at home. The hotel is in a very good location, with beautiful surroundings and convenient transportation. The service attitude is full of praise. Harry, the young butler, is warm and considerate, which makes me feel more friendly. The entertainment and leisure facilities in the hotel are rich and diverse, whether it is fitness, swimming or SPA, they can meet my needs. The food in the restaurant is also a highlight. There are all kinds of food in all kinds of flavors, which made me a full meal. All in all, I had a very pleasant stay this time and will choose here again next time. The full sea view room is really great! It's very close to the beach. You can spend a whole day just sitting on the balcony and watching the sea! The reserved room is really awesome.

During my three-day stay, I received warm greetings from CiCi every day, asking about my stay experience, whether I had a good rest, recommendations for nearby dining and entertainment, and help with reservations for children's activities in the hotel. Any problems were solved in a timely manner, which can be said to be meticulous. The hotel environment is great. Children have a lot of fun in multiple swimming pools. There is also a heated swimming pool. The provided paddle boards are very fun. The beach is particularly delicate and the water is clear. The room design and layout are great. The balcony leads to the swimming pool, and the room is equipped with a dehumidifier. The breakfast is rich, the same in both restaurants, and the quality is very high. This is a very unforgettable vacation experience. I hope to stay at the Yalong Bay Hilton next time!

msg:Generally speaking, my stay this time was okay, but I personally think Hilton is not suitable for couples to travel. We booked 8 full sea view rooms during the Spring Festival. The sea view is really amazing. The housekeeper added WeChat in advance and we wanted to go to the 4th floor, which also met our needs. The order was pretty good. When I entered the hotel, the boy took the initiative to take my luggage. It was much better than the Sofitel Lee and Man where I stayed last time. Except for the Ritz, which has a similar sea view room type, there is no other hotel in this area. But I want to complain 1. The hotel room facilities are old. It's acceptable, but I don't know if the roof of the room is moldy or black and hasn't been cleaned. I can't accept it. I feel a little wronged. 2 The breakfast in the hotel is terrible. The dining environment is noisy. The music played during the Spring Festival is very low and the music in the supermarket is the same. I will go to Lili in the next few days. The breakfast I wanted to eat 3 From 6pm to 9pm, there is a beach buffet on the right side of this room type. The singers were not very good and their voices broke. On the first day and the second day of my stay, when the singers were not singing, they played music like the Spring Festival supermarket. I'm so scared. If you want to listen to the sound of the waves, don't even think about it. I've been going to the Ritz to eat at the beach BBQ these days. The experience is completely different. 4 Although there are many swimming pools in the hotel, there is only a small one with a temperature of 1m deep. It is full of children and adults. How to find other swimming pools during the Spring Festival? It will be too cold to swim in. The Ritz next to it is a 1.2 constant temperature swimming pool that is twice as big as this one. 5. The welcome mentioned when checking in was actually the towels on the bed wrapped in mouse-like shapes. It was better than the Kangnian where I stayed before. The towels are wrapped into swans. This is really a bit petty. All in all, if you are just going to stay in the room every day and watch the sea view (excluding the time period from 6 to 9 pm) and don‚Äôt mind the mold on the roof of the room, you can choose this hotel. Otherwise, I think you can choose Marriott or Marriott at the same price. The Ritz basic room experience will be better or I can't book all the rooms in my itinerary. I couldn't cancel even for three nights this time. I don't recommend it to couples and young people. It's not conducive to the development of relationships.

Then at four o'clock in the afternoon, a new guest arrived but it hadn't been cleaned yet. When I came down to change rooms, I heard that two ladies were given the third floor. , the floor that was not cleaned at the beginning, was it cleaned so quickly? Or give someone a room? The service is basically unremarkable. There are long queues for breakfast. When I stayed at Haitang Bay Shangri-La, my children's breakfast was free. The breakfast here is not good. I have to pay for everything. If it weren't for the beach of Yalong Bay, I wouldn't know it. Consider moving in. There are relatively few people on the beach in front of the hotel, and there are also beach chairs used by Internet celebrities to take photos. There are many people in the constant-temperature swimming pool, and the internal scenery is very good. However, the hotel facilities are relatively old and the usage rate is too high due to the large number of people.

It is just because of the weather that the water feels a bit cold. Thank you to the hotel waiter Harry for taking care of me throughout the process and providing free extra beds and fruits.

msg:I booked two deluxe rooms. After I checked in, I found out that they were in the dark side and slightly humid. The price difference between the deluxe room and the sea view room was almost zero. It should not be difficult to upgrade. None of the two rooms in my room were upgraded, and there was another one. The uncle has booked three rooms, but they are all on the negative side. I suggest you confirm them before checking in.
The photos of Hilton's rooms are real shots. The interior is designed like a sunken garden and has a large dining table where you can dine and work in the room. The decoration is relatively old-fashioned and the hygiene is good.
The beautiful lady Moon who received us gave us fruits on the first day. It would be better if you could contact the reception in advance before checking in.
Our family is very satisfied with the environment here. All the staff greet us with smiles and greetings. Their smiles and greetings are sincere.
The Ritz-Carlton and Hilton next door are the same. Next time, consider switching to the next door to experience it.
In short, it's okay to choose Hilton, and it won't be a big mistake.

But the door sucker broke off on the first day, it was too old. Cody helped us change rooms the next day and prepared everything. However, it was too noisy at the beach at night. There were people singing there at 10 o'clock in the evening. In addition, the air conditioner in the new room usually turned on at 24 degrees Celsius. It was so rumbling. It‚Äôs so noisy that I wake up in the middle of the night. It‚Äôs hot in the bedroom even if I turn it on at 25 degrees Celsius. The air conditioner is not big enough. [Huge face] I don‚Äôt like the color of the cabinet on the left. It‚Äôs very depressing and dark. It‚Äôs a bit scary to sleep alone. When two people sleep together, it‚Äôs noisy and makes it difficult to sleep! I bought eye drops directly from takeaway this morning! Cody also promptly arranged a late check-out. Overall, the hotel was too old and lacked maintenance! Cody's service exceeded expectations and could perfectly cover these flaws. Five-star praise!

In the afternoon, the sun was strong and I didn‚Äôt go out, so I ate French fries and chicken wings with foreign wine on the balcony, playing with my mobile phone and living in a leisurely way. It was quite comfortable. On the first day of my stay, I made a birthday decoration and sent a cake (made by the hotel chef, it tasted pretty good). I gave it a thumbs up and thanked the housekeeper for the thoughtful arrangement.
The hotel swimming pool is very beautiful and the water quality is very clean. It is equipped with 20 lifeguards and is very safety-conscious. The sand on the beach is still rough and coral sand (the fineness is better than that on the intercontinental side, and the beach is larger). You can wear shoes for a walk and lie down on the beach chairs. Due to the orientation, you can't see the sunset on the seaside, but you can see the sunset. The only negative comment is the breakfast. You have to queue up to have breakfast. I have never tried this after staying in so many hotels. If you arrive at 10 a.m. on Friday and 9:30 on Saturday, you have to stand at the door and wait for a table. There was an empty seat, but the waiter was slow to clear it up and didn't close the table in time. In this regard, the experience is really bad.

msg:The front desk clerk didn't understand what he was saying, and kept insisting that tickets booked by Ctrip could not enjoy membership benefits. He had already told him that he didn't care about hotel points, but he was still nagging that only orders placed on the hotel's official website and ** were valued. Only then can I upgrade, only then can I... I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm thinking about. Frankly speaking, the Marriott hotels in Sanya are better. Maybe it‚Äôs a big deal that there is only one Hilton in Sanya, not a Hampton. I asked for a latex pillow, but what I got was actually for a child; the bags in the room were so dirty that I didn‚Äôt dare to use them; isn‚Äôt it a basic requirement to provide good service?

They contacted us in advance and arranged a room (6416) facing the garden pool. The view was very nice and they also arranged for us to check in early. Thank you very much. The swimming pools and beaches are very good. There are several swimming pools and there are few people. The package I ordered includes the Variety Sheep Family Package, which is very healthy and suitable for children. It is enough for a family of three. I will bring my children here next time.

However, the handling was very good. I helped change the children's room the next day and gave them some coupons. My attitude was great. Very good. The hotel's constant-temperature swimming pool is quite warm and suitable for small children. The water quality of the large swimming pool is very good. The various activities and children's playground are also very good. The children's meals in the Bucket Kingdom are very good for the environment. Finally, I would like to thank the manager Fanny for helping me handle the check-out issue and being very nice in allowing me to delay check-out so that my children could take a nap.

It is close to the beach. The garden and swimming pool in the hotel are very beautiful, very photogenic, and there is a constant temperature swimming pool. Very suitable for children to play in the water. When I checked in, the front desk asked me to use the customer service WeChat account. From the room I checked in to all kinds of reservations, I could contact the customer service, and everything would be resolved in time. My customer service Lora was very considerate. My child, who is over two years old, was afraid of falling out of bed when sleeping. She let her know The room attendant brought me a bed rail. An incident occurred during my stay. I had gastroenteritis and asked customer service if there was a hospital. Later, they called me twice to care about me and asked me if I needed a car to take me to the hospital. Fortunately, it turned out later. I'm fine after taking medicine! Overall, I am very satisfied and will choose here again next time I come!

Hygiene: The cleaning staff has a good attitude and the cleaning is very professional. Sanya is very clean and there is no dust on the floor.
Facilities: This point needs to be admitted. The facilities are a bit old. It may be due to the corrosive climate on the seaside. When I booked the hotel, I saw that it was an 18-year-old hotel. When I came in, I found that the overall design and age seemed to be 10 or 15 years old. The above configuration is quite disappointing.
Environment: The resort's own swimming pool and beach are very good, but I blame my choice. The pool room is expensive and biased, and it has no connection with other large swimming pools. It is a failure. I advise you to avoid the pool room option as much as possible.
Breakfast was in the Western restaurant, but there was no table service. It felt a bit messy. The chefs were very serious, like the master chefs in the school cafeteria... The service staff were pretty good and they sorted things out very quickly.
The service staff of the children's playground are more serious and the activities are arranged in an orderly manner.
You must go swimming on the beach. Although the stones are a bit prickly, the feeling in the sea is great. The water in Yalong Bay is also clean, but you must use sun protection.
Minibar on the first day: average, just four bottles of drinks.

msg:Drive all the way from Haikou to Sanya. Last stop is the Hilton. It's not okay to deduct points and give it to sand. Why is it so thick? The hotel does not have an indoor swimming pool. In late November, after the sun went down, it was only around 20 degrees Celsius. It was cold and windy. I insisted on arranging a buffet by the beach. I didn‚Äôt understand. I don't like these two points very much. The hotel room is quite good, the family room is 100% perfect, the bed is very comfortable, and I like that there are a lot of countertops to put things on. Two sinks. The children were very happy, and the waiters were very service-minded. Zhou Xiaona folded towels and animals for the two children. We asked for disposable bathtub covers and the two kids played in the water. The welcome fruit only had one banana, and two kids fought over it. I asked the housekeeper if there were more, and he gave me a few more. We were given several bottles of drinks, but we asked not to return them to the little brother. The little brother refused to accept them and said that you should keep them in the room.

Let me complain about the buffet in the evening. It was actually on the beach. At the end of November, the temperature had dropped at night, and the sea breeze was rustling. Do you want to eat sand? I feel sorry for the waiter who has to carry so many things to the beach. Later we ordered takeout. My son wanted to eat pizza, so he went to the Bucket Kingdom and bought a pizza. He also played with the clown and got a balloon.

Breakfast is in the Western restaurant, and there is a queue during the morning rush hour. Later, a Chinese restaurant opened opposite, but the waiter said the dishes would be smaller. The breakfast dishes are very good and rich. At nine o'clock, the children on White Beach were playing with bubbles at the door and were very happy.

They asked me if I had any needs every morning during my stay. It really felt like I was in China. The best service ever! Because our flight arrived late, they have been helping to reserve it. The view of room 1710 arranged in advance should be one of the best, and the room is also very convenient for going to the beach! The passenger flow has been relatively high recently, so you need to go there early for breakfast. The quality of the breakfast products is also very good, and the bread is delicious. The beach buffet and camping barbecue in the evening are also great, and there are resident singers, which makes the a**osphere full! Overall worth recommending!

msg:The room was booked last minute but far exceeded expectations. The service, scenery, food, etc. were all very good, and I finally decided to stay another day.
Once we arrived at the front desk to check in, Ms. Fanny Lin and the front desk team were very nice. She sent us back to the room, introduced the room and hotel restaurants, and also made a warm decoration for the room when we were out. I have been following up and providing services for the past few days since I checked in. The service is very enthusiastic and in place, and everyone is very attentive and attentive. Also, when checking out. The guy at the front desk also gave us a ride in a battery car, which was a big thumbs up. Next, I want to talk about how to play in the hotel.

Overall feeling: The hotel is close to the Ritz, which can be understood as a smaller version of 80% of the Ritz. Some Ritz and Hilton hotels are available. In comparison, the price/performance ratio is extremely high. For a five-star hotel, the hotel is well maintained (but the decoration style is a bit old) and maintains the quality of Hilton. The park is really beautiful, even more beautiful than what can be captured with a camera. The lobby is also beautiful. There are swimming pools, beaches, lawns, beaches, starry sky, tennis courts, spas, and beach bbqs. It‚Äôs really great for taking photos. In fact, there are more photo scenes than the Ritz.

Recommendation: Be sure to stay in a sea view room. Because the bathtub faces the sea view, soaking in the bathtub is really refreshing. Also, the sea view rooms have balconies. It‚Äôs really beautiful to have breakfast and lunch facing the balcony. For couples, the playability is much higher.
Suggestion 2: You can book a bbq buffet dinner on the beach. There are grilled oysters, shrimps, steaks, etc., you can eat whatever you want. My personal experience is very good. The young lady can sing English songs very well and the a**osphere is full. And the taste of the products is in line with the taste of our Cantonese people. It is said that it is cheaper to book a seat on a certain group.
Suggestion three: I strongly recommend girls to buy a beautiful skirt or swimsuit for taking photos. In addition, the beach is very beautiful, suitable for couples to walk and take photos. The hotel also provides several photo shooting scenes near the beach, which is okay. There is also a swimming pool, which is very impressive. The photographer at the store suggested taking pictures at 3pm. I personally feel that the lighting in the entire swimming pool area is really good at 3pm. The park is very bright and beautiful. But later around 5pm, the light is poor, with a lot of setting sun or shadows. It feels so-so. I went to take the photo at 9 o'clock in the morning. The photos and the light were beautiful.
Suggestion 4: The hotel photo shop will give you 5 photos. I initially wanted to insist on 5 photos and not add additional photos. But after seeing the photos taken by the photographer, I will be really amazed and I really can't control myself from buying the photos! If you have the budget, you can actually buy it, just remember to bargain. In addition, I feel that the photographers in the hotel photography shop are better at producing pictures than the photographers hired from outside (I tried both). After all, they shoot every day, and they all have advantages in photo location/posture/composition/light and shadow.


Will continue to stay next time. If the service level this time can be maintained, I highly recommend it.

The butler's service is also very considerate and surprising. Not only did he upgrade us to a full sea view room for free, but he also gave us an extra bed for three of us for free. The full sea view room really makes it possible to reach the beach right from the balcony. The feeling of getting up facing the sea is so wonderful that it is indescribable.

All in all, my experience at the Hilton this time was really great. Not only the design of the hotel, but also the meticulous service of the staff. Even if I walked in the hotel in the middle of the night, I still felt safe. I think I will still do it next time I come to Yalong Bay. Choose here.

It is the only three-bedroom villa in the hotel. It is a stand-alone design. It is close to the beach and has a large lawn. The environment is very good. unique! The handsome butler Wu Liguo was very enthusiastic in his service. The room was not clean when he arrived, so he immediately arranged an afternoon tea break.

Special thanks to Harry from Guest Relations for the arrangement.

There is a black swan at the entrance of the hotel spa, and the taste of Fengyuan is worthy of its name.
To sum up, the hotel environment is good, the service is great, and the food is delicious.
PS: The breakfast on the balcony should be arranged as early as possible, otherwise it will be too hot to eat. We wanted to sleep in, so we made a reservation at 8 o'clock. After taking photos, we retreated to the room and enjoyed it.

I originally planned to take a day to go to Atlantis, but in the end I didn‚Äôt go, because the hotel only meets the entertainment needs of five-year-old children, so it is right to choose this place when bringing children to play.
I stayed in Deluxe Sea View Room 1514. The room has a beautiful view and complete facilities. The swimming pool is partitioned, very clean and open until 10pm. The beach of the hotel is also very close, and the sand is very fine. Children who like to dig in the sand must not miss it. The food at the hotel is also very good, and the Hilton's buffet will not disappoint.
The most commendable thing is the service. The housekeeper is extremely considerate and really shows meticulous care.
Because this time period is the off-season, the price/performance ratio is super high. Hilton is very good, will come again next time.

Although the facilities are relatively old, the room is very clean and the service is relatively good. The breakfast variety is sufficient. After all, it is a breakfast.

Service: Equipped with exclusive butler service, I think it is still okay. The biggest service this time was the lifeguard Ji Sungjun by the swimming pool. He watched us swimming poorly and came down after work to guide us on our swimming movements for free. This should be the most impressive experience I have had in a hotel so far. Something worth givingüíØ.

Disadvantages: I think the breakfast is not delicious, there is nothing. I don‚Äôt know how the check-out procedure works internally. A few hours after handing over the room card, they called us to ask if we had checked out. The system showed that we had not checked out yet. When I checked into the next hotel, I found out that the system hadn't been reset yet, so I couldn't check into the next hotel. I called again to ask for a refund, which was a bit speechless.

In short, the faults outweigh the faults. Hilton is worthy of five-star standards in terms of location, environmental facilities and services. The price-performance ratio is also good. It is the first choice when visiting Yalong Bay.

The whole-house animation family room experience is really poor, the garden The view is beautiful and the swimming pool is clean and beautiful). Unfortunately, I was also infected. I had four bumps on my right leg and one bump on my left face. I don‚Äôt know if it was due to insect bites on the bed or an allergy due to uncleanliness. It was extremely itchy and it has still not gone away after five or six days. The children's playground is also very average. It happened to be rainy and the weather was bad during the few days we went there. There was no place for the children to play. When we went to the children's club, we found that it was closed (it closed at 8 pm). We decided to stay next door the next day and it was 9 pm The difference is already reflected) I will never stay here again. Speaking of service, the feedback was quite timely, and I was given a brand new set of sand digging tools. No one contacted me about the scheduled travel photography. The overall experience can only be said to be uncompetitive in a market where hotels like Sanya are extremely involution.

It is suitable for a family vacation. It's a pity that the wind and waves were too strong these two days to go to the sea. The sea here feels cleaner than Haitang Bay, the color of the jelly sea. When I checked in at the lobby, the account manager Wu Liguo also provided very good service. He recommended various hotels and nearby eating, drinking and entertainment activities. He also helped solve any problems as soon as possible and gave us welcome fruits and various drinks. There is also room service Su Hongmei. The service is enthusiastic and she even got a welcome gift. Come back next time!

We stayed in one hotel for seven days and six nights. It was very convenient and had a dedicated account manager service. Thanks to Wu Liguo, our guest relations manager, for introducing us to some places to go around and taking care of our needs. We came to Sanya to stay in Yalong Bay. It‚Äôs the most suitable. It‚Äôs not too far away from any tourist attractions. I‚Äôll definitely come to the Hilton next time I come. It‚Äôs a very good experience~

The scenery of the hotel is beautiful, and the main focus is the scenery and design of the park. It is really a clever combination of gardens and swimming pools.
Cody from the guest relations depar**ent is also meticulous, considerate and enthusiastic.

The only drawback is that you have to be careful about tripping on the steps by the balcony!

I have compared many parent-child hotels in Yalong Bay. What attracts me the most is the children's playground in the hotel. There are super rich activities, enough for children to play all day. The key is free, especially the children's favorite sandwiches, rice balls, fruit smoothies, etc. Every time a bunch of kids come over. Everyone made it by themselves, and it was delicious. There are also bubble parties, water parks, magic shows, full of activities every day, and they are not repeated.
This time we stayed, we were two adults and two children. The hotel specially upgraded the room type and added a small bed for free. The bathtub in the room is huge, right next to the balcony. When it was too hot to go out at noon, the two children took a bath in the room and looked at the swimming pool and the sea outside.
There are several swimming pools, both deep and shallow. Babies and professional swimmers can have their own suitable swimming pools. There are a lot of staff by the pool, and they will remind guests to pay attention to safety in time, so they are safe in terms of safety.
The two children had a great time in the hotel, and they couldn't enjoy the fun activities, and they didn't leave the hotel for a few days. Sitting in the hotel lobby watching the sea breeze and drinking juice is also extremely enjoyable.

I didn‚Äôt see a book or a voice recommending this hotel before I checked in, but I have a very big obsession to stay here. Sure enough, I was not disappointed. My husband also thinks it is very good. He likes the sunken dining bar very much. It is very comfortable to order takeaway. The outside of the hotel is full of Balinese style, which makes me feel like I have come to Bali again. Although the sand on the public beach in Yalong Bay is very thick and rough, I never went there after catching crabs once, but Hilton has its own beach, which is white and fine like flour. If you have any questions, you can ask Ms. Lora, she is very enthusiastic. There is also the disturbing aunt Sun Xiuhong, who is very serious about disturbing. It's just that the floor is a little lower, and the north-facing room has a wall outside the balcony, but I don't care too much, because I have stayed in a sea view room for 3 days in other hotels hahaha.

Because the travel time is in the off-season, there are fewer tourists on the beach, so the experience is great. This must be a five-star praise.

Facilities: There are many swimming pools downstairs in the hotel. The water depth ranges from 1 meter to 1.5 meters. There is also a special children's swimming pool. The room is spacious and bright. This time I stayed in a sea-view twin room on the sixth floor. The balcony can overlook the beach and the dividing line between sea and sky. At the same time, the room is also equipped with many clothes racks, and there are also clothes drying racks on the balcony, which is very considerate.

Hygiene: The room we stayed in was very clean and the daily cleaning was meticulous.

Service: Before check-in, the hotel arranged for a customer manager to communicate before check-in to help find a satisfactory room. The customer manager Wu Liguo has a very good service attitude. He responded to and satisfied the needs raised during the stay in a timely manner. Every day, he will take the initiative to say hello and ask if there is any For other requirements, take the initiative to ask if you need a late check-out.

After the butler Wu Liguo communicated with me, according to my needs, I checked in at eleven o'clock directly after I checked out from the previous hotel [yeah][ Yeah][yeah] Great, Xiao Wu upgraded the room for me, led me to the room from the front desk, and asked me whether I like Coke, Sprite, or Wanglaoji [wit][wit][wit], usually I dare not drink too much Drinks, I dare to be so indulgent only when I‚Äôm on vacation [Yeah] [Yeah] [Yeah] Xiao Wu helped me upgrade to a pool view + sea view room, the view is pretty good, the swimming pool is just opened when the curtains are opened, I am very satisfied. In the afternoon, I watched the sea on the beach lounge chair of the hotel. When I returned to the room, the Coke was already in the refrigerator and the fruit was on the dining table. At breakfast the next day, Xiao Wu sent another message asking me if I needed to add anything else. I wanted more drinking water. When I returned to my room, I had already placed a piece of drinking water [strong][strong][strong] Good hotel, I want to stay longer [wit][wit][wit] On the day of check-out, Xiao Wu helped me to extend the check-out. This service is absolutely amazing. If it wasn't for other arrangements later, I would really have to renew the room and stay for another two days.
The design of the room is open, and the design is relatively modern. It's just that when the bathtub upstairs is enjoying the bath, it's late at night, and the sound of running water is a bit obvious. In other words, it's not environmentally friendly, and it's a waste of water.
Room service is also very good, everyone is soft spoken and polite. Facilities: The C seats of the hotel are reserved for swimming pools. There are various swimming pools, large and small, for adults and children to have a good time. The big swimming pools are not covered during the day, so it takes courage to swim. But other pools are nice to swim in the shade. The big swimming pool closes at 22:30 in the evening. The safety lifeguards are especially commended. They take strict care of the children who are paying bills, immediately pay attention to where the parents are, and remind the parents who are using mobile phones to keep their eyes on their children. There are a lot of inflatable toys on the water, dozens of large and small, as well as many deck chairs, and some pavilions, which are very good for sun protection. The hotel also has its own small farm. I walked around slowly, pineapple, longan tree, dragon fruit... I can walk around the hotel when the sun is not out.
Breakfast: On the first day, we sat indoors, with air conditioning, but the room is not big, so we had to wait for a seat for breakfast, but the waiting time was not long, and we were seated quickly. On the second day, I asked to sit outside. The heat was acceptable, and I felt no pressure to eat. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about eating quickly so that I could give seats to those who were waiting. It's a pity that there is no refreshment for breakfast.
Environment: There is a lawn on the left side facing the sea. It is an excellent C position for viewing the sea and taking pictures. In the afternoon, under the sunshine, the sea water is super blue. I can take pictures casually there. There are many photographers on the beach to help you take pictures, of course for a fee. For me, I don't need them at all.
All in all, a great time at the Hilton

msg:I have been planting grass on Hilton, and the experience of staying is good.
The housekeeper katie was gentle, careful, and patiently helped answer check-in inquiries from the beginning of the reception, led the guests into the room, and helped to book children's activities.
There is a dryer in the room, there is no damp smell, and the view is pretty good.
We asked customer service to provide 2 bottles of mineral water, and the waiter brought 6 bottles directly.
The only thing I want to complain about is that there is a concierge to help carry luggage from the car when checking in, but there is no concierge to help carry luggage to the car when leaving the hotel. Because I took the children and the elderly alone, one of the two luggage was carried by myself, and the other was pushed by the old mother to the front of the car and the driver carried it. The concierge next to me saw it, but did not help, even The car at the door almost hit my mother and luggage. This is a bit disappointing.

Summer iced fruit drinks, to be honest in the morning, the variety is a bit small, not as good as the MGM where I stayed before. But it all tasted great! The queue is actually very fast, and everyone's service is very good! Before check-in, the butler Moon contacted in advance to meet customer needs. I have been to Sanya so many times, and I have never had such a good butler! Very sweet! Ask every day if there is any need, and also help to delay check-out, a small gesture, a big touch!

msg:A very bad experience, highly not recommended.
Most of the time I stayed in Marriott hotels before. This was the first time I chose the Hilton brand. I didn‚Äôt dare to try it in the future. I regretted not choosing the Yalong Bay Marriott next door. The overall service, environment and rooms are very poor. The check-in experience was too bad and I was not in the mood to take any photos, so I just put a TV with a crooked installation.

The interior decoration of the room is very old and poorly maintained. It feels like an old hotel that is more than ten years old. There was mold on the walls, a lot of water stains on the bathroom hardware, and hair in the sink that had not been cleaned. There was a damp musty smell in the room, and it was also very strong in the elevator. I booked two rooms. One room was equipped with a dehumidifier, but the other was not. The hair dryer was only available in one room, and the switch in the other room could not be adjusted and could only blow cold air. The spare parts provided are of the worst quality, and the toothbrush is harder than a shoe brush. The shower gel is hard to use and the brand is unknown. The supplies are not as good as those of All Seasons, let alone other brand hotels of the same level.

The service is pretty good. I guess they hired all the interns to replace them during the summer to save costs. When I was queuing for CI, I saw a refrigerator with ice water and cold towels nearby, but no one helped to get it. It was very hot to stand in line for more than ten minutes, and I couldn't go there by myself. There was no one to help with the luggage. There was another queue when checking out. Other hotels just give you a room card, but this hotel requires you to stand in line with your luggage for more than ten minutes, and there is no air conditioning.

The breakfast experience was even worse. There was a long queue at the door, and there was no water provided while everyone was standing. There was no air conditioning in the queue area. However, after entering, I found that there were actually many empty seats, but there were not enough service staff to clean them. The food is also very poor, the juices are not freshly squeezed, and canned additives are used to make them taste bad. The fruit was not fresh either, the watermelon was almost rotten. I went to the egg stall and ordered an omelet. I was given a cold one because the previous customer probably ordered it but didn't get it. I didn‚Äôt even know how to heat it up. The cold half-boiled eggs were so fishy that I felt like vomiting.
Sitting next to the gate, the waiter suddenly opened the door halfway through the meal because someone wanted to sit outside. The wind was very strong, and the hot air from outside was very uncomfortable. I closed the door repeatedly and he opened it again. He had a very bad attitude and told me not to close it again.

The swimming pools in the hotel park are also very small. Several swimming pools are separate and only some rooms are exclusive. So the only ones that can actually be used are a large pool in the middle and a children's pool next to it. There were so many people and they were all crowded with children, so it was impossible to have fun. I stayed there for more than ten minutes and then went back.

In addition, this hotel has also followed the trend and equipped with a so-called exclusive butler, but it is purely to disgust people, and he is probably an intern. Before checking in, I called to ask if I had any needs for the room. I said it would be best if I could upgrade to a room with a view. I was told that the basic room type only has the first and second floors. I just said, help me choose the one with a higher floor, so that the two rooms are closer together.
When I arrived, I was given a room on the first floor. I didn't know what that meant. The lady next to me at CI also booked a basic room, and the front desk upgraded her to a 6th-floor sea view room, haha. My view is also the worst, with nothing but grass outside. It's also on the first floor, and the view from the adjacent building facing the river is slightly better. I didn't see anyone staying there for two days, and I wasn't given any arrangements. If you say the room is tight and cannot meet your needs, of course I understand. Obviously, if the conditions permit, the people next to me can be upgraded to the top floor with luxurious sea view, but I can't be upgraded to the second floor.
Also, the room we booked had a single breakfast, so I asked the housekeeper what it would be like to have an extra breakfast and how much it would cost. He only replied to the first question and asked me to go to the front desk to ask it myself. I said just tell me the price directly. I know I have to go to the front desk to add it. He yelled over there, saying that you didn't ask how much it was at the beginning, which was quite funny.

Overall, it was an extremely bad experience. There is no reason to recommend this hotel. The service, view, environment, decoration, and food are all terrible. The price is around 1,500, which is completely uncompetitive compared with the Marriott and MGM next door. If the price is 600 or 700, which is the same price as the Renaissance, you can stay there. Although the sea view and swimming pool are worse than the Renaissance, the location is better and it is convenient to eat nearby.

I live in an old hotel in Madai, with a great view, even older than here, and there is no TV provided. The hotel has been painted in recent years, it is very clean, the environment is very good, the rooms are very large, all the rooms seem to be facing the sea in a single row, the huge bathtub faces the sea, more than enough for 2 children to take a bath. The service is good, there are no dead ends in cleaning the room, and the breakfast products are of good quality. The activities organized by the Kids Club every day, such as catching sand crabs and bubble parties, are very popular among children. The butler service is really in place. The manager Wu Liguo contacted me before check-in, and specially helped us reserve a room with a high floor and a good view. We didn't have to check in until 3 pm. During the period, the air conditioner was not cooling, and it was quickly repaired. The service attitude of the hotel is relatively good, and I give it a five-star praise! The only bad thing is that it has been more than ten years since I came to Yalong Bay last time, and I found that the water quality of the beach is much worse than before.

msg:I brought my children to Sanya to play. After comprehensive consideration, I chose Hilton Yalong Bay as the first hotel in this trip to Sanya. Before I came here, there were mixed reviews on the Internet and I was a little nervous. After checking in, I felt pretty good. I checked in at the lobby There are a lot of guests, and we have to queue for a while. The manager Wu Liguo came over to check us in immediately, minimizing the waiting time for the guests. Afterwards, he carefully explained where the hotel's various facilities are and when they are used, reminding us to pay attention to safety. The enthusiasm of Sanya is coming;
After entering the room, I feel that the hotel facilities are well maintained, not as old as what netizens said, maybe some people are too demanding! üòÇThe weather is hot, I sweat all over when I go out, there is not enough water in the room, I asked the cleaning lady for water, during the three days of staying here, the cleaning lady put a few more bottles of water for us every day, every time we meet, she warmly greets us, and I am especially grateful to the waiter this miss
There are many swimming pools in the hotel, and the security is very high. There are lifeguards beside each swimming pool. Let my father accompany me, and the child soaks in the water every day. I took the time to go to the "Lily's Joyful Fat Burning Party" class included in the Ctrip booking package. I caught up with the buttocks class. I was the only guest, and the coach didn't even paddle. , is more serious than my personal training class in the gym, and the professionalism is also very high, so that after the class, I talked with Coach Lily about how to better train strength with other equipment. I have gained a lot after staying for a long time. Saved a few hundred üòÅ, and the environment outside the gym is super beautiful, and there are two black swans;
As a parent-child hotel, I think Hilton is quite good. Every day, children‚Äôs activities are full, and most of them are more suitable for kindergarten children. My children are older and are not interested in handicraft activities, but food activities such as making rice balls üçô making sandwiches ü•™ and at night Beach üèñThe outdoor activities of catching small crabs are very interesting. I have experienced it in the past few days. After the food activity, I have to eat it on the spot. For some children, it is afternoon tea, but for my family, it is high pressure. Small beach After catching the crabs, the teacher will ask to put them back into nature. The experience is so good that the children don't want to go home after playing!
During the period, I went to the Bucket Kingdom, which has been on a variety show, for a stroll. It is a parent-child restaurant. The waitress spoke softly. I ate two ice creams. The presentation was very good and the price was also good.

Facilities: An old five-star hotel with early decoration and good maintenance. Being near the sea, humidity is inevitable.
Hygiene: The sanitation is quite satisfactory, not as bad as it is said on the Internet. Indeed, I saw a gecko afterwards, which is very cute. Zhou Xiaona, the room attendant, folds different towels and small animals for the children every day. Because there are so many babies, she also leaves a lot of water for them. She is warm and thoughtful. It is also very hard work for us to clean up the takeaway every day.
Service: The waiter Wu Yinglong also sent us a luxurious welcome fruit, which was responsive to every request. He also added Erbao's bathrobes, toiletries, ice buckets, etc., because the baby is busy, I don't know how many times I called room service, what about the guardrails? Yes, still maintain the five-star standard.
Environment: Beautiful as a garden, Southeast Asian style, sitting on the C-seat beach of Yalong Bay, it is very convenient to walk directly to the beach from the guest room. Because of the high ceiling, the sea breeze blows directly in the lobby, and the draft is actually very cool. This style of lobby does not have sufficient air conditioning, is not economical, and is not practical. In the current peak season, there are indeed many people for breakfast, but fortunately, it is still arranged in an orderly manner. It is recommended to go before 8 o'clock, or directly after 9:30, when there are fewer people. Liu queued up after 8.30. End at 10.30. There are many large and small swimming pools, and the children like it very much. Takeaway is very convenient now, and checkout is super fast. Will come back next time on vacation.

Special thanks to the Hilton staff. Provided us with a very nice travel experience.

I hope the sand on the beach can become more fine. In addition, I think the interior of the room is slightly damaged and the hotel building has water damage for a long time. I hope the hotel can renovate the following problems. But generally speaking, I still feel the best overall among these hotels in Yalong Bay. After all, I have been to many famous hotels and stayed. Finally, thank you for this wonderful trip, come again next year, wait for me~

The only regret is that the meals in this hotel are terrible. The breakfast is mediocre but the service is excellent.

The breakfast variety is also quite rich, and the local noodles in Hainan are really delicious. Besides, there are big lobsters, oysters, abalones, etc. on the beach buffet with two big ones and one small one. They are very good and better than the buffet at the Sheraton next door.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the service. Ms. Qiu Hairong, who is in charge of cleaning our guest room, is very serious about cleaning. She asks every day if there are any additional needs and what needs to be improved. She is very serious and responsible, and she also sent fruits and drinks.

Before I checked in, the housekeeper may added me, and then told me to pick me up when I arrived, and also prepared a footstool for my room.

Thanks to the housekeeper, Cici, for being warm, considerate and thoughtful, and taking the trouble to answer all kinds of trivial things that we are not big but bring the baby and the elderly together! Thanks to Yang Weihai, the food delivery depar**ent, for the punctual and thoughtful service, and also sent us fresh coconuts and Hainan special fruits, which are so delicate!
Highly recommend the garden pool room, it is quiet, the water is clean, and you can swim anytime. It's really great, but it's really not expensive at all. The hotel is very user-friendly, and an extra bed is provided for us. Three adults and one child can also have a lot of space together. This is probably the hotel room with the highest price-performance ratio in my personal opinion.
Hilton's service is super good. Needless to say, the environment is so wonderful. The children had so much fun, and there is no time to play in the free children's playground and children's water slides. It's a pity. Next time, I must stay for a week and experience the various projects of the hotel.
Behind the hotel is the sea, so beautiful.
I made an appoin**ent with my children to come back to the Hilton Sanya Yalong Bay again after the summer vacation!

I commend the butler, Cici, for contacting me in advance to ask about my needs, helping to arrange a high floor (3516) that I like, and taking the initiative to ask if I need help every day. The service is thoughtful.
Praise the little golden girl who cleans the house, cleans the room every day (3516), is serious and down-to-earth in her work, and is enthusiastic and sincere.
Others: The children's swimming pool is small, and it is crowded every evening; there is a queue for breakfast every day (after 9 o'clock); the smell of the corridor on the 5th floor of the 3rd building is not very comfortable, I don't know if it is the smell of the air purifier (forgot ask customer service).

Because of Wu Liguo, the account manager, my experience of staying this time was even better. Manager Wu is dedicated to his responsibilities and considers customers. He really feels at home. I would like to give Manager Wu a big compliment. I was worried that the hotel would be a little old, but after I checked in, I didn't have any worries. The sanitation is very good, there is no musty smell in the room, and I slept very comfortably. Before check-in, I made many phone calls to ask the front desk some questions, and the lady at the front desk answered them patiently. Due to the time, I really feel that I haven't stayed enough this time, and I will choose Hilton Hotel next time.

msg:In June, I stayed in Yalong Bay for four nights, two nights at the Marriott, and two nights at the Hilton. From the comparison of the two, for me:

Advantages of Hilton: Shampoo, shower gel, hand sanitizer, body lotion, smells good and has characteristics. There are many types of swimming pools and the total area is large. It is convenient to communicate with butler service.

Disadvantages of Hilton: Poor service at the front desk. The check-in staff is a compatriot from Xinjiang with a name starting with Ai. They did not inform the breakfast location and the building number (there are buildings 1 to 8). The check-out staff is A woman wearing black-rimmed glasses and her name format is ABB. After refusing to check out me, she checked out other guests. After being questioned by me, she said that she had heard wrong and thought I was going to check in. She was speechless, and the front desk was very poor. The room cleaning is not particularly clean. The breakfast restaurant is small in size with few types. There are few loungers on the beach.

When the two prices are similar, Marriott is better.

msg:Facilities: The hotel has a lot of heated swimming pools, and you can swim after 9 o'clock in the evening
Hygiene: Like Aunt Su Hongmei by real name, the sanitation is very good, there is a faint fragrance when entering the room, and the air conditioner has been turned on in advance and the temperature is just right. This hygiene is definitely one of the best among the hotels I have stayed in. I can‚Äôt fault it Problem, most hotel toilets and bathrooms have a musty smell, this one doesn't have it at all.
Environment: We live in Room 7. The balcony can see the sea. It is enough for couples to stay. After all, they will not stay in the room at all. Everyone plays in the swimming pool on the first floor of the hotel. The swimming pool is only close to the sea. Go to the beach for a walk 3 minutes, lying on the chair by the swimming pool on the first floor at night, blowing the sea breeze, you can go to the nearby Baihuagu for dinner, it takes 10 minutes to take a taxi from the hotel entrance, and you can go shopping after eating
Service: First-class service, there is a special guy at the gate of the hotel to receive and help with luggage, and he will help call a car when you go out

msg:The experience of staying this time is very good, and the recent occupancy rate is relatively high, almost fully occupied! First of all, the manager Wu Liguo contacted me in advance before I came. Because I arrived at the store late, I specially helped to arrange the room, and the two rooms are very close to each other. If we have any problems during the period, we can contact him on WeChat to solve them. I feel that the service is too good~ I have a good meal with my friends, the hotel environment is also great, the beach swimming pool is the highlight, and the quality of the breakfast is also very good. I will come again next time I have a chance! Everyone remember to do sunscreen~

I personally still like the normal room type! Well, there are so many children's activities in the hotel that they can't participate. The fly in the oin**ent is that there may be too many people in the hotel, and check-out cannot be delayed until 3:00 p.m., but only at 2:00 p.m. My baby usually sleeps from 12:00 to 15:00, went to bed at 11:00 that day, and woke up at 13:40. We can only check in at 16 o'clock when we check in.

Especially the butler Any is very nice. He added my WeChat account in advance to arrange the room, because we are bringing a baby to stay, and all kinds of bed surrounds are arranged in place in advance. The service is first-class
The service staff in charge of cleaning in the hotel are also very serious. A box of mineral water is filled directly, and various fruit drinks are delivered every day.
You can rent swimming rings for the outdoor swimming pool, and there are free bath towels you can use, which is a good point!
In short, Hilton gave me a big surprise. I don't know how other resort hotels in Yalong Bay are, but Hilton is completely satisfied.

However, if it is a hotel listed as a parent-child hotel, it is really average, and the children's supplies in the room are almost useless. The food for breakfast is good. It is recommended to prepare disposable bibs for children. This is currently available in many ordinary restaurants.
The service is in place, the hotel's air conditioner is cool enough, and the scenery is beautiful

msg:We moved from the Marriott next door, and the gap was so big that the child cried and wanted to move back. The price is about the same, I didn't expect the difference to be so big.

First of all, the hardware: the room is old and has a musty smell. It feels like 20 years ago, the room card is plug-in, the facilities are very mottled, seven or eight small bugs were found on the bed, and the customer service arranged to change it at midnight. The room is said to be upgraded, but who wants to carry the child to pack luggage and change rooms in the middle of the night, just to have a better view from the balcony? In addition, there is also a problem with the design. The room is not big. I don't understand why there is a huge round bathtub? And why there are two steps, it is easy to fall. Also, when I washed the clothes, I found that there was no soap. The customer service first said it was in the drawer, and then said it would be delivered. There are no shaving products or skin care products. What Marriott provides is a full set of Herborist. There is nothing besides the phone at the bedside, there is no common bluetooth stereo, and finally there is a light control at the bedside, which is too old and not integrated at all. In addition, I have to complain about the maze-like room layout, because there are six buildings, which are not completely connected. There are identical corridors everywhere, no air conditioning, no eye-catching signs, and no staff can be seen. I often go around to find not in place.

Let's talk about the parent-child configuration. Before staying at the Marriott, the staff greeted the children as soon as they entered the lobby and gave them a string of shell necklaces. No one greeted the children during the Hilton stay. It felt like they didn't even look at us. There are no children's bathrobes in the room, and no children's toothbrush. The so-called eight swimming pools are good for taking pictures, but there is no shade at all, and almost no one goes swimming. In addition, there is a fee for swimming laps, 30 yuan for each, 30 yuan for a small train, 10 yuan for adults' socks, 6 yuan for children's socks when going to the children's playground, and there are many charged products hanging at the door. There are also parent-child activities. Marriott has nine a day, almost every hour, and Hilton has only five. We participated in bubble parties and graffiti windmills. For the bubble party, the staff just prepared bubble liquid and a bubble machine, and then the parents took their children to blow bubbles throughout the whole process, and the staff just stood on the sidelines to watch. Doodle Windmill was given a set of very rough windmill cards for coloring. The key patterns are small and complicated, and the brushes given are very thick. Basically, parents are drawing. The children's playground also feels very old. The outdoor playground is locked. You have to enter from the indoor children's playground and you have to register. The playground has a large area, but there are no facilities. There are no seesaws and thousands of slides. It is said to be for playing in the water, but there is no water, and it is probably not turned on. Anyway, the children will not be interested in it for five minutes after entering.

Let's talk about the service. First of all, ten minutes after check-in, a staff member suddenly opened the door and came in, saying that it was to check whether the cleaning was clean. The question is, shouldn't this be done before check-in? What if the guest is in the shower or something? Then, in the evening, the child was sleeping, and there was a harsh doorbell. In the end, I was not sure whether I opened the door or the staff came in. I was already confused, and said that it was free soft drinks and a few fruits, wrapped in cloth bags He came over and asked me to put the cloth bag back to him. It was completely confused and the refrigerator was empty. Shouldn't these be put away before check-in? In addition, most of the staff members encountered on the road passed by without greeting the guests.

Breakfast, that is, enough to eat, don't think about other things.

In short, although I only stayed for one day, it was very frustrating. I delayed check-out until 2:00, but I checked out at 12:00. It was too bad, I would rather go to the airport

People say this is the rule we have. I said I got it, it would be fine if I didn‚Äôt wear any clothes next time, but people stopped me and refused to let me in, so I had to take off my clothes on the spot to go in! If your family doesn‚Äôt think it looks good to eat in a bathrobe, why don‚Äôt you put a sign in the room where the bathrobe is hung? Wearing a bathing suit looks good when you go in, right?

msg:A friend recommended Hilton Yalong Bay, so I read the reviews and the environment on Ctrip, and decisively booked a deluxe sea view room for two nights.
Service: The housekeeper May contacted me one day in advance, and when I arrived at the hotel at almost 8:00 that night, someone came to help pull the suitcase, and after checking in, I was guided to the room. The housekeeper, May, has a warm service and the arranged room is very good. This time it is on the 6th floor of Building 2. The balcony can directly view the sea. We had a very pleasant stay. She would ask me every night and morning if I needed help. I asked her to arrange a honeymoon trip and arranged it in advance. Her service must be 100 points, and the overall stay experience is really good!

Environment: Hilton Hotel room style solid wood furniture, calm and introverted and reasonable layout, the functional division is well done, the key is a lot of tables and stools, especially those with a lot of luggage, there is a verbena fragrance as soon as you enter the hotel, it smells good. .
The external environment of the hotel is the children's area of the garden swimming pool, the beach üèñBBQ, and there is a professional band singing every night. Soaking in the poolside, blowing the sea breeze, listening to songs, and smelling the aroma of barbecue, don't be too comfortable! Moreover, Hilton has a lot of swimming pools, at least five, and the pools are very clear. You can also see that the deck chair covers are replaced and cleaned every day. The beach is right at the hotel entrance, and the sea can be seen at a glance. It is really suitable for relaxation.


Cleanliness: I have to say that the standard of a five-star hotel is very clean. I went to the forest park yesterday and came back to find that the room has been cleaned up, and the auntie did not move the luggage. She also changed the sheets and put them away. Got a new bath set and 4 bottles of mineral water.

Diet: There is no need to queue for breakfast, because it is not as rich as a buffet lunch until 10:30, but for breakfast standards, it has reached the standard and the taste is okay.

Because I arrived at the hotel late that day, I should check out at 12 o'clock today, but May took the initiative to do a late check-out for me. It happened that I was delayed for an hour when I went to the Yalong Bay beach to play. She said it was okay, and the hotel didn't rush me. Really Very caring, touched.

I want to give Amway Hilton Hotel to friends who come to Sanya for free, and I will choose Hilton Hotel next time I have a chance!

msg:It can be said that there is no service. The front desk of the hotel is expressionless and has no sense of service. When checking in, a guest next to me said that due to the reason of the hotel, he could check out later tomorrow. The front desk replied that no, the regulations It's 12 o'clock. There was someone to help with the luggage when I checked in, and no one was in charge when I checked out, and the room was very humid, especially there was no basic hand sanitizer in the room, and the toilet paper was the worst kind, worse than that of ordinary small hotels Worse, the design of the room is also problematic. There are three steps between the balcony and the room, and I often fall down accidentally. It‚Äôs even more weird when it‚Äôs raining. It‚Äôs just the size of a person, and it hits the wall while helping a child take a bath. Speaking of parent-child hotels, apart from a few swimming pools, the funniest thing is the bucket park, which is a children's restaurant. A small bowl of pumpkin porridge costs 48 yuan, and there is a 15% service charge. In a word, it is really not worth it For this price, everyone wants to live. It is best to read the bad reviews, which are all real reviews.

msg:After 12 years, I traveled to Sanya with two treasures. I made a lot of strategies, read a lot of reviews, and combined many factors. I chose the Hilton Yalong Bay Hotel, which is cost-effective. In the evening, there are enough bath towels and towels. I really feel that I made the right choice. Before I checked in, Cici, the housekeeper, added WeChat to inquire about the needs, and prepared a small gift for the children. If there is any need, I will solve it immediately, and the reply is very timely. Parking is also easy It is convenient and free of charge. Thanks to the housekeeper Cici for being serious and responsible. This trip to Sanya was very pleasant.

msg:Staying at Hilton again, the feeling is still so good. The garden is still so beautiful, the service is still so considerate, and the hotel's facilities are better maintained. Basically, every waiter I encountered was kind and enthusiastic, which made me, a repeat customer, feel that I had chosen the right hotel again. Here I would like to thank a few people in particular, who left me with pleasant memories during the 7 days of my stay. The first is Wang Shuang from guest relations, whose English name is Harry. During the 7-day stay, she was bothered by various chores, but she was so patient, dedicated, and efficient, which really made us feel at home. Regardless of whether she is at work or not, she always responds to her immediately. She is very careful in her work and has a very enthusiastic attitude, which makes people sincerely appreciate it. I also want to thank Xiao Meng from the food delivery depar**ent. Some of us had a birthday. He thoughtfully delivered cakes and fruits, which brought us surprises and left us with wonderful birthday memories. I also want to thank Huang Yingying who has been cleaning for us these days. She is kind and hardworking. Thank you for helping us a lot.
It is precisely because of their professional attitude and gratifying service that friends who came to vacation directly recommended Hilton, and we were able to get together.
This Hilton is not considered a new hotel. I have stayed in it many times since it first opened, but it is really rare to be satisfied with everything after staying for 7 days. Definitely will come again.

msg:1. We stayed in a parent-child room. At 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, the upstairs guest was smoking in the bathroom and came to our room from the bathroom. Then the lights and exhaust in the bathroom are linked, and the lights must be turned on to exhaust before they can be used.
2. The room has no windows. I could only open the balcony door to get some fresh air. At night, rats came in from the balcony to steal food. When I saw them, they left in a familiar manner.
3. There was a sofa in the room, and a puddle of melted chocolate sauce was found on the sofa. We asked the waiter to clean, but they just picked up the chocolates for us. So their sofas are not cleaned. Sit carefully.
Anyway, what happened in this hotel is quite shocking. .
But one thing to say, the service is good and the swimming pool is not bad. .

The room cleaning is also very clean, and because we have children and want them to see the beautiful scenery downstairs, Alora helped us coordinate the room change. Thank you for her arrangement and reception. Wechat communication in advance is very helpful for us and the baby It's nice to make people feel at home.
There is a parent-child restaurant in the hotel. There is a dress code, and the decoration is childlike, but the price is expensive. Group buying second * a piece of ice cream for the children, it is considered eating.
There is a swimming pool in the yard, and the beach is just a few steps down the stairs. The waves are a little bit too big, so if children dare not go into the water, they mainly play with sand.
There are a total of 8 buildings, and the walking distance is relatively long. The front desk is in the middle. If you order takeaway, you can only pick it up outside the lobby downstairs.
The hotel's buffet breakfast is rich in dishes, both Chinese and Western, both hot and cold. You need to eat early, or you will have to wait in line if you enter the door late.
The package purchased by booking includes two breakfasts and a fruit juice drink, which can only be drunk on the spot at night and cannot be taken away. There are also discounts for some activities and scenic spot tickets, but most of them are not very useful. There is a child in the hotel Children like the paradise very much. You can also get a handmade material package, swim in the hotel's swimming pool, and use the swimming ring for free for 2 hours. These are more useful in the package.
The overall feeling is good. Although there were some small episodes in the middle, Alora also actively helped us solve them. Apart from feeling that there is not enough time to stay for one night, everything else is good.

Although it is not the main parent-child hotel, you can participate in the parent-child activities of the bucket kingdom. The daily content is very rich.

msg:In Sanya for a week, I stayed in three or four hotels in different bay areas. The Hilton in Yalong Bay is my favorite.
The first is the service of the hotel. I am very satisfied with the all-round warm service. The hotel called the day before check-in to confirm the check-in time and ensure that you can check in immediately when you arrive at the store.
After arriving at the store, the doormen at the door were very diligent, they were very active in opening the door and carrying luggage. The three of us had a lot of luggage, so they trotted all the way to push the luggage cart.
The front desk was also very enthusiastic when I checked in. Of course, I would like to thank Van at the front desk. The check-in process was very fast, without any muddle, and he introduced the hotel's facilities in an orderly manner. Even if I came here for the first time, I was very satisfied. Quickly have a general understanding of the general layout and facilities of the hotel, which really makes people feel a little better about the hotel from the moment they check in.
Aunt Su Hongmei, who cleans the room, is also very enthusiastic. The room is cleaned very clean, and she will come to inquire about the needs every morning, and she will greet you warmly when we meet. Every time we go out to play, the aunt will come to clean, buy toiletries, and use Fold some small animals in towels and put them on the bed. It will really make people feel better after seeing them.
The second is the location and environment of the hotel. The hotel is in Yalong Bay. Unlike the lively Sanya Bay, Yalong Bay is closer to nature. What I want to see most when I come to Sanya is of course the sea. The Hilton is right by the sea. Go out from the first floor to the swimming pool area. There are seven or eight constant temperature swimming pools. The water quality is very good, the cleaning is also very clean, and the greening is also very good. Across the pool area is the beach, ocean. There are also several large shopping malls and food streets near the hotel. If you don't eat in the hotel, it is very convenient to go shopping and eat.
The hotel's sea view room has a great view. Standing on the balcony, you can see the boundless sea. When the weather is good, it is very beautiful. Whether it is day or night, sitting on the balcony and listening to the sound of the waves is very pleasant, and even makes me There is a kind of idea that I don't want to go to the scenic spots, but just want to lie down in the hotel for ten or eight days to have a good rest. Every evening, there is an open-air buffet in the beach area of the hotel, and there are also bands singing. Whether it is by the sea, dining on the beach, or on the balcony of the hotel room, you can hear it. The singing of the band and the sound of the waves one after another really made people feel the relaxation and comfort of vacation.
All in all, during the week of my trip to Sanya, Hilton was definitely the first hotel I stayed in, and I will definitely choose it again next time I come to Sanya.

üè†Room facilities: The suites are very spacious and have all the basic facilities. For the fifth year in Sanya, the location and facilities of Hilton have always been my choice. Taking my mother to rest for a few days every year is also the goal of the year. First, look at the room The view I arrived at was the swimming pool view (I personally think it is more interesting than the full sea view), and the other buildings 1.2. If you stay for several days in a row, be aware that your toiletries will be replaced with Yulong ones later. At first, I thought it was a mistake. It should be the hotel‚Äôs requirement to keep doing this for two consecutive years, so you can tell the room cleaners.

üçÉService: considerate service, there are indeed a lot of people in February, and I finally understand why everyone is willing to spend so much money for the New Year. Sanya in February is really very comfortable. I have been here in June, September, October, November, and December. Sanya in Sanya is the most comfortable place, the sea is quiet without wind, so I will have to work harder to make money in the future.

üöóParking: Both the ground and the ground are very convenientüÖøÔ∏è, my mother gets motion sickness and I have always rented an electric car, which can be placed in the place where the employees leave the car.

ü•™Breakfast: The breakfast time period is relatively long, and the variety is also very rich. After 8:00, there are more people and there will be queues, so you can come earlier. The Chinese and Western food is very rich and fully meets the needs. This year, there is a new casserole porridge. You must try it ü•£ delicious.

üåÉRoom view: The room view is excellent, and the eyes are full of happiness.

üèäSwimming pool: Both adults and children can play in the swimming pool. I have visited many hotels while walking on the beach. I personally think that the location and use of Hilton's swimming pool is the most reasonable.

üå± Cost-effectiveness: Originally this year was more expensive and I considered whether to change to Ritz or Park Hyatt, but in the end I chose the familiar Hilton. Although it has been a little more expensive for a while, I have always lived in suites. This time I chose a deluxe sea view room. , On the 4th floor, the view is not as good as the 5th floor. It is a room, but it is also very big, but my mother is very satisfied, and I think it is actually not bad. If the view is higher, it can fully meet the needs. The accommodation is not bad Sent a travel photo, this year is a Bojue travel photo, I took the photo in the morning and gave the photo in the afternoon, it is worthy of being a big brand, the communication and effect of the photo is really very satisfying to my wife, I must experience it ‚ö†Ô∏è, the beach buffet is also great, the food is delicious I am also happy, and the resident singing is also very a**ospheric. The desserts for dinner are the best and the seafood is fresh, but the little brother who served the ice cream is fierce, and his attitude is not very good, you need to pay attentionüò≥
üå∏:
In addition, I would like to praise Xiaoliang who served us by real name. He is enthusiastic and meticulous, which makes people feel very comfortable, and the cleaning is really neat and clean. Let the boss add chicken legsüçó
Sanya is really a place worth going to all the time, and Hilton also makes me feel more comfortable for this trip, work hard and earn money, see you next yearüòÑ

msg:It‚Äôs okay to live for the first time. I have a 7-year-old child. I personally think that the so-called parent-child programs in all hotels are not suitable for 7-year-old children. The naughty castles in a bathing center are more upscale than this one, so it is not suitable for children over 7 years old. 3-4 years old can still play. The room design is also average, very clean, but the household facilities are relatively old, and I hate the design of the lights , because it is used to leave a light outside at night to make it easier to wake up at night. There is no light in the room that is turned on without affecting sleep. The partition between the bed and the bathroom is still hollow, and it is impossible to sleep when the light is turned on. The switch design of this light is really good. Very speechless, the breakfast is not delicious, the variety is too small, too single, too ordinary, it does not meet the price of the room. The price is too far from St. Regis, the swimming pool is ok, the size is several, the only thing to be gratified is the service, the housekeeper May Contacted me early in the morning at 10 o'clock and gave me an early check-in and an upgraded room type. The service is very thoughtful. In particular, the floor attendant Sun Xiuhong is very thoughtful, meticulous and enthusiastic.

msg:This is the first time I stayed at Hilton. The hotel is really beautiful, except for some facilities in the children's playground. I hope it can be repaired as soon as possible. The beach is just outside the hotel, the sand is relatively fine, the sea water is very blue, the sky is very blue, everything is perfect, and many precious photos have been left behind! Room service Su Hongmei folded a lot of cute animal towels for the children, the children liked it very much! The hotel has many swimming pools of different depths, and the children are crazy about swimming and playing water fights in them! The bubble party at 9:30 in the morning is also super interesting! It is a great family hotel! If I have the chance, I will choose to come here again for vacation!

I booked a parent-child room with butler service throughout the whole process. My butler Amy is very nice and would ask me about my needs every day. When I heard that the corridor was noisy and affected my rest, I would offer to change rooms for me. Although I thought it was troublesome and didn't change it, this kind of service attitude is very comfortable!
Overall, it was a pleasant staying experience. Although the hotel is small, it has everything you need. Although it is a bit old, the service is really good. The only thing that is not good is the front desk. The front desk is really hard to describe!
Finally, I would like to thank Ctrip for helping coordinate the contents of the package during my stay, which made my stay feel perfect this time!

The next day, the hotel arrived at the hotel after 12 o'clock and the room was ready for check-in in advance. He gave the two children a small gift very thoughtfully, but it was a pity that it was lost on the return flight. ,Pity. üò§ We live in a cartoon family room. The room is large and the layout of the room is very reasonable. It is very suitable for living with children. The outdoor balcony leads directly to the garden. If adults want to rest in the room, children can play directly in the garden. There are many places to play in the hotel's indoor playground and outdoors. The two children like the beautiful woman who is responsible for the safety of the water slides. They can play with the children without going out of the hotel. The hotel's private beach is less crowded, and the beach in Yalong Bay is nothing to say. Thank you AMY again, and I will come again next time.

msg:Butler-style service, the staff member Amy added WeChat one day in advance to ask about the arrival time and help check-in. Introduce hotel facilities, children's activities, and help book the hotel's Bucket King restaurant.
The hotel was built a little earlier, but it is very well maintained! We stayed in the whole house cartoon parent-child room, with a king bed and a single bed, which is enough for 2 adults and 2 children to live in. There are three sinks in the room, which is convenient for washing. There is a door leading directly to the garden. Drying service is provided, and the laundry bag is filled with clothes for only 50 yuan, which can hold more than 10 summer swimwear.
The whole hotel is resort style, very beautiful, especially like the lights at night, super romantic! There is a beach theater at night, but no one watches it. The go-karts on the beach of the hotel are very fun, and the children like it very much. It costs 88 yuan for 10 minutes, but the staff will extend it for a long time. The package comes with 2 tickets for Yanoda, which can be picked up at the front desk. The staff is super generous. They asked us directly and gave 4 tickets.
Bucket King Restaurant is beautifully designed and very well-made. The dishes are creative, can catch the hearts of children, and taste good, but the quantity is too small compared to the price, which is not suitable for my 9-year-old and 7-year-old children. The pasta will be gone after a few bites.
The breakfast at the hotel is great, especially the casserole porridge, it tastes great!
In short, Hilton is still great, and the price is very high!

msg:Hilton Yalong Bay is a must choice for children. This trip brought two children, and finally chose Hilton in Yalong Bay. Before booking a room, I read some reviews from Ctrip in Xiaohongshu. I have various entanglements. I have been wandering in Ritz-Carlton and Marriott. I used to stay in Tianyu I have stayed here a long time ago. Although there are many activities, the feeling of accommodation is average for adults, and the price is only two or three hundred different from other homes. When thinking of bringing a baby, Liz gave up. Anyway, except for sleeping in the middle of the night, don‚Äôt even think about staying in the room. It is also very cost-effective for the children to live in the Hilton. The room fee is more than 2,000 yuan, which is completely worth it. There is a sea view room outside the honeymoon, and the location is quite good. The couple must live comfortably. To be honest, the service attitude of Hilton Hotel is really good. Unlike some online reviews, I was apprehensive before. In fact, when I think about it, the service can‚Äôt be bad at a room rate of more than 2,000. Anyway, what I encountered was very good. Solve it The question was also very timely. I thought that there would be an additional breakfast fee. After all, I have two children. As a result, Ctrip's customer service and the hotel customer service helped to communicate, and I feel very good! The Bucket Kingdom has a lot of activities. The two boys played in water and slides in an endless loop. They didn't participate in the activities at all. I think bringing a baby, sand and water is enough, and the energy is too full. This hotel is very worry-free for adults. The only thing is to rent a swimming ring for an hour, which is 60 yuan for an Internet celebrity swimming ring, and 30 for a small one. In the end, a two-hour coupon is barely acceptable. In fact, there should be no charge for swimming rings in hotels, or a symbolic charge, which can be regarded as a hotel benefit. Besides, there are actually many types of hotel rooms, such as garden pool rooms, which are directly connected to the swimming pool, and only one deluxe sea view room is directly facing the beach and the sea. The location is the best, so there is a lot of choice. The hotel is like a tropical garden, with high vegetation, surrounded by coconut trees, and a rich breakfast. Overall, it's good to choose Hilton with your baby. The two children are lingering and forgetting to return.

This time I came to Sanya and chose Hilton. I have stayed in the Ritz next door, MGM, St. Regis, Mangrove, Villa No. 5, and basically all the hotels along the beach in Yalong Bay, so try Hilton. I looked at the room type before coming here, and chose a two-bedroom sea view room with double balconies. Before arriving at the hotel, I was contacted by GSM Wu Liguo, and I arrived at the hotel in the evening. Because I brought a baby, Manager Wu directly helped us upgrade to a family parent-child sea view room, which is more suitable for children. The hardware facilities in the hotel rooms are a bit outdated due to the age, which is incomparable with the new hotels in Haitang Bay, but there are all that should be there, and it is normal and understandable. After all, Hilton is also a relatively early batch of hotels. I also jokingly told Manager Wu that hardware defects need to be compensated by your software. The feeling of staying for five days and four nights is generally okay. After all, during the Spring Festival, the hotel is overcrowded, especially during the morning meal time. Although it is busy, it is not chaotic. Children also like the hotel's children's playground and swimming pool, and the camping tents on the beach are also a good experience. Here I still want to praise GSM Manager Wu, who can answer us as soon as possible and make arrangements for any questions or requests. Including other staff in the hotel, they always greeted with a smile when they met, and it felt very kind. If conditions permit, it is recommended to redecorate and make Sanya Hilton even better!

Before checking in, Wu Liguo, a dedicated account manager, took the initiative to contact and add WeChat to ask whether he was here to lie flat or to shop and give professional advice. When he left, the buffet was not open yet and he was ready to pack it early.

Ariel at the front desk had a very good attitude and helped to postpone the check-out time for free. I also met my little fellow from Xinjiang and brought breakfast to the children.

The beach is very clean and beautiful, the flow of people is not too big, and free follow-up rights are given away. The whole family took a group of photos on the beach on New Year's Eve, which is very commemorative.

The hotel is also very friendly to children. There are facilities or activities that can be played at each time period. Throw the children to the children's center, and adults can relax.

In short, thanks to Sanya Hilton, let our family of 9 have a wonderful Chinese New Year experience!

msg:My favorite hotel in Sanya üè® The location is excellent, right in the middle of Yalong Bay, the view is wide, the sea view is magnificent, and it‚Äôs not as crowded as the previous beaches. There are also a lot of sun loungers by the beach and by the pool. The direct pool room we booked is simply dreamy. The entire garden pool It feels like home. The facilities are pretty good. The maintenance is relatively in place. Our lovely butler is Amy. She added WeChat to greet her every day. The arrangement is very convenient and friendly. It adds a new color to the journey. You can choose a few days to eat at the hotel and take out a lot of takeaways around. It‚Äôs also convenient. There‚Äôs a small food court next to it, and there‚Äôs a small food court to choose from. Thank you for moving bricks for a year. I hope to have more time to lie on the beach and relax.

At the beginning, Ali was the one who received us at the c/i at the front desk. He was patient and meticulous, and the service was in place. Later, because the room was not good enough, Stefen was the one who received us at the front desk. With the same patience, he helped to prepare the room, coordinate the room change, and provided various consultation and assistance during the period. Because the child was too tired to rest and delayed check-out, all of the above are very grateful. Special kudos to Stefen and Kyra!
The hotel staff I met in every link throughout the process were very polite and provided excellent service. The staff at the swimming pool were very considerate and provided help before our inquiries. Absolutely five-star quality!
I will stay here again next time, and I recommend everyone to live here! All the facilities are very friendly to children, and the call center is also very efficient. thumbs up üëç
The location of the hotel is also the C position on the proper beach. The design is very reasonable and the care is very neat. The flowers, plants and trees are full of design sense. The Bucket Kingdom is full of activities, and the children should not be too fulfilled!

The amu*****t facilities in the Bucket Kingdom are also particularly rich and interesting. The rooms with direct access to the pool are also great. Children go down to play every day.
In addition, a special thanks to Amy for helping us. Thanks to adding her WeChat, she always replied to me as soon as possible and gave us help. It may be because there are too many people in the hotel. Except for the queue for breakfast, no one answered every time I called the customer service center from the landline in the room. Later, I contacted Amy and helped me solve the problem every time. Thank you very much!
There is also Fengyuan Chinese restaurant, which tastes good. If you have the opportunity, you must try it.

Although the hotel's facilities are seen to be old, they are well maintained. Although we caught up with the cold wave, we can basically go into the sea or swim after 11 o'clock, and the baby had a great time. The advantage of being in Yalong Bay is that you don‚Äôt have to worry about eating. We basically have a full breakfast, a light meal at noon, and a big meal for dinner. Special thanks to the beautiful Ms. KITTY at the front desk, who not only helped us arrange to have a good view on the top floor, but also asked us every day if we needed fruit supplements. 5 points of praise must be given.

Special thanks to Wu Liguo, the customer service manager, who contacted us to arrange a room before arriving at the store, filled up our mini bar, and tried his best to meet all requirements.

The hotel has its own beach and there are three venues to choose from for dinner. The first one is beach buffet There are also live performances. The second one is Fengyuan Royal Duck. The ducks in Fengyuan are freshly roasted with fruit trees. Every dish is super delicious! The most worth mentioning is that there will be a one-to-one butler when we check in. Our butler is Xiaoma. He will care about our needs from the moment we check in. The next day, he will help us coordinate a sea view king bed and an extra bed. It's the wedding anniversary + Dabao's birthday. We specially arranged honeymoon decorations and a cake made by the chef. There are welcome fruits and soft drinks in the mini bar every day in the room. Xiaoma's service is great! The next time I come, I will still choose a hotel to stay at the end of the trip, saving luggage and check-in and check-out. The hotel will also help contact the service provider to the scenic spot, pick up and drop off directly, no need to take a taxi back and forth, and there are discounts on tickets! It is highly recommended for lazy mothers and lazy fathers to bring their children to live in Hilton~ We basically book Hilton every time we go to a scenic spot. There are also sand excavators and small trains for children in the hotel, as well as children's playgrounds and clown balloon shows. We also won the ring. What about a toy~ very happy memories! The hotel's buffet breakfast also kills the noodle shop outside, because you can have freshly made raw porridge and the best baguette I have eaten so far! My daughter took out a piece of baguette from her pocket on the plane, I was also drunk haha

Before coming here, I have been reading hotel reviews. I chose 3 hotels in Haitang Bay, and MGM in Yalong Bay. The last one was originally planned to be Hilton, but the child chose another one. It turned out to be a mistake. When I arrived at the hotel my baby chose, I decided that I had to change to Hilton the next day, and it turned out that my choice was correct, and Hilton brought my trip to a successful conclusion.
Although the hotels in Yalong Bay are not as new as those in Haitang Bay, the services, parent-child games, and children's facilities are all complete and mature.
The service of the butler Ariel also surprised us very much. Responsiveness and extra surprises, awesome.
This time, we didn't over-consider the room type because of the temporary reservation. We didn't expect that the first floor of the garden view really surprised us again. The room is clean and hygienic. You can walk directly to the courtyard from the room. Outside the window are green trees and lakes, as well as a few black swans and small farms. Compared with facing the sun and the sea and looking at the green plants every day, it makes you feel better, especially the child‚Äôs grandma said , The garden of this hotel looks really comfortable, and I feel very comfortable just lying on the bed without leaving the house.
If we come to Sanya again in the future, Hilton must be one of the hotels we must stay in!

Thanks to Amy for helping to communicate and arrange the mailing. The service is in place. Will choose again.

msg:A very bad check-in experience. First, after checking in, I waited for more than an hour for the room to be cleaned. Then, after check-in, no one answered the service calls.
On the third day after staying in the hotel, I started to have a fever. After we took the initiative to inform us that we were infected with the new crown, the hotel asked us not to go out and promised to deliver breakfast. We cooperated carefully, but the next day, after repeated urging, it was almost 11 o'clock. Two people sent a bowl of porridge, three snacks, three fruits, and two yogurts. I booked a room with two breakfasts included.
What's even more outrageous is that because I was unwell, I wanted to stay for a few more days to take a rest, but the customer service staff repeatedly asked me "Are you sure you want to stay?" next stubble.
The most bizarre thing is that the medicine bought from takeaway was placed on the express table of the hotel, but someone actually walked away. The hotel said to check the monitoring, but has not given any feedback on the situation so far.
A well-known five-star hotel with such a service level is really shameful.

Thinking that it must have been the king of Yalong Bay many years ago! The service is also good. There is a commercial center 2 kilometers away, which basically meets many requirements. You can also order takeaway at will! But there are also disadvantages. The old-fashioned hotel will definitely make the furniture and the like old because of the age, and it will smell a little damp. In addition, the silly sand in Yalong Bay is a bit thick. Friends who are looking for fine sand should go to other bays. In general, I highly recommend Hilton when coming to Yalong Bay!

Because I drove from Haikou, the check-in time is relatively early. , The room has not been cleaned yet, this classmate Qiu Yanyan helped us apply for free breakfast, and reminded us that the hotel can arrange for us to stay in a room of another type to rest, which is very considerate! After waiting for four hours, the eldest daughter also successfully completed the online class. We checked into the reserved family room. As soon as we entered, there was a smell of food that had not dissipated. The guest's hair, biscuit crumbs... (I won't post it after taking a picture, it's a bit disgusting) After reporting to the front desk, a sweaty manager Zhao Wulin came, apologized non-stop, and upgraded the room for us. An extra bed was added. Although the room was changed far away, in order to express my apologies, the person in charge moved the bed all the way, and personally mopped and vacuumed the floor with this classmate Wei Tao, and delivered fruit... I was so angry at first, but I watched With their performance, they told themselves several times that "the service industry is not easy in the three years of the epidemic, forget it"! Our whole family never mentioned it again! The experience of the next two days was basically pleasant! To remind the babies, there will be some gifts at the back of the room booked by Ctrip, so be sure to ask at the front desk when you check in, where to get the coupon, and how to generate the QR code! There are pitfalls in consumption everywhere, let alone Sanya, where the water is deep, so we must pay more attention! Let me talk about a girl named Tian Shuang in the diet section. As the person in charge of the company, I am very envious of her boss for being able to invite her! This girl is hard-working, enthusiastic and careful, and left a deep impression on our family!

It is especially worth mentioning that Mr. Duke, the salesman, learned that I felt sorry for the temporary removal of travel photography products during my stay, so he thoughtfully arranged for his colleagues to work overtime on weekends to record happy moments for my family, perfect! grateful!

If you have any problems during your stay, the butlers will help you solve them. Our butler "Xiao Ma" is very serious and responsible! Daily attention to our situation and needs. The children have to go swimming every day, and the heated swimming pool is also great. The children don't want to leave after playing. The lifeguard Sun Gefeng is very nice and helps us a lot! This hotel is definitely the best five-star hotel I have ever stayed in, whether it is hardware facilities, greening, personnel, or catering! Oh, I forgot to mention that in parent-child hotels, there are many activities for children, and there are no repeats throughout the day!

msg:Really good, Jinmao Hilton is the most comfortable hotel I stayed in Sanya, bar none. From the service quality of the entire team to the hardware facilities, in my opinion, it is the most suitable high-end hotel for children.
I have to say that their rooms are spacious and bright, and the housekeeping depar**ent is also very tolerant and generous. They have just been renovated a few years ago, and some specific parent-child room types are more suitable for children.
The courtyard is clean and classy. The only place I dare to go barefoot is Capella. The swimming pool design meets the needs of all age groups. In addition to functionality, it also has landscape beauty.
Who would have thought that this hotel was built 20 years ago. This kind of texture and design ideas have been imitated by many high-end resort hotels until now, but they have never been surpassed, and they can move forward steadily for so many years, constantly renovating and innovating , really with great taste and vision.
Thanks to Van who checked in at the front desk. He simply had a clear mind and entered the room to rest without delay. This is very important and a very plus point.
The only downside is the Chinese restaurant, which is not as delicious as before, and the roast duck is also average. Back then, my family members were the representatives of the owners of these two hotels, and they were also good friends with the Hong Kong chefs. Now they focus on parenting. Although the grand occasion is no longer the same as before, it is more suitable for me, and it is still as good in my heart. Blowing out the candles on my birthday, I was a little upset when I was reminded by the waitress about the off-duty time without knowing it.

What surprised me the most is that the Hilton hotel butler Wu Liguo who served us this time contacted us as soon as he came out of the airport. This time we stayed for 8 days in total.

I guess other bloggers who explore the store have already talked about it in detail, especially the service. . The service is really considerate. The hotel's exclusive butler (I think it should be called that) really did everything I could think of, and what I didn't expect was also recognized by her and her colleagues. It did it...

Service: The overall is good, the breakfast has many varieties and tastes good, and the fruits and desserts are particularly good. But the little brother at the entrance of the lobby was a little indifferent, and kept playing with his mobile phone when asking him about things.

Facilities: When the bathroom door opens and closes, it makes a loud noise at a certain angle, like a problem with the hinge, which is a bit scary

Environment: Everything is good. I especially like the outdoor environment of the hotel. There are many beautiful plants and the air is very good. Although I didn't feel the swimming pool, I saw it when I passed by, and it felt very clean. The beach is great, I go to the beach for a long time every day. However, there are chickens on the north side of Building 1. They will start to cry very early every morning. The sound is very resentful and affects sleep. It is recommended to improve

In terms of room, we stayed in a double bed room for the first night, but we wanted to stay in a double bed as much as possible. The next day the front desk helped us upgrade to a double bed with a full sea view. The service that a five-star hotel should have is particularly user-friendly.
Special cocktail drink: It is recommended to try it. It is very delicious. It is included in the Ctrip voucher. Take it back to the room and ask the room to send a bucket of ice cubes to taste slowly in the room.

The room type has been upgraded, facing the sea directly. The environment is very beautiful. There are still many projects in the hotel to participate in. Unfortunately, we did not participate in the hotel activities when we went to the duty-free shop, but Miss Shang Rujuan also arranged free drinks and fruits in the room. Here, I will eat after we come back from the duty-free shop. At night, I went to the swimming pool inside the hotel to play, and the BBQ barbecue at the hotel in the evening is also delicious. There are singers singing and feeling the evening breeze in Sanya. How comfortable is it, in short this experience is very good!

msg:The trip to Sanya during the epidemic is destined to be unforgettable. I came to Hilton Yalong Bay at noon on the 3rd. After adding the housekeeper Jessica's WeChat, the communication was smooth throughout the process. Take us to the check-in room, remind us to do nucleic acid, introduce the characteristics of Yalong Bay and the hotel, and eat oily roast duck and Yangzhi nectar, black tofu, fried rice and so on for two consecutive nights. The point is, if there is no nucleic acid reminder on No. 3, it will be difficult for us to fly smoothly on No. 5, because two nucleic acid tests within 48 hours are necessary. Thank you very much Jessica. On the afternoon of the 4th, I asked about the nucleic acid point in time. The WeChat contact was there for the first time, which made people feel at ease. I followed up the nucleic acid test in a timely manner. In the evening, I went to the comprehensive service center to complete the second nucleic acid test. During the epidemic, the nucleic acid test could not keep up in the afternoon. Every hotel had a headache that day. There was no hospital in the bay, and they could not go out to the St. Bali Hospital for testing. Fortunately, Yalong Bay was finally able to test again. Finally, luckily we flew home at noon on the 5th. Next time, I will go to Sanya again in the off-season. This time, I was very anxious because of the epidemic. I posted in Sanya every day. The room is very close to the beach, and there are many swimming pools in the hotel. It is worth coming again.

msg:The first time I came to Sanya, and it was the first time I booked such an expensive Hilton, a deluxe room of more than 2,700 yuan. I took the key and followed the waiter through the circuitous corridor to the room. Maybe it was because of the old hotel. I saw the difference in room facilities. too big. Fortunately, the manager Xiao Wu's WeChat was added when I checked in, and I responded to him from time to time. For example, although the welcome fruit was given, there was nothing in the five-star standard minibar, even if it was charged, otherwise the refrigerator is just a decoration. Supplies are also slightly cheaper. After slowly getting acquainted with the environment, I feel that the price in Sanya can only be like this. After all, Hilton is considered close to the people in the peak price of five or six thousand. The outside environment is good, and the swimming pool is very reasonable for adults, children and private areas. The next day, a bunch of guests came to the hotel, which led to a queue to enter the restaurant for breakfast, and the bustling experience was a little bit worse. Although there were so many guests, in order to enhance my check-in experience, Xiao Wu changed to a high-rise room with a view of the sea, and the service housekeeper dispelled the unpleasantness of starting to check in. Thank you very much for taking care of Xiao Wu, who has maintained Hilton's reputation very well. If you are dissatisfied with the hotel because of outdated facilities, then a service team like him deserves full marks. May the Hilton brand continue to be more humane in the increasingly fierce competition, and also wish Xiao Wu and Wu Liguo to be the industry leaders in the future, thank you

The whole accommodation experience is average, far from worth the price of 3k. 3k is still a garden view room. If you want to upgrade a sea view room, you will need to add an additional 1100. It feels very stupid and will never live again.
It was the first time I met someone who had to wait in line for breakfast. It was very crowded after 10 minutes. It was like a big market. .
However, the aunt in the guest room I met was very good, and I liked Aunt Wang Xiaojin.

When traveling with children, you just want to enjoy better service and have fun. I think if you are traveling with children, I recommend Yalong Bay Hilton. It is very friendly to children and has many parent-child programs. There is a BBQ on the beach at night. The swimming pool is large and small, which is very attractive to children! Will stay again next time! I hope you all have a pleasant holiday in Sanya like me!

The children's toiletries and booster stools have been arranged. Quite clean. The hotel environment is very good, the management of the swimming pool and the beach is in place, the swimming pool is open until 10 pm, and it is interesting to come back every day to catch the last bus to swim. The temperature is very friendly to children, but the swimming goggles are really foggy. There are storybooks in the package, which are exchanged for 4 copies. The only thing that feels unsatisfactory is the children's project... Our daughter is 6 years old, she has stopped playing this kind of playground, and the projects arranged in each time period are also cost-free and meaningless projects. Really, as a long-term Platinum members who live in Kaiyuan hotels, your projects are really not fun. The requirements for the hotel can basically be met. For example, if we want some vinegar and tableware, we will send them straight away. In general, it is a relatively satisfying trip~

There are also many parent-child elements, such as water parks, children's parks, and outdoor swimming pools of various sizes, which are enough for children to discharge.
The catering is well done. I recommend the Barbecue Kingdom Lawn BBQ buffet at night. Foodies can open their stomachs and enjoy the joy of food. There are also resident singing and Sichuan opera face-changing performances, which are worth experiencing.
Finally, let's talk about the room, which is generally good, after all, the quality of Hilton is guaranteed. There are a few places that need to be complained about. First, it seems that it is a few years old. There is water leakage above the balcony on the second floor, and the clothes hanging at night are all wet. Second, the room near the balcony is a sunken genius design, and you can go down by two steps. ; The third is that the shower door is not closed tightly, and the bathroom floor is full of water after taking a bath.

msg:Because of my work, I am very picky about hotels. Before I came here, I researched and compared again and again. I prefer Yalong Bay. I finally chose Hilton. Ritz, MGM, and Park Hyatt not far away have stayed there.
On the second day of my stay, I was still debating whether to go to Rosewood. I didn't expect an accident in the afternoon to give me a very subversive feeling about the hotel.
We even ate lunch at the Ritz next door. After returning to the hotel, we went to the swimming pool to play for a while, and then went to the beach to experience the safest banana boat. The whole process was very happy. But...get off the boat, it won't work. It may be that some bumps caused the original lumbar spine to suddenly relapse. In an instant, I couldn‚Äôt stand upright on the beach, and I couldn‚Äôt move my legs. The waist is a very important part, and it was very painful to not be able to walk. He walked to the rest area and asked the staff to call a battery car. In less than 5 minutes, the person in charge of the amusement equipment, the staff of the hotel, the supervisor of the housekeeping, and the staff of the concierge depar**ent all arrived at the scene to ask about the situation. I didn't expect them to respond so quickly, and then there was a concierge called Huang Chaohui. The little brother supported me and walked with difficulty to the battery car. The person in charge of Banana Boat also immediately proposed to send me to the hospital. Fortunately, we went to the hospital in time. It was indeed the injury that caused the recurrence of the lumbar intervertebral disc. The person in charge of Banana Boat sent us to the traditional Chinese medicine hospital, accompanied us for the examination, read the report, got the medicine, and sent it to the place for trea**ent, doing his best. Still very impressed.
I didn't expect Hilton's staff and service to be so good. Although it seems that compared with the top hotels, the staff seem to be shy and young, and may not even have a very good background, but when I have the opportunity to contact them, I can feel their enthusiasm. Sincerity, seriousness, carefulness, simplicity... This is the true meaning of service.
No chance to tip everyone, but sincere thanks and praise, from the concierge in the front hall, to the two restaurants on the first floor, to room service, to every part of the hotel, we will definitely come back, and will bring own children.
thanks. wish everyone.

But the Hilton Hotel really makes people feel very comfortable and comfortable! There are many comments that the hotel facilities are old, I think the service quality and attitude of the hotel should be the first choice! Hotel facilities are not what the Internet says old! On the day of check-in, I questioned the room type, and the hotel immediately changed my favorite room for me without any reason! The enthusiasm of the staff keeps me in a good mood! The breakfast is also very rich, especially all kinds of casserole porridge are delicious! Ice cream made me gain a few pounds. Chinese restaurant's Peking duck wall crack recommendation! The only downside is that the beach BBQ was changed indoors due to the rain, but the overall dishes and richness need to be improved! Looking forward to your next stay! Hilton for the perfect vacation. In addition: there is a place next to the deep pool. The sun is not in a perfect place for a day. I lie down and sunbathe every day. Friends who want to know can chat with me privately.

First, before check-in, the hotel will have a customer relationship manager who will add WeChat in advance to understand the special needs and check-in time. My customer relationship manager is MAY. Thank you very much for arranging a room with a good view on the high floor, and assisting in check-in and escorting you into the room Explaining the situation of the hotel, one of the most important aspects of staying in a first-line sea view hotel in Yalong Bay is the service score, here is a full score! Secondly, although the hotel is not the latest, but it is well maintained, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, the balcony is very spacious, the swimming pool layout is very good, the swimming pool is constant temperature, very comfortable.
The quality of the breakfast is also good. Although there are many people in the peak season, it is not crowded at all. The seats will be arranged at the door and the management will be in place. The eldest sister who disturbed the hygiene was also very polite.
Recommended stay, at least 2 nights, holiday bubble hotel first choice!

The service of the butler, Shang Rujuan, was excellent throughout the whole process. It was very caring for all kinds of arrangements and reminders! but! The hotel's dinner, breakfast, one thing is not delicious! Not worth the buffet dinner cost of nearly 300 yuan! In particular, let's talk about the Chinese restaurant in the lightning protection! At noon, 10 people, big and small, went to eat, and we just waited there for 40 minutes without placing an order for us! I bought the üí∞1088 set meal from a certain group. The time was close to 12:30, and the children were starving! I asked the waiter several times and they said the order has been placed! Later, we couldn't wait and said we were going to leave, only to find out when we asked, we didn't even place an order for us! We didn't wait for any apology or explanation from any of the service staff when we went out! Really very rubbish! Afterwards, the housekeeper coordinated in the middle and made up for us a set of hotel afternoon tea! have to say! This afternoon tea is exactly the same as the breakfast cake, even the juice! The toast was still hard! As a whole, apart from the hotel itself, the housekeeper and businessman Rujuan, the rest is really ~ indescribable!

Hilton is the third "five-star" hotel we have stayed at, and it is also where we truly feel the five-star "management" and "service" of the hotel. When we checked in at the counter, we were greeted by a group of dedicated and efficient service staff, who let us check in early at the fastest speed. Wu Liguo, the hotel manager, was always on hand when we encountered difficulties and solved them immediately. The cleaning staff Wang Xiaojin knew that we had a baby, so he specially sent the baby's toiletries, bathrobes, and cute towel shapes that changed every day. The breakfast was varied and innovative, and I also had the Dirty Bun Burger, and the French Fries and Prawn Crackers. There are also several swimming pools, one of which has a bridge made of floating boards, which is challenging, and children and adults have a lot of fun. In just three days, the baby kept saying that he did not want to go back to Shanghai. Thank you Hilton for bringing such wonderful memories to our family. Come back next summer! !

Staying for three nights in a row, the experience is good, the room is a bit old but it is very comfortable to live in. During the day, it is too hot to go to the children's club or bucket kingdom to play. At night, when there is no sun, go to the swimming pool or the beach to play. The children play every day and fall asleep. It's still very cost-effective to miss July and August, and there are not too many people. The first thing that needs to be improved is that the restaurant is a bit small, and you have to wait in line for breakfast; the second is that the swimming pool is a little too sunny and lacks shade.

Fortunately, manager Wu Liguo is very considerate in all aspects. Bed surrounds are prepared in both rooms. It coincides with his birthday and gives a sense of ceremony. The overall experience is beyond expectations. After staying for three nights, I changed to other hotels in Haitang Bay.

It's a pity that the way to the private beach has been blocked due to the current epidemic!
There are many swimming pools in the hotel, but only one is currently open, which is the one closest to the beach!
The entire exterior garden is well done, the scenery is beautiful both day and night!
The room fee of more than 1,000 yuan per day is still worth it!
The breakfast is also very good. There are many varieties and delicious tastes!

msg:I can't remember the first time I came to Hainan for vacation, but I can be sure that this stay at the Hilton Yalong Bay was the most comfortable and fun time I've ever stayed at. Anyone who has lived on that beach has a general overview of the geographical environment and facilities of nearby hotels. It is generally a 5-star hotel with a private beach. The establishment of the hotel is not short! The hardware conditions are almost the same, and the fight is a service. Honestly, the Hilton Hotel room service really surprised me this time. Before departure, I unexpectedly received a greeting call from the hotel, confirming the itinerary with me and asking if there are any special needs for check-in! Later, the hotel WeChat butler was added, and it was later learned that it was the manager of the hotel customer Wu Liguo. From the simple greeting before departure, the warm reminder of the weather and temperature, to the daily greeting after check-in, take the initiative to ask what you need, and if you need it, it will be delivered quickly. Although I only live in an ordinary room, I feel that I enjoy the trea**ent of VIP customers, and there is a 24-hour all-weather butler's caring service! Another thing that makes me satisfied is that the children had a great time at Hilton! Although many hotels play parent-child cards, it is difficult to find a hotel that can arrange full parent-child activities all day from 10.00-19.00 seven days a week (the activity schedule can be seen in the picture below). There are even half-care and full-care winter camp classes, so that parents and mothers can be completely liberated and have time to do what they like! I am also very satisfied with the room service of the hotel, thank the waiter Zeng Hailan for her careful cleaning! The breakfast at the hotel is quite rich, and the restaurant is decorated with a very Chinese New Year a**osphere. During the period, there are clown performances, and there are countless children's fans! If I stay in Yalong Bay next time, I will choose Jinmao Hilton!

During the Spring Festival holiday in 2022, I temporarily decided to come to Sanya. I booked the hotel and air ticket two days in advance, and chose the Yalong Bay Hilton Hotel by mistake. When I came here, I found that it exceeded my expectations. It is very suitable for bringing children. The room is basically full during the Spring Festival. Status, but the service is not discounted at all. This is too difficult for hotel management. We took our children to stay for three nights in a row. On the last day, the room called to ask if there is any need to improve the experience of the stay. Where to improve, all aspects are excellent, the service is very good (breakfast restaurant, room cleaning, children's playground, pool staff, etc. are all great) Had a pleasant Spring Festival holiday here.

üöó Transportation: Yalong Bay is relatively convenient, there are many businesses outside, and you can eat, drink and play.
üçÉEnvironment: The hotel environment has nothing to say, it is beautiful. There are several conjoined swimming pools and a heated swimming pool. In winter, the baby will not be afraid of catching a cold when swimming. The only thing that doesn't bother me is that renting a swimming ring costs 30 per hour, and other hotels don't charge any fees... I gave you 4 vouchers for 200 marine items. The routine is very deep. You have to choose 3 items to play together before you can use one. The price You know, because the yacht went out to play before and the weather was cold, so I stopped playing, but fortunately there is a banana boat, which can really be experienced for 5 minutes for free, which can be regarded as a benefit.
The hotel's children's playground is located in Building 5, and it is very clean. You must wear socks to enter.
Bucket Kingdom is actually a parent-child restaurant, 299 per person, not an amu*****t park, the coupons given in exchange are 2 postcards...
üîîService: I would like to thank Zhong Caimei, the room attendant, and the lobby manager (in white clothes) for preparing the room in advance. Unlike some hotels that let us check in late, the hygiene is very clean for us, even if we add an extra bed, it is very fast , did not delay our time to play, and finally gave the children some gifts, so that the children returned with a reward.

The child did not eat breakfast in time and also added a packing service, which is very considerate! Special praiseüëç Feeling at home, service first, this is the best way to reflect the soft power of a high-end hotel!
      The hotel rooms are well-equipped, clean and comfortable, the public environment is clean and elegant, the garden landscape is beautiful, black swans and egrets dance by the lake ~ The eight swimming pools are scattered, and tourists are welcome to swim and play at any time ~ Look up and see: the private beach is like a huge sapphire Inlaid on the crown!
      The hotel has prepared a series of "Bucket Kingdom" games for children - small productions, small crafts, clown show, crab catching by the sea and a series of games. Children have a lot of fun playing games, swimming and digging sand!
       The children say goodbye, we also bid farewell to the beautiful and warm Hilton, unforgettable this period of joy, unforgettable this beautiful encounter, we will have a future!

The Bucket Kingdom and Children's Paradise are their favorites, and there are also many water activities in the swimming pool. Although Yalong Bay as a whole is no longer comparable to Haitang Bay. But if you want to walk your baby and lie down, it is still recommended.

Except for the location, I can't compliment this hotel, and the later experience is even more speechless. During the breakfast, almost all the staff Guests are not reminded to wear masks when taking meals, and the hotel facilities are old, it is estimated that it is old, the elevator leading to the guest room has broken down several times, and no reminder is given when the elevator is faulty, and the equipment in the children's playground is also faulty. I booked a superior panoramic sea view room. The music played downstairs for three consecutive nights was very noisy. The complaints were invalid for many times. I called the Hilton headquarters and asked the manager on duty to quibble and say that music is needed to sell drinks. The music continued until nearly 10:30, and then the withdrawal equipment was added, and it didn't stop until the early morning. I can't believe this is a five-star hotel with a well-known brand. The management is so chaotic. The manager on duty and the complaint handling afterwards are extremely arrogant. It is estimated that this hotel will be delisted sooner or later. , I hope everyone will consider staying here carefully, I really feel depressed this time üòí, can such a hotel be blinded by a location and a signboard, so I have to give you a friendly reminder, I hope you don‚Äôt like I'm stepping on the pit like this...

msg:This is the first time I gave a bad review. I booked a deluxe garden view room for almost 2000 a night. When I arrived at the hotel, I was stunned. Is there a toilet opposite my room? The room in the yard behind me is completely different from the picture. It is not even a four star. The toilet is in the east of the room, which is too small to describe. The bath is in the west near the balcony. It is said that there are two types of deluxe rooms, but we only recognize pictures, which are completely different from the pictures. Isn't this a complete fraud? You buy goods A and give me goods B. The hotel service is also very poor, because I didn't bring an ID card. Is it good to carry one ball bag and two suitcases? Why didn't you tell me to download it on my phone? Don't tell me you don't understand, there is also a beach buffet, more than 500 people, five of us, I invited friends to eat, it's too bad, Xiao Aulong is cut hard, and finally there is a casserole dish, an hour and a half The reason is that the wind is too strong, and the red wine is even more rubbish. My friend told me not to drink it, because I was afraid that it would hurt my body. After eating a meal of more than 2,000, I was lonely and finally ran outside. I ate a bowl of dumplings, a garbage hotel, don't make a reservation, it's too garbage, the delivery speed is super slow, the toiletries are used by the Samsung hotel, it's not worth it, don't make a reservation, and will not come again,

msg:"Lying flat" is the most enjoyable +Plus way of vacation in Sanya. When I came here for the New Year this time, I was in the hotel to sunbathe, read a book, exercise, and be in a daze.

Hilton Yalong Bay has its own exclusive bay. The sand is like flour, as fine as the real thing. It is full of coral sand. It is not separated at all. In the morning and evening, you can blow the sea breeze on the deck chairs and look at the beautiful scenery. The sea is very pleasant. No matter which angle you shoot üé¨, it‚Äôs easy to make a blockbuster, just like a postcard, a photo taken on the beach, like traveling all over Sanya, don‚Äôt feel too good about it, I‚Äôm crazy in love, on the water Exercise is also abundant.

[Location] Yalong Bay is also a place where hotels gather. Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Pullman, and Marriott are all in a pile. It is 45 minutes from the airport and about 120 yuan by car.

[Landscape] The green plants are too lush and the air is fresh, like living in a garden~ It is very suitable for a family to live in. The garden-style school design is really beautiful. It is worthy of being the spot for shooting in the variety show "Romantic Journey of Wife", on the beach It's all a blockbuster, and it's really good and beautiful.

[Pool room] Because we are on the first floor, we wake up every morning and bathe in the first rays of the sun and swim for a while (there are 8 swimming pools, and there is a constant temperature swimming pool) refreshed, the environment is absolutely OK

[Fitness Center] Together with the spa villas, waterfalls and black swan side by side, the gym is facing the lake with a wide view, watching the black swan swimming in the lake, I believe many people are planted by this scene Bar!
If you want to take a nice breakfast on the balcony, remember that it is best to choose Building 4 and Building 8. The "full ocean view room" is recommended.

   The conclusion is one, just rush to the right, everyone quickly punch in! Invincible romance!

msg:First of all, I would like to praise Casper-Zhong. I added WeChat before I checked in. The reply was timely and responsive. The suggestion was pertinent and professional. Thank him very much! Then I started to get to the point, a hotel that I visited last year, I didn't expect the experience to be so bad this year. The scenery is still good, but the room facilities are a lot older. In addition to the aging of the hardware, the door card that affects the experience is often not easy to use, and the small number always drops. The holiday started with a blue-clothed waiter who frowned angrily from beginning to end in the breakfast room. There were indeed quite a lot of customers, but the staff gave me the feeling of panic, anxiety and irritability. Giving Huan yelled at the guests, as if he was teaching children a lesson, and I had to explode on the spot. The quality of the guests is also low. During the meal, the mother with the child kept talking loudly about lapapa, and some people packed tea cups from their own bottles. The tea cups in the restaurant were very small, and her big pot wanted to be filled. After a long time, the people who ate at the scene stood behind her and watched her pick up the cups. When pouring it, they accidentally spilled the hot tea on the ground and smashed the people around. The cleaning staff put the employee card in my room. This is a card that can open all rooms. It was just inserted in my room. I deliberately did not speak, just wanted to see such a serious problem. When will it be discovered , As a result, no one came to look for this card until I checked out, it was stuck on the wall, even if the cleaning came the next day, it was incredible, this security issue is really worrying! The last point is the farce that happened to me by the pool, a Chinese girl and her foreign boyfriend, sunbathing at first, and then it can't go on. Want our shady place, it's ridiculous, this hotel is your private place ? Then the girl found the staff of the hotel and went to cry in reverse. As a result, the staff of the hotel was indiscriminate, and the first sentence she came over was to let us leave. I'm really shocked, I really want to ask your staff is it a police officer or a judge, are you here to try me? Even if the judge wants to look at the evidence, or at least listen to the testimony of both parties, you didn't ask us a word about what's going on, just to see if there is a woman crying for you and a foreigner will let us go? Just wanted to ask you why! Angrily, I took out my mobile phone and recorded the video. The employee saw me filming him and then changed his mind and said that he was just understanding the situation. It was alright, and what the girl said might not be right. Oh, I'm so speechless. Later, I also complained about this matter, and the reply from the manager on duty the next day was neither painful nor itchy. There was no formal apology. It was just a misunderstanding. I was not deaf. Where is the misunderstanding! Finally, I would like to praise the hotel's Casper-Zhong again. If this trip to Hilton is not up to standard, then Zhong's service can be said to be full marks, which can be said to be incompatible with the overall a**osphere of the hotel. Thank him very much. It can be said that the itinerary these days is too bad.

msg:Yalong Bay Hilton is a good experience. The butler Mr. Wu Liguo is very satisfied with the arrangement. The Ritz-Carlton, who came to live last time, struggled for a long time. Mr. said that I would like to live in another hotel. I visited this hotel first. After all, Hilton's standard cannot be too wrong. The hotels near Yalong Bay are not new anyway, but the location is very important. When you come to Sanya, hotels are very important, especially I am a lazy person, facing the sea, drinking coffee and blowing the sea breeze is the most important thing. The weather in December does not require air conditioning. The balcony door is open at night, and the breeze is very comfortable. Bring my mother to live here next time.

The hotel has its own beach, and you can go to the beach in a bathrobe.
It is very suitable for leisure and vacation, lying in the hotel and watching the scenery without doing anything.
In particular, the service is very warm. I was received by Casper, who was very warm. I have been patiently answering various questions and will provide me with strategies.
The other staff in the hotel would take the initiative to greet guests when they saw them, so they were very polite.
Moreover, this hotel has a lot of children's activities, and it is also very suitable for bringing children over.

msg:Located in Yalong Bay, the location is still very good. The rooms we booked are the most basic, plus it is true that the Yalong Bay Hotel has been around for some years, so don't have too high expectations. But the cleanliness is okay. The guest room made by Lv Haimei and Xiao Xiaoyan, the room supervisor, is very clean. Children's toiletries are very complete. Before arriving at the hotel, Merry added WeChat, very enthusiastic introduction and proactively asking for suggestions.
In fact, the most dissatisfied was the service staff in the breakfast department. In the morning, a girl led us in to find a seat, but was temporarily called by other guests to get tissues, and then another guest called to ask questions. It seems that we have forgotten our existence. Our family of three stayed there like ****** and waited for her to come back. As a result, they started to work on other things. I was really stunned. Is this the standard of Hilton's service? ! I really will only live this time. It doesn't matter if the room is old, at least the old five-star service should be online, it's almost as fast as it is. In addition, the breakfast tableware is only for chopsticks, and other knives, forks and spoons must be taken by themselves if needed.
The breakfast is quite rich, the soup noodles are very rich, and there are also chocolate breads that the family loves.

msg:Yalong Bay Hilton did not disappoint me. I read a lot of comments and worried. Long-term use of Ctrip. There are several techniques for reading reviews. According to the opening time, look at the total number of reviews, the points of negative reviews and the percentage of total reviews. Basically it can be determined.
Parent-child I love Yalong Bay the most. There are many beach activities and friendly to children. There are shells on the beach and the waves are relatively small. The hotel focuses on parenting.
For couples, Haitang Bay is better. The sand on the beach is fine and picturesque. You can watch the sunrise. There are no shells on the beach. Suitable for taking pictures.

üöó Transportation: Ctrip has a free bus at the arrival hall 5, and there are taxis and online car-hailing queues when leaving the hotel. Out of the hotel for a supper, the nearest Dongrong is 800 meters away, and there is a free shuttle bus for calling.

üßπSanitation: clean and comfortable. The facilities are a bit old, but from the lobby to the swimming pool. From the room to the balcony, you can feel the details of paying attention to hygiene. The maintenance of buildings and gardens is also better than that of the neighboring houses.

üçÉEnvironment: as shown in the picture. What you see is what you get. I want to talk about the Bucket Kingdom Restaurant, it is really worth experiencing. The package size is also large.

üîîService: In old hotels, the focus is on service. The foundation of service is communication. Many negative reviews are also based on communication. In fact, I make a lot of phone calls every day in the hotel for help. Commonly used towels, water, charging cable, map, and ask about the activity time. They are brought over quickly. This is difficult. For the uncommon ones, take photos, send something to eat, a specific pillow, how thick a quilt, send a courier, and pick up something. All cooperate fully. Especially Alex Su from Housing keeping and Kitty Wang from Floor manager are very good. The children are very happy.
There is a small suggestion. When you come back from the swimming pool in Building No. 3, there are two openings under the building. The front is the toilet and the back is the elevator hall. It may be a mistake that the logo is not conspicuous.

msg:I only want to make the most authentic comments on this stay, and I hope to avoid lightning for all the friends who are coming to Sanya for vacation.
This is the third time we have come to Sanya this year. Because it was a trip that was temporarily decided a few days ago, the hotel we wanted to book before did not have the desired room type. In comparison, we chose the Hilton's deluxe sea view room because the Marriott next to it. I have stayed with the Ritz Carlton before and both were very good. Therefore, I think Hilton is also a five-star, even if there are negative reviews, it cannot fully represent the image of the hotel, and the hotel also specially called the day before the trip to ask for some requirements for this stay. I said that there is no need to trouble others, just I need to help me reserve the floor as high as possible to be relatively quiet. If not, I can arrange a room with a better view of the sea. The hotel said that it must be arranged well, and also informed in advance that the view is the best. Building 1, 5th floor, just check in when you arrive. So far I thought it would be a very successful trip, but from the moment I stayed at this hotel, it became a nigh**are.
When we arrived at the hotel it was past two in the afternoon, knowing that the room was not cleaned up, so we decided to stroll around the garden first, and also told the front desk that we could wait and didn't care. Then the front desk told us that the room reserved before was checked in by the gold card, and it may take three o'clock to check out, so it will be late when we check in, so we need to accept the room transfer, and keep saying that we may not be able to live in this room . After brainwashing, we exchanged rooms in Building 7 and told us that the view is also the best. We are still told that we can wait for the previous room, no! It's just that you won't be allowed to stay, and suddenly it becomes the room you selected before and the tenant continues to stay. You can only live in this one. So we moved from the middle building to the corner, and it took five or six minutes to walk to the front desk. As soon as I entered the room, the sun was very dazzling, and the balcony faced west. It was impossible to stay in the room for an entire afternoon without drawing the curtains, let alone sitting on the balcony. In addition, the curtains are still broken, and the gap in the middle can't be closed at all. Because I was too tired to catch the early flight, I didn't care because I didn't think it was a big deal. I didn't find the sewer in the shower room was blocked until I came back at night to take a shower and went to bed. I flushed it in five minutes. After taking a shower, the stagnant water covered my feet and started to slip. The bathroom has always smelled bad in the room. In addition, the third picture below shows you the glass door that only appears in express hotels. I lost a mouthful of hair after using the toothbrush, my god is this Hilton? Disposable utensils are not as fast as they are. After washing, I found that the hygiene of the room was very poor. There were toothpaste stains left by the superior tenants brushing their teeth on the ground, and there were water stains near the bathtub sewer. Then as the Interstellar Hotel, the minibar is all empty, even if you charge it, you at least put it on it. At 7:52 in the morning of the next day, I could hear one after another that the hotel rooms started to go to work. The cleaning aunt did not know what resen**ent started to make noise. The hotel chairs and tables were all solid wood, and the floor was tiled. Sounds crazy enough to sleep in on vacation? dream! Because the hotel can not return and can only change rooms. The lobby manager personally called and said that he must change a satisfactory room from Building 123, so he waited until the afternoon to change rooms and changed to Building 4! ? ? ? What is the meaning? Changed from one corner to the other, and in the weather of almost 30 degrees, we had to pull the box from the east to the west, and the room was not even as good as the previous one. But this time I did upgrade to a suite, but I don't know why I just don't understand my appeal. My appeal is quietness and a good view, not a white suite. Below the newly changed room is an activity group whose sound is deafening, so I continued to ask the customer service to continue changing, this time I finally finally got a good room, and the sea view and the garden are beautiful. (The last picture is the normal landscape in the publicity photo. ) but the mood was completely broken, because the hotel did not say sorry from beginning to end although the hotel responded positively to adjust the room. Until now, I once doubted whether the room type that the hotel gave me was the same as the one I booked. The hotel is so popular because this beach is beautiful, but there is no need to choose this place to see the sea. Other hotels are fine, at least they are newer than Hilton, and the experience is better. The hotel's breakfast tastes good, but the guide is chaotic, and the seats are grabbed by the guests themselves. The hotel's parent-child programs are visually good, because there are no children, so I have no experience, but it seems that the children are having more fun.
The two nights stay is summed up as follows:
    1. It is a flaw that the room is not soundproof. Generally, the room type is not soundproof, but the suite is still not soundproof. If you drag stools in other rooms, your room will be particularly noisy. If you want to live comfortably, book a villa.
    2. The price of this Hilton can't match his package and service, the five-star price, and the standard of a fast store.
    3. I don't know where the difference is between the premium sea view, deluxe sea view and a series of sea view rooms, it feels pure gimmick. But the view of the suite is really beautiful. If you book other sea view room types, it is recommended to talk to the hotel in advance to reserve 123 buildings, or you might as well stay.
    4. The attitude of the hotel to solve the problem is good, and the action is still positive, but it still makes up for the problem of the hotel itself. In Yalong Bay, the price/performance ratio is extremely low, at least not the Hilton in everyone's perception, and it is really not recommended.
    5. When I returned to the hotel in the evening, I found that all the teams in the lobby were waiting for check-in, making a lot of noise. The check-in experience can be imagined.
But I sincerely commend Ctrip's customer service for following up and solving it in a timely manner. Without them, I feel that the room change would not be so smooth. If all of the above problems happened because we were unlucky enough to put on this room then we would have nothing to say. But this trip became very bad because of Hilton, a very bad start. that's it!

msg:Comment on the two aspects, good and bad, from service, hotel facilities, beach experience, and room meals.

1. Service-good, but can be improved
The day before I checked in, I received a call from the hotel and arranged for Cody Wu Liguo, a full-time account manager, to connect with me on WeChat, and asked about my personal needs, such as the requirements for the scenery, the demand for smoking rooms, etc., carefully, and finally in advance Helped me lock the high-floor room with the best view.
*Need to improve: don't **** the ****s on big Sunday morning; the staff in the park can smile and greet more to make the holiday atmosphere more warm

2. Hotel facilities-partly aging, but through the service to make up
In the sea-view room I stayed in, I found that the bath salt was not placed, and the toilet paper was only in the bathroom, so I had to go to the bathroom to get a piece of paper; only one set of toiletries was provided. ; The shower head and bathtub really need to be replaced or maintained. The shower head is scaled and the bathtub is broken, which makes me unhappy. The toilet does not have a descending device, which is very scary when it is put down. Fortunately, the manager helped me coordinate in time, upgraded my room with a better view, and upgraded the quality of service. Like again for the service

3. Beach‚Äî‚ÄîThe sand is fine and the sea is beautiful, but the chairs are too close and there are vendors who solicit customers
The coast of Yalong Bay is great, but the hotel chairs are close, and there is a lack of privacy. Friends who mind should pay attention to it and hope the hotel can improve it; soliciting guests~ there is no way, after all, it belongs to the public beach.

4. Room meals-very good and adequate
Ordering in the room, eating on the balcony feels very good, the portion is very generous.

Summary suggestions (hope the hotel can see):
1. Enter the room, there can be a welcome message on the TV to welcome XX and XX to stay in the hotel; if there is aromatherapy, the atmosphere will be better. And it can be done half an hour before guests check in
1. The price of a room in winter should be proportional to the grade of toiletries prepared, instead of using cheap things in summer
2. Showers, bathtubs and other equipment really need maintenance; the toilet should be equipped with a descending device
3. Don't **** the ****s on Sunday morning, the noise is loud; the service staff of the park should smile and greet more
4. Toiletries should not be double-labeled. The brands should be the same, so that the first time guests have a good feeling, and only then will they have a good impression of Hilton, so that they can bring new things and return to consumption.
5. Adjust the spacing of the beach seats. If you can, open up a little beach area where you can order food, and at the same time, it can be separated from other foreign tourists (the neighboring Marriott has it). I hope the hotel can improve, and this time supporting Manager Wu deserves a five-star rating!

msg:Five-star hotel, the configuration of the express hotel, I went to the hotel and asked the staff any questions, but I didn‚Äôt know. I asked where is the children‚Äôs playground. I asked 2 people and didn‚Äôt know where it was. It is small, very shallow, and the toilet is super small, and I left the room. I made sure that the baseball cap and shampoo left in the room were contacted by the hotel, and it was said that I could not find it. In short, staying at St. Regis, MGM, Ritz, Hilton really disappointed me. The price of more than 1,000, the service and hardware facilities simply do not match.

msg:üçÉEnvironment: The hotel environment is very good, and there are many swimming pools. It is especially suitable for taking pictures. It is also very clean. It is only planted with good vegetation. Then there are deck chairs near the beach. There are also some online celebrities taking pictures, such as the bird‚Äôs nest and the hotel‚Äôs. The view of the room is also great~ the picture is the photo taken from the room~ It is very close to the beach, and it is really cool in the Sanya House Hotel in winter.

üîîService: Special recognition service! ! ! Two days before arriving at the hotel, the Guest Relations Depar**ent began to contact Zhong Xu and proactively contacted in advance to communicate details and inquire about the arrival time. As soon as I got off the bus, I picked up my luggage and sent it to the front desk for check-in. The room type was upgraded to a deluxe sea view room. There were detailed communication arrangements between check-in hotels and asked about the accommodation experience, including feedback on minor issues. , Air conditioning and refrigeration are not enough to be actively dealt with, arrange the master to adjust it, it must be a five-point praise, Zhong Xu‚Äôs little friend, the detail service is super, and when we checked out on the last day, we learned that the flight was late, and the front desk colleague Alan also did it for us. Late check-out of the room ~ and the service staff in the hotel will greet you. When you come for breakfast, you should also take the initiative to ask if you need tea or coffee, and clean up the tableware in time. When I used afternoon tea on the last day, because it took time to prepare afternoon tea, the afternoon tea in the lobby bar was also upgraded and turned into a Ferris wheel package photo, which is worthwhile.

üßπHygienic: The hotel is an old international five-star hotel, but it is well maintained, and the stay is very comfortable. After the bathroom is cleaned, the shower water pressure is also very suitable.

üç± Meals: The hotel‚Äôs meals are great, with a rich variety of breakfasts, from bread, salad, Chinese hot dishes, and rice noodles, all of which have local specialties. Moreover, the consumption of hotels and restaurants, as well as the price of afternoon tea, feel that the price/performance ratio is very high. The point is that the quantity is too large, it is completely supported, and the bread for breakfast is freshly baked and delicious üòã

üöó Transportation: If you park or take a taxi at the hotel, it is very convenient, the English is lazy, and there is no shuttle bus to go to the duty-free shop for shopping

Overall it was a great holiday, a great experience, I will go to the hotel again next time, all five points of praise~

Every employee treats the children very kindly, especially to praise Huang Xiupai and Li Ping, who are earnestly with the children, enthusiastic and patient, the children are very happy to play, and the parents are also very relieved. The breakfast at the hotel is complete and good in all aspects. The swimming pools are abundant, equipped with lifeguards, clean and safe. Generally speaking, I was not disappointed, and the children were reluctant to leave the store. I would recommend it to relatives and friends in the future.

msg:The comprehensive index is fairly high hotel!
This National Day holiday is 9 days!
Choose to stay at Yalong Bay Hilton Hotel for four nights from 10/1-5.
In May, I went to Yalong Bay and stayed at Pullman diagonally across from Hilton. After dinner, I wanted to take a walk after dinner and plan to find an option for my stay in October. I am deeply attracted by the children's swimming pools, facilities, private beaches, bucket kingdoms, and cars that can be taken at night. So I booked this early in June, and it was the longest stay in this trip!
And, and, recommended to friends to stay here at the same time, spend a vacation together!
Before the epidemic, it must be a holiday abroad, Thailand must go once a year! The fourth time in Sanya!
Let me talk about the first feeling of the hotel first!
1‚É£Ô∏èFirst of all, we were on an early flight and arrived at the hotel before about 12 o'clock. The front desk helped me arrange a luxurious view room on the first floor with access to the swimming pool! This room type is very satisfactory. A 5-year-old baby can easily travel between the pool and the room. It is highly recommended.
ü•∏You can refer to the room type photos!
The first one is the floor plan of the hotel! We live on the first floor of Building 5‚É£Ô∏è.
There was a beach party on the 1st, and the two missed a few thousand yuan! Had a beautiful night with a family of three friends! Not many people, not crowded. The dishes are ok, and there are drinks to choose from. We don‚Äôt drink to the extent of a toast!
2‚É£Ô∏èBreakfast! Very important role!
It's almost the same as a general five-star hotel meal! However, after 8:30 it is slightly crowded! Line up at the door! We went for breakfast earlier than 7 o'clock and it was very comfortable. The restaurant feels messy around 10 o'clock! many people!
üèÅü§®ü§®ü§® There is one thing I must complain about! I stay at a resort hotel at least 5 times a year. The first time I am asked to eat breakfast, I need to bring my room card to joke. I say: Some people will eat well, and I will give the room card to others to eat again! ! ! I ate it four times and didn't take it four times. It was really unintentional and I didn't have this habit at all. Bring one when you come out, and I‚Äôll tell you otherwise, I‚Äôll send you that one after I finish eating.
I think it's possible that the hotel has a system because it really happened! I hope everyone will not be like this, let us have a comfortable and trusting vacation!
3‚É£Ô∏èChildren's activities!
There is a picture of the children's activity schedule. Of course, they are all different. But haha changing the soup does not change the medicine. Basically the same! There are crane cranes, small activities in the children‚Äôs entertainment room, archery, and small experiments. There are also paid itemsü§™
I went to dig a little crab at night! The service is really ok, and the uncles and aunts are gentle and responsible! üëç
There is a place for children to play in the water behind the children‚Äôs activity room, and behind the first floor of Building 5‚É£Ô∏è (see the first picture)
ü§®ü§®ü§® Don't bother to complain again, old! Just one word!
There is a bubble line up in a small pool, no music, no a**osphere, hastily! Hope the hotel will improve. Other Sanya hotels also have bubble queues, we will really compare!
4‚É£Ô∏èDining!
The place for breakfast is a coffee shop! I ordered Hainanese chicken in the cafe on the day of arrival, üò≠ don‚Äôt try it! ! !
The Chinese restaurant opposite, good things! delicious! You can try!
5‚É£Ô∏èBucket Kingdom!
Tried the evening buffet once! Make me unforgettable! !
ü§®ü§®ü§®The dishes are not good at 7 o'clock. Many customers are waiting for vacancies!
üëçCheck out the next day, communicate with colleagues in the customer relations depar**ent and get a very satisfactory solution!
And several times to call to confirm the details, I am very satisfied with the service and super extra points!
There is no doubt that this service is well done! After I return to Shanghai, I will call me the final solution result.
‚ùóÔ∏èTo sum up the comments, I feel all five days and four nights!
Although some of the hotel facilities are aging, but the service standard can keep up.
Whether it is good or not, it depends on the price of your reservation, and you can measure the price/performance ratio!
October 1‚É£Ô∏èYou understand! Expensive is so messed up that different people have different opinions in these few hours.
In general, I give high scores!
You can check in and experience it!

msg:Bring children and the elderly to Sanya for vacation, and choose to stay at Hilton Yalong Bay for 4 days. This is mainly because this hotel is a parent-child hotel, and some minor problems after check-in are actively solved by the hotel, such as adding electric mosquito coils to the room and giving toilet water, etc., which effectively solved the problem of mosquito bites we just arrived. Here is a big like üëç

üòâThe hotel has 8 swimming pools, you can choose different swimming pools. There is also a swimming pool with a beach, and children can dig sand in the swimming pool, which is especially fun. In addition, there is a swimming pool with a depth of 0.8 meters, and children who are only 2 years old can enjoy it. There is also an adult water slide and a children water slide in the swimming pool, so the whole family can have fun.

üòÉ There is also a children's playground in the hotel. It is divided into an indoor naughty castle and an outdoor water spray area. When the noon is hot, children can play indoors, and they can also play on the water seesaw outdoors. The baby is crazy to play.

üòãThe breakfast in the hotel for 4 days was very good, very rich, and the taste is what we like. We also ordered a beach buffet dinner. There is no need to talk about the scenery. You can sit and eat while watching the sea. In the evening, you can listen to the melodious and moving singing of the resident singing and eat the delicious food. It is worth mentioning that the lamb skewers at the dinner buffet are super delicious. My parents have eaten a lot, and it is not easy to get the recognition of the whole family.

ü•≥In terms of hygiene of the room, especially the waiter Fu Meiqin, the service is in place and caring, and the room is cleaned very cleanly. I took two elderly people and a 2-year-old child. She often asked if we needed any help. We felt like we were at home.

‚ò∫Ô∏èThe hotel service staff, Zhao Wulin, was very attentive. Because it was a night flight, he also helped us with late check-out and added WeChat to make us feel cared.

üåàüåàIn general, during the 4 days staying at Hilton, the children had a great time, the elderly were very satisfied, and I could feel the warm and thoughtful service of the hotel staff everywhere. There are many unwillingness to leave Sanya soon. The Hilton Hotel is one of them. I hope that when I come back next year, I can choose the Hilton Hotel to feel this kind of home away from home.

It is worth mentioning that a cleaning aunt named Su Hongmei, who is very attentive and full of enthusiasm to do cleaning work, but always meticulously doing ordinary jobs, so that we young people who are escaping the pressure of the city are very encouraged. Aunt Su Hongmei learns professionalism!

msg:I didn‚Äôt have the first time to take pictures, the room was messy üòù I stayed at two hotels in Hainan this time, Hilton and Atlantis. The kids prefer Hilton because they have a lot of activities for children. We went there just a few days ago. It rains, and the swimming pool outside will get a little cold after a long time. Fortunately, there are activities in the children's playground. The children are not bored at all and are very happy. At Hilton, we tried two room types, a whole house cartoon (picture 1-5) and a full sea view room (6-10). It is more recommended for a family with children to live in the whole house cartoon. The room is larger and has a 2m bed. , A small 1.2-meter bed, it is more spacious to live in. Moreover, the color scheme of the whole house cartoon is brighter and looks newer. After all, Hilton as a whole is some years old, and the decoration and furniture will be a bit old, but the whole house cartoon will be much better. If you want to live in a room with a full sea view, you must choose 3 floors and above. The first and second floors will be blocked by pillars, so the sight line is not particularly good. In addition, the sea-view room may be a bit damp because it is close to the sea, making it uncomfortable to sleep. In addition, I especially want to praise Hilton‚Äôs room service. I read the reviews of various five-star hotels before I came here. There will be more or less bad reviews. At that time, I also complained about Hilton‚Äôs service. I was a little nervous before I checked in. I felt very good after I came. Yeah, the customer service housekeeper responded in a very timely manner, and they were able to help solve the problems. The service staff were also very good. They would take the initiative to inquire about the needs. The room service Zhou Xiaona gave the children a small animal with a towel and gave them a small gift before leaving. The guy is very happy. There is also a room service staff with short hair and a round face. He does things very neatly and is very nice. It is a pity that he forgot to ask her name. Sanya will come to Hilton in the future. (Another advantage of Yalong Bay than Haitang Bay is that you can swim in the sea. This time the baby is crazy to play)

Soon after I booked the room, the hotel staff contacted me to confirm the reservation information and asked if I needed to make some decorations for the room. It was very considerate! Before arriving at the hotel, I felt the service of Hilton, which made me remember her name (Guest Relations Director) Emma. Later, after we added WeChat, Emma sent me the hours of the hotel‚Äôs business locations and taught me how to do so. I booked a bus to go to the duty-free shop. When I arrived at the hotel, I found that she helped me upgrade my room to a deluxe ocean view room. The view is indeed beautiful. Thank you. "Buddha jumps over the wall" is really the most unpalatable thing I have ever eaten. I didn't take my heart at all. What I want to complain about is that this hotel is financially rigid! ! ! If you want to enjoy employee benefits and discounts on meals at sister hotels, this hotel must use an employee ID to prove your identity. Our hotel does not need an employee ID! Others who can prove their employees' identity do not recognize that they require an employee ID, so they are very speechless! I can't forge an employee certificate for you. I hope you can improve and be more flexible. After all, the rules are that the dead are alive, and the consumer experience is also very important. I didn't see the net celebrity glass boat a little bit lost, the others are pretty good.

The child's bed is really very small. It fell on the floor a few times. This room type is very tasteless. The children's bed is purely a decoration. The most unbearable thing is that there are a lot of ants that have crawled into the milk powder. It is super disgusting. With the headlights on, no ants are found, and I don't know if the child has drunk ants. It is absolutely impossible to go with children.

üßπSanitation: They are all very clean, the public areas are always cleaned, and the rooms are also clean.

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel is relatively old, there must be no new hotel with a sense of design, but overall it is okay. Mainly to bring children, children can play in the children's pool area, children's playground (indoor and outdoor), this weather must choose indoor, suitable for children under 10 years old, it will be boring even older, there are many children's recreation in the hotel Activities, staying for two days will not feel okay, you can arrange it all.

Room: The deluxe room we booked was upgraded to a children‚Äôs room for free.


üîîService: I have to boast, the service is really good, especially the girl named merry, who has been in contact with me since I landed, asking me when I will arrive and then pick me up in the lobby, take me to the room, and send it to my hotel The activity table and dining information, helped me make reservations for recreational activities, and also helped me to check out late. In short, the service attitude is first-rate. I don‚Äôt know if this service is provided by anyone or only Ctrip VIPs. In short, thank you very much for this girl.

In short, if you bring a baby, it is quite recommended.

You can also walk to the Forest Park and the public in Yalong Bay. The area can be directly walked past.

2. The housekeeper Zhong Xu has a warm attitude, the arranged room is high in floor, and the visual effect is good, too lazy to find a hotel, stayed for 4 nights.

3. It is best to go early for hotel breakfast! It is estimated to be off-season, the variety and taste of breakfast needs a lot of improvement! The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is a bit lowered by the hotel‚Äôs brand! Hope the breakfast will change next time!

It‚Äôs very beautiful and there are many kinds of swimming pools. Children have fun. You can rent a swimming ring by yourself. There is an indoor children‚Äôs playground.
Our family room has a very large children‚Äôs room and there are many dolls. There are children‚Äôs books and you can play basketball. There is a children‚Äôs TV and bathroom. The cartoon theme is very cute.
The hotel is very close to the beach. The sand is soft and the sea water is particularly blue. You can play in the water. You can also pay for water projects.
Check-in and check-out did not wait too long, the efficiency is still ok
Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings. The hotel has been built for a long time, so I feel that the restaurant facilities and decoration are a bit outdated.
The variety of breakfast is not rich enough, of course the quality is okay
The service staff is obviously insufficient. Sometimes people in the lobby except the front desk staff are not easy to find people to ask for guidance.
There are no small gifts like meeting gifts for children in the family room.
Parent-child support needs to be improved
The overall stay is good
The service staff is still very friendly

The welcome fruit that should be delivered has not been delivered by 10 o'clock in the evening, will it not be delivered if you don‚Äôt call to ask; 5. Ask the service staff of the hotel if you ask about what to eat at the barrel kingdom at night. They are all newcomers who have just arrived; 6. They asked for bed-sharing, but no one came to deal with it every few hours until night; 7. As an old 5-star hotel, it didn't get GRO. The above problems are coordinated and handled by contacting Manager Chen. I am satisfied with the results of the trea**ent. The timeliness and initiative of Manager Chen's services are very good. Hope that the hotel can strengthen the sense of active service.

After reviewing the reviews and comparison, I finally chose this globally-acclaimed Hilton, and I felt that I chose this hotel to stay. That's right! The view of the full sea view room is very good. It is really close to the sea. I think it is the best sea view room in Yalong Bay (see picture). The entire hotel is very large, with luxurious and low-key Chinese interior design coupled with a very modern outdoor swimming pool garden design, which is even more beautiful! There are many large and small swimming pools with different depths. The deepest one is 1.5 meters, which is very suitable for different groups of people such as children and adults. Where there is no shortage, there is too little shade on the swimming pool. Swimming in the sun at noon is still very dry!
      Check-in was quick, and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. Thanks to the hotel guests Ashley‚Äôs enthusiastic and thoughtful service. She personally took us to stay and introduced the hotel‚Äôs various facilities and services. We also handled a late check-out service. As long as there is a problem, we can help us solve it in time! Thanks again for Ashley's service! ! üëç
     The hotel's breakfast is ok, relatively rich, that is, there are more people at 8-9, and sometimes you need to queue up. The dishes are not bad. The hotel's SPA is also very good, but a bit expensive. Bucket Kingdom, it's okay, you can eat and play with children, but it is not recommended for children over 8 years old. The hotel is really close to the sea. There are beach toys provided by the hotel for free, as well as beach volleyball and football. I played a game of football with my kids ‚öΩÔ∏è, very enjoyable!

msg:Because it is a sea-view suite for family trips. As a result, when the child was dressed the next night, one cockroach ran out of the quilt of the extra bed, and one was on the other side of the big bed. At that time, I felt disgusting. It was already past 10 o‚Äôclock in the evening. Although the children wanted to sleep, they called the front desk and called someone to deal with the matter. Someone came and took a cell phone to take a picture of it, but didn‚Äôt see the cockroach and gave it to the front desk. Hit it. I said you have to deal with it, but I called the manager. The manager meant to disinfect and clean us. I was very upset at the time. Shouldn't we change our room? After all, the cockroaches came out of the quilt, and we didn't eat anything in the bed. The explanation to me was that it is normal to have insects in the tropics. I said that it was a cockroach. The manager also said that other people might eat takeaway, and then there were cockroaches. Finally, we arranged an ordinary garden-view room on the same floor. At the time, I thought it didn't matter, anyway, I had to arrange the child to sleep in the door. They let us wait for more than 10 minutes to clean up. When I took the child to sleep, I was going to the bathroom and found another bug in the bathtub. It was just cleaned. I was really speechless for the sanitary conditions. I contacted the manager just now, and she said otherwise Let me change the room for you. I said that I don‚Äôt want to take the kids with me anymore, but I hope you can do it well in the sanitation. After 3 days, we don‚Äôt want to live in a suite anymore. If you change it to a normal room, the manager may think they have it. We were upgraded to a superior sea view room for the badly done place. The result was okay the first two nights. I went for breakfast the morning of check-out and came back. There was something leaking on the roof of the room because it happened to be opened when I was checking out. Yes, it happened to be leaking inside the suitcase, it was really speechless. By the way, the breakfast is really average. It can't be compared with the breakfasts of other hotels along the Yalong Bay. There are few choices and the taste is not good. This stay is really a bad experience.

I was disappointed and stayed at Crowne Plaza Yanlord. , MGM, and then staying at Hilton, I feel the difference, there are too many invisible consumption, and the service is very neglectful, even if I make suggestions to the hotel, the hotel will ignore it, it seems that the unhappiness of a guest is not important... Hotel management directly affects the stay. Rate it, Yanlord Crown goes every year, and the rooms are full every year. MGM is also much more lively.

msg:My friend said that the best way to go for a parent-child trip in Sanya is to "soak in a shop", so finding a proper hotel is half the success of the strategy. Before I went, I had been hesitating among several first-line hotels in Yalong Bay, such as Tianyu and MGM, and finally booked Jinmao Hilton. My personal experience also proved the wisdom of this choice! Hilton initially attracted me to the low-key and quaint indoor Chinese design and the highly modern outdoor swimming pool garden design. This contrasting design blends together without any sense of abruptness. Instead, while presenting their superior beauty, they are in terms of structure and function. Fully humanized, it is a comfortable experience of A+. If bedding, dining, and first-line sea view are necessary in the qualified line, the amazing thing about Hilton is the various types of swimming pools dotted in the store, where children can soak in the pool. Much more time than going to the sea!
        Of course, the hardware is not as amazing as the software blessing. The hotel's service concept and the professional affinity of the staff are the highlights that really make people feel at home and feel at home. What I want to thank the most is Stephen at the front desk, after seeing our family traveling. We thoughtfully upgraded our room. The summer room rate was really admirable. I only booked the cheapest room. I didn‚Äôt expect that Stephen would not only give us a free upgrade, but he was also willing to listen patiently and meet our nagging requirements: Nothing but nothing. Buildings, no corners, no back sun, rooms that can face the sun, dry clothes, and have a good line of sight... üëç In addition, the hotel provides free children‚Äôs experience activities throughout the day. My baby went to experience handmade soap and sandwich making, and eat and eat. Children who play are naturally the happiest!

msg:This is the most rubbish hotel I have stayed in Sanya. I had booked for two days and checked out after staying for one day. From the very beginning, it was not good to check in the female service intern. The hotel was very unreasonable. We stayed in Building 3 from the lobby to Building 3. It was a bit unhappy and unreasonable at the time. Forget it, we arrived in the room. The sanitation is well cleaned, and the air conditioner is really rubbish. Maybe the last air conditioner we stayed in was too good and felt too cool. When we arrived at Hilton, the contrast was too big. The refrigerator in the room was broken because we bought fresh milk. Putting in the refrigerator, I was disappointed at the time. There was still a problem with the room. When I went to bed at night, I found the heavy oily smell of men‚Äôs head from the pillow, which made me sick and speechless. The hotel has very few facilities in the courtyard. The parent-child hotel that is said to be the number one has nothing to do. The courtyard is a decadent, but a bucket kingdom is better. It is not at the same level as MGM. The price is more expensive than MGM. There are no more activities. , There are no more facilities. There is also a little bit of sandbags from the courtyard to the beach without steps. It is really inconvenient to bring children down to the beach. I ate dinner in Fengyuan in the garden. After eating, I went to the toilet next to Fengyuan. I collapsed as soon as I went in. The paper in the trash can next to the washbasin was piled up into a hill. There was paper on the floor, and the toilet was all around the toilet. Urinating is the same for both. Whether or not the customers are too unqualified, other hotels will also encounter this situation, but your cleaning is too late, and the toilet smells too much. I got here for the first half of the day. I had breakfast in the queue the next morning. I came to Sanya so many times and stayed in so many hotels. The first time I queued for breakfast, my heart collapsed. The waiter said that we were full of people. There are no people in other hotels. There are so many hotels that you have a lot of people. In the final analysis, the restaurant is small and the breakfast is too crowded. You have to wait 7.8 minutes for the start of the poached egg, and only a kind of fried vegetables is not made up. I decided to stop living here and check out early. The experience is really bad. Is it uncomfortable to spend this money at MGM? It‚Äôs not comfortable for the kids to play well and there are many facilities. I really don‚Äôt know if Hilton is good. Support.

msg:I saw in the comments that the service of this hotel is not good. I think others are exaggerating.
But when I checked in, I really felt that the service was mediocre
First of all, the mirror in the room looked very dirty when I checked in, but it was still very snowy after the waiter wiped it!
The next morning at breakfast the waiter took us to a table I put breakfast on it and then went to eat and get other food and wait for me to come back I put something out of the table and sit at another table! I was very hungry at the time, which really affected my mood!
Hygiene Auntie Su Hongmei is good. She is very careful about hygiene.
The experience is really bad!

msg:The overall management of this Hilton is terrible, probably busy on New Year's Day, and most of the waiters are impatient, not to mention hospitable. Ctrip reserved a package in advance, and the check-in will be wrong; several waiters in the restaurant are rude, and they don‚Äôt know when they ask three questions; the 4-day room card is invalid the next day, and it takes nearly 30 minutes to contact the door several times for complaints; Manager, I started to find a young boy who didn't have time to call back, and even threw the phone directly, which really subverted the attitude and perception of five-star hotels. Finally, the manager on duty came, with a perfunctory attitude, and was proud to inform the hotel that Ctrip got a full score, and the current 100% occupancy, probably because you loved it, and of course there will be no follow-up feedback to you. There is no harm if there is no comparison. I lived in Shangri-La, Haitang Bay a few days ago, and the services and hardware, including the 30-degree constant temperature of the main swimming pool, are more suitable for parents and children. This childcare service is probably ok. Will not stay again.

msg:Let me first explain the reasons for this score:
1. The room facilities are old, but the overall is still online. Yalong Bay hotels are generally old, this is expected.
2. There is no indoor swimming pool. The outdoor heated swimming pool is a children's swimming pool. Because of the sand at the bottom of the pool, the swimming pool is cloudy. Nor is it a deduction.
3. When booking, it was because there was no room for separate booking, so I had to buy a package, and the price was much more expensive than direct booking. After a comparison, there are more services: swimming pool moon boat photo (5 free + vlog), cocktail set, afternoon tea set, lunch set, balcony breakfast, etc.
4. The swimming pool moon boat photo package is a third-party service. The photographer is very motivated to take a lot of photos. I hope that guests can choose more photos. After all, you need to pay for more than 5 photos. But I have a camera myself, and I took a lot of pictures. My only appeal is to photograph the moon boat. But the attitude of the photographer, I feel that I do not want to shoot in the swimming pool. In the end, I just took a few group photos.
5. Breakfast on the balcony is the time to make an appoin**ent with the food and beverage depar**ent in advance to deliver the meal to the room. I made an appoin**ent for nine o'clock and planned to go to the hospital for nucleic acid testing after the meal. As a result, it wasn't until about 9:20, after I called three times in a row, that the waiter delivered the meal out of breath. I myself am sorry. Because my urging went directly to the waiter. But I think it's a matter of hotel management process at all. Every guest has an appoin**ent, so what is the meaning of appoin**ent?
6. On the last day, I exchanged the afternoon tea set at the poolside restaurant around 14:45. The original plan was to finish the meal in 40 minutes anyway, and then make a reservation for the shuttle bus to arrive. As a result, 40 minutes after ordering, the food has not been served. And there are still 2 meals in the making. I can't understand, is the back chef doing all the ordering alone?
7. On the night of check-in, ask the switchboard about the specific content of the lunch package and how to use the meal coupon. The switchboard replied uninformed and went to the front desk. The front desk phone went unanswered. Use the room phone to call, the front desk is still unanswered. The switchboard said to answer me after inquiring, and continued to wait for more than 20 minutes, but no one paid attention. Eventually I found the manager on duty and the manager replied. After that, the restaurant replied to me, which was completely inconsistent with what the duty manager replied. In the end I didn't ask, and in the end I didn't use it either.

All the above evaluations are responsible.
I can understand some things, but I can't understand how most situations arise. For example, the front desk does not answer room calls, does not know the specific content and usage of the package vouchers provided in the hotel, and the production time of afternoon tea is so long, etc...
During this period, I had some feedback with the guest director, and they did send me fruit. It's not a problem with one individual hotel employee, it's a problem with the entire hotel. In short, I am very, very, very disappointed with this stay. There have been many problems that should not have arisen. The hotel's busy occupancy rate is high, and the service will be reduced. I don't think guests need to bear these. I will never turn down this hotel.

The rooms on the third floor are not recommended (because all the corridors and corridors are on the third floor, and everyone passes through the corridors on the third floor, so the rooms on the third floor are noisy, and the rooms on other floors are good). The room on the first floor is good, and it is more convenient to go to the beach. The fly in the oin**ent is that the check-in at the front desk is slow and there is a long queue. Fortunately, there was a dedicated butler to help with check-in, and while waiting for the room, a soft drink coupon for the cafe was sent. The roast duck on the first floor is more authentic and recommended.

Of course, it seems to be a wise choice now (it‚Äôs not that the other two are bad, but I think Hilton does a good job). The day before I arrived, I received a call from the Hilton staff and arranged manager Casper-Zhong as a personal butler. I have to say that this kind of service is really great! Special thanks to Casper-Manager Zhong. With his help, it is very convenient to check in. You don‚Äôt even need to check in at the front desk. When we came back after eating out and shopping, Manager Zhong had already waited for a long time at the hotel‚Äôs gate and gave me the room card. And we specially arranged the honeymoon arrangement for us, and also gave us an extra breakfast.
The rooms are clean and transparent, and the layout is very comfortable. Although it is an old hotel, the facilities are not as old as others say.
The breakfast is very rich, Chinese, Western, Japanese, European dim sum, everything is available, foodies must not be lazy, go early, and queue up late.
There are 4-5 large and small swimming pools, and I didn't count them. The water temperature is comfortable and very comfortable. And you can go directly to the private beach through the swimming pool, so you can enjoy the tranquility!
This trip to Sanya is more beautiful because of the Hilton Hotel

msg:The price increase was almost twice during the Dragon Boat Festival. The lady at the front desk was pretty good. After staying for three nights, we were free of extra bed charges. We checked in at three o‚Äôclock. Our flight was earlier. After lunch, it was past two o‚Äôclock, the housekeeper the day before. Wx will be added. After we arrive at the hotel, we will arrange check-in in advance. Ask him in advance to help us arrange a room with a better view. The view on the fifth floor is good~

advantage:
1. Although the decoration of the hotel is not new, the overall holiday style is still very good. There is a door that leads directly to the bathroom next to the room entrance. There is a small lounge chair space connected to the bathroom. There is no need to bring sand into the house. , I like the wall-mounted makeup mirror in the bathroom, which can be stretched and rotated at will to adjust the angle, so you don‚Äôt have to be afraid to move the chair to the window for makeup

2. The bed and bedding are very comfortable and can sleep well. It seems to be sold in the lobby. I regret not going to see it. I don‚Äôt know what brand it is.

3. Sound insulation is very good, worthy of a parent-child hotel, you can hear the children in the next room in the corridor, you can't hear it at all when you enter the room, and you can really sleep all day when you close the curtains

4. There are no mosquitoes. I was worried about the comments. I didn‚Äôt get bitten in the house or in the swimming pool. The mosquito repellent was useless. The balcony glass windows also have warm tips to prevent mosquitoes.

5. There are many types of breakfast, Chinese and Western foods are available and rich. It can be seen that it is not just a casual mess. The bread is soft and soft. It is delicious. The last day I ate Ding'an powder is really delicious. The previous day seemed to be holding Luo powder. , Regret not tasting

6. The hotel staff are very kind as a whole. Most of them will say hello when they meet in the corridor. I feel that female staff are more kind than men. The room cleaning aunts are also very enthusiastic and responsive. During the day, you can see staff in the pool area for maintenance. It is true under the flames. Pretty hard

7. The swimming pool is clean and the depths are different. I like the swimming pool with sandy beach. There will be security guards at the swimming pool at ten o'clock in the evening. If it is a little dangerous, it will blow the whistle hh

Disadvantages:
1. On the beach, there are vendors who sell photos and coconut milk walking back and forth. Although they refuse, they will not be disturbed, but they still feel that they are not quiet and comfortable enough.

2. I saw a cockroach in the room, it was a bit disgusting, but I've been very happy these few days, so the hotel should take anti-insect measures.

2. The toilet and shower room door and the toilet cover are not cushioned, they just squeak, and they are shocked. Be careful every time you close the door.

3. The breakfast restaurant is not big enough. You have to queue up at nine o'clock. There is not enough space. Parent-child hotels are mostly with children, so it is very noisy. I heard that there is only one breakfast restaurant in the eight buildings of the hotel, which is too unreasonable, and there are also types of breakfast. Hope to add more local specialties and snacks in Sanya

msg:Zhong Xu from the Guest Services Depar**ent is very attentive. But the Recreation Depar**ent is just a joke, saying that there is a custody service. When it came time to make an appoin**ent, the person in charge told me that if the custody needs to be taken from other areas and notify colleagues who have been on vacation to work overtime to take care of the children , a bunch of this crap, is it putting pressure on me? After hearing it, it concluded that there is no need for hosting. It is recommended not to engage in childcare services without this diamond. The overall facilities are very old, the swimming pool is understaffed, and you have to travel far to order something, and the waiters are too busy. There are geckos in the room. The bathroom is small and the decoration is outdated. PS: One disposable cup is four yuan. The experience was pretty bad.

When you check out at the western restaurant of the hotel, you can get discounts for membership card discounts, and the waiter does not remind you. When you add 15% service fee, you are very positive. Because I was in a hurry when I left, the child's body wash and mosquito repellent landed in the hotel, and I didn't call to confirm whether anything was left. Will not choose this again next time.

Because I had to catch a flight the next day, I thought of coming to Yalong Bay to play, so I hurriedly booked this hotel. The experience is really bad. In stark contrast to several hotel itineraries in Haitang Bay

The room facilities are old and there are many mosquitoes at night
It takes more than 10 minutes to walk for a meal
I still added more than 200 for breakfast, which is too bad. Many things are cold and there are few types.
I came here because of his children's playground, but I was told that I couldn't play.
I have stayed in so many Hiltons, this is the worst experience

In 90 minutes, only one person from the engineering depar**ent came to confirm that there was a problem with the air conditioner. If it wasn't for the elderly and children traveling with them, they would have to change it immediately. The impulse of the hotel.
     Went for breakfast the next day, walked into the back of the kitchen by mistake, and there were cockroaches all over the aisle.
      As a platinum member of Ctrip, the image of this hotel is very poor, the service is mediocre, and it is not recommended to stay.
