Therefore, I specifically selected the Kavi Fairmont Hotel with a unique architectural style and "wood culture" for them in the last three days of the 8-night 7-day itinerary. Yes, as you can see, we have been deeply impressed by the beautiful beach scenery, Yuexuan Restaurant, travel photography service, and room service, especially Judy and Á¨¶Â£´Ëç£. I believe I will come here again next time to continue my exciting experience.

The management is unbelievable. Really 5 star service. Greated from my arrival, was given a tour of the unique property. The property actually look so much better than the picture.
The manager is excellent. The staff are too. They made everytthing possible. They can do for you amaxing cocktails and the Italian food is great. And everything is farily priced, not like some of the neighboors hotel. 

I would go back again for sure. Thanks a lot for the great stay

msg:The service at this hotel is second to none.  The staff was exceptional and the thoughtful detail were very much appreciated. Communication with the hotel before, during and after our stay was excellent and it was so helpful to have so many people around who spoke English. 

We travelled as a family with an 11 month old. When we first arrived she was greeted right away and given a plush monkey that she held onto the whole trip. The crib was great and children‚Äôs amenities such as toiletries, a robe and slippers were added in our room for herÔºåwhich was such a nice bonus. The kids play zone and library were spotless and so well taken care of. It is open everyday from 9am-9pm and if the perfect place to go to take a break from the sun or in our case the rain. 

Emily in the executive lounge took excellent care of us and was always so kind and welcoming.  Wine, cocktails and cider are available during happy hour. It would be nice to also have beer as an option as well as a little more variety from one day to the next.

Vedat the general manager was very open to feedback and quickly made changes when possible. With this kind of mindset the hotel will quickly become one of the best in Sanya. 

If you are a young family who is looking for a calm relaxing holiday this is a great option.

Some things to keep in mind: 

Hotel is really only surrounded by other 5* hotels so not many other food options available.

Haitang Bay is gorgeous and is perfect if you like to walk the beach but swimming is not allowed.

msg:I want to first thank the excellent team at Fairmont Sanya for taking such good care of my family and I during our stay. From the very first greeting upon arrival through to the kind service during check-in and throughout our stay I can safely say this is a top notch experience overall. Especially grateful to Vedat Yildirim and the team that took care of us when we were met with the unfortunate experience of having to leave this great hotel and go to a quarantine! (we had a close contact case with someone on the airplane on the way to Sanya).

Generally speaking we over index on 'facilities' and 'hardware' and under-index when it comes to 'service'. The smile you receive from staff, the helpful hand to carry things or point out others. It just makes a world of difference. And also it is the HARDEST thing to improve. It takes a lot of effort to train staff, to build a culture of courtesy and really deliver something that feels 5-star. 

For comparison, I have been to just about every single major hotel in Sanya (Rosewood, JW, Edition, Park Hyatt, Ritz Carlton, ... ) and I think only the Ritz Carlton can compare when I'm talking about the software/service of an experience. Something that makes you feel you are being taken care of. Yes, Edition is 'trendier', yes Park Hyatt has a nicer beach... but honestly - I'm kinda tired of overhyped hotels full of fake-KOLs taking selfies (I'm looking at you Rosewood. Stay at Rosewood and see if A) the bar is open or B) even if all their restaurants open - they don't have enough competent or trained staff. It's just the reality.) 

So I'll definitely be considering other Fairmont hotels in the future for business travel and return trips to Sanya.

msg:We stayed at Fairmont for 4 days, each one of which was an absolutely wonderful experience. The hotel is totally new and overall the environment and its facilities look fancy and beautifully decorated, with a mixed of modern and traditional Chinese style -specially the lobby is just breathtaking-. But in our opinion, the main value of the hotel is its absolutely perfect service and all their lovely staff, who literally does everything possible to make your stay perfect: in our case, I spent my birthday there, and everyone had so many details to make my day just unforgettable (an outstanding dinner, a spa session, some details on the bedroom and even flowers for my girlfriend!) ; special mention to Emily, who arranged all surprises and activities for us in such lovely manner, and the singing guys from the bar, who even came along to sing at my dinner on their day off. Thanks!! Breakfast is also delicious and abundant, and the rooms are quite wide, luminous and exquisitely decorated, with great variety of amenities. 
The beach by the hotel looks great and quite close to access; a pity that you cannot swim there because of the waves. 
The only small drawback was the laundry service: there is no cost specified on the hotel guide and we were quite surprised of the expensive amount charged just for a tiny bag of clothes; however, they were helpful when explained the situation and gave us half price discount, so no big deal. 

Overall, an amazing experience and totally recommended hotel if visiting Sanya. Don‚Äôt miss the chance to go! We will certainly do so.

The hotel has a high green coverage, the park is very large, and it is not far from the beach. Every staff member of the hotel greeted me warmly and helped to delay the check-out time. When I checked in at the lobby, I saw that the decoration of the lobby was also very beautiful. The design of golden nanmu is very distinctive. The cruise ship and the small river are also a major feature of the hotel. Because of the rain, I didn't see the sunset ceremony, which is a little regretful. I hope I can see it next time I come [happy][happy]

The golden nanmu decoration in the lobby is really shocking. The Chinese luxury is indeed unique. The park is very large and the green coverage rate is very high. The Venice cruise and the Li sunset ceremony are very beautiful. I recorded the iron flower project throughout the whole process, which was very shocking. I have a better understanding of the local ethnic minorities. There are still many hotel projects. The surfing art museum is very fun, enough to relieve the fatigue of the entire journey without leaving the hotel. Lulu, the guest relations classmate, contacted me one day in advance and helped me to book many projects. The service is very considerate. It can be said that it is a perfect exclamation mark for my trip to Sanya. I will definitely come back to stay again next time~ and the hotel staff are very warm and thoughtful. I just don‚Äôt want to leave!

Good environment, good attitude, relatively new facilities, but the swimming pool is a little small. As long as the staff met in the hotel, regardless of gender, age or age, they all greeted the children with a smile. Water and fruit are unlimited every day. Although I can't eat too much, the service awareness is worth the price. Compared with a certain hotel where I stayed for two days later, it is really a world of difference. When checking in, I was upgraded to a sea view room for free, and the children were very happy. The hotel also has a lot of breakfast varieties, and the buffet dinner included in the package is also very good. The children also like the boat ignition activity very much. It is a good experience. I will go again next time.

There were not many people on Saturday morning, but the variety and quality of breakfast were all online. The buffet side table was clean and the service was also very good. The chef personally introduced the breakfast varieties, which far exceeded MGM and Aotuge. In addition, the hotel's environmental protection concept is very good. Whether it is drinking water in the guest room, writing paper or straws in the restaurant, they are all made of biodegradable and environmentally friendly materials. The linen tablecloth on the dining table, the trash can in the guest room, and the tissue box are also made of environmentally friendly materials. Finally, the hotel activities are also very meaningful. Thanks to Xiao Jin and Huang Hong from the housekeeping depar**ent for their service. I will come again next time.

I booked a three-day hotel at first, mainly because the overall feeling and style are very similar to the Southeast Asian style I like. At the same time, there are a lot of activities in the hotel, which is very suitable for lying down. Later, I stayed for two more days because of Eva Li Xia's professionalism. I felt happy here. Because I was traveling alone, I expressed that I was more concerned about privacy. The room arranged by Eva completely met my needs, and the staff also sent me a screen. At the same time, they also provided travel guides and hotel activities during these few days, allowing me to see beautiful sunsets, sunrises and fire dance shows during these few days. At the same time, I would like to thank the room cleaning staff for cleaning the room in time and providing night bed service during these few days, which was a thoughtful and responsive service. The swimming pool is also very comfortable, and there are dry blankets available at any time, so there is no need to worry about the impact of rain. There is a sunset bar next to the beach, where you can go to watch a movie and lie on a camping chair at night.

Remind us to pay attention to insect prevention and eating, drinking and having fun around. It is a very professional hotel service housekeeper.
This time I came mainly for business trips and office work. Fairmont is very suitable for work. It is relatively quiet. After breakfast in the morning, you can start a lot of work in the room!
Next time you come to Sanya, continue to come here. The sunset ceremony and boat cruise experience in the evening are also full of rituals!

msg:Full of surprises. I added Butler Xiao Yang on WeChat when I checked in. He always greeted us, answered all my questions, helped us a lot, and was very professional, especially the room he arranged, which had a great sea view. I was very satisfied with every part of the hotel, the breakfast was good, the performance was great, there was a sunset ceremony and a Li ethnic group fire dance show in the evening, and the room was very clean, so I stayed for 2 more days and was very satisfied.

msg:The hotel is very nice. Good location, close to the beach, across the sea from Wuzhizhou Island. The whole hotel is beautiful, with a water system like Venice, and you can take a boat around the hotel. The hotel also has a helipad, a golf course, and a wood art gallery! Accommodation supplies are complete, and there is also a balcony bathing pool, which is very high-end. In general, the hotel is of high quality, beautiful environment, good service, quiet and comfortable accommodation, and very delicious breakfast. Highly recommended!

msg:Environment: I'm lucky to have left Fairmont for my May Day holiday. I haven't been out since I checked in. The feeling of seeing the tropical rainforest every step of the way is very suitable for relaxation. (The picture feels more intuitive)

Service: The beauty Nicole Xiaohu arranged this check-in in an orderly manner. She would send a message in advance to remind each activity before it started. Her attitude was friendly and she even helped me, a nap star, to delay check-out. It was wonderful~

Room service Ms. Liu Yawei was also very attentive. I accidentally bumped my leg, so she immediately brought me alcohol swabs, iodophor swabs and Yunnan Baiyao spray. She also gave me snacks in the evening.

The boat ride was also a wonderful experience. Oil-paper umbrellas were prepared for guests, and the staff even offered to help me take photos. There was no need to share a table or boat with others just because I came alone. For people like me who occasionally need to take a selfie It's so considerate.

The travel photography experience I received was also great ~ there was no hard sell at all, the photographer was very good at taking photos and produced great results.

Overall, I have been crazy about Amway for my friends and family in the past few days since I moved in. We will definitely meet againüå∑ (a perfect birthday gift for myself, I wish myself a happy birthday one day in advanceüêæ)

Good service, because I brought an old and a child, I booked a suite, and the price was reduced on June 18, which is really a good deal. The housekeeper Elaine contacted me one day in advance, confirmed the activities to play, and helped to arrange them properly. I was very happy. Really, I couldn't play in one day, I should have stayed one more day. The suite has gold service, and Miss Tian Shuang's service is enthusiastic, which makes our whole family feel very good. I didn't expect that the afternoon tea is also very rich. It is not far from Wuzhizhou Island. Good reviews.

Thanks to Miss Luo for helping to follow up until the evening when there was a minor problem with the air conditioner. She kept asking if there were any other services needed. She answered all the questions. Fairmont's breakfast was the richest among the three hotels we stayed in. In the end, the children said they wanted to come back to stay.

msg:For hotel packages booked on Ctrip, a housekeeper will contact you two days before check-in. Our housekeeper is Qianqian, who is super nice. She sent us all the hotel facilities and entertainment activities in advance and helped us make reservations. She would ask about our rest every day, whether the room needs cleaning, and whether there is anything missing. She is very attentive and takes good care of us.
Ôøº
The room is Chinese style, with a large space and a balcony where you can see the coconut lawn of the hotel.

The breakfast is very rich, and there are no children, probably because it is off-season. You can sit outside to have breakfast, with water, lawn, antique pavilion, and coconut trees. Ôøº

The overall style of the hotel is very quiet, with tropical style and Venetian-style boats. The entire water system runs through the entire hotel, and you can take a boat tour. The large lawn is very good for taking pictures. If you walk further away, there is also a beach and you can step on the water by the sea.

The hotel has fire dance performances and sunset ceremonies at night. It is very romantic to watch the sunset in the hotel's swimming pool in the evening.

After adding WeChat, Pite shared the hotel's travel guide with us and reminded us of the time to play very considerately. There is a sunset check-in point at the entrance of the hotel, which is super beautiful and super photogenic. Sisters who like to check in and take pictures must not miss it. The hotel's sunset ceremony and fire dance show are so ceremonial, you must check in. There are many kinds of breakfast and they taste very good. The main thing is that Fairmont's breakfast is open until 11:00, which is very friendly for people who want to sleep in on vacation! Pite also helped us coordinate and arranged to check in on the dragon boat. It's so photogenic~ Thank you very much for Pite's help. I felt the VIP trea**ent. One day was too hasty. There are still many beautiful scenery in the hotel that I didn't enjoy. Next time, I will stay a few more days to enjoy the beautiful scenery and service here.

msg:I decided to go to Sanya on short notice. When I booked this hotel, I was quite nervous because I saw many negative reviews. However, I still booked this hotel because I liked the Chinese style and the canal. After I went there, I felt that I should not trust the reviews too much. It may be that everyone likes different styles. I like this hotel very much and cannot understand how these negative reviews came from. The service attitude and facilities are very good. The staff has a very good attitude. After arriving in Sanya, a young lady added me on WeChat and replied immediately if I had any questions. When I was on a cruise, I couldn't find a place, so I just asked a cleaning aunt. The aunt was very enthusiastic and took us to the destination. There were also many activities, including a mysterious sunset ceremony and dance performances. Due to the hot weather, I didn't take my sister to participate in children's activities. The comments said that it was far from the beach, but there were cars dedicated to pick up and drop off. The hotel was also very beautiful, with solid wood carvings everywhere. It was a kind of beauty that revealed Chinese heritage. I like this hotel very much. My sister said she would stay in this hotel next time she comes.

msg:I booked 2 nights, 1 night in a garden room and 1 night in a Jinzun Deluxe Suite. I was very satisfied. The environment of Fairmont was indeed beyond my expectations. It was a bit like the style of Raffles Clearwater Bay. It was indeed a hotel of the Accor Group. The hollow sandalwood was very delicate, and the tall coconut trees and the river were full of strong Southeast Asian flavor. I really liked this feeling of being close to nature. The hotel was also close to the beach. There were many breakfast options, very rich, and there was also a self-service Qingbuliang!

I highly recommend everyone to experience the Jinzun service, which was extremely considerate, meticulous and comprehensive. It also gave away many items (cruise, travel photography, welcome fruit, afternoon tea, cocktails, performances, etc.). Thanks to the private butler [Xiao Jin] who has been following up on the itinerary, and the parasol that fell in Hainan was also sent back to me. I also received a gift from the room service, thank you [Liu Yawei]. Recommend everyone to stay~

The golden nanmu decoration in the lobby was really shocking. The Chinese luxury is indeed unique. The park is very large, with a high green coverage rate. The Venice cruise and the Li sunset ceremony are very beautiful. I recorded the whole process of the iron flower project, which was very shocking. I have a better understanding of the local ethnic minorities. There are still many hotel projects. The surfing art gallery is very fun, enough to relieve the fatigue of the entire journey without leaving the hotel. Sanya is now in the rainy season. I have chased the sunset many times but ended regretfully. I didn‚Äôt expect to see it here. It is the best gift Fairmont gave me. Because I entered this place, it can be said that it put a perfect exclamation mark on my trip to Sanya. I will definitely come back to stay again next time. Special thanks to Lulu from the guest relations. She is very responsible, responds quickly, is patient and meticulous throughout the process, and arranges very well. Thank her very much

msg:It was my first time traveling alone in my life, and I just went. I came here for the weekend to visit the duty-free shop. I fell in love with the hotel at first sight. It was worthy of me. The milky white building was very retro, and the garden was full of scenery. It was a combination of fashionable and simple French style + Southeast Asian style, a combination of Chinese and Western styles. The housekeeper mechanism was good. The housekeeper Jinmei contacted me shortly after I placed the order. Any small questions during the trip could be answered. Thank you Joly.
Advantages: 1. The public areas, especially the buildings, are beautiful. The style of the whole manor makes people fall in love with the pictures in a second. The environment is pleasant, and the appearance of the house and the Yunhe River that passes through are the characteristics; 2. The breakfast is still good; 3. The service system is rigorous.
Others: 1. The guest room is far from the lobby; 2. It was very late when I returned to the hotel, but I found that there was no delicious seafood barbecue takeaway around and I could only pick it up at the drop-off area. I suggest everyone go to the night market stalls a little further away.
Regrets: 1. Time was tight, so I didn‚Äôt go to the beach; 2. I didn‚Äôt experience the Yunhe cruise and travel photography, and I will make up for it next time.
I will still consider Fairmont in my options in the future. I hope it gets better and better.

msg:I stayed in Sanya for a month, and this is the most satisfying hotel I have stayed in Sanya. I am glad that I escaped from Yalong Bay Marriott and chose Fairmont. In comparison, Yalong Bay Marriott is too bad, too bad, small and low, and the food is very bad! Fairmont is the only hotel on the island except Raffles that has the charm of Bali hotels. As soon as I arrived at the hotel, I found that it was a treasure. The hotel lobby is really elegant and graceful, because it is made of special logs, and it has a modern feel with old money style. Especially the section where the lobby extends to the observation deck and the underground corridor restaurant is really beautiful. The general disadvantage of Sanya hotel landscape is the lack of drop and level. Unlike Bali, the dense tropical rainforest is built with cliffs and drops, which is comparable to a fairyland. The end-viewing tower of the lobby of Fairmont can take you back to Bali in an instant. It is so beautiful to look out. The hotel has the culture of the Li ethnic group and is designed as a small Venice. The gondola is so beautiful. The water in Venice is constantly circulating and filtered, so it is not smelly and is much better than the water in real Venice. Hotel guests can make an appoin**ent to take a boat every day. Because it is off-season, the hotel is very generous and will take the initiative to upgrade the room type for guests. Compared with Marriott's stinginess (collecting a deposit of 1,000 yuan per day, charging for all minibars, and promoting plastic water cups for children), Fairmont is quite generous. No deposit, all drinks and snacks in the minibar are free, and they are replenished unlimitedly every day. Even at one end of the walking corridor, there will be several free Sanya specialty ice drinks for guests to enjoy. Check-in can be early according to the cleaning of the room (Marriott generally cannot get the room card before 3:30 pm). All the staff of Fairmont are very nice and take the initiative to greet, smile, and be enthusiastic. The staff is well equipped. The hotel covers a large area. If you don't want to walk, you can call 0 to call for a battery car to pick you up at any time. The hotel swimming pool is very large and beautiful, with a maximum depth of 1.5 meters and a minimum shallowness of 20 meters, which meets the needs of everyone (Marriott is very small, with a maximum depth of less than 1.2 meters, which cannot be used by adults and is a children's paddling pool). The hotel has its own historical old house. The original version of Du Yuesheng Mansion was moved from Shanghai to Fairmont, which is worth visiting. There are also many ancient log architectural carvings that can be savored one by one. The hotel has its own huge golf course. The green is particularly beautiful against the backdrop of special plants. The hotel should have a helicopter üöÅ. In March and April, the sea water in Haitang Bay is calmer than that in Yalong Bay. The hotel has its own beach. The sand on the beach is more delicate and smooth than that in Yalong Bay. It is very worth experiencing and absolutely good for taking pictures. The hotel has rich meals, which are renewed every day, and you will not get tired of eating them for basically a week. The buffet dinner at the same price is twice as rich as Marriott, with barbecue and hot pot. There are 6 dining tables in the evening, and there are live food production performances in the middle. The hotel's sunset ceremony at 6:30 every day is worth participating. The hotel's toiletries are all environmentally friendly, including toothpaste, toothbrushes and purified water, which is commendable. The hotel is the most cost-effective and treasured hotel in Sanya!

üëâHotel environmentüëà
Along the central axis of the lobby public area, the hotel rooms and other functional areas are arranged on both sides. The green area is very large, with large tracts of coconut trees. The Venice waterway should be a loop that shuttles through the hotel, adding more layers to the hotel.

üëâHotel Funüëà
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èLi Fire Dance Show/Fire Dance ShowüíØ is highly recommended, better than many large amusement parks and ethnic tourism performances. The dancing of several kinds of firearms, the fire-breathing, and the dazzling dancing of iron flowers at the end are so satisfying to watch!
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èVenice Gondolaüö§ Cruise. It is best to arrange a travel shoot to take pictures with the cruise, and the electric ones are not so prominent.

üëâFoodüëà
The breakfast is quite satisfactory, and there are all the things you should have, including the favorite freshly squeezedüç∑watermelon juice and freshly madeü•ûomelettes. Theüç¢ü•©black label ham with watermelon and cantaloupe in the buffet dinner is delicious, the roasted beef bone marrow is also good, and there are crayfish. The hot pot side dishes are relatively average. The executive lounge provides Heineken beer, and wine lovers can come more often.

üëâRoomüëà
The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room, including the balcony, is quite large. Turndown and cleaning services are provided every day, very timely. Mineral water and other supplies are very good!
There is a faint scent of incense in the bathroom. But the mattress is a little damaged, the rotating mirror on the bathtub has some problems in maintenance, and the edge of the sink is a little low, which makes it easy for water to splash out.

The design of the hotel's public environment was definitely ahead of the rest of the hotels at the same price, so I decided to stay there. However, there were also obvious shortcomings. There were no lounge chairs on the beach, probably because they were afraid that the guests of the B&B next door would share it. The room lacked a bathtub and a clothes drying rack. Objectively speaking, it was a bit abnormal. I hope it can be improved.

msg:A hotel with a very comfortable experience
You can immerse yourself in an a**osphere like Venice,
You can also integrate into the rich ethnic minority elements,
There are both gentle seawater rhymes and undulating seas
It is both dreamy and modern, both simple and elegant
Fairmont is very worth visitingüëç

From arrival to departure, the service is super considerate. Whether it is the concierge, restaurant waiter, or the service staff in the garden or anywhere in the hotel, they will take the initiative to say helloüòäEspecially the handsome butler Xiao Huangpite takes very thoughtful and meticulous care, and the service is considerate‚ù§Ô∏è

The Woodcut Art Museum (also known as the Republic of China Style Museum) is also a must-visit place in the hotel. The service receptionist Zou Meng, a beautiful, generous and kind girl, met by chance while watching the sunset ceremony. Xiao Zou took the initiative to take pictures for us during off-duty timeüì∑She also enthusiastically introduced various activities of the hotel, the meaning of the buildings we encountered, and the introduction of the hotel environment from time to time~I really feel that Xiao Zou's deep love for Fairmont has been unconsciously passed on to the guests around himü•≥

Fairmont not only has environment but also humanities, and the meals are also first-class

msg:Fairmont Hotel is basically the same as the pictures I saw online. It has a luxurious Southeast Asian style, a lot of wood and stone craftsmanship, and both the rooms and public areas are very thoughtfully designed.
Advantages: The hotel covers a large area, and the basic room starts at 60 square meters. Guests will also be equipped with a hotel butler to provide corresponding services. This time, the butler, Ms. Nicole Hu, who served me, was very professional, responded to problems in a timely manner, and gave fresh fruits. There are many supporting activities in the hotel, including special boat activities, the Wood Art Museum moved from the original site of Old Shanghai, the helicopter base in the hotel, the open-air cinema by the sea, etc. You can have fun all day without leaving the hotel.
Just talking about the shortcomings of personal habits, because it is too large, each area is very far and needs to be detoured. It takes about ten minutes to get off the car from the drop-off area to the room. Basically, I don‚Äôt want to go out after returning to the room. Although the room is large, the bathroom, shower room, and washing and drying area are not large. Due to the design and material selection, the shower room and wash basin will splash water everywhere. The sound insulation of the room is not very good. The birds and cicadas outside in the late night and early morning, and the crying of children in the next room are all clear.

Joly Xiaojin contacted us by phone one day in advance to understand the itinerary plan, added WeChat to inform the hotel's tour guide, and helped to book a cruise and travel photography. After arriving, she immediately took over our luggage, checked in and sent someone to deliver it to the door of our room (probably because the hotel is very large). There was a peculiar smell in the room on the first day. I contacted Xiaojin, who was on vacation, and she immediately handled it properly and promptly for us. On the last day, there were n unexpected incidents, requiring a wheelchair and various special care. The entire concierge process was very smooth and thoughtful, and the handover of each staff was very good. Thank you very much to all the concierge staff! Daily mini bar: free! Welcome fruit on the first day: free! Venice Seawater Rhythm River Cruise Experience: free! The whole process took about 20 minutes, the photos were very beautiful, and you can also make an appoin**ent for the free travel photography

msg:Because I stayed in the hotel for a long time, I had the opportunity to experience the hotel's various facilities and services carefully, which made me and my family very satisfied.
The hotel arranged a Nicole Hu (Hu Zixin) from the guest experience depar**ent to connect with me. The service was very good. She helped me provide information on various activities in the hotel, helped us book cruises and travel photography, so that we spent more time enjoying the hotel facilities and services instead of spending a lot of time exploring. I think travel photography is a feature of this hotel, because the overall architectural style is very Southeast Asian, and the various wood carvings are also very delicate and large in size, so taking pictures in the hotel is a good choice. Xiaoli, the photographer here, is very professional. She took a lot of good photos for our family, which made us reluctant to choose photos. We simply bought a lot of them back as a souvenir, which is very meaningful.
The hotel is very close to the beach and can be reached on foot. Although it is a public beach, it is a certain distance from the beaches of other hotels, so it can be used as a private beach. The bonfire show in the evening was very exciting, and our whole family loved it. There are also many types of breakfast, and you can't experience them all at once. There are also many activities specifically for children here, which are very friendly, such as climbing coconut trees, colorful graffiti, and making various handicrafts with bamboo leaves. In fact, every day can be fully arranged.
A good hotel can bring all-round comfort and peace of mind to guests. I think Fairmont has done it.

msg:This is one of the most satisfying hotels I have stayed in in all my years of traveling with my children.
When I checked in, I added the WeChat account of the butler Jinmei. It was very nice. He immediately sent me a map of the entire hotel and all the activities in the hotel. When I was told that I didn‚Äôt have enough drinking water, I sent a WeChat message and immediately arranged for the staff to bring it to me. Many of them helped me delay my check-out time because I had children. If I had any questions during my stay, I could always reply and solve them. Even if it was not part of my daily work, I would actively contact other depar**ents to help me with inquiries. No matter if I saw the message sooner or later, I would patiently reply as soon as possible. Simply awesome
Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel
The hotel has a comfortable a**osphere. When you get off the bus, a waiter will come to open the door to pick up your luggage. This is not just the case on the first day. Every day after that, the concierge will open and close the door when you come in and out of the taxi.
The entire hotel building is made of solid wood in Southeast Asian style. The facilities are clean and tidy. The layout of the rooms is reasonable and comfortable. Hygiene details are very good. When the cleaning staff found children's clothes when cleaning, they would also take the initiative to leave a note to add children's toiletries. The staff's attentiveness is reflected in every aspect. aspect
All service staff in the hotel will take the initiative to say hello when they meet them. They will smile and nod to say hello anytime and anywhere. They are also very friendly when seeing children. This is particularly great.
The hotel's children's pool provides bubble games every afternoon from 4.30-5.30. Children especially like it and must go every afternoon.
The beach is clean, there are few people, and the sea water is clear. Free sand digging tools are provided. Remember to put them back where they were after use.
I purchased a two-night package in a king-size bed room, which includes a buffet dinner and special privileges. It can be seen that Ctrip attaches great importance to users. There are candy boxes for the children and foie gras, durian, pizza and raspberry cake. I will also take the initiative to ask if I want them. It was a great experience to taste the buffet food. The overall food was great. The price of the set meal was really affordable. The staff also invited us to sit in the member breakfast dining area the next day. Although there is no special trea**ent in this area, it can be regarded as a staff member. Careful arrangements for treating Ctrip users
Of course, the hotel's breakfast is also very rich, rich in variety and delicious. Breakfast is provided until 11 o'clock.
There is a water system surrounding the hotel, and you can experience the dragon boat once a day. You can ask the butler to help you make an appoin**ent, or you can go directly to the queue to make an appoin**ent. It is currently considered the off-season for tourism, and you have to wait about 10 minutes to get in line. The whole trip takes more than 10 minutes, and it is very comfortable.
From the whole stay experience, the hotel treats every guest with care, responsibility, and friendly attitude. It is true that every waiter can do this. It can be seen that the hotel management and training are in place.
I feel that this hotel is my most successful choice for this trip. I will take my children to the hotel again during the holidays. I hope the hotel can maintain this level and continue to do so.

The day before I left, I found cigarette butts left by the previous guest on the balcony, and there was thick dust in many places, which shows that the hotel's sanitation cleaning and inspection are not meticulous. Another thing is that Haitang Bay Hotel now has parent-child activities, and Fairmont's activities are just for show. I made an appoin**ent for clay for the children, and it was over in five minutes, and then the next wave of children started, and they were not interested in other parent-child activities in the hotel. I still hope to improve more.

The bed faces the balcony, and there is an extra-large bathtub on the balcony, which the children like very much. The sanitary conditions are good. I am particularly satisfied with the hotel's butler service. Nicole Hu added WeChat before checking in, introduced the hotel layout and activities in advance, informed some precautions, helped to book activities after checking in, and responded quickly to any questions. The service is very considerate and efficient. The waiter took the initiative to prepare more drinking water when he saw that there were children staying. Although there were more people during the holiday breakfast, it was relatively orderly overall. The waiter led the seats specifically, and different dining areas avoided local overcrowding. The variety was rich and the quality was also very good. The hotel attaches great importance to wood art, and there is also a special wood art museum. The explanation is very professional, and the traditional wood art culture is impressive. The sunset ceremony and Li ethnic fire dance performance in the evening are also very exciting and thrilling. The hotel rooms are also close to the beach. In short, I am very satisfied with this stay experience!

The hotel also has a Chinese restaurant where you can order food. At first we went to the Chinese restaurant, but my husband wanted to see how the buffet was. Our Chinese restaurant received us. A tall, thin and handsome guy took the initiative to lead us to the building of the buffet restaurant and explained it clearly to the service staff of the buffet restaurant. Let us visit the dishes and decide whether to dine in this hotel. After seeing the dishes, my husband was very satisfied and decided to dine in this hotel directly. We felt that every service staff was considerate of the guests and provided meticulous and thoughtful service. Because of the meticulous service of the staff, we decided to check in at this hotel at that time. This formed a satisfactory experience of one-stop food, accommodation and entertainment. The hotel park has free parking and electric vehicle charging piles. I forgot which parking lot I parked my car in. The receptionist at the entrance of the hotel drove an electric car to take me to my own parking place, and then the waiter drove to lead the way to help me find the parking lot near Building 1 where I lived. I am very satisfied with the food, accommodation and entertainment at our Fairmont Sanya Haitang Bay. I will come here again to eat, stay and play

There is a balcony, and the bathtub is very large on the balcony. The design concept is to let guests feel the nature, otherwise it is really hard to understand why it is placed on the balcony haha
There are many activities in the hotel. There are dragon boats, sunset ceremonies and fire dance shows in the evening. Professionals are specially invited to perform. It is free to watchüëÄ!
We contacted Xiao Jin from the guest depar**ent before check-in. There were greetings from before check-in to after check-in. The fruit was delivered relatively late, and it was arranged smoothly. He also replied to the processing after get off work hehe!

The whole hotel is surrounded by lush tropical garden plants and Venetian-style seawater canals. The scenery of the hotel can be visited by boat. It is so beautiful! This time, we also watched the sunset ceremony performance and fire dance show with Li characteristics, took a dragon boat, visited the Wood Sculpture Art Museum..., and the life of staying here is colorful. 
The service of the hotel is very good: After staying for two nights this time, we stayed for another night. Ms. Jin Mei, the manager of the hotel lobby, was warm and thoughtful to help us solve the problem. We are deeply grateful! 
Hygiene: We stayed in the Jinzun twin room. The room was spacious, comfortable and clean. The waiters: Liu Kaiwei, Fu Yaju, etc. were very responsible for cleaning and the service was warm and thoughtful. 
Hotel catering: The breakfast buffet is very rich, and the afternoon tea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJinzun Administration is also very good. Manager Xiaotian is warm and thoughtful. When my husband was upset, he also arranged porridge and other easily digestible foods. Thank you Manager Xiaotian! 
Let's talk about the experience of taking a cruise: What impressed us most this time was Captain Wang Yue, who was very enthusiastic in helping us take photos and videos when there were not many tourists, and took us for two laps.
In short, we were very satisfied with our stay this time and will stay again next time.

From the moment you check in, you will receive warm service. We were originally supposed to check in at three o'clock, but they checked us in after one o'clock. Xiao Huang (Pite), who added guest relations, was very good at his service. In the morning, he asked us about our check-in experience and said that he could help us apply for a late check-out. Since we were leaving for the airport after twelve o'clock, we asked him to help us apply for a late check-out. I checked in less than 24 hours and received welcome fruit three times, which was really nice. The hotel is large, has a beautiful environment and is close to the seaside. The sea water here is really comparable to Wuzhizhou, very clear. The hotel has a sunset ceremony, a Li fire dance show, and some activities for children. It is really relaxing here. A very good experience during this trip to Sanya

msg:This hotel is one of those amazing places that exceeded our expectations. Here you feel more like in Venice than in China :)
When we booked this hotel, we were hoping to get a huge area and fairly high service. But we never expected to see here a real palace with architectural and interior sophistication, immersed in greenery like the ‚ÄúHanging Gardens of Babylon‚Äù.

The hotel has a highlight: upon entering, you immediately find yourself on a high arched bridge spanning the canal. From the bridge there is a romantic view of boats scurrying back and forth, more like Venetian gondolas. On one of them we were able to walk through the entire hotel area and see it from the water. It's nice that this option is available to all hotel guests.

In the evening, a sunset ceremony is held by the water: an opera diva on one of the boats sings mesmerizingly with a magical voice. During the ceremony, everyone can receive a letter with a prediction.
And later in the evening, a fantastic fire show takes place in front of the pool.

There are also 2 beautiful traditional pagodas and one ancient Chinese mansion.

The location of the hotel, like the others, is on the first line. Although the beach is not equipped and swimming is officially prohibited, nothing prevents you from walking along the sea and enjoying the beautiful view.

I would also like to note the special disposition of the staff, who are ready to help with any question at any time. I would especially like to thank the employee Joly (she speaks English), who was in touch throughout our stay at the hotel and resolved all our issues easily and quickly.

The rooms are beautiful, I would even say stylish, more like mini-villas. The rooms have everything you need and even more. They clean/check 2 times a day :) Very beautiful views, especially if they give you (upgrade like us) a room facing into the territory, where you can see the sea.

Breakfast until 11:00! The choice of everything is huge, and the local cuisine also includes more familiar European dishes, and a lot of sweets.

This hotel captivated us! I wanted to come back here again and stay longer :))

According to Tomas Travel rating, the hotel is 10/10, breakfast 5/5!

The flight was cancelled and I stayed at the Fairmont for two nights at a moderate price
The hotel lobby is super grand and meaningful
The Chinese style of the room is easy to look old, the breakfast line is too long, there are too many people at breakfast, the experience is not good
The executive courtesy does not have hot food, it's like a buffet
The staff at the swimming pool are very good and will take the initiative to remind potential risks

msg:This is really a hotel that gave me experience. I thought it was just an ordinary five-star hotel. But I was amazed when I came in.
The front desk was very considerate and upgraded us. The housekeeper, Elaine, was very considerate and prepared Bulgari toiletries for us. She was very nice.
As soon as I entered the hotel, I saw antique solid wood furniture. We booked a sea view room with an unbeatable view.
It can be said that this is the first choice for a two-person vacation, because there are performances on the first floor, mainly concentrated on the first floor, and the higher floors are more private, and there are no children making noise.
I was woken up by the sound of birds in the morning. The view is unbeatable.

msg:Fairmont may be the existence of White Moonlight that I will never forget in my life. Why do I express it like this because I have met a group of friends with a sense of belief here~ Here I sincerely thank the guest experience manager Frank and the handsome chef Leo. I am very ashamed. Before I came to Fairmont, I didn‚Äôt actually do any research on this hotel because I was overly excited when I came here. I only booked it for one night. What attracted me at first was their Venetian boat on the water. But when I The moment I arrived at the site, I realized that the special thing about Fairmont is that it has a profound cultural heritage. Its mahogany and agarwood really show the temperament and taste of the owner. But I want to talk about the humanistic service guest experience of this hotel. Frank, the manager, is gentle and personable. He is elegant and dignified in dealing with others. He is a well-deserved leader. I am very impressed. I think the owner of this hotel is very visionary to invite such outstanding talents. Let‚Äôs talk about Chef Leo. I am a senior food lover and observer. I have eaten at Michelin and Black Pearl restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai. I never thought that a buffet restaurant in a resort hotel can be so lifelike. All the ingredients are produced under the helm of chef Leo. It is not only a meal, but also a professional level. At the beginning of the review, I mentioned the word "conviction" about the chef's eternity in his life experience. Yes, I think he is a person with a very upright outlook and a stable core. He is brave and resourceful in his work. I think it must be the fertile ground of Fairmont. Secondly, I think he has great taste. The food made by a person with taste has soul. This is the highest summary of culinary aesthetics. I am very grateful to Fairmont for the service it provided me. It is not just During an island vacation trip, I learned a lot about the core of work from them, and it also allowed me to grow myself. This is the indefinite blind box that high-net-worth people want most when traveling, leveraging the higher value of life!

msg:The architectural design of the hotel is very distinctive. It feels like being in Venice when you take a cruise through the river. The lobby's gorgeous wood-carved dome, ancient wooden pavilion, and corridors with red lanterns have a very classical Chinese style. Even the table in the room is a wood-carved painting. There are also sunset ceremonies and fire dance performances with local ethnic characteristics. Thanks to the housekeeper Leal for his thoughtful service. Before checking in, he sent us the hotel's guide on WeChat, helped us make reservations for various activities, and delivered water and room supplies in a timely manner. Although the children's playground is temporary and a little small, the staff is very attentive to take care of the children, unlike some hotels where they sit there and play with their phones all the time. I have been to Sanya three times and stayed in many hotels. Fairmont is relatively special and it is quite comfortable to stay.

msg:The hotel area is relatively scattered, so it was difficult to find a room at first. The hotel has direct access to the beach, but many places in the park are under renovation and are a bit rundown.
The retested garden view room is suitable for families. There are beds upstairs and downstairs but no doors. The soundproofing upstairs and downstairs is almost useless. The view from the balcony of our room was not very good. It was an old yard full of garbage and construction sites. Anyway, it was just a one-night stay. If you didn't look out, you would be out of sight and out of mind.
Hotel highlights: rich Chinese and Western breakfast, buffet afternoon tea and happy hour, no need to eat lunch or dinner. The sunset ceremony was nice and interactive, and the Li fire show at night was particularly exciting. The housekeeper Xiao Huang (Pite) answered all our questions and helped us arrange a late check-out. The service was in place.

msg:Service: The housekeeper Xiao Luo was very enthusiastic. She added WeChat in advance to inform us of the hotel's various services and helped us book a cruise. After arriving at the store, Xiao Luo also patiently checked us in. If we had any questions, she would respond quickly and solve the problem. During breakfast, the staff also sent a snack and fruit to take away.

Facilities: The room type we stayed in this time was a Jinzun duplex, in Building 4, which was very convenient to go anywhere. The room comes with executive privileges, and you can enjoy afternoon tea and light meals in the evening. However, there were too many people who caught up with the afternoon tea, and you had to wait for a seat. The experience was a little discounted. After entering, I found that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe executive lounge was a bit small. No wonder...

Hygiene: There is no problem with the hygiene in the house, but the wall of the second-floor balcony is mottled and needs to be renovated.

Environment: The public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is very distinctive, with an artificial canal connecting the buildings. There is a long corridor from the drop-off area to the hotel lobby, which is beautiful and distinctive. In addition to the free cruise experience, there is also a sunset ceremony and fire dance show in the evening, and the day's activities are very fulfilling. The swimming pool is open from 8 am to 10 pm, which is very convenient.

Although it takes a long time to get to the hotel, the staff are very enthusiastic and provide water to my mother from beginning to end. She is very hands-on. My mother likes her very much and thinks she is very dedicated. She arranged check-in immediately and was very fast. After arriving in the room, I received a check-in fruit gift in the evening. To summarize, there are several places to play and reviews. 1. Cruise: arranged for me The most handsome guy chatted with my mother while we were on the boat, which was great. 2. Haitang Photography: The color tone of the photos taken is very good, very Venetian, and the weather is also very cooperative. Be sure to take beautiful photos! My mother said that photographers are bad because they work so hard every day shooting. Haha 3. Republic of China Park: Sister Meng talks as she walks and interacts with you. It‚Äôs very interesting. I learned that this is where our Shanghai Du Yuesheng lived. The organizer spent a lot of effort to move to Sanya. 4. Sunset ceremony: The passing and handing over of the torch is the local people's respect for the God of Fire and the God of the Sun. Let my mother pass the torch with the torch. 5. Fire Dance Show: I am also a native of the Li ethnic group, blacksmithing, and various big moves. It feels very aboriginal 6. Swimming pool: There are two areas for children and adults. The pool is quite clean and it is a great stay experience‚ù§Ô∏è

msg:The Fairmont Hotel is really amazing. I thought it was a bit expensive at first, but after checking in, fruits and minibar drinks were free. There were also afternoon tea and cocktail parties, cruises, sunset performances, and Li torch performances. The kind that breathes fire and strikes iron flowers. The Republic of China Cultural Museum also has a professional explanation. The lectures are very professional. Everything is also a shareholder of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. There are actually real people singing Italian opera songs. It is the first time I heard it. It is too advanced. There are also open-air bars and movie screenings. The most important thing is the seafood buffet. It‚Äôs really good and the ingredients are all very fresh. King crab, various crabs, abalone, oysters and scallops are all fat. The sizzling squid is so amazing. Now the street I couldn't eat any snacks, so I ate and watched the show. It turned out that the chef personally made m3 wagyu beef, which is very expensive, and durian pizza. If the service is so good, the chef must add chicken legs. He is super professional. The higher the level, the more humble it is. Not to mention the room, the surrounding supporting services are great value. And there is also a dedicated butler in the room to leave you a small note, which is so heartwarming. When we saw us drinking Coke and coffee, we immediately got more. I'm afraid we won't have enough. In this hotel, apart from the room fee, I didn't spend a penny. I enjoyed so many services. Even the fish were fed with good bread from the bakery. I will come back next year. It is a highly recommended hotel.

I brought my mother to vacation. There are many activities in the hotel, which is very suitable for hotel play. When checking in, there will be a special person responsible for docking.

msg:It was a pleasant stay at Fairmont. I heard that it used to be Kempinski Hotel. The hotel is indeed a bit old and the appearance is a bit old. Nicole Xiaohu from the Guest Relations Depar**ent contacted me in advance the day before check-in and introduced the hotel activities. She was very attentive during the stay and check-out. The visit to the Li Fire Dance Show and the Republic of China Mansion was very good. I will go again if I have the chance.
I have read a lot of bad reviews about Fairmont before, and I was still quite nervous before going. I don‚Äôt know if it was because there were not many people in the off-season. The overall service was very online. I went there from Ritz, and the check-in was much faster than Ritz, and the service attitude was also better. Of course, the hotel facilities cannot be compared with Ritz. After all, the price is much cheaper. It is highly recommended for family travel and people who pursue cost-effectiveness. The breakfast is also rich. Although the executive lounge has few varieties, the quality is very good. It is very suitable for my appetite and I am very happy. The food is also replenished in time, and there is no problem of empty plates. There were many bad things said before, I don‚Äôt know why, my experience is still highly recommended. The quality of the complimentary Chinese restaurant meal was average, and inconsistent with the dishes marked by Ctrip. The waiter did not provide any explanation, and it felt like the waiter was new. I hope he can receive more training in the off-season to improve his service capabilities.

msg:The overall experience was beyond expectations~ Before the trip, my dad strained his leg and needed a cane, which made walking inconvenient, so I called the hotel to ask about the wheelchair rental situation before making a reservation. I asked Fairmont and Atlantis, and based on the feedback from the front desk and concierge, Fairmont won by a lot. There was no signal on the cruise ship before arriving, so I confirmed the wheelchair and checked in after getting off the ship. In this situation, I arrived at the hotel around 11 o'clock and checked in directly if there was a room available. The housekeeper Xiao Luo helped us get the wheelchair and accompanied us all the way to the room. He introduced the hotel's facilities and what we could do, and patiently explained it to my parents. During the subsequent check-in time, he helped us book activities and communicate with us. Answered all kinds of weird questions for meüòÖ, the service attitude is very good~
The restaurant is also very good. There is a special area for Ctrip members for breakfast. The buffet dinner provided by the hotel has a small hot pot. It would be better if the firepower could be bigger~üòÜThe freshly made dragon fish soup is very fresh. I chatted with the chef for a while. , he took it very seriously when he learned that we were guests booked on the Ctrip platform. He cooked foie gras and steak, grilled durian pizza, and even cooked the flamed beef bone marrow for all to be delivered that night. You can chat with the chef. What a surpriseüòÜüòÜüòÜ~
I would also like to particularly mention the Wood Art Museum, which contains the owner‚Äôs private collection. I selected some for display. It is said that the owner is 70 years old. Although the exhibits are not made of particularly expensive wood, they are very representative and include carvings. It was very beautiful, and the lecturer Xiao Zhang also told it very well. In addition to introducing the wood art itself, there was also a lot of expanded content. Even the characters in the photos on the wall and the stories behind them were told vividly, and we put in a lot of effort~ Everyone in this group loves to ask questions and had a great time chatting with Xiao ZhangüòÜüòÜ
I met a wedding. In the afternoon, there was a beautiful lawn wedding facing the sea with spring flowers blooming. In the cool night, there was a prosperous fire dance show to entertain the dinner. The newlyweds must be unforgettable~‚ù§Ô∏è
Finally, I have a small suggestion. I hope to keep hand sanitizer in the room, and it would be better to add hand cream in the restaurant bathroom~

I asked everyone one by one by comparing the video and photos, "Have I been here before?" Full of memories. This time, she actually overcame her fear of water, took a shoulder float and went directly into the water. She swam in the pool for more than four or five hours every day for three days, and was so tanned that she couldn't look... The hotel is still so clean and hygienic, and the special programs such as the sunset ceremony and fire dance show are also very good, and the children like it very much. It's just that the queue for the cruise ship is a bit long, and there are so many people... The room service is very thoughtful. The flip-flops provided are uncomfortable. Seeing that I came back barefoot with slippers in my hands and sweaty, Aunt Liu Yawei Liu, the room service, immediately went to the linen room to get the elderly slippers and added a few more bottles of water, which is very considerate.

msg:üå¥Room: The package room voucher I bought was better than expected overall. The duplex family room has a high floor height, a twin room downstairs, a king-size room upstairs, a balcony downstairs with a sea view, and a large cloakroom upstairs, which is much better than expected.
üå¥Facilities: The overall Southeast Asian style of the hotel, the wooden dome in the lobby is magnificent, the swimming pool is clean, there are lifeguards watching all the time, and there is a children's area for children to play. The hotel is built along the canal, and you can also take a cruise, which is unique. There is a beach not far from the swimming pool. The beach doesn't look big, and it's enough to walk and dig sand, but Haitang Bay has strong winds and waves all year round, so it's impossible to play in the water.
üå¥Service: The service must be praised. The housekeeper Xiao Sun contacted the check-in matters by phone before checking in. The children's supplies are also fully prepared, and there are cute little bathrobes. Other staff members are also very enthusiastic, will take the initiative to say hello, and the service response is also fast. The hotel's sunset ceremony and fire dance show deserve a big thumbs up, showing the Yi culture of Hainan, which is very exciting, and tourists can also participate in it, which is much better than expected. The wood carving hall also has staff to explain, and they are also very patient.
üå¥ Hygiene: Overall it is OK, but there is room for improvement in details.

msg:Stayed in a duplex two-bedroom suite. The service is quite good. The housekeeper Xiao Huang added WeChat before checking in. If you have any questions, you can ask him and the answers will be solved quickly. The overall environment of the hotel is very good, but this room type is a bit tasteless. The bed is right on the first floor, there is no living room. The bathrooms are not locked. There is a tea table in the hollow space on the second floor. There is another room on the third floor, and you need to swipe a card to enter the other room. There was nothing on the third floor balcony, not even a light.
We live in Building 2. We moved in in mid-March. Poly construction is going on across the street, and there is noise from piling every day. They didn't offer to change rooms for us until the second day of our stay. There was only one day left and we were too lazy to take care of the children.
The advantage is that the restaurant is delicious. The executive lounge is also a great value. The service is pretty good, and the sister at the children's wave pool is also very patient. It's just the room type and noise that are the flaw. The wind in Haitang Bay is really strong, the hotel is very big, and you can call a battery car to go to the beach or something.

The housekeeper Jinmei Xiaojin called a day in advance to inquire about the expected arrival time and arranged the room in advance. The decoration of the hotel is very beautiful, and the two special drinks at the door are also very considerate. When you check in, you can leave your luggage directly at the door. After checking in, it will be delivered to the room in a short time. I stayed in a Gold King Ocean View King Room. The room was very beautiful, and the small bath towels folded on the bed made people feel like they were on vacation. The hotel's swimming pool is great, and the beach is also nice, but a bit far. The Jinzun Lounge is very good. After I was tired of playing at the pool and seaside in the morning and afternoon, there are exquisite snacks, fruits, and drinks (included in the room rate, great value). Go to the hotel buffet at 6 o'clock, and then watch the fire dance show (if you want the best angle, you must come to the dinner buffet). Highly recommended, super cool. The sunset ceremony is also good, but... why does it have to be sung by a female soloist in Italian (hahahaha, it's a bit misaligned with the Li ethnic group), but it sounds good. The hotel's concierge only spoke English when I checked in. Although there was no problem, the older people next to me were obviously a little unable to communicate. Maybe the Chinese speaker went to the bathroom and was a little surprised. On the day of check-out, contact Butler Jin to arrange a late check-out and resolve it quickly. The entire three-day and two-night experience was very good. The hotel facilities, catering, and services were absolutely great value. Come back and stay longer next time on vacation.

From another perspective, it means that the hotel occupancy rate is high. I was angry and didn‚Äôt want to stay. The hotel‚Äôs remedy was to upgrade the room type. In Sanya, which is still in peak season, I was bringing an elderly person with me. It was almost 6 p.m. Under the circumstances, I didn‚Äôt want to bother anymore, so I checked in with a stomach full of anger. After checking in, I slowly walked around the hotel and found that the hotel was very large and beautiful. It imitated Shuicheng and Jiangnan. The hotel had many wood products, a fire dance show, and a dragon boat tour. The dragon boat tour in the hotel is very friendly to the elderly. The breakfast is very rich and the buffet in the evening is also very good. I wanted to leave after staying for two days, but because the hotel is good, I extended my stay for another two days. I booked it through Ctrip. Xiaojinjoly was very enthusiastic and contacted me immediately to ask if I had any needs. Fairmont‚Äôs mineral water is the best quality hotel among all the hotels in my trip to Hainan and the supply is unlimited. It‚Äôs a great review!

msg:This is a very unique and interesting hotel. The hotel covers a large area and has a unique design. Six buildings are elevated above the canal. The buildings are connected by a canal. Gondola boats can be used to shuttle between the buildings. Between the buildings, flower-filled lawns and coconut trees, it adds a lot of fun, and it feels like you are back in the water city of Venice. This design is very unique. The most pleasant thing is that the hotel has many free activities. The canal cruise, sunset ceremony and evening bonfire party performance are worth watching. It is not far from the seaside and there is a lawn where weddings can be held. We took a look at it. A romantic wedding. It is especially worth staying for families with children. Another thing worth recommending is that the hotel's breakfast buffet is so rich, with both Chinese and Western breakfast options. There are welcome fruits in each room. The portions are large and there are many varieties, which are enough to supplement vitamins. However, the design of the room is a bit cumbersome and confusing. The biggest regret is that the check-in time was delayed by more than an hour. Maybe there are too many guests and not enough staff? hope to improve

msg:Traveling alone, wind signs, starting from Hangzhou

You should be able to see the Fairmont hotel environment online, and it‚Äôs pretty much the same. When you read reviews, you mainly look at the service attitude and stay experience. The following is my personal experience for reference only.

In order to facilitate diving and duty-free shops, I changed from Yalong Bay to Haitang Bay, and from St. Regis to Fairmont. The hotel's service staff were very nice, from the housekeeper Lulu to the shuttle bus driver and the cleaning aunt. They were all very nice. The overall environment of the hotel is not as bad as stated online, but because of the all-wood decoration, the ceilings in some corridors are already moldy. In such a humid south, it is strange that the water system is not moldy. The check-in process was very smooth. People with severe nasal allergies couldn't stand the damp and musty smell when they entered the room they booked. The housekeeper, Amanda, Xiao Sun Lulu upgraded her to a sea view room. As expected, she didn't see the sea, but it still smelled a bit like wood. Another thing that had to be cueed was The plug in the hotel was so difficult to use that it couldn't be inserted tightly at all. I had to hold the plug with one hand when drying my hair. If I didn't hold it, it would fall off. There is a construction site next door, and helicopters fly over from time to time. There is always noise during the day. Because I still have to work, I was already thinking about changing hotels as soon as I checked in.

The Western restaurant is a buffet, and the service staff will ignore you after paying, and no one will take your seat. The service awareness of some employees in the restaurant is really average. It was 7:30 when I went there. There were not many dishes in the restaurant. I saw grilled scallops in a stall. There were ingredients, but the boy was not ready to cook them. The layout of the ingredients in the restaurant is very scattered. I asked the waiter if he could help me get a drink, but he was politely declined. In short, in this restaurant, if you are not the person he wants to serve, you have no service at all. It‚Äôs hard to explain in one word, but I understand everything. I was already ready to eat a healthy meal. I made some mediocre hotpot with mutton and vegetables, and planned to change to a hotel the next day.

But my friends were in for a surprise. Leo Yu, the head chef of the Western restaurant, was very kind and took the initiative to ask for their needs. Later, he served his special Wagyu beef to the table. The round-faced Awei made a dessert with a little alcohol flavor, and Dafeng made beef. Bone marrow and baked lobster, and there was also a lively little performance, which was super fun! ! The emotional value is directly filled up! Originally I didn't plan to have dinner today. I went to learn diving in the afternoon and almost drowned. It also rained a little. The wind blew and I was almost freezing. I was in a low mood. A stomach-churning meal made me secrete dopamine. After reading the online reviews of this head chef, I saw that he is also very patient with children. When a customer is about to leave the restaurant, he comes specifically to say goodbye to him. He still has a very charming personality. However, the team is not strong enough, and the great master leads the novices to feel powerless. If you go there during this time, you can contact Leo directly and tell him that it is the review he saw on Ctrip. You will get the above services that I have experienced.

In addition, Sanya wall promotion in March! ! ! The weather is super comfortable and it‚Äôs fun to walk around. If you don't go to the hotel specifically for rest and vacation, then these trivial services are not important. It is enough to go out and play every day and come back to sleep, and the hotel still gets what you pay for.

msg:It was absolutely right to choose Fairmont when I came to Haitang Bay this time. Although the hotel has been in operation for a long time and the facilities are not that new, the environment is clean, fresh and quiet. You can feel that Fairmont's corporate culture is profound, the hardware and software services are first-class and attentive, and the accommodation, dining and entertainment experience is great! Make everyone feel at home!
I would also like to give a thumbs up to the customer service Xiao Jinüëç. From before check-in, to check-in arrangements and check-out, he was extremely caring.
Cruise ship & sunset ceremony & Li fire dance & wood art museum & afternoon tea, there is something new every day.
It was a very pleasant four days and three nights. If you are like me and like to spend time in a hotel on vacation, Fairmont is definitely the right choice.

Children can feed the fish and book a boat cruise. There are also many parent-child activities, including bubble pools, tree climbing activities, fire dance shows, open-air movies, etc... I especially like the hotel's wooden art gallery, which is simple and elegant. We spent a wonderful two hours there with our children. The breakfast in the hotel is good, and the Baoluo fans and Hou'an fans that I miss are also arranged. The buffet dinner is also very cost-effective, and both adults and children enjoyed it.

msg:I took the elderly and children with me and chose the Fairmont Hotel, which has more activities. Because I wanted 2 rooms and also considered the cost-effectiveness, I had lowered my expectations. But I was still surprised after checking in.
The room facilities are as shown below. I have been coming to Sanya twice a year since 2019. I have stayed in more than half of the hotels from Yalong Bay to Haitang Bay to Clear Water Bay. This is the first time I have encountered such facilities. The decoration is like an express hotel, but it is also very shabby and dirty.
The room is not soundproofed, so the sound of people walking outside the door and the chirping of birds are very loud. There will be two sudden very loud noises in the wall for no reason, like a heavy object falling to the ground or a switch of a large equipment.
The landscaping is very unrefined and the water in the children's heated pool is almost black.
The executive lounge has no view, only fruit snacks, and no cup of coffee is hot from breakfast to the lounge, it is all about 40 degrees Celsius. The lounge didn't have anything to eat later, which was the worst I've ever had in any lounge.
The buffet dinner included in the room rate was terrible.
One thing to say, the hotel has advantages: the catering is good, the breakfast is rich, and the Chinese restaurant produces high-quality food at affordable prices.
Most of the staff have a good attitude. Except for the front desk guy who has a cold face, the rest are responsive to my needs. Especially the housekeeper Xiao Sun has been comforting me and helping me solve my problems. But the hotel facilities are such that it cannot be solved. The beach is nice, not too windy and clean, and there are no deck chairs.
The fire dance show and canal cruise are very beautiful.
But I couldn't sleep all night, and I wasn't in the mood to appreciate the beautiful scenery.
Above, the hotel that costs more than 3,000 yuan per night cannot even provide a quiet sleeping space. The hotel has no other expression except a verbal apology, so I can only leave a negative review.

This is really thoughtful during the Chinese New Year. I took the elderly and children and chose the parent-child family two-bedroom suite this time. The children liked it very much, it was great and the view was unbeatable. The fire dance show at night was also wonderful.

msg:Overall, the hotel still gives people a refreshing and good feeling. After all, many details are well done. If you were in other places, you might not have so many perfect experiences.

Facilities: The hotel's furnishings are very classical. Compared with other modern decoration styles, it emphasizes a more stable temperament. If you are a person who likes classical culture, you may have some resonance when you come here. In addition, it may be maintained regularly, so it does not look old.
The swimming pool design here is also very beautiful, but the water is a bit cold, so I didn't go in to play, but there is a constant temperature pool. The interior design of the hotel is very ingenious. It adopts the form of a waterway, which is a bit like taking a boat in Venice.
The furnishings in the lobby upon entering are very stylish, and can even be said to be ingenious. Among them, caissons may be relatively rare in museums and ancient buildings (refer to the caissons in Beijing Ancient Architecture Museum, which are quite similar).
The facilities in the house are also antique, but what needs to be mentioned is the small table at the end of the bed. Some of it hurt my knees. I didn't pay attention and it hurt a lot. I hope it can be rounded.

Environment: The greening is very good, and you can often see one scene at a time, so you can find many good angles when traveling and shooting. The boat is well worth experiencing. In addition, there are sunset ceremonies and evening performances, which are very visual.
Plus, the putting experience is fun.

Service: Before arriving, Xiao Yang gave me a warm reception, added WeChat, introduced the hotel's facilities, and upgraded the room. Unexpectedly, the room number was the same as the last number on the mobile phone, which was very easy to remember. praise! During the process, he was always on call and proactively helped solve problems, which was great.
Xiao Zhang from the Wood Art Museum gave very detailed and thoughtful explanations. I think he loves his job very much. It's a pity that I heard there were kittens here before I came here, but they were given away a few months ago because I was worried that the cat hair would affect the guests. But I think the cats won't have much impact as long as they are friendly. In such a place full of humanistic a**osphere, having cats will increase aura.

Hygiene: The staff responsible for floor cleaning are also very responsible. I commend Chen Haiying for helping us clean very cleanly during the period.

FOOD:
One more thing to add is the dining experience in Chinese restaurants. The quality and taste of the dishes are not consistent with five-star restaurants.
The buffet has a rich variety, but in terms of desserts, it lacks delicious cakes, which is a bit of a pity.
The orange juice is freshly squeezed and very good.

It is said that the boss bought Du Yuesheng‚Äôs former residence in Shanghai and dismantled it and moved it bit by bit. The hotel has a courtyard and then a hotel. The various experiential performances provided by the hotel are also very thoughtful. It is also the only hotel with canal cruises. The beach of the hotel is also very wide. It is located in the middle of Haitang Bay. Facing Wuzhizhou Island, I got up early to watch the sunrise, which was beautiful. The quality of the buffet is also very high. I personally think it is better than the two restaurants I went to before. The service is also very good. I added the butler on WeChat as soon as I entered the store. Butler Xiao Yang was gentle and attentive. He had two children and arranged everything for us thoughtfully. The photographer, Mr. Kong, is also very good, and the photos he takes of the children are very natural.

msg:After staying for three days and two nights, I completed the one regret I had left when I came to Sanya at the beginning of the year.
I didn't have enough time to stay there. I finally stayed here when I came back.
I liked it very much on the first day I arrived. The environment is really nice.
Facilities:
Although the overall wooden structure looks very ancient,
But it's very clean and there's nothing wrong with it.
Dining room:
Afternoon tea on the first day was eaten at the restaurant on the first floor of Building 4
Except for the salty things, the desserts are really good. Especially the tiramisu red velvet is so delicious. There is also sangrita wine to drink.
Savory smoked salmon bread, cheese bread and small sea****
The kind that gets robbed right away. . .
The seafood barbecue buffet for dinner is in the big restaurant by the swimming pool.
The seafood is very fresh and the scallops are grilled to perfection.
The service is very good. There are drinks, but the water is only hot water.
The breakfast is very rich. If you are in a hurry, you can have it.
There will be more people when there are tour groups
bed:
It's very soft. The suite we stayed in has a double bed on the second floor.
There is a single bed on the first floor
health:
very clean
Serve:
One is that I was contacted by the housekeeper Xiao Huang before I came here.
If I'm confused, I can ask him anything I can't remember.
It's very considerate. Whatever you need, everything is provided.
They also specially arranged a suite with two bathrooms and two shower rooms in advance according to my request. I checked in in advance. It was perfect.
All the requests I asked later were answered, and any questions I had were solved immediately.

After visiting the Republic of China Residence, there was a docent girl named Zou Meng who made my baby very happy. She was very gentle and greeted us with a smile. She was worried that we would take too many things and even called a car in the hotel to take us to the swimming pool. It‚Äôs really a big hotel and the service is great.

At dinner, the uncle who didn‚Äôt remember his name and didn‚Äôt know his position also gave the baby a toy. For breakfast, the uncle gave the baby a pack of biscuits. Anyway, it was really popular and everyone was very enthusiastic.
Full of comfort

swimming pool:
Not big, not small, the deepest is only 1.5 meters
It‚Äôs really cold at the end of November for children outdoors
The water temperature is the same no matter when you play during the day
The bubbles in the bubble party are a bit pungent, but the children's water slide is really fun. Children like it and they can spray water.
The good thing is that there is a small hot spring pool
When it gets cold, everyone crowds into the hot springs, haha

I took the cruise that I had been thinking about for a long time. I took it the next day. It was a little sunny at noon and I circled around it. It was very suitable for taking pictures.

Dinner and fire dance show
You can also go to the beach
It‚Äôs just that the waves are so big that I can‚Äôt get into the sea.

What impressed our family most this time was the warm service of the hotel staff. The housekeeper Xiao Yang (Elaine) took the initiative to contact me before check-in to understand the arrival time and accommodation requirements. After checking in, they also took great care of my family and responded to all requests. They also helped me make appoin**ents and contact them in various ways, which was very considerate. The ladies who clean the guest rooms are also very enthusiastic and helpful. If you need anything, they will be delivered immediately. What‚Äôs even more coincidental is that this time we took a boat with Xiao Fu (or maybe Xiao Gu, I didn‚Äôt hear the accent clearlyüòú). He also provided the service to my daughter and me a year and a half ago. I still have it on my phone. We have a photo of us at that time. Service is as excellent as ever.
Of course, problems such as old facilities and sanitary blind spots in some inconspicuous places exist objectively. But as someone who has been in the hotel industry for many years, I really don‚Äôt care much about these.
Overall, our whole family was very satisfied with our stay and had a great time.

This is a retro wood carving art hotel. The resort is very large, the rooms are very spacious, and the quality of details is a model among five-star resort hotels. It is very comfortable and pleasant to stay. The meals are also very rich, so you don‚Äôt have to leave the hotel and can enjoy all the local specialties. All the staff are serious and responsible and very friendly. From the moment we entered the hotel, Ms. Nicole Hu arranged and planned the itinerary. She responded to our questions in seconds and continued to work hard to meet our various needs. We are very touched and grateful.
There are also many activities for children. There are all-day kids club activities. You can go boating outdoors (the hotel's biggest feature) and play golf. The hotel beach is very clean. There are people who provide tools for digging sand, and the beach is always monitored and safe.
Every dish in the hotel's morning and evening buffets is delicious, refreshing the perfunctory make-up menus of many inland hotels. It can be seen that the head chef plans the daily dishes very carefully and tastes each dish personally. Every chef and staff member in the hotel is also very friendly, working hard to accommodate any of your requests, and constantly encouraging you to taste. During dinner, chef Leo came out to interact with us and encouraged us to taste more delicious foodü§£ü§£ He also gave small Chris**as gifts to the children, and was very happy to run around with the children.

The overall business formats are rich and the services are in place, and the cruise experience is also great! Suitable for families, couples and parent-child travel! Highly recommended! The price for staying in a 100-square-meter suite is indeed the most affordable! I am also very satisfied with the various food and beverage gifts!
Gold executive benefits (exquisite afternoon tea & pre-dinner cocktail party): very rich and very popular!
Daily minibar: nice, coffee is great!

msg:The hotel is beautiful, with sophisticated materials and a traditional style.
On the booked date, there were only twin rooms left. When I arrived at the hotel, I asked the front desk if I could help change the room to a double bed because I was on my honeymoon. Without a word, I asked the front desk to change the room to a double bed.
Da Q, the travel photographer included in the package, was very patient and added 7 additional photos, looking forward to the retouching effect.
When I checked out, I forgot to send fruits when I checked in, so Leo Huang Yafei specially sent fruits and hotel toys on WeChat, which was very touching.

The whole hotel is very unique. It feels like a water town in Venice, you can take a boat ride, there is a bonfire show at night, there are welcome fruits, it is not far from the beach, it is very convenient, and the room is very quiet. Overall, it's very good. I feel that the service attitude has been better since Fairmont took over. Special thanks to Miss Jinmei for answering all my questions. The service attitude is very good! ! ! I will stay here again next time I come.

Before checking in, I received a call from guest relations Leo Huang Yafei. After checking in, he would greet me thoughtfully every day and promptly remind me when there would be performances and activities.
The daily sunset ceremony is said to have evolved based on the cultural heritage of the Li ethnic minority in Hainan. There is a cruise experience and a fire dance performance in the evening, which children love to watch.
The floor attendants clean the room every day and are very prompt and considerate.
This stay experience, I am very satisfied with the hotel's overall service.

As soon as we arrived at the hotel door, there was a young man helping us with our luggage. All the staff in the hotel must be so welcoming! Although I booked a basic room, the public environment is great and the room facilities are also very good. I was woken up by the birds chirping outside in the morning and the air was super nice! The whole style combines modernity and tradition, and there are many activities and cultural performances of two ethnic groups, which is super shocking! The dinner dishes provided by the hotel are also very delicious, and the cruise ship is also very unique. It is better than the Venice experience in Macau, with a gentle breeze and green eyes. Overall, I feel that this hotel is suitable for walking kids, young people, or taking care of elders. It is suitable for all ages. The owner has something, haha, and it feels full of sincerity! Highly recommended, will come again next time

The breakfast and buffet dinner are both good, the Wooden Art Museum is worth a visit, and the fire dance show in the evening is also wonderful. The only slight dissatisfaction I had was that the air conditioners in some rooms made low-frequency noise. After changing rooms twice, the final room was smaller than the one at the beginning and the view was worse.

There is also a private wood culture museum in the hotel, which collects many wood carving cultural relics and can be visited for free.

The service manager Jin Mei got in touch one day in advance to help book tours, track the itinerary and pay attention to the hotel experience. The food in the hotel is also good. The buffet dinner also includes coconut chicken hot pot. The room service is also faster. In addition, I also experienced the co-operation of Tuying in the hotel. The half-hour shooting was relatively efficient, and the film and service were both good. The twin children's room in the parent-child suite had no light switch on the bedside and no door in the children's room. This was the only inconvenience during this trip.

Compared with several other sea view hotels on the coastline, they are all the same and lack outstanding features. Fairmont breaks out of the siege, with both a Western feel and a Chinese style. The combination of Chinese and Western aesthetics is perfect. I visited the Wood Art Museum and experienced The cruise and the fire show were really fulfilling...! Finally, I would like to make a small suggestion. As a brand owned by Accor, the same group as Sofitel, I hope to add more types of pastries and improve the quality of pastries, which would be even more perfect...! I have stayed at Mangrove, Sofitel, Grand Hyatt and Sheraton in Haitang. So far, Fairmont is the one I most want to recommend to my relatives and friends.

Fairmont is one of the hotels I most want to stay in during my trip to Sanya, because its Venice-like design deeply attracts me. After actual experience, I feel that as a five-star hotel with added value such as landscape features, boat tours and cultural performances, Fairmont is worthy of its peak season travel price of over 1,000, but the overall facilities in the room are still quite aging. , at the same time, the breakfast order management is relatively chaotic, and the hotel's circulation design is too long, which consumes physical strength and time in the hotel.

msg:This honeymoon trip has reached the last stop, Haitang Bay, Sanya. Checked into Fairmont Sanya Kaiwei Hotel.
environment:
The hotel environment is very beautiful, the canal is beautiful, the swimming pool is large, the gym and other facilities are also very good, and it is very close to the beach. The whole hotel gives people a very comfortable vacation feeling.
Service: I have to highlight my guest-guest relationship, Leo. Leo Huang Yafei, who was in charge of guest relations before I checked in, contacted me in advance and arranged a room upgrade when I checked in, from a garden view to a sea view room, which was great. At the same time, he also introduced me to accommodation and hotel features. During my four-day stay, they helped me arrange various activities such as cruises, wood art museum explanations, duty-free shop shuttles, etc. The WeChat reply was timely and the arrangements were reasonable and in place. I feel that Fairmont Sanya Kaiwei is really dedicated to providing services. Wu Jinhua, the room cleaner, was also very attentive and helped me dry my clothes. I also give a big thumbs up.
Meals: I experienced the Gold Lounge, buffet breakfast and dinner, both quite online. You can also see a fire dance show at the buffet, which is very good.
Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose to stay in this hotel. I have left a very good memory here.

The hotel's breakfast is very rich and delicious, and free hot and cold drinks are provided in the corridor. The cruise ship is so beautiful, you can see the whole hotel, and you don‚Äôt have to pay!

In terms of software, the hotel does not have a butler service, but you can add WeChat to ask relevant questions. Nicole Xiaohu's service is very good. Most of the hotel's service staff are very enthusiastic and will take the initiative to say hello and respond to questions in a timely manner.

The packaging of the drinking water in the room is very special
Small boats can travel through the hotel
There are also performances by the Li people in Hainan Island
When I checked in, I received a sumptuous buffet afternoon tea and happy hour delicacies. They are all self-service and quite rich. It is much better than other hotels that only give you a mini bar. It is a must-orderüëç
Having stayed in so many hotels, the thickness of the quilt in this hotel is the most reasonable. It should be thinner in summer. The air conditioner does not need to be turned on too low. It is more user-friendly [strong] [pleasant]
Take a boat ride through the hotel
Smooth, quiet, relaxing, comfortable
The hotel said they were
The only hotel in Hainan with sea water channels.
Meet the fruit stall on the boat
Helped me [happy]
The hotel butler Leo's service is excellent, thank you!
What I hope to improve are: 1. Your store has a strong legal awareness of self-protection. It even refuses to help deliver takeaways to the room. It is recommended that customers sign a commi**ent letter, which can not only satisfy self-protection, but also allow guests to have more peace of mind. Good service experience. After all, your store is too big. Who wants to walk 10 minutes to get takeout outside the gate in the middle of the night? ! ? 2. Since I bought your fruit on board, I was refused the service of sending a fruit knife to the guest room. I was told that I had to take it to the restaurant and let the chef help me cut it. This is also the first time I have encountered such a situation. In fact, it can be done by the waiter. It‚Äôs okay to go to the room and help the guests cut it and then take the knife away!
Overall, I am satisfied. The price/performance ratio is relatively high in Haitang Bay. I hope it gets better! !

No matter which hotel you choose to stay in, you have to return to Fairmont in the end. I like its design: from the long covered bridge before entering the lobby to the tall and wide lobby that reaches the sea; to the water system that surrounds each house and the entire hotel, with gondola boats going back and forth; to the water system that is not far away. Brick by brick, a large mansion of the Republic of China was transported and restored from Shanghai; to a rich breakfast menu, exquisite afternoon tea, and cocktails... The most important thing is the natural, warm and thoughtful service provided by all well-trained staff from receptionists to housekeepers. Every detail makes you feel comfortable, assured and at ease. All the fatigue and tension can be melted away in these details. Facing the sea, return to your heart.
The only drawback is that because the water system is too close to the guest room, there will be some musty smell in the room (only this time I had such a problem). I hope I won't be disappointed next time.

The hotel covers a large area and has a small golf course. The green plants are well maintained. There is an ancient building next to the lawn that is said to have been completely moved from Shanghai. If you are interested, you can take a look. Walking around the hotel early in the morning, I saw all kinds of fallen flowers, which were quite beautiful. In terms of location, you can walk to the beach in five minutes. The waves are very big and you can't swim. You can only play in the sand and catch small crabs. The free photoshoot provided is not satisfactory. I don‚Äôt recommend trying it. In terms of service, the front desk and restaurant staff are very good. The staff in the lobby may have just started working. If you don't know something, you should ask your superiors. The butler service is very average and the response is slow. Compared with the 24-hour online service of other hotels (maybe on a shift basis), it is a bit worse.

msg:Overall, I'm satisfied with it. It's a very cost-effective hotel. This is my first time staying at the Fairmont. I'm actually quite looking forward to it (because when I was a kid, I watched "The Island" and Sean Connery named him to stay at the Fairmont in San Francisco, haha. ) The lobby on the second floor is splendid. It‚Äôs good for taking photos. The waiters are also very polite. They can basically say hello in the lobby. The room facilities are also online (occasional minor problems were solved by the housekeeper later). The housekeeper Xiao Huang (pite) It's very good. Basically, all the requests are met and the reply is very fast. The sunset ceremony in the afternoon is very good. You can participate in lighting torches. It's very good. It's also OK to go on a cruise. My wife likes it very much (be sure to make a reservation in advance, the housekeeper will help). You made a reservation and you can sit down when you arrive.) The swimming pool is okay, but there are a lot of people. The shortcomings are that the buffet dinner service is not good. It is different from other Haitang Bay International Hotels (the dinner experience is similar to that of the mangroves in Haitang Bay...). There are too many people and it is simply too busy. You have to queue up for many dishes. I couldn't even eat... I felt very tired, and the variety was average. The torch ceremony for dinner was quite good, but there were so many people watching... I couldn't even see it from a good seat. , the meal starts at 18 o'clock, and there is basically nothing at 20 o'clock. I feel a bit embarrassed to eat at Fairmont (I always think that Fairmont is similar to InterContinental JW Marriott, at least not worse than Westin...), However, the buffet experience is really not good, and the breakfast is quite chaotic. It feels like it cannot serve so many people at all. You have to queue up to eat a bowl of noodles... The service experience is also very bad. Many of the things that could have been eaten before were not cleaned. Another point is that there is no air conditioning in the corridor and it feels quite hot when you have to walk a long way (but this design structure is understandable), but special praise must be given to the auntie who cleans the guest rooms, Room 4601 (November 10-12) , the cleaning is very good, there are helpers to fold clothes, sort out my wife's cosmetics, and leave messages very thoughtfully. The overall feeling is not satisfactory, it is acceptable. The executive corridor (Jinzun) is a bit small and there are not many dishes, but after all, the price is here , and try to understand it as much as possible, but I still hope it can be richer. I really like the Fairmont brand, and I hope it can be better and better, so that it can match this brand. The reason for 5 points is mainly due to the housekeeping and guest room cleaning, as well as the ritual sense of torches, buffet breakfast and dinner, which I cannot praise... (there are still residues in the watermelon juice)

Special thanks to guest relations Leo Huang Yafei, whose professionalism and enthusiasm added more warmth to our trip. Always greeted us with a smile, patiently answered various questions, and provided a lot of useful suggestions and help. His attentive care made us feel truly at home.
 
In addition, the hotel's facilities are also very complete. Except for the lack of air conditioning in the lobby, which is quite hot, everything else is okay.

Whether it's the long corridor leading to the lobby or the magnificent wood carvings behind the reception desk, they are all worth seeing. This time the front desk also took the initiative to upgrade us to a duplex suite with garden view, which really gave us a big surprise.

Leo, the hotel butler, took the initiative to contact me the day before check-in. After adding WeChat, he immediately sent me the hotel's attractions and surrounding scenery and restaurants. During this period, he also took the initiative to ask if I needed any help, and offered to help on the last day of check-out. Request a late check-out. The considerate service made my parents very satisfied.

The hotel's boat cruise program, sunset ceremony and fire dance performance all added little surprises to this two-day vacation. The hotel staff will take the initiative to say hello when they see us.

I think I will choose this hotel again for my vacation in Hainan next year.

msg:I stayed in a family duplex sea view suite for 4 nights during the National Day. The whole family was very satisfied. I personally feel that this is a seriously underestimated hotel. Whether it is service, activities, or catering (lounge, buffet breakfast and dinner), it is very good! Because we were both old and young, we didn't leave the hotel for 4 days. We were not bored at all in the hotel, and we were even busy.
Compared with many hotels, in addition to the sea, beach, and swimming pool, Fairmont also has its unique wooden cultural center and dragon boat cruises, which are particularly rich and rich in experience. For the next 2 nights, we stayed in an executive room at the Ritz in Yalong Bay. The cost per night was 4 times that of Fairmont. After the experience, we felt that it was unnecessary. Even the breakfast experience at the Ritz was quite different. The seats were crowded and the taste was bad. Very average. Of course, bosses who are not short of money can still choose the Ritz (the executive rooms have room service twice a day and are closer to the beach), but for most people, especially families traveling, boldly choose Fairmont, the experience is still very good, especially Excellent value for money.
Finally, special thanks to the housekeeper Xiaojin JOLY, who took the initiative to add WeChat and helped us book many children's activities. The response was fast and the service was good. Thanks to the instructor Zhang Shichao from the Wooden Culture Center. He is a young man who has just graduated. He is enthusiastic and professional, and he is very serious and patient throughout the whole process. Thanks to the ladies at the Jinzun Lounge. Although I don‚Äôt know their names, everyone was warm and polite. Even when there were so many people during the National Day, they still maintained a very high service level and made our family spend a great time. Very nice holiday.

He was very attentive and worried about waiting. The children were given fried rice and side dishes, and later they were given coconuts as gifts. Feel their intentions! Like üëç

msg:Fairmont's value for money is really high. I bought the family duplex suite package with garden view and upgraded it to a family suite with sea view. I then extended my stay for one more night and it cost 400 per person per day, including breakfast and executive lounge privileges, and a free meal. The buffet dinner in Haitang Bay was okay. The hotel is quite big, and there are few people in the off-season, so it feels clean. Unfortunately, there was a typhoon and rain in Sanya, so we couldn't go to the swimming pool for three days. In the end, my son paid for the bubble party by mistake and had to go. Dream come true again.

In addition, you must make an appoin**ent for the hotel's cruise ship early. It is best to go to the counter opposite to make a reservation directly after checking in, otherwise you may not be able to get on the boat by the time you check out...

The hotel's food and beverages are average, and the taste is really hard to describe for me, a Guangzhou native. The five-star praise is partly for the overall environment and partly for the butler Xiaojin. The service quality is good. We lost our car keys when we had dinner on the first day of our stay. Xiaojin helped contact the restaurant immediately and got them back quickly. Key, overall Fairmont is worth recommending.

msg:Four words, still full of meaning.
Where does this feeling come from? First of all, people.
The dedicated manager, Manager Li Qianqian, contacted us before check-in and sent us the content and time of the package available after check-in, so that our family could better arrange our trip. The front desk provides barrier-free one-stop check-in service and is considerate. After checking in, WeChat reminded me of meals, shuttle buses, show times, etc., which made me, an itinerary expert, useless. Seeing that there were elderly people traveling with us, in order to have a better rest, they provided a late check-out service, thinking of our childrenüëç.
Then there is the captain of the cruise ship in the hotel (I remember it was a captain named Fu)üòÑ. During the cruise, he introduced us to the background of the hotel and the history of this small canal. At the sunset ceremony in the afternoon, Manager Guo introduced us to the culture of the Li ethnic group. Not only did we participate in the event, we also learned about the cultural customs of the ethnic minorities.
Of course, there was also a mysterious hotel senior leader who met him by chance in the lobby, mistakenly thought he was the lobby manager, and gave him some advice. Unexpectedly, after listening humbly, he gave us an unexpected and thoughtful benefit.
Although I only stayed for three days and two nights, I felt personally that the hotel's culture is reflected in the words and actions of the lower-level waiters to senior managers.

Next is the scenery. The hotel environment is very good, and the garden-like a**osphere allows us northerners who love the sea to not only see the sea in Hainan, but also appreciate the forests in the south of the Yangtze River. Strolling in the garden, the family also sighed that they suddenly forgot that this trip was to watch the sea. The solid wood green lawn in the garden, the wonderful performances in the evening, professional travel photography gifts, and free fruit drinks make you realize that the hotel not only allows guests to enjoy benefits regardless of cost, but also wants to pass on to guests a kind of A culture that can be seen and heard. Although the garden is large, it can reach the sea. The designer also had good intentions. The stay was short, and there was still a lot of things to do in the park. My parents were a little regretful when we left, so we made an appoin**ent to come back for a visit at a better time.

Beautiful scenery and excellent people. Beautiful scenery is easy to come by, as is wealth. Excellence in people is rare, and it would be difficult to do so without being influenced by the sun and the eyes, and taught by everyone.
I would also like to thank Manager Li and everyone else for giving me and my family a very wonderful experience.

Gardening buildings, unique waterways, rich dishes, and the most rare thing is that the staff have a strong sense of service. Check-in happened just after the rain. After visiting the old house, there were not many boat passengers and we went directly to the pier to arrange it. I didn‚Äôt book a travel shoot, so I had a lot of fun. The scenery was so good, no matter how I took photos, it was great. At about 6 o'clock, we can watch the torch ceremony and praise here at the swimming pool (the restaurant is also available). The room type given has been upgraded. I looked carefully at night and saw that the building opposite was completely unoccupied. It must have been specially arranged this way, so soaking in the bathtub was no problem. Breakfast was very good, will come again next time.

We checked in relatively early, at 11 o'clock. The room was reserved for us exactly as we communicated, and the twin beds were put together for us. We were very satisfied. The staff at the hotel are quite enthusiastic. During the National Day, the hotel has many programs, from seaside meditation at 7 o'clock in the morning to Li ethnic programs in the evening. The whole day was full. I stayed for two nights and experienced them all. My little friend was very happy!

msg:The air conditioner in the room was not cooling, and I had to change three rooms in two days in a row. The hotel staff were not active in solving problems, and lacked management training and service awareness, because the hotel itself consumed a lot of holiday energy.
The facilities in the room are relatively old, the cleaning is not thorough, the socket panels and other loose or missing sockets have not been repaired, and there should be no management personnel to check the room.
The hotel's circulation design is not very reasonable. Some buildings are too far to reach the room, and the elevators going up and down are inconvenient.
After chatting with several guests, they all thought that the overall accommodation experience at Fairmont Sanya was very poor and would not be recommended.

Nicole prepared a lot of small birthday gifts for the children. If you have any questions during your stay at the hotel, you can contact her at any time and everything will be arranged properly. Coach Chen guided parents and children to climb the tree. The children were too afraid to go to the top of the tree. They practiced again the next day and finally succeeded in going up to the top to play the gong. Mom and dad also tried the tree climbing activity and had a great experience.

The bathtub outside the balcony is so dirty that you could keep fish in it. Can you believe that the toothbrush does not have dust-proof packaging? The so-called boat ride to the room is a complete gimmick. First of all, you need to make a reservation. Secondly, the so-called river is just a drainage ditch.

I had read mixed reviews about my stay in a book before, but as an Accor member, I still tried to book a stay with some trepidation. Unexpectedly, it became the most satisfying hotel in this trip to Hainan. Because I was traveling with my 70-year-old mother and 2-year-old baby, I called the hotel out of caution. First of all, I am very grateful to the front office manager Judy for answering the call. After learning about our family‚Äôs travel requirements, she quickly arranged for our housekeeper Joly Jin.

When we checked in, we found that children's footrests, toiletries and small slippers were prepared in advance in the room. Very considerate. At the same time, in addition to soft slippers, the room is also equipped with beach shoes. At the same time, the hotel is also equipped with a children's club, water slides and a children's cinema, so children will not be bored even on rainy days.

Wait, you can eat until 11 o'clock. The happy hour package in the executive lounge includes cocktails, which is also full of sincerity. The service girl in the lounge was very considerate when she saw the baby. Not only did she not blame the child for accidentally spilling the drink, she also comforted the baby and gave him small pasta and biscuits. When you walk in any corner of the Fairmont Hotel, whenever you meet the staff, they will greet you warmly and remind you to pay attention to safety on the road. When the little brother on the sightseeing bus sees the children walking back to the room from a distance, he will also take the initiative to give them a ride. Procedure. The only thing is that the hotel is a bit far from the beach and there are no beach chairs to rest on the public beach. Overall, it is a family hotel that is worth staying in, and there are no pitfalls at all. recommend!

Finally, I would like to thank the photographer of this trip and Tom Huang, the dock staff, for cooperating with our shooting and taking us on a cruise to take pictures in such hot weather.

It is a good choice for family travel, which can not only satisfy the children's various experience activities, but also allow the elderly to have fun in the hotel. My favorite thing about this hotel is that breakfast is available until 11 o'clock. I would also like to express my special thanks to Li Qianqian, the customer service staff who received me during this trip. The excellent service deserves my gratitude again and again. They reminded me in advance to help arrange everything, and every detail was considered very thoughtfully, so that my baby had a happy birthday here. From the check-in souvenirs, the baby's birthday decorations to the late check-out and a series of arrangements for us to finally leave the hotel, the service was perfect! At the same time, I am also very grateful to the Wood Art Museum for explaining Zou Meng and the dragon boat master Xiaokang. I will come to Sanya again next time and hope to see you again!

I canceled the hotel for the next two days and stayed at the Fairmont. It was an unforgettable experience for 3 days. I don‚Äôt need to go there next time. Yalong Bay is an old five-star hotel. Fairmont Hotel has high-quality staff, good management, and less experience. Come on, Oli!

On the day of check-in, I found that it was still the highest floor, with a superb view, taking into account the courtyard view‚ûïsea view, fortunately I planned to stay for three consecutive nights. The hardware facilities in the room are very new, and the Chinese wood carving style in the lobby is also reflected in the room. The design of the entire hotel is thoughtful and very professional. The sand on the beach is very fine. At present, the sand quality in Biyalong Bay is good (sandals don‚Äôt hurt your feet when the sand enters it), but unfortunately you can‚Äôt go swimming in the sea, but this also just explains the difference between Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay: Yalong Bay focuses on sea swimming, while Haitang Bay focuses on Visit Wuzhizhou Island ‚ûï duty-free shopping. But I can say responsibly that when walking on the beach, the feet feel far better here than in Yalong Bay. Of course, I originally planned to go diving on Wuzhizhou Island ‚ûï duty-free shopping. This hotel is very cost-effective in terms of location and quality (it is suitable for young couples, children, and the elderly). One more thing needs to be mentioned. When I get off the bus every day, I really like to walk the promenade leading to the hotel lobby. The exhaustion of the day disappears instantly, and I like the grand and resplendent feeling. It is a pity that I haven't gone surfing in Houhai Village this time, and I will definitely stay here again next time. A small episode, I was in a hurry when I left, and I left something behind. I contacted the hotel a day later, and the hotel has a record. After checking it, it was mailed to me.

It costs about 1,000 yuan a day for one hour of soaking every day during summer vacation. The kids had a great time at the swimming pool party, where they played discs and shouted at the wheat bubble machine. Next to it was the Poly Rose Hotel, which had a beautiful infinity pool during the epidemic.

Insufficient, what I have to complain about is: we belong to the sea view room booked in advance, more than 1700 for a room, more than 3400 for two days, and only need less than 1300 for these two days. In the meantime, I couldn't see the sea, and my leg was broken. It's the off-season now, so there are so many empty rooms, can't you choose a place with a better sea view for our customers who pay a higher price? Remind the arranger in the lobby that the service should be more flexible. If you book in advance and spend more money to arrange the most partial room, this service purpose is not the way of hospitality.
I changed a hotel in the past two days, because the reservation price was higher than the current price, someone else took the initiative to upgrade the room, the view is very good, the standard sea view room.
In comparison, this is what I am most dissatisfied with.

Every time I make an appoin**ent for a boat ride, it is said that it is fully booked, but when I check out, I find that there are many boats at the pier.

Just a pool towel can't be taken back to the room, it can only be wiped next to the pool...

The exquisitely carved patterns on the dome and the window-like fence shine on the top surface through the hidden lights of each floor, and looking up, it is like ascending into a splendid and beautiful cultural temple. It is worth mentioning that the dome was built by Master Lu Guangzheng, the representative inheritor of the national intangible cultural heritage project, and led 7 provincial arts and crafts masters and 600 woodcarvers over a period of years. The layers are rich and delicate, the images are realistic and vivid, the carvings are fine, the style is elegant and delicate, and you will never tire of seeing them.
We had a good stay and will definitely come back next time!

msg:The hotel passes through the rainforest promenade, with a panoramic view of the beautiful scenery, and it is very popular anywhere! There is a quiet river between several buildings, and we can take a dragon boat to shuttle between the buildings. This experience is really unique, it makes me feel like I am playing in an ancient water town, which is very interesting.
        There are also a lot of children's activities, the bubble party in the pool is amazing, the a**osphere is full, and adults and children are very happy. The room is really super big, and the welcome fruits are also Hainan specialties.
        I especially want to mention our housekeeper, Xiao Jin, who is very considerate and considerate. She prepared special toiletries for our children in advance, which is very warm and caring. Her service made our stay even better.
       Overall, I am very satisfied with my experience at Fairmont Sanya. This is a hotel full of oriental charm, yet modern and comfortable.

She helps to book cruises, visits, and coordinate various affairs. It is very hard work, and I am especially grateful for her service. Also helped us upgrade the room.
I was lucky enough to see a double rainbow in the hotel. The hotel itself has some shortcomings. It is a little far from the beach and there are fewer chairs in the room.
Overall, the flaws are not concealed, and it is still recommended.

msg:I brought a family of six to stay for two nights. The two elderly people lived in a standard room, and the four of us lived in a double-level sea view suite. The children were not too happy, especially the younger brother, who went up and down in the suite on the third floor every day. The lady in charge of replenishment in the guest room is super nice, and delivered a lot of snacks the next day. You must know that shopping in tourist areas is not convenient, so these small snacks and drinks in the small refrigerator are very precious. The hotel is very big, and it takes 5-8 minutes to walk from the room to the drop-off area. Due to the hot weather, several meals are ordered as takeaway. Delivery was fast too. . It is not as noisy as a parent-child hotel here, but the children are still very happy, and they are in a state of chicken blood every day. I personally feel that living in Fairmont does not need to go to any attractions. Just play the hotel. I found that the two details are well done. One is that the textiles in the hotel are all disinfected with Walch, because I use them at home, and the smell is very familiar. I lived in Huayu in Yalong Bay for the next two days, and the bedding had a peculiar smell. The second is that there will be a touch of sandalwood as soon as you enter the bathroom, which I like very much. In short, I am very satisfied, and I will stay here again when I come to Sanya in the future.

msg:Satisfaction: (Stayed in a sea view room on the fifth floor, booked two rooms, the bed is big enough for a family of four to sleep)
The staff is friendly and has a good attitude. A lady with short hair in the restaurant leads the elevator to the seat before and after the meal. After parking the car late at night and walking back to the front desk from the parking lot, the security guard will ask if you need a car. After walking all the way, I took the initiative to come up to help with the suitcase.
The hotel's breakfast is very rich. My old man has bad teeth and is very picky about food, so she told me that the hotel's breakfast is delicious.
Dissatisfied:
The barbecue buffet in the evening is not delicious, and there are few items. It costs 974 yuan for two big ones.
The road from the hotel to the beach is too broken, there is no lawn to connect with the sea, and the wooden plank road is also dilapidated, it is difficult to walk the baby artifact. The first floor of the hotel is full of stairs. I always have to move the stroller, such as going from the swimming pool to the children's playground in Building 6. If you don't know the way, you really have to move four or five times to find the children's playground.
Generally speaking, it is not recommended for families with young children, it should be good to bring the elderly.

msg:During this Dragon Boat Festival trip, I experienced Haitang Bay Shangri-La Hotel and Fairmont Hotel. When I checked in, the front desk arranged to live upstairs in the spa hall, which was a bit magical.
The hotel housekeeper JUDY sent me a map when I checked in, which played a big role. I don‚Äôt need to get lost between buildings, and I can quickly get the route to the lobby. The hotel's breakfast is very rich. I was very excited when I went to eat it on the first day, and there was a limited number of meals at the door.
Reservations are required for boating and visiting the Wooden Art Museum, as well as for the shuttle bus to the Duty Free City.
The room is not equipped with hand soap or hand sanitizer. I asked the housekeeper to give me a piece of hand soap.
The location of the big bathtub üõÅ on the balcony is so strange. I don‚Äôt know how to use it for guests who need to take a bath? But I don't use hotel bathtubs.
The room was cleaned very carefully, and I found that even my clothes and skirts were folded, hahahaha.
I tried BBQ by the pool, 388 people. To be honest, the quality is mediocre, probably due to too few reservations, especially the quality of white wine at the drink bar is really a bit substandard, and the cost is estimated to be less than 100 yuan. The afternoon tea at Jinzun Building is good value for money, and the Riesling white grape is much better than the dinner BBQ.
The way to the beach is a bit unclear, and there is a lack of manpower to take care of it. Several boardwalks are damaged. It is recommended to go to the beach to step on the water after eight or nine o'clock, it is not hot at all.
Finally, the wooden decoration of the room will have a slightly musty smell in the humid local climate, please pay attention to the guests with a keen sense of smell.
Ctrip paid me a security deposit of more than 4,000 a few weeks in advance, and the hotel paid another 6,000 deposit when I checked in. When I checked out, the room fee was deducted and the rest was refunded to the card. It is somewhat cumbersome and inconvenient for the refund.

Yuexuan's manager and chef on duty are superb. Different side dishes are given every day according to our taste, which surprises us constantly.
The hotel has a large area, surrounded by waterways, and you can take a hotel boat and cable tour.
Hotel staff always pay attention to the possible needs of guests and provide corresponding services in a timely manner. When in the lobby, just caressing the dress, a waiter immediately provided portable mosquito repellent water.
Have time to check in.

Before check-in, Judy contacted the hotel in advance to confirm the arrival time, and arranged check-in and hotel activity experience, river cruise, ancient building visit, putting green, etc. They are very interesting, and it is a hotel with a high degree of Chinese and Western fusion. The location of the hotel is very good, Wuzhizhou Island is opposite the beach, and it is a short drive from Duty Free City and Atlantis Aquarium. The hotel room is large, the facilities are very distinctive, and the balcony can see the blue sea and blue sky. This season is considered a relatively cost-effective hotel.

The Yunhe dragon boat tour is also a unique project of the hotel. The scenery is different in the morning and evening, which is very charming.

What is particularly good is that the breakfast dishes are rich and the ingredients are fresh, but the Spanish restaurant I went to for dinner is not recommended.

msg:The company was on a business trip the night before in a hotel, and it was hard to feel complacent about staying there.
On the second day, I went to Sanya by myself, and the hotel I opened with my own money was Shuxin, which is a French brand. The location should be next door to Atlantis. Mr. Shi said that Atlantis was too earthy and asked me to choose another one, so I chose this one.
The style is generally what I like, with a sense of isolation and mystery, although the details are a bit old, the flaws are not concealed.
The housekeeper JUDY enthusiastically took me to choose the type of apar**ent, from a duplex to a large flat floor of more than 100 square meters. I observed it, and this should be the best place to see the sea in this area.
The environment is very pleasant, but unfortunately the weather is not good and there is no sea view.
I was bored in the afternoon, and JUDE took me on a boat for half an hour on the hotel's river, and also explained some stories about the hotel.
In addition, I discussed with Mr. Shi that the hotel's breakfast should be quite characteristic in Sanya.
The last disadvantage is that the response of the front desk service is really too slow. The main service depends on the trouble of JUDE, this is really... I don't know how to say it.

The captain also introduced the various special landscapes in the hotel in detail during the tour, and reminded us to stop for a while at the point suitable for punching in and taking pictures. , very caring. Not far behind the hotel is the beach, with few people and fine sand. In the garden, there is a huge outdoor swimming pool in the middle of two completely relocated buildings. I have had a lot of fun these two days. There is a small commercial center not far from the hotel. It is a few minutes drive from the Duty Free City. It is quite convenient to eat and shop.

Fairmont: "Fei" Fan's holidays are engraved in the memory

The Fairmont Hotel, which has been planted after refurbishment in 2021, will reopen after the epidemic in Sanya in 2022. During the National Day Holiday, we plan to arrange reservations immediately, but the hotel is temporarily requisitioned as an isolation hotel, and the hotel‚Äôs opening hours have been adjusted repeatedly during the long holiday. Due to the delay, we passively changed the ticket again and again, and finally regretted that we missed it and failed to arrange it~

The 2023 Sanya vacation trip will restart and return, and Fairmont will be the first choice no matter what! The last two visits after half a month are also true love
Enjoy: Sanya Fairmont, the most distinctive feature is naturally the world's first seawater rhyme river in the hotel, with a total length of 1200 meters running through the podium of the hotel, pretending to be in Venice. The cruise experience is also among the luxury hotels in Haitang Bay unique! I have been here twice, and each time I arranged to take a dragon boat tour around the Yunhe River during the day and night. The scenery experience is still different, and I am very happy.
Catering: Breakfast at the veranda restaurant, afternoon tea at the lobby bar, and dinner at Yuexuan Chinese Restaurant, all of which basically meet the requirements of picky foodies. Salmon is free for breakfast, this alone is enough to attract salmon lovers! Sanya's top luxury is also the standard breakfast only available at Capella and Park Hyatt. Edison and Rosewood didn‚Äôt get any of them anyway!
Culture: Wooden Art Museum, exhibits and collections include century-old wooden art masterpieces, historic houses, ancient buildings, ancient pavilions, and old photos of old objects in the Republic of China mansion, all of which are engraved with the imprint of time and present cultural heritage.
Jinzun: The second stay in a luxury suite, enjoy the Jinzun executive privileges, including Jinzun afternoon tea, pre-dinner cocktail snacks and all-weather coffee and soft drinks. Of course, there are welcome fruits and a daily mini bar that you can enjoy upon check-in. Eat and drink without worrying about the life of rice insects, you can eat, lie down and play, and feel full of vacation.

Thank you very much to Diana and Judy from the hotel's guest relations, the full score is 5 starsüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüPraise! ! Service index üíØ! ! The service is thoughtful and considerate, because we don't drink drinks, we specially prepare fresh coconuts and special refreshments, as well as cakes and desserts. If you have any questions, please contact us at any time, make an appoin**ent for a visit or check out late, and we will reply and solve them in time and help you arrange them. Because I stayed again within half a month, the room was specially decorated with "Welcome back", and I even prepared a souvenir when I left. It was so caring, warm and touching! It will definitely be the first choice next time and come again haha üòäüòä

Hygiene: clean, garbage is cleaned more than once a day, and there is no garbage thrown anywhere in the park. And the formal beach area of the hotel is cleaner than the beaches of several nearby hotels.

msg:A housekeeper added me on WeChat one day in advance. Her name was Summer. She had a very good service attitude. On the way to the hotel, I said, "Look, there are coconuts on the tree." She asked the housekeeping staff to deliver coconuts to our room. When we entered the room, there were fruit, chocolate and other desserts, and champagne. When we came back from swimming in the evening, we were given a cup of soup. We only stayed here for one day. When we left, Summer took the initiative to ask me if I wanted to apply for a late check-out and gave me a gift. Although I didn't need a late check-out, the service was really good. Later, the room I stayed in at Grand Hyatt was twice the price of this one, but the experience was better.
The hotel furniture is all made of wood, and some tables and chairs are slightly mottled; the room card is also printed with a logo on a piece of wood, which is unique; the breakfast is better than other restaurants in Hainan (except for watermelon, which is the worst watermelon I have ever eaten, and it is hard to imagine that Hainan produces watermelon), and the other varieties are richer; the afternoon tea snacks are exquisite and delicious, but I didn‚Äôt have time to experience the cocktails. In the evening, I bought the buy one get one free **BQ seafood dinner sold by the hotel for a limited time. The price-performance ratio is good, but it is not very cost-effective if you buy it at the original price. The seafood dinner is next to the swimming pool. There are two beautiful foreign girls singing English songs. It‚Äôs not bad to listen to songs while eating; I saw a security guard sitting on duty on the beach of the hotel very late, which makes people feel more at ease.
The disadvantage is that the hotel is connected by several buildings, and it is not easy to remember the way immediately if you walk up and down. When I came 21 years ago, I was afraid that this hotel had just opened and it would have a smell. This time, I recommended it to my companions and said to try it. It is under the Accor Group. Generally speaking, it is a hotel with a relatively high price-performance ratio. I will consider this hotel next time.

I was also worried that there was nothing to eat around the hotel, but in the end I realized that I was too worried, and takeaway is very convenient.

I saw on the map that the hotel has a tram charging pile, but I couldn't find it. I had to go around and charge it before coming back. Fortunately, the charging is faster.

The hotel facilities are pretty good, it can be more intelligent, electric curtains, speakers and so on. But you get what you pay for, and the price is relatively high.

The breakfast in the hotel is relatively poor. Although there are many varieties, it is not too suitable for my taste. I only eat rice noodles every day. I put a lot of ingredients in the super luxurious rice noodles, hahahahaha. But Fairmont's breakfast is much better than the hotel I stayed in Sanya Bay before.

Knowing that we are staying on honeymoon, I also helped arrange romantic flowers and cakes in advance, thank you very much ü•∞ü•∞

After the car arrives at the gate, guests must walk through a high nine-hole stone corridor bridge to enter the lobby. The canal under the bridge loops through all six guest house buildings, splitting each one in half. When passing by by boat, I looked up and saw a line of sky. Although the guest room building has only six floors, it looks extremely tall, and the guest rooms seem to be built on the cliff. Looking down from high-rise rooms, the canal is deep and mysterious, especially at night. The guest room building and the main building are connected by water arch bridges and air corridor bridges, forming a complex maze. There are also some antique buildings scattered in the hotel courtyard, such as Shikumen in Shanghai and ancient houses in the south of the Yangtze River. In short, this is a hotel worth savoring carefully. If there are romantic stories and suspense movies choose this place as the background, I think it is very suitable.

msg:I really like Fairmont Kaiwei Sanya so much...
Although Fairmont Sanya Kaiwei Hotel is one of many five-star hotels in Haitang Bay, Sanya, it is also a shining star among all five-star hotels in Haitang Bay, Sanya.

Environment + Service:
The environment is super French, as if you have come to Venice. The hotel lobby has a sense of design, and there are many Dongyang woodcarvings. There is also a wood art museum with the flavor of the Republic of China to visit. Ms. Yiliya, who received our guest relations, was very enthusiastic and helped us arrange the dragon boat check-in. The captain of the dragon was very meticulous and would take pictures for us. Ms. Yiliya is also super pretty. If you need any help, you can contact her at any time and she can help us solve the problem very well.

breakfast:
The hotel breakfast is very rich and has everything you can think of. Hainanese specialties, coconut rice, glutinous rice cakes are delicious, and the smoked salmon is also very fresh.

price:
The room contains a lot of entertainment items, and the price is very high.

What is worthy of praise is that the hotel also has Elf Brigade Photography, brother Xiaoran, he is handsome and has excellent photography skills. I will ask him to take pictures next time I come to Sanya.

It is also very close to the sea. The front desk upgraded the room type for me. It made me feel much better, and there is also one-on-one service. Judy, the guest relations director of Sanya Fairmont, impressed me very much. She is very warm and kind, so that I can feel tired after arriving at the hotel. She introduces the hotel's culture in her explanation Afterwards, I felt a lot more relaxed, and the hotel has a deep cultural background, which is very good. The whole stay is very romantic and full of literary and artistic a**osphere. Those who like this kind of tonality are worth experiencing. You can take pictures here casually It's a blockbuster!

msg:I took my parents on a trip at the end of March. I am 30 years old and my parents are 55. It is very difficult to book a room because there are 3 people. I have considered for a long time and chose the duplex garden-view suite at Kaiwei Fairmont in Haitang Bay. The price is right, and there are also There are many activities and special projects. Everyone has visited the attractions, so we are going to play in the hotel. All the attached content is very suitable.

I would like to boast here, because I was afraid that the actual situation would not match the picture, so I called and asked about the layout of the duplex garden view suite I was looking forward to. After confirming that it was two floors with a bed upstairs and downstairs, I was so happy At the same time, I also learned that there can be a big bed upstairs and two small beds downstairs. So satisfied.

VIP4- VIP check-in privileges:
The day before check-in, the service staff of the hotel called me to finalize the check-in needs, personnel composition, room layout, etc. on the day of check-in. The exclusive butler Diana added my vx to follow up with us throughout the check-in time, etc. Feeling that I have been taken care of all the time, I feel relieved a lot with my parents.
When we checked in at 11 am that day, Diana was waiting for us at the front desk of the hotel. When we arrived at the check-in, he told us that the room had been upgraded to a duplex sea view suite, and that it was in Building 6. I was so happy. The view from Building 6 had an amazing sea view . And the room number I arranged is on the same day as my birthday, everything is so lucky.
After checking in, the butler directly arranged for us to board the boat in the hotel, and took photos of the whole family on the boat for us, and checked in to the building where our room is located by boat. very happy.
After arriving at the room, the butler sent me the photos and the map of the hotel, and circled and marked the places that we will be involved in the itinerary. I felt that the work was too detailed.

After arriving at the room, a welcome fruit plate and red wine snacks were delivered, which can be regarded as rich. In short, the fruits are very fresh, but since there are afternoon tea and cocktail parties, there is no chance to open red wine.

Facilities: The room is a duplex design, with a big bed upstairs and downstairs, and there are bathrooms on both floors, which perfectly meets the accommodation needs of our family of three. They do not disturb each other when resting, and there are balconies on both floors. Downstairs is the shower room and upstairs is the bathtub. There are TVs on both floors üì∫.

After contacting the housekeeper in advance for the Jinzun buffet afternoon tea and Jinzun pre-dinner cocktail party, they both gave us a 3-digit sign. These two projects are located on the first floor of Building 4 of the hotel, in the same location. Afternoon tea and drinks are self-service, the heated scones are very fragrant, and the others are similar to other hotels. It is very suitable for chatting with parents. When it was time for the cocktail party, the waiter served us double portions of food based on the number of us. Basically, after eating enough, dinner is almost the same.

In the hotel package, you can also participate in hotel activities and travel photography. After consulting with the butler, he recommended us to go to the golf course to play putting greens. The arrangement was at 1:30 p.m. the next day, so the butler helped me Did a late checkout until 4! It's just so thoughtful.
Travel photography made an appoin**ent with us when we checked in the day before, and asked us about the number of people and our needs. The little brother took the photos very seriously. In the end, I felt that the selection of the film was not satisfactory. I chose 5 free pictures, and the others were not. wanted.
The hotel's breakfast is also very good, especially the big roasted elbow, which has many layers, which makes this brunch very solid haha.
Before checking out, the butler told us that there was a small gift attached. Overall very happy.

There is also a problem in the hotel that the sound insulation of the room is really not good. In the middle of the night, the guest next door brings their children back, and the whole floor can hear it. In addition, there are mosquitoes, and the mosquito repellent measures in the hotel rooms should be increased.

But on the whole, the flaws are not concealed. The whole hotel is ancient and ancient, especially suitable for our friends in their thirties to bring their parents to spend a few days on vacation. I regret that I didn't arrange a few more days here. Will come to live next time. Especially with a big family there is also a great solution. Like Like!

msg:I have to say good people and good things about Kaiwei Fairmont
We booked a garden-view duplex from 4.24 to 4.26. Summer helped upgrade the sea-view duplex when we checked in. The service throughout the whole process can be described as meticulous and considerate. All the requests sent by WeChat in the two days can be answered in the first time. Curious how she manages to be so busy.
All the services I experienced in the hotel proved that I chose Fairmont too correctly, and all the happiness starts from the moment of check-in.
On the first day of check-in, the staff at the children's pool we went to will take the initiative to send swimming rings to the children. Generally, hotels have to ask for it by themselves. Seeing me scratching my legs and handing me mosquito repellent water, this kind of caring is really unexpected and pleasantly surprised.
In the evening, I went to the western restaurant and just sat down a foreign chef came over to say hello to each table. Ms. Li Jijin asked us what we wanted to eat. We didn‚Äôt order after reading the menu. Ms. Li Knowing that on the first day of our stay, we were afraid that we would not be able to find our way. He was very considerate and sent us all the way to Jinzun. After learning that I had been bitten by midges a lot, he asked the waiter to share the grass oin**ent for me to use.
I met Ms. Chen Yamei at the Jinzun afternoon tea. She gave me the green grass oin**ent. She was also bitten by midges very badly. We are both sick friends. We exchanged a lot of small methods on how to relieve itching and treat it. We had dinner at Jinzun In the past few days, Ms. Chen has been very caring and responsive to our service.
At the same time, I also met a manager Mr. Sun Bin in Jinzun. When he learned that we needed boxes for packing and express delivery, he tried hard to find them in the warehouse, but he went to other places to help us find a particularly suitable box. When he couldn‚Äôt find it, he told the customer that there was no more, but he didn‚Äôt say he couldn‚Äôt find it, but he tried his best to help us solve the problem. He was really touched by the fact that he took the customer‚Äôs needs seriously. The first time I met him, I told him that the hotel‚Äôs breakfast was very good. It was the best among the hotels we stayed in Haitang Bay.
During the stay in the store, the two staff members, Mr. Li and Mr. Ye, who took the children to participate in surfing and tree climbing activities and led the children to play together, were very patient with the children and would remember the names of the children when they met in other areas of the hotel.
Captain Long and Captain Fu will take us on a boat and will introduce us to the various areas of the hotel. People like me who love to ask questions can also patiently answer them.
During our stay, due to time constraints, we failed to catch up with the explanation of the Wooden Art Museum. The curator Minnie specially arranged for me to explain for nearly an hour on the day we left the store, explaining every collection in the exhibition hall in detail. It's great to expand a lot of new and interesting knowledge. It's a pity that our time is limited and I can't finish it. When I was listening to the explanation, there were little brothers from the art museum who helped me take care of the children throughout the whole process.
There are also many staff members with good service who don‚Äôt remember their names. For example, the two waiters and one girl at the private room for 4 people in the private room of the Chinese restaurant service hall during dinner time on 4.25 are also very meticulous and know how to think from the perspective of customers and give considerate services. suggestion.
Every staff member who serves attentively deserves to be remembered and seen! Such a big hotel with so many employees can make every link of the staff so caring and friendly to customers, which shows that the management of the hotel is really hardworking.
Very pleasant two-day stay experience, from the service, environment, meals, everything is very satisfied!

Breakfast is also very rich, freshly squeezed juice, smoothie, homemade yogurt, chocolate croissants, freshly fried fritters, enough. This kind of breakfast is only available in resort hotels in Sanya. The hotel is very big, so there is no traffic except for the breakfast room, which feels like a vacation. Boats similar to gondolas are also very innovative. Sitting on a boat with the sea breeze blowing to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the hotel's gardens is very comfortable and beautiful!

The room facilities are relatively new, with a big balcony, and the super big reclining chair has become a good place for me to drink tea every morning and watch the sunrise, and watch the stars at night. Feel full of leisure vacation. Although the beach in Haitang Bay is not very good, there are activities such as golf putting, copying the Heart Sutra, paddle board and other activities inside the hotel. Adults have a great time, and children have other activities. Each activity was received by service staff and arranged properly. We are very satisfied with these three activities. The swimming pool is also big, but I was afraid of the cold so I never went into the water. The breakfast is very rich, and it is very pleasant to sit outside and watch the garden view. There is a bus stop when you turn right when you go out of the hotel, you can go to the Haitang Bay Food Court, there are restaurants, supermarkets and pharmacies. The hotel drop-off service is also very friendly. When you arrive, you will help to take your luggage and send it to the room. When you leave, you will help to get it from the room to the taxi. Overall, the management of this hotel is very good.

msg:I stayed in three hotels on this trip, and the best one is Fairmont.
The butler Nimo's service is very good. He upgraded our room to Jinzun. The baby was sick and arranged to send ginger water, and fruit and snacks every day. The feeling of being at home made the check-in experience very good.
The hotel can take a boat tour to see the whole picture. The tourists staying in the hotel can make an appoin**ent for a boat tour every day. The breakfast is also the most abundant of this trip. In short, Fairmont feels the most distinctive among the many hotels I have stayed in Sanya.

msg:A strange hotel. First, my friend asked to change the room on the first day he checked in. He promised well, but couldn't realize it for a long time! Later, it was our house. When we booked the house, we asked for double-sided bed surrounds. After staying for two nights, the bed surrounds were not in place. On the third night, the bed surrounds arrived. The two-sided bed surrounds had nothing to do with each other and had no protective effect at all. It fell down at the slightest touch. The welcome fruit and the daily minibar are empty words. There is not even drinking water in the room every day. After staying for four nights, I was given water once! Dined at the hotel's Chinese restaurant and the service attitude was extremely poor! The hotel facilities are old, poor, and damaged! In order to apologize when checking out, the hotel room gave a large buffet dinner and small gifts the night before. This is not a way to retain customers. Changing the check-in experience is what makes a good hotel attractive. This is the first A stay is also the last time!

Environment: The environment of the hotel is good, and the greenery is also very good.
Service: The concierge staff at the hotel are very friendly and will open the door and guide you in time.
The special project of this hotel is the hotel cruise. During the voyage, the captain will also introduce the cultural environment of the hotel, which can be said to be very distinctive. Sitting on a boat and visiting the hotel's park is still very novel.
The hotel's nimo service is very good, very attentive, thank you for your attention and care during the journey
Facilities: There are fewer bedside sockets in the room. Everything else is perfect

Summer from guest relations started to contact me the day before our check-in, and he would reply to any questions in time after check-in. Other hotel staff are also more service-minded. Many, the doorman called the concierge's shuttle bus to the parking lot to pick it up in time. When we checked out, it happened to be waiting for the shuttle bus during peak hours.

Service: Ms. Nimo Liu Tingting who checked in was very kind. Seeing that I was bringing my parents to check in, she also upgraded us to a swimming pool duplex (sea view and garden duplex previously booked). My parents, who have always been very picky, are also very satisfied. In addition, Mr. Hong Sen, who was in charge of receiving us, was also warm and attentive, and specially ordered to send welcome fruits, desserts, and red and white wine, and also provided information on various activities of the hotel.

Jin Zun Afternoon Tea + Jin Zun Cocktail: There are many types of desserts, as well as smoked salmon, chicken, roasted sweet potatoes, salads, cocktails, red and white wine, etc. The desserts made by Master Lang are delicious, and the lightning puffs are well received~

Breakfast: There are too many varieties, every time you can eat enough, a combination of Chinese and Western, and authentic Hainanese noodles ~ I suggest you try ~ But it‚Äôs best to eat around 8:30, there are fewer people ~

Behind the hotel is the sea, you can also see Wuzhizhou Island, and you can see small fish washed up by the waves on the beach. On the night we went, we saw someone holding a wedding, and I was so envious. Every night, the hotel staff sent two coconuts, and the lady who cleaned the room for us also prepared more delicious drinks for us. The hotel is very warm, and the staff we meet will greet us.

msg:First of all, I chose this hotel because I accidentally saw it on Xiaohongshu. At first glance, it was because of the architectural style of the Venetian Water City. It is a unique style among Sanya hotels. It is unique. After staying here, I still like it very much, because The design of the hotel is really attentive~

Second, I fell in love with it from its breakfast, which is so rich that even the Ritz-Carlton can‚Äôt match it. Many breakfasts in the hotel are freshly made by the chef, such as fried dough sticks, hand-pulled noodles, roujiamo, buns Won stew...all are freshly cooked, and there are many more. There are cold dishes and stir-fried dishes for Chinese food. The vegetables for breakfast Chinese food in other hotels are too bland and tasteless, and then I also found that there are crispy elbows for breakfast. Salmon...there are many more. The favorite is Hainan noodles. I also found that there are beef cubes in the ingredients...not to mention, I was too careful~

Finally, I would like to thank my guest relations summer. Every day of my stay, various small snacks are delivered to the room, coconut in the afternoon, refreshing tonic in the evening~ every day, and a gift for the child when I leave~

The hotel also has a lot of high-end parent-child activities, such as golf, surfing, tree climbing, and pottery. It feels higher than the parent-child activities of the Ritz-Carlton. There is also a museum in the hotel, a Chinese-style courtyard house, which is an exhibition hall for collections. Folk utensils are particularly unique.

The decoration style of the hotel is more Chinese and Southeast Asian, and the lobby is well decorated. The entire hotel forms a fan-shaped structure with the lobby as the center and the guest rooms on both sides. The beautiful butler Nimo communicated with us to understand the check-in situation one day before check-in, and arranged the room to make the check-in process very fast. The beautiful butler helped us solve many problems during the entire stay, and gave us a small gift when we left the store. The hotel also sent fruit and snacks, and coconuts were delivered to the room every day. The room is fairly spacious, with a large balcony and comfortable bedding. There is an outdoor swimming pool and a large lawn, the hotel environment is very green, but the trail leading to the beach needs maintenance. The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. The biggest feature of the hotel is to take a small boat tour around the small canal around the hotel, and the architectural museum in the hotel. Captain Bruce Lee and the captain of the fleet who drove the boat introduced in detail the architectural features of the hotel and the origin of the museum during the tour. From this, you can feel the cultural heritage of the hotel.

I am very satisfied with the service here~ ZOE, the service receptionist, asked me patiently about my needs. According to my situation, she took the initiative to help me arrange some services in the hotel. I feel very good~~
When I went on a cruise, I met Captain Yao, who was arranging boarding. He offered to introduce me to some tourist information in the hotel, contact me with the details of the next day‚Äôs travel photography, and also introduced Sanya‚Äôs food (^-^)
You can get five free travel photos when you check in. This place is very popular ~ it is really suitable for all kinds of photos!
There are many types of breakfast and they are delicious~~The environment of sitting in the restaurant and dining outdoors is also great~
Finally, when it comes to the room, it is not as old and old-fashioned as it is said on the Internet. The actual room is much warmer than the pictures shown in the room selected by Ctrip. It is very comfortable to live~

Taking a cruise ship to shuttle between the various buildings of the hotel is like wandering in the water city of Venice, admiring the scenery on both sides of the river, distinctive buildings, covered bridges...
The hotel has its own beach, a 10-minute walk, with several rows of beach chairs for rest.
The rooms are Chinese-style and large in size, and the wicker chairs on the terrace are comfortable. I really enjoy reading on the terrace.
There are many wood carving elements in the hotel, and the covered bridges are ancient and quaint. Friends who like to take pictures will definitely make a big movie.
The breakfast is rich in variety, and there are three places where coffee can be enjoyed nearby.

Here I must thank summer for her warm and thoughtful service, contacting us every day, very heartwarming! Also requested an extra bed and breakfast for us.

All in all, it is a wonderful hotel experience. It is recommended that the customer should choose whether to play guzheng music or not when boarding the boat.
I prefer to listen to the sound of gurgling water and birdsong from nature.

msg:I consider myself a very peaceful person, but this time I was disturbed by this hotel. Let me start with the conclusion: the hotel has some special activities that are relatively interesting, but they are very unsuitable for small family trips; the basic service staff are very nice, but the overall management training of the hotel is poor.

Problem 1: The so-called butler service communication is very confusing.
My wife and son stayed at this hotel for two days. The day before check-in, the hotel housekeeper called me to ask about the check-in time, check-in requirements and other related matters. I replied that I could check in at about one o'clock because I have a one and a half year old. My baby hopes to have an L-shaped bed rail, but has no other requirements. I thought it was a surprise because I booked this hotel on the recommendation of a friend who said the boat cruise and bonfire show were interesting. We didn't come here just for the service.
But when we checked in at about 1:30 the next day, there was no housekeeper at the front desk. After we completed the formalities, we were told that the general room check-in time is 3 pm. Since we arrived earlier, we would try our best to arrange it. Although we felt that checking in at three in the afternoon was a bit unreasonable, we respected the hotel's rules and the hotel also prepared drinks and cookies in the lounge, so we happily went. But the air conditioning in the lounge was too cold, and we were worried about our children catching a cold, so we were wandering around the hotel. Then we received a WeChat message from the housekeeper saying that the room was ready, and we rushed to the front desk. After arriving at the front desk, the guy who had just handled the formalities for us and the young lady next to us were confused and refused to respond to our questions. It was not until the housekeeper called me again and said she was at the front desk opposite that I exploded. The sweltering weather and ineffective communication made me very angry.
The same thing happened with the dragon boat reservation later. The butler said the reservation was made, and the second confirmation also said it was ok. However, when we arrived at the pier, we didn't have our reservation form, and we waited in the Sanya sunshine for half an hour.
Although the leader of the butler later called to apologize, I feel that if the personnel were not well trained, they would not have to provide butler service. It would raise the expectations of the guests and not be able to handle the problem well, which is very funny.

Question 2: Hotel design
The hotel is surrounded by a river, which actually has some characteristics, but the design of three steps, one bridge, and five steps, one step, made us who are used to carrying children in strollers experience a triathlon. The main venue facilities such as parking area, lobby, swimming pool, beach, and breakfast restaurant are far away, and the journey is arduous and makes people speechless.

Question 3: Room air conditioning
Maybe we didn't understand the operation of the air conditioner, but the operation panel clearly showed that it was closed, and the air outlet stopped blowing air. It would not be long before the air conditioner would automatically turn on, causing my wife and I to grab the quilt and wrap ourselves tightly every morning. , unfortunately I lost a bit and now have a bad cold.

But in fact, there are many hotels in Sanya. What some people think are disadvantages may be advantages in the eyes of others. I hope my real experience can give some information to other friends.
I also hope that the hotel friends will not need to contact me because of this comment. I fully recognize your attitude and efforts, but it is true that you have not been able to satisfy us. I hope you can learn from this and serve other guests well.

What is even more shocking is that the stoppers of the bottles and cans in the bathroom easily fell off during use, and the bottles and cans were not clean, with residue in the cracks. The bottles fell out of the shelf accidentally. , and the contents are not sealed. It feels very unhygienic and unsafe! After reporting this to the front desk and housekeeping depar**ent, there was no response. Fairmont used to use the labo brand, but now it feels like it‚Äôs very cheap.

The greening is also very good, mainly because there are no mosquitoes. The variety of breakfast every day is very rich, and the afternoon tea is also good. We live in a double-floor family room for four people. The floor height is very high and it looks a**ospheric and comfortable. There is also a large round bathtub on the balcony. But the water flow is very small, it takes a long time to put the water in once, and the water is cold. This is the worst part. There is only one outdoor swimming pool. When we went, the water was very cold. We swam once in the four days we stayed, and then it was exposed to the sun as shown in the picture. The hotel has travel photography activities, we chose five better ones. There is no extra hard charge, this is good üëçWhen I arrived at the store, although I didn't give welcome fruit immediately, but I made up for it the next night, and I also gave macarons and red wine. On the last day, we sent us a night meal, and four large coconuts. In short, this hotel: good environment, good food and drink, good service, cruise ships are a feature, and the rooms are big. It would be perfect if the water flow in the shower could be stronger! Will come again next time!

msg:When the whole family came to Sanya for a trip, it was definitely a pleasant surprise to choose the Fairmont Hotel as the first hotel. The weather in Sanya in March is mild. 26 or 7 degrees during the day is very comfortable. A view of the hotel step by step. Like a large tropical garden. Stay in a sea view suite. The view from the balcony is absolutely breathtaking. There are also many entertainment activities in the hotel, including golf putting, parent-child games, travel photography, pool parties and so on. Every staff member is very patient and dedicated. In particular, I would like to thank Ms. Zoe, the customer service housekeeper, who is warm and thoughtful, will help solve various check-in problems, and even gave you a thoughtful little gift. Will visit Fairmont again.

I feel the dedication and enthusiasm of Kaiwei. The cruise ship is very leisurely. Captain Yao is very responsible for us. I explained a lot, and the summer sister from the guest relations depar**ent is also very enthusiastic and responsive! The breakfast is very rich and the putting green is also very interesting [Naughty] The only downside is that the hotel is too big and you have to have a good meal wherever you want to go, especially going to the beach... Tired of walking... The scenery is so beautiful! Parents have been recommended to experience it

After experiencing the Internet celebrity Rosewood and Park Hyatt, I think this hotel is more suitable for vacation~~
Although there are many wood carving elements
But there is no strong style of veteran cadres
The overall a**osphere is luxurious
The duplex suite where I live is 2.5 floors up and down
Daily wine and fruit snacks
landscape level
There are trees swimming pool beach sea
rich layers
There is also an Internet celebrity Gongdola cruise ~~ around the hotel for 1,200 meters.

The sand on the beach is fine, but the wind and waves are very strong in late January, so it is not suitable for going into the sea~~
There are photos of beach motorcycles and horse riding by the sea~~
The horse is well behaved but feels a bit skinny

1. Ctrip says 21 years of renovation, but the actual visual inspection is 13 years of renovation. Everywhere is old and obvious
2. The whole process of check in collapsed. The security guard at the hotel gate leaned against the pillars, and there was no response. I booked a sea view king bed room, but the front desk insisted that I booked a garden view room. It didn‚Äôt work if I showed him the order with my mobile phone. blood. There are two rooms. I arrived at 1:30, and I gave one room first, saying that the other room hadn't been cleaned yet. It turned out that the second room was ready at 2.10. Didn't the money I paid start at two o'clock? Here is a double kill. The order stated that the fruit plate will be delivered when we settle in. No one asked us from the time we settled in until 5 o'clock that night. I took the initiative to ask and said: Yes. It is already on the way to deliver. It seems that I asked too much. Half an hour The last small fruit plate arrived in the room. This is Triple kill. We got the first room at 1:40 and said that the luggage would arrive soon. It took 35 minutes for the luggage to arrive. quadra kill.
3. There are many problems with the design of the hotel. The 6 buildings I live in are big and curved inside. I need to turn three corridors and two elevators. My family and I went to the wrong place twice a day.
4. The hotel is too big. You can hardly see the waiters after check-in.
There are still some advantages. The greenery is good and it is close to the sea
But this advantage, every hotel next to it has it
So in summary: not recommended

I decided to stay one more night, and I will stay again in the future to experience the many activities of the hotel that I didn't have time to experience this time.

The decoration style of the hotel has some Southeast Asian styles. The wooden structure feels a little old-fashioned, but it can't hinder the unique temperament of the hotel.
There is a small river that runs through every building in the hotel. You can take a boat tour. There are many fish in the river, which is crystal clear
Let‚Äôs talk about the service. The butler Zoe‚Äôs service is very good. He gave each of us a welcome fruit. Before leaving, he even gave the children a souvenir and responded positively to any questions, which is commendable.
Because it is a temporary stay for one day, I have to catch a flight the next day, so I haven't experienced many facilities in the hotel. I will stay here next time.

I lived in Westin before, and my friend introduced me to experience it for the first time. , I found that the cost performance and service here are definitely several blocks away from Westin. Compared with Fairmont, Westin's service and facilities are really far behind. It seems that one or two good services can really be exchanged Praise for the entire hotel! Next time, I will directly book Fairmont without thinking about it!

The design of the lobby is mostly Chinese style, with antique flavor and some French style, the whole hotel is grand and elegant. When there are a lot of people, the check-in is still in order. Occasionally, there will be one or two businesses that may not be familiar with, and it will be a little slower. The service quality in other aspects is very good! The hotel room is large, there are round lounge chairs on the balcony, and you can have a drink at night. The sanitation is spotless, even if it is a bit slow to notify the cleaning, they may not be able to stay busy when the room is full. The facilities are quite satisfactory, after all, it has been open for many years. The hotel is very close to the beach, you can go directly to the beach along the direction of the swimming pool, passing a large lawn in the middle. The biggest highlight of this hotel is taking a gondola boat along the river to surround the hotel, especially the feeling of Venice Water City.

msg:It‚Äôs rare to write a comment ~ for your reference ~
This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at at the same price!
1: When we got off the bus on the day of check-in, we stood there with our sleeping child and luggage for a long time. The luggage guy didn‚Äôt respond because the child was too heavy and couldn‚Äôt move his hands. I asked loudly: What should I do with the luggage? The bellman came forward to pick up the luggage!
2: After checking in at the front desk, the front desk staff upgraded the sea view room to Building 6 and said it was a bit far away. We expressed our gratitude and carried our children all the way to Building 6. I asked several waiters along the way, but they couldn't explain clearly at once and pointed casually, so I couldn't figure out the direction at all.
3: Then let‚Äôs talk about the room. It‚Äôs really hard to describe the room. I paid close to 2k for a room. It‚Äôs really unsatisfactory because I just came from Intercontinental that day. There is no harm without comparison. The room is not very big overall and is very old and dirty. feeling dirty;
The wall will still fall off!
What‚Äôs even scarier is: when I open the balcony door at night, there are several geckos on the wall! ! ! Fortunately, we went as a family, and my husband was there, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to sleep that night! What I was most afraid of was this kind of reptile! The balcony is useless.. Our balcony door was locked during the entire stay! I didn‚Äôt dare to open it!
4: One day before check-in, a hotel staff messaged us on WeChat to ask about the situation and clearly informed us that there were children under three years old. However, when we arrived in the room, there was nothing. We called and asked for the children‚Äôs utensils later!
Not even the most basic care package (cotton swabs)! I also called and asked for it to be delivered!
5: When I was booking a hotel, I saw that the above series of package binding activities were basically not used much. You had to make a reservation by phone in advance and then go to the site in person to queue up. There was a cruise ship. Ask the staff and answer. It's all very perfunctory, and I feel like I don't know everything about it.
The overall impression given by the waiters is: don't come and ask me, don't come and ask me, pretend you can't see it!
6: When we went back to the room to ask about the elevator after dinner in the morning, we asked three waiters along the way. The three waiters all mentioned different places. Finally, one of them, who must be the manager, sent us to the elevator door. The sign was not clear.
7: The overall feeling is that the hotel management is lacking, the service staff are lazy and lax, and the service awareness and attitude cannot keep up with the five-star standards. Because I have stayed in several hotels of the same price in Haitang Bay before, this one is the worst!
8: The details of the room are not in place, lacking this and that...
Rooms cost up to a few hundred yuan! It can only be said that the appearance of the hotel is only superficial, and the hotel's superficial appearance makes people feel okay, but the details and services cannot withstand scrutiny.
9: There was a gecko in the room and he said it was because he didn‚Äôt have time to disinfect it. He also said he wanted to come to my room to capture the gecko! ! ! I'm really grateful!
Shouldn‚Äôt this kind of disinfection work be done in advance? !
It is even more not recommended if you are a girl! Unless you like the feeling of being in Chongling Mountains and experience the dance of nature and animals, you can come and experience it!
The final summary is: the overall service attitude is poor, and the difference between it and others is quite big! The details are also very poor, the rooms are old and unsophisticated. People who pay attention to details are advised not to come.
Of course, it varies from person to person, and there may be some people who like ancient buildings and pay attention to the appearance to check in, which is another matter!
Don‚Äôt come if you have children! So ungrateful!
By the way, there are still mold spots when the quilt is lifted!

Because I had to catch a flight the next day, I planned to stay for only one day. As a result, the lower the expectations, the more surprises.

Service: Very enthusiastic, the housekeeper Derrick also added my WeChat in advance. Because it was a honeymoon, the waiter brought small cakes, chocolates, and red wine in the afternoon, and the plates were beautifully arranged, which was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel is relatively large. You can contact the little brother to pick up the shuttle to and from the garage. The response is very fast. When driving, pay attention to the various speed bumps to prevent us from bumping.

Facilities: The room is very quiet, the view outside the window is super good, you can see the blue sea and blue sky in the distance, and a coconut grove. There is a wood art museum in the hotel, which is a historical relic bought by the developer earlier, it is worth visiting!

Hygiene: very clean.

Environment: There are so many activities in the hotel, we had so much fun that we didn't even need to go out. We experienced golf, hand-written heart scriptures, watched little beauties dancing, and magic and clown performances. It was very fulfilling.

Breakfast: This is the biggest surprise, the best in the hotels I have stayed in these days, especially the desserts are very good. On Sunday morning, I also met foreign chefs who were inspecting, tasting and pointing out problems one by one.

Sea water rhyme river cruise experience in the hotel: This requires an appoin**ent, which is more distinctive, and there are many people queuing up.

The woods and lawns in the garden are patchwork, and the beach is facing Wuzhizhou Island, with fine sand and wide sea view. The Rhyme River is a highlight, you can visit the hotel by boat, if you can reach the room by boat, it will be perfect! The hotel is specially equipped with guest relations service personnel, who will contact and arrange various services and itineraries in the hotel in advance. The room was upgraded during this check-in, which is very thoughtful. Thank you for the thoughtful and meticulous arrangement of this guest service summer!

msg:I spent a week on vacation in Hainan and experienced five hotels. Only Fairmont Sanya is inferior in all aspects. Ctrip please be careful when cooperating with this hotel. It is promoting its hotel products and destroying your own brand.

1. The front desk is poor: I came to check in at 12 o'clock and was informed that there were no vacancies and had to wait until 3 o'clock, so I had no choice but to accept it. But the open lobby was very hot, and I could only endure it by squeezing on the sofa. During this period, no service staff came to comfort and explain, or informed me of the check-in time, and they didn't even ask if I wanted a glass of water. I had no choice but to store my luggage and go to a restaurant outside to eat and enjoy the cool weather. When it was 3 o'clock, I asked the front desk and was shocked to hear that no room had been cleaned out, so I had to continue waiting without any explanation or comfort. Didn't check in until 3:40. This is a dereliction of duty at the front desk.

2. Concierge: After obtaining the room card, go to the concierge to collect the stored luggage. But neither inside nor outside the lobby was found. I really can't imagine what kind of service capabilities can lead to a guest's luggage being lost in just two or three hours! During this period, some service staff suggested that we go back to the room to rest and wait for them to find our luggage. So we went to the guest room, but thinking about the missing items made us really worried and angry. Half an hour later, my luggage was recovered. I asked why and the answer was: it was sent to someone else's room by mistake! This is a dereliction of duty on the part of the concierge.

3. Poor guest rooms: The room facilities are good, but the sanitary condition is worrying. There are still crumbs of biscuits on the footrest in front of the bed. The floor was dirty and sticky. After reporting it to the front desk, we were told that the housekeeping staff could come back to clean the room and were willing to provide us with executive lounge benefits as compensation. We reluctantly accept it. This is a dereliction of duty on the part of the guest room staff.

4. Poor food and beverage: I went to the lounge at 5:30 and was told that the happy hour was not a buffet, but only provided a plate of snacks - a few pieces of cake, fried lotus root slices, fried spring rolls, nothing else! In a five-star hotel, the executive lounge‚Äôs happy hour didn‚Äôt even have hot dishes, and there was no wine list, no cocktails, only a pitiful amount of canned beer, Coke, Sprite and other drinks! It‚Äôs hard to believe that Fairmont is such a substandard product! This is a dereliction of duty in the catering industry!

Summary: Fairmont is flashy and vain. In just one day, I witnessed the failure of the front desk, concierge, guest rooms, and catering, which is really unacceptable. Will not stay at any Fairmont hotels in the future!

The layout of the room is not user-friendly, the washbasin is too shallow, and the water splashes everywhere; there are no chairs in the room, so it is really inconvenient to sit in the living room and do makeup; the mattress is not bad, Moderately hard and soft, very comfortable to sleep on. The breakfast is not bad, and the environmental dishes are all good. It is best to have some Hainan special refreshments next time haha!

They are both owned by Accor, Fairmont Chinese style, Sofitel French style, the service is very good, and the rooms are very spacious and large , Transparent, much better than Shangri-La.
Dining Fairmont is better. It's a pity that the fruit does not have mangoü•≠, it is recommended to increase it.
Fairmont has a golf putting green. I played for two days and it was great.
On the 15th day of the first ***** month, Fairmont held the Lantern Festival, which was great. It was the right choice to come to Fairmont for the traditional festival.
The downside is that Fairmont does not have a heated swimming pool, and the water is still very cold during the Spring Festival. The management and organization on the beach are mainly for villa sales, and the experience is a bit poor.

msg:Strong Amway! I'm going to start seriously reviewing
After the Spring Festival holiday, I temporarily decided to go to Sanya to play before my children started school. I first considered Yanlord. If I didn‚Äôt book No. 3, I thought about finding a convenient hotel in Haitang Bay. I just saw Fairmont, didn't make a strategy for the hotel, just ordered a room without breakfast, and added it when I thought about it.
A lot of surprises~
The day before the check-in, I contacted me in advance about the number of people staying and the situation of the personnel. The next day, I went to Sanya butler to add me on WeChat and send me the hotel activity list.
When I arrived at the store at 2:30, I was first impressed by the hotel's environmental experience. It was built around the river. I put down my luggage and checked in. When the ID card was given, I was told that the room had been arranged and I could go live directly. Upgraded me to a sea view room, and gave me two breakfasts. During this Spring Festival holiday, the hotel has a lot of fans~
Next, I entered the room, prepared fruits and pastries, and gave chicken soup at night. The facilities are very new. The oversized bathtub is on the balcony, and there is a wood-carved desk, all of which are the characteristics of the hotel's own style, so I won't describe them here~
The hotel housekeeper added WeChat to send me the activity list before coming, and immediately arranged for us to participate in the Little Chef activity at 3:00 üë®‚Äçüç≥, it was a great activity, and the time was just right, not too rushed.
Later we will go to the cruise ship of the hotel. During the cruise, the little brother will introduce the situation of the hotel, where and what to do. He is very considerate and has done every detail. I also went to the Wood Sculpture Art Museum. I suggest that everyone have time to visit and feel it up close. It is really a work of art that can be touched.
Next to the art gallery is the golf driving range, which is very beautiful and suitable for taking pictures.
We didn't participate in other activities, because the time is relatively tight~ If you have enough time, you can calm down and visit the hotel. The baby is more interested in the beach, and the hotel also provides sand digging tools, so you don‚Äôt need to bring it yourself~ There is a helipad on the way to the beach, and you can also take picturesüì∑. Stay at home, experience the happiness of the hotel
Later, when we stayed in Yanlord, Yanlord was full of rooms, and the experience would be discounted. We didn‚Äôt have enough time to experience Yanlord‚Äôs children‚Äôs activities. Each has its own advantages, but if I go to Sanya again, I will still choose Fairmont to stay again~

I ordered a duplex suite with two and a half floors, bright and spacious, and a good view. The big bathtub is very distinctive, but it is located on the balcony, and the downstairs can be seen clearly, so you can only soak in a swimsuit.
The quality of the staff is very high. The summer who received my family was very meticulous, and dealt with all the minor problems patiently and thoughtfully. They would send WeChat greetings every day, especially giving extra points to the hotel.
In terms of food and drink: the breakfast is rich, all the juices are freshly squeezed, and there is no shadow of concentrated juice. Suites can use the lounge, but the lounge does not provide light meals for dinner, only unlimited afternoon tea.
In terms of facilities: it is very unique to go around the hotel by boat, and the children's club activities are also good. But the children's playground is too small, the pool water is cold, and there is only a small hot spring pool, which is a pity. It would be perfect if it is a heated swimming pool.

As far as your breakfast is very comfortable, the quality is good. Although there are no high-end ingredients as imagined, basically speaking, the quality of food is still acceptable. The SF Express arrived at home, which is also remarkable. They can respond to every request. Their mattresses are relatively soft for me.

Also, from time to time, we will ask us about some needs and suggestions about the room. They can also help us directly make appoin**ents for some activities, as well as the arrangement of the Duty Free City, etc. The service is simply not too considerate.
In addition, Lin Hongsen, the housekeeper of the room, gave the children a small gift and didn't have time to receive it. He sent a game guide and spoke good English. He could help us solve any problems in time, and helped us arrange the coffee machine in time. Adjus**ent, I am also paying attention to some of our check-in experience at any time.

The hotel has a lot of woodcarving designs. I heard that it is Dongyang woodcarving, and the craftsmanship is very exquisite! Judy, the guest relations officer, took great care of us too! Thanks to her very much, the child helped to print a lot of homework during the online class. The hotel's breakfast is also very good! Hope to have time to stay longer next time.

Sea water rhyme river cruise experience in the hotel: very good
Daily Mingxing College parent-child activities: very rich
Exploring the century-old wooden art museum: very distinctive

Environment: The landscaping is well done, the selling point is a Venetian canal, and you can take a boat tour of the hotel for free with the room card. The captain Yao who received us has a very good service attitude, answering every question, and also introducing the places worth visiting inside and outside the hotel.
Facilities: A Chinese-style hotel with a very good location. It is very convenient to go anywhere. You can get there within 10 minutes by car, and you can see the Ferris wheel at the location. There is a helicopter ride, 898 seven kilometers, the beach is very clean, there are few people, there are two pavilions shipped from Hangzhou, and desserts and fruits are given away on the first night. There are also five travel photos, and the photographer is also very professional, patiently guiding the two children to take pictures.
Hygiene: Everything is good, good, someone will come to clean it the next day, and the minibar will be replenished.
Service: The customer service sister Summer is kind and beautiful. She called me one day in advance to ask my needs, and prepared a box of water, children's products, etc. for me. The key point is to respond to requests. Our room only includes breakfast for 2 adults, and half price for children over 7 years old. I also brought two elderly people with me. She helped me apply for free breakfast, which saved 1140 yuan. In addition, the faucet in my room was broken and my clothes were wet. She helped me apply for free laundry service, which was free of charge together with my laundry service the day before. Also gave me two extra coconuts as compensation. Before leaving, prepare notes for my two children... There are too many details, and I remember everything. Next time I go to Haitang Bay, I will definitely come back to live here!

I received a call from the hotel the day before check-in, asking about check-in time and special needs, and the housekeeper Nimo added WeChat the next day. A perfect experience has begun!
There are many people serving the hotel, all of whom are warm and thoughtful. You can experience high-quality service from the moment you get off the bus. Butler Nimo is meticulous, helping to print children's study sheets, giving fruit snacks, etc.
The hotel has picturesque scenery, quietness and comfort, history and modernity are compatible, and quality enjoyment is reflected everywhere.
The breakfast is also very rich.
When I left the hotel, I was worried about one thing, whether the hotel service in the future could be the same as that of Fairmont, and it turned out that the next five hotels were not as good as his home. . . .

msg:Thanks to the butler Diana for her considerate service throughout the whole process. I am very satisfied with the check-in experience. There are not only check-in gifts but also check-out gifts. It is a luggage tag with initials engraved on it. It is really a surprise. It made me completely find the kind of stay in Macau experience! Resolutely continued to live, and will choose here next time. Thank you Diana for upgrading the room type for us. Although it is the farthest building No. 6 (it‚Äôs really a long way to goüòÇ, so far away that you get lost on the first day), but it is indeed a location with a good view, not only can you see the sea view but also There is a view of the hotel. The large bathtub and bed-like recliner are really comfortable. As soon as you enter the room, you will see the gifts thoughtfully prepared by the hotel. Fairmont is relatively quiet and comfortable, and the service is really good, as long as reasonable requests are made, they will be satisfied. We will also do a satisfaction survey when we eat breakfast. I said it casually on the first day of check-in, and for breakfast the next day, we prepared potato cakes made by the master after learning and cooked wonton stew for us. It‚Äôs not too much Impressed and the hash browns are super delicious. Wontons are already there. Tell the hotel and they will cook them for you. But because it was not on the table, we thought that the staple food was only flour on the first day. The frozen coconut sent by the hotel is also super delicious. There is a constant temperature swimming pool. The guests who stay seem to be able to experience unlimited cruises for free. From 10 to 6 o'clock, they can disembark at the location of the room. The last cruise experience was in Venice, Macau haha. There is no time to go to the Centennial Museum of Art. They also gave us travel photos as a gift, and we need to make an appoin**ent in advance, because we coordinated and gave us 10 photos for free after two days of check-in. There seems to be a short performance of dolls in the lobby at night. Overall super satisfied!
Service: Superb! Before check-in, a dedicated butler will contact you in advance and provide full service. I am very grateful to Diana for answering questions after get off work.
Environment: There is an Internet celebrity check-in point in the hotel lobby, which is very nice to take pictures. The hotel is very big. After getting out of the car and walking into the front desk, you walk as long as picture 1. It feels like the appearance is a combination of retro, courtyard, and garden. The hotel has a large lawn full of films, and the seaside is also quite clean.
Facilities: I think the facilities are relatively complete and perfect, newly renovated in the past two years. The only thing I think is the design of the washbasin in the room is a bit tasteless, the water is very shallow and will splash outüòÇ, and the mirror can be folded out.
Hygiene: Very clean, no unclean places were found. trustworthy.

msg:I have stayed in all the famous hotels in Haitang Bay, but Fairmont is the one I want to write about most. Fairmont is a hotel with water characteristics. It is winding and winding, and the boats around the sea shuttle through every river and pass every room, which is unique.
         The greatest favor for Fairmont comes from the concept and awareness of service. The housekeeper, Frank, took the initiative to add WeChat before I checked in, and waited in the lobby in advance, which made people feel very warm, and the goodwill increased. The gentle and patient words broke the strangeness, and a hotel miniature map was handed over to give a detailed overview of the hotel Each feature, catering, spa, children's play, swimming pool, seaside, etc., is detailed and not long-winded, and the very professional service makes me feel that it is not inferior to other brand-name hotels with 3000+.
        I would also like to give special praise to the handsome guy who provides the boating service. I didn‚Äôt see his name tag clearly. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, it should be Chen Mingli. Once again, the hotel's training on the service awareness of service personnel has greatly increased its favor.
        I won‚Äôt go into details about the room, the price/performance ratio is too high, and the distance from the beach is a bit far compared to other hotels. In short, the next Haitang Bay vacation will definitely be a second choice for Fairmont. It‚Äôs worth staying. Thanks again to our butler Frank for this trip.

It is also because I have stayed in Fairmont hotels in different countries many times. This brand is trustworthy! And the Fairmont in Haitang Bay is full of surprises! Once you enter the room, you can enjoy the intimate card and the charming scenery. You can also row a boat in the hotel to experience the feeling of "Venice". The daily variety of meals and desserts are endless, and you can enjoy the real golden courtesy. The service of the hotel is even more meticulous. I would like to thank Diana, the housekeeper, who is as warm as a family~ This hotel is really the cost-effective ceiling of Haitang Bay. When I parted, I gave a small gift. It is an unforgettable journey. Next time Will definitely choose Kaiwei Fairmont

The key is that there are few people, and you can also choose to bask in the sun outside While eating breakfast, the waiters in the restaurant are not very old, but the service is very considerate. During the dinner, I had a dinner in the Chinese restaurant. Since it is difficult for one person to order, the waiter introduced a set meal for one person, which is very suitable for me. There are many types. There is also Wenchang chicken with a strong sense of ritual; after dinner, I chose facial trea**ent and body spa, the price is good, Flowna's technique is very good, I have already made an appoin**ent for the next time, I like the good night dessert Ye very much, and I will choose to stay next time.

msg:If you can't leave Sanya for a weekend trip, Haitang Bay has become the first choice! I have been watching the dragon boat of the water system before, and I have been thinking about it for a long time, and I finally have a reason to travelüòä
Book a room one day in advance. On Saturday morning, guest relationship Diana called to confirm the arrival time and informed the epidemic policy. Sanya people don‚Äôt have to worry about dine-in issues and are happyü•∞. After knowing that there are children, they helped to prepare supplies, and wechat let the hotel inform She is still very satisfied with the beginning of the holiday. . . .
Check-in, guest room from üé™: The concierge stopped the car at the door and immediately helped to take the luggage, and the car was loaded in one go, because I drove here by myself, and a battery car followed to the parking lot to pick up my family. The service is really in place. It feels flattering to check in at the lobbyüòÖ. The five staff members brought welcome drinks and garlands to check in. They were really surprised by the various services and greetings. After checking in, Diana sent us all the way to the room. The room was fully equipped with children‚Äôs supplies (footstool, bathrobe, toothbrush), mainly a small tent, and a cute deer (children have no resistance to tents, the deer The doll is also held all the time, and I have to hold it when I go to bed at night. I asked my aunt Xiaolu if I can take it away? ü§ó, Diana said very readily that it was prepared for the children, super happy) There is also a welcome ceremony in the room, children Kill them all directly, if it is not enough, I still took a photo üéÅ. Diana also sent text messages to inform the hotel of various activities in great detail, and kept asking if there was anything I needed to make an appoin**ent for. Any questions? Really full marks for service
   The activity experience from ‚ú®: The purpose of arriving at the hotel is the dragon boat, and it will start immediately after putting down the luggage. Diana also took us to register for the boat when she met us in the lobby (because there are not many people in the hotel and there is no limit to the number of times ü§©), Diana returned it to the children Arranging fish food, I was super happy. The dragon boat was done twice in a row. The second time, because my father wanted to take pictures of us, he kept chasing us on the shore. The staff also cooperated very slowly so that my father did not worry. I felt ashamed, and the staff gave balloons to the children when I disembarked. I have to say that the staff are also versatile. The next morning, I made an appoin**ent for a golf experience. In fact, I wanted the children to experience it. I also met the employee who delivered the balloons the day before. I must mention the name: Chen Mingli (I asked for the name specifically), and I have been patiently teaching the children for half an hour. , I was really patient with a three-year-old child who ran around, and even drove us back to the room. It must be emphasized that any guests must go to him (the balloon flowers made even adults like it). I went to the swimming pool before leaving. The children had a great time. The staff kept reminding me that the water is very cold and there is hot water in the pool, which is very considerate
Dining experience: Because I was in Sanya, I just ate breakfast. Maybe because the occupancy rate is not high, I just opened a small restaurant. It doesn‚Äôt seem to eat a lot, but definitely everyone likes everything, duck breast , beef, fried eggs, and yogurt are all dragon fruit and oa**eal, and the taste is also very good
   Wooden Art Museum I üéà: I have to say that Fairmont has a top-secret treasure. I remember that it was not open a long time ago, but now it is open to the public, and there are explanation activities. There is a feeling of being in a courtyard in an ancient town. I have to say that his site selection is also very good. You can't see the tall buildings outside at all in the courtyard. There are really only blue bricks and blue sky.
   To sum it up, the service is super good. Diana even gave us a souvenir when we left the store. As an office worker, I fully understand the feeling of caring about guests during vacations. Thank you very much, and Chen Mingli made my baby have a wonderful event experience , This trip has to be said to be a complete holiday. Every employee in the hotel will greet each other with a smile. Wearing a mask under the epidemic situation blocks too many expressions, but everyone's attitude still makes us feel enthusiastic!

msg:1. Hotel environment: The overall style design is really diverse. The exterior of the building is Mediterranean style, and the interior decoration is atypical Chinese design + Balinese style. The courtyard landscape has some Southeast Asian flavors, and it also mixes old houses in Ming and Qing Dynasties. I really can‚Äôt find a second one in Sanya. I don‚Äôt know if the designer has a clear idea or the Boss has too many ideas, but after adding the elements of artificial canals and wharfs, there seems to be a connection between the multiple styles, and the sense of discord has also faded. .
2. Service: This is the biggest highlight of this stay experience. Before check-in, the guest relations starry called in advance to communicate their needs and arranged the room. During the check-in period, they responded to their needs and responded quickly. Although the number of diners has dropped sharply due to the impact of the epidemic, the service has not been reduced. , especially the meticulous and warm and thoughtful service provided by Executive Sous Chef Tom Wang and Food and Beverage Wei Wei to the children, we are very satisfied! Almost all the hotel service staff I have contacted maintain a well-trained hospitality standard. Like the Sofitel hotel I stayed in before, it seems that Accor's professionalism is still in the same strain!
3. Links to be improved: The overall landscape design level of the hotel's courtyard is average, especially the central lawn and trails adjacent to the sea are quite cramped, the villa areas on the left and right sides are planned in a disorderly manner, and a large part of the architectural style does not match the hotel building facade, and Occupying the area of greenery and trails, all the hotels in Haitang Bay that I have stayed in before have area plans for villa areas, but none of them have grown in disorder like Fairmont. Although the hotel has only opened for more than a year, the roof and outdoor facilities of the building are slightly worn out. I don't know why? Many parts of the public area of the hotel are filled with real estate marketing advertisements, which is a bit deviating from the a**osphere of the resort hotel.
In general, Fairmont's inherent quality is still basically maintained, but there are also some links that have been blended with Chinese characteristics...

msg:Very unexpected treasure hotel. I read the reviews before and said that it is very old and has many mosquitoes... I only booked for one night and regretted it badly. I really like the tune of this hotel. Thank you very much for Nimo's warm hospitality. All children's activities helped us in advance We made an appoin**ent, and the room type was also upgraded for free. The golden afternoon tea reserved for us was very cost-effective, and the little hamburger children liked it very much. The hotel is very suitable for taking pictures. Next time you come, you must stay for a few more nights. The only regret is that this time I live in Building 1, 1420, which is relatively close to the lobby, but it is difficult to dry clothes. Jinzun is Building 4, which is equivalent to the administrative building of other hotels. Yesterday, I experienced afternoon tea in the lobby. The sea breeze was so strong that we fell asleep directly. better. Although the parent-child activities of this hotel are not as good as the Kaaba InterContinental, it is not bad. Anyway, come next time! The hotel's free soft drinks in the minibar are not a single Coke Sprite, there are many kinds, especially the coconut tree brand coconut water, which children like very much.

msg:The 4-day Kaiwei Fairmont Hotel (the name of the hotel is a bit awkward) was booked by accident. The hotel is surrounded by the imported sea water, which is a bit like Hainan's Venice. The environment in the hotel is shady with trees and scenery everywhere. The afternoon tea provided by the hotel was only enjoyed on the day of check-out, which was a bit rushed, which was a pity. However, I still want to thank the hotel housekeeper Hank for helping us solve the small problems in time, especially the staff who came to clean the room during the 4 days of our stay. Leave us a few more bottles of mineral water, specially reserved for us to make tea, very moved. Thanks!
I also want to mention two points to the hotel, the hotel's supporting hardware comments, 1. Such a good hotel, the hotel's toilet is not smartüöΩ, and the toilet does not seem to have an exhaust fan, this is a bit speechlessüòì. 2. In such a high temperature place in Sanya, there is no air conditioner in the hotel lobby. After checking in, you can get soaked all over. After drinking afternoon tea, you have to go back to the room to take a shower, which is very embarrassing.
But this hotel stay, overall is good. Let us have good memories of this vacation. Thanks!

The coconut milk that welcomes you at the entrance is specially made by the chef, and you have to drink a few glasses every day.

I am very lucky to have arranged a sea view suite with a good view. Ctrip also has a dedicated service butler. Laura provides attentive service from check-in to check-out, which is more convenient and meticulous than calling the front desk.
The service taste of the Chinese restaurant and the western restaurant can‚Äôt be said either. The western restaurant saw that we were scratching our legs, and took the initiative to take the toilet water to repel mosquitoes (the dishes have been commented on by the public); Missed business hours, no one answered the phone in the back kitchen, turned off the fire and got off work, the front desk specially rushed to the back kitchen to ask the chef to help make it, and then turned on the fire again to eat freshly baked soft Chinese dim sum
The only thing is that the price is more expensive in the peak season, and I will come back in the off-season when I look back.

msg:Detailed review of Fairmont Sanya Haitang Bay (Garden View Duplex Suite)

1. Overview | Overview
The hotel's comprehensive recommendation index is five stars! I am an Accor Platinum member, ota superimposed with Sanya consumption coupons to book a three-night Fairmont Gold Bottle Sea View King Room, call the hotel affiliate member in advance, and upgrade to a garden view duplex suite when I arrive at the store.
The biggest highlight of the hotel is the high cost performance, the excellent products and services of Jinzun Lounge, as well as the canal and gondola cruise around the six buildings. As well as the mixed living of the hotel and the villas sold, the privacy is not strong. In addition, the two high-rise buildings next to the hotel (Poly Rosewood and Waldorf Astoria) are also incompatible with the hotel style.

2. Room | In Room
The entire hotel consists of the lobby and six main hotel buildings. Buildings 1, 3, and 5 are on the left side of the lobby, and buildings 2, 4, and 6 are on the right. Among them, five or six buildings are closest to the sea, but the owner took five buildings back and packaged them into serviced apar**ents. The project is for sale...
The most interesting point of the hotel is that an artificial canal is designed to run through all the main hotel buildings. The canal passes through the middle of each building, so each building is actually composed of two slab buildings with corridors in the middle.
After I arrived at the store, I was told to upgrade to a duplex suite with garden view. I was a little unhappy when I heard that there was no sea view at first, and asked if I could downgrade to the originally booked Jinzun sea view room, but the front desk told me that the original room type was full. It's so beautiful, and I quickly said that the whole hotel is far from the sea because of its low floor. Even the sea view room has a very general sea view, and the duplex suite with garden view for me can actually see the sea.
It was already late, so I took my luggage and went to my room. The room was located on the sixth floor (top floor) of Building No. 4.
As soon as you enter the door, there is a walkway, the guest guard on the right, the stairs on the left, and the living room sofa and writing desk. Opposite the sofa is a painted TV cabinet, and there is an irregular-shaped balcony outside the living room. There are many decorative partitions outside the downstairs balcony, and the eaves upstairs are shading, resulting in poor lighting in the living room.
Take the stairs to the second floor, the lighting is much better, because the balcony on the second floor is a terrace, the overhead is not blocked, and you can see a little side sea view from the balcony and bed, the overall layout of the second floor is very compact, and the open master bathroom is on the right when you come up , the single basin is facing the big bed, there is only a roller blind in the middle, and the bathtub can only be placed on the terrace.
The whole room is decorated in traditional Chinese style, using a lot of wooden furniture. It felt very ordinary at first, but after two days of living, it felt okay. The duplex structure is also very suitable for families with children. Adults and children can each occupy one. The layers do not interfere with each other. In addition, although the large bathtub on the terrace is not very private, it is still very pleasant to take a bath when the weather is good and watch the sea and clouds. Anyway, as long as you are not embarrassed, it is others...

3. Dining | Dining
Jinzun Lounge is located on the first floor of Building No. 4. Currently, there is no breakfast. Drinks, biscuits and red wine are available from 11:00 am to 10:00 pm, afternoon tea from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, and happy hour from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm! The overall Jinzun Lounge experience is very good. It can be said that it is one of the best lounges I have experienced in Sanya and even in China. The afternoon tea desserts are of high quality, and there are fried chicken nuggets and other food that children like to eat. Happy hours are all Small plates of fine food, as well as delicious silky soup and six freshly brewed cocktails.
The breakfast restaurant is located in the cafeteria on the first floor of the lobby. The most eye-catching is the escalator leading from the restaurant to the lobby. There are many kinds of breakfast, including three kinds of freshly squeezed juices, honeycomb honey, many hot dishes, and many meat choices. I went earlier and didn't see the legendary freshly made pineapple buns. 6

4. Facilities | Facilities
The hotel's main facilities are located on the first floor of Building 6, such as a spa center, children's playground and gym, and there is a children's reading center on the second floor.
There are only three swimming pools, namely the lagoon swimming pool on the first floor of Building 6 (connected to the pool room), the children's swimming pool (small) and the main swimming pool next to it. I personally feel that there is no adult swimming pool. .
There is also a mini golf course next to the lobby, and the hotel also has a wooden culture exhibition hall.

5. Unforgettable moments | the Moments
The experience of staying in this hotel is very fragmented. On the one hand, the style of the hotel room is very Chinese, but the appearance of the hotel and the canal gondola are very exotic. The hotel hardware is very old, but the service staff is full of vitality. Feeling young, the interior of the hotel creates a strong sense of vacation, but there is a circle of roads and villas open to the outside world around the hotel. There are two high-rise buildings next to it, and even the fifth building, which is closest to the sea, is being renovated and sold... ‚Ä¶
It can only be said that AccorHotels has been trying to rebuild this hotel, but some of its own flaws doom it that this hotel will not become a classic.
Of course, when the weather is good, taking a gondola at the hotel pier and taking ten minutes to travel around the hotel is still a very strange experience. It is worth visiting this hotel for this.

6. Conclusion | Conclusion
Because of the ultra-low price (more than 700 a night) to stay in a Jinzun King Room and a free upgrade to a garden-view duplex suite, I personally feel that it is almost the same as living in white. , is definitely the king of cost performance in Haitang Bay!

The hotel has an internal creek for boat rides, and it is about a 5-minute walk from the beach.
There will be a hotel service staff who will call in advance and we will check in at 12 o'clock. As soon as you get off the bus, someone will help you with your luggage to the room, and there are many parent-child activities every day. Sharry is very caring, answering any questions, and also gave a small gift when checking out. The room service staff are also very nice and will prepare children's toiletries.
The breakfast buffet is not bad. It is recommended that the hotel develop children's meals and improve the quality of the Chinese restaurant Yuexuan.

When it comes to hotel facilities, it is really average. The design of the hotel room is too bad. The bathtub is actually designed on the balcony. If you take a bath, everyone in the surrounding room can see the bathroom on the balcony. There is no door in the bedroom, and the mirror in the bathroom is actually designed on the side. I just want to ask the designer if you need to twist your neck to look in the mirror after washing your faceüò§. Then there is the hotel like a maze, from the lobby to the room, restaurant, etc., going around, it is very easy to get lost. The hotel's breakfast is average, there are not many types, and the chef's professional level is too poor. When I asked him three questions, I asked him whether the marinade of Hainan pickled noodles was made of beef or pork. He replied that I don't know, and the business level needs to be improved.

msg:I originally wanted to stay at the hotel last year, but this year I took my baby with my friends and experienced it perfectly. In terms of hardware, the room is big enough and spacious, the outdoor environment is really great, and the green plants are abundant. The only shortcoming is that the flowers are a little bit. The oversized lawn extends beyond the slice, the beach is also excellent, and Wuzhizhou Island is directly opposite.
Swimming pool: The swimming pool of each hotel can be the most points, and I give 100 points to the swimming pool of Fairmont. The reason is that children's swimming pool slides and ice buckets are super fun, and the curved shape of the large swimming pool is also super-moving. There is a pool party every day at 5-6 o'clock, experience the a**osphere of dancing in the water, there are various performances, the sky is full of bubbles ü´ß, the a**osphere is full. The most touching thing is that the lifeguard brothers are not exaggerating that there are two or three lifeguards in each swimming pool, or they are super responsible.
Children's activities: My cubs participated in tent construction, tree climbing and adjus**ent, etc. The staff member Lin Hao was very patient with the children. Here is a wave of anger~
Cruise in the hotel, let's focus again on our captain Xiaofu, the child's toy boat fell into the water, and he was very patient and tried to find a way to find the boat for the child, and he will help you take pictures~
Finally, I would like to thank the hotel housekeeper Sherry, a beautiful lady, the proactive service is really comfortable, and the response to any questions is very timely.
Begonia Breeze Bar in the hotel lobby, coconut milk yyds, magic show, sugar man production, clown show, completely overwhelmed ~ room service is also very good, the response is fast, the room is very comfortable, this is what a hotel should look like And service it!
From the first day of my child's stay, I will say several times every day that I will stay here next time, probably this is the best evaluation~

üßπSanitation: The room is very clean, corners, beds and bathrooms are clean. Skin-friendly sleep is also ok.
üçÉEnvironment: The overall garden-like wooden design is simple and elegant, with the only seawater canal in China and the feeling of Venice. Directly opposite the beach is Wuzhizhou Island, which really occupies the C position.
üîîService: When I checked in, the little housekeeper Zhu Tiantian led me on a cruise and introduced the entire hotel service, hotel history, and various facilities. Very responsible, because the hotel is a no-fly zone and specially helped me apply for a drone flight permit. Very touched~ During the day, someone cleaned the room, and the turndown service was also very considerate. When I came back from dinner in the restaurant, I folded the quilt in front of the pillow, and put a Snickers bar, mineral water and a cup on the bed. TV remote control, bed Lay a corner towel on the side floor and put on slippers. Very caring, I have come to Sanya dozens of times, few hotels have night service, the last time I stayed in club med to enjoy it. This is great!
"Venice" dragon boat tour is very good
Maybe because there were not many people when I went there, but because Ctrip's senior members upgraded the room type, I was overall very satisfied. The only dissatisfaction is that a bottle of Sprite in Yuexuan Restaurant sells for 28 yuan. Restaurant service is still good.

It feels like it is raising customers and killing some five-star boss hotels in Haitang Bay at the same price. There are free drinks and coconut jelly when you enter the lobby, which are very delicious. Check-in is very fast. The rooms are surrounded by waterways, and hotel guests can take a gondola boat around the hotel for free, which is particularly beautiful. The hotel is very beautiful, and every shot is a blockbuster. On the whole, it is relatively quiet, unlike some hotels that are noisy. There are also good activities for children, such as clay pottery, golf, free diving in the swimming pool, surfing at the beach, and ocean ball slides, all for free. The parent-child suite I booked is very big, and the room service is also very good. They also help to fold and dry the clothes. The housekeeper also gave a souvenir at the check-out, which is very good. The hotel also sent 5 travel photos. If the photos are good, you can add some money to buy all the photos. Photographer Wang Wei said it was good. The taste of the restaurant is not bad, but the waiter is a little confused, there are one or two flies, this aspect can be improved. Overall very satisfied, I highly recommend this beautiful Venetian-style hotel.

In the past, every time I went to Hainan, I always went to Marriott, Westin and Marriott, so this time I have to innovate~
Wanda is not bad, but Fairmont, I am more impressed and felt more deeply. Next time I go to Sanya, I will stay here again. I like several things:
1. The housekeeper is lucky, the whole process of WeChat is meticulous, interacting and caring in a timely manner no matter morning or evening, and even gave a surprise cake on the first day, the taste is great, responsible housekeeperüëç
2. The parents felt that there was a small problem in the room (ignore the problem here), and the room service dealt with it in a timely manner. The next day, they actually sent a bottle of red wineüç∑ to express their apology, which was very touching. In fact, it is not the red wine itself, but the hotel's service awareness and Attitude~
3. Chris, the customer service, made a return visit to the customer and arranged a souvenir when checking out. The lovely deer flew back to Beijing with me;
4. When we were packing our afternoon tea, there was a girl in the lobby who seemed to be surnamed Li. During the conversation with her parents, she instructed us on how to get a 10% discount on meals in the hotel, so I used it at night üòù;


In a Chinese restaurant, although the menu does not have too many choices, it is responsible to say that none of the dishes will step on the thunder, and all of them are delicious, especially the barbecued pork and Australian beef~

In the hotel's gondola, hotel guests can sit at will. After sitting twice, I took beautiful photos. What is the captain's last name?

All in all, the experience this time is very good, my parents are very happy, next time I come to Sanya, I will come to Fairmont, love it!

msg:Having stayed in so many star-rated hotels in Haitang Bay, Sanya, Fairmont Kaiwei Hotel is the most cost-effective. Whether it is the service or the environment, the overall design and comfort of the hotel make people feel that they are full of praise from the heart!
üîîService: The waiter at the hotel will warmly help carry the luggage, send the luggage to the room, and the hotel steward will lead the way, no need to push the luggage to the room by yourself
üçÉEnvironment: The environment is absolutely first-class, especially the Venice River in the hotel, which is a little more than a kilometer around the hotel, which is especially suitable for taking photos. Here, I will name Master Xu Wenjie, who will take us on the cruise and explain the whole process, and even teach us how to take good pictures. Blow up this amiable master
üßπHygiene: I heard that the hotel opened last year. You don't need to say more about the hygiene and look at the pictures to know how neat, clean and comfortable it is.
üöó Transportation: Star-rated hotels in Haitang Bay generally require a taxi to go out. This is a resort area, which is far from the city, but it is comfortable and quiet.
  Finally, I have to thank the hotel housekeeper Diana, who is very hospitable. She is like a little Baidu in Sanya. She knows everything. I am very grateful to her for taking care of her these days, making her travel feel at home. I would like to talk about staying at the Fairmont Kaiwei Hotel. Later, I deliberately canceled all the hotels at the back of the trip and changed them to Fairmont Kaiwei Hotel. It is really comfortable and makes people feel comfortable. Like this kind of service almost disappeared in Sanya, the first choice to stay at Sanya Haitang Bay Hotel will definitely not be disappointed. Oh dears!

msg:Fairmont is not actually a new hotel, it was Kempinski at first, then Wanda, but when Fairmont took over, it can indeed be described as "new"! From the dilapidated feeling of the landscaping at the beginning, but today's greenery, compact and orderly, we can see the "new" created by Fairmont.

Not to mention the improvement of the external environment, the service is even more closely followed. Whether it is the front desk concierge or the room cleaning, they all show a sense of friendly service.

This can be vividly reflected in the warm message from the waiter Ye Yumiao after meticulously cleaning the room, as well as the warm reception and accompanying check-in by Judy in the lobby and the warm farewell when leaving the hotel.

Of course, the most important thing to stay in a hotel is to stay in hardware, and this one is also remarkable. The interior of the room is exquisite and stable, which is absolutely in line with the five-star positioning. The pool isn't much, but it's big enough, and things like lap skates are free to use. The variety of breakfast is also above the standard, and the quality is acceptable. The museums and river boats add some entertainment.

Okay, so much has been said, but there are also some small places, which are a little regrettable. Although it is a sea view room, due to the overall low height of the building, most of the visible sea is blocked by trees. It is estimated that the top floor can achieve a real sea view.

In any case, this four-day-three-night experience was perfect.

Thank you Manager Zhao Yinglu for his thoughtful arrangement. She arranged the check-in for us in advance. It was because my diving get out of class was late and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it. If there were any problems during the check-in period, I would help us solve them in a timely manner. They were very considerate and the service was very good for us. The experience, before leaving, he came to see us, gave us gifts, helped us pour delicious coconut milk, thank you very much!
In terms of food and drink, I stayed for two nights and two days for breakfast, and experienced the ordinary breakfast in the veranda and the breakfast in the Golden Lounge. There will be many people on the veranda, so go early to avoid queuing. I went directly after watching the sunrise. There are many varieties and good quality. Both Chinese and Western styles are very complete, and the Ming stalls are also very rich. Going early is a good overall experience. The breakfast variety in the Jinzun Lounge is a little less, but it is very delicate. Many of them will be delivered directly to the waiter. Basically, there are all the things you want to eat in the veranda. Even if you go a little late, you still have to wait for a few minutes. Jinzun's afternoon tea is also very rich, there are salty desserts and fried foods, and all kinds of drinks are also rich. There are not many people going early in Happy Hour, and the variety is relatively rich. There is not much time to experience it in a hurry and go to work. The room is in Building 3, and it takes a few minutes to walk to the Jinzun Executive Lounge. The corridor is a little hot.
The hotel has its own beach, which is very beautiful. Haitang Bay is not allowed to go into the sea. Fairmont is facing Wuzhizhou Island. The weather in the east is good and you can watch the sunrise.
The room is not small, but the water for washing hands often splashes out, the water on the ground is a little slippery, some equipment in the room is a little old, and others are fine
There may be no seats in the parking lot at night. The security guards will help you find a place intimately. After checking in, the concierge can help arrange the shuttle bus and the waiter to help with the luggage. The service is also very good.
Guests who stay in the hotel can experience the hotel gondola. The boating staff is very enthusiastic and helped to take a lot of beautiful photos. They will guide us to pose and explain that the murals are Big Fish Begonia and Sanya Lucheng. The service is very good.
The package also included a full meal, which I had no time to eat. I ate it before I left at noon on the last day, and also gave fried rice and desserts. I had to catch the plane before I could finish it. The waiter helped me pack the bag and I took it on the plane to eat. Yes, Xiang fainted the passenger on the side hahaha
The hotel should also have a lot of parent-child activities. I haven't experienced it. I saw a lot of children. It should be good.
I'll come here next time I have a chance~

Facilities: It's good, you can take a boat.

Let‚Äôs focus on the afternoon tea in the lobby. We ordered a set latte + chocolate cake, but we still haven‚Äôt eaten it after waiting for more than 50 minutes, and asked how long it will be many times. Every time, we said that it will be here soon. If we don‚Äôt tell the truth directly, it‚Äôs not good. , Waited for 50 minutes in vain, finally couldn't wait to leave, didn't eat, and there was no free order, bad review!
The overall service is much worse than that of other five-star hotels in Haitang Bay, such as Rosewood and Atlantis Edition, and the waiters rarely fail to provide adequate service!
And we checked out at Fairmont at 12 o'clock, but the reason we couldn't check in at Edison was that Fairmont didn't complete the check-out for us, and then contacted summer to help solve the problem.
Another important point is that we live in Building 6. Many guests searched for a room for an hour like us. It was too difficult to find, and they asked the front desk that a waiter could not take us to the room.
Generally speaking, the overall hardware is still acceptable, but the waiter software is indeed far from up to standard!

msg:A very good experience. I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya, and in comparison, this time is a very good experience. It is especially worth mentioning that the housekeeper has a very strong sense of presence. Thanks to the beautiful diana, who provided a lot of help throughout the process. Also, when we were checking out, we were encountering a peak of crowds, and poppy, a beautiful woman, took the initiative to ask and provide assistance in issuing invoices. In addition, there is the enthusiastic handsome guy Xiaofu who sailed the boat. He introduced the facilities in the hotel along the way and helped to take pictures, and his skills were not bad. Not to mention the beach, Haitang Bay is national-level after all, and the scenery in the hotel is rich, and there are photo check-in spots everywhere. The area that needs to be improved is that the room service telephone connection rate is not high. I have called 3 times, and I have been connected once. At first, I thought the phone was broken, so I pressed the shortcut keys from left to right in a row until the emergency call. connected. Of course, the problem was solved successfully in the end.

msg:[Service] The overall is very good, the restaurant and the front desk feel a little weaker. The guest center, concierge, pier brother, and boa**an are all very good!
[Configuration] I like that the hotel is equipped with a lot of bottled water and a free mini bar. Sanya is too hot, and our family drinks a lot of water every day. But the air conditioning cooling is poor! It's hot to sleep at night! The position of the vanity mirror and the fixed mirror position are really unfriendly! The decoration style is really not like the new decoration in 2021.
[Location] It is indeed a bit far from the sea, and there are indeed some villas for sale in the hotel.
I have stayed in 4 hotels in Haitang Bay. If you book in advance, generally speaking, it has a good price/performance ratio and is suitable for visiting duty-free shops. Remember to reserve a 5% discount for duty-free shops in advance, I just forgot to make an appoin**ent, I feel a loss...

If I stayed on a non-weekend, I received a call from the lady in the guest center in advance. I learned about the number of occupants, and I knew that my baby was not a small child. After that, I took the initiative to upgrade the suite to me; of course, the Ctrip Golden Diamond members also placed the order at that time. Shows that you can upgrade the room type. (In other words, there was no guest center in the Shanghai Peace Hotel before. The young lady called me in advance, both of them are managed by Fairmont)

The canal and the dragon boat are still unique. We must commend our boa**an, Master Yao Junlong!
The concierge elder brother is also very active and enthusiastic, and praises little elder brother Li Jinjiang!

msg:This trip to Sanya stayed at the Fairmont Hotel for 4 nights, a very wise choice. Free upgrade to a parent-child suite, free use of the minibar in the room, and it will be replenished every day after eating, which is really great. The Qingbuliang and passion fruit drinks at the entrance of the lobby are free and very delicious. The hotel comes with a lot of parent-child programs. In the hot weather in June, it is also a good choice to participate in various activities in the hotel. I tried the travel photography given by the hotel, but I didn‚Äôt expect the effect to be amazing. I spent money to buy all the negatives, especially the photographer Wang Wei, who patiently taught the guests to pose under the sun. The shooting angle is very good, no need for P pictures. Thin, Zhang Zhang has the feeling of a blockbuster. In the future, when I come to Sanya, I will choose the Fairmont Hotel, which is very cost-effective.

msg:During the mid-year vacation, I chose Fairmont, which I have been thinking about for a long time, and the overall experience lived up to my expectationsüèù

üçÉEnvironment: The overall resort style of the hotel is strong. Because it just opened last year, the overall hardware facilities are much newer than many old hotels in Haitang Bay; the balcony of the room can see the sea, there is a beautiful lawn in front of the private beach, and you can also take a boat Take a tour of the hotel's canals and you won't get tired of staying in the hotel all day.

üîîService: Guest Relations Jam's service is very attentive. He took us to the room, explained the hotel's related facilities, and greeted our check-in experience intimately. He took the initiative to ask if we needed help, which deserves a big complimentüëçüèª

üßπSanitation: Wang Weiwei, the room attendant, did a good job of cleaning the room. Noting that the weather was hot and our favorite minibar drink, he even added some more for us. The room was also well cleaned.

üßá The only fly in the oin**ent is the hotel's breakfast. One day we went a little later and waited in line at the door for half an hour before being put in. After entering, many of the food was gone, and the dining table was a mess. No one has implemented masks to take meals; this is the first time I have encountered such a situation after staying in so many hotels of the same level. If you have breakfast in the peak season, you should eat breakfast as soon as possible. The reception and management of the restaurant need to be improved üòê

Overall, it is still a very worthwhile hotel, recommend!

The experience ranking can be ranked in the top three of all hotels around the world that I currently stay in, and I can feel it every moment. To the concept of service-oriented hotel staff, every employee will pay attention to details when communicating with you, such as check-in, and after a period of time, you can call your surname immediately, for example, if you don‚Äôt know how to go on the road, the staff will take the initiative When you go back to your room, for example, because you are concerned about the temperature of the swimming pool, jason immediately contacted him to make a phone call after the measurement.

The hotel environment, supporting facilities and recreational facilities are also very abundant, suitable for couples, families, parents and children.

The room is very spacious and comfortable, the balcony is super big! You can take a boat around the hotel for free every day. The scenery is very beautiful and it feels like Venice. The elder brother of the housekeeper at the wharf was very enthusiastic and responsible, and was very careful to help with arrangements. There was also a Li nationality elder brother on the boat, who played national musical instruments. He was very enthusiastic about introducing the Li dialect to the children and teaching them to whistle with leaves.
There are free DIY coconut jelly to refresh and cool down in the lobby every day, and almond slices, pumpkin seeds and cranberries are added at will, and the taste is delicious.
There are rich parent-child activities every day. The children also played golf, surfboards, pulp boards, bubble baths, and made pizza and cakes. They had a lot of fun, and they were all free.

The staff at the hotel were very good. The housekeeper Sharry also took care of and arranged when he left the hotel, and also prepared a wealth of small gifts thoughtfully. He came back satisfied with the May Day holiday, a great experience!

msg:I am a real lazy person. Even if I stay in a hotel and become a Ctrip Diamond member, I hardly write reviews. But not Li this hotel, I am sorry for the conscience - after all, it is easy to be satisfied, but it is rare to exceed expectations. The five-star Haitang Bay is a PK competition. In terms of hardware, Fairmont not only has the romance of garden waterways, but also the Ming and Qing old mansion museums rescued and preserved by developers from Shanghai, but the most worthy of applause is the service. My name is DIANA, I just left a message when booking (praise Fairmont, other hotels seem to have no place to remark) I came to celebrate the 80th birthday of my father, hoping to arrange a better room. She contacted me immediately, and when we got to the hotel, she saw my cheerful eyes, like an honors student who had done a good review, saying, "I'm ready, come and test me! Test me! "Sure enough, not only did he take us back to the room and carefully told us, "The hotel is big, if you can't find the way back to the lobby, just go back to the 2nd floor, and the floor and the floor will be connected." Unexpectedly great suite, also made a careful birthday arrangement. If upgrading and Hesheng are five-star common services, the follow-up one-on-one housekeeper's trivial patience makes me suspect that this little girl who has just come to Sanya for more than a month may have exhausted her ingenuity, strength, and thought to serve us. Introduced the surrounding delicacies, arranged for us to explain the "cultural tour", help in the follow-up room renewal, coconut water in the hot weather, and a small gift of "Luhuitou" when parting... In addition to Diana, cultural The trip explained to us Tingting (forgot her surname) of the museum, the big sun accompanied us for more than an hour, the little brother who rowed (the English name was forgotten by me...), and the enthusiasm when the team was founded in Liu Genghong's aerobics The foreign friends who called us to join (should also be hotel service staff), as well as cleaning and sanitation wrote a small composition to express that I was honored to serve me The waiter who found that I like drinking tea and left more water and found that I did not eat apples and exchanged notes for lotus mist (Pu Shilan and the one on duty in front of her, forgot to take a picture of the previous note), the chefs who met my various requirements during breakfast (which was very rich and changed every day), and countless staff who passed by to say hello... I said there was no door at the door. The coconut milk is gone, and the guys in the lobby are all running to change it... The enthusiasm I met at the Fairmont Center is indeed the first place I have stayed in so many hotels! So not only did we stay here, I also made a bunch of good friends at Amway at the time... The staff management level of this hotel is either the ceiling of the Haitang Bay Hotel, or the extraordinary performance of everyone trying their best to survive during the epidemic play. Whatever it is, it's impressive. My mother said that she went to the Burj Al Arab in Dubai, and the service was also very good, but you would feel that the standardization process is more than enough, and the enthusiasm and humanity are insufficient. Keep it up, Diana! And all the other Fairmont staff, conscientious management companies and developers who are willing to spend a lot of money to preserve cultural relics. Your efforts can be seen not only by us as customers, but also by God! Thank you for creating beautiful scenes and happy memories for others and the world! Finally, a little suggestion. The design of your guest building that needs to be turned around is more obvious. During my stay, I have already pointed the way to other confused guests twice.

The promenade has an important practical function. It is not only used as a decorative structure for a building, but also used to connect or display the most beautiful scenery in the garden. Even in weather that is not suitable for staying outdoors, such as hot sun or heavy rain, the promenade still attracts people to stroll or take a nap. The promenade, with its slender lines, moving rhythm, interweaving light and shadow, and changing scenery, endows the garden with a unified and vivid character. The promenade extending from the main hall hugs the patio garden like an arm; the promenade built along the lake or facing the distant view adopts the method of borrowing scenery to show different scenery through changing frames.

From the beginning of check-in, there was only one lady at the front desk, who was handling other guests, and then suddenly a lady came from behind to handle it for me, and also upgraded the room type. The road from the lobby to the room is difficult to walk. A little brother took the initiative to lead the way and introduced the hotel environment.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank Diana for her butler service throughout the stay. She was very thoughtful and satisfied with the little details of taking care of the children.
First of all, the hotel already has a certain history. Fairmont actually didn't work hard in the room when it took over. It is indeed old, the table is peeling, the door has a large gap and the sound insulation is poor. These flaws will affect the experience and even stay. In the afternoon, my wife and I asked if we should immediately switch to the magnificent or more familiar Grand Hyatt next door. My wife is looking forward to the hotel public area. Diana captured my son with the children's bed rail prepared early in the room and the little giraffe toy and welcome snacks for my son, so I decided to stay for one night.
The next day, I walked around the hotel public area, and it was quite interesting: the moved pavilion, children's swimming pool, paddle surfing teaching, golf teaching, cruise, restaurant and Jinzun afternoon tea are all worth experiencing. I talked to Diana, made an appoin**ent, and everything went smoothly (three days have passed). After this, the room only has the function of sleeping, and the rest of the time is in the public area, so I am more happy.
In general, the price/performance ratio is very high, and the hotel is inevitably old. In addition to this, you can still find happiness in other ways.

Thank you Emily! The wharf staff Yao Junlong and the concierge Roy are all very valuable to the hotel. The talented people have provided the guests with attentive and hospitable service, which is also worthy of praise!

msg:Fairmont, which has been planting grass for a long time, only knew that it was originally produced by Kaiwei Group in 2007. It used to be Kempinski Hotel, and then experienced Wanda Vista. In June last year, it was renovated and upgraded to Fairmont under Accor. Mongolian. Talk about the environment: the greening more than ten years ago, of course, has nothing to say. The trees are lush and add shade to the hotel gardens. Garden, lawn, river, beach, sea. The scenery you want is available here, and it is even better than other homes in Haitang Bay. Speaking of service: there's literally nothing wrong with it. As the flagship store of Accor Group in Greater China, every staff member is very attentive and professional, making people feel particularly comfortable in many small details. This time I took the second old man on a trip. The staff service of this hotel made my parents full of praise, and they talked about coming to this hotel next time! Let‚Äôs talk about food: Although the buffet breakfast variety is not ‚Äútreasure‚Äù, it basically meets all kinds of needs. The point is, the production is remarkable. There is no particular case of stepping on the thunder in terms of taste. But it may be the Dragon Boat Festival, the restaurant is crowded on the first day of the holiday, and the service can't keep up with a little during peak hours. But even during particularly busy times, every waiter is very responsive and responsive. Talk about the room: re-examination of the sea view family room, two floors up and down, each with a double bed. There is nothing wrong with the layout, but it is obvious that the first floor was originally a living room, and a shower room was added to the balcony during the later decoration, which is a little crude and embarrassing. At the same time, the layout of the room has been changed, but each light switch button has not been changed accordingly, resulting in the switch button not matching the logo (it can be seen that it is still an old switch). And, the mattress is a bit soft...it's really soft...I feel that my back hurts when I slept when I was young...not to mention my parents...I hope this can be improved. Toiletries are what I want to complain about. As a flagship store, toiletries (especially toothbrushes) are not even comparable to budget hotels such as Atour. Seems to have lost a bit of Fairmont's identity. Talking about the cultural heritage: What attracted my attention to Fairmont was that it rebuilt Du Yuesheng's mansion from Shanghai to Sanya, and a pair of pavilions from the late Qing Dynasty. But after the real check-in and participating in the cultural tour of the hotel, I realized that the cultural heritage of the hotel is far more than that. The wood-carved frescoes in the hotel lobby and the ceiling of the nine-story tower are worth talking about for half an hour. Instantly, the favorability of the owner Kaiwei Group is unlimited‚ûï1. Talk about travel photography: no comparison, no harm! Two years ago, I came to Sanya no less than ten times, and the travel photographer has also dealt with it several times. Only the photographer brother (name: Zhang Yi) in Fairmont this time, yes! It's just to name and praise üëç professional! Extremely patient! At noon, our family of three felt that the sun was not good enough. He also patiently guided the photo poses one by one. It took nearly 2 hours before and after, and changed five or six scenes, from the hotel lobby to the promenade, yes. Pavilion, and then to the garden, woods, beach... without the slightest impatience. And the production rate is very high! Let his mother, who has always been seldom praised, be full of praise for him! I directly invited him to Guangzhou to help a group of old sisters take cheongsam photos! Haha üòÑ In addition, we must also name and praise the little brother Ther who received us at the front desk of the hotel when we checked in. Help us to solve the problems we encountered, even if it is not his time on duty, he will help us contact the responsible colleagues as soon as possible. What a handsome and warm little brother üíïüíØ. Well, this is the first time I've written such a detailed review. Really feel good ha! Everyone I met on the trip was very nice, and it made my trip with my parents more comfortable and happier. Thanks for meeting!

msg:This time on May 1st, 5/3-5/7, we came to this hotel with twin babies for 5 days and 4 nights. We stayed at the sea view duplex suite hotel. They were very considerate and gave us 2 baby cots and the service here is really good It's so good that I have stayed in too many five-star hotels, big and small. This hotel can make me feel like I like it very much. This kind of service can make us feel that the service is not for work, but from the heart. Excellent service üëç
       Every staff in the hotel from lobby to reception to room service to children's playground staff to swimming pool staff to breakfast staff and we couldn't find a room on the day we checked in and met a foreign man's receptionist who took us to our room And then drove us to the parking lot to pick up the car by the shuttle bus. We forgot to bring our baby's shoes home in the children's park. The staff immediately brought us to our room. We lost our swimming goggles in the swimming pool. The staff helped us find and return them on the same day.
       Because the Wuyi Hotel has a special event for unpacking the blind box this time, the room fee that does not include breakfast is very close to the people, so we bought the breakfast in the public comment, but this breakfast is also fresh in my memory after eating this service. Unprecedented experience of the buffet breakfast is that after ordering, the staff will help you take each plate and deliver it to your seat. You don't need to go to the plate to pour the coffee. Of course, the taste is also very good, and you will continue to change new plates for you
       Before I booked this hotel, I saw a lot of bad reviews from people saying that the hotel service and so on. I thought that was the result. The whole stay experience made me think that the bad service of the hotel was intentional. ...then I won't comment on what people say, I can only say my experience and feelings
       The hotel is beautiful and there is a golf course‚õ≥Ô∏è (free coach)
There are boats, swimming pools, wakeboards, boating and other items. The children's playground is very clean. The little babies are very happy. The cleaning of the hotel rooms is also very friendly. What you need will be given to you immediately I said that I don't need to change the sheets every day. It's too troublesome for you. Auntie is very kind to tell me to change it. You can sleep comfortably. I didn't ask what the auntie's name was but I really liked the auntie. I really wanted to give her a good review. It should be the auntie who cleaned for the first time after we moved in. The auntie here is very attentive although it is a small Things but it's every little thing that makes me feel like you're thinking of us!
      The above comments are entirely from my sincere evaluation. Of course, if the hotel has activities in the future, I still want to stay again if I have a chance. Like like like üëçüëçüëç

msg:Thanks to the Sanya Municipal Government's consumption coupon, let us experience the Fairmont Haitang Bay at 1.5K+-2K/night on weekdays. This is also the pinnacle experience of our Hainan Island tour ‚ú®‚ú®

I didn‚Äôt expect that there is such a careful garden work on the island. Before reading the reviews, I only felt that the Chinese and the Western were a combination. There are rivers like Venice, and there are pavilions and pavilions in classical gardens. The experience after checking in is super good.

The housekeeper Daina is super caring. I didn't expect such a cute young girl to be so professional and thoughtful. She even prepared a small gift for our 10th wedding anniversary! This kind of service is simply beyond the high cold wind of other luxury resort hotels! Really appreciate Diana's serviceüëç
I made an appoin**ent to take pictures, and took pictures in the Wood Art Museum and on the boat. Although the process of taking pictures and choosing pictures is a little bit twisty, it is definitely worth taking the time to leave good memories.
The garden twists and turns to the seaside, and Haitang Bay cannot swim. It is good to listen to the sea and watch the sea quietly!
I have to visit this garden for 2 days. In addition, the skin care products in the hotel are very suitable for me, the fragrance is not too strong, and it is very moisturizing.
This hotel must be my first place in the whole island of Hainan Island, "must stay at the peak of vacation experience"!

msg:The first stop of my honeymoon in Sanya with my wife, the experience of this hotel can be said to be beyond my expectations. Let‚Äôs summarize from the following aspects:
Infrastructure: The hotel is so big that I got lost twice, but call the front desk to get the cable car to pick it up. Things like swimming pools and private beaches are standard. Surrounded by the biggest characteristic river in the whole hotel, there is a feeling of being in Venice. The hotel also provides a free dragon boat surround service, the beautiful scenery is unobstructed, and you can take various photos.
Room facilities: We stayed in the deluxe sea view room, the room is very large, as for the sea view, we may owe a little bit. The decoration style in the guest room is a bit Southeast Asian, and there are luxurious wood carvings everywhere. Although a permanent resident may not be able to adapt to this style, you must come and experience it. The hotel also provides welcome fruit, mini bar and Baisuishan (many bottles) that can't be drunk at all, which is a plus in my heart anyway.
Hotel meals: Breakfast is from 7-11, so there is no need to worry about getting up late and not being able to keep up with breakfast. The buffet breakfast is very good. Before I came here, I read a lot of online sayings that the breakfast was very general. After my own experience, I felt that it was very good. It has everything, and the desserts tasted good too.
Hotel service: Before I came, Diana at the front desk of the hotel also added my WeChat and asked me if there was any special day for my stay, and then specially sent us a honeymoon cake (my wife said that it tasted good from a professional point of view). Then check-in, from you to the front desk to the room, there are staffs to help you carry luggage and guide you. The people who introduced the projects and services inside the hotel are also very professional and have very clear ideas. Diana also gave us a very thoughtful before leaving a small gift.
Overall, although this hotel is not a big fire, it gave me a lot of surprises. It is much better than the 5-star hotel I stayed in later. It is recommended that if you come to Haitang Bay in Sanya, you must experience this unique "Oriental" Venice" Hotel.

msg:I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya and Fairmont is the best hotel. Its garden landscape is very beautiful; the architecture is a combination of Chinese and Western, and it is very harmonious; the hotel is full of wood carving crafts. The writing table in the room where I live is a woodcarving painting of "Huxi Thatched Cottage" by Wen Zhengming, a great genius of the Peng Dynasty, which is extremely fine. Even more peculiar is the carving on the roof of the hotel lobby, which is as exquisite as the dome of the Taihe Hall of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The Yunhe River in the hotel is even more unique. Taking a gondola boat for a week is like being in Venice. Apart from that, what impressed me the most was the service of the hotel. Judy from the Guest Relations Depar**ent was particularly warm and thoughtful. She called a day in advance to inquire when she would arrive at the store and what her needs were. When we learned that our couple was on our 40th wedding anniversary, they not only upgraded the room for us, but also carefully arranged the interior, which made us pleasantly surprised as soon as we entered the room. In addition, she sent regular greetings and gave us nice souvenirs when we left the store. All of this is very touching and we would like to say thank you again to her! Captain Yao and floor cleaner Wu Jinhua at Yunhe Wharf were warm and friendly, and their work attitude was very serious, which left a deep impression on us. Good experiences are always short-lived, and I really regret that I should have stayed at Fairmont for a few more days. It's just that the later itinerary cannot be changed, and it can only be left to come back later.

The experience of less people is still very good, especially after staying at Fairmont, the overall experience has soared from four stars to six stars, hahaha.

The hotel environment, facilities, and guest rooms are nothing to say, and they are first-class. Service is the key to this 6-star experience. We only booked Fairmont temporarily when we arrived in Sanya this time. After confirmation, the exclusive housekeeper Minnie took the initiative to contact me and informed us about the precautions for epidemic prevention. Since the order does not include breakfast, when I mentioned how to buy breakfast, Minnie also took the initiative to give us a double breakfast, which was immediately overwhelming!

It also helped us a lot during our stay. By the way, the welcome fruit sent by the hotel is also very good. The lotus mist is super delicious! In addition to the late check-out at 2:00 on the day of check-out, after learning that our flight was at 9:00 pm, Minnie also specially applied for a late check-out at 4:00 for us, which was really very attentive. Before leaving, she also gave us a little surprise, and my daughter couldn't put it down!

The fly in the oin**ent is that the weather has been raining, but the corresponding weather is also very cool. Overall, this trip to Sanya is great, and Fairmont is great! I hope that in the future when there are more people, this service can still be maintained!

msg:Really great, very satisfied!
1. The hotel is decorated in Chinese style, with various wood carvings and various ornaments. The ceiling in the lobby is magnificent. There is also a small museum of classical furniture, surrounded by canals and boats.
2. When I checked into the hotel, I arranged a housekeeper and colleague Judy. The lady was very nice, provided a lot of information, arranged to deliver fruit, and gave a souvenir when I checked out. The hotel mascot and a sample of Ferragamo are full of luxury.
The price is really good, recommend.

msg:Introduced by a friend, it was the first time I stayed at Fairmont. Our guest relationship, Miss Judy, contacted me before I arrived and asked about my check-in needs. After arriving at the store, Judy immediately came to the parking lot to pick us up. Jacob from the concierge depar**ent also helped with luggage. She was really enthusiastic. On the way to the front desk, Judy explained the hotel culture to us, and she spoke in an orderly and gentle manner. The professionalism is really high. Her explanation also gave me a deeper understanding of the hotel. After checking in, Judy arranged afternoon tea for us, and the afternoon tea tasted super good. Peter, the lounge manager The people are very humorous and the service is very good. After the afternoon tea, Judy also took us to the door of the room. It was really considerate. Because I had to leave the store in the afternoon, I wanted to ask the beautiful Judy to help me take some beautiful photos in the hotel. She also agreed very readily, accompany me. I took a good-looking photo for me on the boat, and also helped me find a good-looking place to take a photo in my hotel. The photo-taking skills are really nothing to say. I have never taken such a good-looking photo in my life. I just want to pack her away. They also gave me a gift when I left the store in the afternoon. The doll is so cute and I like it. I am very happy to receive the gift! Finally, I still want to praise the hotel, the experience of staying is one hundred! The scenery is really good, the service is full marks, and I am especially grateful to every staff member who serves me. I feel like I can spend a day in the hotel without going out. The only pity is the weather. The premise is that Judy is still there hahahahahahahahahaha. ok and above!

msg:Because the review is a bit long, first of all, I would like to thank the housekeeper Judy very much for her care during these three days. She is very professional and attentive. This hotel is what I saw on **. The hotel can be used for cruises and its style is indeed a bit like Venice on the water. It is quite unique. Due to flight cancellation, the check-in time also changed. Through communication, the hotel agreed and upgraded the room. I am also very grateful to Ctrip's customer service for helping with the process. After checking in, I found that the hotel attaches great importance to hotel culture and guest experience. Judy, the housekeeper, took me around the hotel. The hotel's culture and origins were explained in a circle. Every small detail was done very well, and every step of the customer's needs was taken care of. The hotel is located in Haitang Bay, which is not very famous. I have stayed in all the hotels in Haitang Bay two or three times before. I have never found this hotel because it opened recently and is relatively low-key. However, staying in this hotel is very cost-effective. The hotel room is very large. I stayed in a duplex suite. It was very comfortable. The hotel breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening cocktail party were all of good quality. It was very nice. Two of the three days we stayed there were rainy days, which relieved my depressed mood. When I left the hotel, they gave me a small gift and a must-have antigen nucleic acid test kit. Overall, this hotel is very considerate. It is suitable for a family trip or a few friends to stay together, have fun, check in, take pictures, and have all the mid-to-high-end hotel configurations. I will stay with my family next time. Thank you again for Judy's attentive, professional and meticulous service!

msg:The full butler service for two days and one night at the Dragon Boat Hotel is a great value for money!

It was very hot when we checked in at 2 o'clock that day, and the staff hurriedly poured me iced drinks. There is a welcome tea in the lobby, very nice

After checking in, the staff took me to afternoon tea to eat some fruits and cakes üç∞, as well as a small pizza; then we went back to the room to rest for a while. The happy hour started around 5:00, and we started eating and drinking again.

After we were full, we went to experience the cruise. By the way, we made an appoin**ent for the next day's golf teaching. In the evening, we went to Sanya to eat seafood supper and went straight to sleep.

After breakfast the next morning, I went to play golf. After I got tired, I went back to the duty-free shop to buy things after resting for a while. It was already past 1 o'clock when I came back. I just went to have afternoon tea‚òïÔ∏è. After eating, I went back to my room and slept for a while. Because I was too tired, I told Xiaoka (hotel staff) if we could check out late, and Xiaoka gave us a delay. It's 4 o'clock. Before leaving, Sister Xiaoka was waiting for us at the entrance and prepared a souvenir for us very considerately.

Staying at Fairmont made you feel at home the whole time, and look forward to your next trip home.

msg:The 38-line test sleeper who is passive and slack has not worked for a long time, but this time he has to make a manual comment.

The fate with Fairmont began in the Weiya live broadcast room on Double Eleven last year, and it was love at first sight. Due to the epidemic, it was cancelled twice and finally successfully stayed. From the building to the layout, from the lobby to the room to the garden, it is all in the heart.

From the day the reservation was made, the service started. First, I received a confirmation phone call and an epidemic prevention and control reminder, and then a WeChat invitation from the exclusive butler's photo card. On the morning of the check-in day, the card came to care about where I was, and then picked me up in the parking lot, poured me coconut jelly and sent me to the room, with every detail vividly remembered. Fairmont Gold is also a very classic set of services, from breakfast to afternoon tea to cocktail hour, it is worth having. I went to take a classic small cruise, chartered the swimming pool in the afternoon, and the beach where the waves hit the shore. Golf courses that are too late to experience, gyms that have not been reserved for appoin**ents, and spas that have not had the opportunity to try because of the epidemic.

Maybe the five-star hotels in Haitang Bay are the best in the industry in terms of environment and process, and bowing God service is indeed everywhere in the current hotel industry, but during my time here, I feel like I don‚Äôt want to go out, and Xiaoka said that it was too late to go out late, and the family members who had umbrellas in the closet asked. When leaving, Daniel, the little brother in the front office, said that he was welcome to go home, and then kept waving goodbye, and suddenly broke the defense.

There is light here, and this light is the wanted world. Thank you Katrina and Daniel for treating me like family, see you next winter, see you every year.

Before arriving at the hotel, Jerry contacted us in advance. Due to working hours, he entrusted his colleague Dora to receive us. The front desk staff were also very professional, which reflects the high quality of the hotel staff. The whole hotel is indeed the ceiling of Accor. It is a characteristic hotel suitable for vacation.

Then I would like to say that Fairmont's catering is really well done. The food for breakfast, afternoon tea, and cocktail receptions are all carefully prepared, exquisite and delicious, better than Park Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental, and Raffles. These are the best ones I've lived in! You don't have to worry about food when you come to Fairmont
The decoration style of the hotel is more a fusion of Spain and Southeast Asia. It shuttles between the winding rivers, and there is a boat service. It is quite suitable for taking pictures everywhere. Haha
The aroma is British molton brown, which smells good
In the end, Nimo also sent a body care gift box, which is really sweet
All in all, there are too many places to praise for this stay at fairmont, and the cost performance is super high, which completely exceeded expectations!

Special thanks to the housekeeper Yao Binghan, who will call one day in advance and ask if you have any special needs. When the car arrives at the door, a Nepalese waiter will pull the luggage and send it directly to the room. The housekeeper will also hand us the key directly without queuing. The design of the hotel is very special, from the choice of indoor fragrance, to the guest name displayed on the screen in each room, as well as the on-call service, the unique Venice gondola boat tour, the wooden courtyard in the middle and late Qing Dynasty Overall migration display. All reflect the character of this hotel. It's relatively cold these days, and you can't go into the water. There is only one small pool in the whole hotel, which is a hot spring, which is suitable for children to bubble. There is free coconut jelly to eat in the afternoon. In the evening, you can listen to the resident singers in the lobby and have a drink. The bed in the bedroom is big and comfortable, and there is toilet water on the bedside table, which smells of ginger. The breakfast is very rich, a combination of Chinese and Western. There are so many to choose from that a day's brunch is enough. The waves here are relatively large, so it is not suitable for diving. During the day, I take a boat in the hotel and walk on the beach. There are food courts and duty-free shops nearby, 5-10 minutes by car. Before leaving, the little housekeeper also gave a souvenir, with the warmth of home. If you come to Haitang Bay, you must stay here.

First, I had more trust in the Fairmont Hotel when I stayed in other cities before. The small refreshments of the two gold fairmont are delicious.
After arriving, I liked it very much. First, I went through a long corridor to check in in the hotel lobby. On both sides of the corridor are the garden scenery arranged by the hotel, and the hotel also arranged a very cute little girl cici to receive and arrange into the room. It is worth mentioning that , I arrived at the room by taking a boat. The little brother who sailed the boat also introduced us the content of the hotel all the way. When I got on the boat, I felt my whole body relaxed. , the service is very good!
cici kept telling us what time and what time the hotel has content and services throughout the whole process. When he heard that we liked the sea view room, he immediately offered to change the room for us. We don‚Äôt need to bother us to run again for consecutive rooms, just take the room card. come up.
The whole hotel is very big, and the owner attaches great importance to the garden landscape. Although the room is too humid, the outdoor view is very good. I woke up in the morning listening to the birds chirping. There is also a wood art museum. This is my favorite place. Hainan saw that our houses in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have a little contrast, but it is still very interesting to show all kinds of finely crafted story wood art inside. Will consider next time.

The director of guest relations, Xiao Yao, is also very enthusiastic and thoughtful. In short, the experience with my parents is very good. experience

We ordered a two-night stay package, and only used the included Chinese food, Yunhe tour and travel photography, and the others were useless. The breakfast restaurant is very large, with a lot of categories, Chinese food is numb, and Western food is good! We arrived on the 16th in the afternoon, there were many people, and it took a long time to queue for registration. The nut and coconut jelly provided at the door is super! The room attendants are very polite and always take the initiative to say hello to the guests, making people feel at home.

Fairmont is a veritable niche luxury hotel. It has achieved high standards in terms of environmental layout, room style, equipment, and catering quality control. What is more worth mentioning is that the executive lounge manager and lobby manager Wei . They are not only professional, but also friendly.
When the epidemic broke out in Sanya, their service was even more warm-hearted and efficient.
It's hard to come by to keep me in a comfortable vacation state all the time.
Although vacationing in Sanya is a normal part of my life, and I experience different hotels every year, Fairmont likes it from the bottom of my heart and will choose it often.
üöó Transportation: It is more convenient to come by car.

I called the front desk five times and said to get it every time, but every time I didn‚Äôt go, did the hotel staff speak casually and say that they are not responsible? The front desk will never answer the phone calls, because each building is far away, so I went to the front desk to ask three times not to check out and settle, and I still live in the hotel. Do you mean to directly refund the deposit to drive the guests away and not let them continue to live? In the middle of the night, the front desk called and said that because the staff in the afternoon did not hand over to her, he did not know so he settled the bill. I want to say that if you don't hand over your work, then it's useless for our guests to run around? In the end, you didn't finish the sentence? The breakfast was at 10:30. I arrived at 10:15. The waiter told me that the food was about to be closed and I would not be allowed to enter. It was obviously still eating normally inside. I am really disappointed with the service at this hotel. The restaurant meal was very salty. After responding, he said to help me change other dishes. As a result, the waiter brought the original dishes back after they left, which was almost speechless.

The hotel is very spacious
Gardens, swimming pools and beaches are nothing to be picky about
Although many people staying in the room need to queue for breakfast
But the breakfast restaurant is big enough
enough food
compared to price
I feel good already
The only flaw is that the room is a bit shabby
Entering the suite on the 6th floor, there is a big musty smell
It doesn't look like it's been refurbished
Fortunately, there is enough space for two people to live in a suite
Not so much time in the room
So just live
Overall stay experience is ok

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel's architectural design and lobby are still very beautiful, and can be described as tall and elegant.

üçÉEnvironment: I‚Äôm too lazy to complain about the interior design. The new hotel actually feels old. As shown in the picture, the mirror design above the sink is so simple that women can‚Äôt even think about standing firmly while putting on makeup. The mirror is actually on the side, equipped with a small high-power magnifying glass.

üßπHygiene: Why are there so many dark marks and scratches on the toilet as if it has not been wiped clean? Is it expensive to replace a new toilet seat?

üîîService: This is the key point. I originally made a reservation a week in advance, but then the price suddenly dropped twice. Finally the hotel said they would upgrade me.
Prices fluctuate so much during the week, which is not something that professional hotels can do. Do you have no idea about the vacancy rate, or do you want to make a profit?
Finally, the hotel upgraded me to a sea view room. The front desk did not forget to say: You will be given a sea view room with the best view. Full of joy, I had a bad feeling when I saw the room number. There were obviously a lot of sea view rooms with a better view than mine. Is your neighbor deceiving customers at the front desk? ? ? Then the view from the balcony is as shown...
In addition, when consulting in the lobby, the staff's language can be described as unpleasant. But the housekeeping staff are quite polite.

Overall, it is a hotel with a very poor experience. The software, that is, the quality training of employees is not as good as that of a fast hotel! One of the worst high-end hotels I have ever stayed in in Sanya.

msg:There are many luxury hotels in Haitang Bay in Sanya. The reason why I chose Fairmont Kaiwei is that it has been ranked among the world-class luxury hotel brands, and its main feature is guest-oriented and considerate service! I bought a two-night hotel garden-view room discount package on Ctrip two months in advance (including Dragon Boat afternoon tea, free in-room refrigerator cold drinks, etc.). When I checked in, I added 1,300 yuan to upgrade the sea view suite of 100 square meters for two nights, and also upgraded the "Golden Zun" service. Guests who enjoy the service of Jinzun can have breakfast in Jinzun Restaurant (the number of diners is much less than that in the lobby restaurant on the first floor of the hotel). Breakfast includes salted salmon, raw ham, freshly ground coffee and other large restaurants. The special meals can be enjoyed in the outdoor garden. Jin Zun Restaurant also offers afternoon tea from 2:00 to 4:00, and happy hour bar service from 5:00 to 7:00 in the evening. There are a variety of special cocktails for tasting, warmly recommended and carefully arranged by the foreman Chen Yuanyuan of the restaurant Next, our rich family tasted "Bloody Mary" and other specialty cocktails. Fairmont Kaiwei also spent a lot of money to transplant the Du Yuesheng Mansion 100 years ago from Shanghai Beach. In addition, the dragon boat afternoon tea here is also very unique. Sitting in a dragon boat like a boat in the water city of Venice, Italy, enjoying the hotel scenery while having a refreshment, the harvest is not only a good mood, but also a magical time and space... Finally, I want to say that when choosing a hotel, don't follow the crowd, choose the right one, not the expensive one! Choosing Fairmont Kaiwei, which opened only in July this year, at the luxury level of 2,000 yuan per night, the guests get the "golden-class" exalted experience, which definitely exceeds the feeling of staying in Atlantis!

When we booked hotels one day in advance, we found that many hotels were either sold out, or the price doubled. In the end, I chose Haitang Bay Kaiwei Fairmont, and the hotel was full on the day of check-in.
This hotel has changed hands several times and has been remodeled by different owners. Now it has three styles: Venice, ancient China and Southeast Asia. The hotel is very large. There are canals between the buildings. You can ride dragon boats casually. If you have the strength, you can also row by yourself. The hotel and Wuzhizhou Island faces each other across the sea. The quality of the sea water is good, but it is a little far from the beach. There is a big lawn in the middle, but walking can help digestion. If you can‚Äôt walk, there is also a battery car. The hotel is extremely rich in activities. There is a playground for children, books There are also various swimming pools, and parent-child activities are free. üçëHave fun without thinking about it. Adults can visit ancient buildings, play golf, and take travel photos. This time I booked an executive room, which also has administrative trea**ent. Breakfast can be served in the lounge Eat, you can also eat in a big restaurant. The room occupancy rate is very high these days, and the big restaurant has brought out all the dishes. Even so, I saw some people complaining about the breakfast variety that does not change every day in the reviews..., the lounge The breakfast is the selected version of the big restaurant, normal level.
Afternoon tea is the best among the three meals. It has a lot more varieties than Shangri-La and Grand Hyatt. It not only has a variety of sweet and savory dishes, but also sweet soup, and it is self-service. It also provides wine. Compared with Ritz-Carlton, except It's almost sold, but the others win.
Happy hour is a very pure happy hour, but there are only snacks and no hot dishes. It is a bit ungrounded, but there are beautiful cocktails. This restaurant also provides a wine list very thoughtfully, which is convenient for selection. The service in the lounge is very good, and the request is made All can be satisfied. For example, we were too late to eat because of travel photography, so we asked the waiter to stay. They kept the snacks hot and the juice iced to ensure the quality and taste of the food. Because we were catching a plane, we didn‚Äôt have time to enjoy afternoon tea, and the lounge also made up for it. A snack, so that customers don't suffer. Before leaving, I even gave the children a commemorative gift. I feel super happy. I will stay again next time

It was first managed by Kempinski, then by Wanda Culture, and finally came to Fairmont. At present, the management is quite good. After all, the hardware is difficult to change. Starting from the software, the housekeeper Mr. Zhang Saifei and the waiter Ms. Ye Yumiao gave the hotel a lot of points. The check-out time is the most flexible in Haitang Bay. They also helped to upgrade the room type. The service can be said to be my feeling in Haitang Bay. the best. The disadvantage is that the interior of the house is not fashionable enough, far inferior to the appearance of the lobby and garden, and the point is that the breakfast is generally lower, at least a lot worse than Shangri-La. In fact, the biggest highlight of the hotel is the garden. It is the hotel I took the most pictures of. I don‚Äôt know who designed the decoration style first. It is a mix and match. The main style is Venetian style. The gondola cruise will take you around the hotel, followed by the Chinese style. The courtyards, pavilions, and even the small bridges are full of Chinese style, and finally there is the taste of Marrakech. The cacti and the beige walls are made, and the light and shadow in the sunset seem to be in the garden of YSL. Although the overall style is very unconsistent, it is a bit different, but I like it very much. Isn't it good to live in three countries a day? It‚Äôs indeed a net celebrity. The fusion of several elements is the beautiful garden of Haitang Bay in my heart. Of course, it may also be added by the perfect sunset today.

In terms of hotel, it is the most ideal hotel in Sanya that I have stayed in:
The lobby is themed with wood carvings, and there are frozen coconut juice and pineapple juice as drinks at check in, which relieves fatigue from vision and taste~
The hotel is divided by a Venetian-style river, and you can take a gondola boat tour in ‚õµÔ∏è~ suitable for all kinds of photo needs!
The Gold Rewards Lounge 5-7 offers happy hour food and wine, including hotel specials, which is very surprising
Finally, I like the butler, and the response to all kinds of needs is very fast

After checking in, the front desk gave us a detailed introduction to the pattern and history of the hotel. Every time the service in the hotel is very thoughtful, every aspect of the environmental design is very meticulous, and the rich cultural heritage also supports the kind of mood the hotel wants to convey to people. Although the hotel staff deliberately want to earn praise, but this praise is that I really think this hotel is worth the money. A hotel worth visiting once in a lifetime. There will be a chance.

Fairmont is no stranger to me. I have stayed at Fairmont in Beijing and Chengdu many times. After seeing the recommendation recommended by Xiaohongshu, I finally chose Fairmont Kaiwei. The guest relationship is sister Candy. We arranged very well, and the golden service in the hotel is also very good, you can eat from breakfast to dinnerü§©~ The hotel is a little far from the beach, it takes 6.7 minutes to walk from the lobby, there are not many people, the sand is very fine, these two days The waves are quite big, and the children are very happy.

I like the layout very much. The hotel is still very new due to the reopening.

I was going to buy a cake at the hotel to celebrate, but the hotel sent a cake directly after knowing it. Thank you so much! Kids love it so much!

The breakfast is also very exquisite, no matter the service, the environment, and the hygiene are particularly satisfied, highly recommended! We played in Sanya for more than half a month, and basically stayed in hotels in Haitang Bay. Fairmont absolutely killed Atlantis, Mangrove, Wanda Reign, Sheraton and the like.

I just contacted us to remind us that it's due this morning, my husband and I are still eating the cakes and bread I took for breakfast, and I haven't started to get other dishes. I came back in a few minutes. We went to Nanshan Temple to check in for the convenience of praying to Buddha tomorrow. As a result, the hotel informed us that our identity information had not been refunded at Fairmont. We checked out at 2 pm so that we contacted the hotel in the middle of the night and waited for the refund before we could check in to the hotel. Just like nobody. Too bad, won't come back again.

Location: The balcony can see the sea directly, and you can walk to the sea within ten minutes. Standing directly in front of the sea is Wuzhizhou Island. During the stay, it happened to be the scene of the seaside proposal, which was quite romantic and added some fireworks~

Overall is a very pleasant stay experience, a small suggestion is that the room can be equipped with a USB charging port will be more convenient

msg:I like to stay in hotels, especially garden hotels with good greenery. I recently wanted to take my children to Sanya. I saw that ** is a popular hotel with a good environment, so I wanted to try it. After all, I heard that it is the flagship in Greater China. store, I ordered a group purchase on Ctrip, and the price was right. Let me talk about my feelings. When I got there, I walked through the long corridor to the lobby. The lobby was very beautiful, especially the high roof. It was so beautiful. Feng shui was used in the decoration of the entire lobby. The ice cream next to the lobby was delicious. When I checked in at the front desk, I met the check-in staff named Angel. I originally thought that the check-in service would be normal. However, after Angel got to know our two families, he helped us arrange similar rooms. However, we happened to meet the company hotel employee. Yes, the occupancy rate is too high and the room is always full. She tried her best to help us arrange a similar room. Later, she added me on WeChat and always told me to contact her if I need anything. She also actively helped us change rooms. A few days later, a friend came over and helped my friend upgrade to a parent-child suite. Knowing that the child was bitten by mosquitoes, he also helped us find medicine. The service was really more than just words and exceeded my expectations. I went to Sanya and stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Yalong Bay before. The service made me feel great. I didn't expect that the service quality of this newly opened Fairmont is also very high, which makes us very satisfied. Let‚Äôs talk about the rooms. They are large, clean and beautiful. Even the most basic garden view rooms are large and beautiful, especially the large terraces with large lounge chairs. Sanya‚Äôs weather and environment are very suitable for enjoying the scenery from the large terraces. . The twin bed is 1.2 meters, which is indeed a little crowded for bringing children, and the bed is also a little soft. The country advocates having more children. I think the hotel bedding facilities should be greatly improved in the future, which is a strong condition to enhance competitiveness. . The hotel is very big, and there is a canal surrounding the hotel. I was interested before going there, but after doing the boat ride, it became so-so because the water quality is not very good. It would be better if it could be replaced by a swimming pool so that everyone could swim. However, the landscaping is very good, the trees are lush, there are modern restaurants, ancient buildings, and a wooden museum. The museum is a two-entry courtyard, full of good things, and it feels so rich. There is a golf course next to the museum. The hotel is not far from the seaside. You can reach it after passing the swimming pool and walking through a large green grassland. There is a large swimming pool in the center of the hotel. It happened to be a typhoon at the time when I went. It was a bit cold and I couldn't go into the water. It was too Pity. There is a small children's pool and slide next to it, which is a bit smaller. Regarding breakfast, I would like to make a few comments. Compared with hotels of the same level, the hotel's breakfast varieties are a little less varied, and they are not changed every day. The hotel has an executive restaurant. Although there are few people, I think the breakfast varieties are a bit small, so I still go there. The big restaurant has more. I like all kinds of noodles from Hainan. The Baoluo noodles in the big restaurant are so delicious when paired with braised pork and yellow lantern chili sauce. By the way, there is no need to order lunch or dinner in the group-buying hotel. It is not very delicious. Afternoon tea is okay. The key point is that the environment is so good that I don‚Äôt have the intention to eat it. A few people sit there and watch the children play. Having fun is also a kind of enjoyment. I hope we will meet again after the epidemic passes. By then, I hope the breakfast will be richer and Fairmont can give me a bigger surprise.

I booked it for four days after reading some introductions. The day before departure, I received a call from the receptionist of the hotel, asking for information such as the time of entering the store and the habits of staying in the hotel. On the day of check-in, as soon as the car arrived at the hotel, I waited at the door, so I felt like a "VIP". Because my mother stayed two days late and wanted to change to a larger parent-child room, Jerry zhang at the front desk directly helped us upgrade to a family suite for free when going through the formalities. It was a pleasant surprise and gave us a good start to our vacation. Drinks and snacks from the minibar in the room are updated and replenished daily, and the room is also cleaned very well. Clothes racks, band-aids, etc. are all available. I upgraded to a suite, and also provided breakfast, afternoon tea and pre-dinner wine with the room, hahaha... Breakfast until 11 o'clock, sleep late, eat a rich breakfast leisurely, you know the person who is called and greeted in the morning Feel it? Hahaha, "Ms. Zhu, good morning, welcome to breakfast." Wow... The feeling of being respected and valued is respect for a person, not just a guest. Thank you Apple and Xiaoyu for taking care of our family. The afternoon tea from 2:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon is also very rich, because I wake up late and eat breakfast late. After swimming in the hotel and taking a cruise around the boat, I can just have afternoon tea, hahaha. The lunch is also saved, and the whole meal can be eaten in the Chinese restaurant at night. The taste is also very good, and I can eat it every day. This hotel can really enjoy the holiday without leaving the hospital. The hotel has its own beach, you can lie down and listen to the sound of the waves to let your mind go.
I had a great holiday at Fairmont Kev, and I look forward to coming here next time to have fun, relax, eat, drink and play.

The front desk heard that we had a friend who took the initiative to upgrade the room for free, thank you very much. I like the overall feel of the hotel, a different experience! It would be better if the bed was bigger! There are also many special classes for the children, and the children had a great time. Full marks! And don't miss it if you like to take pictures! Fried chicken slices! By the way, I would also like to commend the sister-in-law, the service is very good!

First of all, the hotel butler, Dora, contacted us in advance and asked about our requirements the day before. Booked a room in advance and upgraded to the room closest to the sea. WeChat will briefly ask about room requirements every day. Although I did not see Dora himself, the butler service is very considerate. Hotel facilities are complete, will stay next time. Like Dora too!

The coconut milk in the lobby is super delicious, and the service for the guy who helps to serve the coconut jelly is also good.
Although the type of room I stayed in is a bit strange, it does not affect the accommodation experience. The staff Jerry Zhang is professional and attentive, and very good. This kind of more distinctive hotel is worth staying, and it is more beautiful at night.

The experience of the suite is good, and the permeability is very good. It is recommended to add blackout curtains to ensure the privacy of the guests, otherwise the open-air bathtub will lose its due effect...
The overall environment of the hotel is excellent, with a sense of age and history, high green vegetation coverage, and good comfort. It can be called one step at a time. The facilities for the beach and swimming pool are also very complete, the entertainment items are also rich, and the hardware and software are quite good.
The hotel has a lot of people during the rush hour of breakfast, and the facilities in the room are a bit old in comparison. Students who are picky about this can think twice.

msg:In a newly opened hotel, there is a river in the hotel. Something in the waterway is broken. The original clear water is a bit muddy now. Hearing from the boy who sailed the boat, he is now trying to manage it.

The selected package includes 2 nights room, one afternoon tea, one dinner or lunch, and the price is still very reasonable. Someone will contact you before check-in to ask some needs, and you can directly contact WeChat if you have any questions after check-in, which is very convenient. Bring drinks in the room. The drinks cannot be changed, only the existing ones. Because of the sugar control, it is a bit inhumane that cannot be changed.

The guest relationship daro gave us a real-name like, and helped us coordinate with the lobby bar, customer service center, and front desk. It was really worry-free. Just communicate with her.

The hotel environment is very good, you can take a boat once a day, there are electric and pedals, the pedals are really a bit tired, and I have been overtaken many times, but it is also quite interesting. There is also an old house, which is worth visiting. The welcome drink in the hotel lobby is delicious, I can‚Äôt help but drink it several times

msg:Late praise, to be honest, this is the first time I have written such a long review.

Due to the epidemic, the goal of Sanya once a quarter has not been achieved, but it is still a little excited to be able to usher in the first Sanya New Year's Eve. Generally speaking, when you come to Sanya, you will choose Haitang Bay, so the hotels around Haitang Bay can be said to stay along the coastline. The reason for choosing Fairmont this time is that the distance to Linwang Night Market, Fengqing Street, Duty Free Shops, 68 and 301 hospitals is all close and moderate. It is also said that it is a new hotel (in fact, it is a new one). You can also check in by boat. Got it. I would like to comment specifically and hope to give other children's shoes a reference~

1. Advantages of the hotel:
1. Service: This is the hotel with the best service I have ever seen, even better than Rose Poly. It can be said that this is not only a happy trip but also a lot of friends. A few people should focus on commenting and complimenting.
First of all, Jeffrey is our housekeeper this time. He is very attentive and considerate. He is not too close to you, not too enthusiastic or alienated. He always appears in the right place. In order to decorate the room to welcome us, there are quite a few roses, balloons, and welcome gifts, and we also specially arranged celebration cakes and upgraded the room, knowing the purpose of our trip. Due to the large number of tour groups on the day, I knew that after we arrived, we interrupted our meal time and went to the lobby to settle in alone for us to avoid waiting, and also advanced the time of arrival at 3 o'clock to 12 o'clock. I was so moved to cry~
Secondly, the service staff of Jinzun Lounge must also draw a circle of praise:
(1) Guo Han, the second friend we "made", can see that every service comes from the heart. Seeing that we always happily run over from a long distance to say hello, and tell us the characteristics of the hotel, and even help us to do the relevant operations of nucleic acid step by step, it is very sunny and caring.
(2) Xiaoyu, is the third friend of our "make", loves to laugh very much, and the bartenders are great. When I left the shop the day before, what I said was not a farewell word, but was very happy to tell us that she was there on the day she left and she must come. Let us feel that the contacts these days are like old friends who will definitely come to see you off, very warm.
(3) Emily is the fourth friend we "made". He is very professional and has a very strong affinity. He is also the first to collect our feedback and hope to be a better person with full professionalism.
2. Location: I really have to say that the location is really good. It‚Äôs nothing to say. The distance from duty-free shops, Fengqing Street, 68 is basically less than 15 yuan by taxi in minutes, and Linwang Night Market is almost 20 yuan (not recommended, it is undergoing renovation) A little less smoke and fire). It‚Äôs basically a 30-minute stroll from the Ferris wheel (always forget the name). 30 minutes to 301 Hospital (Beijing Medical Insurance, if you have it, is best to bring your medical insurance card, there is a separate nucleic acid point, the line will be faster.). The taxi fare for Nanhai Guanyin around 150 yuan has also arrived.
3. Hotel hardware: The benevolent sees the benevolent and the wise sees wisdom. The hotel rooms in Haitang Bay are very convoluted (including Kaaba, Poly), but this is particularly convoluted. The next day after I settled in, I slowly remembered how to walk and return. Room. Secondly, the layout of the room is not very flattering. The four-stage style of bathroom-dressing table-sleeping room-balcony makes the overall space more cramped. If possible, it is recommended to add a table and power socket on the balcony, which is convenient for eating hot pot haha. The other thing is that there is a bathtub on the balcony but it is not blocked. The opposite side can definitely be seen transparently. I think it doesn't matter whether there is such a thing or not.
4. Private hotel beach: Yes, and very close. This is better than Sunshine 1 Hotel (after all, it does not), and better than Poly (too far and nothing).
2. Disadvantages of the hotel:
1. It is impossible to check in by boat. One is on the 2nd floor and the other is on the 1st floor. It is almost the same to take a trip back to the room after dinner every day (about 10 minutes/circle).
2. The facilities should be Chinese retro, at least I didn't like it too much.
3. Poke the key point. This is very important. There are too many groups. I lived there for a week and went through the N group. From the meeting to the group building, there was a lot of singing, noisy voices, 7788 drunks, mezzo sopranos, and sopranos one after another. . .

msg:First, the facilities are outdated and the parking space is seriously insufficient! ! ! The cars were all parked on the grass, in a mess, parked in the lobby, and kept urging them to leave quickly. I haven't put my luggage yet, so you're in a hurry.

Second, the density of hotel rooms is outrageous, and there is no luxury that a five-star hotel should have. There are a lot of people at the front desk.

Third, the service is very poor. I made a service call at 10 o'clock in the evening, but no one answered, and the concierge phone was not answered. It rang until I hung up automatically. I was also drunk.

In addition to the big gimmicks and high fees, there seems to be nothing outstanding. The five-star cottages in third-tier cities are just like this, and I will never go there again.

msg:This is my first time to experience Fairmont Hotel. I read online comments and said that there is an internet celebrity butler named Jerry, who moved the guests with his service. Unexpectedly, it happened to be Jerry who would receive us. Jerry was already waiting for me at the entrance of the lobby when I arrived. He opened the car door with great enthusiasm and took me into the lobby. There were many people who checked in in the lobby lined up. When I thought I was going to line up, Jerry told me that all the formalities had been done for me. All I had to do was to sign and pay a deposit to go back to the room. At that time, I was really moved by his carefulness, and what he said on the Internet is true.
The environment of the hotel is also very awkward, but it's a bit too forgiving, and it's really easy to get lost when I just arrived. But it's good to be familiar.
Knowing that I was here for my honeymoon with my girlfriend, I made a honeymoon decoration and gave a honeymoon cake. As Jerry wrote to our greeting cards, we had a wonderful and unforgettable time. See you next time, Fairmont! üòâ

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel is a hotel with an inland sea. You can take a free dragon boat ride in the hotel. The lobby bar of the hotel faces Wuzhizhou Island directly. The swimming pool and beach are all private in the hotel, which is quiet and private at the same time!

With VIVI's ability and way of dealing with people, in inland cities, it must be a role model for other hotel managers to learn from. , Like hotel staff like VIVIüëç

It can be said that this trip is worthwhile! The hotel park is a reconstruction of a mansion, with a large area and a three-dimensional structure. It is like a two-dimensional independent world. The solid wood carved dome and huge murals and beams combine ancient and modern styles.
There are many covered bridge structures inside. From the height of the covered bridge, you can see the coconuts full of dangdang. The frangipani also has two colors. The red frangipani is the first time I see it. Along the garden, there is a long and long Yun River that runs through all the main buildings, and each tower stands on the river. Guting Qushui, Bluestone Road
. You can take a small dragon boat or step on a pedal boat to explore along the river.
Although Haitang Bay cannot go to the sea, it is also very pleasant to bask in the sun on the beach of the hotel. There is a huge grassland on the way to the beach. The beach wedding was being arranged on the day I went, and everything looked just right.
The afternoon tea snacks at ps Golden Restaurant are super delicious. They stood out among the hotels on this trip. The young lady in the restaurant is sweeter than chocolate.
Mrs. Yuri at the front desk was super nice, she enthusiastically provided us with a lot of help and gave me a small gift. In short, it was a very pleasant experience!

The biggest feature is that you can take a boat tour of the entire hotel, only the residents can, the privacy is very strong, and the experience is good. In addition, I saw that there were not many breakfasts, but the overall experience was good. There is room for improvement in other restaurants in the hotel.

Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Fairmont

Later, the manager moved us to a suite and we barely stayed in it. We checked out the next day and the deposit was not refunded. We went to another hotel because Their hotel's identity information was not returned to us in time, which prevented us from checking in at another hotel. We came here to travel, not to cause trouble.

But in fact, the environment is beautiful as soon as I arrive at the hotel. It‚Äôs the kind of Chinese a**osphere. There are many buildings built in mahogany. The hotel is very big. There are many scenes that are very good to shoot. The boats are actually very distinctive, but they do have a taste of history, but I personally like this style quite a bit. of. Service is a plus point. First of all, the room type is upgraded for free. There will be a staff member who will accompany luggage to the room. Breakfast is 6:30-10:30, simple but exquisite. You have to make two or three times a day, and the turndown will also be arranged. The butler‚Äôs WeChat keeps communicating 24 hours a day. I personally attach great importance to the service of the hotel, so I really recommend it!

Accor‚Äôs intentions, but the only place to complain is the seafood buffet in the evening. It can be compared with Langham‚Äôs breakfast. It is not the worst but worse. The price is the price of Fairmont, and the food is estimated to be the requirement of Ibis. The dinner buffet at Pullman Oceanview staying in the next two days is great.

msg:I fell in love with Fairmont the first time I came to live. The hotel is very big and the rooms are very comfortable. The balcony looks out to the sea. Lying on the big sofa bed on the balcony and taking a nap listening to the sound of the waves, life is really free. The beach is clean and the sea is superb. Let's talk about service, two young ladies must be praised. @Vivi @‰ΩïÁîúÁîú. Vivi contacted us before we set off to help us arrange, pay attention to us every day when we arrive at the store, and deliver it in person when we leave the store. Help us arrange travel shooting, duty-free shops, nucleic acid testing, and meticulous. He Tiantian is at welcome drink, mixing drinks and desserts for us, introducing the hotel, a very cute little angel. In fact, the young lady in the gym is also great, but she didn't see her name clearly. We went down, and she called me (my last name) Miss the second time she saw me, very kind. The younger brother who visits inland rivers also has a good attitude. Would like to stay in a hotel for a few more days.

msg:Originally I only planned to stay for one night and go to Yalong Bay, because I think the hotel is good and I renewed the reservation for another night. Before I booked, the price was the same with breakfast included, because the first night was booked at the top recommendation point of the hotel Breakfast is included in the package, and normally this top position includes breakfast. The next day, the package is also booked at the top. I thought it included breakfast, and I paid a deposit at the front desk. The front desk did not say that it did not include it, but the next day I got up early and went to the restaurant and was told that the room does not include breakfast. My first reaction was that it was impossible, because the front desk said that our room did not include breakfast the day before, but it was actually booked, thinking that the same situation would happen again When we checked on our mobile phone, the waiter was completely rude and polite to tell us to step aside. At that time, the people behind us had already left and did not block anyone. Her attitude was as if we were coming for breakfast. Yes, I found it on my mobile phone for a long time without breakfast. It is simply inexplicable. It is clear that the price is the same without breakfast. The price of the room was doubled on the National Day. The top recommendation of the hotel turned out to be the package without breakfast. It‚Äôs easy to miss the second booking like me if you don‚Äôt read it carefully, and the attitude of the waiter makes me feel upset all morning! Secondly, the food trays of the hotel and the tables by the pool are not visible to the naked eye. There are also many constructions around the hotel, which are far from the beach.

msg:Won't stay here again, I was polite when I was out, and didn't give a bad review, but I was really dissatisfied, and I didn't vomit!
I came to Sanya during the second half of the National Day holiday and chose to book Fairmont. To put it bluntly, there are two points in the picture: cheap price (1300-1400/night including double breakfast) and good service (seeing reviews are boasting). However, stepped on a big thunder.
üîîService: I was completely said in the evaluation that after booking, a consultant will contact you 3 days in advance, and the butler will contact you 1 day in advance. The 24h service during the stay is attracted.
üà≤Ô∏è The result is: 1) no one contacted me on the day of check-in; 2) no one helped us with our luggage after staying in the hotel; 3) the so-called welcome fruit, which did not come at 19:00 on the day of check-in. It was delivered in 1 hour; 4) During the stay, no one introduced us to the hotel‚Äôs internal facilities and ways of playing. It‚Äôs really hard to think about boating checkin!
üÜò However, when entering and leaving the hotel from 10/5 to 10/7, including after checking out on 10/7, I did see that many customers will have dedicated staff to take a tour around, at least from getting off to the lobby Some distance, introduce the internal facilities and the overall hotel. And we don‚Äôt have it. To be honest, this thing is that you don‚Äôt have to worry about being scarce but you don‚Äôt have to suffer from unevenness. If you don‚Äôt have any of them, I won‚Äôt have much to say. However, if someone else has it, I don‚Äôt have it. That is indeed unacceptable.
Some people may say that the other party is a suite/member, but if a hotel that sells service is not even able to do this, it would be a bit too much.
In short, I won‚Äôt come again. I can‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs black, but at this price, Haitang Bay still has a lot of choices. This one is really average, and the Internet celebrities are not qualified, but there is a problem.

msg:Very good check-in experience. 100 points. The hotel is relatively new. It just opened in July just because of some Venetian style. I didn‚Äôt expect so many value-added entertainment activities, especially the largest 18-hole golf driving range in Haitang Bay. It is so suitable for me as a novice. Practice your hands! I heard from the staff that there is a surfing experience diving teaching in the afternoon. These are free. You can also arrange sailing and surfing in Houhai Village. It is really suitable for outdoor enthusiasts. There are also many entertainment areas for children. This time I also caught up with a couple. Have a romantic candlelight dinner on the beach. I envy the ******e butler Mia. The service is also very good. A few brothers at the dock also praised it. Thank you for playing football with us under the big sun and taking a cruise. The hotel is also very comfortable. I recommend it! Must come

msg:Superb, last time I went to Sanya to stay at Marriott, it was also a standard super nice hotel. This time I stayed at Fairmont and had a brand new experience. The entire building complex of the hotel combines modern European style and traditional Chinese cultural elements. Stepping into the hotel area suddenly makes people think of "Detective Paul" + "Jurassic World"üòÅ. There is actually a wooden art museum here, which is really a place of treasure. The old mansion houses a lot of wooden products from Ming, Qing and the Republic of China. Of course, as a resort hotel, various entertainment projects are also very rich, such as boating mini golf ‚õ≥Ô∏è, etc. Wait. Needless to say, the beauty of the beach. Ms. ViVi, the housekeeper, is also very attentive and the service is very good. Various inquiries will be answered quickly, and she also helped to make an appoin**ent for golf. And JackLee, who accompanied him to play golf, is also very nice. He will explain the terrain for each hole.
On the whole, this hotel is really a good choice for people like me who do not visit scenic spots and are purely relaxing.

msg:I stayed in a hotel in Yalong Bay for four days before, and I feel that there is a certain gap in both facilities and services.
Advantages: The boat ride on the river should be the selling point of the hotel. After taking a dragon boat ride, the little brother Li Bujian, who is in charge of the helm, introduced the situation of the hotel very enthusiastically, thank you very much.
Although there are many people for breakfast, the young lady who is in charge of registration coordinated the seating of the guests very well, and the order is very orderly.
The covered bridge here provides coconut milk and homemade drinks to the guests waiting in the lobby, which is good.
Disadvantages: Said that the housekeeper will contact, and there is no sign until the check-out;
I made a late check-out at the previous hotel, and there was still no room until 1:30. Well, many people on the National Day were considerate of each other, but no one told me when it was better. I kept running back and forth to ask, which was really exhausting;
The room setting is a bit old, unlike the newly opened one. The curtains are still hand-drawn, and there is no bathtub (seeing that there is a place reserved, it may not have time to install it...) There is no coffee. Unless your room has a capsule coffee machine, you will not even give instant coffee.
The beach is far away and you can't swim.

Every guest can enjoy the cruise and golf of the hotel for free. There was a little accident during the house, but in the end Manager Polo handled it very well and gave me a big thumbs up üëç! The service is very milky. During the National Day, there is a seaside barbecue that is delicious, and the singing is good~ The a**osphere is invincible, and I can play in the hotel for a whole day without going out. I was worried that the hotel is relatively old, and it is not completely past. I didn‚Äôt feel this way, the room feels very new and comfortable to live in. I also presented a daily mini bar and a fruit plate, and finally I met a marriage proposal at the hotel‚Äôs private beach. It‚Äôs too romantic ‚ù§Ô∏è (Really a hotel worth staying in)

msg:Just in time for the November holiday trip, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because there are a little more people staying or the hotel‚Äôs original service can‚Äôt keep up. First, there is welcome fruit when I check in, but I didn‚Äôt get to the room, so I called I asked the front desk. It took an hour or two to deliver it. It didn't mean that I cared about the few fruits. They weren't worth the money. The main reason was the consciousness of the hotel. Second, the musty smell was very strong when I entered the room. I brought an air purifier and put it at the door without bringing it in. After I brought it in, it was still broken, and it was changed to a good one later. Third, when I checked in, the TV could not be turned on for no reason. I estimated that it took more than half an hour to call the front desk before someone came over. I called in the middle of the call. In short, the service speed was only one word, slow. Fourth, the bed sheets in the hotel should be dirty. The next day I slept, I was covered with all my bags. I didn‚Äôt hear the reaction from the hotel. Fifth, I called the concierge before checking out and asked the concierge to come over and pick up my luggage. The good guy really waited for me for more than 40 minutes. I called again and said that I didn‚Äôt know, and I didn‚Äôt register to pick us up and carry our luggage. Sixth, the butler should be an intern. He doesn't talk to him about anything. This is because the hotel hasn't trained the staff well, so I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Is it okay not to be employed without training? In summary, if you change hotels decisively, you will definitely not stay at Fairmont next time. There is a lot of room to choose from for more than two thousand nights. There is no need to find it

Let me talk about my intuitive feelings about this hotel. I didn't expect this hotel to be highly rated at the beginning. So, I went. But I am really disappointed. The main reason is that it is too noisy. And there is no view from this room.

I checked in more than 3 o'clock in the middle of the night. But around 7 o'clock in the morning, the corridors are full of children's noise. Scream loudly. It's the kind that can scare me up directly. From 7 o'clock until 11 o'clock, almost stopped. Then the waiter knocked on the door to clean the room. I checked in after 3 o'clock. Fall asleep more than 4 o'clock. I slept for three hours. Really spend money to find sin. Pit.

3‚É£Ô∏èMany surprises and courtesiesüëç. We stayed in the Jinzun Garden View Queen Room. After checking in, the front desk will print out all the benefits of your package to you. The courtesy included in the package is really too rich!
It is really recommended for couples, parents and children.

msg:Since it is a hotel that has changed hands several times, there are indeed some flaws in the hardware design that cannot be changed. For example, there is no door between the bathroom and the bedroom, the washbasin is too shallow, and the splashing water will flow down.
But Fairmont wins service. There are not many new waiters, but they are still very meticulous. Knowing that we live in a family of 4 and it is the wedding anniversary of our parents, the butler Vivi specially upgraded us to a family suite. An extra adult breakfast was added. The room is large and the bedding is comfortable. There are always unexpected surprises during our stay. For example, we will give a big cake. For example, we are taking pictures by the sea. Suddenly the concierge drove a car and said that we were afraid of hearing from colleagues. We went too far back and came to pick us up specially. These two points just touched me a lot.
The hotel is more of a cultural addition. I like Guangxu's pavilion, Du Yuesheng Wooden Corridor, and Shanghai Shikumen very much. There are cruise ships and a full Venetian style.
Special thanks also to Vivi, who asks me what I need and what arrangements every day, so that I have a feeling of being taken care of. Would recommend friends to come again, very good.

The personal butler, Vivi, is very nice. He not only upgraded the room, but also gave an administrative courtesy. Soon after he moved in, he took the initiative to arrange a small tent and the children had a great time. When I left, I found the items in the room in time and delivered them back for me. It is particularly worth mentioning that the swimming pool is very large and clean. Our family of three spends a lot of time in the hotel almost every day. The only shortcoming is that Fairmont is a hotel before the renovation, so the layout of the room is still a bit old, especially the washbasin is not spacious enough and it is too shallow to splash water easily. In addition, it can only be on the balcony, without curtains. Kind of üòÖ Overall, the hotel‚Äôs service is really good, but the food standard needs to be improved.

msg:I decided to come to Sanya temporarily. After I booked the hotel, I didn‚Äôt care about it. I ordered an ordinary garden-view room. I was looking forward to seeing recommendations on the Internet. I didn‚Äôt expect that the real surprise started after I arrived here. The beauty vivi contacted me and asked me if I had room requirements. I told her that we had an anniversary. Vivi was really super attentive. As soon as I landed, I contacted me and waited for me in the hotel lobby, helped us to do a quick check-in, and then it was free Upgraded the sea view room and chose the best one. The room has a 90-degree view. The room is also decorated with roses. Even the TV in the room is marked with my name, and a variety of snacks are also presented as a souvenir. I didn't even take pictures of the cake on the day. . . It‚Äôs a pity that I gave the Jinzun Lounge a self-service. It‚Äôs not too cool. Really vivi‚Äôs caring service is what you think. I stayed here for two days. I went to the beach to play and sat by the patrol master. The car, haha, the master is also super enthusiastic and has been introducing me to the beach and told me not to be barefoot. The room attendant and the handwritten note are ubiquitous. Anyway, this price is really super five-star service. I don‚Äôt know why I am so lucky. Although the business is not good in the off-season, the staff is not discounted at all. I recommend everyone to enjoy life.

For this trip, I would like to thank the hotel‚Äôs guest relations depar**ent dora, who took the initiative to call to understand the situation and children‚Äôs needs before check-in, and adjust and upgrade the room type. During my stay at the hotel and the thoughtful service follow-up during the whole process, I fully felt the butler service concept of star-rated hotels, as well as the girls and boys in the hotel lobby, Chinese and Western restaurants, all of them were polite, courteous, kind, and advanced in service consciousness. Make guests extremely comfortable.
    But this stay also found that the hotel also has shortcomings, that is, the hotel service response time, from the feedback of the problem to the arrival of the special staff, it often takes about 15-20 minutes, which is the fatal shortcoming of the star hotel service.

The afternoon tea is very, very good. Although there are not many things, they are delicious. Don't miss it. There is also a lady (forgot to ask the name, the man‚Äôs name is also forgotten to remember the name of the man) is very meticulous, and my guest service specialist, froya, will arrange in advance such as pick-up and luggage transportation. There are also services such as appoin**ents. In short, it was a very satisfying journey. If there are more restaurant choices in the future, such as seafood buffet, hot pot, etc., then I can stay in the hotel forever.

msg:I went to Fairmont, because I was staying here when I went to the Maldives. The lobby goes around the hillside, and when you cross the bridge, you will see the Chinese style lobby. This is also a Venetian hotel. You can take an electric boat or stop directly at the building number you live in. You can also trample on the boat yourself (this is a bit laborious, please choose carefully)
We booked a family suite. After we arrived, we found that there was a hardware problem. We coordinated with the manager and changed to a family suite with a swimming pool. At present, the hotel has been in operation for nearly 2 months, and the hardware is a problem left over from the previous Mandarin Hotel or earlier, and it is hoped that it can be improved in the new building.
Sand and leaves in the small swimming pool need to be cleaned up more diligently. Because there are too many trees, and it just happens to be rainy.
In terms of service, nothing to say, super! This brand has always been maintained. The manager Vivi‚Äôs coordination of the room type, the butler‚Äôs Gro‚Äôs considerate service, Emma‚Äôs help from my reservation to nearby play, the pool management Mr. Lin and the children‚Äôs interaction and care to provide toilet water, the concierge depar**ent picks up several brothers at any time, and Arefin warmly welcomes them.
This hotel‚Äôs beach is a bit far away... and it‚Äôs not suitable for going to the sea, but you can play on the beach with your children and go on the waves.
The hotel‚Äôs large swimming pool ranges from shallow to deep. There is a surf lesson in the morning, and there is a bubble fight in the children‚Äôs pool next to the afternoon. Provide warm bath towels and mineral water. Our child loves to swim twice a day...Mr. Lin who went to the swimming pool knew her~
Hotel breakfast, there are Chinese and Western food. However, compared to the Ritz-Carlton breakfast, there are fewer choices. Every time I finish ordering the omelette, I forget to take it. When I think about it, I will go and take it. The younger brother in charge has already prepared the plate for me and waited for me to take it~ The noodle soup line is a bit time-consuming. Time is up, I hope there are other ways to order noodle soup.
The parking lot has ground and underground. We stay on the ground all the time we live. It's okay to have a big tree block one block.
The hotel used to be very close to Haitang 68 Square and Duty Free.

Spa has a discount package, you can see it on the mini program
The Chinese restaurant also has discounted set menus. We ordered 4 servings and the food was all well done.

There is also a battery car brother who takes us to the nearest elevator every time. And our housekeeper, Yang Axin, assists us in arranging related matters every day, and also proactively apply for a 5% discount card for duty-free shops for us.

msg:As the most high-end brand of Accor at present, he came here to experience his service, but he was disappointed. At the beginning, when booking with Ctrip, I deliberately chose the Diamond Privilege. I asked the hotel on the phone and was told that it was not applicable in Asia. After giving feedback to Ctrip's customer service, Ctrip contacted the hotel and made compensation. The result of this process was satisfactory. However, the welcome fruit hotel selected by Ctrip did not provide it at all. After consulting the front desk by telephone, I was told to deliver it later, but at check out Still haven't eaten it. This kind of service is not as good as some express hotels, and it is really not worthy of the Fairmont brand. The hotel is very large, but many restaurants in the hotel are closed. It is really not easy to find food in Haitang Bay. If you say a good hotel, you can only stay in the room... I have to say that the hardware of the hotel is indeed very good. Very good, and in Haitang Bay, it's easy to make big movies. If you just want to take pictures, you can choose this one, but if you want to experience the service, you should change the brand. I really can‚Äôt praise it. I originally booked two nights and I chose to check out the next day. It was a more fantastic experience.

msg:The evaluation of this hotel on the Internet is very good, and I also saw the evaluation and came here with expectations.
I booked the itinerary for three days and two nights. The royal gardens and the quiet and high-quality service attracted me, but after I came to the hotel, I had many different experiences. It is like a story, accompanied by me for two days.
I really like the promenade leading to Datang when I got off the car, especially the promenade like the island of Maldives. This design allows people to have a wide view, and there is a good connection from the parking lot to the Datang, to feel the whole hotel Cultural a**osphere. Especially the black brother in the parking lot, very enthusiastic and courteous service is in place. When checking in, the hotel staff was very polite and enthusiastic. I did not upgrade the room. At the same time, the hotel manager also applied for the executive lounge for me, especially thanks to their manager, Mr. Li, who had a lot with him on the same day. The place I contacted, I hope I can have a good mood in this environment and enjoy my vacation time. When I returned to the room, the room was full of moldy smell, which is the place I can't stand the most, and the decoration of the whole room also looked heavy. The double bed room I originally ordered was now replaced with two double beds. It was inconvenient, so I contacted the front desk. The idea at the time was that if I look at other rooms, if they all smelled like this, I would check out and stay in other hotels. After I communicated with the front desk, the front desk arranged for their service staff to be changed to the opposite room by me. I didn't expect it to smell like this when the door was opened. I said, forget it. After a while, their manager personally took three room cards and took me room by room to see this kind of service. I was particularly moved. Finally, we chose a tasteless one to stay. It was already past nine o'clock at dinner, almost all the staff were off work, the kitchen of the Chinese restaurant was far away from the restaurant, and the service staff were also very hard. They served us. Although there was some unpleasantness in the middle, the manager of the restaurant , The manager of the hotel is very attentive to deal with it. Every staff member will greet you earnestly, warmly and sincerely. This feeling is very pleasant. She feels like home, and she cares about the feelings of each customer and cares about each other from the bottom of her heart. There are many recreational facilities. You can paddle a pedal boat on the water, take a dragon boat, and play water sports. I recommend this hotel for people who like quietness and garden style. Come here for a few more days to slowly experience the different artistic conceptions that the hotel brings to people. It is like a magnet, when in the first place. On the second day, I was slowly attracted. I seemed to feel a little reluctant. When the children were playing in the swimming pool, their hair was very wet. When they were going to eat in the restaurant, the young male manager of the catering depar**ent hurriedly distinguished the rooms. Go find a hair dryer for us, let the children dry their hair, and then come in to avoid catching a cold. The children‚Äôs amusement park in the hotel is very good, especially the library area on the second floor. The quiet facilities are clean and beautiful. It is suitable for children and parents to play for a long time. The breakfast has a special feature, and the gentleman who sells pineapple buns on his 28 bicycle attentively, Uncle Clown, who has been making balloons for children seriously, is very nice and sincere. When you are walking on the road, every employee will stop and greet you sincerely. When we check out, I found us The staff in the room where the children paint brushes and the manager on duty have been helping us to find them. Our courier is sent to the hotel, and the staff also arranges a special club to deliver it to the room. Swimming circle until we arrived at the next hotel, we found that we called the hotel manager, Manager Li Lihong, specially arranged for the staff to take a taxi to me to this hotel. Every hotel will not be 100% satisfied with every customer, at least this hotel is very attentive and doing things. They want to serve every customer well.

Generally speaking, the facilities are average, and the location of the hotel is too biased. Haitang Bay is still inconvenient, but this beach is too ordinary.
Except for the above points, the service is very good. The hotel butler will call to confirm the arrival time before check-in, arrange welcome fruits, and deliver breakfast. Every service staff is very enthusiastic and attentive, and even noticed my uncomfortable walking when I injured my foot. The hotel has arranged two kinds of slippers and umbrellas for guests to go to the beach. The breakfast was good and rich, but it was a pity that during the two days I went there was heavy rain and I couldn't have fun. Fortunately, there was a big bathtub on the balcony to soak in. Special thanks to Maggie at the front desk for helping us drag our luggage all the way to the room and telling us where to play and where is the restaurant along the way

After checking in, they will have afternoon tea at the lobby bar. In addition to the guzheng, there are live band performances. Great place for afternoon time. The biggest surprise this time was the cultural tour recommended by the little brother at the front desk. It was the first time I heard the "Dongyang woodcarving craftsmanship" and got to know the precious and rare woods such as red sandalwood, rosewood, and nanmu, which was considered an extra harvest during the journey. In addition, if you want to take a cruise, you must be before 6 o'clock, we almost missed it. I want to recommend their spa here, and I feel so comfortable that I don't want to leave at all (Physical therapist Xiao Zheng, I have nothing to say about the service and massage techniques).

msg:The newly opened hotel, the service environment is very good, but the decoration hardware is not good. The socket could not be plugged in, the panel of the air conditioner fell off, the sealing ***** of the shower room fell off and the water filled Jinshan. Because the hotel lobby has a very luxurious wooden carved ceiling, no air conditioning, no fan, it is extremely stuffy, and the poor front desk staff can still be so dedicated, seeing that they can only use a small fan and wear a mask. In addition, compared with the surrounding Westin, Intercontinental, the mangrove forest is very small. A 1.5-kilometer canal was built for maintenance costs. The characteristic is that it is not practical. In addition, there is no shade in the swimming pool, and almost no one swims in the sun. Probably it was a trial run. For lunch and dinner, only a Chinese restaurant or lobby bar can be selected. The service staff are also relatively new and I have to look for a manager for many problems, and after staying for three nights, I only did a standard turn-down on the third day. As a graduate of hotel management 20 years ago, I feel that hotel staff training is not in place. I would like to pay special commendation to the western chefs who are meticulous in their daily breakfast patrol and strict requirements on the temperature and temperature of the products. Therefore, the breakfast buffet is the top of the surrounding hotels or five-star hotels in Sanya. I believe it will be good if I have lunch and dinner. The bartenders in the lobby bar are also very dedicated. They can ask for feedback on each wine and they can also drink the wines that are not on the bartender list. Cocktails are also very cost-effective in the surrounding five-star hotels, so we endured the previous sultry party and patronized it three times. The front desk manager Sally is also very good, and will follow up immediately if there is any problem, so even in the stuffy lobby, the service attitude of the front desk staff is much better than that of Westin last year. I hope that the newly opened No. 1, 3, and 5 buildings can be better equipped or the competitiveness of W next door will decrease. In addition, the swimming pool can consider moving some trees or building some sheds to improve the shading effect

1. The hotel lobby uses a lot of carved wood, very Chinese style.
2. Some sanitary fixtures are old and have not been replaced. This is a bit speechless
3. The breakfast is quite generous, with German pork knuckle, Hainanese noodles, and the waiter pushing the 28-bar bicycle to deliver pineapple buns and zongzi.
4. Borrowing the swimming ring is currently free, and the pools are clean
5. The time of the dragon boat ride is 10:00-18:00
6. A few hundred meters behind the hotel is the beach, the greenery and sand are also quite good
7. The service is very considerate, children's slippers and toiletries are all equipped. The molton brown is produced in Guangzhou, and it doesn't even count as subpackage.
8. Living in Building 6 is a long way from the lobby. The advantage is that it is very close to the swimming pool beach and the wellness depar**ent.

There is no air conditioning or ventilation. The only satisfactory hotel service is still good. The final result is no Recommend, I'm sorry for the price of supporting facilities, there are many choices at this price, Ctrip is really depraved, not to mention the opening of breakfast, this kind of hotel is also marked to open in 2021, ha ha.

The swimming pool experience is great. The little handsome guy who drives the dragon boat is very dedicated. The room attendant gave an unexpected surprise. The children also received delicious birthday cakes by accident. There is a large lawn by the sea, which is very beautiful. The slight inconvenience is that the shallow basin in the bathroom is easy to spill water and is not equipped with an automatic toilet, but the experience of staying is definitely not inferior to any five-star hotel in Haitang Bay. Three days are too short, so you must stay a few more days next time.

Don't live if you are afraid of tiredness and heat. Service I was even more speechless. In the early morning of the renewal day, I remembered that there was a courier that I had forgotten to take, and it was too far to get to the lobby, so I called the concierge to help me deliver it, and the concierge said that I could not find it. After waiting for half an hour, I called and told me that I didn't find it, and then said that I found it. In fact, I was too lazy to send it. On the last day, I started knocking on the door to clean the room at 8 o‚Äôclock in the morning. I woke me up, saying that I didn‚Äôt need to knock on the door after 10 o‚Äôclock and I swiped the room card directly. Fortunately, I locked the door. This situation is really bad. Met once.

At present, the hotel is in a soft opening state, so the executive lounge has not yet opened and a small fruit plate is provided as a supplement. It takes 5 minutes to walk from the room to the beach.
The distance from the lobby to the room is a bit far, and it is an outdoor corridor and stairs. If you bring the elderly, you may want to consider a battery car.
The rooms continue to inherit the Chinese style. The layout is reasonable. The sea view room can squint Wuzhizhou Island.
The canal and dragon boat should be the biggest highlight of the hotel. I hope that after the official operation, the dragon boat can send guests to the building where the room is located.
The swimming pool series are complemented by ancient buildings in the late Qing Dynasty and Shikumen.
The breakfast is rich and distinctive. The noodle stall and bakery are very attentive.

msg:The hotel is managed by Fairmont, and it feels bigger. The canal experience is good, you can take a dragon boat. The hotel is very large, the beach is beautiful, the pool experience is also good, and the breakfast is rich. Newly opened, the hotel staff are enthusiastic and actively confirm room information with guests in advance and actively help late check-out. The hotel is in Haitang Bay, next to Poly. It is very convenient to take a taxi, and it only takes more than 10 minutes to go to the duty-free shop.

During our stay, we showed perfect all-round service, received and cared for us very considerately, upgraded our room for us, and worked out a dinner suitable for us. We will solve problems as soon as we encounter problems, and the service attitude is very good. I give the hotel a very good score. I am very fortunate to stay in the perfect hotel for a perfect vacation. Thank you to all the staff of the hotel and Xiaocheng for your company throughout the journey, adding joy and comfort to the tired journey. I will stay in Sanya next time!

msg:For me, the hotel does not have a pillow suitable for us, and the experience of being a star hotel is not so good! There was a big complaint about this stay, that is, it takes 10 minutes to walk from the hotel lobby to my room. A friend of mine who is traveling with me is still bringing a baby alone. When we waited for the room, because we were staying in a suite, we had to climb two flights of stairs to get to ourselves. The bedroom is very convenient, really bad experience! Finally, I forgot to charge my room fee because of a hotel operation error. After I checked it out, I actually transferred and paid. I ignored it afterwards. The answer was also very official. The attitude was a 180-degree turn from the lack of money. The management Too many questions!

Even before we checked in, the housekeeper Dora called to answer various questions. . The child accidentally got allergies. Dora also arranged for the car to be taken to the hospital for free at night and then picked up again. I am really grateful. . Even if the room card is lost, it's okay to re-apply. The children's water park is a bit small. . The swimming pool is quite big. The seafood buffet in the hotel in the afternoon is of good quality. The seafood is very fresh. Overall, the service is really good.

msg:Overall, I was very disappointed. I originally booked for 4 nights, but cancelled after staying for one day. Now I am worried about temporary hotel reservations.
The first is that the service is poor and the front desk attitude is very good, but like the robot, it will only repeat your question or repeat his last sentence. When we checked out, it was enough to give him the room card, and then when we arrived at the new hotel, we were told that the ID card had not been signed off, which delayed a lot of time. Later, a staff member called me and said that I had to pay a few tens of dollars, and finally I used Alipay to transfer it to him, and I don‚Äôt know if I was cheated.
The second is that the hardware does not work either. The parent-child suite we ordered, unexpectedly, only have a wooden floor in the middle and a rock slab around it, which is totally unsuitable for babies to crawl or barefoot. There is no bathtub, and bathing the baby is done in the sink. The toilet and bedroom are also not soundproofed, so I am afraid that my baby will be noisy when I go to the toilet at night. The overall decoration is not up to the five-star standard, and the scenery outside the window is a half-repaired building. The elevator cannot go directly to the first floor to the beach because the first floor has not been repaired, and I don't know if there is a formaldehyde problem, so you need to go to the lobby from the second floor first, and then go to the beach on the next floor, which is very winding. There are no lights on the back road to the beach, and there are no deck chairs and umbrellas on the beach. Very unfriendly.
But there are also better points. First, the appearance is pretty good, relatively new, and European style. Second, the breakfast is very rich, and it should be higher than the average in the five-star category, although I don't like the type of noodles.

msg:This is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. You should not travel in a five-star resort hotel. If you are used to staying in other luxury resort hotels in Sanya, this place will not meet your expectations at all. Objective evaluation, Xiaohongshu It is completely different from the Venice-like hotel promoted by Ctrip. First, it is not newly renovated but acquired the old Mandarin Hotel and changed its name. Second, the catering category in the morning is pitiful compared to first-tier brands. Third, the biggest problem is the check-in front desk. The room type I was given went up and down. After complaining later, I changed to a larger room, but the nigh**are started. I didn't sleep all night. The air conditioner was old and there was a hanging Gree air conditioner. It was too noisy. The temperature display was very bright. There were lipstick marks on the bedding. There are also hairs and nose allergies because the last room is not often occupied. The decoration is very old and the bathroom is dirty. The welcome fruit is very poor, and the blueberries are sour. Because of this experience, I decisively asked to check out the next day, and the hotel also deducted the remaining balance. After a few days of depositing 30%, complaining to Ctrip and sending evidence photos, the hotel manager apologized and agreed to check out, and sent a car to the Edition. He apologized later, and finally contacted me to say that the Edition was over for the holiday. After that, you could take me to the airport, but I declined politely. My advice to the hotel is to promote the hotel objectively and spend enough money to renovate it after the acquisition. You can only accommodate people who don‚Äôt often go on vacation and have rich experience in resort hotels. People say you are wasting our vacation time. To sum up, don‚Äôt look at the recommendations from Xiaohongshu‚Äôs marketing account.

The soundproofing is particularly poor, and the voices of people passing by at the door can be heard clearly, dragging a suitcase is like thundering. . . There is also a problem with the floor drain in the bathroom, so I soak my feet in the water and take a shower. The cabinet behind the bedside door had rough edges and cut my husband's hand. . . After the aunt cleaned, there were still cake residues on the ground. Living in Building 6, the room is particularly difficult to find. Going back on the first night was the same as encountering a ghost hitting a wall. After searching for half an hour, I couldn't find the room. . . It looks exactly the same as the four buildings, without a conspicuous sign. . . The hardware really makes people complain. The house price is not worth two thousand yuan. . .
