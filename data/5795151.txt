We really liked the hotel itself, it's so clean, with great bed and nice view. The only thing was a bit old bathtub

msg:Excellently located next to Chengdu East Railway station, by the East Square, the Longemont is a beautiful place to stay and brings a cleverly designed European flavour to the otherwise local Chinese culture on this side of town. Rooms are decorated in a simple but ornate style, and features such as the glass divide and sliding doorway in the bathroom, give a homely, stylish vibe to the place. All accessories and provisions are top quality here. The Skyline Bar on the 42nd floor gives an amazing view out over the city and the chef serves a full menu right up to midnight. There was also a great variety of food to choose from at breakfast, though if you tend to prefer coffee over tea, I would definitely recommend the lounge cafe on the ground floor, for the most carefully prepared espresso I’ve tasted this side of Europe! There is a very convenient, securely managed luggage store in the front lobby, which is perfect for an early check-out if you want to explore and come back later to catch an evening train. Staff are warm, friendly and approachable. I appreciated the ease with which they would respond to any request without allowing intrusion. This has been another wonderful stay on my adventures, I will be back again next time I visit Chengdu.

msg:Very much a “Chinese luxury” hotel, in that it looks nice but is actually very meh. AC barely worked despite it being in the high 20s C. Room service menu times were wrong, so twice I was denied my order despite the menu showing that room service was available. Bed was ok. Bath tub was nice and big, I’ll give them that. Maid service was hit-or-miss, as I didn’t want them to come before noon while I was still in my room, so I had the DND light on, but when I left at 12:30pm and came back at 2am they had not replaced my wet towels as they had the day before with the same scenario.

I ordered starbucks and the man at the front desk ran to get it from the concierge for me. Everyone there went the extra mile to make sure my stay was great.

The hotel staff are enthusiastic and will take the initiative to ask and introduce the hotel when you enter the door. It turns out that this is a hotel cluster with four hotels, and Longzhimeng is the best. After entering the room, the facilities inside are indeed good. In the evening, I also went to the beer house on the 42nd floor that the hotel staff specifically mentioned and took a walk around. I had a drink here, which should be very comfortable! I didn't taste it because I had something to do that day. I must try it next time I have the chance.

msg:The transportation is convenient and it is close to the railway station. Since I only stayed for one day and had to take the high-speed train to Xi'an the next day, I chose a hotel close to the railway station. The hotel can only be said to be average, and the price-performance ratio is not high. I traveled out for 10 days and stayed in several 4- and 5-star hotels. This is the only one that did not have welcome fruit (the ones sent may not be delicious, but they are an attitude). In this era of competitive hotels, everyone is competing on service. Maybe the hotel has a very advantageous geographical location and it is not bad to find customers, so there is no need to improve the service quality!

They were afraid that they would not be able to get there in the morning, so they booked a hotel near the East Station for them. It was very convenient. You can take the elevator from the hotel lobby to the underground passage of the hotel and go directly to the East Station without having to walk to the ground. I originally just wanted to deal with one night and make it convenient for early travel the next morning, but I didn't expect the hotel to exceed expectations. 1. It is very large, a standard 5-star hotel, and can even be called luxurious. The room is also very large. Many people can be seen checking in in the room on the platform. For this price, it can be said to be great value for money. 2. The service is very good. The two elderly people reported that the hotel staff is very enthusiastic. The next day, they saw the elderly with children and luggage, and took the initiative to help carry the box to the elevator leading to the East Station. 3. The whole family ate very well in the hotel's breakfast restaurant early in the morning. If you don't have time to eat breakfast at home. Booking this hotel is a very satisfactory and smart decision. Not only did you enjoy a day in this good hotel, but the parents and children were very happy, and it also saved time for the early morning of the next day, reducing travel expenses. The whole family praised it.

msg:The second floor of the hotel is connected to the exit of the East Station. It is very convenient. If you need to enter the station, you only need to cross the street. It takes about five minutes. As soon as I entered the door, a staff member greeted me and asked me carefully which hotel I had booked. At the hotel, the staff explained that this is a cluster of hotels, so they were afraid of going to the wrong place. They were very considerate and helped with luggage, probably because this is a station. They also reminded them to be careful about telecommunications fraud. The staff checked in very quickly and the room It's big and comfortable. I'm very satisfied with my stay this time. I will come back again when I come to Chengdu in the future.

The front desk staff were very friendly and professional, and the handsome guys and girls at the front desk were also very enthusiastic. They patiently and carefully explained where breakfast was and how much it cost to add breakfast alone, which made me feel at home. The bed in the room was very comfortable and I had a good sleep. Moreover, the hotel is strategically located, very close to the East Railway Station, and the transportation is very convenient. There are subway, high-speed rail, bus and passenger stations, and shopping and dining are very convenient. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to any visitor to the city, parking is free during your stay.

You can see the hotel building after leaving the train station. The room price in the five-star hotel is pretty good, and the room environment is also OK. Since I arrived at night and haven't eaten yet, I asked the front desk clerk and said that there is a Chinese restaurant on the second floor and a beer house and restaurant on the 42nd floor. Finally, we went to the restaurant bar on the 42nd floor, wanting to go upstairs to overlook the night view of Chengdu.

It was literally across the road from the East Railway Station entrance to the square entrance. There were also bathhouses and gyms, but I didn’t. I went, I was too tired from playing, so I went to the beer drinking place on the 42nd floor of the hotel to see the night view. The buffet breakfast was quite rich and varied (didn’t take a photo hahaha). Anyway, the environment was okay. I ate the roaster, saw the panda butt, and checked in at Chunxi Road. I’ll come to Chengdu again next time😋

The most convenient thing is that the hotel is very close to the East Station, and the underground passage in the station can directly reach the second floor of the hotel. This is really convenient in winter and when the weather is bad. It's a 10-minute walk to the high-speed rail station. We chose to stay here because of the convenience of taking the high-speed rail the next day.

Let me tell you my opinion. Since the hotel has such a good advantage, the route directions from the East Station to the hotel should be clearly written on the page. I called the hotel to ask for the directions because there are no road signs at the station exit. If you don't ask, you won't know which way to go.

In addition, the toiletries only have shampoo and shower gel, which are a bit basic. It feels like the bath towels should be replaced as they are gray.

msg:This hotel is amazing! It is especially suitable for family travel, and it is very close to Chengdu East Railway Station, so the transportation is super convenient. There are also many gourmet shops across the street downstairs, where you can try all kinds of delicious food. It is also very convenient to go to Leshan and Sanxingdui from the hotel, and you can choose to travel by train. And it’s only seven subway stops away from Chunxi Road, which is really convenient! The room was very clean and well-stocked. The waiter was very attentive and notified us of giving him a toothbrush. He asked if there was anything else he wanted. He also reminded him of good night when he left. It felt like going home.

No one delivered the takeaway upstairs, and the hotels I stayed in had robot deliveries even for 310 nights. I don't know how this kind of service is so embarrassing to mark myself as five diamonds.

We took an elevator three times, but the room card could not be swiped. The front desk reset it and swiped it again, but it still didn't work. Finally, after struggling for a long time to enter the room, the battery suddenly ran out. It was really like seeing a ghost. I called the front desk. They also asked the engineer to come and take a look. We were almost exhausted from going back and forth with our baby, so we finally changed rooms, and then the room became extremely hot! ! ! The child sweated and had rashes all over his face in the room! The air conditioner cannot cool the air. No matter how you adjust it, the air blown out is hot. The front desk said that you can adjust it yourself and ignored us at all. We checked out of the room without having breakfast the next day! During this period, no one answered the phone many times at the front desk! Even the phone in the room we stayed in didn't work! Not to mention children’s slippers and toiletries, it’s impossible to provide them! You have to go downstairs to get the takeaway you ordered! The room smelled of newly renovated paint, which was quite unpleasant!
To sum it up, it’s a rubbish hotel where dogs don’t even stay!

The staff was very indifferent and had the attitude that saying anything more would be a waste of life. The central air conditioner in the room cannot adjust the temperature. It is baking at 27 degrees. The windows cannot be opened and there is not even a crack in the door. The shower room is barely adequate and the sewer doesn't work at all. Even a so-called five-star hotel does not have a minibar, but a small refrigerator is clearly reserved. Real review! This hotel really loses points for Chengdu.

I said they said you can get the lunch box at your side. Why didn't you give me one just now? , I already said it was too late to have breakfast, but she actually said that I thought you could just hold it with your hands, so I didn’t give it to you. She was very angry after hearing this! , is this the service quality of your hotel? Do you pack the food for guests and take it directly with your hands? Is there no packaging box? Although I was given a takeout box in the end, I felt that the service attitude of the hotel restaurant staff was very poor, so I gave it a negative review!

Another waiter asked me to go to another counter to check in. When I entered the room, I was promised a non-smoking room, but the whole place smelled of cigarette smoke! The air-conditioning switches at night were all the same. It was so hot that it was estimated to be 39 degrees, and it was completely airtight. Isn’t Dragon Dream five-star? Did it happen like this? ? ? Go bankrupt soon

First of all, the air conditioner was not cold enough, because the windows were small, and the air conditioner was not strong enough. It felt stuffy and breathless. , I originally wanted to stay a few more nights, but I checked out the next day. I really had no choice but to be bored. The breakfast in such a big hotel is so-so. Also, why are the cups placed in the bottom drawer? Bend down to get it, this is the first time I have seen this in a hotel, the hotel is almost completely enclosed, the air conditioner needs to be strong, otherwise it will be really stuffy

The table for towels is made of glass, and there is a layer of dust inside. This can't be blamed on the waiter for not cleaning it well, because there was also a layer of dust on my laptop the next day. The central air conditioner is too dusty.

The breakfast is also terrible. People of all kinds are fighting for food and seats. The waiters are busy cleaning the tables. They have worked very hard and I can't bear to blame them. At the same price, I stayed in a much better place in Chunxi Road the next day.

剛走進來感覺大堂很氣派
辦理入住時工作人員也很細心，態度非常好，還有人幫忙拿行李
房間很乾凈整潔，也寬敞明亮，是我喜歡的風格
性價比很高，值得一次又一次的推薦和入住！下一次來的首選！

msg:很有性價比的酒店，就在東站旁邊，交通很便利，坐高鐵過馬路走幾步就能進站，絕對是卡點星人的福利。再一個房間給人感覺也挺舒服的，比較大，由於辦理入住比較晚了，前台給安排到高樓層房間，視野真的很不錯，雖然就在東站旁邊，但是也很安靜的，比較值得一住。

人員是真的很雜，電梯口有low到不行的年輕人居然在直播？？？全季亞朵也不可能這樣吧，酒店收錢為付費的顧客提供一個合理的環境，這是應該的吧？

真的是太差了，裝修舊了可以接受。但是你收了錢就得提供該有的服務，這是合情合理的。

居然28度的成都不開空調説給的自然風自然風打開全都是在吹熱風一個晚上每個小時都會被熱醒。

真的不知道運營團隊是用什麼腦殼來想的？節約成本，也不是這樣搞啊。打電話給前台當然也是沒用的，前台也衹能説今天天氣不熱，所以開的是自然風。前台當然也沒有去跟能力説把整棟樓的中央空調打開。

1. 早餐選擇比起其他我入住的酒店相對來說不太多，而且不太吸引。

2. 房間設置上可考慮作出一些改善，例如在電掣面加USB充電插。

3. 房間內有些玻璃鏡應需要更換。

辦入住時候前台  舒紅丹 的小姐姐是不是有點憨憨的，這樣的人不該在前台
前面有人在甲櫃枱辦入住，我到她面前（乙櫃枱）先問她這個櫃枱可以辦理嗎，她態度愛理不理的回覆在忙
於是我就回到甲櫃枱排隊嘍，結果她忙好了可以辦入住時候叫排我身後的一位女士先辦，而不是先問詢我的意見，真是憨得可以
其他服務人員都很和善，客房打掃都主動打招呼，所以服務僅扣兩星
酒店晚上挺吵的，要十點後才安靜，因為火車站廣場上有廣場舞，基本要九點多才結束
至少我住那晚是這樣的，我住15樓的，不知道為啥門窗關好了還是聲音傳進來，反正要早睡的不推薦住這裏

前台服務人員態度太差，還不是一個，前台幾個服務人員都是這樣，那這就是酒店管理的問題，一個個黑着臉，全程沒有微笑，看都不看顧客一眼，真不知道怎麼培訓的，走南闖北住了那麼多酒店就沒見過這樣的，簡直無語。
