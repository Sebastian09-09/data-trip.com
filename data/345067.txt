msg:My family and i had a great time in sheraton haitang Resort & we stayed in the family suite with Seaview facing for 2 nights. The children love the sea theme bed room so much.  
 There are alot of activities that keep the young children occupied and stay in resort throughout the stay.  

Last but not least, i like to compliment Iris for her exceptional service & hospitality.  She take great care of our needs during the stay.   

highly reccomend to anyone who wish to have a fuss free holiday with families.

Before check-in, she called me to confirm special requestments, and, while we were staying,  requests of my family are well accepted. Especially, when temperature of the room was not easily controllable, Nico confirmed an other room to move as fast as she could. I really appreciate her.

3박 하는 동안 Nico 라는 분이 전반적인 사항들을 잘 챙겨주셔서 잘 지냈습니다. 특히, 체크인 했을때, 방의 온도 조절이 잘 안 되었는데, 옮길 수 있는 방을 빨리 알아봐 주셨습니다.

Overall,
All breakfast and Barbecue in Sheraton were so good. 
There are a lot of restaurants near Sheraton.
Pools were so much fun for children.

msg:Of course it was our own mistake that we booked a hotel in Haitan Bay where it is not allowed to swim. But, as compensation, the hotel has a large number of pools and a large well-maintained area, which slightly reduced our grief. The hotel itself is not new, but in good condition, the rooms are spacious and well equipped. And most importantly: the hotel has amazing staff, everyone is very friendly and helpful - the impression is that you were expected here. Special thanks to Nicole, who is not only competent in all matters, but also surprisingly benevolent and caring (including Wechat support!!!)! Breakfast is the same each day, but in general everything is there.

Room service menu has limited items and takes far too long. Elevators take very long to get to the floor. Staff was friendly and kind and some had very good English skills. Our vea from the hotel was good. We didn’t know we weren’t allowed to swim in the beach until we did our research. We didn’t see that mentioned in the hotel description so that should be added. However if the tide permits you can get into the ocean just not to far in which ch was ok with our group. Overall it’s a good stay just not sure it’s completely worth the price.

msg:The hotel has a great pool and a private beach. Swimming isn't allowed because of the tide in Haitang bay. The hotel room is clean and big. I booked a seaview room but you can barely see the ocean. I'd suggest just booking a normal room,it's cheaper. My view was the pool and palm trees, which was still nice. 

I was dissapointed overall. This hotel isn't really up to par with similar well known hotels under the Marriott Bonvoy umbrella . The Sheraton is outdated. I've stayed at far better hotels that and I'd suggest booking other places. I was also dissapointed as I was made to wait 2hrs before I could enter my room after check-in. Even then my room was still being cleaned as I entered after the wait. They started cleaning after I had complained about the wait. They did apologise with a plate of fruits (which are usually complementary). The room was unfortunately non-refundable so I couldn't cancel. 

Breakfast here is good though.

Would I suggest this hotel?  Not really.

We expected more from the pools (knowing that there is no swimming at Haitang beach allowed). There are also plenty of security cameras installed at the beachfront. It destroys the picturesque view. As well as the Motorcross guys passing with the squads every 3 min. In general the Hotel Has a remote location, no activities / restaurants nearby. So we had mixed feelings during our stay. But we just focused on strolling around, relaxing and having extensional breakfasts. To sum it up: you can expect a bit more from a 5 star Sheraton hotel. Space to improve left.

Only problems were that you cannot order food or drink to the poolside areas and a major issue but not the hotels fault is that you are NOT allowed to swim in the sea. This is a government regulation for the whole of Haitang Bay, funnily enough not mentioned by any of the hotels until you get to their beach areas. Very good location Atlantis Aquaventure waterpark is only a 15 minute walk and 10 minutes walk in the other direction there is an arena shopping and eating plaza.

The entrance sounds quite loud with party music ( i wish the lobby  had more peaceful and relaxing music to welcome guests instead of loud party music coming from two different sides.)The check in took longer like an hour wait but it was made up by  a free drink and the upgrade of room by kind front desk Manager David who upgraded my room to superior deluxe sea view room for whole four days.  The room was fantastic and spacious. The breakfast buffet has alot of variety although it was a peak season  so the breakfast time was always packed and bustling but waiters quickly try to find the spot for you. The dinner buffet is great too which was in the garden and the live band played. Alot of  water activities for kids. Loved the pool area . They had 11 pools mostly children friendly but i wish they can separate atleast one  pool just for adults so people can swim without any interruptions and in a quite place.. if it serves beers or cocktils that would be great as well😊. The beach was clean but had no  beach chairs due to some Gov safety policy and swimming isnt allowed on the beach. Another plus they have the passengers cars to take you around the place and see attractions also provide shuttle bus service to the airport. Gym is decent and spacious enough although they can add more variety of machines for back n legs. Overall loved the lush gardens pools,  room, friendly guest service, food and the gym. I would totally recommend this resort and will visit again.

msg:An old resort hotel, a few minutes' drive from the duty-free city. Very suitable for taking photos and checking in, and it is also very photogenic. You can stay in the hotel for two days without feeling bored. Many trees should be of a certain age, which adds a sense of story. The price is reasonable in the off-season, and the service is more meticulous, which has a different charm and avoids the discomfort of crowds. The housekeeper ANNA followed up very well, and all arrangements were considerate and appropriate from before check-in to the stay. I saw that there are also rooms with private swimming pools, and parents can choose this room type for family travel.

msg:The room is too far from the lobby, which is a bit uncomfortable for people like me who don't like sports. . .
The room is pretty good overall, the air conditioner is a little loud, there are no towels in the bathroom, and I have to go to the bathroom to wipe my hands every time.
The sea view of the sea view room is actually average, and the main view of the balcony is still the garden. If you want to see the sea, you have to tilt a little. Unfortunately, the weather these two days is average.
The beach and swimming pool of the hotel are good, and they are also very close. The scenery is good, and the garden is also very beautiful.
The butler service is great. He took the initiative to delay check-out and helped solve many problems. If it weren't for the butler to give extra points, I would have given three points. It feels more suitable for parent-child travel. I see that there are a lot of things for children to play in the park, which has limited appeal to me who travel alone.
The airport bus is very convenient and can arrive in less than an hour. There are airport pick-ups and drop-offs.
The breakfast tastes good and there are many varieties. I heard from the butler that you need to queue up if you go late, but I don't have this problem because I get up early.
I didn't make an appointment for the travel photo shoot. I made an appointment for the next morning in the afternoon, but they said they didn't have a schedule. I was very disappointed. I don't know why it's so tense in the off-season. I was looking forward to it. . .
Overall, this trip was OK, with good and bad things. Maybe my expectations were too high, so there was some disappointment.

The hotel prepared free sand digging tools on the beach, which is very convenient. You can just put them back in the tool basket after use. Rose is still replying to WeChat questions after get off work, which is very dedicated.
The coconut lawn facing the sea is beautiful on a sunny day and is suitable for taking pictures. The sand in Haitang Bay is fine and comfortable to walk on the waves.

The housekeeper Long Guanheng Damon contacted me early, and he provided one-on-one service. If you have any questions, you can ask him to solve them. In the middle, he also helped us upgrade to a superior sea view family room for free. The housekeeper was warm and friendly, and helped us move our luggage and change rooms. Both the garden view room and the sea view room on the high floor at the back have their own characteristics. The garden view room is quiet, you can see beautiful coconut trees, and the balcony is super large. The sea view room has good sunshine and faces the sea directly, and the clothes dry quickly. Staying for two days has different experiences, which is great! The hotel's children's playground, swimming pool, and beach are all good, and the children like it! Thank you for the help provided by the housekeeper Long Guanheng Damon, it was a great experience.

If there was no improvement, they could help me change the room. When I came back in the evening, I found it was still the same. I informed the front desk and got a reply saying that there were no rooms available that day! They had to change my room the next day... The musty smell and humidity were really uncomfortable. The air conditioner was as low as 18 degrees and there was no improvement. At the end of that night, I went to a friend's hotel and spent the night. I got a new room when I came back at noon. The new room had no problems with the previous one. The attitude at the front desk was quite friendly, but it was really ridiculous.

Because I booked a pool suite on the ground floor, the quality of the guests upstairs was also poor, and they threw all the cigarette butts downstairs after smoking.

msg:Xiaohongshu described this hotel very badly, but I didn't think it was that bad when I arrived. There were people to help open and close the car door when getting on and off the car at the hotel; there was indeed no air conditioning in the hotel lobby, probably because of the design style, which needs to be improved, after all, it is very hot in summer; the hotel room is very large, the partitions are reasonable, although a bit old, but well maintained, the bedding is clean and hygienic, especially when entering the room, the air conditioner is turned on in advance, the hotel room has a bit of moldy smell, people with sensitive smells should be careful; the hotel is very large, there are several swimming pools of different sizes downstairs, and there are also towel services available around; the hotel is very close to the beach and shares a public area with Marriott; the hotel is very close to Atlantis and the duty-free shop, and it is very convenient to take a taxi nearby.

The account manager Lesley Li was very nice and considerate. She provided us with excellent service, solved our problems and ensured that we had a pleasant stay.
The hotel facilities were first-class, the staff was friendly and enthusiastic, the scenery was beautiful, and my family and I were very satisfied with this trip.
I would recommend this hotel to my friends and look forward to staying there again next time.
I also thank Lesley Li for the free room upgrade, exquisite fruit and VIP rest coupons

msg:Checked in around 1pm, but waited for more than half an hour for the room. The customer service front desk asked to add WeChat, so I added it. Maybe it was from Atlantis. The service was obviously much worse. Many things were not informed. Even the shuttle bus for the next day was booked, but no one registered me. No one notified me when the time came. Fortunately, the customer service of Atlantis helped me to book a car. At 11:30 pm, there was no one at the front desk and concierge. The lady at the front desk gave me a necklace and fruit. Although the coconut was sour, I appreciated it. Actually, I can understand it, but I really can't give it five points.

msg:There are many hotels in Haitang Bay, and I chose Sheraton after a long struggle. What I was worried about at the time was that the hotel was more than 10 years old, and I was afraid that it would not be very good, but I still booked it because it was cost-effective. After checking in, it exceeded my expectations, so I wrote a special review. The hotel is indeed older, but it has been maintained in a timely manner and has not fallen into disrepair. It may be the off-season, and there are not many people in the swimming pool, and the experience is good. Sheraton and Marriott are connected, and the gym is shared. There are not many facilities, but the basics are sufficient, and there is basically no one. Our breakfast may be that there are really a lot of people during the intensive period when I went there. The waiters are equipped enough, clean up in time, and add meals in time. The things are only average in five-star hotels, and the variety is not particularly rich, but you can definitely eat enough. The above only makes me basically satisfied, and what is beyond my expectations is the service. The beautiful lady at the check-in front desk asked me about my arrangements for the next day and gave me a delayed check-out. Then the housekeeper Skye added me and introduced the hotel situation in detail. The most important thing is to reconfirm my itinerary for the next day and give suggestions. In the end, because the travel photography was seriously overtime, she helped me to extend the room until very late before checking out. I was really touched. If I go to Haitang Bay next time, I would still like to choose here.

The main reason is that it is suitable for families, has its own beach, is cost-effective, and has food, drink, and entertainment. When there are not many people, they communicate to delay check-out, which is also very heartwarming. Very good, family-friendly and worth recommending.

msg:Disadvantages: Hygiene: There are obvious hairs next to the toilet in the bathroom. It affects the mood as soon as you enter the room.
Breakfast: No merits or demerits, for example, the pasta is shredded pork and eggplant, and I don’t seem to see beef. There are various breads, and the taste is edible.
Minibar: My friend’s room has it but it is charged, and mine is not directly placed. They are all the same sea view rooms.
Fruit: It was delivered after a long time of check-in.
Takeaway: It can only be delivered to the cabinet outside the lobby. I live in the corner, like rushing to board a low-cost airline, and my legs are broken.
Good aspects: There are many swimming pools, even better than the JW Marriott next door. The two hotels are connected and can share external facilities.
The sea view is better than some hotels and is close to the sea. But it is still a little worse than the InterContinental. The beach is also dark yellow-brown, not as white and fine as the InterContinental.
Children: There are so many facilities to play, suitable for parents and children.
Late check-out: It was delayed to 2 pm, and I waited for half an hour to check in, which is considered to be a balance!
Suggestion: The drawer of the slipper cabinet can be placed over the window for easy access, because guests who check in for the first time may not know that the door at the back can be pushed and pulled.
Conclusion: If you come here for fun, it is better to choose a more expensive one, with a better beach and better service. If you are here to work and come to Haitang Bay to relax, you can choose the cheap one.

There are parrots, rabbits and lambs in the hotel that can be fed, and there are paid trains and electric cars to play with. There is also an indoor playground for children, but to be honest, it is quite average. The breakfast variety is quite complete, but it needs to be added. It would be better if there were some local characteristics of Hainan Island. For example, Qingbuliang, coconut rice, and desserts can be + Pandan cakes, which would be perfect. Oh, I forgot to mention the beach. The beach of the hotel is very far away and very dirty. It is completely different from what I imagined and it is very different from a few years ago. I hope that domestic resorts will get better and better!

Hygiene: The overall appearance is neat and clean. The hotel can be disinfected twice, but there are no disposable bath covers, bed covers, etc. You need to bring them by yourself.
Environment: The environment is super good. The park is full of landscapes and is very close to the sea. The restaurant buffet is highly recommended. The performance is wonderful. The housekeeper, Miss Anna, thoughtfully arranged C seats.
Service: The service is superb. The most satisfying thing about choosing Sheraton during this trip is Anna, the housekeeper. From the pick-up bus to home, the whole process was online. She was very enthusiastic and even upgraded the room. I went to Sheraton to find Anna, which gave me a sense of security.
Thank you Anna for your considerate service these days. I had a great time.
ps The guy at the bar in the hotel lobby is also very nice and good at bartending.
There are also performances 🪗 Very friendly and great service. Recommended to come to Sheraton in Sanya.

The hotel has several swimming pools, some suitable for adults, and many water parks that are particularly friendly to children.
The hotel is very close to the beach and the sea. The most important thing is that the sand on the beach is very clean, so you can take your children to dig sand and play in the water (but pay attention to the waves to avoid drowning).
The hotel has both Chinese and Western breakfasts, with rich styles, and the food supply is also very timely, clean and hygienic. Every day's breakfast is very satisfying!
Finally, it must be mentioned that the hotel's service is particularly good, especially on the day of check-in, there is a little assistant (Nana) who provides attentive service. Not only does she share perfect travel guides, but she also greets you attentively every day. If you have any questions, she will respond quickly!

Except that the room was a bit far away (at the end of the 8th floor), other services, facilities, breakfast, etc. were all very good. You can also go to the recreation center to get vegetables and feed rabbits and sheep. There are five public outdoor swimming pools, which are fun. The kids couldn't stop playing in the water park. The outdoor adventure camp is also a good place to take the kids out. The hotel's park is very large, with a high green coverage rate, and you can often see squirrels.

The environment is clean and tidy. Although the garden view is not as good as that of the Marriott next door, it is mainly simple, and you can also find some small highlights. The room is bright and well ventilated, and it's not noisy at night.

Eating is also convenient, just a ten-minute walk to the food court, where KFC has everything.

The service provided by NANA in the room was very good, helping us confirm the airport drop-off time, changing to a twin room, reminding us about travel photography appoin**ents, etc. All in all, this is a good value for money hotel.

msg:Apart from the duty-free shop, there is only Atlantis Water World in Haitang Bay, so in terms of the overall environment, there are not many things to do. The price of Sheraton is relatively affordable among the five-star hotels in Haitang Bay. The front desk was very welcoming. They had not yet vacated the room when we arrived. They helped store our luggage and introduced nearby places to eat. The guest room and balcony are both large. The bath, shower and toilet are separate. There is also an independent wardrobe, which can be said to be fully functional. The light on the top of the wardrobe seems to have no switch and stays on all night. It is difficult to sleep with the light on. The crowd was not very friendly. The three settings of the air conditioner in the guest room are relatively large, and the room temperature will not stop when it reaches the regulated temperature. It is best to turn it off when sleeping, otherwise it will be a bit cold. The breakfast is relatively rich, but with seven dining tables, I always feel that not many of them are suitable. I have never felt this way in other hotels. Maybe it’s because the temperature has dropped in the past two days. The hotel swimming pool is three degrees cooler than the swimming pools in other hotels in Sanya (the normal temperature swimming pools of hotels in Dadonghai and Yalong Bay are 28 degrees, while here it is 25 degrees). It felt a bit cold when I first entered the water. The snacks at the hotel’s afternoon tea were quite interesting, especially the little lion who made them so beautifully that I didn’t want to eat them in the end. When I press the room service button on the phone, I have to wait a long time for someone to answer (I tried it twice). If I press 0, it takes almost a second to answer. Maybe it was because it was full. I returned to the hotel room at 4pm on the first day and had not yet replenished consumables or cleaned up the garbage. I contacted the front desk and sat outside for an hour when I came back. I saw the waiter leaving with a vacuum cleaner from a distance; the next morning When the waiter came to clean the room at ten o'clock, he was changing clothes and getting ready to go out. Please wait five minutes to clean the room. However, when he came back at about two o'clock in the afternoon, it was still not cleaned. It took almost 30 minutes after calling the front desk to come, and the tea and coffee were not replenished twice. The hotel needs improvement. The hotel's outdoor lawn buffet dinner is good, but don't forget to spray some mosquito repellent on yourself. The hotel provides airport drop-off service, which is very considerate for Haitang Bay, which is far away from the airport.

I'll make a note on the member information! It was almost 3 o'clock in the morning when I arrived at the hotel this time. The hotel also upgraded me to a so-called room type. The sea view angle is particularly "good". I can also see the 180-degree panoramic view of the Grand Hyatt Hotel. The most important thing is that this is the backside. He thoughtfully allowed me to avoid being in the sun. ps: The cleaning ladies kept the room quite clean~ Oh, by the way, the last picture was taken from the balcony of the B&B where I stayed when I first came to Haitang Bay. Of course, the weather had some reasons.

msg:How should I put it? Others say that the hotel is too old, but for a hotel that has been open for so many years, it is already very good. It does not look like it has been open for a long time. Secondly, the price is very affordable, and the afternoon tea is very exquisite! As for the service, the room steward Nana is very warm and thoughtful. After adding vx, she can reply to messages very quickly. If there is anything in the room, she can be solved with just one message!
There are many entertainment facilities in the hotel. I can’t get enough of it even if I take my baby for a few days. There are many swimming pools and the baby playground is also very clean. In short, everything is great and it is very close to the beach. The hotel environment is also very good.

The only improvement: I hope the cleaning lady won’t come to clean up the trash during meals.

First of all, the beautiful women who checked in at the front desk had bright smiles and enthusiastic service. After staying for a few days, if there was any problem, the hotel's customer service staff on duty would always respond quickly and help solve the problem. Skye is one of them, praise. The breakfast variety is very rich and the crowd management is efficient. Restaurant foreman Liu Qiuting deserves special praise: after discovering that there were no red bean paste buns on the table, she immediately came over to apologize and arranged for a new steamer to be delivered to my room, which was touching. The electricians, cleaning staff, and concierge staff are all courteous and well-trained, and fully meet my expectations for the service standards of the Marriott Sheraton Hotel. A gym is ok but adding a few more strength machines would be perfect. Conclusion: I am satisfied with this resort. recommend.

The hotel arranged Olivia_Jiang’s attentive service on WeChat throughout the entire process. I was very satisfied. Especially the lawn buffet dinner. I was very satisfied. The dishes were good. , the waiter Coco Ou, a girl from Guizhou, is very sincere in her hospitality 👍, Zhang Xiuqin, the eldest sister from the Northeast, is talkative and enthusiastic. In short, five stars are five stars after all. Although the hardware facilities have undergone some vicissitudes, overall it is okay! The swimming pool water is clean, so it should be no problem to play with the kids in the water! The biggest regret is that the beach at Haitang Bay seems to be different from before. The beach is not gentle enough and even looks very steep in some places. The wind and waves are quite strong. If children get tired of playing in the sand, it will be more difficult to rush to the sea to find small crabs or other things. ! I went to the Yalong Bay Hilton on March 8 last year. The beach, hotel hardware and services were basically the same! But the price is almost half that of staying at the Hilton Hotel during the same period last year! value

msg:It is a cost-effective hotel in Haitang Bay, Sanya. After all, it is the lowest price among the surrounding five-star hotels. The infrastructure of the old five-star hotel is still there, including soundproofing, balconies, and sanitation. The check-in efficiency needs to be improved. When there are a lot of guests, the front desk can't handle the check-in quickly, and the guests and the front desk are anxious and angry. The service of other butlers is OK, basic level in Sanya.
The landscaping and swimming pool are not as good as the hotel next door. Breakfast is average. Generally speaking, Haitang Bay is indeed not as good as Yalong Bay in terms of sea view. Haitang Bay is suitable for young people who love water sports or shopping. If you want to eat nearby, I suggest you go to Linwang Night Market a few kilometers away. It’s basically safe.

msg:The overall feeling of Sheraton Haitang Bay Hotel is very good. In the context of traveling during the Spring Festival, it is impossible to require every detail of the hotel to be perfect. It's a comfortable and happy stay, and I'm very satisfied.

Facilities: 1. The internal amusement facilities are complete and very suitable for parent-child or family outings. 2. There are many foreign programs on the guest room TV, which fully demonstrates the internationalization of the hotel. 3. The breakfast is very rich and all kinds of meals are available.

Environment: There are many children staying in the hotel, but overall it is not noisy and the environment is comfortable. Going out from the hotel's garden is the beach. Swimming in the sea is prohibited in Haitang Bay. It's a good idea to check in at the beach.

Service: All services are in place. A hotel staff contacted me the day before check-in to confirm check-in information and provide butler service. The butler Alison introduced all the hotel's services very well.

cdf Sanya International Duty Free City shuttle bus: The hotel provides Sanya International Duty Free City shuttle bus, which requires advance reservation.

He arranged the room in advance and upgraded it. He also gave the child a small gift when he left. The child was happy all night. The service provided by the teacher at Bojue Travel Photography was also very good. The child was not in good condition that day. The teacher was also very patient and the photos were great. Maybe you can't go to the sea in Haitang Bay. There are not many people in the hotel, so it is quiet and comfortable. In the previous few days, there were either foreigners or children who stayed there. In comparison, the experience was greatly improved. It is convenient to eat near the hotel, and there are also underwater restaurants where you can check in.

Thank you to the housekeeper Olivia for helping me arrange a suite. It has a very large space, double balconies and a beautiful view.
The hotel's breakfast is the best I've had recently, but there are a lot of people and you have to queue up during peak hours.
A very wonderful experience. I will stay at the Sheraton next time I come to Haitang Bay.

msg:The rooms are very good, all balconies face the sea, the door is a passage, and the room is transparent when the door is opened. The best design is that the toilet and bathroom are on both sides, and the bathroom also has a sink, so you can wash on both sides. The garden view room is on the fourth floor, and you can only see the coconut grove. You can probably see the sea from the fifth floor. The swimming pool basically meets the requirements, but it has not been hot enough to go into the water these days. There is a heated pool for children, where you can play and have bubbles at noon and afternoon. There is indeed a lack of hot spring pools, and the children's pool is also cold water, so you can't go into the water when the weather is cold. The entertainment facilities basically meet the requirements. There are some electric amusement projects, small animal feeding, forest climbing, a large indoor children's playground, and the recreation center has indoor table tennis, Go, chess, and billiards. Before coming here, I didn't know that you couldn't go into the sea at Haitang Bay. The waves were too big and I didn't pick up any shells. I could only look at the sea. The breakfast tastes very good. There are restaurants on both sides. There are too many people in the main restaurant. We choose the other side to eat every time. There are few people and it is quiet. It is very nice to eat outdoors. One suggestion is that the buffet in the evening is indeed too expensive and too monotonous. The dishes are not worth the price at all. The performances are foreigners performing dancing, magic and fire dancing. It is better to have more down-to-earth programs and more singing and a**osphere programs.

Davey took the initiative to contact us two days before check-in to inform us of the hotel's various colorful children's activities. Considering that we had children, he arranged for us to check in as early as possible and gave us small gifts for children. At the same time, he reminded us of various matters regarding dining, entertainment, shopping and hotel activities. I contacted him many times in the evening for consultation and he responded quickly, which made me feel very embarrassed. Meeting such a butler during the trip made me feel that I was always available for consultation. A very warm and reassuring person. Davey is very professional and made me feel that in addition to hardware and warm service, the extra points of a five-star hotel are personalized services that better match the guests. It is very rare and made our travel experience even more perfect! It's a pity that I didn't have time to take a photo with Davey. I hope to see you next time!

Davey, the butler Chenchen, helped solve the problem meticulously and thoughtfully. I wanted to slap him directly on the head with 4 out of 5 praise points, which made me feel a little angry and felt very ironed. appropriate.

When I checked in, I was told that there was no room. I arranged to change to a regular room the next day. I suspected that it was sold to someone else at a high price. I called me that day to ask when I would check in at night. I said in the past that I had no room.
I was not given the e-voucher required for the Noodle Shop Package Adventure Park project when I checked in. I had to go to the front desk to ask for it on the second night. I woke up and left on the third day and didn't play any of those projects.
The compensation plan proposed by the hotel is to have dinner at the hotel or extend the stay at 10% off the online price for the day. If I didn't agree, I couldn't be contacted later, and no one answered the phone.

The bed and pillows are too soft and not friendly to the elderly. 2. The large floor-to-ceiling windows look nice, but they only have sliding doors and no windows with screens. Closing the windows makes it difficult to ventilate. Opening the windows can let mosquitoes in, which is difficult. 3. Whether the air conditioner in the room is heating, mode selection or hidden item needs to be adjusted by the engineering depar**ent. 4. Children like the tent in the picture very much, but the light wires are exposed outside, which is dangerous. 5. The table in the picture lost color after being wiped, which is scary. 6. There is no welcome fruit or minibar, but it was shown on Ctrip when booking the room. 7. The breakfast is standard five-star. The mango juice is delicious, but it is difficult to choose a few delicious ones from the dazzling array of food. If you go late, you have to queue up. The door is strictly guarded, and they are afraid that you will cause trouble if you go in. There are also advantages, the scenery in the picture is still very good. It feels like it may be more suitable for children, so be careful when bringing the elderly to live with you.

The hotel is conveniently located and the family rooms are spacious and comfortable.
It is recommended that the evening buffet is rich in variety and fresh, and there are parent-child performances during the period that the children like very much. The only drawback is that the constant-temperature swimming pool is small and the normal-temperature swimming pool is not open.

Special thanks to the housekeeper Rose, who helped prepare the room in advance. And carefully inform each activity of the precautions.
The rooms at Sheraton are quite large and comfortable. I especially like the design of the double bathrooms, so adults and children can wash and wash without affecting each other.
The scenery of the hotel is also very good, with a lot of vegetation, so there is no need to worry about being exposed to the sun.

This time I stayed at the Sheraton Haitang Bay Hotel. I booked a double sea view room, and the hotel upgraded me to a room type with welcome fruit. The large balcony with sea view is really great! The hotel is very close to the 68 Food Street. I had coconut chicken, fermented vinegar and Li Zhu Hainanese dishes. Before coming this time, the housekeeper Anna added WeChat and provided us with very considerate services. She was responsive to all requests. During our stay, she told me a day in advance that there would be a Chris**as lighting ceremony at the hotel in the evening. The buses to the airport and duty-free shops also followed the instructions we provided. The itinerary was all booked for us in advance. Special thanks to Anna for her meticulous service. The hotel's pool bubble party is also quite creative and has a full and cheerful a**osphere. We were also lucky enough to catch the fireworks show and watch the fireworks bloom from the balcony. It was really beautiful. I feel that Sheraton should be a very cost-effective hotel in Haitang Bay. Coming out of the room, you can reach the seaside through the beautiful swimming pool and garden landscape, which is very convenient. The hotel's service is good, the view is beautiful, and the room is big. I will stay here again next time.

The hotel is right outside the sea. The sea in Haitang Bay is still a bit dangerous, and the quality of the sand is also average, not as good as Yalong Bay.
The room is also very large, but I don't know if it is too damp. I changed the quilt twice, and the sheets were a bit moldy.
In terms of service, the hotel butler service is very good, with greetings and reminders every day, and small gifts for children before leaving.
The overall cost-effectiveness is really high. Recommended!

msg:The room was a bit old, and the room 7070 we were given had a musty smell. I was moved to a twin room on the 6th floor, which had a shared bed and was more spacious. The follow-up experience was great. Although it was old, the facilities and services were mature and considerate. The balcony has a beautiful view and you can watch the sunrise. It’s very friendly when traveling with young children. We stayed in the hotel for four days and three nights, so the baby wasn’t bored at all and the parents didn’t have to worry. Tips: Ele.me is convenient for ordering meals, buying swimsuits, snacks, etc. The housekeeper Chissy was very considerate in helping with late check-out.

The air conditioning in the room is 24 hours a day, and you can use electricity without inserting a card. It is only 3 minutes away from Haitang Bay Beach. The waves of Haitang Bay are really beautiful. , In addition, it is also very close to Wuzhizhou Island, where the sea is particularly clear.

msg:After staying at Atlantis in Haitang Bay, I came to Sheraton for the next two nights. I booked a garden view room. Unfortunately, it was fully booked and I couldn't upgrade to a sea view room. However, the room was still OK. It was clean and spacious. The balcony was not dusty. There were coconut trees outside the window. The forest scenery is also good.
The quality of the hotel's breakfast is good. Considering the cost-effectiveness, it can be considered excellent. The selection is relatively complete, and there are also local specialty Hou'an noodles.
The unfortunate thing about the Haitang Bay hotel is that the sea view can only be seen from a distance. The seaside is very windy and rough, so it is not suitable for swimming in the sea. You can only step into the water shallowly. However, there are still many swimming pools in the hotel, and there are not many people. The water is very clean, and the surrounding scenery is also very good, suitable for swimming and taking pictures.
Davey, the butler this time, also needs special mention~ He is very nice, and the service is considerate and thoughtful. He prepared welcome coconut juice for us, helped us with late check-out, and took the initiative to ask for help with luggage storage. Finally, he saw that our flight was late. , gave us airport lounge coupons and fast security check tickets, which was very considerate ~
Overall, it’s a very good experience~

Every moment is immersed in the beautiful seaside scenery. The experience at Sheraton Haitang Bay during this trip to Sanya was really great. It is a very cost-effective five-star hotel with a large swimming pool, seaside beach, lawn and coconut grove, and photo opportunities. Juejuezi focuses on a relaxing and comfortable location with a Southeast Asian resort style. It is located at No. 76, Haitang North Road, Haitang Bay Town, Haitang District, Sanya City. It is about 45 minutes from the airport, 7 minutes from the Sanya Duty Free Shop, and less than 10 minutes from the nearby commercial district, which is very convenient! There are many Sanya specialty stores in the bustling area around, so be sure to experience the Sanya style! Beautiful environment, and also Davey, the butler at the hotel where I stayed this time, was really great. The service was very attentive. He answered all my questions and responded to every request. I really like the service of Davey, the butler.

But you can’t guarantee a room at 3:00 pm, and you can’t get a room until 5:00 pm? (Is this also a business rule?) Why does the room smell so musty? Why are the mold spots on the air conditioner vents not cleaned in time? Why do the security guards and porters in front of the lobby not give instructions even when they see the car coming, and why do they ignore the guests' luggage? Why is the garbage in the elevator and elevator lobby not cleaned? Even if it has been there for hours! I really wonder if it is a hotel managed by Marriott? If so, I think there is a serious problem with the management of this hotel and it should be of serious concern to the top management of Marriott Hotel Management Group!

Davey, the hotel housekeeper, was very nice and communicated details and needs one day in advance. Although there was a summit meeting that day, because the elderly had to take a lunch break, we had to wait for lunch. When we arrived at the hotel, we were assigned a room, and the other room was also upgraded. It is invincible near the sea. During the stay, the butler Davey also arranged for a variety of fruits to be delivered to the room. The hotel room is quite large, and the wet and dry separated bathroom area is well planned. In short, it is cost-effective It's alright. Here we recommend the Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea at Caiyue Xuan Restaurant in the hotel. It’s delicious, great value, and the ingredients are fresh. It’s best to book in advance, otherwise you’ll have to wait a long time. It’s so delicious.

The location of the room is satisfactory, the follow-up photos of Platinum are satisfactory, and the airport bus and duty-free shop bus are convenient.
I arrived at 3 o'clock in the morning that night. When I opened the door, the room was clean, bright and at a suitable temperature. I walked to the balcony and saw the sky full of stars.
In the morning, you can lie in your room and watch the sunrise🌅, or you can choose to walk a few minutes to the beach and sit quietly waiting for the sunrise.
Delicious food and beautiful scenery at noon, comfortable and beautiful.

Before that, Chrissy asked about our needs and upgraded from a garden view room to an ocean view room. Baby supplies were also provided. The large balcony of the room was able to Looking at the sea, the large platform outside the door looks even wider.

I also watched a magic show and was invited to the stage to participate, which was full of a**osphere.

I felt good after staying for two days and extended my stay for another three days. Ctrip upgraded the room type for my extended stay.

msg:An internationally renowned five-star hotel chain that doesn’t live up to its name. I wonder if it’s because of the lack of service awareness after arriving in Sanya, or for some other reason? , the five-star hotel does not even have a computer desk, there is no window screen in the place where mosquitoes are infested, and the curtains of the resort hotel do not block the light. On the first day I checked in, I found that all the faces were immature children. After research, more than 70% of them were internships. A technical secondary school or junior college student checked into two rooms in the same house, 15 rooms apart, on the first day. They were promised to change, but there was no news after that. On the first day they checked in, they found that the floor drain of the basin could not block water, and the tatami sofa and hair bed The conditioner bottle is collapsed, the conditioner bottle is empty, all the problems have been reported one by one, and the promises have been implemented quickly but there is no news. Is this the service attitude and quality of a hotel that costs 2,000 yuan? Do you really think that all customers are taken advantage of? I really can’t understand it, and I understand why Sanya is always tepid and makes people love and hate it. But your hotel can’t do as the Romans do and lower your service and facility standards. It’s really abominable! !

Therefore, hotels like Sheraton that have a brand but no actual service content are not recommended, and Sanya is not recommended as a tourist destination.

When I came to Sanya during the Double Festival, I only encountered short-term showers in the first two nights. The rest of the weather was simply not too bad. good. I also had good luck with the accommodation. I spent a long time choosing the hotel and was almost repelled by the bad reviews of various hotels. In the end, I chose the well-established Sheraton. Before I even checked in, a housekeeper contacted me in advance to give me a warm reminder about the check-in. The order included The benefits were also sent in advance, including the hotel's activity schedule. Thank you very much to the housekeeper Shera. A very lucky thing, the garden view room I booked was upgraded to a sea view room 🤩🤩🤩 and there are so many swimming pools in the hotel that my baby can't even remember being in the water.
In addition, the hotel can directly lead to the seaside, but the sea conditions in Haitang Bay are very windy and choppy, so it is not suitable for going into the sea, so don’t! But it is an excellent sunrise viewing spot. Sanya is fun and I will come again.

msg:I booked a deluxe sea view room for 3 nights and got two buffets for two large and two small meals. The overall feeling is very good. We have stayed in more than ten hotels in Haitang Bay. In the past two years, the hotels have become more and more popular. Expensive, Sheraton is still very cost-effective.
1. Let’s talk about the room type first. When I first checked in, the front desk was quite cold. It was the first time I encountered someone who didn’t take the initiative to upgrade the room type when I checked in during the off-season. I thought the deluxe sea view room wouldn’t be bad and didn’t say anything. But when I arrived, the room was really nice. Disappointed, there is only a little sea view in the corner. After communicating with the housekeeper, we changed the room. The viewing effect was more than half a bit better. You can also see the drone show from Atlantis at night, and you can also watch it on the rooftop outside. to one o'clock sunset. The attitude of the housekeeper is still very good. Although the check-in is a bit unpleasant, it does not affect the rest of the journey at all. Seeing the beautiful scenery makes me feel good every day!
2. In terms of hygiene and facilities, the room is very clean. The cleaning aunt comes every morning to clean and replenish supplies. Occasionally there are small geckos, but they basically don’t affect anything. We lived on the 8th floor and did not encounter other bugs. No mosquito bites in the room. The air conditioner has a constant temperature of 26 degrees no matter how you adjust it, so it won't be too cold. It's not very friendly to people who are afraid of heat during the day when the sun is shining brightly, but children won't catch a cold without a quilt when sleeping at night.
3. The service attitude is very good except for the cold front desk at the beginning of check-in. The housekeeper has a very good attitude and will solve any problems in time. The concierge is also very good, and the aunties cleaning the corridors are also very enthusiastic. Say hello.
4. There are relatively few breakfast categories and the taste is average. It is not quite like a five-star hotel. It is a bit different from other surrounding hotels, but after all, the price is there, and the requirements cannot be too high.
5. Living in a seaside hotel with children means digging in the sand and taking a dip in the swimming pool. The room we live in is very close to the seaside. We go for a walk on the beach every evening. The sea breeze is very comfortable. There are sand digging tools on the beach and there are not many people. Taking photos is also very impressive. There are several swimming pools of various sizes and depths. You can use bath towels at will, but there is a charge for swimming rings. It is recommended to bring your own. They can be inflated for free. There is a bubble party in the children's swimming pool from 3 to 4 pm every day, which is a favorite among children. The swimming pool and children's playground only close at 10pm, so children can discharge their energy as much as they want.
6. Speaking of swimming, what I particularly like about Sheraton is that the lifeguards are very serious and responsible. I didn’t see any lifeguards playing with their mobile phones. One night we played in the deepest pool. The water was 1.5 meters deep. There was a The lady drowned quietly next to me. I didn't even react. I thought she was practicing treading water, so the lifeguard went into the water and rescued her. Only then did I know that she was drowning. If it was discovered late, the consequences would be disastrous! Thumbs up to the lifeguards here! The lifeguards take the children to play in the water responsibly, which makes them feel safe!

I stayed for two nights and the rooms were very clean. The interior of the room was consistent with the photos shown. I didn't encounter anything that was mentioned in the reviews. If there are bugs or poor sanitation, it may be that the sanitation of this room type is good. We are lucky, but the corridor is not soundproofed. We were given welcome fruits and booked free buses to duty-free shops and the airport. Although we didn’t get on the bus due to changes in our itinerary and had to take a taxi, the service was pretty good. The breakfast is average, and there are many restaurants in the hotel, some of which require reservations. The hotel has many swimming pools, but swimming rings cost money to rent. It is very close to the seaside. You can reach the seaside within a few minutes of walking out of the hotel. The sand on the beach is very fine and the water is very clear. There are few people in the off-season, but the housekeeper is enthusiastic and the experience is good. Overall, the stay is very comfortable~

msg:The five-point evaluation is for the hotel to quickly solve the problem; I haven't traveled for three years, and the first time I went to the sea, the beautiful Sanya, which is my child's favorite.
1. Reservation: Book hotels and air tickets through Ctrip, which is very convenient and can be freely combined according to your own economic situation and play style;
2. Hotel: I have never been to Haitang Bay, because it is close to the duty-free shop, and I have been to Sanya many times. I don't like to change hotels halfway, and the comfort of the hotel is particularly important to me. I chose to stay at the Sheraton for five days, which is an old hotel.
3. First impression: good things: the hotel is very beautiful, the sea view room can overlook the sea, it takes about ten minutes to walk to the beach, the swimming pool is under a coconut tree, it is really a family hotel, especially there is a swimming pool outside the room I really like that type of room. Bad aspects: Now that the focus is on, why do you get high scores even if you have a bad impression. There are many new waiters in the hotel. In restaurants, rooms, lobby and other places, you may meet young faces who cannot answer or solve your problems. You may also find that the service is not in place. Because it is night, I did not report it to the hotel, but the first At breakfast the next day, after I reported it, I received a call from the hotel housekeeper Miki in less than ten minutes. My problem was solved very quickly, and very quickly.
4. Solution and efficiency: Because of my obsession with cleanliness, the waiter took the initiative to clean twice a day. The housekeeper asked me about my needs and told me the discounts of the duty-free shop. I put a large box of purified water and offered to extend the room for me. There is also a car shuttle at the hotel gate, and there are buses to the duty-free shop and the airport. I really have no reason not to give such a service a full score. Of course, there is still room for improvement. Finally, let’s talk about it.
Five: Diet: Sanya is really a tourist city that attaches great importance to evaluation. Maybe the evaluation on Dianping is very important to them. Due to my health, I read Dianping for a long time and didn't dare to eat out. I basically settled for breakfast and dinner at the hotel. There are a lot of people at the buffet in the morning. Those who like to be quiet need to arrive at 7-9 o'clock, otherwise they will be full of children. I really like their Hainan noodles and fried dough sticks. There are also plenty of others. You can sit until eleven o'clock, which saves lunch 😄; I recommend his Yuexuan Chinese restaurant. It is between Marriott and Sheraton. You can buy a 420 set meal from Dianping. There are two kinds of seafood and farm dishes. I tried both. The taste and price are very good, enough for three adults up. For the buffet, it’s fine if you don’t have a good appetite. I don’t think it’s too cost-effective. There is no beer, which is a pity. I tried the one near Haitang Bay without killing customers. The taste is so-so, and the price is not much cheaper.
6. The sea: The Sheraton is very close to the sea, and we arrived there in a short walk. We couldn't go swimming in the sea, so we walked and rested on the beach by the sea. We were lucky enough to meet fishermen fishing and pulling their nets. It was really a bumper harvest.
To sum up: For a hotel guest who mainly rests, the Sheraton is still very comfortable, with a big balcony, blowing the sea breeze, listening to the occasional singers and birdsong in the distance, I hope new employees can grow up quickly, the hotel has a little time, The place that needs to be refurbished also needs to be repaired. I hope that there will be more Miki in Sheraton in the future so that guests can have better vacation memories😄

Whether I go for breakfast at eight o'clock or nine o'clock, there are many people and sometimes I have to wait for a while. The occupancy rate is very high. We stayed with family and friends for 3 nights. The room was large and although we couldn't see much of the sea from the balcony, our eyes were green. This hotel has many swimming pools and meets everyone's needs. If you wake up early, you can watch the sunrise, which is beautiful.

msg:The overall experience is very good, I will consider staying here next time.
1. Location: It is located in Haitang Bay. Although it is a bit far from the check-in scenic spot, the overall environment is very quiet and the environment is very good. The beach is very windy and it is not possible to go into the sea, but I really don’t want to swim in the sea. I sit on the beach and watch the sea and feel dazed. The waves hitting my calves are enough.
2. Room: It does feel that the decoration of the room is a bit old, but overall it is very clean. Room type upgraded for free. They also helped me change to a room closer to the lobby, which was a great experience.
3. Eat and drink: The daily breakfast at Fengyan Western Restaurant is very rich, with many types, and changes to varying degrees every day. The freshly ground coffee from the coffee machine is delicious. I met Miss Liu Qiuting from the western restaurant. She was very enthusiastic and even offered green coconuts and fruit plates.
Throughout the holiday, Sheraton brought me a good feeling. Next time I come to Sanya, I will consider Haitang Bay and Sheraton.

I bought a deluxe sea view room but the view was average. Really average. Only by sticking your head out and squinting can you see the sea view.

I booked a hotel for two nights at a time and confirmed it when I checked in. However, the room card actually failed the next day. I was very tired and had to go to the front desk to get a new room card.

All in all, everything is average and feels substandard.

msg:Not an ideal stay
Many of the dissatisfaction points are actually small problems, but when they are piled together and trigger combos, it will make people very uncomfortable.
1. The layout design of the room is really unreasonable. We booked a family suite (can accommodate 4 adults). We also clearly stated 4 large and 1 small, but the room given to us was obviously for two adults. A room designed for a child, which consists of one large bed and two 1.2-meter small beds. To be honest, it is quite cramped for adult men;
2. Then 1.2 there is no light switch on the bedside of the small bed... and there is only one socket (to plug in mosquito coils). What should I do if I want to play with my mobile phone while lying in bed? ?
3. Of course, I may not have considered letting you lie on the bed and play with your mobile phone. After all, there are two small children's beds, because the bedside is not made of soft materials and is directly on the wall. It is really difficult for you to lie on the bed and play...
4. I mentioned mosquito coils earlier. In this climate and temperature, mosquitoes are really normal. The hotel also gave us a very warm reminder that we were closing. But the problem is that the air conditioner in the room is extremely crappy. When the temperature reaches the set temperature, it stops completely and no air blows out... causing the room to feel stuffy and suffocating. If you want to continue to blow out the air, you have to continue to lower the temperature.
5. Then the combo was triggered, and the air outlet was blowing directly towards the head of the bed. In this case, the quilt was cold without covering it, but it was very hot when covered with it, so after sleeping in the hotel for the second night, This damn air conditioner successfully gave my children and my wife colds? (We have been in Sanya for a long time. We were fine playing in the water and blowing the sea breeze, but we caught a cold after two days here.)
6. Then the combo was triggered again. After catching a cold, they were on a plane today. During takeoff and landing, their ears were very uncomfortable and they screamed in pain?
7. In addition, when cleaning the room, the trash can does not have a garbage bag. Of course, as long as the housekeeper is willing to clean it, I think it is okay. But in case there is some wet garbage dripping, is it really good to pretend like this? ?
8. Then, although the suite is occupied by a family, after all, there are differences between men and women. I think it is acceptable that the two rooms cannot be locked, but the bathroom cannot be locked. I really can’t understand it. If you I think it is risky to add a lock. How about adding frosted glass to the bathroom? ? Oh, yes, there is no place to hang clean clothes in such a big bathroom. It is really inconvenient to take a shower and change clothes.
9. The hotel's equipment maintenance is in a worrying state. The faucet switch in the bathtub was easily turned off. The most serious problem is the room door. If the door is not closed tightly, it may get stuck in one position and not be closed tightly. This is really a risk. too big.
10. The hotel restaurant does not provide heating service. If you order too much food when traveling and pack it back, it cannot be heated. Of course, I didn't ask the front desk about this, but I think the restaurant doesn't provide it. I'm afraid it would be more difficult for the front desk?
11. The experience of booking a room before coming here is also very poor. The customer service's Mandarin is a bit difficult to speak. And the most ridiculous thing is that the reservation depar**ent actually gets off work at 6 o'clock, and no one cares about it after 6 o'clock in the evening. Of course, my final reservation on Ctrip itself did not involve hotel customer service, but the problem was that I called the hotel reservation phone number before 6 o'clock to inquire about this room type, but the answer given by the customer service was that it was fully booked and would be returned to me. I explained that it is very "tight" now... so I accidentally found out that Ctrip could still book a room at 8 o'clock in the evening. I didn't know if I dared to book a room. The people in the hotel reservation depar**ent told me that there was no room available, and Ctrip Do I still dare to order? ? Then I called the front desk to inquire and was really confused. It took at least 2 hours to finally confirm with the front desk, reservation depar**ent and manager that there was indeed a room, and then I dared to place an order...

Of course, there are also good places, such as the beach is really comfortable, the swimming pool is clean, and the garden environment is really beautiful. In the end, it can actually be seen. I think all the problems are actually trivial matters when I mention them. However, as a 5-star hotel, so many problems can be combined together to form a set of combos. I think it is still It’s a bit incomprehensible that such a high charge can’t even handle these details, so what is the money used for? ? ? ?

msg:There is something wrong with Marriott's hotel management.
As a gift, I booked a room for my friend's family of two adults and two children. Ctrip said that breakfast for children under 12 years old is free, but when my friend checked with the hotel on the night of arrival, he was told that children need to pay 99 yuan per person for breakfast. My friend called me to ask. I was very embarrassed. I called Ctrip customer service. Ctrip communicated with the hotel that the hotel had changed the policy but Ctrip did not change it in time. This was a communication problem between Ctrip and the hotel, so Ctrip solved the problem for my two children. Free breakfast. But because of the unpleasantness in the process, my gift was too shameless. (What if my friend is too embarrassed to tell me because of his face? He should pay for it himself!) The hotel manager on duty that day was also very kind and offered to compensate the guests for free access to two recreational activities the next day. I also informed the guests. As a result, when the guests went there the next day, the Recreation Depar**ent said they could only choose one of them. In the end, because the two children argued about which one to play, they ended up not playing either one. After communicating with the room manager, the room manager said that he did give two free meals. It should be that there was another communication problem between the hotel and the Recreation Depar**ent. In the end, it was delayed for a long time and people were no longer in the mood to play, so they just left...
It's not a big deal, but I'm giving this as a gift. Because of the communication between the hotel and Ctrip, the hotel's internal communication is not in place, and problems occur frequently. In the end, this gift caused trouble for both myself and my friends.
Marriott management shouldn't be like this...the experience was terrible this time.

The people in the restaurant follow the crowd, and the dishes are single, which does not match the hotel. Ctrip booked a pool room worth more than 2,000 yuan per night. I was taken advantage of, and I couldn’t change it 30 minutes after placing the order. The package on the official account is only 3899 for a three-night stay. Is this a price war between the hotel and Ctrip?
Every aunt who cleans the customer service is very nice, and we must give special praise!

The beach barbecue is also very average, and the quality of many dishes is not good. During your meal, the waiter will keep asking, "Have you finished eating? Can you take it away?" The performance is also very coping, without any a**osphere. The most amazing thing is that after eating, I went to the beach for a walk and passed the table where I used to eat, but no one took it away. Absolutely! !
Watching the sunrise on the beach is great, the sand is very fine and soft, and there are not many people. Sisters who want to see the full sea view can take the elevator to the 8th floor and there is a large terrace.

It's a wonderful itinerary, Rose's service is also very good, the bed is very comfortable, I want to buy a set of bedding at home. It's very quiet, probably because the room is relatively large, and the sound in the corridor is only heard occasionally. The room is relatively far away, there are not many floors but the wingspan is relatively large, and it took a while to get to the room.
The main reason is that the scenery is good, and there are several swimming pools under the coconut trees on the deck chairs, with various depths, which is super suitable for children.
Going late for breakfast is really queuing up, so go as early as possible. The breakfast varieties of normal star-rated hotels are both Chinese and Western. The rare thing is that the taste is in place. The deepest impression is that the maple syrup is really sweet. No wonder ross can't finish eating.
The luggage butler service is great, saving time and effort👍

The swimming pool is very good, not only the quantity is large, but the water is also clean. The hotel is directly connected to the seaside. I have to say that the seawater in Haitang Bay is still very good, blue and clear.

msg:Facilities: The hotel is old, and all the facilities in the room look old. There are many types of swimming pools, which can satisfy children, but there may be too many, and the swimming pool water is not very clean.

Environment: The location is in the middle of the major hotels in Haitang Bay. The beach has big waves but is clean. Except for the hotel guests, there are basically no other people, unlike Dadonghai, which is crowded with people. .
Service: The butler Chrissy is very beautiful and has a very good attitude and speaks softly.

Complimentary breakfast for kids 12 and under: This works great. Especially for someone like my family who struggles to eat, there is really no need to spend more than 100 to bring her to breakfast. Also, the breakfast at the Sheraton was a little disappointing. It was the worst on this trip, not as good as the more than 300 Tibet Hotel. .
Maybe it's due to the holidays, there are many people queuing up, and half an hour without air conditioning in the lobby is the limit, which affects the mood. But compared to the price of surrounding hotels, it's okay, so I booked it.

Two big bags of fruit, really very hard! Give a happy experience! Although the Sheraton has a strong sense of age, but the location is good, there are many swimming pools, and the children's foam pool is enough to play, the main reason is that the price is very cost-effective! So overall it's ok! There is also an animal area in the hotel, which is very ecological! The service directed at the butler is still very satisfactory! ! ! Anyway, I can come! ! !

msg:It's an old hotel, and the facilities are relatively old. The shower in the room that catches up with the bathroom sprays water into the cracks in the bathroom door, which makes it impossible to take a normal bath and spills water all over the place. It's not convenient to call the service to clean it up in the middle of the night. But the next morning, I called for repairs and came quickly. I want a twin room, the bed is big enough, because there is no bed around during the peak season, the child was too tired to play during the day and fell down on the table in the middle of the night. During the day, the manager Miki was very responsible and gave the child a gift as a comfort. It may be because there are too many guests, and I feel that the service staff is not very enthusiastic. I asked the front desk for the airport bus and replied directly that I need to make an appoin**ent one day in advance, and I didn’t say to help check whether there are any vacancies. The hotel buffet was changed to a feast in case of rain. There was a good show, but at the same time as the show, many children and parents gathered around the first few tables to watch the show, which surrounded the entire first few tables, and the seats booked in advance could not see the show. Yes, it’s awkward to let other people eat and drink around me. The service staff doesn’t guide the guests to walk around casually. Some parents stand on the dining table with their children in their arms and watch. I’m still eating, so I’m speechless. The most interesting activity for children is fishing, which is very fun to catch. There are too many mosquitoes in the jungle adventure, and spraying toilet water does not work, but it is good for children to be happy. It is relatively close to the sea, but it is dark at night and there is nothing to do, so you can wait to catch crabs. The hotel and Marriott are connected, there are small trains and battery cars, and strolling is also possible. There is also a coconut tree corridor that is very artistic. The cockroaches are huge, and the snails are also huge and many. Don’t look at your phone at night, be careful to step on the snails

Needless to say about the facilities, the service is also great👍 The housekeeper, Chrissy, contacted me to see what I wanted before I checked in. She solved the breakfast problem and upgraded me to a super beautiful sea view room. Thanks to the hotel staff for their support during the stay Excellent service 👍👍 Opposite Wuzhizhou Island, you can see the sunrise in the morning, and I also caught up with the drone show next door. The seaside at night is really stress-relieving. It is recommended to stay in the preferred room 7083👍

msg:This is my first time staying at the Sheraton in Haitang Bay. I booked a pool room, which is very convenient for swimming. Although I can't see the sea, I can see the garden-view children's pool, which is also very good. The advantage is that there are many swimming pools, and there are many chairs and loungers next to the swimming pool, so you can find a place to sit if you want to rest; the customer service and cleaning staff are also generous in providing bottled water, so they don’t have to search for it; the Hainanese noodles for breakfast are delicious; the takeaway cabinet is placed at the entrance of the lobby. Very convenient to pick up takeout. The disadvantage is that the room has a bit of a smell, maybe because the exhaust air is not strong enough; the breakfast is average except for Hainanese noodles; except for a young female staff member who took the initiative to say hello in the hotel, other staff members would not talk to each other when they came face to face. The guests were greeted, but the service was okay. They helped with luggage and cleaning, and they were all polite. The male staff who checked in at the front desk said nothing after the check-in. You need to take the initiative to ask where to have breakfast, otherwise you won’t say anything; the staff’s efficiency is a bit low, and you have to wait for a long time for cleaning to come. I wanted a memory foam pillow, and the front desk said it was available, but the one they brought was a buckwheat pillow. Very strange. However, these problems are minor matters, and overall it is good. Especially the swimming pool room is very cost-effective and worth recommending.

Service: Before check-in, a housekeeper will contact you in advance. Xiao Luo is really responsible, because there are more adults in the hotel. If there is a need for room service, it will take a long time to call the front desk, but as long as you contact Xiao Luo, it will be resolved immediately, which is very fast. He will also patiently explain how to use the duty-free shop discount and arrange drop-off.
Environment: The hotel recommends sea view rooms, the lower floors cannot see the sea. However, if a family brings their children to play, they can play in the hotel. The hotel has different parent-child activities every day, and you can choose to participate. There are also many swimming pools in the hotel, and there is also a children's water playground, which is a good place for children to walk.

Hygiene: It is not a new hotel, maybe because it is near the sea, it has a somewhat musty smell

Ms. Rose has actively contacted me since I was still in Yalong Bay, added WeChat, and carefully asked about the age and needs of the children.

It was scary when I didn't read the reviews. On the contrary, my baby is too good at making garbage. There is a pile of garbage every day. I have to trouble the guest room to collect it twice. . . All kinds of swimming pools are liked by children and adults alike. The sea view is also great, the children woke up early and even took pictures of the sunrise! When checking out, Elsa Pengsha also gave away two treasure toys. The two babies are very happy, and they will go again next time!

At noon on the day of check-in, the luggage butler Karry has contacted me in advance to arrange check-in, and also gave a fruit plate as a gift. Sanitation cleaning and water supply are also very timely and efficient. There are many large and small swimming pools in the hotel, and there are many parent-child activities. The waiters are friendly and polite. The location of the sea view room is also very good, I will come again next time😁...

msg:I took the children on a family trip, and I didn’t want to be too tired, so I found a family hotel. There are many small swimming pools, which are convenient for children to walk around. There are also entertainment facilities such as ocean balls. It’s really convenient. The rooms are also clean and tidy. Ruby, the housekeeper of the hotel, no matter what time you contact her, she can basically reply quickly and arrange what we need. There is also a leader Alana in the lobby when we check out, who is also very kind. He helped us check out, and finally arranged a hotel car to take our children and adults with us to the next hotel.

The hotel service staff is considerate and considerate. When we checked in, we were upgraded to the highest level and gave us welcome fruits. I also enjoyed the late check-out privilege due to the flight delay. I am very grateful to the Sheraton Hotel and its dedicated staff.
The hotel room is large, with minibar, bathtub, safe, and many TV channels. The bathrobes with the Sheraton logo are great. The balcony has a beautiful view.
The hotel has a gym, a spa, and a parent-child amu*****t park. You can watch performances while having a self-service barbecue. Across the coconut grove is Haitang Bay Beach, with a nice view.
The hotel has many swimming pools, including a children's paddling pool and a water volleyball pool, especially suitable for parent-child and honeymoon travel.
It is worth a try to book a hotel to send earl travel photos.

It is very convenient to eat, play and shop. The hotel has been open for a few years, but the maintenance of the facilities is still online, the breakfast is quite satisfactory, there are many parent-child activities, there are many types of swimming pools, and the sunshade and sunscreen are also in place.

msg:I usually don’t write reviews, mainly because I’m lazy😁I’m not an internet celebrity and need traffic, I just hope it’s useful to everyone. This time, I took my baby and my mother to a free trip to Sanya. I didn’t do any guides or special plans. I just took a vacation. I found this hotel on ** but the host was very arrogant and only had few room links, so I placed an order with Ctrip and booked it with Ctrip. The sea view room for two nights was much more cost-effective than during the peak season. I arrived at the store at 11 o'clock on the 23rd and received my sister Anna. Lin checked in very gently and quickly. The room layout was very reasonable. Although it took 10 years to renovate, the objective evaluation was still very good. It's a bit strange how those negative reviews came about. 😜. The double bed is very wide and there is a sofa and a lounge chair. There are also lounge chairs on the balcony. It feels like there is no problem for 2 adults and 2 children.
The housekeeper Olivia_Jiang is also very patient and considerate, answering all questions and deserves praise. The thing I want to praise the most is the breakfast. 9-9:45 is the peak dining period. I suggest you avoid the peak period. I went to the restaurant at 9 o'clock. Aᴅᴏʀᴇ was so attentive. He helped me choose a seat, poured me coffee and asked me how I felt. He was considerate. Sending fruits and showing concern after leaving the hotel, really don’t be too considerate🥰The employees in a hotel are all like Aᴅᴏʀᴇ. How can you do anything wrong like this? The only regret is that the follow-up photo provided by the hotel was not used. The customer service staff said that it was too busy. It would be more convenient for customers to make reservations if the time was written on the photo. After all, the photos are stored beautifully and can be promoted easily. This can be improved

Haitang Bay is also suitable for leisure. It is far away from attractions, but the hotel is very close to the duty-free shop. Girls who like shopping can make an appoin**ent. The nearby food court is not big either, and you can eat brown rice vinegar hot pot. The main thing is that the handsome guy has good service, haha.

msg:All five-star satisfaction. I really want to praise the Sheraton service. I booked for two nights at first with the mood of trying it out. Thinking of the richness of children's play, and the reviews all praise the service, the only thing is the old hotel, and the facilities are inevitably a little outdated. After check-in, although the lobby environment, corridors and rooms can be seen to be old, the sanitary conditions are still good, and I don't feel dirty because of the age. Then we talked about the service. The lady at the front desk saw us bringing the baby, and helped us choose a sea view room on the highest floor. Then I remembered the child's birthday in the ***** calendar, and asked if there was any activity the day before yesterday, because I was working on the Gregorian calendar day. I didn't buy a cake for my birthday, but I readily agreed to work overtime to make a cake. I felt very embarrassed and said that if it was late, I would forget it tomorrow. Without hesitation, the young lady said that it would be delivered in the evening. Finally, I would like to praise the butlers Rose and Wang Boce. They not only arranged to check in the fruit, but watched me take care of the old and the young alone. They always asked us if we needed help, helped us solve the problem, and also helped us apply for a late check-out.
    The most important point is that the location is very convenient, and there is also a shuttle bus to the duty-free shop at the airport. It only takes about ten minutes to take a taxi to the duty-free shop, which is very good.
    In the end, there is no harm without comparison. I regret that I chose a famous Sleep ❌ B&B in Sanya Bay on the last day of the holiday. The scenery is really good, but the room smells very lime, which disturbed my whole trip. I regret that I did not stay at the Sheraton for another night. . The family members said that there is no comparison at all, the key is that the price of the homestay is more expensive.
    Don't say anything, thank you Sheraton for giving us the best memory of this trip, see you next time 😘

Island Cute Baby Amu*****t Park: Guests who stay are free to play, and the inside is very big. We lived in St. Regis before, and the indoor playground was not as big as Concorde.

Like Yanlord, it also has a lot of parent-child activities, but some charges are charged. Of course, the price is incomparable. It is suitable for family travel and cost-effective It’s very high, I bought a set meal, and there is a seafood buffet in it. This is the first time I ate a buffet while watching a performance by the sea. The children enjoyed watching it very much. I was full. If you don’t want to eat this, you can also go out to the left of the hotel There is 96 Food City in Haitang Bay 700 meters away, and there are more choices. Even eating the hotel buffet for two days, the menu will change slightly for two days. Hahaha, it’s quite unexpected. The dishes, the taste of the cake, and the raw materials of the juice are all good. The hotel’s entire outdoor swimming pool seems to be shared with the Marriott next door. It’s a bit sunburnt, but the photos are taken out. There are small animals in the hotel, and you can go and feed the rabbits and lambs. Every staff member you meet is very kind. My son wants to make friends with them. Patience, Earl Tour, unlike other hotels who are perfunctory with follow-up photos, and did not change me because I only wanted to use free photos. Special thanks to Ms. Olivia for taking the initiative to help postpone check-out. My son also likes her very much , kindly call her beautiful sister ☺️

This time I accompanied my 90-year-old mother to visit Sanya in late June and chose to stay at the Sheraton Haitang Bay Resort, which left a good impression on us. First of all, the external environment of the hotel is very beautiful. The Spanish architectural style embedded in the dense coconut groves is particularly charming. The hotel has complete facilities. Although it has been in business for more than 10 years, the maintenance and management work is very good. The feeling is good, especially the service attitude of all the staff is very warm and friendly, responsive to every request, and the service is in place. I would like to thank Ms. Anna Lin from the housekeeping depar**ent for preparing the room for me before I arrived at the hotel. Thank you I would like to express our gratitude to you for explaining the usage hours and precautions of various facilities in the hotel, and for making restaurant reservations for me and making us feel at home. The hotel's breakfast is not bad, and the quality of the variety is good. The only thing that is not ideal is that the breakfast room is a bit hot during the dining period, because the hot weather will affect the appetite. The dishes in the Chinese restaurant are still delicious, and the Yacui dinner is also very special, which makes people have endless aftertaste. I will choose it next time.

msg:The hotels in Haitang Bay are lined up along the beach. Sheraton and JW Marriott are next to each other and share some hotel facilities, such as the airport shuttle bus. The hardware facilities of the Sheraton seem to be relatively new, but at the end of May, in Haitang Bay, where the temperature is 34°C, the entire lobby of the Sheraton does not have any air-conditioning equipment. The staff themselves are miserable, sitting in the lobby waiting for the airport bus at 14:15, sweating dripping down. Another failure is the air conditioner in the room, which is manually adjusted to 18°C, but actually can only be maintained at 23°C on the display, and the room temperature is a few degrees higher. The quilt for sleeping at night is too thick, and the hands and feet are stretched out just to be blown by the cold wind, and it is stuffy to cover under the quilt. The next day, I asked the room attendant to change two thinner quilts, which was slightly better. I'm really not afraid of thick quilts, but I'm afraid that the air conditioner is not cold enough! At the same time, justin and Xiao Wu, the housekeepers at the front desk, have a strong sense of customer service and tried their best to eliminate the dissatisfaction of the guests. They offered to change rooms, sent fruit plates, and 3 green coconuts with the Sheraton logo hot stamped as greetings. It can be seen that the hotel's top management has a high degree of authorization for front-line employees.

The hotel has Ctrip luggage delivery value-added service, free of charge, it is recommended to experience it.

The richness of hotel facilities is not as rich as Yalong Bay Tianyu, etc. At the same time, the charging items in the hotel are too eye-catching, such as: the price list in the small refrigerator in the room, the price list of several restaurants such as noodle restaurants, and the unpowered hand-operated boat by the children's pool There is also a fee, and there is a third-party popsicle cart in the lobby. A popsicle sells for 40 yuan. It is really a Rolls-Royce among popsicles. There is nothing wrong with high-priced consumption in five-star hotels, but from the perspective of geographical location and long-term perspective, it is difficult for Sheraton to have repeat customers.

During the holidays, I caught up with my family's birthday. Rose helped arrange the birthday cake and booked the bus before leaving. The service is very warm and thoughtful, thank you very much!

There are many swimming pools in the hotel, and the garden leads directly to the sea, which is very suitable for family vacations with children.
The room style is more elegant and simple, and the wet and dry separation bath is very comfortable, but the wall of the balcony is a bit old.
In short, this stay is relatively cost-effective, and the butler service is good, which can meet the vacation needs of Sanya!

        The design of the hotel's park is very good and beautiful. Coconut groves, flowers, lawns, swimming pools, and buildings set off each other, which is both majestic and exquisite. It is also close to JW Marriott. The park is interconnected, and you can appreciate different buildings and experience different customs. Wake up in the morning, walk on the alleys in the park, the air is fresh, the birds are singing, and you can feel the cool sea breeze, and you will feel the good feeling of vacation; Fireworks in the world, song and dance shows, and performance shows make the beautiful night boil. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, and there are cosplay character shows interspersed with interactions, and taking pictures with the children, the a**osphere is very good.
        The hotel's facilities are a bit outdated. If it is properly renovated, the living experience will be better. During the stay, I also saw that the hotel was redecorating the first floor.
        Overall, the check-in experience is very good, and I would like to express my thanks again to the housekeeper Xiao Zeng for his warm service!

Ms. Huang at the front desk of the hotel called me and told me that the room had been arranged according to my requirements. Let me add her to work on WeChat If you have any questions, you can contact me at any time, because my wife and grandson are allergic to cigarettes, so I contacted the front desk of the hotel before I boarded the plane. When I arrived at the hotel entrance, the waiter immediately came to help with the luggage. The room is arranged opposite the balcony of the sea view room on the 5th floor That is, Haitang Bay can be seen from the side of Atlantis. The room is very clean and tidy, and there is no peculiar smell. My wife and children are very satisfied. At night, I listen to the sound of the waves and watch the performance by the seaside of the hotel. Warm and thoughtful, the front desk has already booked a seat for me early, the buffet breakfast the next day is also relatively rich, the waiters and chefs are very enthusiastic, the price/performance ratio of the Sheraton Haitang Bay Hotel is good, and I will come again next time and stay a few more days.

As the second hotel for a parent-child trip, the price-performance ratio of the Sheraton is much higher than expected. Before I checked in, I heard that this hotel is very old, but after I checked in, I didn't feel that it was old. On the contrary, the sea view is much more beautiful than the Yanlord where I am now, and it is the C seat of Haitang Bay Hotel Sea View. Looking at the sea view on the balcony every night, listening to the singer's singing in the lobby, I feel the relaxation and enjoyment brought by vacation! Here I would like to especially thank the staff Justin, who provided us with very considerate service throughout the whole process. Knowing that we did not bring sand digging tools, we prepared water guns and sand dredging tools for our baby. We provided us with fresh fruits when we checked in and out of the store. Thank you, baby This handsome uncle was very impressive. Customers who stay at the Sheraton can also take a tour bus or walk to the Marriott next door, spend one hotel price, and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the two hotels, it is really the king of cost performance! Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely stay at the Sheraton again. Thank you Justin and the Sheraton Hotel for bringing unforgettable and pleasant memories to our trip! !

It's a pity that Haitang Bay can't go into the water. After playing with the motorboat, I found that there are jellyfish in the deeper sea, so it's good to wade in the sea.

But I also made a reservation in advance and needed a child's bed bumper. After staying for three days and two nights, there were no bed bumpers. They said they had run out. During this period, I asked for the children's bathrobes several times. They said that they were all used up and were being disinfected. The children's bathrobes were not delivered until the afternoon of the next day. I didn't check in at the hotel until around 4pm on the first day and there was still one room that hadn't been cleaned. The experience was very poor. I decided to change hotels and all the problems were solved.

The water is clean and there are not many people. There is also a shallow water area where children can play. It is about 1 km away from Atlantis. You can go along the beach or the road. Is the room environment clean? The facilities are a bit old, no The good experience is, 1. The hotel price is 900 yuan/day, which includes a lot of packaged services, but some of them are actually tasteless. 2. Very damp. The quilt always feels wet and uncomfortable, and there are many mosquitoes. 3. It is very inconvenient to eat around, because there are no supermarkets and commercial areas in the remote area, and takeaway is also super expensive. It would be great if the surrounding facilities can be provided. 4. Haitang Bay can't go into the sea due to heavy waves.

msg:Because of the itinerary plan, I had to stay in Haitang Bay for two nights. At that time, considering that the package offered by the hotel was very good, two dinners and parents and children could give away travel photos, I compared various aspects and finally chose Sheraton. The experience of staying for three days and two nights is perfect. Check-in was very fast. As soon as we arrived at the room, the housekeeper rose called to ask about the check-in experience. After adding WeChat, we were reminded of the hotel's service items and arrangements at any time, and asked about the check-in experience every day, and what services were needed. I also arranged for the baby to deliver fruit, baby bath products, slippers, bath towels, etc. to the room, very careful and thoughtful. Next, let’s talk about the project experience in the package in detail, and give some suggestions to the small partners in need:
1. Check-in experience: The room is large, the balcony is spacious, the hygiene is good, and the bedding is comfortable. Insufficient to say: it may be that the sea view can not see so much, because the hotel has a large green area, and there is still a distance from the sea. We live on the fourth floor, so if you have a sea view, you need to think more about it
2. Dining experience: Both the buffet breakfast and the buffet dinner are very rich and the ingredients are really fresh. Personally, I think the buffet dinner is very cost-effective. The breakfast is not repeated every day. The first day breakfast has wonton and the second day has Hainan The powder tastes very good, and one night I arranged a set meal at Caiyuexuan. The service staff there are very enthusiastic, and another waitress named Hu Fan is super enthusiastic. The set meal is enough for three adults, but it is not counted. be amazed
3. Children's amusement projects: The children's playground on the first floor is very large, and the baby can consume all his energy in it and then take it back to the room to sleep. Haha, there are different projects arranged at different times of the day. We experienced feeding small animals pool foam party this is so friendly
4. Bojue travel photography: the butler rose helped to make an appoin**ent, and soon the earl’s customer service called to confirm the shooting time. The five photos were very good. When I chose the film, I didn’t strongly recommend adding a film. It’s a surprise 😂 no It will be Earl haha general demeanor
The overall feeling is very, very satisfied~ I will choose Sheraton again in the future

The buffet breakfast is very rich, and there are seats and meals in the baby meal area, swimming pool, and children's play area, which is very suitable for Xiaobao's parent-child hotel.

The part near the sea is a public beach, except for people and horses, beach buggies passing by and so on. The hotel has a lot of parent-child and entertainment facilities. Babies love small trains and take them every day. The children's pool is also fun. In the evening, there will be parent-child activities such as S show performances on the lawn. There are also small animals in the hotel. The hotel maintains the lawn and swimming pool all the time. Mosquitoes and insects are repelled every day. There are no mosquitoes during the stay. The most important thing is that there are so many hangers in the room. The two big ones and the one small are almost enough to change every day and swimsuits. Environment: The beach is about five or six minutes on foot. Although it is a public beach, you can still see workers cleaning it all the time. The greenery is very beautiful. Olivia Renmei's service is also great. This hotel is really great, and the room hygiene is also very good. It's really a very comfortable experience, and I feel at ease living in it.

msg:When the heat wave hit after getting off the plane, I wished I could jump into the water and swim right away. It was really the wisest decision to stay in a poolside room on the day of landing. Zeng Zujing received us when we checked in. Xiao Zeng was super professional and considerate. He gave us all the benefits we could enjoy, and even won some special benefits for us. Because I brought a two-year-old child with me, I rented a stroller at the hotel when I checked in, and only needed to pay a deposit of 200 yuan. The hotel facilities are not as old as the reviews say, at least the rooms I live in are great, especially the bathroom, which is separated from wet and dry. As a parent-child hotel, the children's play area of over 700 square meters is simply a paradise for children, where they can free their hands. The hotel arranges parent-child projects every day, and you can make an appoin**ent if you want to go. I specially went to experience a seaside buffet dinner. The price of 599 meals for two people is a bit uneconomical, but it is also good to experience various performances and delicacies from various countries. The last thing I hope to improve is the hotel's buffet breakfast. I feel that the quality can be improved a little bit. If friends want to come to Sanya to play, they will definitely recommend this five-star hotel with high cost performance.

Although it is an old hotel, the facilities are quite complete
After looking at the room, I was not satisfied. I told the front desk that I wanted something closer to the sea, so I upgraded the room for free.
The day before check-out, I made a special call to help book a bus to the airport
You can watch the sea and watch the sunrise from the room
There are many types of breakfast. There are many swimming pools in the hotel. It is also close to the beach
a very good experience

msg:Since staying at the Sheraton Haitang Bay for the first time in 2017, I have stayed in Sanya for a few days every year for vacation. Although the equipment and facilities have gradually become old with the years, the first-class service has not changed!
I have stayed here with my child for seven consecutive years, and I will take photos and videos in the same place every year as souvenirs. Watching the child grow up slowly, this is the biggest reward and touch that a hotel has brought to my family besides the service!
For this stay, I would like to thank Xiao Wu at the front desk for his meticulous care and responsive attitude from check-in to check-out! I will look for you again when I come to Sanya next year, I hope your work will go smoothly and you will be promoted soon!
Every time I come, I choose to stay in two or three hotels to experience different Sanya, but the Sheraton is a must-choice hotel every time. The view of the upgraded sea view suite is so beautiful, with a 180-degree unobstructed view of the sea, and even the master bedroom bathroom faces the sea The floor-to-ceiling glass, as well as a children's room and a separate children's bathroom, are awesome👍

msg:First of all, I want to say the first sentence: very satisfied.
The distance between the airport and the Haitang Bay Resort Hotel is very large. It was not until the car arrived at the entrance of the hotel to the lobby that I found the feeling of vacation. The lobby in the front yard of the hotel is very grand, especially the staff who checked in at 3:00 a.m. also arranged in advance After checking in, I know everything and answer all questions, and the service attitude is very professional.
Family members are generally satisfied with the hotel room equipment, but most of the entertainment and entertainment in the hotel are still very satisfactory, especially with children. Among them, the first floor has a children's playground, children's water sports, a small train, feeding and feeding cute pets, etc. The favorite is the bubble party, where the children play for an hour without eating or drinking and are unwilling to leave.
As for adults, you can walk around in the park because the area is very large, and you can also swim. There are many swimming pools! Every pool has a lifeguard!
You can go to the beach in the morning or evening, it is very beautiful, the sea is very blue, and the photos are very good.
In addition, the hotel also has various considerate services such as free luggage delivery, earl travel photography appoin**ent (free 5 photos), free pick-up and drop-off, free airport pick-up, etc., which is worthy of the service of a brand hotel.
Check-out was originally stipulated at 12:00, but the hotel manager Su took the initiative to call to inform that it could be delayed until 2:00, and brought fruit for the children, thank you very much.

It makes people feel very intimate and warm. The hotel is very suitable for parent-child travel. For dining, the noodle restaurant on the first floor is recommended. The seafood noodles are generous, with crab, abalone, small ink fountain, red shellfish and shrimp. Dianping has a discount coupon of 80 for 100, and a bowl of 99 yuan, which is so delicious.

msg:My God, how the travel time is so fast! When I get old, I want to live here, don't travel haha.
I booked the air ticket in a hurry a few days in advance, and started the trip as soon as I said it. In fact, every time I come to Sanya, choosing a hotel is the most troublesome. Because no matter what grade of hotel you will see all kinds of bad reviews. Including the Sheraton, I would also worry about those bad reviews before coming here.
But when I arrived, I felt that every staff member I encountered was so friendly. Why do you say that the service is not good? I don’t think I have encountered it at all.
As an old five-star hotel, the facilities are indeed a bit old, but the room type is very neat, the balcony is large, and the shower head is also quite good, I think I can accept it. And the greenery is really good, with dense coconut groves everywhere.
I think Sheraton is also very suitable for parents and children. My child is over 4 years old and had a great time playing. There is a dedicated children's pool, and many others. There is also Taole Fort for Children. When children are tired from playing on the beach, they can come to blow on the air conditioner and play with wave balls. There are beaches and lawns, I just want to lie down like this for a day.
There are also Sheraton beach toys that can be played casually, which is super convenient for residents. For example, MGM's beach toys are free, but not many. Hilton pays for it.
And the jungle outdoor exploration camp is great. It was the first time I took my child to play such a challenging game. I was very happy that he was so brave and made it to the end by himself.
Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Miki for her seriousness, responsibility and meticulousness. If there are friends coming, I would like to recommend them. Miki is really answering all questions and responding very quickly, thank you so much 🙏

msg:Great value for money resort! When I chose Haitang Bay Hotel, I almost checked all the parent-child hotels on Ctrip! After all, I chose the Sheraton. I was a little nervous when I came from the Ritz-Carlton, but the strong tropical a**osphere of the Sheraton, the lush vegetation, the beach swimming pool, and the great vacation a**osphere captured me! Although I missed the hotel's phone call before check-in, I was very fortunate to meet Justin Zhang at the front desk, who gave me a lot of help and became one of my housekeepers. He and the duty manager on duty made our family experience the warm and professional service of Sheraton. Later, the housekeeper Rose contacted me and also provided 24-hour caring service. Personally, I think whether a hotel stays happy or not has a lot to do with the service. Soft power is sometimes easier to impress people than hardware.
The most cost-effective hotel in this hotel should be the pool room. The room is directly connected to the pool. It is most suitable for the elderly and children! Because the sea view is not outstanding, I strongly recommend his pool house! In addition, I think the wet and dry separation of the bathroom and the design of the cloakroom are more fashionable than the pictures on Ctrip. Looking at Ctrip's picture design is relatively old, it made me hesitate for a long time. It was really a room that was delayed by the pictures. The amazing thing is that the twin room has a bed of 1.35 meters, which is very spacious, and the two beds can be easily joined together to form a king-sized bed. The baby will be happy on it! The sea view room may be regarded as a distant view, not a very magnificent one. The overall facility is a bit old, but the service can make me ignore it. The room service can’t be said to be very high-end, but it takes a simple route and is very a**ospheric. The drinking water and towels are replenished in a timely manner, and the delivery is fast! There are also supervisors who will make ward rounds, and I also met a staff member who seemed to be unable to speak, and was quite enthusiastic. Being willing to hire them is also a manifestation of the hotel's social responsibility, which is good.
There are many swimming pools in the hotel, which are also connected to JW Marriott! The children's swimming pool has a relatively rich slide, and the indoor children's playground looks rich. The hotel is very close to the beach, the wind and waves are a little bit, but it looks like you can ride the waves, but there are many hawkers, not a private beach. Many children's programs and swim ring rentals cost money. Soaking in the swimming pool at the door of the room all day, there is no time to experience other children's projects! The amusement machines in the lobby are a bit worthless! The breakfast is fairly rich, and the taste is not bad in my opinion, but the noodle stalls taste mediocre. There is a 68 food street around, within walking distance, convenient dining, takeaway and HEYTEA! Cute T-shirts for children are also given away!
In short, if you want to stay in a hotel with high cost performance in Haitang Bay, I think Sheraton is definitely the first choice!

The price is also cost-effective, it is really worth the money. Although there were some small episodes in the middle, I have to say that the hotel's response speed to deal with things is really fast. I am very grateful to Olivia_Jiang for her caring care, and several staff members who handled things super fast. Thank you for making us feel valued. There are several paths on the beach outside the hotel that are good for taking pictures. When the weather is good, the pictures are really beautiful. There are also lawns and swimming pools that are nice. I just suggest that the price of swimming rings in the hotel should not be so expensive to rent. Haha, it’s enough to make a point. After all, it’s not a valuable item. In the evening, we also booked the outdoor buffet in Yatri. The ambiance is strong, but the food tastes pretty average. It is suggested that it can be improved, not only looks good, but also tastes delicious haha. The most delicious should belong to the dessert and the creme caramel custard 🍮, and the mushroom cream risotto is also edible. The performance is interesting and the experience is great! Recommended for friends with children, hurry up and book without hesitation!

msg:The Sheraton Haitang Bay Hotel gave us a very good vacation experience. The entire hotel environment is full of tropical style and the environment is very beautiful. There are many swimming pools for you to choose from, as well as several children's pools, and you can go directly to the beach from the hotel. We like it very much. From the moment we checked into the hotel, Alana sun received us from various aspects and introduced us to the hotel's special projects, the food in the restaurant, and the surrounding places to visit and eat. During the stay, we often asked about our needs, presented exquisite fruits, and helped me Solved a lot of problems, very caring~ The children also participated in many fun projects in the hotel, such as feeding small animals, fishing, making cakes, picking coconuts, bubble shows, etc. The room next to the swimming pool is also very colorful It meets the requirements of the children. You can go to the swimming pool directly from the room. The children are very happy to play in the water. The other staff of the hotel were also very polite. They greeted each other proactively when meeting each other, and quickly delivered supplies if needed, including children's toiletries. Vacationing here is very pleasant. The food in the restaurant is also delicious. My kids like beef burgers very much. I recommend it! Sheraton is worthy of being a well-established resort hotel. I will come here again if I have the opportunity to come to Sanya in the future

The children's playground and water park are very big and great, and there are different themed activities every day. Children like it very much and can play every day.
        To be honest, the breakfast is very ordinary, and the dishes are not very rich. It feels a bit unworthy of this old international brand. The two big and one small set meals I bought are generally more cost-effective, but the noodle restaurant service staff is generally not enthusiastic, and the actual dishes are not as rich as the menu and description.
        In terms of service, the housekeeping depar**ent, concierge depar**ent and recreation center are pretty good, especially Elsa Peng, who is very enthusiastic. Suggestions were made about the wet and slippery bathroom, anti-slip measures were immediately implemented, and gifts were also given.

msg:This time I brought my children to stay for two days, and the overall experience was mediocre. First of all, let's talk about the service. The waiters feel very stiff and expressionless, and they don't realize the standard that a five-star hotel should have. The second is the constant temperature swimming pool. The hotel obviously has a constant temperature swimming pool, but it is not open, and there is no reminder on the reservation interface. As a result, we just encountered a drop in temperature in the past, and the children were completely unable to enter the water. I asked the hotel to coordinate to open the heated swimming pool, but also refused. This disappoints me. The third is the hotel's beach, where a few deck chairs are placed symbolically, without even an umbrella. It can be said to be very crude. The fourth is parent-child activities. Every afternoon, the staff who took us to pick up shells and catch crabs disappeared halfway, and he disappeared while we were playing, which is ridiculous. Fifth, there are basically no children under the age of three in the children's playground, which is not suitable for children. Moreover, the handwork next to it should be charged, and it is not cheap. This makes a very bad impression. I feel like I need money for everything.
Well, finally, let’s talk about the good experience. The breakfast buffet and dinner buffet in the evening were ok. The children especially like the entertainment show for dinner. We ate the buffet for two nights, and they were all pretty good. In addition, the little rabbits, lambs, peacocks, fish and ducks in the hotel are very popular with children, and the animal feeding activities in the morning are also very good. Hope to keep it up.

Children's facilities: I recommend children to play in the swimming pool. It's so fun. Of course, the paragliding at the Mangrove Hotel next door is also worth trying.

Check in near 3 o'clock, and told me that I can't move in at 3 o'clock. If I live in a room next to the lobby, I can check in immediately, but it may be noisy. Of course I couldn't agree, and then told me to upgrade you to sea view room 4071. This room number is very strange. The most important thing is that you have to walk a long way, and there are no other elevator options in the middle. Then tell me how other rooms might have to wait until Wen point. I told him directly: I won't tell you anymore, I went to Ctrip, and the guy said you wait for me to take a look, and then told me that there is a 3060. After checking in, I realized that not only the facilities are old, but the service is also extremely poor. I stayed for four consecutive days, and I had to call every day to clean up the room, and it was not cleaned until five or six o'clock. Disposable slippers are not provided, and there are no non-slip mats. Breakfast is like a farmers' market. The waiters are chatting together, and the voice is very loud. No one cleans up the tableware. There is an old man sweeping the floor with a broom during the meal. On the day I left the store, I called to ask for a luggage cart, but it didn’t arrive for a long time. I went to the lobby and asked for it, so I didn’t know. ...Stop talking, there will be no next time!

When you arrive at the hotel, you can directly show your ID card to check in, which reduces the waiting time for check-in. Jenny also sent welcome fruit to our room. The hotel's food and beverages are also delicious.

msg:The Sheraton Hotel in Haitang Bay is the first luxury family resort hotel to settle in Haitang Bay. It occupies an undisputed area. The yard is very large. You can walk directly to the beach in 2 minutes. It is very convenient. There are many swimming pools and children's playgrounds in the yard. The room configuration is okay, the service is very good and almost responsive, and there is a dedicated butler who can provide help at any time. During the period, we ordered iodine bandages and mosquito repellent water, and they were delivered directly to the room. Here, we would like to praise our butler Lisa. The three-night experience was very good. There are many restaurants and duty-free shops nearby. The overall feeling is very relaxing. It is worth recommending!

The waiting time in the long queue was a bit long, but the staff's service attitude was very patient. There was tea in the lobby and special dishes. Performing can relieve your mood
We live on the first floor, which is a bit far from the lobby. Haha, the battery car can be delivered to the room. This service is very good.
The butler service Rose is very good. She called in advance and asked about her needs. She also added WeChat to provide warm reminders every day and was able to answer any questions she asked. It was very considerate.
I would like to praise the customer service staff who did the cleaning: they helped clean the dehumidifier water tank promptly when it was full. I happened to have the opportunity to witness them cleaning the bathroom with my own eyes. They wiped it carefully and did not miss every small gap. All the staff I met in the hotel were polite. , greeting with a polite smile
The hotel has a good environment and is close to the beach. There are many green trees and swimming pools. There are many public paddling pools for children. The swimming pool room we stayed in allows us to swim without going out, which is very convenient.
The transportation is also very convenient. It is next to Atlantis Water World and not far from Wuzhizhou Island.
It's a bit regretful that we didn't book the Yatri buffet dinner in advance and didn't have it that day, which was a pity. In short, the hotel is still good and worth recommending.

msg:Hotels in Sanya are really too expensive for Chinese New Year. In all fairness, the Sheraton in Sanya is not bad at this price! The new price ratio is very high. I checked in at night, although I was a little disappointed when I saw the atrium... the design is indeed a bit old... but I am still very happy for the rest of the stay!

Because of running, I accidentally discovered that the running and walking routes of Sheraton are actually much better than other hotels. The trestle bridge is also very good. I ran across the sea stalls until I passed JW Marriott. In fact, the small garden of Sheraton is more wild and natural, and there are more plants. It is more beautiful, and the artificial traces are not so obvious.

Sheraton’s price-to-value ratio leads to a lot of families, most of them are multi-child families. I was worried that it would be very noisy... The hotel housekeeper, John, arranged for me a room near the end. Although we have to go a little farther, it is more private and quieter for us to stay longer. important.

When I first checked in, the room was very close to the elevator, and when the elevator arrived at the station in the middle of the night, the bell ding-dong was very loud, so I sent John a WeChat message to help me solve it. Although I didn't report much hope...John replied to solve it immediately, but I didn't expect to hear the arrival bell after 5 minutes! I have been staying for five days and can dream until dawn every day. Before check-in, John also called us very considerately to ask us what time to check in. Avoid delays for other guests to wait for the room. The service is still very good. Although it is not like a hotel in Thailand, even the service staff passing by will smile and say morning, but I am still very satisfied after not going out for three years. In a word, the letter price is at home! ! Suitable for long stay.

The aunt who cleans the room is also very considerate and always asks if I want more toiletries. I was distressed when I lost my slippers. When I turned around, I found that the hotel had a pair of splint slippers... and the quality was really good! ! so happy
The breakfast is also very rich. Although there are many people and many children, the waiters are very dedicated. It's really hard work...
There are many items suitable for children to play here, such as small animals, small trains, and go-karts. When children have fun, there will be a lot less crying. Even if there are no children, it is very comfortable to see. The hotel is also big enough not to be disturbed by too many children.
The gym is a bit small, but the service facilities are complete, and the outdoor scenery is average. We look forward to future renovations. It would be great if the yoga room could see the sea or be surrounded by vegetation.

I would like to praise the hotel manager Olivia. I contacted the hotel in advance before arriving at the hotel. I arranged a room in the morning and waited for check-in. She is very considerate. I like it.
The breakfast is good and meets the standard for this price. The accommodation is full during the peak season, and breakfast will inevitably be the same as going to the market.
The barbecue buffet is not exciting... There are not many things, there are too many people, and the taste is average. It is still a bit cold to eat at night in winter.
The parking lot is tight.
The Children's Paradise is good. It is especially recommended to watch the clown show or magic show at noon. The foreign brothers work very hard, the children like it very much, and the interaction is good.
There are several pets that can be fed at the entrance of the paradise, and there are rabbits, Sanyang and tortoises, which children like. You can ask for a few bags of vegetables at breakfast, and the hotel will prepare them in advance.

If you don’t want to spend more money and still want value-added services, please avoid it.

msg:Overall evaluation: Based on many years of travel experience, the infrastructure is old, and other basic services are not up to the price level except for breakfast Chinese and Western restaurant services. Only 3 points are given, and it is not recommended to stay in the short term.
We stayed for two days and one night, and it was embarrassing: the access control room card was locked 4 times, the water in the constant temperature swimming pool was cloudy with sand, the switchboard and a small number of room attendants asked three questions, etc., which made my experience feel instantly reduced. I spent money to enjoy it, but the result Encountered a bunch of strange things.
Of course, I can give back three points, and there are still 4 colleagues worthy of praise: 1. On January 5, the night shift manager (Ms. Wang) tried to help me allocate and upgrade the room type at 10 o'clock in the evening to improve the check-in experience.
2. On January 6, the female supervisor (wearing a black suit) at the entrance of the Chinese and Western breakfast restaurant station sent me into the restaurant and learned that the room card could not be opened many times. She immediately coordinated with the front desk to come down to the restaurant and go upstairs to change the card for me, and waited for me. I went to get my meal, saw me coming, and then helped me pass the meal to the seat. After eating for a while, I found that there was no hot milk, and arranged for the staff to replenish it immediately. The three restaurant employees, and many unknown ones, all have motors on their feet, and they are busy everywhere, busy but not chaotic. The dishes are rich and delicious, and the kitchen masters have used their brains.
3. On January 6, the elder brother of the Chinese and Western breakfast waiter (named Yangming) saw that the mask had fallen off and sent a box over, and then saw that I wanted to sit down after eating, and said how about bringing me a cup of coffee, and please treat me if I am tired I sat down at the clean table next to me, and gave me clear directions if I wanted to go to the pool with a sun umbrella.
4. When I ate the buffet in this hotel, I felt the enthusiasm and warmth of the service. This is from the heart. The omelet master is a young man who omelets more than 300 eggs a day, and he is super nice. I proposed fried sun eggs. He was very impatient while waiting for the fried eggs. He was worried that the guests would wait for a long time, and he verbally explained the preparation process, asked the guests how cooked they were, and was afraid that the guests would wait for a long time later. It is really rare for a young guy to pay attention to the needs of the booth customers while satisfying his personality (half-cooked, fully-cooked).
In addition, some landscape selfies are quite beautiful, as shown in the picture.
In the end, I spent 1 hour shopping at the duty-free shop and wrote a letter of advice to GM at the front desk (caused to miss the high-speed rail, and changed from Yalong Bay Station to Sanya Station to take the high-speed rail into the sea), hoping to improve the infrastructure as soon as possible. Rate matching service.

It may be that Karry, the customer service, added WeChat in advance. It’s very good. He told me in advance that there are many children’s programs. The hotel facilities are a bit old, but the service is still very good. The waiters everywhere are very warm
The hot water was a little slow at night. The next day the temperature was a little low at 25 degrees. In the morning, there was no sun. My daughter liked it very much. My 11-year-old son found it boring. He played table football outside and was very happy. There are many children’s entertainment items that need to be advanced. Make an appoin**ent but with children :-( It's hard to be on time, so we just go wherever we want, and we also feed the animals and pick coconuts in the morning. We are super happy, big and small are playing crazy in the outdoor constant temperature swimming pool. It would be better if the water park is also constant temperature. It is a pity that the water slide cannot be played because of the low temperature.
In the evening, I just caught up with the seaside seafood hot pot buffet. I put all my coats on the beach with the sea breeze blowing. The storm in Haitang Bay is too big. Haha the kids love this show so much this dinner is great value
The sun came out the next morning and it was warmer than yesterday. Hurry up and buy a shovel and go to the beach to play with the sand and beach motorcycles. It costs 200 for a 20-minute trip. It’s also quite fun, but I don’t feel safe. I was planning to go to Atlantis in the afternoon. I heard that it’s not a constant temperature group. The people in the village said that they were shivering, so they changed to Nantian Hot Springs. It’s so funny to come to Sanya to soak in hot springs😅
On the morning of the third day, I went to the duty-free shop to buy, buy, buy, and put my luggage at the front desk. Ctrip had a good service to send my luggage to the next hotel, but I gave up when I arrived at 6 pm. Fortunately, I took a taxi from the duty-free shop to the Sheraton in the afternoon to pick up my luggage. I went to the second hotel and arrived at 4:00 and caught up with the bubble bath in the next hotel. Karry at the concierge was super nice. I called in advance on the taxi and asked him to help me take out my luggage and move directly to the taxi. What a service. Great. Aaron Seafood went out in the middle and ate delicious seafood.

Thanks to Huang Xueli of the restaurant and Mr. Weng Yongqiang, the supervisor, for providing a good dining experience, especially the Chris**as light-up buffet dinner, which was the best meal during my stay in Sanya.
Haitang Bay, where the hotel is located, has too many winds and waves, so the beach activities are basically just walking around. I took a 20-minute ATV ride for 200 yuan, and I felt nervous that it could overturn at any time. There is no experience in horseback riding on the beach. Of course, these two projects are not hotel projects and are wild projects.
As far as parents and children are concerned, Sheraton's activity content is still weaker than that of MGM and Yanlord. The jungle adventure is more unique, but there are so many mosquitoes, so be sure to be prepared to repellent excessive amounts of mosquitoes. It costs 38 yuan for a trip (I later found out that it was included in the room package I ordered, but I thought about it and let it go). Due to the epidemic, the scene is basically My daughter was alone and enjoyed a one-to-one special service.
The constant-temperature pool next to the children's pool is indispensable in Sanya in December. The non- constant-temperature pool is too cold to recommend.
If you have the opportunity to catch the hotel's S show, I recommend you to watch it, it's worth paying for.
Finally, there are a few outdoor towel spots.

The view of the room arranged at the beginning was a little dissatisfied. I found Morgan, the lobby manager, to solve it immediately with great efficiency. In Haitang Bay, it is really the king of cost performance. The room is newer than expected and not as old as it is said, and the view from the room is invincible. The garden is also very tidy. The bedding was comfortable and spotlessly clean. I especially like the wet and dry separation design of the hotel toilet. Breakfast is also good. Morgan actively helped us solve all the problems during check-in and check-out, and the response was very fast. Thank you very much, and I will stay again.

The swimming pool room was either kept at a constant temperature for several months or was useless. Breakfast is very ordinary, nothing delicious or special. The lounge chairs in the public swimming pool were dirty. Customer service and WeChat responses are very timely, and basic problems can be solved quickly. No big deal.

msg:First of all, mik upgraded the sea view king bed room, thank you very much. The hotel is very quiet and there are not many people.
Secondly, I would like to talk about the facilities in person. I think it is very complete, and there are many activities.
Children are a playground every day, feeding rabbits, peacocks, ducks, fish, and playing in the water on the beach. However, I feel that the wind on the beach is a bit strong, and the waves are bigger than those in the East China Sea. The housekeeper, Mik, also responds at any time. He is beautiful and dedicated.
All in all, I had a great time living and having fun.

The hotel is generally relatively new and the service is very good. The butler, Karry, is very enthusiastic to help you with any questions from morning to night. There are many parent-child experience programs in the hotel. Feeding small animals is very popular among children. There are adults and children in the swimming pool. Not many rooms are big and you can see the sea in the distance
By the way, the hotel also has a carpool pick-up service. It’s just opposite Gate 5 of the airport. The bus departs in half an hour. You can also send your luggage after you leave the hotel. It’s much easier to arrange the itinerary.

msg:I checked in at the Sheraton Sanya Haitang Bay Resort when the epidemic was not busy. Before I came, I was particularly worried about the poor service and my own check-in experience due to the lack of staff in the hotel due to the epidemic. I will definitely choose this hotel again. Next, I will talk about my check-in experience
Accommodation: Before I checked in, Vivian contacted me in advance to help me arrange the room and introduced Sanya's epidemic prevention policy. I was really touched. When I arrived at the hotel, there was a warm concierge brother who helped me as soon as I arrived at the hotel I took my luggage and sent it to the check-in counter. Unfortunately, I can’t remember the name. A lady named Luo at the front desk helped me check in. When I checked in, she explained the hotel’s facilities and equipment in detail. She is a very nice person. very kind
Environmental hygiene: The hotel rooms are decorated in a very traditional style, but they are really clean. The quilt feels warm and sunny, and the mood will really become super good. Moreover, the electricity card is placed in the room in advance, which is really good. convenient
Facilities and equipment: In the afternoon, go out and visit the hotel park, the first-class sea view, the sea breeze and the beach, the leisurely afternoon, blowing the sea breeze, drinking iced drinks, is simply a great enjoyment in life
Entertainment: The hotel has a lot of children's entertainment facilities and equipment. After asking, this hotel focuses on personal activities. If you are interested, you can refer to the following
Catering: This hotel is in the same family as the JW Marriott next door. You can share all the food and beverages. Unfortunately, I didn’t catch up with their buffet dinner this time. I heard that there is an S show for dinner, which is an acrobatic performance. I am looking forward to it, and it is also a regret this time. I really hope that I can encounter this performance when I come back next time. The types of breakfast and the service are very good.
Service: In the end, it is more worthy of a strong five-star service. I am about to check out. Because of the itinerary, Ms. Olivia helped me to do a late check-out. Finally, when I checked out, I met the guest manager Delia'. My check-in experience, and arranged for the concierge brother to help me send my luggage to the parking lot
I really hope that the next vacation can come as soon as possible to escape the city. It is a very considerate journey. When you come to Haitang Bay, you must sign in to the hotel. Like it

The hotel room is a bit old, but the parent-child paradise and the performances inside are very popular with children, and they had a lot of fun! You can also feed small animals~ The hotel is very big. It takes a while to walk from the hotel to the beach every day. There are no deck chairs on the beach. I don’t know if it’s because they are getting old and they need new ones, but it doesn’t affect the children’s fun of digging at all~
I have already recommended friends with babies in Moments to stay here~

The result was astonishingly unexpected!
Let me talk about the hotel facilities first: the room is very comfortable to live in, and the baby's bathrobe and slippers are all available. The sea view from the big balcony is super cool!
Supporting facilities: There are multiple swimming pools, one with a constant temperature is great, and there are bubble activities in the afternoon, which is suitable for children. There is also a children's pool with slides. You can stroll down to the beach in the hotel. The beach is so beautiful! ! !
The child picked up a lot of small shells~
Meals: The hotel breakfast is rich and delicious. We go to the Chinese restaurant every day, there are children's meals, and the other dishes are also very good!
Finally, be sure to give a good thumbs up to the hotel's service and lovely Olivia! Olivia added WeChat when we entered the store, which is a 24-hour considerate service. The introduction of hotel services is very clear. If I have any questions or difficulties, I can call on WeChat as soon as possible, and there will be a response. Traveling with children is a lot of work. Even disturbing Olivia at night is also a timely reply, help coordinate!
It's so sweet! ! The next time I come to Hainan, it will be the Sheraton Haitang Bay! It is also super close to the Duty Free City!

The hotel called in advance and added WeChat, and the room was arranged according to our needs. Special thanks to Maria for the careful arrangement. If there was a problem with the room in the middle, he helped us to change the room in time. The room cleaning found that the children's clothes were left behind and also helped us deliver them. To the new room, I feel that the overall service of the hotel is still very good

Facilities: The hotel has a children's playground, a zoo, and it is interesting to spend money to do a mud painting; there is a water park in the children's swimming pool, and there is a bubble party at three o'clock. 🫧, the children are very happy; there are toilets and bathtubs for children; the disadvantage is that the hardware in the room is relatively old, the door is very difficult to close, and the background light is really ugly, and the left and right partitions of the bathroom are a bit inconvenient

Hygiene: The layout of this room may not be easy to clean. I feel that these holes at the head of the bed are dust collectors. When I was helping the children to find toys, I removed the bedside table, and the back was full of dirt and hair.

Breakfast: Except for flies (I really recommend preparing an electric mosquito swatter), the breakfast content is still very satisfactory, the variety is rich and the taste is delicious, there is a fly in the ointment, the marinade is not served with beef ****y

The hotel's facilities are also very complete. It only takes 5 minutes to walk to the beach. The hotel's own swimming pool is also very beautiful. Unfortunately, I was in a hurry this time, so I didn't get into the water. Looking out from the rooftop viewing point, the sea water under the blue sky is flooded. With a little bit of light, walking by the swimming pool under the nearby palm trees, it seems that the fatigue of the journey is driven away at once, and the bursts of comfort make people want to stop.

msg:2 points is given to the Marriott duty manager at check-out, and it is still in place to solve the error problem of the hotel itself. I chose Sheraton this time because I wanted to experience the seaside buffet, but it turned out that the quarantine hotel has closed the buffet, of course it cannot provide it (in fact, I am curious about this, why can I still order it when it is closed, just to help Marriott find guests?). Although I can only change to Marriott to stay, it seems to be an upgrade, but the strange thing is that the sense of sanitation in this hotel is slowly degraded. There are flies everywhere in the hotel, and the rooms and after a few meals are flying everywhere. Diarrhea is inevitably suspected to be a hygiene problem, see the photos for details. In addition, don't think that changing to Marriott is an upgrade. The purpose of people's choice is the overall service, not the room is bigger and the sanitation is poor and many trea**ents are forced to change. If Marriott does not change its hygiene, how many guests will inevitably worry about their health. In addition, this is the second five-star hotel I experienced during my trip to Sanya. It is very different from the previous one. In the previous one, every service staff was very enthusiastic and would take the initiative to say hello. This hotel is very rare. Sheraton was transferred over, so it was treated specially, otherwise such a jw Marriott would be too embarrassed to say that it is more high-end than Sheraton? The epidemic tourism industry is not easy, but it must be done well. Expect changes.

We said we should go out and have breakfast, but we came back with a room card. It was broken again. I called the front desk and hung up before I finished talking. The aunt who cleaned the room said she didn’t have permission to open the door and waited for half an hour to open the door. Then it’s a joke that I booked this room. Looking for the manager of Datang, he said he was not there, so the front desk gave me two Estee Lauder face creams. I was really anxious and didn't want to talk to her, so I checked out, but I was so angry. The room price is 2390 per night, this is What kind of experience, a star hotel, this is, so angry

The hotel is not old, the room size is large, the sanitary conditions are good, the breakfast is rich, there are many people, and the buffet dinner is also good. There are many parent-child activities in the hotel and swimming is convenient, but the nearby seafood street and 68 food court are more expensive, and a meal is basically 600-1000 yuan. It is a few minutes drive from the International Duty Free City. It is recommended to go to the second floor of the second phase of the Duty Free City for dinner. There are many restaurants to choose from, and the price is about 200-500. Taxi from Phoenix Airport to the hotel is less than 150 meters. The hotel service is also good, the overall feeling is satisfied, and I will choose Sheraton in the future.

There are many restaurants in it, and Xitang is recommended. Go out the hotel and turn right 600 meters is Atlantis, and 300 meters ahead is the duty-free shop. There are many seafood stalls on Fengtang Road opposite the duty-free shop. The prices are a bit more expensive than those in downtown Sanya. I recommend Lin Jie's seafood. The taste and service are very good. There are 5 swimming pools in the Sheraton Haitang Bay. If you live in the pool room on the first floor, you can directly enter the swimming pool from the balcony. Across the swimming pool and coconut groves is the beach by the sea. The hotel breakfast is average, you can eat enough, but the seats are not enough. If you come after 8:30, you usually need to queue up to enter the restaurant. The hotel room is relatively spacious, there is a large balcony to dry clothes or rest, and the central air conditioner makes little noise. The service staff of the hotel can take the initiative to say hello when they meet. It is recommended to bring a baby to stay.

But I still want to leave a negative review because, 1. I checked in at 1:30 on the day I checked in at Sheraton Haitang Bay, but the cleanliness was not cleaned up. After checking out, I couldn’t stay. I didn’t check in until 4:30. After communicating with the front desk again and again, I didn’t check in until after 5 o’clock. 2. After checking out the next day, I went directly to Howard Johnson Sanya Bay Guoguang Hotel, but in Guoguang The most speechless thing when checking in at Howard Johnson was that because Sheraton Haitang Bay Hotel did not have check-in and check-out identification information, it was impossible to check in at Howard Johnson Guoguang because the same person could not check into two hotels at the same time. No one answered the phone at the Haitang Bay Sheraton. I called 12345 or 12315 and was told that the Haitang Bay Sheraton would not admit to staying at the hotel. Finally, after complaining and communicating at the same time, I was able to check into the Guoguang Howard Johnson Hotel through identity information authentication at almost 7 p.m. Among the problems, I have to say that I was very angry during my stay this time and the experience was very poor. Please choose carefully.

Seafood BBQ buffet dinner at 2 large and 2 small Asian Crest Seaside Restaurant,
The jungle outdoor exploration camp, breakfast and travel photography, etc., 2100 yuan / night, the price is OK. The room is big enough and comfortable, there are many swimming pools, and the travel photography is also good; but there are a few shortcomings: 1. The check-in time is too long. It took nearly an hour from waiting to my check-in, and there were no people in line behind me. I was impatient; 2. When I checked in, I told the front desk to help make reservations for self-catering meals at night, but when I arrived, the waiter said that there was no reservation, and then let us go in to eat; 3. I reserved a hotel car one day in advance to go to the airport in the afternoon , but said that it was full, so I had to take a taxi by myself! This is the service provided by the hotel, why can't it be equipped with enough vehicles? I was also very angry that I had to pay for a taxi by myself 😤. Of course, the facilities and equipment in the hotel are more suitable for parent-child activities with relatively small children. I feel that it is not suitable for me to bring a junior high school student. The sea in the hotel is not allowed to swim. I heard that although it looks a little flat, there is a big gap in the middle. If it floats out, it cannot be saved! Also, the deluxe sea view room is very nice to watch the sunrise.

Price: It is cheap in the Haitang Bay area, so I booked it for three nights.
Facilities: The hotel facilities are old, it looks like a decades-old hotel, the TV remote control is not easy to use, the switches of individual lights are broken, the lights can't be controlled at all, the elevator is particularly bad, etc. There is obviously no one, but it is A long, long wait. It is indeed an old hotel, and the facilities are immeasurable with the newly opened.
Environmental sanitation: The hotel's garden environment is not bad, the layout is reasonable, there are many swimming pools, there are adults and children, the room sanitation is also OK, the little brother who cleans the room has a good attitude and enthusiasm.
Service: I hardly felt any service. After check-in, no one in the concierge helped with luggage. We, the old and the young, took our luggage and waited for the elevator to the second floor, but found that the staff pointed the wrong way. We couldn't get to our room at all, and we had to wait for the elevator to return to the lobby. At this time, a staff member in charge helped us relocate the large and small bags to the lobby, and arranged for someone to help us deliver the luggage to the room, otherwise we would have to Tired and sweaty. The hotel's children's playground is relatively old, and the children will not play for a while. There are no parent-child activities. When it was hot at noon, I was watching TV with the air conditioner in the room. No one told us what activities were in the hotel.
Breakfast: The breakfast is average, the overall feeling is not very delicious, not as delicious as the Shangri-La next door. And there was no one to guide them. When there were many people, they would go inside to grab a seat by themselves, and whoever occupied it would count.

The standard infinity swimming pool, room swimming pool, and leisure pool in the area are diverse and distinctive. The breakfast is varied and delicious. Especially the family seafood package A in the Chinese restaurant is only 398 and enjoys the standard of 598. It is just right for friends and family to eat together with our family. It's a great value, can't help but book the B package again, it is worth recommending. The hotel has its own beach, facing Wuzhizhou Island. The sea and sky are very beautiful. Looking at the Atlantis hotel group on the left and the mangrove hotel group on the right in the upper corridor of the hotel, it is really the best place to punch in and take pictures. The hotel's children's playground is very big. Children have a good time, and there is a bunny parrot near the original. Thank you Molly and Hilton for a great weekend.

msg:The price increase in summer is too great. The 1500-a-night Sheraton is relatively cheap among the five stars in Haitang Bay.
Advantages: 1. The bed in the twin room is 1.35, which is very suitable for older children (12 years old). Parents can sleep more comfortably. The double bed in many hotels is 1.2, which is too small.
2. Children's buffet breakfast and dinner are free, surcharge for children over 12 years old, which is more relaxed than the standard of many hotels. But pay attention, when I checked in, the receptionist insisted that breakfast is half price for 12-year-olds. I said that the package I ordered made it clear that under 12 years old included 12 years old, and no breakfast was accepted. She insisted on receiving it, and finally I found out the order. Just show her and say that.
3. The overall environment is good. There are four large and small swimming pools. Children soak in them every day. There is a private beach behind the hotel. It is very convenient to walk there.
shortcoming:
1. The most unacceptable thing is the service. The one with the most kind attitude is the cleaning lady who I meet in the corridor every day. The front desk of the check-in said that, the second time I asked about the late check-out, because I am a Marriott Gold Card, yes This benefit can be delayed until 2 o'clock. I understand that I can withdraw at 2 o'clock no matter what the situation is. After all, the check-in time they wrote is 3 o'clock, and there will be an hour left for cleaning, but they keep telling me that it is not possible, and it depends on the day. Room status, what is the use of gold card membership?
2. The buffet breakfast and buffet dinner are really too ordinary. The buffet dinner at 428 will cost nearly 300 per person after using various discounts. Look at my picture. These are the types of seafood, and the rest are all pork and chicken. One, it's not even a little bit
3. What about the good butler service? From arriving in Sanya to leaving, no housekeeper has contacted me. All needs are called by myself and I go to the front desk to ask. Compared with the mangrove forest in Sanya Bay the previous two nights, the housekeeper there is like an angel's service (but the hotel is average , it's really old)

First of all, the location is very good. It is almost in the middle of the Haitang Bay Hotel. It is only a few hundred meters away from the Grand Hyatt, Haitang 68, the dining street, and only three or four kilometers away from the duty-free city.
Secondly, the hotel as a whole feels good. Especially sitting on the balcony and looking at it at a glance, it is full of dense coconut trees. This density of trees is rare among hotels in Haitang Bay. Moreover, it shares the area with Marriott, the original Luxury Collection Hotel, forming a garden effect of 1+1 greater than 2. It's not too far to walk to the beach, and its beach location is not bad in Haitang Bay.
In addition, the room is big enough, the swimming pool is big enough (some pools have sunshades), the breakfast quality is good, and the cost performance is also very good, making this a very good choice for staying in Haitang Bay.

msg:The wife is very satisfied, much more than expected. Because it is a platinum card, an upgrade to a deluxe sea view room was arranged before check-in, and then the housekeeper Tina added WeChat in advance to introduce the hotel's facilities and children's activities in detail. There are a lot of activities, you don't have to leave the hotel, just soak in the swimming pool and participate in activities. The package includes a buffet dinner and a free S show, among which the fire art performance is particularly exciting. The Chinese set meal was also very delicious. Tina also arranged for us to have breakfast in the Chinese restaurant every day, without crowding people, and it felt very good. The service staff of the Chinese restaurant are also very good and have a good attitude. Definitely a recommended family hotel

It is 10,000 times better than the Westin next door. The room is also large, and there will be no musty smell. The clothes are very convenient, and the housekeeper Tina is also very good, helping me introduce the strategy of duty-free shops and get various coupons. Because we are still buying and buying, he helped us to do a late check-out. Next time will give priority to Sheraton and Conifer Hotel

Before checking in, it was mentioned that the children would have a birthday, and the housekeeper specially helped us decorate the room and even gave us a birthday cake from the hotel. The birthday dinner was booked in advance through the housekeeper, and we were also kindly reminded that we could use the coupon. Because I accidentally sprained my foot while surfing, I stayed there for a few days temporarily. The housekeeper kindly helped me to add a low bed for free, which was convenient for me to get in and out of bed, and changed the room in time and arranged a wheelchair. Any request I make is basically on call. Meet the best service hotel butler service.

msg:Because of some negative reviews on the Internet, I came to Sheraton with an uneasy mood. In fact, it was completely unnecessary. After all, it is an international five-star, and all aspects are still in place; before check-in, the housekeeper Molly contacted and added WeChat and arranged the room; When I got off the bus, the waiter in the lobby greeted me warmly to help with my luggage. The room was very clean, the scenery was pleasant, and the service staff was well-behaved and polite. The buffet dinner by the sea had a good a**osphere and rich dishes. Although the decoration of the room was a few years old, it was really nothing. Influence, there are many swimming pools and forests, and it is also very close to the Marriott next door. The housekeeper Molly is very responsible and caring. It is very close to the beach. In addition, the traffic to the duty-free shop is not very good. In fact, the commuter car is the duty-free shop to pick up customers from various hotels, and the driver is not very friendly. I also have a little suggestion: some electric fans should be added to the lobby during the day, and the security at the gate should be strengthened. Training, poor attitude, suspected of deliberately making things difficult.

msg:I have been to Sanya 6 times, this time I booked this hotel in order to be closer to the duty-free city, but this is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in in Sanya, the room is quite big but the facilities are very poor, like the kind of hundred Many hotels have the same configuration. Toiletries are very poor. There are very few sockets in the whole room. We couldn&#39;t find a place to charge and finally we had to charge our mobile phones in the bathroom. As a result, nothing was charged the next day. Because the sockets are too bad and not connected well, there are no sockets on the balcony, the air conditioner is very old-fashioned, it was very noisy after running it all night, and I didn&#39;t sleep well. I have never slept well in Sanya. This is the first time that there is no automatic vending machine in the whole hotel. There is no place to sell water in the machine or canteen, only the bar sells drinks and beverages. A bottle of mineral water is 10 yuan. There are only 2 free bottles of mineral water in the room. It is possible to reduce one portion or one portion. The quality is already very poor, and I am speechless. Even the old-fashioned resort hotels in Sanya Bay have better things than this hotel! Will never go back, the name sounds good but it&#39;s a rubbish hotel! ! To sum up, it is a very poor hotel! Let’s review the buffet breakfast again. The food seems to be of poor quality and insincere. The butter is not individually packaged one by one. It is a whole bucket of cheap goods. The feeling of starch thickening, other people&#39;s jam is 98% jam, 2% additives, but the jam here is 98% additives, 2% jam, I really can&#39;t eat it, the hot milk is made of milk powder, and the soy milk is made of soy milk powder. Yes, let&#39;s have a porridge, but the side dishes and peanuts are still damp and not tasty. In short, it&#39;s super rubbish. It can be seen from all places that this hotel is cheap to buy things, and it doesn&#39;t pay attention to quality at all. It feels like a fast hotel. No holiday quality to speak of.

Although it is an old hotel, the facilities and equipment are a little bit worse, but the price is very high, and the hygiene is relatively clean. Due to the epidemic, there are not many people in the hotel, which is very clean and relatively safe. The children's playground here is quite large, and the water in the children's swimming pool is very shallow. The 14-month-old baby can stand and play in the water. The food in Caiyuexuan restaurant is also good. Yes, Qingbuliang is delicious but sweet. Dongyang goat and mustard shrimp balls are also good. The hotel is very close to duty-free shops and food streets. The hotel service is also very good. The room is far from the hotel lobby and there will be a battery car to help pick up and drop off. There is a special housekeeper service (I must praise my housekeeper Tina and the porter Peter), the service is thoughtful and meticulous! Because it was inconvenient to bring children, I helped pick up the courier several times. Later, I changed to the swimming pool room and helped to carry too much luggage. It was hard work~ Next time I take the children out to play, I will stay for a few more days~

Who knows that the ladies at the front desk are amazing!! Although they are wearing masks, they feel that they are sweet and cute! Seeing that we have two children, the lady at the front desk also interacted with the babies, which made the two little guys very happy. The ladies at the front desk also specially arranged slippers and bathrobes for the children, which are so attentive! If there are more babies, there will be more luggage. The lady at the front desk also arranged for the concierge to help us with the luggage. The decoration of the room is relatively simple, and it feels very transparent and bright. From the room, you can see the blue sky and white clouds, the flowers and plants of the hotel, and the blue sea. It is so beautiful and absolutely relaxing. Here we have to say that the lady at the front desk provided us with a free upgrade, which made us feel so good. The hotel as a whole can be seen some years, but the environment is really good! And the service of the lady at the front desk is really, really, really, the best in all Marriott hotels I have ever stayed in! I hope you all work well and be happy every day.

Describe in several aspects
1. Accommodation: The hotel helped upgrade it to a parent-child suite, which has a large space and a marine theme. Children have a good time in the room, and adults also have their own space; the invincible sea view is my favorite, and I can watch the sea from the balcony when I have time. Children's favorites are the swimming pool and the invincible sandy beach. When the sun is too high or it rains, the children go to the free indoor children's playground, so that we only went to Wuzhizhou Island (just opposite the hotel) and the aquarium next door (motorcycle riding, a few minutes) for 5 days and 4 nights Get it done), the rest of the time is spent playing with the children in sand and water
2. Service: The service is in place. If you have any questions, you just need to report to the hotel and they will deal with it immediately. The free pick-up and drop-off service at the airport will save you a lot of worry. There is also Ronaldinho's à la carte service, travel advice, nucleic acid inspection, bus reservations, and dining suggestions can all be done by just asking Ronaldinho (I really appreciate Ronaldinho's help for this trip).
3. Food: The hotel provides free breakfast, which is rich in categories and choices. The tastes of adults and children can be satisfied, and you can eat very well. Lunch and dinner are mainly to order takeout or go to the food street next door when you have time.

There are very few tourists in Haitang Bay now, which is very suitable for taking pictures. Another point, the hotel provides a free shuttle to the duty-free shop and the airport, which is very convenient, and now there are very few hotels that provide a free shuttle. There is one thing, Ctrip stated that there is an s show, but in fact the restaurant is closed, so there is no s show to watch, it is recommended to cancel it in the remarks.

Location: It's one of the bunch of hotels in Haitang Bay, and it's not far from anywhere within Haitang Bay.
Services: Duty-free shop coupons, shuttle bus, luggage delivery and other services included will not be notified at the time of check-in, and if guests forget, they will not mention it. What I want to say is that many people who come here for the first time are not familiar with these things, and it is common for them to realize later. When I think of these services and ask them again, the answer I get is that they need to make an appoin**ent one day in advance. Category. . . In addition, the package clearly includes taking pictures, but some people still say that they are photographers working in the hotel, and then take pictures at the beach for a fee, and they will not ask whether the room we booked includes this. . . I left the store yesterday and left something in the room. I found it at night, and then I went to the hotel to check it. That is to say, it was either not cleaned or found that the guest had left items and did not notify the guest. . . Really dizzy, this can also be called a five-star hotel? ? ? Is there any misunderstanding. . . This series of inaction is really bad.
Amenities: good and bad. The advantage is that you can go directly to the beach from the hotel, and there are many swimming pools where you can play without mosquitoes. The disadvantage is that the TV is so old that the snowflakes are not on-demand. Let's just say that we have been doing this with the old five-star title, because the old brand can get moldy and can make the equipment so old that it lags behind the chain hotels? I have to live and charge as a five-star hotel... I really don't know what to think. . . The three-hundred-dollar Atour experience in all aspects can beat this kind of five-star for several streets. . . .
Friends, hurry up, there are many nearby prices that are similar but much better. If you really want to retreat, you don't need Sheraton. . .

The breakfast is very rich, the porridge is delicious
The hotel has a beautiful garden and you can walk to the beach, but there are a lot of mosquitoes, so you must spray mosquito repellent
The waves in Haitang Bay are too big to go into the sea. Standing on the beach and looking at the sea will make you feel a little dizzy. If you want to go swimming easily, you can stay in Yalong Bay and Dadonghai.
The advantage is close to the duty-free shop and the water world aquarium, and it is very quiet to sleep at night
It would be nice if the beautiful lady who checked in could smile a little more
Booked on Ctrip, if you don't want to live in the middle, you can't refund
Because of the epidemic, the show didn't open.
Note for booking on Ctrip, the free travel photo is a selection of 5 electronic photos, which belong to the business cooperation between Ctrip and the photo shoot. In the end, we usually have to buy photos (maybe we are thin-skinned), if we knew it earlier, we would not make an appoin**ent.

msg:Old-fashioned five-star hotel, the location is not bad, but because it is relatively old, many facilities are outdated. The TV is completely distorted like black and white. Electric mosquito coils are useless at all, and the child stung all over the face. There was a musty smell from the pool room on the first floor. The power ***** is old and cannot be plugged in. The housekeeper never responded to WeChat, and there was no concierge to help with luggage after check-out. The experience was not as good as that of an ordinary express hotel.

🔔Service: On the day of check-in, the duty manager Vivian kept in touch, the room was upgraded, and a small fruit was given after check-in, which is a full score. But at that time, the front desk who set up the job was very general, and I didn't like it.
At the moment of the epidemic, the occupancy rate of the hotel is very low, the service facilities are not fully opened, the lights in the corridor are not turned on, and the swimming pool area of the hotel is not sterilized, resulting in a lot of mosquitoes. Everyone will give more understanding. But as a consumer, I still feel that the experience is lacking, or quite disappointed.

As soon as I got off the plane and got into the hotel, my sister Tina, the housekeeper, contacted her via WeChat and provided one-to-one service. Tell you that the room is ready, feel free to check in, very warm. Then all the big and small things were said on WeChat, and Tina quickly replied and solved it, and bottled water was provided in sufficient quantity on demand. Then take the initiative to send a lot of hotel action matters, and the surrounding food, drink and entertainment strategies. Take the initiative to greet what you need to wait, in short, very thoughtful. The cheapest room I've booked is also quite good, with a large balcony and complete facilities. The park has a good environment, children play, adults have various swimming pools, and there is a barbecue restaurant on the lawn by the sea. The breakfast was super rich and didn't end until 10:30. Not far from the hotel, turn left and there is a big food city, which is very convenient for all kinds of food. It is less than three kilometers away from the duty-free city. The hotel has a shuttle bus. It is convenient for me to take a taxi. All in all a good experience. Not many people on the beach. The only downside is that the sister at the front desk smiles a little less, although her attitude is not bad.

Very happy and satisfied. The hotel is very close to the aquarium duty-free shop. It is also very convenient to some Internet celebrity restaurants. Hotel Chinese food is pretty good. Although on the 30th day of the new year, the speed of serving food was slow and the dishes were wrong. But even a few people in their thirties can understand. I think it's good that the hotel pool is divided into children's area and adult area. I am very satisfied. The room recommends putting a little sober in the toilet, otherwise it will taste bad. There are yachts in the hotel, and there are hang gliders next to them. It's a very happy tour.

Before check-in, the hotel housekeeper Tina contacted me in advance, and took the initiative to add WeChat. From the confirmation of the booking date, he continued to give various suggestions and tips. Any questions during the period were answered and resolved in a timely manner. This service completely exceeded expectations.
The hotel environment is also very good, with a garden-style style and scenery everywhere, which is seamlessly integrated with the JW Marriott Hotel next to it. The number of swimming pools in the hotel is unclear, and each has its own characteristics. Children's favorite constant temperature swimming pool, they go to play every day, and they played in it for more than 4 hours on the day they left.
It takes less than five minutes to walk through a small lawn and a small piece of the beach from the guest room. The hotel is also very close to the duty-free shop and 68 Food City.
I have always communicated with the hotel steward Tina by phone and WeChat, thanking her in person, and met with her specially before leaving. She is also really caring, she also prepared a small gift for the child, and she must give a big like!

When I came to the hotel to check in, I told the lady at the front desk that because it was a 30-week+ pregnant mother, I wanted the floor to be a little higher because I was afraid it would be too noisy. Reese Deng at the front desk kindly helped me to arrange a free upgrade to the supreme sea view room. It also reminded me that the weather in Sanya is cool in the past two days and pay attention to adding clothes. Really gentle and enthusiastic front desk lady. After checking in, the room was really comfortable and clean. There was a bathtub that children liked. The staff came to disinfect and played for a long time. The balcony and the sea view are super beautiful. Immediately decided to stay an extra night. The breakfast buffet is rich and delicious, and children and parents are very satisfied. The restaurant staff are also very friendly. If you see no masks, masks are provided for free. A warm reminder to wear masks. Stay two nights in the hotel and there is a free bus to shuttle to the hospital for free nucleic acid. There is also a free bus back to the airport. It is very close to the beach from the first floor of the hotel. The scenery is also very nice. But the sea waves are big. The hotel also sent travel photography. There are also many restaurants to choose from. We walked to 68 Food City about 600 meters, so we chose to eat in the Food City, where many restaurants have their own flavors. I will definitely choose Sheraton next time I come.

From the concierge check in, there is no guidance and no help with luggage, and the front desk did not inform the hotel facilities. In the case, there is no housekeeping service. I stayed for four or five days in a row, all of which were extended, so I had to change the room card every day, but two times I still couldn't open the door even after changing the room card. I brought the child and asked the cleaning to open the door, and then I went to change the room. Card. The worst thing is to swipe 3,000 pre-authorization. The fee on Ctrip is paid, but there is no need to swipe. I specially asked the front desk to swipe for the checkout for dinner. As a result, I can't post the bill every day when I eat, saying that I have no pre-sale, and also That’s all, the daily meal fee is settled now, the room was changed in the middle and the last time I left the store on the 17th. I also specifically mentioned this situation, but I still can’t post the account. Finally, I left the store for a month, and this pre-authorization was cancelled for me. I'm really speechless. I've been thinking about the money for a long time when I saw this refund today. Don't talk about the epidemic. There was no epidemic when I checked in and left the hotel. It was your work mistake!

But after checking in, the experience returned to normal. The room was warm and clean, and all the details were considered in place. If the water was empty, it would take the initiative to add two more bottles. The swimming pool has lifeguards on duty all the time. And recently, because Hainan requires the itinerary code with an asterisk to check in, nucleic acid is required. The hotel also opened a shuttle bus to the hospital to reimburse the inspection fees for the guests in the epidemic-related areas. The reimbur*****t counter specially prepared cash and change, I feel very intimate, feel good a lot of.
Haitang Bay is not allowed to swim in the sea. It is very interesting to walk on the beach and encounter fishermen. The white horse that goes surfing is the one that usually takes pictures of tourists, and will play for a while after get off work.

The little brother also said: Madam, since you are here at Sheraton, please enjoy our service. Haha, I'm afraid this is going to spoil my babies.

There is such a housekeeper, don't do parent-child travel planning, what's more important is that here, the baby really doesn't cost the mother

The hotel is two steps away from the beach. You can also take a battery car from the lobby to the beach. The beach is open all day and you can go anytime.🌊
The hotel's breakfast is also delicious! There are many varieties to suit many people's tastes! The time also lasted until 10:30 and it was time to eat dinner.
(Finally, the ice cream at the front desk is also delicious. I will stay here again next time~ see you next time)

There was not enough space at the front desk to sit, and there was no air conditioning. The elderly and children just stood there. The hotel breakfast is not as good as the ordinary chain hotels.

The breakfast variety is also relatively rich. As for the taste, this is not a good evaluation. After all, there is no absolute taste in taste. The so-called radish and green vegetables have their own loves!
The day before check-in, there was a butler meeting. Her name is kelly. She has never met her, but she has contacted her many times. She will be contacted for all reservations, reservations, food reservations, consultations, and everything, and she will Patiently answer and fix all one by one! Really a good girl, I look forward to next stay and kelly will be my housekeeper
🚗 Transportation: There is a free airport shuttle bus, you can ask the hotel for the schedule

msg:After staying for one night, I decided to stay for another night. I was very satisfied. Good facilities and good service. The upgraded sea view room is big and beautiful, very close to the sea. Although it is far from the front desk, the concierge has arranged a battery car to pick us up, so don't worry about too much luggage. Although Miss Lois is on vacation, she still cares about our stay, working meticulously and earnestly. The hotel has 4-5 pools, 0.5m-1.5m deep, they are all beautiful. The room package also includes travel shots and water shots. Make an appoin**ent in advance. You must not miss the beautiful photos. The breakfast was rich and Ge Sisi was warm and thoughtful. I heard that we had to sit in the car for a long time after checking out and specially prepared freshly cut fruits for us to eat on the road. Very satisfied with the hotel's various services.
Tips:
1. The hotel has a free shuttle bus to and from the airport, but you have to take a taxi if it is not in service hours. Airport pick-up is 85 yuan.
2. No matter the red flag/green flag/yellow flag is hung in Haitang Bay, it is not allowed to go to sea.
3. Stayed for 2 nights, one day boarded Wuzhizhou Island, the one-way fare was 35 yuan. People over 70 cannot go to the island.
4. The duty-free shop has a free shuttle bus and a 5% discount coupon, but unfortunately I didn't go in a hurry this time.
The warmth and thoughtfulness are reflected everywhere, and the elderly in the family are also full of praise and very satisfying experience!

Later, the hotel upgraded to a Premium Deluxe Ocean View Room for free, which gave me a great surprise in other aspects. First of all, It’s quite big. When you enter the hotel lobby, there is a strong holiday flavor. There are many lush coconut trees and swimming pools in the inner courtyard. I go swimming every day. The breakfast buffet is also very rich. I also want to thank the staff of the restaurant, Ge Sisi, for those few days. We took care of it meticulously. I remember that my friend likes to drink ice American and prepares it for us every day. The day before leaving, he also sent us bread and fruit to eat on the road. The service was great!

The hotel is equipped with double bicycles, small trains, children's playgrounds, etc. The swimming pool water is clean and transparent. It is also close to the duty-free shop and convenient for shopping. The breakfast was also very good and plentiful. The waiters were very nice. In the end, the lady was unwell and didn't want to eat breakfast. After I explained the situation to the waiter, the waiters Ge Sisi and Xie Qi packed the food for me, which made us very moved. The service of the hotel is very good. The room attendant cleans up the room as required and distributes more mineral water when needed. Especially thanks to the hotel butler Kelly, who called me before I checked into the hotel and asked me when I would be in the hotel and if there is any need to help me arrange in advance. I said that I stayed at Sheraton for 3 days a few days ago and it was free at that time. Upgrade to a sea view room, there is a very good experience, I hope to upgrade this time too. Kelly heard that I was an old customer, so she said to check the room reservation status this time, and arrange it for me if allowed, and finally upgrade me to a noble deluxe ocean view room, which is a twin room. If we need to, we will arrange the staff to put the double bed. Putting it together, I was very thoughtful and gave a fruit plate as a gift. I feel pleasantly surprised everywhere! In short, great! The Sheraton Hotel is truly good!

The noodles for breakfast and dinner are also delicious. The kids at the dinner show very much and are very happy. There are a lot of swimming pools, and the children’s playground is very big, but there are no electric projects and bubble shows. I don’t know if it’s because of the epidemic, but the children still have fun for two days. It's never like this in normal times. Went back on the last day, butler Kelly also gave a birthday gift to the child, but we have already checked out and sent it back specially, thank you very much! The family was happy and satisfied during the two-day vacation, especially the caring service of the butler Kelly. The only thing that is a bit unpleasant is the bad attitude of the photographer who shoots underwater, and the family who makes it unhappy.

We only finished the procedures in the last forty minutes. Then the shuttle bus drove us to the house far away. There were no street lights along the way, so it was very dark. Once we entered the house for a long time, including in the hallway, then we went down to eat. I couldn’t find the restaurant or the service staff. I shouted that there was no one to respond to us. Finally, I found an aunt and took us to the hall. The hall staff said there was no food. , Let us go to the vending machine to buy it. When we arrived, the container was empty and there was no food to eat. Then we went to the front desk and told us that we could only order takeaway. When we searched it, we got one and a half. When I was young, I felt like I was about to collapse. In the end, there was nothing we could do. We drove a long distance and bought instant noodles. We felt that the hotel that spent 1900 to live in should not be of this grade, and the supporting services were not worth 1900 yuan.

The hotel upgraded the room type for us, we can see the sea view, which added infinite happiness to the two boring rainy days. Looking at the sea view, even if it rains, it doesn’t matter if we can’t go out, we can really enjoy the happiness of vacation. It is also very close to the beach, and it takes only two minutes to walk to the beach.
The hotel service is also very good, the room is cleaned, and I folded the clothes I littered before going out. Will choose here next time~

Advantages: the price is cheap, the children’s playground is huge, and animal feeding is also free, and the trainers are also very good. They introduce us to feed the small animals everywhere, and they give a lot of food.
Disadvantages: There is no special service in the swimming pool and no clean towels. This is not as good as MGM. Breakfast is also relatively simple, without any seafood.

There are several large and small swimming pools of various shapes between the coconut trees downstairs. Children can splash water without fear of drying, especially Nice. The key point is to praise the customer manager Miki. A few hours before the check-in, he called to inform the shopping transportation method and the duty-free city coupon package. The welcome fruit was arranged at the check-in. It was super caring and praised for Miki's service. Next time you have time, you must bring your children to stay for a few more days.

msg:Check-in time is from October 6th to 7th, the penultimate day of National Day Golden Week. Basically, the price of five-star Haitang Bay has returned to normal levels.
Since there is a certain connection with the jw Marriott nearby (blindly guess the same part of the boss), the two yards are connected together, which is very invincible. Staying in a hotel enjoys both sides of the environment.

🚗 Transportation: It is close to 68 Food City, and the walk is completely ok. Within 10 minutes, there is a distance from the lobby to the entrance of the hotel. We met the boy who took the shuttle bus and took the initiative to pick him up. This is a bonus.

🧹Hygienic: When I checked in, it had been raining for two days in Haitang Bay. Most of the furniture in the hotel is made of wood, so it feels a bit tidal. However, from the perspective of cleanliness, it basically reaches the standard of quasi-four-to-five. (There are still a lot of big five-star brands in Haitang Bay, and the price of Sheraton is really conscientious)

🍃Environment: The external environment is nothing to say, cost-effective. After all, there are many big-name hotels in the surrounding area, and the price of Sheraton is definitely close to the people. But the environment can compete with the surrounding ones. There should be something.

🔔Service: I have stayed in two Bay Areas, and I have been seeing hotel butlers in various reviews about what hotels. But the first hotel I stayed in was not contacted. Until the second hotel housekeeper, Miss Kelly, contacted WeChat by phone the morning of the check-in day, there was a sense of authenticity... , After all, during the National Day, everyone is busy with many people, and it is not easy to be able to provide services while busy. Ms. Kelly answered all our questions patiently and enthusiastically. This is very important. It stimulates the guests' desire to explore the hotel. After all, if there is no guide, it seems that the fun of staying will be lost? Anyways, I also helped us apply for the fruit, which is quite fresh, thank you very much. In the future, I will consider staying at the Sheraton in Haitang Bay, hoping that the hotel service can be maintained.

msg:The good part of the hotel: The hotel is located in the middle of Haitang North Road, about 10 minutes to Duty Free City. It takes a few minutes to walk out of the food street. It is a bit of a waste to drive to eat. The hotel has a duty-free city shuttle and a 5% discount coupon. Remember to make a reservation one day in advance. The hotel is so big that it’s a bit collapsed to find a room with a room card. I really want to have a battery car on the 5th floor. You can see the sea, the landscaping is very good, and you can see the little squirrels. There are also many swimming pools in the hotel, large and small, suitable for the needs of different age groups, with sufficient towels and plenty of water playing equipment to rent. There are also many activities for children, such as feeding small animals and climbing in the jungle. Breakfast gave me a bonus to Sheraton. It’s free for those under 12. After eating for two days, breakfast is almost at the peak of the meal. There is no waiting in line, and it is quick to find a place. Although there are many diners, the waiters are busy and orderly, and they are cleaned up very well. In time, food and tableware can be replenished as soon as it is finished. There are also various drinks provided for free at the door, which is really well done in 5 stars. The buffet dinner at Yacui Restaurant is also very good, open-air, and there are shows to watch, old people and children like it. The beach has a big wave and cannot go into the sea. The hotel staff has been on duty at the beach and they are very responsible!
Tucao hotel place: Check in is generally slow, there is no air-conditioning in the lobby, it is hot and sweaty, and the fan is turned on after giving an opinion, but the fan is blowing at the front desk staff, which is really speechless. I put up a sign for the members to line up, and after waiting for a long time, I found that the members were in line, and no one was in line for non-members. There was no usb port in the room, which was very collapsed. No power plugs.
PS: Sheraton and Marriott are next to each other. You can go to Marriott's pool and restaurants (picture 8 is Marriott), but it feels completely unnecessary ☺️

msg:During the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, I stayed at the Sheraton Haitang Bay Hotel and booked the actual experience for each day on the reviews and Ctrip. Ctrip won the review.
On the first day of check-in, the front desk arranged a room on the 6th floor for me. Unfortunately, this one is far away. It seems that there is no air-conditioning at the front desk. We still dragged our luggage and felt like we couldn’t walk. Simple also has a musty smell. Okay, after a little rest in the room, I plan to go to the front desk to change rooms. I walked downstairs until I got lost and I went to the staff passage or banquet hall. Was it because the room had a musty smell because of the recent weather, and then I changed to a glasses-wearing person to receive it, but I didn’t plan to see it for a long time, but I checked into the hotel just after three o’clock and gave me a far and moldy room or a five-star hotel There is no solution, and then I really plan to call Ctrip or review customer service. I received a call from Alana. It is estimated that Ctrip is responsible for the reservation. Because I did not receive the call for the review reservation, I told her the current problem happened. I just paid it. In the lobby, she quickly came out to help me deal with it and arranged a car pick-up in the park, upgraded the room, and carefully followed my check-out and other hotel usage. She was still very careful and praised her. The hotel's supporting entertainment can also have underwater photography. Travel photography can also be played well if you can't wait out of the hotel. The room recommends the swimming pool to swim at any time. Although I only swam for half an hour, there is no problem. Thank you Alana for the arrangement. There is also a hotel shuttle that is not very convenient. It is a bit less to book one day in advance and it is not flexible enough. Although I booked the car twice but the last time is not consistent, it is not particularly convenient to take a taxi by yourself.

Next to the hotel is the Food City, which is very convenient for eating. It takes ten minutes to get to the international duty-free shop by taxi.

msg:Overall a bad hotel. Fortunately, only stayed one night. Not recommended.
1. Unfamiliar with the check-in front desk business. The face recognition system was a waste of a lot of time if it couldn't fix it all the time, and it didn't fix it after standing at the front desk for a long time.
2. The room hygiene is really worrying. There are also rubber bands and nails from previous guests on the ground... The tent may never have been washed. .
3. Except for the 1.5-meter swimming pool, which is slightly cleaner, the water in the other swimming pools is relatively muddy. This is really unacceptable...Who doesn't swim in Sanya? Dirty swimming pool just can't justify it.
4. Children's slide maintenance, not open, full of ants crawling
5. The swimming pool rents a boat for 80 hours and swimming laps for 30 hours. The payment is collected by private WeChat. The service is also extremely lazy and ignores it.
6. The children’s playground is free, and you can play until 10 o’clock in the evening. Except for the children’s playground, there is nothing to play. It is boring.
7. The soundproofing of the room is surprisingly poor... Take a shower upstairs and you can hear it when you move around. Was woken upstairs at 1:30 in the morning, in a bad mood
8. In particular, at the front desk in the check-out area, I have been chatting with guests about how to book a room cheaply, which website to book on. After chatting for a long time, the guests queuing up for check-out are impatient and she is still talking...the problem is this Check-out place, and it is the only check-out place. Can only wait.
9. The hotel has a shuttle bus to the airport, along the way to the Marriott Westin to pick up guests, you have to calculate the time, don't delay.
10. Hotel takeaway can only be delivered to the security booth at the gate, not into the lobby...You have to run a long way to get it, and the security booth can’t store it. The delivery staff can’t wait for you to get it and throw it directly on the grass by the roadside. Seen this kind of hotel once.
11. The beach of Haitang Bay is too bad, I am not in the mood to take pictures. I came from Yalong Bay Hotel, and the contrast is really too big.
12. The few guys in the hotel lobby concierge are very nice, have a good attitude and are positive in doing things! Taking takeaway is too far away and actively helping me arrange the battery car. The guy who asked Lin Song to take me to take the takeaway, and took the initiative to wait for me to take me back. Great!
Sheraton is really getting worse and worse. For future hotel bookings, we still need to look at the overall rating of Ctrip before choosing.

msg:I can't remember how many times I have stayed at the Sheraton Haitang Bay, at least every time I come to Sanya for a business trip, I will check the price of the Sheraton Haitang Bay first. This time I booked a premium ocean view room. The room type equipment should be different from the ordinary ocean view. The only difference is estimated to be the floor. The front desk miki is very nice. I helped us choose the highest floor in the middle and the room with the most open sea view. I was very moved. I was very happy with the fruit. The children’s pool is not open. It is estimated that it is under maintenance. The other two pools can be used for swimming, and the shade of trees will not feel very dry. Colleagues agree that it is great. I should continue to think about it next time

msg:Just checked out to review. I booked a two-night sea-view room package in 1899, which is the cheapest among the first-line hotels in Haitang Bay. The hotel is large and the location is good. The sea view is basically unobstructed, unlike the nearby hotel facing Wuzhizhou Island, which is obstructed by the sea. There are many large rooms in the hotel, and my room faces north to see Atlantis and half of the sea view. There are very few tourists in the off-season, and only one pool restaurant is open. Breakfast is served at the Marriott next door for a minimum of 1,500 nights. Is it an upgrade? Both Chinese and Western styles are very rich. You can eat lunch at 9 until 10:30. During the day, there is nothing to play in the hotel. There are few beach visitors, but swimming is prohibited. The sandy quality is average. You can splash on the shore, or you can go to the gardens and swimming pools of other hotels along the coast (Marriott and Sheraton are actually one, and the garden pool is more better). The hotel’s non-buffet dinners are extremely expensive and few people go to eat. Fortunately, there is a Haitang Food City and Hualian Supermarket (also the reason for choosing Sheraton) not far from it, which is only a ten-minute walk away. Although the prices are a bit more expensive than in the city, they are still much cheaper than those in the hotels, so many people who live in nearby hotels go to eat. The overall experience feels cost-effective. For a hotel of the same quality and price, the hotel in Cancun, Mexico includes three buffet meals. The sea-view beach is also better than that of Haitang Bay. The domestic labor and income levels are so low, but the hotel prices are so high. If the resources are idle, why should I lower my body appropriately? For dinner, several restaurants have a buffet of more than 100. I think tourists will stay in the hotel instead of going to the Begonia Food City.

msg:The low-season check-in price is very suitable, but there are many corresponding activities, because there are too few people. Before I stayed in the housekeeper, Miki contacted me and learned that I took the child to upgrade the little yellow duck parent-child room. The child was very happy. Although there are not many outdoor activities, you can also play indoors. From check-in to check-out, the butler Miki communicated with me in advance. Thank you very much. The hotel does not need to introduce the old five-star hotel. The location is very good. The seaside garden is also green. Very good, I hope that next time I stay at the swimming pool and other projects can be developed, and then I can meet the housekeeper Miki again

msg:Over the years, I have gone to Sanya for vacation almost every year, and I have to stay at a hotel in Haitang Bay almost every time. Sheraton is often the first choice. Our family seems to be used to everything about Sheraton. The eldest sister of room cleaning and service is as kind and patient as always, and Kelly, the housekeeper who took the initiative to contact our housekeeper before check-in, is also very considerate and patient. Thank you very much! But there are two aspects that feel wrong for the first time. One is that the attitude of the front desk staff is not as good as before. I don’t know if it’s because Sheraton was taken over by Marriott. There were not many guests in the epidemic, and they were not busy or tired. Yes, but still in a cold and arrogant reception state, even the minimum greetings are gone, and I have to ask me where I can check in. I no longer have the professionalism, even how to move the room and the location and time of breakfast. introduced! Fortunately, I am a regular customer, and Kelly can also ask questions. Another problem is that ice cream is provided during breakfast, and a written notice is required to indicate that Marriott members can use it. I want to say which people who live in a hotel and eat breakfast are not enough to become a member, even if they are new guests, they did not apply at the front desk. Can I make up later if I join the conference? With so many breakfast buffets, why did the hotel make an unbelievable ice cream spot to be an eye-catcher? On the first morning, when my child went to pick up the ice cream, he returned aggrieved and said: Mom, ice cream can only be eaten by members. I had no choice but to stop breakfast and ask the waiter who was dumbfounded, what membership did you tell a kid about? I finally asked him directly, "Would you like to take a pen to record my membership number, and then check whether it is true, and then give me ice cream?" He shrunkenly said "No, no need" I want to say that the hotel should ban this Funny rules! It feels bad for guests to get up early in the morning to eat. Don't think it is the highlight of breakfast, this is the failure of the hotel's catering service!

We stayed for 3 nights and ate 3 hotel lawn buffet dinners! First, change the theme every day, the food is different! Secondly, the s show performance also changes every day, so you won’t get tired of it! This dinner hotel is hard! It is recommended to feel it!
Some swimming pools have shade cloth, so you can swim in the hot sun without getting too exposed!
There are airport transfers and duty-free shops with a 5% discount, and everything is available! Living in a two-bedroom sea view, the view is good, just the blue fish layout, a bit low! But the double bed can be put together into a 2.4 extra-large bed, so you won't be crowded when you fall asleep! The air conditioner is generally not good, probably because of the design that is connected to the outdoor!
A girl at the front desk was very considerate, because our flight was late and helped us to check out until 3 o'clock! thumbs up!

Although the room facilities are slightly outdated, it does not affect the use. The food at breakfast and the buffet at dinner are both good in color and fragrance, just like the flies in the restaurant, which reduces the experience of free entry and exit! In the evening, while walking on the beach, I met fishermen rushing to the sea. I saw a lot of fish at night. I met the jellyfish that were shot ashore at night. The children were happy to return to the sea. If the flies in the restaurant disappear completely, I will come back next year.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank the hotel GRO-Kelly for actively meeting us before check-in and arranging the room type in advance. Since we brought a six-year-old baby, we thoughtfully put the twin bed into a super-large bed, so that we arrived a little more late at night when the plane was delayed. You can rest and adjust immediately after the hotel. Then talk about the hotel. I am satisfied that although the house is some years old but the whole is clean and tidy. The hotel staff are also very polite. We buy a hand-cranked boat for the children. The staff found that our children were too young to play and immediately proposed to us. The refund, although only a few tens of dollars, is very warm. Finally, there are some shortcomings. The water volume in the room is not large enough, especially when the shower is adjusted to a high place, the water volume is obviously smaller, and then the water temperature is not stable enough, and sometimes it may be hot and cold.

After so many years, the room facilities should really be improved. It can keep up with the standard of a five-star hotel... And now there are a lot of beach bikes on the beach. Although you can play, it is really too noisy and the car oil smells too unpleasant (this beach bike is the entire beach Doing business includes other hotels) I still like the quiet beach with lounge chairs before! What is commendable is the hotel’s shuttle bus. The wife is so convenient, especially Xiao Lin’s brother, with good attitude and good service👍👍👍

msg:The hotel is very clean. Don't choose the pool room at the very edge. The pool is obviously small. The room is quite big, after all, for some years, some broken corners are sp****ly visible, but it does not affect the stay. The waiters are very enthusiastic and will answer all questions. You can see it when you walk around, and you can solve the problem quickly when you find them. But there are too few restaurants in the hotel. The buffet dinner is open every day, and it’s hard to eat on a hot day. There is also a Chinese restaurant that tastes okay.

The service staff were kind and friendly, and they smiled brightly when they saw the guests actively greet them. The swimming pool is also very clean, large and comfortable. There are also various parent-child activities. The sky is blue, the sea is wide and the waves are white, and the environment is very good.

However, on the first day I went there may be too many guests. In the evening, the child took a bath and got the water into the room. I called the customer service to deal with it. After waiting for the whole night, no one would deal with it. In the end, it was myself. Wipe it with a towel!

msg:The room has a musty smell, which may be due to dampness and lack of ventilation. During the day, it is better to open the balcony doors for meetings. The hotel environment is good, the swimming pool is particularly good, and the shade cloth on the swimming pool is more intimate. The breakfast is very rich and the dinner is an outdoor lawn buffet. There is a show, which is really good! The noodles of the set meal are also very rich!
It’s just that I fell down in the aisle, and there was a rain gutter that was high and low, but the color was the same as that of the floor tiles. I didn’t notice that I turned my foot and fell and injured my hands and feet. The hotel staff was very active in dealing with it. The hotel does not have an infirmary, only a small medicine box with some iodophor and purple syrup. The emergency measures in this regard should be more comprehensive!

msg:Check-in: Very fast, the explanation is very detailed, the arrangement is on the 8th floor by the sea, it is really crooked, I didn't want to go out to play as soon as I entered the hotel. I gave the child an ice cream, and I forgot to eat it the next morning...
Breakfast: more generous, Chinese and Western style, there are more stalls to make first, I like it, it is really suitable for children, boiled thin noodles or something, the milk is also distinguished from full fat skim; many people need to take a seat, so I don’t have a seat. The window is a little regrettable, but satisfied anyway; the juice is good
Room: Comfortable, cool, the air conditioner is always plugged in, the temperature and humidity are very comfortable, so I feel comfortable in the Meiyu area and I don’t want to go out; the window is diagonally facing the sea, and the platform outside the door is facing the sea; the elevator goes down to the swimming pool, Buffet lawn, across the lawn is the sea;
Swimming pool: It has different heights. It is said that there is a constant temperature. There is a small water park with slides for children. There are frangipani and red frangipani flowers by the pool, and there is also a circular swimming pool-but it is rare for a bear child to enter the water at 1.2 , Other swimming pools are not willing to go, which is also very good
Buffet dinner: all you can eat, there are performances, the fruit is great, seafood...It is recommended not to eat it. If you want to eat seafood, you can skip this buffet. But just downstairs, the taste is decent and not bad. Free for children under 6
Beach: In the past, it was for children to play in the water and sand. Being close to the sea is really the first consideration. The beach is very thin, the slope is not too big, and there are occasional small fishes in the waves, which is fun. There is almost no light at night. It is a pity that I have to look at the child with 2 pairs of 14 eyes. During the day, the beach is very quiet, without all kinds of peddling and play items, suitable for bringing a baby.
The dolls in the lobby are very beautiful and difficult to grasp, and the machine does not seem to be very good
I received a return call and added points when I first arrived and landed.
It's rare to stay in a hotel of a thousand dollars at a time, very comfortable! Will go next time

Special praise for Ctrip's pick-up, this experience is also very good.

What surprised us most about staying at the Sheraton this time was that the hotel lobby manager Su gave us an upgrade to the best ocean view suite in the hotel. Just in time for the birthday, the hotel gave a birthday cake, and Manager Su gave a fruit plate. My family and I had a perfect vacation. Will choose here next time.

msg:The overall Sheraton experience is very good! The hotel is very large with complete facilities. There are many large and small swimming pools, as well as intimate rain and sun sheds. The level of care is the best among the four hotels on this trip. The hotel also feels very open. It is connected to the Marriott Hotel. It is very large, exquisite and beautiful, and very high-end.
⭐️Hardware: The hotel room is a luxurious sea-view room, very spacious, with a balcony, two chairs, and a sofa bed. I am embarrassed not to have afternoon tea. The toilet is separated from dry and wet, and there is a shower room and a bathtub, so that children can play with bubbles.
⭐️Parents: For family outings, we attach great importance to entertainment packages. There is a pet paradise here, close to the little white rabbits, fish ponds, wild ducks, peacocks and so on. There is a farm, although there is no experience. There is also a children's playground, which not only has many facilities and large supporting facilities, but also has real interaction. In addition to these, there are various small trains in the hotel park, and bicycles can be rented. The swimming pool also has a special swimming pool suitable for babies. All swimming laps, boats and other equipment can be rented. Very convenient.
⭐️Meals: There are different types of restaurants to choose from. I personally recommend outdoor barbecues, with wonderful performances and various cuisines, which is very a**ospheric. There are also Chinese restaurants, the dishes are also very delicious😄
⭐️Service: Overall it is great, and the service can be answered instantly. There is also a scooter in the park. I would like to praise Kobayashi, the concierge depar**ent, for his enthusiasm and good service. He gave us an introduction to the hotel in his car.

對了，酒店和鉑爵旅拍有合作，拍照真的很出片，很推薦，隔壁就是68美食街，吃東西很方便，反正去哪都很近！真的很推薦！

環境方面:酒店內的綠化不錯，但綠化多也意味着蚊子也多，建議出門必須多塗點驅蚊的東西，泳池也夠娃玩耍，還有泳池房感覺帶娃三口的話可以考慮住一下，娃下水很方便；海棠灣沙灘離酒店步行10分鐘內吧，沙質可以但感覺沙灘垃圾很多，風浪也大，相比後面幾天的亞龍灣，我個人還是喜歡亞龍灣的沙灘海水。
服務方面:工作人員服務態度態度參差不齊，首先，下午三點多辦入住時因為父母腿腳不便讓前台幫安排離的少許近一點的房間或是加錢升級下房間，前台一開始説衹有一間打掃好的但離的遠，近的話還要等一小時，升級房型也沒打掃好，和前台交涉現在時間點你們還沒打掃完房間不太合理，對方又説快打掃好了，總之感覺前台做事有點敷衍或是打掃效率真的這麼低；其次，辦完入住行李靠自己運到房間，中間問了一個酒店大廳賣哈根達斯還是冷飲啥的工作人員路，對方也是全程玩着自己手機回覆問題；除了以上情況碰到的其他工作人員都還行吧，特別是開小火車的司機師傅看到客人很主動微笑打招呼，打掃衞生的阿姨也很認真負責，電話給客服的要求，基本等半小時左右都會送來。管家服務感覺有點雞肋，消息回覆並不及時，答應的事情完成的也很不及時，最後説寄禮品也沒有後續，但態度還是可以的。
飲食:早餐比較一般，能吃飽但説不出亮點；週末的峇里島自助晚餐就食材來説感覺不值這個價，啤酒需要另外收費，但能邊吃邊聽駐場唱歌演奏，氣氛在那裡，也就不在意太多了，感覺比較適合不帶娃的小年輕吧，另外母親節還送了每桌蛋糕。
三天兩夜按照團購套餐價購買來説，總體還行，有優有劣，但至少帶着一家四口性價比還是可以的。

上午吃完早飯，還去餵了小動物，之後就去遊樂園玩，我不熱，孩子也不熱，不錯！

泳池水有點臟，雜物較多，十分介意的家長會不習慣，但是其他親子也不錯，大堂吧的椰子很好喝，中餐廳也物美價廉，尤其麪館，很好吃！

樓頂8F露台很不錯，看夕陽，看日出，都很安靜！

圖片為每天早上看到的景色，很舒服！

但是放房間空調風直接吹着大床，對人類幼崽不太友好！

然後是服務，尤其是管家小弟王柏策，盡職盡守，主動幫忙，對我的一些要求幾乎是第一時間解決。上次亞龍灣選擇的喜來登，也是因為酒店服務，設施各方面都不錯，所以海棠灣也是選擇的喜來登，跟預期的一樣，很滿意。

前台有個小姑娘， check in時沒有一點點的笑容，板著臉，也不帶工牌，她是誰？很牛的態度，我在投訴時，她站在旁邊還板著臉看看我，不屑一顧的表情，這種人可以做服務性行業麼？估計酒店生意太好了，不會care 我們這種人。不過以後再也不會來了，三亞那麼多酒店不會選擇你們喜來登，不過也是，畢竟不是高端品牌我確實要求也不能太高。就這樣吧，希望看到點評的人你們要慎重選擇，酒店很舊，大堂很Low，海景房是這樣的，很遠的。

酒店裡遇見的服務員尤其客房服務員都很有禮貌，讓我感覺海南人很樸實親切。
特別給江蘇、張秀芹、吉雨欣點贊，給五星好評！！感動！感謝！

餐食也很不錯，早餐自助餐品豐富，中餐晚餐可麪食、可點菜，還有自助燒烤（帶着長者，沒嘗試，有點遺憾）。

房間很大，衞浴乾濕分離，陽台很舒服，設施設備都很齊全。
雖然是滿房的狀態早餐有排隊，但是工作人員都很專業，最忙的時候去也衹排了不到五分鐘就安排位置坐下了，早餐種類繁多，味道鮮美，有很多海南特色的檔口。
酒店內的遊玩項目也非常多，私人海灘，椰林密佈，不出酒店也可以有一個很好的體驗
最後表揚管家小符，細心體貼，約車換房什麼都很及時給了回覆和方案，特別感謝給我們提供了一個很美好的度假體驗。

送的下午茶，都是小小的，每種兩個，兩杯飲料！説實話，味道一般。很多色素！
訂的週四的自助晚餐，原來説是泰式的，結果是小火鍋，點的糟粕醋和椰子雞的鍋底，椰子雞的底就是清湯的，沒有椰子味道！沒有椰汁！自助餐要提前預約，要不然沒地方，不讓坐！
叢林探險，去晚了，馬上要關了，也沒玩上，孩子就隨便爬了爬，然後就去釣魚了！這裏可以免費釣魚！這個小孩子倒是蠻喜歡！掉出來羅非魚就餵了旁邊的鴨子！

下午1點鐘到店，前台説還在收拾，大概1小時左右可以入住。我們到1樓的麪館點了吃的，肉夾饃🥙和biangbiang麪味道一級棒，分量十足，送的四份小菜也特別好吃，見我們愛吃又送我們一套，服務棒棒噠！
吃完飯房間剛好準備好了。房間很喜歡，打開窗子，海風輕拂,舒適愜意。
放下行李，我們打車去的亞特蘭蒂斯水世界，暢玩到天黑。在出口處吃了晚餐，步行回酒店1公里裏多一點，不緊不慢溜達着，剛好消消食。
晚上預約的Spa，睡前放鬆了一下，美女們加班為我倆服務，點贊👍
管家Odette服務周到，有問題諮詢時非常熱情、回覆及時，還貼心地為我們送來了水果。時間關係我們衹住了一晚，下次還會再來。

首先，我要提到的是酒店的服務態度。在這裏，每一位員工都熱情周到，始終以微笑和禮貌待人。無論是前台的工作人員還是客房服務員，都讓人感受到了家的温暖。他們不僅細心解答我的各種問題，還主動提供了一些實用的旅行建議，讓我倍感貼心。
其次，酒店的設施和環境也讓我印象深刻。寬敞的大堂、舒適的休息區以及美麗的花園都讓我感受到了高品質的生活體驗。游泳池、健身房等休閑娛樂設施也一應俱全，符合五星標準。
然而，在入住過程中，我也發現了一些不足之處。房間設施稍微有些陳舊，這在一定程度上影響了居住的舒適度。此外，我還發現馬桶蓋子有些鬆動，這雖然不是大問題，但也希望能引起酒店的重視。

總的來説，三亞海棠灣喜來登酒店給我留下了不錯的印象。優質的服務和美麗的環境讓我倍感滿意，雖然房間設施有些不足，但這並不影響我對酒店的總體評價。我相信，隨着酒店的不斷改進和發展，未來一定會為客人提供更加完美的入住體驗。

房間衞生和酒店設施都很不錯，一點看不出來裝修已有十幾年。尤其是酒店配備了很多小孩子喜歡的項目和活動，非常適合親子游。套餐裏包含的項目都還不錯，除了鉑爵旅拍又加了些錢，其他都沒再有額外收費。酒店裡一些親子活動的收費項目也不是很貴，像是小火車，十幾分鍾30元，我覺得可以接受，當然免費更好😁
早飯豐盛，種類豐富，有海南特色。不過需要排隊是萬萬沒想到的……這點感覺應該可以改進。套餐裏包含兩頓飯，一頓自助，一頓中餐，旺季都需要預約。自助趕上的是歐洲主題，肉類很豐富，非常實惠；中餐有兩個套餐可以選，我們選的好像是海鮮相關，有一條魚、有一盤蝦、一盤炒飯、涼拌菜、豆腐、青菜、湯等，菜量比較小，如果有男士估計不夠吃。

入住前門口接行李的迎賓都沒有，大堂亂哄哄的，像火車站一樣，辦理入住等待非常久，結果安排了一個距離特別遠不向陽的房間。
房間更不用説，各種老化，床也破破爛，電視打開是藍屏。充電線也沒有。這個價格感覺還不如火車站的漢庭。
早餐更離譜，排隊的人排到沙灘去了，現場也沒有服務員維護秩序，滿地小孩亂跑，食品跟不上拿的速度。太垃圾了，拉黑了

服務差是前台接待很差，入住夠多次打電話詢問都沒有迴應，然後衹能跑到前台去解決問題
第二天清理房間沒有浴袍和其他東西，晚上打了3次電話，送過來的。

住喜來登之前2晚是住的大東海JW萬豪，對比服務和專業性，差距比較大

最後一天的早上，還沒有到閉餐時間，提醒服務員➕飲料，最後也就這樣了。。。

msg:1.後花園和泳池很大，整個花園都和隔壁萬豪通着的，是一家兒。遛彎兒可以遛很久。
2.沙灘就在酒店後邊兒，沙子很細膩，沒有小石子、貝殼一類的東西，不紮腳。就是冬季浪很大，整個海棠灣都不讓下海游泳（小東海的洲際酒店那邊可以）
3.出酒店左拐，走5~10分鐘就有個86美食廣場，吃的很多，還有小超市。但是距離免税店3、4公里，打車10分鐘不到。
4.酒店管家服務非常周到、耐心，安排得明明白白，並且還給升級了房型超級無敵棒 ，Davey好評!!!
5.酒店的客房衞生整潔，床品舒適，睡得很舒服
春節如果跟家人帶孩子來還想住在這裏。

設施：孩子玩的地方並不是全天開放，娛樂區域要14:30才開，可以安排倒班制，而不是閉門制！
環境：整體設計如果放在12年前，確實是豪華酒店，現在是豪華性價比酒店，綠化還行，沙灘沒意思，躺椅沒有，因為海棠灣不能下水，所以沙灘配套幾乎沒有… 
服務：分人吧！有的人真的很熱情，我們的管家Davey就很好，雖然權力有限，但都儘量滿足客人的服務需求；有的人像冤種，心情不好，建議休息，畢竟酒店硬件的不足要靠服務彌補；前廳經理和值班經理還有客房服務的阿姐們都挺好的，但前台員工實在實在是需要加強培訓，態度刻板！拒絕客人需求那是乾脆利索！
雖然沒有萬豪積分，但平台的服務保障確實讓人安心。
圖片後兩張是萬豪，兩家挨着，泳池可以通用… 入住沒照酒店照片 …
