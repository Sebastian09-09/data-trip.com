All towels and toiletries have their own logos, and the service is very professional! The most surprising thing is that the toilet is self-powered, and even the curtains are automatic~ It is very quiet and tidy. The ladies at the front desk are very polite and very sweet~ It can really be said to be the king of cost performance~ It is very good to just have a good sleep. There is a morning tea and supper restaurant downstairs, which is absolutely amazing and delicious! Drinking tea is also very relaxing.

msg:Very poor hotel, when you enter the room, there is an old musty smell, the chair is covered with a layer of hair, it is dirty, the room facilities are old, and every time you press the pillow, there will be a p smell. The room only provides two bottles of 330ml water by default, which is not enough for one person for one night. It is very troublesome to always ask the front desk for water. In addition, the rooms in the corridor are very dense, twists and turns, and there is even one place under construction. If you live in and out by yourself, you will be afraid. I really don't know where the five stars come from. The only redeeming feature is that there is an uncle security guard outside the hotel and a young trainee security guard who looks like a newcomer with a good attitude, actively helping to find a parking space and directing the parking.

From the security guard to the front desk in the whole hotel, there is no smiling face, no hello, no welcome to check in, only the cleaning lady is very polite and maintains the quality that hotel practitioners should have. When booking a room, go to the front desk to arrange the corner room first, or the room without sofa and coffee table, which does not match the picture, and after several turnovers, it will be replaced with a normal room. The overall hotel is very dark and depressing. The older facilities are acceptable in my heart, but it is unforgivable for people with skin allergies in terms of hygiene.

酒店位於三亞市中心，生活上比較方便。，旁邊挨着一個挺大購物中心。離三亞河，第一市場，步行街都不遠。
工作人員服務態度很好，有問必答，春節期間入住還送了糖果和祝福語，好評。
早餐略簡單了，菜品種類可選不多，與五星酒店不匹配，但是吃飽沒問題。
總之在春節高峯期入住，能500出頭訂到房已經實屬不易。總體好評推薦入住。

msg:我們到酒店晚上12點了，又帶着孩子，前台小夥子一邊接電話一邊辦入住，等待的時間太久，以後還是多派一個人解決問題吧，本來想續住的，早上問前台，續住還要加錢，瞬間轉移另外一家。早上想睡懶覺的不合適，樓下七點多就有商家在放音樂，超級大聲，但是衞生和其他工作人員還是很OK的

入住之後至旅行結束，沒有再換過酒店，甚至中間把在海南旅行的朋友們也拉過來入住了悦信，所有人都一致認為酒店的性價比、乾淨度、服務水平達到了五星標準。這裏尤其要感謝前台李才能小美女的高標準服務，入住第一晚從商務房直接就給升級了豪華房，之後的每晚都享受到了豪華房的高標待遇。此次海南之旅，因為李才能小美女仙女般的服務，讓我們所有人在視覺享受三亞美景之時又體驗到賓至如歸的感覺🌹🌹🌹

選這個酒店原因:市區，吃飯方便。三亞和海棠灣大東海感覺遊客太多了 之前玩過。吃飯不方便。蠻貴。市區有很多當地的拼叉燒燒鵝飯 炒粉 也就十多元 很划算 應有盡有。
🚗 交通：非常方便。應該算是市中心吧 去哪兒都方便。三亞有微信付款寶乘車碼坐公車特別方便。打車也多滴滴也多。市區遊客不怎麼多也不怎麼堵車

🧹衞生：挺乾淨。就是床🛏️太硬拉 希望改進一下哦其他體驗很好✌️✌️

🍃環境：泳池比較小。但是還可以

🔔服務：前台小妹蠻漂亮的。也很好
🍚吃飯:附近有藍海購物廣場 可以逛街吃飯。商品街也不遠 第一市場解放街騎車方便 很近。
