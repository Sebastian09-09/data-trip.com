msg:Nice, huge and a very clean hotel. Free parking straight to guests' rooms are very convenient especially on rainy days. A bit far from the CBD and didn't connect to the Metro system yet, but got a huge sports theme mall nearby. Very helpful staff, especially 小梁 at the front desk, she helped me all the way out from checking in, telling me where to park till I need the get my supper delivery order to my room, a huge huge thanks to her.

msg:This is the second time I stayed here. We stayed here because going ski. The staffs here are all fantastically great. Super helpful. They even upgrade us to the lake side room.  
Everything u need included in the room.  The fridge not cold enough. But the staff so nice will bring me bucket of ice every night.  We stayed here for 4 nights. 
Highly recommended. 
Next time I might try their other two hotels.  
One small issue is they have a construction site outside   It was here last Dec I came and it’s still here. It might have some noise at night and morning. Not non stop noise. But might have few big pound.

msg:Very convenient location for accessing the indoor skiing facility at the mall across the street. Hotel is clean and modern. Only drawback is that they charge kids for buffet (both breakfast and dinner) even though most hotels in China do not charge kids under 1.2 meters because little kids don’t eat much and attracting families is good business.. so it is strange that they would charge little kids under 1.2 meters. Perhaps they need more hotel competition in the area.

msg:The hotel was amazing from the moment we arrived. Special shout out to Anny Chen for making our check in incredibly pleasant. If there is one area the hotel doesn't fall short, it would be their staff and professional service.

However, where the hotel can improve will be: (1) Water pressure because there is nothing more satisfying than coming back from a long day to an amazing shower. It is not horrible, but definitely not great. (2) The air-conditioning seems to have been limited to 24 degrees. No matter how low we set the temperature or how high we increase the fan speed, the temperature could not go below 24 degrees. Most people fall asleep at around 21 degrees so I hope this could be improved. (3) Finally, the walls are not sound proof enough. This makes having a quiet evening rather challenging.

For me, I would say Snow world is much fun than Water world. I found taking metro is also very convenient and clean cabin, it takes about 1 hr from GZ South Station and then take didi to there in 5 mins. It's my new experience in taking public transportation in China. It will choose it more in future.

Additionally, there was no conditioner provided on the first night, and even on the second and third nights, it was still not refilled. We were very disappointed with these conditions.

We didn't have much experience with the service as we were out every day and only returned to the hotel for showering and sleeping. However, we noticed that the staff was cheerful all the time.

The hotel lobby is grand, room size is spacious and breakfast buffet has everything you can think of, Western and Chinese cuisine. But the highlight was the service, from polite cleaning staff to helpful concierge. We were particularly happy to have the good fortune of meeting reception staff Melly 小玲, she really went above and beyond to help us secure rooms for a second visit, as well as lots of to-ing and fro-ing for transport arrangements -- Melly always responded quickly and professionally, and with so much patience and kindness -- she really provided 6-star service!!!

It was the first time I checked into this hotel on the first day. I entered the room around 2pm, grabbed some things and left the room. It was already 10pm when I returned to the hotel. I found that the air conditioner was broken, so I called the front desk. The front desk said that a maintenance man would come up. The master came to repair it for about half an hour and it turned out that it could not be repaired. I was asked to call the front desk to ask for a room change. The front desk lady said that she would notify the manager. After another 40 minutes, I called the front desk again and the front desk said that the manager would find me. Okay. After waiting again, the manager called me in five minutes. I told me the reason. The manager actually told me that the weather is getting cold now, so you can sleep with the window open. I was a little angry after hearing this. If the light breaks, will you give me a call? I settled for a foreign candle, and after fifteen minutes someone rang the doorbell and gave me another room. I moved to a room, but the new room was worse. It didn't seem to have been cleaned, but it was too late and too tired, so Never mind! 😮💨

Wait two days

Because my wife had a birthday today, she left the hotel in the morning. Before leaving, she notified the front desk that the room needed to be cleaned. By about five o'clock, the room had not been cleaned. I called the front desk again, and when I returned to the room after dinner at eight o'clock in the evening, no cleaning was done. Clean 😱

So disappointed 😔

The tea bags are expired

The service was very considerate, there was a lantern riddle game in the lobby, and the children were very happy to get a doll. The twin room we booked was designed so that the beds can be joined together. The two beds are put together to form a 2.2-meter large bed room, so children are not afraid of falling off the bed. and! The room is also equipped with a 1.2-meter (probably) sofa bed, which can be accommodated by a family of four. The hotel building is very unique and the scenery at night is also very beautiful!

Everyone was very polite...and answered my questions enthusiastically! Especially Xiaoling, the guest relations director... made people feel valued during their stay and after leaving... (I can't express it perfectly in words)
**I wanted to take a bath... so I asked if there were any bath bags provided... The receptionist kindly asked me if I needed bath salts... They could also provide them... which made me feel more at ease and comfortable to take a bath...
I chose the one that includes breakfast. The breakfast is in buffet style. There are many choices. I think the taste is okay. For dinner, I chose the restaurants in the hotel for dinner two days... They were Chinese restaurant and Thai restaurant. The Chinese restaurant mainly specializes in Cantonese cuisine. I bought their set meal for 2-3 people as a group. Compared to the set meal in Macau, the portion size is simply huge! It tastes good. I can’t finish it until my stomach bulges! The Thai restaurant mainly specializes in Thai food. I also had the set menu. The portions were also large. But the taste was very good! The endless cold cuts were packed back to the room for a late night snack! Both restaurants have their own standards. In addition, I also tried their spa massage. The environment and massage techniques are good. Especially the aromatherapy. It smells very good. The technicians are not hard-selling like those in beauty salons. It can really relax the body and mind. .
P.S. If you take the high-speed rail (train), it is recommended to get off at Guangzhou North Railway Station. It will be closer if you call an online car-hailing service.

Secondly, the 1.1-meter bed in the basic room type is really outrageous.
This hotel charges ¥50/100/day for room upgrade for free. Basically, you can’t get it. You have to find the platform to negotiate many times before getting a room with a normal bed for ¥1.35, but it doesn’t have a lake view. A normal bed with a lake view is estimated to cost Make up the price difference of 50-100 more
Finally, there are quite a lot of waiters and their attitudes are very good. I recommend the breakfast in the Chinese restaurant and the dinner for two in the Thai restaurant is also good👍🏻

msg:1. The hotel lobby is very upscale and a**ospheric. The rooms are okay, but not big. The sanitation is not bad. The toilet is relatively large, separated from wet and dry. The bed is also very comfortable, and the sofa is relatively small! There are so many channels that can be watched on TV, children like it very much! But some details are still different from the real five-star hotel. For example, there is no bath salt, and there seems to be no toilet exhaust fan! ￼
2. The buffet dinner will cost 198 yuan per resident. To be honest, I personally feel that it is not worth it, but it is not too bad. There are not many seafood, no salmon, and the most important thing is that the beef steak, pork chop and chicken chop are very good. It was hard, not tender at all, and it was hard to eat. The most eaten during the whole process turned out to be the strawberry flavored ice cream and French fries! Turtle jelly is also available! Just eat more shrimp!
3. The breakfast in a five-star hotel has always been something that I attach great importance to. Personally, I feel that the breakfast is not as good as the dinner, and there are not even sun eggs! They are all round eggs! Residents seem to be 100 yuan per person, and a member who joins a member will get a free breakfast for 49 yuan! You can inquire when checking in!
4. When checking out, I can leave the hotel at 11:00 that night for free. This service is good. It is about 6-700 meters to the water world nearby, and it is a little further to go to the park! Anyway, I don’t know how to walk. Going to Rongchuangmao is free for 2 hours before joining the membership, and 8 yuan an hour after that!
5. I took a lot of photos for your reference. When I was making a guide, there were too few photos for reference. Some people always said that the buffet was good, and some people said it was not good. They all went with the mentality of trying it out. Overall, it’s pretty good. Be sure to buy the package that includes breakfast, dinner and tickets. It’s the most cost-effective￼!

msg:After shopping around, and comparing the three hotels in Sunac City, Shibage is indeed better. I heard from the service staff that the boss of Sunac usually stays here, so the service management requirements are higher.
💁 Service: The lobby is brighter, the restaurant is better, the service is really good, the luggage pick-up is very timely, and we wait patiently during breastfeeding, and actively ask us if we want to bring water out; the front desk service is also very good, especially the customer service AMY, Due to some special circumstances, we were able to extend our room stay. We had a buffet dinner and breakfast. The restaurant had a rich selection of dishes, and the dishes and bones were collected in a timely manner. The service staff were also very nice~
👉 Room: The room is also spacious, the balcony is large, and the lake view is okay, but the deserted swimming pool downstairs is a bit distracting...
👉 Price: Ctrip’s room plus breakfast and dinner package is very cost-effective. It is said that if you inform your child’s birthday in advance when checking in, you can also get a birthday cake~
👉 Location: Very close to Sunac Mall, about 5 minutes walk, very convenient for fun and food
👉 Overall, the kids were very happy staying here for two days~
💁 However, there was a small problem when booking. It may be the agent's problem. There were twists and turns, but I like Ctrip's service. They tried their best to coordinate and were able to put themselves in their shoes and help~~

The room has been upgraded, and the soft drinks in the original room are free, so there is no waste of drinking. The air conditioner is not cold enough for a long time, it may be too hot outside at the end of July.
The hotel seems to have no other facilities, the swimming pool is deserted, the lake view is just a lake, no flowers, no fountains, nothing. The bar in the hotel has no special features, it looks like a lobby, the 2230 bar is closed, and there is no way to ask the room service for a few bottles of beer, and I forgot that there is a direct delivery of takeaway👻. In the evening, I wanted to eat the cup noodles I bought. Remember to buy a domestic brand to use the fork. I asked the service desk to get a fork but said that the restaurant was closed at 2230 and could not provide it. It was the first time that I could not get tableware in a hotel. The small dishes in the Chinese restaurant are good, but the dinner buffet is very average, and the children are very disappointed. There are no scrambled eggs for breakfast, but there are a lot of full food and whole grains, and there are not many choices of drinks. The child just stopped eating the next day, haha!
The advantage is that it is the closest to Sunac Wu. Because the road is being built, there is no middle place to pass across the entire road. If you want to go to the restaurant on the opposite side, you have to make a big circle.
There should be mostly homestays on the opposite side. The shopping malls and restaurants over there are all vacant, and only the first few are open.

For this price, I didn't have any expectations, but I was really overjoyed when I got there.
The cross-border bus is taken by Sunac Mao. The shopping mall is really big. Then, I saw the beautiful appearance of the hotel. It is within 10 minutes from the drop-off place to the hotel.
The design of the lobby is grand and luxurious, and it is so big. There is a bell boy at the entrance to help with luggage. My husband told me that I need a suitcase.
The front desk service is so fast, so polite, and with a smile.
When I checked in, I found out that there is a discount for dinner buffet for the guests, so I will talk about it in another article.
I am good at listening to Mandarin, and the lady who helped me check in quickly explained the package content to me in vernacular.
After entering the room, I feel very clean. The room is so big, and the bed is so big, 6 feet big. The most surprising thing is that there is a terrace, but unfortunately it is too hot, and I have to go back to the room after sitting on the terrace for a while.
There is a usb voltage potential next to the bed, and there are 3 wires connected to the left and right.
The bathroom is very big. Although there is no window, the wet and dry are separated, and the bathtub is so big, it is enough for my husband who is so tall. (Explain how big I always say? Really...) The shower has sufficient water power and hot water quickly, and the towels are very clean.
The breakfast is so rich.

The only downside is that there is no swimming pool.

This hotel is really perfect. It is the best hotel I have encountered recently. I have the opportunity to come back again.

The lady at the front desk helped to register as a member and bought it at the member price, which is affordable. Stayed in the original room for one night, the hotel sent fruit, thank you. It takes about five minutes to walk from the hotel to Sunac Mall, and about 2 kilometers to the park, which is very convenient. The breakfast and buffet dinner are also very good. It is nice to take a walk by the lake behind the hotel after dinner.

In addition, the sound insulation is not very good (or is it a problem with the quality of people?) I heard a lot of people chatting loudly in the corridor, and chatting non-stop.
But the hotel as a whole is pretty good.

msg:Let me first talk about the reason for the bad review. Less than half an hour after checking in that day, someone kept knocking on the door for about a minute. I went to the door and asked who it was. I only heard clearly whether I needed ** service. I said no! The person outside continued to ask, "Are you staying alone?" I said I called the police!
I was really scared. I couldn't believe that this hotel would be like this... Fortunately, I have the habit of locking the door as soon as I entered!
Then I called the front desk to complain. The front desk said that they would reply after verification. About 10 minutes later, the lobby manager replied that it was definitely not their service staff. They said that it might be a guest who went to the wrong room. I was speechless and called the police directly to report that the hotel might involve ** service. The police directly denied that it was impossible 🤔 After I finished speaking, the police said they would come to see it.
After hanging up the phone with the police, the lobby manager came to my door to apologize to me and said a lot. I said I didn't accept it and would not open the door before the police came...
Finally, the police came and explained that it was a concierge, an intern, on the first night shift. A guest called the concierge service, and he went up to the wrong room... I asked which room you were originally going to go to? They couldn't tell me and said they forgot.
It simply crushed the customer's IQ.
As a remedial measure, when we came back the next night, we were given a fruit plate in the four rooms and they cleaned it up thoroughly; on the third day, they just left it in a mess, and they didn't even clean up the fruit cores I had eaten...
From beginning to end, they never asked for any compensation, never made any requests, and refused the hotel's afternoon tea or anything like that, but the fact that they didn't clean up the fruit cores was speechless.

It takes ten minutes to walk to Sunac Mall. The entire third floor is full of restaurants, which is very convenient for eating. Sunac Ice and Snow World is located in Sunac Maoli, so it is very close to play. The overall experience of staying is good. It may be more lively on weekends, but there are few people on weekdays and it is clean.

msg:Xiaoling, who arranged the check-in, was warm and thoughtful. The other staff were also very polite. They also worked hard to help collect the express delivery. Most of the staff can speak Cantonese, which is very good.
This trip is to celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday. The hotel also provided some arrangements. Thank you very much.
In fact, this trip is mainly to go to Rexue Miracle to play in the snow. The hotel is only a five to ten minute walk away, which is very convenient.
The neighborhood looks like a residential area for people's livelihood, so I always go to the nearby Sunac Mall.
The interior decoration of the hotel is very high and magnificent, the lobby is very stylish, and the room decoration is also to five-star standards. Chris**as is approaching, the Chris**as a**osphere is very strong, and there is a beautiful Chris**as tree.
However, as a high-end hotel, let’s talk about the areas that can be improved.
First, there is no refrigerator in the room, which is a bit surprising.
Second, bath products are not disposable in small bottles; although there is a bathtub, those products are in large bottles and fixed in the shower room, so how to use them?
Thirdly, I also want to complain about the breakfast restaurant. First of all, there are too many people. There are no staff to guide you when you enter, and you don’t know which seats are occupied and which seats can be seated. Although the handsome guy in the restaurant was very happy to ask him for help, I have to give him a thumbs up for his service awareness. There is also a variety of food, which is still not rich enough by five-star hotel standards. But the food quality is pretty good.
Fourth, the air conditioner in the room is a bit difficult to operate. It is hot and cold and difficult to adjust to the right temperature. Also, the do not disturb button in front of the door is broken. I have to run to the toilet to press the button.
Fourth, there seems to be no air extraction system in the toilet, and the strong smell lingers for a long time after doing important things.
All in all, it is cost-effective and can be used for one stay.

1. The traditional check-in at 3:00 pm and check-out at 12:00 noon will not be delayed or advanced because you bring a small bb;
2. The lake-view room I booked is strictly considered a "Sunac Mao" room. The balcony is very large and you can see a corner of the lake view, and the angle is not good. At night, you can see the fireworks of Sunac Paradise (also a corner);
3. The attitude of the staff is very good, whether it is the lobby or the guest room staff, they are warm and polite;
4. Geographical location, it is very convenient to go to Sunac Mao’s Ice and Snow World and Water World, but it takes a long walk to go to Sunac Park. Although it is called a group, there is no shuttle bus. very unfriendly;
5. The core of the hotel is not like a five-star hotel, and the greenway and swimming pool in the public area are in a semi-abandoned state; the advantage of the interior of the room is that the area is not bad, but the disadvantage is that there are cockroaches in the sanitation, and the sound insulation of the room is average.
6. Parent-child activities in the hotel: There is a Hamburg DIY activity and an educational toy activity in the executive lounge on the 11th floor. The promotion may not be enough and no one will participate; there is a children's playroom next to the gymnasium on the first floor. It will open, and there is a cassia seed sand pool inside, which is okay; there is also a small play area in the buffet, and the sanitation is very average and needs to be improved;

msg:The service of the hotel is good, and the staff are very polite, because Shuwa strongly requested to extend the stay for one night because of the fun, and it was done at the front desk after 11:00. Ms. Chen Manling, the receptionist at the front desk, helped us check several platforms, and patiently found the best deal The price helped us book a room, very nice. The little brother who checked in and parked saw that we were going to stay for three nights, so he directly extended the access card for us to the check-out day, which was so considerate. On the first day, we had breakfast in the hotel cafeteria. The environment was comfortable and varied, and there were surprises. It's a pity that there were too many guests staying in the next day, so it was changed to the banquet hall, and everything was cold, not to mention, the big round tables one by one made the dining hall feel like a rush:(

It is very nice to choose the Thai food in the hotel for the New Year's Eve dinner! 5 star service is just different! Watching the lion dance on the morning of the first day of the new year, I felt the real Chinese New Year a**osphere!

The room is very clean, the facilities are very new, the lake view is also beautiful, very close to Sunac Mao and Sunac Paradise. The breakfast is very rich, combining Chinese and Western. The staff immediately guided us to the vacant seat as soon as we entered the restaurant and asked us what drinks we needed. The experience was great. There are managers who follow up patiently before and after check-in, and other staff of the hotel are also very enthusiastic, answering questions, and providing first-class service experience.

msg:I stayed for many nights in a row, but because it was an itinerary booked in advance, and because all the itineraries were arranged, there was no way to change it, or I might not have stayed in this hotel for so long, and I felt that the cost performance was not high, mainly because A five-star hotel is not equipped with five-star service and feeling. Every morning there are too many people for breakfast, and the breakfast is not delicious! In the last few days, I didn't even go to grab breakfast! The most speechless thing is that in the five-star hotel, when I woke up in the morning and went to the toilet, there was a Xiaoqiang (cockroach) on the toilet. Later, I found a lot of Xiaoqiang eggs on the floor of the room. I was speechless for a moment, but the hotel seemed to be used to it. After expressing my strong dissatisfaction, I changed my room, and the first time I changed it was a downgraded room. This way of handling it was also an eye-opener! In short, staying at the five-star Sunac is a failed choice! Guangzhou Sunac has entered the blacklist! ! ! This is also the worst five-star hotel I have stayed in so far. I also hope that Ctrip will be stricter when it comes to star ratings, and not let consumers pay! ! !

msg:A very bad living experience. On the second day of the stay, the child went to the outdoor swimming pool of the hotel for a swim. After a while, he came up. Both hands and eight fingers were injured. The reason was the scratches caused by the falling off of the tiles in the hotel swimming pool. At the same time, another tourist's foot was scratched and bleeding. Under such circumstances, the hotel still did not have the awareness to repair and rectify the swimming pool, and after I made a request for refunding the room fee on the day, I kept emphasizing that the swimming pool of my hotel was outsourced. When they go out, they always shirk their responsibility with the attitude of a third party to convey information. A five-star hotel, such a sense of service, is really staggering. We stay in hotels very frequently in a year, and almost all five-star hotels in China have experienced it. After most hotels have problems and situations, they apologize and then give customers a satisfactory plan, and the matter is over, not blindly like this. To shirk responsibility and not make rectification in time after the event, is this waiting for the rectification when the life of the subsequent guests is in danger? Does bleeding and scratching seem inconsequential to them?

The service of the lady at the front desk is very good, and she takes the initiative to introduce the surrounding environment. You can decide to dine in the hotel according to your own preferences, and there will be a free shuttle service by car!

msg:Having stayed in so many hotels on Ctrip, this is the first review. Very satisfied with price, service and hardware. The room is facing the lake with a good view. Originally, the birthday arrangement needed to be notified to the hotel one day in advance. I applied for it in the morning of the check-in day, and I also helped to make it out when I checked in at night. The children were very happy to see the cake and the arrangement. The buffet breakfast the next morning was also very rich. Special thanks to the lady at the front desk (the name seems to be Billie) for helping to delay the check-out time until 2:00 pm, the room service staff who delivered the children's slippers and toiletries, and the restaurant cleaner who helped lead my two children to the bathroom.
        Next time I come to Sunac, I will choose Shiboge!

After checking in, I didn't expect that the birthday cake presented was freshly made, very fresh and tasted good. The customer service staff is in place, and the children's slippers, bathtub covers, etc. can be matched. When leaving the store, even an eyebrow knife will call me to confirm whether it is missing, like it!

🚗 Transportation: The hotel can park for free. It is very close to Sunac Mall, but it is a bit far to go to the park. Mao's parking is free for 3 hours, and the park is charged. Conscience suggests that you can park and go to Mao and then go to the park, or take a hotel shuttle bus.
🍃Environment: A very comprehensive tourist resort with all facilities well maintained. The breakfast is very good, fresh and rich. Satisfied 👏🏻

msg:The lobby of the hotel is very luxurious, and the service is also OK, but there are too many people during the Spring Festival, and many details can't keep up. The breakfast is the most peculiar thing I've ever eaten, it's similar to a group meal 😂 In a large banquet hall, a few long tables are moved, and everyone goes to get something to eat, and the product is a little far from the five-star. China's star hotel road really still has a long way to go. The location of the room is good, the view is OK. The hotel also included two park tickets. I didn't understand it at first, but it's better to book entertainment tickets. I don't really catch a cold in the paradise, because there are Chimelong in Panyu and Zhuhai in front, and it becomes not very good there. Check-in was really long because we were in the most crowded times. A friend only checked in at night, and it was done in a few minutes.

The room is spacious and bright, and the balcony has a good view;
During the Spring Festival holiday, there are many guests, but the service is timely and thoughtful;
The buffet breakfast is of good quality. My personal favorite is fried dough sticks and pork offal porridge. Freshly ground coffee is fast and good.

Disadvantages: 1. Although there is a balcony, it has little effect, and there is no small clothes drying equipment (it will not affect the appearance);
2. There is no parent-child room with a big bed and a small bed, which is not convenient for family travel.

1) For the deluxe double room, the hotel upgraded to the executive deluxe double room on the 11th floor for free, with a good view. I like the bathtub very much.

2) The breakfast is really good. Freshly squeezed milkshakes, freshly baked waffles, Danish cherry crisps are all delicious, and Chinese-style ones are also delicious.

The hotel is very close to the ski resort, but there is also a shuttle bus that can take you to the ski resort from the hotel, which is only two or three minutes away by car. Let’s talk about the hotel, because it’s a new hotel, so the facilities and everything are very new, the rooms are also very big, especially the balcony, here I want to thank our lady at the front desk ivis for helping me upgrade to a lake-view room with a big balcony. The lake view is beautiful. My favorite of the hotel is the 24-hour gym. No matter what time you finish your dinner, you can rest for an hour to exercise. You can also book the venue late at night. The equipment is very new and really great. Let’s talk about the hotel breakfast. There are everything. Soy milk in a hotel determines its grade. Soy milk can be drunk and is freshly squeezed, but it’s better to season it without sugar. In short, it’s pretty good. Plenty~ I booked a room with a snow ticket, so I feel that I can enjoy a full set of leisure and entertainment activities when I stay in a hotel. It’s pretty good, and I recommend bringing children or friends over. Tips: Skiing feels more crowded on weekdays than on weekends many? ? ?

Service awareness is not strong, staying for two days, after 12 o'clock, you still have to refresh the room card at the front desk. Either the room forgot to send mineral water or to put paper towels. The most convenient is the free shuttle bus, and among the three hotels, Jiahua has the most time points.

One day in the snow world, one day in the water world, and one night is the best choice. It is suitable for bringing children, the hotel environment is very good, and the lobby is very beautiful! The room has a big balcony and it feels great! The toilet, bathtub, and shower are three separate spaces, which are very suitable for adults to take a shower and children to soak in the bathtub at the same time, each taking what they need without interfering with each other. The attitude of the service staff is also very good. I know that the children come out to play and wake up late and cannot eat the breakfast in the hotel, so I directly ordered the breakfast without breakfast. Sure enough, they slept until 11:30! The hotel is very close to Sunac Mao, only 5 minutes’ walk away. Parking is free. It is recommended that you park your car at the hotel and walk to Sunac to play. I stupidly parked in Sunac for a parking fee of RMB 4 per hour. You can save dozens of yuan in a day😄. After I got home, I got a call from Miss Melly, asking if I was staying well, very considerate!

Breakfast told us that it was full and we were asked to take a spin around another conference hall (no one was leading it), but then we were given permission to go in immediately after us because it was not easy to get down the stairs with a stroller (which means "the restaurant was full" for different guests), Change the location to bear it, the breakfast quality is quite simple, and the hot milk bucket empty, I asked several waiters said that they will add, until they finished eating no one added. Finally sent a bowl of dumplings, the child ate a mouthful of vomit, can only ha ha. 4. The outdoor pool is not open, there is no indoor pool, and you have to go to the next Wenhua shared.

衛生方面，我們房間發生了小插曲，需然Front Desk manager 很快處理了，但衛生情況真要加倍留心改善。

我們主要去滑雪，酒店去商場滑雪場很方便，不用5分鐘便到了。

我們訂的是酒店套餐，有三個小時的滑雪，前台小玲美女很好👍🏻，詳細跟我們講解如何使用還送了半個小時的滑雪換衣服時間。另外還給我門退房時間延遲到兩點，還送了水果盆給我們❤️最後還加了微信，讓我們有什麼不明白可以直接微信找她。很親切，有耐心！
酒店的浴缸很舒服，我們滑了一天的雪，泡浴，太爽了！！床也很大很舒服，睡著都快起不來了😂電視也很多頻道，好喜歡躺床上煲劇的感覺！對了還有露台，露台對著湖，不想吹冷氣，可是在陽台的沙發上躺，也是超爽的！
另外有一點不方便的是，外賣不能直接送到房間門口，必須到酒店大堂取，如果有外賣機器人送上門就好了！
下次滑雪還會選這家酒店！對了，早餐也好吃😋符合我的胃口！

msg:整體而言，我對這次的住宿體驗感到相當滿意。

首先，這家酒店的地理位置非常方便，距離融創滑雪地很近，這讓我們能夠輕鬆地前往滑雪場，省去了不必要的交通麻煩。
房間的整潔程度令人滿意，空間大小也剛剛好，非常適合我們這個四口之家的住宿需求。我們還非常喜歡房間附帶的小露台，從那裡可以欣賞到湖泊的美景，讓我們感到身心愉悅。

然而，唯一讓我們感到不滿意的是早餐的安排。我們的住宿價格包含了兩位大人的早餐，但對於小朋友的早餐則需要額外支付費用。
更令人不滿的是，我們入住期間為期兩晚，第一天的早餐他們按照兩位小童的價格收費，但到了第二天，他們卻以我女兒身高等同成人為由收取了成人價格，這讓我感到有些不公平。

他們在早餐方面的收費政策需要改進，以確保對每位客人的公平對待。希望他們能夠對這一點進行反思和改善。

缺點1: 酒店沒有張貼穿梭巴士的任何資料或站牌，在融創茂那邊也找不到站；
缺點2: 中菜廳沒開門，想飲酒店早茶，依職員指示，走過過崎嶇的裝修路段，到達很遠的另一幢建築物裡的會議廳才能飲早茶，而且又貴又不好吃，完全沒有酒店的水平，唯一一讚是早茶的職員都很友善。

一到櫃檯，陳曼玲小姐好有耐性以廣東話解答所有問題，不錯不錯。酒店出去行一個路口度，通條馬路已經係融創茂。融創茂地下入去，中間已經係水世界同埋雪世界，行前啲仲有一個好大嘅波波池，第二層有體育世界，行前啲有一間有真羊駝的店。第三層全部嘢食，可以搵幾間試，又好食又平。暑假太熱，今次末玩融創樂園。下次啦。建議可考慮水世界玩一日，然後食吓嘢。樂園一日、雪世界可加體育世界一日。
我揀咗四點幾酒店門口直接上直通巴返香港，返到去八點幾，食完晚飯返屋企啱啱好。
總括來說，非常值得同小朋友去玩3-4日嘅地方。水世界可以自帶水槍拖鞋入。雪世界有提供雪褸、褲、鞋及滑雪用具，自己記住要帶手套及着多條長褲及厚衫，特別係小朋友。
會再揀依間酒店，因為真係好近，等小朋友玩完一日食好野，早啲返酒店唔使咁攰。如果仲有精力，酒店都有游泳池。好似有健身室。

至於酒店服務質素卻不理想，打電話到前台要求比多一對拖鞋，重覆打了3次也沒有人拿上房，最後在房間走廊遇上房務員再問一次才給我們。

另外，我們訂了兩晚酒店，到了第二晚酒店門卡竟然失效了。由於滑雪一整天已經很累，很希望快點回房休息，卻要在門外久等才能進房，這個體驗實在不好受！

離融創茂很近，走路去滑雪非常方便。融創茂的商業配套也很完善，孩子跟着教練滑雪、大人逛街看電影，這種假期過氣來很舒坦。

早餐選擇多，吃飽沒問題，但沒有一樣是好吃的，而且大部份都不熱。早餐8:45落去食都要排隊等位，快則5分鐘，慢則20分鐘，我們住了2天，2天都要等。餐廳經理很努力安排座位，但酒店根本不理餐廳容納人數oversell早餐房，而且很多人特別是家庭客幫還未到的親友拿位，他們食完親友都未到，結果霸佔整個早餐時段的座位。應該未人齊就不給進，或者多少人到就給多少座位，不然對其他人齊的房客很不公平。

酒店位置方便滑雪，會再入住，但不會再吃這裡的早餐。

其次，酒店的房間衛生程度非常出色。無論是床上用品還是衛生間，都保持著高標準的清潔和整潔，給人一種舒適和放心的感覺。

此外，融創施柏閣的景觀令人驚艷。酒店位於寧靜的環境中，周圍綠樹成蔭，景色優美。無論是從客房窗戶還是酒店的公共區域，都能欣賞到令人心曠神怡的美景。

最後，酒店的大堂氛圍給人一種泰國度假酒店的感覺。大堂設計獨特，舒適的氛圍讓人感到放鬆和愉悅。進入酒店的一刻，就彷彿置身於度假的環境中，給人帶來愉快的入住體驗。

總之，廣州融創施柏閣以其優越的地理位置、出色的衛生條件、迷人的景觀和舒適的大堂氛圍，讓客人能夠享受到一個愉快和放鬆的住宿體驗。無論是商務旅行還是休閒度假，這家酒店絕對是一個令人滿意的選擇。

我買的套票包含水上樂園和主題樂園再加自助早餐，抵住抵玩抵食之選。

現在是淡季, 我們十二時到達已經可以馬上上房, 不用等到三時。是湖景房, 可以望到右邊的融創茂, 非常安靜。聽說附近有很多修路工程, 半夜會非常嘈吵, 但沒有影響我們這邊。

酒店又有班車去融創貿1號門或4號門, 方便去融創樂園, 但要先打電話到總機或到前台先預訂。

酒店的自助早餐種類繁多非常好, 大讚!  早餐比較晚餐出色更多。

酒店服務非常好, 每個員工都非常友善, 盡力幫忙!  我不懂的地方,他們也盡量解答。酒店讓我延遲到下午二時退房, 方便我早上的行程。

特別感謝 Lori Zhao, 因為我的疏忽令她東奔西跑為我週璇, 把問題解決了, 令我感受到顧客至上的專業服務精神。

    房間的佈置很舒服，床鋪很乾凈！床墊用的金可兒睡着不比威斯汀差。 唯一就是沙發雖然難洗但是不妨礙我覺得它臟… 以及陽台的椅子雖然不是特別臟但是我也坐不下去… 廁所的蓬頭比較普通但是還算好用，但是還是建議打掃衞生的時候看一眼如果有臟的黑點能刷下來。 
    整體非常好，舒適的入住體驗。 唯一美中不足的可能是咱家的吹風機實在差了些… 吹着就掉了 嘖嘖

房間大，枕頭有點軟，床底有垃圾，不過沒霉沒蚊沒小昆蟲。走廊隔音有點差。下次來融創，還會再訂這裡。
中港通過境巴士，酒店裡就有櫃檯，酒店是首站，交通＄110左右，非常方便。

msg:每次來融創滑雪都會選這家酒店。大概步行八分鐘已到融創茂商場，十分方便。酒店富麗堂皇，房間寬敞舒適。最重要前台服務員親切有禮，有問題也會耐心解答。特別是陳小姐，要不是她幫忙教我去团購，恐怕很難跟朋友一同入住且享有較便宜的滑雪住房優惠，也感謝陳小姐貼心安排讓我們可提早一點取房，雖然中間岀了一些小插曲，Jerry先生也積極幫忙解決問題，相當有交帶。下次來滑雪也要選這家入住。

msg:我訂了兩間房，我要求相連房，但要自費，我從來未試過相連房要自費，因為兩家人都有小朋友覺得一齊住開心些，就唯有自費，咁唔好彩酒店泳池有問題要關閉，如果想遊水可以去附近另一間酒店，酒店會有車接送、不過咁唔方便，就沒有去，check in 時因為我要求相連房的關係、另一間還未打掃完，所以只能给我一間，咁算啦不緊要因為我們都趕住去樂園玩，職員話打掃完會幫我開埋相連房門，到時可以通過去，點知我哋在樂園晚上7點回來時候遇著落雨，因為都要行十五分鐘多些，到了酒店入房看到沒有幫我們開相連房門🚪、又沒有隔離房匙咭，小朋友好凍等沖涼等到冷親，致電前台，等了很久一會兒先給我，之後八點半左右落去自助晚餐，本身我報了兩位小朋友晚餐另外加錢，每位$98，不過我仔仔入到佢已經打晒冷震發燒，￼當時未攞嘢食，￼職員都在我哋張枱清潔緊上一手的碗碟🥣、所以我即刻出去講，取消一位小朋友因為發燒打晒冷震食唔到，￼職員話到時退房同返前台講返一位就可以啦，點知退時職員￼話要致電餐廳部問，又說98是優惠價錢，可能要計回正價，咁即係唔想扣啫，當時我哋未攞食物，服務員還在執枱同職員她說到時退房同前台說就可以，現在這樣說，之後又話會致電給我會扣我幾多錢按金話會打給我，因為她未問到餐廳部，而又不想我久等，因為我們還要去第二間酒店check in仲要預約了融雪時間，所以她話會致電給我，等了兩天還未覆，戶口又未顯示退回按金，說真我第二晚住逸米米公寓仲好過你，地點仲方便、勁近融創5分鐘就到，服務又好又有效率各樣都好過你，他還是公寓，你是酒店，真的差這間酒店 ，我一定唔會推介施栢閣給朋友，真心我會推介逸米米公寓，又近融創步行5分鐘就到，公寓留下又有好多野食，和按腳店，最重要人哋真係效率好，服務都好好😌

不過坦白説，華住會金卡的一些會員福利什麼的很多隱藏條款的感覺，感覺有點不夠大方。比如送個早餐什麼的，一個房間衹有一份（感覺是針對商務客的優惠了），最重要還要通過APP下單才可以享受福利。對於第一天入住就入會金卡的住客會員情以何堪啊……本身確實打算給的負評，不過會員服務人員的工作態度，讓我改變主意，給點好評！

設施：設施非常一般，圖片都不想拍，因為第一天去極度影響我出遊的旅行

餐廳性價比非常高，比對面那個融創茂划算。泰餐廳也不錯，自助餐廳性價比高，所有工作人員都温柔，有禮貌，房間訂餐也方便，小龍蝦價格跟點買賣一樣，當然點這裏

衞生：房間內很多肉眼可見的污漬，進房間後也是潮潮濕濕的。還有就是，餐廳的小童餐具，還有油漬的都敢拿給我們。呵呵看圖片
設施：別的不説，這酒店沒空調的，房間衹能開抽風，廣州現在天氣接近30度，還帶潮濕，整個酒店竟然沒空調（大堂也沒有）。向前台人員反應，他們説怕其他客人冷？？？還説晚上冷的要蓋被子，叫我開陽台門。。我們房間是靠馬路的，開門很吵，其次蚊蟲的問題。熱的小孩無法午睡，一個晚上在幫他擦汗。不説其他五星酒店了，一個最普通的7天酒店，在冬天很冷的時候，也能開空調吧。這點真是無語至極！！！整個住店的過程身上黏糊糊的。房間內的裝修一點點也沒有高檔的意思。
還有吹風機，絕了，20年前的那種吧，吹兩秒插頭還自己跳出來

服務：跟服務員反應房間空調的事情，就隨便找個師傅來應付，看了等於沒看
check in的時候問多兩句關於雪世界門票的事，就叫我自己上網查，他們不買票

唯一值得讚揚的是接送去融創匯的司機們，很快就安排好車，態度也很好，很周到！

總之，這酒店真的很爛，不推薦大家入住，廣州的還是當日來回吧，帶娃就更不推薦了，畢竟衞生真的不行，還沒空調

服務：酒店其他服務有待提高，辦理停車手續繁瑣，多人排隊，如今已經科技發達時代，就不能弄個掃碼嗎？多位客人等排長隊，至少耗費20～30分鐘辦理，不該是五星酒店會出現的問題……還有早餐自助餐居然還需要在門口排長龍……也是無語，不是像其他五星酒店刷卡就進去嗎？還一個一個手寫登記，又有時間限制！諸多客人都在外等候奇怪為什麼要這樣……感覺就是細節方面還是不夠。第一回住這樣的五星級酒店，給了五星的價格入住，沒有五星的體驗就是了……
環境：環境還是可以的，就是房間的燈比較暗
衞生：房間和大堂衞生還是可以的，不過泳池，室內泳池，特別是室內泳池水臟到渾濁……我們去增城嘉華度假村那麼多人遊玩，水都是清澈的，不能白為什麼五星級酒店小小的室內池會這麼臟，為什麼不換水，難道大家入住都是來睡一晚就回家嗎，不是玩一下水和樂園嗎？體驗感太糟糕了，感覺不會有下回了

1、入住：2點20到現場，堪比快捷酒店的前台，三四個前台服務員忙的手忙腳亂，現場人山人海，排隊到將近3點20拿到卡，排隊差不多一小時，現場又悶又熱。稍微和前台投訴一下這個情況，甩下三個字“問經理”，態度一級棒，讓大家氣足滿滿入房。
入住：房間中規中矩，廁所面積達到這個價位酒店標準，可惜沖涼的温度僅勉強達到人體可接受温度下限。
早餐：第二天想吃個早餐再出發滑雪，九點鐘唔到落到一樓。我頂！排隊吃早餐的竟然都排到電梯間，十點半就停止供應早餐，直接決定返房訓覺。建議七點鐘落去吃早餐。
總體：差差差，性價比極低，早知道這樣不如住個快捷酒店，服務員態度不專業，態度不如快捷酒店。

本人從業澳門五星級酒店十年前台經理，個人角度看，辦入住手續的不知道是supervisor還是manager態度不如旁邊穿旗袍的普通員工。為什麼要槓客人房型問題呢，雙床和高級雙床一不一樣客人會知道嗎？Queen size king size double bed twin bed的區別客人會知道嗎？訂的房型直接報客人就好了，訂高級雙床你報的雙床房這不是讓客人有question了嘛？這位小姐説是一樣的，我的理解是房間都是一樣，床的大小不一樣。（也有可能一樣，我沒住過其他類型的房對比不了）用你知道的點槓客人不知道的點，贏得了嘴贏不了服務，這也是很多管理層的通病。大堂cake行政長廊那邊的服務員態度很好，照顧細緻到位。融創第一次體驗給我感覺還是很一般的。融創水上世界和體育世界體驗不好，管理和整體體驗感不如長X。
