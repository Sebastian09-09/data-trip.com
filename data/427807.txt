msg:Convenient Location! I had a delightful stay at this hotel, perfectly located with exceptional access to transportation. Despite my busy schedule on this business trip, the hotel's unique and advantageous location allowed me brief morning runs to significant landmarks like the Forbidden City, Beihai Park, and Jingshan Park, which was truly refreshing.
It's conveniently situated near a subway station, making it easy to navigate around the city. 
The breakfast at the hotel was a real treat with a wide variety of options. The Jianbing (Chinese crepe) was especially delicious and a must-try for anyone wanting to experience authentic local cuisine. Adjacent to the dining area, there was a charming Chinese-style courtyard that added a unique and  serene touch to the atmosphere.
While the rooms might not be the newest, they are spacious and well-maintained, providing comfort and good value. Overall, my experience here surpassed that of nearby five-star hotels, offering a more satisfying stay at a more affordable price. I will definitely choose this hotel again for my next business trip.

Besides, transport is convenient and nearby to many attractions. 
I would like to give them a thumbs up with the thoughtfulness. I was asking for directions to convenience store in order to purchase extra mineral water and then I received 4 bottles of mineral waters/room in the next few days till I check out. 
Keep up the good job!

The lady receptionists weren’t friendly at all, when I checked in and checked out, they just stood at the reception and talked to each other instead of welcoming guests. Especially when checking out, the attitude of them was bad.

The location is very practical, with a metro station across the road and just 3 stations away from Tiananmen. Despite being close to a major road, it's not noisy.
The hotel has good Japanese equipment, with a nice ~20-meter swimming pool and a good gym. The room had everything needed and was even cleaned twice a day (a bit too much but nice), with more free water on hot days. Very helpful staff that spoke good English and could help me with some local tips.
It is a bit more expensive than average but great value even by Chinese standards.

The service is also one of the best in five-star hotels. According to my notes, we were arranged a room facing China Zun and Guomao. The concierge was also very enthusiastic. Every afternoon around 4 o'clock, a waiter would come to give us water and small pastries. Not to mention the hardware, it is exactly like the configuration of the hotel that opened last year.

From the lobby to the restaurant to the housekeeping, the staff are very professional and enthusiastic. On the last day of leaving Beijing, because we went to the Forbidden City early in the morning, the hotel very humanely delayed the check-out and reserved the executive courtesy for our family after leaving the hotel, so that we could have a good rest before catching the train!

msg:✨Environment
The location is good, a five-star old brand, but the facilities are generally outdated. A taxi ride from Beijing South Railway Station costs about 35 yuan. The garden outside the restaurant is designed and there are 2 free-range white geese!
✨Service
From the concierge to the front desk, from the dining room to the catering, you feel at home! I booked a family room for three nights. This type of room seems to have only one orientation, with closed windows and a high floor. Disposable items are collected on demand from the front desk, which is relatively environmentally friendly! The guest rooms are cleaned every day, and the supplies are generous. The brand is L'Occitane. My hair is very soft after washing! There are not many types of restaurants, but they are Japanese-style, clean and hygienic. The breads are all packed in boxes. Hojicha with milk is my favorite. The service staff clears the plates and responds very quickly! The small refrigerator is free on the first day, and the hotel deposit is returned quickly!
✨Facilities
Playing outside all day, no time to experience the hotel facilities! If I have to complain, firstly, the protective fence was installed. This fence fell off the bed in the middle of the night. It is too small and it is not recommended to use this kind of fence. Secondly, the hotel is a 5-minute walk from the subway station, but it is estimated to be 15 minutes from the subway. Beijing Metro Line 1 is really too old. There is no elevator and it is winding up and down. After taking the subway once, I always choose to take a taxi!

But the room was really stuffy and dry, so the humidifier had to be turned on.
When I checked in, I found that the flushing of the toilet seat was broken. I called for service the next day. The lady was very nice, but the engineer who was traveling with me looked impatient. He kept losing his temper and was unwilling to help with repairs. Although I was very angry at the time, I didn’t want to worry about it.
Later, when there was no other way, the young lady called another engineer and confirmed that it was broken, so she replaced the toilet seat with a new one.
I think this engineer's handling method is very problematic. No matter what the situation, he should not make a bad face in front of the hotel guests.
Tips: Taking a bath is very necessary to relieve fatigue when traveling. You can get a disposable bath bag as a gift. The size of the bathtub is OK.
The Yingfulou mutton hotpot next to the hotel is very delicious and highly recommended.

The toilet was clogged and the air conditioner could not adjust the cold air, so I moved to the room next door that night. Although the above problems were solved (the air conditioner was set to have no cold air~ Very hot), but sometimes there is loud noise at night. There is also a notice in the room stating that the sound is due to the renovation of the room. In addition to the above issues, the hygiene is good and the service is OK. Although the breakfast (with natto) is not many types, it is all It is delicious. The food meets my requirements. The hotel environment is good. The only thing is that the distance from the subway to the hotel entrance is across the road and you have to go around in a circle to enter. In fact, it looks very close, but because there are flower gardens outside the hotel It took a while to go around in circles, and it was a bit inconvenient to carry my luggage. I took a taxi there and back, so there was no problem. The most special surprise for my daughter is that while having breakfast, she can see the small pavilion fish pond outside the window. There are also two swans living there who are very cute🫰🏻Bonus points. There is also an indoor swimming pool that was not used during my stay this time. I hope that the renovation of the hotel will make it more satisfactory. I will recommend it to my friends and stay there again.

msg:Because I have a precious past with your store, I will stay here every time I come to Beijing. Whether on a business trip or visiting relatives, it feels like going home.
As I am used to Japanese-style hotels, the hardware is not the latest, but it is maintained with great care. The bedding is very reassuring! The service is friendly and unpretentious. The doorman would take the initiative to greet me and help with my luggage. The front desk would try their best to meet my reasonable requests. Every staff member would take the initiative to say hello and even take me to the gym in person. The swimming pool is not big but very pleasant.
When I walked in, I noticed a strange fishy smell in the large closet in the room. I called to ask if it was seafood residue left by the previous guest. The front desk immediately said that I could change rooms. It was finally confirmed that the odor was coming from the plastic soles of the hotel's slippers. The person in charge personally came to deliver towels, slippers and a fruit plate as an apology. The response is very fast and effective. Very professional!
I have to say the shortcoming this time is that the sound insulation of the door is not ideal. I didn't notice it a few years ago. Maybe it was because I was younger and slept more deeply. Around eight o'clock in the morning, there would be a sound of banging and banging on the door.
Advice for friends from out of town: There is Yingfulou at the door. The shabu-shabu is good and the price is reasonable. There are various local restaurants within a three to five hundred meter walk. It's all good. There is no need to check in at an internet celebrity store.
Have returned to Shanghai, looking forward to the next fate.

The service was very good. I helped with my luggage when I entered the hotel. The lady who checked in was very gentle and meticulous. The concierge was also very polite when I left the hotel. The checkout and invoicing at the front desk were very efficient.

Although the room facilities are old, they are functional. The water flow in the shower room is particularly good, with a large amount of water, fast hot water, and stable water pressure.

Considering the price, the breakfast can be considered rich in variety and thoughtfully arranged.

All in all, very cost-effective.

It is true that many facilities in old hotels are very old: the TV is too small and cannot project the screen. The shower head on the canopy roof also didn't work, and it was spraying everywhere in the wrong direction. Although it will not be renovated, it is still recommended that some small facilities can be replaced. The experience for guests will be better.

I left behind a pair of new sneakers because they got wet due to the rain. I didn't think about changing my shoes until the next morning. I called the front desk and said I didn't see it, so I just said no. I just want to say that as a five-star hotel without any management, the matter will be settled. You haven’t lost any of your LV bags, cosmetics, or tablet. Who would falsely accuse you because of a pair of shoes? What kind of discount will I get for my next stay? Who will stay in a hotel like this again? Safety cannot be guaranteed.

msg:As of spring 2024, only the 2019-20 edition of the pre-COVID-19 tourist guidebook is sold in Japan, and even if you search online, the latest situation and information in China is not introduced, so I chose Hotel New Otani Chang Fu Gong, where I can stay with peace of mind because Japanese is spoken.

About a month before traveling, I communicated with Japanese staff and Chinese staff who can speak Japanese via WeChat, and they told me about the situation in China and the Alipay situation, which is very difficult for Japanese people, and arranged admission tickets to the tourist spots I wanted to visit in advance.

Currently, Alipay and WeChat are the main means of payment in China, so before traveling, I carefully prepared by linking it to my credit card based on information introduced on YouTube and the Internet, but I was at a loss when I arrived at the local airport and was unable to use Alipay.

I finally arrived at the hotel and the staff solved the problem.
If you don't speak Japanese, you won't be able to use Alipay during your stay in China and you'll have to pay with cash or credit cards, which many places don't accept, and it will take time and effort to ride the subway or eat, so I'm really glad I chose this hotel.

The location is right next to Jianguomen subway station, making it convenient for going to anywhere, including the Forbidden Palace, and there's a Lawson on the first floor, so it's very convenient for Japanese people.

I was very grateful that the Japanese staff member M took notice of my stay.

I would recommend this hotel to Japanese people!

Pros: good service, convenient location, great lighting. The bedding is great, and there is also a smart toilet, which is very cost-effective.

Disadvantages: The shower head is seriously blocked and the bathing experience is very poor. The sound insulation between the rooms is OK but the sound insulation from the corridor is basically non-existent. In the morning, other residents will be woken up if they yell in the corridor. The damping of the door is very small and it is difficult to close the door. The sound is huge. Japanese-owned hotels should not do this.

There are only two points: we arrived at the store in mid-April, and when the weather was hot, the air conditioning was insufficient. The room temperature was always 24-25 degrees, which was very stuffy. Fortunately, a fan was provided, which made us feel more comfortable.
The other thing is the room cleaning. I hope more attention will be paid to the details, such as the anti-slip mats with mildew stains. Also, one day the cups we drank coffee from were not taken back for cleaning. Instead of giving us a set of clean cups, they were simply rinsed and put back on the table.
The hotel has a beautiful garden. We liked it very much and will definitely stay at Changfu Palace Hotel again next time.

I booked a super king room. The bed was super big and the mattress and pillows were very comfortable. If you are not satisfied with the pillows, you can change them. There are several options to choose from. Because we communicated in advance that we needed an extra bed, the bed was already set up when we checked into the room. The room didn't feel particularly cramped after adding an extra bed. The view from the room window is pretty good.
The service level is very high. The luggage service and room service are very attentive. The elderly at home are not used to drinking water all the time. After asking once, they will refill the bottled water in our room every day.
The breakfast buffet does not have many varieties, but the quality is okay, and there are some Japanese snacks.
Let’s complain about transportation. I originally thought that there are subway lines 1 and 2 nearby, which are very convenient for going to scenic spots, but in fact, these two lines are old subway stations without elevators, and they are very deep, which is very unfriendly to people with bad knees. It was also unfriendly to take the subway to the train station and airport while carrying luggage, so I ended up choosing to take a taxi or take the bus. After all, it is near the Second Ring Road, so it is convenient to take a taxi or bus. If you just want the convenience of the subway, you need to be cautious (although this has little to do with the hotel itself).

The swimming experience is great, the water depth is 1.1-1.4 meters, the water temperature is 28 degrees, and you can use a spin dryer to dry your swimsuit after swimming. The small garden is also great for feeding fish. It's a pity that I went out to play every day and spent too little time in the hotel, so I didn't have a good experience.

Hygiene: Hygiene is great, even the old carpet has no stains.
Environment: I have stayed in many hotels in Beijing. This is the first time I have seen a garden rockery. Although it is small, it is very delicate. The koi in the pond are big and fat. The location is extremely suitable for self-driving non-Beijing brand vehicles. It is close to the restricted area and parking is free. The bus station is about 500 meters away and the subway station is about 300 meters away. It is convenient to go anywhere.
Service: All the necessary services are available, and the waiters will say hello when they see you. All requests made during check-in are met. If you want to postpone your departure until 2 o'clock due to your schedule before departure, it's no problem, it's great👍🏻
Services enjoyed by two people on the executive floor: The executive hotel is quite satisfactory and has no highlights, which is incomparable with international chains.
Breakfast: The breakfast category is relatively rich, exceeding expectations at this price.
The price during the National Day is even lower than on ordinary working days. The price/performance ratio is very high. I will come again.

I was able to spend my time safely thanks to the helpful advice of the hotel staff. All of the restaurants recommended by our female staff are so delicious that you'll want to visit them again.

The most important thing is that the service is very good. From the lobby to the customer service, the staff are very nice, and they actively respond to help solve any needs.
The location of the hotel is good. It's near Jianguomen. It's quiet amidst the noise. The subway is just across the road. It's convenient to go everywhere. The reason is that Beijing Line 1 and Line 2 were built too early, and there are basically no elevators from the station hall to the platform, which is not friendly to tourists with large items. Of course, it’s not a problem if you take a taxi.

msg:This hotel is highly recommended for parent-child families who bring their children to Beijing for fun. It was also recommended to me by friends and colleagues after a personal test. It really is very good. The occupancy rate of the hotel is very high, and almost all of them are parent-child families, which shows that everyone's choice is the same.
Facilities: Clean and refreshing, the room is relatively large, the big bed is 2.2 meters wide, there is a bathtub, and the smart toilet is a plus. The wet and dry separation does not affect the family washing at the same time. It's a pity that there are few hooks in the bathroom, and it's not easy to dry the room. It's not easy to change clothes in summer.
Hygiene: The overall cleaning is still in place in time.
Environment: The hotel is more a**ospheric, with a small garden inside, suitable for children to feed fish, and there are two big white geese in the morning. The external environment is more worthy of recognition. It is adjacent to Jianguomen subway station, the interchange point of Line 1 and Line 2, and it is very convenient to go directly to Tiananmen Square, Military Museum, Universal Studios, and the Forbidden City.
Service: Japanese-run, the service is generally considerate, and it is no wonder that six bottles of Nongfu Spring are provided for free every day. It's just that when checking out, a young lady was obviously not very proficient in business and didn't know much about the hotel garden. In addition, we stayed for seven nights. If the hotel has some incentives or discounts, the impression will be more warm.

msg:The old five-star for more than 20 years, the hardware is old, and the service has also regressed. If you come to Beijing to live in a five-star hotel, you still have to pay for the service.
1. Room: I booked a deluxe family room, which is located on the 8th floor. It may be that there are many tourists and children in the family, and there are noisy footsteps and chatter when opening the door at 1 o'clock in the morning. Later, I reported it to the front desk, and they helped to adjust the room, and the account manager had a very good attitude.
2. Swimming pool: Normal swimming pool, the constant temperature is 29 degrees, but the actual temperature is only 26 degrees. It feels cold, not suitable for children to swim, and adults also feel cold.
3. Western restaurant: set meals are the main menu at noon, 158-228 per serving, and there are few people dining. If there are too many people (not full), the restaurant will be too busy. The hamburger set meal in the picture waited for an hour and was urged many times before it was delivered. If you want to enter the small garden to see the little white geese, you are not allowed to enter through the small door of the restaurant. You have to go around the door outside the restaurant, which is inconvenient.

All have Japanese-style toilets.

The breakfast is quite rich, including Japanese breakfast curry, mackerel, natto, miso soup, French OMELLET, basically everything you expect. The front office manager attached great importance to the suggestions given on the service, and even specially gave the child two donuts and yogurt.

What I want to thank is that when I went swimming today, my wife accidentally slipped and fell, causing the child to sprain his foot. Afterwards, I found out a Mr. Feng, who came to ask me immediately, and asked me if I should call 120 to go to the hospital. Seeing the problem It's not too big, and I immediately brought Yunnan Baiyao spray for me, and brought a large bag of ice cubes for the child in time. Especially in the follow-up, a manager gave the child dessert cakes and came to express condolences to the child in person. Thank you both, thank you.

After staying in Changfu Palace for three days, I feel that the hotel service staff are very professional and dedicated. As expected of a Japanese service hotel.

The location is also very prime location, Jianguomen on the second ring road, Guomao is two stops to the east of Line 1, Tiananmen Square and Wangfujing are two stops to the west, Changfu Palace is the first choice next time you go to Beijing.

We arrived at the hotel early in the morning on the train on the 30th. We originally planned to put down our luggage and go to the Forbidden City, but the red storm attractions were closed that day. The lobby manager learned about our situation and tried to coordinate with us. He coordinated with us before 10:00 Room checked in. The room is big and the bed is big, very suitable for two adults and two children. Although it is an old five-star hotel, it is well maintained. The service is also very good. The mineral water in the room will be replenished in time after we drink it. The location is very close to the Jianguomen subway station. It is very convenient for us to take a taxi to go anywhere. Although the price is nearly 1000 in summer, the price/quality ratio is really good It's much, much better than those express hotels. If you come next time, you will choose here.

msg:The location on the edge of the second ring road is very close to Tiananmen Square. Take Metro Line 1 and walk 6-7 minutes from the subway station. Very old hotel so the location is very good. There is a shabu-shabu restaurant next to it, and the Beiping Restaurant, which my family likes very much; one day I went to their bakery for breakfast, and there are a lot of varieties; there are also Ruixing and Lawson convenience stores behind the hotel.
The room is not too big, and the furniture is short and Japanese style. Although the facilities are old, they are well maintained.
It's just that the air outlet of the air conditioner is facing the head of the bed. After sleeping all night, the neck is cold, and the neck hurts when I wake up the next day.

After cleaning, she took the initiative to give us a few more bottles of water, and she was warmed up. The small garden downstairs is exquisite. There are koi, ducks and swans in it.

This is one of the few hotels with very suitable pillows. It is very easy to sleep with two babies. The hotel is very soundproof and very quiet Had a great night's rest. It's just that the bathroom has no shower and only a bathtub, so I don't bother to change it after only staying for one night. The location of the hotel is just a 5-minute walk from Exit B of Jianguomen (the navigation says 10 minutes), and there is a very good hot pot restaurant next to it, as well as McDonald's, so it is convenient to travel. However, the exit of Jianguomen subway station is very unfriendly to people with large luggage. When you come here, there are two flights of stairs in front of you and you need to carry your luggage up. Fortunately, there are escalators for such high stairs, otherwise half of them will be removed. Fate, I took a taxi to the station when I left.

I dared to choose the Japanese-style New Otani, but I was disappointed that the bath didn't have a bathtub. In addition, both check-in and check-out staff are all in Chinese, which is a pity. There was a yukata, and I was excited, but I couldn't find the obi, so I couldn't wear it.
Because location was one-way, taxi seemed to be great, too and is feeling whether subway station is slightly far, too.
However, I was generally satisfied with the fact that there was a convenience store nearby and that delicious shops were within walking distance.

It's very clean, but it smells a little bad when I first entered the room. It's hard to keep the air fresh in the hotel room with the windows sealed.

environment
The appearance of the hotel is very low-key. The lobby and restaurant are warm and classic when you enter. The garden is also well maintained, and there are big white geese and fish ponds.

Serve
Some of the waiters are very experienced, polite and experienced. Some are obviously novices, but far worse, very unprofessional.

facility
The overall feeling is "not modern, but well maintained" impression. All the prompts are basically in Chinese, English and Japanese, and the hotel brochure in the room is also detailed.

suggestion
The gadgets in the little yellow duck themed room, such as puzzles and small fridge magnets, were thought to be welcome gifts, but they are so small that the price is marked on them, so the experience is much worse, like entering a store. It would be better to add it to the room rate and provide it to guests for free.

There is no sushi for breakfast, it would be better to have more Japanese specialties.

The novice waiters should be trained more. The big-eyed guy who checks in at the front desk and the fat guy who collects the dishes at breakfast are all inexperienced.

Well, it's an old hotel.
The only thing that saved me was the strength of the shower.
There's a foot massage shop next door that I like, and I used to use it a lot 10 years ago, but I don't use it anymore.

Fortunately, one person sleeps in the big bed room, and can only sleep on the other side. I can't figure out where the sand came from. It is possible that the floating dust just happened to be on the top of the bed sheet a while ago, polluting it? In short, I will not live again in the future!

There are a lot of staff, and they are all very enthusiastic. Their eyes are on the guests all the time, and they will satisfy the guests as soon as they have any needs. It can be seen that the management is very good!
No matter whether you are checking in or checking out, you can always feel that the guests come first. The room is big, clean, and the details are well done. Next time you come to Beijing, you will still stay at Changfu Palace!

msg:This is the fourth time I have stayed at Changfu Palace in the past five years. This time I feel different from the previous few times, and the mood is not beautiful.
Perhaps it is because Ctrip users are getting less and less attention. I booked two rooms with the elderly, and left a message hoping to arrange them together as much as possible. The hotel told me that because one is an executive room and the other is a superior double bed, it cannot be arranged in the room. On the same floor, the above expression is understandable.
The check-in clearly requires that there is no end room, and the front desk clearly informs that it is not the end room, but the penultimate room. Well, is it the end room to watch the video...
Shower is out of order, watch the video, it's hilarious.
The facilities are very old, not humanized, and the service can't keep up. How can I get a high score?

The room facilities are complete, including purifiers, washlets, etc. There are relatively few varieties of breakfast, but the replenishment is really very timely.

msg:I stayed in this hotel for three consecutive nights in Beijing. For people like me who have high requirements for hotels, I can score 95 points.
The hotel does not take the route of luxury or vacation. The 32-square-meter room is certainly not large for many new hotels nowadays, and the facilities are not particularly good. But this hotel has two advantages, one is transportation, Another point is details.
Let me talk about the first point first. It is located next to Jianguomen subway station. Exit B of the subway station, and the hotel is across the road. This subway station is the intersection station of Line 1 and Line 2, so whether it is Line 1 to Tiananmen Forbidden City Universal Studios, or Line 2 to Lama Temple and Drum Tower, is very convenient. When you get out of the airport, you only need to take the Airport Line and transfer to Line 2, and you will arrive directly, perfectly avoiding traffic jams. There is an ancient observatory nearby. Those who like astronomy can go and see it. It is a small park with not many people. A Ming city wall park, you can watch the train on the city wall.
Let’s talk about the details. I took a lot of photos. The aunt in the guest room can see that she has been well trained. After returning to the hotel, she found that the humidifier had helped to add water; the next day, she helped to compensate for four bottles of mineral water. There are also two small snacks on the table; the toilet has written that the water has been treated and is drinkable; there is also a letter that can be directly addressed to the manager, and it is sealed with double-sided tape; There is another set of thick ones that can be worn around the room, etc. It can be seen from the above that the management of this hotel is very attentive and considerate to the guests.
The five points deducted are mainly due to the central air conditioner. The temperature increased in the few days I went there, but the air conditioner can only choose hot air or turn it off, but it is still very stuffy after turning it off. I didn’t sleep well on the second night. I suffered from insomnia for a long time. Spirit. .
On the third day, I responded to the switchboard. The switchboard was also very apologetic and asked if I wanted a room, but I guess every room is about the same stuffy temperature. I was unhappy at night. Later, I sent an air purifier over, and I slept well at night. OK. If you apologize or send a breakfast to make up for it when you check out, the five points will not be deducted.

The hotel room is very small, and the facilities are very outdated. Who knows who uses the sink, the washbasin is small and the water flow is very strong, and the faucet will splash when you turn it on, so you have to be careful when opening it.
The garden that the hotel mainly promotes is also very small, not as beautiful as the description on the homepage. If the price is seven or eight hundred, it is recommended to find other more cost-effective hotels along the subway line!

Environment: It is an old hotel with outdated facilities, but it is well maintained. Because it is a Sino-Japanese joint venture, the decoration is similar to the hotel I stayed in Ginza before entering the door.

Service: The service is impeccable. There is no cooling system yet. The weather in April is unbearably stuffy in the room. It was reported to the front desk that it was much better to change the room. There was no unpleasantness, and we were treated differently from foreigners in the evaluation.
Hygiene: The room was not cleaned very carefully, the background of the bed was dusty, the bed sheets had blood stains on the first night and the front desk said to replace them, and they were replaced in a timely manner, but there were still stains after the replacement, which is not very acceptable.
Summary: It is very suitable for business trips or family trips. The old five-star hotels have guaranteed safety and services, and the prices are reasonable. It is not always possible to book more than 700 room-type budget hotels on the edge of the second ring road.

The location of the hotel is very close to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. There are plenty of parking spaces. You can park for free when you stay. I will come again next time. The children also like it here

msg:It happened that I was doing business near the East Second Ring Road these days, so I stayed at this hotel.
I am very familiar with this hotel. I have stayed in this hotel many years ago. I have stayed in this hotel at least 10 times and 8 times. Once I stayed for 28 consecutive days. This time can be regarded as a so-called nostalgic trip.

The pros and cons of this hotel are very obvious.
The advantage is that the service quality is relatively stable, and the price-performance ratio of breakfast is good. This is a Japanese style hotel and all the toilets are smart toilets. The services of all service personnel are also basically online.
The disadvantage is that due to design reasons, this hotel is smaller than the hotel of the same level, and the lobby is relatively short. Not only is it not as tall as the tall lobby of other hotels, it may even be a little higher than the ceiling of your home. Gives a rather depressing feeling.
Fragrance? There is almost no fragrance.
At the same time, due to the relatively long age, some decorations are inevitably aging.

Of course, generally speaking, the price/performance ratio is good. It is very close to the Jianguomen subway station, just across the road.

The service is okay, the location is okay, and the price/performance ratio is okay.

Advantages, as an old hotel with Japanese-style service, it feels really good. The people at check-in are very polite and have a good attitude. There is no Hari feeling as mentioned above, and the attitude is very good. The scenery outside the window is particularly good. You can see the Second Ring Road and the Rainbow Bridge on Chang'an Street. Looking down is the ancient observatory. Some details are carefully thought out. For example, there are various types of pillows, and the toilet pedals are made of soft fleece. These details are very good. When the cleaning lady learned that some children even offered to send snacks, she felt very attentive. The disadvantage may be that there is no concierge to pick up the luggage after parking. Everything else is good, and the overall feeling is very satisfactory.

msg:The air conditioner broke on the first day I checked in. During the first warranty period, the waiter adjusted it and said she would try again and call her if it didn't work. After more than an hour, it still wasn't cold. The second time she called the waiter and said We will arrange for maintenance workers to come later. During this period, we also requested repairs to the clothesline in the toilet room. At this time, a master came and said that the clothesline was not tight and the air conditioner could not be repaired by him. Another master repaired the air conditioner. At first glance, the motor is broken. Please change rooms. I worked on it until after 11 o'clock in the evening😫
After changing rooms, the air conditioner was still not working well. On the third day, I called to ask how many degrees the hotel's central air conditioner should be adjusted. They told me that it was 26°. Our room hovers between 26 and 27° all year round. Forget it, I'm not going to talk to them anymore, just make do with it.
The 🚿 on the bathtub also fell off, probably because the facilities are old.
There is another point I would like to ask everyone. Within the scope of my personal knowledge, should a five-star hotel take heated food to the room when the guests want it and then deliver it to them? Shouldn’t we ask guests to go to the cafe to heat up food? Maybe I think it’s too good, and other five-star hotels may be like this too.

It is inconvenient to take out the ID card from the bag when checking in. Put the bag on the table with a chair diagonally opposite the front desk. It should be the assistant manager in the lobby. , in the process of paying for it, the owner of the table came and looked at us coldly with a slight dissatisfaction on his expression. He said that the hotel should make customers feel at home, but this felt like we were at the wrong door. The room is older, but the facilities are okay, but the bath products and toothbrushes are relatively cheap, especially the toothbrush, which is really hard to brush. I really recommend learning from Kempinski and working on the details. After having dinner in the morning, I wanted to take a look at the layout of the hotel's public areas, but a slightly fat man chased me up on the second floor and asked, Comrade, where are you going? That's our office area over there. It's like guarding against thieves. I replied: Do you think I'm going to the office area? So, you only need to experience Changfu Palace once...

Perhaps because the coronavirus was about to end, there was no staff who could speak Japanese at check-in, but a few days later there was only one male staff member. Basically, there is no problem as long as you can speak English.
(I asked them over the extension phone how to connect to Wi-Fi, and although it was in English, they politely explained it to me.)
If you are visiting China for the first time, you may be a little worried, but I think you will be satisfied with the facilities, amenities, free bottled water, and service.
They make sure to make up the room, and I'm happy that they come once in the evening to make up the room again and add water. However, I think it is better to ask for a vacuum cleaner when staying for a medium to long term.
There are several restaurants in the area where you can enjoy B-class gourmet food, as well as small supermarkets and convenience stores, so you can feel safe even during medium- to long-term stays.
These days, you have to call a taxi using an app, which is inconvenient for Japanese people, but at hotels you can just ask at the front desk and the driver will tell you where you're going. By the way, the taxi driver doesn't understand English at all, so if you're not familiar with it, it might be helpful.
The next time I visit Beijing, I think I will be staying for an even longer period of time, so I will choose this hotel as it gives me a sense of security.

msg:The transportation is very convenient. It is more than 100 meters away from Jianguomen subway station. It is just across the intersection. There are 1# and 2# subway, which go directly to Universal Studios. It is very fast to go to Wangfujing, the Forbidden City, Tiananmen, Qianmen Street, and the high-speed rail station! The service in the Japanese-style hotel is very good, and all requests are answered. The breakfast on the first floor is rich in variety, so you are lucky to be able to eat it. There is also natto that tastes delicious. Isn’t it delicious? Has it been improved? There is a small courtyard outside the restaurant which is quite nice. The hotel room facilities are a bit old. The basin faucet is not easy to use. The smart toilet is not bad and comfortable to use. There is an air purifier, but it has a peculiar smell! There’s no way there aren’t any new hotels on Chang’an Street! The swimming pool water is a bit cold! No one is swimming! No photos were taken. I feel that this location, price and service and the 2-meter extra-large bed are a great value for a family of three!

Let me talk about the advantages first: the bed is very large and very comfortable, especially suitable for parent-child travel. There are electric smart toilets, the location is very good, close to the subway station. Breakfast is very rich, especially fruit yoghurt. The night view outside the hotel window is also good. The attitude of the service staff is very good. If you need anything, such as pillows and paper rolls, it will be delivered in a few minutes. The service is very attentive. I am very satisfied with this hotel, the only fly in the oin**ent is that the clean towels sent by the auntie, some towels have a smell. Moreover, the air conditioner in the room can only be turned on or off, and you cannot choose the temperature yourself.

Because most of the time is spent outside, it is very good from the perspective of accommodation.
Transportation: Within walking distance to Jianguomen Subway Station. Two or three stations away from Guomao and Tiananmen Square. Taxi location is also more convenient.
Customer service: The staff are polite and enthusiastic. Check-in and check-out are quicker. Especially check out, it will be done in a minute or two. The manager thoughtfully helped with late check-out and luggage storage. The drinking water and toiletries needed for the room can be delivered in time, and the heating is sufficient.
Will consider continuing to live in Beijing in the future.

The first time was in the afternoon. The master couldn't tell the reason for the problem. The staff quickly changed the room on the same floor, and there was no tripping after that. It can be regarded as a small episode of the three-day stay. The location of the hotel is very convenient. Just across the road is Jianguomen Subway Station. Just take a detour and walk for a while. There are McDonald's, Lawson, etc. at the door, which is very convenient. Many friends ask me where I live, and I still recommend Changfu Palace Hotel to them. The breakfast is also good.

It's very convenient to travel, across the road is Beijing's Line 2 and Line 1, but you need to walk around the hotel's wall! Located on the second ring road, it is very close to Wangfujing Dashilan
The hotel's breakfast is a bit thin, and the choices are relatively small, but there are McDonald's and Qingfeng Baozi Shop at the door, but the signature fried noodles are not delicious!
The hotel's equipment is a bit old and the shower is dripping, but the manager has solved it very well!
The most satisfactory thing is the service of the hotel. The cleaning lady heard that we have to drink a lot of water every day. The next day, in addition to the four bottles of Baisui Mountain, I added four bottles of Nongfu Spring, and left a card for not enough water to call 99! These small details are very satisfying

There are a lot of customers at the front desk, and the quality of the customers queuing up is really uneven. Some people wait patiently, and some people jump in the line and refuse to listen to the advice, shouting and hypocritical. But the service staff are very patient, have a good attitude, and respond positively, especially Manager Lu and Manager Ma, who are very professional. Seeing us with the elderly and children, they took the initiative to guide the staff to ask about their needs, and they were more thoughtful than we thought. Nowadays, it is rare to see young people working hard, they are cute. The rooms are not luxurious, but clean and comfortable.

The disadvantage is that the cafeteria is small and there are no high-end ingredients, the meal cost is high, and the room rate meets the standard of a five-star hotel.

msg:After all, it is known as "the hotel where the Prime Minister of Japan stayed".
Let me talk about the results first, I am extremely disappointed, and I will not live again, and I do not recommend that you try to book in front of the screen.

If you go further and you get a pop-up window, then congratulations, you will feel the isolation trea**ent in a room with huge heights and depressions to death, the hotel staff will express sympathy in a very good tone and hypocritical, but won't give you any real help. You need to fight for all the rights yourself.
Write a short essay as a souvenir.

Personal experience, for your reference:
1. No doorman, madly licking the sun, aloof women, and chaotic policies. Service: 1 point.
1. On the day of arrival, no one helped to pick up the luggage at the door. The fellow driver also complained: Your five-star hotel is very strange. .
2. The front desk at check-in, a woman, was indifferent. They did not take the initiative to inform the breakfast time, location and other necessary information. Ask a question, answer a question.
There was a Japanese couple on our right who handled it, and there was someone to help with the luggage. We need to carry it ourselves. How should I put it, licking is so powerful that I can't even pretend.
3. The view suite we booked obviously had a room facing the Tiananmen Square, but we had to give a room facing the other side, and the window was cluttered. Maybe considering the latter is higher, but you should ask us first anyway. It's still the same problem, the woman at the front desk is too indifferent, and you will definitely owe her 500 million in front of the screen, unless you are Japanese. Later, we took the initiative to call and ask for a room change before we changed it.
4. During the stay, the goddamn Imperial Health Treasure popped up the window for the wife, and the hotel did not provide room cleaning services for this reason. Obviously it is not a confirmed diagnosis, and it is not quarantined. The key is that you did not explain this in the hotel policy. I just thought, then let's bet, I'm paying you not to provide the services that I should have, so if I'm proven healthy (missed bullet), are you going to free my room? !
Later, at our strong request, we first asked to change a room every day. Later, we disagreed, so we changed our mind and said, "We will provide you with room cleaning service when you are not around."
5. If it is a pop-up window, the cancellation of this hotel will be managed by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and will not belong to the community. The normal community process is: two inspections in three days, or holding a nucleic acid test certificate on the same day, face-to-face communication, or even direct cancellation. The policy of this hotel is: 1) Two inspections in three days (not calculated according to the sampling time, but the time of the results), 2) +1 day to report to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. That is to say, it is 2-3 days slower than the community unblocking. The corresponding room expenses need to be fully borne by themselves.

2. Good sound insulation, high and low floors, no umbrellas and mosquito coils
1. The sound insulation is good, almost no external sound can be heard at night, even if it is located near Chaoyangmen, there is almost no sound indoors. It is possible to sound sleep.
2. The floor height is particularly low, which is very depressing. If you stay for a long time, you will feel uncomfortable.
3. There is no umbrella, which is the first time that a five-star hotel suite has encountered such a situation.
4. There are no mosquito coils. Fortunately, there are no mosquitoes.

Third, the location is ok. If the pop-up window is a tragedy. Because the nearest hospital is Chaoyang Hospital, it takes 20 minutes to take a taxi. If you can't take a taxi from the pop-up window, it will take more than an hour to walk back and forth. The hotel does not provide services, it is completely up to you to solve it yourself. The subway is opposite the busy Jianguomen overpass. Get ready to cross the road!

Fourth, the gym is not bad, quite satisfactory. A female Taijun sang an out-of-tune Japanese song with headphones. Fortunately, the voice was not too loud.

The hotel's gym service also needs to be improved. The bottled mineral water provided is only available when the Japanese are there, and it will not be provided when the Japanese are not there. It is obvious that the country and the Japanese are treated differently.

I don't know if the fresh air in the hotel has been replaced. I always feel a little stuffy, and the fresh air doesn't feel strong. The fixed shower head in the bathroom is a bug, and it is not convenient to adjust the angle. The breakfast is pretty good, the variety is quite rich, and the taste is light and hygienic. That is, it would be great if there are a variety of set meals for dinner. The location is really convenient.

The breakfast is terrible, basically not as good as a four-star hotel, and children are charged 78 yuan, and the buffet at night is full price for 5-year-old children, which is a bit poor and crazy. The service at the front desk is very bad, the attitude is very bad, and the person at the front desk named Sun Yali feels like he has taken gunpowder. It was a good hotel, I hope the store will pay attention to it.

After checking out, at around 4:00 p.m., a phone call came up, and I asked, “Are you going to check out or not?”, and then said that I left early. The phone was hung up with a snap; the taxi went to the hotel and had to carry a lot of luggage, and the staff at the door just chatted and didn't even think about helping.

msg:Advantages: 1: The transportation is very convenient. It is just across the road from Exit B of Jianguomen Subway Station. It is very convenient to go to several important scenic spots. 2: The surrounding basic facilities are complete, and there are many takeaways that can be ordered. There is a 24-hour Lawson at the side door of the hotel, and there is a barber shop downstairs (girls who don’t want to wash their hair in the hotel when they go out, there is a barber shop nearby, which is very good) important). 3: The service of the hotel is warm, including the front desk, the cleaning aunt, etc. For example, we found that we drank two bottles of mineral water quickly, and put four bottles in from the next day.
Disadvantages: 1: The sanitation of the room is not careful, here are two examples. 1. On the night of check-in, I found a pair of contact lenses under the pillow. It was very late at that time, so I didn’t bother the staff to replace them. I just left the contact lenses on the floor beside the bed until we checked out. They are all in place, and it can be seen that the corners should not be cleaned when cleaning. 2. On the night of check-in, there was a small amount of water in the kettle that was not poured clean, which was also quite uncomfortable. 2: The hotel's toiletries are very difficult to use. It is recommended that friends who are concerned bring their own.
Generally speaking, it is a relatively cost-effective accommodation. It is recommended to strengthen management in details.

There is a garden behind the hotel, with rockery, pavilions, pavilions, waterfalls and white goose koi. It is very pleasant to go around before having breakfast. There are also two yae cherry trees in the garden, which are precious tree species. It should be more beautiful in spring. It is very close to the subway station and nucleic acid point, and the transportation and life are convenient.

The breakfast is also very good, Chinese and Western food and some Japanese food. When I come back in the evening, I can take my son to go swimming and fitness. There are not many people in the gym. Finally, the traffic is really convenient. The subway station is just opposite the hotel and it's a short walk away, so it's very convenient to go to any attractions. Next time I go to Beijing, I will continue to choose and recommend it to friends and family.

In the end, because I was late for the meeting, I wanted to pay the fare directly. In the end, the security guard didn't have to pay the money...

msg:I arrived in Beijing on 3.13. It was originally a one-week business trip. I didn’t expect to live in Changfu Palace for two weeks because of the pop-up window. When checking in, the hotel staff was very patient and told them that if a pop-up window appeared, they could be contacted to report it in time.

The pop-up window popped up twice during my stay in Beijing. The first time was successfully lifted. The second time it was judged that home isolation was required. The hotel provided a lot of help. During the isolation period, there was an accident. It was also the hotel staff who helped to contact the hospital and accompanied the whole process. Although the trip to Beijing was very frustrating, the attentiveness and sense of responsibility of all the staff of Changfu Palace made people very moved and reassured.

Speaking of the hotel hardware, the transportation is convenient, and the subway is only a five-minute walk away. Before the quarantine, the aunt in the normal guest room will clean it twice a day to ensure hygiene. The hotel's south-facing rooms look like a quaint garden, which coincides with a snowy day, and the scenery is beautiful; the north-facing rooms have a street view with a wide field of vision. The service is very surprising, every hotel staff is very patient and thoughtful, Changfu Palace must be the first choice hotel in Beijing in the future.

Since there is a lot of luggage to send the children to school, there is no doorman to help with the luggage after getting off the bus with large and small bags at the hotel entrance. After entering the gate, there were three hotel gods who stood upright and did not welcome the guests. They scanned the code meticulously to check the code, and after waving to let them go, no one came up to help take a luggage. The same scene happened again when you left the hotel. No matter how much luggage you took, the hotel staff turned a blind eye. I must have checked into a self catering budget hotel.

In addition, the hotel is very close to the nucleic acid detection point, and it can be reached almost as soon as you go out, which is very convenient. If there is a problem, I did not know after checking in that the hotel should be a Japanese-owned hotel. Friends who mind this point should choose carefully. In addition, I feel that the bathtub is a bit small, and the bath is not very comfortable. Overall, I think it is still good, you can consider it!

Before I came, I felt that it was the most convenient to live on Line 1. Combining the evaluation on the luxury hotel rankings as well as the location and price, I found the hotel next to Jianguomen. I found this old five-star hotel, ranking ninth. ! The special price is less than 600! The key evaluation is super good! good service! Clean again! Convenient transportation! It is said that the restaurant inside the hotel is also very good! There is no need to transfer to the Batong Line at the subway station directly in front of Universal Studios! ! It's just tailor-made! Then the next stop on Jianguomen Line 1 is Yonganli, Guomao, Dongdan, Tiananmen, Xidan! You can go to the hotel to put your luggage and go for a stroll! It is very convenient to go shopping or check in at scenic spots! It's too suitable and the price is very high!

We came out from Beijing Railway Station and walked eastward until we reached the viaduct and crossed the sky bridge to reach the Sofitel Hotel. If we walked further, this is the Changfu Palace. It is about one kilometer away from Beijing Railway Station. Walk 15 Minutes~

The appearance is average, the inside is good, and the bed is comfortable~
We leisurely went to the hotel to rest and eat before going to visit Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. Convenient~
Downstairs is the old Beijing Shabu Pork called Ying Fu Lou... Basically eat here, McDonald’s next door, eat Qingfeng Lou pork buns with green onion and fried liver for breakfast every day, then go to McDonald’s to pack a bunch of burgers and go to the Forbidden City, the Great Wall. Eat in Universal Studios~ It's very convenient! Anyway, I really feel at home~ praise

msg:The hotel rooms are clean and tidy, and the staff are courteous and answer all questions. The Changfu Palace Hotel in the epidemic made people feel at ease. Scanning codes at the door and the front desk were always cumbersome, but once there was a situation, it would still be of great help to the social flow. The most inconvenient thing is that there are no toothpaste and toothbrushes in the rooms in Beijing now. After asking Mr. Yan at the front desk, he packed the toiletries in a paper bag and handed them to my hands. I feel that the five-star hotel of a state-owned enterprise still has polite demands on the staff. of. By the way, many other hotels have to charge a deposit for check-in. This hotel also has great trust in guests. When checking in, I was told that if there is food and beverage consumption, it will be settled on the spot. If the room uses charged food, the front desk will pay again Can. So, when I checked out the next day, I returned the key to the front desk and told them that there was no room to consume. Ms. Zhong smiled quickly and told me that the room had been returned. Thank you for coming. Please go slowly. I feel that society has improved. In short, I am very satisfied with my stay, and I will definitely choose here next time I travel.

I said no; Just don't come in. As a result, the waiter opened the door on his own initiative and put the water in my room. Due to the hot weather, I was sleeping naked and was seen...

msg:I used it for 2 nights when I traveled to Beijing.
A few subway stations from Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, this Japanese hotel is familiar to Japanese people. This time I stayed in a deluxe room. I think there are about 230 bets, which are wide even in king size.

There is also a Japanese-speaking staff at the front desk, and the room is designed for Japanese people and has a chic color.
There is also a gym and pool, which is suitable for long-term accommodation.

Breakfast was buffet for 2 nights, but you can order bread, Japanese, Chinese, and omelets and noodles at the live kitchen.
Recommended when traveling to Beijing.

msg:Because it was booked early, the price is quite right, 600 yuan during the summer vacation, this location is really good for this price. There are relatively few food nearby. It is very convenient to order takeout, but you need to go downstairs to get them, and they will be placed on a small table at the door. There is a hot pot restaurant next to the shabu-shabu which is delicious. It is very cost-effective to get a coupon at Meitu, especially if you remember it is sugar garlic, it seems to be 2 yuan for a home. It’s convenient to take a taxi anywhere. Basically, it costs 20 yuan to get to the scenic spots by the Didi Express and less than 70 yuan to the Beijing International Airport. There are few people on Line 1, and we often take it. It is fast and convenient. We will consider staying here next time.

Although the floor of the room was not high, the view was ok, and the surrounding environment was not bad. Yes, the hotel’s breakfast is average, it doesn’t match the hotel’s star rating. I don’t think there are many dishes. I lost my appetite after eating for three days. The swimming pool is good. The children play for a while every day. Back pain

Occasionally there will be decoration sounds, which is not a big problem. There are Lawson and McDonald’s nearby, and Yabao Road a little further away. There are plenty of food on Yabao Road. Very satisfied with the fee for a hotel.

Near Jianguomen subway station, you can walk to the overpass at the intersection from the hotel gate (how wide the road is on the right), cross the overpass and you will reach the subway entrance. You can take Metro Line 1 and Line 2 to Tiananmen Square , Forbidden City, Museum, Temple of Heaven Park and other attractions are very convenient, but Beijing’s subway is still far away from the boarding point, and there are many stations where the escalators only go up but not down. Friends with heavy suitcases pay attention. On the right hand side of the hotel, there are two smoking hotels and a convenience store, a McDonald’s and a hot pot restaurant. The takeaways ordered are placed at the hotel’s entrance.

The room has a great view. Although it is facing the street, the noise on the road is not audible, but occasionally the sound of closing doors in neighboring rooms is a bit loud; because there are children staying with them, rubber is also arranged Anti-collision corner, the surrounding travel is fairly convenient, the subway entrance is across the road, because the road on Jianguomen is more complicated, it takes ten minutes to walk there; the taste of breakfast is good, there is an introduction and coffee or black tea There are fewer varieties. The courtyard outside the restaurant is great. The two big white geese are very beautiful, and the one who is bold will interact with people, but it seems that I will not enter it when I am not here in the evening. The children are a little disappointed; Generally speaking, this location and service are very cost-effective during the summer vacation in Beijing. The hotel is almost full on weekends. Compared to a chain hotel that is convenient for children to see experts for one night, the accommodation experience is very different, and the price is still Almost less

It is very convenient to go to Tiananmen Square, Qianmen Street and the railway station, just a few stops away. Hotel service staff are very good and polite. Although the hotel has been around for a certain number of years, it is well maintained, the rooms are not old, they are clean, and they are air-conditioned in summer. The facilities are basically complete, including air purifiers, bathtubs, and shower rooms. There is also a turn-down service every day, and mineral water can be refilled at any time. The water from the faucet can also be drunk directly. There is a small garden behind the hotel with a nice view. There is a Lawson supermarket and a bakery downstairs where you can buy food. The disadvantage is that the quilt is thicker for people who don't like to turn on the air conditioner too low. The room lacks a USB port for charging mobile phones. Overall, I am still very satisfied. After all, the summer price is only less than 600, and the price/performance ratio is very high.

Because this is an ultra-old five-star hotel in the core area of Beijing, I was worried that it would be very old before I moved in, but it was okay, not old, and the facilities were not bad. Better than expected. It is considered mid-range among five-star hotels.

The room is not big and the bedding is good, but the room is really gray. The gray on the bedside table has caused the child to have rhinitis. Although it is a five-star, the service is really average. I called the room service and asked if the room service could heat up snacks for the children. The staff directly refused coldly. Later, I couldn’t think of going to Rosen to heat up. I found that the back door was closed and I went to the hotel again. The restaurant asked if it could help the microwave to heat up. The restaurant staff was very nice. After asking, they helped me heat it up. Thank you very much! The front desk and concierge are good, at least there are smiling faces to help with things, other staff members meet, and they don’t even say "hello" at the very least, so I won’t live anymore

👍酒店地理位置優越，建國門地鐵站馬路對面，距離高鐵站和各大景點都非常方便！半夜打車看升旗，十幾分鍾即可！
👍服務細緻體貼，日式酒店，乾淨舒適，酒店雖然歷史悠久，但是保養十分不錯，馬桶裝全智能衞麗凈！每次出門回來，房間都會收拾乾淨整潔，阿姨很貼心，天氣熱給放了多瓶礦泉水，酒店服務反應快速！
👍性價比高，對比很多網紅酒店，高端快捷酒店，價格差距不大，但是房間大小、服務質量都差距較大，尤其是2.2米大床，尤其適合親子游！北京特種兵式遊玩，睡眠很重要！
 👍周邊配套樓下麥當勞、銅鍋涮肉，24小時便利店和瑞信咖啡，有間網紅南門涮肉東單，吃完散步走回來也就20分鐘！樓下三樓spa也方便，住客沐足優惠比**便宜！

他のレストランは利用していないので分かりませんが日本人の感覚だとビュッフェはちょっときついと思います。とてもニューオータニのクオリティではありません。他はとても綺麗で設備も良く心地よく快適に過ごせるのに残念です。ここまでビュッフェのクオリティが低いと全体のイメージもとても悪いものになってしまいます。もしかすると宿泊する方は外国の方が多いのかもしれません。ただニューオータニの系列である以上、日本人は日本のニューオータニの安心や寛ぎを期待して訪れるのではないでしょうか。その期待にはまるで応えられていないものと思います。

現在説説酒店的情況，我訂的大床房，酒店安排在21樓，酒店的視野很好，夜景很美，非常好。房間也很大，衞生間也不錯，特別是枕頭有軟有硬，那個軟的特別適合我，睡的很舒服。
酒店地理位置也很好，在建國門站旁邊，過個馬路就到，去中心區的景點都很方便。我都是打車出門，公共交通回來，還是很方便的。
説説不足，酒店早餐吃了3次，天天都一樣，中規中矩，沒什麼特色。
總的來説，長富宮還是符合五星標準的，我很滿意，絕對是會推薦給朋友的。

2.酒店服務人員整體給人感覺比較專業，不卑不亢，認真負責，有板有眼。但有一件事情着實震驚了我:有次讓餐廳前台幫忙給寶寶接點熱水，有個老油條似的中年+婦女鄙夷的蹬了我一眼，頓時影視作品中相關小人的形象浮現腦海，作為每年100多天以上時間都在住酒店的我還是第一次遇到，噁心了兩天也就釋然了，在奴才眼裡不是主子就是下人。
3.房間很大，日系風格，下次來北京還會是首選，如果再次遇見那個中年+婦女可能會改變主意。

唯一不足的就是房間稍有異味，排風系統開啟後大概兩個小時左右才會散去，這點很不好。

check in後我們帶着兩個行李箱進入電梯，由於在電梯裏聊天過於興奮，大家走出電梯後遺漏了一個箱子，直到進入房間後才發現，我立刻下樓尋找，在大堂裏沒找到便求助了大堂管理行李的工作人員，向其詳細描述了行李的特徵，並告知了房號，請他幫忙關注，隨後我再次上樓回到房間。不一會前台就來電告知行李找到了，表示感謝後我便在房間裏等待，直到10分鐘後我才意識到並沒有工作人員幫我送上來，衹能再次下樓，在大堂看到了我的箱子，我第一次求助的工作人員表示，抱歉，剛才已經看到了你們的箱子，忘記通知你們了。我們的房間在比較靠裡麪的位置，幾次來回費了些許時間，再從十多層坐電梯下去推了箱子回到房間，已經非常疲勞。這件事讓我對酒店的服務上略感失望，沒有錯誤，中規中矩，但主動性欠佳，談不上五星酒店的優秀。

旁邊就是麥當勞，不吃酒店早餐也有更多選擇；
去天安門看了升旗可以打車回酒店休息下，再去故宮；中午累了也能回酒店休息；
門口1號線直達環球影城。

酒店設施有點舊，但該有的都有，質量都還不錯，唯一差點的是空調，真的不給力。

服務沒的説，贊，可能和我自己要求不多有關，但的確感覺符合五星酒店定位。

是八十年代就開始運營的經典酒店，父母親當時就是受日本友人邀請光顧這裏。二十年後故地重遊，實在是感慨萬千。酒店常務副總經理是日本人，入住兩天也遇到了很多日本住客，可以説是得到日本人認可的日式酒店了。

房間裏面的空調直衝著床吹，不開熱，開了吹的難受，孩子也被吹感冒了。
我訂的是含雙早房間，這真的是我吃過含雙早最差的酒店了！種類少還貴！二月份帶孩子去濟南貴和住，她吃早飯都不要錢，但是在長富宮還得要多加77塊錢。感覺一點都不值！
酒店唯一的好處就是離地鐵站近，別的真沒覺得有啥好的。

，去旁邊的贏福樓吃銅爐火鍋步行2分鐘，還有羅森、麥當勞在邊上。二是服務熱情早餐不錯。前台等工作人員都很熱情會主動問好，早餐有自製的酸奶、五穀豆漿、日式咖喱等，吃飽吃好沒問題。三是經濟實惠環境好。800左右的五星酒店能接受，還有個小庭院，有兩衹大白鵝和若干鴛鴦，春夏景緻應該更好。

有一説一，這酒店本身確實不錯。靠近馬路但很安靜，床也很舒服。最近取暖沒開但是酒店主動給客人開了自己的暖氣，點贊👍

服務方面，在北方真是屬於還不錯的。
但個人不太喜歡房間，床很小，才1.1米，帶孩子睡非常擠，房間很小，並且是全封閉的，就顯得侷促壓抑，透光的窗户也做的很小，就更顯得壓抑了。不知同地段同價位的酒店如何，性價比不好説。其他方面還是比較規範的，將就住一晚可以。
