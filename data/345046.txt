Special thanks to the very thoughtful house keeping lady, I think her surname is Fang, who is on duty from Dec 4th till 9th on the 11th floor. She put in extra effort and try her best to help my colleague from Philippines even with language barrier. Love the location as well, very near the subway station, beautiful surroundings during Autumn, a lot of locals and non local restaurants. Convenient location.

Although it is old, the facilities are well maintained. Needless to say, the location of the hotel is beautiful, and it has its own garden. Of course, the most satisfying thing is the service. During this stay, all the hotel staff provided good and decent services, which reflected the heritage of an old five-star hotel.
The package we booked this time is very cost-effective. Not only breakfast is given, but also happy hour in the executive lounge. Special thanks to Ms. Huang and Ms. Peng, the staff of the executive lounge, for their warm and thoughtful service! Added to favorites.

I knew the carpet was dirty and I was always careful not to step on it with my bare feet, but I accidentally stepped on it. As a result, I stayed in the third room. I started having small blisters on my feet and itching on the soles of my feet. Be careful when living with children! ! !

Service: I was prepared for the discount on the May Day trip. The hotel called me to confirm my expected arrival time the day before arrival and reminded me that I might not be able to check in early. I said I would check in on time and would not go early. I arrived on time at 2 pm. The front desk was in a mess. There were many guests who had not checked in. Of course, I felt the same way. I felt that the front desk was already very busy and it was highly unlikely that I would be able to solve the problem of my check-in. So I asked for help from the Ctrip platform. Sure enough, Ctrip's response speed was faster and more effective than the front desk. It helped me to urge the room manager. After an hour and a half, that is, at 3:30, I was finally able to check in. During the waiting period, the hotel also helped me to get afternoon tea so that I didn't have to wait in the lobby. The unhappy mood was also relieved. Booking on the platform is still guaranteed. Thumbs up for Ctrip

Suggestions: There is no full-length mirror; there is no desk; there is no makeup mirror. It is recommended to equip a portable makeup mirror with light (the light in the bathroom is not suitable for makeup); disposable slippers make a lot of noise when stepped on the floor, and the size is the same for men and women, and the 180-cm-tall boy thinks it is too small; the net of the Dyson hair dryer needs to be cleaned regularly

msg:It stands to reason that a "Xiang Wuning" from Beijing is not qualified to give suggestions to such a historic and stylish hotel in Shanghai. However, I still dare to say a few words, without expecting any possibility of being adopted or improved.
The following four points are for the standard room I stayed in:
1. It is normal for people to use their mobile phones while sitting on the toilet, but there is no place to temporarily put mobile phones in the bathroom. Replacing the toilet paper holder with a storage table on it can solve the problem.
2. The bathroom lacks hooks except for the door handle, and I think the door handle is designed to hang used bath towels. Where should I put the clean clothes I bring into the bathroom to change into? Must I put them outside the door?
3. It is very inconvenient to get up from the bathtub.
4. Fortunately, I have enough AC USB charging plugs, otherwise I would be really blind.
The following is for the swimming pool
The swimming pool has very good hardware facilities, and the water quality and environmental hygiene are also excellent. The only drawback is the lack of a 200-yuan spin dryer, so that guests who come to the hotel to swim don’t have to carry their dripping swimsuits to the next city.

msg:The location is excellent, the transportation is convenient, the environment is first-class, and it is very convenient to travel and eat! There is Fuchun Xiaolong nearby, which is delicious! This time I upgraded to the VIP building for free, which is a very different experience. The unbeatable window view allows you to enjoy a perfect Shanghai morning! However, the lobby of the VIP building is not as spacious as the executive building, and there is no White Rabbit milk candy, haha! The breakfast style is relatively small, and the coffee machine in the room is placed in the closet and is inconvenient to operate. I hope it can be improved! Everything else is perfect! I will still choose it next time!

There are many business people negotiating business in the front lobby, and there are foreigners coming in and out. The lobby is very luxurious and the breakfast room is very large, but the room I booked this time does not include breakfast, so I can't experience it. After passing through the lobby, there is a garden behind it, which covers a large area and the lawn is very flat. There are also staff who are decorating the lawn for weddings.

I didn’t want to stay there for two days, but I was surprised by the courtesy of the hotel staff and their incomparable sense of service!
Really, just because of this a**osphere, I’ll have to keep it in mind next time I go to deal with things!
By the way, the guest rooms were cleaned in a timely manner!
(The aunt in the housekeeping depar**ent has a very good personality! Very good at communicating! If you have any needs, she will be dealt with promptly! The uncle at the door is very polite, helps with luggage and opens the door! The check-in and check-out at the front desk are smooth! The appearance is online! Noodles for breakfast Pair it with your own meal, it’s quite delicious with minced meat!)

It is a garden-style hotel in its truest sense. There are many foreigners staying here, and you can feel the old Shanghai flavor and Shanghai culture everywhere. Since it is a weekend package ordered on Ctrip, the free afternoon tea and happy hour meal in the executive lounge are worth the money. What is more commendable is the service of Ms. Huang, Ms. Peng and Mr. Zhao in the executive lounge, which is meticulous and thoughtful, warm and cozy!

msg:Ten years later, I will stay at Hengshan Hotel again
Now its correct name is no longer Hengshan Hotel, but Hengshan Garden Hotel, which is divided into an administrative building and a VIP building. Ten years ago, I lived in the administrative building, which is a regular hotel setting. The current VIP building has retro furnishings. After a closer look, I found that Hengshan Hotel is one of the six major hotels in old Shanghai. The rebuilt VIP building has also won a design award. When you enter the building, you can feel the designer's care in every detail. (The huge sycamore leaf design at the door, the retro style in the elevator, all the switch panels are specially designed with the same logo as the shape of the building, the shape of the bedside is also the same as the shape of the building...and so on) The experience of ten years ago, for it The location, environment and service are nothing to say, so when I had my own itinerary this time, I quickly locked in here.
Because the VIP building is relatively new and the city of Shanghai itself is relatively comfortable, the rooms are very clean. The details in every aspect are very good, and the location is better. I came back ten years later and it really gave me a big surprise! I plan to stay there again during the season when the sycamore leaves grow enough to shade the road.
In fact, in addition to the hotel's own facilities, the biggest and most surprising thing is that although it is a renovated hotel, it does not feel the so-called "smell" of an old building at all, and the overall pipes (sink, toilet, bathroom) have no unpleasant smell at all. , the water pressure is also stable. This is not something that ordinary reformers can achieve by being willing to pay for it.
But I just want to make a small suggestion. I wonder if they are European designers? The wash basin is a bit high, which is not very friendly to girls under 1.7 meters 😂 But it is not practical to change the wash basin. Is it possible to put a flat plate about 5 cm high in the corner of the bathroom? In this way, girls who are not very tall can stand on it to wash their faces. The cost is not very high either.

Five-star standard service. As soon as you get off the bus, a concierge will pick up your luggage, and after check-in, you will be escorted to your room. The concierge greets you when you get in and out, very considerate.

Living on the 18th floor, you can see *** bungalows with red tile roofs and Wutong Avenue at a glance. There is a small but beautiful and exquisite garden in the hotel. There are many parks nearby with colorful flowers and many former residence museums. The area where you live has a strong literary and artistic a**osphere, which is very eye-catching.

Fortunately, it has been renovated, and the bedding and facilities are good. The breakfast is rich but the taste is a bit poor. However, the tables and chairs are arranged with craftsmanship. It is a pity that the dining environment is shared with strangers. Fortunately, the window view is beautiful.

msg:Following the Ctrip reputation list to find a hotel, I started my trip to Shanghai today and found a treasure hotel - Shanghai Hengshan Garden Hotel. Previously, I chose to stay in the Bund when I came to Shanghai. This time I found that it was very good to live in a relatively quiet place. The hotel is in a good location with convenient transportation. The Bund is just a few subway stops away. The lobby is gorgeous and grand, showing the style of an old hotel. The hotel also has its own garden. The flowers are blooming in spring. It is very pleasant to take a walk in the garden before breakfast. Although the hotel facilities are a bit old, the service here is very good. Miss Molly who received me is professional and enthusiastic. The Internet celebrity check-in point Wukang Road is only a dozen minutes' walk away. It is not only suitable for taking pictures, but also has many specialty shops to visit. It is very suitable for literary and artistic youth to check in. I will choose to stay next time I come to Shanghai.

I especially want to say that this hotel is not the most expensive, but it is the best service I have ever stayed in China. All the reception staff are very good at service, communication is very smooth, and they are responsive. The service is not very deliberate but is thoughtful everywhere. There is a self-service water dispenser by the hotel's swimming pool, which is very humane, which is not available in many other hotels.
It was my birthday during my stay at the hotel, and the executive lounge prepared a birthday cake, which was very surprising and touching. I specifically asked Ms. Huang and Ms. Peng, you are the best memories of this trip to Shanghai.

I would like to especially thank the two front desk staff, Zoe and Sandy, for their help to me and my father. Miss Zoe patiently answered my questions about staying, which touched me very much and made me feel at home. I hope the hotel can reward these two excellent employees!
Then there is the experience of staying.
As an old five-star hotel in Shanghai, Hengshan Garden Hotel has very complete hardware facilities that keep pace with the times. The swimming pool and gym are all available. The three-day continuous swimming experience is great. The service staff and lifeguards are very friendly. The lady who cleans the room is also very polite.
The environment of staying in a double room is first-class, the bed is super comfortable, and I slept very well. There is a large window view overlooking the elegant spring scenery of Hengshan Road.
Then I also want to praise the hotel's breakfast. The dishes are rich, and Chinese and Western food are all available. It can be said to be the best breakfast in the world! The price-performance ratio is invincible.
In short, I want to give Hengshan Garden Hotel a big praise. Every staff member is great, thank you Zoe and Sandy for taking care of us. Next time my dad comes to Shanghai, we will continue to choose this well-deserved five-star ceiling. 👍

The old-fashioned elevator doors engraved with Art Deco decorative lines, retro "pointers", dark green leather sofas, copper faucets and switches and sockets are retro and elegant yet modern, convenient and comfortable. The mat flooring made of narrow wooden *****s is probably almost unique among Shanghai hotels. The retro French steel windows are specially customized double-glazed windows with good sound insulation and polished brightly. On the second day after I checked in, I happened to encounter "Spider-Man" cleaning the window.

The hotel is ideally located for a nearby City walk. Special thanks to Miss Molly from the hotel. Her warm reception and meticulous care made us feel the professionalism and personalization of high-quality services.

Transportation: It is a little far away from the two subway stations. It is very comfortable to walk when the weather is good.
Parking: Free, get a ticket at the front desk
Public area: I haven’t experienced anything else except breakfast. It’s quiet and very high-quality.
Room: I stayed in a corner room this time. There is a slight smell of new decoration, but insensitive roommates said they didn’t feel it. The new style has a retro texture and the details are very stylish, such as the central control and bathroom. Overall it is very good.
Breakfast: Almost no one is quiet, but the food supply is really small. There is a coffee machine but no freshly squeezed juice. It is probably related to the occupancy rate.

Overall evaluation: The historical building has indeed taken on a new look after being renovated, and the style is well grasped. It is worth experiencing.

msg:A well-established hotel, the hotel is located on Hengshan Road, a very cultivated area. There are many Internet celebrity spots in the surrounding area. This is probably the most stylish and cost-effective hotel in Shanghai.
The hotel lobby is very elegant and has cultural heritage. It is worthy of having received national leaders. The hotel staff serve with smiles and are proactive and enthusiastic. Check-in is quick and simple, and the guest experience is very good.
The Magnolia Western Restaurant on the first floor of the hotel has a buffet, and the price/performance ratio is good. There are green dragons and Buddha jumping over the wall. The steaks and seafood are very fresh and delicious. There is also a very "highlight" Shanghai Lao Kela manager, the service attitude is very good, non-stop They added dishes and drinks for us, and asked about tastes and dietary restrictions. They were very considerate.
The decoration of the hotel rooms is still very design-like and contemporary.
This hotel is highly recommended.

msg:advantage:
1. The "Shangzhijiao" heritage of Shanghai *** and three years of restoration and renovation make people instantly travel to the golden age of "****"!
2. The decoration details of the room + the BGM melody in the corridor make people completely immersed in the "Picardy Apar**ent" built in the 23rd year of the Republic of China!

shortcoming:
1. The hotel room rate is equivalent to the mid-to-high-end series of big-name American groups, but it does not even provide the most basic daily exquisite fruit plate. I can only endure the "Nongfu Spring"!
2. When I checked-in at the front desk, I learned that I needed to pay an additional deposit! But this matter was not mentioned at all before the sale! I thought it was common sense, but I don’t know that many large multinational hotels now don’t charge so-called deposits!
3. For breakfast in the hotel, you need to apply separately from the salesperson! The so-called state-owned units are so stingy and unattractive that it is really difficult to retain "repeat customers" who are willing to come and spend again and again! Today's hotel industry in Shanghai is so competitive! There is still a long way to go...

Hengshan Subway Station and Xujiahui Subway Station are just a few hundred meters away. You can walk to Jiaotong University, St. Ignatius Catholic Church (Holy Love), Xujiahui College, Ganghui, Metro City, Capella Hotel, etc.
The overall service is very good. When I checked out, I accidentally left a bag of my children's clothes on the sofa in the hotel lobby. I am very grateful to the manager for couriering it to my home. The customer service aunt is also very nice.
What needs to be improved is that although there is a self-service coffee machine for breakfast, you need to go there by yourself. I hope to provide tableside coffee service.

msg:I booked a night for my family and went to explore the area in advance, only to find out that the original Hengshan Hotel is now the VIP building of the hotel, and most of the guest rooms are still in the original tennis center, and the front desk is separate and independent. Entering the original tennis center from Hengshan Road, the parking lot is spacious, the first floor is high, and the layout is dignified. Through the cafe, you can see the green garden behind it. You have to swipe the guest key card to go up to the elevator, but the guest room seems to be not high enough, which makes it feel a bit depressing. The indoor equipment layout is average, the quality of the furniture is not good, and you can't take a closer look. It's nice to have electric curtains, but the most unreasonable thing is the faucet. You have to rely on the grip of your hand to turn it on and off. If your hands are wet and the friction is not enough, you can't turn it on. It's a design that is purely superficial and useless. Disposable slippers make a squeaking sound and feel like a toddler's toy shoes. The buffet is not very cost-effective. Except for some lamb chops, the seafood is basically cold. Overall, so-so, a bit disappointed

msg:The location is very good, you can walk to Wukang Road, Huaihai Middle Road and other Internet celebrity streets;
However, the service was average. We had a lot of luggage. No matter when we arrived or left the hotel, the doorman watched the whole process and had no intention of helping. When we checked into the room, we found that the toilet still had cigarette ashes left by the previous guest and had not been cleaned. The next night When I returned to the hotel, I was surprised to find that the guest room had not been cleaned at all. The soundproofing of the hotel was extremely poor. At 11 o'clock in the evening, my friend and I were chatting in the room in a normal voice. The neighbor knocked on the door and said the sound was too loud...

The sauna area is a European-style bathhouse with sculptures everywhere. I enjoyed Western and Chinese food at the hotel, which tasted classic and was cost-effective. More importantly, the hotel staff Qian Xiaochao and others provided friendly service and led us to some empty rooms to overlook the scenery. What a wonderful experience! These are the reasons why I will come to the hotel again🤗

During the Mid-Autumn Festival, we also received two moon cakes as a gift. The room facilities are indeed old, especially the hair dryer and some sockets are not working well.
You can sit casually for breakfast, and when there are many people, you almost have to share a table. After eating for three days, the Chinese food was different every day. On the second day, everything was delicious, but on the third day, I felt that there was nothing I liked.
As for service, the training level of a five-star hotel can still be seen, but some people are enthusiastic and some are cold. The front desk and concierge are the most satisfactory.

When I checked in, I enthusiastically ordered 4 takeaways. The uncle helped me get the takeaways with one hand and dragged the suitcase for me with the other and insisted not to let me take it. Hahaha, the bed was very high and comfortable, and the full set of L'Occitane supplies was included.
Who knows that there are only 638 families during the National Day holiday!
Very suitable for bringing the elderly and children, will come again!

Hygiene: Bedding, pillows, bathrobes, and simple wash bags are great and comfortable. The hotel prepares them carefully.
Environment: Deep in the Wutong trees, the Hengshan Garden has been renovated as before. The old appearance has been replaced with a new look. The pointer elevator, herringbone wood flooring, and retro style are used to create warm and modern guest rooms.
Service: Grace. For reservations, please contact Manager Liu. Reason for recommendation: They properly arranged my reservation needs as soon as possible, solved some minor problems in a timely manner, and gave me a fruit plate and small desserts, which turned the summer heat into a warm breeze.
If you want to feel the collision of history and modernity, this low-key, elegant and high-end feel, the Hengshan Garden Hotel is worth recommending!

Molly seemed to notice it and took the initiative to give me a breakfast to try. There are many varieties, I think I will definitely go again next time I come! Very spiritual service!
In the evening, because I was in a hurry to go out in the afternoon, I mistakenly took the power card as a room card. A girl in a black suit and short hair at the front desk carefully checked my name and ID number, made a room card for me, and sent me to the elevator.

There is an armed police force in front, and the fire brigade is diagonally opposite. The consulates of various countries are nearby, so the safety is absolutely guaranteed. You can walk to Wukang Road in the Internet celebrity block. Various Internet celebrity shops are convenient for checking in, but there is still a distance that will not be too noisy. The quality of the hotel staff is very high. The supporting western restaurant and the Magnolia Chinese restaurant have eaten, and the taste and service are very good! Understated gorgeousness.

The hotel lobby gives people a very comfortable feeling, the staff is also very polite, and the rooms are okay, five-star standard. What I want to point out is that the bedding on the first night may be due to the damp weather. It is very uncomfortable to sleep on, and even a little itchy. It will be much better if I contact the cleaning lady in the morning. It is recommended that the hotel cleaning should remove mites from the bedding during this season . Secondly, the hotel's breakfast is the worst I have ever seen in all five-star hotels, not to mention the lack of variety, and even the taste is not as good as Meihao. As a result, for the first time on the second day, I was hesitant about what to eat when facing the buffet breakfast. Some of them took a bite and put it aside and couldn’t continue. It is suggested that the chef should strengthen training.

The old decoration style, the room as a whole is not bad Satisfactory, but there is no shower room in the bathroom, only the shower in the bathtub🚿 and there is no large shower head, and the sewer is also slow. It is an old hotel after all. It is an old hotel and we have to wait for renovation. The key is that the service is good, Bacchus The service of Kelly Zhou in the restaurant is very good, and the services of the aunts in the linen room on the floor are also good. The lobby manager, Hex Zhou, also handles things in a timely manner, so that guests can come and return with satisfaction. The fitness center on the third floor of the hotel is very large, with fitness equipment There are quite a lot, and there are also squash courts and tennis centers. This time I stayed here, the swimming pool on the first floor is still under renovation. This is also the reason for me to come here for a second visit. The executive lounge on the fourth floor is also under renovation, so I will book later You must choose one with executive trea**ent, so that you can experience the service of the executive lounge, afternoon tea and happy hour in the evening😋

The fly in the oin**ent is that the room card failed twice a day, which made me late for dinner with my friends. When I went back to the hotel at night, the room card failed again. I stood at the door for nearly 20 minutes and called the front desk three times. The waiter trotted out of breath. I opened the door, and I was a little unhappy after thinking about it. I told the front desk about the details, and the front desk told me to apply for a small gift as a reward, but it was nothing after that. I didn’t give me any explanation, whether to give a small gift In fact, I don't care about it, I just feel that I don't get the respect and etiquette of the VIPs that I deserve~ After all, I live in the VIP building, but I really don't enjoy the honor of the VIP, and I feel a little disappointed~

However, the construction of the facilities has yet to be inspected and followed up, and the blinds will fall down when they are pulled. Since it was newly opened shortly after the renovation, the smell of formaldehyde was too strong, and it was impossible to stay at all. The hotel was in a hurry to receive guests, and after staying for one night, the whole person was allergic and had a sore throat. The experience in the VIP building is rather bad. Parking and breakfast have to go a long way to the underground garage and restaurant of another building.

A customer said that there would be no one, so we did it ourselves, and finally a person with a bad attitude came to check the degree of doneness of the noodles. We were given a bowl of dry noodles, but we were not given a drop of water, so we threw them away if they were particularly unpalatable.

msg:Great hotel, very clean, big room, big bed, great service, special luggage service and parking service at the door, call and quilt in the middle of the night, even if the child broke a cup For an extra charge, the large lawn in the back garden has children's facilities for children to soak for a long time, and there is also a Chinese-style pavilion and water features that are very suitable for taking pictures. The bread for breakfast should be delicious made by the western restaurant. The child thinks his small wontons are delicious, and the free mineral water bottle is well designed and suitable for holding. Before leaving, I saw the photo wall. It turned out that many celebrities have stayed here, such as the US Secretary of State, the Japanese Prime Minister, the Italian singer, the Chinese sports star... No wonder the management is in place, and it is not like the hotel in the suburbs with a lot of price increases during the 5.1 period. I will stay here next time

msg:I stayed here many years ago, except that the facilities are a bit old, the service is good, and there is a big garden at the back, I walked around after breakfast, the room I stayed in the first night had the sound of running water, and we were changed to a suite in the middle of the night. An extra bed was added for free, and the solution was very satisfactory. The breakfast is not rich, but the quality is very high, especially the juice, milk and cereal, which are very good. The concierge car took the initiative to pick up our luggage. It is very close to Hengshan Road Station, and it is convenient to go anywhere. It is also cheaper than popular hotels. The price on May Day is acceptable.
The point of dissatisfaction is that the faucet in the changed suite is not working

The hotel comes with a large lawn and a small garden environment, as well as a small corner for children to play, which is very rare. There is no arrangement for the family to sit in the hotel garden and bask in the sun.
The hotel has a lot of breakfast varieties, and the dining environment is also good. The room is quite satisfactory, after all, it has been around for some years. What I have to complain about is the faucet switch on the sink. The designer obviously didn’t consider it from the user’s point of view. It’s a gorgeous but useless design.

We chose several hotels for comparison, and finally chose Hengshan Garden Hotel for three days at No. 516 Hengshan Road (October 28th to 30th) The main reason is that the hotel manager Qian Xiaochao took the trouble to introduce us and led us to visit the room. His meticulous care made us feel at home. Manager Qian Xiaochao's professional service level and amiable service to customers The entrepreneurial spirit of thinking fully reflects the hotel's high level of corporate management and service operations.

This time, Manager Tongtong was asked to help book and arrange the wedding room for the wedding. You can make an appoin**ent to see the room in advance. She also helped arrange the rooms of other relatives and friends near the suite. She was very thoughtful and considerate. The room can be simply furnished by yourself, but be careful not to damage the room.
Let’s talk about the room itself, one bedroom and one living room are very large, and the sanitary conditions are excellent. The decoration style continues the traditional solemnity of Hengshan Road, and is equipped with new equipment such as Dyson hair dryers and disinfection wardrobes. The hair dryer is really friendly to the bride, I like it a lot. The bedding is also very high quality, spacious and comfortable.
In terms of service, you can also feel thoughtful from the moment you enter the door. The white suits at the door will take the initiative to ask if you need help. The suite comes with executive benefits. There are 2 afternoon teas and 2 happy hours. It is basically contracted for dinner. The meals and fruits taste very good and there are many categories.
In addition, the most surprising thing is the Chinese courtyard behind the hotel. A pavilion, several corridors, so beautiful! You can take pictures without disturbing other guests, the scenery is very advanced 👍🏻
Express our recognition and thanks to the hotel again!

2. The hotel facilities are relatively old, and the sound insulation is poor. You can hear the chatter in the next room until after twelve o'clock, which seriously affects your rest.
3. Booking with Ctrip members can extend the check-out time to 2 o'clock. I discussed with the front desk whether I could go downstairs to check out at 2:15 a.m., but was flatly rejected, saying that I would charge half a day's room fee after 2 o'clock...the result was 1:55 downstairs Check out encountered a long queue for the team to check in.
4. There is no direct elevator to the lobby in the ba*****t, and there is no pedestrian passage. After parking the car, you have to walk around in a big circle and go back to the lobby.

Overall: I probably won’t choose this hotel again in the future

msg:The sanitation of the room was not good. Although they changed my room, the cigarette ash in the bathroom was not cleaned. What's even more outrageous is that I had already paid for the room on Ctrip.com, but I was still charged 5,000 yuan. When I asked why, the front desk said it was a deposit, and said they were afraid of drinking the drinks in the refrigerator because I was tired and sleepy at the time and didn't react. , I went to them on the third day, and they just said it shouldn’t be done, and then refunded me the 5,000 yuan. All in all, I was very unhappy after staying for 5 days. I've stayed in many hotels and this is the worst one I've ever stayed in

The room is ok, but it is near noon on May 1st. Since the room has not been cleaned, I can only store my belongings first, take a taxi to Metro City to find food, and then come back to get the room card. Overall, it's okay, and I will come again if I have the opportunity.

The location is quiet amidst the hustle and bustle, and the surrounding trails are very suitable for strolling.
Disadvantages: The sound insulation of the hotel is very poor, and the normal conversation in the next room can be heard clearly, which affects rest. We lived in an east-facing room on a mid-to-high floor. It was sunny two days ago, and there were various noises from the windows every morning from 6 to 10 o'clock. At first, I thought it was someone knocking on the glass outside, but after checking it many times, I found nothing. The third day was cloudy, and there was no sound from the windows. It was concluded that the thermal expansion and contraction of the glass caused frequent noises, which greatly affected sleep.

At the beginning, he was told that it took half an hour to check in, but when the time came, he would have to wait for 45 minutes, and the explanation was not clear. The experience was very bad. The check-out speed was too slow on May 1st. At the beginning, I asked about the check-out and was told to queue up. Later, I saw that the other tenants did not queue up and gave the room card to the front desk to check out. I waited for 20 minutes in vain.
Two encounters in just two nights made me doubt the hotel's service training.

2. Some rooms are not soundproof, especially at 5-6 in the morning, they will be awakened by the sound of surrounding construction and aisle conversations.
3. The service is not authentic. Now the service is not good. If you don't urge them to do something, they will wait until they remember it before processing. In the past, it was just a phone call and dealt with it immediately.

The service attitude at the front desk is poor. I have been in touch with a few for two days. I owe your family money.

The facilities are old, the elevator card needs to be inserted, and the light must turn green to be able to press the floor. The key is to plug in and pull out and the green light will not turn on at all. Is the card not working or the elevator is not working? The door card is the same. You must have a Buddhist attitude of hitting the big luck. Before inserting the card, you silently pray that the green light must be turned on this time. Don't even think about going upstairs or entering the room

Charges are everywhere: drinking water, laundry…

All in all, very bad experience

Aside from taking care of disabled parking spaces, the rest of the deal is pretty bad. There is no double bed in the barrier-free room, and the basin faucet in one room is broken and cannot be repaired. The room that was given was said to be quiet with a view. The result is that there is no view on the top of the indoor tennis hall. The low-frequency fan noise is just annoying, and it told me that it is normal. The windows of one room were screened, so dirty that they couldn't bear to look directly at them. Later I learned that this floor (6th floor) is mostly reserved for New Year's Eve rooms. Please, I booked the room for a fee, I didn't ask too much, and I didn't expect you to upgrade the room, but is it too much to ask for a quiet, tidy and clean room for the Chinese New Year? Fortunately, the last room was changed to the 11th floor. The requirement of quietness is met. In short, there is no next time!

In terms of traffic, it is not far from the subway station and the bus station. You have to walk around to find food nearby, and the convenience store is also.
Then when driving, the navigation always leads to a mouth on the side, which is very confusing.

房間面積還行，設施是真的老了，帶娃入住，額外花了350一晚加了一張床，含了一份早餐。早餐倒是不錯，很豐盛。
預訂時特意加錢定的下午茶和行政酒廊待遇，沒啥大用，挺後悔，一沒升級房間，下午茶的東西也很少，行政酒廊每晚8點就結束，在外遊玩根本來不及趕回來。

缺點：房間的衣櫃佈局不太合理，空間太小。若無法改變的話，不如把浴袍摺疊，從而留出空間給住客掛衣服。
建議：若酒店不僅僅是定位短期商務會議的客户，是否考慮開設有自助洗衣機和烘乾機的洗衣房？可以方便長期居住的旅客，以及外賓的習慣。
禮賓員的衣服能合身一點是否會更好？

msg:之前沒發現這個問題，但是這次不巧給客人訂的是貴賓樓； 發現其實很不方便。 2個樓之間不同，下雨天還要從外面繞着走。 更離譜的是，過去接客人行政樓門前有車位不讓停，非要我繞到貴賓樓前面去接，但是貴賓樓前面根本沒有停車的地方。 一般都是臨時上下客的馬上開走的。 但是有幾個老外説好時間這麼準時的，更何況需要結賬開票都需要時間的。 明明是一個酒店，弄點像2個獨立的酒店。。。非常不方便

位置好，房間空間大，衞生非常好，床品非常非常乾淨舒適，衞生間也很乾凈，無煙味，空調也非常乾淨無異味，氣味管理很到位了！
浴缸和淋浴是分開的，使用都很舒適。點外賣有機器人很方便。服務也很不錯！遠超同價位其他酒店！性價比拉滿了。
絕對會多多推薦給朋友們，下次來上海肯定會繼續住！
真心希望衡山酒店能繼續保持這樣的服務和質量，越辦越好。

幾個小小建議：
1. 半夜不知可否也像白天一樣安排門口的接待，以及行李服務
2. 地毯顏色稍暗沉，可以做一個全面升級或清潔，會更加加分
3.房間有一個燈泡壞了，還有吹風機風嘴較松容易掉落，不影響入住，但建議多多做設施的檢查

非常好的酒店，從酒店的電話接線員開始就十分熱情，因為從外地來交通不熟悉，十分詳細的告知了地鐵路線。到了酒店門口的禮賓大叔殷勤的幫我拉行李引領至前台，前台服務小姐姐Alice得知我睡眠不好幫我安排了遠離電梯景觀好的房間，並給小朋友送上了小童的洗簌用品，很可愛。酒店的健身房設施也很齊全，服務人員Joan十分熱情的接待了我們，得知小朋友喜歡游泳，帶領我們去了游泳池（因為泳池不在同一幢樓，怕我們迷路）實在太貼心了。房間也很大，衞生打掃的很乾凈。碰到的服務人員都會熱情打招呼，是一個十分有愛的酒店，給我留下深刻的印象

但酒店勝在有個大大的花園，小朋友可以開心的玩耍，大人飯後可以走幾圈。旁邊就是徐家匯和衡山公園，景觀很好。

去之前有點擔心酒店會不會很老舊，但是住了四晚非常舒服，房間設施是有點老，但是衞生做得非常乾淨，每天晚上回房間都是打掃的非常整齊乾淨。床很舒服，衞生間裝修有點老但是淋浴花灑都很好用，看的出老五星級的設施都不錯。
唯一我覺得不好的就是隔音不是很好，如果隔壁説話聲音大一點或沖水的話就會聽到。
性價比很高，下次來上海還會考慮住這裏！

兩個小點，提出來，供參考。
①被子太熱了，一年四季酒店是不是都是一樣的被子。
②淋浴間的門下面縫隙不嚴，淋浴後外面地面就有水了，這是容易摔跤的地方。

房間設施有些陳舊。衞生做得不太好。（1）入住當天便看到寫字枱下方正中處有薯片碎片，本來猜是之前客人留下的，反正不用寫字枱，也就沒在乎，可住了五天，到我退房那天也沒被清理掉，似乎housekeeping不吸塵的，至少6天沒吸過把。後面的客人大概也會以為是我留下的吧…（2）喝過牛奶的杯子沒被收走，反而被當成乾淨的又放回盤子裏。可能因為牛奶痕跡也是白色的沒看見？但是應該知道拿出盤子的杯子都該被收掉換乾淨的，而不是放回盤子中吧。望改善。

我先講一下我跟行政樓1101房間的淵源。。前面關於我跟衡山花園的淵源都講過了，這裏就不説。。我跟1101的根源在頭倆月有一次住在912後來因為床墊硬花灑不好換到1101，今天我才知道那天給我換房間的是錢經理。是那個“錢”字我並不清楚，如果寫錯先説一聲抱歉了。後來那次就連着住下了。
九月四號我又到上海，還是選擇這裏，3號早上九點多給前台打電話，不知道哪位先生接待的，我講明情況表示還想住1101，他説話非常客氣讓人舒服，他説1101今天有人明天不知道會不會續住，但是即便沒有給您安排另外一間01的房間，後來我就在1101住到11號，由於不知道哪天離開我的訂單是每天單獨下單，辦理入住的時候一下刷了五六天的房卡。。結果這個操作今天讓另外一位男士前台講成了是酒店對我的恩惠。。。
今天我們一行四人明天到上海，計劃先定兩間房三天兩晚，收到確認號以後我就打過去電話希望前台給我安排1101，一位女士表示她要請示領導。。過了十幾分鍾我又主動打過電話問一下情況，那位男士來了，他跟我説1101給不了，因為連升了兩級，還跟我説是套房，我説不是套房，他説是，我説攜程上顯示商務大床房上面衹有行政豪華房包括早餐晚餐下午茶什麼的，還有個兩千多的套房，我不用餐所以沒定行政房。我給他講了一下我跟1101的淵源，他説我上次是每天續住不用我換房所以讓我連續住下去，充滿了是對我的恩賜一樣。。前者錢經理安排的時候我發現是一個角房，我就跟他説你有任何不方便我可以加錢，他説沒事您滿意就好，臨走的時候我跟退房的男服務生也説這個訂房情況，他説您下回來打過電話有空就給您留。。這些話我沒必要捏造，上海這麼多酒店，我並不是説衹有一個酒店可以選擇了，這才有的後來三日晚打去電話。。今天錢經理據説是下夜班，後來我跟那個男士講我説你下午五點前給我回電話，給我留下萬一退訂的時間。。中午臨近十二點的時候我怕他們忘記了，因為我下午有事情我怕自己忘了，我就打過電話被告知男服務生在吃飯，我跟女士講我要約見錢經理，後天上午一上班的時間，不管我住不住酒店這次我都要當面見一下錢經理。。過一會兒男士吃飯回來給我打過電話説不能留1101，我説那我就不住了，後天找一下錢經理。。。他沒有給我任何一個方案，讓我加錢？重新定行政房？説一些其他該跟客户講的話。。我整個聊下來覺得好像我始終在跟他這找便宜，他也始終講説你有你的理由。。既然是這個情況就算了，沒必要激起你們這種情緒。。我住店的時候連快遞外賣都心疼人肉送上去，如果不是機器人我都願意自己下去拿。。我會去佔這點便宜麼。挺可笑的。。
上海超一流的酒店隨便點名，我都住過不止一次，所謂升級房型的情況我完全明白怎麼回事。。我如果是今天的服務生我討厭這個客人不給他升沒問題，我可以出主意講方案。而不是用這麼讓客户感到不愉快的方式。。你有點狹隘了。。
沒接你最後那個告知電話，我和太太還説行政樓如果他不安排我們肯定不住了，住貴賓樓，貴賓樓之前我住的727，他的問題是沒有辦公桌還有床墊很硬，新是很新的，但是我寧願舒服一點而是我特別需要用電腦的小辦公桌而不是那個小不點兒圓桌。。但是他幾句話下來讓我不但這次連貴賓樓都不會去，以後這個酒店我也不想去了。。
但是我還想去聽聽那位錢姓的經理怎麼説，一個團隊超不過三四個人跟我接觸這個過程，竟然前後這麼不一致。。
這次不愉快我也不想否定他們禮賓部同事過去良好的服務還有11樓一直那個瘦瘦的阿姨特別熱情地幫我打掃衞生，而且給她水果都不吃。。這些好的記憶抹不掉，但是今天的不好的經歷也要講出來。。

這家酒店當年接待了不少外國領導人、名人，果然服務對比起來就很正規的感覺呢。

我們孩子高考，本來第三天沒準備住的，最後一天臨時加住，可當時一個公司開會，滿房，準備換另外的酒店的，但又怕孩子不適應。
衡山花園大堂經理大膽決定給我們從普標免費升級到總統套房，非常感動！

服務從門僮到前台經理都熱情主動，房間性價比高，乾淨。
遇到點小問題，關於房間內小酒吧的，也順利得到正反饋，值得加分。不過我提的那個真的可以考慮下哦。
水龍頭真的有點彆扭，哈哈哈。
下次還會考慮。推薦
