I couldn't have asked for a better holiday experience, and I can't wait to return to this paradise again soon. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and tranquil beachside escape.

- outside swimming pool does not open,
- only 1 restaurant is opened (Chinese),

We had no chance also with sea water: filthy and many huge jellyfish. The sand is beautiful and beach is cleaned up. Unfortunately, the "private" fireworks sent in the sky at dawn leave great number of boxes and glass bottles on the sand for the next day.

msg:My family had a short getaway this weekend staying 2 nights in the Crown hotel, and it was absolutely perfect! Hotel itself is quite classic but the staffs are very bright and friendly. Our room unfortunately had a problem in the first night and I couldn’t sleep well. The next morning “Leo” responded to my complain immediately and gave another room,
and it was not the end. He took attention to us and had us feel really cared for. Thanks for your caring and even the gift for my little daughter! And we were provided late checkout service so could enjoy the beautiful beach just in front of the hotel fully even on the leaving day!! (Thanks Yoyo for that!) It was my best short weekend trip in the last 12 months I trust. Maybe it’s because it’s not a peek season, but anyway my family decided to come to Crwon Hailingdao as often as we could!!

msg:The service was good during our stay. We could check in early and were upgraded to a seaview room (no additional cost) which had a great view! Staff at front desk was very helpful, english no problem. Because the price per night is a lot in comparison with the other hotels on this island I expected a perfect state, but in general the hotel looked a bit old and in need of a good freshen up. Some facilities were less then you expect for this price; outside pool area not so well maintained. Worth to mention is that the hot spring is not open during summer. ‘Too hot’. The beach in front of the hotel grounds is a public beach. Breakfast was ok. I can recommend to take the buffet dinner (scan to wechat get a little discount), very nice seafood choices! We liked our stay! Typhoon winds and thunder did not ruin our days here.

msg:Great location! The grounds are little run down. The pool wasn’t open. However the hot tubs were amazing, since it got pretty cool in the evenings. The hotel seemed pretty quiet and we got a room without a sea view. The front desk agent did offer us a sea view for 300 rmb more, but would have been nice if he would have just given it to us. If he did we would have stayed another night for sure. So we went to a hotel just down the beach, the Wyndham, for the next night 
And got a beautiful sea view for half the price. Great breakfast! Lots of western choices! Dinner was okay!

msg:I really enjoyed my stay. The hotel is very spacious, clean and modern. It's quite pretty here, as the place is surrounded by beautifully landscaped grounds. My room overlooked the views of the beach and the  lush green grounds.  Woke up to the tweeting of the birds and calming sounds of the beach waves. Very very nice! The room was super clean and well-maintained. Overall, the staff was helpul from the start. However, I don't speak Chinese very well, so I had hoped that the entire staff would speak some English as this is an IHG property, but this was not the case. Thank goodness for Carson, the only one who could speak English. He was absolutely professional and welcoming and played a roll in making sure I enjoyed my time there. He was very quick to reply to my questions and promptly provided assistance when I had a specific request regarding the room. The breakfast buffet was lovely, as they offer a variety of food to suit most tastes. The only thing I would say I didn'tlove is the pricy buffet dinner. But the good thing is there is also a non-buffet Chinese restaurant so it was nice to have this choice. There is also a third restauarant but it was temporarily closed.  Another amenity I liked are the huge pools. They were also very clean and well-maintained. The private access to the  beach was perfect, situated just outside of the hotel, about a couple of minutes walk. The beach is clean and although the waves were rough and not suitable for swimming there were other activities: take a ride on the boat, go on a jet ski or go water gliding. You can also rent an umbrella and chairs, but unfortunately, the chair is a simple, small plastic one and not the most comfortable and definitely not as relaxing. Overall, I had a great experience and definitely plan to return and stay  here again.

This time I found that there are several beach barbecues on the beach at night, which is great! On the day of booking, the hotel's Yuki communicated various matters. When she learned that we were bringing a baby, she specially adjusted the room. The service was amazing! Compared with the hotels in Beiluo Secret Realm, this place is much better, and it is highly recommended! I will continue to stay next time!

The beach is not under the control of the hotel, but it is very clean. The Chinese restaurant on the second floor of the west wing of the hotel is worth recommending. The price is moderate and the cooking skills are superb. I strongly recommend the braised pork feet with spring amomum and crispy tofu, which are absolutely Kung Fu dishes. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, and the grade is not low. It is recommended to increase the variety of Western food.

msg:The hotel is generally OK. They helped us upgrade our room. The location is convenient and the price is not expensive on weekdays. The hotel has complete facilities and equipment, as well as a beach. The breakfast is also good, and the front desk will give us tickets to the nearby scenic spots. There were some episodes in the middle. The hot water in the room was broken, and the bathroom smelled, so we changed to another room. But the new room seemed to have no aromatherapy, while the first room had a heavy aromatherapy. I don’t know if it was deliberately made to cover up the smell during cleaning. It stinks when the aromatherapy is dissipated at night. The room was changed at 11 o’clock in the evening. The whole family moved to a painful mask. The speed and attitude of handling were satisfactory. The staff said that we should have responded to the situation earlier, and almost had no room to change. The problem is that the smell of the aromatherapy was dissipated before the odor was discovered, and it was impossible to discover it earlier. So there is still room for improvement, and except for the handling of the room change that night, there was no other return visit or apology. This feels a bit lacking. After all, it was so smelly that I couldn’t live in the middle of the night. It was the first time in my life, but the hotel didn’t think it was a big problem. They got used to it, haha?
Summary: Considering the weekday prices, it is still okay to go there for fun. Be careful of getting ripped off when eating seafood nearby, the locals have warned you about this 😂.

The room was clean, tidy, spacious and comfortable. You can see the sea from the balcony of the hotel room. You only need to cross a swimming pool, a lawn and a coconut grove to walk to the beach. The scenery of the park is particularly beautiful. The breakfast is very rich and the opening hours are also very long. It ends at 11 am. Eating breakfast can replace lunch. If I have the opportunity to go to Hailing Island next time, I will stay here again.

The housekeeper YUKI's thoughtful upgrade from a side sea view room to a full sea view room was a pleasant surprise!

Milk was delivered to the room, and there was also a careful mosquito repellent floral water, a small bottle but an extra point.

The breakfast was also rich and varied, fresh and satisfying. It's a rare opportunity to come here from afar, and it lived up to my highest choice in Hailing Island.

It may also be the off-season or because I brought my children, so they helped me upgrade to a sea view room. I first came from Guangzhou Chimelong, and the Chimelong Hotel I stayed in also upgraded the room type, so it was really a surprise to travel in the off-season. The rooms in these two hotels are very good, spacious, and the facilities and hygiene are also good. The Poly Hotel has direct access to the beach, which is very convenient. In short, they are all good. If I have the opportunity to come to Hailing Island again, I should choose this hotel again!

The hotel facilities are very sufficient. It is close to Shili Silver Beach. You can walk to Shili Silver Beach after leaving the hotel. The beach is very windy, but the sand is very comfortable.
The hotel has hot springs, a swimming pool, a beach, and a large garden. The hotel rooms are well equipped and even have dehumidifiers!
The considerate hotel also sent milk and fruit for the baby to drink!
The hotel's hot spring can be used for free if you stay. Although it is not a natural hot spring water, it is good to have a place to take a dip. Unfortunately, the water temperature was not enough, so we left quickly.
The hotel's package also included a trip to the Tianlu Mountain Scenic Area Champion, but we didn't set off in the end because of the weather.
The hotel pool is great! The water is very clear and there is plenty of room to swim!
The most surprising thing is that the hotel package includes a fishing village cultural experience. This fishing village cultural experience is actually an experience of Danjia culture. Although the ticket is only $18 per ticket, it is really worth seeing!
Finally I have to mention it! There are also children's facilities in the hotel! Very good quality children's playground! The kid still refused to leave after playing for two hours!

Hygiene: The room is clean and tidy, meeting the standards of a five-star hotel.

Environment: The hotel faces the sea and is backed by mountains. There is a large lawn down the lobby of the hotel, and the beach is across. Although it is a public beach, there is almost no garbage. The key point is the sand, which is as fine as powder, and there are no stones. The beach is very flat and it is comfortable to step on it barefoot! ! Anyway, it is more than 200 kilometers from Guangzhou. It is no exaggeration to say that why do you need Sanya? ? At least it saves time and money to fly there.

Facilities: It can be seen that it is an old hotel, and the facilities are indeed a bit old. It may be the off-season after the Qingming Festival. When the door of the guest room is repaired, it brings a certain amount of noise and dust, which is very helpless.

Soaking in the hot springs in the hotel is particularly soothing, sweeping away the fatigue of the journey, and the delicious food enjoyed in the hotel is delicious. High-quality hotels are displayed by high-quality staff.

msg:Family trip: three adults and one child (child 3 years old)
Hotel service details:
1. When you arrive at the hotel entrance, there will be staff to help open the door and push your luggage.
2. Added Jennifer, the little housekeeper, to WeChat. As soon as she added WeChat, she sent me the information of the last two pictures, which is great. I like the "sense of proportion" of the butler, and he will not be too enthusiastic to disturb. When I have a question, the butler will try his best to reply and solve it as quickly as possible (my habit is to ask whatever comes to mind, sometimes it is already late 😂 ) add mineral water, make reservations at Tianlu Mountain and Sea, late check-out, etc., all requests are answered 😉.
3. I booked a twin room with a garden view. After arriving at the hotel, I upgraded to a sea view room free of charge. One of the rooms was very large and might be a parent-child room. When my children saw the children's supplies, they told me: This hotel is very considerate.
4. The breakfast buffet has enough variety and tastes good.
5. The guidance signs on each floor of the hotel are very clear.
Hotel facilities:
1. The hotel's hygiene is okay, because it is close to the seaside. When I went back to Nantian, I felt a bit smelly when I entered the hotel. Some facilities are relatively old and I thought they were not cleaned, but if you look carefully, it turns out that's the case.
2. The hotel has a gym, swimming pool, hot spring, and children's playground. The hot spring room includes unlimited baths. The children's playground is free with the room card. Handicrafts require an additional fee. After going to the beach, come back to the children's paradise, no need to worry about it 😂
Hotel location:
It takes about 5 minutes to walk to the beach (Shili Silver Beach). The closer you are to the sea, the cleaner the sand will be. There is a place dedicated to washing the sand.

Overall, this experience was very satisfying! I will choose here next time (*°∀°)=3

I turned on the air conditioner and the fan to blow hard. But the bed was still very comfortable. I don’t know if it was because I was in a good mood or the bed was comfortable, but I slept very comfortably.
The car was charged at the charging pile in the hotel’s road parking lot, but in the middle of the night, I received a message from the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Depar**ent saying that I had parked illegally. I quickly called the front desk and found out that it was the security guard who did it. He hoped that I would leave as soon as I finished charging. How could he do this? Not to mention that it was not charged at that time, and it was already twelve o'clock in the evening. Do I have to go down and move the car after charging at three o'clock? !
The beach outside the hotel, to be honest, is not clean because the quality of tourists is too poor. The sea water is not blue. There are barbecues and open-air KTVs at night. The singing can be heard in the guest rooms overlooking the sea. Noisy.
I praise the breakfast, which is very good.
Overall, it is a bit expensive for more than one thousand.

msg:The hotel environment is good. If the weather is good, it will catch up with Sanya overall. However, if Yangjiang Cultural Tourism does not catch the drivers of Didi Chuxing, it will probably drive away many tourists. After reading the guide on Xiaohongshu, I took a ride on the high-speed rail. The ride-hailing service here is very fast, but after you grab it, they will call you and tell you that they may not be able to pick you up at that time, but you can find other friends to pick you up. The attitude is very good. Uninformed tourists will think that they are very sincere. In fact, they are just occupying your order. Before departure, they will tell you that they can't pick you up. In addition, if a friend can charter a car to pick you up for 100 yuan, the original order is 50 yuan. It will be doubled directly. Don’t be fooled. When encountering this situation, when you first say that you may not be able to accept the order, directly ask the other party to cancel the order immediately, otherwise you will complain to Didi customer service. After they cancel, there will be other offers immediately. The car owner takes the order and calls to confirm whether he can pick you up on time. After all, there are still good drivers. You can't let a group of such people ruin the entire hitchhiking drivers in Yangjiang City. This happened to me when I arrived and left. It can be seen that it is not the case. For example, if Yangjiang Cultural Tourism cannot rectify this situation, more and more guests will complain during the peak tourist period. The scenery of Hailing Island is really good, and service determines success or failure.

Under the starry sky at night, white waves crash on the shore, singing softly, and falling asleep on the waves.
Room: spacious, clean and comfortable. Southeast Asian decorative style, natural and simple. Push open the oversized sliding door of the bathroom, lie in the bathtub, feel the sea breeze and listen to the sound of the waves.
Catering: The breakfast buffet is rich in variety and hygienic. The Western restaurant has a hot pot buffet for dinner. There is a food street 700 meters away from the hotel. You can drive to Dajiao Bay in ten minutes. There are supermarkets, seafood markets, restaurants, local places to live, and more fireworks. However, I prefer to eat in the hotel.

msg:I didn’t have time to travel to Hailing Island during my recent vacation. I had stayed in a garden room and a side sea view room at the Crown Hotel before. This time, I hadn’t been there for a long time, so I spent a lot of money to stay in a sea view room. As soon as I entered the room, I saw what was in front of me. The sea view is so healing. It is really a good place to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city and purify the soul. All worries and fatigue are left behind. The balcony is facing the sea. When you open the window, you can take in the beautiful scenery. I made tea on the balcony and looked at the sea view and the southern coastal scenery. I felt like I was in Bali. I couldn't bear to leave the room until it was almost dark in the afternoon. The environment here is beautiful, clean, complete facilities, and the mattresses are moderately soft and hard. Comfortable, good sound insulation and quiet, I slept well! But as soon as it gets dark, this is a good place for people who have trouble sleeping. The front desk receptionist Yo Yo is warm and the service is attentive. It makes me want to run here whenever I have time. The hotel is only five or six kilometers away from the food street in the city. It is very convenient to drive. There are local specialties of Hailing Island, but the most famous goose rice is not available this time. I will definitely try it sometime soon. This Goose Rice Rice, summary: Crown Hotel is well worth staying.

msg:The breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western food, with more than a hundred varieties, especially the Western pastries, which are of high quality. In the magnificent and majestic hall, accompanied by the green and swaying southern coastal scenery outside the window, the quality is definitely Hailing Island. Unique existence! As a greedy person, I always have dinner at Yupinxuan Restaurant. The dishes in the five-star hotel are truly worthy of the name and worthy of the trust of guests! 〈Breakfast food insulation has potential for improvement〉
The hotel rooms are impeccable in terms of facilities, environment, hygiene, and services. After enjoying the view upstairs, you can go downstairs to stroll around the gardens, step on the beach, listen to the waves, blow the sea breeze, take a free outdoor surf bath, and visit the Nanhai No. 1 Museum (required purchase) Tickets> Wait, for me who just want to be in a daze, I really feel a little busy!

The children were so happy to receive the small backpacks that they smiled from ear to ear. The little housekeeper Yoyo responded quickly to the guests' needs, was considerate and thought of the guests. Offer services proactively. There are mosquitoes in the room. The children were bitten several times on their hands while sleeping at night, which made them feel distressed. The hotel is not far from the beach. Unfortunately, it was cold and windy when we arrived, so we couldn't play more on the beach. Fortunately, the hotel has a children's playground, which is less crowded and clean, and has complete facilities for playing. The hotel's breakfast is open until 11 o'clock in the morning, which is very user-friendly. Even if you get up late, you can even have lunch. You can also have dinner at the hotel. The food in the restaurant is pretty good. Overall satisfied, I will want to stay again next spring.

First of all, this is a five-star hotel. The room environment is quite good. The hardware and software are all five-star standards. It can be seen that the rooms have been updated to keep pace with the times. It is recommended that the TV be replaced with high-definition ones.
Secondly, there are too many breakfast categories and the food is very good.
Finally, I have to talk about the little housekeeper Yoyo, who contacted me the day before check-in and informed me of the business hours of the hotel facilities, parking and other matters.
I will come here again next time I come to Yangjiang.

msg:When I came to Hailing Island for the first time, I chose the only international five-star hotel on the island. Before booking, I was a little worried when I saw this ten-year-old hotel. But when I arrived, I was completely surprised.

The day before the trip, our little housekeeper Yoyo contacted us to ask if we had any special room requirements, and then helped us upgrade both rooms.
The location next to each other is very convenient. The view from the front row sea view room is really great. The outdoor swimming pool is not open, but the indoor swimming pool is less crowded and comfortable. Get up early and take a dip to feel refreshed.

It was my birthday on the day I checked in, and the hotel also gave me a small cake. Although it looked relatively simple, it was a pleasant surprise at the entrance and tasted great.

Five-star praise recommended to go.

msg:The true sea view room is especially suitable for watching the sea on the balcony. The scenery of Hailing Island is good. The hotel breakfast is very rich and has a wide variety of varieties. It is impossible to eat. My parents are very satisfied. After eating, you can go for a walk in the garden. The only drawback is that there is not much to eat around. They are all low-quality seafood stalls that are designed to prey on out-of-town tourists. Everyone should be careful. It may be difficult for Hailing Island to gain popularity and popularity in a business environment like this.

The exclusive front desk receptionist Xiaobei is very responsible. The day before check-in, he added WeChat to inform us of precautions and consultation needs in advance.

Because the other internet celebrity hotels were so bad, either the parking lot was terrible or the service was bad. After considering all the bad reviews, I finally chose this one. Crown, some people said that this place is very old, and they were a little worried at first, but I was really pleasantly surprised when I came here.

I have sensitive skin and get allergic reactions every time I go to a hotel that is too dirty. The parent-child suite here is really clean and the space is very well designed. My baby likes it very much.

You can play in this hotel for a few days even without leaving home. It has a clean children's playground and indoor and outdoor swimming pools. It only takes a few minutes to walk from the lobby to the beach and there are few people. There is also a fireworks display on the lawn in the evening, and there are good music indoors. There is no noisy live music. The seafood in the restaurant in the hotel is better than that in the food stalls outside. The service is also super good. I want to come here more often when I have time in the future. The best place to take care of your kids.

msg:We, a family of four, came to Guangzhou and stayed for three days and two nights. We did not experience the hygiene problems mentioned in the reviews about air conditioning and non-cooling. There were more people at breakfast during the National Day Golden Week, but the room view and hygiene were still at the usual level. If you are very worried, you can communicate more when you check in. The east and west wings of the guest rooms are both on the eighth floor. The sea view of the double room is indeed better than that of the twin room. There is no way to change this. Our family arrived very late, and there were not many rooms to choose from. The view from the twin bed was indeed a little worse at first, but we immediately communicated with the front desk to change the double bed, and the response was very fast. If you want a twin room with a better side sea view, it is recommended to arrive at 10 am. The upper floors of the east wing are good. During the Golden Week with so many guests, the response to towels, water and other services was very fast. The staff all smiled and felt goodwill and enthusiasm.
      In short, I have stayed in many hotels in Zhapo, including Haiguan and Guanhua, and I still think this Crowne Plaza is the best. The price in Zhapo ranges from 500 to 1,000 on holidays, but there are basically no balconies, swimming pools, or gardens. The beach is also crowded, and you can't go to the beach at night. There are fireworks at night in Poly, but the hotel is well soundproofed, so there’s no need to worry. I slept until nine anyway. Anyway, second-timers will come here, unless another five-star restaurant opens in Yangjiang haha. By the way, many of the apar**ents next door were converted into apar**ents, and this is the only authentic five-star hotel.
        Special thanks to Sister Jenny from the hotel for giving us sluo baby schoolbags and straw hats. She has also been caring about our experience during our stay. She is dedicated and conscientious! I always think it will be okay if we communicate more. I hope to give you a serious and practical evaluation!

It was very considerate. , it has also been upgraded to a deluxe sea view room. You can check in early and the baby can take a nap. After waking up, you can play in the children's playground and see the small animals. After the sun goes down and it is not so hot, you can go to the beach to play. Breakfast is also ok, quite rich, overall good

This time I had a great experience staying at the Crowne Plaza Hailing Island. I still have more to say from the 3-day experience.

The front desk service person Xiao Huang has a good attitude and it was a great experience to check in. The hotel has complete facilities, and there is also a cute pet paradise where you can visit and feed small animals.

Xiao Xu helped upgrade the room type for free, and also gave the children a sun-shading straw hat. The children's toiletries in the room are also very complete.

At night, people will set off fireworks at the public beach near the hotel. They are not small fireworks, but very loud. People will set off them intermittently at 11:30 in the evening. This is very speechless. The sound insulation of the balcony sliding door is not good, which is very unfriendly when traveling with children. The kids all said it was noisy

msg:For the Crowne Plaza Hotel, I have always preferred the local Crowne Plaza Hotel whether it is a business trip or a family trip. I think a good hotel comes from an excellent hotel brand and excellent service with the brand concept The team, the reason why the name of the hotel becomes a "brand" is that after the unanimous praise of countless staying customers and the recognition of the majority of consumers, the brand can be achieved as a dazzling business card. However, during the check-in process this time, the Crowne Plaza Hotel Yangjiang Hailing Island disappointed me so much that I couldn’t even believe that this is a hotel with the halo of the Crowne Plaza brand on its head. The check-in process was smooth , the moment I opened the hotel room door expectantly with my room card in hand, I was stunned. When I pushed the door open with my hand, I found that the door was full of water, my hands were all wet, and I turned on the light. Look, a layer of sesame-sized drops of water condensed on the edge of the door. At that time, I thought it was because of the seaside, and the humidity was relatively heavy. After putting down the luggage, my hands were full of water, so I went to the sink to wash my hands. Looking carefully at the washbasin, there are little black stains attached to the surface of the whole washbasin, which can only be scraped off by hand. I suddenly feel that something is wrong. Why is it like this in a room that should have been cleaned? After washing my hands, I took some paper towels to dry my hands and was about to throw them into the trash can next to me. When I looked carefully, an old trash can with moldy broken feet appeared in front of my eyes. I was really puzzled. , I stayed in a high-end hotel worth more than 1,900 yuan. The room facilities were broken. I checked around. There was a large area of ​​stains, the quilt on the bed was not washed clean, the most unbearable thing was that the wooden decoration on the background wall at the head of the bed was covered with dust, and there were spider webs hanging on it. The staff never checked, but they got through the room service hotline, and the cleaning lady who arranged for room service came to check it out. I asked her what to do, and she told me to call the front desk. She didn't know, and at most she could change the quilt for me. Lose. As a result, I had to call the room service again and asked to change the room. Although the second room was better than the first one, the wooden decoration just mentioned was still covered with dust and cobwebs were blowing in the wind. Fluttering, in desperation, I can only ask the service staff to help me dispose of it and then go to another room, the result is still shocking, there is a stain similar to footprints on the bed sheet. I can only ask someone to come up and change the sheets, and then accept it all in silence! So, if I had to sum it up in one sentence, I would just say: it was a terrible experience! (Only represent personal opinions, no malicious guidance)

I clearly gave my room card when I checked out early in the morning. I even waited a little longer to explain it to the front desk, but I actually came in the afternoon. The phone call said that I didn't give the room card after checking out, which shows that there are still some problems with the internal management and communication. The restaurants outside the hotel are concentrated in a cluster, and the food is not good even for three days. The taste and hygiene are very average. To be honest, Yangjiang is really not good. drop!

The overall environment of the hotel is among the best on the island. It has an indoor children's playground and an outdoor swimming pool which are bonus points. The outdoor children's water park is not open.
There are sea lions, alpacas and several other small animals in the hotel (personal point of view, it is recommended to provide animals with a more suitable living environment. I resist animal performances. There is no harm without watching.)

The hotel has complete facilities, the rooms are spacious enough, the daily maintenance is done well, and the service attitude is very good. It should be said that it is worthy of the high price. There is a seafood food street nearby, and there is a free shuttle bus when you arrive at the meal. Although it is also a means of soliciting customers from various restaurants, it doesn't matter if you don't eat it. There is no forced buying and selling. The ingredients are fresh, and there is no shortage of catties or taels. Although the price will be a little more expensive, it is still acceptable in the heart of a tourist attraction, and there are no shady shops as imagined. The hotel is directly connected to the beach. Although it is not a hotel area, it is maintained every day. There is basically no garbage and it is very clean. You can get up early in the morning to watch the sunrise, play sand and surf in the afternoon, enjoy the sea breeze, set off fireworks, and eat barbecue in the evening. You will be in a good mood all day. 😄

The hotel environment is very good, only a few minutes away from the beach, and the beach is very clean. Because we can't eat breakfast very much, the price of breakfast in the hotel is relatively uneconomical, but if it is to save trouble, it is still possible. Parking is easy. Suitable for families with children. The front desk staff and cleaning aunts are very good, polite and enthusiastic. It is estimated that due to the impact of the epidemic and the age of the hotel, the room facilities are aging, but it does not affect my feelings. Recommended~

It was only when the Didi driver reminded him to pick up his luggage that he reacted. The first reaction was not good. The second point is that I think it is a high-end hotel, and I didn’t check the sheets and quilts at the first time. After I checked out the next day, I collected my things and found blood on the sheets on the bed’s calf position. My child was not injured. Wound, I was shocked to see this! As the hotel room looked nice, this one was disappointing and I didn't want to take a photo of it. The third is that the sound insulation effect is not good.
Everything else is fine, the play facilities are complete, indoor and outdoor children have facilities to play, parent-child hotel. Unblock the old mother. The products of the Chinese restaurant are also very good, and the service attitude is very good. is the breakfast variety is relatively small.
The overall experience is okay, but I can't accept the fact that the bed sheets haven't been changed. Learn a lesson yourself.

msg:The hotel's natural environment and room layout are five-star. The beach, swimming pool, and landscape are all very good. It is a relatively satisfactory stay experience. The beach fireworks and KTV mentioned by many people do exist, but the time is short, so it's okay. As for the service, although the lady at the front desk is a little cold, the brother in the fitness center may be the representative who best reflects the service standard of a five-star hotel. He is very patient, considers customers, and takes the trouble to choose suitable swimming equipment for the children. What is not enough for the five-star standard is indeed the breakfast and buffet at Moonlight Restaurant. In fact, this is the highlight of parent-child travel, because it is well known that children like to eat in hotels. We have stayed in many five-star hotels. The food here is relatively lacking in variety, and there are not many drinks to choose from. There is no tablecloth for breakfast, and the buffet is 15% off for two people and it is too expensive. The Chinese food and service of Yu Mansion are not bad. Finally, the quality of the free straw hats distributed by the hotel is very good, but the simple backpack can be said to be disposable, and it will be opened as soon as you get it, which is a bit perfunctory.

Especially remember, don’t go to the Tianlu Mountain Scenic Area. The scenery is beautiful, but the management is ridiculously poor. There are very few shuttle buses, there is no queuing measure, and you have to rob to get on the bus. It is useless to call the scenic spot to complain. In the end, my family got off by intercepting the scenic spot's working car (non-operating car); also, remember the hotel Don’t eat those stalls on the beach, they are expensive and dirty. I thought I hadn’t had the sea breeze for so many years and had supper. The stale seafood made us vomit and diarrhea; objectively speaking, the hotel restaurant is still delicious, but it’s so expensive , The food is served so slowly, and there are not many people, it is really a bad experience; the last sentence: remember not to come on weekends!

The playground with children can temporarily free their hands, there are small animals to attract children, there is a water park that is very clean, and hats and backpacks are given to children. The check-in experience is very good!
That is, we took two children on a trip, one of whom was still breastfeeding for more than eight months, and asked the hotel to install a fence. In the room, we asked the waiter to help install both sides and only one side was installed. As a result, the baby fell asleep after drinking breast milk and changing sides in the middle of the night. The side without the fence fell down. The bed was at least fifty or sixty centimeters high, and the heart-piercing cry was heartbreaking for parents.
It is recommended that if there are mothers who want to lie down and breastfeed at night, they must ask for the installation of fences on both sides!

The hotel has an underground parking garage and charging piles (both fast charging and slow charging). The welcome at the door is very warm, and they will take the initiative to help Luggage and welcome new products are simple but very thirst-quenching. Dandan at the front desk is very considerate in service, explaining the hotel facilities and various parent-child activities in detail, and actively adding WeChat to form a butler service with guests. This should be greatly praised 👍🏻 Although the hotel is a bit old, the hardware of the room is still in good condition: Kohler's bathroom, Gaomei's toiletries, bathroom design with dry and wet separation, and the 1.3m bed sleeps two people without feeling cramped. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, a traditional western breakfast, but there will also be authentic Yangjiang snacks such as pig intestines, which is not bad. Next time I come to Hailing Island, I will continue to stay at Crowne Plaza, and I will also introduce friends to come😉
All in all, Crowne Plaza is one of the few good five-star hotels on the island. In contrast, the other end of the island claims to be an online celebrity five-star resort hotel.

The difference between 40 square meters and 70 square meters is not much different for a family of four, but it can save a lot of money. There is no big problem with the room facilities, but there is one criticism and two small suggestions. The point of criticism is that there are used disposable bath shoes under the bed, which have not been cleaned up and need to be strengthened. Two small suggestions, 1. You can add more frosted stickers to the glass of the toilet and bathroom. Although it is a family trip, it is still inconvenient for a family traveling with a 12.3-year-old. 2. The swimming pool room is characterized by the swimming pool, but the temperature is too high during the day. If you can add parasols between the swimming pools, it will be perfect. Finally, I would like to remind you that passengers staying in the room need to pay attention to the temperature of the central air conditioner in the room. I adjusted it to 30 degrees, but it is still very cold.

msg:I stayed during the Dragon Boat Festival, and the reviews I read before were not new or accurate enough. Come and evaluate it objectively. Two big and one small stayed for three days.
The environment is very good, it looks like a five-star hotel, the facilities are not old, the best thing is that there is no carpet and no smell. The service is very good. Adding WeChat can provide a similar butler service and afternoon tea, which is very good.
The hotel has its own beach, 5 minutes walk, the kind that can't swim in the water, you can step on the water and play with the sand, it's enough for children. The level of excitement is not as good as that of Zhapo. It's a pity that the deluxe sea view room is actually facing the sea as shown in the picture, but the eyesight is not wide enough. The superior sea view room may be more open horizontally. Moreover, due to the festival, the house price has increased a lot and it is a bit expensive.
It is more convenient to live in the east wing. There is a children's playground, indoor swimming pool, sauna room, and free parking.
Meals: The buffet is so-so. The number of dishes is not very rich. Personally, I would like to eat more salmon, lamb chops, and lychees. The dishes that were originally given away according to the person’s hair ticket were also not available because of the festival manager. It’s okay to eat when there are discounts, but The festival price has doubled and there is no cost performance. The taste of the Chinese restaurant is okay. The breakfast variety is fairly complete and the taste is useless. There is nothing too special about taking out for supper, just one meal is enough. As for the seafood stalls, because there is no shortage of seafood in the place where I live, I don't order too much seafood and I don't get caught in the water.
Generally speaking, you can't go wrong with choosing a good hotel for traveling with children, and the children also had a great time, and will come again if there is a more suitable opportunity in the future.

The advantage of this kind of old-fashioned hotel is that it won't make you feel uncomfortable. The most important thing is not to worry about it when you come out to play.

msg:The room is big, the garden and the swimming pool are okay, but the service is really really bad, which makes people speechless, especially the little butler, if you can't be considerate, don't set up a little butler! Very poor experience! When I arrived at the hotel at 12 o'clock, the front desk said that the room was already being cleaned, and I would notify you when it was ready, and let us add the housekeeper on WeChat. This little butler is really the most indifferent, worst and most irresponsible butler I have ever dealt with. After an hour, I sent a WeChat message to ask the little butler if the room had been cleaned up. Hours ago, the front desk said it was cleaning up, so I asked if it had been cleaned up, and the little butler replied, "It's the check-out peak and the cleaning will be slower." It's really like a Taobao robot... Finally, I went to the front desk and asked, and the front desk said it was ready... The little housekeeper is really useless!

2. The public beach used to be free to swim in the water, but now it is monopolized by people. Go to the concentrated area to swim in the water (an additional charge of 42 yuan/person is required to go to the beach). The beach is the selling point of this hotel. We only choose it because there are few people. This hotel and the hotel's beach, if there is no private beach, why should I choose such an expensive hotel?

This time, I went back and read the reviews first. There were so many bad reviews. I thought to myself, maybe I didn’t say anything. After staying in a double bed room with sea view, I was very emotional. A hotel with good hardware, poor software, poor sanitation, and poor service. I opened the shaver🪒 and found that the shaver was full of hairs. I don’t know Why, call the front desk, the front desk said to send a new one, wait for half an hour and no one will deliver it, forget it, call Do Not Disturb, so as not to make it difficult for workers. What's more, when the door of the shower room is closed, the water will run out. What's painful is that there is no drain when the water goes outside, and the dry area is wet. The air conditioner is not cool. Fortunately, I read the reviews before coming here and said that it is not cool, so I have to be mentally prepared.

He helped us upgrade the sea view room for free, and then provided with butler service. Many services can be communicated with the butler on WeChat. Thanks to the butler Xiaolin Serve. But the only downside is that if you want to go to the beach to swim, you have to go to the left to get to the poly swimming area. The beach in front of the hotel is not allowed to go into the sea, and it is not under the management of the hotel. There is only a group of people who are in the motorcycle airship business There, because the sun’s ultraviolet rays are still very strong, we brought a canopy and wanted to go there to build it, but then the group of motorcycle makers came and refused to let us set it up, saying that the place was rented by them and that we could sit on stools, we could only bear it. After all, even if we don't get along, they can't do much business. Also, it may not be the peak season yet, the corridors of the hotel are not air-conditioned, it is too hot, the room is a world, and you will go to Africa when you leave the door.

Let me talk about the advantages first:
Environment: The room is facing the sea view, it is very large, the space and the scenery are great; open the balcony window to enjoy the sea breeze!
Service: The service is also great, from landing to the front desk, they are very thoughtful and polite

Say some deficiencies:
Equipment: The hotel has been renovated for several years, the style is relatively old, and the lights in the bathroom are a little flickering, and the air conditioner is also a little noisy;
Others: In addition, there are really people singing and setting off fireworks on the beach outside at night! It would be nice if this avoids the overall experience

But I would like to make a small suggestion. The island is humid, and there are swimming pools and hot springs. It would be even better to have a free self-service laundry service. After all, we are a five-star hotel.

msg:After ferrying from Xuwen Port, we headed all the way to Hailing Island. After visiting the nearby museum, we stayed at Poly Crown Hotel. I was lucky enough to meet the beauty Xiao Feng at the front desk. She was upgraded to a sea view room for free, and informed the hotel's environment and facilities and play items one by one. They also arranged sweet water at night. The service is really nice. There is a seafood market not far from the hotel. The dinner is arranged there. The taste and ingredients are good. It is very pleasant to sit on the balcony at night, listen to the sound of the waves, drink tea, and chat. The next time you come to Hailing Island, you will still choose Poly Crown.

It is a product for children, and thank you for taking care of it in real time as a bed guard. (You can add WeChat friends during check-in.)

Originally, you booked a double bed garden view room, but you offered to upgrade to a double bed sea view room (full sea view room must be a king bed), A twin room is more suitable for me, so Y oyo worked hard to find a side sea view room and it is super large, with a full area of 70 square meters. When you look out in the morning, you will feel like a vacation immediately. You can live comfortably and fall asleep listening to the sound of the waves and the sound of birds. Wake up, it’s so comfortable, the hotel’s sanitation is in place, the Chinese restaurant has first-class service, and it’s delicious. After returning to the room, the heart-warming taro sago dew has been delivered. It's a pity that I have to leave early in the morning. Next time, I will definitely stay a few more nights, walk around the hotel and enjoy it. Thank you again for Yoyo's professional attitude

The housekeeper, Xiao Huang, told me that there are many activities that the hotel can participate in, and upgraded me to a deluxe room, a big bed room facing the sea. We came here during the Lantern Festival. The hotel has special Lantern Festival activities. The children had a great time. There are seafood restaurants around 3 kilometers away from the hotel. We chose the buffet in the hotel for the next few days. There are many varieties of seafood hot pot And they are all fresh. Every employee in the hotel is very polite and the service is really good. The butler Xiao Huang also prepared sweet soup for our family at night, which is really considerate. Surprisingly, in addition to indoor and outdoor swimming pools, the hotel also has rooms with private swimming pools on the first floor. There is also a public hot spring pool in the hotel. I was really surprised. The environmental facilities are very good, so I decided to stay for a few more days. Enjoy this vacation. Thank you very much Holiday Inn for the excellent service

msg:This time I came to Yangjiang for a trip, and overall I am very satisfied with Crowne Plaza.
The architectural design faces the South China Sea, with beautiful scenery. The lobby can overlook the entire sea and beach, plus the hotel's garden architecture, it gives people a better first impression.
Although some of the room facilities are relatively old, the service staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic and responsible. The front office manager is very reliable. In addition, the little brother Wu Jianglong (chris wu, with the same name as a certain star) in the concierge depar**ent left me a very good impression My impression is that when showing us the room, they will listen carefully to our needs, and then give feedback to the leaders in a timely manner, and when they smile, they give people a warm and responsible feeling.
The hotel is very suitable for vacation, and the Tianhai Hot Spring at night is also great. Although there are not many pools, they are mainly open to guests. It is very tiring after a day of shopping during the day, but it is very relaxing to soak in winter. This design is very bright.

msg:The only five-star hotel in Hailing Island. In addition to having a first-line sea view, the biggest advantage is that it is suitable for parents and children. The hotel has rich configurations, and it is especially suitable for users who are unwilling to visit scenic spots and just want to take a leisure vacation and watch the sea in a daze.
There is an indoor swimming pool in the hotel, and an outdoor hot spring. You can order afternoon tea on the open-air lawn. In summer, there is an outdoor swimming pool, and you can walk to the beach in a few steps.
At night, there are open-air movies on the beach and you can watch the stars.
I am very happy to choose this place during the Spring Festival.
The downside is that the service can't keep up and doesn't match the five-star quality. It may also be that there are too many people in the New Year, which is understandable.

Although it is true that there are many guests during the Spring Festival, the hotel is obviously not ready. The variety is too small, the reception time is too long, and the coffee machine is broken, resulting in a poor overall experience. In addition, when booking the room, it was stated that the included Haitang Spring was not open at all, and the front desk did not have any explanations or explanations when checking in. The environment of the sea view room is good, and the view is OK. On the whole, service awareness needs to be further improved.

The Western-style buffet dinner at 1.328 is really not good. The barbecue is very old and basically cold, and the variety is average. The breakfast at 128 is not bad.
2. The sea view room of the double room has a side sea view, so it’s okay, but the sliding door of the balcony can only be opened halfway. The wind power of the ventilation fan in the bathroom is almost negligible, and the person who came to overhaul said that is the case. . .
Advantages: There is no harm without comparison. Compared with the Neptune next door, the crown is still much stronger.

The only downside is that the New Year’s Eve dinner at the Chinese restaurant is too slow to serve. I ordered the dishes in advance and paid a deposit, and the food was served faster than our table, whether it was a group meal or a later one. I can understand the popularity and hard work of the New Year's Eve dinner, but the service planning can still be improved.

He Said that he can't help it, a resort hotel can't even handle the guests' meals? After being hungry for a long time, my stomach started to hurt. I couldn’t help it. I went to the afternoon tea bar and asked the waiter where I could eat. He said that the Chinese restaurant can go directly to order food now, so the front desk is talking nonsense and doesn’t care about the customers at all. ... The front desk should really strengthen the training. It sucks. Since it is so expensive, it should make customers feel worth it, instead of knowing how much to charge when there is a sea next to it. It can be expensive but it makes sense to be expensive. I like the service and The environment of the room can be protected against lightning. Even though the sea is nice, you don’t sleep in the sea, you sleep in the room, so sanitation and service are still very important. This New Year’s Eve feels very bad

The sister at the front desk upgraded the partial sea view room ordered by Ctrip to the front sea view room. The service is very thoughtful and the check-in is very fast. The waiter also helped with luggage. The room is very clean (this is the basic requirement for my hotel booking), the room is large, with a big sea view, the large bathtub is convenient for taking a bath, the water pressure in the bath is sufficient, and the hot water is sufficient. For the first time since the mask period, I stayed at a relatively cheap sea view hotel, which was very comfortable and relieved. When you come here, you don't have to leave the hotel at all, just play enough at the hotel. There are everything, a heated swimming pool, a gym, a children's playroom, and a small hot spring pool. There are more than ten styles, which are quite good. Went at the end of October, it was a bit cooler and the outdoor pool was closed. If the hotel can have beach chairs and order a drink, you can probably lie down for a day. The sea breeze is cool, and listening to the sound of the waves is really comfortable. It is very suitable for vacation, it has the feeling of Sanya. You can see the sunrise from the hotel beach, but you can't get up yourself 😂 The beach here is very good, the sand is very fine, suitable for walking and kicking the water on the beach, like Australia's Gold Coast, the hotel is just a few minutes walk to the beach . The hotel's garden also has greenery. It is good to eat and walk in the evening and exercise in the morning. The hotel has a free parking lot, go out to eat the sugar water of the Internet celebrity restaurant, check in the juice ice company, and drive 15 minutes to the Chenghai Seafood Street. The hotel packaged breakfast, there are Chinese and Western, cold and hot, many styles, it is worth it, and the taste is good, it is almost time to eat, the waiter also reminded you to take more food, you can take more. Just closed. Service is really good. It has been a long time since I have seriously commented on it. This time I really feel comfortable and happy, and I will definitely come back for vacation.
p.s. You can go to the People’s Hospital for nucleic acid testing nearby. There is a short section of Baidu navigation that is not very correct. You don’t need to take a small road. Just keep walking on the country road.

msg:I go there twice a year, because the beach is beautiful and there are fewer people. Sitting in the lobby can relax completely. The food in the Chinese restaurant is delicious. The most disappointing thing this time was that there was Xiaoqiang lying there three times in a row, which was extremely uncomfortable. The hotel said that this happened because of the insecticide work done two days ago. Later, I gave feedback to the duty manager Xiao Yang, gave us fruit, and finally changed to a sea view suite to calm our emotions, so that we could enjoy the rest of the time. Therefore, the service is rated 5 points, the environment is average, the time is relatively long, and the room facilities are relatively old.

As soon as you enter the door, you are mesmerized by the endless beach in front of you. On the way, I also went to the cliff mountain park in Beiluo Secret Realm to play, and the positioning of its Internet celebrity hotel has led to a lot of tourists. There are still construction projects around, which is noisy and noisy. In contrast, it is more quiet and comfortable here. The hotel also has a private beach. The sand is soft and clean.

If you want to get into the water, you need a third party, which costs money. Moreover, the waves on Hailing Island are relatively large and are not suitable for swimming in the sea.

The hotel's environment and most of the hardware are very good, but the decoration in the room is a bit outdated, some rooms (such as room 2609) have a musty smell, and the interior is shabby. Obviously, it needs less maintenance.
The Chinese restaurant Royal Palace is indeed much better than other Royal Palaces under InterContinental, which is unexpected.
But the western restaurant actually rests during dinner, which I have never encountered before.
Service, the worst is the front desk, no professional quality.
Room service, individual employees are very good, such as the waiter in charge of room 2617 at around 3 pm on the 20th.
Others are very general. I feel that the land was brought in during the land acquisition. It is not a problem to be short, thin or black. The problem is that they have not undergone the necessary training and supervision, and some even speak Mandarin and even the vernacular. not good.
Fortunately, I went on a non-holiday, and there are still some cost-effectiveness. If I go in the peak season, the opinions will be even bigger~~

When we checked in at noon, there were not many guests, so we should wait about 15 minutes. We booked a garden view room. On the first floor, the room environment and various equipment are very good and worthy of this five-star title.

The hotel's various entertainment facilities are very suitable for bringing children here. There are children's playgrounds, swimming pools, and various small shops. Immediately after we checked in, we couldn't help but go outside and play the water games. The swimming pool and the beach are amazing.

Since the hotel needs to take a car or drive by himself to go out to eat, we choose the buffet downstairs for dinner, a very surprising buffet, all kinds of seafood and various kinds of dishes, and of course coffee A variety of drinks, children are very satisfied with the cost-effective, and also very high, more comfortable than going out to eat, and there are many types of choices that can be tried in various ways.

We stayed at another hotel the night before, and the price is similar to this hotel, but the hotel's surrounding environment, equipment, facilities, entertainment, etc., is still much higher than the Poly Crown Hotel. After dinner in the evening, I sat on a stool and enjoyed it. I enjoyed the sea breeze and the fireworks. Xiaobao said that he would come again in September. It seems that it is already our plan to visit again soon.

The design of the toilet in the room is a bit awkward, the door is not locked, and the design is relatively old. It is recommended to replace the bathroom and toilet doors with frosted glass, which will not affect other people's use of the washbasin.

1. We lived in an open parent-child swimming pool room on the first floor. From the walkway into the room on the first floor, there was a musty smell like in the ba*****t, and the whole area felt dark and damp.
2. The hygiene of the room is worrying. There are stains on the walls, bed and carpet. The room is also musty. The mattress of the small bed in the parent-child room is slightly collapsed and very hard.
3. At 10 o'clock in the evening, we found that sewage was gushing out from the sewer, and the entire toilet was soaked. The room was changed after 11 o'clock at the end. The experience of staying with young children was very bad.
3. The attitude of the service staff did not match the five-star positioning of the hotel at all. From the beginning of the check-in, the attitude was very casual. Later, there was a problem of water in the room. After making 4 calls and waiting for more than 20 minutes, a cleaner was sent. Any substantial help. We can only go to the front desk to negotiate with the front desk staff. The manager has always stressed that the same room type is full and cannot be changed, but in the end, he quickly arranged a room of the same type for me after I said to leave, so what kind of full room is it? ?
4. The buffet breakfast provided is also of a very average level. In a five-star hotel, there are only 2-3 baby chairs in the entire restaurant, and baby chairs cannot be provided. Even ordinary chairs take a long time to be arranged.
5. The hotel does have a certain age, and it is inevitable that the hardware will be outdated, but I think it is definitely a lack of maintenance and management that makes this hotel like this.
6. The only two advantages: the scenery in the lobby and the swimming pool in the room are quite suitable for children to play in the water

Although I looked at the sea from the side, the sea view from the balcony was very beautiful. The room is clean and tidy, and the service attitude is also very good. No matter when you call room service, you can answer it quickly. Although it is not the hotel's private beach, only hotel guests can go out. The tide rises and falls twice a day. When the tide is low, there is a large flat sandy beach where you can play in the water. You can actually pick up live shells on the beach. The rate is comparable to that of the Internet-famous Tashay Bay! Especially the children's playground, swimming pool, and fun mirror in the corridor, the two children had a great time. We had a wonderful, comfortable and pleasant trip to Hailing Island, and we will come again next time.

2. A hotel that costs ¥2190 a night doesn’t have a private beach. I have to go to a hotel with a few hundred bucks next door. There is a beach there, and each person charges an additional 39 to enjoy the beach next door! The pictures I took are from the hotel next door. And their beach is unmanaged and the sand is poor. The manager said that the beach does not belong to the Crown Hotel 😅
3 In addition, the courier did not help to bring the fruit to the room. There was no fruit in the room. I called the ** in the middle of the night to deliver the fruit, but I was asked to go to the lobby to pick it up. 4. At night, the lights in the garden are basically not turned on, it is very dark, and I almost fell down when walking on the road. Don't dare to go outside at night.
5. The equipment is very old. After all, it is eight or nine years old. The key is that the smell of the air conditioner is really bad. It has a musty smell.
6. I really don't know why I can charge more than RMB 2190 for one night? This is the first time I made a bad review on Ctrip, and I have never commented on Ctrip. Don't book this hotel if you haven't been there.

Although the temperature is high these days, the hotel has an indoor swimming pool, a children's club, and a gym, so there is no need to worry about exposure to the sun. A small suggestion, the hotel is a little old, the balcony lights in the room are broken and have not been repaired, and some small facilities are also in disrepair, and the experience will be better if you maintain it!

msg:Staying in this hotel for the second year, it is very comfortable to face the sea in the lobby. This time, I chose an open poolside parent-child room. You can swim in the small pool that comes with the room anytime, anywhere. The children are very happy. The only downside is that the room is at the exit of the hotel towards the sea, which is a bit noisy at night.

msg:After reading a lot of reviews, I finally decided to book this one. The negative comments are quite objective, for example, the hotel facilities are outdated, the beach is not a hotel, it is not allowed to go to the sea, and the fireworks are noisy at night. But after I went, I felt that although I was very picky, it was still acceptable. First of all, this is really a resort hotel, very similar to Sanya. Secondly, the service was really good and helped to upgrade the room. The buffet in the morning is also ok. Compared with hotels within a thousand, I don't think you can be too harsh. Stayed here for a few days and was quite satisfied. Personally, I like this place more than the Yueluo Secret Realm over there.

Hardware facilities are also OK, I thought it was an older hotel, better than expected. The quilt was a little damp, probably because I kept the balcony window open. The breakfast is also good, and for dinner, you can take a free battery car to the food street.
The disadvantage is that the waves on the beach are too large to swim, and there are people setting off fireworks by the sea in the middle of the night.

msg:Old star hotel! Basically, there is nothing wrong with the first choice with a baby.
The advantage of the hotel is that it is fully equipped, with an indoor heated swimming pool, a children's playground, an outdoor swimming pool, a private beach, and a buffet, basically one-stop.
We originally booked a garden view room, but the lady at the front desk helped us upgrade the room with a sea view. The view was very good, and we could see the fireworks next door at night.
The buffet breakfast is what I am quite satisfied with in Yangjiang so far.
The children's playground has been renovated and it's free! It is very suitable for the dolls' electricity, but the decoration taste is a little big.
You can't swim on the beach, but it's not bad to play in the sand.
Except the room facilities are a bit outdated, others are still very satisfied.
Parent-child travel first recommendation

It takes three or four minutes to walk to the beach from the hotel. There is a children's play area and a children's paddling pool. Parents who are traveling with their children can lie down and bring Wahaha here.
Crown's service is great, especially Carson, the front desk manager, who responds to requests and does everything possible to make us have a pleasant stay experience. If you are worried that many aspects of Hailing Island are not perfect and the accommodation conditions are average, Crown Hotel will be a let down. A satisfying choice

The lobby manager is friendly and upgrades the room for us free of charge. The lobby landscape is wide and a**ospheric, which also conceals the lack of soft decoration design in the early years. , but it doesn't matter..., if it wasn't for the "wonderful" experience in the open-air lobby bar in the afternoon, I think the shop is quite intimidating. In other words, we sighed the iced coffee while blowing the sea breeze outside the lobby bar comfortably. , the cleaning staff aunt appeared "just in time" (at two o'clock in the afternoon) and did a lot of cleaning. The sprinkler cleaning was a bit of a disappoin**ent. Suddenly, she asked us to move to another place to sit to facilitate her! guard! pregnancy! Of course, if this is your home, I have nothing to complain about, but this is the afternoon in the lobby bar of the five-star hotel, the prime time when the guests of the hotel pay for a vacation, of course I refuse! So the two cleaning staff continued to clean around us, and the water splashed from time to time. The lobby was full of people at that time. Such arrangements and actions were beyond my normal thinking and judgment of a hotel, not to mention the five-star hotel...

If you want to go on vacation, you can decisively choose Poly Crowne Plaza Hotel with more mature services. It is one of the few five-star hotels on Hailing Island. The price is high for a reason.
The room is super large. I remember that I should be in the East Wing Room, 2828, on the highest 8th floor. It has an unbeatable sea view. You can see it even when lying down. I woke up the next day because of the sun. I realized how pity it was. If I had gotten up earlier, my room could directly watch the sunrise over the sea🌅~
The journey is inevitably regrettable, and I look forward to setting off again next time.
ps. Thanks to Miss Janey at the front desk for upgrading me~ Off-peak hours have their benefits~

msg:Stayed for two nights and had a good experience. I brought my children here. The facilities in the room are very convenient for a family of three, and the staff service is also very good. The price/performance ratio is very high, and the noise problems reflected in many negative reviews, such as singing and fireworks, have also been encountered but not very serious. The room is clean and the equipment is aging (such as peeling paint on the walls, etc.) but it does not affect the stay. I didn't give a high score because there are several flaws that I think affect the comfort of the stay:
1. When checking in, the daily temperature will reach 34 degrees, the air humidity is very high, and the air conditioner in the room is OK, but the public places such as the lobby are completely without air conditioner, and the air conditioner in the breakfast and children's play area is useless, which makes people very uncomfortable;
2. The curtains in the bedroom have a high degree of shading, which is an advantage, but the lights in the wardrobe can't be turned off. Even if the wardrobe door is closed, the light will still come out. You need to find a way to block it with a towel, so sleep needs to be completely dark. The environment is very unfriendly to guests.

 Crowne Plaza Poly Yangjiang Hailing Island is the only international five-star hotel brand on Hailing Island. If you want to experience a comfortable environment and perfect detail service, you will not step in the pit.

🏨Hotel environment/ 🛏Room facilities: The hotel was built in 2013. The appearance is high-end and elegant, but the decoration hardware is indeed old and faded. Fortunately, there is no obvious damage, so the maintenance is still qualified.
The hotel is equipped with many entertainment facilities, especially the large indoor playground and outdoor children's recreational water area for children. Big friends can experience swimming, fitness, tennis, chess and cards, and a mini K room.

🖼Restaurant environment/🍽Dining recommendation: The hotel has Chinese restaurant, western food/buffet restaurant and barbecue restaurant. However, I have no experience except for breakfast. Personally, I think the price/performance ratio is not high.

📝Note tips: If you want to go to the beach, you can walk directly to it, but the beach is public, and all businesses are not part of the hotel.

Then again, what I can't accept at all:
The guide is really bad! Difference! Difference! That room number plate, if you are not careful, you will miss it. The room number at the door of the room, you can't see it clearly unless you look closely! The first time I was looking for a room, I had a headache.

The second hotel is a bit old, the decoration of the room is too dark inside and outside, I don't like it. Afternoon tea is even more unpalatable. The pastries are like steamed buns without steaming. Don't buy them. We give them away. The hotel meal is really expensive. One meal for three adults. The two children are more than 500 yuan, and there is no food. The next day I stayed at Beiluo Secret Realm Hotel. The decoration was new. The quilt was super soft and warm. What's more, the buffet food was delicious. The island feels different from other seasides, and the crown is like an ordinary seaside hotel, nothing special. The whole family said that they should live in the secret realm, and the price is much cheaper.

The environment is very comfortable, the park is very large, the room is big enough, and the quilt is clean. It was the first day I arrived. Because of the weather, the room is very humid. Because of the seaside, Yangjiang is still quite cold in winter. The weather is 13 degrees. The air conditioner in the room has no heating. The quilt is summer. It is a sea-view hotel in the south, and heating is still necessary. The service is still very friendly, if I go there next time I will choose here

msg:To be honest, choosing to live in the crown is nothing but recognition of the five-star hardware and environment, and of course service is also one of the considerations. But this time, I am very disappointed with the old crown. If I come to the seaside of Hailing Island in winter, if there is no brand complex, it is recommended to stay in a newer economic hotel nearby, which should be better than it. I booked a superior sea view room. When I checked in, I was told that it was not a sea view, and the double bed could only be a side sea view room, which was misleading by Ctrip. When I checked into the room, it was a pity to find that there was no screen door for entering and leaving the balcony. The room service told me that there were no mosquitoes in the high place. I continued to ask, what about the summer? What if I don't live on the 8th floor, but only on the 2nd and 3rd floor? It is uncomfortable to change the air without the screen door. Then there is the air conditioner. On the day I checked in, it was only 12 degrees at night. I found that such a high-end hotel only has air-conditioning, no heating, and even a budget hotel can have the hardware, but it does not have it. I asked room service, and I literally said it was too cold. To a certain extent, I ask, where are the buttons? Can't tell. Nuoda's bathrooms are all separated by sliding doors, and there is no shading between the shower and toilet, so this separation of dry and wet is meaningless. Only one person can use it in the bathroom, which is comfortable. The stopper of the wash basin is broken and has not been repaired. The sliding door is super difficult to move, and it is usually not lubricated and maintained. After watching the Winter Olympics, I found that the TV is also old, and the quality is very low, but it is not as good as the newly opened Jingjiu. The crown has not been renewed for so many years. The most unacceptable thing is the deadly service. On the day of the departure, the concierge was not enough, and he did not take the initiative to explain a few words. We had a lot of luggage. My daughter ran to the lobby to push the luggage cart out. The luggage was loaded into the car one by one, and then pushed into the lobby. Other staff members in the hotel saw it, and none of them felt embarrassed. I let my daughter and I free service carts to the front desk for check-in, and the mood was cold. After staying in the hotel for 2 days, I called the room service several times. I wanted to add a quilt and 2 more bottles of water. The customer service delivered it, but the most embarrassing thing is that she has to sign and write a good review for her after delivery. 😮 ‍💨I have stayed at a lot of five-stars, but this is the first time I have been kidnapped and praised by these five-star services so lowly. On, I left a note after cleaning every day, but I didn't clean the cup (I found the cup still stained with tea when I checked in), stayed 2 nights, when I cleaned the next day, I took away the quilt I wanted more, and I had to It's annoying to take the phone once and have to sign the praise again when you take it again! In fact, there are still a lot of details in the room, not much to say, next time you stay in Hailing Island, you will not live in the most expensive crown.

2. The room is a parent-child room, and the cost is close to 2800. Not to mention a bunch of mosquitoes, but the equipped fan is all kinds of abnormal noises;

3. Fireworks can be burned all night, and young children can’t sleep for long. They burn fireworks all night, and there is no basic humaneness at all;

msg:Worst IHG Hotel in the World!
You can't even guarantee the most basic rest of the guests, what else can you do?

I am now going to make a bad review, or a serious complaint, about the supporting services and attitudes around the hotel! I've never been so angry before! Alarmed!

1. As a five-star hotel, the takeaway is not arranged for delivery. It is not very convenient for legs and feet in the past few days.
2. Since it was a weekend, I wanted to come and relax in peace. But I never expected that the hotel outsourced activities around the weekend, and that's fine. The most annoying thing is that it seriously affected the experience of the stay and the mood.
Our room is a sea view room on the 7th floor, but from the afternoon, the venue facing the sea view began to play disco music. The sound was so loud that it was difficult for people to rest after the double-layer soundproof glass of the hotel was closed. I was already very tired. I originally wanted to take a break before dinner, but it started to make noises before 5 pm, exactly like an open-air dance bar. Just think about it at first. After all, the company built a team, and they didn't find the hotel to complain. The key is here! ! !
When we got to the room at 10 o'clock in the evening, the group of people had already started to sing Karaoke K, the kind that was played in the open air. The voice was out of tune and the words were vulgar. It continued until 12 o'clock in the middle of the night without any intention of stopping. At 11:45 p.m., I couldn't stand it anymore, so I called the front desk of the hotel to complain.
This is the beach inside the hotel, and we say outsourced?
Even if it is outsourced, isn't it within its own management responsibility? ? ?
From the beginning to the end, except for some five-star hotel facilities that can meet the standard, the surrounding services and special situations (such as outsourcing services, how can we reasonably solve the problem of resting guests, etc.) There is no difference.
Okay, so if your beach is outsourced, isn't the deafening sound of your activities on the doll pool in the afternoon not the hotel's problem?
Please, you are IHG, are you the best top hotel service provider in the world?
It is actually allowed to have outsourcers on this Bund beach in front of your hotel, and the singing disturbs the people. Fortunately, the wind direction of the barbecue did not blow to the hotel, but only to the sea. I believe that guests who want to go to the beach in the early morning of the second day, It would have been nice to relax.
Be sure to see this mess, those guests have the remains of fireworks, discarded beer bottles and barbecue skewers, and garbage! As you can imagine, there will be more!
I could have stepped on the beach with bare feet, but now it looks like this!
This is the beach you give us, this is the experience you give us, and this is the best service you give us in the world! ?
Shouldn't you just rent it out and give us guests a fresh, clean beach? Completely inconsistent with the positioning, no difference with the market?

3. The last point I just want to say is that since it is a five-star hotel and the Crowne Plaza that we have always trusted, it should not be like this. The purpose of staying at the sea view is to relax and clean. The hotel will deal with such a thing. , let the guests staying very disappointed, disappointed! There are so many sea-view hotels around, why did you choose your home? Did you choose to listen to the unpleasant out-of-tune music that the foreigners sang to us on the weekend? ? Lying on the sofa and seeing the hotel's promotional image "Sleeping Choice" on the TV, I just find it particularly ironic. Is this the quality of sleep you want to provide to our guests at the hotel?
Your hotel should really reflect on how to deal with this problem! ! !

The bathroom was separated from wet and dry. There was a large bathtub, but I was useless. There are two balconies with a good view of the nearby golf course. The hotel has a large garden, with outdoor and indoor swimming pools, as well as children's play pools. The beach is not far away, but the beach is actually not part of the hotel operation and management. It costs money to play water projects or rent chairs and umbrellas. The sand on the beach is quite fine, but the quality of the seawater is very average. Overall, I recommend this hotel very much. It is a relatively big brand, and it must be guaranteed. However, it depends on my personal preference. I personally don't like other Internet celebrity hotels very much.

msg:There was no concierge at the entrance of the hotel and no parking instructions. There was only one person stuck at the side entrance and asked to scan the QR code and check in coldly, and blamed the customer for not cooperating. The attitude of the front desk was also very indifferent, and there was no basic information about the hotel information, which caused us to not even know when to eat breakfast and where to eat, and the information instructions of the room were not clear enough. We stayed in a sea-view room for two consecutive nights. The front desk gave us the lowest floor and told us that we would have to wait for another room for an hour. When we arrived at the hotel, it was already after 2:30 in the afternoon. Except for the cleaning staff on the first floor where we lived, the service consciousness and attitude of the hotel staff were very poor, and they would never take the initiative to greet guests without the slightest smile. The room has a big musty smell, the mattress is uncomfortable, and the bedding is very hard. The sewer in the shower has a bad smell. The supporting facilities of the entire hotel are relatively simple. The breakfast is not tasty. In short, it is a resort hotel that has been in disrepair and has poor service attitude. Unless the price is very cheap, it is not recommended to come.

msg:First, let me tell you something interesting. Actually, I was a customer of a golf package at first. We went to the front desk to check in. The front desk was served by waitress Luo Hailing. When she saw the package, her attitude was beyond words (like she was a customer and I was a waitress 😀). Then she told me that the room was being cleaned and I had to wait for more than an hour (I had just finished playing golf and was sweating). I told her, can I have other rooms? She told me that there were, and upgrading to other rooms would cost extra, 200 for side sea view, 500 for sea view. I said forget it, and then asked her if she couldn't arrange any room for me? I needed to take a shower, and she told me that she didn't have one. Then, what's even more interesting is that I said that if I booked it on Ctrip, I would definitely complain to her. In the end, she actually told me that there was a room and she could give it to me first. After listening to her, I asked her why you said no just now (because she didn't confirm with the housekeeping department whether it was cleaned and how long it would take. This is what every hotel must do, and I believe you five-star hotels understand it better). I said I also work in the hotel. She suddenly said, this is the rule of our hotel. There is a task. I really didn't know whether to laugh or cry. I thought why I couldn't get a room first without paying extra money, and I had to wait. Or I was a customer who bought a package ticket, but later I didn’t want it, so I canceled it and chose to book a new room on Ctrip. At this time, I came to the front desk again. When he saw that I booked it through Ctrip and booked the room in person, his attitude suddenly changed 360 degrees, which suddenly reminded me of **’s video, and I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. The person is still the same person, how can he be so hypocritical😄. After that, I checked in smoothly. From this incident, I felt that staying in a five-star hotel really has differences in wealth, so I booked a room for more than 1,300 yuan, alas, just to experience the feeling of rich people😄. Haha, and there is no reception at the door of the five-star hotel. In the end, it is really the worst five-star hotel I have ever experienced in the country. It’s over😱

msg:I stayed for 3 nights during the Mid-Autumn Festival. It was really nice. There are mountains and seas on Hailing Island. It really faces the sea and the spring flowers bloom. The hotel has indoor and outdoor swimming pools, gymnasiums, Chinese and Western restaurants, and baby playrooms. Xiaoqi and Hailing at the front desk were very warm and thoughtful. They asked for cleanliness and security in the hotel, and the hotel did everything in detail. I don't know if the sound insulation itself is good or what, it's really not noisy anyway, and it's super quiet every day. The hotel also presented a 1-hour travel photo. The travel photographer Mr. Yue Yang was super punctual, patient and meticulous, and helped to start shooting on time at 7 o'clock in the morning. On the last day of this hotel, it was her mother’s birthday. Hailing and the beauties at the bar in the lobby had ideas on how to store cakes, how to hide cakes, and how to arrange dinner. In short, it was super sweet. Really is a good holiday choice. I wake up every day and do nothing. It is also great to rest in the hotel. Thanks for the service, I will come again later.

msg:I am very satisfied this time! We are a family trip. We booked a garden view room and finally upgraded to a front sea view room. Our family is very satisfied! Invincible sea view, wake up at five in the morning and watch the sky full of stars and a little bit of sunrise. Breakfast and buffet dinner are up to normal standards, suitable for couples and parent-child travel. The parking lot has a ba*****t, so the car will not be exposed to the sun. There are two points that need to be mentioned: 1. The beach is a little disappointing, not particularly clean. 2. The large bathroom of the sea view room is open, and the drainage needs to be improved. The entire large bathroom (including the toilet) is full of water. Finally, thank you Carson Yu Shaoming, the front desk manager, for his warm service and professionalism. This time it was good overall!

msg:The environment and scenery are really good, the air is also very good, it is really blessed, but the service of the hotel is blind to such good external conditions. A very important reason why I like to live in Crowne Plaza is that the breakfast is good and the afternoon tea is very humane. But neither of these two things are reflected in you. In the off-season, there are not many people and there are few types of breakfast, which is understandable, but the quality is not good enough. The orange juice was placed in a separate place for ice, I thought it was freshly squeezed, but after taking a sip, I found out that it was an ordinary drink, and it was bitterly sweet! Do you do this to deceive your guests or deceive yourself? ! Not to mention afternoon tea, there are language traps in the order. I can eat afternoon tea for two people in one bite, while others are self-service exquisite snacks. The afternoon tea time is marked on Ctrip, and different front desks have different opinions. The service quality of yours is worthy of such a good environment and scenery.

The baby had a great time. Hotel facilities are well-equipped. There is a children’s room club. If you don’t want to bask in the sun, go to the children’s club to play Bobo pool, slides, and billiards. The beach of the hotel is also very clean, the water is blue and the sand is very fine. At that time, the waves were relatively big and swimming was forbidden. The bathtub in the room is also very big, and I arranged a bubble bath for the baby after staying for two nights. I called the free follow-up service. The photographer Yue Yang is very professional. He took a lot of blockbusters. I didn’t expect to be able to take such great photos for free. I’m very satisfied!

msg:The experience of this trip was pretty good. I wanted to go on vacation temporarily, so the biggest parent-child room that I wanted to book is no longer available. It is also good to book a slightly smaller parent-child poolside room. The pool is not very small, enough for a family of four to play in the water. The rooms are decorated in cartoon theme, which children like very much. I have to mention the front desk manager: Carson Yu Shaoming's service is really enthusiastic and professional. We just remembered that we didn't prepare a birthday cake for the baby. Asked him to help, and immediately ordered a one-pound cake for us, which was given as a gift. Let our purpose of this outing (to help our daughter celebrate her birthday) perfectly ended. The afternoon tea three-layer cake and two cups of coffee in the lobby of the hotel are very affordable because they are discounted. The buffet is also not bad. In general, if you are on a beach holiday near Guangdong, the price/performance ratio is quite high. My small opinion is: I hope the room service can be more timely, maybe the hotel is bigger, the rooms are more, or it may be the end of the tourist season, so the service will have to wait a long time, I hope it will be improved next time! Then there can be more leisure packages on the beach!

msg:For the garden-view room, Feng Lidan, who checked in, helped Ctrip to upgrade the reservation to the side sea view, and the process was very fast. I like it. The outdoor swimming pool of the hotel is good, and there are a lot of mosquitoes when I sit and wait for the indoor swimming pool. The beach is very clean, you can pick up a lot of small shells, you can play water sports if you like excitement, and some people set off fireworks on the beach at night. But the room facilities are still old, and the seaside is very salty. There are not many types of breakfast. Generally, the orange plastic cups are out of grade. The Chinese restaurant produces good products and the price is slightly higher. There are many seafood food stalls. The waiter in the lobby was very clingy, standing lazily, and didn't take the initiative to provide umbrellas when going out to pick up the car under heavy rain. Generally speaking, if the facilities are a bit old, it is worth coming again.

msg:I came to Hailing Island with my family and chose Crowne Plaza, an authentic five-star hotel, instead of the Internet celebrity homestay. It was a wise move! First of all, I booked a garden-view room on Ctrip, and it was automatically upgraded to an invincible sea-view room at the front desk (I booked it on Sunday and Monday for two nights). It was a great morale! The lobby of the hotel is very large and comfortable. The rooms are also very large, with a balcony facing southeast and facing the beach. The next day I set the alarm clock at 6:00 and watched the sunrise on the balcony! It's awesome! The staff are very polite and the sanitation facilities are also very good. In short, they are very satisfied!
       There are many kinds of breakfast, which is quite satisfactory. The hotel has an indoor swimming pool and children's playground facilities, enough for half a day in the sunny day. We went to the beach to play at 4 or 5 in the afternoon when there was no sun (which happens to be a shower from time to time). We walked through the landscape and the outdoor swimming pool and it was the beach. Our son came to the beach for the first time. The beach seems to be open to the public, but there are not many people (maybe it’s a good time to choose). Surfing on the beach and seaside is free. However, there are third-party operations. What beach umbrellas and stools (10 yuan/piece) are If you want money, if you want to swim in the sea, there is a special fenced place, it costs 59 yuan per person (it seems to be), and it is 130 yuan per motorboat to swim in a life jacket.

1. The hotel has rich facilities for children, so children don’t have to worry about playing around by themselves (except on the beach).
2. The water on the beach is fine and the sand is fine. It was unexpectedly found that there is a lot of white sand in the sand. The hand digs it out four or five. Several people squatted on the beach and dug for half an hour and gained several kilograms. In the evening, they processed and ate at the restaurant. Sand, but the fruits of your labor are also happy to eat sand😁
3. There is a non-hotel-operated open-air camp next to the hotel beach. Karaoke at night, although the noise will not disturb the people (the room glass has better sound insulation), but it will reduce the grade of the hotel. It can be understood that this item is beyond the control of the hotel.
4. The room facilities and hotel decoration have a sense of age, and it would be better if they can be refurbished appropriately.
Overall, it was a very pleasant stay experience.

The service is especially attentive. Xiao Huang, the small butler Xiao Hua, and Xiao Zeng took the trouble to solve my problems and delivered sugar water before 8 o'clock.

msg:Although this is not a new hotel, I was impressed by the unique location of Silver Beach, which is suitable for the elderly and children to play, so I do not hesitate to choose to spend a holiday here. The hotel’s parking lot is very large, and Hai Ling Meimei at the front desk is very kind and kind, caring for the elderly accompanying her.
Since the dinner buffet was not open, they could only have dinner at the Zhongxiao Hall. The elders specially ordered the local special spring Amomum villosum stew. The service and dishes were all good.
Indoor heated swimming pool, the water is cold, but there are really very few people.
The room is quite spacious. Although it has a side sea view, the balcony can be used to look around the golf course. You can also watch the sunrise in the morning, but it is a pity that the clouds flooded the fireball.
There are not many varieties of buffet breakfast, but it has local characteristics. The soup base of horse noodles and seafood porridge is delicious.
There is a seafood street outside the hotel, and the Hysi Museum next door is convenient for visiting and eating the next day. You can also go to Mawei Island to relax and have a full schedule.

The water should be disinfected. You can smell the disinfectant, but I don’t know how often to change the water. The hotel has its own playground, which is quite big. Recommend the hotel's Chinese restaurant, it is very suitable for bringing children, the fried beef with basil and lime is delicious😋. There are 2 sets of children's utensils in the parent-child room, which is quite good.

Check-in was handled by the front desk manager Carson, very professional. , I also upgraded our room, went to the room, and immediately there was a waiter to help us make the bed, make the bed around, it was very intimate when I went out to eat at night, and also sent sugar water, packed in a thermos, so heartwarming, thank you An Qiha, Help me get things to freeze, thank you, check out, the front desk is **ling, sorry, I forgot my name for too long, I sent the doll to my daughter, thank you, you will stay here next time!

msg:Before leaving, I looked at several Internet celebrity hotels in Hailing Island, and finally chose the old brand. I have no regrets at all! That's great!

For the seaside hotel, the surrounding facilities are complete. There are convenience stores, restaurants, hospitals, and so on. There are also shared electric cars next to the hotel. If you don't want to drive, it is very pleasant to ride a small electric donkey to eat seafood or something.

The lobby of the hotel is very big. Although the hardware looks a little bit historical, it is well maintained, the stay is very comfortable, and the hygiene is very meticulous.

I stayed in the open-style poolside parent-child room on the first floor. The room has a large sense of space. There is enough space for the two children to make noise. The corners of the tables and chairs in the room are all posted with child protection corners, which is very intimate! There are also children's toothbrushes, slippers and small bathrobes. The huge round bathtub in the bathroom is amazing! The outdoor swimming pool space is quite large, and children and adults have fun in it. You will occasionally see one or two ants next to the swimming pool, but it is understandable that the surrounding environment is well maintained. Close the windows at night, otherwise there will be mosquitoes, although there are electric mosquito lamps and liquid mosquito coils in the room.
It’s worth suggesting that there is a small tent in the room, which should be decorated for the parent-child theme, but that tent is unstable. The child can easily fall down when touched. I put the tent away for safety. Actually, the parent-child room Some toys and dolls can be properly placed in the room, which makes children happier and safer than this kind of tent.

The hotel has two swimming pools, indoor and outdoor, and the water is very clean. The beach is just outside, and it takes about 5 minutes to walk out. Walking out of the hotel, the beach passes through the hotel’s garden. The greening is very good, but you must spray mosquito repellent water in advance. The mosquitoes are very poisonous. Seeing that there are hot springs, it should be because the epidemic situation has not been open. The sand on the beach is very fine, and the entire beach is also very clean. We go there on weekdays, or maybe because of the epidemic, there are no people and it is very comfortable. The beach in front of the hotel cannot go to the sea. If you want to go to the sea, you have to pay to the beach next to it. The waves in this sea are very big, and it is not suitable for children to go into the sea. I think it is very good to dig small shells and small sand crabs to pile sand on the shore.

I have to mention this trip, the hotel's service is really good! Absolutely worthy of the brand, the best service I have ever stayed in this year. Every employee is very friendly, polite and smiling. As soon as we got off the car, Bellboy helped us with the luggage. He mentioned the room from the check in and kept mentioning the car for us when we left.
Especially Miss Hai Ling at the front desk, arranged for me super, and the service was very caring and in place. Hailing helped me upgrade my room, also helped me apply for a late check-out, and provided me with a free ticket to the vip beach. I always come to play without making a strategy, Hailing will tell me the fun places around. The day of check-in is my birthday. The birthday decorations are made in the room early. Hailing will confirm with me the time when the cake will be delivered to the room, which is very comfortable.
During the stay, whenever there is a need, call the guest service center, which can provide what you need in less than 5 minutes, which is quite efficient. During the epidemic prevention period, Anxin Packs are also intimately provided, including disposable hand sanitizers, masks, and disinfectant wipes. In the evening, sweet water was also given, which is great!
The aunt who is in charge of room hygiene is also quite responsible. She will also consult and see where improvements can be made and write greeting cards. There will be a little leaf floating down in the outdoor swimming pool, and there will be a cleaning uncle to help clean the pool.
This kind of service really deserves a five-star rating!
It's a pity that the buffet is only open on weekends, and we didn't enjoy it when we came. The breakfast buffet is open in the executive corridor. There are not many varieties, but the things are quite fresh.

Overall this is a great experience! I want to come again next time.

Before going there, Mila informed about the precautions for epidemic prevention and control, and also helped to upgrade the room. After arriving at the hotel, sister Miko gave the child toys.
However, the air-conditioning in the room that was not lucky enough to stay in at night was broken and it was hot all night. But the front desk quickly changed another room the next day. It is worth staying.

值得讚揚的是早餐還可以！

雖然天公不作美，但是酒店的體驗完全不影響出遊心情，小童遊樂場，湯泉，海灘讓你可以放鬆遛娃。行程前管家YOYO就做了温馨提醒，給孩子貼心準備了小童用品，春節期間舉辦了很多豐富的活動，全家老少出遊非常開心。

環境：升級了海景房，早七點躺在床上看海上日出格外震撼。酒店花園裡適合散散步以及推娃睡覺，走出酒店花園就是沙灘，人少乾淨，沙軟細膩，全家玩得開心。

服務：服務貼心，友好和善。因寶寶在房間睡覺，打掃服務推遲多次，工作人員都積極主動溝通解決。提供歡迎水果和晚安牛奶，驅蚊液和手環，礦泉水充足。

開業的時候來過，現在來酒店設施太舊，房間味道黴味很重，進房間沒多久眼睛癢喉嚨不舒服，衞生也差，房間地板、床單上都是沙，搞完衞生沒人檢查嗎？衞生堪憂，服務也差，外賣不準外賣員送到房間可以理解，但酒店的人也拒絕送到房間，自己去取，卻是在酒店外面，走過一段黑乎乎的路，才找到外賣的桌子，多麼恐怖的事，有考慮過客人安全？ 送到房間不安全，讓客人下去拿更安全？外賣桌子壓根不在大堂，而是在外面 還要走一段黑乎乎的路，價格匹配不上五星級酒店的品質和服務 

房間紙巾都沒，要去廁所拿紙巾擦手。
還有酒店泳池，沙灘服務亭，就算是淡季或是冬天，也要維持維護好五星級的標準，可是，這裏就像荒廢了，充電寶的機器被拔掉了線，倒在角落，臟兮兮，亭子也像垃圾站，一點沒五星級的樣子
每個服務人員都懶惰，沒點精神樣子，不想幹活那種，哪像五星級樣子。非常不建議去 。

酒店從靠海一邊出去就是十里銀灘，瞬間就可以融入大海和海上娛樂項目的懷抱，十分方便。離南海1號博物館很近，沒事的話步行都可以到達。
雖然遇到了兩場不小的雨，但酒店的設施和項目可以填補在酒店泡着的時間，一點也不無聊。
酒店集娛樂，餐飲，休閑為一體，度假的感覺滿滿。
因為天氣和時間安排的原因，特色項目沒有去體驗。
總之一切都不錯，值得推薦。

msg:臨時決定帶媽媽來海陵島玩兩天，挑來看去還是皇冠假日更有底一些。到達酒店大堂，果然很大氣。管家yoyo幫忙升級了海景房，簡直驚艷了：大床房海景一覽無遺，雙床房園景如畫，早起就有客人在高爾夫球場打球了，生機勃勃。
早餐也不錯，吃了意式蛋卷，鮮烤紅薯，手工餛飩…最後喝了一杯美式咖啡完美收官！對了，第一天下午茶的拿破崙蛋糕真是絕絕子，味道棒極了！！
感謝Yoyo的管家服務，下次還會再來！

msg:來之前看了網上這家酒店的一些點評，心裏雖然有點忐忑，但因為之前出遊選民宿踩過雷，加上感覺海陵島並不是旅遊服務設施開發非常完善的地方，所以還是傾向選大品牌的酒店。可能正是因為出行前的這種心理，讓這段行程有了很多超乎尋常的驚喜。

先説服務，到店前一天酒店就安排了專屬管家Yuki小姐姐和我對接確認行程瞭解需求。瞭解到我們是第一次來海陵島度假，Yuki很貼心地發來了島上景點的攻略，還給我們免費升級了正面看海的房型，並且告訴我們有什麼問題都可以直接聯繫她。在島上旳幾天裏，不管是諮詢景點行程還是問路求助，Yuki每次都很快很耐心地答覆問題提供幫助，讓人感覺很安心很踏實。

再説設施，酒店的裝修不算新，但室內區域還是比較講究的，房間內部小細節也都很注意，讓人住的很舒服。住店免費停車，地下車場車位充足，還有專門的充電車位，自駕來也很方便。
户外區域，總體環境和景觀還是很好的，但可能因為季節原因，湯泉沒有開放，沙灘餐吧在裝修，通往沙灘的路線指引不是很清晰，晚上的路側照明也稍暗了些。
沙灘區域可能不是酒店直接管理的原因，有一些商户在經營，如果是看海發呆的話還是在房間陽台或者大堂吧好一些。

早餐方面，品類還是比較齊全的，既有常規品類，也有一些當地特色，時間從早上7點一直到中午11點，這點還是相當友好的。

交通配套方面，酒店位置在島南岸中間偏西的位置，下高速幾分鐘車程就到，距離閘坡鎮和大角灣這些比較熱鬧的地方開車都在十分鐘左右，還是比較方便的。
酒店出來右轉就是保利樓盤配套的商業街，有一些餐廳和店鋪。如果是自駕的話，更推薦大角灣和閘坡鎮上的餐廳，有很多當地人常去的好館子。

酒店設施略為陳舊，清潔度勉強還可以。

因為西餐廳維修，所以要轉到中餐廳用自助早餐。用餐區地方非常細小，剛巧遇着有團隊活動，人流相當之多，用餐感覺非常之差劣，食物供應種類亦少，服務人手亦不足。

酒店位置絕佳，沙攤媲美馬爾代夫，沒見過如此美麗的海灘。

順帶一提，沙灘不屬於酒店範圍，是政府管理的。沙灘有一個很大的缺點，就是容許汽油沙灘車穿梭於沙灘上，使 一個天然美景糟蹋成為一個充滿廢氣噪音的公路。希望有關當局明察，不要糟蹋了這個沙灘，它是吸引遊客到來最主要的原因。

酒店的早餐我衹能説能吃得飽，品種不多，補充速度比較慢。
房間的衞生有待提高，地板上的沙子還是挺多的。
另外，再提個小建議，酒店有很多邊邊角角的地方都挺鋒利的，應該找點什麼東西給擋一下，小孩子很容易撞到，我的孩子就在走廊轉角的木頭上撞了一下，眼角都腫了，如果剛好撞上眼睛後果不敢想。希望酒店重視起來。

msg:從皇冠假日酒店的服務，我知道了洲際真的比萬豪差！問多送份早餐，死活怎麼都不行，即便説萬豪每次都可以送，説了萬豪比洲際的優秀之處，皇冠假日還是一如既往不願提升客户體驗！15點入駐，竟然沒房，説都沒退，你當我**啊15點全都沒退？一氣之下，我要投訴找了主管，馬上就有房了，這不是信口開河的騙子麼？總而言之，客人要的他們都沒有都不可以都不願意，他們可以給的也不給。即便我説要網上公開服務體驗，他們也無所謂，這就是洲際！！！！！！希望大家以後好好比較比較萬豪和洲際，體驗他們給到的不同服務，就是差，而且不怕投訴的差！！！！！！希望萬豪早日把洲際吃了，這麼貴還這麼差！！！！！！

msg:設施：酒店很老舊，無論是整體裝修還是設施設備都很舊了。並且維護的不算好。
衞生：可以看得出來，春節期間客流量大，整體的衞生維護壓力很大。但是，客房清潔沒有做到按量更換布草，例如我們入住的房間；地面吸水墊和浴衣衹做到了把臟的收走，沒做到更新。最讓我覺得不能忍受的是：房間有一股很大的發黴的味道（類似於洗浴中心的臟拖鞋的味道）；雖然給了我們香薰，但是！這不應該是一個日均價格1400+的酒店的水平和衞生管理能力。
環境：酒店可以直接走到海灘，對於海濱浴場都要收費的海陵島來説，這個確實很Nice。而且酒店草坪的半自助BBQ很不錯，環境很好。
服務：酒店的服務總的來説還不錯。入住前與銷售就我確認行程了，很感謝Ruby對我的幫助，幫我提前安排好了房間，並且貼心的幫我提前簽收了快遞。很感謝。並且酒店的餐飲服務也還不錯。在春節早餐就餐壓力很大的情況下，清掃比較及時，出餐也很快。

總的來説，這個酒店的價格和它的硬件設施是完全不匹配的。酒店需要翻新維護了。特別是多個房間都有很難聞的受潮以後的惡臭味，這一點，真的希望酒店的管理方可以好好的處理和解決一下。


天麓山海景區門票:值得去看一下，近距離的看到大風車，也可以看到海陵島的全貌。
尊享2大1小天海湯泉:温泉可以去泡一下，露天的，泡池維護的不錯，比較乾淨。

環境：不乾淨，舊，陽台推拉門關閉了，太差了！頂不順！
服務：因為要出沙灘，叫前台拿多兩對膠鞋，前台告訴我，房間標配是2雙鞋+一雙小孩鞋！這是親子房，我3700元一碗晚的價格，不包晚餐！就是這樣子的服務態度，差的要死，你愛來不來的感覺！一定不會再來！不要踩坑！我很少寫評論，但是這家酒店，我頂不順！

msg:1.寫明的Checkin 時間不能準時入住，叫我們等至少40分鐘；出去玩了一趟，結果回來衞生還沒搞完，關鍵是最後還是搞的很臟，臟到難以接受。地板什麼的臟兮兮。甚至比不上普通一般酒店。走到一樓池畔房外面居然有一陣很臭的味道。
2.在線訂單我是信譽免擔保的，結果入住的時候前台另收我按金，詢問原因態度冷談。
3.設施老舊發黴；比如淋浴間窗簾；淋浴水龍頭開關部件掉落；
4.親子房上下鋪床的質量堪憂，睡上鋪的孩子動一下牀板就會響。有個裝飾性部件安裝的不牢固，小孩輕輕一碰居然掉了，弄的小孩好痛，安全問題。
5.其中一間衞生間顯得更臟，裏面有蚊子。
6.硬件方面還是不錯的，高爾夫球場、小童遊樂、室內室外泳池，酒店自己的沙灘等等。
7.軟件，服務跟不上，態度不好，很敷衍顧客的感覺。房間包含的各種門票也不給提醒，問前台回覆都很敷衍愛理不理的。也沒有什麼友情提醒例如早餐在哪棟樓吃，反正就是自足自給吧。
8.早餐比較稀爛的地方是位置不夠坐，找位置花好多時間，一家人也無法坐一起。早餐樣式和質量就一般吧。
9.不知道是不是環保考慮，桌上連一包抽紙都找不到。
10.臨走的時候發現上一位住客留下的吸管出現，可能阿姨打掃的時候沒看見，反正這樣的衞生標準我在同等價格，同等星級的酒店沒有見過。

光是這點，估計再來不會選擇這裏了，北洛雖然房間不是酒店層次，但起碼沙灘有人打理，也不會這麼吵雜，去各種景點餐館也方便…

酒店外面就是沙灘，但不能下海游泳的，沖浪不存在，游泳交錢。

酒店門口的電動車租賃也是坑，200多一天，下去一點就是大把的電動車租賃，20元一天。

2. 晚上去吃飯，酒店大堂的電瓶車把我們拉到了一個”銀海宋城魚村”。5大5小吃了2100元，問題是海鮮有問題，三個大人拉了好幾天，一個小孩細菌感染趟了兩天，回來深圳繼續打點滴

3.  酒店設施老舊，好多地方都裂開了，配不上5星。

4. 乘興而來，敗興而歸。總體感覺酒店不太歡迎遊客，抱怨暑假太忙，人手不夠。最後衹能鎚子上場

1.電視太不清晰了，畫面很模糊，勉強看了一會兒春晚！眼睛都不舒服了！2210房；

2.早餐地方的地板很滑，走路要小心，擔心長者孩子會摔倒；

3.訂房包含的“晚飯套餐”，從下午5:30-7:30一直在溝通，先説沒預訂沒辦法提供，後經電話，親自到前台溝通多次，後來發現確實無位，有位置有預訂的都等50分鐘了也出不了餐，現場嘈雜混亂！

4.將近晚上8:00有人送餐到房間，前面溝通有提到，如果用餐位不夠我們可以在房間吃，所以當時還蠻感謝，結果第二天退房時，按金1000元，退回9.56元，電話諮詢説是訂餐的費用；

疑問❓：
1.我從來沒訂過餐，送過來的以為是訂房時包括的“套餐”，
2.如果是送錯了，我們確實也食用了，可以付款，請適當優惠即可；不要一口咬定是我訂的，如果我已訂餐不可能7:30還在與前台溝通，後發現你們確無充分的接待能力，才決定自己解決，讓老公開車去買些晚飯；

3.我們的套餐確實沒有使用，這點應該沒什麼疑問吧？為什麼扣除按金時不予考慮？

説這麼多，也是幾百塊錢的事情，我之前一直予以理解，畢竟三十晚上，所有前台及餐廳工作人員都在努力工作，對我的問題也給以回覆及幫助，一併感謝🙏

一個晚飯問題溝通了太長時間及次數，大過年的人不可能很愉快，我很少寫評價，但這是最最糟糕的一次住宿經歷，年輕時住過的的青年旅社都很温暖，可能三年疫情，專業荒廢太久？

這就是一箇中規中矩的大酒店。周邊環境還可以，沙灘去也方便，吃飯也方便，但進出海灘居然不需要門禁，也沒人管理誰都可以進出。

再説説優點，始終是星級酒店，有自己的底藴，酒店大堂和外面環境舒服，有自己的游泳池和花園，服務也不錯，早餐還可以，可能不是週末人不多，就住的挺舒服的。酒店外面沙灘好漂亮，人少，沙灘美，沙細水清，沒什麼垃圾，但是不能游泳衹能散步。晚上在沙灘吃燒烤吹海風，圓滿了。

The door lock of the room I lived in was also broken, and it took a few swipes to open it entirely by luck, at most a dozen swipes at a time. This is the first time I have encountered such a five-star hotel.

設施：小童設施很多，室內小童樂園非常大，有小童活動早上還有小哥哥帶玩，6歲以下都能玩很開心，下雨不怕沒地方去。

衞生：衞生條件也算是比較好
環境：環節OK，住普通園景房2大2小完全足夠，每天都有水果和水送。
服務：服務OK的，泳池也很多，小童泳場很好玩，水很乾凈，十一期間沒有感受到擁擠，服務各方面也不錯，温泉也可以好玩的。總之玩的多大人小孩都挺多活動。

説説缺點和不足
餐飲：酒店附近有一些電瓶車遊蕩説免費嚇你去吃飯免費送，但吃完不送回去酒店，讓你哪家吃哪家送還打着保利的名號特別不好。酒店和周邊吃飯都比較貴，Spa也貴。
沙灘：有圍起來的沙灘，沙灘是好的，比較漂亮，但是沙灘設施一概無，一張沙灘椅子傘100元，很曬孩子們沒法長時間玩感覺太坑太浪費了。
總體OK，但缺點很明顯。

但是因為淡季，沒有晚餐自助，酒店開放的活動也很少
不過整個酒店房間、面朝大海
衞生乾淨
值得表揚
但是，酒店價格和在攜程標註價格不符！
酒店這點做的有點不合適
差幾分錢也是錢！你不能標註一個價格
實際扣款一個價格
這不是欺騙麼

酒店設施比常規5星酒店稍遜，但是海島酒店來説，也是不錯的，會推薦給朋友。有機會再來。

msg:三亞疫情沒法去，所以來了海陵島。海陵島唯一的五星級酒店，名不副實，衝著親子去的，活動較豐富，衹有這點稍微滿意。
優點：親子活動較海陵島其他酒店豐富，主打親子。離沙灘較近，不收費，衹有旁邊下海游泳的沙灘收費39一人。
缺點：①最不能忍受的是2k+一晚的五星級酒店，到店居然沒人迎接搬行李。離店也沒人搬行李，向前台反應了不冷不熱。這一點嚴重不滿意。② 所住海景房外面就是別的房間，呈90°，別人在陽台能看到你在睡覺，你説這房型尷尬不。③ 房間設施老舊，頂上木板掉落，褪色。整體一股黴味，也有可能是海邊酒店都這樣。④ 週六上午自助早餐換了地方，走的遠而且位置少排隊多，打河粉巨多人，體驗感極低。⑤ 海陵島沙灘燒烤煙花多，影響睡眠。不過和酒店關係也不大，和海陵島整體規劃有關。
總結：因為三亞疫情沒法去，所以換了海陵島。和三亞完全沒法比，不管是人員服務還是整體環境。建議能去三亞就去三亞，來這裏要啥沒啥，真的花了錢還沒享受。住了兩個酒店，一個保利N+，一個這裏。達不到應有的水準。尤其是前台迎賓最能反應一個酒店的服務水平，衹能説不要有過高期待，及格分吧

msg:所謂五星級的服務真是不敢恭維，一千多的酒店完全休現不到價值所在，首先辦理入住慢不説，服務態度極差。房間裏的潤膚露居然是空瓶子？房間設施老舊，五點多的時候問前台自助晚餐時間，告知我是6點至9點的。七點回到酒店才説不是週六日不開放。退房前叫客服拿個布袋，催了三次等了一小時才送到。

msg:前兩天住在距離皇冠7,8km北諾祕境（'掛'個5星，收5星的價位 其實就一公寓改的，大堂小的失禮人，客人多，前台服務人手嚴重不足，排了幾條長隊，電梯小又沒空調，...説好3點可以入住，房間哪個臟呀，4點半都沒搞好衞生... 總之就是差差差... 黑名單，），有比較才知道什麼是5星， 皇冠專業選手由這裏的大門服務生開始，指示停車方向，開門，幫忙搬行李... 最讓人滿意就是前台辦理入住的小姐姐（人美聲甜，叫Janey（ฅ∀＜`๑）♡）, 耐心又高效的一一解答各種問題，還分享實在的優惠政策，協調入住後的各種事項。 其他選手就不一一列舉了，就是5星酒店該有的專業水準，酒店環境，配套泳池，健身房，綠化，餐飲都也很不錯，有圍起來的'獨立'海灘......來海陵島首推皇冠假日👍

msg:海陵島還不錯，臨時決定延住一天，直接酒店辦理了。但第一次碰到五星酒店這樣的管理模式，晚上快十一點了，外面又是煙花又是露天唱吧，鬼哭狼嚎，我是來聽海的，又不是來聽鬼叫的😮‍💨

msg:很少寫評論，經常去打球。每次都是住這家酒店，訂多了一晚海景房間，搞了半天沒弄明白。要求要看高爾夫球場，並且願意加錢。結果第二天把我換去一房30多平米的房間。第一天套票住的是70多平方。我們一共訂了4間房，真的是非常不好👎的體驗。絕對沒有下一次！！！

다만 1층방을 묵었는데 화장실에서 하수구 냄새가 심했습니다. 방에 모기도 있어서 잠을 설쳤습니다. 
이틀 묵었는데 바닥 물걸레 청소를 해주셔서 좋았습니다. 수영장과 해변도 좋았습니다.

msg:老牌5星，設施服務都不錯，最大不足是酒店沒有自己的專屬沙灘，想下海游泳的話去旁邊圍起的收費泳灘，還必須穿救生衣才能下海，十分掃興。

msg:設施：意外的驚喜。已經開業十年的酒店養護得非常不錯，酒店空間設計很多到今天仍然不過時。但是智能設備是缺陷。
衞生：狀況還不錯，清潔比較及時。
環境：非常適合低齡親子度假，離十里銀灘非常近，海景很不錯。
服務：基本滿意。可能因為住店賓客比較多，小童用品沒有送。
海島中國年-新春親子活動: 下午到酒店，説是已經結束了，完全沒有體驗到。
雙人無限次天海湯泉:温泉本來就是住店包含的；
