msg:Excellent location with the Rainbow mall next to hotel and another smaller mall close by. Metro is also a few minutes away so easy to navigate the sights of Beijing. Much appreciation to Elaine in particular and also Mark who worked in the restaurant and assisted my sister during breakfast. She has strict dietary restrictions and they both ensured she had plenty of food and it was suitable for her needs, so thank you both! Hotel lobby and hallways are attractive but room is run down and could do with renovation, the age is showing, however it was manageable for 4 nights. Bedding was changed after two nights, that was appreciated. For 200 extra per night, I added breakfast for two and we had evening snacks/smaller dinner in the executive lounge which was great value. Overall it wouldn’t be my first choice because of the room but customer service from the restaurant and location were both superb!

After booking the hotel for my partner, the hotel staff called me twice to confirm what time my friend will arrive and would she like a room higher up or lower down. 

HOWEVER upon my partner arriving at midnight she was told that there was no rooms available and that she couldn't stay here, even though this was confirmed twice.

Naturally my partner was very upset after a long day of traveling and getting up early for covid tests this was not what she wanted, would you either? It's rather unprofessional of the hotel. As the booking was confirmed and already paid for. I just wonder if the hotel knows how reservations work!

First, Chen Longlong at the front desk is enthusiastic, energetic, handsome and good at service. Add WeChat when arranging check-in, respond to any request, inform attentively, and give a fruit plate. The fatigue after landing was swept away, absolutely thumbs up. Second, the short-haired aunt who cleaned the 15th floor during the stay. When my daughter returned to the hotel after a day of playing in Universal Studios and was very tired, she saw her sleeping doll lying quietly with its legs up beside the pillow, and she instantly felt so warm.

I was a member before and stayed in many Hilton hotels🏨. This hotel is relatively average in terms of hardware. The room is small and the equipment and facilities are a bit old. Compared with housing prices, the price/performance ratio is average. Perhaps this is the drawback of first-tier cities where land is at a premium. The service is very good. It was because Ctrip had already settled the room fee. Maybe there was poor communication between them, so the front desk deducted the room fee and deposit. Dizzy😵

msg:The reason for the trip is that the children are participating in a competition. The hotel is very close to the National Theater and can be walked there. By the way, we also arranged tours and tours. The location is excellent and there is a subway station nearby, making travel convenient. Next to the hotel is Tianhong, where you can quickly replenish supplies.
The room is of medium size, the mattress is slightly soft, the heating is sufficient, the bathroom is large, and it is cleaned every day.
The service staff were very nice. They called me the day before check-in to ask if they had any special needs and even upgraded the room to a higher floor.
Next time I go there, I will choose this hotel.

When you come out to travel, there is no place to put a flat box in the room ... The pumping towels and toiletries are cheaply cheap ... After the shampoo conditioner is used, the hair is very frizzy ... The horns are glass, which is particularly easy to touch the injury. The room I gave is upgraded ... and I can only say "thank you" ... The hotel itself has a lot of money, so I have no breakfast. I don’t have breakfast ...

msg:Nice hotel, convenient transportation and considerate service.
The executive suite has a kitchen with a microwave and electric stove, which can make some simple things.
The bathroom and kitchen equipment are relatively new, the TV is estimated to be 60 inches, and the channels are quite complete. The furniture is a bit old, but the hygiene is good, which can make up for it.
During my stay, the weather was hot and there was no air conditioning. It was all thanks to the patient service of the hotel staff that I was able to stay for several more nights.
The cookies given upon check-in are very authentic and delicious, hope they will continue.
During the afternoon tea, there was a baby-faced waiter who was very friendly and patient, took the initiative to introduce, and provided attentive service.
The price of the hotel's Chinese restaurant is on the high side. What's annoying is that there are hotel staff on site promoting card purchases. I'm a little surprised. Is this what a star-rated hotel should do?
Oh, by the way, the executive lounge is very time-sensitive. It can’t take more than one minute. I arrived at 8:01 and they said it had finished and could not provide service. I saw so much leftover food and I didn’t know how to evaluate it.

My favorite food is Peking duck and mutton hotpot.
The shop assistants are friendly. We couldn't understand Mandarin, so we switched to English to solve the problem. Straight praise 👍
The room is clean and comfortable, but unfortunately stayed for five consecutive nights. Didn't get a chance to upgrade the room, a bit disappointed.
But this seven-day tour is very unforgettable.
Next time I come to Beijing again, I will definitely book Doubletree by Hilton Hotel Beijing.

This hotel is mainly because it is old and looks a bit old, but it is still comfortable to live in. The price during the peak tourist season is twice the usual price. I booked an air ticket➕hotel package, so the price is nearly half cheaper. The accommodation is very close to the subway station, which is better. The cookies sent at check-in are really good and delicious. When I checked out, I also gave two bottles of drinks and two cookies as a gift. There are some places that are not enough, and they are relatively satisfactory.

The process is quick and easy.
Highlights: Convenient travel. It is about 5 minutes walk from Line 7. Line 7 is very close to Beijing West Railway Station and South Railway Station (like 4 stations). Going to the world is just one stop to the end. It is also very convenient to transfer. There are also small supermarkets and shopping malls downstairs, and Mai Kee is opposite. All kinds of convenience. The waiters are also very timely and enthusiastic. 👍
Improvement: Hope the water pipes can be repaired. The room I was given for the first time smelled like a toilet as soon as the door was opened, so I proposed to change the room and deal with it soon👍. After changing the room, there was no such problem, but the water pipe made a loud noise the first night, and it felt like I was using water. Fortunately, it was gone for a few days.

The only amazing thing is that the original bag comes with nut chocolate cookies! One piece per person. Maybe the hotel is too old, and all the facilities are too old. The elevator lobby, elevator, and all the facilities in the room have traces of time, so don't expect it. Because some rooms are smoking rooms, be prepared to smell of smoke. There is a smell of smoke in the corridor on the floor, but fortunately there is no smell of smoke in the non-smoking room. The bathrobes and bath towels are old and have no smell, and the bathroom floor is slippery, so you must wear slippers. The carpet in the room is stained, and the desk and desk chair have long hair and food residue from other guests. The window sill sofa also has the same problem, I only dare to use it after cleaning it once. Insufficient lighting and air conditioning in the room.

After the takeaway arrived at the hotel, it was not delivered to the room 20 minutes later (and the deliveryman took a photo of the robot and the goods). I called three times, and the first reply will be answered later, etc. I didn't reply for a long time, so I had no choice but to ask again. I didn't tell you to arrange delivery until I got 3 calls. The service of a star hotel is not as efficient as that of an express hotel, and this hotel will not be preferred again in the future.

msg:The hotel itself is suitable for this tourist season in terms of price and location, and the breakfast is also very good. But there are two points to criticize: 1) When checking in at the front desk, because the two young children did not bring their IDs at first, the front desk reception manager - a middle-aged lady - had an extremely arrogant and bad attitude. Use extremely offensive body movements and tone of voice to express no in front of children. This behavior was unprofessional and very uncomfortable. Totally inconsistent with the management level of an international hotel chain. We understand that check-in requires certain procedures, but can't we talk about the same content? This lady clearly "pressured" all other front desk staff. Being bully at this level turns out to be the "quality" that leads to promotion at Hilton Beijing. hehe. 2) The room facilities are still old and the space is crowded. All in all, I will definitely not stay here again next time I go to the Imperial Capital.

Afternoon tea, Chinese New Year beauty online, is booming, and the staff kindly gave an extra glass of milkshake. Afternoon tea suggests that the taste can be richer, and it is currently a bit too sweet. In addition, I accidentally found my lost mobile phone at the front desk.

2. When I went to the swimming pool to swim, I asked the two male waiters next to me to borrow a child's floating board. They said it was brought by the guests. I was convinced. There was a small room next to the swimming pool that obviously had a lot of it, but I didn't want to borrow it. Some guests left. I didn’t say I had it when I put it back. Can I get one for you? Where are you watching? What are you looking at? Does it look good?

It is not as old as the reviews say. It feels better than ordinary hotels. It has hand sanitizer and body lotion to wash your hair. Water, conditioner, body wash are all in large bottles, not the small ones in the introduction. I sent welcome cookies for my birthday and a bottle of red wine. I borrowed a pair of scissors. Now it’s a robot to help deliver things. The phone in the house is a bit old and I even I don’t know how to use it haha. One disadvantage is that the sound insulation is not very good. I can hear the sound of the next door. Overall, I am quite satisfied.

harm
1. The air conditioner in some rooms is not working well, the room temperature is 29 degrees, change the room decisively
2. A centipede crawled out of the toilet in the second room. The sound insulation is so poor that you can hear the breathing next door, not to mention snoring. If you can accept the sound of strangers breathing at night, you will be fine. Anyway, I'm changing rooms
Generally speaking, it cost 1099 a night for a room. If I could go back in time, I would not stay if the hotel paid me 1099. The service staff is okay, but the facilities are pure xx😅

msg:This is the hotel closest to my house. Every weekend I take my granddaughter to swim in different hotels. I never chose to stay in this hotel because I read too many complaints about the hotel on the Internet. I really don't want to go to the Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton and other hotels more than ten kilometers away, so I chose the nearest hotel. But this stay made me fall in love with the store. Of course, it's not the hardware of the hotel, but the kind, warm, kind and lovely staff.
Due to the epidemic, it took a little longer than before to check in. During the process, the employee Irene (the name may be wrong 😭) kept saying sorry to me, causing me trouble, etc., soothing my emotions. Another employee, Amanda, saw that my granddaughter was impatient, and immediately delivered the cookies that had just been baked in the hotel and coaxed the little baby affectionately. The child's attention was immediately diverted and she happily ate the cookies. While entering various information, the two employees introduced in detail the various welfare places in the executive room on the specific floors of the hotel, and the check-in was very smooth. The enthusiasm, patience, meticulousness and efficiency of the two staff left a very good impression on me, and I felt very good about the hotel.
The executive lounge is the place where I stay a lot. Although the types of afternoon tea and evening snacks provided are not comparable to other hotels, the polite and professional staff make people feel very comfortable. Seeing that my granddaughter couldn't eat the oranges, I took the initiative to help her bring the oranges to the kitchen and ask the chef to cut them. I really didn't expect a young man to have a very delicate heart, and it's a pity that I couldn't remember his name.
The breakfast is indeed as commented by netizens. There are not many varieties, not even cheese, and it is more Chinese. Also, I like the staff here. Everyone from the leader to the waiter was full of bright smiles, and they were in a much better mood when they saw that. Since I just bought the hotel's promotional package, there are a lot of benefits and how to use it I don't know. The manager of the restaurant happened to be on the scene and immediately pulled him and asked him to explain it to me. William Wu was really patient, and he gave me detailed instructions one by one. I was worried that I would forget it when I used it in the future. He took the initiative to add me on WeChat and told me that if you have any questions during use, you can contact him at any time. So sweet, like family, I really appreciate it.
The employees have a strong sense of service. When we need help, they will be there and solve the problem in time. This kind of ability to serve the invisible is really admirable. It was because of the hard work of the staff that my family and I had a great weekend. Thanks again! Looking forward to seeing you again next weekend.

At the same time, I was recommended to download the hotel app. If there is a follow-up check-in plan, it will be more favorable than Ctrip . The hope for a delay when checking out was also understood and coordinated by the receptionist at the front desk. Due to the large number of people queuing up, the procedures are user-friendly, efficient and convenient. The coat left at the hotel is also neatly packed in a clean bag

I don't know why bottled water should be placed in the bathroom. Is it bad to put it in the house? It's not suitable for the drink at the entrance to be next to the toilet. The refrigerator in the house is empty and there is nothing, and the refrigerator is very old.
In the morning, I wore new clothes and went downstairs to the restaurant for breakfast. When I came back, I smelled of oil smoke. In short, I haven't stayed in such a bad hotel for a long time.

What surprised and satisfied me the most was Zoe, the lady at the front desk who was generous and kind. She was gentle, kind, considerate and warm-hearted. She always cared about the guests and made people feel at home! Very responsible, special details, I still remember when I first arrived at the front desk, the epidemic prevention requirements required registration of a lot of software, she will help you to get it bit by bit, you don't have to worry about it at all, elegant and decent, beautiful temperament!

My suggestion is that the maintenance service of the swimming pool is a bit poor, the locker room is overall bad, the facilities are outdated and dirty, towels and slippers are scattered everywhere, and a permanent cleaning should be set up to clean up in time. Overall, it was a good stay experience, and I will choose Hilton when I have the opportunity.

It took more than 20 minutes, and it took nearly 20 minutes when I came back after cleaning. What is this for?

The afternoon tea in the hotel is amazing, especially thanks to Alex Lou, the handsome guy in the executive lounge. Seeing that there are three of us, not only did he warmly make coffee for us, but he also helped us arrange breakfast for three, which is considerate😊

msg:This is probably the worst DoubleTree by Hilton I have ever stayed in. First of all, there is no parking lot in such a big hotel, parking can only be parked in the paid parking lot. Of course, this is part of the reason for me, I did not ask in advance. Secondly, the facilities in the room are really disappointing. The room I lived in didn't even have the most basic sofa, and there was no place to sit and eat when I ordered a takeout. The phone in the room is also unavailable, and you have to make an outside call to contact the service desk. The coffee provided in the room turned out to be overdue. Although the tea bag has not expired, it has been stored for at least two years. Third, the service aspect is also average, because I took a shower and ordered the takeaway to ask the concierge to arrange for the robot to be delivered to the room. However, I waited for a long time and did not wait for the robot. I went down to see that the takeaway was still at the door. There was no robot. At least let us know that we can pick it up, the food is cold. Fourth, the hotel management is also very lax. The guests in the rooms next to the non-smoking floors can smell cigarettes throughout the corridor and no one will take care of it. All in all, it was my worst DoubleTree by Hilton experience!

In particular, I want to say that the swimming pool here is the only sunny glass swimming pool in all the hotels I have seen. It is next to the sky garden with the gym, and it feels much more comfortable than those placed in the ba*****t! It is really the best choice for traveling 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

The hotel’s swimming pool is clean, and the swimming laps help cheer up.

Not to mention, the customer was asked to pay at the checkout. After we found out, we communicated many times and refused to admit it. If it is not for repeated reconciliations, I really don’t know that the customer has also paid the room rate again. What is wrong with overcharging once and overcharging twice? Will we not return it if we don't reconcile it? This is the first time I encountered this kind of thing, it was too bad

Then the smiling lady Elsa also checked me in very warmly and gave me cookies warmly, which made me bad There was a touch of warmth at night~ I felt much better! Because I was a little scared to live with a twin bed, my lady upgraded me to a double bed! The sanitation in the room is exceptionally good, although it is the farthest room, it is very quiet! Breakfast is delicious and hearty, and the breakfast time is half an hour later than other hotels! Very sweet! Next time I quarrel and run away from home, I will choose DoubleTree by Hilton Beijing! Will also find Elsa little beauty to check in for me~ oh right! The only flaw is that it is a bit cold in the middle of the night, and the phone in the room will not be unable to reach the front desk or send me a quilt in the guest room! Then the meals delivered in the room are a little bit small~ the others are very satisfied! The parking fee is quite expensive, it cost me 97 per night

This time I don’t know why, but gave me a low floor. First of all, the room has poor lighting, the shower head is leaking, the faucet is rusty, and the overall feeling is not "Hilton Hotel" grade. It is completely "unqualified". The breakfast is on the first floor. For dining, many people ate together because of the summer vacation, but the hotel is understaffed, and there is no time to organize the plates on many tables. Groups of guests come to dine, and the open kitchen smells very heavy! After a breakfast, there is a smell of oily smoke on my body, and I have to go back to my room to change clothes before going to the company for a meeting. This accommodation experience should be one of the worst experiences I have stayed in so many "Hilton Hotels"! #Not very recommended

設施：下水口反味嚴重，不論是洗手池下水口，還是浴盆下水口，均反味，十分惡臭，要用水蓋住才可以。
衞生：室內灰塵較大，是絨毛狀漂浮灰塵，不確定是地毯還是其他物品飄落。
環境：每天都在裝修，沖擊鑽聲不絕於耳，不分上下午，有視頻為證，想午休根本不可能！隔音差，隔壁客人咳嗽到凌晨兩點，聲音就像在你頭上咳嗽一樣，睡眠不好的朋友注意了。
服務：6部電梯在16日下午同時停電，客人無法下樓，被告知在房間等消息，感到失望，早餐炒飯米粒兒已風乾，很硬，牙口不好的慎選。

當天晚上臨時決定入住的，到了前台後辦理的人非常多，但前台以及服務員都非常效率
以前住的一些5星酒店，大部分服務都非常冷漠，但當天印象最深的就是一位叫candy的美女妹妹，很熱情，還給了一份零食，服務非常好，臨走還詢問了有什麼不足之處，也對逸林希爾頓能有這樣的服務員好感度大大加分

msg:房間小得出乎我的想象，當然這種老牌酒店可能也不能要求過多，樓下有商場，離7號線地鐵口也不遠，能一線直達北京環球影視度假區也算亮點了吧。另外辦理的預授權根本沒有在離店後主動給我取消，還是等過幾天后、一直沒有收到銀行推送訊息，我主動致電過去詢問才給辦理取消的，感覺有點不可思議。

msg:四個字總結：千萬別來
三星的設施，收五星的價格

最氣人：酒店停車居然要收費，酒店和停車場屬於同一個業主，想錢無可厚非，但是吃相太難看。

最無法忍受：三星的設施，十多年的酒店，走在客房樓層走廊灰塵/污垢/年久失清理的味道，想想要嘔吐。客房傢俱玻璃茶几污垢很多，客房裡都是煙味，還美其名曰非吸煙房。客房燈具有問題。

管理很差：我住的樓層正好有電梯維保人員在做維保，維保單位員工在玩手機，也不見酒店員工現場過來看着。管窺一豹，其他管理也不怎麼樣。

酒店業主想錢想瘋了，但是這種行為無法持續賺錢，希望考慮一下如何提升自身品質和運營水準。別掛着希爾頓的牌幹漢庭都不如的品質。

反正我不會再來，倒貼錢也不來。

衞生：整體還算是乾淨的，畢竟是酒店，和家是不能比的，至少整體沒有看到頭髮之類的

服務：整體服務還是令人滿意的，比如不願意去3樓吃早餐，也幫我解決了，想要多一床被子，在被子緊張的情況下也幫我調劑了。

以上整體入住感受是非常高興的，在此期間非常感謝lami給我的幫助，服務各方面都很到位。

房間乾淨整潔，但是隔音一般，一定不要距離電梯間較近的房間入住，早上小孩子叫大人的説話屋子裡麪都能聽見，尾號25的房間避雷。
另外就是上下水聲音很大，上樓層用水下面房間能聽見，這個酒店應該想辦法整改一下，不利於休息。

值得稱讚的是前台接待服務，反饋問題，及時響應，也很有耐心。

1.衞生間多餘擋板，沐浴液洗髮露等瓶子已經被掛在牆上，還有個擋板被被鑲在淋浴間裏，本來空間都很小了，洗完澡後，被磕碰了頭。
2.打掃衞生人員，無緣無故把我房間冷氣開了一天，回房間後，凍**。
3.我是在攜程預訂的連續入住四天，因為行程原因需提前趕回，提前一天退房，結果被攜程和酒店均告知，不退還最後一天房費。簡直霸王行為，欺負客人。

環境：一般，特意要求了安靜房間，酒店也答應了，結果給安排在電梯旁邊，沒有一家不路過的，非常吵鬧
服務：非常差，缺少基本培訓。8個人杵在前台接待，就開3個枱子，8個人裏有一半的人幹站着。在攜程預訂了房型，辦入住告訴我沒房了，明明前一天還打電話確認過，然後前台告訴説給我升級房型，我説就要原來我預訂的房型，結果前台告訴説就是樓層不一樣，房型一樣。這種回答明顯沒有經過任何培訓，也沒有達到安撫客人的目的。
設施：比較老舊，都給我“升級”行政套房了，感覺像其他酒店的高級房，裝飾等沒有任何心意，且沒有MINI吧，和酒店品牌及價位明顯不符，很糟糕。

應該這輩子不出意外不會再入住了....

酒店設施陳舊，具體表現為
1.房間隔音效果較差，能夠清晰聽到隔壁談話聲音；隔壁在敲牆壁，能夠感受到牆板振動
2.馬桶抽水按鈕不能用，換了一間還是一樣
3.房門鏈條鎖是壞的

疫情一過後，酒店的從設施到前台服務員無一都是不合格的
入住時，前台小姑娘有説有笑，完全不在工作狀態，問wifi情況（依稀記得是免費的），直接回答我，不是會員不免費，comeon 你們是全國第一家逸林希爾頓，榜樣拿出來好不?
洗澡的時候廁所下水口水都噗出來，還好工程師及時維修，否則真是無語
睡覺💤壓根睡不好，空調出風一股味道，打了一晚上噴嚏
作為五星級酒店，實在屬於自己砸掉自己的招牌
當然最值得表揚的是打掃的小姑娘，服務熱情並且還送來一大桶水，真的很nice
