I stayed at the family special room for 3 nights that includes free indoor playground and Kerry club membership during the stay which you can enjoy snack throuout the day and small dinner buffet with complimentary alcohol beverages. They also offered good breakfast spread which was not the best but enjoyable. Indoor playground was spacious and contains many types of long slides that my little one rided more than 10 times. Overall they are the best hotel in Shanghai with good location, nice view. This is especially good if you have a plan with your children.

The room service menu should be updated to include food from the restaurants that are on the first floor of the hotel. Besides all that, service was great, the gym is oh so well-equipped, and the location is awesome.

msg:We actually booked two rooms for 2&3 nights each. This is based on one of the rooms. 

Location- depends what’s on your schedule. If Disney is a must then I think it’s perfect. Lots a families here with kids seemed to be going to Disney. But if you’d also like to do shopping and walk around the city, it’s pretty far even with the subway station nearby. The Kerry Parkside doesn’t have many shops. And we made a mistake as we need to travel back and forth between the hotel and Hong Qiao Station and even the taxi ride was more then an hour each way. 

Service: the check in wasn’t that pleasant. I came in with a toddler on my arms and a luggage but no one offered help with the luggage. The staff did checked me in earlier around 12:40 which is helpful. But then when I asked another staff which way was the rooms she answered me “go straight” without even lifting her head up ( I suppose she was busy with something else on her desk?!) not a big deal but quite surprising cold though. 
The service centre staff on the call were all super responsive and accommodating. I asked for a change of bed sheets and amenities for my child and they sent up staff immediately. The cleaning ladies were also very friendly and my toddler even wanted to play with them. 

Room - to my surprise the room was quite old and very damp. Even the sheets felt damp too. We called the service centre and asked for a change of sheets and a dehumidifier. They sent up everything immediately. The water tank of the dehumidifier was full every 3~4 hours. 
We didn’t book executive rooms so there was no coffee machine in the room just to be aware of. But the mini bar was free so you can get a little snack and drinks. 
There isn’t anything for kids in the regular rooms even when we booked with a kid on the guest list. But you can call and ask. They brought up kids amenities up as per requested. 
  
Overall, I think most of the staff here are friendly and helpful. Location is average. Regular rooms ( can’t judge the executive rooms as we didn’t stay in one of those) definitely need to be upgraded especially the humidity situation. And coffee machine should be provided in all rooms.

We could have spent an entire day utilizing the gym and the pool if we had time. Then there is the breakfast in the morning. One of the best breakfast in town! The options are endless and the quality is very good. Loved our stay, wished we could have stayed longer. Will be back again very soon.

It’s next to a mall with great restaurants and shopping. Second, the spa was my absolute FAVORITE part.  Lily and Hanson provided an excellent experience for a birthday celebration.  I was a bit disappointed that the pool was overrun by swimming classes, but there was a great hot tub that I spent a lot of time in.  Unfortunately, no one seemed to know how to make the bubbles work. I asked several staff members. Still it was lovely and relaxing.  The bed and bathroom were clean and comfortable with the best pillows. Breakfast was fabulous. Just perfect.  The staff was overly friendly and accommodating.  We just moved to this district and were looking for overnight get always and this may be my new favorite place.

But for tourists, it is about 25mins subway ride to the Bund area. The subway is below the hotel which makes it accessible to go places. Plenty of restaurants in the area. We had a pleasant stay.

We booked a double room fore the Friday night and were upgraded for the duration. The room was lovely with a good view. Really tasty pale ales that were made in the micorbrewery downstairs were included. The service was exceptional in the club room. The nearby century park is lovely and well worth exploring. All in all highly recommended.

msg:I rarely write bad reviews, but I really want to express my inner thoughts! I took my children to play in Disney, searched for parent-child hotels, and chose them only when I saw that they were on the list of parent-child hotels! But it is really not a parent-child hotel, not at all! 
First of all, in terms of service, I went to the front desk to check in, and the experience was super bad! A female staff member at the front desk was extremely impatient. When I just entered, she asked me for my ID. I was holding my child and didn’t hear clearly! She shouted at me three times louder! I saw that there was a parent-child custody service on the platform, so I asked: Is there a parent-child custody service... She replied to me: I have never heard of a custody service! To sum up the service in one sentence: It can make you tired for a day and feel a lot of frustration! 
In addition to having a children's playground, this hotel is outsourced as a kindergarten class. In terms of other room facilities and check-in experience, it is not a parent-child hotel at all. 
The room facilities are relatively old and incomplete. There were no slippers and bathrobes when I checked in. I really wonder how it was rated five stars!

The room cleaning is slow, and it takes a phone call every day. There are many types of breakfast, but there is no characteristics, the furnishings are repeated, and the juice is not freshly squeezed. There is food, but I don’t know what to take. There are many repetitive places. The waiter’s service is not very proactive. Unless you shout, they will turn a blind eye to collecting the dishes. The breakfast area is large, but there is no guide service, it is very messy.

Then I ordered a set meal for two adults and one child. I had one adult and one child. I asked if the adult buffet could be converted to something else? After all, the buffet is quite expensive. The answer was no! I was already very unhappy waiting, and there was no compromise at all.
Facilities: Old but clean.
Playground: It is considered large in the hotel's playground, suitable for kindergarten and elementary school children.
Swimming pool, gym: They are all quite large, which is satisfactory. There is also an outdoor sports field. Things are handled on the fourth floor, but no one said it. I went to the fifth floor several times, then went down to handle it and went up again. It was a hassle! This service needs to be improved.
Buffet breakfast: There are still a lot of things, but my baby and I have small appetites. The buffet for 2 adults and 1 child can only eat a small amount at most.
There are problems, but I still recommend it to my friends. After all, you can take your baby out without leaving the hotel.

msg:Two parent-child rooms for three nights, four large and three small, overall OK, five-star praise!
1. The parent-child room is the highlight. The room is very clean and relatively soundproofed. The parent-child room has tents (equivalent to children's beds), dolls, T-shirts, jigsaw puzzles, little yellow ducks, as well as children's toiletries, and the bed feet are very attentive to anti-collision. Breakfast is free for children under 6 years old, and older children are also OK. Parent-child It should be considered a good hotel, thumbs up!
2. Free minibar + swimming fitness in the first round. It will be replenished on Mondays and Thursdays. There will be beer, juice, biscuits, etc., but no fruit. The swimming pool is 20 meters long and there are two paddling pools. Children should like it very much. The water temperature is OK. There are many children learning to swim. I went for a swim in the afternoon. , I feel that the water quality is average; you have to bring your own bath towels and slippers, the passage to the locker room and swimming pool is very cold; the gym is large, which is relatively good.
3. The food is acceptable. You can go for group buying at the self-service on the first floor, which costs less than 300 for adults, and half price for children over 6 years old. The boss is very generous, and children just over 6 years old are free of charge! So that’s also a plus. To be honest, the food is quite average, definitely not a five-star restaurant, but at this price, it's still okay. The crab is really cute, the steak must be cooked well, and the red wine is really good.
4. The children's center slide is indeed very interesting. Children like it very much. One free place is provided for each room. It costs 200 per person at one's own expense, valid for two days. Friends with large tonnage should be careful to slow down when taking children to play on the slide, as the inertia is large. In terms of time, it is usually at night. By 7 o'clock, it is probably open separately, which is different from other family hotels.
5. There is a Disney shuttle bus. We chose to leave at 10:30, mainly because there are many people on Valentine's Day, and there will be queues if we go early. In addition, the children can't get up, so we will return at 10 p.m. I didn’t buy an early access card and played a total of 9 projects. I must rent a stroller! Try not to bring your own. If it doesn’t meet the park’s requirements, the money you deposit will be enough to rent a car!
6. The geographical location is superior and the surrounding environment is very good! I looked at more than 10 five-star hotels before and finally chose this one. Considering that it is very convenient to go to Disney's Bund, there are subways and shopping malls downstairs of the hotel. The nearby Century Park has a beautiful environment and must be visited.
7. Finally, I want to talk about the service, which is also commendable. I gave him 2 band-aids in a row. Thank you very much! It's a pity that I didn't remember the handsome guy's name; I asked for a few bottles of water in advance when I went out, and they were delivered quickly, and the service response was timely; the front desk, concierge, and car were very attentive. If you have to be picky, there should be room for improvement compared to other five-star hotels in terms of bringing guests to the room, smiling service, etc.
In short, it was a good Spring Festival trip to Shanghai. It was an unforgettable and wonderful trip. The whole family was very satisfied. Thank you very much to Ctrip and the hotel!

msg:As a Shangri-La hotel, the service attitude is very good. I have to mention a few details. The facilities are indeed old. I saw that the table corners and bed legs were a bit broken. There are two door cards, but one of them always cannot be opened. There are no family hotels, Lantern Festival, or children’s activities. When I bought the hotel package, I asked and the front desk informed me. In other five-star hotels, I informed them proactively. Other services are still good.

msg:Compared to the Por**an where I stayed a few days ago, the Kerry Hotel really disappointed me. The management of Shangri-La is far inferior to that of Marriott. The staff's service was not very positive. I called three times to ask for pillows before they were delivered to me. The goods were not exactly what they were supposed to be. What was delivered was bottled water and slippers. I don't know which link is the problem. The restaurant downstairs was also not very positive at closing, perhaps because of the lack of manpower during the New Year. But there is a Hong Kong sentence with many advantages. The staff at Kerry Court have good service, are enthusiastic and attentive. The room we stayed in was spacious, and there was a TV in the bathroom (although we turned it on). There are also many types of hotel meals, and the choices are very rich. We hope to strengthen management and train more outstanding employees to add luster to the hotel.

msg:The room is quite bright~ Snacks are provided~ There are also drinks (can be replenished once), water and slippers are provided by the service. The service is very fast~ I like the service
During the holidays, I took my children to the window and temporarily renovated it into a small one for the children⛺️. The previous small round table was moved to the corner~ It was a good intention~ But the child played here twice and bumped into the side of the bar table and the bedside table next to it. The corner of the bedside cabinet over there is a bit dangerous~ (The hotel didn’t consider it well when decorating it)
There is no trash can next to the toilet in the bathroom. I have written so many hotels. Is this really for environmental protection? Sanitary napkins, toilet napkins, etc. cannot be thrown away🚽) Although there is a trash can under the sink, it is still inconvenient... Also, the tissue box on the bedside table is made of ceramic glass and is very heavy, and the top of the bedside table is already made of glass, I think. There will be dangers, especially with children. If you are naughty and curious, take it and touch it. If you don't hold it, it will be easily smashed. Although adults have to watch the children, I think this can be improved to avoid it. The overall design and layout of the bathroom is very reasonable. Shower The place is very spacious and it's not cold when taking a shower. But if you put a non-slip towel under the glass door, the door won't open properly.

msg:During the Spring Festival holiday, I originally wanted to take my kids to a family hotel around Shanghai, but after searching for a long time, I found that if the family hotel with an indoor amusement park does not have water sports, it is better to go to Shanghai. I got the Kerry Pavilion double room parent-child package and it felt really good to experience it ~

Facilities: To be honest, they are not very new and do not have many high-tech and intelligent equipment, but they still maintain the standards that a five-star hotel should have! I especially like the small TV in the bathroom. You can watch TV while taking a bath!

Hygiene: It's very clean. Whether it's the rooms, restaurants, parent-child playground, etc., you can rest assured.

Environment: Kerry Hotel is located in the Kerry City shopping mall, which is very convenient. Diagonally opposite is Century Park, which is also a good place for walking kids. It’s great! On the 4th floor of the hotel is its own 700-square-meter children's playground, which is a great place for parents to free their hands. There are three slides that are very fun! Going up and down the climbing frame can really let the baby discharge his energy! There are also a few slides and swings outside the hotel, and you can play for a while~ The room I was given this time can see the three-piece suit opposite, which is great value!

Service: This time I stayed on the Kerry Pavilion executive floor, which included K20 parent-child courses and I was very happy to do handicrafts. There were also afternoon tea, happy hour light meals, and buffet breakfast all on the third floor. There were not many seats, but The staff will actively help you coordinate table sharing, add baby chairs, etc., which is very good~ Those with children can also help us add an extra cot for free, and also provide children's toiletries. We went out to have dinner. At the stall, I found that my aunt had helped us clean up the house, cleaned the trash cans, and put in a few bottles of water. It felt very warm~

Service: Answer all questions and treat others with a smile. Personally speaking, there are some shortcomings. First of all, the bed is too high and the mattress is too soft. I am not used to sleeping. There is nothing in the parent-child room except a small triangular tent and a jigsaw puzzle toy. , the reference price room is too small, not as affordable as Suzhou, the happy hour is a bit high-end, we prefer the buffet and cannot change,

The decoration is a bit old, and the air conditioner in the room cannot be controlled independently. Even if it is adjusted to 18 degrees, it is still very hot. This is not a good thing, but fortunately, the heater will not come out the next day. I don’t know if it is. There are more customers giving feedback. The Horizon Club has a good environment and a lot of people. The breakfast is not as rich as the one on the first floor, and the evening ends earlier.

msg:Kerry Hotel Pudong is called our home hotel by my two granddaughters because it not only has a super large amusement park suitable for all ages, as well as green pools and paddling pools suitable for children, but also the staff at this hotel are proactive and family-like. Care and concern, more careful and considerate care and service.
        I can't wait to share my inner gratitude and gratitude every time I stay. There were many guests in the hotel on New Year's Eve, and many guests asked for late check-out. The young girl Hu Shijia at the front desk took the initiative to invite us to go to the executive lounge to have tea and snacks to rest. Although the time was only twelve o'clock, it was not the required time. At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, they also accommodated my request to go to the swimming pool before getting the room card. Before I went to the front desk to get the room card, my luggage had been delivered to the room for me.
        The aunt who cleaned the room took the initiative to ask us what we needed, and when she left, she reminded us not to forget anything and leave it in the room.
        My granddaughter accidentally scratched the plate. The waiter didn't blame her, but carefully cleaned her up on the spot.
        This time, the hotel saw that we had stayed many times this year and did not meet our request for two rooms on the same floor. It took the initiative to upgrade to a large double room in Kerry Pavilion, which meant that the hotel had to bear an extra 500 yuan in room charges. This room is more than 20 square meters larger than the original 48 square meters, and it is a room with a view of Century Park. As soon as I entered the door, I recorded the panoramic view of the room (see screenshot).
        The hotel's hygiene and environment are excellent. It is connected to Kerry City Shopping Mall. From Huamu Station at the end of Metro Line 7, you can go directly to the hotel lobby via Kerry City.

The room is very warmly decorated and the children like it very much. Especially the gifts prepared for the children are very happy. The first round of consumption in the wine cabinet is free, and there are some snacks that I forgot to take pictures.
The breakfast was very rich and varied. We had it at ten o'clock, so it was basically two meals in one.
A child was included in the children's adventure park during his stay. This child liked it very much. No wonder it ranked in the top three among family hotels. In fact, I think apart from the location, it is better than the two Disney hotels 😄

I had to arrange one for my mother. Ctrip looked for it for a long time, but the flight time did not allow for it, I couldn’t buy a train ticket, and it was too congested to drive. I originally planned to go to Tonglu. On the Mid-Autumn Festival, I saw that it would take less than four hours to drive there. On the 30th, I saw that it would take almost six hours to drive, so I gave up. After all, I once had the experience of driving for nine hours to reach my destination during the National Day. It was really difficult. Don't want to go through it again.
Finally, I chose the Kerry Hotel in Pudong, Shanghai. The children's park is very attractive. This children's park is open to the public. Not only hotel guests can play, but people outside can also play. It costs 150 yuan per person on weekdays and 200 yuan on holidays. /person, it’s not very expensive either. There were a lot of children playing inside, and they were all sweating profusely. It was so comfortable to sweat profusely! I booked a parent-child room of 1588. When I arrived at the store, I added 408 to upgrade to an executive parent-child room, plus afternoon tea and light meals in the evening. Afternoon tea and light meals are both on the third floor of the hotel. It is a small buffet with not many dishes. It can only be called a light meal, but I can't eat much now, so it is enough for me. The breakfast buffet the next morning was quite good, with many varieties. The little bird's stomach said he couldn't eat it, so just take a look and it's pleasing to the eye.
The swimming pool and children's playground are very good, suitable for taking children on vacation, and even if you don't eat in the hotel, there are many choices in Kerry City.

The surrounding entertainment is also good, and the supporting facilities are relatively mature, making it very convenient for both business and family travel.

I originally planned to make do with it, but I didn't expect that the hotel was very considerate and considerate in upgrading the room type and adding an extra bed for free. I would like to sincerely thank the receptionist William for making me feel the warm service of Shanghai metropolis👍. Although it has been open for a long time, the items are still clean and tidy, and you can still see the Oriental Pearl Tower from the window. The key point is that this family hotel is very cost-effective. Not only can you get to the subway station in three minutes, but you can also go shopping without leaving the hotel. It is very convenient to eat and has many choices. It is very friendly in winter and is the best choice for walking children. I will choose Kerry Hotel next time, 100 likes.

Employees generally speak English 
It was nice that the breakfast was good as well. (Nespresso coffee service was good.)
The room condition was good, so it was always clean and pleasant to use.

But ventilating when you sleep? I don't know if it was the sound, but it was a bit loud and bothered me at times.

It's good to eat at the hotel, and when you're not at the hotel, you can use the passageway to eat at the mall, so you have a wide range of options.

It was a good choice.

msg:The epidemic has not left Shanghai for several years, and Kerry is a frequent visitor in the city. This time, the children wanted to play with their classmates again. It happened to be Halloween and the hotel was decorated very a**ospherically.
We booked a Kerry Pavilion room. There was a handsome guy who checked in on the third floor who was very nice. Knowing that we were two children, he took the initiative to give us an adventure park admission ticket and beer coupons for the Halloween bar event. The minibar in the room is also provided for free. The children went to the paradise to have fun, and the adults drank and chatted in Jiali Pavilion. It was very pleasant.
The room facilities are a bit old: there is no socket on the bedside table; the toilet does not have a slow-down cover, which I am not used to. Several buttons in the children's pool rainforest also didn't work. However, the small flaws will not affect the children's happy weekend^_^.

She also arranged a welcome gift and a birthday cake. The whole service was excellent. They even offered a late check-out when leaving the hotel. A big thumbs up!
The hotel is very nice, very suitable for families and children. The breakfast was very rich, and the children's playground was very fun. You could play there for two days during your stay, and played for a total of six or seven hours. The children said that the wave slide and the devil slide became more and more addictive the more they played.
In addition, the brew in the western restaurant in the hotel is very delicious, and the home-brew beer is also good. The Halloween costumes are so spot on.
By the way, it’s just in time for Halloween. It’s a fun experience to take the kids to beg for candy at the hotel and the Kerry Center next door.

When I checked in, I communicated with Chloe and Nico at the front desk. They were very friendly and gave me tickets for the children's paradise. However, the price difference was not refundable, so it was considered a good deal. Psychologically comforted. The children's paradise is still very attractive to children.

Later, I went back to look for him because the invoice he issued to me was wrong. I happened to hear him telling others to take the car to the courtesy depar**ent. I went to the courtesy depar**ent and he said it was free for members. Even if you don’t have a membership, you can register as a member for free. However, the front desk issued the wrong invoice without apologizing. They didn’t explain clearly to the guests about the car’s underground garage. They also made people wait for so long. There is no apology at all. It’s evil to the core. I will definitely not do it next time. After staying, whichever in-person activities and tickets can be purchased separately, the ones included in the hotel are still a trap.

msg:This is my second time staying at Kerry Hotel. This is the hotel where you can safely walk around, eat and play with your kids in the city.
Although the hotel is old, the sanitation of the rooms and the maintenance of the facilities are very good... The room service response is very fast, and it can be delivered to the room within 5 minutes after making the call. The hotel's lobby and front desk services are all online, so when you need help If you ask any employee, they will take the initiative to help in a friendly manner. They are friendly and not distant... This is why I like Kerry Hotels.
The hotel has its own large indoor playground, which is definitely a great place to walk your kids and discharge their batteries all afternoon.
The swimming pool on the 5th floor of the hotel can also meet different needs. There are regular swimming pools, children's paddling pools, and warm water massage pools... The water is a bit cold in this world. It is very comfortable to take a dip in the warm water pool.
This time I booked a parent-child room, and the children were very happy to have their own small tent to sleep in... The hotel is connected to the Kerry City shopping mall. It is not a problem to eat and hang out. There are also various children's facilities in the mall to walk the baby.

The buffet breakfast is also much richer than other hotels. I would like to thank Miss Yuki for helping us arrange breakfast properly.
2. The gym is super large. It is the largest hotel I have stayed in so far. Not only is the place large, but there are many equipment and courses. There is also a small sauna in the women's locker room.
3. The playground is fun. It is divided into the young age area and the old age area. The place is very large, and there are three exciting slides. Guests staying in the hotel can enter and exit countless times within two days, and the outside is expensive. It seems that there are four to five hundred on weekends. Since we checked in late, thanks to the hotel, Joanna and her three children finally got to play in the children's paradise they dreamed of.
4. Downstairs is the Kerry City Shopping Mall, which is very lively and convenient for eating and shopping.
5. I like their swimming pools the most. There are three of them. The adult standard pool has five lanes, a children's paddling pool and a hot spring pool with relatively high water temperature. The children had a great time.
   The hotel staff, Shan Yufei, was enthusiastic and attentive, making our trip a great experience. If I still want to stay in Kerry if I have the chance, I just like to stay in such a high-end hotel and enjoy the leisurely life.

msg:The experience of staying in Kerry is not too good. The most impressive thing is the speedy elevator. I just said a word to the child and reached the 17th floor in an instant. I was so embarrassed that I stared at each other [cover my face], overlooking the three-piece suite in Shanghai, which is connected to the hotel. The shopping mall, shopping until the legs are weak, the rich breakfast does not need to be described too much, the oranges are really delicious, it is the first time when I come to the gym, I encounter a hotel with coaches in the morning, swimming pool, playground, everything is available, I regret giving it away I didn't have time to enjoy the afternoon tea, the treasure hotel for traveling with children, there is no charge, and I recommend it with conscience [笑笑]

There is a huge children's playground. The children have fun. It is very close to the shopping mall and shopping is very convenient. The Century Park opposite is too hot during the day, so it is also a good choice to go for a walk at night. The hotel's breakfast is also very rich. I would like to praise Kristina at the front desk of Kerry Court for her warm and thoughtful service.

Kerry Hotels has been in contact for nearly ten years, and company annual meetings and school activities are all held here. I have always had a soft spot for Kerry Hotels.
This time I booked a hotel for a friend. When it came to handling electronic invoices, a lady at the front desk had a very bad attitude. Her tone of communication on the phone and WeChat was very poor. It can be said that she was disdainful of the guests. I haven’t written a negative review for many years. I hope See it can be improved!

msg:On the weekend, I took Wa Zhai Hotel and chose the Kerry Hotel, which has a high reputation. The first impression was that the parking problem reduced points. Since Kerry City and Kerry Hotel share the parking garage, the security guards in charge of the traffic do not know which are the hotel guests. , Which are the guests who stop temporarily to play, causing many vehicles to queue up on the road, and some vehicles that jump in the queue are released first, which is extremely dissatisfied.
Environment: Conjoined with Kerry City Shopping Center, there are quite a lot of people who come here to take their children on vacation on weekends. This time, they also bumped into students who participated in the FBLA business competition, and the elevator couldn’t wait for it🤪
Parking: The traffic guidance and command is not good enough, and I hope it can be optimized. It shares the parking garage with Kerry City Shopping Center, and the parking spaces are relatively tight on weekends.
Room: Spacious, bright and a**ospheric, relatively clean, but the toilet has no exhaust.
Breakfast: There are many types, and the taste is quite satisfactory. Personally, I think pot stickers and tofu nao are good~
Children's Paradise: The indoor playground is divided into areas for children of all ages. There is also a free outdoor playground on the first floor of the hotel that is shared with the shopping mall, which is not bad.
Fitness: There are a lot of equipment, and there are few people in hin. It is visually estimated that all the children with children gather in the children's playground to consume energy 😂

There is no toothbrush. You need to bring your own or you can ask them for it. The service is very good. When I checked out, I met a staff member "An Qiuming". Enthusiastic, seeing that I took the small bag, took the card away and checked out for me. Later, I found that my mobile phone was left in the room, and I opened the card to accompany me to look for it. I was very enthusiastic.

Refreshing my understanding of five-star hotels really took me back to 20 years ago. Everything is okay.

If it weren't for the children's playground, I probably wouldn't want to give it to me and I wouldn't stay here again in the future. The front desk is also great.

The bellman will also help to carry the luggage and guide the elevator room in a timely manner. The room is quite satisfactory, after all, the year is also good. There are a few, and I am very happy that the mini bar has enough drinks. In addition, because I am bringing children, the focus is basically on parent-child projects. The place is really big, but there are not so many places for children to play. So can you suggest to give children more space to have fun? Eating is really convenient and tastes really good. The overall breakfast, lunch and evening meals have their own characteristics. I really enjoy eating, really awesome, There are also many places to go shopping around, and when it comes to checking out, because I know that there will be a lot of people checking out during the Chinese New Year, so I checked out at the wrong peak, which is convenient and fast. It is no exaggeration to say that this is the happiest hotel I have stayed in.

I brought breakfast for 2 adults and 2 children, afternoon tea, happy hour, and a children’s playground. The view of the room is facing Century Park. I came to stay at the hotel Most of them bring their children, and so do we. We mainly go to the children's playground and swimming pool in the hotel. In the true sense, parents are liberated. The children have a great time. With the playground and swimming pool, they can play non-stop all day long. It's so fun. , and the hotel is about a five-minute walk from Century Park. The next day, leave the hotel and take the children to go shopping and camp 🏕️ to end the perfect vacation

Since my children are going to stay in the hotel temporarily, I chose this parent-child hotel, booked an executive room, and the front desk I upgraded to an executive suite with the difference in price. The executive lounge on the third floor is crowded with people for dinner at night, but the staff seem to work hard to serve every guest well. I have stayed in many parent-child hotels, but the local Kerry really It's so full of praise, it's the first choice hotel for Shanghai Walker if you don't stay on holidays

For the child's birthday, upgrade the vision room (enjoy the three-piece scenery), and send a 4-inch cake. The children's playground is a bit old, there are not many people, the children are very happy playing on the devil slide and playing ball. The heated swimming pool is awesome, and few people can enjoy it alone~ But I don’t know where to get plastic slippers, and it hurts to death when you step on the non-slip mat with bare feet. Room service is responsive and delivered quickly. Check out was also quick.
Connected with Kerry City, you can go to Kerry City to enjoy delicious food without going out of the hotel to blow the cold wind, which is very convenient.

When the temperature is high, there are actually many choices for family hotels, but in winter, considering that the outdoors is no longer suitable for young children, you can really stock up on this one. What I am most satisfied with is the swimming pool. The children like it very much. The temperature of the three swimming pools is also very user-friendly. There is even a hot water Jacuzzi. After the children have fun, take a dip in the hot water. After a day of playing, I went to the hot pool to soak in the hot pool for a while to relieve my fatigue. The children's paradise is also very exciting, but it needs to be accompanied by an adult, otherwise it is easy to be bumped into by older children. After staying for one night, the Chris**as decorations were changed the next day, and I was happy to take a lot of photos. Will stay again next time

The price/performance ratio can be said to be very high, the price is close to the people, and the parent-child facilities and services are really good. And from the lobby to the room service, the food and beverage taste to the environmental sanitation of each link has indeed given Shangri-La a long face. Whether it is from other places or locals, with or without a baby, you can go to Kerry to enjoy a high-end service at a civilian price. There are two points in this experience. First, the service of the concierge depar**ent has become more sophisticated. It can be said that people can see it at their fingertips. I hope the leaders can reward the service staff of the concierge depar**ent, which is very nice. Second, the front desk of the gym is a little narrower this time.

The swimming pool is also very big, it was really fun to play, I will come again next time

Because of the upgrade to the higher floors, there is only a coffee machine. The bar area is a bit bigger than the lower floors. Others are no different from the 24th floor and below.

It is mainly connected to Kerry City shopping mall, so it is super convenient to eat.

What's worse is that you can't choose one person's breakfast on Ctrip. It's for two people, so if you live alone, you can't choose whether to choose breakfast.

There are several nucleic acid points nearby, which is very convenient.

The gym and swimming pool are definitely the ceiling of the Shanghai hotel, and the children's playground is also very popular with children. Stayed for 2 nights, baby refused to go home, will come again next time.

msg:It’s really inconvenient for the baby to go to the parent-child hotel in Sheshan before school starts. (For the room, I still prefer the parent-child room of Yumao Zhenpin, which is really bright and bright.) Besides, the receptionist lance I met when I checked in at Kerry was really good, and the tone was very gentle and not perfunctory. There is no offensive power, and I am especially considerate to know that I am here for the baby's birthday, and I have upgraded the garden view room. I am worried that the time is too short, so I asked when I checked in whether I could delay the check out. Then Lance happily delayed the check-out and brought a birthday cake (it tasted really good, and it was all eaten up). I have to say that there should be a stool at the front desk. It is very uncomfortable to stand and type. It is very uncomfortable for tall people. Not friendly. Entering the room is still a bit small 😂 The arrangement will be done soon. Should add money to upgrade because of severe entanglement🤣! The cleaning aunt is also very enthusiastic. The quilt in the room was a bit wet and was changed soon. Will there be a special person to confirm what else is needed? The service is very professional. However, when I checked out, I met another lady at the front desk and did not take the initiative to ask the parking lot to go to the concierge next to report the license plate number, so I tossed it for a while. . . I didn't know if it was busy when I went to the front desk again. When I asked, I just pointed it out, it made me think that I disturbed her 😂 But this little episode will not affect our next time we bring the baby to play. After all, in the beginning, the service of lance and the aunt, welcoming guests at the door (he was tall and did not see the famous brand), the overall feeling was very good

It is very humane to stay in the playground for two days, but it is a waste to buy a two-day package. The swimming pool is also quite big, and there are not many people on weekdays. It is a pity that the bathing pool was not open for three days because of the mosaic tiles.

msg:The old-fashioned parent-child hotel stands out among the five-star hotels in Shanghai for its cost-effectiveness because I want to take my baby to swim, but the actual experience of staying in is very general.
First of all, as a five-star hotel in Shangri-La, check-in has been promoting the upgrade of executive rooms, or it is doing things for you while doing your own business, which is very poor experience for guests who have just arrived at the hotel.
Secondly, the entire hotel is currently a parent-child hotel. There is a paid adventure park in the hotel. If this is not consumed, there will be no other paradise for children to play. What is even more speechless is that the park is open from 11:00 am to 7:00 pm on weekdays. At this time, children spend half of the time eating and taking naps, and the time they can play is very limited. The hotel park is not just a picture, he can let the children from morning to night. Are you playing? It should be open at least 9 am.
In the end, the hotel didn't ask me if I wanted children's toiletries when I saw that I was bringing children. There was no furniture in the room that could be used as a footstool for children. It was inconvenient for children to wash their hands and brush their teeth.
The advantage is that the swimming pool is really big. It is divided into a 1.2-meter large swimming pool (although three of the five lanes are for classes), a 0.5-meter children's pool and a 0.9-meter hot pool. The density is comfortable on weekdays. That is, the disinfectant is not too much, the smell is very strong
The room is still very big, the first round of mini bar is free, and it is very comfortable to drink some drinks after swimming

In general, the hotel is cost-effective in the current epidemic situation, but the management is chaotic. Unlike a five-star hotel chain, the standardized process operation is not in place, let alone a home away from home.
This price will be considered in the peak season of winter and summer vacations. If it is not for bringing a baby, I should not recommend this one.

After comparison, I decided to choose an old Internet celebrity. I have to say that the hotel location is super convenient and there are many choices of food. But... I was dumbfounded when I checked into the room. The floor was full of hair, and the furniture was all gray...

The lobby manager at the time of check-in learned that it was a birthday, and was very enthusiastic to help upgrade the view room, and agreed to my request for a late check-out. Also gave a birthday cake (sorry to see the manager's name tag but forgot). It was early to check in, but the room was given to me immediately. Feel so happy! The first round of mini bar is also very sincere. The breakfast is full of variety. The noodle stall is also very sincere, and I ate a big bowl of spicy pork noodles. The swimming pool has a children's heated pool, and the children are willing to come out after soaking for a long time. The 150 yuan admission ticket for the in-house guests of the children's park on Friday (200 yuan on Saturday) can play from Friday to Saturday. This feels very good. The children were in the children's playground on Friday afternoon and Saturday afternoon. The feeling of staying at Kerry Hotel is worthy of being a parent-child hotel for children, and all the details and services are very satisfactory. I will stay again next time I have the opportunity.

Kerry Mall is upstairs from the hotel
The hotel comes with its own children's playground, in-house guests need to pay at their own expense, or the room type package includes tickets, it is recommended to buy a hotel package.
The room has a good view, you can see the Oriental Pearl, the package includes a free minibar, and the room service is also in place. Children's bathrobes and children's shower gel are all appropriate.
The only regret is the twin room type, the bed is too small and only 1.2*2. Now that there are more families with two children, the bed type should be updated.
For meals, you can order takeaways or restaurants in shopping malls. It is super convenient. There is Shanghai Science and Technology Museum nearby, and it takes 10 minutes to drive.
The hotel has a swimming pool with three pools, one with a depth of 1.4 meters, the other with a children's paddling pool of 0.5 meters, and a highly recommended heated spa pool with water column massage and water bubble massage. The gym is very professional, and there are morning exercises in the morning.
The breakfast is rich and varied. By 10:30 in the morning, there are Shanghai specialties, especially the toppings of the pastry stalls are so delicious that I will not get tired of eating them for two mornings.

Overall evaluation: Check-in and check-out are very fast, and it is also very humane for members to extend their stay until 2 pm. Ba*****t parking is free. The overall feeling is very good, except for the restaurant, the hotel should reposition the category of breakfast, there are many tricks, but there are not many delicious ones. The catering in the administrative building is also relatively poor, except for those tea drinks, at least give a decent lunch!

It is recommended to add several varieties of hot dishes. The attitude of the service staff is very good. There is a queue for breakfast, but it is still very fast. There are many choices, and I am very satisfied. The room is spacious with coffee machine, minibar and bathtub, the bed is wide enough and the mattress is comfortable. The only flaw is that there are raisins left by the previous guests on the sofa footstool in the room. The children found it and thought it was a bug. The parking lot of Kerry City is not neat, and every time I feel that it is relatively round, the hotel is in area B, and I drove around there for a long time, so I had to park in area C.

Check-in on Wednesday, because it is mid-week, there are not so many people, you can also check in on the third floor, go directly to Adventure Park on the day of check-in, the parent-child room package includes Adventure Park, you can enter and leave unlimited times, if there is one more child hotel guest 150 , the package is still 🈵️ cost-effective. In addition, it is also the second day of the week to play in the swimming pool. Our family of 7 grandparents accounted for half of the players. The children's pool is reserved, and there is a hot bubble pool, which is comfortable 😌. However, it is best to ask if there is a children's swimming club for training classes, because we saw some children after playing for more than an hour (13:00), led by teachers. We were right on time and they missed it. In addition to breakfast, it is solved in Kerry City next to the hotel. There are many things to eat and many choices, such as Thai food, Western food, French food, Japanese food, Cantonese food, Huaiyang food, Lanzhou ramen, Hi Tea, Tongrayu Xiaolong, Singapore restaurant, and have a good dinner. There are outdoor atriums on the first floor 🈶️ slides🛝 and climbing games, as well as tents, parents can also sit on outdoor camping folding chairs to rest, 🈶️ There are many chairs, enough to sit on, although it is high temperature, the wind here is not long at night The body feels okay, and I haven't been bitten by mosquitoes. The hotel pool is guarded by two lifeguards, with a depth of 120, with floating boards and long sticks. The three-dimensional climbing in the adventure park has a height and a 90-degree slide. My two children, a 10-year-old and a 41-month-old, can play in place. Went to play again on the day we checked out. Breakfast restaurant on the third floor, eat well, can have. There is also a dry skiing next to the swimming pool on the 5th floor of the hotel. People who have never played it can experience it once. In addition, I remind those who go to the hotel in the middle of the week that there will be a wait for a table when eating lunch in Kerry City, because there is a staff from an office building next to it. Before we left, we did a nucleic acid test opposite to the mall star father before going home to prepare for the next journey
Service: The room service auntie is serious. Seeing that we have a lot of people, I have prepared a lot of supplies for us. I didn't need to clean the room. I just need to take away the garbage and change two bath towels, and she helped us from the inside to the outside. In the parent-child room, there is a small lazy sofa, a floor ➕ tent, and a kangaroo 🦘 doll and a child's kangaroo T-shirt, which should be a welcome gift package. 🈶️Refrigerator, there are soda, Coke, Sprite, Indian beer, free drops, and there are small packets of snacks and Snickers in the drawer, and the children are hungry. The gym on the 4th floor is amazing.

The rest of the service staff were mediocre. The hardware is excellent, the gym is super large, the swimming pool has a water gun area for children and a hot spring area for big friends. After swimming, no one stared at me and returned the pool towel, which is very good, and the area is large enough. The breakfast is also very a**ospheric, the fruit is large, the coffee is packaged directly for take-out, there are enough varieties of food, and the taste is basically good. The tea eggs are really carefully cooked, unlike some hotels. The children's playground is suitable for children under the age of ten. In general, the family travel experience is very good, you can not go outdoors at all, and the complex next door meets all the requirements, it is worth coming again!

msg:Thanks to the hotel for giving us the perfect weekend! Under the epidemic, I didn’t dare to go out to Shanghai easily. I visited the hotel and felt that there was no outdoor activity in the suburbs in the hot weather. All the kids needed was a swimming pool + playground + buffet, and then I found out that Kerry is actually a Ctrip Top 10 parent-child hotel. The only downtown hotel in China, and you can also book a parent-child package. Although I took my baby to Kerry Children's Adventure Park a few years ago and attended countless business meetings at the hotel, this time I was full of surprises. In particular, I would like to praise the check-in staff Kevin Gao, who is warm and thoughtful. Seeing that the two babies are tall, they specially arranged room upgrades and extra beds. The details of the package are also repeatedly implemented with colleagues to ensure that everything is properly arranged. I am very, very moved. It is a five-star service experience. The hotel's swimming pool and meals are also maintained at a high standard. The Kerry Center next to it also had a different leisurely experience as a tourist. I ate and went to the bookstore to buy and buy... Later, a friend brought the baby to Shanghai to visit Disney, and some of them chose it as the first choice...

Environment: It feels a little old and the bar countertops are damaged

Facilities: The gym and swimming pool are good and very big. The adventure park is also suitable for older children. The buffet is hard to say.

Service: pretty good, there are snacks in the parent-child room, but it takes a long time for the baby cot to be delivered. It is understandable that there are many people touching it

Generally speaking, it is good to take children to play, and the price/performance ratio is average. The hygiene really needs to be improved! Finally, it is recommended that anti-collision *****s should be attached to the sharp corners of the room, especially in parent-child rooms.

msg:This Kerry Center Hotel in Pudong has been open for many years. Although many of the facilities are a bit outdated, the overall maintenance is OK. The equipped children's amu*****t park and swimming pool are so suitable for short stays on weekends, and it is convenient to buy what to eat and what to eat next to Kerry Center! However, the facilities in the amu*****t park are more suitable for children over three years old. One or two-year-old babies feel that they can't play much, but the swimming pool is very good, but the water is a bit cold.
The little brother Kevin who checked in at the front desk was very considerate. He helped us upgrade the executive floor view room, and we could see the three-piece suite in Pudong. Other check-in requirements were also met as much as possible. In addition, parents with children, please note that the hotel does not provide fences, but there are baby cots, and toothbrushes and toothpaste and other accessories are not provided voluntarily.
The breakfast ended at 10:30, and the peak started at 9:00. We also queued for a while when we went to the door after 9:30. The place to take meals is not large, and it may even feel a little cramped if there are many people, and the dining experience is not very good. You might feel better if you go early with less people.

Before I stayed at the Kerry Hotel for the first time, my baby was too small and I felt that it was not suitable for Kerry's children's paradise. The hotel room is a bit old and quite satisfactory. Only a tatami tent in the parent-child room is a bit perfunctory, but I liked it with a kangaroo doll.
One problem is that the hotel's hygiene is very perfunctory. On the first day of check-in, the quilts and pillows in the two rooms are musty. I don't know if it is the smell of old oil. There are spots and stains on the sheets in one of the rooms. The room service is also very perfunctory, please ask the aunt to change a set, even if it is over, the hygiene and service awareness need to be improved

The beautiful lady at the front desk helped to upgrade the garden view room. It was a pleasant surprise. I can't remember the name at once, hey!
Disadvantages: The hotel facilities are a bit old. After all, it has been open for 10 years. The underground parking lot of the hotel is currently under maintenance. Due to the epidemic, the hotel cannot directly connect to the shopping mall.

msg:It is said to be a parent-child hotel, except for the bonus points for the swimming pool (there are three pools, one of which is a hot pool for children to have fun), and there is no parent-child feeling. . For a two-and-a-half-year-old child, a large number of facilities in the Children's Park cannot be played. I personally think that it is unreasonable to add 200 yuan. For example, it is more reasonable to place simple small slides in the free pick-up area and a large number of facilities and equipment in the fee-paying area; After checking in, I took the toothbrush and toothpaste that was sent to me. Colgate, how do I use it for a 2.5-year-old?

msg:After a year, I chose a parent-child hotel in Shanghai - Kerry Hotel Pudong, and experienced a staycation.
In fact, I have been fond of Kerry Hotel Pudong for a long time, just taking advantage of the inconvenience of leaving Shanghai during this time, I chose a two-day and one-night hotel tour. Our check-in is on the 3rd floor of the hotel, the executive hall, which is also the floor where we have breakfast the next day. Although it is said that we can only check in at 2 o'clock, we arrived at 12:30 and can also check in. We booked a double room. The bed is big, two big and one small are definitely no problem. The bathroom has a shower and a bathtub, and it is also dry and wet. But looking out of the window, it is the International Exhibition Center. If you recommend it, you can pay attention here. We simply packed our luggage and headed straight to this destination, the Internet Celebrity Children's Adventure Park. Since the hotel swimming pool was not open to the public when we went there at the end of June, to go to the children's adventure park, we need to take the elevator to the first floor, then go through the lobby and take another elevator to the fourth floor.
The children's playground is divided into two areas. The outside is suitable for children under 6 years old to play, and the inside is suitable for children and adults to play at the same time. The most distinctive feature of this Internet celebrity children's adventure park is their three major slides. There are long slides that sit on straw mats and are suitable for all children of all ages. This is the only slide where older friends can take children with them. The second one is the blue slide, which is suitable for children over 4 years old. I personally think the height is three stories high. The blue slide has a smooth transition in the middle with an ocean ball at the bottom. The third is the craziest red slide, suitable for children over 7 years old, and the red slide is divided into two different heights. I personally think that one is six-storey high and the other is seven-storey high, and there is no transition in between, people are almost fell vertically. Long-sleeved trousers must be worn on the blue and red slides to prevent scratches. As a friendly reminder, all children and adults who go to the playground to play in the playground should not bring water bottles into the arena. This time, during the play process, a water bottle full of water fell from the top of the slide. Fortunately, no one was hit this time. If it was hit, the injury would be serious. If you need to drink water, there is a place for parents to rest next to the children's playground for children under 6 years old. You can drink water and eat some snacks.
We only tried the straw slide this time, and after playing for two days in a row, the children realized the fun of playing alone. As for me personally, the first time I played the straw slide, it was also very loud. As for the other two slides, we didn't try either this time. Park tickets are valid for 24 hours, which means you can play for two consecutive days. The hotel package we booked this time also includes K20 parent-child activities, and the location of the activities is also in the children's paradise. The content of our activity this time is to paste beans, that is, children choose a pattern, then paste beans of different colors, and finally need to iron. The finished product can be used as coaster. The whole process can exercise children's concentration and patience. It takes about an hour or so.
The package also includes breakfast on the second day. Although there are not many varieties, the environment is good with few people, and the service is also very nice. You can also apply for late check-out. Compared with outdoor activities in hot summer, this kind of indoor air conditioner can also allow children to play independently, freeing parents' hands, and the whole trip is relatively easy. If there is a chance, we will brush again.

As soon as you step on your feet, it will be empty. They sent me two packs of alcohol cotton balls and Bundy, and asked me to disinfect them with alcohol. I didn't even have iodine. God knows how irritating it feels when the alcohol touches the wound! The door lock of the toilet (as shown in Figure 2) fell directly. Fortunately, I found it in time. Otherwise, if this thing fell to the ground and was accidentally stepped on by a child, what is the concept of the whole pointed screw inserted into the sole of the foot? Picture 1 is that the comb fell off after a few times, making people dare not continue to comb it down. After washing the hair, the hair can only be tied up in a mess. The socket in picture 3 is in the toilet area and cannot be used at all. It feels like it was leaking electricity before. Or burn out, etc., the hotel has been kept for the next guests, and I am not afraid of leakage accidents. It is the first time I have lived in so many hotels. Hotels with many hidden dangers, I have also encountered hotels with negligent service due to large passenger flow before, but this is the first hotel with so many hidden dangers. I used to think that staying in a hotel was for enjoyment, but now I feel that I am here to experience living.

The slide park is amazing, the children were a little scared on the first day, and they went crazy the next day. During the Spring Festival, there are many guests, orderly and mutual understanding. Special thanks to the hotel for sending small cakes for children, which are available in every room, to share together.

Regarding the check-in line for an hour, the breakfast was a mess, everyone complained, and there was no improvement in the hotel. Anyway, I came here in a row, and it was like this. There are many people during the New Year, as a parent-child hotel, there are no children's bathrobes, and it is said that they have been borrowed. It's ridiculous, isn't the bathrobe standard? Still borrowing? Why don't you simply say that there is no drinking water in the room, and you've borrowed it. That being said, I will come again next time. 🤪

It didn't take a long time to queue up. Gao Xiangyang at the front desk was very kind. Knowing that we often come, I immediately upgraded to the administrative floor and gave event coupons to the room. Afterwards, we also sent welcome fruits and bone cakes in time. It was too late to participate in all kinds of activities. There were more people and less food than before. It may be the reason for the Spring Festival. In short, there is basically no price increase in the Spring Festival.

I bought the package and brought the park next to it. The children had a great time, especially the slide.
The service was not satisfactory. At first, I called the front desk of the hotel to ask the two children's breakfast and the situation of the park. They told me that the package includes breakfast for children, and the other 4-year-old's breakfast is not charged. When I arrived there, they said that the 7-year-old children's breakfast was charged 150 (after 50% discount). ), 4-year-old children are included in the package for free, which is inconsistent, think about it, and too lazy to say.

The young lady who received me at the time also remembered my request. It’s not a verbal agreement. It’s great, but I forgot the name of the young lady... I’m sorry... After I picked up and entered the room, I might be too anxious to clean up the room. It’s a bit imperfect, but after telephone communication, the hotel takes it seriously. The room manager brought a staff member and the cleaning aunt to apologize separately. Then it was my first time staying in Kerry. I found it very convenient. The main lobby is Pudong Kerry City. Finally, I want to talk about my second favorite. ! breakfast! it's actually very good! There are many kinds of meals, and the noodles are quite delicious. The only drawback is that there is a woman in the breakfast restaurant who feels a little strange for two consecutive days. She just sits and walks around. We take a meal or sit down to eat. She laughed weirdly at us, she also pointed to other guests, and even saw her accusing other guests of eating. It is too scary to encounter this kind of thing in the morning. I hope the hotel will pay attention to this (it may not be the hotel’s problem) , But still quite scary) I will choose this hotel next time if I need it!

Kerry's children's playground is the most high-end among all the hotels I have stayed in, so the ticket price is not cheap. There are some discounts for hotel guests, but it is more cost-effective to buy a package.
Although the room is not big, it has a high floor and a good view. The bed is also comfortable. Every time I have a problem, I call the front desk and it is solved quickly.

The drinks in the small freezer in the room and the small snacks in the mini bar are also very good, and the scenery outside the window is particularly beautiful. There were too many people when staying in the hotel, but arranged for a clown to throw balloons for the children, which alleviated the anxiety of waiting.

msg:If it weren't for not being able to leave Shanghai, I don't think there will be much business in this hotel. Partial location, old setting, poor service. Except for a playground, where the children during the long vacation will have a place to go, I will definitely not settle in. I didn't get my room card until 2 hours after 11 o'clock. The people in line are shown in Figure 4. The room is like a guest house in the 90s, with stains everywhere, and a door on the interior wall, so I don't know where it leads to. The service is even more ignorant. It took 15 minutes for the front desk to record the two entry information. I said can I hurry up, she just stared at me and said let me tell you and let me answer your questions. Oh my god, are you a criminal trial? Different people have different opinions about the ticket price of the amusement park. The telephone front desk said it was 200 on holidays, the reservation depar**ent said it was 100, and it was charged 150 on the spot. Breakfast is included, and let us buy a baby, our baby is four and a half years old. Anyway, I won't go again in the future. There are too many such electricity, and the epidemic will not make money for too long.

There are enough people for dinner, and you can eat enough. There are too many people at breakfast and the place is big enough, as always, there are many varieties.

msg:At first, the evaluation was not good, but I wanted to retreat, but after I went there, I found that the difference between summer vacation and non-summer vacation is quite big.

Living aspect:
We didn’t wait much time for check-in. When we checked in, we said that the room was still being cleaned. We were still cleaning after walking around the mall, so the staff upgraded us to an executive double room. The attitude was very good. Sleeping, negotiated with the staff, but also delayed for half an hour, very humane.

Aspects of play:
On the first day of check-in, we went to the children’s playground to play a circle. We are little babies and there are very few things to play. We climbed the stairs back and forth, and we had a great time playing, unlimited use within 24 hours
We went to the swimming pool in the morning of the second day of check-in. There were not many people. There was a standard swimming pool with foreign teachers taking swimming lessons, a jacuzzi and a children’s paddling pool.

Aspects of eating:
The hotel is connected to Kerry City, where you can eat, drink and play together. There are restaurants of various price points.

Transportation:
The mall is connected to the Huamu Road Station of Line 7. Although it rains for two days on weekends, you can eat, drink and have fun without leaving the hotel. Traveling without looking at the sky is very cool.

We grouped a package of 998, one night in a big bed room➕ swimming pool➕ gym➕ children’s playground, and then ➕ dinner. It took a total of about 1,500, two large and one small, and the price/performance ratio was very high.

msg:The location of Kerry Hotel is very good, with direct subway access, which is very convenient. The breakfast is very rich, I believe lunch and dinner are also very good. I didn't eat lunch or dinner.
The gym at Kerry Hotel is very large, and there are group exercise classes. Its swimming pool is not on the same floor. In other words, if the kids want to swim and I don't swim, I have to watch them by the side. It also has an outdoor sports field, but it was too hot when I went there and I didn't go out.
Its decoration is too old, it was renovated in 2010. There is no charging plug next to the bed, which is a bit weird to me. But its bed is very comfortable.
Its amu*****t facilities are more suitable for children to play. I feel that after I have passed the fourth grade of elementary school, I may be interested in the facilities of the house in general. The slide can be played for 2 days, more than 24 hours. You can also participate in handicraft activities, but the handicrafts are all played by children.

Breakfast is very average, compared to other five-star standards, there are not many fancy styles, no problem with eating!
The room facilities are not very new, rather old version, the sanitary condition is average!
The hotel’s children’s playground facilities are old and not very new, so it’s okay for fun! The special feature is the devil's slide, remember to wear long-sleeved trousers, otherwise you won’t be allowed to play!
The swimming pool didn't feel particularly fun, so it's normal, 2 small swimming pools and one big adult swimming pool! Mind if the child brings a good swimming ring, otherwise there is nothing fun, there are no props for children to play, if you just soak in the water, it's okay!
The hotel staff is very enthusiastic! We upgraded our executive suite to the hotel. The floor itself is relatively low. We also applied for a higher floor, but we waited a long time! It took almost 2 hours to get it done because we went on Saturday! The main station did not change, we still found other responsible talents to move to the top!
Century Park is near the hotel. I personally think that if you live in Shanghai, just play in the hotel is enough. If you are here for tourism, Century Park is still worth a visit! There are too few varieties of afternoon tea in the hotel, it is taken out by others, and it will not be updated again 🆕! Consulting the manager, the manager said to wait, but we waited for about 40 minutes and did not make it, so the afternoon tea set in the administrative building is not recommended! Less variety, slow update!
In general, the evaluation of the hotel: food and environment can only be regarded as four-star standards.
The location is better, Century Park and Kerry City are all here!

There is no basic equipment for the parent-child room such as a step stool for children; and there is no dirty clothes. Lou, there is no place to put the bathrobe and no one cleans it. Only one side of the bed can be plugged in and it is still far away; the TV is not smart and can’t be cast on the screen; the room’s Wi-Fi can’t be connected...There are many small details that are not good. I think this hotel is really ordinary. It is recommended that those who bring the baby do not set up a parent-child room, just a normal room, and save half of the money for the same experience. Guests in the amusement park charge 50 yuan per person, and 100 yuan if they don’t stay in the amusement park. My parent-child room includes the park ticket and saves 50. However, participating in the activities in the park is actually charged separately, but the manual coloring charges 50... But the good thing is that there is a shopping mall next door to the hotel, which is delicious and good for shopping, which makes up for my disappoin**ent in the hotel.

msg:Children in the super large children’s adventure park are reluctant to walk, except for the devil’s slide and dare not slide, why can only one adult accompany the child to enter the playground? Since the venue is large enough, parents should be allowed to enter if the number of people is controlled. The indoor standard swimming pool is cold water, and the hot spring pool is closed in the morning. Downstairs is the Mall MRT, it is not too convenient, three days and two nights are not enough to play! !

However, the children’s playground, gym, and swimming pool are all oversized, and it’s really the first choice to bring a baby. The guest room also includes children’s bathing utensils, and the overall feeling is pretty good.

msg:At 17:40 on the 18th, I went out to work and came back from an errand. There was a traffic jam in the driveway in front of the hotel. All kinds of cars were parked in a mess. I didn’t see anyone coordinating and guiding me. The taxi driver could only put me in the outer lane. There was no concierge at the door. In the cold wind, I carried a lot of luggage through the driveway and entered the hotel lobby. There were only two little boys in the concierge who helped me deliver the things to the room at my request. Asked why there was no doorman at the door to help guests with luggage, the little boy said that the person at the door had already left work. It's the first time I heard that the concierge of Shangri-La Hotel will "get off work"! The last time I stayed at the breakfast was disappointing, and this time it was even more surprising. In order to save money, do you have to discount the service to the guests? In the corner room 01, the size and hygiene of the room are OK, but the plug-in board in the room is poor, and the bed is so high that a short person has to climb up. It is recommended that such a room should be allocated to tall people in the future. The lady in the guest room is very nice. I should have seen that I bought a large bottle of mineral water. When cleaning, I specially filled a few more bottles of water for me. It's very considerate. The room was cleaned very cleanly, and I put a towel on my toiletries. Arranged neatly. I didn’t like the fruit that I sent on the first day, so I didn’t touch it. The next day I changed to a new fruit plate. I liked it.

The children’s playground with the biggest focus has a safety hazard in sliding slides. The whole family slid together once. Both my child's father and I were injured. The speed bump below was a rough and hard thing. I was scratched in two places on my back while wearing my clothes, and my arms were also torn. It’s been four days since the picture is still very painful. The advantage is that the service staff immediately disinfected the bandage for me, and the hotel is located in a more convenient location. The shopping mall is downstairs.

The hotel’s hardware and software facilities are also very good, and downstairs is a comprehensive shopping mall, where you can eat and drink. When we lived in Pudong, we often came here to go shopping. The most important thing is that there is a shuttle bus to Disney. It is so convenient. Coming here is full of memories of fourteen years of life in Shanghai, and it feels very good for us. The most noteworthy thing this time is that I caught up with the Lala Port's Gundam unveiling ceremony, not far from the hotel, I took a taxi for 20 minutes, and I bought a mini Gundam back. I'm so lucky!

プールでたっぷり泳いだり、アドベンチャーランドで走り回ったり、滑り台をすべったり。何時間でも楽しめました。
特に小学生のお子様をお持ちの家族にはおすすめです。朝食美味しかったです。
また機会があれば泊まりに行きたいです。いい滞在になりました、ケリーホテルありがとうございました。

i've just stayed Kerry hotel with my family for new years holiday.
my family: 2adult and 3child(ages 10,8,6)
the second day was my daughter's birthday so staff of Kerry hotel prepared a birthday cake and birthday presents as surprise.present are not only for the child who is birthday today but also for another children.
our children was very happy due to  the surprise.cake tasted good very delicious.we are going to display the present for spring holiday next month.
swimming pools are good.
adventure land also good for children.
breakfast is delicious.
so i highly recommend against family who has child under around 13 years old.
i want to stay again if i have other opportunity.
at this time we made some very beautiful memories.

msg:先説優點：
1、在人滿為患的五一黃金週，這個五星酒店的價格算是很划算了。
2、浴室的設計很好，有一面很大的可以加熱的鏡子24小時長熱，浴室內很乾燥，洗完的內衣晾一晚上就幹了。
3、有12歲以下孩子的可以免費加床。
再説一下缺點：
1、首先説一下前台工作人員，服務態度很好，説話也都很客氣。但遇到問題本着自己怎麼省事怎麼來，完全不想着幫助解決。其實就是多説一句話就能解決的問題，在我詢問後並沒有告知，導致多交了一天的早飯錢大概310元。
2、不知道是不是離地鐵7號線很近，從早到晚房間內都能聽到類似過火車的聲音，幾分鐘一次，睡眠質量不好的人肯定是睡不着的。
3、床旁邊沒有電源充電口，手機充電衹能在寫字枱上，晚上看手機不太方便。
4、酒店的礦泉水入住當天屋裡衹有2瓶，每天需要跟客房服務説，才會多拿一些。 還有就是衞生間不提供一次性牙刷，需要向客房要。房價實惠是一方面，酒店真的是精打細算，要點什麼東西都是一點一點給，一次一次要。
5、早餐是真的不好吃，種類挺多，做的都很粗糙。主食麪條、餛飩、包子、炒米飯沒一個好吃的。水果種類比較豐富，但都難吃出了一定的水準，大部分水果包括橙子，桃，火龍果都很酸，哈密瓜不新鮮不甜，咬着沒有水份，軟軟的。甜品都是那種又幹又硬的，還都是很膩的那種甜。咖啡也不太好喝，沒什麼香味。

整體入住體驗很棒，Cassie小姐姐在入住前就提前聯繫，得知我們有1歲小朋友需要拼床後，又提前幫忙安排。得知我們大概11點到店，也幫忙安排提前入住。入住期間也都各種幫忙，噓寒問暖。酒店雖然年齡較老，設施比較老派，但是服務上面加了很多分！另外小童樂園確實很大，驚呆了那種大。
酒店能直通嘉裏中心，非常方便。

msg:上海寶藏酒店，強推薦！我住酒店一向挑剔，尤其服務方面，每次選酒店都要比較多家看無數評論。這次因為考慮要在浦東而且帶娃，就選了浦東嘉裏大酒店。以前住過幾次的錦江湯臣雖然服務很好但雙床實在太小了。嘉裏最大的驚喜是免費加床！別的酒店加床200起啊，他愣是免費！還給我免費升級了帶迷你bar免費小吃的房型。我都覺得有點不太真實了。那個客房部小姑娘一個人推着一個大床就過去安置了，還給孩子帶了洗漱用品。我着急慌忙找現金想感謝可是可惡的移動付款已經讓我不帶現金了。衹好尷尬的讓人走了。想着第二天看能不能問問客房部對方的名字然後怎麼表示一下謝意，可第二天連滾打爬忙完幾件事就急奔機場了，根本沒來得及，連退房都是把門卡給了門口的禮賓就跑上車了。離開第二天人已到國外才想起走的匆忙把西服落在房間了，打電話過去果然找到，然後安排快遞到老家。感謝🙏。要是客房部能查到4月16號傍晚值班負責加床的小姐姐名字，告訴我好讓我表示謝意哈。

msg:很滿意的一次入住。疫情以來，這是我們家庭第一次真正意義上的出遊，出行的主要目的是帶着孩子去迪斯尼樂園。出行前，看了很多的酒店，最終才選中浦東嘉裏大酒店。結果證明，這次的選擇是英明的。先從地理位置上，離地鐵站很近，不用出建築就能乘坐地鐵，還是首發站——花木路（7號線）。從這裏打車去迪斯尼樂園也不算遠。酒店和嘉裏城也是一體建築，餐飲、超市、購物都很方便。特別推薦“食廬”淮揚菜餐館。從硬件設施來説，我們入住的是行政層，樓層夠高，視野很好。包括兩大一小的早餐自助，房間還提供免費膠囊咖啡、冷飲、果汁等飲料，房間大小也還行，有寫字枱、小吧枱、單人沙發及腳蹬。還贈送了酒店小童樂園的門票一張，可以玩兩天。小朋友很喜歡，總吵着還要去。從服務來説，一下車就有工作人員開車門，幫忙拿行李，辦理完入住工作人員就主動上前詢問是否需要把行李拿到房間，不過我還是習慣自己拿行李。大堂工作人員Cherry很是熱情，對小朋友也很是友好。隨後的幾天，這位小姐姐看到我們都會主動打招呼，詢問是否去了迪斯尼樂園，好玩不好玩等等，看得出是一位很用心的工作人員。在離開的那天，我們在大堂等車，Cherry還送了小朋友可以塗塗畫畫的小手袋，小朋友也是塗得不亦樂乎。還想説説酒店的自助餐，無論是早餐，還是晚餐，種類並不算特別多，但是品質真心不錯，在上海和杭州的幾天行程中，我們吃過好幾次自助餐，也都是200到400這個價格區間的，沒有能超過嘉裏大酒店的，這對於純屬吃貨的我來説，是加分項。

入住辦理很順利，因為有小寶寶，和前台提了延遲退房，前台很爽快給延到了14點，很棒，入住辦理完畢，管家Cherry小姐姐會領着上樓，順便介紹下餐廳以及一些其他設施位置。
房間在28樓，採光風景都很不錯，親子房送的小禮品小寶寶也喜歡。訂的套餐含有小童冒險樂園票，寶寶連着兩天可以隨時進出遊玩，樂園非常乾淨，空間也很大，適合低齡寶寶。另外，泳池有專門的寶寶戲水池，也是放電的不錯選擇。
入住當天的晚餐讓管家小姐姐訂了2樓的the.MEAT扒房，不愧是米其林推薦餐廳，氛圍服務到餐品都水準在線，很驚喜。

酒店對面就是世紀公園，可惜退房那天下雨了，轉而去了旁邊的嘉裏城，這地理位置也是很棒了，適合小月齡遛娃。
兩天寶寶玩的很開心，很值得，也感謝管家Cherry以及從入住到退房的各位親切的服務人員，有機會還會再來。

酒店工作人員Cherry Song很熱情，從入住當天送我們到房間，住宿期間也很積極的提供幫助，給個五星好評👍🏻，建議領導給加🍗呀。
小童探險樂園的設施很好，3歲小朋友和大一點的小朋友（7-12歲）都可以玩得很開心。

泳池水質很好，春節人也不多。

服務響應也還迅速，停車服務也到位。

遊樂場兩條200暢玩也很贊。足夠大，是真正的遊樂場，而不是一個角落。

健身房就更專業了，我不搞，所以衹是能説是看起來。

msg:一般我都是給全滿分評價。但是我們長者小孩，定了三個房間，居然沒有一個是面向世紀公園的，而且全部在電梯口。最過分的是有一間，半夜開始下水反味。房間裏一股尿騷味。年紀大的人半夜不忍心叫我們，生生熬了個夜。酒店第一時間給換了一間房，但是沒有任何補償和賠償措施。服務枱來電話，問我需要什麼補償？這不是應該按照酒店規定提供應有的賠償給客人嗎？

msg:嘉里酒店我們已是第二次入住，原以為會跟第一次入住一樣，會有良好的體驗，誰料辦理入住時，被工牌上寫着Yuki的前台工作人員搞得心情極差，首先是辦理入住時，此前台人員始終未正眼瞧過客人，表情也很冷漠，給人感覺很是高傲，另外由於我訂的是兩間房，來之前已預先致電前台房間儘量安排在一起，並得到前台答覆已備註清楚，但我到店辦理入住時，還是跟這位叫Yuki的前台人員強調兩間房是安排在一起的，別排錯房間，她也沒怎麼迴應我，然後我拿到兩間房的房卡也以為是安排在一塊了，誰想到房間後才發現兩間房完全不在一起，於是我再找到她確認為何沒安排在一起，她跟我説是按照之前接我電話的前台已安排好的房間來操作的，但我把之前已致電你們前台客服並將我的訴求已備註好的情況再次途述了一遍，她居然來一句，這也不是她的問題，那我就覺得好笑了，作為住客來説已經把我該提醒該操作的事都做了，但作為前台，你代表的就是酒店，就算之前不是你接電話做備註的，但你對酒店房間的佈局應該是最清楚才對，在辦理入住的時候我已又提醒了兩次房間要安排在一起，所以如果發現之前接電話的前台把房間排錯了，你也應該有義務幫忙更正，除非你也不瞭解房間佈局情況，但這其實也不是重點，最關鍵的是服務態度太差，當房間排錯，不是第一時間幫忙糾正錯誤，還很傲慢的説不是她的問題，所以此次入住，住房體驗以及其他服務人員都還是不錯的，但未做5星好評全是因為辦理入住時的極差體驗，希望酒店方能加強相關人員的服務培訓，特別是像前台這類代表酒店形象的崗位。

msg:房間很寬敞設施也不錯，這次定的嘉裏閣帶有行政酒廊，餐品比想象得要豐富，晚餐就直接在這裏解決了。
早餐在一樓的自助餐廳，選擇很多。
這次是和朋友們一起帶孩子來的，孩子們在遊樂場放完電、泡完澡後秒睡，還有健身房和泳池，有給小朋友玩耍的池子，孩子們玩得很開心，嚷着下次還要來。
要特別感謝Cherry，早早就聯繫了我，從一進大堂就幫忙安排入住事宜，態度專業，笑容可掬如沐春風。
整體體驗很好，下次還會選擇這裏。

1、第一次入住進房間 房間沒有打掃 亂糟糟 來人升級了套房 換房間
2、房卡每次插五次可能綠燈亮兩次 不斷插卡 試運氣
3、全酒店大堂沒有水 找前台要一杯熱水  説自己去早餐去接一下
4、拖鞋比較簡陋 穿了兩晚上已經壞了 窗簾和燈具老舊 沒有總開關
5、電話聯繫酒店開發票 讓報確認號 説半天 沒查到 ；報姓名 也沒查到 ；轉前台沒人接；再讓報電話 再問你叫什麼😧

msg:上週六帶全家老小住了一晚，體驗不及預期，300塊級別的服務配不上千元以上的房價，對人權的侵犯和不尊重令人無法接受。
首先是check in，並不會主動告知房價中所含內容以及早餐在哪吃，全程靠我們嘴巴問，一問一答，絲毫沒感覺到被服務。
其二是早餐供應，官方是10點半才結束自助早餐供應，實際情況是九點十五到達餐廳，約30%-50%的菜都吃光了，並且明確告知不會再供應，因為已經快結束了，而當時的情況是整個餐廳是坐滿的，九點多應該是週末早飯高峯，但菜品供應卻是快結束的狀態。
最令人無法接受的事情發生在退房。我們定了兩間房，行政房給我爸媽住，我跟先生帶小朋友住親子房，酒店在沒有任何通知和溝通的情況下，直接把長者在九樓的房間鎖掉，並且將我們的私人物品拿出房間放在打掃衞生的車上，清潔阿姨告知説前台告訴她我們已經退房了，但是實際情況是我們並沒有退房，也沒有告知我們要何時退房，長者計劃陪小朋友在樂園玩到十一點然後回房間收拾東西（還有毛巾，內褲，充電器等私人物品）。長者發現房卡打不開房間，在隔壁房找到清潔工，清潔工把放在衞生車上的私人物品歸還，隨後長者到我們26樓的親子房告知此事，我立刻打電話投訴。值班經理的反應倒是很行雲流水的，五分鐘之內回了電話，給我們兩間房都延到了六點退房，並承諾會立刻找到出問題的原因給我們一個解釋。由於要趕回家帶小朋友睡午覺，我們十二點退房的，此時值班經理稱退房訊息搞錯衹因為房型升過級，系統出錯了，還有另外幾個房間也是這種情況。這個理由我是不接受的，這麼大的酒店，系統也不是昨天才新上線的，難道以前沒有房型升級的情況嗎，就算由新員工處理難道沒有培訓嗎。由於趕時間，我們沒有多逗留，經理提出下次我們再來，可以定一個最便宜的房型，然後給我們升級，作為補償。我們不打算再去了，沒必要貪這個便宜再去虐待一次自己。整個入住體驗，小童樂園還不錯，其他的遠遠沒到這個級別的酒店該有的標準。
事情還沒完，我們的房價裏包含了停車費，check out的時候已經到禮賓部做了核銷，説我們直接開車走就行，實際情況是我們在停車場出不去，衹能退回到旁邊一個停車位，再打電話給禮賓部，再操作一次系統，這回成功離開了。
這就是一個號稱上海親子天花板的酒店給我們的第一印象，可能裏面有很多小概率事件，但是酒店的管理疏忽和對消費者的不尊重在我們看來是板上釘釘的，不會再去了。唯一值得安慰的是，小朋友很開心，很喜歡酒店安排的帳篷和小床和袋鼠玩偶，樂園也玩得很開心，看得出樂園的設計和管理是用心了的。以後不會再入住了，考慮直接帶小朋友來樂園玩。

msg:房間 有點小，而且可以時間久了，總有一種奇怪的味道。
酒店遊樂場好玩，有大童小童兩個區域，挺好的，還有室外的，不過室外就是商場對外開放的區域，有點冷。
早餐 品種多，品質也可以，早餐非常棒。
健身房非常大，器械種類也很全。
游泳池有温泉池、小童池、還有正常尺寸的泳池，也是夠玩了。酒店和商場是一體的，所以吃的東西選擇甚多

滿意方面：嘉裏的酒店服務一流，尤其是前台帥哥段書鑫和禮賓部高高的遼寧小夥，在此要感謝他們真誠的關照與幫助，祝二位工作順利、事業美滿。室內小童樂園、五樓室外植物園是驚喜的地方，三歲半的小朋友玩得非常開心。

前台服務太差了，辦理完入住不給房卡，給了房卡是取電卡，發票開錯，東西丟了不告訴客户，聯繫前台的時候前台説找失物招領處，前台不忙幫轉告該部門，還將電話話筒放一邊，素質低下，行為惡劣，客户滿意度在哪裡？

接電話的時候滿嘴英文，很高大尚，跟人家英語國家學習點兒人家的文化吧。

不是很滿意的方面，硬件上酒店設施算比較老的了。另外，最不滿意的是酒店的spa。價格不一致，同時手法真的太普通了。

到酒店前台辦入住時，有5個工作人員，我去到最左邊空着的工作人員那，態度很一般地説他不辦理，讓我去旁邊兩個排隊，排隊時看到其中一個空了，就換到那去辦理，結果我剛換過去，工作人員頭都不抬的對我説他這裏不辦入住了！看我不耐煩了，才有一個看着類似大堂經理的人過來給我辦理，我問他們平常都是這種態度接待客人的嗎，這位工作人員的回覆是:我現在不是在幫你辦理了嗎？
作為一個國際酒店品牌，如此服務！衹能説謝謝浦東嘉裏讓我今後的酒店選擇少了個需要糾結的選項！

msg:交通很方便，七號線終點站。旁邊有商場，有會展中心。下午1:00左右到的，詢問已經可以辦理入住，而且運氣很好，房間已經打掃了。所以1點多就直接進房間了。定的是親子房，送了一個筆袋。可以自己塗顏色。房間在25樓，所以視野很好。房間很乾凈，床上已經準備好小童用物。
稍作休息就去小童樂園玩了。 期間有工作人員送了小點心，味道很好，關鍵是不甜。
優點:1畢竟是五星級酒店，工作人員還是很熱情的。入住當天旁邊有展會，所以進出的人也很多。前台辦理入住時，有一個工作人員維持持續衹排一個隊。然後會引導到不同的櫃麪，這樣就可以加快速度了。
2有一張房卡，刷卡不是很靈敏。一路上，電梯，房間門口正好有工作人員經過，都會主動幫忙。
3酒店畢竟有些年代了，床頭沒有插座的，所以放一個藍牙音響。既可以當做時鐘，又拖了一個三合一的充電線，正好解決了充電的問題。
4窗簾是手動的，估計年代久遠，再加上太陽曬了。那個塑料手柄，不小心被弄碎了。趕忙到前台做解釋，也做好了賠償的準備。很意外，負責此事的領導，第一句話是詢問我的手是否有受傷。並提出更換房間。
缺點:1酒店最大的賣點就是室內小童樂園，那麼暑假到了。是否可以調整一下時間？目前工作日是10點~19點，雙休日是10點~20點。個人覺得是否可以提早到8點開門。門口的工作人員很負責，但是滑梯旁邊的兩個工作人員衹顧着玩手機。裏面還是有些家長沒有穿襪子的。滑梯所用的滑墊也是靠小朋友自覺整理。並沒有專門的人負責整理。
2不知道是否出於環保考慮，房間裏面的垃圾桶是沒有套塑料袋，所以有些水，飲料之類的。就不大敢扔，擔心水灑在垃圾桶裏。
疫情三年，今年終於能出去玩了，所以這個酒店相對來説比之前好預訂，價格也差不多。寒暑假避開週末，工作日還會考慮再來。

msg:端午小長假就找個不出城的酒店泡泡。
酒店服務很好，設施也不錯，雖然開幕很久但都維護得很好，沒有陳舊感。
衝著泳池來的，場地寬敞，娃娃淺水池、正式泳道和温泉池把人羣分開。正式泳道最深不過1.4米，對三腳貓的游泳者來説非常友好。還有免費的小童浮板和麪條可借。而且泳道也分了戲水和來回遊道，避免了一鍋粥的混亂局面，體驗很好。
早餐的菜品很豐富，味道也好。就是高峯期要排隊，但整體秩序也還不錯。午飯晚飯如果不在酒店內解決也可以去隔壁的嘉裏城，餐廳眾多可選擇範圍也大。
這次來不及體驗網紅小童樂園，下次再試。
總之，對於沒有觀光要求、衹想舒舒服服泡泡泳池吃吃喝喝休息一下的親子家庭，這裏很值得推薦。

msg:1.整體評價：酒店整體很高級，位置好，離會展中心和嘉裏商城僅一步之遙。
2.摳細節的話，房間內衞生不算很好，窗簾和地毯都有點污漬，浴室牆壁窗門有一點點銹跡。可能因為住的人太多，且酒店有些許年份了，在所難免的，可以理解。
3.入住感受：酒店入住不用刷人臉識別，可能是為了方便外國住客。這個酒店很多外國人，來來往往的。
4.硬件設施：雙床房有一邊床旁邊沒有插座🔌，有點不便。電梯速度很快。房間隔音一般般，可能在房間裏説話聲音大點旁邊房間都能聽見。
