Special shout out to Ms Hayley from reception. She went the extra effort to help me make an online delivery. With my limited knowledge of chinese, she was quick to offer help.
Unlike her colleague, a man by the name Cong, who was relectant to help even when I asked.

Instead of having two rooms, we had 3 lovely rooms excluding the dining area, kitchen and living room. There was a steam bath feature in one of the bathrooms. Lovely! The only downside was the internet connection on the 32nd floor. It was not really great. Other than that, I had a lovely time and so did my friends. The service was great. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. The area is also in the city center. The malls are within walking distance. There is a Thai restaurant nearby if you fancy one.

The last time I stayed was in early April, a month apart. The first feeling I had when I opened the door was a strong musty smell, which lasted until I left. There were still obvious hairs in the bathtub in the room, the edges of the bathroom were not cleaned and yellowed, the bedding was washed yellow and wet, the kitchen countertops were not cleaned and were broken into pieces, and I didn't dare to use the refrigerator and washing machine when I opened the door. The front desk who checked in had a dark face throughout the whole process. All my requests were verbally agreed, but they were not done! But the reception of foreign guests afterwards was a smile throughout the whole process. Didn't I spend money?

When I wrote to Trip support, they ignored me. I wanted to cancel the reservation, but since the payment had gone through, I was waiting for my five-day stay to end. Leaving the hotel, I asked to take my suitcase to the taxi, since it was hard to carry up the steps, they tried to ignore me, but on the third attempt I forced the staff to do it!

The area that needs improvement may be that the curtains in the room are not black enough, which is not very friendly for people who need to sleep late. I was woken up several times by the light in the morning, and I hope it can be improved.

msg:The service attitude is really not good. The price has increased a lot due to the Canton Fair, and the temper at the front desk has become even worse. The waiter also asked her to come over and clean up. She looked reluctant and told her that she had worked hard, but she didn't even bother to give up. It made me angry that I had to pay for a high-end apar**ent while living in an ordinary rental house.

The hotel room is clean and hygienic. I really like the home appliances in the room, especially the laundry and drying equipment, which is good news for business travelers. The hotel staff are very friendly and the check-in process is very fast and easy. In particular, I would like to thank the reception staff at the door for being very active and enthusiastic every time to help open the door or carry luggage, and even ask if they need help calling a car. Especially recommended to friends who come to Guangzhou for business or pleasure!

The room is very clean and the furniture is so new. It's a pity that the TV in the bathroom of the master room is broken. I can't experience watching TV while showering 😂😂 The water power of the shower is a bit insufficient. Only the master room has a TV. It would be better if the other two rooms have TVs. When you are training, the air-conditioning vent in the room blows on the top of your head. I feel uncomfortable and want to get sick. If you can improve this problem, it will be a very good hotel. In addition, the breakfast environment is very good and the seats are very comfortable. Although there are not many food choices, the taste is not bad.

The front desk is polite and efficient, and the check-in process is completed quickly. The unit is spacious and clean, comparable to a five-star hotel. It is quiet and comfortable. Everyone enjoys this high-quality rest environment. There are all kinds of restaurants and shopping nearby, which is convenient! I asked for more toilet paper in the middle of the night and the front desk staff responded politely and quickly.
My family is very satisfied with these accommodations. Everyone said that they will definitely choose accommodation next time they come to Guangzhou.
The only thing is that the dining room only serves four people
Overall, it is a high-quality tourist facility

Because I mentioned it inadvertently, I was taken care of and upgraded the room when I checked in on the third day of the ***** New Year. The lobby manager can really consider issues from the perspective of customers. Seeing that there are children staying, I also specially prepared a set of children's toiletries and children's slippers, which is really hard work. The hotel is an apartment hotel, and the room has kitchen utensils and refrigerators, but there is no clam smell. The hotel is about 100 meters away from Grand View Plaza. Turn left a little to Central and Tee Mall, and turn left a little to Shipaiqiao Subway Station. The waiter is very polite. When they see it from afar, they will rush to get the luggage. When delivering the car, the two welcoming brothers also trot over. One is responsible for opening the door and the other is responsible for putting the luggage into the trunk. What does it mean to feel at home? That's it. I will come to this hotel again next time I come to Guangzhou, it's so worth it.

If you don’t go out on weekends, how can you spend two days and one night in the city center on weekends?

Oakwood Hotel is located at the junction of Tiyu East Road and Tiyu Dongheng Road in Tianhe District. Fangyuan Building, where the hotel is located, is a western-style building that can be easily identified.

The building has a total of 39 floors, and the 31st floor was occupied that day. The overall view is not bad, and you can overlook the Zhujiang New Town buildings: East Tower Chow Tai Fook Center, Evergrande Center, Pearl River City, Kingstown International, etc.

1. The hotel is an apar**ent type, and it provides induction cookers, exhaust fans, ovens, microwave ovens, home refrigerators, dishwashers, and a complete set of dishes and even bread machines and coffee machines that are required in the kitchen, but I don’t need a lot of cooking. not on.

2. The bathroom is actually equipped with a steam engine. Although there is no bathtub, it is a new experience to be able to take a shower and steam at the same time. The spare parts use a full set of Italian comfort zone brands, and the shampoo smells better. There is an all-in-one washer and dryer behind the bathroom door. Clothes after exercising can be washed that night, and closing the bathroom door has a great sound insulation effect, which does not affect watching TV and sleeping in bed after taking a shower.

3. The restaurant in the sky is also an Internet celebrity restaurant. From the scene layout suitable for marriage proposals, to the pink bear doll composed of petals to accompany the single diners, to the dinner plates, teapots and other tableware, all reflect the exquisite hotel. and restaurant management concept.

Overall, I am satisfied with this stay. The only small regret is that the swimming pool will not be open to the public during the maintenance period from October 1st to April next year. Don't run empty.

I wanted two bottles of mineral water when I went out the next day, but the front desk seemed unwilling to give them to me. Why did you send it to the room? You are so stingy.

Originally thought that the hotel would be old after so many years, but I didn't expect it to be so well maintained. It's the same as a hotel that has been opened for a year or two.
From the appearance of the hotel, it has a European style and is very good. It satisfies my love of taking pictures! It looks good no matter how you take it. Especially the room at dusk time. 🌆...It's so beautiful!
The hotel also has a semi-outdoor swimming pool and a gym. Taking pictures in the sunbathing area is very good. The hotel has many details and corners. The room has a city view from the opposite side. The feeling of being scattered high and low is a bit like Manhattan's immediate visual sense 🏙️

The overall stay is very satisfactory. The room is also very clean. The Wi-Fi speed is also very fast. I can play video games and play games without getting stuck 🤣🤣.

Again, the breakfasts are rather poor, but we did not leave hungry. The variety of desserts was a bit lacking. They didn’t exist at all, it was just one kind of puffs.

The restaurant is beautiful and the decor is very nice.

Liked the pool. Pretty clean and convenient that it's connected to the street but closed from the sun. In the heat of the moment, this is a real lifesaver. I would like the water a little warmer - 26 degrees at 38 outside - cold 🙈

The locker rooms have a hot jacuzzi and a sauna - a nice bonus.

The hotel is clean, the staff is very friendly and always ready to help. The location is very convenient, there is even a PCR test tent within a minute's walk. It is very comfortable. You don't have to travel far.

In a previous review, I already wrote about the proximity of attractions. It was convenient and we had great fun exploring the area on foot and visiting museums.

The room has excellent soundproofing, from the bedroom you can not hear what is happening in the living room.

The icing on the cake is a beautiful panoramic view to the west. Every evening we watched the sunset with the whole family.

We will definitely come back here again.

From the window, you can see the most elite high-altitude cityscape in Guangzhou, which is provided by the Aoshanfang restaurant on the 16th floor. Delicious food 🥩 is also rave reviews! Such a cost-effective hotel (the room rate only starts with 6), it must be one of the best choices for the next time you come back to the center of Guangzhou.

Seeing that you can win a night for as little as 600 yuan recently, I gave up other five-star chain hotels with similar price ranges, and booked another night to try.
The room spacing and layout are not as good as I imagined, but as an apar**ent, all the utensils should be complete, including all kinds of kitchen utensils. The most special point is that the shower has a steam sauna mode, which is still available. The facility has been well maintained over the years.

The restaurant is on the 16th floor. The difference from the previous stay is that the restaurant seems to have changed to a fashionable and romantic style. The crystal lighting inside is very unique, and the service level seems to have improved a lot.
This time on business trip is a bit rushed, next time you can make an appoin**ent with a good friend to check in.

msg:I came to Guangzhou for a business trip and booked this hotel.
I checked in for the second time, the security at the door was very polite, and walked over right after I got off the car, kindly asked if I wanted to check in, and then helped to press the 15th floor elevator. There is an automatic thermometer on the first floor, and a health code is required to complete the check-in procedure. Although it is a bit cumbersome, I feel quite relieved at the moment of the epidemic.

The room is larger than the average hotel, and it also comes with a kitchen, equipped with a washing and drying machine, and the conscience store is actually equipped with washing powder. Stayed for one night and didn't use those facilities, so I won't comment much.
The crystal glasses in the kitchen and the coffee machine look relatively high-end and high-end, haha, it's a waste of staying alone. Next time you take your family out for a trip, give priority to booking this hotel.

The security guard downstairs was very enthusiastic, took the initiative to open the door, and helped press the elevator to the 15th floor. There was not much carry-on luggage, and the front desk quickly checked in. Although there are layers of masks, they can also feel their enthusiasm. The room facilities are also good, floor-to-ceiling windows, large area, very comfortable to live. Next time I come to Guangzhou, this hotel will be my first choice.

另一方面，服務、問答各方面又都很嫻熟專業，無論是大堂還是保安、保潔，都是稱職靠譜的，這點，很多新酒店其實都不太行。我挑不出毛病。

旁邊的居民區小巷裡有很有趣的咖啡館和酒吧，離正佳廣場走路距離，太古裏還有其他天河區商圈也不遠，可以説各種方便。但是測核酸要走六七分鐘，按照北京標準來説就太遠了，可能在廣州是還好的，畢竟荔灣區的核酸點下午4點才上班也真的是太慵懶。。。

房間基本夠大，還有簡易西廚，適合長住幾天或者拖家帶口。
