msg:The good: 

The manager, Stanley, was very professional and ready to help when we needed it. 

The sea view is the best I've had in Hainan. I came to this hotel again mainly for the view. You can even hear the waves from the room and see the stars at night. 

Many people complain about the breakfast in the comment section, but it's not bad at all. There's different kinds of fruit, bread, coffee, eggs and write a few other dishes. It's definitely not five star, but my girlfriend and I (she's Chinese and I'm Canadian) enjoyed a long breakfast every morning. 

There's barely ever anybody on the beach and it's okay to go for dip in the sea, but you're technically not supposed to swim in it. 

There's a an area about 700 meters from the hotel where you can find different restaurants. 

The pool is very nice but isn't heated.

You can easily get around just walking, renting the electric bikes and calling a taxi to get to some hiking spots. We didn't find it necessary to rent a car despite being remote. 

The bad:

You are technically not supposed to swim in the sea.

The pool is too cold to comfortably swim in when the weather is not hot. 

The cleaning service does just an okay job on cleaning the room. 

There's no really good restaurants around that we could find. Although I find this to be a problem in most areas of Hainan. There is no real variation of food. 

There's no breathing in the rooms. 

Bring snacks because it's hard to find food in the afternoon unless you order from the town, but then you have to wait for it to arrive and the options are limited. 

There is a gym but with limited equipment.

The quality of breakfast was average considering the price of the room and overall hotel standard . The hotel restaurant food was overpriced and overcooked fish , very disappointed. My partner and I wanted a coffee in the evening , we had to wait for the restaurant to open to buy one , these are the additional details of a hotel service that I expected to be part of our stay , as the hotel sells itself on a luxury standard. Small details makes all the difference and does not cost much , overall beautiful place , fantastic location, great front desk staff

You can enjoy the good restaurant or just order some delicious food around the corner and enjoy it on the massive terasse with seaview as we mostly did.

msg:We booked a seaside villa room, and the hotel upgraded it to a sea view room for free. The view from the sea view room is great, and you can see the sea from the center position, which is great!

The hotel service is very good. On the day we just checked in, we happened to see the hotel staff picking coconuts. We watched for a while next to them, and the hotel's little brother gave us three big coconuts, which was really thoughtful!

The waves in Xiangshui Bay are relatively large, so you can't go swimming in the sea, but it is suitable for surfing. There are also several surfing shops around the hotel where you can find coaches to learn surfing. You can hear the loud sound of the waves standing on the balcony of the room, but the room is well soundproofed, and you can't hear it when you close the balcony door. It's very quiet to sleep at night.

There will be many small holes on the beach at low tide at night, and there are crabs in the holes. It is recommended to bring a small shovel to dig sand and catch crabs, which is quite interesting.

We checked in the day before May 1st, and there were not many guests. Maybe there were fewer guests in the hotel during the off-season. After May 1st, there were more guests. The hotel was still very quiet, and there were few people on the beach opposite, so you could contract the entire beach.

There are no supermarkets or restaurants near the hotel. The nearest restaurant is one kilometer away, so it is not very convenient to walk. There is a Hello electric car at the door of the hotel. We rented it for 55 yuan for 24 hours. Every time we rode the electric car to the nearby town to eat and go for a ride, it was also a good experience. Lingshui sour noodles are delicious, I recommend trying it!

In general, if you are driving a self-driving tour, or want to lie down and relax away from the crowd, I think this hotel is a good choice.
If you don’t drive, it’s still a bit inconvenient to stay here and try local food and go to other scenic spots in Lingshui.

There is an obvious problem with the room, and I don't know why it has not been improved. The bathroom and the bedroom are only separated by a wooden grille, which is not completely separated and can be seen through. Some spaces have no barriers and no curtains available. As a result, for a family of several people, especially those with older children, when someone uses the bathroom, others can only go out, or it can be dark without turning on the lights.

The villa is a bit old, with three floors and two rooms on the first floor. There are too few guests staying in the hotel. It is difficult to watch at night It was very uncomfortable and a bit scary. I had to change hotels urgently in the middle of the night and run away. It is not suitable to stay with small children. The children fell out of bed twice while playing on the bed. Once they fell on the carpet and scratched their face. The people staying in the hotel were really bad. There are very few rooms. Some places feel a bit cold during the day. There are no people on the beach. The beach is still a bit far away from the sea. The room is written as a sea-facing double bed room, but the room is too short. You can only see a little bit of the sea from the shade of the trees. There are no facilities in the room. The big hotel is comfortable, but the toilet is too old. It is not recommended for young girls to stay. The service is okay, but the location is not good, the facilities are old, there are too few people living there and it is a bit scary. It is too spooky at night, and the baby fell out of bed twice. Maybe the magnetic field is wrong, so I temporarily moved to another hotel in Sanya and felt more comfortable.

Every time you ask her if there is any food, she will reply that if you can see it, it will be there, and if there is no food, it will be gone! Then the air conditioner in the 6413 room we stayed in was really bad. From check-in to check-out for 4 nights, our air conditioner was not turned off, but the room temperature was always 23 degrees. As a result, we woke up from the heat several times every night and had to turn on the fan, which was very noisy! It seriously affected the quality of sleep. I asked to change rooms on the last night, but the waiter said that the air conditioners were basically the same. Anyway, the hotel I stayed in after returning to Haikou was a bit cold at 23 degrees. The temperature in this hotel was 10.5 degrees, but it had no effect! It’s 18 degrees outside at night and 23 degrees inside. It’s really more than a thousand times to spend a night in the sauna every day.

The main disadvantage is that the wind in Xiangshui Bay is very strong, so you can't swim in the sea. The strange thing about the hotel room is that the bathroom is open, there is no privacy at all, and the ventilation is not good.

First of all, the waiters are enthusiastic. Secondly, it is really close to the seaside.
Let’s talk about the shortcomings:
1. No one contacted me for a week after booking, but I took the initiative to contact me. I didn't take the initiative to ask when it would arrive, which was far behind other five-star hotels. 2. The air conditioner in the room is too loud and the cooling is extremely poor. 3. The mineral water actually comes with 2 bottles of ice dew. When I rented the Riyue Bay B&B, it was still 4 bottles of Nongfu Spring. 4. The kettle does not have a disposable package, so I don’t dare to use it. 5. The design of the ceiling fan in the room is very strange, and there are oily finger prints on the bedside. 6. Girls can’t close the balcony door at all, so why don’t you put some lubricant on it.
This is the first time I gave a low score. I don’t understand why Ctrip’s rating is so high. Overall, it costs more than 700 without breakfast. If I come here again, I think the price-performance ratio is really average. If it were not close to the sea, I might give it even lower.

It is very suitable for a few days of vacation. It's a pity that the hotel was unable to provide a buffet breakfast due to the small passenger flow. It only provided a very simple breakfast of steamed buns, noodles, and eggs, which was also very unpalatable. If the hotel can remind the guest at the time of reservation, or communicate with the guest on the phone after the reservation, the check-in mood will be better.

The hotel room and surroundings are well cleaned, and the people are quite welcoming. Maybe because the location is a little remote, there are not many people, so the hotel does not serve lunch or dinner, which is understandable because there are so few people. There are restaurants and hotels around. Hand towels, face towels, bath towels, and floor mats should be changed every day as long as you use them.

Because the weather has turned cold, no one is swimming, so there is no lifeguard by the pool. My two children are playing in it. A handsome boy immediately sent two bath towels to remind them to be careful of catching a cold. Within two minutes, my daughter in the pool was struggling with choking water. The handsome boy should have been working at the time, holding a mobile phone in his hand, and he rushed in to help me fish my daughter out without caring whether the mobile phone would be damaged by water.

There were so few varieties. The key point is that after watching the video, who can resist so many little bugs? If you can eat, go in.
The only good thing I can say is that there is no one on the beach, and you have your own private beach... I will not come again, nor do I recommend it!

The decoration of the hotel is a bit old, it seems to have a bit of Japanese original ecological style, the restaurant is a bit of American country style, the overall pursuit is simple, natural, not luxurious. The fly in the oin**ent is that the bathroom glass style is a bit flawed.

The advantage here is that the waves are big, and the beach is gentle and suitable for surfers🏄🏻 lovers. Arrived at the hotel at 10 o'clock in the morning. Since it was not the peak season, the hotel had a room and immediately arranged to check in. I am very satisfied. The room is also very comfortable, but the air conditioner is a bit weak, not cool enough on a hot day.

You can only choose directly between not opening the window for ventilation and opening the window to be bitten. It is strongly recommended to install it later, because I still want to live haha, but I really don’t want to be bitten by twenty more bags.

Environment: There are few people and quiet, and the beach is a bit dirty, but the advantage is that there are few people, especially during non-holidays, when people are almost invisible. There is a lighthouse nearby, it is very nice to take pictures, and there are many surfers beside the lighthouse.

Service: The service is given a full score. After all, the hardware is not a problem with the service staff, and the front desk tries to solve various problems as much as possible. The attitude is also very enthusiastic.

The sand here is very soft. The beaches of the five-star hotels in Bialong Bay are much better. The sea is also very clear and there is almost no pollution and garbage. The most important thing is that there are few people, perhaps because of the off-season.

The whole process took about two hours, from ten o'clock in the morning to past twelve o'clock , although it is very dry, but the photographer brother patiently guided me how to find the angle throughout the whole process, and even invited me to drink coconut milk. The brother's photo editing skills are also very good. It is not an assembly line operation. I can see the professional level and care. He helped me with the details.

The location of the hotel is very convenient for self-driving, and there are many parking spaces at the entrance. There are also many restaurants to choose from within 5 kilometers around. The hotel's internal facilities are quite good. The beach is white and thin, and many people play surfing and paragliding. They enjoy a large sea beach to themselves. If you want to swim, there is a swimming pool in the hotel. We live near the sea The villa has a large terrace. There are retractable hangers on the terrace to dry clothes. The water pressure of the shower is strong enough, and the hot water comes out quickly. The bedding is very comfortable. Although there is construction around, it does not affect sleep at night. There is a road on the left side of the hotel. A section of about two to three hundred meters is a bit narrow, and the road on the right has been repaired quite level, and the surrounding area is under development, and it is estimated that it will become a resort hotel in two years.

There are not many types of breakfast but they are all delicious! In addition, the hotel restaurant is facing a stage of rectification, and (it is said to be a new chef team) the restaurant as a whole is not open to the public. But because I bought the set meal a long time in advance, the restaurant manager still served us attentively, and changed the original barbecue into an optional dinner, which was unexpectedly delicious!

This layout feels a little fresh. The hotel is located in Xiangshui Bay. The two roads leading in and out of the hotel are like country roads. They are narrow and uneven. Be careful when two cars meet. Because of the "bias", it is extraordinarily quiet during the day and night, and it is a good place to be in a daze!

The hotel has its own beach, the sea view is extremely beautiful, there is a long coastline, the sea is blue, and the white waves are rolling. The hotels are all villas. The rooms are decorated in the style of tropical regions. Each room has a large terrace. The outdoors are planted with tropical green plants. The entire hotel environment is green, quiet and leisurely. When I woke up in the morning, I heard the chirping of birds outside the window, and the sound of waves not far away. Such a hotel is really suitable for a vacation. The service attitude and efficiency of the service staff are very good, consistent with the service standards of five-star hotels. I heard from the manager that the hotel will be redecorated during the off-season this year, and the original hotel facilities will be upgraded. I look forward to staying in ARK again when I come to Lingshui next time. It is the most suitable hotel to stay for a few days and relax. The most important thing is that compared with Sanya and Wanning, the price of this hotel is really So affordable.

I found a seafood restaurant nearby (ten minutes by car) by MT, which is very good. It is mainly for group buying, and its reputation and cost-effectiveness are very high. Personally, if you bring your children to the beach, I recommend this hotel. There are few people and it is very quiet.

For example, the door to the small courtyard of the villa was broken, and it was sealed with a wooden stick. The courtyard to my villa can only be passed through one room. The villa has a kitchen, but no pots and pans are provided, and you will be charged 300-500 if you bring your own to cook.

The advantage is that the price is cheap and can be used as a long-term living option. In winter, the swimming pool is too cold to swim, and the temperature is lower than Sanya.

There is nothing to eat for breakfast, no butter and jam. It is recommended to check the cherry tomatoes before delivery, if they are broken, take them out 😅😂
One more thing, is there a food limit? Why is there no answer to the question of whether there is an empty plate? It means no. It is not reasonable to accept the meal at 10:30 and not add anything at 09:30.

msg:The epidemic is unstable, so I chose a hotel close to my home to relax. Sanya has lived in many five-star brands, each with its own merits. But the overall facilities are complete and the details are in place. This hotel has a good environment. It's right by the sea, but the infrastructure is really speechless. Roads are being built on both sides of the hotel entrance. One of them is really not suitable for driving. The road is a big pit of about ten meters. The width of the road must be able to pass with good driving skills. The other road is gloomy and overgrown with ****s, as if it is an adventure. There are no bright spots when entering the lobby, but the environment of the hotel is good and the heart is a little relaxed. I live in a villa-type room. There is no elevator to go down the first floor. It may be due to the lack of guests. The room has a musty smell, there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom, and the floor drain is very smelly. . The living room, kitchen, chess and cards in the villa are quite public, but the bedroom is relatively small, there is no bedside table, and it is a bit inconvenient to put a teacup. At this time, it's cold, and the only entertainment is to go to the beach. The beach is great. It would be better if there are some children's play facilities and photo landscapes like the Marriott on the side. There are many blooming bougainvilleas on the platform out of the lobby, which is very eye-catching. If there are some decorations around the hotel, and some sculptures and miniature landscapes are added to the European-style buildings, it will definitely be more beautiful. The waiters are responsible for their respective responsibilities. The breakfast was delivered to the room and it was good. It's a bit long-winded, but I really hope the hotel has more improvements, and also to provide other guests with some understanding.

It's hard to think that you can find such a hidden world in Sanya, which is full of people.
My friend and I live in a five-bedroom villa. The new Chinese style with the whole white decoration makes people shine. When you open the window, you can see the beautiful sea view, and you can walk to the beach in five minutes. Definitely a healing treasure hotel.
We also want to praise the service of the hotel and the housekeeper Xiao Huang this time. We asked for a strange but very fast response. The attitude and the cordial feeling to the guests are something that many luxury hotels have never had.
Overall, this is a treasure with few people and the most cost-effective hotel you must stay in

Catering: There are both Chinese and Western styles for breakfast, which are quite rich. The dustpan dish provided by the hotel (pictured) is recommended. The portion is quite large and the taste is not bad. Green coconut 15 a, the price is reasonable.
Surroundings: The surrounding area is relatively desolate, and you need to drive to eat and shop.

msg:The location of the hotel is a bit remote, and the road is more like a country road. The hotel facilities are relatively new, but I don’t know why the maintenance is not good. The sliding door of the steel screen window in the originally scheduled room couldn’t be opened. I contacted the front desk, and a beautiful lady didn’t open it, because the balcony is a sea view room. In the end, I helped to upgrade the suite and add an extra bed. I would like to express my special thanks for the kindness of the people! It's a pity that I forgot to ask people's names, or I would just call and praise them. The hotel smells very strong, and the breakfast is quite satisfactory. The advantage is that there are few people and it is very quiet. The restaurant facilities and sanitation feel better than the room😂. Just 100 meters from the hotel is the shallow beach, very few people, unlike the Coconut Dream Promenade two days ago, like dumplings

This is the first time to stay in this hotel, the service is very good! It was raining heavily on the day we came, and the front desk of the hotel saw that our family of three added an extra bed for free. I want to mention his bed here, it's so comfortable! It's a good news for those who drive for a day. Even the extra bed is not an ordinary spring bed, but a kind of plank bed with a mattress. The feature of the hotel is the villa. I must stay there next time. There is a desk in the lobby where I can practice calligraphy. My son sat there and practiced all morning. The hotel is very good, the facilities are in place, and the service is in place!

The breakfast was rich and the restaurant service was special. it is good. There were many people surfing on the beach in the afternoon.

msg:I stayed in this hotel twice last year and this year. To be honest, it was because of the excellent performance last year that I stayed here this year. In fact, the rating is the overall performance. Last year, it was definitely full marks. This year, there are indeed many areas that need improvement.
1. Few people, sea view, and cost-effectiveness are directly pulled to the maximum. If your budget is not high and you like quietness, you plan to go to Fenjiezhou Island. This hotel is very suitable. Even if the hotels in Sanya are the best, it is really a bit annoying to have too many people. It is still worth affirming that there are few people and the sea view is good.
2. Service. One of the reasons why I had a good experience last year was that the service was very good, but I can't remember the name. This year, I didn't feel any service during check-in and check-out, including breakfast. I am a little regretful. Of course, I thank the lady who helped me deliver the takeaway upstairs.
3. It is really too remote. I basically rely on taxis to travel. There is nothing particularly delicious in the village behind Xiangshui Bay. There is a Hunan cuisine restaurant that is not bad for takeaway. Last year, it was very suitable just to see the sea + Fenjiezhou Island, but if you have other itineraries, it is really inconvenient.
4. I stayed in the same room this year as last year, but it really didn't change at all. The TV couldn't project the screen, the sofa on the balcony was rotten, and the bathrobe was washed white. The facilities really need to be improved. I was really disappointed this year.
5. Hygiene, the glass door on the balcony was dirty, the battery of the scale was out, and it really smelled a bit musty. I should use some aromatherapy. The push/pull in the bathroom was reversed. Of course, there was nothing to eat for breakfast as usual, which was expected.
All in all, it was really nice to stay in Lingshui for two days and visit Fenjiezhou Island. There were surprises, but if you come here specially with high expectations, you still have to consider it. 4 stars, looking forward to the day when it gets better.

msg:The location of the hotel is very quiet, the garden is designed in a Mediterranean style, and the beach is of good quality. Personally, I think the balcony above the second or third floor of the mainstream room has a better view of the sea.
The quality of breakfast needs to be improved, and the street lights driving into the hotel at night are not enough

msg:First of all, I want to thank Xiaoxiang for hosting me, and I am very grateful for the reception of these five days and four nights.
This time can really be said to be a very comfortable and perfect trip.
If you are like me, want to escape from the world, be quiet, and sunbathe on the beach when you leave your room, listening to the waves crashing on the beach...
Then this hotel can be said to be the best choice for Lingshui.
There are many things that cannot be described in words. Here are a few points for your reference:
Advantages: 1 super cost-effective, 2 very few tourists, 3 this is the sea view room with the most sea view room in Hainan I have ever stayed in, 180 ° + no dead ends, 4. every hotel staff is very sincere and polite , 5. Close to the beach, 6. The beach is very large and wide. 7. The bed is very comfortable, sleeps soundly, 8. The facilities are complete.

msg:I love this hotel! I will definitely come again! Bring your family next time! The king of cost performance! Heart-warming service!

#Room
I booked a room with two double beds. There is no problem sleeping 4 people. The room is very spacious on the senses. There is a balcony where you can see the garden view and the sea view. The room number is x110 (show it to me, I will stay here next time).

More special, the hotel also provides sandalwood and mineral water that should be local.

#surroundings
It's so close to the beach, which is very convenient. It is a private beach bar in the hotel section. The sand is very fine and can be stepped on barefoot, but swimming is not allowed. You can see the sunrise on this beach. The day I drove was cloudy and I didn’t see it. I’ll come back to make up for this regret.

#Serve
The little brothers and sisters of the waiters in this hotel are just fairies! ! Real names praise Xiaoyun and Xiao Chen! ! ! Don't be too caring~ I feel that many unreasonable requirements have been met, thank you again.

Xiaoyun contacted me before I checked in, confirmed my needs intimately, and chose this fairy room for me. He has always been very careful. My coat left in the restaurant and finally sent it back for me (I don’t even know about them. When I found that it was mine, I really can only describe it as caring, careful and sincere).

My leg was infected by a mosquito bite at my previous hotel. It was Xiao Chen who drove me to the hospital in a battery car and took me back. This shouldn't be their responsibility, it really makes people feel surprised and moved!

Love you guys! ! ! You make my trip in Lingshui even better!

I really like the interior design and decoration of the room, which is elegant and warm.
The service is also very attentive, from the reception to the room Xiaoxiang sister assists the whole process, and also helps to recommend places for dinner.

After 9 o'clock in the evening, I called to remind us that it was midnight when we arrived at the hotel. The butler Xiao Huang still checked in enthusiastically, sent the luggage into the room, and introduced the relevant location of the hotel while walking, which made us feel very cordial.
The hotel’s private beach is really super, super super, with few people and fine sand, so I love it.
The young lady from the hotel’s recreation center took us to experience how to catch horse racing crabs and gained knowledge.

2. The hotel's food and drink are very cost-effective (a meal of about 200 is good enough to eat, and it is clean and hygienic). If you are tired of living for a long time, you can go to Lingshui County to eat!
3. The butler here is enthusiastic and responsible. Especially the housekeeper Chen, who lost my belongings after I left the store, helped me search the room over and over again, and finally found it. Many thanks!

感覺是當地規劃的問題，香水灣的酒店分佈比較分散，很多酒店附近都是蠻荒地，沒有餐廳便利店。而ark的地理位置相對又比較僻靜，周遭幾乎沒有任何基礎便利設施，出行需要提前叫網約車、除早餐外吃飯都要靠外賣。所以剛到酒店時候心裏很忐忑，怕這幾天玩兒不好。
但ark獨享一片安靜海灘，而我們購買的兩晚別墅大床房套餐直接包含了分界洲的門票和來回接送，比起人聲鼎沸的三亞，這裏安靜的海灘和分界洲島果凍般的海水讓我們更chill地享受到海邊度假的舒暢。套餐內容將三天兩晚的行程安排地豐富但又不疲累，還不用自己去規劃路線、買票叫車，酒店都幫你搞定，真的非常貼心安逸，超值！ark下次還來！

第二，當天當地停電，沒有空調，一下拉低感官，進屋看到衞生間未清乾淨的水漬和發黴的味道讓我非常不舒服；
第三酒店因為人數問題也是不開自助餐的，但未提前告知，到店後通知沒有自助，衹有包了花圈，麪和粉湯飲料類，我與前台溝通後告知可以協調爭取，但第二天早上仍然是原套餐，並沒有任何改動，也未回覆我，綜上所述感官體驗極差，不會再選擇這家酒店。

msg:酒店是接手上一家的，從各種設計的地方可以看出，當初建設時候定位是非常高端的，可能因為口罩因素破產被接盤了。所以，酒店的硬件還是可以的，出門就是海，自然環境很好，唯一的不足就是酒店的早餐，應該是低於漢庭的水準。周圍有個小碼頭這個意外之喜，可以買到當地漁民捕撈的海鮮，最裡麪那家是真的，那種賣波龍的攤販請遠離。

吃飯:稍微要出行，打車10分鐘內。萬豪那邊海鮮店也能免費接送。
沙灘:酒店外就是沙灘，沙子細膩，很不錯，人也很少，適合放空。旁邊有兩三個沖浪機構，有學員在學習，人都不多。晚上沙灘上有很多小螃蟹，小朋友可以一直抓呀抓。
住宿:房間是海景房，別墅的三樓，房間整體都不錯，唯獨空調聲音比較大，最小風噪音也大。
整體還是不錯的

不足點就是周圍在施工，出酒店東西兩個方向的路都很狹窄偏僻荒涼。東邊2公里才能有人煙，西邊500米有個沙灘夜市，再500米才有商店，路況很差。所以，住店最好是自駕。沒車的，新手上路的慎重。
酒店位置在香水灣的一個村子裏，所以附近沒有什麼商業，就是鄉村大排檔，小店。基本沒有外賣。這裏相比清水灣開發還是差一些。不過離分界洲島很近，開車10多分鐘到碼頭停車場。

早餐可能因為過了旺季，衹有固定的套餐選擇，主食點心比較多。

泳池有服務人員在撈葉子什麼的，游泳玩水都蠻好的，就是換水可能還得勤快點。

前台服務不錯，退房時還送了象牌的飲用水。
總體來説適合度度假，希望外圍交通的路燈能改善一下。

在多次協調投訴下，還是不能夠讓我們提前退房，實在是令這次在陵水的度假體驗負分！在協調過程中，據説酒店聲稱自己並沒有説是海景房，衹是説是臨海，不屬於虛假宣傳，看把你機靈的！以為消費者保護法純屬搞笑是嗎？

環境：海景一流，而且去海邊距離近，適合躺平懶人。豪華別墅海景房一層有院子，從小院出門直接通向沙灘和大海。房間內床品舒適整潔，個別設施稍顯陳舊。空調給的很足。

服務：好評！點名表揚小黃管家和客房部的符秀蘭同事！適逢同行人生日，小黃管家表示可以幫忙提前佈置客房。晚上推開門，燈光、氣球、毛巾蛋糕和電燈蠟燭迎面撲來，效果拉滿，幫我們實現了給朋友一個驚喜的願望。感謝符秀蘭的優秀作品～

幾天住下來服務很加分。雖然有一些些小插曲，瑕不掩瑜，希望以後各方面能越來越完善成熟～

房間很書香 文人雅士的感覺 礦泉水 很好喝 哈哈哈哈
幫我們拿行李的辦理入住的小哥哥和人超好 我們帶着孩子 幫我們選了離沙灘最近的房間 … 在這裏再次表示感謝！ 

如果要説哪點稍微欠缺.. 大概就是整體樓房比較老舊..不過這都是每個酒店必經路.. 衞生是很好的…這點比較重要。 雖然一般除了資格五星老酒店都不考慮的我.. 還是覺得很温馨。 算是一個寶藏酒店～～～ 比心

我們喜歡安靜的環境所以選擇了離三亞市區比較遠的陵水，香水灣這裏海水海浪海岸海風都有它的特色，特別適合一羣志同道合的朋友，飛過來自駕出遊，靜靜的享受這裏的一切，一定不會讓失望❤️

因為酒店外至少兩公里都是土路，沒有路燈。我們一路開着車過來就覺得陰森恐怖。酒店前台居然還跟我説晚上如果不在酒店吃也可以點外賣？？這地方外賣小哥敢進來才見鬼呢！

酒店附近能吃飯的地方也是寥寥無幾，我們開車去了萬寧市區，本以為會好點，沒想到這個萬寧市破財的像個縣城，甚至連縣城都不如。

大眾點評排行前五的餐廳我們去了不是沒開門就是裏面黑黢黢的連燈都沒有，晚上六點連個吃飯的地方都找不到。像鬼城一樣。

説回酒店。設施還比較新。硬件沒什麼問題。的的確確是海景房，早上起來推開門景色還是很美的。不過晚上海浪聲有點大。

男票是滿意的。

還有，挺迷幻的，這家居然衹帶了一人份的早餐。一般都是雙早或者無早吧……

msg:第一次入住書香集團，五香四美都表現的很好，“書香”大堂、客房隨處可見的書籍和毛筆等等，“食香”酒店新出簸箕菜系，獨自出遊沒來得及嘗試，下次再來，吃的套餐味道也很不錯，“薰香”大堂內就設有兩台薰茶機，微風吹過就能聞到香味，房間內也有薰香可以使用，“茶香”大堂有免費茶水飲用，房間內也配備了紅茶綠茶，“花香”路上的雞蛋花、龍船花、鐵海棠、臘腸樹花開的很美，時不時還有小鳥蝴蝶飛來飛去。管家小雲服務很不錯，很到位。

msg:非常滿意的一家酒店，既有酒店的舒適服務，又有些家的温馨，因為有個專屬小管家解決各種問題，我們的專屬小管家是美女阿香，細緻又周到。酒店周邊環境非常好，依山傍海，海岸又寬又長，沙子細細的，特別適合帶娃玩耍。酒店房間也很舒服，寬敞明亮，特別提出是配備的礦泉水非常好喝。早餐種類較少，但是早餐人不多，基本的種類也都有了。小小的缺點是有點偏僻，適合自駕來。

文化有書香、美食有食香、美景有花香、美境有薰香、美道有茶香，本次旅途感到十分慶幸，感謝管家小香同學，服務很貼心，值得表揚！
